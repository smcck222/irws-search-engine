OUTTAKES: TINKERBELL T-SHIRTS?

Steven Spielberg's long talked-about Peter Pan project is set to begin 
production early next year -- as "Hook" -- with Dustin Hoffman as the dastardly 
Capt. Hook, opposite Robin Williams as a grown-up Peter, and Spielberg 
directing. At this writing, Julia Roberts is high on the list of possibles to 
portray Tinkerbell. 
</P>
<P>
We've also learned that the film, as now scripted by Nick Castle and John Hart, 
will mix the classic with the contemporary. Williams' character -- a 
stressed-out adult whose life takes a magical turn when he returns to his 
childhood home -- will be introduced in the present, eventually being 
transported to ageless Never-Never Land. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other contemporary touches: The Lost Boys start out as street types 
who ride skateboards and play basketball. The mermaids are on the voluptuous 
side -- with one sporting turquoise lips and bright orange hair. 
</P>
<P>
With such exploitable elements -- and Spielberg's tradition of licensing the 
heck out of his movie characters -- can a merchandising windfall be far behind? 
</P>
<P>
"You're too early," says Marvin Levy, spokesman for Spielberg's Amblin Ent., 
which is teamed on the project with distributor Tri-Star Pictures. "The 
merchandising aspects of this film will not be that significant.

"Safe Is Never Sex. It's Dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
That's the come-on line for promotional and ad materials hyping Orion Pictures' 
just-out "Hot Spot," starring Don Johnson as a stranger who drifts into a small 
town -- and into a steamy love triangle with sultry Virginia Madsen. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being grammatically odd, we wondered: what does it mean? 
</P>
<P>
"The line is a kind of a twist," says Christine La Monte, Orion's senior vice 
president of publicity and promotion. "It says that everything is dangerous in 
this film. That nothing is safe. 
</P>
<P>
"(Director) Dennis Hopper has a reputation for being on the edge of being 
dangerous. So it fits the filmmaker as well as the film, which is hot and 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmmmm. 
</P>
<P>
La Monte added that the film's campaign -- which also features the tag line, 
"Film Noir Like You've Never Seen," and three provocative photos -- has stirred 
up lots of talk and phone calls.

OUTTAKES: STEVEN SEAGAL WANTS HIS OSCAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pat H. Broeske 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With Steven Seagal's "Marked for Death" riding high at the box office -- it 
grossed nearly $12 million in its first four days of release -- the tough-guy 
star is at work on his native turf, Brooklyn, where he's just started shooting 
his next film. 
</P>
<P>
It's called "The Price of Our Blood" and Seagal tells us: "I'm finally doing a 
picture I'm excited about." 
</P>
<P>
The actor and martial artist calls it "a wonderful character piece that's about 
friendship -- two guys who grew up together who find themselves on different 
sides of the law, and then have to react to a personal tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Directed by John Flynn, and co-produced by Arnold Kopelson and Seagal for 
Warner Bros., "The Price of Our Blood" is from a script by Lance Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Or at least it was. 
</P>
<P>
"I've completely rewritten it," declares Seagal unabashedly. "I'm sure Lance 
Hill is a nice guy, but I'm also sure he's never been to Brooklyn. I've made 
the movie feel more real -- and I've emphasized the friendship, and the idea 
that these two guys who grew up together are suddenly working against each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
Known for his less-than-subtle action roles, Seagal adds that "The Price of Our 
Blood" "is my attempt at an Academy Award." 
</P>
<P>
Seriously? 
</P>
<P>
 "In this film, audiences are going to see a performance they aren't 
expecting," he insists. "Yeah, I could deliver an Academy Award performance. 
But I'm not kidding myself. Because I'm Steven Seagal, I will never get an 
Academy Award. 
</P>
<P>

You see her limbs, her thighs, her hands -- and one shot of her from behind, 
climbing from a swimming pool unclothed. But in "Welcome Home, Roxy 
Carmichael," while the camera tantalizes, it never reveals the face of the 
title character. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is set in Roxy's hometown, where residents await her homecoming. 
Wynona Ryder and Jeff Daniels star. 
</P>
<P>
Roxy's voluptuous body actually belongs to Ava Fabian, 28, former Playboy 
Playmate (August, 1986), who hails from Brewster, N.Y., and now lives in 
Hollywood. She has appeared -- face and all -- in the feature film "Dragnet," 
the upcoming "Auntie Lee's Meat Pies" and TV's "Married With Children." 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the easiest parts I've ever had," Fabian says of her role as 
Roxy. "There was no dialogue." David J. Fox

In Bernstein's article, there's so much bitterness in the reactions of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
In order for racism to die, both parties must forgive. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, some whites treated some blacks like dirt. But it is a new day. 
</P>
<P>
Being 21 years old, I was not alive during the Civil War or even the civil 
rights movement. I hope any Negroes still bitter can forgive me for being 
white.

Bernstein's article indicated that the miniseries lessened some people's 
opinion of Lincoln vis-a-vis slavery. I was saddened to hear this. 
</P>
<P>
In 1854, Lincoln largely abandoned a prosperous law practice and -- at much 
financial and personal loss -- spent 10 years doing everything practical and 
possible on behalf of the slaves. 
</P>
<P>
He stopped working only when all slaves were liberated by constitutional 
amendment, actual ratification of the amendment occurring toward the end of the 
year in which he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln has been criticized for not working sooner to free the slaves in the 
Old South. Had he done so, he would not have been elected President and the 
slaves would have remained in bondage for God knows how many decades. Had he 
taken a stronger anti-slavery position sooner, he would have been just one more 
ineffective abolitionist. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln accomplished the miracle of the freeing all slaves and saving the 
Union. No person ever accomplished so much.

<P>
In most wars, a phony moral issue has to be dreamed up to get people to fight, 
and historians tend to perpetuate the myths to justify their side's engagement 
in a murderous conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The Civil War was no different. 
</P>
<P>
There was an economic deadlock between the industrial North and the agrarian 
South. The war was fought not for any noble aim on either side but for selfish 
control of the nation and for materialism -- the ascendancy of one section over 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
Even though it was England and the Northern bankers and shipping interests that 
transported slaves to our land, the slaves were ill-equipped for the severity 
of Northern winters and they fit in with the demand for more field hands in the 
South (generated by the cotton industry).

As I watch the remarkable account of the American Civil War on PBS, I am 
reminded that during that war most of the combatants and civilians forgot, over 
time, what the war was all about: to preserve the Union. 
</P>
<P>
I am reminded that today in the situation we face with Iraq many of us have 
forgotten already why the Union is in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
It is not oil that introduced our armies to Saudi soil, but the right of 
self-determination of peoples. Now we talk only about oil prices, oil supplies, 
oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
If we are to enter into a conflict that may terminate the lives of innocent 
Americans and others, then let it be for the right reason -- the primary reason 
Americans have put their lives on the line throughout our history -- for the 
right of liberty.

EXPENSES FOR 'THAT BIG DAY' ARE A DISGRACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In February of this year, our family and friends joined us in celebrating our 
son's bar mitzvah. After ably demonstrating his mastery of Biblical Hebrew and 
its interpretation, my wife and I blessed him as our parents had blessed us a 
generation ago. 
</P>
<P>
We then hosted a quiet and dignified luncheon for our guests at which we could 
actually hear ourselves talk and reminisce. There was no band, no disc jockey 
and certainly no clowns or Laker girls. And they weren't missed. When a 
well-meaning cousin asked what our "theme" was, we simply said, "Religion and 
family." 
</P>
<P>
The responsibility of bringing perspective to the bar mitzvah celebration and 
limiting the vulgar aggrandizement plaguing the process lies with the parents. 
Moreover, we are absolutely confident that, far from cheating our children, our 
son (and his sister after him) will reflect on the true meaning of that sacred 
day and will always warmly recall the love, tradition and spirituality we 
shared, undistorted by the fleeting and faddish grotesqueries apparently 
coveted by so many others.

When I came home from my office at Wilshire Boulevard Temple yesterday, there 
were two bright-eyed, happy girls at work with my wife. She was teaching them 
the complicated knots for the traditional fringes that were to grace the 
corners of their homemade prayer shawls. 
</P>
<P>
Making those prayer shawls with the help of their mother, two grandmothers and 
a great-grandmother was an exciting part of the family's bat mitzvah 
preparations. 
</P>
<P>
In my 42 years as rabbi of Wilshire Boulevard Temple, an old (chartered 1862), 
large (2,500 families) and prestigious Reform Jewish congregation, I have 
witnessed very few bar or bat mitzvah celebrations matching the image projected 
by your article. They exist. They are an embarrassment. They subvert a sacred 
ceremony whose meaning should be the preparation of a young man or woman for a 
responsible life of caring and of giving. 
</P>
<P>
Thank God, in the majority of cases, it is.

HE PUTS NO STOCK IN THE BUG MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cathy Endfield, the "Rent-a-Bug-Lady" (Sept. 30) says insects are lacking in 
pain receptors and have no emotional life. Unfortunately, the real issue 
involves the worldwide disappearance of wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Pet shops have long drained remote places of tropical fish, reptiles and birds. 
Now insect dealers and shell shops are trading in more exotic organisms. 
Poaching, habitat loss and human encroachment have made even isolated species 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
Beetles, butterflies, ants, wasps, scorpions and grasshoppers serve a purpose 
in nature. Insects pollinate flowers and fruit, and are essential to the food 
chain. Beetles are an important part in the breakdown of leaves, twigs and 
rotting wood. 
</P>
<P>
By creating a market for the world's largest or most beautiful moths, spiders 
and beetles, as well as the ugly or unattractive forms, these dead-bug dealers 
continue the attack on the now-fragile ecosystem. None of these mounted 
specimens will ever reproduce. 
</P>
<P>
This siphoning off of rare and unusual species must stop, or we may be witness 
to the end of nature.

EXPENSES FOR 'THAT BIG DAY' ARE A DISGRACE

<TEXT>
<P>
Page one of the Oct. 2 View section tossed me between the emotions of 
astonishment, pride and respect on the one hand, and disgust, revulsion and 
embarrassment on the other. The article "True Grit" described the rigorous, 
all-but-unbearable training young sailors undergo to qualify as SEALs in the 
U.S. Navy, "the military's most elite operational force." Side by side with it 
was "What Price for That Big Day?" describing the escalating expenditure by 
families of my co-religionists on the "theme" bar and bat mitzvah celebrations 
-- in exploitation of which there was recently held what was deceptively called 
"Los Angeles' first bar mitzvah planning show." I say "deceptively" because a 
planning show for the coming of religious responsible age of Jewish boys and 
girls would have to do with texts, and learning processes and customs and study 
of the Mitzvot, the religious precepts and privileges now accorded to the young 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
It was disheartening for me, as a rabbi these past 45 years, to read of the 
costly, circus atmosphere of the celebrations being touted by the exhibitors at 
that show. What do they teach the young celebrants? They teach that conspicuous 
consumption, competitive extravagance (and) over-indulgence are somehow 
connected with coming of the age of responsibility of the Jewish adolescent. 
</P>
<P>
This is a false, totally un-Jewish doctrine. Gluttony, Bacchanalia and the 
idolizing of objects are precisely the kind of paganism against which Judaism 
fought from its very beginnings. These are not the values we aim to teach. We 
aim to teach values of spirituality, moderation, modesty, charity, learning. 
</P>
<P>
As for a celebration, let there be a celebration, of course. Host the 
congregation for a collation in the social hall after the service. Have a party 
at home for the circle of personal friends of the bar/bat mitzvah, a kids' 
party where they can actually have fun. Have a family gathering for the adults 
and their close friends instead of a big bash to discharge a host of business 
and social obligations.

CYCLISTS RIDE THE RANGE -- THOUGH IT FEELS MORE LIKE A STOVE

<P>
When Texas towns throw summer festivals to scare up tourist dollars, the party 
tends to go a little rough on the animals. 
</P>
<P>
In Sweetwater they trap rattlesnakes, in Anahuac they hunt alligators and at 
the World Championship Barbecue Goat Cookoff and Arts and Crafts Fair in Brady 
. . . well, you get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
On the Saturday before Labor Day weekend, though, the animals get even. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Wichita Falls puts on the Hotter 'N Hell Hundred, a bicycle ride 
across 100 miles of North Texas ranch and oil land in temperatures near or 
above 100 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
At this shindig, it's the people who roast on the spit. 
</P>
<P>
The Hotter 'N Hell Hundred goes hard on these humans -- or rather, these humans 
go hard on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
As the sun starts glowing and the Great Plains winds notch up to blow dryer 
force, the route, it has been said, begins to resemble the road to Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
At the rest stops -- tents at 10-mile intervals -- groups of up to a thousand 
overheated peddlers litter the ground like so much road kill, gathering the 
strength, fluids and resolve to press on. 
</P>
<P>
Not infrequently, flatbed trucks and vans and ambulances flash by, hauling in 
the vanquished. 
</P>
<P>
The scene gets progressively uglier past the 50-mile mark, gleefully dubbed 
Hell's Gate I. The head of the ride's complement of about 400 medical 
professionals calls the terra beyond the gate the "high risk" zone -- and the 
M.A.S.H.-style medical tents are usually rocking. 
</P>
<P>
At the 1989 HHH, as it is called, 11,875 recreational riders steamed out from 
the 7:30 a.m. start. By the end of the day, 682 required medical attention -- 
just over half of those for heat cramps, heat exhausting and other 
temperature-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
But that was a good year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, when ride-day temperature actually reached 100 and the winds blew 
hard, doctors and nurses hooked 276 people to saline-solution IVs. Worse yet, 
the HHH registered its first fatality. A 51-year-old Kansan with a history of 
heart trouble keeled over with a coronary attack after reportedly ignoring 
warnings to stop and climb off. 
</P>
<P>
The ride's name notwithstanding, organizers, civic boosters and well-trained 
cyclists tend to play down the self-inflicted pain and suffering quotient that 
gives the HHH its fame. 
</P>
<P>
At the Wichita Falls visitor's bureau, assistant manager Lisa Bodin talks about 
how "families with little ones" turn out to tackle the shorter distances -- the 
10-, 25-, 50- and 62-mile courses. 
</P>
<P>
In its coverage of the 1989 event, the Wichita Falls Times and Record News 
played up the lack of serious injuries -- only 34 were hospitalized, nobody 
died -- and the holiday atmosphere brought on by the big crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, which prints a 56-page section for the event and mails it to 
participants, was also quick to tout how the out-of-towners booked nearly every 
motel room in a 50-mile radius and spent almost $1 million on food, lodging, 
cycle stuff and on and on. 
</P>
<P>
There is that side of it. 
</P>
<P>
But the image that adheres more in people's minds when they talk about the HHH 
is the scene at the finish as the August sun, Wichita Falls' lemon for the 
lemonade, starts barbecuing the plodders. 
</P>
<P>
It's a picture of a less-than-perfectly-trained 100-miler wobbling in after six 
or eight or 10 hours in the saddle. Looking like a truck with a bad radiator, 
the two-wheel zombie lurches across the line, drops from his or her bike and 
begins vomiting at the edge of the road. 
</P>
<P>
Just over a year ago, James Goodwin, Joe Vacek and Stanley Wren were three 
professional guys on garden-variety bicycles out for weekend spins in Houston 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing heavy. Just a little workout for the waistline. A little nudge to the 
cardiovascular system. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd joke about the 'cycle geeks,' " says Goodwin of the stern-faced 
enthusiasts who'd pump by in bright Lycra shorts and funny helmets on their way 
to who knows where. 
</P>
<P>
But something a little nutty crept into their lives as the year went by. 
</P>
<P>
More than 10 million cycles were sold in 1989 as the national cycling boom 
continued to surge. Goodwin, Vacek and Wren bought three of them -- and 
helmets, poison-green shorts, special handlebar rigs, "hydration systems," 
pedal systems, cycling shoes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
High-carbohydrate drink mixes, energy boosters and protein potions began 
multiplying in their kitchens. Their freezers sprouted crops of portable water 
bottles, chilling for the next training run, the next long ride. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, the three entered the Katy Flatland 100, their first "century," 
and they finished in about six and a half hours counting stops. Next on their 
list is the Hotter 'N Hell Hundred. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the 1989 riders were between 21 and 50, and 71% were men. 
About half of them shot for 100 miles, the rolling answer to a marathon. 
</P>
<P>
"You go out on a ride and you see underneath it there's this terrifically 
masochistic pulse," says Lawrence Wright, an Austin, Tex., free-lance writer 
who has survived the race. 
</P>
<P>
"You're out there and you think there's this leather-suited lady with a whip 
bestriding you. It's a narcosis, like being a hundred feet underwater and the 
current is pulling you. You're enraptured by it." 
</P>
<P>
At the HHH, the best-attended 100-mile ride in the nation, the attraction is 
heightened because you feel you're being pulled by the crowd, he says. 
</P>
<P>
For Wichita Falls, a recession-struck oil city of 95,000 that has been losing 
population over the decade, the HHH has become enormous in terms of money, 
image and publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Just about everything surrounding the race, from police assistance to the 
hauling of 90,000 pounds of ice to the rest stops, is volunteered or provided 
free for promotional purposes, says Jo-Alice Davis, the ride committee's 
business manager. 
</P>
<P>
The well-stocked rest areas, some pitched with themes such as "Christmas in 
August" or "Tropical Paradise," are manned by local businesses. To make up for 
the shortage of area motel and hotel rooms, about 300 residents lend their 
homes to the cause, offering bed and breakfast for nominal $10- or $20-a-night 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people think this is put on by the Board of Commerce and Industry," says 
race founder Roby Christie, referring to the city's economic development 
agency. "It isn't. It actually started out as a little local event to go along 
with our centennial." 
</P>
<P>
As the story goes, Wichita Falls' centennial committee hired an expert to plan 
the summer of 1982. The consultant came back with the idea of holding a rocking 
chair contest. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't think that captured the spirit that built this area," says Christie, 
a post office customer service manager who at the time had just formed a cycle 
club. 
</P>
<P>
"Century" rides were rare in the early '80s, but the idea fit. 
</P>
<P>
In an unintentional stroke of marketing genius, a member of Christie's cycling 
club offered the name -- an obvious choice for Wichita Falls in late August. 
</P>
<P>
The first year, about 1,100 locals hit the road, including a few kids on 
drop-on-the-driveway, fat-tired banana bikes who finished the 100-mile loop. 
</P>
<P>
Soon enough, though, the growing cycle crowd found its way to Wichita Falls and 
the ride with the toothsome name. Every year through 1988, total entries grew 
by a number equal to the total of the two previous years. 
</P>
<P>
What started as a one-day event grew to four -- all the better to keep the 
visitors in town. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the city's more rigid Christians remain put off by the ride's name and 
it alienates a handful of potential sponsors, says Christie. "They don't want 
to be affiliated with hell." 
</P>
<P>
Underneath it all, there's a bigger issue, too -- the problem of putting so 
much stake in an event that is tough enough, under the worst of conditions, to 
kill. 
</P>
<P>
The paradox of keeping the ride safe but challenging enough to keep drawing 
hard-riding enthusiasts has weighed heavily on the HHH, particularly since 
1988, the year it was hotter 'n' hell and 92 people were packed off to hospital 
emergency rooms. 
</P>
<P>
That year, even avid cyclists such as David Danford, president of the San 
Antonio Wheelmen and a 100-mile-a-week, mid-summer trainer, found the going 
rough. "The wind was terrible," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
As the ride's medical director, Dr. Jerry Alexander's job has been to think 
long and hard about safety at the HHH, and it isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Alexander decided in the middle of the ride to cut the course short 
for at least 2,000 "century" riders who had failed to reach the 60-mile mark in 
less than three hours and 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
He made the decision, he says, because forecasters predicted the wind would 
pick up through the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't, and the call prompted grumbling around Wichita Falls and a folder 
full of angry cyclists' letters. 
</P>
<P>
Still, several new precautions were added this year. Among them: An extra rest 
stop was set up about 75 miles into the ride, on the western leg of the route. 
</P>
<P>
"People come to this ride with personal goals. They don't quit on them easily," 
Alexander says, explaining how many riders will usually put up an argument 
before admitting their dreams of finishing are torn. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the bad guys, I know," he says. "But somebody out there has to be 
realistic. Somebody has to say they've had enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Editor's note: 11,560 recreational cyclists started the August, 1990, ride. 
That day the mercury hit 103, and, just above street level, reportedly was 
measured at 119. Alas, no figures are kept on how many starters actually finish 
the race.

THE MASS-MARKETING OF JEAN AUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Browsers in 4,000 American bookstores these last few weeks may have mistaken 
the satin, six-foot-long banners that say "IT'S COMING!" for the announcement 
of a major religious phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Jean M. Auel's millions of fans might very well view the 
publication of "The Plains of Passage," the latest in Auel's "Earth's Children" 
series, as a spiritual event of its own. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a devout following," said Andrew K. Martin, vice president and director 
of publicity at Crown, Auel's hardcover publisher. "It's not a cult, exactly, 
but it's just huge, and it's intense. Jean is so loved by her readers." 
</P>
<P>
Auel's fans are so devoted, in fact, that they regularly name children after 
Ayla, her Ice Age heroine, and are so persistent that they've called Martin's 
office day in and day out for years asking for progress reports on the new 
book. Finally, Martin was forced to take refuge in a form letter that said, 
"Dear Reader, Thank you for your inquiry regarding the fourth novel in the 
celebrated 'Earth's Children' saga. As of this date, author Jean M. Auel is 
still at work. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The success of Auel's previous three novels combined with this intense level of 
interest surrounding "The Plains of Passage" prompted Crown to schedule a 
massive 1.3-million first-run hardcover printing. "There probably have never 
been higher expectations for a novel," said Chip Gibson, Crown's associate 
publisher and marketing vice president. Echoing this optimism, Stuart 
Applebaum, vice president of Bantam, Auel's paperback publisher, called "The 
Plains of Passage" "perhaps the most anticipated popular novel in the last five 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Crown's "major six-figure" marketing campaign resembles a crusade. Martin, 
Gibson and others at Crown "sat around to hash out" a marketing drive that 
would run on "two or three phases," Martin said. Martin said the strategy, 
planned with military precision, is "all geared to answer that question that 
has been going on for five years -- 'When is the next Jean M. Auel?' It's 
saying, 'Get ready, folks, it's here.' " 
</P>
<P>
First, the "IT'S COMING!" banners went up in stores in mid-September. On Oct. 
3, when "The Plains of Passage" arrived in bookstores, they were replaced by 
satin banners of the same proportions that said "IT'S HERE!" For Phase Two, 
along with full-page advertisements in most major newspapers. Crown has teamed 
with Bantam to create a floor display with Auel's three previous books. 
</P>
<P>
"They will be selling in hardcover right alongside the Bantam paperback," 
Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the third phase will spotlight Auel, the author who never wrote a word 
before she was 40, and who turned down a top-paying job with a bank to become 
what Newsweek once called "the late-Pleistocene Harold Robbins." Auel, 54, will 
tour for a month-and-a-half, autographing books in two stores per city. In 
addition, Crown plans a 30-city satellite tour. 
</P>
<P>
"We really started out trying to keep it down," Martin said of the author's 
publicity expedition. 
</P>
<P>
Auel is not the only author, of course, who has a fanatical following. Carol 
Schneider, vice president for publicity for Random House, says fans of James 
Michener and Robert Ludlum are prone to call and say, "My father's in the 
hospital dying. Couldn't you just get it to me ahead of time so he can read it 
before he goes?" 
</P>
<P>
And sizeable publicity blitzes have also been seen with best-selling authors 
such as Tom Clancy, Danielle Steel and Stephen King. Along with Auel, said Greg 
Mowry, associate publicity director at William Morrow, "those seem to be the 
four authors who are impervious to changes in the marketplace. They're the ones 
you can go to the bank on." 
</P>
<P>
But Clancy, King and Steel, who publish books on an almost yearly schedule, are 
less likely to hit the interview trail, and are almost certain not to be seen 
signing books twice a day for a month-and-a-half. By contrast, the publicity 
drive designed for Auel, Mowry said, is "what I call a typical, glitzy 
mass-market paperback approach to a hardback." 
</P>
<P>
In the Auel offensive, "You're seeing the mass-marketization of hardcover," 
Mowry said. "It's totally mass-market. It's a campaign designed to reach the 
widest audience." 
</P>
<P>
The mass-market approach makes sense, said Applebaum, of Bantam, because "Jean 
is selling hardcovers in mass-market quantities. Therefore, the techniques that 
her publishers are putting forward are appropriate to the consumer demand." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, said Mary Ann Palumbo, the vice president for advertising, 
promotion and publicity at NAL, "I think more and more hardcover houses are 
doing things that paperback publishers do." Palumbo was responsible for what 
Greg Mowry called the "fabulous launch" in paperback of Ken Follett's "The 
Pillars of the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Auel's publicity extravaganza, Bantam's Stuart Applebaum said, 
"to not do it would be like not crossing the street" to get to the other side. 
Logic might suggest that such an enormous promotion might not be necessary for 
an author whose readers have been calling and writing about this book for the 
last half-decade, but as Applebaum said, "It's not so much that it's necessary, 
it's almost a reader service in this case." 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, this kind of effort also may be a publisher's service. "Everyone 
else wants to lure these authors away," Morrow's Mowry said. Publishers who 
stage lavish and innovative publicity programs "are protecting their 
investments." 
</P>
<P>
Auel, Crown's investment, is using every last minute before the cross-country 
stump begins to research her next books at the caves of Lascaux in southern 
France. Mother of five, grandmother of 14, Auel retains "a complete lack of 
affectation or pretension," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
"She's definitely not of the glamour set," he said. "She's a real celebrity of 
the people, of the masses." 
</P>
<P>
And "masses" is exactly the quantity of copies of "The Plains of Passage" that 
Martin expects to sell. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be incredible," Martin said in a voice that was full of, yes, 
anticipation.

RICHARD EDER: HERE'S TO YOU, SENORA ROBINSON; 
</P>
<P>
IN PRAISE OF THE STEPMOTHER BY MARIO VARGAS LLOSA TRANSLATED BY HELEN LANE 
(FARRAR, STRAUS GIROUX: $18.95; 148 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Advancing age tends to rearrange the eyesight so that in order to see the page 
clearly, you hold it farther away. After grappling intimately, stylishly, with 
the aching turbulence of Latin America, the Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas 
Llosa has taken a witty distance to construct a lucid literary artifact. 
</P>
<P>
"In Praise of the Stepmother" is a toy, but rather on the order of the gold 
clockwork nightingales in Yeats' Byzantium. It says a heartlessly lofty thing 
or two about human folly, though it has a good deal of fun, some lascivious, in 
doing so; and imparts it to us as a Japanese chef might impart a blowfish: 
pleasure on the edge of poison. 
</P>
<P>
The story of the exquisite Don Rigoberto, his beautiful and susceptible second 
wife, Lucrecia, and her golden-curled, limpid-eyed little stepson, Fonchito, is 
a comically cautionary tale. Rigoberto arranges himself an earthly paradise; it 
implodes on him. Build yourself a better mousetrap, and you will inevitably 
fall into it. 
</P>
<P>
Rigoberto is the dull though prosperous manager of a Lima insurance company. 
Thedullness is like the facade of a Spanish-colonial house: uncommunicative 
white walls, iron-barred windows and, in the interior, a flowering patio with 
songbirds. As a youth, Rigoberto joined Catholic Action in order to fashion a 
more perfect world. Now, middle-aged, he labors devotedly to fashion a perfect 
world for himself in the castle of his home. 
</P>
<P>
Perfection means assiduous cultivation of his body: his health, his toilette, 
his excretory functions. Like an alchemist turning lead to gold, he spends 
hours each evening cleaning, pumicing, trimming, polishing and perfuming 
himself. All this perfecting, this body worship, has as its object the bodily 
worship of Lucrecia, and the achievement of superb nightly orgasms. 
</P>
<P>
Rigoberto and Lucrecia are labored over -- by Rigoberto; we shall see about 
Lucrecia -- with the inspiration that goes into a work of art. To assist his 
fantasies, Rigoberto has collected erotic paintings, prints and texts. And the 
successive chapters of Vargas Llosa's brief book -- as polished as Rigoberto's 
armpits, or his talcumed feet that give off "a slight, virile odor of 
heliotrope at dawn" -- meld the story with selected paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Colored plates of these, mostly celebrated and sensual, are inserted for the 
reader. The effect of Jordaens' Gyges and King Candaules spying on the king's 
bathing wife, of Boucher's "Diana at the Bath," of Titian's "Venus With Cupid 
and Music" as successive keynotes for the text is not illustration so much as a 
gently sardonic hyperinflation. 
</P>
<P>
Rigoberto, for example, who among other fixations is specially fond of 
buttocks, proclaims himself to Lucrecia as King Candaules showing off to Gyges 
the splendid proportions of what he likes to inflame himself by calling his 
wife's "croup." 
</P>
<P>
The thing about fantasies, though, is that everyone can play. Lucrecia acts out 
Rigoberto's with wifely devotion, but she has her own. She too sees herself as 
Venus, but a Venus whose particular arousal comes not from her lord and master 
but from the Cupids fluttering about her. The cover of the book -- a detail 
from Bronzino's all-but-drooling portrait of the goddess in high excitement 
from the child tweaking her nipple -- clearly foretells what will happen. 
</P>
<P>
Fonchito will. Beautiful as a cherub, amoral as the tiny love-god, malevolent 
as a vengeful Puck, he seduces his stepmother. More exactly, he helps her to 
seduce herself. What comes of it need not be described here, but at the end, 
Lucrecia has been thrown out, Rigoberto has turned to prayer and mortification 
-- we are helpfully offered Fra Angelico's "Annunciation" as the final colored 
plate -- and Fonchito reigns. 
</P>
<P>
"Fresh, round and full, childish, his laughter drowned out the sound of the 
water in the washbasin, appeared to fill the whole night and mount to those 
stars which, for once, had appeared in the muddy sky of Lima," Vargas Llosa 
concludes. 
</P>
<P>
The author is silky; so is Helen Lane's translation. Vargas Llosa has written a 
genuinely erotic story and a marvelous parody of one. The epigraph by Cesar 
Moro strikes precisely the note of Gallic intellectualism that he seeks: sex as 
discourse, with roots going back to Laclos and Sade: 
</P>
<P>
"It is only natures entirely given over to vice whose contours do not grow 
blurred in the hyaline mire of the atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
From there we get the foolishly exalted comedy of Rigoberto's absolutions. At 
stool, he conducts a delicate rite of purification. "You're gone, you rascal 
you," he interpolates the results, "and can't ever return." Fantasies of 
perfection are punctured by fantasies of beastliness. A deformed face by 
Francis Bacon allows him to imagine himself as a monstrous, boil-inflamed nose, 
seducing women by allowing them to confront their own secret shames and fears 
of ugliness. 
</P>
<P>
Lucrecia's transports with Fonchito, equally parodic, are less amusing; 
probably because, more innocent, she will be the more abominably victimized. 
Paradoxically -- eroticism is paradoxical by its nature -- they are more 
genuinely sexy. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Rigoberto's lucubrations are not really about sex at all, but about 
power. If Vargas Llosa's toy has a message beyond its inveigling clockwork, it 
is here. Behind the macho is the solipsist. The Spanish yo is the strongest and 
most assertive of first-person singulars; much more so than the frailer English 
I, the French je, the German ich. 
</P>
<P>
Rigoberto's ultimate fantasy concerns not fornication but reigning alone, 
untouchable, immune to any external contingency. If you cannot rule the world, 
you can dictate to your body, your senses, your bedchamber. Is Vargas Llosa 
aiming at the ungovernability of a male society made up entirely of one-subject 
dictators? Somewhat, I think. In any event, Fonchito is an agent of 
revolutionary chaos that goes far beyond Don Rigoberto's perfumed domestic 
arrangements.

MAGAZINES: FIFTEEN JOURNALISTS HAVE COME TO AMERICA TO LEARN HOW A FREE AND 
COMPETITIVE PRESS WORKS.

<P>
When Lukasz Malachowski edited an influential weekly back home in Poland, the 
bottom line was maintaining journalistic integrity while avoiding the ire of 
Communist government censors. 
</P>
<P>
Came the revolution and all that changed. The censors were gone, but so were 
the government subsidies for essentials such as paper and ink. Competing for 
survival became the new bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was subsidized or donated. We never had to think whether it could 
be sold or not. . . . Now we have to think over all these things or nobody will 
be able to survive," says Malachowski, 35, whose Catholic Weekly Review 
essentially went broke with the change to a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
Malachowski is one of 15 Eastern European journalists spending 10 weeks at 
American magazines such as Elle, Rolling Stone, Business Week, Family Circle 
and Esquire in an internship program sponsored by the U.S. government and the 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
The interns, seasoned journalists in their mid-30s from Bulgaria, 
Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania, have come to the 
United States to learn how a free and competitive press works. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to learn to operate a magazine as a business," says Anne Sutherland 
Fuchs, senior vice president and publisher of Elle, who organized the magazine 
industry's role in the internship program. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't been faced with circulation decisions, subscription-pricing 
decisions . . . advertising rates. Everything has been dictated -- whether it's 
the kind of paper they print on or how many copies they print," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a whole different ballgame when it's a free press." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his cubicle at Elle magazine, Peter Janos Sos, 41, leafed through a 
copy of Kepes 7 (Illustrated Week), the Hungarian family weekly of which he is 
deputy editor-in-chief. The first advertisement in the 60-page magazine 
appeared on Page 30; it promoted paving stones. 
</P>
<P>
Then he turned the glossy pages of an issue of Elle filled with ads enticing 
the reader to buy expensive cosmetics, designer clothing, glamorous perfumes 
and chic accessories. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I thought the quality of advertisements is not the job of the editor 
but the job of the advertiser," says Sos, a burly man who chooses his English 
words carefully. "I talked about it with Anne Fuchs and she said, 'I would 
never take the advertisement of X here on the first pages because it's not 
beautiful enough."' 
</P>
<P>
The Eastern European journalists admire the sleek look of their host 
publications, their advertising know-how and technical expertise. Above all, 
they admire the huge sums of money that go into making the magazines. They are 
also fiercely proud of their magazines at home. But this pride goes hand in 
hand with a deep frustration about their financial and technical limitations. 
</P>
<P>
Gyorgyi Kocsis, 36, an intern at Business Week, helped found a weekly economic 
magazine 12 years ago in Budapest, Hungary, that broke new ground in 
up-to-date, critical reporting at a time when most publications were 
mouthpieces for the government. 
</P>
<P>
HVG, the Hungarian initials for World Economy Weekly, became "a very popular 
quality magazine in Hungary," says Kocsis. But in the last two years, she 
added, as new newspapers and magazines hit the market, it lost 15% of its 
readership and suffered an "identity crisis." 
</P>
<P>
She pointed to a recent issue of her magazine on her cluttered desk at Business 
Week. The cover shows pieces of paper representing stock shares coming out of 
factory chimneys. The illustration is in black and white, printed on rough 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our ideas on the cover -- gags, pictures -- can be on any world 
magazine. But I have to look with a looking glass because the printing is so 
awful," says Kocsis. HVG's look suffers badly in comparison to "all the 
beautiful magazines on the newsstand here." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, unable to contain her frustration, she gestures toward her magazine 
and exclaims, "Now, I hate it!"

<P>
But as the Eastern European magazines get slicker and fatter with 
advertisements and censorship becomes a thing of the past, even journalists who 
are ardent supporters of a free-market economy feel a bittersweet twinge as 
their old world collapses. 
</P>
<P>
The "family business" atmosphere at HVG probably will disappear, Kocsis says 
wistfully. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably it will be more professional and big and sort of Westernized. We will 
lose this feeling. We are going to be news factory, which can be good and 
useful and profiting, but probably we will lose this friendly atmosphere, I 
think. But we have to grow up." 
</P>
<P>
Malachowski, interning at Family Circle, recently lost his job as a top editor 
at the Catholic Weekly Review in Warsaw. As the only independent Polish 
newspaper tolerated by the Communist Party, its coverage of politics and social 
issues was very influential, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Catholic Church, trying to cope in a free-market economy and pay its 
bills, has let the weekly become a slim pamphlet on religious affairs, 
Malachowski says. 
</P>
<P>
"We always treated our press as a sort of art piece and now we must start to 
think about this as a sort of product," says Malachowski, whose wire-rimmed 
glasses and tweed jacket reinforce his professorial air. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, he adds, people aren't as interested in art anymore. Poetry, he notes, 
thrived in the 1960s and '70s in Poland when government censorship was 
extremely strict. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that today you have no censorship, but much less people are 
interested in poetry," he says. "A new generation thinks about commercial 
things -- about houses, cars, about normal things as they are in the whole 
Western world. 
</P>
<P>
"The condition of the economy in Poland gives us an absolutely new situation," 
says Malachowski. "The press is (financially) bankrupt. It is difficult to 
survive with magazines and papers. We need to see the average American paper or 
magazine to find out how it works." 
</P>
<P>
American know-how goes a long way. But it doesn't translate directly into hard 
currency. The survival of Eastern European magazines and newspapers also 
depends on Western companies investing in them. HVG, Kepes 7 and Mlady Svet, 
the largest weekly in Czechoslovakia, all have made deals with foreign 
companies or are close to doing so. 
</P>
<P>
Mlady Svet (Young Word) takes three weeks to produce, complains Marek Hlavica, 
28, an editor at the weekly. He also is a singer and harmonica player and is 
spending his internship at Rolling Stone magazine. 
</P>
<P>
If his magazine, founded by the youth group of the Communist Party, is to stay 
ahead of its growing pack of competitors, he says, it needs an infusion of 
money from foreign investors to upgrade its technical capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"The magazine is one stone in the mosaic of the whole society, and it must 
change with those things -- politics, society and so on," Hlavica says. 
</P>
<P>
"But we are optimists. We've got a good starting position. That's very 
important. We've got tradition, good tradition. We've got good writers. We've 
got opportunity to cooperate with foreign companies. So we are optimists. Why 
not?"

PERCUSSION PRODIGY, ORPHANED BY DRUGS, WINS ACCLAIM IN TIMES SQUARE; 
</P>
<P>
STREET SCENE: A STRAY BULLET ROBBED HIM OF HIS MOTHER. A DISCARDED PLASTIC 
BUCKET WAS HIS VEHICLE TO SUCCESS.

<P>
Larry Wright wanted a drum set, but his mother had money only for drugs. So one 
day he took the subway down to Times Square, flipped over a plastic bucket and 
began pounding on it with battered drumsticks. 
</P>
<P>
He hoped for coins, maybe $10 or $20 worth. But as strangers watched this 
sinewy youth play -- sweat pouring from his shirtless torso, tiny bits of wood 
and plastic flying -- they tipped him dollars instead of quarters. 
</P>
<P>
By that day's end, the kid from Harlem, who had never taken a music lesson, had 
made $300. 
</P>
<P>
That was about two years ago. He kept coming back, day after day, playing for 
hours at a time. He played faster and faster, built up calluses and broke 
dozens of buckets. 
</P>
<P>
He had some real breaks: appearances in music videos with Phil Collins, Fine 
Young Cannibals and Jane Child. He also was featured in a short documentary on 
public television. 
</P>
<P>
This summer Wright, now 15, caught the eye of filmmaker Spike Lee, who featured 
him in a Levi's jeans commercial, playing his bucket-drum and meeting his hero, 
drummer Max Roach. 
</P>
<P>
Then in September, at his moment of triumph, the drug scene claimed his 
mother's life. 
</P>
<P>
Police say that Marilyn Wright, 34, was shot during the attempted robbery of a 
drug dealer in her apartment building on West 138th Street. She died in a 
hospital 12 days later. 
</P>
<P>
Police detective John Grenawalt, who interviewed her in the hospital, said no 
one had been arrested in the shooting. He added, incredulously: "To this day, I 
have yet to get a phone call from her family." 
</P>
<P>
The family seems to accept her death as an awful -- but not altogether 
surprising -- consequence of her drug use and the neighborhood. Larry and his 
grandmother, Margaret Cook, still live in the building. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, sitting on a folding metal chair on the sidewalk across from the building 
one day recently when talked about her grandson. She is a slight woman who 
holds her arms close to her as she talks. 
</P>
<P>
Larry gave most of his money to his mother, she said. "As soon as he made it, 
she took it, and it was going to the dope man, might as well tell the truth." 
</P>
<P>
When Larry's father bought him a drum set for Christmas, "Momma took care of 
it," the grandmother said. She chuckled at the absurdity. "I can talk about it. 
I can't hurt her now. She's resting." 
</P>
<P>
"Some rich lady heard him and bought him a real expensive set," she continued. 
"Don't ask what happened to that one." Other relatives and friends sitting with 
her nodded knowingly and joined in the chuckling. 
</P>
<P>
Larry came to his mother's wake with his drumsticks and a bucket. He set them 
down outside the door of the funeral parlor. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't really realize what happened to his mom until he saw her laying down 
in a coffin," said Monte Detioger, 23, who befriended Larry a year ago and now 
is his manager. "When I saw him looking at his mom, he was crying. He was like 
screaming inside." 
</P>
<P>
Drumming came early and easily to Larry. His mother used to say he began 
tapping on things when he was 3 months old; his uncle, Bernard Mercer, said the 
baby always headed straight for Mercer's tambourines. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just crawling, in diapers. He couldn't walk yet, or talk," the uncle 
said. "He'd bang on the TV screen. He'd bang on the wall, on the refrigerator, 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Larry himself remembers tapping on floors when he was 3. Later came table tops, 
garbage pail lids, trees, bottles, cups and, eventually, plastic buckets -- the 
five-gallon size used to package wallboard compound and other products. 
</P>
<P>
It was what he was looking for on a recent day at 46th Street and Broadway. He 
scrounged several buckets from a construction site, knocked out the residue and 
was ready to warm up. 
</P>
<P>
He tapped out various beats on the bottom of the bucket, gradually playing 
faster and louder. He threw in strokes to the side and rim to produce different 
sounds. Using his right foot to rock the open end of the bucket up and down 
against the sidewalk, he created a thumping bass beat. 
</P>
<P>
Many drummers could imitate his rhythms with a little practice, but Larry's 
listeners marveled at his speed and precision. 
</P>
<P>
At the point in his solo where a theater audience might applaud, Larry's street 
fans reached into their pockets. Most approached his bucket slowly and 
respectfully, depositing dollar bills carefully as they would at church. 
</P>
<P>
"He's playing his insides out!" marveled one tourist from Massachusetts. A 
commuter from New Jersey bought a can of Coke and set it down next to the 
sweating Larry. A young woman said she had seen him on television and wanted to 
marry him. Others gave him kisses. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid's a prodigy!" a man from San Francisco said. 
</P>
<P>
Max Roach agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"He's phenomenal. The thing that fascinated me about him was the way he 
sequentially set up his rhythms to create music on that bucket. The way he put 
his accents in, you knew he wasn't just banging. Even though he would switch 
from eighth to 16th to 32nd notes, it was still musical," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roach spotted him coming out of Macy's one day. "There was a crowd around him. 
I heard these rhythms coming out and I stood there with the crowd for about 20 
minutes. I was really impressed. The fact he had the strength that he could do 
this, probably for hours, and he made sense with it. Just that bucket. He's 
very musical." 
</P>
<P>
And he was quite unprepared for success. 
</P>
<P>
His manager regards Wright as a "street kid" with little education or 
understanding of people. 
</P>
<P>
"He tries to be a man, but he's not," Detioger said. "He doesn't know anything 
about life. He's earning $200 a day banging on a bucket in Times Square. He 
said, 'Look, Monte, I don't need to go to school, look at how I do.' " 
</P>
<P>
Since his mother's death, though, Wright has returned to school for the first 
time in two years. He says he is saving his money. His goal, he says, is not to 
play in a band, but to become a star soloist. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm good enough to become a star, I know that," he said. "I'm always playing 
my drums. That's the only thing I think about. I don't let nobody get to me." 
He added: "If I didn't have that talent, I'd probably be locked up somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
In the background is the memory of his mother and her fate. Mercer, his uncle, 
said that for all her troubles, Marilyn Wright forged a special bond with her 
son. She was honest about her drug problem and had warned him to stay clean. 
</P>
<P>
"He's my life," she told an interviewer last year. "He's my whole world." In 
reality, however, her habit was always Larry rival for her attention. 
</P>
<P>
Mercer described the scene at the hospital, after she had been shot: 
</P>
<P>
"As they were getting ready to take her upstairs to her room, she looked at all 
of us and said, 'Take care of my son.' Then she started crying with this real 
cry, like I never . . . like she used to cry when she was a little girl."

U.S. SOLAR CAR SLOWLY GETS UP TO SPEED; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: THE VEHICLE IS SMALL AND UNCOMFORTABLE, BUT IT IS A NATIONAL CHAMPION 
IN ITS CATEGORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

BROOKLYN, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today's state-of-the-art solar car resembles a waist-high, bright yellow 
tadpole that is 20 feet long. Getting in without breaking it is an adventure, 
and only one person will fit. 
</P>
<P>
Taking such a vehicle home from the showroom isn't likely to be possible soon. 
The price comes to about $650,000, without $350,000 worth of computers and 
other ancillary equipment. 
</P>
<P>
But the University of Michigan's Sunrunner has one thing going for it: It's a 
national champion in solar speed, and it's headed for an international test on 
the roadways of Australia next month. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the Sunrunner and 31 other solar-powered cars built by student teams 
raced from Disney World in central Florida to General Motors Corp.'s Technical 
Center in the Detroit suburb of Warren. The Sunrunner, traveling by day only, 
won the 1,641-mile race in 72 hours, 50 minutes and 47 seconds. Its average 
speed was 22.5 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
GM is entering the Sunrunner and other top finishers in the 1990 World Solar 
Challenge. In all, 43 cars from 10 countries will compete in the 1,863-mile 
race race from Darwin, on Australia's northern coast, to Adelaide on the south 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
For the race, which starts Nov. 11, the Sunrunner team hopes to attain an 
average speed of 32 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
To take the car out for a test drive at the Michigan International Speedway 
recently, industrial engineer Paula Finnegan had to buckle on a safety harness 
and have a colleague boost her up into the open top of the car. Inside, she 
balanced on the aluminum-tubing skeleton and a hammock-like seat slung in the 
frame. 
</P>
<P>
She then threaded her legs through the jungle-gym-like tubing to reach the 
accelerator and brake pedals, reclined in the seat, buckled on safety straps 
and donned a headset with microphone. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunrunner still wasn't ready. Three people then gingerly lifted its floppy 
plastic canopy from the ground, lowered it over Finnegan and sealed it in place 
with bright yellow tape. 
</P>
<P>
During test laps on a mostly sunny day with thin, high clouds, the car reached 
23 m.p.h. To go faster or to climb, the Sunrunner's circuitry draws power from 
a battery. At slower speeds or going downhill, it stores excess power from the 
solar cells back into the batteries. 
</P>
<P>
In bright sunlight, the solar cells produce about 1,200 watts, enough to power 
a toaster oven, hair dryer, or the 500-pound Sunrunner. Cloudy weather can cut 
the power to 300 to 400 watts, enough for a bright light bulb. 
</P>
<P>
A 1.5-horsepower. electric motor the size of a coffee can powers the car via 
chain drive on one of the 26-inch mountain-bike wheels. 
</P>
<P>
There's a slot through which to view the road ahead and a rear-facing, 
fiber-optic viewer that allows the driver to get an idea of what's behind. 
</P>
<P>
Two ports in the front of the cockpit bring in fresh air. "The drivers said it 
wasn't too bad as long as they kept moving," said Mike McAlear, strategist for 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
For now, electric cars will have to rely on batteries. Solar cells and motors 
must be made more efficient before energy straight from sunlight will be able 
to propel a car faster than 30 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Solar cars, therefore, aren't on the verge of becoming a practical alternative 
for commuting, Finnegan said. 
</P>
<P>
"Not any time in the near future -- but with improved technology, it can 
happen."

ORTHODOX POLES VISIT SHRINE DESPITE DESTRUCTIVE FIRE

GRABARKA, Poland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orthodox worshipers climbed the Holy Mountain this summer in their annual 
pilgrimage, but the wooden chapel that greeted the faithful for nearly three 
centuries was gone, burned to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny chapel and its priceless icons were destroyed July 12. A month later, 
the joy of the annual pilgrimage to Grabarka was cloaked with grief and 
suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
A convict on a five-day leave from prison was charged with setting the fire 
because he could not break into the chapel to steal a gold cross. 
</P>
<P>
Priests and their followers are troubled not only by the destruction of the 
Orthodox faith's holiest shrine in Poland, but by fear that the motivation was 
darker than robbery. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a blow at the heart of Orthodoxy . . . aimed to destroy us," said one 
priest, who would not give his name. "Most people think the only religion in 
Poland should be Catholic." 
</P>
<P>
There have been several attacks on Orthodox churches in Poland, a nation of 38 
million people that is 93% Roman Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary's was the sixth Orthodox church burned in five years, the government 
newspaper Rzeczpospolita reported. 
</P>
<P>
Keston College, a British organization that monitors religious freedom, also 
has expressed concern about attacks on Orthodox institutions in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Orthodoxy holds many tenets similar to Roman Catholicism, but rejects the 
primacy of the Pope. It is Poland's largest religious minority, with an 
estimated 800,000 followers, many of them ethnic Byelorussians from the eastern 
provinces. 
</P>
<P>
During the three-day Orthodox pilgrimage, up to 60,000 people climbed to this 
village 75 miles west of Warsaw and 15 from the Soviet border. 
</P>
<P>
The spring-fed waters of the Holy Mountain, in reality a small hill, are 
supposed to have cured a prophet's followers of plague in 1710. 
</P>
<P>
Pilgrims, some climbing on their knees, carried wooden crosses to be planted on 
the hilltop amid the thousands of weathered, moss-covered offerings of previous 
years, many of which were charred by the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a special year, one when we are all living through this great loss," 
said Eugeniusz Zabrodski, a priest from nearby Drohiczyn. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the burned wood, and the altar where I used to say Divine Liturgy, 
I could only wonder how anyone could do this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Aug. 19, the observances culminated in the consecration of the 
cornerstone of a new church. 
</P>
<P>
Collection boxes for the building fund dotted the hill. Donations from around 
the world totaled $8,420 and the Polish Senate, which condemned the arson, 
contributed $5,260. 
</P>
<P>
There is controversy about what kind of church to build. 
</P>
<P>
"Some think it should be wood just like it was, but others want to take 
advantage of the opportunity and build something much larger," Zabrodski said. 
</P>
<P>
For now, services are conducted at a makeshift wooden altar dwarfed by towering 
pines with singed branches. 
</P>
<P>
The happy chatter of pilgrims washing in the waters below reached the hushed 
reverence of the shrine. Elderly women, their heads covered by scarfs in the 
Orthodox tradition, circled the altar on their knees. 
</P>
<P>
Many faithful spent the night kneeling in prayer. The Divine Liturgy, in Old 
Church Slavonic, was conducted virtually without cease from 6 p.m. Saturday 
until Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Poland's Orthodox Church is independent of Russian Orthodoxy, to which it lost 
an estimated 4.5 million followers after World War II, when the Soviet Union 
annexed eastern Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Both churches descend from the Orthodox faith that developed in Constantinople 
after the Great Schism of 1054. 
</P>
<P>
At Grabarka, worshipers and clergy communicated in a polyglot of Polish, 
Russian, Byelorussian and Slovak, reflecting the mix of peoples who feel the 
tug of the shrine year after year. 
</P>
<P>
"We came here to get our strength, because this is where the Orthodox are," 
said Ania, a 20-year-old law student from Bialystok.

INFLATION SURGES 1.6% IN MONTH; GAS PRICE SOARS

<P>
Wholesale prices soared 1.6% in Sept- 
</P>
<P>
ember -- an annual rate of more than 20% -- as gasoline prices shot up at their 
fastest pace on record, the government reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The oil shock is hitting with a vengeance. . . . It's just one more jolt to an 
already fragile economy," said Robert Dederick, chief economist at the Northern 
Trust Co. of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the start of the wave of double-digit inflation we will have to suffer 
through for the next quarter or two because of Iraq," said Allen Sinai, chief 
economist at the Boston Co. "It's going to propel an economy that's already in 
recession into a deeper recession." 
</P>
<P>
While the Labor Department blamed much of the steep increase in wholesale costs 
one step short of the retail level on costlier petroleum, prices excluding the 
volatile energy and food areas were still up a worrisome 0.6% -- twice the 
August gain. 
</P>
<P>
The 20.6% rise in the cost of gasoline was the highest one-month increase since 
the government began tracking the commodity in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
At the earliest stage of the production process, crude oil prices rose 20.4%, 
fueling analysts' concern that the higher prices will begin affecting the 
thousands of plastic, chemical and other products made with petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
Oil also shows up in utility costs and figures in prices for products that must 
be transported long distances. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said retail sales jumped 1.1% 
last month, to a seasonally adjusted $151.2 billion, and were bolstered by the 
soaring cost of gasoline and a partial recovery in auto sales. Excluding 
gasoline, sales rose 0.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the combination of higher prices and stronger consumer spending 
deepens the dilemma for the Federal Reserve, which has been under pressure from 
the Bush Administration to ease its inflation-fighting campaign and lower 
interest rates to spur the economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
It's late afternoon and President Bush is in a jam. So he turns to one of his 
most trusted advisers. "What do you think, Kenny?" he asks. "Is it going to 
break?" 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Raynor leans over and sizes up the problem. "No," he says. "Straight on." 
Bush nods and faces the challenge -- a 30-foot putt up a slight incline. He 
strokes the ball directly toward the hole but it stops inches short. 
</P>
<P>
"Ahhhhh!" Bush groans. 
</P>
<P>
"Nice shot, partner!" Raynor exclaims. 
</P>
<P>
With a thunderous drive, a zeal for life and a soft-spoken way of delivering 
plenty of advice, banter and encouragement -- Kenny Raynor, 38, is the 
President's golf pro. 
</P>
<P>
"I help the President with his R and R (rest and relaxation). He's a very good 
golfer, a competitor, but we're primarily out here to have good time. Enjoy the 
camaraderie. Share a few laughs. That's the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
Raynor plays a few dozen rounds of golf a year with Bush, nearly always at the 
Cape Arundel Golf Club in Kennebunkport, Me., a few miles from the Bush 
family's summer home. Raynor has been the club's pro since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly every time Bush goes to Kennebunkport -- which is almost monthly in the 
spring, summer and fall -- Raynor is among the first people he calls. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I hear from him while he is on Air Force One, heading up here," 
Raynor said. "He's checking in, shifting gears." 
</P>
<P>
Take one presidential day last August. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a briefing at the Pentagon, gave a speech to the military, flew up 
here, jumped out of his helicopter, ran up to the first tee and knocked the 
ball right down the middle of the fairway." 
</P>
<P>
"Not many people can do that." 
</P>
<P>
What else amazes Raynor about Bush on the links? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, the President of the United States has the same passion all golfers do 
-- finding a lost ball. He can't leave a ball that is visible along the river 
bank." 
</P>
<P>
"He'll climb right down there, get it, and say, 'Hey, look at this! Free ammo!' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Raynor says that Bush, 66, shoots in the middle to high 80s, but that the 
hallmark of his game is speed -- a style of playing affectionately dubbed 
"Bush's aerobic golf." Some call it "polo golf." 
</P>
<P>
The President, who drives his own golf cart, regularly completes a round in 
less than 2 hours. This summer, playing with his oldest son, George W., and 
Raynor, he set a personal record -- one hour and 42 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's a little fast," said Raynor. "Obviously, I would never promote 
that to America." 
</P>
<P>
On the course, Bush is a kibitzer, constantly challenging opponents and 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll say something like, 'Here we are on the 18th hole at Pebble Beach' or 
'This one is for (wife) Bar,' and then hit a perfect drive or dribble it 20 
feet." 
</P>
<P>
On this day, Raynor is seated on the wooden porch of the rustic clubhouse, 
overlooking the Kennebunk River where he and Bush have enjoyed countless hours 
of fishing. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the hardest things in the world out here is to remember he is the 
President of the United States," said Raynor. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"Because he's such a regular guy. So much warmth. Personality. He says hello to 
everyone. Signs score cards." 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be playing and suddenly, in the middle of the ninth hole, he'll stop to 
take a call (on his cellular phone) on some matter, and then just as quickly 
return to the game." 
</P>
<P>
Bush took some heat this summer for golfing almost every day of a 25-day 
vacation in Maine while, halfway around the world, U.S. troops dug in in the 
Middle East. Critics said it didn't look right. They complained that he should 
have spent the time focusing his energy on the crisis in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it bothered him a little bit. Because he does care. He is a dedicated 
person," said Raynor. "He was just taking a little R and R on what turned out 
to be a working vacation." 
</P>
<P>
Raynor said he rarely discusses the rigors of the presidency with Bush. "But 
this bothered me, too, seeing him receive such criticism. I told him that the 
American people were behind him." 
</P>
<P>
The golf pro is a big fan of the President. 
</P>
<P>
"He treats me like an adopted son. We have a very special relationship." But 
Raynor never calls him "George" and only rarely "Mr. President." 
</P>
<P>
"I normally call him 'Mr. Bush.' On the course, in the heat of battle, I might 
call him 'partner.' " 
</P>
<P>
Raynor gives an upbeat assessment of Bush's game, putting him at between a 12 
and 13 handicap. He says the best part of his game is the drive and fairway 
woods. "He can hit it as far as anyone, 240 to 250 yards." 
</P>
<P>
Since Bush's rise to the White House, the club has sold "presidential" golf 
balls and shirts, all bearing the emblem of an eagle. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my way of celebrating that we have the President as a member here," 
said Raynor. "But I don't want to exceed bounds. I don't want to have a 'George 
Bush' pro shop." 
</P>
<P>
What Raynor really enjoys is watching Bush swing a club. "He's a great 
ambassador to the game. It's great for the game to see a golfing President."

SMITH LACKS KNOCKOUT ISSUE IN BATTLE WITH LUNGREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whoever coined the phrase "lightning never strikes twice" apparently never met 
Democratic state attorney general candidate Arlo Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven years ago, Smith, a little-known administrator in the attorney general's 
office, was elected district attorney of San Francisco after a rough-and-tumble 
campaign in which he relentlessly attacked a well-known incumbent over the 
botched prosecution of mayoral assassin Dan White. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Smith rode the reverberations of the unsuccessful McMartin child 
molestation case to victory in the Democratic attorney general primary, coming 
out of obscurity to defeat nationally known Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira 
Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, Smith will have to make it on his own. No longer an underdog and 
without an overwhelming media-grabbing issue, Smith, 62, is facing an 
aggressive Republican general election foe, former Rep. Dan Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
"Smith knows how to run one type of campaign and it's been successful for him 
twice," said San Francisco political consultant Sam Singer, who managed 
Reiner's campaign. "But now he's running against a candidate that doesn't fit 
that profile." 
</P>
<P>
Smith is seeking to meet the challenge by hammering away at his conservative 
opponent's congressional voting record. Lungren, he points out, has 
consistently sought to curb abortion rights and voted against most 
environmental protection funding bills during his five-term tenure that ended 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"This race is different than other campaigns Arlo has been in," conceded Marc 
Dann, Smith's campaign manager. "But it's the kind of campaign that's the 
candidate's dream. You always say you want to run on the issues. The beauty of 
this race is that we literally win on the issues." 
</P>
<P>
A mediocre public speaker but a tireless campaigner, Smith is frenetically 
racing across the state, holding frequent press conferences from Sacramento to 
San Diego in which he employs a dizzying array of gimmicks to draw optimum TV 
news coverage. To highlight Lungren's lack of prosecutorial experience, he 
recently met reporters in the office of a legal placement firm, stamping a 
poster-sized Lungren resume "Rejected." That effort almost backfired when Smith 
nearly stamped his own resume by mistake before campaign staffers frantically 
yelled a warning. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco prosecutor is receiving help from labor, ethnic, 
environmental and women's groups that opposed Lungren's unsuccessful nomination 
to the post of state treasurer in 1988. Last week, Smith was endorsed by the 
state's leading environmental protection organizations, whose leaders termed 
Lungren an anti-environmental extremist. Smith also was strongly endorsed by 
once-bitter foe Reiner. "Arlo Smith will argue that (restrictions on abortion 
rights) are constitutionally impermissible and Dan Lungren will not," Reiner 
said at a $500-a-plate campaign dinner. With the November vote nearing and the 
two candidates neck and neck in the polls, the jury is out on the effectiveness 
of Smith's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, it remains to be seen whether social issues are of prime concern 
to voters for a job widely viewed as the state's top law enforcement post. 
</P>
<P>
"People expect the attorney general to fight crime," said Sal Russo, a 
Republican campaign consultant based in Sacramento. "Intellectually, they know 
(the attorney general) does a lot of things. But in their gut they want a crime 
fighter." 
</P>
<P>
Lungren, insisting that drugs and violence are the key issues, has stressed a 
hard-line, anti-crime image, highlighting the key role he played in passage of 
tough federal crime-fighting legislation during the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Smith has countered by comparing resumes. Emphasizing that Lungren has never 
prosecuted a criminal case, Smith has pointed to his 36 years as a district 
attorney and deputy attorney general, including a stint as chief of its 
criminal division. 
</P>
<P>
There also is the question of whether the public is paying attention to the 
upcoming vote. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Los Angeles Times poll showed that only half the voters had made up 
their minds on Lungren or Smith. Another poll indicated that fewer than 4 in 10 
registered voters across the state could identify the two candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Without the hot news value of a McMartin trial that dominated the primary 
campaign, newspapers and TV news broadcasts have been providing limited 
coverage. Smith, who squared off against Lungren in several moderator-free 
debates before the June Democratic primary, has refused to participate in 
similar encounters this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren claims that Smith, who has agreed only to three joint appearances on 
30-minute TV news conference broadcasts, is afraid to debate in an uncontrolled 
format. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's toughest problem, perhaps, is that for the first time in his political 
career, he faces an opponent who is not underestimating his chances. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Smith shocked overconfident San Francisco prosecutor Joe Freitas by 
attacking his prosecution of White, who received less than eight years in 
prison for killing Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk. Smith faced 
no opposition in his two subsequent local reelection bids. 
</P>
<P>
In the Democratic primary for attorney general, Reiner generally ignored Smith 
in the hope of depriving him of a statewide forum. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner's strategy short-circuited because of the deluge of negative publicity 
he received in connection with the McMartin trial. While the Los Angeles 
prosecutor made few public appearances, the peripatetic Smith hustled around 
the state, portraying himself as an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"Arlo has always done his best when he had some particular case or situation 
when he can show a major flaw in his opponent," said Joe Shumate, a Republican 
campaign consultant based in San Francisco. "Arlo is a 100% tough campaigner 
and you just can't take him lightly." 
</P>
<P>
Lungren has not. Seeking to place Smith on the defensive, he repeatedly cites 
state statistics showing that Smith's office prosecuted just under 50% of the 
felony arrests in San Francisco in 1988. Smith has called the statistics 
misleading. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren also has publicized letters from Smith's boss during the early 1980s, 
then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein, questioning Smith's performance as district 
attorney. Feinstein, now running for governor as a Democrat, has responded by 
praising Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren's first TV campaign ad questioned Smith's crime-fighting prowess in the 
prosecution of influential San Francisco businessman Donald Werby, a onetime 
Smith campaign contributor. Smith, citing problems with the evidence, recently 
accepted a misdemeanor plea bargain from Werby on sex and drug charges 
involving teen-age prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in politics since I was 6 and I've seen lots of races where people 
did not take their opponent seriously until the day after the vote -- when it 
was too late," said Lungren, 44. "There are weaknesses in his record, to be 
sure. Obviously, we're going to point those out." 
</P>
<P>
Smith has reacted by stressing his experience and by trying to out-tough 
Lungren on certain crime issues. After Lungren called for life sentences for 
criminals convicted of kidnaping for the purpose of rape, Smith announced his 
support for the death penalty in rape and kidnaping cases where victims suffer 
great physical harm. Smith also has called for mandatory incarceration in 
first-time convictions of drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say the outcome of the Smith-Lungren race could hinge on the success of 
their TV ad campaigns. At this point, it is unclear just how much money either 
candidate will raise for his final push. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign finance reports filed Oct. 5 showed that Smith had $299,000 while 
Lungren had $106,000, having spent more than $200,000 on his first two TV ads. 
</P>
<P>
With a federal court recently declaring unconstitutional the fund-raising 
limits established by Proposition 73, Smith and Lungren have the opportunity to 
add considerably to their war chests. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren's ads have appeared to had limited impact in the polls. In fact, the 
Werby attack ad generated a backlash of negative editorials. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is expected to wait until the final days of the campaign to launch a 
statewide TV ad blitz. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply have to lay out the case on abortion, environment and job 
qualifications," said Dann, Smith's campaign manager. "The electorate is tired 
of mudslinging. . . . But if he attacks us, we're not going to get our face 
kicked in. We're not going to take it."

AGRICULTURE: AN IRVINE FARMER IS SPEARHEADING AN EFFORT TO GLEAN FIELDS, 
SALVAGING CROPS FOR THE COUNTY'S DESTITUTE. HE INSISTS THAT THERE IS PLENTY TO 
GO AROUND.

<TEXT>
<P>
Stand in A.G. Kawamura's fog-shrouded bean fields and take in the pungency of 
fresh greenery and warm earth and it is easy to believe you are on a farm patch 
in the Central Valley rather than in suburban Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The young farmer will accept this description as an anomaly or a last vestige 
of a more rural past, but he also believes that his 600 acres of agricultural 
fields, much of them bordered by encroaching business and housing developments, 
may hold the key to solving a social ill of the county's increasing 
urbanization. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the farm community has just recently begun to be very supportive in 
realizing that (we) have to take a part in alleviating hunger," said Kawamura. 
He said he gained a sense of social responsibility as well as business acumen 
as a student at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Hunger and malnutrition hound the homeless and working poor in Orange County 
and fall especially hard on children, according to recent studies. 
</P>
<P>
While local social planners grapple with finding solutions to the broader 
societal problem, others, such as Kawamura, see a more practical approach: 
Salvage crops from the county's agricultural producers to directly feed the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
Gleaning, as such salvage is known, has been around locally for years. But a 
new task force of activists and producers is attempting to develop the most 
ambitious program to date, working on the theory that Orange County's once 
abundant fields have much to yield. 
</P>
<P>
"By and large, people are not aware of the agricultural resources in the 
county," said Kawamura, who estimates that scarcely 1% of available produce is 
salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
To reap more benefits from the county's resources, Kawamura is working with the 
Irvine Gleaning Project to enlist more agricultural producers. 
</P>
<P>
The gleaning project is an outgrowth of earlier efforts to increase the amount 
of fresh produce donated to local food banks, coordinator Charlene Turco said. 
The group is forming a nonprofit foundation and has been awarded a $5,600 grant 
from the city of Irvine. Turco hopes that with funds from other Orange County 
cities and federal and state grants, he can expand the project's volunteer 
base. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying for the first time to coordinate efforts and to include everyone 
from growers to service providers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Turco talks of having a food hot line, which residents or businesses with 
donations of food could call for pickup. She also hopes to develop an offshoot 
of the gleaning project that will travel to private homes to salvage surplus 
zucchini and tomatoes straight from the garden. 
</P>
<P>
While no one disputes the critical need for fresh produce to supplement the 
diets of those at risk of missing meals, what no one can say for sure is how 
effective an expanded gleaning program would be in alleviating the hunger 
problem in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends to what extent you are increasing the capacity of food providers," 
said Michele Van Eyken, nutrition services supervisor for the county. "If we 
can get over the problems of distribution and the way people utilize food, then 
(gleaning) could make a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Cotter, a home economist with the local branch of UC Cooperative Extension, 
noted that many needy residents, particularly Latinos, may be unaccustomed to 
eating some fruits and vegetables common in the United States and might let the 
produce waste. 
</P>
<P>
"Even with low-income families that have been here for generations, making food 
changes does not come overnight," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The expense of fresh produce poses the greatest barrier. A recent survey 
conducted by UC researchers noted that although the need for emergency food 
assistance has increased, resources have decreased. 
</P>
<P>
Cutbacks in government surplus commodities have resulted in a halving of the 
number of Orange County households able to participate in the program. Foods 
such as cheese, powdered milk and rice are no longer available. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, donations to the county's two food banks are down 25% in recent 
years. Mark Lowry, manager of the Community Development Council's food bank, 
said his program is continually in need of fresh produce. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very hard to provide a well-balanced diet for people because we are at 
the whims and wills of what is donated to us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The food bank has recently sought help outside the county, working with a 
Fresno group that has shipped down more than 40,000 pounds of cantaloupes, 
peaches, nectarines and plums. The first 20,000-pound shipment was gone in 
three days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kawamura and others believe that if only 10% of available produce items were 
salvaged, Orange County farmers could provide for local needs and export 
produce to the needy in other counties. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Sullivan, resource director for the county's second major food bank, the 
Food Distribution Center, said local gleaning projects have provided more than 
118,000 pounds of fresh vegetables since last October. 
</P>
<P>
"If you calculate that one-half pound of food is equal to a meal, in human 
terms it means more than 236,000 meals for the county's needy," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine gleaning project has enlisted support from four Irvine farms: 
Kawamura's Western Marketing Co., Murai Farms, Treasure Farms and John Magarro 
Farms. Another gleaning project, Sunshine Outreach, founded in 1983, also picks 
over several south Orange County farms. 
</P>
<P>
Kawamura says the salvage potential is vast and largely untapped. In spite of 
seemingly endless development, the county has about 57,000 acres of 
agricultural land, according to the Orange County Farm Bureau, nearly 8,000 of 
them in orchards. 
</P>
<P>
Although nursery stock accounted for more than half of the county's $250 
million in agricultural earnings last year, crops such as strawberries, beans 
and peppers are also big income producers. The county has more than 300 
individual farms, according to Farm Bureau executive director Nanci Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
She said farmers are increasingly aware that their role is vital in feeding the 
hungry. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be agriculture that's going to solve the problem," Jimenez said. 
Kawamura, a member of the Farm Bureau, recently made a presentation to the 
group, and the board of directors probably will back expanded gleaning efforts 
in the county, Jimenez said. 
</P>
<P>
Kawamura said easing of liability laws has led many farmers to be more 
receptive to having mostly novice volunteers tramp through their fields. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious obstacle is timing, he said. Sometimes there is not even a 
day's break between harvest of one crop and preparations for planting another 
-- and farm operations will always come first, he concedes. 
</P>
<P>
Of his 600 leased acres of corn, cabbage, celery, bean and squash, about 400 
acres lend themselves to salvage, Kawamura said. 
</P>
<P>
Kawamura's love for the land runs deep. He said his family is the oldest active 
tenant on Irvine Ranch property, its farms dating to 1958. He is equally 
committed to easing the plight of the county's growing ranks of hungry and 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"To grow up in Orange County with the wealth that we have, it's really no 
excuse . . . to have the kinds of problems we have," he said.

ENVIRONMENTALLY ILL CRY FOR MEDICAL RECOGNITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM KRATTENMAKER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TRENTON, N. J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A whiff of perfume or a breeze from a neighbor's lawn can leave chemically 
sensitive people speechless. And they are becoming increasingly vocal about it. 
</P>
<P>
They complain that they get sick from everyday exposure to common chemicals in 
the home, office and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Chemical sensitivity can cause headaches, respiratory discomfort and a 
paralyzing disorientation that can render one incapable of speaking. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics in the insurance, medical and chemical industries are not convinced 
that such miseries are real. Acute sensitivity to common chemicals has yet to 
win medical recognition or the insurance coverage that would come with it. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some scientists insist that society is now seeing the first casualties of 
the modern-day proliferation of chemicals. From the end of World War II until 
1988, annual production of synthetic organic chemicals in the United States 
jumped from less than 1 billion pounds to 273 billion pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"(Sensitive people) may indeed be the canaries," said Claudia Miller, a 
University of Texas Health Science Center allergist and immunologist who 
participated in a study for the state of New Jersey, which is second only to 
Texas in the production of chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't understand the mechanisms," Miller said. "It may be neurological or 
immunological. It may be biochemical." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the mechanism, the effects can be dramatic, say experts and those who 
suffer from chemical sensitivity, also known as environmental illness. 
</P>
<P>
Illness often begins from a single exposure -- after installation of new 
carpeting in the office or a leak from a sewage plant -- that seems to leave 
one permanently hypersensitive, sufferers say. 
</P>
<P>
What follows is a bewildering array of symptoms and the quest for diagnosis and 
treatment. Patients must try to avoid contact with any pesticide, plastic or 
building material that they fear will trigger an episode. 
</P>
<P>
Some get breathing relief with Adrenalin, but drugs are often useless because 
many sufferers also react to pharmaceutics. 
</P>
<P>
The number of people severely affected is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
According to the New Jersey report, the National Academy of Sciences suggested 
that about 15% of the population has heightened sensitivity to chemicals, 
though not all such people have intense symptoms. A spokeswoman for the academy 
said, however, that 15% was an off-the-cuff estimate and should not have been 
quoted in the report. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the medical Establishment remains dubious. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll Brodsky, a psychiatrist with UC San Francisco who has written 
extensively on the subject, said it is likely a psychological disability. 
</P>
<P>
"If you believe you couldn't walk outside or walk anywhere where there were 
exhaust fumes, you would be disabled. If that is the issue, have I seen people 
like this who are disabled? Certainly," Brodsky said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, whether they have anything wrong with them physically is quite another 
matter. . . . If physical doctors can't find anything physically wrong with 
them, it must be within the realm of the psyche." 
</P>
<P>
Reputable, neutral organizations have given at least some credence to a 
physical basis of the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in a report to Congress on indoor air 
pollution, urged further research of chemical sensitivity. The Congressional 
Research Service has called it one of the consequences of poor indoor air 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
And the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has ruled that people 
with environmental illness who live in subsidized housing cannot be forced to 
have chemical extermination of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Some doubters say that malingering employees are looking for workers' 
compensation benefits. They also suspect a subconscious fear of workplace 
pressures and fearful reaction to news reports about chemical hazards. 
</P>
<P>
Clinical ecologists, the doctors who specialize in chemical sensitivity, also 
have met with skepticism. Allergists in conventional practice, for example, 
have urged the Health Care Financing Administration to deny reimbursement for 
clinical ecologists' work. 
</P>
<P>
But Miller and Nicholas Ashford of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
the other author of the New Jersey report, say that the psychological 
explanation ignores the stunning similarity of the symptoms and exposure 
problems being reported. 
</P>

"They're all so diverse, yet they're all coming up with the same thing. Is it 
all psychological when everyone is coming up with the same symptoms?" Miller 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
She and Ashford both said that further research is needed. 
</P>
<P>
One of dozens of proposals made to federal and state governments is 
establishment of an "environmental unit," a contaminant-free chamber for 
testing an individual's sensitivity to various common chemicals one at a time. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey health officials have not said what recommendation, if any, they 
will follow. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the scientists have identified four groups who are most prone to be 
hypersensitive. They are industrial workers, people who work in well insulated 
and poorly ventilated offices, residents of contaminated communities and people 
who are exposed to chemicals in the household. 
</P>
<P>
"(Hypersensitivity) is widespread in nature and is not limited to what some 
observers would describe as malingering workers, hysterical housewives and 
workers experiencing mass psychogenic illness," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who believe the malady is a physical illness say the skeptics are afraid 
to admit that people could be getting sick from living in a chemical-laden 
world, because it would bode ill for a huge industry. 
</P>
<P>
It might mean buildings with better ventilation, a less-than-perfect lawn or 
scrubbing the toilet with plain baking soda. 
</P>
<P>
And, one industry briefing warned, formal recognition of chemical sensitivity 
as an illness could result in a spate of lawsuits and insurance obligations. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary impact on society would be the huge cost associated with the 
legitimization of environmental illness," the Chemical Manufacturers Assn. 
report continued. 
</P>
<P>
"It would mean we had a new and very different problem to deal with," said 
Gordon Strickland, a vice president of the chemicals lobby, "(but) we have 
looked through the data and looked through the arguments . . . and found 
nothing supportive" of a physical explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Lamielle of Voorhees, N.J., who suffers from chemical sensitivity and is 
heading a nationwide effort to have the condition recognized, said that 
economics, rather than science, is behind all the skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
It was at Lamielle's urging that state Sen. Lee Laskin persuaded New Jersey 
public health officials to commission the study of chemical exposure problems.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: ULTIMATELY, OSTRICH VOTING GAVE US THE BUDGET CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON, LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON is professor of economics at UC 
Berkeley and research director of the Berkeley Roundtable on the International 
Economy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who is more to blame for the current budgetary catastrophe? Is it the President 
and his aides? For months they arrogantly refused to concede the need for new 
revenues, despite mounting deficit projections. And they stymied the 
negotiation process until the 11th hour by their adamant insistence on a 
capital gains tax cut whose benefits they misjudged and misrepresented. Or is 
it perhaps the Congress? For years, the members of Congress have shunned 
significant spending cuts in popular programs that could not be soundly 
financed on the existing revenue base. 
</P>
<P>
The question of apportioning blame between the President and Congress for the 
nation's budget fiasco seems hotter than the question of who will win the World 
Series. However the blame is finally shared, neither institution of government 
will escape censure. Unlike the World Series, there will be no clear-cut winner 
in the nation's high-stakes budget crisis -- only losers. 
</P>
<P>
The American public is fed up with the President and the Congress. How could a 
great country whose young people stand exposed in the Saudi desert to defend 
the rights of others fail to solve its own budgetary crisis? Haven't the people 
been let down by their elected officials? Don't they deserve better? 
</P>
<P>
But these questions fail to come to grips with a fundamental reality: The 
budgetary antics of Congress and the Administration are directed by public 
opinion. The deal proposed by the budget summit didn't hold for one simple 
reason: The people raised their voices against it. By an overwhelming margin, 
Americans told the Administration and the Congress that the budget proposal was 
unacceptable. And responsive, democratically elected officials reacted to their 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Seen in this light, the defeat of the proposal can be considered a great 
victory for American democracy. But it was a hollow victory, revealing profound 
weaknesses in the contemporary American polity. A well-functioning democracy 
depends on enlightened self-interest, on an informed electorate occasionally 
willing to understand the need to make tough choices and capable of making 
private sacrifices for the collective good. The American electorate does not 
appear to fit the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The message sent to government officials by those Americans who bothered to 
vote in the elections of the past decade was clear: 
</P>
<P>
Don't disturb us with the facts. Either we cannot understand them or we don't 
want to try. Entertain us with nasty commercials and 60-second sound bites. 
Throw in sex scandals. Wrap yourself up in the flag, but don't ask us to reduce 
our consumption to support the ideals on which the nation was built. Assure us 
you'll keep Willy Horton off the street but don't spend our money to educate 
the young children most likely to become the Willy Hortons of the next 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
Pander to our greed. Tell us that if each of us just gets as rich as possible, 
we'll be making a great social contribution. Reassure us that those who fail do 
so because they are undeserving, not because the country has failed to provide 
them with the educational and family support systems necessary to economic 
success. 
</P>
<P>
Charm us. Reassure us. Entertain us. Don't give us boring analyses of the 
budget and trade deficits; most of us can't tell one from the other anyway. And 
whatever you do, don't give us any bad news. At best, we simply won't pay 
attention. At worst, if you make us feel bad enough, we'll hold you responsible 
for our difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the voters read Bush's lips even though there was overwhelming 
evidence that the federal deficit would not disappear by itself. Anyone who 
bothered to look at this evidence -- and precious few did -- could see that 
significant real cuts in spending and significant real increases in taxes were 
required to restore budgetary sanity. 
</P>
<P>
But the T-word was banned from political discourse. And Bush, who pretended 
that there was no budgetary problem, was rewarded with an overwhelming victory. 
(His opponent, to be fair, was only marginally more candid; the problem is 
general and pervasive.) 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Bush's most irresponsible behavior then was his mockery of the National 
Economic Commission, a nonpartisan panel of experts established by Congress to 
come up with an effective and equitable budget-reduction plan. If the newly 
elected President had informed the American people that the nation faced a 
budgetary crisis and that the recommendations of an expert commission were 
needed to solve it, we might have been able to act when the economy was strong. 
</P>
<P>
In a booming economy, the pain of austerity would have been less severe. 
Instead, the bill is coming due at the worst time, when the economy is sliding 
into a recession that can only be aggravated by spending cuts and tax 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the President's decision to postpone the day of reckoning reflected 
the public's mood. Ostrich politics by America's elected officials is the 
mirror image of ostrich voting by the American electorate. If the nation is to 
restore sanity to the budget and the budget process -- and do so in ways that 
address the economic and social ills that threaten living standards -- the 
American electorate must stare some harsh economic realities squarely in the 
face: 
</P>
<P>
We are not overtaxed. Quite the reverse. The United States ranks at the bottom 
of the advanced industrial countries in terms of its overall tax burden. We 
cannot afford to fund Medicare, Social Security and other spending programs 
that serve the middle class; run a competent and efficient government; fight 
drugs, AIDS and crime; build a modern infrastructure; support a first-rate 
military, and offer a minimum of support to the disadvantaged without 
significantly higher revenues. The numbers simply do not add up. It is childish 
and irresponsible for American voters to insist on their favorite programs 
without providing the necessary revenues to finance them. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the nation has been living beyond its means for more than a decade. Now 
we have to pay at least part of the bill -- some belt-tightening is the 
unavoidable result of high living in the high-rolling 1980s. If we try to duck 
the problem, it will only get bigger. Each dollar of deficit spending today 
represents more than a dollar of debt repayment tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Third, the budgetary decisions of the 1980s disproportionately benefited the 
wealthy. Spending programs for the disadvantaged and tax burdens for the 
wealthy were slashed in real terms. Even Republican pundits concede that the 
gap between the rich and poor has widened. Not surprisingly, polls show that 
the overwhelming majority of Americans believe that the wealthy bear a 
disproportionate share of austerity. 
</P>
<P>
But given the magnitude of the nation's budgetary shortfall, higher taxes on 
the wealthy -- although warranted -- will not suffice. Most Americans will have 
to accept sacrifices in the form of higher taxes or cuts in popular spending 
programs. Only the most disadvantaged should be protected from austerity. 
</P>
<P>
Is the Administration or the Congress to blame for the mess we find ourselves 
in? This is the wrong question. They both gave us what we demanded. The fault, 
dear reader, lies not in our elected officials but in ourselves.

PLAYING NUMBERS GAME IS MEANINGLESS EXERCISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The story pointing up the empirical worthlessness of the government's index of 
leading economic indicators, "Economic Indicators Lose 1.2%" (Sept. 29), 
scratched the surface of a deep problem. In fact, just about every statistical 
measure used by the government is equally as divorced from reality as this 
index, and the problem is not merely the inaccurate counting that plagues the 
U.S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
It is much more fundamental. 
</P>
<P>
All the statistical measurements themselves are meaningless -- shimmering 
figments of the economic delusions of the three generations of official 
alchemists: Keynesian social planners, Marxian "industrial policy" czars and 
monetarist number twirlers. 
</P>
<P>
These high priests of bureaucratic babble rely on flat-earth economic theories 
that fail every scientific test of predictive accuracy, whose basic assumption 
of "manageability" has been discredited by the mathematics of chaos, but which 
have swept the field anyway because of their political utility. For example, 
the much-touted gross national product follows Keynes in counting transfer 
payments (Social Security, welfare, farm subsidies, military pensions) as 
additions to national income, even though they add nothing to the nation's 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Marxians measure the value of output by the labor invested in it, without 
regard to supply, demand or market prices; these are the people who think that 
raising the minimum wage increases prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
Monetarists believe that fiddling with interest rates and the money supply 
allows them to fine-tune the economy. This is equivalent to trying to control a 
car by twisting its speedometer needle -- the inevitable result is a crash.

GOVERNMENT-RUN BROTHEL PROMISED NICE TURNABOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Mustang Ranch Seized," (Sept. 20), I was very excited when the 
federal government took over operation of the infamous Mustang Ranch (a 
105-room brothel in Nevada now being liquidated by the IRS). 
</P>
<P>
I was equally disturbed when they changed their mind. It would have been the 
first time in history that the people could do to the government what the 
government has been doing to them all these years.

THREE NOBELISTS EXAMINE THE BUDGET DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For weeks, all eyes have been on Washington as Congress and President Bush have 
wrangled about how to reduce the burgeoning federal budget deficit. 
Disagreement raged over proposals to raise income taxes for the wealthy, 
increase Medicare premiums, cut capital-gains taxes and increase taxes on 
cigarettes, alcohol and gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Bernstein interviewed three Nobel Prize-winning economists -- Milton 
Friedman, 78, of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, James Tobin, 
72, of Yale University and Franco Modigliani, 72, of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology -- for their views on the deficit reduction proposals 
and their possible impact on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
What is your view of the negotiations taking place in Washington? 
</P>
<P>
Tobin: I imagine that some kind of budget package will pass that won't be too 
much different from the summit proposal (agreed to by the White House and 
congressional leadership) but will cut out some of the more objectionable 
proposals to both sides. But that doesn't really do a whole lot to the deficit 
over the five years that are projected. I think it's Ronald Reagan's latest 
victory. Once again, the strategy is to run up a big deficit while claiming 
that you could never raise taxes because it will ruin the economy and getting 
the public to believe in the supply side fraud, which claims that it will all 
work out for the best. Once you do that, then on the other side you use the 
scare tactics of deficits to get rid of social programs you don't like. So 
that's happening once again. It's been going on for almost 10 years now. Just 
another act in the same drama. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman: I think Washington is a nuthouse. I think they're arguing about all 
the wrong things. They ought to be concerning themselves with how we get the 
government out of agriculture, about how we get the government out of the 
school system, the transportation system and so on down the line. 
</P>
<P>
The simple answer to taxes is that you ought to lower them. There is no 
evidence historically or otherwise that increasing taxes will reduce the 
deficit; it will simply increase government spending. The rule from history is 
that the government spends as much as it can from raising taxes plus as much 
more as it can get away with. The public at large does not believe it is 
getting its money's worth. 
</P>
<P>
Modigliani: First, Bush said that he wanted to raise taxes, then he changed his 
mind. It seems to me at this point it's anybody's guess whether they come up 
with a package, except that I do feel that the pressure is so high that somehow 
they'll have to do it. 
</P>
<P>
If they do come out with $40 billion to $50 billion in a deficit reduction now 
and $500 billion over the next 10 years, I would regard it as a good down 
payment. But it is absurd to think that you can do that kind of a 
deficit-reducing job by soaking only the poor. Certainly the rich have to 
share. I certainly think there should be a mild increase to the top brackets. 
You can't ask people who are fundamentally poor and old to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Is the U.S. economy too weak to handle a deficit-reduction package now? 
</P>
<P>
Modigliani: No, I don't believe that at all. Any weakening that may come from 
that side can be counter-balanced by several sources of additional spending. We 
of course need lower interest rates, and that will permit us to invest more and 
to export more. There will be ample ways of compensating the demand. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are we talking about substantial amounts in cuts, so there is no excuse 
whatsoever. There is plenty of demand around the world if we only exported 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Tobin: It is ironic that in a year which is the least opportunistic occasion to 
raise taxes or lower expenditures that suddenly the President got panicky about 
the size of the deficit. He should have gotten panicky two years ago. But the 
package is actually tailored so that most of the restrictive parts of it come 
later rather than in Year 1. 
</P>
<P>
There is a good long-run reason for lowering the deficit, and that is to get 
lower interest rates and more savings in the long run, which will increase 
productivity. I think the Federal Reserve is capable of handling the economy 
and reversing recession even if some negative stimulus is given to the economy 
by this budget package. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman: I don't think the problem is deficit reduction. I think the problem 
is spending reduction. I believe it is ludicrous to argue that a government 
that is spending one-quarter of the national income doesn't have enough money 
to spend. What we need is lower spending and lower taxes. Not lower taxes to 
offset recession; we need lower taxes because the taxpayers are simply not 
getting their money's worth for the fraction of their money the government is 
getting. 
</P>
<P>
Some argue that too much attention is paid to reducing the deficit. What do you 
think of that argument? 
</P>
<P>
Friedman: The deficit in the last five years has been a good thing and not a 
bad thing because it is the only thing that kept Congress from spending more of 
our money. If you can think that in some miracle the deficit could have been 
wiped out, can you imagine how much the government would have been spending? 
</P>
<P>
It isn't necessary to reduce the deficit, it's necessary to reduce spending. 
Those are not the same thing at all. Let's suppose you reduce tax revenues by 
$100 billion and reduce spending by $100 billion. You would leave the deficit 
unchanged but nonetheless the government would be spending a smaller fraction 
of our money. The taxpayers would have that $100 billion back in their pockets. 
And what is the economy but all the people? 
</P>
<P>
Tobin: It's not necessary to reduce the deficit in a particular year, but it is 
necessary to reduce it over the long run. So it's never absolutely necessary to 
reduce the deficit, but if you keep saying that year after year, you end up 
with a very large debt, very high interest rates, a lot of the federal budget 
used for debt service and a trade deficit such as we have been saddled with for 
many years, and a low rate of domestic investment, none of which is good for 
the economy in the long run. In addition to that you have a poverty-stricken 
federal government. In a very wealthy country you have no money to take steps 
to clean up the environment, to provide social services. It's not that the 
economy is too weak and small to do these things, it's that we can't afford it 
politically because the public has been sold the idea that we don't have to pay 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Modigliani: I think saying it's not necessary to reduce the deficit is the most 
ridiculous argument that I ever heard. If you want to destroy the country, I 
think they are right. If they don't care what happens to the future, if they 
only want themselves to pay less taxes, then they may suit themselves. I think 
it would be a disastrous for the country. The payments that we make on interest 
on the deficit have increased by $140 billion since 1980, when Reagan came in. 
That is $700 per capita, per person in the United States. And to think that all 
the fight is about $40 billion; it doesn't even cover half of the damage we 
have done. 
</P>
<P>
Where do we go from here? Is the nation headed for a long economic slide? 
</P>
<P>
Tobin: It need not be. We don't know what's going to happen with the Middle 
East crisis, but there's no reason the economy should be in for a long slide. 
The recession is manageable by the Federal Reserve regardless of what happens 
to the deficit this year or next year. If we could get the fiscal house of the 
federal government back into the shape it was in before 1980, we could get 
interest rates down, we could get the public and private investment back to 
where they could be spending for the good of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman: Nobody knows. However, there is no need for the United States to be 
in for a very long slide. The United States is fundamentally a very wealthy, 
healthy country. You sometimes feel that if you could just close down 
Washington, everything could be fine. 
</P>
<P>
But as a matter of fact, we are in a recession. It will get deeper before it 
goes around, but there is no reason to suppose that it will turn into a major 
recession or depression. And there is every reason to expect the economy will 
turn up in the next year or so. If we could get in Washington a move to lower 
taxes on the part of the Federal Reserve toward steady money growth, the basic 
strength of the economy would have a chance to show itself. 
</P>
<P>
The economy is relatively weak, we're in a recession, we've been in a recession 
for a year, we've had recessions for 200 years. The world has not changed. 
</P>
<P>
Modigliani: The American economy is essentially flat. 
</P>
<P>
I would want to warn about two dangers: war and the deficit. First of all, in 
the case of war, I think the situation will get messy, because war together 
with the oil problem is likely to mean more inflation, and that is sure to lead 
the Federal Reserve to restrictive policies, which will actually create a drop 
in output. So we are perched in a delicate situation. 
</P>
<P>
If there was no war, I would say we are flat; the economy is flat. With the 
danger of war, there is a danger that the economy will go down. If we get much 
higher prices for oil, that is surely to get us into inflation and into 
stagflation. 
</P>
<P>
Second, failing to reduce the deficit will just mean that we keep not investing 
very much and we keep borrowing and borrowing and borrowing abroad. The 
immediate effect of the deficit is to make you feel good, like when you go on a 
trip and pay later. You feel good and then you get a hangover. The deficit 
makes you feel good -- until you pay later.

PORTRAIT OF A SOCIETY PAINTER; 
</P>
<P>
LIFESTYLE: LIKE MANY AN ARTIST, JULIAN LA TROBE IS SEARCHING OUT ALL THE RIGHT 
PEOPLE AT ALL THE RIGHT PARTIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES SOCIETY WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Portraits of the rich and powerful are proof that both the sitter and the 
artist have arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Artist Julian La Trobe would like Angelenos to know he has arrived -- from San 
Francisco, where for five years he has been painting portraits of that city's 
elite society crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Now, seeking to stretch his reputation south, he has rented an apartment in 
Hollywood -- a 1920s-vintage domicile near the Hollywood Bowl -- with barrel 
vaulted ceilings and a secret passageway that leads up to a tower. He has been 
painting a nighttime sky with stars on his bedroom ceiling. The bathroom will 
have a morning sky. 
</P>
<P>
And he is engaged in meeting the right people, those he hopes will commission 
portraits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's scary," he admits. "To come down here and . . . be plopped in the middle 
of a fabulous party where you don't know a soul, that's a little intimidating. 
I haven't had to do that in about two or three years. So at parties I just have 
eight hands out, I'm like an octopus, shaking hands and smiling and laughing 
and having a wonderful time. I really like the people down here. I think 
they're fun and exciting and doing things, which is a little different from up 
there, where you have a lot of people living off of old funds." 
</P>
<P>
He's especially fascinated by the relentless drive of those high on the food 
chain in the movie business. "That would make a great portrait," he says, "that 
intensity." 
</P>
<P>
If it's intensity he's looking for, it's suggested that he might want to look 
up Creative Artists Agency super agent Michael Ovitz. 
</P>
<P>
"Ahhh. Michael Lovis," he says. 
</P>
<P>
That's Ovitz. 
</P>
<P>
"Ovitz. Michael Ovitz. I'll remember that." 
</P>
<P>
Forgive him his unfamiliarity with the powers that be, for La Trobe has barely 
scratched the surface of Los Angeles society. But it's destined to be his bread 
and butter if he is going to make a name for himself here by painting the 
city's rich and famous. 
</P>
<P>
He was recently nudged out of his Pacific Heights apartment and pointed south 
by two friends: Los Angeles artist Tony Duquette and interior designer Hutton 
Wilkinson. They are introducing him to the Right Kind of People at the Right 
Kind of Parties, like philanthropist Frances Brody, whose home La Trobe has 
already rendered on canvas. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing unusual about La Trobe wanting to schmooze in the L.A. social 
scene; artists -- including the late master schmoozer, Andy Warhol -- have been 
doing it for decades. 
</P>
<P>
"Artists have always (worked the party circuit)," says local artist Annie 
Kelly, who met La Trobe through Wilkinson. "Very few don't. Most artists are 
making the rounds." 
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old La Trobe -- whose flamboyant manner was described by one 
acquaintance as "gently swashbuckling" -- very much wants to make it here. 
</P>
<P>
"I love society people," he says. "I guess I know that they're real. I never 
think about who they are and what they are, it's just your eyes and my eyes, 
and us communicating. The other stuff -- what they have -- never gets in 
between." 
</P>
<P>
Money doesn't impress him? 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not. It's a must for the business, but no, not really. If somebody 
walked into a party and I didn't know her, and somebody told me she had $600 
million she's dying to spend, the first thing that goes through my mind is, 
'Let's do a portrait.' " 
</P>
<P>
But there's a fine line between making nice with rich people and being an oozy 
sycophant, and La Trobe is careful not to cross it. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that on the one or two occasions when somebody wanted something out of 
me, and they were being nice to me for it, I could tell. It just bothered me. 
Hopefully I never seem that way." 
</P>
<P>
What helped start his career in San Francisco, says La Trobe, was falling in 
with "the right people" -- not society types, but the antique dealers, 
architects and interior designers who could introduce him to their clients. 
</P>
<P>
"The wealthy people don't make a move without their OK," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
Before San Francisco he had been living in Europe; first Rome, where he 
painted, then Venice, where he worked for the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, 
entertaining rich American tourists whom the Guggenheim was wooing for funds. 
</P>
<P>
He embarked for Europe after graduating from the Rhode Island School of Design. 
Reared by British parents in Memphis, Tenn., who encouraged his artistic 
inclinations, he always felt a bit like an expatriate, and thought he might be 
more comfortable living in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
But that didn't suit him either, so he moved to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always looking in a sort of Fellini-esque way at the scene," he says. 
"Always. Always. And never passing judgment, but just, boy, this is straight 
out of a movie. Look how birds of a feather flock over there, or there's the 
queen bee over there. I just loooooove that, I love that. I love it visually 
too. 
</P>
<P>
"And even though I am sort of going around (meeting people) and trying to get 
business," La Trobe explains, "I think everyone at the party is doing it, 
whether you're an investment banker or you have a film to produce, you're 
meeting the people you should be meeting. I think everybody's at the party for 
some reason other than purely just to be there and have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
John Mariani, a wealthy Los Altos businessman who is among La Trobe's clients, 
says the artist fits in quite nicely among the social crowd there. "He disarms 
them completely. A little red flag goes up when someone is a little too grand; 
there are so many fake grand people who make it somewhere else and come to San 
Francisco to be grand. He is exactly what he is. Julian goes through society as 
if he's going through a sieve: effortlessly. The only thing he leaves behind 
are his brush marks." 
</P>
<P>
Mariani bought a La Trobe painting at a San Francisco antique store years ago 
as an anniversary gift for his wife, but met the artist some time later. 
</P>
<P>
"He came to my apartment on Nob Hill about two years ago. I didn't know who he 
was. He walked in and said, 'I'd love to paint your apartment.' I knew it 
needed a paint job, but I didn't know anyone could be so bold. So the next 
morning he arrives wearing a hair band, a white painter's smock with black 
polka dots and shorts. He looked like a go-go girl from the '60s. And I said, 
'I really don't want my apartment painted.' Then I saw what kind of paints he 
had and finally realized who he was and all that. So I told him to come in and 
went back to bed and told him to paint whatever he wanted." 
</P>
<P>
What he ended up painting was a portrait of Mariani -- sound asleep in bed. 
Subsequent canvases were filled with Mariani at the piano wearing silk pajamas 
and Mariani at a small dinner party. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him he'd have to clear out for dinner," Mariani recalls, "and he asked 
if he could paint me at dinner. In San Francisco you're always looking for a 
way to warm people up, and it became sort of the talk of the town that we were 
painted at dinner. Very decadent." 
</P>
<P>
Capturing home interiors on canvas may seem odd to those unfamiliar with the 
tradition, popular among the wealthy in the 19th Century. Although portraits 
are La Trobe's first love, he started doing interiors a couple of years ago. 
Interiors start at $2,000, portraits at $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
He explains: "A lot of people I work with have several houses, and they like 
the idea of having a painting of one in the other, and vice versa. Why? Because 
they made it, they created it. Whether they did it with a decorator or they did 
it themselves, there's so little creativity out there that is available." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco interior designer Andrew Fisher and wife Katherine McGuire 
recently commissioned La Trobe to do separate portraits; he also did a painting 
of their garden and bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
"His interiors show much more creativity than a photograph," says Fisher. 
"Plus, you can tell lies here and there -- make things a few feet taller, make 
everything look prettier. . . . It's also interesting to see how the artist 
perceives how you live." 
</P>
<P>
La Trobe says he is fortunate that most of the interiors appeal to his taste. 
Occasionally they don't, as with a recent home he painted which he describes in 
a whisper as " '60s motel." 
</P>
<P>
A few of his peers are quick to denigrate his work, calling his paintings 
"potboilers." "They say, 'Are you still doing your potboilers?' meaning, are 
you still doing what you have to do? I keep telling them, 'I can't tell you how 
happy I am with what I'm doing. It's so rewarding for me, and I honestly don't 
see that you're a bastion of happiness.' But it's not their fault," he sighs. 
"It's where art has gone . . . I have the facility to get my point across, but 
they probably think that I'm not searching." 
</P>
<P>
He showed in few galleries in San Francisco; none seemed to be the vehicle for 
his work. Years ago, he was scheduled to mount an exhibition with Duquette, but 
the building burned days before the show was to go up. Thus, he's never been 
reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Duquette says that finding an L.A. gallery to exhibit La Trobe's work is among 
the first orders of business once the artist is settled. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he'll start to be known through exhibitions," Duquette says. "This is 
such an enormous area. . . . In my time, there were really only three society 
groups: Hollywood, Pasadena and Hancock Park. Now there are 30 or 40 factions. 
I don't think he can be introduced to a group that would put him on the map, 
but you can be introduced to a city that can." 
</P>
<P>
La Trobe mulls this over and says, "The problem is that we haven't seen any 
galleries that are quite right. It would be ideal to get a gallery, but 
somebody with my sensibility is difficult to come by. I haven't seen anything. 
In the meantime, until we find something, I'll continue on getting through 
society."

TO CATCH THE WIND;

<P>
FEINSTEIN AND WILSON LATCH ONTO POPULAR INITIATIVES IN THE HOPE OF BOOSTING 
THEIR APPEAL.

<P>
Once upon a time, there were two small boats racing for the California 
mainland. After weeks of pitching about in murky waters, they sat totally 
becalmed, at the mercy of winds and currents beyond their control. 
</P>
<P>
A storm blew up in the far-off Persian Gulf. And the little attention that 
people gave to the race shifted. 
</P>
<P>
Then, a continent away, the U.S. government came to a grinding halt, and 
spectators really began to grow distracted. "Who cares about a race where 
nothing happens and nobody wins?" they groused. And the two little boats rocked 
back and forth and got nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
The boats, of course, are the gubernatorial campaigns of Democrat Dianne 
Feinstein and Republican Pete Wilson, as they chart their course from the first 
debate to Nov. 6. And this is a fable -- a simplistic one at that. But so are 
the campaigns. They turn on expectations, not reality. 
</P>
<P>
The first debate between the two candidates was a reflection of strategies that 
have avoided the whirlpools of complex issues, the dismal squalls of tough 
problems and the risks of tacking against the prevailing winds. 
</P>
<P>
For a while it looked like the Wilson boat would have an advantage, because it 
had more fuel. Even Feinstein's own crew described her craft as "running on 
fumes." Then came the court ruling that overturned Proposition 73's limits on 
campaign contributions. That allowed Feinstein to fuel up with new money and 
remain competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Both campaigns set out, hoping to cruise safely -- and first -- into Sacramento 
harbor. 
</P>
<P>
What happened? Where are they? And does anybody care -- have all the spectators 
lost interest and just gone home? 
</P>
<P>
After navigating the shoals of the first debate, both campaigns are still 
afloat; the race is very much on. The candidates made it through by hugging 
familiar coastline. Each charted a course and doggedly stuck to it. There are 
lessons to be learned from those tactics and signposts to see us through to the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
What the debate proved was that a candidate can answer -- or evade -- any 
question as he or she chooses, no matter how it is asked or who asks it. So 
much for using this strange hybrid of a dual press conference and high school 
oratory to shed light on anything that the candidates don't want to be exposed. 
</P>
<P>
The big news from the debate may well have been the issues that weren't 
addressed: 
</P>
<P>
Health care. There was no recognition of the potential implosion of the state's 
health-care delivery system. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance reform. A throwaway line. 
</P>
<P>
The homeless. As invisible in this campaign as they are in the eyes of society. 
</P>
<P>
Fiscal problems. Despite the fact there is a budget debacle brewing in 
Sacramento as threatening to California's economy as the one rocking Washington 
is to the nation's, neither candidate broached a solution. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever is elected governor will have to hit the ground at full gallop with a 
plan to deal with an estimated revenue shortfall of at least $500 million. If 
the economy is in a tailspin, if voters approve the initiatives on the ballot 
that require new funding or earmarked revenues, that estimate could rise to $2 
billion or more. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of increasing fiscal inflexibility -- imposed on California's 
governors by legal mandates and ballot-box budgeting -- where does each 
candidate propose to find the money to balance a seriously out-of-whack budget? 
</P>
<P>
We don't know what their taxing and spending priorities might be -- beyond 
buzzwords and generalities. Or how each would move to unshackle the state 
budget process. 
</P>
<P>
And we are not likely to know very much before Election Day. In today's 
campaign environment, if the candidates dared to tell us what they would 
actually do, it could spell political disaster for them. 
</P>
<P>
That is one of the reasons why "change" and "leadership" were the topics of 
choice in the first debate. These terms define style rather than substance. And 
they are likely to be the buzzwords for the duration of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Because it failed to underscore many real, substantial differences between the 
contenders, the debate seemed to turn on style and emotion -- on which way each 
candidate felt a favorable wind was blowing. There is every indication that the 
election, too, will turn on style and emotion -- if not political pandering. 
</P>
<P>
If that is the case, turnout -- not only how may people vote but what the 
electorate looks like -- may well determine the next governor. 
</P>
<P>
The reality is that both candidates have engaged in "weather-vane" politics. 
Each is bent on using initiatives on the November ballot to catch a friendly 
breeze. 
</P>
<P>
Early on -- when a powerful environmental wind was blowing -- Feinstein aligned 
herself with "Big Green," Proposition 128, banking on a heavy turnout of 
committed environmentalists to boost her chances. But there appears to be no 
big bang for Big Green. Will that trim her sails? Will her support for the 
massive goals of Proposition 128 allow her instantly to "out-environmentalist" 
Republican Wilson? Or will her linkage with what opponents have disdainfully 
called "the Hayden initiative," after Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-West Los 
Angeles), prove to be a drag? 
</P>
<P>
Wilson felt a gust of wind blowing across the land, knocking down incumbents in 
its path. "Voter dissatisfaction," it whistled. And he tacked in the direction 
of Proposition 140, Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum's Draconian 
term-limitations initiative on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
It is clear that Wilson and crew hoped this dramatic endorsement would lift his 
campaign out of the doldrums. It did grab a few post-debate headlines, but it's 
unclear whether Wilson has been given a push strong enough to blast him into 
the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a candidate who, until the moment during the debate when he endorsed 
Proposition 140, based his campaign on a long record of experience in 
government. How credible is his endorsement of an initiative that prohibits a 
long record of experience in government? 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, will Wilson succeed in using term limits to hang the 
Legislature around Feinstein's neck -- linking her to the banana republic that 
has been Sacramento these past few years? 
</P>
<P>
Can Wilson's endorsement of Proposition 140 be written off as a sop to the 
conservative wing of the Republican Party -- which has been less than 
enthusiastic about his candidacy? Will it bring the right wing out to vote for 
term limits and Wilson? Will this allow the incumbent U.S. senator instantly to 
position himself as "Mr. Political Outsider"? Or will Californians opting for 
"change" vote for 140 and Feinstein -- who, by not being a man, simply embodies 
change? 
</P>
<P>
The bad news for both contenders is that, historically, it has been difficult 
to tie a candidacy to an initiative -- particularly a proposal that wasn't the 
candidate's right from the start. That sail may be full of holes. 
</P>
<P>
From the very beginning, this campaign has been fraught with unchartable 
whirlwinds. Political tradition suggests "October surprises" yet to come. More 
federal budget lunacy? A recession? War with Iraq? A spate of new Sacramento 
indictments? Another round of sniper fire over the candidates' spouses' 
financial disclosures? 
</P>
<P>
Whatever is in store, most likely it will not be a discussion how each 
candidate would govern -- really govern. 
</P>
<P>
In a few days, the candidates will meet again. If the issue to be debated is 
change, Wilson ought to tell us how his tenure in the governor's office will 
offer change from the policies of his fellow Republican, George Deukmejian, 
California's incumbent governor. 
</P>
<P>
If the issue is leadership, Feinstein ought to tell us how she will challenge 
the Democratic leaders in the Legislature today. 
</P>
<P>
Someone once said of John F. Kennedy, "He did not fear the weather and did not 
trim his sails, but instead challenged the wind to improve its direction and 
cause it to blow more softly and kindly over the world and its people." Now 
there is a different sense of leadership, of change. Not two small boats 
listing in the water, waiting for a favorable breeze to blow their way.

GIVING OUR CHILDREN A BREAK; 
</P>
<P>
INITIATIVES: BIG GREEN RIGHTLY WOULD HAVE US PAY THE ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS OF 
LIVING, NOT PASS THEM ON -- AS WE ALWAYS DO -- TO THE NEXT GENERATION.

<P>
Proposition 128 -- "Big Green" -- revives an old debate. Those in favor of it 
talk about risks. Those opposed talk about costs. The debate has never fully 
been joined, because those who profit by the risks are not those who pay the 
environmental costs. In the end, the debate is whether we will pay the 
environmental costs of living or continue to pass them on to our children. 
</P>
<P>
While we debate, the risks grow -- and so do the economic costs of responding 
to them. In the last 10 years, the Environmental Protection Agency's policy 
changed from "risk prevention" to "risk management," or -- in plain words -- 
from preventing health risks to recognizing that we failed to prevent the risks 
and now must choose which ones we can afford to reduce. 
</P>
<P>
Both industry and the consumer have long "externalized" the environmental costs 
of living. We dump our waste into rivers, bays and landfills; we pour waste 
products out the smokestacks of industry and the tailpipes of automobiles. Only 
in the last 50 years have the costs begun to catch up with us. 
</P>
<P>
It is clear that forests are no longer a birthright -- they are now a 
commodity. As fewer Californians trust their tap water and buy drinking water 
at $1 or more a gallon, water becomes a commodity. As air quality declines, 
even oxygen may become a commodity. 
</P>
<P>
So, we are under increasing pressure to develop an environmental regulatory 
system. We have a strong financial regulatory system in the form of banking, 
insurance and finance laws and an abundance of lawyers and accountants 
answerable to these laws and paid for by government and industry. That system 
was resisted and then accepted by businesses to assure a stable working 
environment. We are evolving an environmental regulatory system to assure a 
stable physical environment. 
</P>
<P>
Few are saying we don't need the kinds of regulations contained in Proposition 
128. The measure would ban 19 pesticides known to cause cancer, at a time when 
some 3,000 wells in California are known to be contaminated with pesticides. It 
would phase out the use of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons -- which, if 
unregulated, would cause the deaths of 30,000 people by skin cancer -- four 
years before the federal government's target date. 
</P>
<P>
The proposition would require a 40% reduction of carbon dioxide by the year 
2010, and anyone constructing a building would have to plant a tree for every 
500 square feet of the project. This, at a time when scientific opinion is 
almost unanimous in warning of global warming due to the burning of fossil 
fuels and when California is the 12th largest source of carbon-dioxide 
emissions in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 128 recognizes the existing state ban on new oil leases within 
three miles of the coast and sets new limits on the discharge of pollutants 
into the oceans. It creates an elected office of environmental advocate who 
will have the power to sue government agencies when they ignore environmental 
laws. It bans cutting of virgin stands of redwoods and provides funds to 
purchase old-growth forest. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say Big Green tries to do too much in too short a time. They say we 
ought to address each issue separately in the Legislature. But by lobbying and 
campaign contributions, industry has kept elected officials from addressing 
environmental problems in ways the broad public finds satisfying. More and 
more, elected officials are reduced to being simply watchdogs over the economy, 
because their second salaries -- their campaign contributions -- are more 
important to them than their official pay. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, we have come to the point at which we increasingly address 
environmental issues (and education, crime, the homeless) by initiative. 
Proposition 128 is long and complex in proportion to the degree to which the 
Legislature has failed to deal satisfactorily with issues of air and water 
quality. And to wade through a series of separate laws would be no less complex 
than this initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The proposition's opponents also claim Big Green will cost too much -- $3 
billion, maybe even $12 billion. But there is no dependable analysis of the 
cost, because these costs have never been paid before. 
</P>
<P>
A study financed by oil and chemical companies claims food prices would rise 
30% if Big Green passes. Virtually all the increased cost, however, comes from 
including common ingredients like oil and sulfur among the pesticides to be 
banned. The proposition's sponsors and the EPA alike reply that Big Green won't 
ban such pesticides. Farmers frightened by the chemical companies' claims now 
fear they will be deprived of familiar chemicals and have no alternative 
pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
We have heard this argument before. When California banned DBCP in 1977, peach 
farmers declared they'd lose $39 million over the next three years. But they 
found other pesticides and lost nothing. Alternatives already exist to all but 
two of the 19 pesticides banned by Big Green, and manufacturers have eight 
years to find substitutes for the two. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the aim of Proposition 128 is not to stop the use of pesticides. 
It is to bring about the use of safer pesticides and so reduce the 
environmental cost. That may reduce the sales of currently used chemicals, but 
it also offers chemical companies the opportunity to find new products. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents assume that to meet the carbon-dioxide reduction provisions of Big 
Green, new gasoline taxes would raise the cost of energy by 20%. Supporters of 
Big Green point to a study by the Natural Resources Defense Council. It found 
that California could achieve far more than the proposition's target by such 
methods as providing better lighting and appliances, making buildings more 
efficient, increasing auto-fuel efficiency and driving less. After paying 
initial costs, the study reported, Californians could enjoy energy savings 
worth $87 billion over a period of 50 years. To that should be added 
uncalculated savings in health and workplace-absenteeism costs that a cleaner 
California would enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
There will be costs associated with Big Green. Industries in coastal counties 
would pay new fees for pollution audits and for preparation of water-pollution 
prevention plans. Home buyers would pay more for landscaping. We'll pay 
interest on bonds sold to buy redwoods. The state legislative analyst estimates 
increased costs of .1% to .3% for local governments, .2% to state government to 
administer the new law. The state will appropriate $40 million for research 
into alternative pesticides, alternatives to chlorofluorocarbons, reduction in 
greenhouse gasses and prevention of marine pollution. And we'll pay initial 
costs investing in energy-efficient cars, homes and appliances. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents ask why California should bear these costs before anyone else does. 
Phasing out chlorofluorocarbons before the federal deadline merely raises our 
cost of living and puts us at a market disadvantage with other states and 
nations. Why should San Diego reforest when Las Vegas doesn't? Why should we 
forgo our offshore oil or old-growth forest while Indonesia plunders hers? 
</P>
<P>
One answer is that their profit is short term. The advantage we gain is long 
term. They go on passing the costs to their children, while we accept the 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Another answer is that we would not be the first. Germany, Denmark, Great 
Britain, Japan and the Netherlands all have announced plans to stabilize or 
reduce carbon-dioxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
A third answer is that someone has to lead. If California phases out 
chloroflourocarbons, dangerous pesticides and water pollutants quickly, it is 
not mere gesture. It is leadership. California is the eighth largest economy in 
the world. Where it goes, other states must follow. Just as auto manufacturers 
sell cars that meet California's tougher smog standards in Iowa and Florida, 
California pesticide and water-quality laws will have effects on habits in 
distant states and nations. 
</P>
<P>
If Big Green is controversial, it is so because it requires us to start 
thinking in new ways. At an industry debate over Proposition 128, an angry 
manager calculated that his company's planned 400,000-square-foot development 
in San Diego would require, under proposition 128's terms, the planting of 
8,000 trees. "Where's the water for those trees going to come from?" he 
demanded angrily. He concluded the effect would be to transfer both water and 
forest from Northern California to Southern California, and that the supporters 
of the initiative had no intention of providing the water. He said he saw in 
Proposition 128 a hidden agenda -- stopping growth altogether. 
</P>
<P>
There is no hidden agenda. There is a corporate failure to see. Those trees are 
part of the environmental cost of the project, a cost that has always been 
dumped on future generations. The trees are not there simply to set 
bird-watchers atwitter. They are there because they are part of the Earth's 
economy. The trees are needed to sequester the carbon released by the burning 
of gasoline by cars going to and from the facility, and to reduce the need to 
burn more fossil fuels to heat and cool the buildings. If there isn't water to 
support them, someone ought to face the question of whether that 
400,000-square-foot facility belongs in San Diego. If the resources are there 
-- and we don't have to borrow them from future generations -- build the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Big Green's purpose isn't to stop growth. It is to consider where the limits 
are. We can't go on forever refusing to consider anything that suggests limits. 
</P>
<P>
The bills are coming due. Proposition 128 asks a fairly simple question. Who's 
going to pay them: The people who profit by the use of these resources or 
descendants who no longer remember what the resources were?

THE PERSISTENT 'GNAT' THAT LOUSIANA CAN'T GET OUT OF ITS FACE; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTIONS: EVEN BY THE BYZANTINE STANDARDS OF THE STATE'S POLITICS, THE FACTORS 
THAT LED TO DAVID DUKE'S 'VICTORY' WERE COMPLEX.

<TEXT>
<P>
On the day when budgetary gridlock closed the Washington Monument, angry 
catcalls from the visitors' gallery of the U.S. House of Representatives echoed 
resoundingly a thousand miles away in the voting booths of Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
There, Democrat J. Bennett Johnston Jr., running for a fourth term in the U.S. 
Senate, saw a substantial lead -- predicted by some optimists to be as high as 
50 points -- melt to 12 points virtually overnight. More stunning was the chief 
beneficiary of the wild political swing -- a soft-core pornographer, former 
Nazi and Ku Klux Klan leader who reportedly celebrates Adolf Hitler's birthday. 
David Duke is also a state representative and member of the Republican caucus. 
</P>
<P>
Even by the Byzantine standards of Louisiana politics, the factors that led to 
what virtually all observers agree was an enormous success for Duke -- 44% of 
the vote -- were complex. Ed Renwick, Loyola University political scientist and 
pollster, concluded that there were three categories of Duke supporter: "There 
were the voters who liked Duke, those who hated Bennett Johnston, and those who 
just wanted to send a message to Washington." 
</P>
<P>
Closer examination shows how Duke brilliantly exploited the foibles of his 
opponents, the essential rottenness of the state's "open primary" system and 
the frustration of voters trapped by an unyielding state Democratic party. 
</P>
<P>
The underlying theme of every Duke campaign is, of course, race and, no doubt, 
he attracted racist votes. But his adopted "mainstream" message of denouncing 
welfare programs and affirmative action and opposing any new taxes has deeper 
significance in a state where political corruption is perceived to be the norm 
and where the economy is so weak that population decline may cost the state a 
seat in Congress in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Duke, unsuccessful as a Democratic candidate for local office, ran for 
President as the nominee of the ultraright Populist Party in 1988. A year 
later, he decided to run as a Republican for a seat in the state house 
representing largely white Metairie, a suburb of largely black New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Alarmed at the prospect of the racist Duke receiving GOP legitimacy, such 
worthies as former President Ronald Reagan and Republican National Committee 
chairman Lee Atwater excoriated Duke and championed his regular Republican 
opponent. The tactic backfired: Blue-collar Democrats crossed over in the open 
primary and sent Duke to Baton Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
With some apprehension, the Republican caucus accepted Duke as a member. Its 
leader, Emile "Peppi" Bruneau, insisted that under the rules, set like the 
supposedly nonpartisan "open primary" system by the Democratic majority, his 
delegation had no choice. 
</P>
<P>
Not everybody agrees. State committeewoman Beth Rickey confronted the caucus 
with evidence that Duke was selling racist literature out of his capitol 
office, including an approving version of Hitler's "Mein Kampf." Rickey 
demanded Duke's expulsion from the caucus, but the members declined. Bruneau, 
mindful of Duke's penchant for martyrdom, warned opponents they were "snapping 
at a gnat." 
</P>
<P>
This year, the national GOP leadership had high hopes of toppling Johnston. But 
the Lousiana primary was unable to field a candidate with statewide name 
recognition. At their convention, where Duke got 5% of the vote, Republicans 
nominated state Sen. Ben Bagert. He was clearly a sacrificial lamb. 
</P>
<P>
Duke ignored all that and declared himself a Republican candidate. Democrats 
snickered; the Louisiana media routinely reinforced Duke's self-ascribed new 
credentials by referring to his Republican status. 
</P>
<P>
Enter the miscalculations: 
</P>
<P>
As Arnold R. Hirsch, University of New Orleans political scientist, explains, 
Louisiana's "open primary" was devised in 1975 by former Democratic Gov. Edwin 
W. Edwards as a means of eliminating the Republican contenders from statewide 
races. "The original intent was to kill the GOP before it really got on its 
feet," said Hirsch, who recalls that Republican registration was in single 
digits before the 1980s. The rules that make it tough for Republicans to 
enforce party discipline were tailor-made for a maverick candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Democrats felt it was unfair to have to come out of their bloody, 
costly primaries and have to face unscathed Republicans in the general 
election. Any candidate winning more than 50% of the vote in the nominally 
nonpartisan "open primary" is elected outright. Otherwise, the top two, usually 
Democrats, face each other in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
Another miscalculation was a high-profile anti-Duke campaign by an ad hoc group 
called the Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and Nazism, made up of liberals 
and some regular Republicans like Rickey. It mercilessly exposed and lampooned 
Duke's unsavory and not-so-distant past. The coalition was particularly 
critical of the state GOP and Bagert for not openly denouncing Duke. For all 
practical purposes, the coalition became the mud-slinging left arm of the 
Johnston campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Polls indicated that Duke's support leveled off last summer, especially after 
the coalition discredited his military record and exposed his authorship of a 
sex manual. But after months of attack advertising, including a coalition TV 
spot, the overkill began to numb the effect. 
</P>
<P>
As Bagert's polls collapsed, he finally attacked Duke. Negative advertising 
against Duke, as in 1989, seemed to energize his renegade campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Then Johnston, jubilant over Bagert's fall to single-digit support, thumbed his 
nose at the official GOP candidate and turned up the heat on Duke, whom he 
proclaimed as his only "real" opponent. 
</P>
<P>
In a sort of Willie Horton commercial in reverse, Johnston released an attack 
commercial showing a videotape of Duke at a Klan rally standing in front of a 
burning cross and throwing a Nazi-like salute as he bellowed, "White victory!" 
</P>
<P>
The TV spot backfired. "(Johnston) shouldn't have run those commercials," 
claimed pollster Renwick. "I thought it was very dangerous." All the attention 
on Duke simply legitimized his candidacy, while making a martyr of him. 
</P>
<P>
Then with fewer than 72 hours before the polls opened, Republicans 
inadvertently handed Duke a compelling last-minute issue: Bagert withdrew from 
the race and eight northern Republican U.S. senators took the unprecedented 
step of endorsing Democrat Johnston and denouncing Duke. This unlikely 
alliance, announced on the eve of the federal budget debacle, was the living 
embodiment of the old George Wallace adage that there isn't "a dime's worth of 
difference" between Democrats and Republicans in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Louisiana Democrats were ecstatic. Some felt Johnston might get as 
much as 75% of the vote -- up from 48% in late polls -- since the ex-Klansman 
was pegged at 25% in the polls. More cautious observers worried that pollsters 
were undercounting Duke support. They were right. 
</P>
<P>
The ecstasy turned to horror as returns showed Duke support climbing to 44%. It 
had been generally agreed that if Duke were to poll more than 40%, it would be 
a victory for him. 
</P>
<P>
Who created David Duke? The Republicans or the Democrats? Probably fewer than a 
quarter of Duke's voters were Republicans, since they comprise only 17% of the 
state's registered voters. Many of them reluctantly voted for Johnston, while 
some went for Bagert by absentee ballot; others stayed away from the polls. 
Meanwhile, 60% of whites went for Duke. Surprisingly, black turnout was 15% 
less than projected, in part because black leaders were focusing on the race 
for an open congressional seat rather than the U.S. Senate contest. 
</P>
<P>
Now state GOP house members must decide quickly whether they wish to be 
perceived as genuine Republicans or stooges for Duke. Expulsion, of course, 
would take courage. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana Democrats, on the other hand, must take the larger share of 
responsibility for creating this monster. The "open primary" rules, created 
expressly for the purpose of keeping Louisiana a one-party state, are 
unfriendly to reasonable opposition. To change this patently unfair system 
would take courage, too. 
</P>
<P>
As for Duke, he may run for governor next year. But he has to weigh the risks 
of relinquishing his house seat and of polling less than 44% the next time, 
which would take the bloom off the rose. Almost certainly, though, he will 
spend the next year consolidating last week's "victory." 
</P>
<P>
"David Duke is going to take over the state GOP," predicts Rickey. "He's 
targeting my seat, for example." 
</P>
<P>
Duke's entry into the 1991 gubernatorial race would be dandy for former Gov. 
Edwards, who is eyeing a fourth term. Duke, and perhaps the regular GOP 
nominee, would draw votes from the incumbent, conservative Democrat Buddy 
Roemer, whose vetoes of strict anti-abortion and anti-obscenity bills leave him 
vulnerable on the right. The result would probably be an Edwards-Duke runoff, 
which Edwards, with his strong black support, ought to win handily. Were 
Edwards not to run, there are fears that Duke might actually win in a runoff 
with Roemer, but he would probably need at least 75% of the white vote. 
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Duke might launch either a George Wallace-style campaign against 
President Bush in the Republican primaries, or he might actually win in a 
campaign against Republican Rep. Robert L. Livingston. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, Democrats presumably would be delighted. Whether Duke's Hitlerite 
past will travel well across state lines remains to be seen, but as Kelly 
Johnston, deputy political director for the National Republican Senate 
Committee, says, "He has the potential to cause us some headaches." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, if Duke wants to win a seat in Congress, the door appears to be open to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
That door, however, would be slammed in his face in Washington. Kelly Johnston 
says, "He would be a pariah. The Republicans in Congress would have the courage 
to do what the state caucus didn't. Duke would be totally useless there, with 
no party privileges or committee assignments." He'd be lucky to get a parking 
place, and his district might as well be beamed up to the moon. Of course, that 
would have happened had he been elected to the Senate, too.

FOREIGN POLICY: THE SOVIET UNION HAS CUT ITS HELP TO FIDEL, BUT HIS MAGNETIC 
APPEAL CONTINUES TO HOLD A MAJORITY OF HIS COUNTRYMEN.

"Fidel doesn't fall, not even from his bed." 
</P>
<P>
So goes a popular Cubanism, often repeated throughout the island after one of 
Washington's habitual predictions of Castro's imminent ruin. But the bed is 
starting to wobble from the pounding Cuba has been taking in recent months as a 
result of dwindling economic help from its main partner, the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Castro is long accustomed to U.S. efforts to weaken his regime. But now, the 
United States has been joined by new and unexpected allies. The supply shortage 
from the Soviet Union and the weaker but still very effective economic 
sanctions imposed by some European countries have seriously affected Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad to see the deterioration of the economy and daily life in Cuba," 
wrote Froylan Lopez, a columnist for the Mexican newsmagazine Proceso. "The 
only socialist government in America has been forced to ration the consumption 
of essential goods." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the U.S. economic blockade, the ideological war launched through 
Radio and T.V. Marti, the "hostile acts," as Castro calls Washington's military 
maneuvers near his island, the endless verbal attacks from government officials 
-- none of these American efforts has had the desired effect. 
</P>
<P>
There are moments in the history of any country when events converge to produce 
serious and profound change. This seems to be one of those moments in the life 
of Cuba, with or without U.S. influence. 
</P>
<P>
The island cannot continue being what it has been when its main supporter, the 
Soviet Union, is putting in place purely capitalistic principles. The words of 
Vladimir Zheranovski, one of Moscow's rising leaders of the opposition, reflect 
some of the forces shaking Castro's bedsprings. 
</P>
<P>
"Sharing is not lucrative," he said recently. "Efforts should be oriented (to) 
produce something in exchange. The national interest must be placed ahead of 
solidarity with underdeveloped countries." 
</P>
<P>
What seems clear now that the peak of Castro's latest crisis is passing is that 
changes in Cuba are not going to happen while he still holds power. Castro 
remains the country's undisputed and charismatic leader, followed by the vast 
majority of his people and admired by important intellectuals and politicians 
worldwide. With his enthusiasm, his faith, and his magnetic appeal, he can move 
his people as he likes and maintain the revolutionary pride in Cuban 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that the paternal figure of Fidel continues to exert an unlimited 
fascination over the majority of Cubans," exuded a leading Latin magazine not 
long ago. However, Cuba's unavoidable transformation must be separated from the 
spreading joy over the worldwide "triumph of capitalism." Castro's defeat would 
be nothing to crow over. It would signify the end of the socialist ideal and 
its dream of a better life in which wealth is shared by all, in which the 
wealth of the rich is transferred to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
That dream has never been a feature of the capitalist promise. 
</P>
<P>
The tendency to magnify capitalism's virtue is making people believe there is 
no other possible way. But in the capitalist world, there is much that is not 
worth celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
Seen from the point of view of many south of the U.S. border, for example, the 
Latin poor fill the coffers of the U.S. banks through crushing and oppressive 
external-debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
If it is true that some Latins can live well with capitalism, the majority do 
not. It is a dangerous mistake to convert capitalism's vices into virtues 
simply because the Marxist regimes have failed to fulfill their socialist 
ideals. Most of Latin America's capitalist democracies are characterized by 
injustice, poverty, unemployment, hunger, illness, electoral fraud, political 
and racial murder and torture. And those ills are suffered by the majority of 
the population throughout the continent. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, it is still valid to ask which is worse: The "capitalist 
freedom" offered by these countries? Or the "ideological rigidity" of Castro's 
Cuba, where until now nobody has died from starvation, people live longer and 
healthier than anywhere else in Latin America, education is universal, housing 
and jobs are available, and people can afford to feed their families? Behind 
the arrogance and intransigence of which his detractors accuse him, Castro is 
the last leader on the world stage who still believes in the promise of 
socialism. The idealism that many in the United States interpret as destructive 
blindness has permitted Castro to maintain his regime -- and his country's 
pride -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
Pride was the foundation of the Cuban revolution, and remains so to this day, 
37 years later. It would be a mistake to pigeonhole Castro as another communist 
failure. His revolution, his regime, his communism are too different from the 
East European models to expect him to fade because they have. Castro's 
revolution, remember, was conducted for and by Cubans, not imposed from 
outside. And that is why it is wrong to try to force Cuba into the inevitable 
wave of reform sweeping Marxist regimes elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Sooner or later, international pressure, age, death, political upheaval at home 
-- any or all will bring Castro down. And that will be the end of an ideal. But 
what must be avoided is that Castro's end becomes a catastrophe for Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, in the eyes of many analysts, Cuba's problems spring solely from 
Castro's intransigence. They ignore all the international factors that are 
bearing down on his country. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's stubbornness and its insistence in its right to intervene in other 
countries could convert natural and healthy political change in Cuba into 
disaster. Instead of attacks, Cuba needs support now that world conditions are 
pressing it for change. 
</P>
<P>
As Mexican opposition leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas has proposed, the last best 
hope for Cuba may lie with its closest neighbors. Latin American countries must 
open their doors to new possibilities of regional integration with Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
It may be the only way Cuba can repair Castro's wobbling bed.

BANNING RACIST SPEECH BEGS THE REAL QUESTIONS OF CURBING RACISM; 
</P>
<P>
CODES: TELLING STUDENTS WHAT THEY CANNOT SAY, EVEN WHEN BIGOTRY IS THE TARGET, 
IS A BAD IDEA. MORE SPEECH, NOT LESS, IS BETTER PROTECTION. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The American idea of free speech hinges on the basic principle that, subject to 
a very few, very narrow exceptions, everyone may say what he wishes, even if 
what he says is poisonous or hateful. A true democracy cannot do otherwise. 
Democracy determines the form and procedure by which its citizens discourse; it 
may not determine the content of that discourse. 
</P>
<P>
But a new trend may be emerging. A series of speech codes have been enacted on 
various campuses, including Stanford, the UC Berkeley and the University of 
Wisconsin. If you say something racist, you can be suspended or expelled. The 
codes themselves are usually narrowly drawn to cover the face-to-face, 
intentional racial insult and, as such, they may even pass constitutional 
muster. It is the justifications offered for these codes that are worrisome. 
</P>
<P>
The speech codes -- one is tempted to say "loyalty oaths" -- are usually 
defended by law professors, who should know better. One of them, Mari Matsuda 
of the University of Hawaii, has been a primary proponent, proposing a ban on 
racist speech, a "value-laden, non-neutral" approach that she proudly describes 
as "heretical" to First Amendment thinking. "Speech is meaningless to people 
who don't have equality," she says. Only oppressed groups would be protected 
because "retreat and reaffirmation of personhood are more easily attained for 
historically non-subjugated groups." 
</P>
<P>
Leave aside for the time being the sociology jargon and an apparent desire for 
the notoriety that leads to tenure. Turn, instead, to the basic concepts of 
this philosophy. The starting point is the idea that speech is meaningless to 
people without equality. And yet the whole concept of banning speech is 
premised on the idea that it is very meaningful, indeed. We must protect 
minorities from racist speech because speech is in some way important. Why 
protect them? Because racist speech degrades and insults them. 
</P>
<P>
Racist speech is, without any doubt, degrading and insulting. As a Eurasian, I 
can assure you that it is far more debilitating than most whites realize. 
Perhaps the only thing more degrading and insulting is the assumption that one 
is too weak, too cowardly, too helpless to stand up for oneself against the 
racists. 
</P>
<P>
Victims of racist speech can shout back, throw a good left jab, file a 
complaint, organize a boycott or a picket line. Or maybe -- and this is much 
tougher -- they can just study hard, graduate at the top of their class and let 
success be their revenge. Surely overreacting to racists is to allow them to 
have more importance than they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
But however one chooses to react, it seems counterproductive to cultivate 
delicate sensibilities, or to nurse a conviction that one is entitled to 
protection from the rough and tumble of life. It is ironic that the 
beneficiaries of the campus speech codes are university students, who probably 
confront a great deal less real racism than most ordinary working people. 
</P>
<P>
What about the idea that the way to prevent or end racism is to silence 
everyone who doesn't belong to a "historically subjugated group"? Many whites 
-- Irish, Jews, and Armenians, for example -- have claims to historical 
subjugation. And a lot of racism doesn't involve whites at all, but exists 
between members of different minority groups. If we prohibit racist speech by 
other minorities, are we subjugating them more? Do we have to choose which 
group has been historically more subjugated in order to decide whose rights to 
enforce? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the saddest outcome of this largely academic insistence on form over 
substance is that it distracts from real problems of economic inequality based 
on race. Bans on racist speech don't prevent racism, or even its expression. 
It's hard to solve real problems but easy to make up trendy proposals regarding 
other people's civil liberties. 
</P>
<P>
Does racism silence minorities? Most certainly. But accusations of racism, in 
America today, are at least as silencing. People with good intentions, trying 
to explain complex or ambiguous feelings, can be silenced immediately by the 
accusation of racism. And that's the tragedy of the speech code. It won't stop 
real racists, who don't care how they are perceived. It will only stop people 
who actually care about how minorities view them. 
</P>
<P>
The response to minorities who feel silenced is to encourage them to talk, not 
to silence everyone else. The solution to bad speech has always been, and 
always will be, more speech. 
</P>
<P>
We have always honored the concept that everyone has a right to express an 
opinion, no matter how much the rest of society may disapprove. We have always 
feared that if we start imposing limits on some speech, we may find it 
difficult to stop. But that is not all there is to the traditional defense of 
free speech. Democracy is a bare-knuckle business. Free speech is the way we 
find out what other people are thinking. That's the necessary first step to 
persuading them of the justice of our arguments, of reaching democratic 
compromises people can live with. We aren't talking about making sure no one 
hurts our feelings. We are talking about getting the information we need to 
change the way people think. 
</P>
<P>
A racist won't stop being a racist just because you stop up his mouth. 
Believing that the elimination of racist speech is somehow the same as 
eliminating racism is plain romance. 
</P>
<P>
The concrete measures of equality and power have to do with money, food, 
education, housing. Hopefully, all those bright young minds in all those fine 
universities will turn their minds to the solution of real race problems for 
real victims, and leave hall monitoring to the First Amendment romantics.

WHAT WOMEN WANT: EQUAL ACCESS FOR INTERVIEWS, NOT BAD JOKES; 
</P>
<P>
LOCKER ROOMS: PROFESSIONAL PARITY, NOT GENDER, NOT NUDITY, IS THE ISSUE FOR 
FEMALE SPORTSWRITERS AT WORK IN THE CLUBHOUSE OF THE 1990S.

<P>
"The vote wasn't unanimous," Tommy John told me on the day the 1977 World 
Series between the New York Yankees and the Los Angeles Dodgers began, "but on 
the Dodgers we do what a majority of the players decides to do." 
</P>
<P>
In this case, a majority of Dodgers voted to grant me access to their locker 
room so I could interview them alongside my male sportswriting colleagues. But 
I never went into their locker room during the World Series. Midway through the 
opening game, then-Commissioner Bowie Kuhn overruled the Dodgers. Baseball, 
Kuhn's men said, was not ready to allow women reporters into locker rooms even 
if the sport's more enlightened citizenry, in this case the players, approved. 
</P>
<P>
My yellow press pass for the World Series said in bold letters that I could be 
admitted. Those words were meaningless as long as any woman reporter wore them. 
The fact that professional basketball and hockey leagues had voluntarily opened 
their teams' locker-room doors several years earlier didn't matter to Kuhn. Nor 
did pleas that this case was one of equal rights. Baseball was ready and 
willing to take a constitutional stand against equality for women reporters at 
the locker-room door. 
</P>
<P>
After several months of unproductive discussions with Kuhn and his 
representatives, my employer, Sports Illustrated, determined that it would have 
to go to court. The magazine's own staff was bursting with young, competent 
female reporters who trusted they would have an equal chance to excel in their 
chosen profession. Similarly at newspapers and television stations, women were 
hired to cover sports. 
</P>
<P>
Without equal access to players, women clearly could not match their male 
colleagues in day-to-day coverage. Nor could I, a magazine reporter, contribute 
the background information essential to making our weekly coverage 
comprehensive. Ability wasn't the issue. Without a chance to talk with sources, 
even the most able reporter can't do a good job. For gender to be a primary 
factor in determining success in securing sources was discriminatory and 
illegal. And unnecessary. Players in other sports were proving that. Those who 
wanted to undress wore bathrobes or draped themselves in towels to protect 
their privacy during the short time that reporters -- men and women -- were in 
the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1977, Sports Illustrated filed a lawsuit in federal court; I was a 
named plaintiff. The suit asked for equal access for women to interview 
players. Neither our argument nor the judge's ruling specified that interviews 
must take place in locker rooms. There was only one stipulation: If baseball 
deemed that alternative arrangements were necessary to protect the players' 
privacy, then access had to be the same for men and women reporters. Since 
then, nearly all professional teams have eschewed alternative strategies and 
decided to grant unlimited locker-room access. The system generally has worked 
quite well. 
</P>
<P>
What has never worked as well is the public debate surrounding this issue. 
During the 1970s, stories -- and headlines -- veered toward the supposedly 
titillating aspects of the case. Legal principles and talk of equal rights all 
but vanished beneath a barrage of snide commentaries and giggly remarks about 
ladies intruding on this last male bastion. Often portrayed as women (or called 
in headlines "girls," as in "No Girls Allowed?") who only wanted to gaze at 
naked men, the issue departed starkly from the central question of fairness. 
</P>
<P>
Red Smith, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist, accused me of striking a "note 
of low comedy" by filing this lawsuit, labeling me Sports Illustrated's Joan of 
Arc. Papers carried Smith's syndicated column under the banner "A Laughing 
Matter." Another headline proclaimed: "Woman reporter sues to see Reggie in the 
buff." "She Pitches for Covering Where Everything's Bare" and "Babes in 
Boyland" headlined other stories. 
</P>
<P>
Today, some of the public still doesn't understand. But there is a big 
difference: Equal access for women is no longer viewed as a debatable point. 
Not gender, but professional access, is the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Twelve years ago the legal battle about equal access was resolved by a 
judge. Now there are more than 500 women covering sports (in my day there were 
fewer than 30), and they have formed their own professional association. 
Hundreds of women have done thousands of interviews in locker rooms, as have 
male writers in female locker rooms, such as at the NCAA basketball tournament. 
The public hasn't been hearing about this once-so-inflammatory issue because 
the system usually works well. 
</P>
<P>
Only when a part of the system breaks down does the topic of women in locker 
rooms surface, as recently occurred. One breakdown involved a few New England 
Patriots' players who humiliated and harassed a woman reporter by displaying 
their genitals and mouthing lewd remarks. A few days later Cincinnati Bengals 
coach Sam Wyche denied equal access to players to a woman reporter in defiance 
of league rules. 
</P>
<P>
At first, women's presence -- and not the repugnant behavior of the players or 
the illegal act of the coach -- seemed to be moving to the epicenter of debate. 
As coverage escalated and the same old tired refrains about what women were 
doing in men's locker rooms started to be heard, I feared territory won in the 
1970s might be reclaimed in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
I was wrong. Yes, many people still cannot see past the unaccustomed 
intersection of working women in men's locker rooms and trust that if adults 
act maturely it can work. And yes, some still don't care if women have an equal 
chance to succeed. But it is now quite clear that equal access for women 
writers is secure. No one who holds the power to diminish women's equal access 
has suggested otherwise. In fact, the extraordinary fine of $30,000 levied 
against Wyche and the first-ever appointment of a special counsel to 
investigate the Patriots' debacle are both encouraging signs. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are the days when the sound of women asking for equal rights struck notes 
of low comedy. That's something to cheer about as women cover the World Series 
next week, locker rooms and all.

The drug-war plans of Wilson and Feinstein show the same old failed approach. 
</P>
<P>
They would both spend money to provide more drug treatment for their children 
and more prisons for minority children. 
</P>
<P>
When any budget is divided the way they did, the upper classes will get 
treatment, while the lower classes will get jail. They need to recognize that 
jail is not a solution for drug abuse.

Obviously, Feinstein and Wilson lack the leadership to make hard choices as 
evidenced by their responses to your Commentary debate issue, "Given $20 
Million for Drug Enforcement or Treatment, I'd Choose . . ." (Oct. 8).

I, too, will make the easy choices and vote for neither of these invertebrates.

<P>
The candidates' positions are not very dissimilar, as the Oct. 7 debate 
illustrated. Oh, a few differences, but not enough to sway a vote. 
</P>
<P>
Now, once again in an important race, the voting public is down to judging 
personality, leadership and backbone; and during the debate, Dianne Feinstein 
seemed the more comfortable in expressing leadership and drive. Here, 
Feinstein's experience with adversity stands her in good stead . . . her 
balance in guiding the San Francisco city government back into healthy 
re-emergence after a scarring, murderous day in its history. She leaves no 
doubt of her ability to deal with the likes of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
and Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti and handle the rough-and-tumble 
politics of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
I do doubt Pete Wilson's ability to provide leadership under stress. He has 
always played it safe on the issues and followed wherever opinion polls or 
powerful constituencies led him. In the debate, he expressed his hesitancy at 
handling Brown, Roberti, et al, preferring a "term limits" removal of these 
difficult legislators. I personally could respect Sen. Wilson if he would spend 
time in Washington trying to help solve the budget impasse -- this is what we 
elected him to do, and he could gain ground publicly by demonstrating 
statesmanship in a crucial situation. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson doesn't flunk as a public representative, because he does respond to 
public opinion in a good-natured way, but he is a follower and not on the 
stellar level where Feinstein comfortably demonstrates her leadership and 
drive.

THE NARRATIVE ARTS: SQUANDERING THE BLUE BY KATE BRAVERMAN (BALLANTINE: $17.95; 
241 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The women in Kate Braverman's first collection of short stories seem to have 
stepped from the works of Joan Didion into another color scheme. The "hard 
white empty core of the world" in "Play It as It Lays" has given way to the 
green of money, the red of tropical flowers and sunsets, and, above all, blue. 
Blue is the sea and the sky and the swimming pools of Beverly Hills. Blue also 
is the blues, the flames of the gas with which poets commit suicide, even the 
fallout from Chernobyl tinkling down on California as "a kind of blue ice." 
</P>
<P>
Still, we recognize these women. They aren't the Latinas of Braverman's most 
recent novel, "Palm Latitudes." They are Didion women: WASPy and skinny and 
neurotic, prone to nervous breakdowns and chemical dependencies, so overwhelmed 
with sensibility that they fumble at life's ordinary tasks. They go to AA 
meetings, wreck cars, agonize over Christmas shopping, write in the Hawaiian 
jungle, picket a nuclear installation in Nevada, tour Eastern Europe with an 
alienated daughter, dread cancer and AIDS and being exiled by divorce to live 
in some shabby apartment. (The men in their lives are creeps who bully and 
manipulate, deal drugs and take them for rides on the wild side, but don't 
truly matter.) 
</P>
<P>
Still, color schemes count. There are differences. Didion came to fiction from 
journalism, Braverman from poetry. Didion's prose has the poise of exhaustion. 
Her Los Angeles is where the American journey ended; her women draw what 
strength they have from fading memories of frontier grit. Braverman's Los 
Angeles is where something corrupt but vital, no longer exclusively American, 
is being born: "not an absence but a seizure of competing postures and 
rituals." Her women, despite all their problems, are on the trail of that 
something; her prose makes sudden jumps into the florid and the visionary. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Braverman's voice in these 12 stories is quite distinct from Didion's: 
more inward, less political, symbolically rather than explicitly sexual. What 
makes them comparable is their authority. As a book, "Squandering the Blue" is 
uneven, and also too much of the same thing. It has too many creative-writing 
teachers, too much vodka and cocaine, too much Angst about turning 40. The 
color imagery wears on the nerves. Some of the dialogue is impossible. The best 
stories are those the Braverman woman has to share with someone else: another 
woman, or one of the creeps, or a child, or her own childhood. But all of them 
have the Braverman voice, which has become one of L.A.'s most compelling, even 
when it goes overboard, into the blue.

Men have needed neckties for a long time, particularly since the 19th-Century 
reforms that left men's clothing utterly plain. In The Tie (Barron's: $21.95; 
160 pp.), Sarah Gibbings tells the history in considerable detail: how the 
ribbons that tied the 18th-Century pigtail became the bow tie, how the 
working-class (and American) bandanna turned into the modern four-in-hand, and 
how the riverboat gambler's string tie was originally associated with Lord 
Byron, who never actually wore a necktie. 
</P>
<P>
It's interesting to note how the modern necktie, often scorned as 
excruciatingly formal, originated as a rakish ornament of pugilists and 
horse-and-carriage hot-rodders. Turn-of-the-century female cyclists wore 
neckties, Gibbings speculates, to make them "honorary men" -- in other words, 
to indicate that they were not outdoors for disreputable purposes. There's 
occasionally more detail than many people will want here, as in the technical 
discussion of the Resilient Lining technique used in nearly all modern ties, 
and exactly how Pierre Cardin licenses his designs. But this book offers more 
than neckwear for thought. In its own way, it's a light on history.Charles

THE NARRATIVE ARTS: PRAYING FOR RAIN BY CHRIS SPAIN (CAPRA PRESS: $16.95; 126 
PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven of the 12 short stories in this collection are set in the Great Plains 
states, two in Brooklyn, one in California, one in Florida and one in Latin 
America. There are flashbacks to Vietnam and World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the stories involve institutions for the retarded or the mentally ill. 
The main characters are young men, or old men remembering when they were young. 
Deaths and injuries figure prominently: maimings, blindings, political 
"disappearances." 
</P>
<P>
A journalistic summary like this is exactly what you don't get at the beginning 
of a Chris Spain story. It's what you have to piece together yourself out of 
scraps of dialogue and description, half slang and half poetry. Slowly it dawns 
on you that the space shuttle Challenger has just blown up above a couple of 
fishermen who plan to market the raining debris; that the death squads have 
buried people wearing Mickey Mouse T-shirts just outside the hacienda where 
rich kids lounge by the pool; that the pretty girl at the Texas school is an 
inmate, just like the Vietnam vet in the wheelchair and the new boy who thinks 
he's a plane. 
</P>
<P>
The oblique approach works well for Spain. Like the teen-agers in "Praying for 
Rain" who hunt trophy trout with dynamite, young writers tend to tackle the Big 
D crudely and directly. Spain sneaks up on it with humor, with homely details 
of ranch work, even with the wanton destructiveness that counterpoints the 
innocence of his characters, one of whom says: "There is never anything we can 
do to save ourselves. . . . All of us always are dying of diseases that we have 
no immunities for."

<P>
A Quiet Little Neighborhood, a Perfect Little Murder (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is 
a new TV movie in which a woman, newly moved to the suburbs with her husband, 
overhears a murder plot. Teri Garr and Robert Urich star. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Light and Michael Ontkean star in In Defense of a Married Man (ABC 
Sunday at 9 p.m.), another new TV movie, in which a criminal attorney defends 
her husband who's on trial for murdering his mistress. 
</P>
<P>
Victor/Victoria (Channel 5 Monday at 7:30 p.m.) is a wise, delicious musical 
sendup of all the absurdities and hypocrisies surrounding the issue of sexual 
orientation. Blake Edwards' 1982 gem stars Julie Andrews and Robert Preston. 
</P>
<P>
With the 1981 History of the World, Part 1 (Channel 11 Monday at 8 p.m.) Mel 
Brooks indulges himself in some whoopee cushion humor, involving a Friars Club 
galaxy of comedians and ranging in situations from the Stone Age to the French 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Cheech &amp; Chong's The Corsican Brothers (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) finds 
the comic duo doing some traveling of their own -- into another century (18th), 
another country (France) and another territory (the swashbuckler) with a 
certain zany lyricism and some generous borrowing from Dumas. 
</P>
<P>
Kaleidoscope (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie from a Danielle Steel 
novel in which three sisters are strangely reunited by a private eye hired by a 
dying man. Jaclyn Smith and Perry King star. 
</P>
<P>
Fine Things (NBC Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is another new TV movie from a Danielle 
Steel novel, in which fate takes an executive's wife and tries to take his 
daughter. Tracy Pollan, D. W. Moffett and Cloris Leachman star. 
</P>
<P>
All the Right Moves (Channel 11, Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a solid, involving 
little picture starring Tom Cruise, who is excellent as a high school football 
player desperate to land a scholarship as a way out of his small, dying town. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow on the Hudson (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), Robin Williams is 
irresistible as a Moscow circus saxophonist who defects in Bloomingdale's. 
</P>
<P>
My Bodyguard (Channel 2 Wednesday at 9 p.m.) marked a nifty 1980 directorial 
debut for actor Tony Bill. Set primarily in a Chicago high school, it centers 
on a new kid (Chris Makepeace), a shy victim who finds his real strengths the 
hard way. Matt Dillon is the swaggering bully, and Adam Baldwin is the big, 
moody loner who Makepeace wants to be his bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
Opposites Attract (NBC Wednesday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie, finds a town 
supervisor (Barbara Eden) running for mayor against a movie star (John 
Forsythe) new to the community. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday at 8 p.m. brings a choice between two vintage Clint Eastwood movies, 
Coogan's Bluff (Channel 5) in which he's a Southwestern lawman turned loose on 
Manhattan's mean streets, and The Gauntlet (on Channel 13), in which he's again 
a Southwestern lawman (a Phoenix cop) who goes to Las Vegas to extradite 
terrified hooker Sondra Locke to be a witness at a mobster's trial. 
</P>
<P>
MASH (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.) is Robert Altman's stunning 1970 black comedy 
on the absurdity of war (and much else).

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: SURE OF YOU BY ARMISTEAD MAUPIN (HARPER: $10.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The seventh installment in the popular "Tales of the City" series continues 
Armistead Maupin's chronicle of contemporary life in a romanticized San 
Francisco. Part soap opera, part roman a clef and part ably written 
contemporary novel, "Sure of You" is as entertaining as Maupin's earlier books. 
</P>
<P>
While Michael Tolliver confronts the permanent terrors of his HIV-positive 
status, Mary Ann Singleton, who began as the heroine of the books, succumbs to 
an insidious disease within her soul. She's turned into an uncaring, 
status-hungry yuppie. Even Anna Madrigal, the ethereal, stoned den mother who 
presides over 28 Barbary Lane, has given up on her. Like the earlier 
"Significant Others," "Sure of You" is really about Brian Hawkins, Mary Ann's 
beleaguered husband. Originally a singles barfly, Brian has developed into an 
increasingly sympathetic figure, an intelligent baby-boomer grappling with the 
problems of growing older and growing up. Maupin has said "Sure of You" is the 
final volume in the series, but that decision is probably reversable: His 
characters, like his readers, may demand that he continue the story.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: INSPECTOR IMANISHI INVESTIGATES BY SEICHO MATSUMOTO (SOHO: 
$9.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The foremost mystery writer in Japan, Seicho Matsumoto has published more than 
450 books; "Inspector Imanishi" first appeared as a magazine serial, then as a 
novel in 1961, and sold more than 4.5 million copies. Eitaro Imanishi, the 
title character, is an unassuming but respected cop in Tokyo's murder division. 
</P>
<P>
A low-key, understated character in the best American pulp tradition, he also 
writes haiku and raises bonsai (hobbies it's difficult to imagine Sam Spade 
pursuing). When a body mysteriously appears in the Tokyo railway yard, Imanishi 
begins a curious chase that takes him from the posh hangouts of the avant-garde 
Nouveau Group to a spa in rural Honshu. In addition to being a good whodunit, 
"Inspector" offers a vivid portrait of the confused Japanese culture of the 
early '60s: The dignified old abacus maker/poet/calligrapher Imanishi 
encounters at the hot springs and the affected, Westernized artists of the 
Nouveau Group represent two strains that continue to divide Japanese society.

The royal chief rocker, no longer a precocious teen-ager, swaps his Kangols for 
some fly threads, his adolescent obsessions for the pressures of manhood, the 
weak, poppy beats of his last two albums for spooky drones from master-mixer 
Marley Marl. L.L.'s voice dropped half an octave, too, and his virtuosic 
machine-gun articulation slowed down into something subtler, more elastic and 
expressive, something close to Big Daddy Kane's. This is the first album where 
L.L. doesn't attempt to sound like the brash 16-year-old B-boy everyman he used 
to be -- man, he was devastating -- and also the first mature blooming of his 
style. JONATHAN GOLD

 PAUL SIMON "THE RHYTHM OF THE SAINTS" WARNER BROS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's still a little hard to get used to the idea of Paul Simon music as beat 
music, but that's exactly what "Saints" is -- his usual elliptical reveries and 
sad-mouthed regrets having been built this time from the ground up on a rock 
bottom of complex Brazilian rhythms. And they do kick. 
</P>
<P>
The very first song, "The Obvious Child," opens with a bold, cadence-like 
phalanx of drums, and though the meters get smoother and quieter over the 
course of the album, they never really let up. It's driving stuff that just 
might make you get up and dance. 
</P>
<P>
Or lay down and nap. Because at the same time the album carries a distinctly 
dream-like quality -- thanks not only to Simon writing his most 
impressionistic, least linear batch of songs to date, but to the languid 
quality of its melodic sense that offsets the busyness of the rhythm quite 
beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
Though it obviously shares many qualities with its four-year-old predecessor, 
"Graceland" -- including some of the same South African elements alongside new 
West African and Brazilian ones -- this album may be harder for the public to 
get a handle on. Celebrative musical strains on the level of "You Can Call Me 
Al" are far fewer on this gentler, spookier effort. 
</P>
<P>
The increased dillution between different geographic locales parallels the 
increased dillution of Simon's lyricism. You get the sense that this charming 
but emotionally elusive character welcomes all this ethnomusicology in part as 
something else to hide behind. Some of these songs -- burdened with incidents 
and details, but rarely declarations -- are textbook examples of how to write 
about being lonely without saying anything so obvious, or brave. 
</P>
<P>
If Simon is hiding, though, he's doing it brilliantly. After this equally 
engaging followup, "Graceland" seems less like an experiment and more like the 
beginnings of a new language that combines several old or even ancient ones -- 
the village spirit dance, the West Village folk Angst. And if he requires a 
Brazilian drum corps to provide some of the expressiveness his lyrics mask, all 
the better for us. CHRIS WILLMAN

Compiled by Lynne Heffley. Send listings to Stage Listings, Calendar, Los 
Angeles Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles 90053. Accessibility and 
facilities for the handicapped are indicated by the wheelchair symbol 
</P>
<P>
The selections are those of Times reviewers. Long-running plays are reviewed 
periodically. 
</P>
<P>
A Shayna Maidel (Tiffany Theatre, 8532 W. Sunset Blvd., Hollywood, (213) 
289-2999). A family, divided by events in Nazi Germany, is reunited after 20 
years. "Heart-on-sleeve theater, with a big heart and an ample sleeve. 
Remarkably affecting" (Don Shirley). Thur.-Sat., 8 p.m.; Sun., 3 and 7:30 p.m. 
Indefinitely. $20.50-$24.50. 
</P>
<P>
American Splendor (Theatre Theater, 1713 Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood, (213) 
466-1767). Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer Simpson on "The Simpsons," 
portrays underground comic book writer Harvey Pekar in a work based on Pekar's 
stories. "A superbly droll theatricalizing of Pekar's world, with no set and 
several terrific actors. Unromantic and noncynical, director Vince Waldron's 
adaptation shows people losing at life while almost always retaining their 
sanity." (Robert Koehler). Sat., 10:30 p.m. Ends Nov. 24. $10. 
</P>
<P>
The Beggar's Opera (Pacific Theatre Ensemble, 705 Venice Blvd., Venice, (213) 
466-1767). John Gay's satire of 18th-Century England's corrupt administration 
under its first prime minister. "If we needed evidence of this show's lasting 
relevance and of the wisdom of reviving it, this staging abundantly provides 
it. Gay's rough and ribald send-up is mounted in every nook and cranny -- floor 
to rafters -- of the ensemble's 17 x 45-foot storefront. It's brilliant use of 
non-available space" (Sylvie Drake). Thur.-Sun., 8 p.m. Ends Nov. 18. 
$15-$17.50. 
</P>
<P>
The Good Woman of Setzuan (Odyssey Theatre Ensemble, 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd., 
West L.A., (213) 477-2055). The Actors' Gang presents Bertolt Brecht's parable 
of good and evil. Tim Robbins directs. "Brecht's Theatre of Alienation -- of 
which 'Good Woman' may be the masterpiece -- was always about the alienation 
Out There and humanizing the audience In Here. Robbins and The Actors' Gang 
have served the playwright's purpose as brilliantly as any company can. This is 
Brecht as he wished it: for the masses" (Robert Koehler). Tue.-Fri., 8 p.m. 
Ends Fri. $10-$12. 
</P>
<P>
Honey, I'm Home (Stages Theatre Center, 1540 N. McCadden Place, Hollywood, 
(213) 466-1767). Satiric portraits of society, by and with Don Victor. "A 
humorist is rare in this era of jingly stand-up comedy and Don Victor is 
exactly that, a humorist" (T. H. McCulloh). Sun., 7 p.m. Ends Oct. 28. $10. 
</P>
<P>
Hope of the Heart (Mark Taper Forum, 135 N. Grand Ave., (213) 410-1062, (714) 
634-1300, (213) 972-7231, TDD (213) 680-4017). The writings of Robert Penn 
Warren -- Chapter IV of "All the King's Men" and "Brother to Dragons" -- 
adapted for stage by Adrian Hall, who directs. "Hall delivers an astonishing 
assault of ideas, images, language and a cappella choruses 'mediated' by 
turbulent emotion. It is how he has matched and theatricalized these stories, 
more than the stories themselves, that makes them stunning" (Sylvie Drake). 
Tue.-Sat., 8 p.m.; Sun., 7:30 p.m.; mat., Sat.-Sun., 2:30 p.m. Ends Nov. 11. 
$24-$30. 
</P>
<P>
Our Father (Gorky's Cafe and Russian Brewery, 1716 N. Cahuenga Blvd., 
Hollywood, (213) 463-6480). Comedy about six Irish brothers gathered at the 
wake of their deceased father. "Michael Stephens' writing is eccentric, vivid, 
poetic and highly theatrical, and director Ted J. Tobin caresses its rhythms, 
alternately gentle and harsh and unexpected" (T. H. McCulloh). Thur., 10 p.m.; 
Fri., 7:30 p.m. Indefinitely. $10. 
</P>
<P>
The Pelican (2nd Stage, 6500 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood, (213) 466-1767). 
Salome Jens heads the cast in August Strindberg's Gothic comedy. Directed by 
Jules Aaron. "Salome Jens gives a haunting performance as a woman who destroys 
her family, in a fascinating revival of Strindberg's chamber play" (T. H. 
McCulloh). Today, Thur.-Sat., 8 p.m.; next Sun., 3 and 8 p.m. Ends next Sun. 
$12.

Victor Mature is on a mail run. On a carbon-copy glorious morning in paradise, 
his trademark red Rolls-Royce golf cart is drawing to within 9-iron distance of 
the Rancho Santa Fe post office. 
</P>
<P>
As he has every day since anyone can remember, the aging star of 73 films is 
making his morning jaunt along the eucalyptus-shaded streets of his adopted 
home, blasting Big Band music on a portable tape player, waving a swarthy hand 
at smiling passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, Victor!" calls out a local attorney. Mature nods as he whizzes past, all 
the while extolling the virtues of life in this semi-rural collection of 1,800 
homes and estates that local residents affectionately call The Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been all over the world and this place beats 'em all," said the 
74-year-old former on-screen Sampson, whose still-rugged good looks recently 
garnered him a film offer to play Sylvestor Stallone's father. 
</P>
<P>
He swerves his golf cart with the flashing red light and fireman's helmet hood 
ornament onto deserted Paseo Delicias, the main drag of Rancho Santa Fe's tiny 
business district. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you believe this?" he said. "We're downtown. And there's just no action 
here. No traffic lights, no traffic. This place is Utopia, a country town in 
the shadow of the city." 
</P>
<P>
For three generations, Rancho Santa Fe has been safe harbor for a wealthy cadre 
of residents seeking to escape the constant change of the outside world, many 
of them attracted by its legendary Covenant that for 63 years has strictly 
maintained status quo throughout the hamlet. 
</P>
<P>
Nestled along the wooded slopes of a winding river valley, 5 miles east of the 
Pacific and half an hour north of downtown San Diego, the ranch is home to 
aging Hollywood icons, self-made millionaires, politicians and power brokers as 
well as celebrated businessmen, doctors and scientists from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Actor Robert Young lives there. So do Bert Parks and Patti Page, broadcaster 
Dick Enberg, best-selling crime author Joseph Wambaugh. They're all neighbors 
to former astronaut Wally Shirra, ex-Universal studios president Sy Salkowitz 
and Glenn Bell, who founded the fast-food Taco Bell chain. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Hughes once kept a home there. So did Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Bing 
Crosby -- who brought his first family to the then-unknown oasis to protect 
them from the 1930s kidnaping scares. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the Chicago Pritzker family -- owners of the Hyatt Hotel chain -- 
who recently completed an elaborate 18,000-square-foot mansion in which the 
glass alone cost $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Market Statistics of New York ranked the Ranch's 92067 ZIP code the 
second wealthiest in the nation, behind only Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Most homes within its 10 square miles are built on 2 acres or more. On the 
Ranch, many residents can gaze out their front windows and never see another 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the area's secluded country atmosphere has helped establish it 
as some of the most valuable property in Southern California. Served by no less 
than 85 realtors, the area's median home prices approach $2 million and even 
condominiums can sell briskly at $1 million apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1973, long after the Civil Rights Act, the ranch's Covenant -- its super 
set of governing CC&amp;Rs -- still outlawed blacks and Asians who weren't 
domestic servants. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, a hot-selling item is a locally produced videotape on how to 
communicate with your Spanish-speaking maid, and newcomers sometimes wait 
months, even years, before being invited to local parties. Even admission to 
the local Garden Club requires sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
But now, some residents say, the Rancho Santa Fe lifestyle is on the endangered 
list. 
</P>
<P>
Its 6,200 acres are nearing buildout as a new generation of up-and-comers seek 
to move within its boundaries -- invoking new arguments among old neighbors and 
increasing the number of lawsuits filed against the Rancho Santa Fe Assn., 
which oversees enforcement of Covenant rules. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, more battle lines were drawn over incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the ranch's 5,000 residents insist that cityhood is the only way to 
control traffic as residents from sprawling inland communities turn their 
scenic, winding roads into a shortcut to the coast. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time now, Rancho Santa Fe has been a solitary island in a sea of 
development -- but urbanization will bring new traffic and crime problems to 
this beautiful place," said attorney Dick Scuba, an incorporation advocate. 
</P>
<P>
"The anti-incorporation people look to the past. They say the Covenant has 
served us well and will continue to do so. We say the Covenant is neither 
designed nor equipped to deal with the future problems we'll face." 
</P>
<P>
In Rancho Santa Fe, the Covenant rules are more than just the law. They're the 
Bible. 
</P>
<P>
"The Covenant is God here," said Lorine Flemons Wright, a reporter for the 
Rancho Santa Fe Review. "No, that's not quite it. The Covenant is up here and 
God's down here underneath. That's how strongly people believe in it." 
</P>
<P>
For more than three generations, the 51-page document has lent a sense of order 
to the Ranch community by methodically dictating the changes that take place 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Stringently enforced by an art jury of local residents, the building-design 
rules limit housing styles to the Spanish colonial archetype introduced by 
architect Lilian Rice in the mid-1920s -- with the specific goal to ensure "a 
uniform and reasonably high standard of artistic result and attractiveness." 
</P>
<P>
This means that new homes must be painted off-white -- never red or canary 
yellow. Outdoor clotheslines must be hidden and "for-sale" signs are limited in 
size and number. 
</P>
<P>
Garages cannot directly face the road, so that, according to one resident, 
"none of us have to look in at somebody else's dirty old paint cans." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the narrow guidelines, self-made millionaires, company presidents -- 
men and woman who are used to making up their own rules -- follow them 
religiously. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the Constitution -- for years, that Covenant document has preserved 
the status quo around this place," said Joe Coberly, a 72-year-old retired Los 
Angeles automobile dealer who has lived on the ranch for half his life. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, it's kept some pretty rich and powerful people from sometimes doing what 
they wanted. But it's also kept their neighbors from erecting a flock of 
plastic pink flamingos in their front yard." 
</P>
<P>
Changes to the Covenant rules require a two-thirds vote of residents and often 
inspired long legal battles over even the slightest word variation. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, residents say, the document has been amended only three times -- 
most notably in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
A decade after the Civil Rights Act ensured equal rights regardless of race, 
the Covenant still forbade residency to blacks and other non-Caucasians unless 
they served as maids, chauffeurs or gardeners. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, residents know of few Asians -- and no blacks -- living within the 
area ruled by the Covenant. But longtime resident Al Frowiss still defends what 
he called "an unfortunate oversight." 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, that clause was there longer than it should have been -- in light of the 
Civil Rights Act," said Frowiss, who has run unsuccessfully for an association 
board post. 
</P>
<P>
"But you can't expect us to run right out and change a document just because 
people in Washington do something." 
</P>
<P>
The story shows just the deep feelings Rancho Santa Fe residents have for their 
community. And restaurant owner Bertrand Hug likes to tell it. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, two elderly residents were dining at Mille Fleurs, the French 
restaurant that Hug operates in the downtown business district. 
</P>
<P>
The two women listened intently as their waiter described the desserts of the 
day -- including the fresh peaches he assured them were locally grown. Not good 
enough for them. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to know," Hug recalled, "if the peaches were actually grown within 
the Covenant." 
</P>
<P>
Maintaining the hallowed status of the Rancho Santa Fe Covenant area -- which 
only last year was named a state historical landmark as one of California's 
first planned communities -- has become a particular passion on the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some outsiders have even attempted to redefine its boundaries, 
to inch them just across the street or so, in order to gain admittance to the 
Covenant. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people have tried to move the Covenant boundaries to include their 
properties," said Walt Ekard, manager of the Rancho Santa Fe Assn. "Few have 
succeeded." 
</P>
<P>
Success would mean more than just a social coup -- including privileges at the 
Rancho Santa Fe golf course and tennis club as well as perks such as family 
wedding announcements in the Review, now restricted to Covenant residents. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a matter of money. Real estate values can rise tens and even hundreds 
of thousands of dollars within its boundaries, Ekard said. 
</P>
<P>
It's a matter of atmosphere as well. 
</P>
<P>
Mail isn't delivered at home; Covenant residents still prefer to pick it up 
each day from the central post office-turned-community center where the locals 
meet to gossip and extend social invitations. 
</P>
<P>
Fear of the wrong kind of change has driven Ranch imaginations for years, 
recalled O. Rea Mowery Jr., a local bank president. 
</P>
<P>
As association manager, he was once summoned at dawn from his home in San Diego 
by an irate Ranch resident who had spotted a sign hung near the famed Inn at 
Rancho Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
"It was put there overnight as a prank," Mowery said. "It read 'Future Home of 
A&amp;W Root Beer.' " 
</P>
<P>
The idea for Rancho Santa Fe was hatched almost a century ago as part of a 
grand corporate gamble. 
</P>
<P>
The area was first developed in the early 1900s by a subsidiary of the Santa Fe 
Railway in an experimental project to grow eucalyptus trees for railroad ties. 
</P>
<P>
The project soon failed, as the eucalyptus ties warped and twisted after the 
spikes were driven in. Eventually, the development company financed the 
construction of nearby Hodges Dam and used a filtration system to introduce 
numerous citrus groves in the area. 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1920s, the railroad began selling the land to private interests, 
who created rural estates that often incorporated hundreds of acres of fruit 
groves. The area was renamed Rancho Santa Fe and the Covenant's bylaws were 
drafted. 
</P>
<P>
In the early days, some older residents recall, Douglas Fairbanks Sr. would 
show movies to guests seated on the lawn of his home. But in the late 1960s, 
the completion of Interstate 5 changed Rancho Santa Fe forever, attracting a 
new breed of successful resident who lived in the country -- but who went to 
work each day in the city. 
</P>
<P>
It was at that time, residents say, that privacy became a driving passion on 
the Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, Howard Hughes rented a hideaway home there and reportedly kept a 
stable of rooms at the nearby Inn at Rancho Santa Fe. Resident Joe Coberly 
recalls the army of security guards Hughes posted on the private drive they 
shared. 
</P>
<P>
Living next door to the most reclusive man of the 20th Century had its 
drawbacks. Hughes apparently wouldn't allow his guards to use the bathroom at 
his house. So the men began using the woods near Coberly's house, littering his 
drive with papers and beer cans. 
</P>
<P>
When he complained, none of the surly guards would even acknowledge that Hughes 
even lived there. "All they would ever say, to any question you asked was, 'I 
don't know anything about it,' " he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1960s, a nudist colony flourished among the Ranch's sometimes dense 
foliage where even today neighbors can go months, even years, without 
exchanging a greeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never talked with the woman who lives next door to me," said restaurant 
owner Hug. "She may be very nice. She may even be a customer at my restaurant. 
But I'd never know it." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the seclusion has lured a new breed of loner: drug czars. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, the federal Drug Enforcement Administration opened a North 
County office to help agents keep tabs on the illicit drug money being invested 
in wealthy North County suburbs -- especially Rancho Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, at least one home -- a $5-million mansion within the Covenant -- 
has been confiscated by agents, who find that the Ranch's wooded lawns and 
houses set back on narrow, winding driveways afford potential drug czars 
excellent cover. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of these people don't want to be ostentatious," said Joe Moody, resident 
agent in charge of the DEA's Carlsbad office. "They want quiet. That's why they 
prefer Rancho Santa Fe." 
</P>
<P>
The unwritten code of wealth in Rancho Santa Fe goes something like this: 
</P>
<P>
Don't flaunt it. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like people to move in here with the idea of making a grand gesture 
-- the big Gatsby house, the 12-car garages, the chauffeured limos," said Dan 
Royce, whose family owns the Inn at Rancho Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're trying to say, 'I've arrived' in any grand way, our response is 'So 
what?' People around here just don't care." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Manion, a local realtor and longtime Ranch resident, added, "To most 
people here, saying they're wealthy is a dirty word -- they'll deny it to your 
face. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's true -- a lot of people aren't really wealthy here. Many may be 
property rich but they live on fixed incomes. They get Social Security checks. 
And whether they're rich or not, they just don't like to show it. If you see a 
Rolls-Royce around here, you know there's a newcomer in town." 
</P>
<P>
John Ferguson, the mechanic at the Covenant's only gas station, tells about the 
millionaire horse owner who drives a 5-year-old Buick and prefers to dress in 
faded blue jeans and an oily old sweat shirt. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just the way people are around here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The way to throw your money around Rancho Santa Fe, people say, is to invest it 
into the community. 
</P>
<P>
And the Covenant is filled with benefactors. It has an active Rotary Club, a 
historical society, and a library guild that has raised money to augment 
librarians' salaries at its own county-run facility -- and even build an 
addition for children's books. 
</P>
<P>
Residents have bought their fire department state-of-the-art dispatch computers 
and once purchased a mobile home-turned-operating room on wheels specifically 
for injured Ranch residents. 
</P>
<P>
But it's at the local Rancho Santa Fe School for students from kindergarten 
through the 8th grade where local passions are most obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Often, parents attend meetings imploring school officials to say what they need 
to improve the school -- which already offers specialized computer education, 
art and music courses as well as teachers' salaries that are among the highest 
in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents have high expectations of their children here -- and they have even 
higher expectations of themselves to be able to provide for their school," 
Supt. Roger Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, that means all we have to ask is 'Do we really need this?' And if we 
do, we have those people we can go to help us get it." 
</P>
<P>
Victor Mature's blazing red golf cart zigzagging along the village streets 
symbolizes a basic truth about the hamlet: 
</P>
<P>
For years, golf has been king of the Covenant. Golfers dominated local politics 
and often made important Ranch decisions under the shade of the majestic acacia 
trees lining Rancho Santa Fe's private, 6,950-yard course. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, for example, a couple whose estate lines the golf course erected a 
red steel sculpture that most golfers considered -- well -- out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
They petitioned the association board, which devised a solution that some 
residents say typifies Rancho Santa Fe politics: they voted to build a dirt 
mound in front of the sculpture so the golfers wouldn't have to look at it. 
</P>
<P>
"In a lot of other communities, a bunch of golfers wouldn't think they had a 
say about someone else's private property," association manager Ekard said. 
"But not around here." 
</P>
<P>
But changes are coming. For the first time, non-golfers are being elected to 
the association's seven-member board of directors. Insiders hope the interests 
of the Covenant's younger residents will begin to receive equal attention. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, the Ranch's median age is declining. Once called Rancho Seven O'Clock 
for the time retired residents supposedly went to bed, the area is now home to 
a new generation of fortysomething parents concerned about how the community 
provides for their young. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been some tremendous building here of late, attracting a divergence of 
people with interests beyond golf," said Paul Thomas, association board 
president and a non-golfer. 
</P>
<P>
"They're younger people with concerns about the athletics of their children and 
whether there's enough playing fields for them in Rancho Santa Fe. Right now, 
that's a major political issue here." 
</P>
<P>
Add the increased traffic woes caused by surrounding growth as well as a 
stagnating business district that has shops and restaurants closing in favor of 
banks and real estate offices, and Victor Mature's Utopia starts looking like 
any other modern community with up-to-date problems. 
</P>
<P>
Incorporation, some locals say, is the only way Ranch residents can maintain 
control of their future and speed construction of two proposed county roads 
that could one day bypass traffic around their beloved ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people around here haven't gotten off the golf course long enough to 
realize that this little piece of paradise is in serious trouble," said 
longtime resident Frowiss, an incorporation advocate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like the old days. We don't have this area to ourselves anymore. 
There's more people moving in all the time, homes going up all around us. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people won't wake up until they hear the bulldozers to realize that 
Rancho Santa Fe will never be the same. Some of us already hear the bulldozers. 
We hear them loud and clear."

increased urbanization of their enclave. B1 SEAN M. HAFFEY / For The Times

CHANCE TO RESHAPE SCHOOL BOARD; 
</P>
<P>
SCOTT HARVEY AND SUE BRAUN ARE CLEAR CHOICES FOR IMPORTANT DISTRICT POSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
School board elections often force voters to choose from among unknown 
candidates with few distinguishing stands on key issues. Not this year. 
</P>
<P>
It's tough to confuse the candidates in the District C race for San Diego 
school trustee. The differences between them make Scott Harvey the clear choice 
for this important post. 
</P>
<P>
While the distinctions between District B candidates Sue Braun and Lynette 
Williams aren't as dramatic, Braun's more progressive bent and superior 
experience make her far more qualified for the job. 
</P>
<P>
In District C, Harvey favors the much needed school-based health clinics (but 
supports each community's right to choose whether they dispense 
contraceptives). His opponent, teacher John de Beck, does not. Harvey supports 
school integration programs; De Beck does not. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey has helped site child-care facilities on a school campus and wants to 
continue working for more of them. He proposes to broaden the curriculum to 
make it more relevant to the city's increasing population of ethnic minorities. 
A lobbyist by profession, he wants the school board to be more active in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Some of De Beck's iconoclasm and blunt talk about rethinking educational 
priorities is refreshing. But he suffers from the perception that, as a former 
teachers union leader, he would be too closely allied with the school system's 
main labor force to bring a balanced perspective to his role as trustee. All 
five current board members have endorsed Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Braun, who is making her second run for the school board, offers a platform 
a bit heavy on generalities. She has trouble explaining how she'll achieve her 
laudable goal of retaining more teachers. 
</P>
<P>
But Braun believes that to curb the dropout rate, school resources must be 
focused on building students' self-esteem as early as kindergarten. And she 
proposes to put more aides in classrooms to help handle escalating class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
Braun has broader and more sophisticated knowledge about the district's needs 
than neophyte Williams. A former teacher, Williams lists improving literacy 
rates, increasing the relevancy of the high school curriculum and character 
building as her top goals. She opposes school-based health clinics. 
</P>
<P>
With no incumbents running in this year's elections, voters have the 
opportunity to reshape 40% of the school board. These four candidates offer 
them a wide range of views and, we believe, clear choices for the future of the 
city's education system.

WRONG IMPRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent article on Cal State San Marcos ("A Different Drummer," Sept. 24) 
pointed out in a generally factual manner certain "differences" to be found on 
this new campus. But, as an instructor here, I am concerned that the facts 
apply to matters of form more than substance, and thus, in the understandable 
pursuit of novelty and humor, the article may have given an incomplete, even 
incorrect, impression. 
</P>
<P>
For example, suppose that I pioneer the "drive-up" office hour, as indeed, I 
have done, with tongue in cheek. Doesn't it matter more what is said than where 
it is said? The parking lot happens to be a convenient place to talk, but the 
campus facilities themselves are very pleasant, perfectly adequate to the 
simple needs of the present, not at all "cramped," compared to other, more 
crowded, CSU campuses. What I see at San Marcos is education in its essence, 
free of distractions, with learning alone providing the excitement, a great 
deal of it. 
</P>
<P>
We have only ourselves, what we read and write and say to each other, how we 
help each other understand, and the human community of the mind which those 
activities will form. The students are willing to take up the challenge of that 
experience, and I know that I will learn from it too in ways impossible to 
imagine elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The term "drive-through campus" hurt my students' feelings. After all, no one 
goes to any university to stay, but to change and find a better life. Many of 
the students are "local," true enough, but this experience of active creation 
seems to have a way of insisting on its universal import. They will certainly 
be changed by it because they will be building, out of themselves and their 
locality, a special gift to California. And if many of them choose to stay 
nearby, all the better for them to admire what they have begun, and to 
meditate, as others arrive, on the idea in Wallace Stevens' words that we "left 
what still is the look of things," and that "what we said of it became a part 
of what it is."

PRIVATE SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decisions by San Diego school board members Shirley Weber and Kay Davis to 
send their children to non-public schools ("2 Board Members Put Children in 
Private Schools," Sept. 27) should educate, not shock the public. 
</P>
<P>
Leading scholars on the subject of what it takes to make public schools 
effective increasingly find that this is not possible without the competition 
that non-public schools afford. 
</P>
<P>
One part of the solution to today's educational problem therefore is to offer 
more choice to parents about the schools their children will attend. Weber and 
Davis are fortunate enough to be able to pay for this benefit for their 
children. Low-income parents are systematically denied this chance for the 
betterment for their offspring, however. 
</P>
<P>
The remedy for this unfairness is the voucher system, in which parents receive 
financial warrants they can redeem at schools of their choice for their 
children's education.

SCHOOL DROPS ASSEMBLY BECAUSE OF GROUP'S SCIENTOLOGY LINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The principal of a Sherman Oaks elementary school has canceled an assembly by 
an environmental group because of fears that parents would object to the 
organization's connection with the Church of Scientology. 
</P>
<P>
The Sherman Oaks School's 927 students were scheduled to watch skits and hear 
songs Monday performed by Cry Out, an environmental group affiliated with 
Scientology. The event, which was to include an appearance by child actor Vonni 
Ribisi, was to kick off a yearlong study of environmental issues such as 
recycling and air pollution, Principal Grace Snipper said. Ribisi starred in 
the canceled TV show "My Two Dads." 
</P>
<P>
Snipper said Friday she decided to drop the event, pending review by officials 
of the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The Church of Scientology's self-help ideology is based on the writings of 
science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard, its founder. The church has been 
investigated by federal authorities and is considered by many experts to be a 
cult. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know the first thing about the Church of Scientology, but it would be 
a waste of time to have people worrying about whether or not we are trying to 
expound the teachings of Scientology," Snipper said. "We can teach 
environmental lessons in other ways." 
</P>
<P>
At least one parent raised questions about the group's affiliation with 
Scientology last week, Snipper said. Although she did not believe the 
presentation would be harmful to children, Snipper said she feared more parents 
would object once they found out about the program's connection with the 
controversial religion. 
</P>
<P>
Materials used by Cry Out were prepared by Author Services Inc., the literary 
agency for Hubbard, the late founder of Scientology, according to an 
investigation earlier this year by The Times. Author Services is controlled by 
influential Scientologists, The Times investigation found. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be concerned and understand the concern of parents about exposing 
children to any organization that links back to the Church of Scientology," 
said Cynthia Kisser, executive director of the Chicago-based Cult Awareness 
Network, a national nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
School board member Roberta Weintraub said she agreed with Snipper's decision 
to cancel the event. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it is appropriate for any kind of church or organization like 
this to be on campus, particularly if they are coming under the guise of 
something else," Weintraub said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cry Out booklet makes no mention of Scientology or its teachings. But it 
credits Hubbard with writing the words and music to "Cry Out," a song used as 
an anthem by the group. 
</P>
<P>
A portion of the song includes: "To hell with those whose carelessness in 
pollution is expressed, to hell with forced politics, where victory is only 
death." 
</P>
<P>
Meri Dolan, a Cry Out volunteer who helped Sherman Oaks School officials 
organize the event, said the only connection between the environmental group 
and the Church of Scientology "is L. Ron Hubbard, who wrote the song, 'Cry 
Out.' " 
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no connection with Scientology," Dolan said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Sherman Oaks Parent Assn., a school booster club, spent $600 to 
purchase 1,000 "Cry Out" booklets to distribute to students after Monday's 
assembly. The 48-page color booklet explains the benefits of recycling and 
other forms of conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Levy, co-chairman of the parents group, said he was aware of the link 
between Cry Out and Scientology but supported the assembly because "the program 
itself is great." 
</P>
<P>
"I looked at the booklet and there is no mention of Scientology," Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that bothers me is if it is related to Scientology, why didn't 
they come out and say it?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman Oaks parent Judy London said she approached school officials with the 
idea of bringing the Cry Out presentation to the school after picking up one of 
the group's booklets at the Los Angeles Zoo earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
London said she grew nervous about the group in September when she went to pick 
up 40 booklets to distribute to teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the address they gave me, and it said Author Services Inc. on the 
building but inside you walk into the L. Ron Hubbard Gallery," London said. "I 
asked about the relation and they said there was no relation at all." 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Scholton, principal of Montemalaga Elementary School in the Palos Verdes 
Unified School District, said he was unaware of any connection between Cry Out 
and the Church of Scientology when he agreed to have the presentation at his 
school in June. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very entertaining program, but if I had known the connection I would 
have taken a much closer look at the literature," Scholton said.

THRILLS: AMERICAN COASTER ENTHUSIASTS CONVENE FOR A WEEKEND OF RIDES ON THE 
WILD SIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For Liucija Ambrosini, 44, a well-designed roller coaster is like a complex 
work of art which is best understood after multiple viewings. 
</P>
<P>
Even though she and about 200 other members of the American Coaster Enthusiasts 
club rode the "big four" roller coasters at Magic Mountain for nearly three 
hours straight on Friday night, they were back at it at 8 a.m. on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The club members had gathered at the Valencia theme park Friday night for the 
first portion of their annual national convention. They would move on to San 
Diego late Saturday to ride the 65-year-old Giant Dipper roller coaster -- one 
of just two West Coast seaside coasters -- which recently reopened after 14 
years. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, Ambrosini, a Chicago schoolteacher, rode Viper twice, Ninja 
twice, Revolution three times and Colossus five or six times. But that did not 
dampen her enthusiasm for more on Saturday. "My husband and I will ride a 
really good roller coaster 30 or 40 times," Ambrosini said. 
</P>
<P>
Every roller coaster has subtleties which cannot be appreciated in the heady 
rush of a first or second ride, she said. In addition, the coaster experience 
differs from seat to seat on the train. Sitting at the front of a coaster will 
give the rider a "whoosh" pulling sensation, while sitting in the back gives 
the rider the sensation of being pulled, she said. 
</P>
<P>
While standing in line, Ambrosini confessed that she is afraid of heights. But 
sitting atop the highest point of the giant Colossus, her favorite ride at the 
park, does not disturb her at all. On a roller coaster, she said, she has "a 
wonderful sense of security." 
</P>
<P>
"It is taking me on a wonderful journey," she said. "I love fast turns, great 
drops. They have to have that feel of throwing you out." 
</P>
<P>
Ambrosini, who teaches drama to high school students, and her husband, who 
publishes At the Park and Roller Coaster magazines, have ridden more than 300 
coasters. She has traveled to Japan, Canada and a remote park in England to 
experience new and different rides. She has waited in lines for more than three 
hours to ride a new one on its first day. 
</P>
<P>
Her willingness to travel long distances and brave huge crowds is not unique. 
Coaster enthusiasts from 32 states, including many from the East Coast, 
traveled to Southern California for the ACE national convention this weekend. 
Some ACE members, who all speak a lingo known as "coaster-ese," are not 
interested in just riding coasters. They also study coaster history, 
construction techniques and trivia. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems frivolous, but it is just as viable an alternative as other interests 
that people have," Ambrosini said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she prefers coasters made of wood, like Colossus, rather than those 
made of steel. 
</P>
<P>
"Wood gives when you ride it," she said. "It gives you a feeling like you are 
really inside the ride. You start to be a part of that ride. With a steel 
coaster, you are definitely on a ride." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, wooden roller coasters are affected by the weather and feel 
different in different seasons, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet she also appreciates Magic Mountain's steel coasters' unique qualities. The 
Revolution is well-landscaped with trees that seem to rush at you during the 
ride; the Ninja, which has cars hanging from -- rather than rolling on -- the 
track, gives the rider the sensation of flying, she said. 
</P>
<P>
It is that potential for a magical journey -- away from worldly problems -- 
that is, for Ambrosini, the most appealing aspect of a roller-coaster ride. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of anything else when I am on a ride. It is a total focus, a 
total commitment," Ambrosini said. "That's where the key to all of this lies. 
It is the rarity of an experience that is total. You can't be distracted on a 
roller coaster."

PACOIMA GROUP MEETS TO BUILD RELATIONS BUT FEUDS OVER NAME; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNITY: THE COALITION ELECTS 13 BOARD MEMBERS IN AN EFFORT TO BRIDGE 
DIVISIONS AMONG BLACK CIVIC LEADERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A new coalition whose purpose is to heal a rift in Pacoima's black community 
elected 13 board members and picked a name Saturday, but not before its members 
exchanged a few heated words. 
</P>
<P>
The disagreement among about 25 people who attended a community meeting called 
by the coalition was over what to call the group and who should be allowed to 
join it. 
</P>
<P>
"How are we going to come together if we can't even get past the name," said a 
frustrated William Huling, a longtime community activist who chaired the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of a name was the first item on the agenda. But it was Huling who 
started the disagreement when he said that Marie Harris, head of the Pacoima 
Property Owners Assn., did not favor one of the three suggested names -- the 
Pacoima African-American Coalition. Harris did not attend Saturday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason we should be ashamed to identify with Africa," said an 
angry Thomas Montgomery, who identified himself as Democratic Party chairman of 
the 39th Assembly District, which includes Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
"Every other ethnic group has its own organization," said Montgomery, waving 
his arms. "Why can't we? I'm proud to be black." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Pacoima African-American Coalition was selected unanimously over 
the other two names -- Pacoima Advisory Council and Pacoima Action Council. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows we are in total agreement at last," Huling said, sighing. 
</P>
<P>
The rift among Pacoima's black leaders surfaced last month when the Ministers' 
Fellowship of the San Fernando Valley threatened to mount a recall drive 
against Los Angeles Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who they claim reneged on a 
campaign promise to appoint a black field deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Bernardi appointed Richard Packard, head of the Black American 
Political Assn., as a field representative, a position that ranks below a 
deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi supporters sharply criticized the ministers group, which represents 
about 40 churches in the northeast San Fernando Valley, for its attack on the 
councilman. One critic said the ministers should stay out of politics and 
remain in the pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
The ministers group has since backed off on its threat to recall Bernardi and 
has pledged to work with the coalition and Packard. 
</P>
<P>
Huling, a counselor and psychology professor at Cal State Northridge who was 
elected spokesman of the coalition, said the organization represents the first 
step toward "a total community effort. The black community was too fragmented." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Huling repeatedly silenced those who tried to criticize the 
ministers. "All that's behind us now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the objection to the name, Pacoima African-American Council, he 
said, was that Harris wanted other ethnic groups to be able to participate. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see that this will exclude anyone," said Jose de Sosa, head of the 
state and San Fernando Valley NAACP, referring to the new organization. He 
noted that people of different ethnic backgrounds belong to the NAACP, even 
though it "has the word 'colored' in its name." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Augustus, a coalition organizer, said he envisioned a black coalition 
because "we've first got to learn to live among ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
The 13 board members include representatives of nine community groups and four 
individuals. They will now meet to write bylaws for the coalition. The bylaws 
will be voted on at a community meeting next month. 
</P>
<P>
"Congratulations," said Huling, as the meeting ended. "You now have an 
organization -- finally."

GUNMAN YELLS 'WHITE POWER' BEFORE INJURING 4 AT PARTY IN TARZANA; 
</P>
<P>
VIOLENCE: POLICE LATER ARREST A CANOGA PARK MAN AND CALL THE ATTACK 'RACIALLY 
MOTIVATED.' TWO OF THE VICTIMS ARE REPORTED IN SERIOUS CONDITION.

<P>
Four people were injured when a gunman shouted, "White power!" and fired into a 
crowd of party-goers outside a house in Tarzana, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred about 11:45 p.m. Friday in the 4700 block of Hermano 
Drive, a sloping cul-de-sac lined with expensive houses, including a gated 
mansion at the top of the hill, Los Angeles Police Officer Victor Monroe said. 
The attack was "racially motivated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A white man on foot shouted the slogan and then fired into a group of people 
outside the house, Monroe said. Two of those injured were hospitalized in 
serious but stable condition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 to 300 people attended the racially mixed party, Monroe said. 
</P>
<P>
Police refused to identify the victims, their race or the hospital or hospitals 
where they were taken. Richard Perelman, a neighbor and the owner of a 
furniture store, said he heard six shots and then teen-agers knocked on his 
door, crying and screaming for him to call an ambulance, which he did. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tragic -- the kids were really shook up," Perelman said. "We don't 
expect that in this neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the incident, police arrested Jeffrey Scott Johnson, 20, of 
Canoga Park at his residence on suspicion of attempted murder. Monroe would not 
disclose what caused police to suspect Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was being held without bail Saturday at the West Valley Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Palmer, manager of the apartment complex in the 20000 block of Leadwell 
Street where Johnson lives with his girlfriend and infant daughter, described 
Johnson as an affable San Fernando Valley native. Palmer said Johnson worked 
with his stepfather installing air-conditioning devices and that he and Johnson 
had a beer together the night of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got the wrong guy," Palmer said. "To say that Jeff would take a gun 
and yell, 'White supremacy,' well, he just isn't that type of guy."

VIEWS ON FRYMAN CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was shocked and saddened to read the rather vituperative letter from Mr. 
George Calonyannidies opposing the public purchase of Fryman Canyon. Mr. 
Calonyannidies' comments betray that he has never visited the canyon. He also 
has evidently not been reading reports in The Times very carefully, as he made 
several factual errors. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-acre portion of the property which was to have been dedicated to the 
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy is in litigation, as the open-space land was 
never transferred to the conservancy, though purchase of the entire property 
will no doubt supersede litigation. 
</P>
<P>
And it is in fact the remaining "not particularly exciting" 31 acres which are 
of the greatest "scenic value," crucial to the ecosystem of the canyon. The 
entire canyon must be preserved as a whole in order to maintain both its scenic 
beauty and its value as a wildlife sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
As to the suggestion that land cleared to build a 12-foot-wide haul road could 
be "restored to its original condition," that is patently ridiculous, as anyone 
familiar with delicate chaparral habitat would know. 
</P>
<P>
Public purchase of Fryman Canyon is a win/win consensus solution, in which a 
developer, local politicians, state officials and the public have come together 
to preserve a valuable part of our natural heritage. 
</P>
<P>
I can only suggest that Mr. Calonyannidies will feel differently if he takes 
the time to walk in Fryman Canyon and enjoy its rich wildlife and serene 
atmosphere on a dew-drenched morning or in a golden sunset.

COUNCIL MEMBERS LAUNCH CAMPAIGN FOR PARK BONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A quorum of San Diego City Council members competed Saturday with the shouts of 
soccer players and the roar of climbing airliners to launch the campaign in 
support of Proposition E, a $100-million city park bond measure on the Nov. 6 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"We're legal," said Mayor Maureen O'Connor, referring to the unofficial 
gathering of a majority of the nine-member council, "because we have already 
voted on this issue. And it was a unanimous vote." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor and council members Ron Roberts, John Hartley, Abbe Wolfsheimer and 
Linda Bernhardt preached the need for the citywide park bond issue to a group 
of about 50 faithful at Robb Field in Ocean Beach. The mayor also unveiled 
artwork by Theodor Geisel -- who is Dr. Seuss -- which will be the official 
campaign poster and slogan. It depicts a cluster of houses and other buildings 
and a single green tree, with the slogan: "Leave Something Green." Geisel, who 
has endorsed the bond measure, gave the city permission to use his work. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts warned the group of community leaders that it would take "a concerted 
grass-roots effort" to pass the bond issue because of the large number of other 
issues, including state bond issues on the November ballot. He stressed that, 
unlike the state bond measures, Proposition E funds would be used locally. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who has taken on leadership of the campaign, said that 30% of the bond 
money will go for acquisition of regional parks in the Otay River, San Dieguito 
River and Tijuana River valleys and the remainder will go for improvements in 
existing parks and development of city green-spots where none now exist. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters include community groups, business associations and environmental 
groups. Advocates point out that the bond issue will cost property owners $16 a 
year for each $100,000 of assessed property value -- less than the monthly cost 
for cable television service.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
TO REJECT BUDGET PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 179 to 254, the House rejected the fiscal plan forged by President 
Bush and congressional leaders to cut deficit spending by $500 billion over 
five years through tax hikes and spending restraint. Republicans voted 71 for 
and 105 against and Democrats 108 to 149, sending government leaders in search 
of more politically acceptable fiscal solutions. 
</P>
<P>
The measure sought to raise the Medicare payroll tax as well as taxes on 
tobacco, alcoholic beverages, gasoline, luxury items, plane tickets and other 
items, and to curb or cut spending in the defense budget, Medicare, farm 
subsidies, civil service retirement and scores of other federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives directed much of their criticism at the tax increases, while 
liberals said the plan favored the wealthy at the expense of people in poverty 
and on fixed incomes. Moderates also found much in it they disliked. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to side with the President and bipartisan Capitol Hill 
leadership and support the deficit-reduction plan. 
</P>
<P>
How They Voted 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bates (D): Nay 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Hunter (R): Nay

</P>
<P>
Rep. Packard (R): Nay 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Back the President 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 380 to 39, the House approved a resolution (HJ Res 658) endorsing 
President Bush's military and diplomatic response to Iraq's takeover of Kuwait. 
Although far outnumbered by backers of the President, critics argued that both 
he and Congress have disregarded the War Powers Act. 
</P>
<P>
That post-Vietnam law requires Capitol Hill approval, within 60 days of 
deployment, of military actions in which combat appears imminent. The troops 
are to be brought home if Congress fails to provide a green light. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Dante B. Fascell (D-Fla.) said the measure "congratulates the 
President" but is not blanket approval into the future. 
</P>
<P>
Les AuCoin (D-Ore.) said the measure evades the War Powers Act and is 
"uncomfortably reminiscent of Lyndon Johnson's Gulf of Tonkin resolution," 
passed by the Senate during early Vietnam hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote endorsed Bush's policies against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
How They Voted 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bates (D): Nay 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Hunter (R): Yea 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Lowery (R): Yea 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Packard (R): Yea 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Accept More Immigrants 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 231 to 192, the House passed a bill (HR 4300) increasing from 
540,000 to at least 775,000 the number of legal immigrants the United States 
will let in each year. This sent the bill to conference with a Senate bill 
raising the ceiling to 630,000. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is most favorable to foreigners with needed job skills, more than 
tripling the cap on employment-based visas. Most of the bill's other new slots 
would go to foreigners with family members in the United States and immigrants 
from European and African countries that in recent decades have had 
comparatively low quotas. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.) said the bill recognizes that "the education and 
skills of the U.S. labor force will be unable to match labor market needs." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent John Bryant (D-Tex.), called the bill ill-advised at a time when "we 
cannot pay our bills, we have an enormous crime rate (and) an education system 
straining under its burden." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to pass the bill. 
</P>
<P>
How They Voted

Orchid fanciers will find many plant varieties and hundreds of blooms at the 
South Coast Botanic Garden today from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. as the South Bay 
Orchid Society concludes its 10th annual fall show. Prize-winning plants -- 
chosen by judges for such attributes as bloom and color -- will be on display, 
and orchid nurseries will sell blooming plants and seedlings. 
</P>
<P>
Show chairman James Weiss said the show -- which drew 2,000 people last year -- 
gives orchid growers "an opportunity to bring in blooming plants and have a lot 
of people admire them." Orchid society members will be on hand to answer 
questions, and there will be videos on orchid culture. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss said growing orchids is a popular and challenging hobby: "They're not 
difficult to grow, but they are demanding" in their requirements for water, 
feeding, humidity and warmth. Some orchid varieties also require patience. "It 
can be four to eight years before you see the first bloom," Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
The botanic garden is located at 26300 Crenshaw Blvd. on the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula. Admission is $3 for adults, $1.50 for seniors and students and 75 
cents for children 5 to 12. GERALD FARIS

Former White House political adviser Lyn Nofziger said Friday his successors 
serving President Bush have created a "public relations disaster" on the budget 
debate over the tax issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that what we're seeing is a need for consistency, and that's what we 
haven't seen here in the last week and it's too bad because the President is 
really better than that," said Nofziger. 
</P>
<P>
Nofziger, who was a member of President Reagan's inner circle, was interviewed 
on the "Fox Morning News" about the White House's apparent changes of position 
during the budget debate.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: KILLER OF 2 GETS LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge Friday sentenced a former security guard to two terms of 
life in prison without possibility of parole for murdering two men in front of 
his Inglewood apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
In August, a jury convicted Ahmad Grigsby, 29, of two counts of first-degree 
murder with special circumstances in the March 17, 1989, shooting deaths of 
Terry Goring and Raymond Rodriguez at Grigsby's apartment building on Firmona 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, witnesses testified that Grigsby shot Goring in the chest 
without provocation and then shot him a second time in the head as Goring 
pleaded for his life. Witnesses also testified that Grigsby shot the second 
victim, Rodriguez, in the head as he leaned over to help Goring. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors could have recommended the death penalty for Grigsby, but after 
testimony that Grigsby is mentally unstable, they decided that he should not 
die for the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Grigsby's attorney, Robert Doddy, sought a new trial on the grounds that the 
court did not instruct the jury to consider manslaughter charges. Judge Francis 
Hourigan denied his motion. Doddy said he will appeal Grigsby's conviction. 
</P>
<P>
In his address to Hourigan, Grigsby apologized, saying: "I can't turn back what 
has happened. . . . I'm sorry for this problem that has occurred." 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Goring's widow, Elizabeth, 32, asked to address the court. "I 
have a 3-year-old son who wants to know why his father was hurt and had to go 
to heaven," she tearfully said to Grigsby. "And for you to stand there and say 
you're sorry, I wish you would go to hell because it's just not fair."

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COACH GETS 3 YEARS FOR MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Lawndale Little League coach was sentenced in Torrance Superior Court 
Thursday to three years in state prison for molesting two of his team members. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Steese, 34, pleaded no contest in June to two misdemeanor counts of 
molesting the boys, who were 10 and 11 when the incidents occurred last 
December and April at Steese's home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence imposed by Judge John P. Shook was less than the five-year term 
recommended by Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Geltz. Steese's conviction marks the 
second time in two years that a league volunteer has been arrested for 
molestation. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Lawndale Little League team manager William Anthony Boguille, 
23, pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor counts of sexual battery for 
regularly pulling down his players' pants to spank them. Boguille, who denied 
that those events constituted molestation, was ordered to perform community 
service and was placed on three years' probation.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LIMITS ON FILM CREWS PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Film crews working in downtown San Pedro would face new restrictions on 
shooting schedules and parking under a proposal unveiled last week by the 
community's Downtown Business Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions include forbidding outdoor filming two weeks before Christmas 
and parking by film crews within the downtown area bounded by 5th and 7th 
streets, between Center Street and Pacific Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal follows a survey of downtown merchants showing continued support 
for filming in the community if restrictions are enacted. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to strike a compromise between the business owners and the film 
industry," association President William Manuel said. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand some filming will occur. We also understand it sometimes 
interferes with businesses," Manuel said. "We're not going to be able to avoid 
all of the problems, but we hope these restrictions will avoid some." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed restrictions on filming will be sent to the Los Angeles city Board 
of Public Works, where officials have expressed a willingness to consider 
restrictions, Manuel said.

TEEN ARRESTED IN SLAYING OF SERVICEMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Compton teen-ager was arrested last week on suspicion of murder and attempted 
murder in the shooting death of an Air Force enlisted man as the airman sat in 
a car at a Torrance intersection with friends, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Moore, 18, allegedly shot Daryl J. Webb, 20, of Compton on Hawthorne 
Boulevard after Webb either glanced at Moore's girlfriend or made a comment to 
her outside South Bay Bowl, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Moore's arraignment in South Bay Municipal Court was delayed Wednesday until 
Oct. 17. He is being held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Webb and three friends, who left the bowling alley shortly before midnight 
because it was closing, were sitting at a stoplight near Hawthorne and Artesia 
Boulevard when Moore and his girlfriend pulled up next to them. Moore, a member 
of a Compton gang, allegedly flashed gang signs at the group and fired at them 
with a .38-caliber revolver. Webb, who was stationed at Nellis Air Force Base 
in Las Vegas, was the only person injured, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
Although Webb's friends were not injured, the attempted murder charges against 
Moore are the result of firing at them. 
</P>
<P>
Police filed a complaint of accessory to murder against Moore's 17-year-old 
girlfriend, whose name was not released because of her age. She is being held 
at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they identified Moore after local television stations broadcast a 
videotape of him taken by a remote camera outside the bowling alley. 
Investigators received several anonymous telephone calls, two of which led to 
the identification of Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Moore was arrested Monday afternoon in Lynwood, and his girlfriend was arrested 
later the same day in Los Angeles.

MEMORIAL HELD FOR STEVE MORRIS, SAN PEDRO COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Memorial services were held Saturday for Steve Morris, the longtime San Pedro 
High School teacher and coach who died of a heart attack last week only minutes 
after jogging with members of the girls soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
The death Wednesday afternoon of Morris, 51, stunned his colleagues and the 
campus where he had taught science since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a complete shock," said Chris Nagle, chairman of the school's science 
department. "He had just run two laps, sat down on the bench and just 
collapsed." 
</P>
<P>
Morris, a boxing champion at Stanford University, was remembered by his 
principal and fellow teachers as an energetic instructor who often traveled 
between his San Pedro home and school by bicycle. The school's first boys 
soccer coach, Morris for a time chaired the school's athletic department and 
was responsible for reinstituting the girls soccer team several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But his real interest was teaching. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy was really dedicated. He enjoyed the coaching and spent a lot of time 
on that. But science was his first love," Principal Joe Viola said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Stan Franklin, another longtime science teacher: "Teaching was his first 
love. I remember someone asked us recently if we had to do it over again, what 
we would do. And he said he wouldn't change a thing. He thought that much of 
teaching." 
</P>
<P>
Morris is survived by his wife, Anne; son, Josh, and daughter, Stephanie. 
</P>
<P>
The school's faculty has established a scholarship fund in Morris' memory.

HEARINGS SET ON MOBIL PLAN FOR PIPELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An ambitious plan to build a 92-mile underground pipeline to carry heated crude 
oil through the Santa Clarita and San Fernando valleys to the Mobil Oil 
refinery in Torrance will be the subject of three public hearings this week on 
the project's environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil Oil Corp. plans to replace an aging pipeline, parts of it 55 years old, 
with a 16-inch-diameter line capable of carrying 95,000 barrels of crude each 
day from Lebec in Kern County to the refinery in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance officials say they are monitoring the project, particularly any 
changes it would create in the refinery's operations. 
</P>
<P>
The draft environmental impact report, released last month, said that despite 
the pipeline's increased capacity, Mobil would continue to process about 
120,000 barrels a day at the Torrance refinery. 
</P>
<P>
The report said pipeline construction would create noise and cause unavoidable 
disruptions of traffic at major intersections along the route. 
</P>
<P>
But the report said the new line would be safer than the deteriorating line it 
would replace, which ruptured two times within three weeks in 1988, spilling 
more than 130,000 gallons of oil in Encino and Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The first hearing will be held Monday at William S. Hart High School, 24825 N. 
Newhall Ave., in Santa Clarita. Fulton Junior High School, at 7477 Kester Ave. 
in Van Nuys, will be the site of the second hearing on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The third hearing will be held Thursday at Culver City High School, 4401 Elenda 
St. All hearings are scheduled from 7 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Cude, an engineer with the Los Angeles Department of Transportation, said 
Friday that the purpose of the hearings is to gather the public's comments on 
the conclusions and recommendations contained in the environmental impact 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance City Manager LeRoy Jackson said Torrance city planners will attend one 
of the hearings this week. Mobil has withdrawn its application for the portion 
of the pipeline within Torrance but is expected to refile the application, 
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
The pipeline would also pass through Inglewood, where city officials believe 
the major impact would come during construction, said Norman Cravens, assistant 
city manager. Inglewood planners and engineers are studying the project. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental report is considered a draft until the comments collected at 
the public hearings are studied and addressed in the final document. Cude said 
city traffic engineers hope to forward the final report to the Los Angeles 
Board of Transportation Commissioners by Dec. 13, when the panel could make a 
final decision on the project.

IRVINE AND THE NEW BARCLAY, TAKE A BOW; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER PROJECT FOUNDERED MANY TIMES BEFORE BECOMING A TRIUMPH OF COOPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took 17 years to do it, but the 756-seat Irvine Barclay Theatre at long last 
has opened its doors to the public. The $17.6-million theater is a tribute to 
an extraordinary cooperative effort by UC Irvine, the city and civic-minded 
Orange County residents that should provide a model for other communities. 
</P>
<P>
The theater will be home to UCI and local community productions, as well as to 
a lively program of musical and other events to be coordinated by the theater's 
nonprofit operating company. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the offerings have been eclectic -- the South Coast Symphony, the 
National Theatre of the Deaf and singer Judy Collins among them. Coming this 
year will be theater, dance, civic light opera and mime performances, as well 
as classical and popular musical events. All told, there will be 100,000 seats 
to fill in the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
The theater is just the right size and configuration to fill in the gap between 
the much larger Orange County Performing Arts Center and the county's smaller 
theaters and concert halls. 
</P>
<P>
However worthy the building or the programming, top billing belongs to the 
cooperation that allowed the theater to come into being at all. UCI, which 
provided the 2.3-acre site, helped with private fund raising and also chipped 
in $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Corporations and individuals -- including million-dollar donors Richard and 
Marjorie Barclay, for whom the theater was named, and Arlene and George Cheng, 
who contributed $750,000 -- are committed to raise $4.8 million over the next 
five years. And the city appropriated $11.3 million in voter-approved bond 
money. 
</P>
<P>
One UCI administrator commented that he learned that projects don't start when 
bulldozers begin to dig out a construction site but, "when the City Council 
votes, 5-0." He might also have said things happen when a city's residents are 
persuaded that cultural offerings are as valuable as municipal services. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not all communities are fortunate enough to have a major university 
at hand to provide the cultural and fund-raising resources for a facility such 
as the Irvine Barclay Theatre. But not all communities would have picked up the 
gauntlet thrown down by UCI when it offered the acreage for the facility on its 
campus. Irvine did, to its great credit. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a project that foundered many times before it came to fruition. All 
involved in helping Irvine Barclay Theatre become a reality deserve to bask in 
the spotlight.

TAX INCREASE SMALL PRICE TO PAY TO STOP CANYON'S DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The residents of Laguna Beach are expected to vote to increase their property 
taxes via a $20-million bond issue to provide a significant part of the funds 
to purchase the Irvine Co.'s Laguna Laurel development land in Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Monies will also be contributed by the county -- $2 million per year for five 
years. Thus, through the leadership and generosity of the residents of Laguna 
Beach, the county will have a wilderness park for pennies on the dollar. The 
acquired Laguna Laurel area is to be administered as part of the county's 
wilderness park system. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Laurel area is close to the county's Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional 
Park and Crystal Cove State Park, which are significant parts of the Laguna 
Greenbelt. The Laguna Laurel area is in the heart of the Laguna Greenbelt, and 
its preservation is essential to provide wildlife a habitat that is large 
enough for a thriving ecosystem. This is the "central park" for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations are the results of cooperative efforts of Laguna Beach, led by 
Mayor Lida Lenney and Councilman Robert F. Gentry, the Irvine Co., the county 
and environmental groups. The letters you printed indicate that other Orange 
County cities are being taken advantage of, with preferential treatment being 
given to Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Canyon Conservancy president Carolyn Wood said the acquisition of Laguna 
Laurel is a "win for everyone." Hopefully, the Irvine Co. will accrue goodwill. 
Pollution and congestion will be reduced preventing degradation to the quality 
of life for residents of Laguna Beach and other cities. And Orange County will 
get a wilderness park with a small contribution of county funds. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure the county's park people will be eager to scrape up funds to acquire 
open space near other cities willing to tax themselves to provide a greater 
portion of the money. Those of us in Laguna Beach would be overjoyed to support 
such actions in this county, which otherwise has development running amok.

CAREERS OF CONTROVERSIAL ARTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re John and Ernie Feeney's relationship with the Costa Mesa Council and the 
arts: I have to say that if I had anything in the least bit controversial to 
present to that community, I'd certainly want that couple on my marketing team. 
</P>
<P>
Who could ask for better publicity? 
</P>
<P>
They and judges and juries of Florida (they seem to have replaced being banned 
in Boston) have done more to help along the careers of both good and lousy 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
One could certainly argue that 2 Live Crew's and Robert Mapplethorpe's names 
would have been on the lips of only a few had not such folk made such a to-do 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
I wish I could get my adrenaline up about such matters! 
</P>
<P>
But I just seem to find myself concerned about such minor matters as Iraq, the 
budget, the health-care crisis, the lack of response from our state and elected 
officials, the homeless, the lack of child care and of mental health-care 
services, a foundering educational system and that bugaboo that's been 
relegated to the back pages and isn't even mentioned on TV any more -- the 
savings and loan crisis!

MAN SHOT, WOUNDED AFTER FIRING AT POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale man who was shot by police after he fired a gun at two officers was 
in critical condition Saturday, Glendale police reported. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who was not identified, was wounded several times in the upper torso 
about 11:30 p.m. Friday, Lt. Mark Distaso said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were called to the man's residence in southwest Glendale about 11:30 
p.m. by paramedics because the man was waving a gun at them, Distaso said. 
</P>
<P>
The paramedics were attempting to treat the man, who is in his mid-60s, for a 
diabetes-related problem when he pulled a gun and threatened them, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The two uniformed officers who went to the house were met by the man "who was 
standing just inside the door to his home," Distaso said. "He was still holding 
the gun." 
</P>
<P>
The man had refused to heed "numerous orders" by police to drop the gun when he 
fired once at the two officers, Distaso said. 
</P>
<P>
"The officers returned fire and struck the suspect several times in the upper 
torso area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither officer was injured. Their names were withheld pending an internal 
Police Department investigation, Distaso said. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded man was treated by paramedics at the scene, then taken to Glendale 
Memorial Hospital, where he remained in critical condition. His name was not 
released, because police said they were having difficulty notifying his 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even know if he has any family," Distaso said. "We're trying to find 
somebody." 
</P>
<P>
He said the man apparently was alone at the time of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics said they had treated the man for various medical problems several 
times in the past.

The wanton desecration that Tony Moiso has planned for Arroyo Trabuco will 
steal from every Orange County resident our greatest inheritances and 
treasures. 
</P>
<P>
With thousands of acres of undeveloped land, we would hope that he could muster 
enough restraint to set back a few hundred feet to preserve this pristine 
natural habitat. 
</P>
<P>
And now if the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors cannot be 
trusted to stop the pillaging of these beautiful wild lands, then it is clear 
that they have no intentions of protecting any of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Santa Margarita brags to be "Where the West Begins Again." I submit 
that it may have to be labeled "Where the West Ends Forever."

In "Development Perils Wildlife, Study Says" (Oct. 7), Tony Moiso of the 
Mission Viejo Co. says "this is not Yellowstone" to justify his opposition to a 
500-foot setback from oak-studded Arroyo Trabuco. 
</P>
<P>
However, deterioration in an urban forest within 500 feet of development can be 
observed less than a year after a project is completed, says arborist Alden 
Kelley of the Orange County Tree Society. 
</P>
<P>
For a resource of Yellowstone's stature, setbacks are measured in miles, not 
feet.

'SCENT OF FEAR' AT THE LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Dana Parsons' column "Scent of Fear Sends Scribe to Library Seeking Answers" 
(Oct. 3): Dana Parsons' humorous attempt at looking at the Santa Ana Library 
issue fell flat. 
</P>
<P>
To him it may be a situation of levity, but to those directly involved, it's 
mighty serious. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Mr. Parsons has never worked in an environment in which staff has been 
afraid to come to work the next day because of tension in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
The library staff and library board have been attempting to resolve this 
volatile situation for two years. 
</P>
<P>
An axiom of sociology is that if someone perceives something to be real/true, 
then for them it is real/true, regardless of what others think. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if Mr. Parsons would have taken the same cavalier approach had the 
issue concerned another department -- perhaps the police or even The Times. I 
think not. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe next time when Mr. Parsons goes to the library, instead of checking out 
"The Mutants Are Coming," he might check "An Introduction to Good Investigative 
Reporting," a book that might offer a resolution to a pressing issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
Now that all the hoopla for the Orange County airport has died down, let's stop 
and realize that this airport is basically just for the rich. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, four friends and I decided to spend a weekend in Scottsdale. 
</P>
<P>
Flights from Ontario, Long Beach and Los Angeles airports averaged between $48 
and $68. The same flight out of Orange County was $220. Moreover, the cost of 
overnight parking is ridiculously high. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, my friends and I will be driving past John Wayne Airport on 
our way to Los Angeles International Airport (and adding to the rush-hour 
gridlock) because the air fares are too high for us middle-class peons. 
</P>
<P>
Another thought. All the executives in my office demand that we secretaries 
book their flights out of John Wayne Airport when they are traveling for 
company business. 
</P>
<P>
However, when these same executives are planning their vacations and thus every 
nickel is their own, they make sure their flights are out of any airport but 
Orange County.

WOMAN SURVIVES 150-FOOT PLUNGE FROM P.V. CLIFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Hawthorne woman winding up a low-key birthday celebration early Saturday with 
a visit to a Palos Verdes Peninsula cliff accidentally stepped off the edge, 
falling 150 feet before becoming entangled in brush, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Annette Wilson, 40, underwent surgery Saturday at Harbor UCLA Medical 
Center in Torrance, a hospital official said. 
</P>
<P>
The official declined to detail the woman's injuries but said she was in 
serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, Wilson and a male friend were sitting at the edge of a 
cliff in the 1700 block of Paseo Del Mar in Palos Verdes Estates when Wilson 
stood up, stepped backward, and plunged 150 feet. Earlier, the pair had spent a 
quiet evening dining at a Torrance restaurant to celebrate Wilson's 40th 
birthday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Brush growing at the side of the cliff, 50 feet from the bottom, broke Wilson's 
fall, said Ed Jaakola, a lieutenant with the Palos Verdes Estates Police 
Department. "That brush probably saved her life," Jaakola said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics reached Wilson at about 4 a.m., he said, lowering her to the bottom 
of the cliff and sending her to the hospital aboard a Los Angeles County Fire 
Department helicopter.

KINGS POKE BIG HOLES IN BRUINS; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: BOSTON COMES IN LEADING NHL IN DEFENSE, LEAVES FORUM WITH A 7-1 LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Think of the Boston Bruins and the first thing that usually comes to mind is 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Tight-checking, hard-hitting defense. 
</P>
<P>
This is the team that gave up the fewest goals in the NHL last season. 
</P>
<P>
This is the team that held off the Edmonton Oilers for nearly six periods last 
spring in the opener of the Stanley Cup finals before losing. 
</P>
<P>
But that image was shattered by a 7-1 King victory before a sellout crowd of 
16,005 at the Forum Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins came into the game as the league's only unbeaten club at 4-0-1 and 
the best defensive squad, having given up nine goals. 
</P>
<P>
But with one thunderous performance, the Kings had nearly equaled the efforts 
of five previous Boston opponents. Saturday's victory pushed the Kings into 
first place in the Smythe Division at 3-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice when you look back and get a point on Edmonton and then play Boston, 
the two teams that were in the Stanley Cup finals," said Coach Tom Webster, 
whose Kings came back with two goals in the last 91 seconds Thursday night to 
tie the Oilers. "I think it's quite an accomplishment for the hockey club." 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way were Wayne Gretzky and backup goalie Daniel Berthiaume. Gretzky 
had two goals and two assists. That followed a five-point night, including the 
game-tying goal, against Edmonton, giving Gretzky nine points in two games and 
13 in five games this season. 
</P>
<P>
He needs eight points to reach 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
While Gretzky was the star on offense, the hero at the other end of the ice for 
the Kings was Berthiaume. 
</P>
<P>
Filling in for starter Kelly Hrudey, Berthiaume stopped 40 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"He's proven he can play in this league by his performance with Winnipeg," 
Webster said of the goalie the Kings obtained from the Winnipeg Jets in a trade 
for Craig Duncanson on the eve of training camp. "It was a matter of him 
getting the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky began in spectacular fashion in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Skating into the right corner with his back to the Boston net, Gretzky managed 
to slip a no-look pass to Tony Granato in the slot. 
</P>
<P>
From there, Granato slammed his third goal of the season past the stick of 
goalie Reggie Lemelin after 1:41. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings struck again at the 15:12 mark, this time on the power play. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Steve Duchesne scored for the first time this season. He was 
minus-four entering play Saturday and had spent the better part of Thursday's 
game against the Oilers in the clubhouse after being ejected for high sticking. 
</P>
<P>
But he was back on the ice Saturday and making the most of it. With six seconds 
remaining on the power play, Duchesne squeezed between two defenders into the 
slot, took a soft shot that was blocked by Lemelin, and then put in the 
rebound. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky got an assist on the play, then scored the Kings' third goal at 19:12. 
Taking the puck at the left corner of the Boston net after a missed shot by 
Granato, Gretzky found Boston's Dave Poulin on his back. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, he skated around Lemelin, carrying Poulin with him, to the right 
side, where Gretzky flipped in his fourth goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins' only goal came at 17:42 of the second period after the Kings' Brian 
Benning had knocked the puck off the stick of Craig Janney. 
</P>
<P>
John Carter gained control and shoved the puck in from the left side, past 
Berthiaume, who had fallen to his knees. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings kept their offensive momentum going in the second period, scoring 
after nine seconds. 
</P>
<P>
With Todd Elik and Dave Taylor benched for the night, the second line consisted 
of Luc Robitaille on one wing and Francois Breault on the other with Steve 
Kasper in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
That line got the Kings' fourth goal, Robitaille carrying the puck down the 
left side before passing it to Breault, charging in from the right. 
</P>
<P>
Breault scored on a rising wrist shot past a diving Lemelin. 
</P>
<P>
For the 23-year-old Breault, a rookie who spent the last two seasons with the 
New Haven Nighthawks, it was NHL goal No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings extended their lead to 5-1 by scoring 7:20 into the final period. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Buskas took a shot that wound up in a crowd in front of the net. There, Jay 
Miller nudged the puck to Bob Kudelski on the left side. Kudelski promptly put 
it past Lemelin for his second goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
That was it for Lemelin. 
</P>
<P>
And, as it turned out, for the Bruins.

BRUINS RUN AZTECS INTO THE GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After awhile, the days begin to run together. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the San Diego State defense goes out and gives up enough yardage 
for two games. 
</P>
<P>
The next week, SDSU coaches work the defense hard in practice, talk about the 
need to focus rather than make mass personnel changes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And then it's Saturday again. And you know what that means. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA did it to the Aztecs this week, 45-31, before 41,025 in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the Aztec offense was a sight to behold, and once again, the Aztec 
defense was graffiti on a wall. 
</P>
<P>
"UCLA was here." 
</P>
<P>
"For a good run, call 111-SDSU." 
</P>
<P>
"Score some points on the Aztecs." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, SDSU (2-4) came up with a defensive combination that 
included just two linemen on apparent passing downs and a combination of 
linebackers and defensive backs. It didn't matter. On the first play SDSU used 
the combination, UCLA quarterback Tommy Maddox scrambled 11 yards around left 
end for a first down. That was on second and nine. 
</P>
<P>
Seven plays later, on second and eight, SDSU tried it again, and this time 
Maddox passed 25 yards to Shawn Wills. 
</P>
<P>
New look, same old defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs didn't intercept a pass, which isn't exactly a news flash. They have 
now played 24 quarters this season and watched 191 passes fly by without 
picking one off. 
</P>
<P>
And, your weekly SDSU non-defense tidbit Part I: UCLA's Brian Brown finished 
with 175 yards rushing, the most for a Bruin since Gaston Green ran for 220 
against Cal in 1987. He also had two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Part II: Kevin Smith carried 26 times for 105 yards and a touchdown. This 
marked the first time UCLA had two running backs rush for 100 or more yards in 
a game since Green (266) and Marcus Greenwood (104) did it in the 1986 Freedom 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (3-3) finished with 376 yards rushing, and all six of the Bruins' 
touchdowns came on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
So much for SDSU's game plan of taking away the pass and making UCLA run. 
</P>
<P>
On the bright side, SDSU quarterback Dan McGwire completed 23 of 46 passes for 
343 yards and three touchdowns. His streak of consecutive passes thrown without 
an interception was broken, however, at 178 when Eric Turner picked off a pass 
on the last play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Rowe caught 11 of McGwire's passes for 224 yards and a touchdown. The 
224 yards was a career best and ranks sixth in SDSU history. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs trailed at the half, 35-21, but it could have been worse. With only 
three seconds to play and SDSU trailing, 35-14, and 38 yards from the UCLA end 
zone, Rowe somehow slipped open -- for just a second -- in the deep right 
corner of the end zone. McGwire found him, cocked, fired and . . . touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire-to-Rowe was the hot first-half combination for the Aztecs. McGwire 
completed 13 of 22 first-half passes for 229 yards and three touchdowns, and 
Rowe caught five of those passes for 144 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU got off to a typical start. Its offense moved forward in the first half, 
and its defense moved backward. In the first 15 minutes, SDSU and UCLA combined 
for 308 yards of total offense -- UCLA 160, SDSU 148. UCLA had nine first downs 
during that time. 
</P>
<P>
And by halftime, UCLA running back Brian Brown had 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins scored touchdowns on four of their first five and five of their 
first seven possessions. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs, as has been their custom, remained within striking distance. 
</P>
<P>
Each team traded two first-quarter touchdowns. UCLA scored first, thanks to an 
SDSU fumble. Dennis Arey lost the ball at the SDSU 28 after catching a 
three-yard McGwire pass, and Stacy Argo fell on it. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Maddox rolled right and then pitched to Brown, who went in 
for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
A nightmare for the Aztecs? Earlier this week, Luginbill said one of his fears 
was that SDSU might not maintain its impressive record of avoiding turnovers. 
Going into the game, the Aztecs had lost only one fumble. 
</P>
<P>
"If we come in with offensive breakdowns in ball protection, it would create a 
real problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fumble came only 39 seconds into the game, and UCLA scored 1:09 later. 
</P>
<P>
In less than two minutes, the Aztecs already were in the comeback mode. 
</P>
<P>
The SDSU offense shrugged, and went to work. Six plays later, McGwire passed 11 
yards for a touchdown to Arey, and it was 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
So UCLA got the ball back, and the most noteworthy thing about that was that it 
took them 12 plays to move 80 yards for a touchdown. That came on a one-yard 
Maddox dive. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. Two possessions later, the Aztecs unleashed one of their high-speed 
touchdown drives. In three plays, they went 61 yards to tie the game at 14-14. 
The touchdown came on a 10-yard pass from McGwire to tight end Jim Hanawalt, 
which was set up when McGwire faked a handoff to Larry Maxey. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, the Aztecs' offense broke down, and it was forced to punt on 
each of its next three possessions. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA offense, meanwhile, scored on each of its next two possessions. Kevin 
Smith caught an eight-yard touchdown pass to cap another 80-yard drive -- in 10 
plays -- to make it 21-14, and Maury Toy finished a 59-yard drive with a two 
yard run, giving UCLA a two-touchdown lead, 28-14, with 8:37 left. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Wills broke loose up the middle for a 25-yard touchdown run with 1:36 
remaining before halftime for UCLA's fifth touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's sixth touchdown came in the third quarter, a 37-yard run by Brian Brown 
that increased the Bruins' lead to 42-24. Brown took off around left end, 
SDSU's Morey Paul and Marcus Preciado both missed tackles, and Brown soon found 
a clear path into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
This came after SDSU's Andy Trakas kicked a 24-yard field goal, bringing the 
Aztecs to within 11 points, 35-24. 
</P>
<P>
For an instant, the Aztecs had things going their way. The Bruins decided to go 
for it on fourth-and-one from their 45. The handoff went to Kevin Smith, but he 
was stopped at the line of scrimmage and the Aztecs had good field position. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
Marlon Andrews started at a cornerback spot instead of Damon Pieri. SDSU Coach 
Al Luginbill had said Friday that Pieri would start. . . . Quarterback Dan 
McGwire became a receiver for one unusual moment in the second quarter. It was 
third-and-four from the SDSU 26, the Aztecs were trailing, 28-14, and McGwire 
faded back to pass. He threw, the ball was deflected at the line of scrimmage, 
and McGwire plucked it out of the air and started to run. He was tackled at the 
line of scrimmage. . . . The most interesting run during Saturday's game? Had 
to be the halftime dash by a streaker, who ran straight down the middle of the 
field and into an end zone before he was detained by security.

MORNING BRIEFING: JUST ADDRESS HIS FAN MAIL TO: 'JIM CHEFFERS, L.A. COLISEUM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The words friendly and Los Angeles Coliseum haven't been seen in the same 
sentence for some time, so it might be refreshing to review Jim Cheffers' 
special relationship with the building. 
</P>
<P>
As a 10-year-old, Cheffers attended the 1932 Olympic Games at the Coliseum with 
his father. As a football player at Huntington Park High, he played in the Milk 
Bowl there. On weekends, he was an usher at USC and UCLA football games. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he coached Roosevelt High in the City playoffs at the Coliseum and 
officiated both high school and Pacific 10 games for several years. And during 
Super Bowl I, Cheffers held the down box on the Coliseum sideline. 
</P>
<P>
Add Cheffers: His 58-year love affair with the Coliseum also includes 20 years 
as Director of the CIF Los Angeles City Section, during which he supervised 
football playoffs and City and State championship track meets. 
</P>
<P>
He served as a track steward at the 1984 Olympics, and for several years has 
been an observer of officials for Pac-10 football games at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
And since the Raiders arrived in 1982, Cheffers has been their only home 
game-clock operator. Time appears to be on his side. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who holds the NBA career record for fouling out of the most 
regular-season games? 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Attitude: If you're sitting around wondering why the San Diego Padres 
finished fourth in the National League West and you can't stop saying to 
yourself, "But they had all that talent," think about what Padre first baseman 
Jack Clark had to say about Padre right fielder Tony Gwynn Friday: 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have to be friends, we don't have to hang out together, we don't have 
to talk to each other, but on the field we can play together." 
</P>
<P>
They play, therefore they are: The Philosophic Society for the Study of Sport 
held its 18th annual conference last week in Ft. Wayne, Ind. In attendance were 
36 philosophers, psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, coaches, 
trainers and physical educators. 
</P>
<P>
Among the topics: "The Moral Status of Intentional Fouling in Basketball" and 
"The Locus of Authority, Coercion and Critical Distance in the Decision to Play 
an Injured Player." 
</P>
<P>
Add Philosophic Society: New President David Fairchild, discussing media 
reaction to Cincinnati Coach Sam Wyche barring a female reporter from the 
Bengals' locker room, said: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned that the media hovered on every word and dignified this 
insensitive, ignorant position for mass consumption like it was a well-formed, 
philosophically defensible, theoretically sound argument. 
</P>
<P>
"Largely, I think that happened because there are so few philosophers of sport 
in the public eye. We're willing to call anything that we hear from any avenue, 
from any corner, a philosophically significant pronouncement." 
</P>
<P>
Let's get real: Obscure baseball statistic update: The Montreal Expos' Otis 
Nixon recently broke the official major league record for most stolen bases in 
fewest at-bats, 50 in 228. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Nixon can go after Herb Washington of the Oakland Athletics, who stole 30 
bases (28 in 1974, two in 1975) in no at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Vern Mikkelsen of the Minneapolis Lakers, 127 times between 
1949-50 and 1958-59.

SOUTHEAST ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
TENNESSEE BEATS FLORIDA WITH A BURST, 45-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first half of Saturday night's game between No. 5 Tennessee and No. 9 
Florida was the even struggle that most had predicted. 
</P>
<P>
But the second half was all Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Carter returned the second-half kickoff 91 yards for a touchdown to start 
a 28-point third quarter that gave Tennessee a 45-3 victory in a Southeastern 
Conference showdown at Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's return gave Tennessee a 14-3 lead and signaled an abrupt end to what 
had been a fierce defensive struggle between the Volunteers, 4-0-2 overall and 
2-0-1 in the SEC, and the Gators (5-1, 3-1). 
</P>
<P>
"Dale's kickoff return really built our confidence," Tennessee quarterback Andy 
Kelly said. "Fact is, the entire second half was a confidence-builder. Being 
realistic, we thought the game would be much tougher and certainly closer." 
</P>
<P>
Florida fumbled on the ensuing possession after Carter's return and the 
Volunteer offensive surge gathered momentum. Tennessee drove 68 yards in 10 
plays, taking a 21-3 lead on Tony Thompson's 13-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
The outburst reached its pinnacle when tight end Von Reeves took a handoff from 
Kelly, faded back and threw a perfect 47-yard touchdown pass to Carl Pickens to 
make it 28-3 with 4:40 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Florida tried to rally behind reserve quarterback Brian Fox, but he was 
intercepted on three consecutive possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee's Reggie Ingram returned one 42 yards for a touchdown to give the 
Vols a 35-3 lead and cap the four-touchdown quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"In 24 years, I can't remember one quite like it," Tennessee Coach Johnny 
Majors said of the outburst. "I don't know that I've ever seen a game break 
open like that one did the second half in my life." 
</P>
<P>
The homecoming game drew the second-largest crowd in school history, 96,874, 
and ended Florida's four-game winning streak in the series. 
</P>
<P>
It was Florida's first loss under new Coach Steve Spurrier and represented the 
largest margin of defeat in a 20-game series between the teams since 1916. The 
previous biggest margin was Tennessee's 40-0 victory in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
"We played lousy," Spurrier said. "We were beaten by a better team. It was 
fairly close for a half, but things got out of hand fast." 
</P>
<P>
No. 24 Mississippi 28, Georgia 12 -- Ricky Baldwin rushed for 106 yards and 
scored on runs of three and 13 yards as the Rebels won an SEC game at Athens, 
Ga. for the first time in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi had not won at Athens since 1970 when quarterback Archie Manning 
led the Rebels to a 31-21 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the toughest places to play in the country, and I thought our 
composure in the second half was the difference," Mississippi Coach Billy 
Brewer said. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi (5-1 overall, 2-1 in the SEC), built a 21-3 lead in the first half, 
then withstood a Georgia rally that cut the lead to 21-12 six minutes into the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
The victory ended a nine-game losing streak on Georgia's home field. It was the 
Rebels' second victory in a row over Georgia, after ending a 12-game Bulldog 
winning streak in the series last year. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia (3-3, 1-2) scored its only touchdown on a 15-yard pass from Greg Talley 
to Kevin Maxwell and also got field goals of 22 and 38 yards from John Kasay. 
</P>
<P>
"Ole Miss was the better team today," Georgia Coach Ray Goff said. "You can 
give all sorts of reasons, but they came out and got the job done. We didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky 17, Mississippi State 15 -- Noseguard Joey Couch deflected a 
field-goal attempt with 3:26 left in the game, and Kentucky's defenders blocked 
two other tries in leading the Wildcats (2-4, 1-1) to an SEC victory at 
Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State (2-3 overall, 0-3 in the SEC) had rallied from a 17-3 deficit 
to within 17-15 on Tony Shell's 23-yard touchdown pass to Jerry Bouldin with 
14:22 left. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State got the ball with 6:17 left and drove to the Kentucky 31 
where Couch blocked Chris Gardner's field-goal attempt.

Stan White threw two touchdown passes to Greg Taylor and Auburn's special teams 
scored twice Saturday as the No. 6 Tigers beat Vanderbilt, 56-6. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn, 4-0-1 overall and 2-0-1 in the Southeastern Conference, took a 42-6 
halftime lead and finished with 518 yards, including 301 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Mike Healey, starting in place of the injured Marcus Wilson for the 
Commodores (1-4, 1-2), was hurt in the second quarter and freshman Jeff 
Brothers had to finish the game. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn scored three touchdowns in each of the first two quarters and two more 
in the third after the starters left the game. 
</P>
<P>
White, playing only in the first half, connected with Taylor for scoring passes 
of 18 and 59 yards. Shayne Wasden returned a punt 69 yards for a touchdown in 
the second quarter, Auburn's first touchdown on a punt return since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
On Vanderbilt's next punt, Larry Young blocked the kick at about the Commodore 
20, then chased down the ball in the end zone for another touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Chad Muilenberg set up Auburn's first touchdown when he recovered the opening 
kickoff at the Commodore 16 after a fumble by Mark Johnson. Tony Richardson 
later scored from the two. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson also had a one-yard touchdown in the third quarter. James Joseph and 
Alex Smith scored Auburn's other touchdowns on short runs.

Russell White scored three touchdowns, Mike Pawlawski threw for 232 yards and 
California survived a second-half collapse to beat Arizona State, 31-24, in a 
Pacific 10 game Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Bears, 4-2 overall and 2-1 in the Pac-10, led 21-3 at halftime and 
held on for their third consecutive victory. The Sun Devils fell to 2-3 and 0-2 
with their third straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State, trailing 31-3, closed to 31-24 on Leonard Russell's 11-yard 
touchdown run with 5:20 left in the third quarter, Kelvin Fisher's four-yard 
touchdown run with 13:07 to play and Russell's 21-yard scoring run with 5:21 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The Sun Devils appeared to be driving toward the tying touchdown until reserve 
quarterback Bret Powers, on a first-and-10 play from the Cal 17-yard line, 
fumbled while being sacked and Golden Bear linebacker Cornell Collier recovered 
the football at the 30. Cal then ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Pawlawski, who had 13 straight completions at one point and finished 22 of 33 
with three second-half interceptions, passed Sean Dawkins on a 10-yard scoring 
play for a 7-0 lead with 7:17 left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
White, the sophomore from Crespi High in Encino who had 88 yards in 21 carries, 
scored on a 10-yard run around left end to cap a seven-play, 73-yard drive 4:26 
before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Cal made it 21-3 when White turned a screen pass over the middle into a 17-yard 
touchdown with 16 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State's lone first-half points came on Mike Richey's 29-yard field goal 
with 1:19 remaining. He was wide right on a 42-yard attempt 4:19 into the game, 
only the second miss of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie Keen's 43-yard field goal 3:35 into the third quarter gave the Golden 
Bears a 24-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
White's four-yard touchdown run, set up by defensive tackle Joel Dickson's 
interception, made it 31-3 with 7:44 remaining in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Bears rolled up 503 yards in total offense -- 271 of it rushing as 
Anthony Wallace had 136 yards in 25 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State had 345 yards, 224 of it on the ground as Russell got 186 in 25 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
With senior Paul Justin still sidelined with a separated left shoulder, the Sun 
Devils alternated quarterbacks. Sophomore starter Kurt Lasher completed three 
of 10 passes for 22 yards while Powers, a redshirt freshman, played most of the 
second half and was seven of 18 for 99 yards with one interception. 
</P>
<P>
The game, which started in 87-degree late-afternoon heat, drew a crowd of 
59,043 at 74,865-seat Sun Devil Stadium.

<P>
In his first start, Fred Schweer accomplished something no Oregon State 
quarterback had managed in 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
He beat Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Schweer, a redshirt freshman, directed Oregon State to its highest-scoring 
Pacific 10 performance since 1979 as the previously winless Beavers stunned No. 
21 Arizona, 35-21, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole team really came together," Schweer said. "We made big plays when we 
had to and stayed away from the penalties." 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State broke a nine-game losing streak and beat the Wildcats for the 
first time since they joined the Pac-10 in 1979, going 0-12 before Saturday. 
The only Beaver victory over Arizona was in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
The loss almost certainly dealt a fatal blow to the Rose Bowl hopes of the 
Wildcats, 4-2 overall and 2-2 in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted it more," Arizona quarterback George Malauulu said. "We didn't 
overlook them. We just came in and got our butt kicked." 
</P>
<P>
Schweer, who got the start because Matt Booher has a jammed thumb on his 
throwing hand, passed for a touchdown and directed three long scoring drives. 
Arizona mistakes set up the other two Oregon State scores. 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers had lost to such teams as Montana, Nevada Las Vegas and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody had us written off for dead," linebacker Todd McKinney said. "It was 
a great victory." 
</P>
<P>
There were signs of an Oregon State resurgence two weeks ago, when it led 
Nebraska, 7-3, at halftime before losing, 31-7. The Beavers hadn't played since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the thing we've been fighting so hard to get," Coach Dave Kraghorpe 
said. "It means an awful lot. It ranks right up there with some of the big wins 
we've had. Obviously . . . it's a major upset. It's so much sweeter because of 
our previous five games." 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Pitchford scored three touchdowns and James Jones rushed for two for the 
Beavers (1-5, 1-1). 
</P>
<P>
"The team that deserved to win won the game," Arizona Coach Dick Tomey said. 
"They were hungrier than we were. It was a poor effort from a coaching 
standpoint and a poor effort from a playing standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona blocked two Oregon State punts to set up touchdowns. But the Beavers' 
defense, which had given up 438 yards per game this season, held Arizona to 321 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State trailed, 21-14, early in the third quarter when Schweer directed 
touchdown drives the next two times his team had the ball. 
</P>
<P>
He capped an eight-play, 63-yard drive by connecting with Pitchford on a 
22-yard pass play to tie the score, 21-21, with 4:46 to play in the third 
quarter. Pitchford caught the short pass over the middle, then ran through the 
Wildcats' defense for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers took the lead by going 67 yards in 13 plays. Dwayne Owens had runs 
of 17 and 13 yards during the drive. Schweer's nine-yard pass on third down to 
Jason Blum on the Arizona two-yard line set up Jones' scoring run to make it 
28-21 with 12:12 to play. Owens was the game's leading rusher with 80 yards in 
12 carries.

NORTHRIDGE BACKFIELD LEADS WIN

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tailback Albert Fann rushed for 136 yards and three touchdowns and fullback 
Anthony Nicholson also gained 136 yards Saturday to lead Cal State Northridge 
to a 34-24 victory over Southern Utah in a Western Football Conference game at 
Cedar City, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Fann, a senior, had 38 carries and scored on two one-yard runs and a four-yard 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson, a junior, had 19 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, 5-1 overall and 2-0 in the conference, moved into first place in 
the conference, half a game ahead of Southern Utah (4-3, 2-1) and a game ahead 
of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, a 20-17 loser to Cal State Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors, ranked 15th in Division II, were outgained, 440 total yards to 
385, but forced six turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Included was an interception and 33-yard return for a touchdown by nose tackle 
Alo Sila with just over 12 minutes left that put the Matadors in the lead to 
stay, 24-17. 
</P>
<P>
Abo Velasco kicked field goals of 34 and 50 yards for Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Utah scored on a 19-yard run by Steve Hutchings, a two-yard run by 
Scott Firestone, a 33-yard pass play from Brad Matthews to Dan Silcox and a 
28-yard field goal by Rick Cadwallader. 
</P>

a Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference game at Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran 14, Claremont-Mudd 7 -- Quarterback Cassidy O'Sullivan and

left to give the Kingsmen (1-5) the victory over the Stags (1-4) in a 
nonconference game at Claremont.

Ralph Martini passed for three touchdowns and ran for another, Sheldon Canley 
rushed for 168 yards and San Jose State racked up 614 yards in total offense to 
rout Cal State Long Beach, 46-29, in a Big West Conference game Saturday night 
at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans (4-2-1 overall and 3-0 in the Big West) played their first home 
game in six weeks and broke a three-game winning streak by the 49ers (3-4, 
2-2). 
</P>
<P>
Martini has thrown 11 touchdowns passes in the past three games. He was 19 of 
35 for 315 yards, and has passed for at least 300 yards in four of the past 
five games. Canley has 815 yards this season and his 2,080 career yards trail 
only Gerald Wilhite (2,364) on the all-time San Jose list. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 10-3 in the second quarter, San Jose scored three touchdowns, two in 
the final 3:53, to take a 25-10 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Studer, who passed for all four 49er touchdowns, hit Jeff Exum on a 
nine-yard scoring pass to cut the lead to 25-17 in the third quarter. But 
Martini drove the Spartans 65 yards in six plays and passed to Maceo Barbosa 
for a five-yard touchdown and 32-17 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada Las Vegas 24, New Mexico State 20 -- Quarterback Derek Stott scored on a 
14-yard run with 3:20 remaining to lift the Rebels over the Aggies, extending 
the nation's longest losing streak in Division I to 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV is 4-3 overall, 3-1 in the Big West.

Fresno State, unbeaten and ranked No. 24 two weeks ago, is winless in its last 
two games. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs were tied, 24-24, by Utah State in a Big West Conference game 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
They apparently were still reeling from last week's 73-18 beating at Northern 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
The tie ended two Fresno State winning streaks. The Bulldogs, 5-1-1 overall and 
2-0-1 in the Big West, had won 20 consective games at home and 17 consecutive 
conference games. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State's Aaron Craver, who rushed for 115 yards in 24 carries, scored on 
a one-yard run with 10:59 left to give the Bulldogs a 24-21 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But the Aggies (1-3-1, 1-0-1) came back as Doug Beech kicked a 20-yard field 
goal with 2:26 left. It came after Steve Neeleman intercepted a pass by Mark 
Barsotti at the Fresno State 36.

Isiah Thomas' 14 third-quarter points helped the defending NBA champion Detroit 
Pistons rally for a 118-111 exhibition win over the Clippers on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons are 2-0 in the exhibition season, both wins coming against the 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas led the Pistons with 19 points and center James Edwards added 18. The 
Clippers' Ken Norman led all scorers with 26 points. 
</P>

The Pistons trailed, 58-57, at halftime and led, 81-80, with 1:30 left in the 
third quarter when Thomas scored five consecutive points to stretch the 
Pistons' lead to six. Detroit led by as many as 12 during the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers trailed, 49-39, with 6:20 left in the second quarter, but battled

WHITTINGHAM LOSES ONE, WINS ONE

<TEXT>
<P>
The first quarter mile of the $216,800 Goodwood Handicap Saturday at Santa 
Anita produced good and bad news for Charlie Whittingham. 
</P>
<P>
Following instructions, Pat Valenzuela was riding Triteamtri like he was in a 
440-yard race at Los Alamitos. Only trouble was this was 1 1/8 miles at Santa 
Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Triteamtri's mad dash (an opening 22 2/5 quarter en route to a 45 2/5 
half-mile) effectively beat both him and Ruhlmann, the stronger half of 
Whittingham's two entries and the 6-5 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
The torrid pace was perfectly agreeable with Whittingham's other starter. At 
least 12 lengths off the lead early, Lively One came flying late to win going 
away in 1:48. 
</P>
<P>
In winning for the second time in seven 1990 starts, Lively One, the 7-2 second 
choice, defeated Miserden, the longest shot in the field at 22-1, by 2 1/2 
lengths with Festin, who was last for the first six furlongs, another head back 
in third. 
</P>
<P>
Last in his previous start -- the four-horse Del Mar Budweiser Breeders' Cup -- 
Lively One in all likelihood earned himself a start in the Breeders' Cup 
Classic 13 days hence in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll probably go back," Whittingham said after Lively One's $126,800 payday 
boosted his earnings to more than $1.33 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll see how he comes out of this. There's time to decide. He'd been away for 
a long time when he ran at Del Mar. He likes this track and he ran his race." 
</P>
<P>
The beaten favorite for the second straight time, Ruhlmann put away Triteamtri 
and opened a 1 1/2-length lead after six furlongs, but he had nothing to give 
late. He wound up fifth, beaten by nearly eight lengths. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was in trouble as soon as the gate opened and the other jockey was 
chirping and hollering at his horse in a mile and an eighth race," said Gary 
Stevens, Ruhlmann's regular companion. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand Pat's position. I can't really say anything because I don't even 
know the man (Triteamtri's trainer is Lou Goldfine and his assistant is his son 
Mitchell). Somebody tells you to do something you have to do it. That's what 
they pay us for." 
</P>
<P>
Triteamtri, who won from slightly off the pace in August, finished last, about 
15 lengths behind Lively One. 
</P>
<P>
"I had one set of instructions: go to the lead no matter what and I don't care 
what you have to do," Valenzuela said. 
</P>
<P>
Miserden, who was closest to Triteamtri and Ruhlmann while they did each other 
in, saved the place over Festin, who is probably most effective around one 
turn. The 33-1 upsetter in Del Mar's Cabrillo Handicap, Miserden was last in 
the Woodward Sept. 15 at Belmont Park. "He didn't like the track back there," 
trainer Bobby Frankel said. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Solis, who was aboard for Lively One's last victory -- May 6 at Golden 
Gate -- knew the 5-year-old Halo horse was going to be tough down the backside. 
</P>
<P>
"At the half-mile pole, he was rolling all by himself without my asking," he 
said. "I dropped in early to save some ground, came out on the backside and he 
was flying down the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
Best Pal, California's top 2-year-old, will be supplemented for $120,000 to the 
Breeders' Cup Juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
Winner of the Del Mar Futurity and Norfolk Stakes in his last two starts, the 
Habitony gelding will be one of the favorites in the Juvenile and a victory 
would clinch an Eclipse Award. 
</P>
<P>
Owned by John Mabee's Golden Eagle Farm and trained by Ian Jory, Best Pal, who 
has won five of his six starts, will leave Wednesday for New York. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Pat Valenzuela was suspended for five days by the stewards for an incident in 
Friday's fifth race. Star Day, Valenzuela's mount who finished fourth as the 
favorite, drifted in and bothered Meadow's Interco, resulting in Star Day being 
disqualified and placed fifth. The suspension will begin Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
For the third consecutive day, nobody was able to sweep the Pick Six, so there 
is a carryover of $324,364.93. . . . Making his first start for trainer Bill 
Shoemaker, Shirkee equaled Baffle's long-standing course record when he won 
Saturday's seventh race. In upsetting Oraibi and Sam Who, the 5-year-old Tell 
gelding ran the 6 1/2 furlongs on the hillside turf course in 1:11 4/5, tying 
the mark Baffle set Feb. 7, 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Earn Your Stripes, who was second to Sensational Star in Del Mar's Pat O'Brien 
Handicap before going North to win the Bay Meadows Breeders' Cup, will not be 
going East for the Breeders' Cup Sprint. The horse had a little filling in his 
left ankle after working earlier in the week, trainer Hap Proctor said. . . . 
Trainer Richard Mulhall, who has been suffering from pneumonia, was released 
from Arcadia Methodist Hospital Friday. . . . Corey Nakatani ended a 37-race 
slump at Oak Tree when Keep On Top won the 10th race.

ANTELOPE VALLEY STAYS UNBEATEN WITH 43-7 WIN OVER EAST L. A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ask any player on the Antelope Valley College football team about it and he 
will give the same answer: Coach Brent Carder is still running a conservative, 
take-no-big-chances, make-no-mistakes offense. 
</P>
<P>
The execution has improved recently, though, and so have the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still running the same basic plays," Antelope Valley tailback Steve 
Miller said. "It's just that now, our offense is coming together. The offensive 
line really did a great job tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Miller's 217 yards rushing in 16 carries and two touchdowns underscored that 
performance as the Marauders routed East Los Angeles, 43-7, in a Foothill 
Conference game at home Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The victory improved Antelope Valley's overall record to 5-0-1 (3-0-1 in 
conference play). It is the Marauders' best start since the 1954 season when 
they finished 10-0-1. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that we were capable of playing like this," Miller said. "It just took 
us a while to get going." 
</P>
<P>
After scoring 80 points in its first four games, Antelope Valley has scored 77 
points in its past two. 
</P>
<P>
The Marauders set one school record and tied another against the Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Washington and tight end Thomas Reimer combined on a 98-yard touchdown 
play to set one record, and Miller's 95-yard run in the third quarter tied 
another. 
</P>
<P>
One constant throughout the season has been the Antelope Valley defense. 
</P>
<P>
Against East L. A., the Marauders forced five turnovers (two fumbles and three 
interceptions) and held quarterback Santiago Alvarez to seven completions in 21 
attempts for 52 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez had completed 60% of his passes for 896 yards and six touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley led, 30-7, at halftime, with the Marauders converting three 
Husky turnovers into 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies' Steven Dumas fumbled the opening kickoff and Jason Camp kicked a 
38-yard field goal to give Antelope Valley a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
On the Huskies' next series, Mike Gilliam fumbled and Antelope Valley strong 
safety Rick Starling recovered at the East L. A. 35-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Miller took a pitch and went 30 yards around right end for a 
touchdown that gave Antelope Valley a 10-0 lead with 10 minutes 30 seconds left 
in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley's usually conservative offense produced a big play after an 
East L. A. punt had pinned the Marauders on their two-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Washington hit Reimer with a short pass over the middle on first down and 
Reimer broke Armando Torres' tackle and rumbled down the left sideline for the 
school-record touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The score remained 17-0 until midway through the second quarter. John Johnson 
intercepted his fourth pass of the season and returned it to Antelope Valley's 
23-yard line. Three plays later, Tony Simmons turned a draw play into a 51-yard 
touchdown.

<TEXT>
<P>
There was a good deal of bad blood brewing after Carson defeated Banning, 
41-14, Friday night at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Not between the players. Between the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Banning Coach Joe Dominguez took exception, among other things, to Carson 
adding a two-point conversion after its last touchdown in the fourth quarter. 
The Colts led at the time, 39-14. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to play them again," said Dominguez, who is 0-4 against Carson in 
three seasons as head coach. "And when we're winning 39 to whatever, perhaps 
we'll go for two also." 
</P>
<P>
Carson Coach Gene Vollnogle said his team entered the game in an angry frame of 
mind because of remarks made by Banning assistant coach Rocky Garibay after 
Carson beat the Pilots in a passing league game last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"(Garibay) made some derogatory remarks, not only to me, but to the team, and 
the kids took offense to it," Vollnogle said. "So I knew we were going to be 
ready. I knew there was going to be some god-awful hitting going on because the 
players were really (mad)." 
</P>
<P>
Answered Dominguez: "That's just talk. Talk doesn't mean anything. I think 
actions do. I think for a coach to go for two points when the other team is 
down like that . . . come on. If it ever happens (that we have a big lead), 
he's in for a long night." 
</P>
<P>
QUICK RECOVERY 
</P>
<P>
Reports that Carson quarterback John Walsh would be sidelined a minimum of 
three weeks after suffering a sprained ankle last week proved to be greatly 
exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, as it turned out, didn't miss a beat. He received a doctor's clearance 
Wednesday, returned to practice Thursday and on Friday set a school single-game 
record with 406 yards passing. His four touchdown passes helped Carson take a 
commanding 33-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I had therapy on my foot and it felt OK, so I said, 'I'm playing,' " Walsh 
said. "The swelling went way down. I taped it up real good tonight. It's a big 
game. I didn't want to miss out." 
</P>
<P>
Vollnogle said he was "shocked" when he learned Wednesday night that Walsh 
would be able to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told it was three to six weeks, so that's what I assumed it was," he 
said. "We practiced all week with Tarriel (Hopper at quarterback)." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez, however, wasn't buying it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a bunch of bull when a coach lies and says a kid's not going to 
play for three weeks, and he plays," he said. "I mean, play the game on Friday 
night; don't play the game during the week. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured on him playing. We were happy that he did play. The quarterback has 
to be commended. He threw the ball real well tonight." 
</P>
<P>
SMALL VICTORY 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste Coach Tony Bantula said just being able to play Serra was a triumph 
in itself, even if the powerful Cavaliers did win, 52-3. 
</P>
<P>
Bantula said a group of concerned parents wanted Miraleste to forfeit the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Why?' and they said, 'Because they're going to carry us off on 
stretchers,' " Bantula said. "I said, 'Bull.' They put their pants on the same 
way as us. They didn't hurt us physically. They just have speed." 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste finished with 62 net yards, and running time was kept in the second 
half after Serra opened a 44-3 halftime lead. But Bantula believes the 
Marauders can learn from the experience. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pleasure to go out and play against these guys," he said. "Not too many 
schools can say they went out and played against Serra. We got our butts 
kicked, but we played them. What it does, it makes us better. After seeing 
this, what else can you face?" 
</P>
<P>
Serra finished with 400 total yards and rushed for 396 yards on 33 carries, an 
average of 12 yards a carry. Running back Jerald Henry led the way with 184 
yards on eight carries, including touchdowns of 43, 63, 51 and five yards. 
</P>
<P>
NOBODY'S PERFECT 
</P>
<P>
You might have noticed that our predictions in the Ocean League didn't start 
out too well Friday. Rolling Hills, which we picked to finish first, lost at 
home to Morningside, 32-6; and Mira Costa, which we picked to finish last, 
defeated Palos Verdes, 23-13. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it's no surprise. This league figures to be as competitive as any in 
the South Bay, with any of the five teams having a shot at the title. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it's possible," said Rich Egan, Mira Costa's offensive 
coordinator, "but there could be five teams tied at 2-2 at the end." 
</P>
<P>
STANDING ALONE 
</P>
<P>
If there's a finer all-around athlete in the South Bay than Morningside 
sophomore Stais Boseman, we'd like to see him. 
</P>
<P>
Already considered one of the area's top basketball prospects, the 6-foot-3 
Boseman can also play a mean game of football. He alternated at quarterback and 
flanker in the Monarchs' victory over Rolling Hills, rushing for 126 yards on 
11 carries and completing three of seven passes for 49 yards and a TD. 
</P>
<P>
PICKOFF ARTISTS 
</P>
<P>
Several defensive backs in the area are compiling impressive interception 
totals this season. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance free safety Jason Orpe had two interceptions in a 14-9 victory 
over South Torrance to give him six on the year. He returned the second one 34 
yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Carson strong safety Tarriel Hopper had two interceptions against Banning to 
give him three. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo cornerback John Dulmage had two interceptions in a 10-0 victory over 
North Torrance to raise his total to four. Sea Hawk free safety Jeremy Veasey 
had one, giving him three on the year. Another Redondo defensive back, Joey 
Zeller, has four interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
TRIPLE THREAT 
</P>
<P>
Overshadowed in Bishop Montgomery's 24-20 loss to St. Bernard was a 
three-touchdown performance by Joe McEwen. The junior tailback-free safety 
scored on a 95-yard kickoff return, a 70-yard interception return and a 60-yard 
run. 
</P>
<P>
STREAKS 
</P>
<P>
Serra defeated Miraleste, 52-3, to extend its winning streak to 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
Carson defeated Banning, 41-14, for the sixth consecutive time. It is the 
longest winning streak in the 37-game series, which started in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena beat San Pedro, 20-14, to snap a five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Narbonne fell to Washington, 20-14, extending its losing streak to 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood fell to Santa Monica, 49-20, for its 15th consecutive Bay League 
defeat.

Leuzinger running back-linebacker Marvin Johnson, on looking past Friday's 
22-12 victory over Culver City to next week's game with rival Hawthorne: "We 
can't wait for that game. That's all we've been talking about. We took Culver 
City easy. We weren't even worried about Culver City. We were worrying about 
Hawthorne. That's all we've been concerned about." 
</P>
<P>
Gardena Coach Mike Sakurai, on his team's 20-14 victory over San Pedro after 
starting the season 0-4: "I'm very happy for our kids because they've been 
taking a lot of flak from their classmates. They've been working hard but 
haven't got a lot of support. We had something to prove." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery Coach Steve Carroll, on his team's four turnovers in a 24-20 
loss to St. Bernard that brought its season total to 27: "I offer no excuses. 
Next week, I promise you, you'll see a different football team." 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes Coach Bill Judy, on his team's 23-13 loss to Mira Costa, which 
brought a 1-3-1 record into the game: "Mira Costa is just a strong, physical 
team. They have five or six big, aggressive people that come hard and smother 
you. To really be in the game with them, we would have had to play errorless 
football." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne Coach Goy Casillas, on his team's 41-27 victory at Beverly Hills: 
"We're pleased to get out of here with a win. This place has been the pits for 
Hawthorne in the past." ROB FERNAS and DAVID RAATZ

TURNOVERS COST VERDUGO HILLS IN 7-6 DEFEAT

<P>
Verdugo Hills High Coach Charley Mack watched the Dons fumble away his chance 
to come out on top against his alma mater Marshall and mentor Ken Gerard on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Verdugo Hills committed five turnovers -- three of them fumbles -- as the 
Barristers prevailed, 7-6, in a Northern Conference game at Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Richard Gomez's one-yard touchdown run and Mauricio Pena's extra 
point in the third quarter helped Marshall beat Mack in his second year as 
Verdugo Hills' head coach. The Barristers improved to 2-3, 1-1 in conference 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had them. . . . but we made a couple mistakes," said Mack, who 
played nose guard and was an assistant coach for Gerard at Marshall. "We 
fumbled on the second drive and again in the second half. If we get those back, 
who knows. We could have had a 21-0 lead." 
</P>
<P>
Scoring has been a problem for Verdugo Hills (0-5, 0-2), which has been shut 
out three times and scored only 13 points before Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
Verdugo Hills moved into scoring position on its second drive, but quarterback 
Noel Alvarado fumbled at Marshall's 10-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarado redeemed himself by scoring on a one-yard sneak late in the second 
quarter to complete a 14-play, 74-yard drive. Alvarado had 123 yards in total 
offense (98 passing, 25 rushing). Robert Servellon's kick for the extra point, 
however, hit the left upright. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarado threw interceptions on Verdugo Hills' final two possessions, including 
a long pass that would have given the Dons a first down on Marshall's one with 
3 minutes 52 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran (a crossing pattern) out of a slot (formation) and we hoped to sucker 
them with it," said Dons' offensive coordinator Rob Huffman, a former Cal State 
Northridge quarterback. "If (Alvarado) had thrown it a little farther, we might 
have had a touchdown. But they stayed back pretty well." SEAN WATERS

Village Christian 6, L.A. Baptist 0 -- L. A. Baptist limited Village Christian 
to 11 first-half yards in an Alpha League opener at Monroe High. 
</P>
<P>
On their first possession of the second half, the Crusaders scored on a 
nine-play, 50-yard drive capped by a five-yard pass from sophomore quarterback 
David Treanor to J.B. McLeod. Treanor was starting in place of injured Mark 
Vail. 
</P>
<P>
L. A. Baptist (0-6) threatened on the next possession, marching to the Crusader 
six-yard line. A fourth-and-goal run from the six-yard line, however, fell two 
yards short. On the next play, Village Christian's Myles Brown ran 96 yards for 
an apparent touchdown, but it was called back because of a clipping penalty.

HOLUA TAKES OFFICIAL WATTS LEAD

<P>
The ULDB 70 Association title contenders sailed the first two races of the 
Watts Trophy regatta Saturday as if the winner would move into a higher tax 
bracket. 
</P>
<P>
As the big maxi sleds struggled in light and shifty winds outside Los Angeles 
Harbor, only Davis Pillsbury's Holua from the Newport Harbor Yacht Club -- 
among the title contenders -- managed a respectable showing with a first- and a 
fifth-place finish. That left Holua second in the event to Brack Duker's 
Evolution -- which is ineligible for the title -- from California YC, which 
scored a second and a first. Both are Santa Cruz 70s. 
</P>
<P>
The Watts is one of only five points events for the sleds. Evolution is 
ineligible because Duker bought the Cal Cup winner from Bob Doughty at 
midseason. 
</P>
<P>
The points are more important to Hal Ward's Nelson/Marek 67 Cheval, which leads 
the season standings but sailed a third and a ninth (last) on Saturday. Even 
worse were Ed McDowell's runner-up SC 70 Grand Illusion (sixth and seventh) and 
the Reichel/Pugh 68 Taxi Dancer, which didn't find the strong winds it likes 
and took a seventh and eighth. 
</P>
<P>
The first race was sailed in only three or four knots of breeze. Holua, steered 
by Pillsbury's son Patrick, took advantage of a timely shift near the first 
leeward mark to leave the fleet behind and win by two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Sailing at a better angle, "We were able to aim right at the mark, and they 
just stopped," Patrick Pillsbury said. 
</P>
<P>
In this event only, the owners or members of their immediate families are 
required to steer. Pillsbury was at the helm in the second race, but his other 
two sons, Peter and Taylor, will do the last two today. 
</P>
<P>
The wind settled in at 12 knots before the second race was over, but Duker had 
taken Evolution off by itself while the rest of the boats battled in less 
favorable wind. He finished a minute ahead of Les Crouch's Maverick. 
</P>
<P>
Duker indicated that rather than bringing a world-class skipper on board he 
would probably continue to steer the boat himself.

FOOTBALL: CURTIUS LEADS UC SANTA BARBARA TO ITS THIRD VICTORY IN A ROW AGAINST

<P>
The University of San Diego did everything it could to motivate its football 
team for Saturday afternoon's game against UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Everything but a rain dance. Having one of those might have made some sense 
because the only time USD has beaten the Gauchos in the past four years was 
after a freak rainstorm in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday was USD's homecoming game, which meant the seniors would be playing 
their final game in Torero Stadium and a crowd of 4,000-plus would be cheering 
them on. Too, the returning players remember all too well the embarrassing 51-3 
rout UCSB inflicted on them last year. 
</P>
<P>
None of it seemed to matter. The sky was unmistakably clear Saturday, and the 
Toreros were handed a 24-3 loss. 
</P>
<P>
USD (4-2) has not beaten UCSB since a 7-0 victory in the mud in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we had to come out hard," UCSB receiver Brian Fleming said. "We knew 
they'd be fired up, and we figured we had to take their homecoming crowd out of 
it, too." 
</P>
<P>
UCSB (4-2), which for a few years has been preparing for a move next year into 
NCAA Division II, came out hard and did little wrong all afternoon against the 
smaller and slower Toreros. The Gauchos had no turnovers, only four penalties 
for 35 yards, passed for 174 yards and three touchdowns and ran for 131 yards. 
The three touchdown passes tripled what USD had allowed in its first five 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Still, USD, which had two costly fumbles in its first two possessions, was in 
the game until late in the third quarter. That's when UCSB senior quarterback 
Mike Curtius hit tight end Adam Leow for his second touchdown reception of the 
quarter to end the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Curtius finished 15 of 30 for 174 yards. However, 61 of those yards came in the 
Gauchos' opening drive, and Curtius had been averaging 270 yards per game, all 
against Division II opponents. Three of his completions went to Fleming, a 
preseason All-American who is now tied for the school career reception record 
with 93 catches. 
</P>
<P>
Valhalla High and Grossmont College graduate Johnny Ace, another preseason 
All-American, had two catches, including the first touchdown, a seven-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the defense contained them pretty well, especially since we are a 
little banged up," USD Coach Brian Fogarty said. "Some of the things on offense 
we didn't too well." 
</P>
<P>
USD avoided its first shutout since the fourth game of 1984 with a 25-yard 
field goal by Dave Bergmann. That came with 1:16 left in the first half and 
pulled USD to within 10-3. But USD managed only one first down in its first 
three possessions of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"We put too much pressure on our defense to stop them offensively all the 
time," USD quarterback Brendan Murphy said. "They're just too high-powered for 
us to do that."

GULLS FALL TO FORT WAYNE IN OT

<P>
Disappointment was tempered by the hope that filled the arena moments earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls fell 5-4 in sudden-death overtime to Fort Wayne Saturday night at the 
San Diego Sports Arena, bringing their International Hockey League record to 
1-3-1. 
</P>
<P>
But by fighting back from two-goal deficits twice, it wasn't a bad way to go 
down. Not bad at all. And the crowd of 5,357 roared in appreciation of the 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't quit, but we're still making stupid mistakes," Coach Mike O'Connell 
said. "On the winning goal, we made the wrong read, so we're going to have to 
make some adjustments." 
</P>
<P>
Fort Wayne's Steve Fletcher scored the overtime goal 1:57 into the three-minute 
period as the Komets swept the two-game series. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls are off until Friday, when they travel to Indianapolis, then return 
home Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls outshot Fort Wayne 40-21 in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-2 tie came at 5:45 in the third, when a series of passes ended with 
defenseman Paul Marshall getting his first score of the season, also the first 
Gulls goal by a defender. 
</P>
<P>
Left wing Clark Donatelli, obtained from the North Stars Tuesday, slid a pass 
from behind the net to Marshall, who shoved it in from the left. 
</P>
<P>
Fort Wayne retook the lead, 4-2, when it scored back-to-back goals at 8:52 and 
10:07, first by John Anderson, followed by Max Midendorf, both from close 
range. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of frustrating the Gulls, as they have been in earlier games, this time 
they turned it up a notch. 
</P>
<P>
Sapergia avenged himself and pulled the Gulls to within 4-3 when he coaxed in a 
goal from the slot on a Bob Jones pass from the left wing. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd evened it at 4-4 on a power-play goal at 15:16. On a pass from Sapergia 
from the far right wing, Floyd took a straight shot from the right point 
without interference. 
</P>
<P>
Fort Wayne extended its lead to 2-0 at 8:18 in the second, when the Komets set 
up a screen for center Bruce Boudreau from inside the right point. Boudreau 
swung and the puck landed in the middle of the net. 
</P>
<P>
The second period has proven dry as the Sahara for the Gulls. They were 
scoreless in the second until Saturday, when Jim McGeough ended the drought. 
McGeough jumped on a shot by Larry Floyd from the high slot that was deflected 
off Komet goalie Mike O'Neill. McGeough reached out and tipped it in from 
outside the left crease, passing O'Neill from the right at 12:51. 
</P>
<P>
Four minutes later, officials took away the potential game-tying score. Brent 
Sapergia took a shot from inside the blue line that passed a pack of players in 
front of the goal and skipped into the net. But officials ruled that the Gulls' 
Carl Mokosak had kicked the puck in. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls continued their shot-on-goal dominance. But whereas on Friday, when 
they at least had a first-period goal to show for it, Saturday the Gulls 
trailed 1-0 after outshooting Fort Wayne 12-7 in the first. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Brian McGee, who played in Europe last year, opened scoring for Fort 
Wayne on the power play, taking a wrist shot from high in the slot. The puck 
caught the tip of goalie Mark Reimer's stick before it took a short bounce and 
landed in the lower right corner of the net at 16:33. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Al Tuer continued his now-familiar brawling ways, adding a 
five-minute second-period fighting penalty to the fighting penalty called 
against him Friday. In the third period, he was hit with a 10-minute game 
misconduct penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Simmer, the Gulls' assistant coach and a left wing, sprained his right 
ankle and had to be assisted off the ice halfway through the first period.

WINGING IT ON BEACHES WHERE BUTTERFLIES GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Monarch butterflies and mellow beaches are the highlights of this coast walk 
north of Santa Barbara. Autumn, when the crowds have thinned and the 
butterflies have arrived, is a particularly fine time to roam the coast, from 
El Capitan State Beach to Refugio State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
El Capitan is a narrow beach at the mouth of El Capitan Creek. Shading the 
creek is a woodland of coast live oak and sycamore. 
</P>
<P>
During autumn, monarch butterflies congregate and breed in the trees here. Ask 
park rangers where the monarchs cluster in large numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The butterflies have a distinctive coloring -- brownish-red wings with black 
veins. The outer edge of the wings are dark brown, with white and yellow spots. 
</P>
<P>
During October and November, the woodland of El Capitan Creek offers the twin 
delights of falling autumn leaves and fluttering butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
El Capitan refers to Capt. Jose Francisco de Ortega, a rotund Spanish army 
officer who served as trail scout for the Portola expedition. When he retired 
from service to the Crown in 1795, he owed the army money and offered to square 
things by raising cattle. 
</P>
<P>
The government granted him his chosen land: a coastal strip, two miles wide and 
25 miles long, extending from just east of Pt. Conception to Refugio Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
He called his land Nuestra Senora del Refugio, "Our Lady of Refuge." Alas, 
Capt. Ortega's retirement was short-lived; he died three years later and was 
buried at the Santa Barbara Mission. 
</P>
<P>
After the death of El Capitan, the Ortega family continued living in Refugio 
Canyon for many years. 
</P>
<P>
The mouth of the canyon at the Pacific was the major contraband-loading point 
for Southern California during the early years of the 19th Century when Spanish 
settlers were forbidden to trade with Americans. From the Ortega Ranch, hides, 
tallow, leather goods and wine were loaded onto Boston-bound sailing ships. 
</P>
<P>
Smuggling activity came to an end in 1818 when French Capt. (some would say 
pirate) Hippoloyte de Bouchard sailed by. Bouchard, a mercenary hired by the 
Argentines, who were then struggling for independence against Spain, put ashore 
and burned Ortega's ranch buildings to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Beach, bluff and bike trails link El Capitan and Refugio State beaches. 
Depending on the tide, you can usually travel up-coast along El Capitan Beach 
as far as Coral Canyon Beach. Then you can join the bluff trails or the bike 
path, which is also open to hikers, for the balance of the trip to Refugio 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
El Capitan and Refugio are popular beach campgrounds and nice places to spend a 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead: From Highway 101, 19 miles up-coast from Santa 
Barbara, take the El Capitan State Beach exit. Park in one of the day-use 
areas. There's a $5 state park day-use fee that is also honored at Refugio and 
Gaviota State beaches. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: Descend one of the paths or staircases to the shore, then head 
up-coast along the sandy and rocky beach. Sea cliffs are steep here because 
they are constantly being cut back by wave erosion. You'll pass wide Coral 
Canyon, its walls covered with beds of highly deformed, light-colored shales. 
</P>
<P>
At Coral Beach, the tides often discourage beach-walking, so head up to the 
bluffs and follow the bike path. 
</P>
<P>
Approaching Refugio State Beach, you'll see abundant kelp just offshore. If a 
breeze is blowing over the water, note how areas with kelp are smooth, while 
kelpless areas are rippled. 
</P>
<P>
Refugio State Beach, at the mouth of Refugio Canyon, is a rocky beach with 
tidepools. Turn around here or continue beach-walking up-coast (it's 10 more 
miles to Gaviota State Beach) for as long as time and tides permit.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: NORWAY ART COMPANY MAKES IT CRYSTAL CLEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

JEVNAKER, Norway 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Norwegians love fine handblown glass and have high regard for the artists who 
design and create it. 
</P>
<P>
Hadeland Glassworks -- a complex containing factory, glass museum and outlet 
store -- attracts thousands of Norwegians and foreign tourists to Jevnaker, a 
quiet town on the wooded shores of Randsfjorden Lake, 44 miles north of Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1762, Hadeland is Norway's oldest glassworks. The factory makes only 
handblown glass -- a total of about 2 million sparkling objects each year. The 
products are sold at 105 shops throughout Norway, but foreign distribution is 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
Although not readily available in the United States, Hadeland's Peer Gynt 
full-lead crystal glasses are in the cupboards at the White House (they were 
added during the Johnson Administration). The Kennedy Center's magnificent 
chandelier designed by Jonas Hilde is a Hadeland piece. 
</P>
<P>
The Hadeland factory shop is well-stocked with about 35 different patterns of 
glasses. Each pattern has several styles of stemware and tumblers for wine, 
cocktails, champagne and beer. Also sold are carafes, vases and bowls made in 
grades from ordinary glass to full-lead crystal. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a series of gleaming crystal figures of polar bears, arctic 
foxes, cats, snow owls, puffins and other creatures, as well as magnificent 
art-glass pieces designed by Hadeland's master artists. 
</P>
<P>
First-quality items are priced the same as Hadeland products elsewhere in 
Norway, but there are often special sales of 20% or 25% off selected 
merchandise, as well as fantastic bargains on seconds with barely perceptible 
flaws. Seconds are usually half the price of first-quality goods. 
</P>
<P>
Sonja-pattern wine glasses with a distinctive air pocket at the bottom of the 
glass, for example, are from about $25 per glass for first-quality and $12 per 
glass for seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The shop also sells Hadeland art glass, with pieces from about $250 and up. 
</P>
<P>
Inger Magnus uses pastel pinks, mauves, blues and greens with opalescent white 
to create wave-like patterns in her bowls and platters. 
</P>
<P>
Some Willy Johansson vases have clear, square-cut sides and rounded interiors 
lined with red. Others have opalescent sides lined with deep blue or mauve. 
</P>
<P>
Arne Jon Jutrem vases have clear, prism-like edges and blue and red interiors. 
</P>
<P>
Edla Freij's thick, clear crystal bowls are shaped like pear halves and have 
layers of red or blue inside the crystal. 
</P>
<P>
Gro Bergslein's graceful bowls, vases and platters have swirling free-form 
designs of blue, black and silver. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the shop are seconds in art glass made by apprentice glass blowers. 
They sell for as little as $75. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to bargains, Hadeland offers visitors the chance to see the 
glass-blowing process. With roaring furnaces and molten glass glowing bright 
red, the factory atmosphere is thrilling. 
</P>
<P>
The molten glass is passed gracefully from one set of hands to another, with a 
team of workers participating in a complex ballet of industrial choreography 
that requires years of training but takes less than 10 minutes to execute. The 
result: a sparkling work of art. After observing the dance, it's impossible not 
to appreciate the glass objects. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinary Hadeland glass (containing mainly sand, soda and limestone) is its 
simplest and least expensive product. Colored glass, such as the most popular 
tints of gray and sea green, is produced by the addition of metal oxides to the 
normal glass: cobalt and copper oxides for blue, chromium and iron oxides for 
green, sulfur and metal sulfides for yellow, and gold and copper and selenium 
for red. Opaline glass, a whitish, opaque substance, is used to accent ordinary 
or colored glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Crystalline, used to make quality glass products for daily use, contains zinc, 
barium, potassium and lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal, the finest and most expensive type of glass, contains at least 30.5% 
red lead oxide, is heavier than crystalline and ordinary glass and has more 
sparkle. It has a softer surface, required for intricate cutting and engraving. 
When struck, crystal produces a sustained bell-like tone. 
</P>
<P>
Full-lead crystal is not recommended for daily use because it scratches easily. 
Hadeland produces ordinary, crystalline and full-lead lines. Full lead is about 
double the price of crystalline. 
</P>
<P>
The full range of Hadeland glass can be seen in the museum, which has more than 
15,000 pieces, ranging from items made in the 1760s to contemporary works. 
There are remarkable examples of cut crystal, popular from the 1850s to the 
turn of the century, as well as jugendstil and Deco styles. 
</P>
<P>
Also exhibited are priceless pieces by Benny Motzfeldt, who uses metal strips 
or grids encased in crystal to create rough textures and asymmetrical surfaces. 
Motzfeldt is generally regarded as Norway's leading glass artist. 
</P>
<P>
To get to Jevnaker from Oslo, take the public bus to Honefoss (run by Engseth, 
with frequent departures from Universitetsplassen) and change to the Jevnaker 
bus. Tell the driver you want to go to Hadeland and you'll be dropped off 
outside the factory. The trip takes about an hour and 50 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Hadeland glass is also sold in Oslo at Norway Designs, Stortingsgatan 28. This 
superb shop also carries contemporary Motzfeldt pieces, one-of-a-kind goblets, 
plates and bowls by Kai Hoffstad and items by other independent Norwegian glass 
blowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices quoted in this article reflect currency exchange rates at the time of 
writing. Hadeland and Norway Designs participate in the tax-free program that 
rebates 10% to 15% on items purchased for export. Ask salesclerks for the forms 
that will allow you to claim the refund at the airport before leaving Norway.

YOUTH BEAT: HOSTEL TO OPEN IN BEIJING IN SPRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BEIJING, China 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Work has resumed on what will be the first official international youth hostel 
in China. Expected to open next spring, funding for the hostel is being 
provided by the International Youth Hostel Federation. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, as a result of the Tian An Men Square violence, tourism to China 
plummeted, sales of the backpackers' favorite guidebook (Lonely Planet's "China 
-- A Travel Survival Kit") ground almost to a halt, and federation funding for 
the hostel was put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of recent discussions between IYHF and the China Youth Travel 
Service (CYTS), financing has resumed and work is proceeding. Money for the 
project comes from a portion of membership fees charged by national youth 
hostel associations in 59 participating countries. 
</P>
<P>
The Beijing hostel's success is important for future independent travelers 
because it will provide them with a home base, allowing them to share 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Such information is often the best "up-to-date" source on budget travel. 
</P>
<P>
The hostel will be designed in the style of a traditional Beijing home -- a 
complex for three or four families surrounding a courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
It will have four courtyards and a restaurant and will be located in the former 
Lu Song Yuan Hotel, at 22 Jiao Dou Kou Lu, which is north of the China Art 
Gallery. From the train station, the hostel will be reachable by bus No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, if you want to find other young independent travelers, try the 
Qiao Yuan Hotel on Dongbinhe Lu, near the moat (you can reach it from the 
center of the city on bus No. 20). 
</P>
<P>
The hotel's popularity is more likely owing to its listing in a popular budget 
guide -- rather than due to the quality of its budget rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Because washrooms are poorly maintained, I don't recommend staying in the older 
building even though many young travelers do. 
</P>
<P>
Doubles cost about $9.50 per person, and beds in 15-bunk dormitory rooms are 
about $2.40. Conditions are better in the newer building, where double rooms 
are about $14 per person. All doubles have air conditioning and television. (In 
China, you can get English-language television news each evening at 10 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
The good news about the Qiao Yuan Hotel is that it has currency exchange 
facilities, long-distance telephone service and rental bikes that cost about 70 
cents per day. Also, for a small service charge, hotel officials will book rail 
tickets, although this should be done six days in advance. 
</P>
<P>
At the hotel, guests can sign up for economical day-trips to the Ming tombs and 
the Great Wall. Cost for the all-day trips is about $6. 
</P>
<P>
Travel in China is still a controversial issue. Some young travelers are 
choosing not to go as a way of protesting government actions. Others think that 
traveling and having contact with the people, despite one's feelings about the 
government, is a positive move.

By CINDY AVAKIAN is program manager at KBRT-AM, a Christian talk-radio station 
in Costa Mesa. Avakian and KBRT have called for protests and boycotts against 
changes in the rating system for adult films. She told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm concerned about the showing of NC-17 (adults only) films in malls and 
multiplex theaters because it's easily accessible to kids and teen-agers. A 
young person might buy a ticket for another movie, but, once inside, they could 
probably get into any of the movies. 
</P>
<P>
The new rating essentially replaces the X rating. I think NC-17 has a softer 
image than an X. 
</P>
<P>
Pornographic films eat away from people on the inside and we can see the 
results on the outside. One study said sexually suggestive films increase 
aggressive behavior toward women. 
</P>
<P>
Showing these films in neighborhood theaters sends communities into a downward 
spiral in terms of upholding good family values and good morals. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think it's realistic to think the industry will cease making X-rated 
films. But if these films were banned from neighborhood theaters, that would be 
one step in the right direction.

DON'T CONFUSE MESSAGE WITH THE MESSENGER; 
</P>
<P>
THE BIG TURNOUT FOR DAVID DUKE WAS A VOTE OF FRUSTRATION BY EMBATTLED WORKING 
PEOPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
David Duke -- former Ku Klux Klan leader, anti-Semite, smut peddler, fabulist 
-- does cosmetic surgery on his face and his past and gets 60% of the white 
vote in Louisiana in a U.S. Senate race. Louisiana is sending a message but you 
have to listen hard to get it right. 
</P>
<P>
Don't confuse the message with the messenger. Racial scars still run deep in 
this society. Racial fears are easy to fan when times are hard and people are 
scared. Yet surely many voted for Duke to send a message, not to embrace the 
messenger. 
</P>
<P>
Working people in Louisiana -- like working people everywhere -- are struggling 
to get by, worried about their jobs, about educating their children, about 
caring for their parents. White and black, they voted their frustration at the 
conditions that face them. Whites cast ballots for Duke; blacks stayed home, 
with turnout 15% less than whites, despite the threat that Duke posed. 
</P>
<P>
Times are hard in Louisiana. Duke made affirmative action the threat -- 
"they're going to take your job." One Duke voter told of a friend who could not 
get a scholarship to college, while an African-American got one despite a lower 
grade average. Both were qualified. The problem wasn't affirmative action but 
the shame of a society that is slashing access to scholarships and loans for 
qualified young people. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks are not taking jobs from whites; multinational corporations are taking 
the jobs of both abroad, using cheap labor to displace American workers. Blacks 
are not taxing whites. Rich people and corporations have used their power to 
avoid paying their fair share of taxes, putting an ever greater burden on 
people of modest means. Blacks are not stealing opportunities from whites in 
this society. Who gets the inside track, a leg up? Surely not working people of 
whatever color, but the privileged, the Neil Bushes whose incredibly sweet 
deals come out of the pockets of working Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana voters have shown they are fed up and fearful, as well they should 
be. But we must learn to turn to each other, not on each other, to leave racial 
battleground for economic common ground. 
</P>
<P>
In this regard, we have come a long way from where we started. The vote for 
Duke is good cause for alarm, but his defeat should not go unnoticed. Forty 
years ago, a David Duke might have won the Senate seat, running as a Democrat. 
A multiracial coalition reelected Bennett Johnston, as such coalitions have 
elected Democrats from Gov. Douglas Wilder in Virginia and Sen. Wyche Fowler in 
Georgia. There is a new majority in the new South. The Republican Party has 
enjoyed success fanning racial resentment. Yet it may find that to be the party 
of white exclusion is a weakness in a society that is inescapably multiracial 
and multicultural. 
</P>
<P>
To treat Duke as an exception is a deception. The national Republican Party has 
renounced him. But what distinguishes Duke from the mainstream Republican Party 
is his baggage, not his beliefs. Duke is manipulating the same racial symbols 
as the Republican Party did under Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Bush made 
Willie Horton the centerpiece of his campaign in 1988, opposes equal rights for 
women, threatens to veto the Civil Rights Act of 1990, posturing about quotas 
that do not exist. The Klan robes Duke wore in the past are an embarrassment, 
but his current views fit Republican fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Many Democrats see the passion and miss the point. Some even suggest that it is 
time to move away from the cause of racial justice. The conservative wing of 
the Democratic Party -- led by Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, who needs black 
votes to win reelection and should know better -- assaults affirmative action, 
claiming equal opportunity need not lead to equal results. But this course 
leads only to defeat and division. We must take Louisiana as a call for action, 
not sound the retreat. Real leaders must bring people together to find common 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
David Duke did better among the young than the old, among males than females. A 
generation of Americans is growing up, facing a future short of hope. We need 
to take the ceilings off their dreams. We need affirmative action for education 
for all Americans, affirmative action for affordable housing and health care, 
affirmative action to rebuild our country. 
</P>
<P>
This week in Washington, the President and Congress are bickering over budgets 
that offer no scope for the young, no security for the poor, no support for 
working people. The President no doubt will win his fight to keep the rich and 
the corporations from paying their fair share of taxes. But America will be the 
loser, and we will pay, in futures lost, in dreams crushed, in hatreds 
inflamed. Unless we plow a new course, we leave fallow fields in which the 
David Dukes flourish like weeds in the summer.

BUSH HAS UNDERMINED HIS OWN PARTY; 
</P>
<P>
HE IS UNWILLING TO MAKE THE CASE FOR THE SIDE THAT ELECTED HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Make no mistake, President Bush and his senior advisers have lost badly in the 
budget wars. Headlines around the country represent the President as being 
confused and unsure of himself on taxes. He has only himself to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he campaigned and was elected on the plain and simple promise of 
no new taxes. Four months ago, he allowed himself to be persuaded by budget 
negotiators that "tax revenue increases" were needed to reduce the deficit. 
There was a gleam in the TV anchormen's eyes that night. Journalists covering 
the White House knew a fatal compromise when they saw one. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, things have not gone well for the GOP. After months of secret 
meetings, a deal was worked out with Democratic leaders. Rep. Robert Walker 
(R-Pa.) has been one of the few to point out that the deal included $150 
billion in spending increases and $134 billion in new taxes to pay for them. 
Some deficit reduction. Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House minority whip, 
saw this as a repudiation of the Republicans' defining issue. The GOP was 
unwittingly aligning itself with the Democrats. He opposed the deal, and a few 
days later it was voted down in the House. 
</P>
<P>
We are now back to partisan budget-making, which at least has the virtue of 
clarity. Republicans, however, remain gravely undermined because the President 
no longer stands for much of anything on the domestic front. Indeed, it is 
possible that within a week or two he will actually be campaigning for a 
package of tax increases voted through by Democrats in Congress. In which case 
he will have made a 180-degree turn on his most potent issue. 
</P>
<P>
Since June, when he changed his mind on taxes, Bush's repeated displays of 
philosophical aimlessness have confirmed the worst fears of conservatives. His 
goal in the budget struggle, he said recently, is to show "that we can still 
govern." But governing is not an end in itself. The pursuit of a well-defined 
political goal requires vision -- already dismissed by Bush as "the vision 
thing." Then again, he said a few days ago that he aspired "to keep the process 
moving forward." As has been repeatedly shown in recent years, "the process" 
will take unwary politicians to unsuspected destinations. 
</P>
<P>
In pursuing a bipartisan deal, secretly negotiated, Bush showed not only a 
distaste for politics but also a failure to understand the passions that 
animate politics. In the nature of things, there can be no satisfactory 
bipartisan solution to the problem of deficit spending because the country is 
deeply divided on the relevant issues. The President seems not to grasp the 
reality of this division, which cannot be papered over in private meetings. 
Strikingly, a few days ago Bush conceded that he was not comfortable with 
domestic politics. In foreign affairs, by contrast, "people really basically 
want to support the President," he said. But a President uncomfortable with 
domestic affairs is not in the right line of business. 
</P>
<P>
There is only one way that the problem of the federal budget can be sensibly 
addressed, and that is for the President to take his case to the American 
people. He could use the media, which is forever at his disposal. He could say: 
"Americans are overtaxed," or: "I would like to try to cut back on the size of 
government and I need your help." He could show that he perceives the political 
fault lines and is willing to make the case for the side that elected him. But 
this is what he will not do, and it can only be because he does not feel 
strongly enough about the issues to take such a stand. President Reagan showed 
that a conservative message is also a winning one. But President Bush seems not 
to have absorbed this lesson in his eight years as Reagan's vice president. 
That is why conservatives are disheartened at this moment. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this. Last weekend, the government was briefly shut down -- but at a 
time when tourists and museum visitors were hurt, not federal employees. 
Nonetheless, it was a perilous moment for bureaucrats because the unwelcome 
distinction was publicly made between "essential" and "non-essential" workers: 
87,000 of the latter at the Department of Health and Human Services, for 
example, 80,000 in the Department of Agriculture, 30,000 in the Commerce 
Department. But on Monday morning, they were all back at work, and Bush held a 
press conference in which he said: "I want to recognize the valiant federal 
work force that had to suffer through some uncertainty in this period." Is he 
on their side, then? There has been much talk of shared sacrifice, pain to be 
borne equally by all Americans. Are government workers alone to be exempt from 
this? If Bush showed that he understood this issue, conservatives would be 
encouraged. And at this late date, surprised.

SALVAGE OF BUDGET ACCORD A TEST OF BUSH'S INFLUENCE; 
</P>
<P>
NEWS ANALYSIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks after he endorsed a bipartisan budget agreement that was then 
rejected by the House, President Bush is facing a major challenge to his 
influence over domestic policy: How much of the original $500-billion 
deficit-reduction package can be salvaged? 
</P>
<P>
Although House Democrats insist they will stand by the same targets for cutting 
the federal deficit as were in the accord, they are drafting a sweeping 
revision that drops many of the key budget changes that the President wanted 
and adds some that he strongly opposes. 
</P>
<P>
The new Democratic alternative is considered likely to pass the House this week 
-- possibly with some Republican votes. 
</P>
<P>
Some senior White House officials fear that the Administration's power to shape 
the budget process has been so weakened during the last two weeks of political 
skirmishing that the White House may get far less than it once hoped. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.), a senior member of the House Ways and Means 
Committee, predicts that the most likely outcome is that lawmakers will drop 
the most controversial parts of the original package and settle for a decidedly 
smaller cut in the deficit instead. 
</P>
<P>
The change has serious implications. Charles L. Schultze, former budget 
director for President Lyndon B. Johnson, said that despite its faults the 
original accord was "the first one in memory that really did something serious 
to resolve the budget situation." 
</P>
<P>
While it still is possible that the White House may strike a meaningful new 
deficit-reduction agreement with Congress, "I wouldn't bet the farm on 
anything," Schultze said in a telephone interview Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of a significant cut in the deficit, in turn, could spell real trouble 
for the nation's economy. If the United States can't get its fiscal house in 
order, financial markets could plunge into turmoil and send the dollar 
plummeting even faster on the foreign exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
With Washington still heavily dependent on borrowing abroad, it could 
jeopardize Bush's ability to finance the U.S. deployment in the Persian Gulf. 
The British had to turn back from a similar venture involving the Suez Canal in 
1956 because of a currency crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who has decided to play only a passive role for now, was expected to 
throw his support behind a fallback deficit-cutting plan approved by the Senate 
Finance Committee early Saturday and endorsed by the Democratic and Republican 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The committee plan would reduce the deficit by $192 billion over the next five 
years -- a major component of the $500-billion target in the original accord -- 
by relying on an increase in the gasoline tax, higher tax rates for the rich 
and higher Medicare payroll taxes. 
</P>
<P>
While Bush's advisers say he prefers the finance committee plan to the 
alternative being pushed by House Democrats, he likely will wait until the two 
houses have settled on a single compromise budget package before making his 
next move. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said Saturday in an interview on CNN's 
"Newsmaker Saturday" that Bush will not try to influence the outcome of this 
coming week's expected budget showdowns in the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball is now in Congress' court," Brady said. "When the President sees that 
legislation, he'll react to it and decide what to do. . . . The President has 
no role in the (budget) reconciliation process. . . . He'll react to it." 
</P>
<P>
If Bush remains a passive bystander in the budget battle -- a sharp departure 
from his approach in previous legislative fracases -- the shape of the package 
is likely to be decided primarily by a Senate-House conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the President's veto remains a powerful weapon in the battle over 
deficit reduction. As Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) 
conceded last week: "We can't pass it (a budget plan) without his signature." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who also is a member of the finance committee, called the panel's 
package "a fair compromise." His GOP counterpart, Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) 
declared it to be "right and necessary." 
</P>
<P>
But House Democrats have taken a different tack, backing a plan by House Ways 
and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) that would sharpen the 
difference between the two parties by enacting a populist tax package that puts 
the greatest burden on the rich. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has warned repeatedly that unless Congress enacts a deficit-reduction bill 
by Friday he will shut down the government again on Saturday, when the legal 
authority for current federal spending -- a stopgap resolution approved a week 
ago -- expires. 
</P>
<P>
But if he rejects the Democrats' alternative -- particularly if it focuses the 
deficit-reduction burden on the wealthiest 10% of American taxpayers, as the 
Democrats now plan -- Bush will face a real political dilemma: He will have to 
call for larger tax hikes for the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Republicans who must face the voters on Nov. 6 are complaining that 
they are being pictured unfairly as protectors of the rich, while Democrats are 
portraying themselves as advocates for middle-income and lower-income 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
And even Republican political activists concede that Bush's twists and turns on 
budget policy have disheartened his GOP allies in the House and sent the 
President's approval ratings into a tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
One key issue is whether consumers will face a doubling of gasoline taxes, as 
provided by the Senate Finance Committee proposal, or whether gas taxes remain 
the same and the wealthiest Americans pay higher income taxes, as the House 
Democrats prefer. 
</P>
<P>
Even House Republicans, while sharply divided over whether to present their own 
alternative, are virtually unanimous against voting higher gasoline taxes with 
the November elections only three weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly in the House, the Democratic proposals are designed to take 
maximum advantage of the President's dilemma, by currying more favor with 
middle-income voters by providing them with more tax breaks at the expense of 
wealthier taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski has proposed a novel plan to allow the vast majority of taxpayers 
to enjoy up to $100,000 worth of capital gains during their lifetimes, except 
for profits from the sale of securities. 
</P>
<P>
Another proposal would allow tax-free profits of up to $1,000 each year from 
the sale of stocks and bonds. Both would concentrate the benefits at those 
earning less than $100,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
For now, one major difference between the President and the lawmakers is that 
he still seems to regard the defeated budget summit accord as a worthwhile 
exercise, while they see it as a bust that failed to take account of political 
realities. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate's Mitchell, who was one of the summit negotiators, said Saturday 
that Bush's adamant stand in favor of a $60-billion reduction in Medicare 
spending was the "biggest single problem" at the summer-long talks on the 
budget accord. 
</P>
<P>
The Medicare cuts spawned a vehement backlash among the elderly that was a 
principal factor in the 254-179 House vote that buried the deficit reduction 
package. 
</P>
<P>
"What we need is a better blend of political reality and budget necessity," 
Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Schultze and other analysts warn that if Congress and the White 
House don't make serious inroads into reducing the deficit, it will leave the 
budget situation -- and the country -- in far more serious straits in 1991 and 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
With the economy heading into a possible recession and the United States 
possibly on the brink of war, the job won't get any easier, Schultze points 
out.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is Aug. 3, Iraqi troops have invaded Kuwait, and President Bush has flown to 
the Colorado Rockies for a meeting with British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher and a speech to the Aspen Institute. 
</P>
<P>
As he begins his address, Bush pauses to thank his national security adviser, 
Brent Scowcroft. He looks around and finds him standing at the edge of the 
stage, half-concealed among a collection of potted palms. 
</P>
<P>
In memory, it seems as if Scowcroft has always been there, half-hidden near 
some President's side. 
</P>
<P>
There he was, two decades ago, the White House military aide, carrying the 
briefcase containing codes for nuclear war as Richard M. Nixon strode through 
history. 
</P>
<P>
There he was, telling Gerald R. Ford of the helicopter evacuation of the 
American Embassy in Saigon at the close of a war that Scowcroft still believes 
the United States could have won. 
</P>
<P>
And here he is now, the short, slender, balding figure at Bush's side -- at the 
golf course, on the speedboat, in the Oval Office, the ever present adviser, 
the confidant. The man who wakes the President up in the middle of the night 
with news of war. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past year and a half, no other Bush adviser has had more influence on 
the agenda of American national security policy -- from the "go-slow" approach 
toward changes in the Soviet Union to the drastic scaling back of Ronald 
Reagan's brainchild, the "Star Wars" space-based Strategic Defense Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
And today, as the United States inches toward war in the Persian Gulf, the path 
it is following is one that has been laid out by Brent Scowcroft, the man in 
the background. 
</P>
<P>
For a man who has played a key role in national affairs for nearly 20 years, 
Scowcroft remains almost unknown. A deeply private man -- "I've never been to 
his house," says one longtime friend. "I don't know anyone who has" -- 
Scowcroft has appeared in countless newspaper photographs and television clips. 
But he is almost always in the shadows. 
</P>
<P>
In a capital full of officials energetically creating larger-than-life public 
personas, Scowcroft has cultivated anonymity. His spacious White House office, 
dominated by a score or more of neatly stacked piles of paper, each with the 
top sheet turned over to avoid prying eyes, contains not a single personal 
photograph and only one memento -- the three-star flag of an Air Force 
lieutenant general, the rank with which he left active duty. 
</P>
<P>
Others in Washington seek power by publicity. Scowcroft has cultivated a 
different route -- proximity. His thin, reedy voice, which has the timbre of a 
clarinet without the lower register, does not carry far. But seldom has it had 
to travel more than a few feet to reach the President's ear. 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft's image in Washington's energetic gossip mill is more that of an 
institution than of a person. "People talk about 'the Scowcroft Model,' " says 
one White House official who has worked closely with him, suggesting the way 
the individual has been able to disappear behind the image of the institution. 
</P>
<P>
The image is that of the discreet, hard-working, self-effacing coordinator, 
above all that of a man "who doesn't have ideas or an agenda of his own." And 
that, says the official, "just ain't true." 
</P>
<P>
Still, parts of the image are correct: hard-working, for example. Scowcroft 
routinely arrives at his desk in the White House West Wing by 7 in the morning 
and is nearly always there until 8 or 9 at night. 
</P>
<P>
And discreet, as well. Scowcroft's thin lips are quick to break into a smile. 
They are also quick to purse tightly shut. Words leave his mouth slowly, with 
long pauses between phrases, each carefully weighed to ensure that they contain 
not a gram more of information than their author wishes to convey. 
</P>
<P>
Henry A. Kissinger, a former national security adviser himself, recalled in his 
memoirs that when he won the Nobel Prize for his role in the Paris peace talks, 
it was Scowcroft, then his deputy, who passed him the word. In the middle of a 
meeting, Scowcroft handed Kissinger a copy of a news wire story announcing the 
award. He did so, Kissinger recalled, without a word of comment. 
</P>
<P>
Even close aides often do not know what he has in mind. When Bush announced his 
Helsinki summit meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, among the 
many people surprised by the announcement was Condoleeza Rice, the NSC's 
director for Soviet affairs -- and one of Scowcroft's most trusted deputies. 
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing, Scowcroft had unabashedly "stonewalled" reporters asking 
about rumors of a summit, declining even to hint that something was planned 
until Bush interrupted the session by calling to say that the announcement was 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was doing pretty well," Scowcroft quipped when Press Secretary 
Marlin Fitzwater handed him a note telling him he could stop refusing to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
And he is self-effacing, as well. Until recently, Scowcroft almost never spoke 
to reporters for quotation or appeared on a television interview. In large part 
because of the long illness of his wife, Marian, who has been an invalid for 
most of the time that Scowcroft has been in the public eye, he seldom appears 
at Washington social events. 
</P>
<P>
The avoidance of publicity is often mistaken for an absence of ego. And the 
presumed lack of ego caused many to assume -- when Scowcroft accepted the job 
as White House national security adviser -- that he would play a sharply 
restricted role, sandwiched between an energetic President with extensive 
foreign policy experience and the President's closest friend, James A. Baker 
III, as secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
As Ford's national security adviser -- following Kissinger, who remained 
secretary of state -- Scowcroft had had a relatively confined role. But this 
time, he made clear to friends, he had a different concept of the job in mind. 
</P>
<P>
In Bush, Scowcroft told friends, the country had a President with extensive 
knowledge and experience in foreign affairs, but one who was more comfortable 
with handling problems one at a time than with developing overall strategy. 
Nor, he believed, would strategy come from Baker -- a master tactician but an 
impatient one and one with relatively little experience in foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Strategy, Scowcroft made clear, would be his job. 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft "does not see himself as being only a general or only a policy 
adviser to presidents," says his friend, John Deutch, a former deputy secretary 
of energy and now provost of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "He 
sees himself as one of the individuals in this country who really understands 
three things that are vital: foreign affairs, the military and domestic 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft's aides delight in telling stories about his ability to fall asleep 
during meetings, even sessions with Bush. The White House staff has even 
invented a "Scowcroft Award" for the person who most blatantly falls asleep in 
public. 
</P>
<P>
But what is often missed among the jokes is what stunning self-confidence such 
easy dozing reflects: Few people are sure enough in their position to fall 
asleep on the President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"He's 65 years old. He's made his mark. He's at ease with himself," says 
Scowcroft's deputy, Robert M. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
Bush puts the matter another way. Among his ambitious advisers, the President 
reportedly has told friends, he trusts Scowcroft because "Brent doesn't want 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
As a child, Scowcroft recalled in an interview recently, what he did want -- 
from the age of 12 when he read a book about the U.S. Military Academy -- was 
to attend West Point. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1925, Scowcroft was the only son and youngest child of a prosperous, 
influential family in Ogden, Utah, a city of 42,000 just north of Salt Lake 
City, dominated by the rail yards of the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific 
that made the town the largest freight-switching center between Omaha and the 
West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
His father ran a wholesale grocery business serving the mostly Mormon 
communities of northern Utah and southern Idaho. The business succeeded so well 
that shortly after the birth of his son, James Scowcroft built a new house for 
his family in the foothills of the Wasatch Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The young Brent Scowcroft was a bright student. "Brent was a speed reader when 
we didn't know what speed-reading was," recalls his oldest sister, Janice 
Hinckley. "In elementary school, the principal wanted to skip him a few 
grades," she says. Their father rejected that idea, feeling that his slightly 
built son would be unable to take part in sports if he were thrust among older 
boys. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he was put on a special reading program and ran track -- 100-yard 
dashes -- as he passed through high school. 
</P>
<P>
By then, the nation was at war. When the family traveled east in the fall of 
1942 to examine colleges for Brent, they stopped at West Point to allow Janice 
to visit her fiance, a cadet at the academy and the son of a high official in 
the Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration. 
</P>
<P>
One look around the campus and the decision was made. "I don't think there ever 
was a point when I said, 'I want a career in the military,' " Scowcroft 
recalls. West Point, he says, "just sounded fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
He enrolled in the class of 1947. And in a move that foreshadowed the sort of 
roles he would take on later, he quickly became a manager of the Army football 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't big enough to play, but he wanted to make a contribution," recalls 
his classmate and friend Air Force Gen. William Y. Smith, now the head of the 
Pentagon's Institute for Defense Analysis. "He always wanted to do that." 
</P>
<P>
In 1948, Scowcroft earned his wings as a fighter pilot. And then, flying a 
training exercise in a P-51 Mustang over a forested region of New Hampshire, "I 
lost the engine," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was too low to bail out," Scowcroft says, matter-of-factly 
describing the crash that nearly killed him. He found a small clearing and went 
in. 
</P>
<P>
The crash -- "I prefer to call it a forced landing," he says -- broke 
Scowcroft's back and left him in a military hospital in Boston for two years. 
When his father died later that year at the age of 57, Scowcroft flew back to 
Utah in a body cast, stretched out in the aisle of the airplane. 
</P>
<P>
In the hospital, Scowcroft met his future wife, a military nurse who, as a 
captain, then outranked the young lieutenant. There, too, he began what would 
become his lifelong career, deciding to earn a graduate degree and become part 
of a new weapon that the American military was developing -- a group of people 
who would become known as the "defense intellectuals." 
</P>
<P>
World War II had convinced many American leaders that brainpower -- in both the 
hard sciences and the social sciences -- could be a major military asset for 
the United States. In time, the community of defense intellectuals would grow 
to be enormous, spinning off institutions ranging from the national weapons 
laboratories to think tanks such as Santa Monica's RAND Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In time, too, many of the young men (and a few women) who devoted their 
brainpower to the national security apparatus -- "the best and the brightest," 
in writer David Halberstam's phrase -- would grow disillusioned by the horrible 
failure of their strategies and weapons in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
But in the early 1950s, when Scowcroft, then married, finished his graduate 
program at New York's Columbia University and took a teaching post at West 
Point, the defense intellectual community was still young, idealistic and 
small. 
</P>
<P>
At West Point, the chief proponent of the role of intellect in war -- and a 
chief recruiter of intellectuals for the Cold War -- was the head of the 
school's social sciences department, Col. George A. (Abe) Lincoln, an adviser 
to George C. Marshall, the onetime Army chief of staff who later became 
secretary of state. Lincoln was one of Scowcroft's early mentors. 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft is not a man whom others recall as ever seeming young. Even as a 
junior faculty member at West Point, Scowcroft was "a very serious guy," 
recalls another classmate and friend, Wesley Posvar, now chancellor of the 
University of Pittsburgh. "I don't think Brent has changed much in the past 40 
years, even in appearance," Posvar says. 
</P>
<P>
Nor, as he advanced through a series of choice career posts -- air attache at 
the American Embassy in Yugoslavia, stints at the Armed Forces Staff College, 
the National War College and the Air Force Academy, and staff jobs at Air Force 
Headquarters and the Pentagon -- did Scowcroft fundamentally alter the beliefs 
that had animated his career at the outset. 
</P>
<P>
They are a set of assumptions that once were virtually a consensus among 
American policy-makers, but which now have become embattled: a belief that 
America's No. 1 international interest is its relationship with Europe; an 
emphasis on the strategic competition with the Soviet Union, rather than 
economic competition with other industrial nations; an insistence that the 
United States must maintain the role as military and political leader of the 
Western alliance, and a willingness to use military power as an instrument of 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
Even the experience of Vietnam, which traumatized so many of his colleagues, 
seems to have left Scowcroft relatively unscathed. "I was not in the group that 
became disillusioned," Scowcroft says, " -- the ones who were involved in the 
policy, and then, if you will, became ashamed." 
</P>
<P>
Having spent the war years in military academia and long-range planning posts 
before moving to the White House as Nixon's military aide in 1972, Scowcroft 
continues to believe, he said, "that even as late as the Paris peace agreement" 
in 1972, "(the Vietnam War) could have worked if we had done it differently." 
</P>
<P>
During Ronald Reagan's tenure, Scowcroft's beliefs set him at odds with the 
Administration's ideological hard-liners. He worked as an executive for the 
international consulting firm that Kissinger founded, traveling the world 
meeting with leaders of nations and multinational corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Although Reagan named Scowcroft to head a commission to study U.S. strategic 
forces -- a panel that helped establish his reputation as a policy-maker 
independent of Kissinger -- Administration policy makers kept him at arm's 
length. 
</P>
<P>
And Scowcroft became a sharp critic of the Administration's policies. No 
overall strategic sense seemed to animate either Reagan's huge military buildup 
or the Administration's policies toward arms control, he argued. Scowcroft 
opposed the bombing of Libya, believing that economic sanctions should have 
been used against Moammar Kadafi. And he criticized the mining of Nicaragua's 
harbors, saying the operation had been too costly politically, damaging the CIA 
and harming American ability to use covert actions in the future. 
</P>
<P>
But while he argued that the Administration was too quick to use force against 
little countries, he was even more critical of then-Secretary of Defense Caspar 
W. Weinberger's restrictive criteria for when military power should be used. 
Weinberger's policies, he argued, meant that armed might could be employed only 
in no-risk adventures such as Grenada or in "crusades" such as World War II. 
</P>
<P>
In Weinberger's reluctance to let the military be used, Scowcroft discerned a 
hangover from Vietnam -- a fear on the part of military leaders that if they 
once again became involved in a major conflict they would, once again, find 
themselves without public support. 
</P>
<P>
For him, and for Bush, the current crisis in the gulf has been, in part, a 
chance to show the world that America's post-Vietnam blues are over. 
</P>
<P>
American goals, he believes, are fundamentally good. And the nation should not 
be reluctant to threaten the use of force to achieve those goals, not only in 
cases where absolute national survival is at risk, but also in cases, as in the 
gulf, where the stakes include the economic health of America's allies and the 
political strength of international institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to deter Saddam Hussein, he says, would "give a green light to every 
tinhorn dictator" in the world. At the same time, he has resisted pressure from 
many outside the Administration -- and some within -- who argue that the United 
States should pledge now to use force not only to push Hussein out of Kuwait, 
but also to destroy Iraq's war machine and end Hussein's rule. Just as the 
country should not be reluctant to use force when necessary, he argues, it 
should not overestimate the ability of military power to solve all problems nor 
underestimate the unpredictability of war. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, Scowcroft thought he might not return to government. Well paid in 
the consulting business -- he earned more than $500,000 in 1988 -- he told Bush 
in 1987 that he would advise his campaign, but that he desired no job after the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
But Scowcroft's personality -- co-workers and friends describe him over and 
over with adjectives such as fair, calm, disciplined, cautious, pragmatic, 
careful, unflappable -- and his experience fit the description of the person 
Bush wanted to head his National Security Council. The two are old friends who 
share similar senses of humor. They have known each other since the days when 
Bush was Ford's CIA director and Scowcroft the national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
So when the call came, Scowcroft could not say no. 
</P>
<P>
The chance to influence the course of events once more, to be at the center of 
them, could not be turned away. International affairs, he explains, "are not 
only my profession, but my hobby." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as one senior Bush aide puts it, Scowcroft "is a man who lives for his 
work." 
</P>
<P>
The gulf crisis has magnified Scowcroft's influence in the Administration. The 
need to coordinate both military and diplomatic policy has prevented either 
Baker or Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney from dominating the stage alone. 
</P>
<P>
And Baker, preferring to concentrate his energies in one or two areas that he 
can control, has not tried to challenge Scowcroft's lead, instead sticking 
close to the negotiations with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze 
over the future shape of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Bush's own personal day-to-day involvement in the details of the 
policy have ensured that the crisis is run out of the White House, rather than 
the Pentagon or the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft serves as Bush's counselor, his sounding board and often, even, as 
his speech writer. The night before Bush gave his early morning Oval Office 
speech announcing that he had dispatched troops to Saudi Arabia, Scowcroft and 
his Middle East deputy, Richard Haas, sat on the couch in Scowcroft's office 
until 3:30 a.m., revising the speech word by word. After a few hours of rest, 
they returned before 7 for a final check. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the Iraqi invasion, however, Scowcroft was in a clear ascendancy. 
</P>
<P>
During the Administration's first year, he had crafted an overall foreign 
policy strategy for Bush that emphasized a cautious approach to the Soviets and 
focused on maintaining NATO with Germany as a central member of the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
The critics, who were legion, said that Scowcroft's innate caution, reinforcing 
Bush's own aversion to risk, was itself running the risk of missing the 
historic opportunities offered by Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, with the Berlin Wall down, Germany unified, NATO intact and the 
Warsaw Pact essentially gone, Scowcroft and his aides are understandably 
feeling vindicated -- enough so that the critics' charge of plodding 
unoriginality has become an in-house joke. 
</P>
<P>
"Brent has a turtle-like demeanor," said one aide. "He just keeps moving 
forward slow but steady, and he always gets to the end."

<P>
For President Bush and his Persian Gulf policy, the weeklong debate at the 
United Nations that ended in a relatively mild censure of Israel over the 
killing of 19 Palestinians was a perilous exercise in which a single misstep 
could have spelled disaster. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the U.S. government dodged the bullet this time. But the 
action demonstrated just how fragile and delicately balanced the American-led 
coalition against Iraq really is. 
</P>
<P>
If the U.N. Security Council had voted on a much harsher PLO-backed resolution 
instead of the U.S.-British draft that it passed unanimously, the United States 
would have been forced into a veto. That veto might have split the coalition 
and certainly would have caused serious political damage to Washington's Arab 
allies in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been potentially very serious if the United States had to use 
its veto," said Robert Hunter, a former National Security Council expert. "The 
(Arab) governments would understand because they know how the game is played. 
But there could have been a public reaction that would be impossible to 
calculate. 
</P>
<P>
"If the coalition falls apart, that increases the danger of war," continued 
Hunter, now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies in Washington. "Bush can't back down. I don't believe that he wants 
war, but if the coalition collapses, that means the non-war option is exhausted 
and war is all that is left." 
</P>
<P>
Passage of the U.S.-backed resolution, Hunter said, "gets us through the 
immediate problem." 
</P>
<P>
From the Bush Administration's standpoint, the Security Council vote was a not 
a victory to be savored because it resulted in U.N. condemnation of 
Washington's closest ally in the Middle East. But defeat would have been far 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's ambassador to the United States, Sheik Saud al Nasir al Sabah, whose 
government, exiled by Iraq's invasion, will have the most to lose if the 
anti-Arab coalition begins to fray, said, "It would be damaging if there is a 
veto on any resolution." 
</P>
<P>
Saud insisted that there is no real linkage between the crisis in the Persian 
Gulf and the Arab-Israeli conflict, a point that the Bush Administration also 
has stressed repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people seem to think there is a connection between what is going on in 
Kuwait and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict," the ambassador told The Times' 
Washington bureau. "I don't see any connection here at all." 
</P>
<P>
But in the volatile Arab world, just about everything seems to be linked to 
just about everything else. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Kipper, a Middle East expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington, 
said the killing of the Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the U.N. debate that 
it spawned must be viewed very seriously "considering the violence that is 
sweeping the area." 
</P>
<P>
"They are two separate crises but the whole area is a puzzle," Kipper said. 
"When you move one piece, every other piece also moves." 
</P>
<P>
The danger, of course, is that any unexpected movement could push the region 
into war. 
</P>
<P>
"It is like Sarajevo in the sand," Hunter said, referring to the town in 
Yugoslavia where a seemingly unrelated assassination touched off the series of 
events that led to World War I. "Things that are external to the gulf crisis, 
like the situation in Jerusalem, can have a major impact." 
</P>
<P>
When Israeli security forces killed at least 19 Arab demonstrators on 
Jerusalem's Temple Mount on Monday, the fracas underlined the interlocking 
nature of the region's disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials claim that the Palestine Liberation Organization provoked the 
clash to reignite the sputtering Palestinian uprising against Israel. Saud, the 
Kuwaiti ambassador, accused Iraq of provoking the incident to divert attention 
from the invasion and occupation of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
On their side, Palestinians say Jewish religious zealots caused the conflict by 
trying to establish a foothold in the vicinity of Islam's third holiest shrine. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the validity of the conflicting claims -- and there was surely 
blame enough to go around -- there can be no doubt that Iraq exploited the 
incident at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
In alliance with the PLO, the Iraqis sought to force a Security Council vote on 
a resolution that Washington could never accept. 
</P>
<P>
Although Baghdad's interest was never concealed, the United States had to go 
through days of late-night meetings and behind-the-scenes arm-twisting to 
guarantee an outcome that it could live with. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the Security Council rebuffed the Iraqis, but the diplomatic 
struggle was far more difficult than the earlier council votes condemning the 
Iraqi invasion and annexation of Kuwait. For the time being, Washington's 
coalition has survived. But it may not be able to withstand much more of this 
kind of pressure.

U.N. EXPLOITS ARAB DEATHS, SHAMIR CHARGES

<P>
Responding with anger to a U.N. condemnation of Israel for the deaths of 
Palestinian rioters in Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir rejected any 
outside intervention as an attempt to punish his nation, Israel Radio reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's statement appeared to set up a diplomatic confrontation over the U.N. 
Security Council's decision to send a delegation to Jerusalem to probe last 
Monday's Temple Mount riot and the subsequent police response. However, 
government officials said a decision on whether to receive the U.N. team will 
be made today at a regularly scheduled Cabinet meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem is the pupil in the eye of the Jewish people, and it would be a 
crime to allow any external intervention," the radio quoted Shamir as saying. 
"The United Nations wanted to exploit the regrettable affair on the Temple 
Mount to gore Israel." 
</P>
<P>
The government was indignant that the United Nations did not hold Palestinian 
stone throwers responsible for provoking the turmoil at the Temple Mount in 
Jerusalem's Old City. Without the stoning of Jewish worshipers at the adjacent 
Western Wall, there would have been no shooting, Israeli officials argued. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no basis or justification for the resolution," said Avi Pazner, a 
spokesman for Shamir. "Israel has acted in self-defense to protect the safety 
of Jewish prayers attacked by an Arab mass." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli police shot and killed 19 Palestinians on the Temple Mount and wounded 
150, the Israeli government says. Palestinians put the death toll at 21. Stones 
hurled by Palestinians injured 22 Jewish worshipers at the Western Wall. 
</P>
<P>
The Shamir government is wary of the U.N. team. Officials say the inquiry could 
undermine Israel's claim to all of Jerusalem. Israel annexed Arab districts of 
the city after defeating an invasion of Arab armies in the 1967 Middle East 
War. Neither the United Nations nor the United States, Israel's strongest ally 
and chief foreign benefactor, recognize the annexation of the eastern half of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We are deliberately holding back on saying whether we will accept the 
investigation," said a government official, speaking on condition that he not 
be identified. "Basically, the issue for us is Jerusalem." 
</P>
<P>
The Shamir government also claims that the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip 
are, by historical right, part of Israel and are needed as a buffer against 
hostile neighbors. Israel has stopped short of annexing the occupied land. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials expressed dismay that Washington had a hand in crafting the 
resolution. They viewed the U.S. vote to condemn Israel as a payoff to Arab 
allies who have sent armies to confront Iraq over its invasion of Kuwait. The 
Israelis said that by backing the resolution, the Americans gave Iraqi leader 
Saddam Hussein a propaganda victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The resolution helps Saddam Hussein, who since the beginning (of the Persian 
Gulf conflict) has tried to divert attention from the crisis," said Pazner, the 
prime minister's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
In a bid to attract Arab support for his invasion of Kuwait, Hussein has linked 
any solution to the Persian Gulf crisis to simultaneous progress on ending the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council adopted the resolution unanimously Friday. It 
expressed alarm at the killings and welcomed a decision by U.N. Secretary 
General Javier Perez de Cuellar to send an investigative team. 
</P>
<P>
The United States last took a leading role in condemning Israel in 1982, when 
Israel invaded Lebanon. Since then, Washington's representatives have 
consistently vetoed as one-sided resolutions criticizing Israel. One exception 
occured in 1988, when the United States voted to condemn Israel's deportation 
of Palestinian activists. 
</P>
<P>
Independent observers viewed Washington's vote in the Security Council not only 
as a reaction to the bloodshed on the Temple Mount but also as a response to a 
long period of friction in its relations with Israel. Shamir has evaded Bush 
Administration efforts to organize Israeli-Palestinian talks. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows that Washington is mad at Israel," political commentator Aryeh 
Naor said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Yaron Ezrahi, a political theorist at Hebrew University: "This is just 
another step in the constant erosion of American support in the past few years. 
It shows impatience with Shamir, who has torpedoed any and all peace 
initiatives." 
</P>
<P>
Both observers questioned whether now is the right moment for the United States 
to express its unhappiness. They noted that the Israeli public, sensitive to 
any attack on the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site, is likely to close 
ranks in defense of the government. 
</P>
<P>
"The mood is defiant," Ezrahi said. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinians are critical of the U.N. action because they believe it is weak. 
</P>
<P>
"Condemnations cannot rub out the blood of the innocent people which was 
spilled in the yard of the mosque," said Radwan abu Ayash, a Palestinian 
nationalist aligned with the Palestine Liberation Organization. Abu Ayash 
called for U.N. troops to be sent in to protect Palestinians, a persistent PLO 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
Before Friday's U.N. vote, the PLO tried to persuade the Security Council to 
send its own investigative team, a maneuver widely seen here as an effort to 
install U.N. supervision in the occupied lands, including East Jerusalem. The 
panel to be sent by Perez de Cuellar has less clout than one sponsored by the 
Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has promised its own investigation of last Monday's violence, although 
from official statements, it appears that the main focus will be on the lack of 
police preparedness to confront the rioters. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, accounts of the violence published in Israeli newspapers are 
slowly giving shape to the chaotic event. 
</P>
<P>
The riot seemed to occur in three stages. First, a confrontation took place 
between police and Palestinians gathered to protest a reported effort by a 
group of Jewish fundamentalists to lay the cornerstone a new Jewish temple. 
</P>
<P>
Accounts differ over how the clash began. Some reports say police attacked a 
group of chanting demonstrators, another that a tear-gas grenade went off by 
mistake and a third that police intervened to stop stone throwers. 
</P>
<P>
Then, a wave of worshipers from the Al Aqsa mosque drove the police contingent 
out of the compound, freeing rioters to hurl rocks on Jews worshiping at the 
Western Wall below. 
</P>
<P>
A police counterattack drove the mob back toward the gilt-topped Dome of the 
Rock, Islam's third holiest shrine, but the shooting did not stop even after 
the crowd retreated. Several Palestinians were shot and killed near the Dome of 
the Rock, dozens of yards from the corner of the enclave overlooking the 
Western Wall. 
</P>
<P>
Some reports place in question a government contention that the riot was 
planned ahead of time with the aim of harming Jewish worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
Medical reports say that many of the dead and wounded were shot in the back, 
suggesting they were struck while running away. 
</P>
<P>
Since the riot, sporadic unrest has erupted in the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
despite curfews imposed in numerous towns and villages. Soldiers have killed 
five Palestinians and wounded another 28 in violent outbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minster Moshe Arens acknowledged that his policy of trying to reduce 
confrontations is in danger of collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
"Regarding the situation in the field, there is no doubt there is a step back. 
The question is whether it is a relatively small, temporary setback, a matter 
of a week, two weeks or a longer period," Arens said on a Friday television 
broadcast.

CANDIDATES AND CAREERS: IT'S A BALANCING ACT 
</P>

Matt Fong traveled to Asia six times last year on business for his clients. So 
far this year, he has had time for just two trips. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been very difficult, but I am working part-time," said Fong, a Los 
Angeles attorney and Republican candidate for state controller. "As long as you 
have a big mortgage, a small house and a couple of kids in school, you have to 
keep working." 
</P>
<P>
Running a statewide campaign can be a grueling, time-consuming ordeal that 
stretches the limits of any conventional job. 
</P>
<P>
For those who have their own careers outside politics, campaigning also can be 
a tightrope walk. There are briefings, speeches, fund-raisers, press 
conferences, debates, telephone calls and strategy sessions -- sometimes around 
the clock. 
</P>
<P>
"I find myself getting up in the middle of the night writing notes to people 
that I had forgotten to write," said Joan Milke Flores, a Los Angeles 
councilwoman who is the Republican candidate for secretary of state. "I think I 
will sleep a week when this is over." 
</P>
<P>
Fong, meanwhile, has relied on co-workers to carry some of his clients, 
although he takes a briefcase stuffed with paperwork whenever he travels. 
</P>
<P>
For candidates like Flores who also hold public office, the balancing act can 
be even more precarious. Going on the campaign trail often means missing 
official business, and that can be instant fodder for a political rival. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign obligations forced Flores to miss two of six Los Angeles City Council 
meetings last month, and she has been officially excused from four more 
meetings in the coming weeks. In a move that helps him deflect criticism, 
Republican Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes sets aside a half-hour each morning -- 
from 7 to 7:30 -- to discuss daily investments with his staff -- regardless of 
where his campaign has taken him. Hayes' staff also keeps a standard rejection 
letter in the office computer for requests for campaign appearances that 
conflict with his job. 
</P>
<P>
"Any speaking engagements must be set without disrupting his official duties," 
the letter states. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Secretary of State March Fong Eu has managed to weave the demands of 
her campaign into her official responsibilities as the state's chief elections 
officer. Aside from fund-raisers and Democratic Party events, Eu has not 
scheduled a single campaign appearance -- not as risky as it might seem since 
she has been enjoying a strong lead in the polls against Republican Flores. 
</P>
<P>
Eu is on the road as much as any other candidate, nonetheless, promoting voter 
registration at shopping malls, community centers and press conferences -- and 
reminding her audience of her accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
For other statewide candidates, the demands of a "second job" are simply too 
great. They don't even try to hold employment. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein has been without a job 
since retiring as mayor of San Francisco two years ago. Kathleen Brown, 
Democratic candidate for treasurer, quit her post with the city of Los Angeles 
15 months ago to launch her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no way I could do both," Brown said. "I felt that I would best serve 
the citizens by not trying to juggle and do both, because I would have had to 
take time off without pay when I would be involved in campaign activities." 
</P>
<P>
Employed or not, job performance has been a hot topic on the campaign trail. 
Incumbent Hayes has branded Brown a quitter for leaving her city job last year, 
while Brown has accused Hayes of missing an important state budget hearing to 
attend a Republican fund-raiser with President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
In the gubernatorial contest, Feinstein has repeatedly criticized Republican 
Sen. Pete Wilson for failing to return to Washington for Senate votes and has 
called on him to return his salary. Wilson in turn has derisively characterized 
Feinstein as a full-time fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Marian Bergeson, the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, 
has tried to make an issue of incumbent Leo McCarthy's job performance two 
years ago. Bergeson has dubbed McCarthy "a stealth lieutenant governor" because 
of his poor attendance record at various state boards and commissions during 
his unsuccessful Senate bid in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In the race for attorney general, Republican Dan Lungren has gone so far as to 
suggest that San Franciscans demand a tax refund from his Democratic opponent, 
San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody ought to ask if he's going to give money back to the taxpayers of San 
Francisco for the last two years," Lungren told reporters recently. "He's had 
the luxury of being the phantom D.A. in San Francisco for two years. He's never 
been there." 
</P>
<P>
While the job attacks have grabbed headlines, most candidates accused of not 
tending shop because of electioneering usually dismiss the criticism as an 
anachronism of campaigns past. Candidates of the 1990s have cellular telephones 
in their cars, fax machines in their homes and lap-top computers in their 
briefcases to keep up with both work and politics, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of technology, distance is really not that important anymore," said 
Bill Livingstone, Wilson's press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Livingstone made that remark before Wilson missed a decisive vote Friday on a 
Senate amendment requiring parental notification in some abortions. A senator, 
it turns out, is not allowed to vote by phone or fax machine.

BRAZIL'S JUSTICE MINISTER QUITS; AFFAIR WITH OFFICIAL REPORTED

Brazilian Justice Minister Bernardo Cabral resigned Saturday after news reports 
that he was having an adulterous affair with a fellow Cabinet member. 
</P>
<P>
Cabral, 58, in a televised news conference, cited strong personal reasons for 
his resignation without giving details. 
</P>
<P>
Brazilian newspapers recently reported that Cabral, who is married, has been 
having an affair with Economy Minister Zelia Cardoso de Melo, who is single. 
The two ministers neither confirmed nor denied the reports. 
</P>
<P>
President Fernando Collor de Mello accepted Cabral's resignation and appointed 
Sen. Jarbas Passarinho, a leader of the right-wing Democratic Social Party, as 
justice minister. He will take office Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Cabral's resignation follows an article published in the influential Jornal do 
Brasil newspaper last Sunday that said a crisis was imminent because of the 
alleged affair. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the reported affair would result in the resignation of at 
least one of the two ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of the affair erupted after a 37th birthday party for Cardoso was given 
Sept. 19 in Brasilia. The behavior of the two ministers led journalists at the 
party to report that Cabral was Cardoso's mystery lover. 
</P>
<P>
The economy minister told reporters three months ago that she was in love, but 
she would not say with whom. 
</P>
<P>
The press had reported that Collor was unhappy with Cabral's performance as 
justice minister. However, when reports of the affair broke, Collor was 
concerned that a dismissal would be interpreted as being provoked by personal 
rather than professional reasons, press reports said. 
</P>
<P>
The Jornal do Brasil last Sunday said Collor had asked a polling agency to 
survey Brazilians about the alleged affair. A majority surveyed were not aware 
of the affair but, of those who were, most said they did not condemn the 
ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Cabral will return to Congress to complete his term as a representative in the 
Chamber of Deputies. 
</P>
<P>
He is the second minister to resign since Collor took office in March. 
Agriculture Minister Joaquim Roriz resigned shortly after his appointment to 
stand for state office in elections held last week.

Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, key negotiator of German unification, was 
reported in satisfactory condition Saturday after surgeons removed a would-be 
assassin's bullet lodged near his spine. 
</P>
<P>
A 37-year-old man described by police as an emotionally disturbed drug abuser 
was being held in connection with the shooting Friday night at a campaign rally 
in the Black Forest town of Oppenau. 
</P>
<P>
The man, identified by German media as Dieter Kaufmann, "felt the state was 
constantly following him and that Schaeuble therefore was responsible," said 
Horst Knoepfler, a spokesman at the state Interior Ministry in Baden- 
Wuerttemberg. 
</P>
<P>
"The assailant at this point is considered psychiatrically disturbed, and the 
attack had nothing to do with terrorism," Knoepfler said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Raisch, spokesman for the State Criminal Office, confirmed that Kaufmann 
believed he was being persecuted and "was of the opinion that if he killed 
Schaeuble, his torment would end." 
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble, 48, had stopped to sign autographs while leaving the tavern where he 
spoke about German unity when the gunman jumped up from a nearby table, pulled 
out a .38-caliber revolver and fired three or four shots, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A bodyguard was shot in the stomach trying to protect Schaeuble, who was struck 
in the jaw and chest, authorities said. Schaeuble's 19-year-old daughter 
witnessed the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The assailant was immediately overpowered. 
</P>
<P>
Neurosurgeons operated on Schaeuble for five hours Saturday to remove the 
bullet lodged near his spinal column. A statement issued by Schaeuble's 
ministry said he was in "satisfactory and stable" condition. 
</P>
<P>
The bodyguard was expected to be released from the hospital today. 
</P>
<P>
Knoepfler said Kaufmann apparently got the revolver from his father's gun case, 
where it was kept with hunting rifles. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufmann had a history of drug-related offenses, according to police. He 
reportedly served three years in prison for a 1983 drug felony and was also 
arrested for attempting to break into a pharmacy, Knoepfler said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third assassination attempt against a German politician in six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition chancellor candidate Oskar Lafontaine survived being stabbed in the 
throat by a deranged woman at a campaign rally last April. Three months later, 
the leftist guerrilla Red Army Faction planted a car bomb in an unsuccessful 
attempt to kill Schaeuble's top anti-terrorism expert, Hans Neusel, who escaped 
with minor cuts. 
</P>
<P>
A woman who witnessed the attack against Schaeuble told German Radio that he 
was conscious immediately after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Mr. Schaeuble lying on the ground, with a shot here in the back and here 
near the ears," she said. "I told him, 'You must not die.' He raised his head 
to me, looked at me and said he couldn't feel his feet. He had no sensation in 
his feet." 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl flew to Freiburg on Saturday to visit his longtime 
associate at the Albert-Ludwig University Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble, a former speech writer for Kohl, entered Parliament 18 years ago and 
was catapulted into the limelight shortly after being named interior minister 
in April, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
He became the key negotiator of the historic treaty between East and West 
Germany that resulted in their unification Oct. 3.

CURTAIN PARTS ON JAPAN'S UNMENTIONABLE COMMUNITY; 
</P>
<P>
DISCRIMINATION: THE LOW-CASTE GROUP TRIES TO SUPPRESS A CONTROVERIAL BOOK 
POINTING OUT ITS ISOLATION.

<P>
Japan's hereditary outcaste community has lodged a vigorous complaint of 
discrimination against Dutch author Karel van Wolferen, pressuring a Tokyo 
publisher into temporarily halting sales of his controversial book about the 
Japanese power structure shortly after it appeared in translation here. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute appears to underscore one of the major arguments made in Van 
Wolferen's book, "The Enigma of Japanese Power," that free academic and 
political debate is often stifled by social taboos in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the burakumin community, a little-known outcaste group whose 
very existence is unmentionable for many Japanese, contacted the Tokyo 
publisher Hayakawa Shobo on Oct. 1 and demanded that the book be withdrawn from 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Hayakawa officials apologized and immediately advised major bookstores to 
remove the book from their shelves, the publisher's lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a very strong tone of intimidation in the initial complaint by the 
Buraku Liberation League (BLL)," said Futaba Igarashi, the lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Sales did not resume until Van Wolferen intervened Oct. 5 and persuaded the 
publisher to rescind its warning to booksellers. But a major advertising 
campaign is still on hold while Hayakawa negotiates with the league over its 
demands for a number of revisions in the second printing. 
</P>
<P>
"This group is essentially parasitic," Van Wolferen said. "The last thing they 
want is emancipation for the burakumin. They themselves are the ones who keep 
the issues from being discussed." 
</P>
<P>
Kenji Kobayashi, an official with the league, said he objected to the use of 
"discriminatory language" in the translated text, particularly the term 
"special buraku" to describe the state of economic and residential quarantine 
traditionally forced on outcaste communities. 
</P>
<P>
Buraku literally means "hamlet," and the term burakumin ("people of the 
hamlet') is a euphemistic reference to the minority's segregated status. 
Descendants of the outcastes number between one and three million and still 
face widespread discrimination in marriage and employment. 
</P>
<P>
"The phrase 'special buraku' is loaded with a long history of discrimination, 
and its usage perpetuates bad attitudes and misunderstanding," Kobayashi said. 
He did not explain why his organization draws its own name from the term. 
</P>
<P>
"The book makes many valid points and we think it will have a lot of influence 
in Japan," Kobayashi said. "That's why it's important that the section on the 
burakumin be based on the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Kiyoshi Imaoka, an editor at Hayakawa, said the publisher has proposed revising 
the buraku phrase to "special community" in the second printing but leaving 
other disputed sections intact to "serve as a starting point for academic 
debate on the subject." 
</P>
<P>
Hayakawa printed 50,000 two-volume sets in its first edition of the book, 
originally published in English in April of last year. Yoshi Tadokoro, the 
local representative for Van Wolferen's American publisher, Macmillan, 
estimated that about 20,000 sets have been sold since it was released in Japan 
on Sept. 26 but said that it is too early to make an accurate count. Some news 
reports have placed it on bestseller lists for business books, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Wolferen became a controversial figure in Japan after he was branded by the 
media as a so-called "revisionist," one of an influential group of scholars and 
journalists who criticize Japan's trade policies and political institutions. 
</P>
<P>
In his book, he cites the Buraku Liberation League as an example of how 
"intimidation is a preferred alternative to legal sanctions" in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"The denunciation tactics of this group have made it very powerful when it 
confronts publishers, authors, journalists, editors and teachers," he writes. 
"Any of these who says anything about the burakumin minority that contradicts 
BLL ideology runs the risk of being forced to undergo denunciation sessions." 
</P>
<P>
The league's Kobayashi said this allegation is "clearly in error." 
</P>
<P>
"We're only raising our voice on behalf of a minority that's being 
discriminated against by misinformation," he said. "That's not intimidation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The burakumin are indistinguishable by race or religion from other Japanese. 
Like the lower castes of India, they are defined by birth, by poverty and the 
kind of work they do. Their ostracism dates from the 6th Century when Buddhism 
was introduced to Japan from the Asian mainland and certain occupations -- such 
as butcher, tanner and executioner -- were declared "unclean." Those who 
continued to perform those jobs eventually were ostracized and forced to live 
in special buraku, or villages. For those whose heritage can be traced to to a 
buraku, life in Japan even today is often a nightmare of discrimination and 
humiliation. Burakumin especially encounter enormous prejudice if they seek to 
wed a non-burakumin, and suicides are not unknown.

Thousands of protesters hurled firebombs and stones Saturday at riot police who 
blocked a demonstration against government spying on civilians. 
</P>
<P>
The police fired tear gas to drive back 20,000 students and dissidents who 
tried to march downtown after an anti-government rally attended by more than 
100,000 opposition supporters. 
</P>
<P>
The health of opposition leader Kim Dae Jung, meanwhile, deteriorated as his 
hunger strike against the government of President Roh Tae Woo entered its sixth 
day. Aides said he may have to be hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
"Down with Roh Tae Woo!" yelled students hurling rocks and firebombs at police. 
There were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
In southern Seoul, 15,000 students staged anti-government marches. Students 
burned a U.S. flag at a street rally and dispersed peacefully while police 
stayed at a distance, apparently to avert violence. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters were demanding the dissolution of the Defense Security Command 
military intelligence, which has conducted illegal and widespread espionage on 
more than 1,300 civilians. 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent effort to divert attention from the domestic political turmoil, 
Roh on Saturday said he is launching a war on escalating crime and promised to 
take extraordinary measures to crack down on criminals. 
</P>
<P>
At the rally, thousands of people waving white Korean flags jabbed their fists 
in the air while shouting anti-Roh slogans. 
</P>
<P>
There was thunderous applause when about 200 dissidents, wearing numbers to 
designate their alleged file number at military intelligence headquarters, 
marched onto the stage.

LEERY SPAIN VENTURES OUT INTO THE WORLD VIA THE GULF; 
</P>
<P>
ALLIES: THE GOVERNMENT'S UNRESERVED SUPPORT OF U.S.-LED ACTION AGAINST IRAQ 
MARKS A TURNING POINT.

At the peak of the American flood of men and arms into the Persian Gulf, U.S. 
military jets landed at bases in Spain every two or three minutes. Serviced and 
refueled, the planes took off again to neighborhood complaints about noise, 
national ambivalence over their presence, and an unprecedented commitment by 
Spain's Socialist government to their mission. 
</P>
<P>
Strange doings in a country proudly aloof from foreign entanglements for nearly 
all of this century, with a government that sounded not long ago like the most 
anti-American member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But improbable 
things happen when pride changes, a nonplussed and concerned Spanish public is 
discovering. 
</P>
<P>
Unreserved support by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez for the United States in 
enforcing the U.N. embargo against Iraq -- reinforced by his decision to 
contribute to it with Spanish warships -- marks a historic turning in Spain's 
official view of itself and what sort of international shadow it should cast. 
</P>
<P>
"Spain is getting its feet wet in the world," said an admiring Western 
diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
Polls say the Spanish people are still not convinced, but Spain's performance 
so far has earned high marks, prompting a shared pride of achievement among 
normally distant military officers and Socialist politicians. 
</P>
<P>
American supply and staging flights continue routinely, heaviest at the 
once-disputed Torrejon Air Base outside Madrid where all U.S. facilities will 
be turned over to Spain in 1992. Spanish shipyards are maintaining and 
repairing American ships. International blockade enforcers in Persian Gulf 
waters include two Spanish corvettes and a frigate. 
</P>
<P>
"Our newspapers talk about 'hundreds of American flights.' Indeed. And so 
what?" said Inocencio Arias, an undersecretary at the Foreign Ministry. "The 
important part of Spanish public opinion is distrustful of our participation in 
an American military initiative, but in this case we have no argument with the 
United States. Iraq has broken international law in a most brutal and flagrant 
way and shouldn't get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
The United States has decided to abandon its lion's share of the Torrejon base 
after agreeing to demands from the Gonzalez government to remove a wing of 72 
F-16s from Spain by 1992. Many of those fighters are now on alert at a base in 
Turkey, and in the present climate of Spanish-American gulf cooperation, 
discord over their departure seems as much ancient history as Gonzalez's 
refusal to allow overflight by American bombers on their way to a raid against 
Libya in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a positive experience for Spain. We have been an inward-looking 
country with its back to Europe for decades. With the return of democracy in 
1975, we began looking outward again. Now, we are participating in this crisis 
as a full partner of a modern and democratic Europe," said Miguel Gil, a 
spokesman for the prime minister's office. 
</P>
<P>
Spain's international projection in the gulf flies in the face of what one 
scholar has called a "culture of isolation" that began with the revolt of 
American colonies in the early 19th Century and accelerated with the loss of 
the Philippines, Puerto Rico and Cuba in war with the United States in 1898. 
</P>
<P>
Spain sat out both world wars as a weak, irrelevant, self-consumed neutral. 
After a sapping civil war, the 1939-75 dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco 
cut off Spain not only from democracy but also as a principal beneficiary of 
the unprecedented prosperity that has accompanied it in the rest of Western 
Europe since 1945. 
</P>
<P>
Under Gonzalez, Spain has moved step by step toward the mainstream. In the 
watershed year of 1986, it joined the European Community and NATO after 
prolonged national debate. By now, Spain is among the community's loudest 
supporters of European integration. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Gonzalez seemed to underestimate the consequences of Iraq's Aug. 2 
invasion of Kuwait, but within a few days his government had authorized 
open-door use of bases in Spain for American ships and planes. He dispatched 
warships Aug. 26 in response to a call for action by the Western European 
Union, a regional defense alliance that Spain joined only last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not opt for isolation. Spain has learned over the past 150 years that 
it's cold being on the outside," the Spanish prime minister asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez did not take his case directly to the leery Spanish people until 40 
days after the invasion, though, when conservatives joined Socialists in a 
ringing parliamentary endorsement that failed to still popular qualms. 
</P>
<P>
Old ways die hard. Parliamentary support "contrasts with the divided opinions 
and, above all, the bewilderment of many citizens in the face of events in the 
gulf," said the Madrid newspaper El Pais. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset, it has been painfully apparent to the government that a 
majority of Spaniards want no part of any overseas military action. There have 
been none since some disastrous sorties in Morocco between 1909 and 1927. 
</P>
<P>
As Spain ventured into the gulf, one private radio station said that 
three-quarters of nearly 8,000 people it polled by telephone opposed 
participation there. About 300 intellectuals signed a declaration by Communist 
and other leftist parties supporting the intervention but opposing any Spanish 
military role. 
</P>
<P>
In a September survey of 800 Spaniards of voting age, El Pais found that 54% 
opposed direct involvement, 64% said they felt badly informed by their 
government and, most tellingly, only 32% thought that Spain's contribution in 
confronting Iraq should be at the same level as that of its European Community 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that 150 of the 500 crew members aboard the Spanish vessels sent to 
the gulf are 20-year-old conscripts has roused ire across the country. Stung, 
the government promises that as a reward for gulf service, the draftees will be 
discharged early when the original three warships are replaced by sister ships 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
"Spaniards were delighted at a new stage of history when their country was 
integrated with Europe and among the richest and most modern countries in the 
world. They didn't know that the price can be very high," said Cambio 16, a 
news magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Initial consternation has been replaced by microscopic examination by the news 
media of every Spanish step abroad, often accompanied by commentaries and dire 
editorial warnings. When Prince Felipe, the gangling, 22-year-old heir to the 
Spanish throne, sallied forth in his navy lieutenant's uniform for a weekend 
visit to the ships in the gulf, newspapers complained how badly organized his 
mission had been. They noted that one weapons system aboard the corvettes was 
not working properly and that technicians dispatched to repair it were turned 
away because they lacked visas for the countries of the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
All Spain knows that two sailors were scalded by hot soup and that a navy 
lieutenant broke his arm boarding a ship to be inspected. On blockade patrol, 
when the commander of a nearby U.S. warship suggested that a Spanish ship fire 
a warning shot across the bow of a suspect merchant vessel, the Spanish captain 
first had to call Madrid for permission. Tapes of his call quickly found their 
way onto Spanish radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
As Spain regards the unfolding of its new persona with what amounts to 
delicious apprehension, it is clear that Gonzalez's political future, like 
those of President Bush, Britain's Margaret Thatcher and France's Francois 
Mitterrand, can be strongly influenced by unfolding events abroad. In a Spain 
belatedly and anxiously emerging from isolation, that may be the biggest news 
of all.

Kuwait's exiled rulers promised to restore a democratic parliament if their 
emirate is freed from Iraqi occupation. At a meeting of more than 1,000 Kuwaiti 
exiles in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, the Kuwaiti crown prince and prime minster, 
Sheik Saad al Abdullah al Sabah, said the reforms are a reward for Kuwaitis' 
loyalty in the wake of Iraq's invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Embargo Front: 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Iraqi children carrying empty milk bottles marched past the U.S. 
and British embassies in Baghdad to protest the U.N. trade blockade imposed on 
their country Aug. 6. The march emphasized Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's 
contention that the blockade would be responsible for starving innocent 
children.

Egyptian police arrested several suspects in Friday's ambush murder of Speaker 
of Parliament Refaat Mahgoub. Egypt's national news agency said the suspects

Some sources said the attack may be linked to Egypt's stand against Iraq's

STORM LOSES HURRICANE STATUS; MORE FLOODING IN EAST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tropical Storm Lili veered away from the mid-Atlantic coast Saturday, its 
hurricane status a memory, but the remnants of two other storms created 
floodwaters from the Carolinas to Pennsylvania before disintegrating. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service reported that Lili, which had once carried 92 
m.p.h. wind gusts, dropped to tropical storm status Saturday as it began 
turning toward the north. 
</P>
<P>
A tropical storm warning remained in effect for the extreme southern coast of 
Virginia, with a tropical storm watch over the remainder of the Virginia coast. 
A tropical storm watch, with a coastal flood watch and heavy surf advisory, 
also was posted for the Delaware and Maryland coasts. 
</P>
<P>
As of Saturday afternoon, the storm was about 175 miles east of Cape Hatteras, 
N. C., and was moving north at about 14 m.p.h. Its peak winds of 65 m.p.h. 
extended up to 115 miles eastward, but it was expected to turn northeast and 
pick up speed as peak winds diminished. 
</P>
<P>
Weather officials said small craft from Hatteras to Eastport, Me., should 
remain in port. 
</P>
<P>
The strong winds combined with glass-smooth waters to produce ideal conditions 
for windsurfers who flocked to Pamlico Sound, which lies between North 
Carolina's Outer Banks and the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
Rain from two tropical storms that weakened and fell apart after hitting land 
caused some problems Saturday along the East Coast, where nine people were 
killed earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
A major flood was working its way down the Ogeechee River in east-central 
Georgia, the weather service reported. The level of the upper Ogeechee River 
was six feet above flood stage, the highest level since the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains caused flooding over portions of northwest Virginia, western 
Maryland and eastern West Virginia. Many rivers and streams were overflowing 
their banks, and numerous roads were closed. 
</P>
<P>
A small-stream flood watch remained over northeast Pennsylvania, and flood 
watches also were posted over portions of New York state and northern Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
The remains of Tropical Storm Marco -- which earlier absorbed remnants of 
Tropical Storm Klaus -- were moving northward through the Carolinas, but the 
weather service said it had broken into a multitude of minor storms and was no 
longer trackable. 
</P>
<P>
In the Carolinas, six deaths were attributed to the storms. Two were traffic 
fatalities and four were the result of a collapsed dam, officials said. Georgia 
authorities reported three deaths from flooding near Augusta. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere Saturday, it was windy in the West with winds gusting to 57 m.p.h. 
near Pocatello, Ida., and 58 m.p.h. at Laramie, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
Snow fell in the Big Horn Mountains of Wyoming, and the town of Spruce Lodge 
reported two inches of new snow. 
</P>
<P>
It was 84 degrees in Cape Hatteras, breaking the record high of 83 degrees set 
in 1986. It was the seventh record high tied or broken during the past week.

LEAD IN WATER OF EAST COAST SCHOOLS CITED 
</P>

<P>
Despite a 1988 federal law, toxic lead can still be found in many school 
drinking fountains in the Mid-Atlantic region, a report said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent report, the Inspector General's Office of the Environmental 
Protection Agency found that the EPA, states and local school districts are 
doing a poor job of implementing the laws, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Our findings confirm that harmful amounts of lead exist in drinking water 
provided by schools," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The study covers schools in the EPA's Region 3, which includes Pennsylvania, 
Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a law passed in 1988 to protect kids in school from lead, and the EPA 
and the states have dropped the ball," said Erik Olsen, a lawyer with the 
National Wildlife Federation. 
</P>
<P>
Exposure to the heavy metal can impair a child's neurological development and 
learning ability. Contamination has been a problem in some older models of 
water coolers that have lead-lined tanks, and the EPA has estimated that as 
many as 250,000 children nationwide may be drinking contaminated water. 
</P>
<P>
The report said one unidentified Maryland school district found elevated levels 
of lead in 32% of its water coolers, with some found to have lead levels five 
times higher than the EPA standard. 
</P>
<P>
An EPA spokesman said the agency has been constrained in enforcing the Lead 
Contamination Control Act by a lack of resources and the way the law was 
written. 
</P>
<P>
The law sets no penalties that could be levied to require compliance, and 
Congress has not allocated money to enforce it.

DEDICATION HELD FOR MONUMENT TO FIREFIGHTERS

A national monument etched with the names of 1,238 firefighters who have died 
in the line of duty since 1981 was dedicated Saturday at a ceremony that 
recounted the tales of fallen heroes. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush signed legislation in August designating the 9-year-old monument 
at the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg as the official national memorial to 
career and volunteer firefighters who died on the job. 
</P>
<P>
"While many local communities and states honor their fallen heroes, this 
memorial stands as a lasting national tribute to those who have answered their 
last alarm," said Olin L. Greene, administrator of the U.S. Fire 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 people, including state, local and national officials and 
firefighters from across the country, attended the ceremony held at the 
seven-foot-tall, pyramid-shaped limestone monument. 
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, many people have bemoaned our country's lack of national 
heroes," said Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), who shepherded legislation through 
Congress to get the memorial dedicated. "What they fail to realize is that we 
do have heroes in every fire hall across this land."

SPACE SHUTTLE READIED FOR MORE FUELING TESTS

Columbia, the shuttle plagued with mechanical problems since April, was pulled 
from its hangar again Saturday night for a trip to the launch pad. 
</P>
<P>
In late October, Columbia will undergo the first of what may be several fueling 
tests. If the shuttle passes, its mission to deploy the $150-million Astro 
observatory could get under way in December. 
</P>
<P>
The move was Columbia's sixth since April 22, when it was first rolled out for 
a scheduled May 30 mission. Hydrogen leaks scrubbed that launch, and the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration did not get a shuttle in orbit 
until Discovery took off Oct. 6 with the Ulysses solar probe.

JAIL INMATE DIED DUE TO ASPHYXIATION BY HANGING, AUTOPSY REPORTS INDICATE

<P>
A 46-year-old inmate awaiting trial on charges of killing two emergency room 
workers during a hospital shooting rampage died due to asphyxiation by hanging, 
according to autopsy results released Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Powers Jr. died at UC San Diego Medical Center about 9:15 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Coroner George Dickason said Saturday the coroner's office likely would 
pronounce the death a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's homicide detectives will investigate the death because Powers was in 
custody when he died, and all jail-related deaths are investigated. 
</P>
<P>
Powers was found hanging from a makeshift noose attached to the bars in his 
jail cell Oct. 5. He was jailed in lieu of $2.5 million bail and was awaiting 
trial for an April 14 shooting rampage at Mission Bay Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to resuscitate Powers were unsuccessful and he died in the UCSD Medical 
Center intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said he suffered irreversible brain damage due to oxygen loss. 
</P>
<P>
"The physician met with the family on numerous occasions, and it was a joint 
decision with the family that there would be no heroics to keep him alive," 
said hospital spokeswoman Eileen Callahan. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney has closed the case in the April 14 slayings of Debbie 
Burke, an emergency room nurse, and Edward Rooney, an emergency medical 
technician observer spending his first day at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
A bystander and a doctor were wounded and a nurse narrowly averted being hit 
when she ducked behind a desk as Powers allegedly sprayed the area with 
gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Powers apparently was distraught over his father's death 
earlier that day. Bradford Powers Sr., 75, died at Mission Bay Hospital while 
undergoing surgery for an aneurysm.

<TEXT>
<P>
Retired Marine Maj. Gen. Walter Greatsinger Farrell, a pioneer naval aviator 
who served in World Wars I and II, has died. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell died Thursday at San Diego Naval Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
He was the oldest living naval aviator in the world and held two of the very 
few licenses signed by Orville Wright, according to his son, Patrick, of 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Born in San Francisco on Oct. 4, 1897, the son of Gen. and Mrs. P.J.H. Farrell, 
he joined the Army in 1916, but soon switched to the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know anything about the Marines except they had a red stripe on their 
pants and they wore a funny kind of hat," he recalled in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The young Marine lieutenant served in France during World War I, leading 
replacement companies through combat training. 
</P>
<P>
In 1921, he won his wings as a Navy pilot. Between the world wars, he served in 
Haiti and Nicaragua, and briefly as assistant naval attache at the American 
Embassy in London. 
</P>
<P>
After reorganizing and training a wing group in San Diego at the outset of 
World War II, Farrell went to Guadalcanal and the Russell Islands, earning a 
Silver Star for "exceptional heroism" in action against the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Promoted to brigadier general, he commanded the 3rd Marine Air Wing, and later 
served in China. 
</P>
<P>
Early in 1945, Farrell reported for duty at El Toro Marine Air Station in 
Orange County as deputy commander of the 11th Naval District Air Bases. 
</P>
<P>
He retired in 1946 as a major general, after 30 years of service. At that time, 
he was commanding all Marine Corps air bases on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his son Patrick, Farrell is survived by another son, Thomas, of 
Charlottesville, Va.; a daughter, Mary (Micki) of San Diego; a stepson, 
Frederick Trapnell, of Los Altos, eight grandchildren and five great 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Services are scheduled Wednesday at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San 
Diego.

Le Duc Tho, a hard-line Communist revolutionary named as a winner of the 1973 
Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating a settlement in the Vietnam War, died 
Saturday in Hanoi. Official accounts say he was 79. 
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry in the Vietnamese capital said by telephone that Tho died 
early in the day but gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's Kyodo news agency, reporting from Hanoi, said Tho died of throat 
cancer. He had been hospitalized at an army hospital since returning in April 
from treatment in Paris, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Tho shared the Nobel prize with then-Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. 
They negotiated the Paris Peace Accords of 1973. But Tho turned down the prize, 
saying Vietnam remained at war. 
</P>
<P>
The guns fell silent two years later, when Communist forces defeated the 
U.S.-backed Saigon government and unified the country. 
</P>
<P>
Tho, one of the organizers and theoreticians of revolution in Vietnam, remained 
in the ruling Politburo after 1975. He was believed to have played a key role 
in Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in late 1978. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1986, he was removed from the Politburo as aging veterans gave way to 
more liberal leaders seeking economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats have speculated that in recent years, Tho's power had ebbed 
but that he remained an important figure in the party's conservative ranks. His 
official position was adviser to the party's Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Until the end, Tho kept parts of his life from the public domain as did many 
revolutionary leaders of his generation. There are several different versions 
of his birth date and accounts of his early life. 
</P>
<P>
By some accounts, he was born of poor parents in a village about 60 miles south 
of Hanoi. But some Western biographical sources say his father was a civil 
service official of middle rank in the French colonial administration. 
</P>
<P>
His activities during World War II are still a matter of speculation among 
Western historians. Some sources say Tho escaped to China and helped Vietnam's 
founding father, Ho Chi Minh, form the Viet Minh guerrillas and led them 
against the Japanese. Others say Tho spent some of the war years in a French 
prison in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
During the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s, Tho apparently did not have a 
direct say in military matters.

ELECTIONS / 38TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
ABORTION IS HOTTEST ISSUE IN A BATTLE OF PARTY REGULARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For more than 25 years, real estate broker Paula Boland of Northridge has been 
a grunt for the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
When Barry Goldwater ran for President in 1964, she stuffed envelopes for his 
campaign. When Bobbi Fiedler ran for Congress in 1980, she staffed phone banks 
and walked precincts on election day. 
</P>
<P>
As GOP candidates for offices from city council to President made speeches and 
basked in applause, Boland worked in the trenches for them, making coffee, 
running errands and planting campaign signs in neighbors' lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Now the conservative Boland, 50, wants to take a quantum leap in party ranks. 
She is running for the 38th Assembly District seat held by Assemblywoman Marian 
La Follette (R-Northridge), who is retiring. 
</P>
<P>
Boland's Democratic opponent in the Nov. 6 election is Irene Allert, an 
educational consultant from Kagel Canyon who is an executive committee member 
of the Democratic Party of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But political observers say Allert, 46, is a long shot in the upscale, 
conservative district, which arcs across the San Fernando Valley from Hidden 
Hills to La Crescenta. With Republicans holding a 48% to 42% registration edge 
over Democrats, the seat is considered a safe one for the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
The district has been held for 10 years by La Follette, a conservative who 
dispatched her most recent Democratic opponent, Mark Lit, by nearly 65% to 35% 
in 1988. Boland also holds a large lead over Allert in fund raising, taking in 
$102,000 to Allert's $43,000 in the reporting period that ended Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Boland and Allert have sharply differing positions on several major issues, but 
the one that has generated the most heat so far is abortion. Boland opposes 
abortion rights and Allert supports them. 
</P>
<P>
The race marks the first time that two women Assembly candidates with opposing 
views on abortion rights have faced off in a general election since last year's 
U.S. Supreme Court decision in Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services. The 
ruling gave states more latitude to restrict abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Allert has received thousands of dollars in contributions from the National 
Women's Political Caucus, the California Nurses Assn. and other groups favoring 
abortion rights. Boland has received money from the National Right to Life 
Committee and is backed by James C. Dobson of Arcadia, host of the daily "Focus 
on the Family" radio shows and a leading spokesman for the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of legislative races, this is the hottest one between two women," 
said Robin Schneider, executive director of the California Abortion Rights 
Action League, which backs Allert. 
</P>
<P>
Boland's campaign also is being closely watched by Assembly Republican Leader 
Ross Johnson of Fullerton, who sponsored a Sacramento fund-raiser for Boland in 
August and attended another in Granada Hills last week. Her election would help 
Johnson, a fellow conservative, cement his hold on the leadership job, which 
comes up for a vote immediately after the November election. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter of a barber and a beautician who emigrated from Italy, Boland is a 
diminutive, strong-willed woman who has been heavily involved in local civic 
and small-business activities for years. 
</P>
<P>
A onetime model at local dress shops and charity shows, Boland ran the Miss 
Granada Hills beauty pageant for 13 years. She has served on a review board 
that interviewed potential recruits for the Los Angeles Police Department and 
is a board member of a Granada Hills bank. 
</P>
<P>
Boland was active in Bus Stop, a group which opposed mandatory school busing in 
the 1970s, and has been closely involved with efforts to make the Valley a 
separate city from Los Angeles. She was appointed by Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich as a member of the county Local Agency Formation 
Commission, an influential agency that oversees city incorporations and 
annexations. 
</P>
<P>
Her campaign is supported by some of the Valley's best known GOP conservatives. 
Former Rep. Fiedler, a close friend, has raised money for her, and wealthy car 
dealer Bert Boeckmann shares the chairmanship of Boland's campaign with his 
wife, Jane, publisher of Valley magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Allert, who describes herself as a social liberal and fiscal conservative, is a 
carpenter's daughter who attended the now-defunct Immaculate Heart College in 
Los Angeles before becoming a junior high school teacher. She operates a firm 
that refers science and health teachers and supplies educational materials to 
public and private schools. 
</P>
<P>
Among the groups endorsing her are the National Organization for Women and the 
California AFL-CIO. The bulk of her campaign contributions have come from labor 
unions, groups favoring abortion rights and local Democratic clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Allert's campaign consultant, Parke Skelton, said that to beat Boland, Allert 
must win at least 10,000 crossover votes from Republicans. The campaign is 
telephoning every Republican in the district to identify potential crossover 
voters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Allert said she expects to raise $150,000 before the election. But a Democratic 
political consultant, who asked not to be identified, said she needs "a minimum 
of $250,000 to get close" to winning. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the fall campaign, Boland -- who has a tendency to ramble and 
mangle her syntax when she speaks publicly -- practiced making speeches before 
a video camera. 
</P>
<P>
But some critics say Boland, whose formal education ended in high school, 
doesn't have the intellectual capacity to be an effective assemblywoman. 
</P>
<P>
"When people sit down and talk to her, they realize she's no brain surgeon," 
said a Republican political consultant who believes she will win nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
"She's never going to be a leader in the state Assembly. She's never going to 
come up with creative, innovative solutions to the problems facing California . 
. . She'll be good at handing out plaques and resolutions and attending chamber 
of commerce events," said the consultant, who asked to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
Boland supporters disagree. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider myself a bright person, but she catches me screwing up all the 
time. And I've got a master's and have been to law school," said Boland 
campaign manager Mark Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
"When she's a little angry or excited, the Italian comes out in her and she 
speaks from inside, from the gut. At that point, you don't care whether her 
language shows she's a college graduate or not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a tough woman. People get the impression she's a bubble-head, but they 
better beware, because she's a pillar of strength," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Allert has been endorsed by two local assemblymen, Tom Bane and 
Richard Katz, her campaign has not drawn any visible support from Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) or other Assembly Democrats, who could 
steer contributions and volunteers her way. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic consultant said Allert has committed two cardinal campaign 
errors: She is spending too much time attending Democratic Party events and 
seeking endorsements from political clubs outside the district, and not enough 
time going door-to-door in search of votes. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't have money, you have to do it the old-fashioned way: shoe 
leather," the consultant said. 
</P>
<P>
But an Allert campaign official said she is "walking her feet off" and Allert 
said she believes she can win the race. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew in the beginning that we were underdogs. But what we really knew was 
that the issues were on our side. . . . The issues, I know, are going to carry 
us in this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Boland has repeatedly sought to play down her position on abortion rights, 
saying it is not an issue in the campaign. She denounced a small band of 
supporters of legal abortion who picketed a fund-raising luncheon for her last 
week as "those airheads down there." 
</P>
<P>
Boland accused Allert of being a "one-issue candidate" and said members of the 
Assembly cannot directly change state and federal laws governing abortion, 
although they could place an initiative on the ballot for a public vote. 
</P>
<P>
But Allert and her supporters said the Assembly is nearly evenly divided 
between those favoring and those opposing abortion rights, and her election 
could be a crucial vote for abortion advocates. 
</P>
<P>
They said more legislators favoring abortion rights are needed to tip the 
balance in Sacramento on abortion-related issues, such as higher funding for 
family-planning clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Boland promised that if elected she will resume La Follette's fight to break up 
the Los Angeles school district into smaller agencies. She attacked Allert for 
"being in bed with" the school board and teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
Allert, who is backed by school board member Julie Korenstein, said she hasn't 
made up her mind on the breakup idea pending completion of a $250,000 study 
conducted by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Allert criticized Boland for not taking a position on the massive Porter Ranch 
development in the hills north of Chatsworth. Allert said the project should be 
dramatically scaled down to avoid traffic, pollution and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
Boland, who is supported by Porter Ranch lobbyist Robert Wilkinson and Los 
Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson, the project's chief City Hall proponent, 
said the matter is one for local, not state, officials to decide. But Allert 
said state authorities can exercise substantial decision-making over the 
project, including deciding whether to expand the nearby Simi Valley Freeway.

OXNARD MAY CHANGE SITE OF FESTIVAL 
</P>

<P>
Relocation of the California Strawberry Festival to a larger site will be 
discussed Tuesday at the Oxnard City Council meeting. Festival organizers hope 
to have the May event moved to College Park, a meadow next to Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
The fair has been held at Channel Islands Harbor since its beginning seven 
years ago. More than 70,000 people swarmed through the harbor's seven-acre 
fairgrounds last May, said Dr. Tsujio Kato, co-chairman of the 1990 event. 
</P>
<P>
This year's fair would spread to 14 acres at College Park to accommodate 
shorter lines, a larger arts-and-crafts area and more entertainers, Kato said. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers say another advantage to College Park is its on-site parking and 
easy freeway access. 
</P>
<P>
The fair, which has generated about $500,000 for local nonprofit groups since 
it began, will be held May 18 and 19. KIM KASH

FOOTBALL RECRUITING ACADEMIC AT VIRGINIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE BRENNAN, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Trevor Ryals, an outstanding center on Cincinnati's legendary Moeller High 
School football team, was considering colleges in 1986, he ended up settling on 
the University of Virginia for the most unusual reason. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to go someplace where, if football didn't work out, if I had an 
accident or blew out my knee, I'd have academics to fall back on," Ryals said. 
</P>
<P>
Ryals was the kind of football player Virginia almost always attracted: the one 
who picked the school not because of the football team, but because of 
everything else, the way most students pick a college. 
</P>
<P>
This is not so unusual at strong academic institutions in prestigious 
conferences, schools such as Virginia, Stanford, Northwestern and Vanderbilt. 
But what is so unusual about what's happening at Virginia this year is that 
this collection of students who play football happens to be undefeated and 
ranked second in the nation in the Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
How they came to be so good is a mystery in the outside world and even a bit of 
a well-kept secret here. George Welsh, the taciturn coach who has lifted the 
Cavaliers from 1-10 to one and only (almost), shrugs when he begins to talk 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
Without lowering the academic standards of the team, without changing the 
schedule, without turning to flowery recruiting language, Welsh has molded a 
contender by keeping much of the in-state talent in the state and his coaching 
staff largely intact for nine seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven members of his 1986 recruiting class have blossomed into fifth-year 
starters. Players who hardly were blue-chippers in high school have turned into 
future all-Americans. And through it all, he has wondered if what he has worked 
so hard to achieve is what he and the school really want. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to be in the same league every year that Southern Cal and 
those guys are," he said. "And you probably don't want it here. You don't want 
to read about being a football factory. It would be a negative-type thing. The 
university's not geared that way. ... If there's a lot of enthusiasm and we're 
selling the stadium out all the time -- that's all good. But if (the team) 
starts counting victories or thinking, 'Wow, we could be undefeated,' and 
forgetting what you have to do to do it, then it's detrimental." 
</P>
<P>
One of the first questions put to a prestigious school when it finds the Midas 
touch on the football field is about academics: Might not the school be 
lowering its standards to win games? 
</P>
<P>
Welsh bristles at the suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia's academic standard "hasn't changed since I've been here," he said. 
"We have people turned down who have gone on to other conference schools and 
have gone on to other schools out of the conference that we couldn't get 
academically. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why people are saying that now. If we were 2-3 now, instead of 
5-0, you probably wouldn't hear about it. When you get to the bottom line, you 
have to look at the graduation rate. We still are in the top five or 10 of the 
country. We and Duke have always led the conference." 
</P>
<P>
Alan Williams, Virginia's faculty athletics representative, said there has been 
"no change" in the football team's SAT scores or its graduation rate in the 
past 15 years. The average SAT scores of the football team range from 910 to 
1020, Williams said, while the average for all entering students at the school 
ranges from 1200 to 1220. 
</P>
<P>
The graduation rate for football players who entered in 1984 was 95.6 percent 
(22 of 23), Williams said, and it usually runs 83 percent to 89 percent. The 
overall school graduation rate was 89 percent, he said. Only Duke (96 percent, 
24 of 25) had a higher football graduation rate among all CFA schools, Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The school also does not allow Proposition 48 students now, although it did 
admit two in 1985. One flunked out, the other stayed in school. 
</P>
<P>
"If academics were being overlooked, you know the university wouldn't stand for 
it," said defensive lineman Joe Hall, a fifth-year graduate student, one of 
nine graduate students on the team. "We are under a microscope with the 
university." 
</P>
<P>
It is this academic orientation that rules the thoughts of many football 
players. Hall, a Washington Post All-Met selection who could have gone to 
Michigan, UCLA or Tennessee, said bluntly that he came to Virginia for its 
academics and social life -- and the possibility of going to a bowl game 
sometime during his years here. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't coming here to try to win a national championship," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did Welsh come to Virginia from Navy for that reason. 
</P>
<P>
"If I felt like I had to go somewhere to be a national-championship contender 
or top 10 football team, I certainly wouldn't have come here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he was looking for measurable amounts of success. Taking over a 1-10 team 
from Dick Bestwick, he imagined he could "wave a magic wand and get players to 
compete and win. 
</P>
<P>
"But we didn't. That took us a year. They just didn't know how to win, how to 
pay the price, how to be in position to win." 
</P>
<P>
In one of his first scrimmages, Welsh counted the number of players who could 
not practice. He reached 33. None was a freshman he and his staff had 
recruited; they all were upperclassmen who were not used to practicing in pain. 
</P>
<P>
Recruiting was equally challenging in those early years. 
</P>
<P>
"I underestimated the problem after being at Navy and having three bowl teams," 
Welsh said. "Once we came here, (a recruit) would say, 'Well, it's Virginia,' 
and they didn't even visit." 
</P>
<P>
After going 2-9 in 1982, Welsh turned things around and went 6-5 in 1983 and 
8-2-2 in 1984, including a victory over Purdue in the Peach Bowl. That bowl 
trip, the first in the school's history, became the cornerstone of Welsh's 
recruiting strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"That helped us a lot to dispel the losing image and get better players, 
especially locally, in the D.C. area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
By now, his team was stocked with several future NFL stars, including offensive 
tackle Jim Dombrowski, linebacker Jeff Lageman, strong safety Lester Lyles and 
quarterback Don Majkowski. In 1985, the Cavaliers dropped back to 6-5, and fell 
even further in 1986, to 3-8. But athletes still came, including quarterback 
Shawn Moore as part of the exceptional class of 1986, and wide receiver Herman 
Moore in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Herman Moore, not particularly highly recruited out of George Washington High 
in Danville, Va., was told by rival schools not to come to Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
"You have guys there who expect to lose," Moore said rival coaches told him. 
"Virginia's definitely not going to win anything. Look at their record; they're 
on the downswing." 
</P>
<P>
Moore visited Virginia anyway, liked the place, and signed up. 
</P>
<P>
"Virginia never said anything bad about any of the others," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Welsh soon was signing Terry Kirby, a Tabb, Va., running back considered the 
best high-school player in the nation in 1988. Defensive end Chris Slade, 
Kirby's high-school teammate and a prep all-America, came along as well. 
</P>
<P>
Good things just kept happening. In 1987, there was the All American Bowl and 
an 8-4 record; in 1988, no bowl, but 7-4; in 1989, the Florida Citrus Bowl and 
a 10-3 mark. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, kids want to come to Virginia," said Hall. "You don't have to talk them 
into coming. For a long time, we had to chase after people. We can choose 
people now."

BRYAN TROTTIER IS WARMING TO PITTSBURGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It can't be easy picking up and moving after 15 years, no matter what Bryan 
Trottier says. He earned four championship rings with the New York Islanders, 
married a Long Island woman, had three children. But to listen to him, leaving 
the Islanders and joining the Pittsburgh Penguins had all the raw emotion of 
checking out of a hotel. "That's the business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Trottier has always been like that, shrugging his shoulders and looking forward 
to the next day, ever since he arrived as a peach-fuzzed rookie from Val Marie, 
Saskatchewan, just off the farm. That was in 1975, when the Islanders were 
climbing the ladder and Trottier was there standing below, giving them a shove. 
Even then, everyone had an idea of what was ahead. 
</P>
<P>
That first year, the Islanders were leaving Toronto, rumpled and bleary-eyed as 
they boarded the team bus at dawn after a big win the night before. One by one, 
the players collapsed in their seats, but there was no Trottier. Coach Al 
Arbour kept glancing at his watch and tapping his shoe, and still there was no 
Trottier. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Arbour ordered the driver to head for the airport. And as the bus 
dodged into traffic, left wing Garry Howatt chirped from the back seat, "Oops. 
There goes the Stanley Cup." 
</P>
<P>
Trottier, naturally, caught up at the airport ticket counter and the dynasty 
was saved. But now it's 1990, Trottier is 34 and a brand-new member of the 
Penguins, one opponent the Islanders love to hate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny," Trottier said. "I used to laugh at the Pittsburgh uniforms, the 
way they looked and all. I thought they were ugly. Black and gold. Penguin on 
the front. And then the first day I put it on, that all changed. I thought it 
looked great." 
</P>
<P>
He is sitting in a booth at a restaurant called Piacquadio's, a hangout for the 
Penguins on the outskirts of the city, beyond the dreary skyline. A few of his 
new teammates stop by the table, and the owner stops by, and pretty soon 
Trottier -- polite to a fault -- is shaking hands all around. 
</P>
<P>
You shake hands with Trottier and get your knuckles squeezed in that vise, and 
you understand why the Penguins thought he still had some mileage left. He did 
score two goals Sunday night as the Penguins beat the Devils, and with Mario 
Lemieux out indefinitely with a back injury, Pittsburgh will need more than 
just his veteran leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Trottier scored 500 goals for the Islanders. He recorded 853 assists. He was a 
fierce and relentless checker; he once slammed New York Rangers' defenseman 
Barry Beck, a player much bigger than him, into the boards with such force a 
reporter in the press box at Madison Square Garden gasped, "I think the 
building just moved two feet." 
</P>
<P>
But Saturday night, when the Islanders celebrate their home opener, Trottier 
will be centering for the other side, for the Penguins. Talk to Trottier and 
he'll tell you how the Penguin players are so much fun, how he loves the city, 
how he's never seen so much young talent in one place. Give him the chance and 
he'll praise everyone right down to the stick boy. 
</P>
<P>
He will tell you how the Islanders' decision to buy out the remaining two years 
of his contract on July 3 may work out for the best after all, that he feels 
like a kid again. But ask him about this one game and Trottier's guard drops, 
like a boot hitting the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I find myself daydreaming about it," he said. "I think about stepping on the 
ice, what the reaction of the fans is going to be, what I'll be thinking during 
the the national anthem -- all that. Honestly, I don't feel nervous or 
uncomfortable about it. I just want to get it over with." 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he keeps having this dream that he walks into the wrong dressing 
room," Trottier's wife, Nickie, said. "You know, he walks into the Islanders' 
room by mistake. Then he said, 'Knowing the guys, they wouldn't say anything.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
This is not the way Trottier planned it, naturally: Nickie and the children 
staying home in Manhasset, N.Y., while he plays out the string in Pittsburgh. 
He expected to retire as an Islander. Nickie used to tease him that if he ever 
needed a transfusion, they'd have to find orange-and-blue blood. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to suggest that Trottier was an angel. He could be stubborn. He 
exasperated management more than once in his appeals for more ice time. But as 
long as Trottier was around, no one was allowed to criticize the other players. 
If you took on any one of the Islanders, you took on Trottier. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the team instigated a brawl with the Rangers in last season's playoff 
series, Trottier firmly defended the club's actions. "I backed the team up. I 
said how we didn't mean to start anything, that it just sort of happened." 
</P>
<P>
"Inside, I was thinking, 'Bryan, you lyin' bastard.' " 
</P>
<P>
He will go to his grave saying he wasn't hurt by the Islanders' decision to let 
him go -- business, and all that -- but the fact is that Trottier spent 15 
years with the club, became a hero and enjoyed immense popularity. All Trottier 
will say is that he didn't understand it. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, I got a shift here, a shift there," he said. "I was sitting 
on the bench and I felt like I wasn't contributing a hell of a lot, and it was 
tormenting me. I think, in hindsight, I'd have been better off saying, 'Trade 
me, trade me.' But I just couldn't do that." 
</P>
<P>
It got worse. His relationship with Arbour and General Manager Bill Torrey 
quickly deterioriated. In 1980, Arbour and Trottier had sipped champagne from 
the Stanley Cup together, tears running down their cheeks. But last season, 
Trottier was benched in the final playoff game, a signal the era had ended. 
</P>
<P>
Three months later, Torrey would call his decision to release Trottier 
"painful," and, whether or not the announcement was handled with care and 
grace, this much is certain: Torrey had to choke back tears. When the Islanders 
and Penguins played a preseason game in Oakland earlier this month, Trottier 
and Torrey spoke briefly, but it wasn't the same anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happened doesn't change my feeling about Bill and Al as the people I've 
come to know," Trottier said. "But I've seen a side of them I don't 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the break with the past might have been cleaner and easier if a proposed 
rink Trottier planned to build in partnership with Nassau County hadn't become 
the target of political infighting. Democrats called the agreement a 
"boondoggle" because the county awarded the project to Trottier without seeking 
competitive bids. Republicans argued the rink required a professional skill 
only Trottier could offer. 
</P>
<P>
Trottier, bewildered, got caught in the crossfire. 
</P>
<P>
He'd made Long Island his home. He felt abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
The rink deal eventually fell through, but by then Trottier was in Pittsburgh, 
making new friends. Pittsburgh is his second home, Trottier says. "Long Island 
is still home, always will be." 
</P>
<P>
That's why Arbour, an old softie, said he expects the scene of Trottier taking 
the ice in a Pittsburgh uniform to be "very touching." It's why Brent Sutter 
said, "It's going to seem funny not seeing Trots sitting in the corner of the 
room, teasing one of the guys, like he always did." 
</P>
<P>
At least he will be wearing his familiar No. 19. The number was a gift from 
Randy Gilhen, the Penguin who wore it last season. He presented a sweater with 
the numeral to Trottier on the first day of training camp, and a bond between 
the two grew immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"It sort of reminded me of my first roommate, Neil Nicholson," Trottier said. 
"He took me under his wing and we got along great. To me, he might as well have 
been Bobby Orr. He'd wait for me in the hotel lobby, we'd go out to eat, hang 
around, talk hockey. That was a great time." 
</P>
<P>
That was 15 years ago.

X MARKS START OF SUPERSONICS' HOPES FOR 1990-91 SEASON

<P>
This was just a few nights ago, in practice, with his own teammates suffering 
the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Xavier McDaniel locked arms with Dale Ellis, threatening to throw him to the 
ground if he didn't back off. They jawed for a while before Ellis relented. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, he wrestled Nate McMillan to the floor with the ball. The verbal 
exchange went something like this: 
</P>
<P>
"Bleep you," McDaniel said. 
</P>
<P>
"Bleep you," McMillan said. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah, well bleep you," McDaniel concluded. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, standing at the free-throw line about to shoot a couple of 
freebies, Sedale Threatt walked in front of him with some ill-advised chatter. 
McDaniel swatted at him with a backhand to the head. 
</P>
<P>
This was during a 15-minute span in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
"He just wanted everybody to know this is serious business," Sonics coach K.C. 
Jones said. "X is the kind of guy you love to have in practice. He sets the 
tone for the games every day." 
</P>
<P>
And Friday night at 7:30 against the Golden State Warriors it will come to pass 
during the Sonics first exhibition game -- in the Spokane Coliseum -- that 
McDaniel finally will get to pound on somebody else besides his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to play physical and aggressive if we're going to win games in this 
conference," McDaniel said. "It's my style to be serious about basketball the 
minute I walk out on the floor or I may as well not be out there." 
</P>
<P>
Jones loves it. His teammates love it too, as long as he's into it with guys 
from another team. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just the way he is and it helps the rest of us," Sonics forward Shawn 
Kemp said. "We have to be competitors. At least that's the way I am." 
</P>
<P>
This year in particular the Sonics will have to be more aggressive on defense. 
Last season, the first without shot-blocker Alton Lister, they also lightened 
up their pressure defense. It was a bad combination that resulted in too many 
easy paths to the basket for opposing players. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to let that happen this year," McDaniel said. "We're going to 
trap more and just play tougher. We've got a deep bench and everybody will be 
able to go all-out while they're in there." 
</P>
<P>
The lead role in this all-out attack on the opposition will begin with 
McDaniel. Although not the most efficient one-on-one defender, he is a 
relentless trapper in the Sonics full-court presses, and the first to show up 
on help defense. This attitude is reflective of what the 27-year-old forward 
has been to the Sonics since he was the fourth player taken in the 1985 draft. 
</P>
<P>
That's why even now it's hard for him to swallow how frequently his name came 
up in trade rumors. The most recent was McDaniel and Nate McMillan to Cleveland 
for John "Hot Rod" Williams. That deal was completed but vetoed by Williams, 
who utilized his option as a restricted free-agent signee. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still sitting in the back of my mind regardless of what has happened or 
anybody else has said," McDaniel said. "From now until February is a long time. 
The trade deadline. That's when I can relax. That's just the way it has 
become." 
</P>
<P>
His perspective is one that is easy to look at it. Then there's the 
complimentary side. 
</P>
<P>
"If he weren't such an outstanding, aggressive player, his name wouldn't keep 
coming up," Jones said. "Everybody keeps hearing his name because he's the guy 
everybody is interested in." 
</P>
<P>
But anyone who knows McDaniel realizes nothing distracts him on the floor once 
the ball is tossed up anyway. No, he can't accept being a sixth man at this 
point of his career on the heels of that unsuccessful attempt two years ago. 
But he may eventually accept that status to extend a career with knees that no 
longer allow him to spring like he did in his first three years in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not ready to do that yet," McDaniel said. "But if you put me on the 
basketball floor, I play hard. That's the way I have to play. It's the way the 
team has to play." 
</P>
<P>
And who's going to argue? 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-year forward Derrick McKey celebrated his birthday Wednesday night. 
Believe it or not, he's still only 24, and still growing. McKey now is nearly 
6-foot-11 and has increased his weight from 215 to 230 ... Look for the first 
cuts from the 17-man roster tonight after the game ... The Sonics travel to 
Oakland Monday night for their second game with the Warriors before heading to 
St. Petersburg, Fla., to play the Chicago Bulls next Thursday. They play the 
Bulls in the Kingdome Oct. 23, and the regular season opens Nov. 3 in the 
Coliseum against the Houston Rockets.

SPARROW BECOMES A ROLE MODEL

The journey was long, but Rory Sparrow finally found a home. 
</P>
<P>
After a decade of bouncing from the New Jersey Nets to the Atlanta Hawks, from 
the New York Knicks to the Chicago Bulls, Sparrow landed in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
The National Basketball Association expansion city grabbed him as a free agent 
in 1988 and made him feel like a star. 
</P>
<P>
As the senior member of the Heat, Sparrow enjoyed status and respect. People 
overlooked his limitations as a point guard, accepting his mediocre shooting 
and modest foot speed. 
</P>
<P>
Heat fans focused on the positive aspects. They were impressed by Sparrow's 
leadership and feel for the game. 
</P>
<P>
At 32, nearing the end of a career that covered more rugged terrain than smooth 
expressway, Sparrow settled down. 
</P>
<P>
"They made a commitment to me," Sparrow said. "They told me to start building 
my home." 
</P>
<P>
On June 27 Sparrow's world fell apart. He was attending an NBA Players 
Association meeting in Hawaii when he bumped into a tourist -- the mother of 
former Sacramento Kings guard Randy Wittman -- who told him he had been traded 
to the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
"In retrospect, there was bitterness," Sparrow said this week at the Kings' 
Yuba College training camp. "I didn't expect a trade. They hadn't said anything 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
Sparrow will return home when the Kings make an abbreviated trip to Boca Raton, 
Fla., for an exhibition game Sunday against the Heat at Florida Atlantic 
University. 
</P>
<P>
The trade forced Sparrow back into the role he thought he had escaped, the role 
of NBA nomad. 
</P>
<P>
Since joining the Nets as a fourth-round draft pick from Villanova in 1980, 
Sparrow had been traded, waived or released seven times. 
</P>
<P>
Now the cycle is beginning again. Sparrow has landed on a new, rebuilt team 
with an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat made a calculated decision to trade Sparrow. In simple language, he 
was too old. 
</P>
<P>
Despite assurances there would always be room for Sparrow in Miami's heart, the 
Heat was impressed by the progress made by rookie guard Sherman Douglas last 
season. Douglas, 24, made Sparrow expendable. 
</P>
<P>
When the Kings offered to trade a second-round draft choice for Sparrow, the 
Heat accepted. Miami's risk was rewarded when guard Bimbo Coles was still 
available with the 40th pick of June's draft. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat instructed the Kings to draft Coles on Miami's behalf, gaining a young 
point guard while sacrificing Sparrow. The Kings didn't like losing Coles, but 
they were eager to acquire an experienced guard like Sparrow. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our eyes on three veteran guards, but Scotty Stirling swore by Rory," 
Kings coach Dick Motta said. "He said Rory would be perfect for us, with the 
right mentality, attitude and work ethic." 
</P>
<P>
Stirling, the Kings' scout, was general manager of the Knicks when Sparrow 
played in New York. Stirling bubbled with praise for Sparrow, noting, "You 
can't go wrong with him." 
</P>
<P>
Sparrow is part player, part teacher. The Kings have four rookies and five free 
agents in camp. Rookie guard Travis Mays, a former shooting guard, is making 
the switch to point guard. 
</P>
<P>
"Travis is going to school on Rory," Motta said. 
</P>
<P>
Sparrow's value extends beyond his tutorial talents. With his working-class 
skills and experience, he is ideally suited for Motta's half-court offense and 
physical defense. 
</P>
<P>
But Sparrow isn't ready to concede the starting job to Mays. A collision with 
Byron Irvin's elbow split Sparrow's lip Tuesday. After seven stitches, Sparrow 
was back in uniform Wednesday but avoided contact. 
</P>
<P>
Sparrow is trying to make the best of his circumstances with the Kings. His 
contract expires next summer. He hopes to win a new agreement and stay in the 
league for another few years. 
</P>
<P>
"This team is a lot different than Miami," he said. "Here, we have two All-Star 
caliber guys in Wayman Tisdale and Antoine Carr. They're capable of scoring 
when we need it. 
</P>
<P>
"In Miami, we would play hard but couldn't finish. I took a lot of last-second 
shots."

RED SOX SEASON WAS A SUCCESS DESPITE BEING SWEPT BY THE A'S 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Boston Red Sox never quite seem to get it right, do they? The embarrassment 
of Roger Clemens' second-inning ejection. Being swept by the A's their past two 
American League Championship Series appearances. The haunting specter of 10 
consecutive losses in postseason play, beginning with Game 6 of the 1986 World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
Against baseball's best team, the Sox were rendered lifeless. They scored one 
run in each game. They made several key mental mistakes afield. Their starting 
pitching was good, but was quickly made irrelevant -- the bullpen was pathetic. 
Their only superstar, Clemens, is so full of himself that he is threatening to 
become a destabilizing force, as he was in Game 4 when he didn't have the sense 
to keep his profane mouth shut. However abrupt his actions might have seemed, 
plate umpire Terry Cooney reminded the Red Sox of something they seem to have 
forgotten: There are some rules by which even Roger Clemens must abide. 
</P>
<P>
You had to feel sorry for the A's. In the 1989 ALCS, their victory was marred 
by Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston's accusation that Dennis Eckersley was 
doctoring the ball. When they finally concluded their 1989 World Series sweep 
of the Giants, it had been rendered trivial and anticlimactic by the 
earthquake. Then came the eruption of Mount Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
But when you clear away the debris from the A's assault, the Red Sox had a 
great season. For a team that lacked speed and home run hitting, a team that 
was virtually holding tryouts for its rotation, the season -- however it ended 
-- was a resounding success. Mike Boddicker saying it wouldn't be unless the 
Sox made the World Series doesn't make it so. 
</P>
<P>
Boddicker was 17-8, but he is a free agent who may have pitched his final game 
for the Sox. Like Nick Esasky a year ago, Boddicker says he hasn't made up his 
mind if he will stay or go. Like Esasky, word is he is leaning toward going. 
</P>
<P>
Boddicker is supposedly miffed at some of the organization's petty ways. Who 
isn't? Boddicker is a bit of a complainer by nature. Big money could make him 
happy enough to stay as the reliable No. 2 starter. After losing Bruce Hurst, 
maybe the Red Sox have learned something. 
</P>
<P>
But what about Clemens? He throws like Nolan Ryan but his increasingly bizarre 
actions are beginning to evoke comparisons to Elvis and Howard Hughes. On the 
mound -- except for Game 4 -- Clemens is usually in control. Off it, he seems 
increasingly out of control. It's no accident a placard above his Fenway 
dressing stall says "Possessed Rebel." 
</P>
<P>
Clemens is a fantastic pitcher. He also is a bully, and frequently a jerk. That 
is part of his persona, part of what helps make him as good as he is. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens' penchant for secrecy about his shoulder problems and conditioning 
habits, his reluctance to be interviewed or to clearly explain himself to Red 
Sox officials, that he seems to expect everyone in the Sox' orbit to live by 
Roger's Rules Of Order -- and the rules often change -- has turned him into the 
team's Mystery Man. When a team's Main Man becomes its Mystery Man, that has an 
unsettling, and harmful, long-term influence. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say the Red Sox should force Clemens to conform. No way. But it 
seems as if they need to try to find some way to rein him in. Otherwise, fire 
Joe Morgan and make Clemens player-manager. 
</P>
<P>
Reining in Clemens, however, may prove to be impossible. Clemens is entering 
his option year, and the Sox' No. 1 priority is making him happy with an 
astronomical multiyear contract. Knowing that, doesn't it strike you as a 
trifle odd that, despite an aching shoulder and no new contract, Clemens 
jeopardized his career in September by coming back to pitch? 
</P>
<P>
Randy Henricks, Clemens' representative, is one tough agent. But he can't 
control his client any more than anyone else can. Clemens wanted to pitch. He 
pitched. Case closed. 
</P>
<P>
While it is far too early to predict the success of the 1991 Red Sox, they 
should get a lot of help from the farm. Slugger Mo Vaughn seems ready to make 
the jump, as do pitchers Dave Owen and Kevin Morton. If Tim Naehring can get 
over his back injury, the Red Sox might be less of a surprise if they again win 
the AL East. 
</P>
<P>
And what of Tom Brunansky? Like Boddicker, he is in his option year. Unlike 
Boddicker, he has been a disappointment. Acquired May 4 in exchange for Lee 
Smith, Brunansky, 30, was expected to be this season's Esasky. Hindered -- who 
knows how much? -- by a slow-healing shoulder injury suffered on one of his 
many outfield dives -- Brunansky hit only 15 home runs, five in the Blue Jays 
series two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox expect more from a right-handed power hitter, and their 
disappointment may stall negotiations. The loss figures to be theirs, not 
Brunansky's. In this market, there always will be some loon eager to meet his 
price. 
</P>
<P>
There also is a price for being a Red Sox fan. But despite the Oakland wipeout, 
this season was worth the price. The Red Sox achieved more than anybody could 
have expected, and if they didn't exactly cover themselves with postseason 
glory, at least they got there. That's more than 22 of baseball's 26 teams can 
say.

City officials say they have made "excellent progress" in hiring minorities, 
but Long Beach has failed to meet its affirmative action goals for at least six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
A recent report by the city's Department of Human Resources and Affirmative 
Action showed a steady but slow increase in the number of minority workers on 
the payroll, but the city still fell short of its objective. Last summer, 1,479 
of the city's 4,187 employees were Latinos, blacks, Asians or American Indians 
-- 92 below the city goal of 1,571. 
</P>
<P>
"We're making progress, but we should have done better," said Councilman 
Clarence Smith, chairman of the city's Quality of Life Committee, which reviews 
affirmative action hiring for the council. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest failure came in the hiring of Latinos, the fastest growing ethnic 
group in the city. While Latinos make up at least 28% of the city's population, 
just 11.9% of the city's employees are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Minorities are especially scarce in top management jobs. While many of the 
city's 22 departments meet city goals for employing blacks, most of those 
workers are in blue-collar jobs. Latinos, Asians and women fare little better 
in acquiring management positions in city government, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
City officials blame low turnover in departments for the city's performance. 
"We're virtually full up, " Deputy City Manager John Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Other officials have pointed to a scarcity of qualified minority candidates. 
</P>
<P>
However, community activists and union officials argue that the problem is not 
with a shortage of minority workers or job openings, but with the way the city 
fills the vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
William Storey, director of the city affirmative action department, said almost 
half of the city's new hires are minority employees. Activists said that to 
make up for the lack of minorities in the work force, that number of new hires 
needs to be higher. 
</P>
<P>
"There is discrimination in the selection of candidates," said Charles Vestal, 
secretary-treasurer of the local unit of the International Assn. of Machinists, 
which represents more than 4,000 city employees. 
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Civil Service Commission show that in 1988, the most recent 
year for which statistics are available, there were more minority than white 
applicants for city jobs filled by civil service. Most of those who passed the 
civil service examination and were certified for openings were minority 
applicants. 
</P>
<P>
But more white than minority candidates were finally given jobs: One out of 
seven white candidates certified by the civil service got a job, in contrast 
with one out of 12 minority candidates, according to figures in the city's 
Affirmative Action Program Plan for 1988-91. 
</P>
<P>
"We're beating the bushes and providing enough people in terms of minorities 
and women," insisted Roberto Uranga, recruiting officer for the city. "But to 
increase proportions, the selection rate has to be a lot higher than it has 
been. That's the only way we'll reach parity in the work force." 
</P>
<P>
Community workers and activists argue that the city needs to expand its 
recruiting efforts, particularly for upper-management positions. The city does 
not have a full-time affirmative action officer.

BADER HEAPS UP FUNDS TO UNSEAT AYALA; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: THE ASSEMBLYMAN'S WAR CHEST OF $407,175 HAS MADE THE SENATE RACE THE 
COSTLIEST IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Armed with $387,000 more than his opponent, Assemblyman Charles W. Bader 
(R-Pomona) is gearing up for a strong finish in his bid to replace state Sen. 
Ruben S. Ayala (D-Chino), who is struggling to retain a seat he has held for 16 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Statements filed with election officials by the 34th State Senate District 
candidates showed that Ayala had $19,788 in his campaign treasury at the end of 
September while Bader had $407,175. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Sheingold, Ayala's campaign manager, said the figures are deceptive. Both 
candidates have raised about the same amount of money, he said, but Ayala has 
probably paid more of his bills. To avoid running up a deficit, Sheingold said, 
he always insists that the campaigns he manages pay bills promptly. 
</P>
<P>
But, Sheingold conceded, it is also evident that with the election less than a 
month away, Bader has "got more money to spend." 
</P>
<P>
In intensive fund-raising efforts over two years, each candidate by the end of 
last month had netted nearly $700,000 in contributions. Bader has saved most of 
his money for an intensive effort to boost voter turnout through absentee 
ballots, and for a barrage of mailers during the final weeks of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Sheingold said Ayala is using mailers and running an absentee ballot effort, 
too, but is also employing cable television. Ayala has spent $60,000 on cable 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
A 30-second spot is appearing on CNN and ESPN programs on cable systems 
throughout the Senate district, which stretches from Diamond Bar and Pomona 
eastward to San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial attacks Bader for an incident last June in which he left the 
Assembly floor to attend a political event and another Republican Assembly 
member cast votes for him. Bader has acknowledged the so-called "ghost-voting," 
but said it was done without his authorization. 
</P>
<P>
Sheingold said the Ayala campaign has turned to cable television advertising 
because he believes political mailers are losing their impact. Bader, however, 
said he thinks mailers are still the most effective approach, and he plans to 
spend nothing on cable. 
</P>
<P>
Although the candidates have raised similar amounts, Bader is getting more help 
from his party and other sources. Bader said that the state Republican Party is 
spending $250,000 in the district, which will push expenditures on his behalf 
by election day above $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sheingold said he hopes to get a mailer from the state Democratic Party but its 
expenditures on Ayala's behalf will "not even be close" to the Republican 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the National Rifle Assn., which was angered by Ayala's vote last 
year for a ban on assault rifles, has sent mailers to voters urging Bader's 
election and Ayala's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
All told, Sheingold said, Bader will outspend Ayala by $300,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
The Bader-Ayala race is by far the most expensive campaign in the San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In the 16th State Senate District, which includes parts of Pasadena and 
Altadena, Sen. Don Rogers (R-Bakersfield) began this month with $116,094 in the 
bank, while his Democratic opponent, former Assemblyman Ray Gonzales, had no 
cash and $5,596 in debts. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales said in his campaign statement that he has raised $77,304 this year 
but spent more than $82,000. Meanwhile, Rogers, who's heavily favored to win 
reelection despite a Democratic edge in voter registration, has raised 
$145,337. 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel Valley's five incumbent Assembly members who are seeking 
reelection are all favored to win, but some of their opponents have raised 
enough money to wage strong campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
In the 60th Assembly District, Republican Ron Aguirre has collected $49,982, 
most of it his own money. He loaned his campaign $38,400. His opponent, 
Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D-Baldwin Park), raised only $47,000 this year but 
had $89,653 in the bank at the beginning of this month, including funds raised 
previously. 
</P>
<P>
In the 42nd Assembly District, South Pasadena Mayor Evelyn Fierro, the 
Democratic nominee, loaned her campaign $31,000 to help amass a total of 
$62,465 for her race against Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy (R-Monrovia). 
Mountjoy reported contributions of $104,393 so far this year, and had $67,159 
on hand Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
In the 41st Assembly District, Democratic nominee Jeanette Mann of Pasadena 
raised $50,035, but most of it was spent during the primary. She had just 
$12,047 in cash at the beginning of this month to face Assemblyman Pat Nolan 
(R-Glendale), who had $136,914 left in the bank after raising more than 
$375,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
In the 59th Assembly District election to pick a successor to Charles M. 
Calderon, who has moved up to the state Senate, Democrat Xavier Becerra of 
Monterey Park has raised much more money than his Republican opponent, Leland 
Lieberg of Alhambra. Becerra raised $140,000 to win a hotly contested primary 
in the heavily Democratic district and has raised another $78,871 for the 
general election. He reported $32,163 in cash at the begining of this month, 
contrasted with $4,841 for Lieberg, who has raised a total of $14,910 this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the money raised in the 52nd Assembly District also was spent in the 
primary. Republican nominee Paul Horcher of Diamond Bar raised $342,794, but 
had only $2,642 in cash at the start of this month. His Democratic opponent, 
Gary Neely, also of Diamond Bar, began this month with $3,526 in cash after 
raising $22,586. Horcher's contributions include $238,421 he loaned to his 
campaign.

BIBLE COLLEGE SAYS, 'LET THERE BE GROWTH'; 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIMAS: A PLAN TO REPLACE ALL BUILDINGS ON CAMPUS -- AND A 114-HOUSE 
DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL FINANCE THE CONSTRUCTION -- HAS TORN THE SHROUD OF 
SECRECY FROM A SMALL BAPTIST SCHOOL.

<TEXT>
<P>
High on a mesa in the hills, shielded from the world by a deep canyon of old 
oak trees, sits the campus of Pacific Coast Baptist Bible College. 
</P>
<P>
So secluded is this training ground for ministers and church workers that 
neighbors who happen upon the campus often remark: "I had no idea you were 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Now they know. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the Christian fundamentalists who operate the college are 
seeking approval for a plan to remake their verdant hillside west of the 
Foothill Freeway -- demolishing the existing campus in favor of a newer model 
and financing the development with the construction of an adjoining tract of 
114 new homes. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission will consider the proposal 
Wednesday. It is reviewing the development because the property is in 
unincorporated territory, although it is surrounded by the city of San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's recommendation to the Board of Supervisors will hinge on the 
wishes of the Bible college -- wanting a new campus to shore up declining 
enrollment -- and the desires of the surrounding bedroom communities -- hoping 
to prevent changes at one of the San Gabriel Valley's most rugged nature 
preserves. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing on the proposal last month, a college official talked about the 
importance of training ministers of God. Residents talked about saving historic 
oaks and the habitats of coyotes, opossums, owls and mountain lions. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides say they hope those goals can coexist peacefully, as the manicured 
campus property and untamed Walnut Creek canyon have for most of this century. 
</P>
<P>
The campus was built in 1928 as a home for underprivileged boys. A decade 
later, the home closed and 150 acres and more than a dozen Spanish-style 
buildings were donated to the state for the operation of a Cal Poly campus. 
When Cal Poly completed its move to Pomona in 1972, the Baptist Bible 
Fellowship made the San Dimas property the permanent home of the Bible college. 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1970s, Pacific Coast Baptist Bible College was flourishing, with an 
enrollment of 500 students. Most of the students, then and now, come from the 
300 churches in the western United States that also donate half of the 
college's operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
But enrollment has gradually declined over the last decade to its current low 
of 170 students. Sixty-seven of those come from California and the rest from 
out of state or overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Stonebraker, a preacher from Kansas who is the college's administrator, 
cites several causes for the declining enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
As the population of teen-agers has been shrinking, so has the supply of 
students for colleges and universities all over the country. The number of high 
school graduates will drop 11.8% from 1988 to 1994, according to the Western 
Interstate Commission for Higher Education. And 672 colleges and universities 
reported openings in their freshman classes this summer, 27% more than just two 
years ago, according to the National Assn. of College Admissions Counselors. 
</P>
<P>
The American Assn. of Bible Colleges has reported that attendance dropped 14.5% 
during the 1980s at 65 colleges the association accredits. 
</P>
<P>
Undergraduate Bible colleges, which mix liberal arts and religious studies, 
have also been hurt by the shrinking number of full-time church jobs available 
to graduates and the desire of many churches to hire pastors with graduate 
degrees from seminaries, said Bill Wilson, assistant director of the Bible 
college association. 
</P>
<P>
Men leaving the San Dimas school once could move right into full-time 
ministerial positions, but now many must bide their time with part-time 
assignments or as counselors or teachers, Stonebraker said. The church allows 
only men to enter its ministry. 
</P>
<P>
Baptist Bible College also may have been hurt by its lack of accreditation. 
Although the college is approved by the state to issue bachelor's degrees, it 
has not been fully accredited because most of its teachers are ministers from 
the community who do not hold graduate degrees that college rating 
organizations require. 
</P>
<P>
And Stonebraker sees a more pervasive reason for the two-thirds drop in his 
school's enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
"Society is so achievement and materially oriented," he said. "The young people 
want to make it big, make a lot of money and make it in the world." 
</P>
<P>
The Baptist ministers who make up the college's board of directors said many of 
those problems are beyond their control. 
</P>
<P>
What they can improve, they say, is the condition of the college itself. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old campus buildings, with their red tile roofs, may hold some 
charm, but that wears thin when the roofs leak in winter, said the Rev. Frank 
Johnson, college president and a minister in Midland, Tex. Foundations are 
cracked, wiring is faulty and plumbing drips. 
</P>
<P>
So the college has drawn a plan to scrap all but one of the 18 buildings on 
campus and replace them with 14 new Spanish-style structures spread across 27 
acres. Under the plan, 70 acres would be set aside for parkland along Walnut 
Creek and the remaining 53 acres would be sold to Century American Corp., a 
Laguna Hills-based home builder, to pay for the new campus. 
</P>
<P>
The Regional Planning Commission will consider both the campus expansion and 
Century American's proposed housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors' complaints have centered on access to the homes and the school. The 
county Fire Department has said the expanded college and homes will need two 
access roads to service the area, which is prone to brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
Only one road leads to the property now -- a narrow, curving private lane that 
snakes onto campus from the north via Valley Center Avenue. It would have to be 
widened and improved to become a public thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
Century American would have to find a second access for its 114 homes. 
</P>
<P>
It would be cheapest to build a road from the south, through the existing Via 
Verde subdivision. Several streets there come within a few feet of the campus 
and could be easily extended. But Via Verde homeowners have fought against such 
access, saying their neighborhood already has too much traffic. 
</P>
<P>
A road from the west would also have to come through an existing neighborhood, 
the Mesa Oaks tract. Homeowners there were opposed, but at last month's 
Planning Commission hearing, more than 30 Mesa Oaks residents appeared to 
support the project -- after the developer agreed not to build an entry road 
past their homes. They called Century American sensitive and receptive. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves only the possibility of an access road from San Dimas Avenue on the 
east, according to Century American executives. They have proposed a massive 
landfill to bridge the rough canyon between the avenue and the plateau where 
the homes and college will be built. 
</P>
<P>
It is the reconfiguration of the land to build this street -- the removal of 
632,000 cubic yards of earth and filling with an almost equal amount -- that 
neighbors and officials in neighboring San Dimas have protested. The 
developer's own reports also show that 361 oak trees will be uprooted. 
</P>
<P>
Most neighbors say they feel some type of improvement is inevitable on the 
college property but that excessive movement of earth and removal of trees will 
damage a canyon sanctuary that has been a favorite of hikers, cyclists, joggers 
and horseback riders. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents often express their dismay simply by recounting their favorite tales 
of wildlife encounters near Walnut Creek. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a big owl in that tree over there the other night and it was really 
hooting," said 10-year resident Kenneth Bickford. "It would be a shame to see 
that disappear." 
</P>
<P>
Emmett Vogan, who lives in the Via Verde area, recalled: "We've had raccoons in 
the pool -- just splashing away and taking a drink -- in the middle of the 
night." His wife, Elizabeth, added: "They're adorable!" 
</P>
<P>
The college's directors and Century American say they are doing their part for 
conservation by setting aside 70 acres of land that will not be developed. They 
say they designed roadways to have as little impact on wildlife as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Development doesn't find such obstacles in his native Texas, college President 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"When we want to do everything within the law and build something that will 
benefit the community," Johnson said, "I have trouble seeing the picture of how 
someone could be against it." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Abata, who lives near the college entrance, said neighbors are trying to 
be reasonable. "It's a hard question," Abata said. "I'm sure there is some 
point when everyone agrees the building has to stop, but no one can agree on 
when that should be."

All ye who think of church music as ancient choruses from some dusty hymnal, 
take note: 
</P>
<P>
All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena is singing a different tune. 
</P>
<P>
Premiering tonight is "Musica Mundial," a concert of culturally diverse, 
modern- 
</P>
<P>
day religious music for a new world. 
</P>
<P>
"We're suggesting that our music is the answer to the question, 'What is the 
current-day religious music?' for people who want to feed the hungry, treat men 
and women as equals, save the Earth and promote peace," said Ray Egan, composer 
</P>
<P>
and music director at All Saints. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the international spirit of musica mundial (which means "world 
music" in Portuguese and Spanish), a five-person band and eight-person chorus 
will perform a number of Latin American-influenced songs with the help of an 
extensive Latino percussion section. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the songs on tonight's program are being performed for the first time, 
Egan said. About half of the composers are from far-away lands, such as Brazil 
and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
Also featured will be a rendition of the 
</P>
<P>
American poet E. E. Cummings' verse "i thank you God," composed by Egan. 
</P>
<P>
Egan said some of the music is based on biblical texts and theological themes, 
but as seen through the eyes of the liberation theology movement in emerging 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a theology that emanates from our own time as opposed to our 
grandparents' world," Egan said. 
</P>
<P>
The concert will begin at 7 p.m. at All Saints, 132 N. Euclid Ave. in Pasadena. 
A $5 donation is requested. A second concert is being planned for February, 
1991. MARY ANN SWISSLER

The 22nd annual Long Beach Boat Show, launched by the Southern California 
Marine Assn., will bring a variety of boats and equipment displays to the Long 
Beach Convention and Entertainment Center beginning Friday and sailing through 
Oct. 28. The event traditionally assembles the largest fleet of show boats and 
boating accessories in the West, and is the time when many manufacturers 
introduce new models. 
</P>
<P>
Approximately 475 pleasure boats, both power and sail, from 125 brand-name boat 
lines, will be featured. More than 300 booths will display equipment, supplies 
and services for recreational boats. Booths will feature representatives and 
merchandise from sailmakers, spar builders, engine dealers, communications and 
navigational electronics, boat trailers, water skis and more. 
</P>
<P>
An educational feature at the boat show will be a panel of experts on 
long-distance cruising, sailboat racing, fishing and water skiing. They will 
take turns presenting a series of two seminars a night through Oct. 27. 
Included on the panel are Gerry Cunningham, columnist for Pacific Boating 
Almanac and Sea magazine; Bill Gaither, professional tournament fisherman and 
wildlife artist and writer; Earl Hinz, Pacific contributing editor for Cruising 
World magazine; Ronnie Kovach, professional fishing instructor; and Scott 
Gobel, a member of the Kidder professional ski team. 
</P>
<P>
There also will be a drawing at the end of the show for a seven-day vacation 
for two to Tahiti via Air New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
The boat show will be open at the center, 300 E. Ocean Blvd., from 3 to 10 p.m. 
weekdays, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturdays, and 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sundays. Tickets 
are $5 for adults, children under 12 are free, and discount tickets are 
available from Southern California Marine Assn. members, marine retail stores 
and participating Kinko's Copy Centers. For more information, call the Southern 
California Marine Assn. at (714) 633-7581. MIKE RAMOS

Another piece of the sprawling commercial corridor envisioned by city leaders 
in the hills of northern Montebello fell into place last week when the City 
Council approved an agreement to negotiate with two auto companies to develop a 
10-acre auto park. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted Tuesday, 4 to 1, to begin exclusive talks with Ford 
Motor Land Development Co. and Ostrom Chevrolet, which want five acres each to 
build an auto sales center. 
</P>
<P>
The auto park is one of three projects planned in the 660-acre Montebello Hills 
Redevelopment Project Area, which encompasses the rolling hillside now dotted 
by oil wells south of the Pomona Freeway and parts of town north of Beverly 
Boulevard between Garfield Avenue and the Rio Hondo River. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes as planned, the auto park will be built between Montebello 
Boulevard and the Pomona Freeway, just west of Paramount Boulevard. Linda 
Payan, the city's economic development director, said the auto complex would 
provide 150 to 200 jobs, and the city could reap $500,000 a year in sales tax 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Before work begins, officials of the land development company and Ostrom 
Chevrolet must present the city with a final proposal within 120 days. Each 
company is negotiating to buy a five-acre parcel, which would cost about $2 
million, Payan said. 
</P>
<P>
Payan said the city is marking down the price per square foot from $13 to $9, 
saving each company about $900,000, including the price of land grading. 
</P>
<P>
If the final proposal by the two companies is approved by the city, Ostrom will 
relocate from its Whittier Boulevard location, and Ford may open a new sales 
center or relocate an existing center, Payan said. 
</P>
<P>
Final paper work has yet to be completed, but city leaders are confident that a 
deal with the companies will be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're talking about this much money, it's not a done deal until the 
check is signed," Mayor Ed Pizzorno said. "But I would expect things are 90% 
solid. I'm optimistic, we are well on our way." 
</P>
<P>
Payan said the city was approached by four auto dealers who wanted to buy the 
10-acre site, but Ford and Ostrom Chevrolet had the strongest proposals and, 
historically, have had the strongest sales. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed auto park is just one chunk of a growing commercial core in 
northern Montebello. By the end of the decade, city officials estimate, at 
least 130 acres of retail shops, restaurants and many other businesses could be 
operating around the intersection of Montebello and Paramount boulevards. If 
the businesses succeed, the city could be earning about $3 million a year in 
sales tax revenues from the northern Montebello commercial corridor. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes people come up to me, and they ask, 'Why do you want more shops up 
there? Why do we need an auto center?' " Pizzorno said. "People sometimes don't 
realize what things like that mean to a city. 
</P>
<P>
"They want police protection, fire protection, park programs. . . . It's the 
sales tax produced up there that pays for all that protection. To do everything 
that the people want, we have to have the money." 
</P>
<P>
To get that money, the city in May approved the $33-million Montebello Town 
Square project, a 20-acre commercial center to be built next to the auto park 
and east of the 5-year-old Montebello Regional Town Center shopping mall. The 
mall last year pumped $982,000 in sales tax revenue into the city's coffers. 
</P>
<P>
The Town Square will include a movie complex with eight to 10 screens, a 
theater, three fast-food outlets, an upscale restaurant, a Sears shopping 
center and a toy store. 
</P>
<P>
The city is also working on plans with Chevron Land &amp; Development Co. to 
develop a 450-acre residential and commercial development directly south of the 
auto park, Town Square and Regional Town Center. Preliminary plans for the 
Chevron project, which will encompass the last remaining open space in 
Montebello, call for luxury homes and condominiums, a senior citizens' housing 
complex, a new fire station, an elementary school and a commercial site of 50 
to 75 acres that would face the auto center and Town Square. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the Chevron project are not expected to be finalized for two years, 
and development could take eight years, city leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all feeling good about what is happening in our community right now," 
Councilwoman Kathy Salazar said. "We are making a lot of progress."

A VOTE FOR FIXING HIGHWAY 39 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re: Permanent closing of Highway 39 north of Crystal Lake (Times, Sept. 13), a 
different perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve years ago a 160-yard section of Highway 39 fell away in a slide. Against 
the best interests of the people in the San Gabriel Valley, Caltrans and the 
U.S. Forest Service arbitrarily decided that it should not be repaired or 
replaced, unhappily a first in anyone's memory for California. 
</P>
<P>
Their plan is to permanently close the only access to Angeles Crest Highway 
between La Canada and the Wrightwood exit off Highway 15, a distance of 
approximately 75 miles. Caltrans sees "no economic impact" of the long extra 
drive to access the forest at the crest for all the people of our valley. 
</P>
<P>
The slide cut off access to the ridge-top Highway 2 and 65 miles of forest 
access. By refusing to reopen Highway 39, they in effect put a cork in the 
bottle that is the lower section of that road. They watched the "people 
pressure" build until it was so great that even on that public road they were 
audacious enough to charge $3 to stop anywhere, even for a minute, and look at 
a mountain. (The Los Angeles County Parks and Recreation Department charges a 
$3 user fee to park alongside Highway 39 on weekends and holidays.) 
</P>
<P>
They use non-facts, nonsensical comparisons and misleading implications to 
bolster this attempt at "Highway robbery": 
</P>
<P>
Non-Facts. Their published cost for reopening the highway is $20 million, and 
$2 million to close it permanently. When pressed, they admitted the figures are 
an unscientific estimate, a shot from the hip. They admitted also they had no 
idea what the cost of replacing only the 160 yards of the slide area would be. 
</P>
<P>
Nonsensical Comparisons. In an effort to minimize the perceived effect the 
closing will have on the community, they compare 12-year-old statistics of a 
two-lane mountain access road (200 average daily trips) with "today's urban 
freeways and major arterial highways." The truth is, today's figure for Highway 
39 is 2,700 ADTs. It is a fantastic figure for a dead end mountain access road 
that costs $3 to stop for one minute to look at a mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Misleading Implication. They list several environmental considerations, such as 
roadway erosion, sediment deposits in creek beds and building crossings for 
migrating animals. They imply that the solutions are beyond Caltrans' science. 
The fact is they have solved these problems already. But of course, it was done 
on Highway 50, which is Sacramento's and the Caltrans brass' access to Lake 
Tahoe and their own forest.

HANGOVER LINGERS IN PARTY AFTERMATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again South Peyton Place (a.k.a. South Pasadena) dominated the front page 
of several newspapers over the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
No, it's not the freeway fight. 
</P>
<P>
There appear to have been a few skirmishes to see who's boss in a town that 
involves several factions. 
</P>
<P>
I'd like to comment on a headline in the Los Angeles Times, "No One's Satisfied 
in Aftermath of Party," (Oct. 4) and the soap opera story that followed. 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to be a bartender to know that mixing certain ingredients will 
probably result in a huge hangover. One recipe for rancor on the rocks: 
</P>
<P>
Main ingredients are young offspring of prominent and powerful families 
gathered to support Bartles and Jaymes. (No, they're not political candidates!) 
</P>
<P>
Blend in some music to serenade the neighborhood, possibly featuring "Little 
John and the Bombastic Bass Belchers." 
</P>
<P>
Add a short fuse to a longtime annoyed neighbor, who knows the police phone 
number by heart. 
</P>
<P>
Throw in a dash of one of those settlers for the stomach, "How do you spell 
relief?" "P-O-L-I-C-E!" 
</P>
<P>
Shake well, pour and gulp, then resist any temptation to conduct yourself in a 
responsible manner. I hear this concoction is called "Pandora's Punch." 
</P>
<P>
It will probably be a while before the doctor diagnoses the root cause of the 
traumatic disorder and makes his findings known to the master of the house. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, my Rx for the neighborhood: Take two aspirin and go to bed 
until the hangover disappears. Oh yes, you could pray for rain. It keeps people 
indoors and the windows shut.

BRUIN GROUND FORCE DEFLATES AZTECS; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: AFTER PLANNING TO PASS, UCLA FINDS A DIFFERENT WAY TO 
SUCCESS. BROWN RUSHES FOR 175 YARDS IN A 45-31 VICTORY OVER SAN DIEGO STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Any team that gets involved with the San Diego Aztecs is caught up in a 
high-scoring game. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA wasn't any exception Saturday night at the Rose Bowl. The Bruins held off 
quarterback Dan McGwire's pass-minded team to win, 45-31, before 41,025 and 
improved their record to 3-3. The Aztecs are 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-8 McGwire completed 23 of 46 passes for 343 yards and three 
touchdowns. He threw an interception on the last play of the game, breaking a 
string of 178 passes without being intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA countered with tailback Brian Brown, who rushed for 175 yards in 22 
carries, an eight-yard average, and scored two touchdowns. It was the most 
yards rushing by a Bruin since Gaston Green gained 220 against California in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins had six rushing touchdowns, equaling their total through their first 
five games. 
</P>
<P>
"We went into the game convinced that we had to throw the ball a high number of 
times," UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said. "We absolutely thought we couldn't run 
the ball. We did feel one way to run the ball was to get the option going. Our 
best bet was to get the ball outside and generate yards." 
</P>
<P>
Said Brown: "There was a lot of running room for me -- a lot of yards to be 
made. I didn't have to make a lot of moves or take a lot of hits." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA quarterback Tommy Maddox completed 12 of 18 passes for 139 yards without a 
touchdown. The Bruins had 515 total yards. San Diego State had been allowing an 
average of 508 going into the game, ranking the Aztecs 105th among 106 Division 
I-A teams in total defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense found another way to self-destruct," San Diego State Coach Al 
Luginbill said. "We just didn't get it done. We didn't adjust in the first 
half. In the second half, our defense was aggressive, but we went in the tank 
offensively. 
</P>
<P>
"UCLA won and deserved to win. We dropped too many balls in crucial situations. 
We made too many miscues and our running game came in spurts." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State wide receiver Patrick Rowe caught 11 passes for 224 yards and 
one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA led, 42-24, after three quarters before San Diego State closed to 42-31 
early in the fourth quarter. Brad Daluiso then gave UCLA more breathing room 
with a 27-yard field goal later in the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs kept surging behind McGwire after UCLA had moved to what seemed to 
be comfortable leads. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State more than held its own against the Bruins in the first quarter, 
in which the score was tied, 14-14. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA scored first after Stacey Argo recovered Dennis Arey's fumble at the San 
Diego 28-yard line. The Bruins got the touchdown from the 13-yard line when 
Maddox rolled out to the right for seven yards then pitched to Brown, who went 
the rest of the way. The Aztecs quickly retaliated when Patrick Rowe took the 
next kickoff 42 yards to the Bruin 43. 
</P>
<P>
After Larry Maxey gained 17 yards, McGwire teamed with Arey on a 28-yard gain, 
Arey beating Michael Williams on a sideline route. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later McGwire and Arey teamed for a touchdown from the 10-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins regained the lead, 14-7, on an 80-yard drive that was highlighted by 
a 25-yard pass from Maddox to Shawn Wills, who was open in the middle of the 
Aztec defense. 
</P>
<P>
Maddox got the touchdown on a one-yard dive with 6:22 left in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State soon tied the score, 14-14. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire, on first down from the Aztec 38, teamed with Rowe on a 49-yard pass 
play. Williams, who was filling for injured cornerback Carlton Gray, again was 
beaten on the play. 
</P>
<P>
The pass play carried to the UCLA 12. On second down, McGwire threw a 10-yard 
pass to Jim Hanawalt for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The quarter soon ended with the score tied, but the Bruins were on the move. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA was using the option more than any time during the season. Brown took a 
pitch out from Maddox and ran 28 yards to the Aztec seven, the key play of the 
80-yard advance. 
</P>
<P>
Then, fullback Kevin Smith scored on first down through a huge hole in the 
middle of San Diego defense. 
</P>
<P>
After Daluiso's extra point, the Bruins went ahead again, 21-14. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins drove 69 yards to a touchdown that stretched their lead to 28-14 
later in the quarter. Maddox threw a 21-yard pass to flanker Scott Miller and 
ran 13 yards for a first down at the San Diego State 10-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Maury Toy, a former fullback now playing tailback, scored the touchdown from 
the two-yard line. UCLA expanded its lead to 28-14 on Daluiso's extra point. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztec offense was stalling by then and, after a 29-yard punt, the Bruins 
were in good field position at the San Diego 48-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA increased its lead to 35-14 when Wills raced 25 yards through a sizable 
hole in the middle of the Aztec defense. 
</P>
<P>
With time running out in the first half, McGwire threw a 38-yard rainbow pass 
to Rowe in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire had completed 13 of 22 passes for 229 yards and three touchdowns by 
halftime. Maddox's statistics were more modest. He completed only six of nine 
passes for 86 yards. 
</P>
<P>
On UCLA's first possession in the third quarter, the Bruins tried for a first 
down on fourth and one from their 45-yard line. But Kevin Smith failed to get 
the yardage. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs then drove to the first field goal of the game. Andy Trakas kicked 
the three-pointer after San Diego's drive stalled at the Bruin seven-yard line. 
That closed the score to 35-24. 
</P>
<P>
On UCLA's next possession, Brown broke a tackle and raced 37 yards down the 
sideline to a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
With Daluiso's extra point, UCLA led, 42-24, with 5:51 left in the third 
quarter.

NCAA'S GREED IS SHOWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LITTWIN, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well, the college folks are really doing it up right this time. In its January 
convention, the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. is probably going to enact a 
bunch of rules saying, in effect, that unless you can spend with the big boys, 
you can't play with the big boys -- even if you can beat them. 
</P>
<P>
This should be remembered as the convention when the NCAA voted to take away 
David's slingshot. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, romance. And the old college try. 
</P>
<P>
Try this instead: The college powers have put together a package that asks, and 
not so nicely, that everyone else go home. Here are some of the highlights: In 
order to play any sport on the Division I level, a school must play all its 
sports on the Division I -- or highest -- level. The proposed rules mandate 
that a college must extend 50 full scholarships in sports other than football 
and basketball to be eligible to play any Division I sports (or spend $500,000 
on these scholarships). Also, the college must field a minimum of 14 Division I 
teams, or none at all. 
</P>
<P>
Confused? I don't blame you. In simpler terms, it means that Johns Hopkins, 
unless given special dispensation, can't play Division I lacrosse and 
non-scholarship Division III everything else. It means that if Towson State 
wants to cut back its losing football program from Division I-AA to Division II 
or Division III, Towson can't play Division I basketball or gymnastics or 
lacrosse. Because of these new rules, Towson may have to drop football 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
How does the NCAA justify these actions? Do the big schools pushing these 
proposals simply admit their greed and be done with it? Not exactly. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they say that Division I has gotten unwieldly, with as many as 300 
schools competing in basketball, where the stakes -- thanks, in part, to 
CBS-TV's billion-dollar contract -- have become enormous. They say that similar 
schools with similar commitment down the line to college sports should be 
grouped similarly. In other words, Towson State should butt out. 
</P>
<P>
Is this greed at work? 
</P>
<P>
"You've got that right," Maryland Athletic Director Andy Geiger said. "Any 
school that wants to express itself ought to have that opportunity. Who is the 
University of Maryland to decide Towson State can't have a first-rate 
gymnastics program if they want to limp along in football? 
</P>
<P>
"Let everyone play who wants to. Who's it hurting? We ought to give David a 
chance to play Goliath. That's what's fun." 
</P>
<P>
Well, excuse Geiger. He's the guy who voted against Atlantic Coast Conference 
expansion because he thinks there is more to college sports than grabbing all 
the available money. That is, of course, a distinctly minority opinion. Just 
look around. The big conferences are gobbling up all the major independents. 
Not so long after the major football powers broke away from the NCAA so they 
could negotiate their own TV contract, Notre Dame broke away from the other 
powers to negotiate a package of its own. 
</P>
<P>
In college sports, there is much talk -- only that, of course -- about 
beginning the hard job of cleaning up its house, hard by the Love Canal. When 
CBS said it would fork over the billion dollars for the NCAA basketball 
tournament, a committee set to work to study how this windfall might best be 
spent. Among the ideas discussed was one tying disbursement to graduation 
rates. Guess what they did instead? They decided that the schools with the most 
programs and the most scholarship athletes get the largest hunk of the pie. 
</P>
<P>
It's the growing pie that is behind all this. Many schools have tried to 
produce Division I basketball programs so that they might get a slice. The 
big-time basketball schools, which could, after all, produce their own TV 
contracts, want all the pie for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, there is some additional funding put aside for the Division II basketball 
tournament as an incentive for smaller programs to return to competition at a 
more comfortable level. But that means -- and here's the strange part -- that 
those schools couldn't compete in any sport on the Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
Why not? 
</P>
<P>
That's the question many schools are facing. Georgetown and St. John's, two 
basketball powers, will probably have to drop their Division III football 
programs, meaning students there can't play football. Why does Towson have to 
raise its student fees from $270 to $370 or drop football? 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to separate the men from the boys," Towson Athletic Director 
Bill Hunter said. "They figure that if you don't pay your dues, you shouldn't 
get a shot at the pot of gold. I don't know what's right or wrong. But I know 
it puts an onus on us and a lot of other schools to make fundamental changes 
because we can't afford 95 (football) scholarships or have 100,000-seat 
stadiums." 
</P>
<P>
Towson made it to the NCAA basketball tournament last season. It went to the 
nationals in women's gymnastics. It's not a big-time sports power, but it has 
some big-time programs. Now, that's not good enough. Here's the message to 
Towson (and you wonder how anyone could vote for it in these overheated days of 
college scandal when academics are routinely ignored and athletes exploited): 
Get bigger or get out.

The umpire sees a pitch one way. The pitcher sees a pitch another way. 
</P>
<P>
The pitcher says a bunch of nasty stuff to the umpire. 
</P>
<P>
The umpire says nothing. 
</P>
<P>
The pitcher says to the umpire: "You're a gutless !%*!" 
</P>
<P>
The umpire says nothing. 
</P>
<P>
The pitcher says to the umpire: "Get back behind the plate, you !%*!$&amp;!" 
</P>
<P>
The umpire says nothing. He has been called a dollar sign and an exclamation 
point before, but nobody has ever called him an ampersand, not in front of this 
many people. 
</P>
<P>
The pitcher says to the umpire: "You dirty word! You're nothing but a big fat 
dirty word!" 
</P>
<P>
The umpire says nothing. He has heard enough. He'd have to plug his ears with 
chewing tobacco not to hear any of this. Players can hear it. Fans in box seats 
can hear it. The pitcher is so shrill, dogs down the street can hear it. It is 
the worst sound coming from a ballpark since Roseanne Barr. 
</P>
<P>
I am an umpire, says the umpire. I don't have to stand here and take this. I 
have power. I have authority. Nobody calls me an ampersand and gets away with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The pitcher says to the umpire: "You're blind as a baseball bat, you eggplant, 
and your mother wears go-go boots." 
</P>
<P>
The pitcher has gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
I have here a thumb, says the umpire. It's a nice little thumb. It doesn't do 
much, my thumb, except maybe twiddle. But at times my thumb comes in handy. At 
times like these, I need my thumb. My thumb is my friend. 
</P>
<P>
The umpire thumbs the pitcher out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The wild pitcher nearly goes to the screen. He is livid. He is vivid. Roger 
Clemens calls umpire Terry Cooney many colorful things, none of which is "man 
in blue." He throws a fit at 95 m.p.h. He bumps a couple of umps. On a tantrum 
scale, 10 being Billy Martin, we give "Roger and Me" a 9. 
</P>
<P>
The pitcher's teammates do their part. They throw Gatorade containers onto the 
field. If they had any, they'd throw gators onto the field. They want the 
umpire's hide. How dare he eject our only good pitcher? It's OK to eject one of 
our many rotten pitchers, but Roger is our good pitcher. He can't eject Roger! 
</P>
<P>
I am the featured attraction, says Roger. Nobody came to see the umpire, says 
Roger. I can behave any immature way I want because these people paid to see 
me, says Roger. Haven't you ever been to a tennis match? 
</P>
<P>
Besides, I never said nothing to nobody, says Roger. I am a nice boy, says 
Roger. I never called anybody an ampersand. I wasn't even talking to you. I 
wasn't even talking to anybody. I wasn't even talking. I wasn't even there. 
</P>
<P>
The umpire says: Nobody stands out there and says stuff to me that way. This 
diamond ain't a-big enough for the both of us. 
</P>
<P>
The pitcher says: I don't want to pitch if any umpires are going to be out 
there. I want to be alone. I am a rock. I am an island. 
</P>
<P>
The umpire says: Rule 1916-BS of my handbook specifically states that: "No 
baseball player can say anything bad to an umpire's face, never ever ever, 
especially a player for the Boston Red Sox, who haven't won a World Series in 
so long that they shouldn't be taken seriously." 
</P>
<P>
The pitcher says: I think special dispensation should be made for a pitcher 
pitching in a big playoff game to be able to call an umpire names and to go out 
into the parking lot and smash the headlights and windshields on his car if we 
feel like it, because I am the pitcher and therefore I am the game. 
</P>
<P>
The umpire says: Sticks and stones can break my bones, but if he calls me one 
more name I'll beat him with a bat until he's as limp as that rosin bag. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner says: Whoa, there, boys. The important thing here is that the 
Red Sox lost anyway, just like we all knew they would anyway, so let's just let 
bygones be bygones and go talk things over with all the women in the locker 
room. 
</P>
<P>
The media say: Hey, we think umpires are basically good people, but this was a 
playoff game so it's OK by us if a pitcher treats an umpire like dirt because I 
didn't come all this way to watch some nobody named Tom Bolton pitch. 
</P>
<P>
The public says: This was just a typical case of an umpire abusing his 
authority, because all Terry Cooney had to do was walk out there and warn Roger 
Clemens that if he didn't clean up his language in the next 30 seconds he was 
going to walk back out there and whisk-broom his lips. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland players say: Roger Clemens got what he deserved. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston players say: Roger Clemens did not deserve what he got. 
</P>
<P>
Little Leaguers say: I want to be just like Roger Clemens when I grow up. 
</P>
<P>
Big Leaguers say: I want to be just like Roger Clemens when he grows up.

DIBBLE: STORM BEFORE THE CALM; 
</P>
<P>
NL PLAYOFFS: REDS' RELIEVER SAYS HE OWES SUCCESS TO DODGERS' HOWELL. THEN HE 
VOWS SILENCE UNTIL AFTER THE WORLD SERIES.

CINCINNATI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As if it isn't already going to be hard enough for Dodger fans to watch the 
Cincinnati Reds in the World Series, now there is this story. 
</P>
<P>
It was the last day of May, at Dodger Stadium, shortly before the first meeting 
between the top two contenders in the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
When the Dodgers' Jay Howell was leaving the field after batting practice, he 
was intercepted by a tall Reds pitcher wearing a protective sleeve on his right 
elbow. 
</P>
<P>
Howell recognized the sleeve. He also recognized the pitcher and was a bit 
surprised when he stuck out his hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Jay, I'm Rob Dibble," the pitcher said. "Can you help me?" 
</P>
<P>
Dibble, suffering from elbow problems, asked Howell how he treated similar 
injuries earlier in his career. He asked for advice on weights. He asked for 
ideas on exercises. 
</P>
<P>
And so began a relationship that Dibble says helped him become the intimidating 
pitcher who will lead the National League champion Reds against the Oakland 
Athletics beginning Tuesday at Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, I owe my whole season to Jay Howell. . . . He saved my arm this year," 
Dibble said last week before winning the co-most valuable player award with 
teammate Randy Myers in the National League playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"What he did for me was really nice, even though we're on different teams," 
Dibble said. "We're all in this game together, and he proved that." 
</P>
<P>
Dibble, 26, in his second full major league season, pitched like vintage Howell 
in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
He did not allow a hit to any of the 16 batters he faced, striking out 10. His 
6-foot-4 presence dominated a bullpen that allowed the Pirates only nine hits 
after the sixth inning in the six games, or fewer than two late-inning hits per 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"You breathe the wrong way against Dibble and the ball is past you," said Stan 
Williams, Reds' pitching coach. "Every big pitch, he made." 
</P>
<P>
Howell, reached at his Atlanta-area home Saturday, said he has been watching 
Dibble on television and has been impressed. 
</P>
<P>
But he wanted to make one thing clear. 
</P>
<P>
"For me or anyone else to say that I was in any way responsible for the success 
of Rob Dibble stretches the imagination," Howell said. "He was a super talent 
before he talked to me, and he has been a super talent since he talked to me. 
</P>
<P>
"All we did was talk. It happens all the time in baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Dibble says it was more than that. 
</P>
<P>
He had spent two weeks on the disabled list midway through the 1989 season 
because of elbow problems. Although he had avoided surgery, he said that when 
he approached Howell this spring he was worried that the elbow was worsening. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw Howell earlier in the year, I just went up to him and asked him how 
he got over his injury," Dibble said. "Just like me, he had a spur just inside 
his elbow. He knew what I had been going through. I wanted to know what I could 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Howell said that, although he did not know Dibble, the request was not 
surprising. 
</P>
<P>
"I did the same thing back when my arm was hurting," Howell said. "I would call 
guys who had surgery, call guys who didn't have surgery, asked what they were 
feeling, go over exercises. Everybody in this game talks about things like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Howell said that based on what Dibble told him, he felt Dibble was doing too 
much rehabilitative work on his triceps. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him to slow down on that sort of work and gave him a couple of other 
exercises to calm it down," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dibble: "He got me doing some exercises with dumb bells and curls. And it 
worked." 
</P>
<P>
Dibble said he also sought advice from Dr. Frank Jobe, Dodger medical director. 
</P>
<P>
"And he helped me a lot, but not like Jay," Dibble said. "And the last time I 
saw Jay, he said, 'I'm not done with you yet, I have other stuff for you.' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to listen because, right now, my arm is 100% better than it was a 
year ago." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps a bigger reason for that difference is the difference between managers 
Pete Rose and Lou Piniella. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Rose used Dibble 46 times in the first half of the season, before 
his elbow broke down. This season, Piniella used Dibble 36 times in the first 
half of the season and 32 times in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Howell chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when I was coming up, I followed Jim Palmer around," Howell said. 
"Everybody talks to somebody else. But to say I made a difference for Rob 
Dibble is being very generous." 
</P>
<P>
Dibble has certainly been generous with such revelations throughout the 
playoffs. Rarely has such a player grabbed the spotlight by force. 
</P>
<P>
He began the series by telling people he couldn't stand owner Marge Schott and 
was so upset at being paid $200,000 this season, he had an ulcer and was 
throwing up blood. 
</P>
<P>
He ended the series by being one of a handful of players who hugged and kissed 
Schott. He said he loved the Reds. And he said he felt 100%. 
</P>
<P>
During the middle of the series, he said something to offend everyone from the 
Oakland Athletics to the Pirates' Doug Drabek. 
</P>
<P>
One minute he was saying the Reds were going to "kick Oakland's butt." 
</P>
<P>
The next minute, after the Reds were shut down by Drabek in Game 5, he was 
storming into the clubhouse calling Drabek a "sissy" and wondering out loud 
about his Cy Young Award credentials. 
</P>
<P>
"Rob is a good boy," Schott said last week. "He just doesn't always know when 
to watch his mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Is the World Series ready for this? Maybe it won't have to be. 
</P>
<P>
"I've made a vow to the team," Dibble said late Friday after accepting his 
co-MVP award. "I won't be talking during the World Series. This is the last 
interview I'm giving." 
</P>
<P>
He later added with a smile: "But I'll tell you one thing. In that World 
Series, we're going to yank up and shake a few people."

NEWSWIRE: DICKERSON AGREES TO FOUR-YEAR EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eric Dickerson and the Indianapolis Colts patched up their differences Saturday 
and the running back signed a four-year contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Jim Irsay said Dickerson will have a physical Monday and is 
scheduled to practice with the team Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson is expected to play against the Denver Broncos a week from today. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson, his attorney and advisers reached the agreement in a meeting with 
owner Robert Irsay, team attorney Michael Chernoff and Jim Irsay at the owner's 
home north of Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson, seventh on the NFL's all-time rushing list, has been on the Colts' 
reserve non-football injury list since the start of the season. He is eligible 
to be activated Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
No financial terms were announced. Dickerson had been scheduled to receive 
$1.45 million in 1990, the last year of his contract. However, he stands to 
lose more than $600,000 for the portion of the season he has missed.

Syracuse officials refused to allow a female student reporter to enter the 
locker room after Saturday's football game against Penn State and forced her to 
decide whether all other reporters also would be banned. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Yohannan, an assistant sports editor of the Daily Collegian, the Penn 
State student newspaper, said she was given the option shortly after Penn 
State's 27-21 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I was approached by a Syracuse sports official who said that the players could 
be brought out of the locker room and the locker room itself would be closed to 
everyone, or the locker room would be open to all of the press except me," 
Yohannan said. 
</P>
<P>
She said felt pressured by the offer from Larry Kimball, sports information 
director at Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
Yohannan, 21, a senior English major from Allentown, Pa., was accompanied by a 
male reporter from her newspaper, and he went into the locker room with other 
male reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball said the university has a policy: "The locker room is either open to 
everybody or no one." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the team bans women. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State's locker room is closed to all reporters. Players are taken into a 
separate room for postgame interviews.

Azumah Nelson of Ghana used a left jab to keep Juan LaPorte at bay and retain 
the WBC super-featherweight title with a unanimous 12-round decision at Sydney, 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson was pinned on the ropes four times by LaPorte, who had held the title 
from 1982-84. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who raised his record to 32-2, never hurt LaPorte, who seemed more 
annoyed that he couldn't get close enough to do any serious damage to the 
champion. Still, Nelson connected often enough to win, 116-112, 116-113 and 
115-113, on the three judges' cards. 
</P>
<P>
LaPorte, a 30-year-old, New York-based Puerto Rican whose record fell to 36-11, 
felt he had won. But he praised Nelson's successful tactics.

$5,000 DAILY DOUBLE SETS RECORD FOR SANTA ANITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Itaman, who was nearly 54-1, and Dollar Dance, almost 80-1, won the first two 
races Saturday, combining for a Santa Anita and Oak Tree record $5,000 daily 
double payoff. There were $132 worth of tickets sold on the 12-5 combination 
from the $412,922 daily double pool. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth and eighth in his first two starts, Itaman, a $32,000 2-year-old maiden, 
added Lasix Saturday and was up to beat favored Far Best in the final strides 
under Adalberto Lopez. Trained by Michael Stidham, Itaman paid $109.80 to win. 
</P>
<P>
A winner of one of his previous eight starts, Dollar Dance and apprentice 
Armando Bellido withstood a stewards' inquiry before his $161.80 shocker became 
official. Fire Back, the pacesetter who had already started to tire, had to 
take up sharply in deep stretch, but the stewards ruled the incident didn't 
alter the original order of finish. 
</P>
<P>
A 3-year-old son of Buckfinder who had run long in his previous three starts, 
Dollar Dance had won his last sprint, but it was against $12,500 maidens at Los 
Alamitos in August. He is trained by John O'Hara. 
</P>
<P>
The previous Santa Anita daily double high was $4,028 when King Rogers and 
Night Launch combined to win the first two races on Jan. 23, 1971. Bold And 
Saucy and Getting Even teamed for the previous Oak Tree record of $1,576.20 on 
Oct. 23, 1970. BOB MIESZERSKI

At a posh Burbank restaurant Gary Lieberthal, chairman of Columbia Pictures 
Television, was lunching with Jerry Katzman, head of the TV division at the 
William Morris Agency and Ricky Schroeder's agent, the squeaky-clean adolescent 
star from "Silver Spoons." 
</P>
<P>
Just as the waiter served the appetizers, Lieberthal reached into his breast 
pocket and pulled out a million-dollar check made out to Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
"Here," Lieberthal announced as he presented the check to Katzman in a tone 
that suggested a rich uncle giving a quarter to his favorite nephew for a 
lollipop, "is a little something for your client to enjoy himself with." 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal was not being gratuitously generous. "Silver Spoons" ran for four 
years on NBC and raked in $139 million in rerun sales for Columbia. The TV 
executive was simply advancing Schroeder a piece of his net proceeds in the 
show ahead of schedule, a tactic to ensure that the star would remain at the 
studio and help develop another hit on the order of "Silver Spoons." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder stayed at Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
That scene has been played out countless times during the past 18 months in 
lawyers' and agents' offices around Hollywood as Lieberthal has led the 
stampede in bidding up the fees paid to writers and producers of television 
programs. Hollywood in the 1990s resembles Wall Street in the 1980s, and for 
many Columbia is behaving like any number of the big investment banks of that 
period that went on hiring binges, lavished huge salaries on executives and 
spent millions simply to renovate offices for their star recruits. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Pictures in recent years has consistently ranked at the bottom among 
the major Hollywood studios in box-office success. But the highly publicized 
difficulties with its two motion picture divisions have tended to overshadow 
Columbia Pictures Television, an extremely profitable operation that is 
attempting to break out of its conservative mold. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal, with the apparent blessing of Columbia Co-Chairmen Peter Guber and 
Jon Peters, has embarked upon the biggest spending spree in the history of the 
television business, dispensing buckets of money on "hot" writers and producers 
who are perceived to have the magical touch, or the clout, to develop hit 
network shows. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's producers and writers -- in TV, the jobs are basically the same -- 
include many of the biggest names in the TV comedy business: Norman Lear ("All 
in the Family"), Ed. Weinberger ("The Cosby Show"), Hugh Wilson ("WKRP in 
Cincinnati") James L. Brooks ("Mary Tyler More Show"), Norman Steinberg 
("Doctor, Doctor") and the teams of Ron Leavitt and Michael Moye ("Married With 
Children") and Blake Hunter and Marty Cohan ("Who's the Boss"). 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Columbia has begun to recruit producers who specialize in less 
lucrative one-hour dramas as well, such as Bruce Paltrow, John Tinker and Tom 
Fontanta ("St. Elsewhere"), David Milch ("Hill Street Blues"), Frank Lupo 
("A-Team," "Hunter") and Michael Landon ("Highway to Heaven"). 
</P>
<P>
Columbia will not reveal how much it's spending on so-called creative talent. 
But an executive at a rival studio, who has bid on many of the same deals 
pitched by agents, estimates that writers and producers are costing the studio 
$30 million to $35 million annually in overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Since most of the deals are for a minimum of three years, Columbia is committed 
to spend about $100 million simply on writers and producers. 
</P>
<P>
"They've put a lot of money to work," observes Gary Cosay, a partner in Leading 
Artists Agency who negotiated a $33-million renewal deal at Columbia on behalf 
of the comedy writers Leavitt and Moye. "Columbia has got more name people than 
any other studio at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Yet some "A list" producers recruited by Lieberthal to Columbia admit that the 
studio may be doing little more than what any large corporation with deep 
pockets would do when it wants to expand aggressively: buy up market share. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very conservative approach and also one of a well-funded company," 
acknowledges drama producer David Milch, who nonetheless doesn't see talented 
but unknown TV writers getting crowded out among all the heavyweights. "Guys 
like Jim Brooks always have half an eye peeled for newcomers." 
</P>
<P>
For many, however, Columbia is Exhibit A in explaining why Hollywood's costs 
are spiraling out of control. Although rival Walt Disney Co. has also pushed up 
the fees paid to TV producers, Columbia's deals have come to represent the 
high-stakes poker game at its most aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Siegler, president of Columbia Pictures TV, defends the strategy. "Like 
it or not, the marketplace determines the value of these people. You can either 
be on the sidelines and watch or go to the forefront and say: 'If that's the 
game, I intend to win.' " 
</P>
<P>
So far, Columbia has failed to score. It ranks last among the six major studios 
in shows sold to the networks. 
</P>
<P>
"Baby Talk," originally slated on ABC this fall, has been embroiled in lawsuits 
and pushed back until next year, and plans for a CBS series from Norman Lear, 
"Jody Gordon and the News," were abandoned after Lear decided he wanted to 
devote his time to a pet project, "Sunday Dinner." 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have the best year," admits Siegler, who expresses unswerving faith 
in Columbia's strategy. "If you have good people and are doing good work, 
eventually the marketplace will reward you." 
</P>
<P>
Financing for Columbia's NASA-scale program to develop TV shows comes from the 
syndication revenues provided by Columbia's program library, perhaps the most 
valuable catalogue of its kind in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The cash cow at Columbia right now is "Who's the Boss," (originally produced by 
Embassy), which has run on ABC for seven years and generated $417 million so 
far in syndication revenue, the second-highest grossing show in history behind 
"The Cosby Show." 
</P>
<P>
Because of contracts that commit local TV stations to buy additional episodes 
at 10% higher fees, Columbia reaps $62 million for every year after the fifth 
season that "Who's the Boss" stays on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia has another syndication gusher on its hands in the raunchy Fox comedy 
"Married with Children." Despite the criticism leveled at "Married with 
Children" by sponsors and educators, it is likely to become the third-highest 
grossing TV show in history, earning Columbia more than $200 million. Again, 
for each additional year after the fifth season, Columbia will earn another $40 
million in license fees alone. 
</P>
<P>
"If you took away those two shows, we would be making a hell of a lot less 
money and we couldn't operate on the basis that we've been operating," 
Lieberthal admits. 
</P>
<P>
The syndication business, however, is volatile, and past successes are no 
guarantee for the future. How much local TV stations can pay for the reruns of 
old shows depends on unpredictable factors such as the advertising climate and 
supply and demand of syndicated "product." 
</P>
<P>
"Stations are finding they need fewer sitcoms," warns Matt Shapiro, a vice 
president at MMT Sales in New York, which advises local TV stations on which 
shows to buy. "That's because the older ones like "Night Court" and "Cheers" 
have lasted longer than expected and stations can't absorb all the newer ones. 
" 
</P>
<P>
So far, a recent downturn in the syndication market has not seemed to hurt 
Columbia or its ability to achieve record prices for shows. Despite new markets 
for reruns -- cable, foreign broadcasters and others -- Columbia still earns 
more than 80% of its syndication revenue from local TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, we looked to a handful of customers for a majority of our 
dollars," explains Barry Thurston, the pixieish president of the studio's 
syndication division. "Now we are spreading our customer base. Cable is picking 
up the slack where syndication used to be strong." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the money flowing from its library of network half-hour comedies, 
most of which was acquired in Columbia's 1985 purchase of Norman Lear's Embassy 
Communications, there has been little incentive to expand beyond the studio's 
core business of producing prime-time network TV shows. (Embassy-developed 
series have earned $500 million in syndication during the past five years.) 
</P>
<P>
Although studios such as Paramount, Universal and Warner Bros. moved 
successfully and aggressively into producing TV shows for syndication and 
cable, Columbia stubbornly clung to turning out formula shows -- mostly 
half-hour comedies -- a practice that earned it the derisive nickname among 
some producers as "Clonenumbia." 
</P>
<P>
But Alan Levine, the guarded entertainment lawyer brought in last year as chief 
operating officer for the studio, says current management will push Columbia 
into new markets, such as first-run syndication, made-for-TV movies, 
miniseries, basic and pay cable, and international co-ventures. 
</P>
<P>
"The philosophy of the company has changed," he states. "All genres (of 
programs) that make sense will be developed and produced." One new idea: an 
hourlong drama series developed by Milch and internationally co-financed and 
produced with General Motors as a major backer. Another is a late-night soap 
opera, possibly for syndication. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia, since it is owned by a foreign company, is prohibited from buying 
more than a 20% stake in TV stations, although theoretically it could still own 
a broadcast network. That leaves the studio to concentrate on making shows. 
"When I got into this business, there were five channels to watch. Now there 
are 90. It's going to be software," Lieberthal proclaims. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia believes its strategy of recruiting brand-name talent will pay off 
because there is a good chance that at least one of the writer-producers will 
create another hit on the order of "Who's the Boss." But Lieberthal says it 
will take three years to tell. 
</P>
<P>
And if there are no hits? 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal mulls that question for a moment. Then, nodding his head toward the 
window, he laughs. "There will be a lot of expensive parking spaces down 
there."

WILLIAM LYON IS STILL BULLISH ON HOME BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Home buyers are scarce as desert rain clouds, builders' financing sources are 
going the way of the passenger pigeon, and William Lyon Co. is planning for the 
future as zestfully as if it were entering the booming 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Crazy? 
</P>
<P>
Well, a hallmark of Lyon's nearly 40 years in the residential construction 
business is that he's mostly been right. 
</P>
<P>
And Newport Beach-based Lyon, the nation's leading home builder last year in 
sales volume, seems to think this is a great time for a builder who is willing 
to stretch. Lyon is stretching into new fields -- financing and land 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials maintain that there is no significant change going on, but 
industry consultants and fellow developers say Lyon is paving a path that large 
residential firms must follow to survive in an increasingly cash-starved 
market. 
</P>
<P>
For Lyon, whose formula for success includes "constantly adjusting business 
plans to fit changing conditions," the current climate calls for a reduction in 
his own residential construction while quietly shifting focus to finance other 
builders and become increasingly active as a land developer and master planner. 
</P>
<P>
"They are very intelligently capitalizing on their abilities," said real estate 
consultant Alfred Gobar. "They have huge amounts of capital and an excellent 
management, and when you have that, the best risk-reward ratio in residential 
development isn't in building homes, it is in assembling raw land, getting the 
entitlements and selling lots to other builders." 
</P>
<P>
That is true even in a recession -- some would say especially in a recession. 
And while he won't use the "R" word, Lyon acknowledges that his industry is in 
the dumps right now. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question but that there is a slow-up in housing sales," Lyon said 
in a recent interview. "Some of that is public resistance to prices." 
</P>
<P>
The other cause, he said, is that people who have a home they must sell in 
order to move up don't want to lower their own asking price. 
</P>
<P>
The building industry also has been hit hard by the collapse of the savings and 
loan industry, new government regulations on banks' real estate lending and the 
withdrawal of large Japanese banking and development firms from the U.S. real 
estate market. Lyon estimates that "75% of the home building capital in this 
country has gone away, and it won't come back for a long period of time." 
</P>
<P>
But to Lyon that grim landscape is littered with opportunity, not land mines. 
Lyon's company is big enough and wealthy enough to weather the industry cycles 
that regularly break smaller development firms. 
</P>
<P>
So in the midst of a severe housing recession, Lyon is involved in nearly two 
dozen developments on 10,000 acres of land, nearly half of it in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon has been among the industry's leaders for decades. He was one of the first 
home builders, for instance, to recognize that Orange County would be a major 
growth area. From the beginning, he stuck with entry-level homes and apartments 
and made money. 
</P>
<P>
Lots of money. Forbes magazine estimates Lyon's wealth at $350 million. Lyon's 
businesses are privately owned -- top executives collectively own a small 
share, and Lyon and members of his immediate family own the rest. A retired Air 
Force major general, who prefers to be called Gen. Lyon, he lives in a 
22,000-square-foot mansion on 130 acres in Coto de Caza. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon, a fighter pilot in World War II and the Korean War, became a home builder 
in 1954 when he formed Luxury Homes in Fullerton with his brother, Leon. In 
1968, Lyon sold the company to American Standard, the giant plumbing fixtures 
firm, in a deal that enabled him to remain in control of a subsidiary called 
Wm. Lyon Development. In 1972, upset with the direction American Standard was 
taking, he resigned and started William Lyon Co. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of his early financing came from ill-fated Continental Illinois Bank, but 
in 1979 -- as the bank was beginning to show signs of faltering -- he wrenched 
its Florida-based real estate development arm from it in an unfriendly tender 
offer. That acquisition gave Lyon several thousand acres of prime land in 
Southern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon's next expansion move, in 1985, was to acquire 50% interest in Senior 
Corp., a Florida-based real estate investment and development firm formed in 
1980 by creditors of Continental Mortgage Investors, a bankrupt real estate 
investment trust. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon bought out his partner in the $141-million Senior Corp. purchase last year 
and currently is completing the last two Senior Corp. projects -- a 900-acre 
commercial and residential project in Atlanta and a 3,000-acre residential 
community near Denver. 
</P>
<P>
The developer, always looking for deals that would give him land to build on, 
next acquired Pacific Lighting Corp.'s far-flung real estate enterprises in a 
$325-million cash deal in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Lyon corporate culture is a lean one in which executives and managers are 
paid well but required to be out in the field, not holed up in the office. It 
is a reflection of Lyon's credo: "If you want high pay," he has said, "you have 
to be where the risk is, on the playing field, not in the stands keeping 
score." 
</P>
<P>
Lyon has not stuck to one field. Beside home building, he has been involved in 
the aviation industry. From 1981 through 1986, he was co-owner with fellow 
Orange County developer George Argyros of AirCal. They turned the troubled 
airline around and sold it to American Airlines -- each pocketing a $15-million 
profit. He recently formed Air/Lyon, a holding company for aviation service 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
An intensely private man, Lyon comes across as uncomfortable with people he 
doesn't know well. He also is powerful enough to stop most others from talking 
about him for the record. In interview after interview, people asked not to be 
quoted lest they anger Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
One Lyon employee said meetings with him can be painful, with awkward silences 
and stilted conversation. But when Lyon talks about building, a lot of people 
listen. 
</P>
<P>
He says that his companies will continue building homes, and that they will 
continue building the kind of homes they always have -- homes that don't come 
equipped with all the bells and whistles some of his competitors provide, but 
that usually have price tags among the lowest in a given market. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is with people at the lower end of the price range," Lyon said. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon's new developments are being done by a new entity, Lyon Communities. And 
while that company was formed as part of the 67-year-old builder's estate 
planning strategy, its name also is a signal of the direction in which Lyon is 
heading. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than simply buying into large land developers' projects and building and 
selling tracts of homes, as a conventional merchant builder does, Lyon 
Communities is a large land developer. 
</P>
<P>
Its projects include Mountain Gate, a 1,000-acre master-planned community near 
Corona; a proposed 550-acre community in Walnut, the 1,000-home Gordon Ranch 
planned community near San Bernardino and four major communities in south 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
In most of its projects, Lyon Communities will build some of the homes but will 
sell many of the lots to other developers. 
</P>
<P>
The company also will be a major land developer and a financial investor in 
other builders' projects -- and the new development work no longer will be done 
by the William Lyon Co. 
</P>
<P>
That firm has become the holding company for assets that include Lyon-built 
apartments and the commercial and industrial properties Lyon is jointly 
developing with partners like Hughes Investment Co. and Koll Co. 
</P>
<P>
Through its investment division, which manages a $1.5-billion portfolio, the 
William Lyon Co. also has become a big player in residential development 
financing, providing the cash for projects in Orange, Ventura and San Diego 
counties by builders like Warmington Homes, Aikens Development Co. and Lusk Co. 
</P>
<P>
As for Lyon, he is convinced that the California housing market is going to 
rebound. "We'll continue building a tremendous amount of homes, but now we are 
selling property to other builders too." 
</P>
<P>
He predicts another run-up in prices because the supply of housing is 
artificially constricted by government policies at the same time that 
population growth continues in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"In business, as in religion, you have to believe in something," he said in a 
recent speech to developers. "If you are a California builder, you must believe 
that people will continue to come to California, or you will not get to 
heaven."

PRECOCIOUS POODLE PUP TAKES PEN IN PAW TO PESTER PEOPLE WITH POSTAL PAP

<P>
I THOUGHT WE HAD received every conceivable kind of junk mail, but Catherine A. 
Von der Ahe of San Juan Capistrano reports a new one, and it is perhaps the 
ultimate. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of us who have lived at the same address for more than six months, 
Von der Ahe is on many mailing lists. "I have been inundated with junk mail: 
great buys that will never come my way again, pleas for donations to causes I 
have never heard of, wonderful prizes I have won. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
To lighten this avalanche, she decided never to open a letter that did not have 
a 25-cent stamp glued to it. The piece in question did, however, have a stamp 
on it, and she opened it to find what she considers the most improbable offer 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
First, the letter noted that she had been selected for the enclosed free sample 
-- a letter from Coquette, said to be an 18-pound, 10-month-old jet-black 
French poodle. 
</P>
<P>
Von der Ahe read the letter with growing incredulity. It was written in large 
block letters: 
</P>
<P>
"Hi! We haven't met, so let me introduce myself. My name is Coquette (that's 
French) 'cause I'm a French poodle. My hair is very kinkly and jet black. I 
weigh about 18 pounds and when I stand on my hind legs I can put my front paws 
on the dining room table. The two friends that I live with (Blanche and Paul) 
don't really like it when I stand like that at the table -- but I love to, 
especially when they are having my favorite crackers and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how true it is, but I heard the vet telling my friends last time 
I went for 'shots' that we poodles are very intelligent. I guess you have 
(seen) many poodles doing hard tricks on TV or at the circus. I don't do any 
tricks but I play a lot with an old slipper that Paul gave me. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to write again and more next time -- maybe another whole page! 
But this (is) just a 'hello for now' letter. COQUETTE." 
</P>
<P>
The introductory letter advised Von der Ahe that she is "an important member of 
our test group to introduce a letter-of-the-month from her (Coquette) to 
youngsters. Each letter will be personalized by name to the designated young 
person. 
</P>
<P>
"Coquette's letters will relate to boys and girls from 4 to 10 years of age. 
They will be full of puppy antics, growing-up situations, learning to relate to 
humans and neighbor pets, coping with the environment, and especially having 
fun. The letters will also be tastefully inspirational." 
</P>
<P>
The price of this monthly letter (plus a birthday greeting on the child's 
birthday) is $22.50 a month. Suppose they get only 100 subscribers. That's 
$2,250 a month -- not a bad income for a 10-month-old poodle. 
</P>
<P>
However, if that sample letter is typical of those to follow, I'm afraid that 
Blanche and Paul have failed to exploit a golden opportunity. They must have 
gone to a lot of trouble to teach Coquette to write, but all they can coax out 
of her is that utterly childish pap. 
</P>
<P>
If I could have taught my Airedale to write, he would have written something 
like this: 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, kid! Being just a kid, you will probably understand me. We're both treated 
like dogs. Our masters pat us on the head and tell us to be good. They tell us 
when to eat and what to eat. I don't know about you, but I get the same 
disgusting gruel every day. They try to teach me tricks, as if I had no 
dignity. They keep me confined to a small yard when I want to run through the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"They talk to me in baby talk. Or dog talk. I don't know which is worse. When I 
try to express myself with body language or sounds, they tell me, 'Down!' or 
'Quiet!' They obviously think of me as a pet. The only reason they have taught 
me to write is so they can make money off me. 
</P>
<P>
"Worst of all -- and you may not believe this -- they have had me operated on 
so that I am robbed of my sex potential. What right did they have to do that? 
Whatever you do, kid, don't let your parents do that to you. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot in common, and I hope to be hearing from you soon. Blanche and 
Paul will probably read your letter to me. They haven't taught me to read yet. 
They probably don't want me to know that they're spending all the money I'm 
making by writing these letters. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember, kid -- Illegitimati non carborundum !" 
</P>
<P>
We no longer have children in our house, but if I thought we could get a 
straight-from-the shoulder letter like that from a dog, I'd be happy to 
subscribe.

THE JUNGLE IS SO THICK THAT ARTHUR Demarest and the archeological inspector 
assigned to him don't see the army platoon until the comandante is in their 
path, demanding identification. Demarest has plenty: documents from Guatemala's 
History and Anthropology Institute, a gold-sealed letter from National 
Geographic and even a notarized Spanish translation of his Harvard diploma. The 
comandante, whose squadron of full-blooded Mayan Indians appears ominously 
battle-scarred, offers to lead them to the cave they're seeking -- not exactly 
the safest proposition in this guerrilla-infested rain forest, but unavoidable 
under the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
For three hours they follow their machete-wielding guides through the 
amber-green filtered light of the mahogany canopy, their eyes probing the leafy 
ground cover for venomous serpents while scarlet macaws screech overhead. 
Finally they arrive at a large hole in the moist soil, leading into a limestone 
cave. As they descend, their lamps reveal a stretch of stalactites, an altar 
black with burned incense, human bones painted red, ceramic pottery, lithic 
spear points and a cascading stream. There is a noise, and something shoots 
past them; a large tropical rodent called a tepezquintle, a local delicacy. 
Immediately, soldiers aim their automatic M-16s, and everyone screams. The 
inspector drops his camera, breaking it, and Demarest pleads with the 
comandante to stop the firing; pots will be trampled, ricocheting bullets will 
kill them all, the cave will collapse -- and with it his hopes of answering the 
question he is spending more than $1 million to answer. Eventually, the rodent 
disappears, the soldiers hold their fire, and the archeologist, the inspector 
and the artifacts escape unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
IT IS ONE OF HISTORY'S GREAT MYSTERIES. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows for certain where they came from. As for when they arrived in 
Central America, less is presumed now than 20 years ago, because the dating of 
early relics at 2500 BC hinged on faulty carbon-14 data. Assumptions abruptly 
dissolved, leaving the truth buried beneath more than two millennia's worth of 
jungle and alluvium. It is generally agreed, however, that by 900 BC a 
sophisticated culture called Maya had spread across the great lowland limestone 
shelf that today comprises Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, Belize and the northern 
half of Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
It was an elaborate society that must have seemed to its people destined to 
thrive forever. Sixteen-hundred years later, at least 6 million Maya lived in 
what in some ways resembled Southern California: a flourishing megalopolis of 
city-states, with few breaks among their overlapping suburbs. Their monumental 
architecture, as well as their painting, astronomy, mathematics and literature, 
humbled the achievements of their contemporaries in Europe. Equally striking 
and far less understood is how so many could inhabit a tropical rain forest. 
For centuries, they raised their food and families in the same fragile 
environment that today is quickly devastated by a relatively few hungry 
squatters. 
</P>
<P>
What has baffled archeologists even more, however, is the Maya's spectacular, 
sudden collapse. Within just 100 years at the beginning of the 8th Century, 
lowland Mayan civilization simply vanished. In most of the Yucatan, only 
scattered remnants of the population remained; the Peten province that 
encompasses northern Guatemala was left virtually uninhabited. Rain-forest 
vegetation soon overran the ball courts and plazas, enshrouding tall pyramids. 
Except for an occasional vagrant Spanish conquistador, not until the 19th 
Century would the world again be aware of the Maya's existence. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation over what happened to the Maya has included possibilities such as 
famine, epidemics, overpopulation and soil erosion -- yet for each explanation, 
arguments exist against its causing extinction on such a massive scale. 
Although most Mayan cities were notably indefensible, no relics indicate a 
significant invasion of alien forces. Often extolled as history's exemplary 
peaceful society, the Maya seemed least likely to consume themselves in 
internal warfare. Yet Demarest's recent discoveries in the steamy Peten suggest 
that is exactly what happened. 
</P>
<P>
Under the co-sponsorship of Vanderbilt University and the Instituto de 
Antropologia y Historia de Guatemala, one of the most ambitious archeological 
ventures ever assembled has begun a quest for the answer to the Mayan collapse. 
Demarest, its brash 37-year-old director, is a Louisiana Cajun who won an 
international reputation while still a graduate student. Five years ago, he 
declined a Harvard chair considered to be the most distinguished position in 
archeology because Vanderbilt offered him a chance to set up his own 
Mesoamerican department and select a dream project. After barely a year, 
accounts from Guatemala's Peten jungles of his team's findings have evoked 
comparisons to Indiana Jones -- analogies that even he occasionally lets slip 
when confronting yet another pristine cavern laden with ancient Mayan ceramics. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there the resemblance ends. Instead of "Raiders of the Lost Ark," the movie 
that most often comes to Demarest's mind is "The Year of Living Dangerously." 
In Guatemala, guerrillas and the army stalk each other within a few kilometers 
of his excavations, catching in their cross-fire people who still speak 
languages derived from those used for the hieroglyphics his team is decoding. 
</P>
<P>
"Indiana Jones," he says wearily, "swashbuckled through a mythical, generic, 
non-English-speaking Third World of swarthy people with threatening, 
incomprehensible ways, defeating them with American heroics and seizing their 
treasures. But archeology isn't about glittery objects -- it's about their 
context. We're part of the context. It's our workers whose fields are burning; 
it's their children with malaria. We come to study ancient civilization, but we 
end up learning about now." 
</P>
<P>
It is late; the generator in his field camp is off, and he works at his desk 
through the humid night by Coleman lantern, his fingers worrying his thick 
black hair. In the distance, bursts of artillery pierce the steady rumbling of 
howler monkeys. "Indiana Jones would have lasted maybe five seconds here," he 
says. "About the least successful approach to Latin America is pulling a John 
Wayne." 
</P>
<P>
Demarest has come to the Peten to prove his theory that, over 2,000 years, the 
Maya evolved a means of resolving conflicts among nations without destroying 
each others' societies -- but then something went wrong. With an international 
team that includes earth scientists and an assortment of archeological 
specialists, he intends to spend the next five years finding out exactly what. 
</P>
<P>
Besides receiving grants from the National Geographic Society, the National 
Endowment for the Humanities and Alimentos Kerns, a Guatemalan corporation, his 
project has also attracted funding from the Harry Frank Guggenheim Peace 
Foundation and the United States Institute for Peace. In an endless stream of 
grant proposals, Demarest has pointed out that grasping what happened to the 
Maya may reveal why all civilizations seem to rise only to bring themselves 
down -- and perhaps offer clues about how, for once, that might be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
FORTY MINUTES NORTHEAST OF THE ISLAND city of Flores on Guatemala's Lake Peten 
Itxa, a paved road arrives at the fabulous ruins of Tikal, the largest classic 
Mayan site, its white temples soaring 230 feet above the jungle floor. In the 
opposite direction, another road from Flores, decidedly unpaved, leads 
southwest for three miserable hours. Passing through various army checkpoints 
and an occasional guerrilla roadblock, it ends at the scruffy outpost of 
Sayaxche, where a machine-gun emplacement perches atop a Mayan pyramid and 
where no one is up to any particular good. 
</P>
<P>
Sayaxche is on the Rio Pasion -- the Passion River -- which slithers through 
the western Peten to the confluence of the rivers Usamacinta and Salinas, 
together forming Guatemala's border with Mexico. Once the Pasion was a chief 
route for trade in jade, fine pottery, quetzal feathers and jaguar skins. 
Today's traffic includes contraband mahogany and cedar logs, opium from 
Guatemalan highland poppies and looted Mayan artifacts. Down one of its 
sluggish tributaries, motor-driven wooden launches also have recently carried 
quantities of two modest items that in the Peten are veritable luxuries: 
corrugated tin roofing and cases of Spam. 
</P>
<P>
The roofing was for the base camp that Demarest built in a jungle clearing for 
the 23 archeologists and more than 100 workmen he had hired by the end of the 
digging season, which lasts from January to June. The Spam was the most 
recognizable component of their daily sustenance. In just five years, the 
Mesoamerican program Demarest founded at Vanderbilt has attracted brilliant 
archeologists and graduate students capable of translating 1,500-year-old 
hieroglyphics, but none ever conclusively identified the alien green broth that 
regularly passed for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Spam, tin, tools, lab equipment, field library, portable generator, mystery 
meals and some non-inventoried bottles of Scotch had been transported from the 
river on bony mules and horses, their bodies sucked nearly hollow by vampire 
bats. The hike takes three sweltering hours during the relatively dry season. 
When the June torrents commence, it becomes a boot-swallowing wade that 
requires at least twice that long. The dig season supposedly ends with the 
rains, but this year the rains came a month early. 
</P>
<P>
After long, mosquito-rich stretches of strangler vines and palmilla thickets, 
the path climbs a steep escarpment. Giant mahoganies, cedars, ceibas, 
chicle-bearing sapodillas and breadnut trees rise 200 feet from the thin 
tropical soils capping the limestone. Along the escarpment's ragged edge, the 
Maya built cities that Demarest's team has determined once formed an 
interlocking kingdom called the Petexbatun. Only a few years ago, the cities' 
relationship would have been impossible to divine. Breakthroughs in deciphering 
the language carved onto fragments of history that push up through the forest 
floor have changed everything. The area contains no less than seven major 
cities and 230 monuments, and Demarest intends to open them all. 
</P>
<P>
An hour away from the base camp, small mahogany-covered hills emerge on a rise 
between streams cutting through the escarpment. These are actually pyramids, 
built from chunks of local limestone hewn with chert adzes, now being reclaimed 
by the soil. This site, Arroyo de Piedra, is being excavated by a slim, mild 
25-year-old graduate student named David Stuart. The son of National Geographic 
archeologist George Stuart, he spent hours as a child first staring at, then 
drawing Egyptian and Mayan hieroglyphics. At 12 he delivered his first 
professional paper, titled "Observations on the T565 Glyph at Palenque." At 18, 
he became the youngest recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship, for having 
revolutionized Mayan epigraphic interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
Demarest has Stuart digging garbage pits. "He's already an epigrapher. Now 
he'll be a field archeologist, too," Demarest says. Over dinner, Stuart and 
Steve Houston, another world-class glyph wizard Demarest lured to Vanderbilt's 
faculty, fill napkins with symbols. Fifteen years ago, epigraphers realized 
that Mayan glyphs could be phonetic as well as pictorial. Stuart made major 
advances in figuring out how the phonetic symbols connected; he and Houston now 
crack a new connection every few weeks. Their ability to read inscriptions on 
the stelae -- stone monoliths that stand in Mayan ceremonial plazas -- is 
responsible for Demarest's conclusion that, about AD 700, one of the Petexbatun 
city-states began to break the rules of restrained conflict. 
</P>
<P>
At Arroyo de Piedra, Stuart reads the dot-and-bar code that is the date on a 
huge, fallen stela; it corresponds to AD 715. The image is of a local 
chieftain, identified as the son of a vassal to a great lord from another city 
-- evidence that Arroyo de Piedra had fallen under someone else's dominion. The 
lord, whose actual name is yet undeciphered, is known as Ruler 2 of Dos Pilas. 
</P>
<P>
Dos Pilas is where Demarest has spent $100,000 building one of the biggest 
archeological camps ever. The quadrangle of labs, mess hall, storeroom and 
cabins sits just off a plaza shaded by an overgrown knoll. The crumbling 
limestone blocks around its slopes were once a 100-foot-wide staircase; buried 
somewhere inside the thickly forested knoll is Dos Pilas' principal palace. The 
surrounding jungle, filled with chattering toucans and green parrots, is so 
dense that after Dos Pilas was discovered in the 1950s, 17 years passed before 
anyone noticed that a nearby hill was actually a 220-foot pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
Across the grassy plaza, cleared by workmen who play soccer here in the 
afternoons, is a smaller mound. A mossy stela found in front of it shows a 
warrior in a huge headdress, holding a shield and standing on the back of a 
bound human captive. The warrior is Ruler 2 himself; Stuart and Houston have 
concluded that he is probably buried under the mound. With his National 
Geographic benefactors expecting a prime-time TV documentary, Demarest realizes 
that this is the point in his career when he must defer his fascination for 
ancient trash pits and open a royal tomb. When he stumbles back into camp after 
five days of hacking through the ubiquitous red tape in Guatemala City, he 
checks with workers tunneling into the face of the mound: So far, nothing, they 
tell him. 
</P>
<P>
There is other news: Julio Ruana is lost again. "Is the dog with him?" Demarest 
asks. It is -- a relief -- but so is the team of cave specialists who just 
arrived from the United States to see the dog's latest momentous discovery. 
They were due back hours ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ruana lives in Nacimiento, a nearby squatters' village. The settlers are 
Mayan-Kekchi-speaking refugees from the highlands who fled counterinsurgency 
attacks. The doctor whom Demarest brought down, ostensibly as insurance against 
pit vipers, is mainly here to treat Nacimiento's malaria, tuberculosis and 
other woes. The workmen's salaries, at $5 a day high by Guatemalan standards, 
help alleviate malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Ruana is getting paid for getting lost. In two weeks, he has found 
seven caves, usually when his skinny white mongrel, Rapido, chases a 
tepezquintle into holes wide enough for Ruana to squeeze into. That night, when 
the muddy cave team struggles back in, the specialists are awe-struck. Ruana 
never located the cave he originally wanted them to see, but Rapido turned up 
yet another. This one extends for at least two kilometers and is paved with 
hundreds of pots: some four feet high, some covered with ornate polychrome, 
some incised, some with stalagmites growing out of them. 
</P>
<P>
Caves were believed to be passages to the underworld where earth deities dwelt 
and where rain was formed. Against the din of an immense downpour clanging on 
the tin roof, archeologist Jim Brady keeps repeating that he's just entered a 
place where no human being had been for a thousand years, filled with ceramics, 
jade, flint and human remains. "One of the greatest Mayan caves," he marvels, 
wiping clay from his goatee. Over the next few weeks, Ruana finds more new 
grottoes, including one where he thinks he saw wall paintings, rare among the 
Maya, except he lost his flashlight while fleeing a jaguar prowling inside. 
</P>
<P>
Brady, already overwhelmed with the ceramic-filled cornucopia they've dubbed 
Cueva de Sangre, doesn't even want to know any more. Cueva de Sangre also 
contains a lake holding skeletons that might have been sacrifices, a 
speculation strengthened by a nearby cache of carved stingray spines. These 
implements were used in ritual bloodletting, specifically to lacerate the penis 
-- a practice with variations, including circumcision, that appear in many 
parts of the world. The Maya believed that the soul resides in the blood; 
propitiating God with the gift of life was considered necessary to keep the 
calendar turning. 
</P>
<P>
In Mayan iconography, rulers are depicted with their hands under their 
loincloths, scattering droplets. It was Stuart who, at age 15, spotted the link 
that suggested that the droplets were not corn, water or semen but their own 
blood -- and, symbolically, that of their forebears. Sometimes the queens 
joined in the mutilation, pulling a rope through a perforation in their 
tongues. The blood was collected on bark paper, which was then burned to 
release its spirit. With the aid of mushrooms and hallucinogenic enemas, 
royalty would gaze into the smoke and confer with their ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
"Often," Demarest notes, "their ancestors would tell them to go to war." Their 
wars, frequently adhering to astrological cycles, at first impression seem 
singularly grisly. A member of an opposing royal family would be captured, 
ritually bled, and sometimes kept captive and paraded in humiliation for years. 
Eventually, his heart would be ripped out, or he would be decapitated or 
tortured to death. At Dos Pilas, one victim was tightly rolled and bound and 
then used for a game on the ceremonial ball court until his back was broken. 
</P>
<P>
"And yet," Demarest argues, "there was relatively no societal trauma, no 
destruction of fields and buildings or territories taken. It was a way of 
maintaining peace through constant, low-grade warfare that released tensions 
between leaders without endangering the landscape." 
</P>
<P>
The system functioned for centuries throughout the lowlands, until it began to 
break down, first at Dos Pilas. Thus far, Demarest's team knows this: By the 
mid-7th Century, Tikal had entered a profound stagnation. Nearly 50,000 people 
were living there, yet no new monuments had been erected for decades. But 65 
miles away, at Dos Pilas, a new kingdom had adopted Tikal's emblem glyph -- a 
top-knot of hair -- thus laying claim to its heritage. Two wars with Tikal 
followed. After the second led to a great triumph, both were commemorated on an 
elaborate Dos Pilas staircase, its steps richly carved with hieroglyphics. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was a proper ritual war involving no loss of territory. The son of 
the defeated Tikal king ascended to the throne, and Tikal entered a 
renaissance. The Dos Pilas monarch, Ruler 1, also had a son who took over in AD 
690. Under Ruler 2, the influence of Dos Pilas expanded through marriage. His 
sister became the queen of the distant city-state Naranjo and another woman -- 
probably his daughter -- became ensconced at Tamarindito. Stelae began 
appearing in which the artistic flair of local sculptors was replaced by stiff, 
military realism. And one of the stelae now identified Ruler 2 of Dos Pilas as 
the overlord of Tamarindito. 
</P>
<P>
With the advent of Ruler 3, it was apparent that Dos Pilas had become an 
aggressive power. Ruler 3 usurped the important center of Seibal -- a stela in 
Dos Pilas shows him resplendent in jaguar-skin boots, with the forlorn, naked 
king of Seibal helpless under his feet. An exact duplicate was also erected at 
Aguateca, a fortresslike site on a bluff high above Lake Petexbatun, reached by 
a natural bridge over a deep chasm. Stretching even farther, Ruler 3 brought 
back a second wife from Cancuen. The Lady of Cancuen was eventually buried in a 
magnificent tomb, recently opened at Dos Pilas, where she was found with a 
mouthful of jade. 
</P>
<P>
Ruler 4 was the greatest imperialist of all, conquering the entire Petexbatun 
and beyond. He stretched his domain to more than three times the normal size of 
a classic Mayan kingdom. Then, with his unexpected death in AD 760 at the hands 
of rebels from Tamarindito, the empire suddenly imploded. 
</P>
<P>
Rulers 5 and 6 apparently spent their reigns cowering in the isolated safety of 
Aguateca. Seibal was taken over by invaders, whose fine orange pottery 
indicates that they were from somewhere in Mexico. Under their dominion, Seibal 
flourished when everything else had collapsed. Then it, too, was abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
A remarkable archeological find bears witness to the grim ending of Dos Pilas 
itself. After Ruler 4's defeat, the people, who lived in wide, concentric rings 
around the city, erected a village in the middle of the ceremonial plaza. The 
wall they threw up around their compound was made from decorative facing 
materials ripped from Ruler 2's tomb and from the principal palace. It was the 
equivalent of tearing down the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial to 
fortify a tent city on the Capitol Mall. 
</P>
<P>
This defensive barrier, first mapped by Steve Houston in 1986 while working on 
his doctoral dissertation, clinched Demarest's decision to launch his 
exhaustive study at Dos Pilas. The citizens of Dos Pilas, either beyond 
revering or thoroughly outraged by the memory of their greedy former rulers, 
buried the magnificent carved hieroglyphic triumphal staircase so deeply that 
no one knew it existed until almost 2,000 years later, when Vanderbilt graduate 
student Stacey Symonds uncovered it this past season while looking for a gate 
in the wall. 
</P>
<P>
WHY DID THIS HAPPEN? DID THE MOUNTING populations gradually exhaust the land, 
tempting the Petexbatun rulers to seize their neighbors' property -- a move 
leading to a cycle of response that spiraled into total war? 
</P>
<P>
Or did increasing belligerence between cities cause each to abandon vulnerable 
outlying fields and intensify production closer to home, eventually pushing 
land beyond its tolerance? 
</P>
<P>
In the screened field laboratory at Dos Pilas, archeologists wearing faded 
T-shirts from previous digs ("Proyecto Arqueologico el Mesak: Keeping the Dead 
Alive") ponder exponentially expanding piles of clues. Two young Guatemalan 
graduate students, Claudia Wooley and Barbara Arroyo, become dazed poring over 
hundreds of drawings. 
</P>
<P>
Antonia Foias, whose family escaped from Romania 11 years ago, peers at bits of 
cross-hatched polychrome. She never dreamed she'd one day be in the jungles of 
Guatemala, drenched with insect repellent, with more than 1 million pottery 
sherds heaped between her and her doctorate. Over the next five years she will 
work with Ron Bishop, a ceramics specialist Demarest recruited from the 
Smithsonian, identifying trade patterns to verify how much of the imperial 
history recorded on the stelae is accurate and how much is propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Lori Wright and Hector Escobedo argue over whether the human bone 
crumbs he is finding atop a large pyramid indicate sacrifice or cremation. 
Wright's specialty is archeo-osteology, examining bones for telltale scars left 
by specific diseases or for genetic markers that may indicate whether residents 
of different sites were biologically related. She will especially seek evidence 
about nutrition, since changes in diet preceding the collapse would signify a 
break in the pattern of food production. 
</P>
<P>
To know whether war ruined the environment or gradual environmental decline led 
to war, archeologists must first settle an issue that plagues the entire planet 
these days: How could anyone grow food in a tropical rain forest without 
destroying it? 
</P>
<P>
Nick Dunning did his doctoral work in the Yucatan, examining the romantic image 
of Mayan super-managers cultivating an enormous tropical breadbasket. During 
the next several years, Dunning will place thousands of pinches of dirt on 
filter paper, add reagents and, within minutes, determine the dirt's relative 
quantity of phosphates. The simple test reveals soil use: organic refuse such 
as garbage, human feces or mulch mineralizes quickly, leaving identifiable 
phosphate fingerprints of hidden dwellings, kitchen gardens and ancient fields. 
</P>
<P>
Dunning will drive tubes into lake bottoms to extract core samples layered with 
centuries of pollen that drained from the forest and from whatever crops that 
were cultivated. He will train computers to analyze satellite maps of 
vegetative cover, conduct oblique-angle photographic aerial surveys and walk 
transect lines from site to site, sampling along horizontal ribs at least every 
100 meters, to find every field he can. 
</P>
<P>
"We will know what happened in the Petexbatun. It may not be the same 
throughout the lowlands," he adds, which reflects the intelligent diversity of 
Mayan methods he has already observed. On hillsides, the Maya built walls to 
trap rich humus from runoff water in cultivation terraces. Along lakes and 
riverbeds, they dug ditches to drain swamps, heaping the soil they removed to 
create fertile raised fields. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, though, they mimicked the rain forest, providing layers of shade for 
diverse crops. Rows of corn and beans would shade a ground cover of melons and 
squash; fruit trees, in turn, sheltered them, and protective patches of the 
forest itself would be left among fields periodically burned for cultivation. 
</P>
<P>
"Partly, it was a happy accident. Without chain saws, they had to leave the 
biggest trees," Dunning says. That is exactly what hasn't happened at doleful 
Nacimiento. A logging road growing at 30 kilometers per year has reached the 
area; streams of flatbed trailers are carrying away cedar and mahogany and 
knocking everything else down in their way. Dunning and Demarest have explained 
all this to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). 
Their paleo-ecological sleuthing will henceforth also be funded by USAID, with 
something extra to add both more work and satisfaction: a program to teach 
displaced highland Indians the local techniques of their lowland cousins and 
forebears. 
</P>
<P>
ARTHUR DEMAREST STANDS IN THE main plaza of Aguateca, the fortified capital of 
Dos Pilas' late rulers, accompanied by students Stacey Symonds and Takeshi 
Inomata. Symonds shows him a garbage midden filled with corn-grinding metates 
and domestic pottery sherds. Demarest frowns; there shouldn't be a trash pit in 
this spot. Before them is a huge, U-shaped structure with a steep staircase 
leading to the throne where Ruler 4 once sat, fierce in his jaguar skins, and 
received the panting, terrified subjects who had climbed the stairs to bow 
before him. Dunning hasn't ruled out that environmental strains due to 
population pressure might have triggered the Dos Pilas dynasty's hostile land 
grabs, but Demarest is more convinced than ever that it was the other way 
around. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem wasn't too many people," Demarest says. "But society had evolved 
too many elites." 
</P>
<P>
He describes a culture wobbling under the weight of an excess of nobles, all 
requiring quetzal feathers, jade, obsidian, fine chert, fancy corbeled roofs 
and animal furs. In the Petexbatun kingdom, aristocracy was swollen further by 
polygamy: "Too many heirs wanted thrones, or needed some ritual bloodletting to 
confirm their stature. Inevitably, dynastic warfare heightened. 
</P>
<P>
"Any society that depends on growth economics, with elites demanding 
ever-greater levels of material well-being, eventually reaches its limits," he 
says. As more temples need building, a higher caloric demand on workers 
requires more food production. Population rises to ensure enough food 
producers. Constant warfare -- as demonstrated in Aztec, Inca and Chinese 
empires -- also increases population, because rulers require soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
As stakes rise, trade is disrupted and settlement patterns change. Population 
begins to concentrate, something potentially lethal in a rain forest. 
Investment in long-term crops dwindles. Refugees now living behind defensive 
walls farm only adjacent areas, inviting ecological disaster. Their confidence 
in leaders declines with their quality of life. They lose faith. Ritual 
activity ceases. 
</P>
<P>
It is a hypothesis that must be tested rigorously. But at nearby Lake 
Petexbatun, the team has stumbled onto a portent of what Demarest expects to 
find over the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
On a peninsula called Punta de Chimino, a Mayan ruin that Inomata was mapping 
turned out to be a compact fortress city. The peninsula had been severed from 
the mainland by three moats, one cutting so deeply into bedrock that digging it 
required three times the energy used to build the city itself -- "the 
equivalent," Demarest observes, "of spending 75% of a nation's budget on 
defense." This was a society out of control. The spear points imbedded in the 
fortress walls testify to the fate of whoever ended up in Punta de Chimino. 
"When you examine societies just as self-confident as ours, which unraveled and 
were eventually swallowed by the jungle," says Arthur Demarest, "you see that 
we can blow it, too. The balance between ecology and society is exquisitely 
delicate. If something throws that delicate balance off, it all can end." 
</P>
<P>
He stoops and picks a sherd from the moist ground. "Two thousand years later," 
he adds, "people will be squinting over the fragments, trying to find out what 
went wrong." 
</P>

BRILLIANCE, AS IT OFTEN DOES, struck after midnight. This time it struck a guy 
named Dion, Neon Dion, the All-Night Delight, the 2 a.m.-to-6 a.m. deejay on 
KLSX, a Los Angeles oldies station. He was driving to work, listening to his 
own frequency, when a Beatles song came on. The chorus, nonsense syllables he'd 
heard a thousand times, went: 
</P>
<P>
 Ob-la-DI, ob-la-DA. . . . 
</P>
<P>
But Dion is a man of imagination, and this time he did not hear those sounds. 
He heard, to the same cadence: 
</P>
<P>
 Oh Vla-DE, oh Di-VAC. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I pulled over to the side of the road and wrote the song in five minutes," 
Dion says proudly. He hired some musicians to cut the complete parody, which 
ran on his station and even on some local television channels. But now it's a 
new basketball season and time for a change. "We're producing another version," 
he says. "This time there's a flip side in Serbo-Croatian." 
</P>
<P>
Does Magic Johnson have a song named after him? For that matter, did Magic 
Johnson act in a motion picture this summer? Did Schick pay him to shave off 
his beard in a commercial? Was he asked to appear in a segment of a new 
children's TV show? 
</P>
<P>
No, these tributes are falling into the lap of Vlade Divac -- that's VLA-day 
DEE-vats -- the Los Angeles Lakers' 22-year-old, 7-foot-1 center from 
Yugoslavia. As the Lakers return from their Hawaiian training camp this weekend 
to mobilize for the regular season three weeks away, Divac, a tousled-haired, 
soft-eyed giant, is poised to become not only the team's starting center but 
also Southern California's newest sports cult figure. 
</P>
<P>
Statistically, this does not compute. Last season, his first with the Lakers, 
Divac averaged just eight points, seventh-best on the team, and six rebounds a 
game. But numbers explain only part of his charm. 
</P>
<P>
The rest is symbolic. Divac's arrival personifies the rushing 
internationalization of our lives. Innocent, unassuming, lacking everyday 
language skills, the young immigrant plies his trade in the most public of 
workplaces. What Fernando Valenzuela was to the '80s, Divac is to the '90s, a 
mystery from an exotic world, a presence capable of simultaneously enticing 
mainstream fans and people who couldn't care less about sports. Divac with a 
basketball is like a kid with a new toy, a very skilled yet very grateful kid, 
a man-child who can slam-dunk with grit, throw behind-the-back passes with 
grace and laugh with glee. 
</P>
<P>
"Vla-day, Vla-day," fans in the Forum began chanting toward the end of last 
season. One group brought squares of cardboard bearing his initials. Mugs and 
T-shirts emblazoned with his likeness were issued. Posters and basketballs and, 
of course, a sports-shoe endorsement are expected soon. Hanna-Barbera's new 
home-video tribute to the 30th anniversary of "The Flintstones" includes a 
Divac testimonial: "Fred knows basketball." 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't happened, but I expect to see 300 or 400 people at the games wearing 
fake beards," says veteran Orange County basketball coach Alex Omalev, who like 
Divac is of Serbian ancestry and, who was hired by the Lakers as a translator 
during Divac's first month with the team. Divac, who had worn the beard since 
he was 19, began re-growing it the day after he shaved for Schick; it will be 
back by the time the season starts. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the beard, Divac could walk here virtually unrecognized last year. 
"Big change for me," he says, talking about the difference between that first 
summer in Los Angeles and now. "But I am player from Europe, you know, from 
little country, and for me it was very good." 
</P>
<P>
There is more inside him, but he cannot often express it in English. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't have to. 
</P>
<P>
The beauty of the blossoming relationship between Divac and Southern California 
is its purity. He and his fans, with the exception of the region's substantial 
Yugoslav population, speak different languages. So, like tourists on a cruise 
ship, they evaluate each other more deeply, non-verbally, and in the process 
discover more important qualities. 
</P>
<P>
In a game at the Forum last season, Divac dove for a loose ball near the 
sideline and skidded into a teen-age girl, turning over her courtside chair. He 
got up, ran down the court and immediately ran back on a Laker fast-break. He 
took a pass from Magic and slam-dunked the ball, made a wide turn and, on his 
way up the court, extended a hand to touch the girl he'd knocked over. Fans 
remember these gestures. They bespeak compassion in the heat of battle. They 
are more powerful than words. 
</P>
<P>
SOME CHILDREN IN YUGOSLAVIA take English in high school. Divac's wife, Snezana, 
now an aspiring actress, was one. Divac's school didn't offer it; he took 
Russian. Consequently, he has been locked in a frustrating yearlong struggle to 
master one of the world's most inconsistent tongues. He understands a fair 
amount, thanks in part to working with a UCLA tutor last year, but his 
vocabulary is limited. He now chooses not to employ a translator. If you ask 
for an autograph, be prepared to spell your name. If you ask him whether he 
drives to the Forum, don't expect him to grasp the implied distinction between 
driving the car or being a passenger. The long-standing joke on the Lakers is 
that when Vlade says, "No problem," there's a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Divac shows little discomfort when forced to operate in English. His face is a 
study in placidity, except when it is broken by a laugh that starts in the gut, 
rises to the throat and shakes the head heartily. Still, this limitation is 
agonizing for someone who, when he speaks Serbo-Croatian, clearly enjoys 
expressing the subtleties, humor and irony of life -- enjoyment that a new 
language rarely yields. 
</P>
<P>
"That's been the hardest thing," he says one night during the Labor Day weekend 
in a Marina del Rey restaurant. Divac speaks this sentence in Serbo-Croatian. 
It is translated by his closest friend in Los Angeles, George Vucho, 23, who 
came here from Belgrade four years ago to visit cousins in Torrance, stayed and 
now makes a living cleaning carpets. 
</P>
<P>
Divac finishes his thought in English. "I understand so much. I can speak, but 
I maybe know 500 words. . . . I can read, but not yet very good, you know. I 
can read newspaper, but now I read just sports." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who ever ventured into ninth-grade Spanish and found himself gasping for 
nouns after a study-free summer vacation can understand why Divac's English 
deteriorated this summer. 
</P>
<P>
After the Laker season ended prematurely with a second-round playoff loss to 
the Phoenix Suns, Divac returned to Yugoslavia, where, of course, he had no 
reason to speak English. He came back here for a few days, then headed to Maui 
for a vacation with Snezana, where he again spoke no English except for the 
phone call he made to Randy Peskin, who manages his appearances and travel. 
</P>
<P>
Divac needed to tell Peskin that the last-minute hotel reservations Peskin had 
made had fallen through. 
</P>
<P>
"Am on street," Divac said calmly. 
</P>
<P>
"Is everything OK?" Peskin said. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, everything fine, but am on street." 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't you go to your room?" 
</P>
<P>
"No room." 
</P>
<P>
Peskin, a friendly, casual man in his late 30s who is used to these 
conversations, made another call to the hotel, and Divac was allowed to check 
in. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, Divac came back for two days of filming in Beverly Hills. He and 
Snezana played Yugo car dealers in "Autobahn," an American-produced comedy 
about an East German inventor who creates the world's fastest and most 
fuel-efficient car, powered by radishes. Then Divac headed alone back to 
Yugoslavia, where he joined the national team, including fellow NBA player 
Drazen Petrovic of the Portland Trail Blazers. The national team flew to Canada 
to play a couple of exhibition games and then on to Argentina for the World Cup 
basketball tournament. After Yugoslavia won -- making Divac the only Laker who 
could brag that he'd won a championship ring this year -- he was supposed to 
return to Los Angeles and spend a week at a camp for young NBA centers. The 
Lakers regarded this as crucial work in improving Divac's one pronounced 
deficiency: jockeying his feet and frame on defense to gain advantage in the 
"low post," the combat zone near the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Divac never made it. Somebody stole his wallet and passport in Argentina. 
Lacking the document needed to return directly to the United States, he joined 
a Yugoslav diplomat and flew back to Belgrade for the third time in less than 
two months. He got back to Los Angeles a week late. 
</P>
<P>
BUT TO FOCUS ON the nuisances of travel or language is to forget what it means 
to be young. Remember -- or, if you're a teen-ager, anticipate -- the sheer 
freedom of being 22. Now imagine playing with and against men so famous that 
they are heroes even in your distant, basketball-crazed country. Imagine 
succeeding. Imagine, for example, scoring eight points in the final 10 minutes 
of a playoff game against Houston and holding Akeem Olajuwon, arguably the best 
offensive center in basketball, scoreless. Imagine the travel, the adulation, 
the pampering -- your appearances, your investments, all taken care of. 
Imagine, too, that 20 or so of your pals in this strange land are native 
countrymen, buffering you from the chaos typically inflicted on immigrants. 
Imagine, beyond that, that every time you show up at a mall to sign autographs, 
one or two new strangers from Yugoslavia always seem to show up, delighted by 
what you are accomplishing. 
</P>
<P>
English? English will come. Besides, the game is universal. "Basketball words" 
-- pick, cut, switch, weak side, block out -- "I know everything. It's my job. 
I must understand everything," Divac says confidently. This assessment raises 
surprised eyebrows among the Laker hierarchy, particularly since Divac now must 
adjust to the vocabulary of a new head coach, Mike Dunleavy, who is replacing 
Pat Riley, and the loss of recently traded teammate Mark McNamara, who had 
picked up several languages while playing in Europe and served as Divac's 
unofficial interpreter on road trips.. 
</P>
<P>
People who see the beard and hear the deep voice and factor in the maturity of 
Divac's game -- the byproduct of formal coaching in Yugoslavia that started at 
age 12 -- assume he's several years older. To Divac, the opposite is sometimes 
true. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel much young," he says, smiling. "Like 16." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago he was making the equivalent of $12,000 a year playing for 
Partizan Belgrade in the Yugoslav league. Last year, he signed a three-year 
contract with the Lakers that pays him more than $500,000 a year. This season, 
after backing up aging Mychal Thompson at center most of last year, he figures 
to be the Lakers' primary starter, sharing some time with Thompson and newly 
acquired forward-center Sam Perkins. He possesses height, bulk (almost 250 
pounds), quickness, running speed, shooting touch and ball-handling skills, a 
combination rare in a pro basketball player, particularly in a center, a 
position many NBA teams have trouble filling. 
</P>
<P>
But that does not explain the need for a song. 
</P>
<P>
So Neon Dion will try to explain. 
</P>
<P>
"Here," Dion says, with earnestness normally reserved for presidential 
nominating conventions, "is a man who came from a different culture to play 
with guys, predominantly black guys. And to fit in so well -- well, it was like 
finding a missing piece of the puzzle. A family member that'd been sitting on 
the other side of the world. A perfect fit. That turned me on so well." 
</P>
<P>
It is worth noting that Dion is black, and that only the most cynical observers 
have attributed Divac's fan appeal to the Great White Hope syndrome that 
plagues any sport where blacks dominate. "He can play," the veterans say, and 
from the rough outdoor courts at Venice Beach to the polished hardwood of the 
National Basketball Assn., there is no judgment more flattering or vindicating 
that can be made by one's peers -- especially, if not regretfully, in the case 
of a white player in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
And so the odyssey is immortalized, with apologies to John and Paul: 
</P>
<P>
 He came from Yugoslavia to the Forum place 
</P>
<P>
 Successor to the Big Man 
</P>
<P>
 The legend of Kareem staring him in his face 
</P>
<P>
 And the added pressure of the L.A. fans 
</P>
<P>
 Oh Vlade, oh Divac can you do it? 
</P>
<P>
 Can you really pull this off? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh Vlade, oh Divac can you prove it? 
</P>
<P>
 Or is it back to Yugoslav? 
</P>
<P>
 What also turns Dion on so well, what turns a lot of fans on so well, are the 
aesthetic qualities of Divac's game, the speed, the fluidity. To have been a 
Laker fan during the Magic Johnson era is to have witnessed a Zenlike execution 
of fast-break basketball, in which all things -- the players and the ball -- 
move in perfect relationship to each other, all the while moving furiously 
toward the opponent's basket. Laker fans believe that this passionate precision 
between individuals does not happen in other cities. They believe it has never 
happened anywhere. They believe it will never happen again, once Magic, now 31, 
retires. Laker fans know time is their enemy. To find, out of thin air, a 
center with the potential to run the fast break with Magic is akin to the 
appearance of a brother from another planet. 
</P>
<P>
YOU CAN SEE THIS joy reflected inside a J. C. Penney store in Culver City one 
recent Saturday morning. Divac, wearing a dark knit shirt, corduroys and 
loafers without socks, his hair customarily windblown, walks in and heads to 
the back of the store to sign autographs in the sporting-goods section. Barely 
inside, he is stopped, in short order, by Bunky Giles, a clerk who'd met him 
when Divac had shopped there with Snezana, and who now compliments him for 
"sweating bullets" on his English; Donna Brinson, a shopper who hadn't known 
Divac was coming but walks up to graciously thank him for "making the game 
interesting," and Marrca Gravac, another clerk, 22 years removed from 
Yugoslavia, who excitedly chats with him in Serbo-Croatian. 
</P>
<P>
Divac finally makes his way to a line of a few dozen autograph seekers who 
thrust forward souvenirs for him to sign. He extends handshakes to shy children 
and stands up on request for several women who simply want to see how tall he 
is. He is the sole attraction. The Penney chain has hired a number of pro 
athletes in the somewhere-below-superstar category to appear at various 
Southern California stores today. Divac has two more Penney stores to hit this 
afternoon. "I haven't told him yet that after the last one he's got to be a 
judge for the Miller Lite Miss Bikini finals," Peskin says, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Gerard Dypiangco, 25, a sports autograph freak, has come from Montebello. "I 
think he's a special guy," Dypiangco says. "He's funny." 
</P>
<P>
Funny thing. He is. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a jokester," laughed Orlando Woolridge, a couple of weeks before the 
Lakers traded him to the Denver Nuggets last summer. "Vlade used to kill me. 
Coach (Riley) would be getting on him during a game, saying: 'Vlade, you 
understand what I'm saying?' Vlade'd shake his head like he didn't understand. 
Then he'd look over to us and wink." 
</P>
<P>
An example of why Laker fans have not required a dialogue with Divac to fall in 
love with him is a prominent NBA commercial that contains a quick clip of Divac 
on the Laker bench, laughing hysterically with teammate A. C. Green as they 
watch an unseen incident on court. Divac's head rears back, his feet fly up off 
the ground, his head shakes. He is convulsing in delight. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, as in any closed society, the Lakers and Divac have learned each 
other's nature. He has taught many of them Serbo-Croatian phrases. As Divac 
became more comfortable, he allowed himself to be what he is -- an enthusiastic 
kid on one of the NBA's older and most stable teams. 
</P>
<P>
One morning in July, Peskin drove Divac to Orange County to be photographed for 
a sunglasses ad. He told Divac about a teammate who recently played in a golf 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't play golf," Divac said sleepily. 
</P>
<P>
"Five thousand dollars," Peskin said, quoting the celebrity fee the player was 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
"I will learn to play golf," Divac said evenly. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is September. In the Cheesecake Factory in Marina del Rey, a pleasant 
walk from Divac's two-bedroom high-rise apartment overlooking the marina, Divac 
and Vucho are telling Peskin the story about one of their Yugoslav pals here 
who had fallen asleep on his couch, awakened hungry, grabbed a few chocolate 
bars nearby and then discovered that he'd eaten four complete bars of Ex-Lax. 
To make matters worse, his leg was in a cast. Divac and Vucho suggest that 
Peskin, who knows the victim, telephone him and offer a mischievous greeting. 
They teach him how to say, in Serbo-Croatian: "No problem with your diarrhea." 
Peskin later carries out this assignment. 
</P>
<P>
It is 8 p.m. and there is a 90-minute wait for a table, but Peskin, who knows 
the manager, gets Vlade seated immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"Randy is God," Divac jokes. 
</P>
<P>
Peskin reveals that Divac has a new passion that ranks just behind basketball. 
"Mario Bros. Nintendo." 
</P>
<P>
Divac smiles confessionally. "It is the best," he says. "At home I start to 
play one game, I am playing six hours." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, with Vucho, Divac will head for Las Vegas for the first time. No 
credit cards, he says. Just $500 in cash. His wife is "somewhere in Europe," he 
jokes. She has returned to Yugoslavia to complete the acting courses she began 
there. Peskin looks at his watch. "One more hour before Ana starts another 
shopping day," he tells Divac. 
</P>
<P>
This is a comfortable level of fame. You get your table, you get noticedbecause 
of your size, but many people don't know exactly who you are, and only two 
people, a child and a mother, come over for autographs. A middle-aged woman 
seated at a table next to Divac grows curious. She is in "the business," she 
tells him, and presumes he must be, too. 
</P>
<P>
"California?" she says 
</P>
<P>
"No, Yugoslavia," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I may go there soon!" she says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice place," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But the woman, who still doesn't know Divac's name, wants more. She wants to 
know if he is an actor. Peskin tells her straight-faced he is indeed and has 
completed a picture for a major production company. She asks whether people in 
Yugoslavia would know his name. Divac is unflappably polite, even when she 
grabs his arm after he has turned back to his dinner companions. "Ten years 
from now," Vucho says as an aside, watching his friend cope, "he will be the 
same way." 
</P>
<P>
DIVAC IS USED to this sort of thing, not merely the way fans press upon him -- 
he developed his game playing in the rough-and-tumble of European arenas, where 
rival fans throw coins and firecrackers -- but the way external forces make 
life chaotic. What he lacks in the way of a college education he enjoys in 
worldliness. A Yugoslav, like any Eastern European, must know the world. It 
surrounds him. It is not abstract. Yugoslavia is awash in nationalist clashes 
between its republics and surrounded by seven nations that range in 
governmental temperament from xenophobic Albania to volatile Italy. 
International basketball has taken Divac to every continent except Australia, 
he says. "I like geography. I think I know every country in the world. If 
someone from another country plays for my team, I will know where he is from." 
</P>
<P>
Americans, he is reminded, lack both this urgency and interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I know," he says with unspoken regret. It is why he is so proud to be playing 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I play in NBA, I am like ambassador of Yugoslavia," he says. "Los 
Angeles before, nobody hear of Yugoslavia. Now I think much people who look at 
basketball hear of Yugoslavia." 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a fat child. That's the way Divac remembers himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Fat and then. . . ." He whistles and his palms slide toward each other to 
indicate a drastic narrowing. "One year I grew 15 centimeters. I go for 
basketball." Like all natural athletes, he was aware early of his gifts. 
</P>
<P>
The younger of Milenko Divac's two sons, Divac left the small Serbian town of 
Prijepolje at 12 so that he could play basketball on a cadet team in Kraljevo 
in the Ibar Valley, a four-hour train trip. Cadet teams serve as part of 
Yugoslavia's basketball network. By the time he was 16, he had leapfrogged over 
Yugoslavia's junior league and was playing at the highest professional level. 
By 17, he led the Yugoslav Junior Olympic team to a gold medal in the World 
University Games. By 20, he was the starting center on the Yugoslav Olympic 
team, which won a silver medal in the 1988 Games. Like all his medals, it rests 
on a shelf in his family's home. A camera crew showed up at his wedding to 
Snezana last year. The ceremony wound up being shown on Yugoslav television. 
</P>
<P>
Divac is regarded as the most talented of four East Bloc players expected to 
compete in the NBA this year. These players are part of a wave of foreign 
basketball talent that is sweeping into the United States. A newsletter 
compiled by Marty Blake, the NBA's director of scouting, listed 154 foreign 
players from 35 countries, including 18 from Nigeria and 10 from Yugoslavia, 
who competed last season at major colleges. Many of the foreign recruits are 
big, a response to the often-decried lack of quality centers in pro and college 
basketball. Few, however, are pro prospects. For example, a high school 
classmate of Divac's, Milos Babic, was drafted out of Tennessee Tech this 
summer by the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers but is not expected to make the team, 
Blake says. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, drafting low because of their good record, made Divac the 26th 
player picked in the 1989 NBA draft. Other clubs were concerned that he was 
about to be drafted by the Yugoslav military. By the time the Lakers drafted, 
the talent pool was thinner and they took the chance. To get Divac, the Lakers 
had to cut a couple of deals: They had to compensate Divac's Yugoslav club with 
an undisclosed amount of cash, and they agreed that Divac could compete with 
the Yugoslav national team this summer and in the future. That done, the 
Yugoslav government agreed to allow Divac to defer indefinitely his one-year 
obligation to serve in the military. His international play will clash with the 
hesitancy of NBA teams to let their players engage in even domestic exhibitions 
for fear of injury. Yet all parties seem to be committed to this new era of 
internationalism. Divac is sure to play for Yugoslavia in the Olympic Games in 
1992, the same year NBA players will be allowed, for the first time, to compete 
for the U.S. Olympic team. "Yugoslavia is a little country, and everybody likes 
basketball," Divac says. "If I don't play for my national team, everybody be 
sad." 
</P>
<P>
Neon Dion's parody alludes to these dynamics in a down-and-dirtier fashion: 
</P>
<P>
 Happy are they cheering in the Forum place 
</P>
<P>
 Shouting loud and clapping both their hands 
</P>
<P>
 But if he and the Lakers drop out of first place 
</P>
<P>
 Vlade becomes a Yugoslavian army man 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after he first came to Los Angeles, Divac talked about returning home 
after his NBA career. Now he envisions spending winters here and summers there. 
He wants to buy a home on the West Side. He loves to travel. "I have been 
everywhere, but just the arenas. Play, play, play. After career, I will just 
travel. I will see everything." 
</P>
<P>
This is not as easy as it sounds. This summer's travels have created problems 
-- well, call them no-problem problems. First there was the am-on-street 
episode in Hawaii. Then came Argentina and the lost passport and the lost week. 
The Lakers hear about such things only indirectly. Divac's conduit to the 
outside world is often Vucho. Vucho was the first person Divac telephoned from 
New York when he flew here to attend the NBA draft last year. Divac's New 
York-based agent, Marc Fleisher, used Vucho to explain Divac's contract to him. 
</P>
<P>
Vucho is hip. He has the size of a basketball player, 6-foot-4, 190 pounds, 
with the tough-but-tender good looks of a '50s teen idol such as Fabian and the 
street smarts that come from trying to figure out life in America without the 
various cushions enjoyed by his famous friend. Vucho knows, for example, that 
when Vlade goes to the Department of Motor Vehicles to order a vanity license 
plate with his wife's name, the application to ask for is the "environmental 
license plate" form. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a person who sees everything, realizes everything," Vucho says. "It's 
hard to explain. He's someone to love. He is very adjustable. He didn't know 
where the Forum is. One day I take him to the Forum, the next day he'll find 
six shortcuts." 
</P>
<P>
"All the friends I have here from Yugoslavia are good guys," Divac says. "Just 
one bad. George." 
</P>
<P>
Vucho laughs and throws a playful hammerlock around Divac's head. 
</P>
<P>
"Without me, you wouldn't be alive. . . ." he laughs back. 
</P>
<P>
It was Vucho whom Divac telephoned when he realized he wouldn't be able to fly 
back here from Argentina and would have to go back to Yugoslavia instead to 
obtain a temporary visa. Vucho called Peskin. When Divac didn't show up as 
expected for the "Big Man Camp" at Loyola Marymount University, Laker assistant 
general manager Mitch Kupchak phoned Peskin. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a question," Kupchak said with good-natured exasperation. "Can we 
narrow down to a hemisphere, a country, what side of the world -- does anybody 
know where Vlade is?" 
</P>
<P>
"He's at home," Peskin said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but which home?" Kupchak said. "There or here?" 
</P>

And so it is that Randy Peskin and George Vucho roll their eyes and gulp in 
mock horror when Divac talks about full-time traveling. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just too much work for us," Peskin says.

TRACY FONG DESIGNS CHAIRS WITH AN ASIAN FLAVOR AND A SENSE OF HUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
IN A FRESH, new melding of Pacific Rim influences, Southern California designer 
Tracy Fong is recasting a traditional Asian form in an urbane and inviting new 
hybrid that is familiar -- but strikingly futuristic. She updates traditional 
rattan, used for centuries for furniture making in the Orient, by combining it 
with rich woods, leathers and modern geometric shapes. 
</P>
<P>
Two years out of Pasadena's Art Center College of Design, Fong works at the 
family business, Fong Brothers (the longtime L.A. company was called Tropi-Cal 
until it was renamed in January). She designs extraordinary chairs that use 
common materials in decidedly uncommon ways. In her revolutionary Arc chair, an 
ample mahogany base with inverted-pyramid legs joins a metal-framed, 
woven-wicker back. Her burgundy Surabaya chair uses rattan peel (the outside of 
the rattan palm) as a kind of upholstery fabric over foam. 
</P>
<P>
Fong once studied amusement-park design, and her furniture reflects her subtle 
sense of humor. Her Joanne chair, for example, is named for the friend whose 
signature scallop-shaped doodle she used as the basis for a seat design. The 
strength of Fong's work, a daring break from tradition, lies in her chairs' new 
forms -- simple, clean and geometric. At the heart of her work is a painstaking 
craftsman ethic. For Fong and the whole new generation of furniture makers, 
that is the secret -- and most basic -- ingredient. BARBARA THORNBURG

ON THE RECORD: HAYDN TREASURES IN ADVANCE OF THE MOZART BICENTENNIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Next year Mozart will be everybody's favorite composer, or so those in line to 
profit from the upcoming bicentennial -- of Mozart's death, keep in mind -- are 
likely to claim. 
</P>
<P>
Would anything like the bicentennial hoopla, already strongly in evidence, 
eventuate if it were instead a Haydn year? 
</P>
<P>
Not that he has one coming: Papa won't have been dead for 200 years until 2009, 
with these hucksters unlikely to be in attendance. There isn't even a likely 
place for the selling of Haydn: no alluring, mountain-girt Salzburg, only 
humble Eisenstadt with its somewhat down-at-the-heels Esterhazy Palace, in the 
marshlands of flat, far-eastern Austria. 
</P>
<P>
But then they are very different composers, which may be why they admired each 
other so much. Haydn is less tender, inclined to show his learning via musical 
jokes whose humor appeals mostly to other musicians, playing his emotions close 
to the vest. His music, compared to Mozart's, is tightly wound, less expansive. 
</P>
<P>
Then too Haydn is lacking in extra-musical mystique: Unlike Mozart, he had no 
child-prodigy upbringing, no nasty archbishops beating up on him, no sickly 
wife and children over whom to fret, no dire financial or emotional straits, no 
sweating it out as a free-lancer when other composers thrived on noble 
patronage. And no premature death, with burial in an unmarked grave. 
</P>
<P>
In short, nothing to leave to sensation-seeking posterity. His only legacy is 
some of the most influential music ever written -- music fit to be spoken of, 
and listened to, in the same breath as Mozart's -- to muddle the metaphor. The 
most widely accepted works of Haydn are his symphonies, although only a handful 
could be considered popular favorites. Among the hundred-plus extant symphonies 
are six commissioned by a Parisian concert organization in the mid-1780s. 
</P>
<P>
These so-called "Paris" Symphonies -- Nos. 82-87 -- are marvels of energetic, 
incisive wit pierced by shafts of darkness, but without the softening 
wistfulness characteristic of Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
The spirit of these very grand works, three of which carry nicknames more 
imaginative than descriptive, is captured in shapely, dashing performances on 
the Virgin Classics label by London's period-instrument Orchestra of the Age of 
Enlightenment under conductor Sigiswald Kuijken: Nos. 82 ("The Bear"), 83 ("The 
Hen") and 84 on one disc (90793); Nos. 85 ("The Queen of France"), 86 and 87 on 
the other (90844). 
</P>
<P>
Kuijken has modified the severely clipped style that marked his conducting in 
the past while allowing his string players a measure of vibrato previously 
denied them. Agility and wit, with the addition of expansive phrasing that does 
not diminish the works' rhythmic pulse, make these readings among the best of 
an attractive crop of recent Haydn releases. 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Pinnock, leading his English Concert ensemble, tends to present Haydn a 
bit more broadly than Kuijken and some others among his scholarly colleagues, 
but the results remain far removed from the Romantic style. 
</P>
<P>
Pinnock and company offer lucid, vital readings of seven of the so-called 
"Sturm und Drang" symphonies: hugely dramatic, economically constructed works 
of the 1760s and early '70s in which the composer gave genteel music 
conventions a battering from which they would never recover. 
</P>
<P>
On a pair of Deutsche Grammophon Archiv CDs, Pinnock leads Nos. 35, 38, 39 and 
59 ("Fire") (427 661) and Nos. 26 ("Lamentation"), 49 ("The Passion") and 58 
(427 662). 
</P>
<P>
A Haydn treasure that may be overlooked by the casual record shopper can be 
found on the tiny French Astree label, distributed by Harmonia Mundi U.S.A. The 
performers are the Quatuor Mosaiques -- Mosaics Quartet, a name unlikely to 
have universal appeal -- about whose identity, beyond the names of the 
individual players, the annotations offer not a clue. 
</P>
<P>
They deserve better for their handsome interpretations of three of the 
40-year-old Haydn's wonderfully deep and expressive Opus 20 quartets, three of 
which (there are six in all) are presented here: Nos. 2, 3, 4 (Astree 8786). 
</P>
<P>
With Opus 20, the string quartet medium attained equality (at least) with the 
symphony -- at this historical point synonymous with the Haydn symphony -- in 
its potential for depth of expression. 
</P>
<P>
The Mosaic foursome plays them with admirable spirit and precision, producing a 
lovely, steady sound on their superbly matched period instruments -- nothing at 
all like the droopy, whining tones too often tolerated from similar ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
The young Soviet virtuoso Mikhail Pletniev makes a splendid showing in a 
program of three of Haydn's most imposing, still vastly undervalued piano 
sonatas, Nos. 20, 50 and 52 (Virgin Classics 8786) in the usual numbering. The 
bonus is the moody, almost Chopinesque Variations in F minor. 
</P>
<P>
Playing a modern concert grand, Pletniev, who will make his West Coast debut at 
Ambassador Auditorium in February, articulates Haydn's lean, driving phrases 
with terrific verve while shaping the slow movements with a clarity that does 
not preclude sentiment.

ART WORLD: INSPIRATION IN FRAGMENTS: GEYER'S QUAKE-AND-BRAKE SCULPTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
FACES 
</P>
<P>
"I'm intrigued with the process of random occurrence," says George Geyer, who 
often uses his seemingly favorite phrase in the titles of his works, such as 
"Architectural Fragment of Random Occurrence." Fifteen of his new pieces, 
including architecturally and geologically inspired works composed of broken 
glass and granite, are on view through Nov. 4 at Costa Mesa's Works Gallery 
South. 
</P>
<P>
"Your brain can only go so far," says the artist, who randomly breaks his 
materials with a hammer before gluing them back together into finished pieces. 
"If you can remain calm enough to go with that process of random occurrence, to 
go with whatever happens, then maybe you can come up with something innovative, 
more interesting and . . . more human." 
</P>
<P>
Geyer, 55, a trained ceramist who is also currently featured in USC's 
"Forbidden Entry" exhibition with his "Floating Corridor of Forbidden Entry" 
installation, says the ideas for his new works came about as a result of the 
earthquake that rocked Southern California in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost three pieces in that earthquake," says Geyer, who was showing at the 
time in the Works Gallery's Long Beach space. "They crashed and were destroyed, 
and I was devastated, but I thought, rather than just putting them in the 
dumpster, why not just use this and put them back together all broken? So I 
did, and they were more beautiful and interesting than when they weren't 
broken. . . . And they sold immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Geyer says he likes not having any control over how the fragmented works come 
out, but noted that he throws away probably 70% of the glass he works with. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of Geyer's works are broken, however. Some, such as "Double Jeopardy," 
which has two thin, ceiling-high panes of fan-blown moving and bendable glass, 
only appear as if they are about to break. 
</P>
<P>
"I like danger and risk," says Geyer, who also uses art-historical references 
in his work. One such piece is "Floating Red Square on Fragment," in which a 
streaked red clay image is painted onto broken glass. Geyer did the work, he 
says, as a nod to three of his favorite artists: Marcel Duchamp, Josef Albers 
and Kazimir Malevich. 
</P>
<P>
THE SCENE 
</P>
<P>
The swelling local gallery scene gets an important addition on Wednesday when 
Benedicte Saxe Gallery opens at 434 N. Bedford Drive in Beverly Hills with "A 
Tribute to 45 Years of Maeght Graphics." 
</P>
<P>
The gallery is the first U.S. venture for art collector and dealer Adrien 
Maeght, president of France's celebrated Maeght Foundation.Parisian Benedicte 
Saxe will run the gallery and represent the publishing house in California. 
</P>
<P>
Maeght underscored L.A.'s coup in attracting the gallery, saying, "Los Angeles 
was chosen rather than New York because we are more geographically isolated 
from the West Coast. More importantly, the timing was right . . . as Los 
Angeles is quickly developing into a major international art center." 
</P>
<P>
The inaugural show will include limited edition art books illustrated by 
Georges Braque and Alexander Calder, and the premiere U.S. showing of two rare 
ceramic plates by Braque that were commissioned in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
After that show closes Dec. 1, the gallery will present a changing exhibition 
schedule featuring contemporary and modern artists from the Galeries Maeght in 
Paris. The first in the series, "Joan Miro, Engraver," will run Dec. 5 through 
Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Another addition to the local scene is Lace Fine Arts at 657 N. La Cienega 
Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
Formerly the Ankrum Gallery, the space has undergone several months of 
construction and opened last week with an introductory show of a 10-year body 
of work by British landscape painter Richard Beck. 
</P>
<P>
Future shows planned for the gallery include works by Ankrum's New York-based 
artist Bob Kane, and new paintings and watercolors by Morris Broderson. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Boulevard's Space Gallery has expanded into a temporary 
13,000-square-foot, two-floor space adjoining the gallery for a special show, 
"Some Recent Sculpture," which opens Saturday and runs to Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
The extensive exhibition, curated by Josine Ianco-Starrels, features 40 
large-scale works by 16 sculptors from five states. 
</P>
<P>
OVERHEARD 
</P>
<P>
"It's huge!" exclaimed an elderly woman in black-and-white chiffon, commenting 
on the L.A. County Museum of Art's 175-piece "The Fauve Landscape," during its 
recent black-tie opening. "I thought the Annenberg show (featuring 54 
Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings, watercolors and drawings) was 
supposed to be THE big show. But this puts that one to shame!" 
</P>
<P>
DEBUTS 
</P>
<P>
A number of artists have their debut shows in Los Angeles-area galleries this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Among them is the first major gallery show for acclaimed photo-assemblage

Monica's Fred Hoffman Gallery Friday. The show runs through Nov. 17 and is 
presented concurrently with their first full-scale museum survey at the 
Contemporary Arts Center of Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>

painters Jennifer Breeze and Bob Swan, whose two-person show at downtown's 
American Gallery runs today through Nov. 4.; Santa Fe-based painter and 
sculptor Zara Kriegstein, whose works are at Santa Monica's B-1 Gallery through 
Nov. 5; and French conceptual artist Marie Bourget, whose works combining 
photography, sculpture, painting and architecture are on view through Nov. 10 
at Asher/Faure Gallery on Almont Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Others include the first solo exhibition for Texas-born painter David Hines, 
whose "Nightscapes" are on view in Santa Monica at Koplin Gallery through Nov. 
10; the first U.S. gallery showing for Spanish abstract reductivist painter 
Prudencio Irazabal, also at Koplin through Nov. 10; the first commercial 
gallery exhibition for Lake Elsinore-based artist Craig Deines (in a show with 
Bruce Rod) at Santa Monica's John Thomas Gallery Friday through Nov. 17; and 
the introduction of Bay Area clay sculptor Mary Parisi at Beverly Boulevard's 
Daniel Saxon Gallery through Nov. 3. 
</P>

CANDIDATE'S CAMPAIGN IS NO LONGER IN NAME ONLY; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: CONTENDER FOR ASSESSOR'S POST WHO BENEFITED FROM A FAMOUS LAST NAME 
IN THE PRIMARY NOW HAS A WAR CHEST AND ENDORSEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Before the June election, county assessor candidate Kenneth P. Hahn was a 
political novice with little more to his campaign than the same name as a 
popular Los Angeles politician. 
</P>
<P>
But that apparently was enough to propel Hahn -- who is no relation to County 
Supervisor Kenneth F. Hahn -- into a Nov. 6 runoff against incumbent Assessor 
John J. Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Hahn has more than a name to run on for the $130,869-a-year assessor's 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Through Sept. 30, he had raised $45,015 in contributions and kicked in another 
$19,160 of his own money for the campaign, according to reports filed Oct. 5. 
He has hired a professional political consultant. And he has a long list of 
endorsements, including the support of the five other candidates in the June 
primary who with Hahn outpolled Lynch nearly 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Things have changed pretty drastically," said Hahn, an assessor's employee. "I 
feel I can really pull this off." 
</P>
<P>
Lynch, however, has raised $134,334, his latest campaign report shows. And he 
has received lots of endorsements too. He said his campaign is geared to 
getting the word out that his opponent is no relation to the popular supervisor 
-- no easy task in the low-visibility race. 
</P>
<P>
In the official sample ballot sent to 3.5 million county voters, Lynch's 
campaign statement begins: "Warning: John Lynch's opponent, Kenneth P. Hahn, is 
not in any way related to Supervisor Kenneth Hahn." Lynch has been endorsed by 
the supervisor, and in the final days of the campaign plans to flood the radio 
waves with commercials featuring Hahn's endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
Said Supervisor Hahn: "I am honored that anyone can think that my name can 
propel them into an important public office in Los Angeles County without a 
record of their own." 
</P>
<P>
And Lynch said of his opponent: "I don't think he has anything going for him 
other than his name." 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the name did give me an edge in the primary," Hahn said. "But the fact 
is that I am a valid candidate." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County assessor oversees the largest single property-taxing 
jurisdiction in the United States in terms of land value. The assessor's chief 
task is to determine the tax bills for 2.2 million commercial and residential 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
Assessors lost much of their power in 1978 after voters approved Proposition 
13, which allows reappraisal only when ownership changes or structures are 
modified. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Los Angeles County assessor, who oversees a staff of 1,600 and an 
$83-million budget, expects to review about 500,000 properties this year. 
</P>
<P>
The race could take on more importance this year, said candidate Hahn, because 
of redistricting, which the Board of Supervisors is scheduled to take up next 
year regardless of the outcome of pending voting rights litigation. Should the 
board fall short of the four votes required for approval of a new plan, the 
issue will be decided by a committee composed of the assessor, district 
attorney and sheriff. Hahn's election would tip the balance of the committee 
from Republican to Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch said it's much too early to begin considering such scenarios. "No way I'm 
a done deal," he said. "I feel I've done a good job." 
</P>
<P>
In the June primary, Lynch barely finished ahead of Hahn with 29.85% of the 
vote to 28.28%. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch said the fact that nearly 70% of the voters cast ballots for other 
candidates does not suggest that he is doomed. Rather, he contends that voters 
were confused by the four assessor employees appearing on the ballot with the 
word assessor in their job title. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch himself once may have benefited from that ballot designation. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Lynch was a 14-year veteran of the lower ranks of the assessor's 
office who surprised himself by winning election to the job vacated by 
Alexander Pope. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch, 53, did have some things going for him. He was a Republican Party 
activist in the San Fernando Valley who was endorsed by Howard Jarvis. And he 
was one of only two candidates with a campaign pitch in the sample ballot. 
</P>
<P>
But many political analysts suggested at the time that it was the ballot 
designation that identified him as deputy county assessor that made the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
This time Lynch again starts with an advantage. He is far ahead of his 
challenger in fund raising, and he has put together a long list of 
endorsements, ranging from liberal Mayor Tom Bradley to conservative County 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
But he also now carries into the election a reputation as a volatile 
personality who had been unable to solve some of the department's greatest 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
During his first term, Lynch made headlines by throwing county auditors out of 
his office and being accused of assaulting an employee during a heated argument 
over the employee's union activities. Lynch denied the assault allegation. 
</P>
<P>
In ordering auditors out of his office, Lynch contended that an audit was 
unnecessary because it would review only procedures established by his 
predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Los Angeles County Grand Jury conducted a management audit that 
found millions of dollars in billing backlogs. Lynch blamed the backlogs on a 
computer system inherited by his predecessor, and said he has corrected most of 
the problems. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch said his major accomplishment has been "doing work on time and doing it 
right," as evidenced by a reduction in taxpayer appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Taxpayer appeals have declined by 16%, from 13,009 in 1986-1987 to 10,949 in 
1987-88. They increased by less than 1% to 11,021 in 1988-89. Compare that, 
Lynch said, to annual increases of 16% in appeals before he took office. 
</P>
<P>
He said he also kept his 1986 campaign pledge to put regional offices back on 
an eight-hour, five-day-a-week schedule, and he implemented "an earthquake 
disaster back-up system" by placing duplicate assessor records in a vault in 
Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about his record, Lynch produced a letter from County Chief 
Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon commending the assessor's office for 
producing "outstanding, accurate and timely assessment rolls" during the last 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
Anita DeGumbia, president of the Los Angeles chapter of the Institute of 
Property Taxation, an organization of property tax professionals, said of the 
operation of the assessor's office: "It's terrible, absolutely atrocious and it 
never used to be that way. . . . It's frustrating for tax professionals, so you 
can imagine what it does for everyday people." 
</P>
<P>
Lynch said DeGumbia represents an "organization of tax agents who are out for 
special interests who used to have access to the assessor's office. Many are 
ex-employees who went over to the other side and are looking for access to this 
office." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn, 51, is an appraiser specialist who has been in the assessor's office for 
10 years. He joined the county 23 years ago as a social worker.

Before the June election, Hahn had no endorsements and had raised only $3,000. 
But after forcing Lynch into a runoff, money began pouring in. And so did 
endorsements, from former Assessor Alexander Pope and State Board of 
Equalization member Conway Collis to Los Angeles City Council members Richard 
Alatorre, Marvin Braude, Robert Farrell, Joy Picus and Michael Woo. 
</P>
<P>
He also has been endorsed by influential local Latino politicians such as U.S. 
Reps. Edward R. Roybal (D-Los Angeles), Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente), state 
Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) and a smattering of local officials such as 
Monterey Park Mayor Judy Chu, South Pasadena Mayor Evelyn Fierro, Beverly Hills 
City Councilwoman Vicky Reynolds and Los Angeles Board of Education members 
Jackie Goldberg, Julie Korenstein and Rita Walters. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch said Hahn's endorsements come from a handful of Democrats who are backing 
Hahn just because he is a Democrat and Lynch is a Republican. The office is 
officially nonpartisan.

ROBBERY SQUAD TACKLES EX-RAM WITH GLORY OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Using the fictitious offer of a semi-nude modeling job as bait, sheriff's 
deputies found and arrested a former Los Angeles Rams running back on suspicion 
of robbing 18 hotels and motels, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Members of a robbery task force posed as officials of a sports promotional 
company to lure Alonzo Fitzgerald Williams, 28, into the open, telling his 
relatives they were interested in having him pose for a calendar and 
participate in tours in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, Deputy George Ducoulombier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who played briefly for the Rams in 1987, then called back and said he 
"couldn't wait to get started," the deputy added. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was arrested Friday night in Hawthorne and was being held in lieu of 
$430,000 bail on suspicion of committing the string of holdups attributed to a 
man dubbed the "Motel Changer Robber" because he would ask clerks for change of 
a $1 bill before demanding the money in their cash registers. 
</P>
<P>
The robber first struck last March in Lawndale, then victimized 16 other hotels 
and motels -- including Days Inns, Holiday Inns and Ramada Inns -- throughout 
Los Angeles County, and another in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The robber, who always claimed to have a gun in his jacket pocket, never got 
more than $500, Ducoulombier said. 
</P>
<P>
A task force that included police officers from Hawthorne and El Segundo was 
assigned to investigate the crimes and "got a tip that (the robber) was a 
former Los Angeles-based football player," the sheriff's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
That information, Ducoulombier said, eventually pointed them to Williams, a 
12th-round draft choice in 1987 out of Mesa College in Grand Junction, Colo., 
where he rushed for 2,258 yards and scored 26 touchdowns over two seasons, 
earning First-team All-American status in the National Assn. of Intercollegiate 
Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was cut by the Rams after training camp, but rejoined the team for 
three games in the fall when a players' strike sidelined most of the regulars 
in the National Football League. Team records document his participation in at 
least one of the games, at New Orleans on Oct. 4, when he gained nine yards on 
two rushes. 
</P>
<P>
When the burglary task force identified him as a suspect, but was unable to 
find him, members posed as officials and scouts of a fictitious sports 
promotional company and contacted Williams' friends and relatives to explain 
"opportunities available to Williams, including a semi-nude photo calendar," 
according to a Sheriff's Department statement. 
</P>
<P>
"On Friday, Williams called the fictitious company and was very interested," 
the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Claiming they were conducting a "pre-employment interview," the detectives then 
obtained a detailed personal history from Williams that enabled them to find 
him that night at his estranged wife's home in Hawthorne, Ducoulombier said. 
</P>
<P>
With the house surrounded by a Hawthorne Police SWAT team, Williams surrendered 
without incident at 11:30 p.m., the deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the robberies were in areas under Sheriff's Department jurisdiction, 
five in areas covered by the Los Angeles Police Department, three in Inglewood, 
and one each in Downey, Pasadena and La Palma, Ducoulombier said.

GERALD YOSHITOMI'S QUIET REVOLUTION; 
</P>
<P>
THE DIRECTOR OF THE JAPANESE AMERICAN CULTURAL CENTER HAS A LOW-KEY STYLE, BUT 
HE HAS BECOME AN INFLUENTIAL AND POWERFUL FIGURE IN L.A., SACRAMENTO AND 
WASHINGTON. CRITICS ASK: IS HE TOO CAREFUL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gerald Yoshitomi is like the Isamu Noguchi sculpture that rises in the 
sprawling plaza outside his office window: quiet, regal and he commands one 
heck of a lot of territory. 
</P>
<P>
As the executive director of the $14-million Japanese American Cultural and 
Community Center, Yoshitomi heads the largest ethnic cultural center in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
But Yoshitomi's domain extends far beyond Little Tokyo. He is an influential 
figure on both the local and statewide arts scene and is frequently called to 
testify on Capitol Hill -- often about the ubiquitous force of 
multiculturalism. 
</P>
<P>
As such, he has much to say about L.A.'s role in perhaps the most significant 
trend of late 20th Century American art. 
</P>
<P>
"The Los Angeles Festival did not do enough ground work in the ethnic 
communities -- talking about it in advance, having meetings and discussions," 
says Yoshitomi. "One of the issues of the '90s is not just multicultural 
programming, but property rights and control." 
</P>
<P>
As part of Yoshitomi's grand design, the cultural center's "Celebrate 
California" summer series set its own multicultural programming precedent. For 
the first time, the center presented, rather than just renting the stage to, 
artists of a variety of cultural/ethnic backgrounds: performance artist Nobuko 
Miyamoto (one night), African-American dancer/choreographers Donald Byrd and 
Lula Washington (one night) and Luis Valdez's El Teatro Campesino (12 nights). 
</P>
<P>
"Many groups have come to us needing more than a rental situation," says 
Yoshitomi. "We have a responsibility to them because of this stage and 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
"We encourage people to perform here, bringing with them their own aesthetic 
values and perspectives. Japanese Americans would be the last to step in and 
say, 'This is how a Josefina Lopez should write something.' We're not ones to 
try and control someone. Elsewhere (artists) may not have had the freedom or 
the license." 
</P>
<P>
That openness and Yoshitomi's shrewd assessment of the need for cooperation 
between communities have been key to the center's success in its first decade. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that happens when one grows up as a small minority is that 
one needs the help of other people," Yoshitomi explains. "You cannot exist 
without relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"From the time this center opened, it had relationships with other communities. 
One of the first exhibitions here was a Day of the Dead Exhibition with 
Self-Help Graphics. When the theater opened, we opened with Kabuki from the 
National Theatre of Japan, but soon after that we had the Explorations 
performance art series (in partnership with the Museum of Contemporary Art and 
CalArts). 
</P>
<P>
"It's that understanding that we need to have relationships that leads us 
logically into this next part of what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
It's an understanding that the cultural center's board of directors shares. "At 
one time, I was thinking, 'OK, I think this is a good idea, but why does my 
board think it's a good idea?' I recognized that most Japanese Americans grew 
up and have lived in minority communities in Los Angeles. We grew up in places 
that were segregated, because other places we either couldn't afford to live or 
weren't allowed to live. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming from that kind of experience -- where the art that was on my walls was 
not considered art and the singing that my neighbor's uncle down the street did 
was in Spanish and that wasn't considered art either -- (you have) one goal 
that says, 'I want to make sure there is Japanese culture for me and my 
children and grandchildren.' But you also accept the fact that there is 
something else." 
</P>
<P>
Appointed in 1987 by Gov. George Deukmejian to the California Arts Council, the 
42-year-old Yoshitomi also co-chairs Mayor Tom Bradley's task force on the 
future of the Los Angeles Theatre Center -- a key post that confirms his 
influence in the local power infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshitomi also chaired the arts committee of the L.A. 2000 task force, a 
committee of civic leaders who came up with proposals for the city's future. He 
is also a founding member of the Assn. of American Cultures -- a 
Washington-based network for multicultural organizations -- and chair of the 
National Task Force on Presenting and Touring the Performing Arts. He recently 
testified before a congressional oversight committee studying the operations of 
various federal cultural agencies. 
</P>
<P>
All this makes the L.A.-raised and Stanford-educated Yoshitomi one of the most 
powerful men calling the shots for L.A.'s -- and California's -- arts scene. 
Indeed, as a member of an ethnic community currently being courted by both 
political parties and the head of an organization with significant ties to 
Japanese wealth, Yoshitomi has been virtually anointed as point man for '90s 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
An industrious worker with an M.O. that one local presenter discretely 
described as "discrete," Yoshitomi has quietly moved into the driver's seat of 
downtown culture. 
</P>
<P>
Talk to L.A.'s presenters, producers and artists and you hear almost unanimous 
praise for Yoshitomi's professionalism and breadth of knowledge. Nearly as 
often, these same professionals speak off the record, not willing to risk 
appearing critical of such an influential man. 
</P>
<P>
They speak of his "savvy" and "conservatism," the careful way he navigates a 
board room and selects what and what not to put on the agenda at any given 
time. Yoshitomi will push, they say, but never far enough to alienate his base 
of support. 
</P>
<P>
In a decade in which numerous downtown arts venues have failed, floundered or 
been forced out by the vicissitudes of the box office, the Japanese American 
center has thrived. It is the only large-capacity downtown venue that regularly 
presents both visual and performing ethnic-based arts and is one of L.A.'s key 
dance stages. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Yoshitomi is bent on raising the stakes, steering the center into position 
as L.A.'s prepotent multicultural arts venue. With its central location, 
multidisciplinary scope and access to financial resources, certainly no other 
ethnic arts group is as equipped for the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"(Other presenters) are ahead in terms of point of view, but they lack 
resources," says Al Nodal, general manager of the city's Cultural Affairs 
Department. "Jerry has built an organization and now he's folding in the 
programming. Others have kept the torch alive -- albeit at a lower level 
financially -- and that can't be discounted. It's not just money." 
</P>
<P>
The Inner City Cultural Center fits Nodal's description. They pioneered 
cultural diversity in the performing arts 25 years ago, especially with 
respected, non-traditionally cast productions of Shakespeare and Greek plays 
during the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Born out of the Watts riots, Inner City's projects have often confronted the 
status quo. However, critics charge that Yoshitomi's approach may be too 
cautious to effectively challenge the longstanding cultural apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Celebrate California' is an acknowledgement -- at the same time it has to be 
carefully scrutinized," says African-American playwright-performer Keith Antar 
Mason. "I feel a lot of resentment from local artists who belong to this first 
Third World city and who are getting ignored by institutions who are 
(ostensibly) opening up to multiculturalism. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Multiculturalism' is this token phrase. It's not celebrating our 
differences, it's exploiting them -- a case of one step of progress and two 
steps back." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the center's presentation of Teatro Campesino's 1970 work "Soldado 
Razo," but also to other institutions' quest for safe works, Mason said: "I 
think they're blowing it when they go out and get a 20-year-old piece and put 
it in another community's face." 
</P>
<P>
Performance artist Dan Kwong, whose "Boy Story" was recently presented as part 
of the "Fresh Tracks" series in the JACCC's Doizaki Gallery, says the center is 
cautious about what it presents and takes measures to ensure that work isn't 
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
"It was important that the upper administration see a video of my piece so that 
they would not have any great surprises," he says. "They have a rather 
conservative board and constituency. I would definitely say that they tend to 
be mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
Mason is more blunt about it. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to see Meri Danquah's 'Star Spangled Nigger,' you are just 
not going to see it." 
</P>
<P>
Highways co-director Linda Burnham, where Danquah's work was performed earlier 
this year, says there's likely to remain a difference between the kind of work 
the Japanese American center presents and her organization's programming. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the people we're presenting are emerging," she explains. "I would 
imagine (the center) would sit back until they've seen a lot of work from a 
person. I would guess they're looking at people with a greater track record." 
</P>
<P>
An economics major in college, Yoshitomi has a history with cross-cultural 
exchanges. He got his start as a Vista volunteer in Arizona, working with the 
Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) programs, teaching crafts at a community 
college and running arts programs for migrant families sponsored by the Arizona 
Commission on the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, these pursuits lead him to the Santa Fe-based Western States Arts 
Foundation, a nonprofit umbrella organization of 10 state arts agencies. No 
sooner had Yoshitomi worked his way up to vice president and director of 
operations there, then the cultural and community center hired him away in 
1981, at age 33. 
</P>
<P>
Built in phases from 1980-1983, the decade-old center on San Pedro between 2nd 
and 3rd streets includes the six-story Center Building, the George J. Doizaki 
Gallery within the center, the 8,000-square-foot James Irvine Garden, the 
one-acre Noguchi-designed plaza and the 880-seat Japan America Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Launched in 1969 and incorporated as a nonprofit organization in September, 
1971, the Japanese American center project is credited largely to the late 
George J. Doizaki, founder and CEO of American Fish Co. and center president 
from 1973 until his death. Yoshitomi, hired the year before Doizaki died, is 
the center's first executive director. 
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the theater in 1983, the center has fulfilled its 
original mission by programming traditional and contemporary Japanese and 
Japanese-American arts on the main stage, with an annual operating budget of 
about $2 million. They have also rented the stage to a variety of contemporary 
artists and performing groups. 
</P>
<P>
The 1983-1986 "Explorations" series featured avant-garde dance, music, 
performance and theater from such artists as John O'Keefe, Molissa Fenley, 
Meredith Monk, Eric Bogosian, Tim Miller, Paul Dresher, Nancy Buchanan, Squat 
Theatre and others, the majority of whom were non-Asian. 
</P>
<P>
"Celebrate California" isn't the first time Yoshitomi has attempted to forge 
ties with other ethnic communities. In 1986, he helped form the Arts 
Consortium, an alliance inspired by ideas voiced at a 1984 meeting of the 
President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities. Founders of the consortium 
were the JACCC, the California Afro-American Museum in Exposition Park, the 
Craft and Folk Art Museum and Plaza de la Raza. 
</P>
<P>
Hailed as the first such collaboration in the country between ethnic arts 
organizations, the consortium, funded by the W. M. Keck Foundation, published a 
bi-monthly calendar and sought to bolster the audience base and operations of 
the groups involved. 
</P>
<P>
Housed since 1988 at Arts Inc., the current incarnation of the consortium now 
directs, among other projects, a multicultural internship program for young 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Yet while Yoshitomi and current consortium chairman Patrick Ela both call the 
consortium a success, its current low profile suggests that it has succeeded as 
something other than what Yoshitomi had originally envisioned. In fact, 
Yoshitomi left the steering committee a few years ago when he no longer felt he 
had the time to devote to the venture. 
</P>
<P>
Ela, director of the Craft and Folk Art Museum, says the group's initial 
mandate has evolved. "Early on, one of our identity crisis points was the 
question of whether we should be self-serving or altruistic," says Ela. "We 
came down on the side of wanting to serve the broader community." 
</P>
<P>
Yoshitomi tactfully remembered the debate, saying, "The question was that if we 
are a consortium, then what are we going to get -- more members, more grants, 
those kinds of things? That was one of the obvious tensions. The other part of 
it was, groups are very different." 
</P>
<P>
Or it might have been that the consortium's purpose was initially too 
ambiguous. "We'd been in consortiums before -- with Cal Arts and MOCA for the 
Explorations series -- and that made sense, all functioning as presenters," 
Yoshitomi continues. "We knew what that was. This was different -- with a 
community center, a gallery and us as a presenter." 
</P>
<P>
So, perhaps because of lessons learned from both the "Explorations" and 
consortium experiences, "Celebrate California," remains under the control of 
one man and one organization. 
</P>
<P>
Which may be why this program -- as opposed to the consortium -- was relatively 
easy to launch. "We took the need and went to foundations we thought would 
accept the concept -- Hitachi, Wells Fargo and Rockefeller -- and they were 
each supportive of the project," says Yoshitomi. 
</P>
<P>
"The corporations in L.A. are responsive," he continued, when asked to respond 
to statements made by L.A. Festival director Peter Sellars criticizing 
corporate attitudes toward the multicultural arts. "Some have better track 
records than others, but they are recognizing the importance of multicultural 
programming." 
</P>
<P>
However, one local arts administrator remains skeptical, saying corporations 
have yet to prove their willingness to move beyond token allocations to ethnic 
arts organizations. 
</P>
<P>
There have also been pragmatic motives for the JACCC's long-standing 
willingness to make the facilities available to non-Japanese-American artists. 
"We needed the rentals. We needed to keep our crew working," says Yoshitomi. 
"We have a small (fluctuating between 300-500) subscription base." 
</P>
<P>
Still, whatever the incentives, these catholic policies and methods have 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
"The JACCC is one of the rare places in Los Angeles where there are mixed 
audiences," says Yoshitomi. "Audiences that come here are willing to see new 
work. They're not that typical, traditional arts-going audience that wants to 
hear or see the same thing they've seen 10 times before." 
</P>
<P>
It is, says Yoshitomi, a diversity of interest consistent with the cultural 
center's ethos. "This center exists for many reasons," he explains. "One of the 
reasons is so that Japanese-Americans can see work by other Japanese-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, the average non-Japanese American person is not going to 
buy 12 events at the JACCC every year for the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be disappointed if every seat was sold out to a Hispanic or to a 
Japanese American. But in order to do our job right, we have to bring in 
non-Japanese and non-Japanese-American audiences to see work by Japanese 
Americans. We also don't want to get in a situation where we end up with no 
Japanese Americans. Who knows what the mix should be?" 
</P>
<P>
The fact of a mix at all -- and the lack of other competing presenters -- makes 
it that much easier, according to Yoshitomi. "I would love it if there were 10 
other people doing these things," says Yoshitomi, referring both to 
multicultural programming and the support of California artists. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Alexander, artistic director of the nearby California Plaza, does 
present multicultural artists such as the dance group Great Leap (which has 
also been at the center) and the musical group Chatuye, although not subject to 
the demands of box-office faced by a venue such as the Japanese American 
center. 
</P>
<P>
He sees the constraints facing Yoshitomi. "The struggle that we're all facing 
is to reach beyond an inner circle of fans and open up what we're doing to 
other people, to people who are not conditioned to seeing live entertainment 
and, more important, home-grown performance," says Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
"For a variety of reasons, media coverage being one of them, it's hard to let 
people know L.A. is home to some phenomenal performing artists. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to be a particular struggle for the JACCC to broaden what they're 
doing," Alexander continues. "I imagine people make an assumption that the 
JACCC presents Asian-American art and are not expecting to find multicultural 
artists there." 
</P>
<P>
While nearby Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, the Museum of Contemporary 
Art and The Womens' Building also present both visual and performing arts, and 
Los Angeles Theatre Center and California Plaza present multicultural dance, 
music and performance, none of these other downtown venues come near the 
center's means and capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even with the newly oriented activity at the center, in a town such as L.A. 
that has experienced a dramatic reduction in the last half a dozen years of the 
number of available venues, there remains a need for more spaces for dance and 
performance art. 
</P>
<P>
Which is why Yoshitomi has resisted the lure of long-term rentals, saying it 
would only exacerbate the imbalance between available venues and artists 
seeking stages. "The most creative work doesn't fit into the houses 
(institutions) operate or into the administrative structures of those places," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Large amounts of public funds are going into facilities that are not 
presenters," Yoshitomi continues. "So the interesting places -- LACE or 
Highways or other places -- are not viewed as 'legitimate' organizations, but 
the more interesting art is being done there. That's a mismatch of resources. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at the stage where obviously everyone recognizes that there should be 
greater diversity in terms of the work. What we're having now is a discussion 
about who should control that work and whether or not there are singular 
centers of work. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, ironically, Yoshitomi seems to be consolidating his control over L.A.'s 
multicultural landscape. What remains to be seen is how quickly or to what 
extent he will succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there will be a primary multicultural presenter, I don't know if it 
will be (the center)," says the city's Nodal. 
</P>
<P>
"The question becomes: 'Can we do more?' says Yoshitomi. "We're hoping to do 
more and we'll just have to see. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know long term what this means, whether it's five events a year or 
three," he says of the "Celebrate California" program. 
</P>
<P>
"It went well overall. We broke even," he continues. "80% of the people that 
came for Teatro (Campesino) came to the (Japanese American center) for the 
first time. We're going to try and seek further funding for the 'Celebrate 
California' concept -- maybe $50,000-$100,000 in contributed support for next 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Offering an anecdote to illustrate the mandate for multicultural programming at 
the center, Yoshitomi remembers a reception at the JACCC some years back after 
a screening of Luis Valdez's "Corridos" on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
"We scrounged what we could find for the food and we had some sushi and the 
Campesino folks had salsa and chips," he said. "People started dipping the 
sushi into the salsa. Some people on our staff say it put Japanese culture back 
a hundred years, but apparently it was pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
It's a gastronomic detente that provides the metaphor for the cultural scene at 
large, and the center's role in the coming decade. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're really having now is an American culture. Campesino is not Mexican, 
it's Chicano. It comes from that," says Yoshitomi. "We do a lot of work from 
Japan here, but we also do work that is Japanese American. What we're talking 
about is a new sense of what American work is, what art is."

WITH 'MADE IN HOLLYWOOD,' NORMAN AND BRUCE YONOMOTO HOPE TO MAKE THEIR ARTFUL 
TINSELTOWN DREAM COME TRUE

"Everybody believes in the Hollywood dream -- and it's in me too," confesses 
Los Angeles artist Bruce Yonomoto, who's been collaborating on critically 
acclaimed videos with his brother Norman for 14 years. "It's shaped the 
expectations we have, the way we want our faces to look, the way we want our 
lives to be lit with a certain warm, lustrous glow -- it's inescapable." 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood dream, that pervasive mythology that colors much of contemporary 
life, is the subject of the Yonomotos' "Made in Hollywood," which has its L.A. 
premiere at the Museum of Contemporary Art this Saturday in a joint 
presentation with the Long Beach Museum of Art (the piece also screens on 
November 2 as part of the AFI Video Festival). 
</P>
<P>
Their most ambitious production to date, "Made in Hollywood" interweaves an 
encapsulated history of the American film industry with various droll 
observations on modernist myths of creativity, all the while poking fun at the 
consumerism that's become a religion in this country. Commercials for Stater 
Brothers supermarkets -- those laughably lyrical montages of golden wheat 
fields and hugging families -- turn up throughout the piece. 
</P>
<P>
Structured as a soap opera chronicling the travails of Tammy, a sweet country 
lass who follows her dream to Southern California, "Made in Hollywood," which 
stars Mary Woronov, Michael Lerner, Patricia Arquette and Ron Vawter, is a sad 
saga of shattered illusions for some of its characters. For others, it's an 
exercise in adaptability, a lesson in how to salvage the semblance of a dream 
from the scrap heap of popular culture. 
</P>
<P>
Budgeted at $100,000 and jointly financed by Germany's ZDF Television and a 
$20,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, "Made in Hollywood" has 
a polish and a clear narrative line that's new to the Yonomotos' work, and 
they're hoping the piece might serve as an entree into feature filmmaking. The 
Yonomotos may not approve of Hollywood, but they want to be dealt into the game 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Talking with the pair at Bruce Yonomoto's elegant house in the Hollywood Hills, 
the brothers come off as very much like their work -- which is to say, they're 
witty, smart, steeped in media theory, and wickedly cynical about the messages 
the culture is currently feeding us. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood created an international language by clamping down on core parts of 
human experience, and romantic love is the hook media has in most people," 
observes Norman Yonomoto, who at 44 is the older of the two brothers (Bruce is 
41). "It gets into our lives by bombarding us with images of how people relate, 
what love is, what friendship and family are. Obviously, media doesn't create 
the desire for romantic love -- we're born with that because it's tied to 
reproduction -- but media definitely shapes the way that yearning is 
manifested." 
</P>
<P>
"At this point we interact with movies in a behavioral way -- it's a trigger 
mechanism and we respond automatically," adds Bruce, warming to the Yonomotos' 
favorite subject. "Our work tries to shed some light on the manipulation that 
occurs between audiences and film -- the way they make you cry, for instance. 
We're not lampooning those emotional responses, nor do we think people should 
be immune to manipulation. However, they should have a deeper understanding of 
what's taking place, because corporate Hollywood has very cynically 
appropriated these emotional cues and uses them drained of content. Spielberg 
is a master at this. 
</P>
<P>
"Early filmmakers like Eisenstein and Griffith had political agendas," he 
continues. "Granted, they could be reactionary and twisted, but their goal was 
to enlighten. Now the emphasis is on selling products, and that's what 'Made in 
Hollywood' is about. Our film travels through the history of Hollywood and 
comes to the conclusion that commercials are the apotheosis of that history. In 
terms of how much money is spent per minute, commercials cost far more to make 
than films. Moreover, commercials have become the repository for symbols 
representing values that no longer exist in our society." 
</P>
<P>
This is an interesting theory, however, it's based on the assumption that 
people don't want to be manipulated. One could make the case that people don't 
mind it at all as long as it feels good. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the public wants to be manipulated," Norman agrees, "but at the same 
time, viewers are becoming increasingly bored with what's available to them. 
This beautifully constructed Hollywood machine is turning into a dinosaur, and 
it has to adapt. The choices people have as far as number of (TV) channels is 
increasing, but at the same time, the structures, stereotypes and genres of the 
entertainment industry are becoming increasingly narrow." 
</P>
<P>
One could also make the case that criticizing media because of its propensity 
to manipulate hardly seems like late-breaking news; Jean Baudrillard and his 
posse of fellow French theoreticians pretty much mined out this point of view 
over the past decade. Moreover, everything from a kiss to a plate of spaghetti 
can be viewed as a form of manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, this kind of critique of filmmaking and media isn't new," Bruce 
concedes. "Godard, Rohmer and Bunuel all did it in the '50s, and it is 
backtracking in a way. But somebody has to protest and express a demand for 
films that have more going on than the creation of the desire for commodities. 
In the end our motives are selfish -- I don't 
</P>
<P>
want to live my life at this level of consciousness, and want to be presented 
with stimulating material that challenges me." 
</P>
<P>
The Yonomotos' ambivalent obsession with the American Dream as depicted by 
Hollywood makes perfect sense in light of their upbringing. Two of four sons 
born to second-generation Japanese Americans, the Yonomotos recall that their 
childhood was profoundly affected by their mother's having spent three years at 
the Tule Lake internment camp during World War II. Their father was also 
briefly held at a camp, but was released early when he was drafted and sent to 
war (incredibly, the U.S. government drafted many of their Japanese-American 
detainees). Raised in Santa Clara -- an area later to be known as the Silicon 
Valley -- the Yonomotos grew up keenly aware that all was not as promised in 
the land of the free. 
</P>
<P>
"Oddly enough, our parents weren't bitter about what was done to them," Bruce 
recalls. "It was more like they wanted to forget and put it behind them. In 
fact, most of the people we knew who were in camps don't even remember, or 
claim not to. Still, being born right after the war, we encountered plenty of 
racism when we were growing up -- there were only five Japanese in our entire 
school." 
</P>
<P>
"The internment camps did leave our parents with a deep mistrust of 
institutions, and we were taught from the time we were very young to take 
everything that was told us with a grain of salt," adds Norman. "Our parents 
used to take us to church, then when we got home they'd say, 'You know, those 
are beautiful stories, but they're just stories.' We'd visit our grandparents 
and they'd take us to a Buddhist temple, then when we came home my mother would 
say, 'Those are wonderful stories as well, but they too are just stories.' 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we grew up believing completely in the American Dream as 
televised -- which is a desire for commodities, stereo sets and so forth," he 
continues. "We both grew up in front of the T.V. set, and our family just loves 
the movies -- from the time we were babies they were taking us to them. And our 
parents believe in the romantic ideals of films, especially my mother. The 
Nisei (second-generation Japanese Americans) tend to be more American than 
Americans, and our parents encouraged that in us. Because of the war, they 
wanted to negate the Japanese thing as much as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Having had what they describe as "a very liberal upbringing," the Yonomotos 
were interested in art from an early age and after graduating from high school, 
Bruce headed for the University of California at Berkeley, where he studied 
photography, lithography, art theory and Asian studies from 1967 to 1971. 
Norman attended film classes at UCLA from 1964 to 1966, then went on to two 
years of advanced film study at the American Film Institute. Bruce recalls that 
his classes in Asian studies "made me aware that half my education was missing 
-- that I had a European education, but had no knowledge of Japan," so in 1974 
he departed for a year of study in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
In another part of town, Norman graduated from AFI in 1972 deeply 
disillusioned. "When I got out of school I wasn't too happy with what was 
happening in the film industry," he recalls. "There was so much great 
experimental stuff being done in the '60s, but by 1972 the industry was 
evolving into a real conservative corporate structure." 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, Bruce returned from Japan and enrolled at Otis Art Institute "as a way 
of becoming involved in the community," and it was there he discovered video. 
"I'd always been interested in media, so video seemed like the ideal form for 
me, " he recalls. "Nam June Paik was, of course, a big inspiration, and at the 
time the Long Beach Museum had an exceptionally progressive video program. 
Video was an art form with a lot of promise then." 
</P>
<P>
The following year the Yonomotos collaborated on their first piece, a 90-minute 
film called "Garage Sale" about a transvestite named Goldie Glitters who ran 
for homecoming queen of Santa Monica College. While Bruce laughingly dismisses 
the film today, it solidified the brothers' commitment to work together and 
confirmed their feeling that video was the appropriate form for the things they 
wanted to express. 
</P>
<P>
Their first video, "Based on Romance," was completed in 1979, and "An Impotent 
Metaphor" followed in 1980. Here they introduced the themes they've explored in 
all their pieces: the cliches of Freudianism, the illusions of romantic love, 
the schizophrenic marriage of Japanese and American thinking, the tyranny of 
media and its ability to debase reality, and the moth-eaten myths of modernism. 
Subsequent tapes included "Green Card: An American Romance" in 1982, "Spalding 
Gray's Map of L.A." in 1984, "Vault" in 1984, "Kappa" in 1986 and "Blinky" in 
1988. Several of these tapes have been featured in the prestigious Whitney 
Biennial, the Yonomotos have received numerous grants and their work has been 
screened throughout Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Nash, curator of video at the Long Beach Museum of Art, comments that 
"along with Bill Viola, Bruce and Norman are the best video artists in Southern 
California. They've created a form of soap opera perfectly positioned between 
the art world and media culture which offers a sophisticated critique of TV 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
Video art was unofficially launched in 1965, when Korean artist Nam June Paik 
-- widely regarded as the master of the medium -- unveiled a series of seminal 
works. Once hailed as the great hope on the horizon of the art world, video has 
yet to live up to its early promise. 
</P>
<P>
"Video has certainly gone through a transformation in the past few years," 
Bruce observes. "Video artists tend to have very precise agendas, and some of 
the work is quite powerful and instructive, but it's always operated largely 
within the art world and the university system. There was a time when it was 
thought video had the potential to break out of that world into the mainstream, 
but so far it's failed to do that. I'm still interested in video -- largely 
because you can make an art videotape for $20,000, and you can't make much of a 
movie for that -- and I'm thankful this genre exists because it's allowed many 
people, including us, to develop. At the same time, the film world has a 
distribution system and a mainstream critical dialogue that we want to be part 
of now." 
</P>
<P>
"Another reason we're hoping 'Made in Hollywood' might lead to some projects 
with slightly larger budgets," adds Norman, "is that working with extremely low 
budgets leaves you so drained by the nuts-and-bolts demands of making a piece, 
that you don't have any energy left to think about what you're doing. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a handful of producers willing to take a chance on experimental 
filmmakers like Spike Lee and Jim Jarmusch, and we'd like to fit into that 
slot," he continues. "They have modest budgets, but their work addresses a 
mainstream audience and is distributed to reach that audience. However, it's 
not life or death that the next project be a film. It takes so much energy to 
break into the industry that it can take over your life and your work, and we 
don't want that to happen." 
</P>
<P>
While critic Kirby Dick praises "Made in Hollywood" for "revealing video's 
unexploited potential as a force for cultural innovation and critique," this 
piece is very much about biting the hand the Yonomoto's hope will feed them, 
and it seems safe to assume that the industry might be less than cordial to 
their ideas. They claim, however, that their meetings with Hollywood have been 
reasonably friendly. 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly, they just sort of shrug when we show them our work -- and I get the 
impression they want to help us see the light," Bruce laughs. "They don't 
understand what we're doing and usually just say, 'Why did you make this?' " 
</P>
<P>
If they get a green light from Hollywood, the Yonomotos will be the first video 
artists to make the leap to the big screen; should it happen next week, they'll 
be ready to go, as the script for their next project is well under way. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideas about media theory have surfaced in all our work, and with 'Made in 
Hollywood' we basically said everything we want to say on the subject," says 
Norman. "Media theory will always be in our work to a degree, but we're ready 
to examine other issues. The question of modernism -- and the fact that it's 
ending -- seems to be where we're headed next. Authenticity, the myth of the 
Bohemian artist, the idea that you can't copy the master's work but you should 
copy his attitude -- those beliefs are central to modernism and we're writing a 
piece dealing with them. It could possibly be a film, and I believe a 
mainstream audience would respond to a film that dealt with those issues in a 
provocative way." 
</P>
<P>
"If you make it look like a Merchant/Ivory production, there's an audience for 
anything," adds Bruce with a laugh.

'THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW' TRANSFORMED THE MIDNIGHT MOVIE INTO PERFORMANCE 
ART, AND 15 YEARS LATER, THE SHOW'S STILL RUNNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

It has become the ultimate midnight movie, the most successful cult film ever 
made, although it bombed in its initial release. Every Friday and Saturday 
evening, theaters are packed with people dressed as the film's characters. 
Talking back to the screen is not only allowed, it is encouraged. Audiences 
wear newspaper hats, squirt water pistols at each other and throw rice, toast 
and confetti at the screen. 
</P>
<P>
Obscured by such classics as Milos Forman's "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," 
Stanley Kubrick's "Barry Lyndon" and Sidney Lumet's "Dog Day Afternoon" when 
this film was released in 1975, it has outlasted them all. Still playing in 
more than 175 theaters across the country, it has brought in $150 million -- 
with ticket prices scaled $2 to $3 below regular admission -- and boasts more 
than 20,000 members in its fan club. 
</P>
<P>
"It has become something that's an institution," said its producer Lou Adler. 
"It's its own person, its own corporation -- its own everything. 
</P>
<P>
"It" is "The Rocky Horror Picture Show," the wacky, weird musical starring Tim 
Curry as Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a transvestite alien with a penchant for sexy 
underwear, spiked heels and young men. Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick are 
the nerdish couple, Janet and Brad, who happen upon Dr. Frank's castle during a 
rainstorm the very night the annual convention of visitors from the planet 
Transsexual is being held. 
</P>
<P>
The movie was also a smash internationally in such countries as England, 
Australia and Germany. There's even talk that "Rocky Horror" is going to be 
shown in Budapest, Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
"Rocky Horror" will celebrate its 15th anniversary at a big midnight bash at 
20th Century Fox on Oct. 20. And on Nov. 8, CBS/Fox Video will finally release 
the video of "Rocky Horror." 
</P>
<P>
"It's taken on a kind of surreal quality," said Curry. "It won't go away." 
</P>
<P>
What makes the success of "Rocky Horror" even more amazing is the fact that the 
movie tested so poorly as a mainstream film that Fox was going to shelve it. 
Had it not been for Adler, a savvy young publicist at Fox named Tim Deegan, and 
the word-of-mouth of the early fans, "Rocky Horror" probably would be playing 
on cable in the wee hours of the morning -- if at all. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rocky Horror Picture Show" began its life rather inauspiciously 17 years 
ago as a rock opera written by English actor Richard O'Brien, who also plays 
Riff Raff, Dr. Frank's bizarre butler. Originally titled "They Came From Denton 
High," O'Brien changed the name to "The Rocky Horror Show" when it opened at 
London's Royal Court 60-seat Theatre Upstairs for a limited five-week 
engagement. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't like writing a play," said O'Brien, who is now a game show host and 
is overseeing the current revival of the musical on the London stage. "It was 
like working with a collage and putting pieces together, putting sections of 
life together that I liked and had fun with. I always enjoyed and laughed at 
rock 'n' roll, B movies, horror films, camp '40s and '50s entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
Curry thought the play was "pretty terrific" when he read it, he said. "At the 
audition I sang 'Tutti Fruitti,' the Little Richard song, which was prophetic," 
he said, laughing. "I read Frank-N-Furter with a German accent." 
</P>
<P>
"The Rocky Horror Show" proved so popular it moved to the 500-seat King's Road 
Theatre, where it played for seven years. "I think it struck a nerve," said 
O'Brien, "but nobody realized it when it first started. It was a bit of fun." 
</P>
<P>
Film producer Lou Adler was in London to visit his son by actress Britt Ekland, 
and -- at her urging -- went to see the show. Adler and his partner, Michael 
White, were looking for something other than music acts to book into the Roxy, 
the Sunset Strip rock club they owned in Los Angeles. "I hadn't seen a rock 
musical since 'Hair,' " Adler said, "and that was the determining factor in 
bringing it over." 
</P>
<P>
"Rocky Horror" was a smash hit at the Roxy and ran for 10 months. A film 
version was inevitable. "It was just sort of a natural extension of (the 
play)," Adler said. "I wanted to do it from the first moment I saw it. I 
thought it would be an unusual film. How unusual, I had no idea." 
</P>
<P>
Adler invited a few executives from Fox to see the show one evening. The next 
day, Adler signed a deal with the studio to make "The Rocky Horror Picture 
Show." 
</P>
<P>
Filmed in England for less than $1 million, "Rocky Horror" featured several 
cast members from the stage productions -- including Curry, O'Brien and rock 
star Meatloaf. Also cast were Susan Sarandon, who had done several films since 
launching her career in the 1970 "Joe," and Barry Bostwick, who had originated 
the role of Danny in the Broadway production of "Grease." 
</P>
<P>
The film was made in the dead of winter at a studio outside of London. "It was 
cold and there were no toilets," said Bostwick. "I remember walking in mesh 
stockings and five inch-spike heels through the snow trying to find a 
bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
"We were strapped into our high heels," said Curry. "I was running up ladders! 
They used industrial arch supports." 
</P>
<P>
Just before the film's official release, Adler decided to bring the stage 
musical to New York, starring Curry and O'Brien. It bombed. "We had found a 
great hotel with a ballroom and it was right out of another era," said Adler. 
"It would have been perfect for it. But (the owner) had booked two bar mitzvahs 
during the middle of the run and wouldn't cancel them. So we brought it to 
Broadway. We had to deal with the politics of Broadway, the subscription and 
the critics. It was a total stiff." 
</P>
<P>
"We were playing mostly to 200 bewildered nurses who got free tickets," 
recalled Curry. "Maybe they thought they were seeing 'General Hospital on Ice.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
The Broadway fiasco foreshadowed the general public's response to the movie. 
The completed film had a disastrous preview in Santa Barbara when two-thirds of 
the audience walked out. 
</P>
<P>
"Tim Deegan was with the project from the beginning," said Adler. "He sat on 
the curb with me outside the theater in Santa Barbara. The only glimmer of hope 
was that there were four or five people who sat through it and came up after 
the film and thanked us for making that kind of film. We were really happy. It 
was almost like we made it for someone." 
</P>
<P>
"Rocky Horror" did open in regular release at the UA in Westwood on Sept. 26, 
1975. "It did fairly well because it had a reputation and somewhat of a 
following," said Adler. "I don't recall reading many reviews, but there weren't 
many raves, I can tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
The studio didn't know what to do with the movie, and Adler didn't either. "I 
don't think anything would have worked in the beginning," he admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Fox executives decided to test "Rocky Horror" at various college towns, but the 
results weren't much different from Santa Barbara. Deegan, currently an 
independent marketing consultant, was "volunteered" to save the picture. "The 
bizarre logic was that I was young and Lou Adler was sort of a hippie," he 
said. "I saw this guy with long hair and sandals and I reacted to him to better 
than other people." 
</P>
<P>
When Adler asked Deegan what he thought of the film, Deegan told him the truth; 
he didn't like it -- still doesn't. "It wasn't my taste," said Deegan. 
Surprisingly, Adler was pleased with his response. "He said now I could be 
objective about the film." 
</P>
<P>
While Deegan and Adler were trying to save "Rocky Horror," the Nuart started to 
show such midnight movies as "El Topo" and "Pink Flamingos." "The thing about 
the midnight show was there was an ambience," said Deegan. "It didn't matter 
what I was going to see, I would be with my friends. It's a whole different 
world." 
</P>
<P>
The perfect world for "Rocky Horror." 
</P>
<P>
Fox didn't want Deegan to book the film as a midnight movie in Los Angeles or 
New York just in case it failed. "I think they would have preferred a midnight 
screening off the beaten path," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deegan had two requests for Fox: "I wanted one year without pressure from them 
to let it develop its own life and find its own level," he said. "The other 
thing was a $50,000 budget for marketing and publicity. That was a lot of money 
in those days, but they said yes." 
</P>
<P>
Deegan landed a midnight booking at the independently owned Waverly Theater in 
Greenwich Village in New York. Not exactly off the beaten path, but "in those 
days, Greenwich Village was its own separate place," he said, and the owners 
agreed to book the movie for four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Waverly gambit didn't eat up too much of Deegan's budget -- just $64 worth. 
"That covered the suppliers of the theater and a small ad in the Village Voice. 
The whole idea was anti-hype. If you put a picture in a theater and you don't 
hype it and let people discover it, they would promote it by word-of-mouth." 
</P>
<P>
"Rocky Horror" had its midnight unveiling at the Waverly on April Fool's Day in 
1976; Deegan was across the country in Palm Springs. "I didn't want to be 
around the house if someone called," he said. However, curiosity got the best 
of him and he called the manager of the Waverly at 1 a.m. and discovered that 
the first screening had been sold out. "So I came back to town," he said, with 
a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Deegan booked the film in Austin, Tex., and St. Louis, Mo. "The phones 
started ringing at the studio. The exhibition world is very small; they all 
know what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
It was at the Waverly Theater that the audiences started talking back to the 
screen, acting out scenes, bringing props and dressing like the characters. 
</P>
<P>
"What is strange about the film," said Adler, "is that nothing was organized 
and yet the same things that were happening in New York were happening in 
Texas. It was just growing and the film was dictating what was happening. It 
found its own audience." 
</P>
<P>
Curry didn't know about its midnight success until he returned to New York in 
the late '70s to cut a record. He called the Waverly about getting into one of 
the screenings. "The manager said, 'You're the fourth Tim Curry who has called 
today' and hung up. So I went to the cinema with my passport and got in. We sat 
in the audience and people started coming up to me and touching me and 
giggling. I felt like an animal in a zoo. The managerette asked me to leave and 
said, 'You are causing a riot and you are an imposter.' So I left. But I saw it 
again at the Tiffany (in L.A.)." 
</P>
<P>
"The film started a whole new art form," said Bostwick, "a global club of kids. 
I went to a show when it was playing here at the Tiffany on one of the 
anniversaries. I walked through the lobby and saw 15 guys dressed like Brad in 
a tuxedo, cummerbund and tie. I had my picture taken with them. The cast had 
gotten a gold record (of the "Rocky Horror" sound track) and presented it to 
me. So I presented them with a framed and matted pair of underwear I wore in 
the film." 
</P>
<P>
"The picture is so successful because it's a multimedia art experience," said 
Deegan. It's performance art; this is not going to a movie." 
</P>
<P>
For the last 14 years, "Rocky Horror" has been Sal Piro's life and livelihood. 
The 40-year-old former seminarian and New Jersey Catholic high school teacher, 
claims to have seen the film nearly 1,400 times. Not only is he president of 
the fan club, he's emceed the festivities in New York for more than 13 years -- 
first at the Waverly, then for 11 years at the Eighth Street Playhouse and 
currently at the East Side Cinema. Piro can be seen in a brief scene in the 
1980 movie "Fame," which takes place at a "Rocky Horror" screening at the 
Waverly. 
</P>
<P>
"I went with a group of friends and I loved it so much, I just kept going every 
night," Piro said. "I had always been a fan of musicals." 
</P>
<P>
During the first year, Piro and the early regulars started to interact with the 
film. "It was a wonderful feeling," recalled Piro. "We felt we were doing 
something that hadn't been done before. It became a magnificent obsession." 
</P>
<P>
Piro has a great time introducing the "Rocky virgins" -- women who are seeing 
the show for the first time -- and embarrassing them in front of the crowd. "In 
every theater we have had a virgin hunt or virgin roast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As president of the fan club, which is free to members and has been supported 
by Fox since 1985, he also travels around the country for special events. He 
recently published the book, "The Creatures of the Night," about the "Rocky 
Horror" experience. 
</P>
<P>
The current fans, said Piro, span all age groups. Basically, though, "it's a 
young group. The movie is about the loss of innocence. Brad and Janet are like 
babes in the woods. It's a rite of passage for a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
There was a sequel, of sorts, to "Rocky Horror" in 1981 called "Shock 
Treatment," which featured several of the characters from the original. It 
never developed the cult of "Rocky Horror." 
</P>
<P>
Adler said there has always been talk about a true sequel. "The talk has been 
getting more serious," he said. "I think everything has caught up with it. 
There has been such a demand over the years for material. We had the same thing 
around the 10th anniversary. It reaches a much broader audience because of the 
media exposure." 
</P>
<P>
"I would do a sequel any day," said Bostwick. "It was a blast to make." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," said Curry. "Frank died at the end of 'Rocky Horror.' It would 
take an awful lot of money to get back into the gear and arch supports. To hit 
the button . . . to do it again." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, O'Brien is working on a script for the "true" "Rocky Horror" 
sequel. "It's called 'Revenge of the Old Queen,' " he said. "I quite like the 
title." 
</P>
<P>
Adler finally relented this year and gave the green light to the video release 
of "Rocky Horror." 
</P>
<P>
(Rhino Records is releasing a boxed set of four CDs or four cassettes, the most 
comprehensive collection of "Rocky Horror" music available. Included are an 
unedited version of "The Time Warp" and "Once in a While," a love song sung by 
Bostwick that was edited out of the film.) 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of unique release," he said. "There is one day for the stores to 
order it and that is Oct. 25th. The video will be released to stores on Nov. 8 
and then there's a moratorium. It won't be sold after that." 
</P>
<P>
Adler said he had held off releasing the video not just because he thought it 
would hurt the midnight movie business, but because "I didn't know how to use 
it to promote the theaters. So at the beginning of the tape I have made a 
six-minute prologue which was filmed at different theaters in the country and 
shows what is going on in the theaters. The theme behind it is you can dream it 
in your living room, but in order to be it, you have to go to the theater."

THE 'ROCKY HORROR' DRESS-FOR-EXCESS LOOK 
</P>

<P>
Soon there will be two versions of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show": the 
original film that plays at midnight in more than 178 theaters every weekend, 
and its new competition, the videocassette tape that will be released Nov. 8 by 
CBS/Fox video. 
</P>
<P>
If your first experience with "Rocky Horror Picture Show" is watching the video 
at home, you will have missed most of the fun. The film is only half of the 
"Rocky Horror" show; the costume antics of the audience and the props they have 
brought along account for the rest. But you're still in time to be part of what 
is sure to be a new phenomenon: the "Rocky Horror Video Party." All you need to 
know is how to dress and what props to bring. 
</P>
<P>
Dori Hartley of New York is credited with the first look-alike effort. She 
chose to imitate Dr. Frank-N-Furter as a cross-dressing alien. Since her 
pioneer outing there have been countless audience interpretations of the film's 
super-characters -- Dr. Frank, Magenta, Riff Raff and Columbia -- who have the 
best and most costume changes. In supporting costume roles are Brad, Janet, 
Rocky, Dr. Scott, Eddie, and assorted Transylvanian dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Every Saturday night at the Nuart theater in Santa Monica, where "Rocky Horror" 
plays at midnight, a fully costumed live cast gathers to cheerlead the audience 
through their paces. This is the preshow entertainment, and the film does not 
begin without them. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Blane designed the "Rocky Horror" costumes. She did both the original stage 
version in London and two years later designed the costumes for the film. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time they were quite anarchic from a costume point of view," Blane said 
from London, where she recently mounted yet another stage production of "The 
Rocky Horror Picture Show." "To see the body so close and so rough was a 
terrific shock unless you were used to seeing strip shows. . . . Now they don't 
seem so shocking. You see people in the tube (subway) station that look far 
more bizarre and with less clothing." 
</P>
<P>
The fashion trends have caught up with Blane's vision. The costumes the live 
cast wears at the Nuart bear a marked resemblance to clothing you see in the 
clubs around town -- black corsets and bras worn without blouses, rhinestone 
encrusted bustiers, long frock coats and minuscule skirts. Blane was in her 
early twenties when she created the look that would eventually spread to music 
videos and Melrose Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the beginning of glitter rock," she said. "The look was showing up in 
Chelsea and Kings Road. The reason the costumes were a hit is we had picked up 
on something that had just begun." 
</P>
<P>
Blane modestly declines the credit for launching the underwear-as-outerwear 
trend. She insists on sharing her prescient design sense with street 
savvy-London designer Vivienne Westwood. But more than 15 years later, she will 
take the blame. "As I grow up I am a bit alarmed at what I spawned," she said 
ruefully. 
</P>
<P>
Blane estimated she had 90% of the costumes for "Rocky Horror" custom-made. 
Only the clothing in the wedding scene and various undergarments were bought. 
Rabid fans have had to do likewise, sewing their own with occasional trips to 
the secondhand shops to assemble the look. The main ingredients in dressing as 
the flamboyant Dr. Frank are a long cape, corset, bikini underwear, fishnet 
hose, platform shoes, large millimeter pearls (choker length), elbow-length 
gloves without the fingers and scads of eye shadow. Jim Dockery, who plays Dr. 
Frank in the Nuart's cast advises men to have their corsets custom-made. The 
ones available in the lingerie shops all have built-in cups that look deflated 
on a man. Dockery is a "Rocky Horror" costume specialist, he has been playing 
the part of Dr. Frank for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
The hardest elements to locate, said Dockery, are the large pearls and the 
platform shoes, but he's always had good luck finding shoes at local thrift 
shops for about $2. To create his heavy-duty makeup, Dockery said he uses Ultra 
Fair base. For the eye shadow, he mixes the base with Maybelline liquid and 
waterproof eyeliner, "because it won't smear or drip." 
</P>
<P>
All of the stars with major billing wear fishnet hose and high, high heels at 
some point in the film. Another across-the-cast effect is heavy eye makeup. You 
can't go light on the eyeliner. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia and Magenta's costumes combine great fantasy dressing. Magenta gets 
the upstairs French maid regalia -- a short black uniform and frilly white 
apron. Her massive 'do' of dark wavy locks with gray streaks at the temples is 
straight out of "Bride of Frankenstein." 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's costume is show-stopping glitter. Her striped-and-sequinned shorts, 
gold glitter top hat, cropped jacket with tails and red rhinestone bow tie are 
dazzlers. Riff Raff, a hunchback with balding pate surrounded by long wispy 
pale locks, is the ghoul. His costume is a distressed tuxedo with tails, 
fingerless gloves and spats ("winkle pickers," Blane calls them.) The Nuart's 
Riff Raff is played by 22-year-old Greg Seeley, who claims he spends his days 
studying to become a Franciscan monk. Seeley reckons he has about $200 invested 
in his costume. The detail that was the most difficult to find was the spats, 
which he eventually located in a secondhand store on Melrose. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Weiss and Brad Majors spend most the show in their undergarments. She 
emotes in a white underwire bra and matching half-slip with hip-hugging 
panties. Brad wears white jockey shorts and a decorous blue cotton robe. Both 
looks are readily available in most department stores. 
</P>
<P>
The Transylvania family members wear assorted tuxedos with unusual accessories. 
</P>
<P>
Costume style for "Rocky Horror Show" has become classic. Several stage 
versions have been mounted in the last decade. The costumes for these 
productions are usually true to the original movie. Dave Yoder, a Los 
Angeles-based theater producer, has done two productions of "Rocky Horror' -- 
one faithful to the original costuming, the other more futuristic. The show 
with the traditional costuming was a financial success, the other wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Even Blane had to reprise herself for her latest production of "Rocky Horror." 
"A new look at this stage would be commercial suicide," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The costume efforts are consistent from theater to theater, but the dialogue 
and props will vary considerably. This list of must-brings was recommended by 
"The Rocky Horror Picture Show: The Comic Book," published by Caliber Press and 
copyrighted by 20th Century Fox: 
</P>
<P>
Rice is thrown after the newlyweds leave the church. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers are used to shield your head, as Janet does, from the next prop. 
</P>
<P>
Squirt guns are for simulating the thunderstorm. 
</P>
<P>
Flashlights are used during the song "Over at the Frankenstein Place" when the 
verse ". . . there's a light" is sung. 
</P>
<P>
Surgical gloves to snap in unison with Dr. Frank after the creation speech. 
Here, timing is everything. 
</P>
<P>
Party makers are brought to make as much noise as possible after the mad 
doctor's creation speech. 
</P>
<P>
Confetti is thrown to celebrate the newly made Rocky as he accompanies Dr. 
Frank off to the master suite. 
</P>
<P>
Toilet paper, preferably Scott brand, to hurl when Dr. Scott enters the 
laboratory and Brad shouts "Great Scott!" 
</P>
<P>
Toast is for throwing when a toast is offered to absent friends at the dinner 
table scene. 
</P>
<P>
Party hats are worn during the dinner scene. 
</P>
<P>
A bell. When Dr. Frank inquires, "Did you hear a bell?" that's your cue. 
</P>
<P>
Cards are for throwing during the song, "I'm Going Home," when Frank sings, 
"Cards for sorrow, cards for pain." 
</P>

<P>
Don and David Was -- the masterminds behind the avant-pop/funk group Was (Not 
Was) -- were in the studio finishing up their production work on the new Bob 
Dylan album, "Under the Red Sky," when an old friend of Dylan's, poet Allen 
Ginsberg, dropped by. It made a strange meeting of the minds just a little bit 
stranger, but seemed somehow appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"We were gonna finish mixing the album with the convocation of Rabbi Ginsberg," 
David Was remembers. "It was a great moment. It was like three generations of 
Jewish wiseguys in the room." 
</P>
<P>
A little too smart -- or smart-alecky -- for their own good, some would say of 
the Was brothers (who aren't really related). On their own deliciously 
diabolical, soulful records -- the most recent being "Are You Okay?" -- Don and 
David have mixed black comedy with black music, intellectual Jewish Angst with 
visceral dance beats, the urban with the urbane. 
</P>
<P>
Their refusal to "dumb it down" has cost them at times. Viewed as too 
schizophrenic, Was (Not Was) was unceremoniously dropped by its first two 
labels, Island and Geffen, after one record for each. 
</P>
<P>
After signing with Chrysalis in 1988, the group surprised skeptics by producing 
two left-field Top 10 hits ("Walk the Dinosaur" and "Spy in the House of Love") 
off its third album. Yet Was (Not Was) continues to confound pop stations, 
pundits and product managers alike. Now "Are You Okay?" is off to a slow start 
on the charts, despite reviews that have been much more than OK. 
</P>
<P>
Don Was admits that by operating on so many different levels, between the 
inherent incongruities of youth-conscious rhythms and sophisticated themes, the 
band risks alienating all camps at once. 
</P>
<P>
"If I try to take a step back and worry about it, I'll think that, well, it's 
got this dance texture on it so kids are gonna listen to it, but they're gonna 
see that we're talking about different, more grown-up stuff than Bobby Brown 
is, so in the end they'll be put off," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"And then the worry is that adults will hear all this beat stuff and won't be 
able to differentiate between us and 'Yo! MTV Raps,' and we're gonna put off 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
If the album ultimately does a belly-flop into the bargain bins occupied by 
some of its wiseguy predecessors, Don Was won't have to worry about keeping up 
the house payments. He's suddenly become a hot record producer. 
</P>
<P>
He steered Bonnie Raitt -- who was considered a has-been -- back into artistic 
and commercial glory, producing her Grammy-winning "Nick of Time" album. The 
B-52's exploded back into the Top 10 with his production of the single "Love 
Shack." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Dylan co-production with partner David, Don Was also has recordings 
either in the stores or in the works with Paula Abdul, Elton John, Bob Seger, 
the Knack, Michael McDonald, Dion, Leonard Cohen, Ozzy Osbourne, Voice of the 
Beehive, David Crosby and Iggy Pop. (See adjoining story, Page 51.) 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, just about everyone in pop music but Bobby Brown, who might 
want to add his name to Was' long waiting list now before it's entirely too 
late. 
</P>
<P>
David Was is really David Weiss -- the blond, goateed lyricist of the duo, 
prone to quoting obscure philosophical and scientific texts and puns in nearly 
equal measure; former jazz critic for the Los Angeles Herald Examiner and golf 
editor for City Sports, aspiring screenwriter, student of classical Greek, reed 
and keyboard player and crazed monologuist. 
</P>
<P>
He's the one who does the spoken-word raps like "Dad I'm in Jail," "Earth to 
Doris" and the new single "I Feel Better Than James Brown," usually in a 
sarcastic, tortured voice that sounds like a Beat Generation Bob Hope on acid. 
</P>
<P>
Don Was is in fact Don Fagenson -- the dark-haired, shades-wearing composer and 
bassist, the quietly confident studio whiz who reins in some of his partner's 
outermost instincts with tight, sharp melodies, a student of every sort of pop 
craftsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
These two have been collaborating ever since they met nearly three decades ago 
as junior high kids in Detroit, sharing a love while growing up of Dylan, the 
Mothers of Invention, John Coltrane and musical bourgeoisie-bashing in general. 
</P>
<P>
Says David, "I'd like to think that it's where Don and I meet . . . somewhere 
in the middle . . . that his more savvy instincts about what works meet my 
instincts of throwing in some element that shouldn't be there, and that our 
happy medium is where his smarts and my idiocy create a spark. 
</P>
<P>
"Although I've always held close my role as fly in the ointment, and realized 
that without Don being the ointment we'd have nothing to sell whatsoever, the 
fact is, if you unleash this guy, he is the ultimate pop ironist. He'll join 
two styles together faster than Wolfgang Puck can put raw chicken on a pizza." 
</P>
<P>
So though David publicly accused Don recently of having production instincts 
that are "embarrassingly commercial," he does approve of his partner's 
utilitarian indulgence in passing fads -- all the way down to the current 
album's "new jack swing" rhythms, which are popularly associated with, yes, 
Bobby Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"I borrow from a more highbrow culture T.S. Eliot's quote about how it's better 
to steal than to imitate," David says, "which I think in part was meant to 
explain why he ripped off passages from Homer and put them into 'The 
Wasteland.' And in a way I believe that if someone has said something well, it 
doesn't always pay to change it. 
</P>
<P>
"And pop music being as disposable as it is, I believe you're basically 
spitting in the wind of posterity and eternity anyway. You've got to hold 
yourself out to the moment. The moment is your mistress. 
</P>
<P>
"And if that means hewing to a certain beat, a beat that happens to be on the 
radio all the time, I tell you the truth, I'm married to the greatest groove 
thief in the Western world." 
</P>
<P>
Was (Not Was)'s origins, in fact, were with Don's excursions as an urban 
anthropologist into the dance clubs of Detroit, going out with a blaster tape 
recorder "to bag a couple of new grooves like some kind of disco Alan Lomax," 
says David. 
</P>
<P>
The rhythms he'd come back with were both fresh and floor-tested. Pop on a bass 
line, a paranoid lyric and a horn section using Middle Eastern modality -- and 
perhaps, in those pre-sampling days, a tape of, say, Reagan's State of the 
Union Address -- and you had seminal Was (Not Was). 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning we were radical dance music-makers because we were stealing 
fresh stuff and putting our own icing on it -- which I guess is the same crime 
you could accuse the Rolling Stones of, or Elvis. Maybe a little more 
perversely; I mean, we were turning rabbits into monsters." 
</P>
<P>
Was (Not Was) has employed such guest vocalists as Ozzy Osbourne, Mel Torme, 
Leonard Cohen and Frank Sinatra Jr. to sing those monstrous lyrics, but the 
main mouthpieces have always been Sir Harry Bowens (formerly of the O'Jays) and 
Sweet Pea Atkinson -- genuine vintage Detroit R&amp;B singers giving voice to 
the sorts of sentiments you're not likely to ever hear on black radio, or any 
kind of radio. 
</P>
<P>
If the lyrics often have a certain irony to begin with, the honest intensity 
and purity with which they're delivered by the two lead singers only heighten 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times I begin to write a song and know it's so far-fetched that when 
it's brought back down to Earth and delivered earnestly, that's when it'll 
acquire its charge," David says. 
</P>
<P>
"When I wrote 'I Blew Up the United States,' I knew you could let the bile drip 
and the spittle spew and just be another white punk screaming without a voice 
and sounding disturbing. But if you wrote a supple groove and put one of these 
soul men on it, it would sound like the perfect thing to do with a Sunday 
afternoon is go blow up the nation." 
</P>
<P>
Don is a major contributor to the irony as well, often applying the most 
cheerful melodies to the saddest lyrics. Even David was surprised when he 
turned in the words to "Maria Navarro" -- based on a news story about an East 
L.A. woman murdered by her husband after failing to persuade a 911 operator to 
dispatch a patrol car -- expecting a sorrowful ballad to come out of it. 
</P>
<P>
Later he was startled to find that Don had applied a definitive hip-hop beat to 
it, and David felt that dancing to someone else's tragedy might be out of even 
his off-center sphere of reference. 
</P>
<P>
The sense of subversiveness inherent in sneaking honest political or complex 
emotional nuggets into a slick, frothy pop-soul song isn't always intentional. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not so much like a deliberate Trojan horse thing," Don claims. "I like to 
go to clubs, I like dance music. It's just another part of our vocabulary. The 
band was always built on that." 
</P>
<P>
And some songs are just legitimately silly. 
</P>
<P>
Says David, "With an hour's worth of music on a CD, you can put a scalpel 
inside your head and come up with a cross-section of a day's consciousness, 
like Joyce did in 'Ulysses.' 
</P>
<P>
"And part of you is just some heathen meat-eater concerned about your own 
survival, and another part of you is a fantasist, and another part of you is a 
bleeding-heart liberal responding to Maria Navarro, and another part of you is 
casting a jaundiced eye on modern romance. It's all part of the makeup of a 
normal day." 
</P>
<P>
At least when that was the day that Was. 
</P>
<P>
A normal day now is a day in which Don Was and David Was don't see each other. 
Don's production jobs are stacked up more than La Guardia in a blizzard, which 
gives David time to concentrate on the reason he first moved out to Los Angeles 
from Detroit: the film business. 
</P>
<P>
He's now developing a fact-based script for a major studio that he describes as 
"Ozzy Osbourne meets Francois Truffaut -- a coming of age heavy-metal picture." 
He will also act in and contribute music to a jazz-oriented movie that director 
Robert Altman will begin soon. (Both Wases appeared in "The Freshman," backing 
up Bert Parks on a unique interpretation of Dylan's "Maggie's Farm.") 
</P>
<P>
And Chrysalis has given him the go-ahead to make a solo album that will 
presumably take off from some of Was (Not Was)'s odder moments and go even 
deeper into space. His ultimate aspiration, he says with tongue only partially 
in cheek, is to fill the gaping niche now available for an American Luis 
Bunuel. 
</P>
<P>
"Don has found his bigger canvas, and in a way, the canvas he always wanted to 
be painting on -- just being a record-maker," David says. "It's a bit of fairy 
tale, and a bit of very inspiring go-get-'em American spirit. He put a football 
under one arm and a machine-gun under the other and just ran for the goal 
posts. 
</P>
<P>
"And I definitely need my own canvas too," adds David, whose ultimate hope is 
to add a great American play to his resume. "Was (Not Was) is a great thing to 
have, but I can't pretend it's all I want to do. I think if you have any 
pretensions about being a writer -- which in the end might be all I have -- 
that writing pop songs is like driving bump-'em cars at the carnival, compared 
to going out on the Indianapolis raceway. 
</P>
<P>
"Writing is a man's work, no sexism intended. I think a boy can write a pop 
song. Not that men haven't written great ones, but I can't see myself doing 
this with a cane in one hand and bifocals in the other. I need to test my 
mettle a little more than that." 
</P>

Don Was isn't the most sought-after producer in the business because he gives 
artists that patented Was (Not Was) sound. In fact, each of the records he's 
worked on sounds distinct. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems kind of disrespectful when you start getting to artists like Bonnie 
Raitt or Bob Dylan or Elton John -- it's a lot of nerve to say 'Lemme stamp my 
fingerprint on your forehead.' If I have instincts as an artist, I have an 
outlet for it, and it's not to dump it all over Bob Dylan's record." 
</P>
<P>
Between sessions in a Hollywood studio with the re-formed Knack, which is led 
by his old Detroit buddy Doug Feiger, Was discussed some of his production 
experiences past and present. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Raitt (Was produced her "Nick of Time" album and is set to do her next 
one): 
</P>
<P>
"Bonnie's record is the kind that every musician admires, because she 
represents the course a lot of them wish they had taken. She's really stuck to 
her guns, and when she made a very strong statement with probably her rootsiest 
album in a long time, she achieved her biggest success. And I think every 
artist's dream is to be successful with what's closest to their hearts." 
</P>
<P>
The B-52's (he produced half of their comeback "Cosmic Thing" album, including 
the single "Love Shack"): 
</P>
<P>
" 'Love Shack' wasn't even supposed to be one of the songs. The recording (of 
the other tracks) went so quickly that they said, 'Well, we have this thing 
that's not really done but it's a pretty cool groove.' When I first heard it, 
it was an 11-minute shopping list of lyrics, basically -- nothing repeated, no 
chorus, just an anthology of wild lines. It was like a puzzle. So we rearranged 
it in an afternoon, gave it structure and cut it. No one thought anything would 
come of it." 
</P>
<P>
Iggy Pop (the new "Brick by Brick" album): 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very intelligent, very funny guy. But most of the stories you've 
heard about him are true. He's pushed the rock 'n' roll lifestyle as far as you 
can go and not only lived -- which most people don't do -- but he's writing 
about it in a really articulate fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Elton John (four new tracks for a forthcoming retrospective): 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he was good -- anyone listening to those records can tell that they're 
well-crafted -- but until I really sat in a room with him and heard him sing 
and play the piano alone, (I didn't know) the guy's a genius. I mean, people 
really don't know, maybe because the glitzier aspects of his persona overshadow 
his musical talent. But he's one of the most talented people I ever met in my 
life. He's a very nice person, a very humble, unaffected man, and a soulful 
musician. I hope that doesn't get lost in what he does. People should take him 
very, very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Dylan (the current "Under a Red Sky," whose production with partner David 
Was has stirred debate over its level of looseness): 
</P>
<P>
"It was clear that there wasn't gonna be a lot of pre-production on this 
record, which is OK. I doubt Howlin' Wolf did a lot of pre-production either, 
and he made some pretty cool records. With Dylan, the feeling and vibe of the 
overall thing are as important as anything. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even know if he was aware of this, but the fact of the matter is that 
I learned about music from Bob Dylan. I didn't know who Robert Johnson or 
Howlin' Wolf were, I didn't know Woody Guthrie, I didn't know rockabilly stuff. 
. . . Dylan was the guy who brought all these disparate kinds of music together 
for people in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are like tractor-trailers, pulling this heavy wagon of legend. But 
really we attach it in our minds to these people. And when I saw Bob Dylan, the 
spokesman for a generation didn't walk into the room, just a really talented 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
"I respected him, but it didn't incapacitate me. It's what you work a whole 
lifetime for, to be able to be in the presence of these people and collaborate 
with them. That's the real reward, getting to mix with the best. Sometimes I 
feel like (Woody Allen's) Zelig. It's fantastic. It's all I ever wanted out of 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Paula Abdul (Was begins work on the dance diva's second album soon): 
</P>
<P>
"She wants to expand what she's doing, which is a really intriguing prospect. 
When I first met with her about working on her next album, I said, 'I can't do 
this stuff any better than you're already doing it. I would be imitating your 
records.' She said, 'I don't want to go back and make that record again. Let's 
do something else.' Actually, she gave me the same answer Bob Dylan did." CHRIS 
WILLMAN

D'OYLY CARTE -- THE COMPANY THAT ONCE DEFINED LIGHT OPERA -- IS ATTEMPTING TO 
RE-ESTABLISH ITS PROMINENCE ON STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1875, British theater impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte had dreams of 
establishing a school of English comic opera and so brought together the 
contentious librettist W. S. Gilbert and the Queen's favorite composer, Arthur 
Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
They were asked to create a companion piece for Offenbach's "La Perichole", 
then playing at the theater, and their new one-act opera -- "Trial by Jury" -- 
proved a triumph. D'Oyly Carte had found his ideal team and worked hard over 
the next 20 years to keep the partnership together. By 1881, on the profits of 
the operas, Carte was able to build the Savoy Theatre to permanently house the 
company. (With profits still rising, he built the Savoy Hotel eight years 
later.) 
</P>
<P>
The duo's efforts came to epitomize light opera, but when the copyright on the 
Gilbert and Sullivan works ran out in the 1960s, newfangled directors declared 
open season on the famous team. 
</P>
<P>
They created new productions -- some with jazzed-up scores and hyped-up jokes, 
and some even laden with the best of intentions. Suddenly, the tried and true 
productions of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company seemed tired and trite. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, after 107 years, the company devoted to G&amp;S shut its doors in 1982, 
victim of the new era. But after death came the resurrection. 
</P>
<P>
The new D'Oyly Carte, reconstituted in 1988, will be marking its first 
engagement in the United States Tuesday through Oct. 22, with productions of 
"The Mikado" and "The Pirates of Penzance" at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center in Costa Mesa. The run is part of the Festival of Britain, an arts 
festival and retail promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the new company are understandably nervous. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the most important single engagement the company's had since 
it was reformed," Michael Bishop, chairman of the new company, said while 
inspecting the center in August. Bishop is chairman of British Midland 
Airlines, which provided half the capital to re-establish the company. The 
artistic director of the company is Bramwell Tovey, previously with the 
Sadler's Wells Ballet (who did not accompany Bishop to Costa Mesa). 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite a challenge to come back to America. . . . I would say we were 
chased away last time. And there are good reasons why we shouldn't come back 
too soon." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Times Music Critic Martin Bernheimer -- writing of the company's demise 
in 1982 -- recalled its previous local tour: 
</P>
<P>
"In the summer of '76, the company already had fallen on hard times. It was, in 
fact, a thing of shreds and patches. A small, brave band of singers, generally 
more dedicated than talented, lumbered through ritualistic paces in the hostile 
confines of the Greek Theatre. The productions looked old and cheap and worn. 
Everyone -- well, almost everyone -- seemed tired. Inspiration was 
conspicuously absent." 
</P>
<P>
Bernheimer did allow, however, that "as always, there were flashes of 
excellence, even amid the artistic doldrums." 
</P>
<P>
What also tipped the scales against the old company was the refusal of the Arts 
Council of Great Britain to give it a grant, complaining that the productions 
were "tired and wooden." 
</P>
<P>
"The (old) company really got to the stage where it couldn't carry on because 
it got too mechanical," Bishop said. "Yes, it was a faithful interpreter of the 
words and the music, but the company would deliver it in a way which had become 
repetitive. It became obviously unsuitable to the pressures that had been 
building up by people who were bringing in new versions." 
</P>
<P>
He added that "superfluous gags, staging and jokes crept in over the years." 
</P>
<P>
"They had become very popular and, in fact, almost had become expectations. 
People had begun to imagine that they had been originally intended. And that's 
not the case." 
</P>
<P>
The new company, however, has trimmed those sails, cut what Bishop called "the 
institutionalized encores" and has acquired a leaner and younger look. 
</P>
<P>
"The approach of the company is a youthful approach," he said. "The average age 
of the company is now under 30. Some of the principals, of course, are older. 
But it doesn't betray any immaturity when you see the production in terms of 
the age of the people represented on stage. The actual balance is absolutely 
right. 
</P>
<P>
"The old company were permanent. They would have sung with them forever, for 
two or for 25 years. We are now a company that is reformed every season. We've 
had people with us now for three seasons. But nonetheless they had stood down 
(re-auditioned) at the start of each season, and new people come into the 
company every year." 
</P>
<P>
The new company does not necessarily regard itself as the guardian of the 
authentic G&amp;S tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds very pompous to say that we are the 'guardians of tradition,' " 
Bishop said. "I don't really see ourselves in that way. I think you have to 
earn this accolade rather than say that this is what we are. 
</P>
<P>
"But we do hope that we will be that over a period of time. The public and the 
critics will judge whether we achieve what we set out to do." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Bishop appears to stress only one half of the famous partnership. 
</P>
<P>
"What we set out to do is to be the definitive performers of the music, but not 
necessarily the drama," he said. "I don't think we are trying to throw any of 
Gilbert's intentions overboard. But where we have felt, in the way of survival 
for a new company, that we've actually been able to bring a considerable breath 
of fresh air to the way in which the productions have been staged. 
</P>
<P>
"But in no sense are we turning these productions into musicals," he cautioned. 
"We are only recruiting from people who have had a long term career in opera." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop describes the two productions to be seen in Costa Mesa as "strongly 
contrasting ones. They were both created in 1989." 
</P>
<P>
"The production of 'The Mikado' scenically is a very traditional production," 
he said. "Both set designer Eileen Diss and costume designer Jessica Gwynne 
decided to use a very limited palette of colors of dyes that were available 
from natural sources to the Japanese at around the time that it's fictionally 
set. And so that's a very traditional approach to 'The Mikado.' 
</P>
<P>
"The 'Pirates of Penzance' is somewhat more modern in its approach and utilizes 
some more modern production techniques, which I don't want to spoil for the 
audience. The set is not naturalistic. It's not set on a rocky promenade. It's 
a unit set that serves many purposes and is quite ingenious in its application. 
It's a set which becomes increasingly more interesting as the performance goes 
on." 
</P>
<P>
The company commissioned Keith Warner, a staff producer with the English 
National Opera, to direct "Pirates." 
</P>
<P>
Says Bishop: "I think he succeeded in getting the right blend of not moving 
away from the definitive interpretation of the score but nevertheless injecting 
into it, not quite as robust as say, Joe Papp's 'Pirates' -- that was a 
swashbuckling musical -- but he's gone a long way to actually livening up the 
musical interpretations of the words. I hope it's the right blend." 
</P>
<P>
The true Savoyard may be puzzled why the new company is bringing productions of 
two very well known works, as opposed to "Iolanthe" or "The Yeomen of the 
Guard" (both date from 1988). 
</P>
<P>
"I think the repertoire is perhaps better known on the East Coast than on the 
West Coast," said Bishop, "and I think that we're coming to a new area, which 
perhaps has probably not got the same basic, intrinsic audience for the works. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe if we'd gone to New York or the East Coast, I think probably we could be 
more adventurous. But I think of coming here, that this is a building block for 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
Although the original company shut down in 1982, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust 
continued, according to Bishop. Further, before her death in 1985, Dame Bridget 
D'Oyly Carte, granddaughter of founder Richard D'Oyly Carte, left a bequest of 
about $2 million "specifically to restart the company," Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
"To that, which we got the interest from, my company, British Midland Airways, 
matched the income bequest. Together, between the two, we were able to get the 
capital to restart the company." 
</P>
<P>
The new D'Oyly Carte mounts two new productions a year and operates on an 
annual budget of $2 million. This year, the company created a new "H.M.S. 
Pinafore" and "Trial by Jury," bringing the total restagings now to six, almost 
midway through the canon. 
</P>
<P>
But if this is the beginning of one era, it's also the end of another, 
according to Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
"When we get back to England, we'll be getting ready to produce operas other 
than Gilbert and Sullivan," Bishop said. "The D'Oyly Carte is actually going to 
diversify . . . I think there is a place in Britain for us to become the 
national light opera company." 
</P>
<P>
Further, the company will be leaving London and moving to a new home and 
permanent base in Birmingham, beginning in January. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have much more resources because they are giving us 
accommodations for a front office and giving us a theater, which they're 
refurbishing for us, and in which we'll be playing in twice a year," Bishop 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"From the company point of view, we will have a lot more support behind us in 
the future than we've had in the past. It's been quite a difficulty thing to 
run a company of this size without government aid or any other kind of aid. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've got very firm ground to build on for the future. But one of the 
most important things is to bring younger people back in to see the shows, 
because one of things that was happening was that the audience was getting 
ancient along with the productions. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to bring younger people back in. But we think we're doing all 
right."

HUNTINGTON IN HIS HANDS; 
</P>
<P>
EDWARD NYGREN EXPECTS TO ADD MORE AMERICAN WORKS AND 'A NEW SET OF EYES' TO 
LIBRARY'S COLLECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"It's probably corny to say you like 'Pinkie' and 'Blue Boy,' but how could you 
not? They are such monuments of British art history," said Edward J. Nygren, 
admiring two popular favorites by Sir Thomas Lawrence and Thomas Gainsborough 
at the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens in San Marino. 
"I have a particular fondness for Gainsborough (the painter of 'Blue Boy') 
because I'm a sucker for artists who love to paint. The way he can turn paint 
into flickering light and gossamer effects is breathtaking." 
</P>
<P>
Like a sugar addict in a confectioner's shop, Nygren was sampling one delight 
after another in the galleries that will become his professional home in March. 
Currently director and chief curator of the Smith College Museum of Art in 
Northampton, Mass., Nygren will succeed Robert Wark as curator of the 
Huntington's art collections. Wark recently retired after 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
On a brief visit to Los Angeles, Nygren reflected on the "exhilarating" 
prospect of overseeing the Huntington's renowned collection. "No museum in the 
country can lay claim to the quality of the Huntington's British portraits in 
the grand manner," he said. "This is a collection I have known about for a long 
time, but I haven't known it well and I'm looking forward to that." 
</P>
<P>
A scholar of British and American art -- and a believer that the two go 
hand-in-hand -- Nygren appears to have been called to exactly the right place. 
While the Huntington's collection is predominantly British, the venerable 
institution received a bequest of 50 American paintings from Virginia Steele 
Scott in 1980 and subsequently built an elegant gallery for them. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Huntington's strongest attractions for Nygren is that he will be 
able to do research on both British and American art, as well as indulge his 
affection for decorative arts, which are displayed with paintings and 
sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
Building on research demonstrating the influence of English art on American 
artists, Nygren plans to explore British-American connections in the 
Huntington's library and art collections, and display some of the results in 
exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
Nygren became persuaded that knowledge of British art is fundamental to 
understanding American art while enrolled in the University of Delaware's 
Winterthur Program in Early American Culture. He went on to study both fields 
at Yale, earning his Ph.D. in 1976. Subsequently he served as associate curator 
of painting at the Yale Center for British Art and as curator of collections at 
the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., before taking his current post 
at Smith in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Yale collection, in which donations by Paul Mellon convey an 
"Anglophile's impression of an upper-class country gentleman's life," the 
Huntington reflects "the ideals, pretensions and tastes of an American magnate 
of the early 20th Century," Nygren said. The building that houses the 
collection is the former mansion of railroad magnate Henry E. Huntington, and 
the lavish estate gives visitors an impression of stepping back into time. 
</P>
<P>
With its literary and artistic masterpieces, sumptuous gardens and masses of 
tourists, the Huntington is so well established that it might seem difficult 
for a new curator to have an impact, but Nygren said his task is to bring "a 
new set of eyes" to the collection. 
</P>
<P>
A curator is always concerned with "electrifying or energizing" artworks so 
that viewers see them in a new way, he said. "As an art historian, I have a 
strong interest in material culture -- in the objects themselves -- but I also 
have a desire to place them in a cultural context. Fortunately I will be able 
to do that here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
High prices and a meager budget preclude making many additions to the already 
rich British collection, but Nygren has one item on his wish list. "I think the 
collection could sustain the addition of a James Ward," he said, referring to a 
British artist known for dramatic animal paintings who was the subject of 
Nygren's doctoral dissertation. 
</P>
<P>
Collecting American art is more promising because the Virginia Steele Scott 
bequest included an endowment for that purpose. "I think we can develop a 
distinguished American collection," Nygren said. 
</P>
<P>
Such curatorial challenges are familiar territory; Los Angeles is not. "It's a 
jolt," he said, confiding that he had telephoned John Walsh, who left Boston to 
direct the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, to ask whether it was possible for a 
dyed-in-the-wool Easterner to adjust to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Getty Trust's multifaceted programs in art history and plans for a 
$300-million cultural center in Brentwood, currently under construction, were 
no small part of that decision, Nygren said. "In terms of art historical 
research and of the people who will be coming here, it's enormously exciting. 
Not next year, but in five years or so, there will be nothing comparable in the 
world. To be part of that is very exciting."

OFFICIAL SEEKS TO CURB ASTRONOMICAL STAR FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRETA BEIGEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Superstar fees have gone through the roof and one local presenter wants to do 
something about it. 
</P>
<P>
Pebbles Wadsworth, executive director of UCLA's Center for the Performing Arts, 
believes the time has come for presenters to band together and refuse to pay 
what she calls outrageous sums. 
</P>
<P>
While tenor Luciano Pavarotti has long earned more than $100,000 for a 
one-night stand, Wadsworth deems the $40,000-to-$50,000-per-night fee of 
superstars such as Itzhak Perlman, Isaac Stern, Leontyne Price or Kiri Te 
Kanawa "immoral, incorrect and inappropriate." She also considers a top-flight 
orchestra's asking price of $60,000 to $80,000 "excessive," especially if 
orchestra members stay at a luxurious Beverly Hills hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"Some presenters pay these fees and it becomes a circular thing," says 
Wadsworth, who presides over a $3.9-million budget. "We need to take 
responsibility in this and not just blame the artists." 
</P>
<P>
But Wadsworth and other Southland presenters remain adamant that increased 
artists' fees not result in higher ticket prices. At UCLA, where prices run 
from $16 to $40, they "are as high as we can raise them," Wadsworth says. 
</P>
<P>
Some presenters are using lighter fare to fund classical performances. The 
South Bay Center for the Arts at El Camino College in Torrance, which puts on a 
vocal, keyboard and orchestral series and has a top ticket price of $39, 
bolsters its income with funds generated from country and pop concerts, which 
usually sell out, as well as a speaker series. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be in deep red ink without these to fund our (classical) events," 
says executive director Philip Westin. 
</P>
<P>
But Ambassador Auditorium, with top ticket prices at $60, even with plans to 
expand its country and jazz series, still must seek outside funding. UCLA 
concerts also rely heavily on corporate and private support. 
</P>
<P>
Fees for orchestras are also rising fast -- hitting well into the double-digit 
range. Erich Vollmer, executive director of the Orange County Philharmonic 
Society, which has a $2.7-million budget and this season will present 13 
touring orchestras, says the costs of importing ensembles increased about 24% 
in 1990-91 over the preceding year. Should the trend continue, Vollmer expects 
to trim forthcoming seasons and step up fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Shilkret, general manager of the Hollywood Bowl, concurs that managers 
need to contain costs. However, he says that "every fee is negotiable," even 
when dealing with highly popular artists. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, artists such as Mirella Freni or Te Kanawa, who command up to 
$75,000 per performance, will charge less than going rates to organizations 
that have helped foster their careers. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jack Mastroianni, vice president of Columbia Artists Management 
Inc., the sopranos are willing "to nod in the direction of Ambassador" because 
the foundation gave them a break early in their careers. (Freni is in recital 
at Ambassador Nov. 10; Te Kanawa is not scheduled this year, but has often 
appeared there.) He also suggests that a top-drawer such as Te Kanawa can sell 
out an entire subscription series because audiences are loathe to wait until 
single tickets go on sale. 
</P>
<P>
But, above all, Mastroianni says, it's a case of supply and demand. If 
promoters band together, he says, artists will merely go where the demand is 
high, whether it be Miami, Puerto Rico, Lexington, Ky., or to Europe -- where 
fees are now at an all-time mark. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, to hear Ambassador's booking manager Bill Wiemhoff tell it, many in 
the operatic field who find European dates more profitable are no longer 
crossing the Atlantic and, if they do, won't tour west of the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, it's an artist's box-office appeal that determines ticket sales 
and, according to Pavarotti's manager, Herbert Breslin, "makes the fee 
structure go around." 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is if an artist can sell tickets," Breslin says. "If they can 
and they want more money they should be entitled to it. No presenter has ever 
lost a penny on Pavarotti. He is an artist in the classical world who has an 
enormous following." GRETA BEIGEL

THE AMBASSADOR'S FINE-TUNER; 
</P>
<P>
DIRECTOR DAVID HULME DEALS WITH A HOST OF PROBLEMS, FROM SUDDEN CANCELLATIONS 
TO FUND RAISING.

<P>
David Hulme, Ambassador Auditorium's new performing arts director, was faced 
with a dilemma. Pianist Andre Watts, due to open the 1990-91 season, had 
canceled because of shoulder pain. Merely postponing the opening six days to 
present an already scheduled recital by Swedish baritone Hakan Hagegard posed 
another difficulty: Hagegard's performance was to start at 8:30 p.m. on 
Saturday, Sept. 29 -- not long after the close of Yom Kippur. 
</P>
<P>
"The concert might obviously cut out a certain group, but it is after sundown," 
said Hulme, an ordained minister who has spent most of his life in service of 
the Worldwide Church of God, sponsor of cultural events at Ambassador 
Auditorium. "It would never be the church's intention to offend anyone in any 
way. I do hope this is not a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Soothing ruffled feathers. Dealing with cancellations and delays. 
Counterprogramming against competitors. It's all in a day's work for an arts 
presenter, who must gauge box-office trends and line up talent as much as three 
years in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Hulme, 44, in charge of programming, communications and public relations at 
Ambassador Foundation, will present 100 performances of classical and "popular 
musical" entertainment this season. Although Hulme has no formal musical 
training -- he says his musical ambitions are satisfied vicariously by his 
three children, all pianists -- this hasn't stopped the tall, elegant 
Britisher. 
</P>
<P>
"Musical temperament alone is not a guarantee to run a successful performing 
arts series," he says in his large offices overlooking the fountains and 
greenery of the Ambassador complex in Pasadena. "You need someone who also is a 
generalist with administrative ability. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a business venture and there's a lot of public relations and 
advertising involved. But my staff are musically trained and this makes a 
difference," says Hulme, who took over as director last year from 13-year 
veteran Wayne Shilkret, who became general manager of the Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador concert season receives a $1-million subsidy from the Worldwide 
Church of God (annual budget of about $200 million), Hulme says. But with 
artists' fees skyrocketing, he anticipates for the first time in Ambassador's 
15-year history that outside funding will be sought with corporate and patron 
sponsorships. 
</P>
<P>
In his view, these escalating costs should not be passed on to subscribers: "I 
can't see charging $50 to $100 a seat. The audience would ask if the artist is 
worth it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Hulme, a jazz buff, also plans to expand the three-concert "Sounds of Genius"' 
jazz series, and launch a jazz festival next summer that he believes will 
attract a different crowd from the Playboy Jazz series and "service the 
multiplicity" of jazz interests ranging from big band to fusion. 
</P>
<P>
Hulme also wants to stretch the country music category and broaden the big band 
series that attracts an older audience and, by Hulme's calculation this year, 
is expected to sell out. 
</P>
<P>
Hulme estimates that more than 140,000 patrons pass through the 1,262-seat 
Ambassador Auditorium each year. Season renewals run about 78%. Ironically, 
however, it's the Sunday matinee screenings of "World Travel Films" that pulls 
in the Pasadena crowds, and without advertising sells out by subscription. 
</P>
<P>
Hulme believes that Ambassador must be more persistent and creative if it is to 
keep abreast of its chief competitor, the downtown Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
He boasts the signing of the Lebeque sisters, the French-born duo-pianists, who 
will visit with the L'Orchestre de Paris, Semyon Bychkov conducting. "We could 
never get them before," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Hulme, who founded a jazz club at age 12, was graduated with a bachelor of arts 
degree from Ambassador College in England, and later studied psychology and 
philosophy at Edinburgh University. Fascinated with the teachings of the 
Worldwide Church of God, which has about 94,000 members around the globe, Hulme 
in 1976 was ordained a minister in South Africa while working at the church's 
headquarters in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
After a stint in advertising and publishing in Canada, Hulme was named in 1981 
to head communications efforts at the Church's Pasadena headquarters, and five 
years later as vice president of Ambassador Foundation began spearheading the 
church's humanitarian projects that have included working with handicapped 
children in Jordan, helping build an agricultural college in Kenya and teaching 
English in Thailand. In fact, Hulme's office is filled with photographs 
documenting his travels and meetings with the rich and famous. There's Hulme 
with Barbara Bush at the Kennedy Center; with Prince Philip in Los Angeles. And 
there he is with Nancy Reagan at Ambassador College. 
</P>
<P>
A man with a ready Kennedy-esque smile, Hulme also acts as monthly host on the 
church's Sunday morning television program, "The World Tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Hulme, who inspects box-office receipts several times weekly, is not adverse to 
bringing in another arts administrator should his duties with the church expand 
into other areas. For now, he finds the challenge invigorating. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have to say that I am happy with what we're doing here," Hulme says. 
"I think it's the concept of a family running things that makes things work. We 
are a team rather than old-fashioned impresarios."

NOW COMES THE HARD PART IN LAGUNA'S LAND PURCHASE; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCING: THE CITY HAS AGREED TO A PRICE, BUT IT STILL MUST RAISE THE MONEY TO 
MEET THAT PRICE. TO PAY OFF THE FINAL INSTALLMENT, IT IS COUNTING ON STATE OR 
FEDERAL MONEY AND PRIVATE CONTRIBUTIONS.

<P>
Now that the dust has cleared in the fight over a scenic stretch of Laguna 
Canyon, how likely is the city of Laguna Beach to raise the nearly $80 million 
it needs to buy the property? 
</P>
<P>
The short answer: Financial experts say the city's plan to come up with the 
first $40 million seems pretty solid. 
</P>
<P>
It's the second half of the $80 million that's still up in the air. And one 
thing is clear -- it will be a lot harder to get, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Irvine Co. agreed to sell more than 2,000 acres in Laguna Canyon 
to the city rather than build more than 3,000 homes. The price tag: About $78 
million, a considerable amount of money for a city of 25,000 to raise but $27 
million less than the value one independent appraiser put on the land. 
</P>
<P>
In order to pay the first installment of the $78 million, the city must 
persuade voters by a two-thirds margin to tax the city's property owners 
another $60 or so a year in order to raise $20 million plus interest. A 
two-thirds vote is tough to get, especially when people are being asked to tax 
themselves. City officials believe that $20 million was the maximum amount 
voters would support. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Laguna Beach is a liberal Democratic enclave in conservative Orange 
County, the vote is expected to be close. That is despite the city's 
environmental leanings and a poll purportedly showing 80% of the residents 
supporting the bond issue. The group that helped negotiate the compromise with 
the Irvine Co. -- the Laguna Laurel Advisory Group -- is backing the political 
campaign. But time is short: The election is Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
One thing in the bond issue's favor is that observers say much of the Laguna 
Beach business community is solidly behind the bond issue, in part out of 
self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't stand to gain much from the development of Laguna Laurel, which 
was going to have its own stores," said Salvatore Maddi, a Laguna Beach 
resident and professor of social ecology at UC Irvine. "It wasn't likely to 
have enhanced their businesses, plus it would have added to the terrible 
traffic problems around here." 
</P>
<P>
Assuming the bond passes, the city will use it to meet part of a $33-million 
down payment due next year. In return the city gets part of the 2,150 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The city has another $4 million in a fund to buy open space and says it will 
borrow another $5 million on the $850,000 it takes out of its parking meters 
each year. County government will kick in $2 million in the first year -- the 
first of five annual contributions that will total $10 million. But that still 
leaves the city $2 million short in the first year. And that's not all. 
</P>
<P>
There are three smaller payments due in 1992, 1993 and 1994, all under $5 
million. After each payment, the city gets another chunk of land. But on each 
payment the city faces a shortfall of at least $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's a big final payment in 1995 of $33 million, and right now the city 
only knows that $2 million will come from the county. Selling the $20-million 
bond to investors shouldn't be much of a problem. Nor should it be much of a 
burden on the city's finances, experts say. The money will come directly from 
the city's property owners in the form of higher property taxes. It won't come 
from the $25 million a year it costs the city to operate, so it shouldn't put a 
strain there. 
</P>
<P>
And the city has no other bonds it is paying off. In fact, it hasn't issued a 
bond in so long that neither of the big bond-rating services rates the city 
anymore. (Small cities that are already built out don't need to issue many 
bonds.) 
</P>
<P>
It isn't even unusual for a city to start a project with financing from a bond 
when it knows it is going to come up short and have to get more money from 
somewhere else, said Mark Campa, an assistant vice president at Moody's 
Investors Service Inc., one of two big companies that rate municipal bonds. The 
other source the cities often turn to, he said, is a government grant. 
</P>
<P>
What is unusual is for a city to use a bond to buy vacant land in order to keep 
it empty, although a few other California cities have done so, according to 
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., the other big bond-rating company. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens, the city won't issue another bond, city officials say. It 
wouldn't be politically palatable even in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
How will the shortfall be made up each year? Laguna Beach says it is betting 
that the money will come from state or federal funds and from private 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is hard to say whether that is a good bet, although the state is 
probably good for at least some of the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach got $10 million in 1988 from a statewide open space 
land-acquisition bond issue passed by voters, about $4 million of which is left 
and will be applied toward the Laguna Laurel purchase. But that money was 
earmarked specifically for the city. 
</P>
<P>
The city is planning to enter the competition for up to $15 million available 
from a state wildlife habitat measure approved by voters in June. Another bond 
issue on the November ballot -- Prop. 149 -- doesn't set aside a large chunk of 
money specifically for Laguna Beach, although officials think $3 million to $4 
million will be available to the county. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach probably can make a good case for the money, even though the 
picturesque little seaside city of 25,000 is already girded by a substantial 
greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
But "there's usually a good deal of competition for this money," said Shirley 
Willd-Wagner, a parks specialist at the state Department of Parks and 
Recreation, which oversees the money. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to require a lot of work" to find the extra money, said 
Paul Freeman, a consultant hired by both sides. "But everybody thinks it's 
achievable." 
</P>
<P>
Last week's settlement raises another interesting question: How much profit is 
the company foregoing by selling to the city? 
</P>
<P>
The privately held company won't say. But it's clear, say experts and even the 
city of Laguna Beach, that the company could have made more money selling the 
land to home builders if public pressure hadn't forced it to reconsider the 
huge project. 
</P>
<P>
The land -- acquired by Irvine Co. Chairman Donald L. Bren in 1983 when he 
bought control of the giant landowner -- cost a lot less then when compared to 
its value nowadays. So while the company is most likely foregoing a substantial 
profit, it's by no means taking a loss. 
</P>
<P>
But home builders say it's almost certain the company could have made perhaps 
tens of millions of dollars more -- by one informal estimate, closer to $100 
million -- by selling the land to home builders. Even Laguna Beach concurs. 
"There's no question they could have made more money selling it to builders," 
said Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth C. Frank. 
</P>
<P>
A recent appraisal just released in detail at the end of the week and paid for 
by the company and its opponents estimated the value of the land at $105 
million. Neither side disputes that estimate. 
</P>
<P>
But then there's also the matter of $30 million worth of road work the Irvine 
Co. promised the county it would do to lessen the impact of the extra traffic 
that Laguna Laurel would have generated. (The land is outside the city limits 
in county jurisdiction.) 
</P>
<P>
Had the project been built, the company probably would have passed on most of 
that $30-million cost to the people who bought the homes in the form of higher 
home prices. In other words, it wouldn't have cost the company very much. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the $30 million will come out of the company's pocket. So most of 
it has to be subtracted from the $78 million the company is getting for the 
land since there will now be no homeowners to pass the costs to. 
</P>
<P>
Also off the top of the $78 million comes whatever the company has spent in 
more than 10 years of appearing before government hearings and preparing 
environmental impact reports. The company says it hasn't calculated what that 
figure is. But assume, experts say, that it's safe to subtract at least several 
million dollars more from the $78 million. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves the company with something in the mid-$40 million range to show for 
the sale. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, if a developer paid $105 million for the property tomorrow, he 
could reasonably expect to resell all the land to home builders for $311 
million, according to the appraisal by Gary L. Vogt and Associates in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Even after deducting the $85 million the appraisers estimated it would cost to 
grade the land, put in utilities, pay property taxes and interest on loans, the 
new owner could reasonably expect a profit of 15%, or nearly $47 million, 
according to the appraisal. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the interest on the $78-million purchase price, which the Irvine 
Co. will also forgo over the next five years. That would have added about $23 
million, the company says. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there's the fact the Irvine Co. demands that builders who buy land 
must pay the company a certain percentage from the sale of the homes they 
build. The company gave up building its own houses several years ago; now it 
merely sells improved land to home builders. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear to me the company's side of the deal was not wholly driven by 
financial considerations," said one big home builder who has bought land from 
the company. "I don't think there's any doubt the Irvine Co. is giving up a 
small fortune on this." On the other hand, going ahead with the project meant 
fighting a clutch of lawsuits and protesters marching through the canyon, some 
of them promising to stand in front of the bulldozers. Those are costs that 
can't be quantified but are very real nevertheless: Another massive 
demonstration against the project, like the one that drew about 8,000 
protesters to Laguna Canyon last fall, might have damaged the benevolent public 
image the company is trying to cultivate. 
</P>
<P>
Developing the project, in other words, might have been financially feasible 
but had become politically unfeasible.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: WHAT'S THE POINT OF I-5 CHECKPOINT?

PALMDALE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inside the tiny Palmdale apartment of Jose Aguilar, his wife and children 
lamented the recent death of "Grandpa," Jose's 80-year-old father, Custodio 
Aguilar. 
</P>
<P>
The old man died after being struck by a pickup truck last month while crossing 
Interstate 5. He was No. 12, the twelfth immigrant to die this year trying to 
avoid detection at the San Clemente immigration checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
In his case, he wanted to visit his grandchildren. It was his son Jose who told 
him to cross the busy freeway after Jose became nervous and dropped his father 
off in the northbound shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Custodio Aguilar had applied for a visitor's permit through the 
U.S. Consulate in Guadalajara, his family said. But it was denied. Now he's 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to do things legally," said Jose's wife, Maria Guadalupe. "We wanted 
him to enter the country legally." 
</P>
<P>
That statement was uttered repeatedly by the grief-stricken family during a 
recent interview. As a Chicano born in East Los Angeles, I was moved by their 
story. 
</P>
<P>
Although they tried a legal means first, they victimized themselves by a 
dangerously dumb idea to cross a California interstate at night. 
</P>
<P>
When Custodio's granddaughter, Angeles, said, "Why don't they get rid of that 
checkpoint?" I started thinking. How many times had I thought that before? How 
many times have I heard about the intimidation that other Chicanos and 
Mexican-Americans feel when they travel through the checkpoint? 
</P>
<P>
Many non-Latinos don't understand those feelings. When they approach a 
checkpoint, they don't think about fear, but rather if their hair is combed or 
if they're wearing a fresh shirt. 
</P>
<P>
The feeling, at least among Latinos, is one of inadequacy. We feel 
second-class. It's ironic that after a weekend in Mexico of eating carnitas and 
listening to mariachis and feeling Mexican again, I too worry when I return to 
my own country and approach the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
I thought I was alone with these feelings of intimidation until I brought up 
Custodio's death with my dentist, Steven R. Chew. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, Dave, don't feel bad. I get the same feelings when I cross the border or 
go through the checkpoint," said Chew, whose blond hair and blue eyes would 
make him less likely than I or my dark-skinned brethren to ever be stopped and 
questioned by Border Patrol agents. 
</P>
<P>
Even Chew asked, "Why do we have the checkpoint there? It's so far from the 
border." 
</P>
<P>
I posed the question to Ted Swofford, U.S. Border Patrol spokesman in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"The checkpoint is a tool that we use to act as a backup to our primary line of 
defense here at the border," Swofford said, adding that the Border Patrol 
averages about 6,000 apprehensions of undocumented workers a month at the San 
Clemente checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
"The checkpoint is not the problem, the people crossing the freeway are the 
problem. We understand they cross due to the checkpoint, but if they were 
killed while crossing the border, would they argue to close the border?" he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Swofford is not a dumb man. He's an intelligent and articulate representative 
of the federal government. But it's a government that has spent millions of 
dollars in the passage and enactment of the Immigration Reform Act of 1986, the 
biggest overhaul of our nation's immigration policy ever. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not working, said Custodio's son, Jose. Every day, thousands of 
Mexican immigrants successfully arrive in Orange County, Los Angeles and even 
Palmdale, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Bustamante, president of a Tijuana-based think tank called College of the 
Northern Border, said of the immigration reform act at a University of Texas 
seminar on Mexican demographics earlier this month: "It does not work. It 
failed at stemming the flow." 
</P>
<P>
I wish I had a penny for every word uttered by Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyoming) 
and Rep. Peter Rodino (D-N.J.), who has since retired, during their speeches on 
behalf of the reform act they drafted. 
</P>
<P>
Their act did nothing about Mexico's deteriorating economic condition and very 
little to stem the need for a cheap source of illegal labor in this country. 
</P>
<P>
The Border Patrol's own figures bear out that little has been done to stop 
illegal migration. Swofford says that 427,772 people were apprehended in the 
San Diego region in fiscal year 1985. For fiscal year 1989-90, it has gone up 
to 473,323, the third-highest tally in the history of the Border Patrol, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For the family of Custodio Aguilar, who described him as a tolerant but 
reserved farmer who grew corn, rice, beans "and whatever the land could 
support," I'll give them the simple solution to this nation's immigration 
dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
It's a global problem that needs as its base a political and economic solution, 
not an enforcement one. That will be 18 cents, Mr. Simpson.

Two centuries after Paul Revere warned that the British were coming, they were 
greeted with cheers and merriment here Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Marching to the strains of "Bonnie Dundee," the Royal Highland Fusiliers 
pipe-and-drum band led a procession down Town Center Drive to officially start 
the two-day Great British Food Fest at Town Center Park. 
</P>
<P>
The outdoor festival -- an admission-free event ending today -- is part of the 
monthlong celebration honoring the culture and arts of the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd cheered and cameras clicked as Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra, 
a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II and a descendant of King George V, took 
her seat on stage, where she watched the procession. 
</P>
<P>
American fascination with royalty aside, the loudest round of applause during 
the parade went to a Marine Corps band. Other procession units included classic 
British automobiles and the Orange County Firemen's Assn.'s classic orange fire 
engine. 
</P>
<P>
The princess, who was accompanied by her husband, Sir Angus Ogilvy, smiled but 
did not address the audience after receiving proclamations and Costa Mesa's key 
to the city -- an omission that disappointed county resident Delpha Cadogan, 
who was born in England. 
</P>
<P>
"I was real disappointed she did not speak," Cadogan said. "We have a real 
great affection for her, and I think that it would have been nice if everybody 
could have gotten to see how down to earth she is." 
</P>
<P>
After the procession and a tour of South Coast Repertory, the princess quickly 
moved through the festival grounds, where 9-year-old Amy Terrell of Costa Mesa 
got what she came for: a chance to greet a member of the British royal family. 
</P>
<P>
"She's pretty," the young girl said. "I mainly watched her say 'hello' to other 
people." 
</P>
<P>
The aroma of grilled beef patties, Indian somosas, fish and chips and other 
fare filled the air, while comedians and musicians entertained. 
</P>
<P>
Show tunes from "My Fair Lady" and "Oliver!" were performed by Ray Cooper, a 
one-man band. 
</P>
<P>
And on the main stage, the "British invasion" in 1960s popular music was 
revisited by Rain, a four-member band that performs songs by the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
A few yards away, Derk Jaeger, 3, bounced up and down to the beat of "Roll Over 
Beethoven" as an ice cream bar melted in his small hand. 
</P>
<P>
Although enjoying the rock music, the toddler said, "I like the pipers the 
best." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach resident Mario Narro said he lived in England for three years in 
the 1970s but did not get to enjoy much of the culture back then. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I'm coming out today," he said. "I thought I would catch up on lost 
time." 
</P>
<P>
John Keys of Oceanside looked like any other tourist until he introduced his 
13-month-old son, Johnny, who was wearing a kilt. Keys, of Scottish descent, 
pulled out a wallet and proudly showed a photo of his son a month after he was 
born, wearing a kilt and lying on a plaid blanket. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great so far," Keys said of the festival, which he hopes will be an 
annual event. "We would be here every time they held it."

WIFE OF CONVICTED KILLER SAYS SUIT SETTLEMENT VINDICATES HER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Gail Harrington-Wisely, the wife of convicted murderer Willie Ray Wisely, says 
she feels "completely vindicated" by the $70,000 paid to her by the county last 
week to settle her lawsuit stemming from her 1987 arrest on charges of 
smuggling drugs into the jail. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington-Wisely said she was informed by her Santa Ana law firm that a check 
had been received from the county, following informal negotiations. She said 
she expects to receive about $45,000 after legal fees are deducted. 
</P>
<P>
"A significant portion of that money will be used to get Willie Wisely out of 
prison," said Harrington-Wisely, who was a law student at the time of the 
arrest. "He's an innocent who's been in prison for almost 11 years." 
</P>
<P>
Harrington-Wisely, 28, was arrested in August, 1987, on suspicion of smuggling 
drugs to an inmate during a legal consultation in the Orange County jail. A pen 
containing about three grams of marijuana and cocaine was taken from the inmate 
after he left a meeting with Harrington-Wisely, who was working as a law clerk. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Harrington-Wisely were dropped in 1988 after a sheriff's 
deputy testified at a preliminary hearing that the inmate could have been given 
the drugs in a holding cell before Harrington-Wisely's visit. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1987, Wisely was sentenced to life without parole for killing his 
stepfather, Robert Bray. Bray was crushed to death in 1981 while he was working 
under the cab of his tractor-trailer rig on a street in Huntington Beach, where 
he lived. Later in 1981 Wisely was convicted of the killing and sentenced to 
death, a penalty that was subsequently thrown out because of state Supreme 
Court rulings on jury instructions. 
</P>
<P>
While being held in the Orange County jail, Wisely filed numerous lawsuits over 
conditions in the jail, including one in which he was awarded $5,050. Through 
court motions he obtained his own eight-man double cell, equipped with a 
computer and a private telephone that enabled him to work on his own case. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the 4th District Court of Appeal upheld Wisely's conviction. 
He is now serving his sentence at Corcoran State Prison in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington-Wisely said she expected her husband's attorneys to file a petition 
this week to the appeal court, asking for a rehearing. If that is denied, she 
said, Wisely will appeal to the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington-Wisely, who has moved to Lemoore, near the prison, said she visits 
her husband five days a week and continues to devote her time to freeing 
Wisely. "I work on that case every day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington-Wisely secretly married Wisely on Christmas Eve in 1987 after 
bringing a minister with her into the same meeting room where sheriff's 
deputies said the drug smuggling took place. She met Wisely when she was a law 
student and was interviewed by him for a law clerk position the courts had 
granted him.

DAMAGE FROM COSTA MESA FIRE COULD BE MORE THAN $2 MILLION

<TEXT>
<P>
Fire officials said the damage from a two-alarm fire that raged through an 
industrial complex Friday morning could top $2 million, after investigators 
found out that the blaze had been fueled by a new inventory of Brazilian 
outdoor furniture. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Feather, aide to Costa Mesa's battalion chief, said Saturday that owners 
of a patio furniture business, one of two businesses heavily damaged, reported 
that a large amount of the wooden furniture from Brazil had been received just 
two days before the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a high fire load, and the place was maxed out," Feather said of the 
damage to Sunbird Enterprises. He said an adjoining maker of boating products, 
HP Marine, was also gutted. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are trying to determine the cause of the fire, which was reported 
at 5:11 a.m. Friday in the 1700 block of Monrovia Avenue and took more than 
four hours to extinguish. Two firefighters were treated for minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Feather said investigators walked through the remains of the single-story 
complex Saturday and found the roof of the Sunbird business destroyed and the 
interior gutted. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have said the fire appeared to have started in the Sunbird unit 
before spreading to HP Marine.

KOPP SETS THE RECORDS STRAIGHT AS PACIFIC POUNDS TITANS, 67-37 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
University of the Pacific quarterback Troy Kopp left Cal State Fullerton's 
defense utterly defenseless Saturday, passing for 515 yards and seven 
touchdowns to lead the Tigers to a 67-37 victory in front of 2,013 in Santa Ana 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Kopp, a sophomore from Mission Viejo High School, completed 31 of 52 passes in 
a little more than three quarters and set single-game school records for 
passing yards, touchdown passes and total yards. 
</P>
<P>
With 396 yards passing at halftime, Kopp was on course to break the NCAA 
single-game passing record of 631 yards, set in 1988 by Utah's Scott Mitchell 
against Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
But Pacific concentrated more on the running game in the second half, and when 
the Tigers built a 24-point lead early in the fourth quarter, Coach Walt Harris 
replaced Kopp with Kris King. 
</P>
<P>
Kopp was two touchdown passes short of former San Diego State quarterback 
Dennis Shaw's NCAA record of nine in a game, set in 1969 against New Mexico 
State. Pacific's 747 total yards was a school record. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, which trailed by two, 33-31, early in the third quarter, had 436 
total yards, giving the teams a combined total of 1,183 yards. But that was 
well short of the NCAA total offense record of 1,436 yards, set in 1981 by 
Arizona State (743) and Stanford (693). 
</P>
<P>
Titan quarterback Paul Schulte completed 20 of 37 passes for 296 yards and 
three touchdowns, all to J.J. Celestine, who caught nine passes for 177 yards. 
Running back Reggie Yarbrough rushed for 109 yards in 27 carries, the junior's 
fifth 100-yard effort of the season. 
</P>
<P>
But Fullerton (1-6, 0-3 in the Big West Conference) couldn't keep pace with 
Pacific (2-4, 1-3). After the Titans cut Pacific's lead to two in the third 
quarter, Kopp threw touchdown passes to Daryl Hobbs (nine yards) and Aaron 
Turner (12) to make it 47-31. 
</P>
<P>
Yarbrough's three-yard touchdown run on the last play of the third quarter made 
it 47-37, but Hobbs scored on an eight-yard shovel pass from Kopp and Pacific 
cornerback Troy Reeves intercepted a deflected pass and returned it 68 yards 
for a touchdown to make it 61-37 with 10:08 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Kopp's other touchdown passes went to former Orange Coast College 
receiver Melvin Johnson, and two went to Turner. Johnson caught eight passes 
for 92 yards, Turner caught six for 120 yards, former St. John Bosco standout 
Oscar Meza caught six for 97 yards, and Hobbs caught six for 54 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Steve Mehl, a 23-year-old freshman who played four seasons in the 
Chicago White Sox organization, caught six passes for 151 yards and a touchdown 
and added 127 yards rushing in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, the way our offense is, it could be like this every 
week," said Kopp, who threw for 415 yards in the Tigers' last game, a 37-28 
loss to Nevada Las Vegas Sept. 29. "No matter what the coverage, we have plays 
to beat it." 
</P>
<P>
Harris, a former Tennessee offensive coordinator in his second season at 
Pacific, scrapped the wishbone offense for the no-huddle, pass-happy attack the 
Tigers now employ. Kopp calls all plays at the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Pacific often split three receivers to one side of the field, and the 
Titans countered with five or six defensive backs in man-to-man coverage. Kopp 
took advantage by hitting Turner repeatedly on fade patterns, lofting the ball 
over cornerback Nuygen Pendleton and letting Turner run underneath the ball for 
the catch. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers used that play five times in the first half, and two went for 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we knew what they were doing and they'd still complete the pass," 
Pendleton said. "That got us down and the whole defense was frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
As Fullerton concentrated even more on the wide receivers in the second 
quarter, Kopp began throwing passes to Mehl, his running back, over the middle. 
On one play, Kopp dumped a five-yard pass to Mehl, who turned it into a 78-yard 
play to the Fullerton one-yard line. The Tigers also hurt the Titans with an 
occasional draw play. 
</P>
<P>
"When you can't stop them over and over again and you've tried everything, you 
feel pretty helpless," Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said. "I don't know if 
there's anything else we could have done." 
</P>
<P>
Kopp broke Paul Berner's Pacific record of 446 yards passing in a game, set in 
1984 against Fullerton. It marked Pacific's fifth-highest point total in school 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific also set Cal State Fullerton opponent records for passing yards, total 
offense, pass completions and touchdown passes. The Titans have allowed more 
points only once, in a 70-0 loss at Southern Mississippi in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
And when it seemed the season couldn't get any worse for Fullerton, the Titans 
sank to new depths Saturday. The loss extended Fullerton's losing streak to 
six, the Titans' longest ever. 
</P>
<P>
They entered the game ranked 103rd by USA Today (Pacific was 102nd), and they 
can't go much lower -- there are only 106 Division I-A teams. 
</P>
<P>
With a trip to Hawaii next week, then games against Cal State Long Beach, San 
Jose State and Utah State, there are no sure victories for Fullerton. The 
Titans' season finale against 106th-ranked New Mexico State could be for 
basement bragging rights. 
</P>
<P>
And to compound matters, Murphy, whose defense was without starting linebacker 
Clarence Siler and linemen Dave Dorf and Jamal Jones, received a discouraging 
injury report after the game. 
</P>
<P>
Offensive lineman John Cotti injured his knee and will miss one to three games; 
tight end Damond Hogan separated his shoulder and will miss one or two games; 
linebacker Stan Breland (knee), nose guard Gary Thornton (back), rover Dan 
Seymour (calf) and offensive tackle Mike Simmons (ankle) are questionable for 
next week's game. 
</P>
<P>
Kicker/punter Phil Nevin, who missed Saturday's game because of pneumonia, will 
probably miss at least one more game. 
</P>
<P>
"When it rains, it pours," Murphy said.

Eric Robinson got off a stretcher to lead a thrilling comeback Saturday as 
Fullerton College defeated El Camino, 31-24, in a Mission Conference game in 
front of about 4,000 at Fullerton District Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, a sophomore quarterback, was carried from the field with 10 minutes 
left. At that point El Camino appeared to have things well in hand and led, 
24-9. 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson sprinted back onto the field with six minutes left to help start 
an impressive three-touchdown rally. 
</P>
<P>
He had hurt his ankle, but after it was retaped by trainer Bill Chambers, he 
appeared healthy. Chambers said Robinson also complained of a sore back and 
dizziness when taken from the field, but he looked fine when he scored the 
game-winner with 29 seconds left on a 17-yard option play. 
</P>
<P>
"The weak side was open so I just took it," Robinson said " . . . I wasn't sure 
we could come back to win. I was thinking a tie." 
</P>
<P>
The winning drive was set up when Hornet Ward Van Pelt intercepted El Camino 
quarterback Rod Harvey at the Fullerton 23 with 2:19 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Hornets then drove 77 yards in five plays without a pass. One key play was 
Coy Collins' 22-yard gain on a reverse. On the next play, Johnny Mountain went 
31 yards on a delay to give Fullerton a first down at the El Camino 17. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson scored on the next play and Eric Lange's extra point gave Fullerton a 
31-24 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The victory keeps Fullerton (5-0, 4-0) the only undefeated team in the 16-team 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
The comeback started when Brian Williams scored on a three-yard run with 5:36 
left to play to cut the lead to 24-16 after Lange kicked the extra point. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino then helped the Fullerton cause when Harvey fumbled on third down at 
the Warrior seven. Toby Howell recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Williams scored on the next play with 4:23 left and Fullerton lined up to go 
for two points and the tie. Robinson rolled in with ease and the score was 
tied, 24-24, with 4:23 left. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino then started on a drive it never figured to have to make to win. The 
Warriors (4-2, 2-2) got as far as the Fullerton 28 before Van Pelt's 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, which leads the conference in rushing with 290 yards per game, had 
330. Mountain had with 123 yards in nine carries. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino quarterback Harvey was 26 of 52 for 387 yards and two first-half 
touchdowns. But his two turnovers in the second half allowed Fullerton, the 
second-ranked team in the J.C. Grid-Wire national poll, to remain undefeated.

BOBSLEDDING: WHAT BEGAN AS A LARK HAS TURNED INTO A SERIOUS PURSUIT FOR UCLA 
DECATHLETE CHRIS CONRAD.

Chris Conrad had his doubts, the kind of doubts that will crinkle a nose and 
turn a mouth downward at the corners. 
</P>
<P>
"There must be something fishy about this," he thought. 
</P>
<P>
Run a few sprints, do a vertical jump, heave a shotput underhanded and complete 
another leaping drill and you get an expenses-paid trip to the Olympic training 
center at Lake Placid, N.Y.? 
</P>
<P>
Work out there for a couple of weeks and go to Germany? 
</P>
<P>
Take a semester off of school, tour Europe and find yourself one step from the 
1992 Winter Olympics at Albertville, France? 
</P>
<P>
Well, OK . . . Introducing the sport of bobsledding, folks. 
</P>
<P>
"Not knowing anything about bobsledding, I figured there have to be some people 
who do this seriously," said Conrad, a UCLA decathlete who went to Mater Dei 
High School and attended UC Irvine for a year before transferring. 
</P>
<P>
Some people are, but they are not the ones who make the U.S. national team. It 
is peopled by the likes of Olympic hurdler Edwin Moses of Newport Beach. Among 
those who've tried to make it were Willie Gault, who caused a controversy when 
he joined the Olympic team shortly before the Calgary Games in 1988, and 
Herschel Walker, who spent a day in Lake Placid last week demonstrating that he 
can push a sled with the best of them. 
</P>
<P>
The team is made up of elite athletes, whether they be stars of the NFL or the 
track circuit, a one-time UCLA safety named Jeff Woodard or a softball star 
named James (Bubba) Womack from Brunswick, Ga., who never played college 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
It requires no familiarity with ice, but demands sprinter's speed, strength and 
technique. Conrad, 21, is one of 12 men chosen for the 1990-91 USA bobsled team 
from a first-time national talent search, a scouring of the nation to seek out 
well-conditioned athletes who might be able to bring the United States its 
first Olympic medal in the sport since a 1956 bronze. 
</P>
<P>
It began, of course, as a lark. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad and UC Irvine's Marc Kallick, a couple of college decathletes, were 
participating in a track meet at Cal State Long Beach late last spring trying 
to improve their scores when they saw a flier: Try out for the U.S. bobsledding 
team training camp. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of funny at first -- the Road to Albertville," Conrad said, 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
They went to a tryout at Rancho Santiago College in June, one of 12 national 
sites where six-item physical fitness tests were conducted. 
</P>
<P>
They ran three sprints -- 30, 60 and 100 meters. Their vertical jump was 
measured, as was their distance in five consecutive hops. They tossed a 
shotput, two-handed. 
</P>
<P>
"Excellent for decathletes and the kind of training you do," Conrad said. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad, Kallick, former Irvine sprinter Will Stolpe and former Fullerton 
College and Texas Tech track athlete and wide receiver Clifford Mack of Laguna 
Niguel were among about 100 athletes invited to Lake Placid as a result of the 
national tryouts. 
</P>
<P>
Stolpe decided not to make the trip. The other three left in late August for a 
week of training, a week break and a week of competition. Conrad made the team, 
after finishing among the top competitors in the National Push Championships, a 
dry-track simulation of the beginning of a bobsled race. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I'd go back and stay at the Olympic training center, get a little of 
the Olympic flavor," Conrad said. 
</P>
<P>
But he kept excelling. 
</P>
<P>
"It was surprise after surprise for me," he said. "I went in cold. My whole 
life, I'd probably watched less than an hour of bobsledding on TV. . . . It's 
funny, it is funny, but it's serious, too. They're real serious." 
</P>
<P>
Now he is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I got more kidding before I went than since I came back," Conrad said. 
"Everyone's real excited for me." 
</P>
<P>
He will leave Oct. 20 for Calgary, Canada, and continue on to a European tour 
that will include competitions at Innsbruck, Austria, Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, and 
Albertville.

"It's been a weird six weeks," Conrad said last week after a solitary workout 
at UC Irvine, where he trains while living at his parents' house in San Juan 
Capistrano. "It sure is boggling my mind." 
</P>
<P>
He will skip fall classes at UCLA, but said he plans to return for the next 
quarter in order to maintain his eligibility and compete during the track 
season next spring. 
</P>
<P>
After an injury-marred season last year in which he fell about 200 points shy 
of the provisional qualifying mark of 7,250 points for the decathlon in the 
NCAA championships, he is determined to make the NCAA field before his 
eligibility expires. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my goal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad, who is 6 feet 1, 180 pounds and will be a junior this season, has long 
jumped 23 feet 11, thrown the javelin 201 feet, and has a personal best of 
10.88 seconds in the 100 -- although he was timed at 10.77 in the bobsled 
tryout. 
</P>
<P>
He will return to Lake Placid sometime next year for the Olympic trials, which 
have not yet been formally announced. U.S. bobsled officials said they hope to 
select a team of 12 in March from a group of about 20 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. bobsled official said making the team this year does not make Conrad a 
lock for the Olympic team, partly because of the possibility of a late influx 
of elite athletes from other sports, such as Walker. But he is no outsider, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it looks real good," Conrad said. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, he will enjoy the experience of international competition. He has 
been assigned to a sled with Moses, Womack and driver Brian Shimer -- 
three-fourths of the team that set a track record in winning the recent 
International Push Championships at Konigsee, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
It all started with a few sprints, some jumping and a shotput toss at Rancho 
Santiago College. Before long he'll be hobnobbing and bobbing with Moses, and 
perhaps Gault and Walker before he's done. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good feeling," Conrad said. "They're excellent, excellent athletes. 
They're elite athletes and well-known. All I can say is it's good to be able to 
compete and not get blown away."

THE PEN IS MIGHTIER THAN THE PIANO; 
</P>
<P>
BEST-SELLING AUTHOR MARCEL MONTECINO REGRETS THAT HE NEVER COMPOSED A HIT SONG 
WHEN HE WAS A STRUGGLING MUSICIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, Marcel Montecino exchanged the piano for the pen, and took off 
on his Hollywood honeymoon: 
</P>
<P>
* First novel, "The Crosskiller," 900,000 copies printed, a best-seller. 
</P>
<P>
* First screenplay, "Improper Conduct," bought by Jaffee-Lansing Productions 
for $250,000; the film is scheduled to be released next year. 
</P>
<P>
* Second novel, "Big Time," published in August with its movie rights already 
purchased for $1 million by Tom Cruise. 
</P>
<P>
"I can spit on a piece of paper," said Montecino, 45, of West Los Angeles, "and 
someone will give me $50,000." 
</P>
<P>
He paused, as if expecting Federal Express to arrive with an immediate check. 
Things have gone that well. 
</P>
<P>
Not too shabby for a piano player who, until 1988, was working the bar mitzvah 
circuit, collecting $100 a night and waiting for the hit song that was going to 
propel him into stardom. But the closest he got to fame during his music days 
was playing for five years at Budd Friedman's Improv in Hollywood. Robin 
Williams and Jay Leno worked there and made it big. Marcel Montecino just 
worked there. 
</P>
<P>
"I was miserable," he recalled. "It wasn't happening." 
</P>
<P>
So he turned to his other creative craft -- writing. He used to write a lot in 
his youth, he said, but gave it up to experience life. "I didn't know what I 
wanted to say." 
</P>
<P>
He spent the '70s in a daze, high, still not ready to record his thoughts. 
Finally, when the '80s drew to a close, Montecino discovered his literary 
voice, fine-tuned by years of hard living on the streets. He had played piano 
in a Mississippi brothel, losing his virginity to a blackjack dealer. He worked 
in bands up and down Bourbon Street in New Orleans. Finally he knew what he 
wanted to say. 
</P>
<P>
"I call my books dark novels, not thrillers," said Montecino. "I like to 
explore the dark side of the human psyche. The dark side is right below the 
surface for everyone. How many of us contemplate suicide every day?" 
</P>
<P>
Montecino's characters are not heroic; "I don't think any of us are heroes." 
Rather, they are ordinary characters, who, trapped in extraordinary situations, 
rise above their limitations. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has difficult times, and somehow finds a way to do what's 
necessary." 
</P>
<P>
In "Crosskiller," a Jewish cop hunts down a neo-Nazi serial murderer in West 
Los Angeles; in "Big Time," a New Orleans piano player has to run all over the 
world to escape the Mob, and can't pursue his dream of fame because he knows 
recognition would kill him; and in "Improper Conduct," a cop gets involved with 
a rich woman who leads him astray. 
</P>
<P>
His dialogue holds little back, filled with sexual references and profanities, 
the kind of realism that attracted producer Sherry Lansing. "It's gritty and 
gutty," Lansing said. "He creates characters that are totally believable. He's 
one of the most talented writers I've ever worked with." 
</P>
<P>
Even today, Montecino insists, as his lifestyle undergoes changes he never 
anticipated -- he's about to buy a house in Pacific Palisades -- he claims he's 
not far removed from his modest beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
He grew up in a lower-class Louisiana family with his aunt and uncle -- both 
parents died before he was 8. He attended high school owning only two shirts. 
His aunt and uncle, however, saved enough money to afford his $1.50 piano 
lesson once a week. His practice paid dividends, and after receiving a music 
scholarship to Southeastern Louisiana State College, he seemed ready to pursue 
his dream. 
</P>
<P>
But Montecino, always impatient, left college after one year. "I couldn't spend 
the next three years eating one hot dog a day. I hated school. I wanted to 
start life." 
</P>
<P>
And so he did, often losing control, taking at least 45 grams of amphetamines 
every night. Most of the money he earned playing music was squandered in 
illegal gambling houses. "I wouldn't quit even if I made 10 times my 
investment," he said. "I wanted to win the house." 
</P>
<P>
He recalled with amusement the night he slept with the blackjack dealer and 
feared for his life. "She took this gun out of her glove compartment and put it 
in her purse," he said. "She brought it inside. I didn't know what to think." 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, he moved to Los Angeles, ready to make his impact on the national 
music scene. Along with his wife, Montecino wrote dozens of songs, paying the 
rent with his piano job at the Improv. The couple separated in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
After all his success in writing books and screenplays, Montecino still regrets 
not landing the hit song. "It broke my heart," he said. "I haven't played the 
piano in two years, but eventually, I'll go back." 
</P>
<P>
Montecino, never lacking in confidence, received a big boost when he took a 
UCLA Extension course in novel writing in 1985. By then he had written about 70 
pages of "The Crosskiller." He showed it to a teacher and classmates who told 
him to go home and finish it. "I knew then I could write novels." 
</P>
<P>
When Montecino finished "Crosskiller," he took it to get copied. He told his 
wife he would be lucky if he got an agent within a year, but "when I got home, 
there was a call on the answering machine from someone in the UCLA class. I had 
an agent three days later, and a publisher a month after that." 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't as self-assured about screenplays, so the immediate success of 
"Improper Conduct" stunned even him. So far, he derives more satisfaction from 
his novels, but eagerly awaits the release of the movie. "They give you a lot 
of money, and they can do what they want," he said. "They could turn it into a 
milk carton. With novels, you have that total amount of freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his fortune, Montecino took a long time to regard himself as a true 
writer. "I used to tell people that I was a piano player who writes. Writing 
was something other people did. I went through this period of not knowing who I 
was. People who used to be names in magazines became friends of mine, Hollywood 
friends to be sure. But now I know I'm a writer." 
</P>
<P>
And a prolific one. He is busy working on a new screenplay, and says he knows 
the contents of his next four books. He claims his screenplay -- a story about 
post-Vietnam days in Bayou country -- isn't commercial. 
</P>
<P>
But, with typical confidence, he replied: "Somebody will buy it."

ART NOTEBOOK: FOLK ART GALLERY BLENDS BLUE-CHIP ARTISTS WITH THE NAIVE UNKNOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISBET NILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting Outside-in, Liz Blackman's gallery of 20th-Century American folk and 
"outsider" art, used to take some doing. The gallery was in a converted 
townhouse on a residential street in West Hollywood and was open by 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Blackman moved to let more of the outside world in: She reopened 
her gallery in a storefront on a colorful block of Melrose Avenue, just east of 
La Brea. 
</P>
<P>
Blackman is a former reporter who fell in love with folk art during an 
assignment and became first a collector, then a dealer. She handles naive, 
figurative work by self-taught artists, who developed far from art schools and 
the art scene. Within the broad category of folk art, she said, she is less 
likely to represent the work of what she termed "memory painters" such as 
Grandma Moses. Her penchant is for "outsider art," which she describes as "more 
visceral, more eccentric than traditional folk art -- the product of personal 
vision rather than experience." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Outside-in fairly bristles with personal visions. A wooden 
tick-tack-toe set by Constance Roberts, for instance, graphically pits 
hand-carved vices against virtues. The vices are represented by a gambler's 
hand of cards (complete with one up the sleeve), an expired parking meter, a 
passel of french fries and an overdue library book. Arrayed against them are a 
bottle of cod liver oil, a bunch of flowers for mom, a box of Quaker Oats and a 
signed check for the needy. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, in a piece by R. A. Miller, an American flag painted on corrugated 
metal bears the inscription, "You can't burn this flag." Artist Purvis Young 
has produced a pair of paintings in black on the footboard and headboard of a 
white crib. And in "Batman, Batwoman," Michael Rogers has sculpted a baseball 
bat into a totem that is subtly male on one side, female on the other. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm trying to do is mix some of the blue-chip artists who are very well 
known" -- artists such as Mose Tolliver, David Butler and the Rev. Howard 
Finster -- "with the work of lesser-known artists whose work is consistent," 
Blackman said. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, relatively few of the artists in Blackman's stable are from Los 
Angeles, or even from California. They are more likely to live in isolated 
rural areas, where there is less information overload -- and more time to 
devote to a personal craft. "In L.A. it's a luxury even to have a hobby," 
Blackman said. 
</P>
<P>
But just opening her more public space has brought several L.A. artists to her 
door and to her attention. The signature lizard above Outside-in's entry, for 
instance, was executed by Aubrey Selden, a local artist who just wandered by 
one day. 
</P>
<P>
"There must be some treasures out there," Blackman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside-in, 6909 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles. (213) 657-6369. Open from 11 a.m. 
to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A STICKLER FOR STICKLEY: One of the most intriguing differences between a 
museum exhibition and a gallery show -- when both address the same topic -- is 
that the gallery material is generally for sale. In other words, you could 
conceivably buy it, bring it home, even touch it. 
</P>
<P>
That is part of the appeal of "Arts and Crafts in America" at the Bryce 
Bannatyne Gallery in Santa Monica, which complements the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art's recently opened exhibition "American Arts and Crafts: Virtue in 
Design." 
</P>
<P>
The Bannatyne show includes less European material than its museum counterpart, 
but it is ambitious in its attempt to evoke the arts and crafts movement as "a 
whole environment, not just as single pieces of furniture," Bannatyne said. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, the exhibition includes not just significant tables, chairs and 
cabinets by Gustav Stickley, Frank Lloyd Wright, Greene &amp; Greene and their 
peers. Also on view are ceramics from potteries such as the Grueby Faience Co., 
original lighting fixtures by Greene &amp; Greene and others, as well as 
textiles and paintings of the period. 
</P>
<P>
Like the LACMA exhibition -- which is publicized with a photograph of a 
handsome ceramic fireplace surround -- the Bannatyne show even includes a tile 
fireplace. Made in 1901-02 by the Grueby Faience Co., it once stood in a home 
in Duluth, Minn. Bannatyne located it -- disassembled and boxed -- in a New 
Jersey basement. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are the days, however, when casual collectors could make such discoveries 
at flea markets and buy them for a song. And prices for important signed pieces 
in the Bannatyne show can run deep into five figures, even into six. "Over the 
last 10 to 12 years, prices have started to escalate and the collector base has 
broadened -- we're now even starting to see things go to Europe and the 
Orient," Bannatyne said. 
</P>
<P>
But he resists attempts to characterize the new-found popularity of arts and 
crafts furniture as fashion or fad. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see it as trendy. I look at the Santa Fe interior-decorator movement 
as trendy, because there's no historical basis for it -- it's primarily style," 
Bannatyne said. "With Stickley and the arts and crafts movement, you're really 
dealing with an important movement in history." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the commanding simplicity of the furniture even tends to have a 
strong impact on the lives of the people who choose to live with it today. 
</P>
<P>
"The furniture itself can be very imposing," he said. "But when people really 
start to look at it, they have to take a closer look at themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"It just forces you to pare your life down," Bannatyne said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arts and Crafts in America," through Oct. 25 at the Bryce Bannatyne Gallery, 
604 Colorado Ave., Santa Monica. (213) 396-9668. Open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
Tuesday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 SCENIC SENDAK: When the Los Angeles Music Center opened its recent production 
of Mozart's "Idomeneo" with scenery and costumes designed by Maurice Sendak, 
the gallery Every Picture Tells a Story threw a party -- and threw open an 
exhibition -- in Sendak's honor. 
</P>
<P>
Sendak, of course, is a near-legendary children's book author and illustrator. 
During the past 10 years, he has been crossing over into the adult reaches of 
opera design. "Idomeneo," he has said, is his favorite opera by his favorite 
composer. 
</P>
<P>
Every Picture Tells a Story is a gallery of original art from children's books. 
But one aspect of its approach, too, is "trying to break down the barrier of 
what needs to be for children and what for adults," according to Abbie 
Phillips, one of the gallery's owners. 
</P>
<P>
Through Oct. 28 the main gallery is festooned with the original set and costume 
designs for "Idomeneo," complete with monsters, seascapes and threatening 
skies. None of the watercolors or drawings are for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the show are children's book illustrations by artists that Sendak 
himself admires, Phillips said. Among them are Richard Egielski, William Joyce, 
Robert Rayevsky and Laurent de Brunhoff (of Babar fame). 
</P>
<P>
Sendak does not often exhibit his work in a gallery setting; for Every Picture 
Tells a Story, the Sendak show is something of a coup. For the gallery's 
owners, it also seems to be a personal thrill. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up with all his images. In a way, he's responsible for my starting this 
gallery," Phillips said. "I don't think what he does is all just warm and fuzzy 
little bears -- he's showing children in all their complexity. That's related 
to what we're trying to do with the gallery." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Original Art of Idomeneo, by Maurice Sendak," through Oct. 28 at Every 
Picture Tells a Story, 836 N. La Brea, Los Angeles. (213) 962-5420. Open from 
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday, and noon to 5 p.m. Sunday.

SALE OF RACIST BOOKS ANGERS YAROSLAVSKY; 
</P>
<P>
ANTI-SEMITISM: A VENDOR OFFERED THE TWO BOOKS DURING LAST MONTH'S AFRICAN 
MARKETPLACE. THE COUNCILMAN WANTS TO PREVENT OR DISCOURAGE THE SALE OF SUCH 
OFFENSIVE MATERIALS AT PUBLICLY FUNDED EVENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a sharply worded letter to the head of the city's Cultural Affairs 
Department, City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky criticized the sale of two 
anti-Semitic books by a vendor at last month's city-sponsored African 
Marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky's two-page letter asked Adolfo Nodal, cultural affairs general 
manager, to come up with ways to prevent or discourage the future sale of such 
offensive materials at publicly funded events. 
</P>
<P>
The books, "The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem" by the late 
auto maker Henry Ford Sr. and "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion," which 
originated out of czarist Russia, have been widely discredited for portraying 
Jews as the masterminds behind a sinister plot to take over the world. Adolf 
Hitler used the books to advance his own racist theories. 
</P>
<P>
"The sale of these books at a city cultural event, in support of which the 
taxpayers have allocated $43,000, is an affront not only to the Jewish 
community but to all who abhor racism and treasure tolerance," wrote 
Yaroslavsky in a Sept. 19 letter to Nodal. Copies of the letter were sent to 
seven Jewish organizations, Mayor Tom Bradley, the city Human Relations 
Commission and the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Both Nodal and members of The Friends of the William Grant Still Art Center, 
the volunteer organizers of the city's African Marketplace and Cultural Faire, 
agree that the books are repugnant. But they voiced doubt about whether a ban 
on selling them at city-sponsored festivals would work. 
</P>
<P>
"We are also very concerned about the First Amendment issues that this 
situation brings up, and the need to allow for freedom of expression no matter 
how scurrilous and misguided it may be," Nodal wrote in response. 
</P>
<P>
"It is true these are disreputable, ugly books, and we don't condone the books 
in any way, but it would be a basic violation of freedom of expression to say 
that the books could not be sold," said Muriel Crowe, a member of the William 
Grant Still Art Center. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky wrote the letter after receiving three complaints last month from 
constituents that the offending books were being sold by Eso Won Bookstore, a 
Los Angeles store that specializes in books for and about African Americans. 
The two publications were among about 500 books that Eso Won -- one of 20 
bookstore vendors at the event -- had on display. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't understand what the problem is. If there was something I saw and 
didn't like, I wouldn't buy it," said James Fugate, a co-owner of Eso Won. "I 
have never read the book, but we keep it in stock because we have received so 
many requests for it. Besides, the books are not illegal. They are even in the 
library." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said the bookstore has a right to sell whatever it wants, but not 
at the city's expense. "The question is, are they serving a market or trying to 
create a market," he said. "I doubt there is much interest in that book in this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
In just five years the African Marketplace has grown from a small street fair 
with two vendors outside the William Grant Still Center into a major cultural 
event celebrating what promotional materials called "the African Diaspora, and 
the influences of African culture." At this year's African Marketplace, more 
than 150,000 people turned out to see about 2,000 performers and shop among the 
more than 200 vendors. Each vendor paid a $450 fee to the city for the right to 
display goods and serve food over two weekends, from Aug. 25 to Sept. 3, at 
Rancho Cienega Park. 
</P>
<P>
"It has taken a lot of hard work by a lot of dedicated people to make the 
African Marketplace a fixture in Los Angeles," said James V. Burks, the 
director of the city's performing arts division, who founded the marketplace. 
"We hope that one day it will grow into a permanent fixture in Los Angeles like 
Little Tokyo, Chinatown or the Farmers Market." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the marketplace said they have never allowed people to use the 
festival as a soapbox to express offensive political beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
"That is not what we are trying to do," said Clinton Simmons, another member of 
the Friends of the William Grant Still Art Center. He complained that 
Yaroslavsky might have resolved the issue without tainting the festival with 
the charge of anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
"He is trying to discredit the African Marketplace by linking it with 
anti-Semitism," Simmons said. "If he had a problem with the way the marketplace 
was being run, why didn't he come to us instead of sending it out to all those 
organizations?" 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said he sent copies of his letters to Jewish organizations because 
they are interested in the book and because several groups had already been 
contacted about the sale of the book at the festival. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an attack on the African Marketplace," Yaroslavsky said. "It's an 
attack on a book that has no business being given credibility and sanction by 
the city of Los Angeles. There are a lot of people who feel very strongly about 
this book and I'm one. My parents were victimized in pogroms by the people who 
believed in the crap that is spewed in 'The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nodal said he was shocked and saddened after reading parts of the two books, 
which one of his staff had checked out of the Los Angeles Public Library. "It 
is devastating to witness firsthand the hatred, ignorance and false premises 
that these books represent," he wrote Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
However, as an alternative to banning the book outright, Nodal said he is 
considering a number of recommendations, including warnings that the city may 
not endorse all views expressed at the festival. He said he is also considering 
setting up committees of vendors to regulate themselves. Another option, he 
added, is to provide the opportunity for rebuttal for those groups that have 
been offended. 
</P>
<P>
Nodal said he plans to meet with Yaroslavsky this week to discuss these and 
other recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said the issues involved in the sale of anti-Semitic books are of 
concern not just to Jews. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Anti-Defamation League (of B'nai B'rith) had been selling books by 
William Shockley (whose theories that blacks are intellectually inferior have 
angered many) at a festival, the issue would have been raised and rightfully 
so," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Though some have expressed fear that Yaroslavsky's letter was a veiled threat 
to cut funding for the marketplace, the councilman said that was never his 
intention. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never suggested the city use its financial leverage in this area," he 
said. "But others may or will. Some people in Los Angeles would raise concerns. 
I would rather do it through education and understanding. . . . It is important 
that these boils are lanced early and not allowed to get out of control." 
</P>
<P>
The belief that city funds should not be used at events where hate literature 
is sold was supported by both the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the 
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. 
</P>
<P>
"It is inappropriate to disseminate hate material at any event where public 
funds are used," said David Lehrer, director of the Anti-Defamation League. 
"People still have their First Amendment rights, but not when tax funds are 
making it possible." 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said "The 
Protocols of the Elders of Zion" and "The International Jew" are "two leading 
books in the paranoia of hate." He said that in recent years the books have 
been experiencing a resurgence of popularity, particularly in the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
"These books have an amazing shelf life," he said. "On a recent trip to Japan I 
saw 'The Protocols of Zion' in two bookstores. . . . They are the perfect kind 
of book for people who don't want to be confused by the facts." 
</P>
<P>
"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion" claims to be the minutes of secret 
meetings of a Jewish conclave in the last years of the 19th Century. It has 
been described by anti-Semites as proof of a Jewish plot to take over world 
governments, banking and other institutions. The book has long been 
discredited, but it continues to surface in the hands of those who claim it is 
fact. 
</P>
<P>
Auto magnate Henry Ford published a compilation of anti-Semitic articles that 
had been printed in his magazine, "The Dearborn Independent," between 1920 and 
1922. The book, "The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem," outlines 
what he alleged was "Jewish control" over all aspects of life in the United 
States, including government, banking and labor. Ford later repudiated the 
book. 
</P>
<P>
As a measure of how controversial the books are, neither includes the name of 
the publisher or distributor. James Fugate, the owner of Eso Won Bookstore, 
would not identify his supplier. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the books in the Eso Won Bookstore directly relate to African-American 
culture, history, arts and thought, with a large section devoted to Islamic 
philosophy. The store also has a small section on Jews and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"Blacks have always been interested in Jews," Fugate said. "They are perceived 
as a successful minority in this country that has done well." The section 
includes such titles as "Israel and South Africa," by Donald Will and Sheila 
Ryan and published by Africa World Press, and "Empire of Their Own . . . How 
the Jews Invented Hollywood," by Neal Gabler and published by Doubleday 
Publishing. 
</P>
<P>
Eso Won is no stranger to controversy. Most recently, it has received numerous 
complaints about Shahazad Ali's book, "The Blackman's Guide to Understanding 
the Blackwoman." That book, in which the author advises the black man to 
"soundly slap" the black woman if she ignores his authority and superiority, 
has been burned, banned and boycotted around the country. Although the Eso Won 
owners decided to stock the book and to sponsor a book party for the author, 
they say they don't necessarily agree with her point of view.

UNITED AGAINST DIABETES; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: A NEW $1-MILLION FACILITY IN CENTURY CITY PROVIDES EVERYTHING A 
DIABETIC NEEDS TO COPE WITH THE DISEASE, ALL UNDER ONE ROOF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When actress Jean Smart does a play, she hides glucose tablets all over the 
set. 
</P>
<P>
She keeps the tablets nearby in case her blood sugar takes a sudden dip under 
the stress of performance. 
</P>
<P>
Best known for playing Charlene on the TV series, "Designing Women," Smart is 
one of a million insulin-dependent diabetics in the United States. Smart, who 
has been giving herself daily insulin injections since she found out that she 
had the disease at the age of 13, is free of the devastating complications that 
diabetes can inflict -- in fact, she's never had to gulp even one of her hidden 
glucose tablets. 
</P>
<P>
But the actress knows what it is like to live with the chronic disease, which 
is why she spoke last week at the opening of a new Diabetes Management &amp; 
Research Center on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
An outpatient facility of Century City Hospital, the $1-million center is the 
only one of its kind in Southern California. Offering everything from support 
groups for diabetic senior citizens to a small but fully equipped gym, the 
center is a place where "all the needs of people with diabetes and their 
families can be attended to under one roof," Medical Director Sherman M. Holvey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Holvey and physician Patrick Soon-Shiong, the center has a staff 
of eight, including a nutritionist, an exercise physiologist and a 
psychotherapist. 
</P>
<P>
Such a facility is long overdue, Holvey said. 
</P>
<P>
Diabetes, he explained, is a chronic disease in which the body does not produce 
or properly use insulin, a hormone needed to convert food into energy. It 
afflicts more than 12 million people in the United States, almost half of whom 
don't even know they have it. When uncontrolled, it can cause terrible 
complications, including blindness, kidney disease, nerve damage, heart disease 
and impaired blood circulation that can lead to amputation. Impotence is a 
common complication in males. And every year 150,000 people die of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Holvey said the center does not wish to replace the patient's regular 
physician. But it does operate with the view that the diabetic is the one who 
must ultimately cope with the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
"The patient has to be responsible on a day-to-day basis for controlling their 
own disease," Holvey said. "What this center offers is a place where diabetics 
can be comfortable and develop life skills they need to live a healthy life. 
They can't lead a normal life, but it can be a healthy life." 
</P>
<P>
Education is one of the center's functions. On a recent Friday morning, 
fourth-graders from a Carson elementary school toured the facility. They heard 
talks about the role that diet and exercise play in controlling diabetes and 
learned the warning signs, including rapid weight loss and frequent urination. 
</P>
<P>
One of their classmates, 10-year-old Evette Rojas, is an insulin-dependent 
diabetic. Like Jean Smart, she has the less common but more severe form of the 
disease, in which the body does not produce any insulin on its own, perhaps 
because of an autoimmune reaction. (In the more common form, which typically 
develops in overweight people over 40, insulin is produced but not utilized in 
the normal way.) 
</P>
<P>
Evette, who grimaces at the thought of injecting her own insulin, gets a daily 
injection administered by her mother. Evette says diabetes isn't so bad "except 
when people eat candy in front of me, like my brother." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to hearing about diabetes, the children had a chance to experience 
the complex decision-making process diabetics go through as they juggle food, 
exercise and insulin. The children took turns sitting in front of a video 
display terminal playing what looked like just another computer game. 
</P>
<P>
The ostensible object of the computerized exercise was to keep an airplane on 
the screen from crashing to earth. But the real object was to give the child a 
vivid sense of the maneuvering a person with diabetes must do to maintain 
normal blood glucose levels. The game is called BG (for blood glucose) Pilot. 
</P>
<P>
According to Renee Brandon, a registered nurse who is the center's program 
director, people can come to the center for a whole range of services. They may 
want to get instruction in the latest methods for monitoring their blood sugar 
and administering insulin. They may want detailed information on how to bring 
their weight down and the foods they should or should not eat (the center 
includes a test kitchen). Older diabetics may want advice on how they can 
exercise safely. Diabetic women who are considering pregnancy may want 
counseling before they try. 
</P>
<P>
Smart said pregnancy and diabetes is a special interest of hers. The actress 
said many diabetic women are advised to not even think about becoming pregnant 
because of the potential risks both to themselves and their fetuses. Smart, who 
delivered a healthy boy almost a year ago, was advised by one doctor to 
terminate her pregnancy because of her diabetes. Instead, she said, she 
realized it was time for her to get on top of her disease. "I had no choice," 
she said. "I had a baby inside me." 
</P>
<P>
Smart began testing her blood -- not one or two times a day but 12 -- sometimes 
getting up at 4 in the morning to make sure her blood glucose level was as 
close to normal as possible. As a result, throughout her pregnancy, she said, 
"my blood sugars averaged the same or a little lower than my husband's." 
</P>
<P>
Psychological counseling and support is also available at the center. 
Compliance -- or doing what one must do to keep the disease under control -- is 
often a problem, according to staff psychotherapist Barbara Dybnis. Compliance 
can be especially tough for teen-agers. "Engineers make great people with 
diabetes because they love those numbers to be in order," she said. "Teen-agers 
don't." 
</P>
<P>
Teen-age diabetics may wonder whether they should tell their dates about their 
condition. Parents of diabetics may need help in dealing with their guilt about 
causing a child pain during necessary injections or may seek advice on dealing 
with offspring who resent the attention given a diabetic sibling. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most unusual features of the center is its gym, staff members said. 
Holvey said the health community has become increasingly aware that 
non-insulin-dependent diabetes can be as serious a disease in terms of its 
consequences as the juvenile-onset type. And yet, non-insulin-dependent 
diabetes can often be controlled through diet and exercise alone. 
</P>
<P>
The gym at the center is supervised by exercise physiologist Claudia Graham, 
who is diabetic. Diabetics need to approach exercise in an informed way, Graham 
said. Individuals with diabetes-related retinal damage, for instance, should 
avoid certain kinds of weightlifting because it could cause further damage. 
</P>
<P>
But Graham obviously believes diabetics can and should be active. She once 
trekked the Himalayas, carrying a cache of anti-nausea suppositories to make 
sure the altitude didn't cause her to lose the lunch she had so carefully 
countered with injected insulin. 
</P>
<P>
Graham said the gym can accommodate both the person who wants to exercise 
regularly in an atmosphere more hip to the needs of diabetics than the average 
health spa and the serious diabetic athlete who wants a challenge, but not at 
the cost of his or her health. 
</P>
<P>
An example: "We can take a diabetic athlete who wants to run the Boston 
marathon and teach him to train to use certain fuels." 
</P>
<P>
As Holvey pointed out, some people have an elevated risk of developing 
diabetes. There is a higher rate among African Americans than among whites. 
There is an especially high incidence among Latinos and American Indians, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
There is no cure for diabetes. But the center is working on that too. 
</P>
<P>
Some insulin-dependent diabetics have been able to stop insulin injections 
after receiving a pancreas transplant. Soon-Shiong, who heads the center's 
Islet Transplantation Center, is one of a number of scientists throughout the 
world who are studying an alternative procedure: the transplantation of only 
those cells in the pancreas, called islets, that secrete insulin. 
</P>
<P>
Soon-Shiong has been making progress toward lessening the likelihood that such 
cells will be rejected or destroyed after transplantation by placing them in a 
microcapsule before they are injected into the portal vein of the recipient. 
</P>
<P>
Results in animals have been encouraging, said Soon-Shiong, who praised the 
center as "a unique facility that can integrate clinical care and 
state-of-the-art research." 
</P>
<P>
The center is located at 9910 W. Pico Blvd., Suite 200. For further 
information, call (213) 551-1463.

DEVELOPMENT: THE COMMUNITY REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY'S LAST PUBLIC MEETING ON THE 
HOLLYWOOD PROJECT WAS RANCOROUS. NOW OLD FOES HOPE FOR THE BEST AND PREPARE FOR 
THE WORST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It may be an extremely ugly affair. 
</P>
<P>
Every two years, the seven commissioners of the Community Redevelopment Agency 
hold a public meeting to solicit input on the CRA's $922-million Hollywood 
redevelopment project, a beleaguered undertaking that has met with more 
opposition, scorn and bad publicity than perhaps any other project in the 
redevelopment agency's history. 
</P>
<P>
The next biennial meeting is set for Oct. 25 at 7 p.m., in the Blossom Room of 
the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, to allow the public to address the plan, its 
progress (or lack of it), and its problems. 
</P>
<P>
As the meeting approaches, some neighborhood activists are organizing, 
leafleting, making phone calls and canvassing door-to-door in a call to arms. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Hollywood boosters are fearing the worst, citing the chaos and rancor 
at the last biennial meeting, held in October, 1988, in the auditorium of 
Hollywood High School. 
</P>
<P>
At that meeting, "the anti-redevelopment junkies were out in force," Larry 
Kaplan, president of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, said in an open letter 
to chamber members. "They shouted down reasonable people . . . they insulted 
our leaders, impugned the integrity of the staff, patronized residents, and 
were just downright crude and unruly." 
</P>
<P>
"WE CANNOT," Kaplan wrote in boldface capital letters, "ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN 
AGAIN." 
</P>
<P>
In their organizing efforts, the anti-redevelopment forces have been "scaring 
well-intentioned business people and residents with wild tales akin to 
Sherman's march to the sea." 
</P>
<P>
But this time, like any good Hollywood sequel, the ending will be different, 
Kaplan predicts. Because this time, Hollywood boosters intend to fight back. 
</P>
<P>
"You fight fire with fire," Kaplan, a vocal booster of the revitalization 
effort, said in an interview last week. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber has sent flyers to its 1,500 members appealing to them to spread 
the word and show up at the meeting. Kaplan's personal letter has gone out to 
400 of the chamber's most active members, asking them to "be ready to speak 
loud and clear in favor of development." 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan, the former top aide to Councilman Michael Woo, said he plans to use all 
his organizing skills to marshal a significant pro-development side, to show 
the CRA that many in Hollywood support its efforts. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some activists who can barely contain their glee at the prospect 
of having a shot at the CRA officials for several uninterrupted hours. 
</P>
<P>
They will finally be permitted to seize the limelight and say things they have 
been saying in private for the last two years: that the redevelopment agency is 
failing in its job of redeveloping the city's faded movie capital. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to hearing them answer to us," said Laura Dodson, founder 
of the Beat Keepers neighborhood group and former leader of United Streets of 
Hollywood coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't done anything. But since they don't have any answers, I don't 
know what's going to happen," Dodson said. "I don't think anybody is going to 
get physically hurt. But I would not want to be in their shoes. Would you?" 
</P>
<P>
Citizens are permitted to address the CRA commissioners at their downtown 
meetings every few weeks, and there are other forums for public input. But the 
public is limited by time and by subject matter in those forums. 
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, several neighborhood groups have sued the 
redevelopment agency and the city to block the massive Hollywood project. Some, 
including members of the renegade Project Area Committee, say they have been 
illegally kept out of the process by the CRA and by City Councilman Michael 
Woo, who represents Hollywood. Woo replaced the committee last year with his 
handpicked group of advisers after calling it a "forum for wacky behavior." 
</P>
<P>
At the 1988 meeting, the first biennial meeting on the redevelopment project 
since its City Council approval in 1986, several speakers called the 
commissioners everything from drug dealers to fascists. Most, however, accused 
the agency of lying about specific development projects, catering to real 
estate interests, slighting preservation needs and forcing the 30-year 
redevelopment project on unwilling Hollywood residents. 
</P>
<P>
Many, if not all, of those concerns still exist and will be articulated, said 
Robert Nudelman, chairman of the Project Area Committee, which still meets. 
</P>
<P>
Of particular concern to some is the fate of the Project Area Committee itself, 
whose ouster by Woo, some critics say, is just one of many indications that the 
public is being left out of the redevelopment process. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the community's chance to talk, and the commissioners will have to 
listen," Nudelman said. "This is the only time the doors are open and the 
community can go down and address all the issues on Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
Donald Lippman, president of the Endangered Property Owners of Hollywood, said 
he intends to offer constructive criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people say what bad guys they are (at the CRA), how evil they are. 
But I want to point out several areas where they have done things illegally," 
said Lippman, whose group recently joined the Project Area Committee in its 
lawsuit against the CRA and the city. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the CRA say they hope the meeting takes on a more positive tone 
than the one in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA commissioners may try to preempt the crowd's anger by addressing some 
oft-articulated concerns, if not by downright apologizing, said CRA spokesman 
Marc Littman. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to acknowledge that the progress has not been what we would have 
liked," Littman said. "We'll be very candid about that. But there have been 
some successes." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Littman cited progress on a proposed $30-million Hollywood Galaxy 
commercial complex at the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Sycamore Avenue and 
a new $80-million KTLA-TV entertainment center that would replace KTLA's 
existing facility on Sunset Boulevard between Van Ness and Bronson avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the CRA has helped build nearly 500 units of new affordable housing, 
Littman said, and 400 more units of housing are planned. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywest mixed-use project to build low-cost senior citizen housing and 
retail stores on Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue is under way, and the 
restoration and expansion of the historic Dunning House at 5552 Carlton Way, 
Littman said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think 1990 is really a turning point," Littman said. "We have shifted from 
the planning stages to taking concrete action." 
</P>
<P>
Because of some activists' concerns that the meeting room will not be big 
enough, the CRA is making efforts to book extra rooms and hook up loudspeakers 
for anyone who wants to listen. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are some activists who say choosing a smaller room than the one 
booked two years ago is just one way of trying to reduce confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some people who want to tar and feather them (the CRA 
commissioners), run them out of town," Dodson said. "They're going to have to 
answer us sometime. -- They can't keep slipping out some back door.

18TH SENATE RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic state Sen. Gary K. Hart of Santa Barbara is seeking reelection to a 
third term. 
</P>
<P>
Although Democrats hold only a narrow lead in registration in the coastal 
district, which stretches from Malibu to Santa Barbara, Hart is a popular 
legislator in the area. He narrowly lost a race for Congress in 1988 against 
Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ojai). 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate race, he faces Republican businesswoman Carey Rogers of Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Hart's legislative accomplishments this year include the enactment of a law to 
make state grants available to individual schools for specific projects 
approved by parents, teachers and administrators. The measure is meant to 
encourage innovation and decentralization of local school districts. 
</P>
<P>
He also sponsored legislation that, starting in 1993, requires that plastic 
trash bags sold in the state be made at least partly from recycled plastics. 
Another Hart measure boosts efforts by local air quality control districts to 
combat pollution with funds from an added $2 to vehicle registration fees. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, who is making her first attempt at elected office, has called for a 
restructuring of the Legislature to "eliminate waste and inefficiency." 
</P>
<P>
"We have a Legislature that is controlled by lobbyists and political action 
committees," she said. "It passes thousands of bills, and yet basic problems 
aren't being solved." 
</P>
<P>
Hart enjoys the backing of a variety of political action committees and special 
interest groups, including those representing organized labor, oil companies, 
doctors, developers, accountants, bankers, beer and wine wholesalers and horse 
race tracks. 
</P>

Libertarian Jay C. Wood is again on the ballot.

49TH ASSEMBLY RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic Assemblywoman Gwen Moore of Los Angeles is running for a seventh 
term in the overwhelmingly Democratic district that stretches from Marina del 
Rey to the Crenshaw area. 
</P>
<P>
Moore is in a rematch this fall with Republican Eric Givens, against whom she 
ran up more than three-quarters of the vote in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Her legislative accomplishments this year include the enactment of a measure to 
curb loan scams that have cost some Los Angeles area residents their homes. The 
law is intended to restrict large balloon payments on short-term loans by 
mortgage brokers. 
</P>
<P>
Moore also sponsored legislation that bans trucks used to carry garbage and 
other wastes from hauling food products that are not adequately protected, as 
well as a law to make the labels on non-prescription medicines more readable. 
</P>
<P>
Moore is one of a handful of lawmakers under scrutiny in connection with a 
federal investigation of corruption in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
She unwittingly carried two bills for dummy companies set up by FBI agents 
seeking legislative help in opening a shrimp processing plant near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators last spring intensified their inquiry into Moore's 
office. They subpoenaed campaign contribution records and files on six bills 
she authored between 1985 and 1988, including four that would have changed 
regulations dealing with alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators also have been examining Tyrone Netters, a former aide to Moore. 
Both the assemblywoman and Netters accepted contributions from undercover 
agents posing as businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who testified at the federal corruption trial of state Sen. Joseph B. 
Montoya (D-Whittier) in January, has said she did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether she thought the investigation will hurt her reelection chances, 
she said, "Absolutely not, because people are familiar with my record and know 
me and know that I haven't done anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Challenger Givens, 33, acknowledges his uphill battle, given Moore's solid base 
of support, and says he is running in part to develop a constituency for future 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
A home builder who lives in the Crenshaw area, Givens has built his campaign 
around issues relating to the problems facing minority youth. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers, he says, must do more to address the high dropout rate and high 
unemployment rate among minority youth, without simply throwing more government 
funds at the problem. He says the problems can be solved through greater 
involvement by lawmakers and parents in community programs and by creating more 
job opportunities for young people. 
</P>
<P>
Moore's campaign contributions have come from utilities, oil companies, labor 
unions, trial lawyers, bankers, cable television companies, doctors, hospitals, 
nurses, realtors and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Peace and Freedom candidate Alice Mae Miles and Libertarian Carin Rogers will 
also be on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Staff writers Josh Meyer and Ron Russell and Times librarian Joyce Sherwood 
assisted with this report. 
</P>

POLITICS: CANDIDATES FOR SANTA MONICA-MALIBU DISTRICT SAY THE WORK, NOT THE 
SALARY, IS IMPORTANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Wanted: Four hard workers to attend frequent meetings that tend to drag on for 
hours, formulate educational and administrative policies, handle complaints, 
visit schools, find money. $240/month. 
</P>
<P>
Serving as a member of the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District Board of 
Education is a tough, mostly thankless job, but that hasn't deterred the six 
candidates who will be competing for the four open seats in the Nov. 6 
election. The lousy pay does not diminish the importance of the job, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Only one candidate, Patricia Hoffman, is an incumbent. Three other openings 
come because member Robert Holbrook is running for the Santa Monica City 
Council and because board President Dan Ross and member Della Barrett, citing 
exhaustion, are not seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know how wearing it would be," said Barrett, a two-term member, soon 
after announcing her decision not to run. It takes at least 20 hours a week "to 
do the job right," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"While there are some really good moments," she said, there is also "a lot of 
blame, not much credit." The board faces "large problems with small resources, 
which can be very frustrating and disheartening." 
</P>
<P>
Ross said that he didn't have enough time for his family, his law practice and 
his board duties, but will remain active in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates take similar positions on many issues, such as the district's 
financial woes. School districts in California are funded primarily through the 
state, based on attendance. Enrollment in Santa Monica-Malibu, now 9,300 
students, has declined over the past several years, which has meant less state 
money. The campuses have been neglected for so long that the board put a 
$75-million bond measure on the ballot in an effort to raise money to remove 
asbestos, repair plumbing and heating, modernize classrooms, and bring the 
buildings up to earthquake safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
All six candidates say that parents, teachers, administrators and the community 
must lobby in Sacramento for increased financing. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, all six support the bond measure, Proposition ES, which requires 
approval by two-thirds of the voters to pass. The $75-million bond issue, if 
approved, would be the largest ever by a local school district in California, 
district officials say. 
</P>
<P>
But the school board candidates all agree it is necessary because maintenance 
has been deferred for so long. 
</P>
<P>
None of them blames the board for the decay. The district simply hasn't had the 
money for maintenance since Proposition 13 and a court decision that required 
equalizing funding among school districts, said candidate Michael Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't maintain your buildings over 15, 20 years," a large sum is 
necessary to do the work, added candidate Pam Brady. "There is no gravy in that 
estimate." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the candidates have forged loose alliances. Hill said he is planning 
some joint community meetings with Brady and incumbent Hoffman, and possibly 
with candidate Joanne Leavitt as well. The four have been endorsed by the 
Committee for a Responsive School Board, a 10-year-old group of parents, 
teachers and school employees that is affiliated with Santa Monicans for 
Renters' Rights. The committee plans to help the four candidates with publicity 
and fund-raising, committee treasurer Randi Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson noted that Brady is the first Republican that the committee has ever 
backed. "We don't want to say, 'You have to be a tenant activist Democrat to 
get on the school board,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Brady leads in fund-raising, with $6,043 raised as of Sept. 30, according to 
campaign finance reports filed by the candidates. Hoffman has raised $1,344 and 
Hill $1,304. Candidate Brenda Gottfried said she has raised about $650, and 
Leavitt reported raising $535. The sixth candidate, Thomas Kayn, filed a 
statement saying he does not intend to raise or spend more than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
All of the candidates said they will comply with a new Santa Monica law that 
limits campaign contributions to $500, even though some said they believe they 
are not bound by that limit. County election officials have advised the school 
district that since the district is separate from the city, the board 
candidates are not subject to the city regulation but to the state campaign 
limits of $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a brief look at the candidates and their positions on various issues. 
The candidates are listed in the order in which they will appear on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Joanne Leavitt, who describes herself as a "community volunteer," is a former 
president of the Santa Monica-Malibu Council PTA. She also has served on 
several advisory committees to the district and is a former president of the 
League of Women Voters of Santa Monica/Malibu. She was honored by the board in 
1988 for campaigning to pass a school-funding tax. 
</P>
<P>
She says she believes the district can help itself improve its financial 
position by "better marketing of the schools," aimed at parents whose children 
now attend private schools or who are considering private schools. 
</P>
<P>
Of the prospect of assuming the responsibilities of a board member, she says, 
"It's not going to be any more meetings than what I do now." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Hill is the director of a Los Angeles Unified School District program 
in Venice for high school dropouts, and has a marriage and family counseling 
practice. His endorsements include those of the Concerned Homeowners of Santa 
Monica, the Santa Monica-Malibu teachers union and the union that represents 
non-teaching employees in the district. 
</P>
<P>
Hill recommends that adult education be brought back from Santa Monica College 
to the high school, saying that would give a sense of continuity to dropouts 
and would keep the district's teachers employed. As a teacher, he says that he 
can "bring (teachers') concerns to the board." 
</P>
<P>
He also wants to make students and faculty feel a greater sense of personal 
responsibility toward education. "Education (should get) back to 
character-building. You don't need to know the capital of Bolivia to lead a 
meaningful life." 
</P>
<P>
People who live outside the school district but work in Santa Monica are now 
eligible to enroll their children in Santa Monica schools through the eighth 
grade. Hill recommends that this eligibility be extended to high school to help 
increase enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Hoffman is the only incumbent in the race. She has been on the board 
for four years. 
</P>
<P>
She says that one of the district's biggest successes is its middle schools, 
where students are taught by teaching teams. If reelected, she says, she will 
look for ways to build on this success, and will continue working on teacher 
evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman says the enrollment decline has slowed in recent years in part because 
she and other board members have actively recruited parents. 
</P>
<P>
She has been endorsed by state Sen. Gary Hart and Assemblyman Tom Hayden, the 
chairmen of the committees on education in their respective legislative 
chambers, and by unions representing the district's teachers and non-teaching 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledges that the task of serving on the board can be exhausting, but 
also likened it to "going back to college, taking a course because it was fun, 
not because you needed to do this." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas N. Kayn, a lighting consultant, ran last in a field of six candidates in 
the 1988 school board elections. 
</P>
<P>
He says that the current board and the other candidates tend to be liberal, 
while he is "socially a moderate (and) fiscally, I'm restrained." 
</P>
<P>
In the race two years ago, Kayn criticized the board as being "too liberal." 
This time he is stressing his business experience and says he's concerned about 
youths who enter the working world with low self-esteem and an "inability to 
read." 
</P>
<P>
Kayn has been on the district's Health Advisory Committee. He has been endorsed 
by the Concerned Homeowners of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
He contends that the board has "let the academic status of the district 
decline" to becoming "middle of the road." He favors increasing the summer 
school offerings and expanding the school year to reduce the sizes of classes, 
and believes that the state can be persuaded to finance this, provided more 
students attend. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, he says, the district should consider a system that allows 
parents to choose the school their children attend. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Brady is the vice president for education of the 33rd District of the 
California Congress of Parents, Teachers and Students and regional director for 
Green Circle, a cultural awareness project of the National Conference of 
Christians and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Like Leavitt, she is a former president of the Santa Monica-Malibu Council PTA. 
Recently, she organized a coalition to oppose limits on school districts' use 
of developer fees and on funds to declining enrollment districts. She also 
helped organize an appeal to the Santa Monica City Council for funds, and the 
city granted $1.5 million to the district this year. 
</P>
<P>
Brady has been endorsed by the teachers' and classified employees' unions and 
by the Concerned Homeowners of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
She recommends that the district, the city, Malibu and Santa Monica College 
explore ways to share recreational facilities, purchases of supplies, and 
transportation and storage sites to reduce costs. 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Gottfried is a mediator and a former teacher in Los Angeles. She trains 
teachers, administrators and employers on how to reduce prejudice in a program 
sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. 
</P>
<P>
She has been endorsed by United Teachers-Los Angeles, which represents teachers 
in the Los Angeles district. 
</P>
<P>
Gottfried, who is black, notes that she is the only racial minority candidate 
and says that as a resident of the Pico neighborhood in the southern end of the 
city, she will try to reduce the gap with the northern schools. At Edison 
School in her neighborhood, she said, parents have raised about $16,000 for the 
school, while schools in more affluent neighborhoods have received as much as 
$55,000 in parental contributions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying parents have a responsibility to give funds from one school to 
another, but I would like to see . . . parents buy into and support all of the 
schools in an equitable manner." 
</P>
<P>
To help boost district enrollment, Gottfried recommends that successful special 
programs such as the Spanish immersion program at Edison School be put in each 
of the schools to attract students.

CALIFORNIA TRENDS: SACRAMENTO / BRADLEY INMAN; 
</P>
<P>
PETE WILSON, HOUSING ISSUES GO WAY BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Pete Wilson isn't new to the housing issue. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, as a member of the California Assembly, Wilson was called into Gov. 
Ronald Reagan's office and dressed down for his sponsorship of a major housing 
finance bill. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being asked to scrap his housing measure, Wilson shunned Reagan's 
advice and pushedforward with the bill, which was later defeated under pressure 
from the savings and loan lobby. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has had varied experiences with the housing subject, which offers 
insight into what to expect from him if he is elected. 
</P>
<P>
"His understanding really goes deep," said private consultant and Wilson 
housing adviser Ward Connerly. He recalled a meeting Wilson hosted with several 
housing experts in which the San Diego Republican "was briefing us on what was 
going on in the housing market." 
</P>
<P>
He knows the issue from several different angles and sometimes conflicting 
perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
As a state legislator, he was a controversial champion of the housing cause. As 
mayor of San Diego, he pioneered growth management and was chastised as 
"anti-housing" by the building industry. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento as a lone housing voice in the Republican party, Wilson served as 
chairman of the Assembly's Urban Affairs and Housing Committee and pushed for 
more action at the state and local level on housing issues. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote a bill that requires all municipalities to prepare local housing 
plans. Wilson also pushed through legislation that said communities must 
establish public housing authorities and another measure that required the 
state to prepare statewide housing goals. 
</P>
<P>
Upon returning to San Diego as mayor in 1972, Wilson got involved with housing 
again -- not as its champion, however. He spearheaded one of the nation's first 
growth management schemes, and he was dubbed an enemy of housing by the 
building industry. 
</P>
<P>
In his state-of-the-city address in 1972, Wilson said, "the city, rather than 
the developer, will determine the timing and location of new development." 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Wilson was careful to defend his growth management proposal as 
sound fiscal policy. The city could not afford to extend city services to 
far-flung areas where development was being proposed, according to the Wilson 
growth management doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, Wilson pushed for more intensive development in the city's downtown 
core, where the infrastructure was already in place. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the housing industry had a fit. When Wilson pushed for a building 
moratorium in an area of San Diego called Mira Mesa, a crowd of construction 
workers picketed the San Diego City Council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's not forget that San Diego had a huge moratorium on building under Wilson 
and had the highest fees on housing in the state," said Barry Scherman, vice 
president of the Hofmann Co,. a San Francsico Bay-area homebuilder and whose 
senior officers have been supporting Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until 1980 that a watered-down version of the Wilson growth 
management scheme was finally enacted. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the plan did not forestall development in San Diego. The 
scheme called for an annual city growth rate of 9%, but the actual growth rate 
was 11% by the time Wilson was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Growth control activists were so displeased with the boom in development that 
followed in later years that several ballot measures were proposed or approved 
that attempted to slow the pace of growth further in the San Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the growth management history in San Diego is a fundamental part 
of the Wilson legacy, as is his support for the California Coastal Protection 
Act, his opposition to Proposition 13 and his legislation that created the 
Governor's Office of Planning and Research, which established state guidelines 
for growth. 
</P>
<P>
But will growth and housing continue to be leading priorities if Wilson is 
elected governor? 
</P>
<P>
The Feinstein camp faults Wilson for not putting forth a detailed platform on 
housing and growth, which some say may indicate that Wilson won't make either 
issue a priority. 
</P>
<P>
The candidate promises that one of his top three issues will be "quality of 
life," which, according to Wilson's research director, Loren Kaye, embraces 
both housing affordability problems and growth management. 
</P>
<P>
"He understands the housing and growth issue and he's says that they are 
priorities," Connerly said. "So I expect him to be an activist governor working 
on these problems."

HACIENDA HEIGHTS: A GAS STATION AND MARKET WERE THE ONLY BUSINESSES 30 YEARS 
AGO. TODAY'S POPULATION IS SERVED BY SEVERAL SHOPPING CENTERS.

<P>
Thirty years ago, when Sandy and Jim Johnson moved to the area known as 
Hacienda Heights, it was a community of about 2,000 people, and the homes were 
nestled into orange, avocado and lemon groves. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Johnson had taken his first teaching position in Whittier -- just over the 
Puente Hills -- but the Johnson family was attracted to the rural environment 
of Hacienda Heights. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sandy recalls that at the time the only way to get to Whittier was 
over narrow and twisty Turnbull Canyon or narrow and twisty Hacienda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to go to Whittier to buy shoes. There was nothing but a gas station and 
a market in Hacienda Heights," she recalled. "There wasn't even a doctor's 
office, but we loved it like that. Our three children had the opportunity to 
grow up in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Today the Pomona Freeway borders the Los Angeles County community, there are a 
number of shopping areas and professional buildings along Hacienda Boulevard, 
and the groves have been replaced by houses in which a population estimated at 
60,000-plus now lives. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnson family has owned four homes in Hacienda Heights, but they've never 
been tempted to leave. Jim is director of child welfare and attendance in the 
Temple City school system. Sandy has been active in community affairs and is 
president of the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Johnson speaks proudly about the schools in Hacienda Heights and the 
community's ethnic diversity. 
</P>
<P>
The district offers the second largest adult education program in the state, 
second only to Los Angeles Unified, she said. 
</P>
<P>
On the ethnic mix, "We have about one-third Hispanic, one-third Asian and 
one-third Caucasian," Johnson said. "I'm out there all day working with 
families, students, teachers; I see many positives. This community has melded 
together very nicely." 
</P>
<P>
The community is rich in history. A part of the 49,000-acre land grant to 
William Workman and John Rowland by the last Mexican governor of California, 
the area still contains some of the original homes dating back to 1842. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed North Whittier Heights about 1926, a community petition in 1961 changed 
the name to Hacienda Heights and a preliminary master plan was drafted by the 
Hacienda Heights Improvement Assn. While incorporation has been talked about 
over the years, it has never come to a vote. The improvement association 
continues to be active in the community and to offer a forum for residents. 
</P>
<P>
Maria and Richard Nunez have lived in Hacienda Heights for 13 years and have 
owned two homes. They paid $54,000 for their first house, and in 1988, they 
purchased their current 2,400 square foot pool residence for $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Six months after we bought this home we were offered $416,000 cash. We turned 
that down," Marla Nunez said. "We love our home." 
</P>
<P>
The Nunez family moved to Hacienda Heights from Los Angeles because of the 
location -- Richard works in Long Beach and they wanted the convenience -- and 
Maria liked the school system. Their three children are 15, 11 and 9 years of 
age. Maria is active in the community, in PTA, the improvement association and 
is president of the women's auxiliary for Little League. 
</P>
<P>
Also active in the community is Grace Kwok, co-owner of Century 21 Hacienda 
Estates. A realtor for 14 years in the community, Grace is president of the 
Hacienda Heights Chinese Assn. and often serves this growing ethnic component. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people who live in Hacienda Heights are generally professional 
people," Kwok said, adding that in other communities where there is a 
significant Chinese population, they tend to be more commercially oriented. 
</P>
<P>
One reason the Chinese population has grown is that the Hsi Lai Temple -- the 
largest Buddhist temple in the United States -- was completed in November, 
1988. Located in the southern part of the area, on Glenmark Drive, just off 
Hacienda Boulevard, it encompasses 15 acres, and the buildings total 102,000 
square feet. 
</P>
<P>
People move to Hacienda Heights for many reasons, said realtor Donna Steinmetz: 
the schools, horse property, hills and trees, and there is the convenience of 
the freeway. There are three off-ramps into Hacienda Heights. 
</P>
<P>
The average listing price of a home in Hacienda Heights is $287,784, and the 
average sale price is $272,810, according to Marilyn McMullin, president of the 
Hacienda-Rowland-Diamond Bar Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Darlene Montes, a realtor with Century 21 Hacienda, said there is a wide price 
range of homes in the community. On the low end there are 900-square-foot, 
three-bedroom, one-bath homes built in the early 1950s that are listed for 
$150,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the $300,000 price range, there are homes of 1,500 to 1,800 square feet. For 
2,500 square feet, the price tag is going to be around $400,000. Much depends 
on the age of the home as well as the location. Custom homes are spread 
throughout the area. 
</P>
<P>
On the high end there is a listing for $1.85 million, another for $1.48 million 
and one at $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
These homes are often on 4 to 6 acres. They range from 4,000 to 6,000 square 
feet and feature game rooms, libraries, cedar closets, wet bars, saunas in 
master bedrooms. They have views, tennis courts and pools where the terrain 
permits. Generally, they are to be found in the Turnbull Canyon area on the 
western side of the community. 
</P>
<P>
Tigran Adhiwiyogo and his wife, Fay, moved with their two children into a 
2-year-old home in August, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Originally from Indonesia, Adhiwiyogo had been transferred by his company to 
Southern California. His office is in Whittier, so they shopped for a home that 
would allow a short commute time and where there would be excellent schools. 
</P>
<P>
'We wanted a nice area to live in," he said. "We liked the quiet residential 
area we found in Hacienda Heights." 
</P>
<P>
He was surprised by the high price of real estate. They paid $525,000 for their 
3,000-square foot, four-bedroom 2 1/2-bath home with pool. "Our children have 
been active in all school activities, and have found friends quickly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Luis and Juanita Cruz moved into their home on a quiet cul-de-sac last 
September. 
</P>
<P>
They were planning to buy a new home in Ontario when they stopped to visit 
friends in Hacienda Heights, and began to think that they might be able to 
afford something in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Luis is an evangelist who does a lot of traveling, and Juanita works in El 
Monte. She was not looking forward to a long commute from Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,800-square-foot house they purchased had a lot of deferred maintenance. 
Juanita was not at all impressed, but Luis felt there was the potential. They 
made an offer of $225,000, $50,000 below the asking price. 
</P>
<P>
"If she accepts that offer, it will be a miracle, and this house was meant for 
us," Juanita said. "She accepted it, and I think it was a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn and Russell Ribb paid $25,000 for their house, but then they moved to 
Hacienda Heights 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It was avocado groves and lemon groves when we moved here," Marilyn Ribb said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ribbs raised three children in their home, and Russell was superintendent 
of schools at one time. The biggest change she notices aside from people and 
houses is that there is a lot more traffic to contend with. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Dan Larson, assigned to the Industry Station of the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department, said that traffic is one of their major concerns about 
Hacienda Heights, although they do experience residential burglaries and auto 
thefts. 
</P>
<P>
"A small portion of the area does have some gang-related activities, and 
inconsistent drug activity," he said. "It is not a high level." 
</P>
<P>
These are matters also of concern in the school district. Sandy Johnson said 
there has been a significant effort in educating the students and their parents 
in the dangers of gang and drug activities. "We work constantly on prevention," 
she said.

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: HOME SELLER WANTS TO KNOW HOW MUCH IT WILL COST IN 
CLOSING FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We are in the process of selling our home and it is going to be real 
close if we are to get enough cash to pay off our debts. In addition to the 
real estate sales commission, is there any rule of thumb as to how much the 
sales costs will be? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Everything is negotiable. For example, in many communities it is 
customary for the home seller to pay the buyer's title insurance fee. However, 
if you are short of cash, you can put in the offer that the buyer is to pay for 
all title insurance. Of course, that would be risking loss of that buyer if he 
refuses to pay. 
</P>
<P>
As a general rule, home sellers should expect closing costs of about 2% of the 
sales price, in addition to the real estate sales commission. Your real estate 
agent can give you a more exact estimate of closing costs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Think Carefully Before Co-Signing a Mortgage 
</P>
<P>
Q: Some very close friends want to buy their first home. But they don't have 
quite enough income to qualify for a mortgage, since they are only making a 10% 
down payment and need to get a 90% mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
They asked us to co-sign on the mortgage. According to their real estate agent, 
after we help our friends get their mortgage we can quitclaim our interest in 
the house to them and not have any further liability. Is this true? 
</P>
<P>
A: Not exactly. When you co-sign a mortgage, most mortgage lenders insist that 
you also hold title to the house along with the other owners. However, the 
lender cannot stop you from later quitclaiming your interest in the house. But 
adverse consequences can still happen to you if the residents default on the 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
In the event the residents for whom you co-signed fail to make the payments, 
you are almost certain to have the default entered on your credit report by the 
credit bureaus, since you co-signed on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
For your protection, since your friends will have little equity in the house, 
if you co-sign, you should be certain the property alone is security for the 
loan, so you will have no personal liability. Please think carefully about the 
possible consequences of co-signing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Getting Deposit Back Can Be Difficult 
</P>
<P>
Q: We made a $1,500 earnest-money deposit to buy a house. Then, through no 
fault of hers, my wife lost her job due to cutbacks at her company. Her 
prospects of finding a similar high-paying job are not very good. So I notified 
the realtor to cancel the sale and refund our $1,500. But she refuses because, 
she says, the seller won't refund our money. What can we do to get our money 
back? 
</P>
<P>
A: It sounds as if you breached your contract to buy the house. Just because 
your wife lost her job doesn't make it impossible for you to buy the home. 
Unless your purchase contract limits the seller's damages, called a liquidated 
damages clause, the seller might even sue you for damages caused by your breach 
of contract. For further details, please consult a local real estate attorney. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Getting the Right Agent Is Crucial 
</P>
<P>
Q: Thank you for your suggestion several months ago of asking real estate 
agents, before listing a home for sale, for a list of their recent home sales 
and phoning the sellers to learn if they were satisfied. We interviewed four 
local agents and were about to list our home for sale with the one we liked 
best. 
</P>
<P>
Then I remembered to ask for the names of his most recent home sellers. He 
replied business had been a little slow recently and he hadn't sold a listing 
since February. So we phoned our second favorite agent and she gladly gave us 
details of her four most recent sales. 
</P>
<P>
We called those sellers and they all gave her glowing recommendations. Within 
two weeks of our listing with her, another agent with the same brokerage firm 
produced a buyer. It was a pleasure working with these very professional agents 
who got the sale closed in only about 30 days. Many thanks for the idea. 
</P>
<P>
A: Selecting the right agent to list your home is a major part of selling it. 
Even in today's slow buyer's market in many cities, the best agents are doing 
very well because they know the successful techniques for getting homes sold. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a few weeks ago I had lunch with one of my favorite real estate 
agents. This young salesman, age 73, told me this year has been his best for 
sales volume out of the 15 years he has been selling homes. 
</P>
<P>
But not all his listings have sold. However, rather than reduce the asking 
price on one troublesome listing, which he feels is fairly priced, he got the 
seller to raise the sales commission to 8%, so the selling agent will earn 5% 
and he will receive 3%. He feels this will ignite enthusiasm from cooperating 
sales agents to get this "difficult home" sold. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No IRS Extension of Replacement Tax Rule 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband and I are in a bind concerning taxes on the home we sold in 
April, 1989. We then bought land on which to build our dream home. But there 
have been many construction delays. We hope to complete the home before our 
two-year deadline next April. Is there any special IRS ruling concerning 
extension of the reinvestment period when a new home is built? Do we need a 
certificate of occupancy? 
</P>
<P>
A: Sorry, the IRS cannot grant any extension of the 24-month principal 
residence replacement period. 
</P>
<P>
The law says you must buy and occupy the replacement home within 24 months 
before or after the sale. It doesn't mention any certificate of occupancy, so 
perhaps you might get away with camping out in your new home if it isn't 
entirely completed by April, 1991. Please check with your tax adviser. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fixed-Rate Mortgages Are Better Deal Today 
</P>
<P>
Q: We want to buy a home, but are undecided whether to get a fixed- or 
adjustable-rate mortgage. I think interest rates will drop in the next few 
months as the nation goes into a depression. But my wife thinks we should get a 
fixed-rate mortgage just in case we have inflation and interest rates go up. 
What do you advise? 
</P>
<P>
A: Listen to your smart wife. The adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) are almost 
as expensive as fixed-rate mortgages. Compare the APR (annual percentage rate), 
and you will discover the ARM and fixed-rate loans cost virtually the same 
interest rate, after the initial ARM teaser rate for the first few months. 
</P>
<P>
But mortgage lenders want to promote ARMs because these loans shift the 
interest rate risk from lender to borrower. So the lenders make it easier to 
qualify for an ARM than for a fixed-rate loan. 
</P>
<P>
My advice is to take a fixed-rate mortgage. If interest rates decline 
substantially, then you can refinance at the lower rate. But if your wife is 
right and interest rates go up, then you will be protected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Be Sure Lease-Option Has Assignable Clause 
</P>
<P>
Q: I like your advice to first-time home buyers who are short of cash to obtain 
a lease with option to purchase. My son and his new wife are considering such a 
lease-option on a house where the seller will give them a $450 per month rent 
credit toward the down payment. 
</P>
<P>
However, my son might be transferred by his employer. If he and his wife don't 
exercise the purchase option, is there any way they can get that $450 per month 
rent credit back? 
</P>
<P>
A: I have never seen a lease-option where the rent credit is refundable to a 
tenant who doesn't exercise the purchase option. However, in my lease-options I 
always make the purchase option assignable, so the tenant can, if desired, sell 
the purchase option and perhaps earn a little profit. Only one of my 
lease-option tenants ever assigned their purchase option, but assignment is an 
alternative to consider. Just be sure the option is assignable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Hire Inspector Until Offer Accepted 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are first-time home buyers who have been looking for at least a year at 
homes for sale. Looking back, we now realize there are several homes (now sold) 
that we should have bought. 
</P>
<P>
But we are afraid something will be wrong with the house we buy and we will get 
stuck with big repair bills. Another problem is we are worried we will pay too 
much for the house. Any ideas how to overcome these problems? 
</P>
<P>
A: Your first step is to make a written purchase offer to buy a home. Until you 
have the home under purchase contract it is a waste of time to have the home 
professionally inspected. 
</P>
<P>
But before making your written purchase offer, to avoid offering too much for 
the home, ask the real estate agent to prepare a written "comparative market 
analysis." 
</P>
<P>
This form shows recent sales prices of similar nearby homes, as well as asking 
prices of comparable neighborhood houses. It is the same form which was 
prepared for the home seller when the listing agent put the home on the market 
for sale. 
</P>
<P>
By adding and subtracting value for the pros and cons of the house under 
consideration, you can make a purchase offer at or slightly below market value. 
Remember, you can always come up in price, but you can never drop your offer 
price after it is accepted. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to customary inspections such as for termites, to protect yourself 
against buying a home with unexpected defects you can take two steps. 
</P>
<P>
The first is to put a contingency in your purchase offer conditioned on 
approval of the seller's disclosure statement. This form, which your real 
estate agent should have readily available (required in some states), asks the 
seller to disclose all known defects. The realty agent also should sign it, 
noting any defects the agent observed which the seller may have overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
Your second step is to include in your purchase offer a contingency for your 
approval of a professional inspection of the house. You get to choose and pay 
for the inspector, such as a general contractor, and either approve or 
disapprove the report. I highly recommend you accompany the inspector, so you 
can see for yourself if a problem is major or minor. 
</P>
<P>
By following these suggestions you can offer the right price and learn all the 
home's defects before you purchase. However, please be aware no home is perfect 
and surprises will sometimes happen. 
</P>
<P>
For example, about a week after I bought my current home the water heater 
developed a bad leak and had to be replaced. Fortunately, the seller and realty 
agent had purchased a one-year home warranty policy for me, so I only had to 
pay a $25 service fee to get a new water heater. You may want to insist on such 
a warranty policy too.

READERS RESPOND TO ELDERLY HOUSING SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Having It All" by David W. Myers on elderly housing (Sept. 23) proves that it 
pays to read the Real Estate section. The article not only covers senior living 
possibilities, but the statistics explain attitudes toward seniors, 
particularly women. 
</P>
<P>
Recently retired, 60-plus and widowed since age 49, I've sensed hostility 
against independence in older women from both male and female peers. 
</P>
<P>
In the travel realm, (including Elderhostel), brochures make it patently clear 
that accommodations are on a Noah's Ark basis. Many of us single women are 
perfectly willing to pay double if only we could be roommate-less. Although the 
tour/conference/ whatever would lose not a cent, it insists on pairing us up. 
</P>
<P>
I assume this true in some retirement communities. Could this attitude be 
because so few middle-class women have either education or recent work 
experience? Although I've never been a women's righter, I'm beginning to 
wonder.

If you want a sprinkler system installed, experts advise getting a contractor 
with a "C16" license for installing fire sprinklers. They are listed in the 
phone book under fire sprinklers or fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
You may want to call the Contractors' State License Board at (916) 366-5153 to 
verify licenses and whether contractors are in good standing. Or check with 
your local fire department for information and recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Some manufacturers offer do-it-yourself kits, although fire officials say it's 
a good idea to have an expert check the plans and installation, especially if 
you aren't familiar with plumbing techniques. 
</P>
<P>
You should also ask your building department for local requirements. Fire 
departments will usually check systems to see if they are working properly. 
Systems are checked with a test valve so the sprinkler heads don't activate.

APARTMENT LIFE: MOVING MAY BE BEST IF PROMISES ABOUT LUXURY UNIT ARE NOT KEPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I recently moved into a 3-month-old luxury apartment in Encino. I was 
assured that the building would be properly maintained and that no children 
would be allowed on the second or third floors. I did not get any of this in 
writing. Now, the building is filthy and there are some very noisy children 
right above me. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, I have a three-year lease. The city's rent control people and 
the city attorney's office say they can't help me because the building is 
exempted from the city's rent law. What can I do? My lawyer thinks the only 
remedies I have are to either move or sue. What do you think? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Your attorney is probably right about moving being a solution. I'm not 
so sure about a lawsuit. If you decide to move, be sure to cooperate with the 
owner's efforts to rerent the unit, as you may be responsible for rent until 
it's rerented. 
</P>
<P>
The city's rent control authorities cannot help since they are only empowered 
to deal with rent-controlled properties. 
</P>
<P>
If the filthiness of the building represents a health or safety problem, then 
the county's health/safety department may cite the owner for the condition and 
require him to remedy it. Likewise, you may be entitled to withhold a portion 
of your monthly rent equal to the percentage of reduced services caused by the 
filth. 
</P>
<P>
The owner's oral promise to prohibit children on the second or third floors is 
also very difficult to enforce since it was only verbal and is easily denied by 
him. It may also constitute illegal child discrimination. You should always get 
all important contract provisions in writing, and that goes beyond housing 
arrangements to all contracts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What Are Tenant's Rights in Condo Sale? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have been leasing an Agoura Hills condo for six months and the leases 
expires in another six months. The owner of the condo has told me by phone that 
he is putting the place up for sale. I don't really know what my rights are as 
a tenant, and I'm hoping you can help. 
</P>
<P>
In the lease that I drew up, it says that I get 60 days' notice to move out. 
Here are my questions. Can I stay in the condo until the lease runs out, even 
if it's sold? Is the 60-day notice to move provisions in my lease enforceable? 
And what if the owner can't sell right away and I turn into a month-to-month 
tenant? Can I still get 60 days' notice to move if that happens? 
</P>
<P>
A: When your tenancy expires, you become a month-to-month tenant unless your 
lease agreement has a "holdover" provision, making its terms applicable to the 
post-lease period. Don't count on the owner voluntarily agreeing to a 60-day 
notice provision in a month-to-month agreement because such a provision delays 
a new owner's right to possession of the unit by an extra 30 days, which is not 
a great selling point. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-day notice to vacate written into your lease is enforceable until the 
lease expires. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, you may occupy the unit to the end of your lease term, even if it 
changes hands. That guaranteed right to occupy is why you signed a lease in the 
first place. Making some tentative moving plans now, for six months down the 
line, probably would not be premature. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tenant Gone, but Left All His Possessions 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am a 66-year-old widow. My husband left me a four-unit apartment building 
in Inglewood that I am now managing for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
My problem is that one of my tenants is an artist so he's gone a lot of the 
time. He's in Paris now and I've heard that he isn't coming back, which would 
be all right with me except that he owes me four months' rent at $300 a month 
and I need the rent from the unit to supplement the $400 a month that I get 
from Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to know how I can get his things out of there to rerent the unit 
to a tenant who will pay me some rent. 
</P>
<P>
What can I do? Even if I can remove his things from the unit, I can't afford to 
store them. What do I do with them? Any help you can provide me with is greatly 
appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
A: It's unfortunate that you have waited so long to do anything about this 
problem. You could have acted much sooner, after the 14th day the rent was past 
due and the tenant disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Your best course of action here is probably to serve the tenant with a Notice 
of Belief of Abandonment. (It's available free to members of the Apartment 
Assn. of Greater Los Angeles (AAGLA). In Inglewood phone (213) 674-0463. Ask 
for Mary Lou.) 
</P>
<P>
To serve such a notice, the rent must be more than 14 days past due and you 
must have a reasonable belief that the tenant has abandoned the unit, i.e., 
left with no intent to return. You, clearly, meet those two tests (assuming the 
tenant has been away for the four months that the rent has gone unpaid). 
</P>
<P>
If nothing happens within 18 days after you serve this notice (15 days if the 
notice is served in person), both by posting a copy on the door and by mailing 
a copy to any and all known addresses of the renter, you may then take 
possession of both the rental unit and the renter's personal property. 
</P>
<P>
If the property is worth less than $300, you may dispose of it in any way you 
see fit. 
</P>
<P>
If the value of the property is over $300, disposing of it is much more 
difficult. You must inventory it, publish public notices of the pending auction 
you must conduct, and then hold an auction at which you sell the property. The 
proceeds of the auction, less expenses, are then turned over to the county. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Renter Says Deposit Not Being Returned 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently broke a lease in the city of Orange. I moved out on Sept. 30 and 
the rent was paid up until then. The unit was rented to a new tenant on Oct. 
11. I understand that I was liable for the rent from Oct. 1 until it was 
rerented, but the landlady won't give me the rest of my $1,000 security deposit 
back. I left the place very clean. What can I do? 
</P>
<P>
A: The owner cannot collect double rent as a penalty for your lease. You are, 
as you say, only liable for 11 days rent. If all else fails, you'll probably 
have to sue the owner of the property in small claims court to get the balance 
of your deposit back. The filing fee is small and the clerks at most courts are 
usually helpful with paper work.

UPDATE ON REGULATORY ISSUES AND A SCAM;

<P>
FINANCING: HOME-EQUITY LOAN CAPS, REALTORS' LOAN SERVICE FEES RESOLVED. ALSO, 
SOME GUIDELINES GIVEN TO AVOID LOAN-SERVICE FRAUD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past few months, we've written about a variety of issues that concern 
you and your mortgage. Here's an update on two regulatory matters that we've 
talked about before, and a follow-up on a real estate scam that's spreading 
across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The first regulatory matter involves home-equity loans, those popular accounts 
that let you tap the built-up appreciation in your house simply by using a 
credit card or special checks. 
</P>
<P>
Many financial institutions that make these loans have long been criticized by 
some consumer groups, who say lenders don't do a good job when it comes to 
explaining how the loans work. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent flap involves "rate caps" and a lender's ability to cut off a 
homeowner's credit line when the cap is reached. 
</P>
<P>
For example, say you take out a typical adjustable-rate credit line with an 
initial 10% rate. 
</P>
<P>
The loan papers state that there's a five-point limit, or "cap," on how high 
the rate can go -- meaning your loan rate can never rise above 15%, even if 
inflation skyrockets in the future. 
</P>
<P>
What the loan papers often don't tell you, however, is that the lender may have 
the power to cut off your credit line if the 15% ceiling is ever reached. 
</P>
<P>
"You might have paid hundreds or even thousands of dollars to set the line up, 
but you wouldn't be able to borrow a nickel until rates went down again," said 
Michelle Meier of Consumers Union, an advocacy group that says these "cut-off 
clauses" are unfair. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board, which governs the activities of banks, recently 
issued a ruling concerning Consumers Union's complaints -- and the advocacy 
group isn't happy. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed's new ruling allows lenders to retain their ability to cut off cash 
advances when the equity line's rate cap is reached. 
</P>
<P>
However, beginning late next year, all lenders will have to state in their 
equity-line documents that they have the option to cut off the homeowner's 
credit line if the rate cap is reached. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers Union is appealing a court ruling that essentially upholds the 
Federal Reserve Board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Meier said, "The banks have won a battle at the expense of 
consumers." 
</P>
<P>
The second recent regulatory ruling that can affect your pocketbook concerns 
fees that realtors earn when they use computerized loan systems, which can be 
found in hundreds of real estate offices across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The systems have been touted as the "ultimate in one-stop real estate 
shopping": After you have agreed to purchase a home, you simply go back to the 
realtor's office, the agent turns on the computer and up pop a variety of loans 
offered by one or more lenders who have put their loan information into the 
computer's database. 
</P>
<P>
Although these computerized "loan networks" can be convenient, they have drawn 
fire from some bankers and mortgage brokers who don't have their loans on each 
system's database. 
</P>
<P>
These lenders say that consumers don't always understand that the loans offered 
via computer represent a mere fraction of the loans that are currently 
available: A borrower might be able to get a much better rate from a lender 
whose loan isn't on the database. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, many bankers complain that the fees that some realtors charge 
borrowers to use the computerized systems jack up the cost of buying a home. 
</P>
<P>
It took nearly six years of debate and study, but the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development last month finally ruled that it's all right for 
realtors to charge consumers for access to the systems. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling "is a definite step in line with the way the industry is headed," 
said Norm Flynn, president of the National Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
"The real estate business, like everything else, is becoming more 
technology-oriented. These systems can be a great service to today's home 
buyers and save them a lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
Although the ruling was praised by realtors who operate the systems, it wasn't 
a total victory for sales agents -- nor a total loss for would-be borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
Although realtors can continue collecting fees from borrowers, HUD said that 
realty firms must tell the borrower that they'll be charged for the computer 
service. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, HUD hinted that it would cap the fees realtors can charge for 
their loan services when it issues its final rules next year. A spokesman for 
the agency said the fee would likely be limited to $200 or $300. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, a cap -- which government officials hope will protect consumers -- 
could wind up hurting borrowers in the long run. Some experts say lenders may 
raise their rates in order to buy their way into the realtors' systems. 
</P>
<P>
About two months ago, we reported that loan-servicing scams were spreading 
across the country. But the problem seems to be getting worse, despite a 
growing number of stories about the rip-off schemes and warnings from several 
lending and consumer groups. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a serious problem that's occurring around the country," said Warren 
Lasko, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent cases have been reported in Virginia and North Carolina. 
Previous reports found problems in California, Colorado and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
The typical loan-servicing scam works like this: 
</P>
<P>
You get an official-looking letter from a company that says it has recently 
purchased your loan from the original lender, or that it is taking over the 
duties of processing your monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
The letter says you should begin sending your payments to the new company 
immediately. It might even be accompanied by a loan payment book. 
</P>
<P>
If it is indeed a bogus company and you start sending it checks, you might be 
out hundreds or even thousands of dollars before you realize that you have been 
duped. 
</P>
<P>
You'll also have to make up the back payments to your rightful lender and it 
may put black marks on your credit record that will be hard to remove. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a 'lose-lose' situation for the homeowner," Lasko sums up. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce the chance that you'll fall victim to one of these scams, the MBA 
suggests that you follow these guidelines if you get a notice that your loan is 
being transferred: 
</P>
<P>
* Make sure you get a letter from the original lender stating that the 
loan-servicing duties are being assigned to another institution. You should 
receive this "goodby letter" at least 15 days before the next payment is due. 
</P>
<P>
* The letter should state the name of the new servicing company, its address 
and the name and phone number of a contact person or department. It should also 
specify where and when the next payment should be sent. 
</P>
<P>
* The new servicer should send a "welcome letter" stating the same information. 
If you get a welcome letter but no notice from the original lender that your 
loan is being transferred, contact the original lender to verify it. 
</P>
<P>
* Make sure that the original lender and the new loan-servicer have your 
current address, and notify the new institution if your mailing address 
changes. This helps to assure that you'll get any future correspondence in a 
timely manner. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to know more about loan transfers, you can order "When Your Loan is 
Transferred to Another Lender -- a Consumers Guide" from the Mortgage Bankers 
Assn. of America, Department 0021, Washington, D.C. 20073-0021. It costs $1.

YOUR MORTGAGE; 
</P>
<P>
'LEVERAGE' IS OUT -- BUT 'EQUITY' IS IN FASHION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL

<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I have followed your arguments about accelerating the payoff of your 
mortgage interest and have come to the conclusion that you're all wet. Haven't 
you ever heard of "leverage" and the wisdom of using the other fellow's money 
to make money for yourself? Your emphasis on speeding up the payoff of a 
mortgage flies right in the face of this conventional wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: On the face of it, nothing has quite the appeal in theory -- except for 
finding the Fountain of Youth -- that leverage has. For example: You buy a 
$100,000 house with a 5% down payment. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later you sell the house for $150,000 (we're ignoring selling 
expenses and whatnot for simplicity's sake). How much of a gain do you have? 
Fifty percent, right? No, not really. After paying off the mortgage, you have a 
gain of $50,000, but since you only put up $5,000 in the first place you've got 
a solid gain of $45,000 -- nine times your actual investment. 
</P>
<P>
Now, what's wrong with that? Not a cockeyed thing, of course. The only problem 
is that it requires a neatly meshing set of circumstances that has become rare 
to the point of non-existence. What if the house, instead of appreciating 50% 
percent, declines in value 25%? So you sell it and where are you? Again 
ignoring selling expenses you're going to come out of with $75,000, but 
unfortunately you still owe the lender $95,000 over and above the original 
$5,000 down payment which is already down the old rat hole. So you take a walk. 
</P>
<P>
Why do we have record foreclosures today? In large measure for this very reason 
-- reliance on leverage, which blew up in the face of thousands of home buyers. 
And this is also the reason why lenders have tightened up and the old 5% down 
payment and a casual attitude about the buyer's debt load are out the window. 
</P>
<P>
I don't like to belabor a point, but I think that something very fundamental 
has changed since leverage hit the peak of its popularity: Leverage, as 
personified by debt, is very much out of fashion and equity is very much "in."

A STRIP SHOW THAT CAN DRIVE YOU UP THE WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Popular Mechanics 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Removing wallpaper is a messy job, but somebody's got to do it, and that 
somebody will probably be you. 
</P>
<P>
Finding somebody else to do it is probably more difficult than doing it 
yourself. Professional paperhangers often don't want to do it and when they do, 
they charge a premium rate. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, this job is more messy than difficult. It's a good example of the 
kind of grunt work homeowners can do themselves. This job requires little skill 
and few tools, just scraping and patience. With the advent of improved 
wallpaper and removing tools, teamed with time-proven methods, the job is 
easier than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Not all wallpapers are created equal, meaning that some are more difficult to 
strip than others. The easiest to remove are the "strippable" wallpapers. They 
can be removed without tearing or being loosened by water or steam. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly more difficult to remove are old, untreated and uncoated wallpapers. 
They simply need to be wetted and scraped loose. 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult to remove are the paper with vinyl coating (washable 
wallpapers) or those with laminated surfaces of woven fabric or foils. 
Wallpaper that's been painted falls into this category. These papers are 
difficult to strip because water doesn't penetrate their surface as readily as 
with uncoated paper. 
</P>
<P>
Old-fashioned wallpaper comes off easily if you get enough moisture behind it. 
It's held up with wheat paste adhesive, a substance easily softened by water. 
These porous papers absorb water, hastening the decomposition of the paste. 
</P>
<P>
Stripping the paper is even easier if you mix some wallpaper remover in the 
water. The remover, sold at paint and hardware stores, has wetting agents that 
penetrate the paper and soften the paste. Some strippers also have enzymes that 
attack the wheat paste and dissolve it. 
</P>
<P>
Vinyl, foil-faced and other moisture-resistant wallpapers are designed to be 
cleaned. The challenge, then, is to get moisture behind their water-resistant 
face to soften the glue. Wallpaper remover is not as effective on coated papers 
as uncoated. The solution is to steam the paper loose, then scrape it off the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
You have to prepare these papers before steaming them. The easiest way to get 
the steam or water behind a coated wall covering is to score the surface to 
allow moisture to penetrate. 
</P>
<P>
If the paper is old and there are several painted layers, most of the layers 
can be scraped off with a razor scraper. This is harder work than steaming off 
individual layers, but it's much faster than trying to steam down through 
individual layers. 
</P>
<P>
Strippable wallpapers simply peel off the wall when gently pulled from a 
corner. At a seam, lift the corner of the paper with a putty knife or scraper 
and pull toward you. 
</P>
<P>
Carefully remove the adhesive left on the wall with a fresh blade in a razor 
scraper. Since the paste is dry and hard, most of the heavy residue can be 
scraped off. Then wash the walls with warm water and detergent.

To whom are you addressing this article? I myself am a physician and a working

women out there. 
</P>
<P>
Come on now, more than $1,000 for a jacket? It boggles the mind. Those prices 
would be appropriate for a down payment for a car, not for working clothes.

Regarding "Brains, Bats and Big Bucks," by Mark A. Stein (Aug. 26). 
</P>
<P>
I'm just curious about the "big bucks" that Jose Canseco and Rickey Henderson 
got paid for the article written about them, considering that for their 
autographs they charge their fans a fee of $22 (Canseco) and $20 (Henderson). 
All the media hype will probably raise their fees. The rich get richer, and the 
stupid pay.

We read with great interest "The Dark World of Maurice Sendak," (Sept. 16.) but 
felt there was one major omission. Through Oct. 28, Sendak's paintings and 
drawings for the L.A. Opera Co.'s production of "Idomeneo" will be exhibited at 
Every Picture Tells a Story, 836 N. La Brea Ave., Los Angeles.

SLEEK CHIC

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hey, Barbara Foley, how about joining the '90s? I found it dismaying that you 
considered only women who work outside the home to be "successful Southern 
California women." What about those women that have foregone the social 
acceptability of outside employment to stay at home raising our next 
generation? 
</P>
<P>
Why is it so hard for our society to recognize this group of working women, and 
why do we continue to be stereotyped? You may not believe this, but there are 
some housewives out here that are educated, intelligent and, yes, chic.

<P>
THE OLDEST organic farm in the United States, operated organically since 1906, 
has long been known for its tasty apricots. That acreage, now the K. B. Hall 
Ranch, has for two generations supported a summertime roadside fruit stand on 
Highway 150 between Ojai and Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
This year, K. B. Hall joined with several of its neighbors, all members of 
California Certified Organic Farmers, to offer (on weekends only) 
environmentally conscientious, palate-pleasing fruits and vegetables. The 
ranchers not only adhere to CCOF standards -- no spraying, no concentrated 
fertilizer, no pesticides and no herbicides -- but they maintain dry-farmed 
orchards as well, thus conserving precious water resources. 
</P>
<P>
Come Thanksgiving, you can look out for the Royal Burgundy purple string beans.

OWNERS CHARLES and Lenore Laraway like to think of Laraway's, a quaint 
900-square-foot specialty shop chockablock with vintage buttons, beads, 
appliques, ribbons, trims and needlepoint patterns, as a "ladies' hardware 
store." "We felt there was a need for this kind of store," Lenore says. 
</P>
<P>
"There really was nothing, and still isn't, that carried such a varied 
collection of do-it-yourself components." 
</P>
<P>
The trims (79 cents to more than $100 a yard), which come in all varieties of 
widths and materials -- cotton, silks, rayons, synthetics, knits and wools -- 
are imported from Brazil, France, England and Switzerland. "The new trims are 
not made nearly as well," Lenore says. "And they don't have the wonderful 
vibrant colors or interesting pattern detail, either." 
</P>
<P>
The ornate top-of-the-line trims date as far back as the turn of the century. 
Encrusted with pearls, rhinestones or jet, many of them are highlighted with 
seed-bead fringes. These rare articles are priced as high as $100 a yard. 
</P>
<P>
Other novelties: vintage Venetian beads (production of these stopped more than 
25 years ago), centuries-old seed beads from Bohemia ($1 per full thimble), 
pre-Columbian beads ($6 each and up) and African trade beads (sold by the inch, 
starting at $4.50). 
</P>
<P>
Classes in needle-weaving, needlepoint, basic bead-stringing and jewelry making 
are offered at the store, ranging from $10 to $25 per session (private classes 
can be arranged). There's also a professional stitcher on the premises, and the 
services of two artists specializing in custom needlepoint are available by 
appointment.

ORGANIC BABIES

<TEXT>
<P>
SIMPLY PURE FOODS baby products are so pure that tiny diners can eat everything 
but the container (even the label is nontoxic). And the wide-mouth, screw-top 
glass jar is definitely a plus for mommies and daddies. 
</P>
<P>
Simply Pure Foods, headquartered in Bangor, Me., is heading into its fourth 
year, not coincidentally, the same age as founder Sarah Redfield's son, 
Alexander. Redfield, a Harvard Law School graduate, had become concerned that 
youngsters under 5 are at high risk from pesticide residues. Unable to find 
organic baby food for her newborn, she decided to shift career gears and make 
her own. 
</P>
<P>
All of the fruits and vegetables used in Redfield's 100% organic products for 
babies and toddlers are fresh and grown on acreage kept free of pesticides for 
at least three years. Also, the products contain no dyes, preservatives, 
fillers, artificial enhancers or added salt, sugar or vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
These strained baby foods come in six varieties: applesauce, pear-applesauce, 
beets, carrots, winter squash and green beans -- and sell for about 65 cents to 
$1. (Green beans and carrots and potatoes also come in half-inch diced finger 
food.) 
</P>
<P>
Other organic products, including dry cereals and additional finger foods for 
children, are currently in the works, the company says. And both Alexander and 
Simply Pure Foods are healthy and growing strong and quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply Pure Foods products are available at Gelson's and Vons Pavilion markets 
and at many health-food outlets. For more information, call (800) I-AM-PURE.

TELL TV TIMES: WHICH SPORTSCASTER DO YOU WATCH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's World Series time, which means attention is turned to sports. Which 
sportscaster is your favorite, locally (such as KNBC's Fred Roggin, right) or 
nationally (ESPN's Chris Berman) -- and why? 
</P>
<P>
Here are the responses to the Aug. 26 question: How far should TV go? 
</P>
<P>
TV's preoccupation with sex in the content and dialogue of the majority of 
sitcoms smacks of writers trapped in a warped adolescent state of mind. Is it a 
lack of imagination or creative ability that continually shortchanges the 
public? Thank heaven for the few remaining tasteful programs and for Channel 
28. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbye U. Kelly, West Hills 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How sad it is that the networks feel they need to lower their standards to 
compete for ratings by using common "street" language. They have even put the 
words in the mouths of children, which indicates to those watching that this is 
acceptable language. These words become a part of the general public's speech 
that is unacceptable to many viewers who find such language abhorrent. 
</P>
<P>
Our literary and educational levels have already dropped to new lows. This 
language is not necessary nor does it really add to the shows. 
</P>
<P>
Mary K. Goodhart, Monarch Beach 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I am a firm believer in: "There is a time and place for everything." There is a 
time for adult programs and for children and teen programs. I believe it is 
time to start taking care of our children. I know our children should not be 
subjected to such frank, obscene language. As a society we should be doing 
everything in our power to protect them from such. 
</P>
<P>
Maureen McClement, Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The great classic shows didn't need bad language. Maybe it's a crutch for 
writers who can't think of something better to say. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Ortega, Saugus 
</P>
<P>
I do not use "four-letter words" in my workplace nor do my co-workers or 
acquaintances and friends (except in extreme anger). I personally don't 
consider them a necessary additive on TV, and will usually not watch shows that 
use them. 
</P>
<P>
J.M. Peterson, Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Do we have to lower standards to appeal to the less civilized? Do we have to be 
crude to make a point? 
</P>
<P>
Look at the ratings. What an example for our children. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Stuy, Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frank language? Realistic? 
</P>
<P>
Never have we spoken, nor our friends and neighbors in our middle-class 
neighborhood spoken, the language we hear prevalent on TV series today. Because 
of the coarse language we no longer turn to any sitcoms. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia A. Ongstad, Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Should TV use "frank language?" My answer is NO! A 6-year-old may say "you 
suck" without knowing what it means and probably because it was heard on TV. I 
don't understand why this kind of "realism" is necessary, and it certainly does 
not improve the quality of any show. Why do we want to encourage the use of 
vulgarity anyway? I've already stopped going to most movies because of the 
never-ending vulgarity. 
</P>
<P>
M. Eiser, Canoga Park 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I am appalled and outraged at the use of the vulgarity and dirty language that 
is being used on television shows. My family turns off the channel when the 
language used is more than we can digest. 
</P>
<P>
To take a small child like Sarah Martineck (on CBSU "Uncle Buck") and expose 
her to the filthy language of this world is a crime, and contributes to the 
delinquency of a minor. 
</P>
<P>
The Burwell Family, Northridge 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low-life language never adds to a show. Review some of the exceptional shows of 
the '60s, especially situation comedies. 'sing young children to promote such 
purposes is awful. I'm restricting more shows each year. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Hartman, Cypress 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I gave up sitcoms when Archie Bunker flushed his toilet on television, so I 
would not watch "Uncle Buck." However, putting garbage language in the mouth of 
a darling little girl like Sarah Martineck is disgusting on the part of the 
writers. 
</P>
<P>
My husband and I love good police and law dramas and looked forward to "The 
Trials of Rosie O'Neill." It was on for 15 minutes. Rosie is no lady and we are 
not interested in her foul mouth or her live-in situation. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Culbertson, Arleta 
</P>
<P>
Accomplished actors with good material do not need vulgar language to keep up 
with the times. Good taste is timeless.

L.A. Southwest 22, Ventura 6 -- Southwest, coming off three consecutive losses, 
not only held visiting Ventura to six points but intercepted five passes, 
sacked the quarterback seven times, blocked two passes and recovered a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars were held to only 66 yards rushing and 214 yards overall, but made 
the most of their opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest scored first when David Mack intercepted quarterback Tim Albrent and 
returned the ball 57 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars scored again after Mack intercepted his second pass. On the first 
play after the interception, quarterback Craig Manigo passed 45 yards to wide 
receiver Michael Stevens for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Mack's third interception set up Southwest's last touchdown. From Ventura's 
35-yard line, Manigo pitched the ball to Jessie Wallace, who passed to a wide 
open Robert Avery. TONY SOLTIS

Harbor 25, West L.A. 21 -- Vincent Gardner's interception with 5:57 left set up 
the winning touchdown in a Western State Conference game at West L.A. 
</P>
<P>
The victory improved Harbor's record to 3-2 and 2-2 in the WSC. West L.A. fell 
to 3-2 and 2-2 in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks held a 18-7 halftime lead, but they fell behind midway through the 
third quarter and trailed until quarterback Glenn Baham ran seven yards for a 
touchdown, three plays after Gardner's interception. 
</P>
<P>
Baham also connected with Tim Wagner, a former Rolling HIlls High standout, for 
a five-yard touchdown pass late in the second quarter. The sophomore from Serra 
High completed 12 of 20 passing attempts for 119 yards. he threw two 
interceptions and was sacked eight times. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor also scored on a one-yard run by Camron Pitcher and an eight-yard run by 
Bill Harris. 
</P>
<P>
"We might not have played pretty, but we played hard and that's important to 
me," Harbor Coach Don Weems said. 
</P>
<P>
West L.A.'s Chris Kates returned punts of 99 and 91 yards for touchdowns. Myron 
Phillips scored the Oilers' other touchdown on a one-yard run. IRENE GARCIA

Campaign funds -- A headline in Thursday's San Gabriel Valley section indicated 
that Diamond Bar City Councilman Paul Horcher, the Republican nominee in the 
52nd Assembly District, had raised substantially more campaign funds than his 
Democratic opponent because of loans he had made to himself. Actually, Horcher 
raised $104,998 without the loans, and his Democratic opponent, Gary Neely, 
raised $22,586. 
</P>

Also, the article should have stated that Horcher is paying consultant Harvey

LOOKS: POWER HAIR DO'S AND DON'TS; 
</P>
<P>
HOW HAIR MAKES THE DIFFERENCE IN WINNING FRIENDS AND INFLUENCING PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN GRIGSBY BATES, Karen Grigsby Bates is a frequent contributor to this 
column. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Power: How to get it, and how to let people know you've got it, are motivations 
that fuel this country. And "power hair" is definitely one of the surest ways 
to project or bolster an image; it identifies -- even for those who don't 
follow the game -- who's on first. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean you have to rush out and get the 'do du jour. "I don't think 
power hair has anything to do with fashion," says Kenneth, the legendary New 
York society hairdresser who has coiffed fashion icons such as the late Babe 
(Mrs. William) Paley and Jacqueline Onassis. "You usually find power hair on 
the heads of people who are pretty sure of who they are," he says. And while 
the actual profile of a power head varies from individual to individual, there 
are a number of common denominators. "Power hair is usually very neat," he 
explains. "It looks clean and expensive. And it's very well cut, if nothing 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Power styles vary from city to city. What's powerful in Los Angeles might look 
overpowering in Washington (where, with very few exceptions, the influential 
pay little attention to the vagaries of fashion) and simply silly in New York. 
Georgette Mosbacher, wife of the secretary of commerce, sports a flamboyant red 
coif, for example, that is more Beverly Hills than Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
But Washington often sets the standard for politically powerful hair: Jack 
Kennedy, our first telegenic president, definitely had it. His youthful, 
chestnut locks emphasized a break with the buzz-cut establishment and spawned a 
bevy of imitators. Former cabinet secretary Jack Kemp's Kennedy-esque coif did 
him no harm with the voters; nor did former California Sen. John Tunney suffer 
as a result of his thatch. Jesse Jackson, on the other hand, sets a power-hair 
precedent -- his inky waves complement his forceful, often theatrical profile. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush has power hair that is in total sync with who he is: His gracefully 
aging profile, with its lanky athleticism and receding hairline, bespeaks 
generations of wealth and breeding -- summer homes, yachts and private tennis 
courts. Which, of course, is the stuff of which he's made. 
</P>
<P>
It's probably testimony to Ronald Reagan's personal persuasiveness that he was 
able to project a powerful aura -- despite his arcane, pomaded pompadour. And 
dye is usually a distinct power-hair no-no, but tell that to Sen. Strom 
Thurmond (R-S.C.), "the senator with the hair color of the month," notes one 
Washington insider. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Reagan's aggressively sprayed and back-combed Bistro Gardens look was 
powerful while the Reagans were, but, according to one observer, it "has 
returned to the wealthy suburbia from when it came. Thank God." In its place is 
Barbara Bush's defiantly gray mane, which might be considered dowdy on nearly 
anyone else but which earned her an admiring sobriquet: the Silver Fox. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy-hitters in the business world usually sport a variation of John Malloy's 
dress-for-success look, but there are exceptions: Donald Trump's long, 
disarrayed honey-blondness works because his personality is equally outrageous. 
(Estranged-wife Ivana's brassy old bouffant was not powerful, but her new 
Bardot-ish buttery upsweep definitely is.) David Rockefeller's slicked-back, 
no-bother look suggests that he has more important things than hair to worry 
about in running a financial dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
Power hair on Angelenos is harder to categorize: Creative Artists Agency 
president and CEO Mike Ovitz has it, because, as one producer points out, 
"every goddamn thing on Mike Ovitz is, de facto, powerful." Jack Valenti's 
splendidly silver hair is definitely powerful -- he looks as if he should be 
deciding the fate of movies' ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Media personalities are acutely aware of the believability quotient and have, 
by and large, sincere, if not flawless, hair. Dan Rather's side-parted 
salt-and-pepper coif is carefully boyish (although viewers watching his 
coverage of the Bay Area earthquake last year discovered that he's going bald 
on top); ABC anchor Peter Jennings' hairline is clearly receding (the studio 
stylist is going through mighty machinations to comb it forward and over), and 
NBC's Tom Brokaw's hair, though often barely kempt, is all there and graying 
nicely. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most powerful male hair in network television is the most-often 
ridiculed: Ted Koppel's. The "Nightline" anchor's coppery helmet has been 
likened to Howdy Doody's. Measured against the prevailing fashion wisdom, 
Koppel's head may look a little silly, but it is immediately identifiable -- 
and different from his competition's, which means power in his industry. 
</P>
<P>
Network women are not allowed such flexibility. It's widely accepted that 
network execs are still looking for blond beauties. The early ascendancy of 
such reporters as Lesley Stahl, Diane Sawyer and the late Jessica Savitch 
indicates that maybe the folks at Clairol knew what they were talking about -- 
not only do blondes have more fun, but they also get to be substitute anchors 
first. 
</P>
<P>
Lesley Stahl has made a curious fashion statement lately -- her fair, fine hair 
is blown into an anachronistic bouffant. "She likes big hair, and she's the 
boss," says Stahl's stylist, Robin Weir, who also did Nancy Reagan's hair. And 
maybe she knows something we don't. "I've been blowing up more heads this month 
than I have in years," Weir says. 
</P>
<P>
There are signs that the blond requirement soon may be nothing but a bitter 
memory. The most popular -- and powerful -- woman in network TV at the moment 
is the once-blond Jane Pauley, who, in her last year of the "Today" show, 
quietly returned to her natural light-brown color. And voters in the Washington 
Journalism Review last year gave high marks to two other non-blondes: Maria 
Shriver and Meredith Vieira. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Hollywood, however, blond ambition still reigns. Meryl Streep and 
Monroe-like Madonna are tops at the box office. Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler 
(who alternates between blond and reddish-blond) run their own production 
companies. "Entertainment Tonight" anchors Mary Hart and John Tesh are blonds, 
as is star "ET" field reporter Leeza Gibbons. Some things never change. 
</P>
<P>
Others do, and with great caprice. For a while, ponytails for men were the 
rage. Now the only person who sports one without looking passe is Peter Guber 
(of the Guber-Peters duo that now runs Columbia). Arsenio Hall's extreme 
haircut -- nude sides, flattop -- insists that middle America accept him on his 
terms, which it has. 
</P>
<P>
Power hair has been around since Sampson, and, as with every rule, there is one 
exception: One of the most powerful heads in Los Angeles belongs to super-agent 
Swifty Lazar -- who is totally bald.

SADDLEBACK WINS FIRST COUNTY TITLE

<P>
As expected, the Saddleback High School boys' cross-country team won the seeded 
race at the Orange County Championships Saturday at Irvine Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
It was the team's first county title, but the victory was expected because the 
the Roadrunners are top-ranked in Southern Section's Division I. But what came 
as a surprise was La Habra, which finished in third place with 145 points. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback had 69 points: El Toro was second with 109. Dana Hills was fourth, 
with 146 points. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills senior Daniel Neidnagel, who is undefeated this season, won the 
three-mile race in 15 minutes 19 seconds. Saddleback's Eddie Salinas put on a 
last-minute surge to finish second in 15:36 and Villa Park's Danny Simon was 
third (15:37). 
</P>
<P>
La Habra, which was not ranked in the top 10 of the county coaches' poll, was 
led by senior Mark Gonzales, who was second in last season's Division II state 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales was expected to challenge Niednagel for the title, but after running 
with the leaders through the one-mile mark, he dropped back, finishing ninth in 
15:48. 
</P>
<P>
"I went into this race real scared because I have never raced against Mark 
Gonzales before, except at the Kinney regional meet last year," Niednagel said. 
"But I was surprised -- I thought they (the pack) would go with me." 
</P>
<P>
Niednagel led by at least 75 yards with a half-mile left and wasn't really 
challenged. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Gonzales said he never felt he was in the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I just did bad," Gonzales said. "I never felt like I was up there for first. I 
just went through the motions without doing anything." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales may have felt bad, but Saddleback Coach Mel Silva was elated. The 
Roadrunners didn't compete in the meet last year, opting to run on that day in 
the Mt. San Antonio College Invitational in Walnut, a meet conducted on the 
same course as the Southern Section prelims and finals. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a great honor to win it (Saturday)," Silva said. "We went to Mt. SAC 
last year because we had a younger team and I felt it was important for them to 
get some experience on that course. But the kids came through this year and 
it's a neat feeling -- they really wanted this." 
</P>
<P>
Katella senior Martha Pinto posted the fastest girls' time and won her fourth 
county title, winning the varsity race in 17:26, nine seconds faster than her 
time last year. Valencia's Heather Killeen was second (18:06). 
</P>
<P>
Irvine won the girls' seeded race with 88 points. Dana Hills, which started the 
season slowly, but has improved, was second (100) and Canyon was third (138). 
Woodbridge's Kay Nekota, a freshman who started running in age-group 
competition three years ago, won in 17:49. 
</P>
<P>
Nekota and Irvine sophomore Kelly Roda ran together until the last half-mile 
when Nekota pulled away coming down the last hill. Roda was second in 17:56. 
Nekota said she wasn't surprised Roda stayed with her. 
</P>
<P>
"She's been doing good this season," Nekota said. "She was looking very strong 
during the race, but I erased it out of my mind and thought I could beat her." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meet Notes: 
</P>
<P>
Also finishing for Saddleback were: Albert Ochoa (eighth, 15:47), Joey Heredia 
(14th, 15:56), Johny Ochoa (18th, 15:58) and Mario Vela (27th, 16:11). Los 
Amigos' Lihn Le won the boys' Race 1 in 15:56, an approximate time because an 
earlier race overlapped and Le didn't receive an official time. Katella 
sophomore Mike Love won Race 2 (15:42). San Clemente's Terri Smythers, who 
skipped last spring's track season, won the girls' Race 3 (19:15). San Clemente 
won the team title (24 points) with Orange Lutheran second (71). Orange 
Lutheran, one of the top small schools, was led by Amber Parkinson's 
second-place finish (19:45). Several of the top county teams will compete 
Saturday at the Mt. SAC Invitational in Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
At the Brea-Olinda Cross-Country Invitational at Carbon Canyon Park: 
</P>
<P>
Santiago was the top Orange County finisher in the boys' and girls' divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The Santiago boys' team finished fifth behind first-place Bishop Amat. Leading 
Santiago was Jose Salcedo, who finished ninth overall in 17 minutes 4 seconds 
on the five-kilometer course. Moorpark's Manuel Lopes was the top finisher. 
Other Orange County finishers were Savanna's Ray Estrada (16:44, third place) 
and Anaheim's Oscar Malo (16:55, fifth). 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' division, Santiago was third and Chino finished first. Leticia 
Perez (21:08) finished fifth to lead Santiago. Brea-Olinda's Dina Bloomfield 
(21:02) finished fourth and Garden Grove's Natalie Lupicia (21:34) was sixth.
