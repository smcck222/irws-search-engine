<TEXT>
<P>
Like the mythological Egyptian bird that consumed itself by fire and rose 
renewed from its ashes, Richard Nixon is a latter-day phoenix. Defeated by John 
F. Kennedy for the presidency in 1960 and by Pat Brown for the California 
governorship in 1962, Nixon told a press conference: "You won't have Dick Nixon 
to kick around any more." 
</P>
<P>
As so often in his career, his words masked the reality of his actions. He at 
once began working toward the comeback that culminated in his two victorious 
campaigns for the White House in 1968 and 1972. Resigning the presidency in 
1974 rather than face impeachment and conviction for Watergate crimes, Nixon 
began his final battle: the vindication by history. Making the case for himself 
in his 1978 memoirs, he has worked to convince Americans of his greatness as a 
foreign-policy leader and to obscure the truth of Watergate and other 
improprieties by blocking release of documents and tapes that might further 
blight his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
His current campaign enjoys some success. A November, 1988, Louis Harris poll, 
asking a cross section of Americans to rank the last nine Presidents from 
F.D.R. to Reagan in 11 categories, rated Nixon as "best in foreign affairs," 
well ahead of all the others, except Reagan, who was a close second. 
</P>
<P>
Although a decisive plurality of the poll said that Nixon had set the lowest 
moral standards of all these Presidents, he scored better than Johnson, Ford, 
and Carter in several other categories. Having suffered the worst public 
humiliation of any President in U.S. history by resigning from office and 
having continued a spirited fight for vindication, Nixon has partly redeemed 
himself with some Americans who find considerable appeal in a man who doggedly 
struggles to overcome self-inflicted defeats. 
</P>
<P>
Two new biographies by Roger Morris and Stephen Ambrose will undercut Nixon's 
efforts to create a positive historical image. A former member of the State 
Department and the National Security Council, who resigned in protest against 
Nixon's 1970 invasion of Cambodia, Morris has become a prize-winning 
journalist. To be published next month, his massively detailed 900-page book, 
the first of a multi-volume biography, takes the story only through Nixon's 
election as vice president in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
The book tells us more about Nixon than most readers would ever care to know, 
but therein also lies its strength. It is the most detailed and authoritative 
reconstruction of Nixon's life and career we have ever had. Building his 
account on materials in 35 archives and from hundreds of oral-history 
interviews, Morris dispassionately recounts the story of Nixon's early life in 
California, at the Duke University law school, in a Whittier law practice, in 
the Navy during World War II, and, above all, in postwar politics. Nixon's 1946 
congressional race against Jerry Voorhis, his role in the Alger Hiss case as a 
member of the House Un-American Activities Committee, his 1950 race for the 
U.S. Senate against Helen Gahagan Douglas, his campaign to become Dwight 
Eisenhower's running mate, and his part in the 1952 presidential election never 
has been told more completely and evenhandedly. 
</P>
<P>
Morris shows a keen understanding of Nixon's strengths and importance as a 
representative American. He describes him as a man of extraordinary diligence 
and determination, with an exceptional feel for public sentiment that propelled 
his meteoric rise in mid-century American politics. In high school, Morris 
writes, Nixon's "grades were nearly perfect. . . . There was a dour fierceness 
of application and ambition about the record." But he struggled with geometry, 
scoring only B's the first two quarters. ". . . When the teacher once presented 
a special problem, promising an A for the next quarter for its solution 
overnight, he worked until 4 a.m., got the grade, and finished the course with 
an A." 
</P>
<P>
His first campaign for a House seat was a microcosm of his capacity to succeed 
in politics. The campaign was "a political balancing act between the warring 
wings of the Republican Party -- a matter of conviction as well as expedience 
and opportunity -- that Richard Nixon was to practice with an almost 
instinctive brilliance throughout his career." No detail that could serve the 
campaign escaped his notice. "So complete was his attention to detail, so 
insistent the control . . . that the candidate himself even decided the precise 
telephone poles and other locations 'where campaign posters should be placed to 
the best advantage.' " He would stand "in the print shop as his political 
pamphlets came off the press, making certain every word and layout was exact." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's genius for reaching a mass audience was demonstrated in his 1952 
"Checkers" speech defending himself against charges of a secret campaign slush 
fund used for personal ends. Speaking to more than 60 million people, about 
half the possible TV viewers in the United States, Nixon gave a performance 
that Hollywood mogul Darryl F. Zanuck called "the greatest production I have 
ever seen." Moving some people to tears and generating 4 million overwhelmingly 
favorable telegrams, letters, cards, and calls, Nixon convinced Americans not 
of his innocence but of his shared identity with them as a hard-working, 
ordinary fellow who loved his country and dreamed of a better life for himself 
and his family. In Morris' words: "For a single dramatic half-hour in the 
autumn of 1952 -- as for so many smaller audiences before and after -- Richard 
Nixon had become the quintessential American politician." 
</P>
<P>
It is not Nixon's political astuteness that echoes through Morris' book, 
however, but his all-consuming ambition, his determination to win at any price. 
Fellow students and teachers at Whittier High remember his debating tactics and 
race for student-body president as the actions of someone ready to rationalize 
bad means for reaching self-serving goals. The same attitude dominated his 
later political career, especially the Alger Hiss case, which did so much to 
make Nixon a prominent national figure. His objective never was to weigh the 
evidence in a search for the truth but to make his reputation by getting Hiss. 
At a crucial moment in 1948, when it appeared that the case against Hiss for 
stealing government documents and lying about his actions seemed about to 
collapse, Nixon threw a private fit. "Oh, my god, this is the end of my 
political career," he shrieked. "My whole career is ruined." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Ambrose's biography, the second of a three-volume work, begins in 1962 
when, he says, Nixon launched his second drive for the presidential nomination, 
and ends with his reelection to the White House in 1972. Ambrose, a 
distinguished professor of history at the University of New Orleans and author 
of a fine two-volume biography of Eisenhower, has produced a study that is 
equally damning of Nixon but less convincing than Morris' book. 
</P>
<P>
Ambrose's biography rests on a more limited body of sources. Although he makes 
extensive use of Nixon's jottings on news summaries compiled during his first 
term and of some letters and memos in his presidential papers, the book largely 
rests on printed materials, memoirs and secondary accounts by journalists. 
Ambrose has also done some interviewing, but much less than Morris. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a book that does not take us much beyond what we already knew 
about Nixon in the decade after 1962. Ambrose says that "It is not news that he 
(Nixon) was devious, manipulative . . . passionate in his hatreds, 
self-centered, untruthful, untrusting, and at times so despicable that one 
wants to avert one's eyes in shame and embarrassment. Nor is it news that this 
same man could be considerate, straightforward, sympathetic and helpful, or 
that he was blessed with great talent, a superb intellect, an awesome memory, 
and a remarkable ability to see things whole, especially on a global scale and 
with regard to the world balance of power. If he was the ultimate cynic, a 
President without principle in domestic politics, he was also the ultimate 
realist, a President without peer in foreign affairs." 
</P>
<P>
The most interesting feature of Ambrose's book is the extent to which he 
contradicts his own assertion about Nixon's matchless leadership in world 
affairs. Ambrose has warm praise for Nixon as a President with a world view who 
understood the need for a "new era of negotiations" with the Russians and the 
Chinese. Indeed, Nixon had the imagination and foresight to do what no other 
post-1945 President had done -- seek detente with the Soviets and normal 
relations with China that became essential steps in the developing end to the 
Cold War. Yet Ambrose is sharply critical of Nixon's slow withdrawal from 
Vietnam, which cost so many additional lives for no productive end. He also 
faults Nixon's policies toward Cambodia, Chile, India and Pakistan, describing 
them as leaving a legacy of serious unresolved problems.

In time, Ralph Waldo Emerson said, every scoundrel becomes a hero. Richard 
Nixon is not there yet.

HELP! HIS BEST FRIEND IS TURNING INTO A SHEEP!; 
</P>
<P>
A WILD SHEEP CHASE BY HARUKI MURAKAMI; TRANSLATED FROM THE JAPANESE BY ALFRED 
BIRNBAUM(KODANSHA INTERNATIONAL: $18.95; 320 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
I remember an afternoon picnic in Bel-Air that a motion-picture executive gave 
to honor the visit of my husband. He warmly welcomed my two sons standing 
beside me. Then, as if I were not there at all, he stepped forward to greet the 
next incoming guests, ignoring me completely, assuming automatically that any 
non-Caucasian accompanying children to their home was an au pair or a nanny, 
hardly an invited guest. 
</P>
<P>
So much for image and preconception -- and prejudice, appearance as opposed to 
reality. And yet it is image, often self-conscious and self-deluding, 
superficial and affected, that explains, I think, the phenomenal popularity of 
the work of Haruki Murakami in Japan -- especially with the young, that 
generation of Japan's postwar baby boom who began to come of age in the '60s 
preaching revolution and has wound up reading manga -- comic books -- on 
crowded commuter trains. 
</P>
<P>
These are the people who have taken their places sheep-like on the conveyor 
belt of Japanese society as salaried men and housewives, but still like to 
harbor images of themselves as cool and hip and laid-back, sophisticated and 
aware, and, yes, above all, Western. In their hierarchy of taste, a Burger King 
hamburger and a piece of the Colonel's chicken rank higher than sushi. Phony is 
the Western word that most easily comes to mind. 
</P>
<P>
Murakami's two most recent novels, whose titles in Japanese are "Norwegian 
Wood," as in the Beatles' song title, and "Dance, Dance, Dance," as in the 
English expression, have sold about 5 million copies, cloth, in Japan. Young 
Japanese readers are said to be as much taken with Murakami's own personal life 
style as with his books themselves. After graduation from college, instead of 
getting a corporate job, he ran his own coffee shop. He also embarked upon a 
career as a translator, serving the work of American writers such as Raymond 
Carver. 
</P>
<P>
"A Wild Sheep Chase" is an earlier novel of Murakami's that evidences both his 
celebrated flair and his characteristic weaknesses. First, he is immensely 
readable, his pages as easily consumable as bar peanuts. In a staccato, 
hard-boiled American style, he tattoos out short, snappy sentences of 
world-weary deadpan. And he is as promiscuous in name-brand dropping as some of 
the more notorious American brand-name novelists. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a sample paragraph from "A Wild Sheep Chase": 
</P>
<P>
"It was already dark out. I slipped some change, my cigarettes and a lighter 
into my pocket, put on my tennis shoes, and stepped outside. At my neighborhood 
dive, I drank a beer while listening to the latest Brothers Johnson record. I 
ate my chicken cutlet while listening to a Bill Withers record. I had some 
coffee while listening to Maynard Ferguson's Star Wars. After all that, I felt 
as if I'd hardly eaten anything." 
</P>
<P>
Does it not sound more like a black Raymond Carver or a recycled Raymond 
Chandler or some new ghetto private eye than a contemporary Japanese novelist? 
And if it were not for the next sentence -- "They cleared away my coffee cup 
and I put three ten-yen coins into the pink public phone and rang up my 
partner" -- the Martian reader could scarcely guess that the description 
rendered is theoretically one of contemporary Japan. 
</P>
<P>
I don't remember Murakami's plots as ever having been considered one of his 
strong points as a writer. In fact, no one I know can quite recall any of them. 
And after reading "A Wild Sheep Chase" in both English and Japanese I am still 
hard put to sum it up. But let me at least try to give you a sense of the book. 
Its basic structure is that of a mystery or suspense novel. Unfortunately, the 
mystery and suspense do not begin until about halfway through. Up to that 
point, it seems successively a meditation and memoir about the existential 
generation of the '60s; an examination of an ear fetish which might be 
interpreted either as a homage or a satire of Tanazaki's well known foot 
fixation; and a chronicle of the dissolution of a marriage in which 
communication has been so poor that it is not until the partners' final parting 
that the idea of either possibly ever having wanted to have children comes up. 
</P>
<P>
After the extended throat-clearing comes the kind of traditional ghost tale 
that both children and manga readers might enjoy. This involves a power-hungry 
sheep, with a peculiar star brand on its back, which, starting with Genghis 
Khan himself, has entered into people, Dybbuk-like, and taken over their lives 
until it decides to move on, self-exorcised, leaving the vacated human premises 
tragically weak and helpless. One of the victims of the sheep is a right-wing 
political boss, another is a sheep professor, and a third is a teen-age friend 
of the hero. Which explains how the hero, himself a most passive ad-agency 
co-owner, is drawn into the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, I must say I felt strange reading something so imitative and 
derivative in tone from American writing in English translation. I am not sure 
anyone in Japan ever has talked the way Murakami's characters do. Not that 
Alfred Birnbaum's excellent translation has not gotten Murakami's sentences 
down exactly right. But it is Murakami himself who seems more interested in 
imitation than in substance, in appearance and image than in reality. And so, 
too, do his millions of young readers, who evidently prefer browsing through 
manufactured- product labels and borrowed images than in feeling the raw levels 
inherent in genuine human emotion.

THE SINS OF THE PREACHER;

<P>
FORGIVEN THE RISE AND FALL OF JIM BAKKER AND THE PTL MINISTRY BY CHARLES E. 
SHEPARD (ATLANTIC MONTHLY PRESS: $22.95; 656 PP.; 0-87113-293-1) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Edwin Harrell, Harrell is University Scholar at the University of 
Alabama at Birmingham and has written biographies of Oral Roberts and Pat 
Robertson (Harper &amp; Row). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Judge Robert "Maximum Bob" Potter, who recently presided over the trial of 
Jim Bakker, passes sentence on the basis of this book, Bakker will be confined 
to prison until the Lord returns. And if the Lord reads this book before He 
returns, Jim Bakker may want to stay in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Charles E. Shepard became a reporter for the Charlotte Observer in 1978 and 
from 1984 through 1987 he tracked Bakker and the sprawling PTL ministry. 
Shepard broke the Jessica Hahn story; his probing of PTL's financial misdeeds 
helped to topple the ministry in 1987 and won Pulitzer Prizes for him and his 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
In the months leading up to the scandal, Shepard was titillated by tipsters, 
misled and threatened by insiders, and bridled by his responsible superiors in 
the Observer editorial office -- the kind of treatment that hones the obsessive 
personalities that God gave to investigative reporters. He continued to collect 
and assimilate information for months after Bakker resigned, and this book is a 
detailed chronological recitation of his research. While Shepard gives more 
biographical information on Bakker than one will find elsewhere, about 90% of 
the book discusses the years after the Bakkers moved to Charlotte and began 
building the PTL empire in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The rise and fall of the PTL ministry is a complicated story, played out over 
nearly 15 years of triumph and tragedy. Shepard's book is a Columbo-type 
mystery; you know the villain, but the evidence has to be painstakingly 
assembled. "Forgiven" is, in fact, classic mystery, filled with enough suspense 
to keep the attention of a reading public that must be jaded on preacher 
scandals. It is a skillful piece of writing. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Bakker story provides ample material for a good mystery -- sex, 
money, power plays, cover-ups and lying, disgusting and shady characters and a 
few heroes. Shepard's coup as a reporter was documenting Bakker's moment of 
unspiritual rapture with Hahn in a Clearwater Beach, Fla., hotel in December, 
1980, but his book is laced with the sordid details of Bakker's homosexual 
trysts and his fondness for masturbation as well as Tammy's passion for other 
men. Most of the book, however, is a long, but never boring, account of the 
organizational chaos and financial irresponsibility that landed Bakker and his 
cronies in court, and the contortions of PTL's leaders that kept the critics at 
bay for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The Bakker story falls into three segments. In the first 60 pages of this book, 
Shepard describes Bakker's journey from a star-struck Pentecostal youth in 
Muskegon, Mich., to a traveling Pentecostal evangelist accompanied by his wife, 
Tammy, to a religious television personality chafing under the domination of 
Pat Robertson and Paul Crouch. In 1975, Bakker moved to Charlotte and gained 
control of the PTL, and for the next five years his ministry expanded 
dramatically. PTL's success came partly because of Bakker's talents as a 
television personality, and partly because, as with other religious television 
entrepreneurs, he profited from the expansion of cable television. During these 
years, Bakker survived an FCC investigation of his deceptive fund-raising 
tactics, aided by the favorable political climate for religious conservatives 
in the wake of the 1980 election. 
</P>
<P>
The decade of the 1980s was filled with ecstasy and agony for Jim and Tammy 
Bakker. "The year 1981 was a watershed for the rationalization of greed at 
PTL," writes Shepard, noting that the earnings of the Bakkers rose to $115,899 
in 1981, to more than $420,000 the next year and more than $675,000 in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The tasteless extravagance of the Bakkers and PTL's other leaders seemed to 
escalate in proportion to the financial and legal distress of the ministry, 
climaxing in a feeding frenzy as the day of reckoning approached. While PTL's 
gaudy success was taken by insiders as proof of God's approval, the ministry 
constantly tottered on the edge of financial collapse and the Bakkers' private 
lives turned increasingly troubled and tragic. 
</P>
<P>
The most portentous changes at PTL in the 1980s were in the ministry's 
leadership. Prior to 1980, Bakker recruited and lost a series of responsible 
and ethical managers who tried to take the advice of competent lawyers and 
accountants. But Bakker was irresistibly drawn to power, he wanted freedom to 
follow the leading of the Holy Spirit. One by one his principled chaperons 
left, disillusioned or disgusted. 
</P>
<P>
The cast of characters surrounding the Bakkers in the final years included the 
talented but profane evangelist John Wesley Fletcher, who orchestrated the Hahn 
affair and later claimed to have had sexual relations with Jim Bakker, and 
David and James Taggart, talented and stylish young men who fabricated a 
genteel family history. David Taggart, a bright and courteous executive with 
"distinctly effeminate" manners, wielded enormous power in the PTL organization 
and diverted huge sums of money to his brother and himself. When Taggart was 
asked under oath whether he had sexual relations with Bakker, his attorney 
invoked the Fifth Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Many thought that the reputations of Bakker and PTL might be salvaged by the 
appointment of Richard Dortch to the board in 1979 and his acceptance of an 
executive position in 1984. Dortch was a respected leader in the Assemblies of 
God and his skill in deflecting investigations saved Bakker's hide for months. 
In the end, Dortch became, in lawyer Roy Grutman's words, "an unmitigated 
liar," the chief architect of a payoff to coverup the Hahn affair, and a 
confessed felon. Dortch takes center stage in the closing third of this book, 
and his moral collapse is as intriguing as that of Bakker. 
</P>
<P>
There are several smaller stories within this story. Among the other television 
evangelists, Jimmy Swaggart, Paul Ankerberg and Jerry Falwell played crucial, 
and apparently honorable, roles in bringing PTL to account. The leaders of the 
Assemblies of God, Bakker's denomination, ducked responsibility for month after 
month, although Shepard credits the church with finally facing the issue 
squarely. Finally, there is the soul-searching at the Charlotte Observer, 
publishers and editors worrying about fairness and popularity balancing 
reporters who had whiffed the stink of corruption. In the end, the Observer did 
the job on Bakker. 
</P>
<P>
Shepard's fine book only begins to explore the personality of Bakker. He 
believes that Bakker has a "narcissistic personality disorder," causing him to 
crave adulation but shun personal intimacy. Many insiders considered Bakker a 
creative genius whose success proved his spirituality. The theology behind it 
may be grotesque, but building a Christian theme park was an idea so ripe for 
success that it took incompetence and greed on a grand scale to ruin it. 
However, Bakker's best ideas, argues Shepard, were shamelessly borrowed from 
Pat Robertson and Walt Disney. 
</P>
<P>
Shepard is least apt when discussing Bakker's religious beliefs, although he 
tries to understand the Pentecostal mind-set. Bakker is part of a religious 
subculture in which faith is more important than reality. Shepard catches this 
mind-set when he describes Bakker's effort to explain to the Federal 
Communications Commission that the untruths he told on television were actually 
true because they were spoken in faith. Bakker becomes possible, and 
believable, only if one imagines that in the remote recesses of his mind Bakker 
actually believed that he and his outrageous conduct had the stamp of divine 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
It is not a major distraction that this book was published before Bakker has 
exhausted the appeals process. The trial may not be finished, but the PTL story 
is. It is a ribald, repugnant and extremely sad tale. Shepard's telling of it 
is well worth reading.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: SEARCHING FOR ROBERT JOHNSON BY PETER GURALNICK

Robert Johnson is among the most influential -- and most mythologized -- of all 
the early blues singers. He recorded only two sessions before his death in 1938 
(at age 27) at the hands of a jealous husband. A major source of inspiration to 
Muddy Waters as well as a generation of rock 'n' rollers, Johnson is known for 
a wrenching singing style that is reported to have left entire audiences in 
tears and for his adaptation of the "walking bass" style from boogie-woogie 
piano. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Guralnick tries to sort out the few facts that are known about the singer 
and to account for the myths surrounding him. Even the musicians who played 
with Johnson or learned from him give conflicting accounts of the man who is 
most often described as moody and shy. In the Mississippi Delta of the 1920s, 
Johnson's uncanny style was naturally attributed to his having made a pact with 
the devil, a popular theme in blues lore. Through the recollections of bluesmen 
who knew Johnson, Guralnick brings alive the time when musicians bitten by the 
blues bug wandered the country, hopping trains and entertaining at rent parties 
or "some house-rocking get-back at some plantation." 
</P>
<P>
In distinct contrast to the oral history passages, Guralnick compares Johnson's 
elusiveness to Shakespeare's, his lyrics to Catullus' (of all people). And in 
describing Johnson's famous song, "Hellhound on My Trail," he calls Johnson "a 
modern day Orpheus . . . struggling against the urge to look back." Sonja Bolle

MOHAMMED'S NIGHT JOURNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In their review of Amos Elon's "Jerusalem: City of Mirrors" (Book Review, Oct. 
1), Roger Friedland and Richard Hecht essentially revise history by writing: 
"The Muslims claim the cleared platform of Solomon's Temple as the launching 
pad for Mohammed's night journey to heaven. In fact, the Koran does not mention 
Jerusalem by name and the city was probably identified with the sacred text's 
'far distant mosque' only a century later by Damascus-based Umayyad sultans to 
whom Mecca was denied." 
</P>
<P>
I won't take offense at the snide tone of the words "launching pad," but the 
next set of facts needs to be aligned with history. Many things not spelled out 
in detail, or by name, in the Koran were later expanded upon by the Prophet in 
his hadith, or "traditions," recorded in his lifetime and selected as 
"canonical literature" through a strict verification process by early scholars. 
Jerusalem is mentioned by name in the most accepted hadith on the Night 
Journey: in the collection of Bukhari and Muslim. One piece of evidence for 
Mohammed's journey, in fact, was that he was able to describe Jerusalem in 
detail to people who had visited it in broad daylight on their caravan 
journeys, while the Prophet had never visited it except during the journey. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed's ability to describe the city convinced many skeptics that he had 
indeed been there, in whatever corporeal or non-corporeal mode one may wish to 
believe. So when the second Caliph (Omar), who was Caliph only two years after 
the death of the Prophet, came to Jerusalem himself, to find the spot he knew 
about through the Prophet's account, he built what is described as a rude 
wooden mosque above the rock of the prophet Solomon, large enough, it is 
reported, to hold 3,000 people at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-three years after the Prophet's death, Caliph Abd al-Malik built the 
opulent mosque, the Dome of the Rock, over the first Omar's mosque and 
established the golden dome that now stands above Solomon's Temple stone, the 
present mosque almost identical to the original with the exception of exterior 
Persian tiles in place of the original mosaic work. This is the event mentioned 
in the Elon review, but the location long before had been identified by 
Muslims, as most historians -- Muslim or not -- know. 
</P>
<P>
What is fretful in such an allegation is the possible sinister intent by the 
author of the book, and then by its subsequent reviewer. Israel and its 
supporters would like nothing more than to undermine any spiritual claims by 
Muslims, Arabs and Palestinians in particular, to the Mosque of the Rock as one 
of our three most revered spots on Earth. To simply say that it wasn't even 
identified until a century after the Prophet's death severely trivializes the 
Muslim's love for Jerusalem as the place where our Prophet began the experience 
of one of his greatest miracles, the Night Journey, during which he received 
the form of the Prayer as we do it five times a day to this day. The 
intimations of inauthenticity regarding Judaism's Tower of David and 
Christianity's Via Dolorosa also may be erroneous and would also be 
reprehensible history, but I leave it up to experts of those two faiths to 
correct.

AN UGLY JAZZ STORY; 
</P>
<P>
MILES THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY BY MILES DAVIS WITH QUINCY TROUPE (SIMON &amp; 
SCHUSTER: $22.45; 416 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Leonard Feather, Jazz critic Feather writes frequently for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As if the biographies and movies dealing with the narcotics problems of Billie 
Holiday, Art Pepper, Hampton Hawes, Bud Powell, Anita O'Day, Charlie Parker and 
Chet Baker were not enough, we are now confronted by the dreary, drug-ridden 
story of Miles Davis, which he had assured his public would be a book about 
music. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, the grinding monotony of these pages too often relegates music 
to secondary consideration, while interminable passages deal with the women he 
has beaten up, the musicians and managers he has fought with, and his 
off-on-off-on-off-on relationship with cocaine, heroin and other mind-altering 
impedimenta. 
</P>
<P>
What has long been an open secret is now in print: "From 1975 to early 1980 I 
didn't pick up my horn," Davis says. "Mostly during those four or five years . 
. . I just took a lot of cocaine (about $500 a day at one point) . . ." He also 
had sex with "all the women I could get into my house. I was also addicted to 
pills, like Percodan and Seconal, and I was drinking a lot . . . mostly I 
snorted coke, but sometimes I would inject coke and heroin into my leg; it's 
called a speedball and it was what killed John Belushi." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly it did not kill Miles Davis, but over the years dope ruined his health, 
his career and his marriages. Yet there is not enough mea culpa to sound a 
cautionary note; he gladly admits that he "really enjoyed" getting high on 
champagne, beer, Cognac and cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"Miles" begins as the story of a black boy who grew up with advantages that 
were unusual for any musician. His father, an oral surgeon in East St. Louis, 
prospered even during the Depression. His mother wore mink. While other black 
kids were struggling to escape from the ghetto, Miles Dewey Davis III was 
riding horses on a large family estate, or serving on the golf course as a 
caddy for his daddy. 
</P>
<P>
His parents sent him to study at Juilliard, but after a year there he preferred 
the company of beboppers. Barely out of his teens, on tour with the Billy 
Eckstine orchestra, he began using cocaine and heroin, starting a 5-year 
descent into a hell from which his father tried to rescue him. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that Davis' work, with its scurrility and pragmatic 
sensationalism, will reach the best seller lists. Moreover, it will be praised 
for its "painful honesty," though in fact it is riddled with major and minor 
factual errors that indicate dishonesty and sloppy research. Typically, after 
lambasting the promoter Monte Kay for making money off black people, he says 
that "today he's a millionaire living in Beverly Hills." Kay never lived in 
Beverly Hills; also, he died in May 1988. In another instance, Davis claims 
that many white musicians, after working for black leaders and being nobly 
treated by them, go out on their own and use only white sidemen, and that the 
late pianist Bill Evans was one such white man. The truth is that Evans, after 
leaving Davis, used the black drummer Philly Joe Jones, the black bassist Rufus 
Reid, and recorded with several other black artists. 
</P>
<P>
This is, in fact, an often untruthful, frequently ugly book without the 
slightest redeeming value as literature. Its almost inevitable acceptance in 
the marketplace bodes ill for the future documentation of musicology.

A rich compendium of stories, bons mots, scandals, etc., from the time of 
Richard III to Harold Wilson, guaranteed to delight trivia buffs. Americans 
unfamiliar with the intricacies of the British party system and its politics 
may miss the point of a few stories, but most of them can be enjoyed by the 
general reader. Many of these anecdotes suggest that Parliamentary debates are 
far more entertaining and literate than the deliberations of the U.S. Congress. 
In 1581, when the House of Commons "had sat long and done in effect nothing," 
the Speaker, Mr. Popham, was asked by Queen Elizabeth I, "Now, Mr. Speaker, 
what hath passed in the Lower House?" He replied, "If it pleases Your Majesty, 
seven weeks."

Black Elk, the Sioux holy man, explains the enormous importance his people 
attached to what is commonly called "the peace pipe." The Sioux believed that 
their ritual pipe was a gift from Wakan-Tanka, the Great Spirit, presented by 
his intermediary, the White Buffalo Cow Woman. Its sacred origins made it an 
essential element in tribal ceremonies involving the purification of the soul, 
relations with the dead and preparations for entering womanhood. These rituals 
focused on the relationships that linked humanity, the Earth, its other 
inhabitants and the all-embracing Great Spirit. At a time when people are 
realizing that they may have irrevocably damaged the planet, the Sioux 
veneration of the Earth seems a worthwhile subject for contemplation.

In this collection of essays, Time writer Lance Morrow considers a variety of 
topics -- television, the explosion of the space shuttle, the reputation of 
John F. Kennedy -- without offering a single original insight or opinion. 
President Kennedy died young but left an enduring myth, he proclaims with the 
timely wisdom of Columbus discovering America in 1892. Morrow reveals that the 
Vietnam War remains a divisive issue and that many Vietnam veterans are 
troubled. He presents Imelda Marcos' 2,700 pairs of shoes as a symbol of an 
irrational greed that is "a subdivision of the banality of evil," while 
subjecting his audience to the evil of banality. Prefab profundity for readers 
who have trouble grasping the 30-second sound bites on network news shows.

While Hollywood heavyweights battle for the right to film the story of Chico 
Mendes, martyred defender of Brazil's disappearing rain forests, a small 
company in Berkeley will probably get to the big screen early next year with a 
documentary on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit Amazonia Film Project is now in post-production on "Amazonia: 
Voices From the Rain Forest," which associate producer Kevin Pina calls the 
"first feature-length documentary ever produced on the Amazon rain forests." 
Included is an interview with Mendes that "personalizes the issue." 
</P>
<P>
Point of view: The people who live in the rain forests are the best line of 
defense against their destruction. 
</P>
<P>
The film makers did not get involved in Hollywood's race for dramatic rights 
when Mendes, former president of Brazil's National Council of Rubbertappers, 
was slain in December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew what we had and its value, and we had the support of his wife and 
indigenous organizations," Pena said. "So we stayed out (of the controversy)." 
</P>
<P>
Now the Film Project is lining up sponsors for a Dec. 7 benefit for the film at 
the Santa Monica Museum of Flying. Ed Asner, Kris Kristofferson and singer Don 
Henley are among those committed. John M. Wilson

IN THE ONE-TIME advertising campaign "What becomes a legend most?" a mink coat 
is wrapped around a superstar such as Lauren Bacall or Audrey Hepburn. In 
similar fashion, the mellifluous voice of actor Burgess Meredith envelops a 
bottle of legendary wine during a video shown to visitors at Jordan Vineyard 
and Winery in the Alexander Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Meredith, the video includes other celebrities -- movie stars, 
socialites and politicians. Among politicians who have visited the winery is 
Valentin Berezkov, a former Soviet envoy to the United States, who visited in 
1980. In a nod to free enterprise, he said: "Only in America could such a 
splendid wine estate be created in less than 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
When the first Jordan Cabernet, a 1976 vintage blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with 
about 6% Merlot, was released, most people agreed that it was "a pleasant 
little claret, a bit light, for early enjoyment" and drank it young. Those who 
held it, for tasting later, were stunned by its gloriously elegant 
transformation to absolute distinction. Thus began the legend of Jordan 
Cabernet, and it has been enhanced with each successive vintage, as has the 
Chardonnays, which went into production in the the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for this success is wine maker Rob Davis, who, after 13 years at 
Jordan, is still intrigued by the grapes. 
</P>
<P>
"Cabernet is stern, steady, no nonsense. But Merlot is so fruity, so lively. 
I've been increasing the amounts of Merlot in our Cabernet, as the harvests 
dictate. There's 12.5% in the '85. It brings a softer elegance. Every year, 
when the must is in the tanks, you can put your nose to the tank and get the 
fruity aromas. But when the '85 was in there, you could get that heady perfume 
coming around the building, in the driveway, outside," Davis said recently. 
</P>
<P>
I asked him about the American oak uprights, in which the young Jordan Cabernet 
has always spent its infancy. The flavor of oak was not detectable in the 
bouquet of the '85. "Oak is like an oven," he said. "You don't want to taste 
the oven; you want to taste the bread. We've been decreasing the American oak 
influence, favoring the French oak. But the style of the wine is still the 
same. That is from the vineyards." 
</P>
<P>
The two Jordan wines currently in release continue to support the winery's 
storied status. 
</P>
<P>
JORDAN 1986 ALEXANDER VALLEY CHARDONNAY -- ESTATE BOTTLED ($17.50). This 
Chardonnay undergoes malolactic fermentation and is aged in French oak five 
months before bottling. After that, it is aged in the bottle two years before 
release. (Most wines are released days or weeks after bottling, because holding 
wine in inventory is like holding money.) This wine is round, long, 
oak-evident, wholly impressive and bone-dry but silky. JORDAN 1985 ALEXANDER 
VALLEY CABERNET SAUVIGNON -- ESTATE BOTTLED ($19.50). From the exemplary '85 
vintage, this lovely ruby comes on fruit-first, suggesting cassis and cherries. 
It has assuring depth and full-bodied taste-character. As Davis suggested, wood 
is not evident in the wine's bouquet. The wine is not yet ready for pouring, 
with obvious puckery tannins pointing to its youth. Another two or three years 
of aging is needed for rounded maturity, but the balanced structure is in 
place. Jordan Cabernet's dependable elegance is here.

OIL-FREE COSMETICS AND MAKEUP SAVVY HELP ADULTS HIDE ACNE BLEMISHES

I FIGURED I'd have acne until I was 19, not 36," says a film industry executive 
who makes monthly visits to her dermatologist. Many people think acne plagues 
only teen-agers. But Southern California dermatologists report that at least 
25% of their patients who are troubled by acne are women over 30. 
</P>
<P>
While there is no cure for acne, it can be controlled with creams and lotions 
containing benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid or sulfur and, for more serious 
cases, Retin-A and antibiotics. Many dermatologists offer their own skin-care 
products for acne-ridden skin. Yet, even the most advanced medical care won't 
clear up a complexion overnight, so camouflage makeup is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
In Beverly Hills, makeup artist Valerie Sarnelle has celebrity clients, but she 
also caters to patients with skin problems. In fact, she gets almost as many 
referrals from dermatologists as from plastic surgeons. "Women want to know how 
to hide their acne breakouts without making them worse, and the doctors want to 
be sure that cosmetics are not going to aggravate the problem," says Sarnelle, 
owner of Valerie's Cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
To disguise acne, Sarnelle uses an oil-free primer -- yellow for pale to medium 
complexions and green for darker skin -- to reduce redness and balance skin 
tones. Taking a bit of yellow liquid from a bottle, she sponges it onto a 
client's face. Then with the tip of a makeup sponge, she applies a foundation 
that she has formulated for oily skin. Sarnelle suggests selecting makeup one 
shade darker than the natural tone to further conceal blemishes. An oil-free 
makeup she stocks also provides SPF 15 protection because people who use 
Retin-A are sensitive to the sun. 
</P>
<P>
Makeup specialist Judith August, who sells camouflage cosmetics by mail-order 
from her Studio City offices, says that many of the techniques used on women 
recovering from plastic surgery can be used on acne patients. For complete 
coverage, August pats on natural-tone foundation, allows it to dry and then 
sponges on a second layer. August urges clients to then use powder "because it 
cuts light reflection that calls attention to the blemishes." She also 
recommends a flesh-toned kohl pencil for touch-ups. 
</P>
<P>
When clients with acne turn to Eugenia Weston at her Senna Cosmetiques salon in 
Tarzana, Weston, before applying foundation, dabs on a liquid containing 
camphor, an ingredient present in some acne preparations, to "protect the skin 
and dry out the blemishes." She uses matte charcoal or brown eye makeup and red 
lipstick to call attention to the eyes and mouth "so the skin is not the focus 
of the face." 
</P>
<P>
Camouflage techniques are fine "as long as the cosmetics are labeled 'oil-free' 
-- not just 'water-based' because some of those have oil -- and 
'non-comedogenic,' meaning they aren't supposed to cause blemishes," explains 
Dr. Lorrie Klein, an assistant clinical professor at UC-Irvine Medical Center 
and a dermatologist in Laguna Niguel. And Dr. Letantia Bussell, a Beverly Hills 
dermatologist, cautions against using a makeup sponge more than once. 
"Organisms can go back and forth between the makeup and the face, irritating 
and prolonging the breakouts," Bussell says. "Throw away the sponges after 
every use, use cotton balls instead of powder puffs, and clean brushes daily 
with alcohol or witch hazel." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that even she breaks out, Sarnelle says: "No woman wants to admit to 
having acne. But you can't hide when you have pimples, so you've got to hide 
the pimples."

IN THE MOVIE "Wall Street," the bad-guy financier, played by Michael Douglas, 
masterminds his leveraged buyouts while seated at a Burdick Group desk. 
Actually, it's not so much a desk as a desk system -- the first of a new 
furniture breed, the executive workbench. 
</P>
<P>
About 1975, San Francisco-based designer Bruce Burdick foresaw the implications 
the desktop computer, poised to invade the executive office, would pose. For 
starters, it meant a nightmare in wire management, what with communications and 
power cables. So Burdick conceived the idea of a horizontal raceway standing a 
few feet off the floor to conceal the wires. 
</P>
<P>
The raceway also acts like the track in track lighting. It supports components 
that snap into place along its length without tools, thereby allowing the desk 
to be personalized and reconfigured instantly. Components can be endlessly 
daisy-chained. They include a desktop-like work surface, computer and printer 
stands, bookends, letter trays, and drawers and filing cabinets. Not to mention 
a credenza-like attachment with a hutch for working at a typewriter, a round 
glass top big enough for impromptu conferences, and a tool caddie analogous to 
an roll-top desk with cubbyholes for pads, pencils and Rolodex. 
</P>
<P>
The top surfaces come in glass, wood, laminate and marble. Glass is the most 
popular because users invariably enjoy looking at the Burdick's elegant 
superstructure. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical Burdick Group systems retail for $2,000 to $15,000, depending on 
configuration. At Herman Miller Office Pavilion in Irvine (714) 975-8700, and 
Herman Miller Inc. in the Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles (213) 659-7600.

STAGEWEEK: LA JOLLA'S MACBETHS: 'A GREAT TEAM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV

<TEXT>
<P>
"He can kill a man, but he has a conscience," explained actress Barbara 
Williams, opening tonight as Lady Macbeth opposite John Vickery in "Macbeth" at 
La Jolla Playhouse. "I can't kill a person, but I have no conscience. So it's a 
very symbiotic relationship." 
</P>
<P>
"We're a great team," Vickery agreed. "It takes both of us to kill Duncan; it's 
not just my murder and not just her murder. Also, one of (director) Des 
McAnuff's conceptions is that Macbeth is this presumably great soldier -- and 
the fact that they can't have a child has gnawed at him over the years. So in 
some ways the throne becomes a replacement for the child they can't have." 
</P>
<P>
Both actors think that the Macbeths have a lusty marriage -- though not a very 
healthy one. 
</P>
<P>
"When you first see the two of us," said Vickery, "I think we're going for a 
tremendous sort of sexual charge in the air. We're very happy to see each other 
in the bedroom scene, but there's another agenda: We've got to get ready for 
Duncan's arrival." Noted Williams, "We never really have a chance to express 
our passion and love because it's channeled into the plot of Duncan's murder. 
So the murder becomes the sex act -- and we beget the throne. It's awfully 
kinky." 
</P>
<P>
As for comparisons with other productions, Vickery describes this staging as "a 
little more active -- as opposed to the great Olivier/Gielgud/Richardson days, 
when they tended to be quite contemplative." Added Williams, "You can't help 
but be aware of all the great performances that have preceded you. 
</P>
<P>
". . . You can't avoid what's (in the text) and say, 'No, I'm not going to wash 
my hands.' But you can go deeper into the truth." 
</P>
<P>
ALL BOLTS ARE OFF: Another new "Frankenstein" is on the loose. Opening this 
weekend at Long Beach's International City Theatre is Jay Julian and Elaine 
Gerdine's new adaptation of the Mary Shelley novel, with a modern musical score 
by Justus Matthews. (It joins another musical adaptation, "Frankie," playing in 
New York.) 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been fascinated by the story," said Julian, who first mounted the 
piece last year at Houston's Main Street Theatre. "But I didn't think to do it 
till I realized what an attention-grabber Frankenstein is for people. There's a 
built-in interest factor." 
</P>
<P>
As a former dancer/choreographer, Julian has utilized movement -- plus a 
Greek-style chorus -- to break up the narrative. "You will recognize the 
story," he said. "But because it is based on Shelley's actual work, there are 
elements you might not have seen (in other treatments). The creature is not a 
stumbling goon with bolts in his head. He's not evil. He just cannot find 
compassion or love from another living thing -- and so he becomes frustrated, 
reverts to drastic means. One of the themes of the book is that we must take 
responsibility for our creations. We cannot just make them, then leave them." 
</P>
<P>
THEATER BUZZ: Three weeks ago, flowery lavender wedding invitations for "Tony 
n' Tina's Wedding" (the environmental theater piece opening today at the Park 
Plaza Hotel) were sent out to 700 local press people and celebrities -- and 
since then, the RSVPs have been streaming in. Trouble is, some folks thought 
the invitations for Tina Vitale's wedding were for real. According to Rick 
Miramontez Co. press rep Ken Werther, "People have been calling up and saying, 
'I want to RSVP -- but I don't think I know any Vitale.' One woman said, 'I'd 
love to come. Could you tell me where Tina is registered?' " 
</P>
<P>
Sample your favorite stage stars' favorite recipes in "Tasty Production" ($10), 
a new cookbook produced by the Friends of the Pasadena Playhouse -- and 
available at the theater's gift shop. The 300 recipes include Shrimp Palmer by 
Betsy Palmer ("Death of a Buick"), Leading Lady Tomatillo by Audra Lindley 
("Handy Dandy"), Dana's Tortilla Chip Salad by Dana Hill ("Steel Magnolias") 
and Spicy Orange Roughy by Valerie Mahaffey ("Carnal Knowledge"). 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSS FIRE: Jo Carson's seriocomic "Daytrips," an all-female story of 
a family battling Alzheimer's disease, is playing at Los Angeles Theatre 
Center. Steven Kent directs. 
</P>
<P>
Said The Times' Dan Sullivan: "Carson lets her tale proceed in a circular way. 
. . . There's always movement, but there's no stress. (It) has time for its 
people, as big-city plays don't always have. Kent understands its rhythm, and 
his actors find freedom within it." 
</P>
<P>
From Lawrence Enscoe in the Daily News: "Its breezy, lithe language and fluid 
storytelling style lulls you into a folksy rhythm. Before you know it, you're 
living in the heart and soul of the play." 
</P>
<P>
Noted the Herald Examiner's Charles Marowitz: "Since the play cobbles together 
stray memories from the lives of all its characters, it eschews the orderliness 
of conventional structure -- which in one sense is commendable -- but even a 
free-form requires form, and this Carson has not provided." 
</P>
<P>
Said the Daily Breeze's Sandra Kreiswirth: "Kent takes his time with these 
women. In 90 minutes with no intermission, he lets the audience get to know 
them -- their nuances, their frailties and their fears -- detailing Carson's 
already rich textures." 
</P>
<P>
From Ed Kaufman in the Hollywood Reporter: "Getting away from the literal and 
graphic, Carson has constructed a theater piece that cuts through literal time 
and space. Instead, she creates an onstage world that is able to segue from the 
present to the past, from dreams to ghosts."

RADIO DAYS: When KLOS-FM morning madmen Mark &amp; Brian invited Barry White, 
the man with the most awesome basso profundo in show business, to do their show 
Tuesday, we knew something wild was bound to happen -- especially since the 
radio bad boys had been playing snippets of White's hits on the show for weeks 
(White also has a new album coming out called "The Man Is Back"). But people 
have joked about White's rumbling baritone for years -- what new twist could we 
expect from the impish deejays? Easy. They got White to go along with a goofy 
chemistry experiment -- they fed him a tankful of helium. Sounding like a cross 
between Flip Wilson and Prince, White playfully recited '70s-era lyrics ("Take 
off your brassiere, my dear . . ."), saying with awe: "You guys are crazy." 
Thanks to stunts like this, Mark &amp; Brian have catapulted to the No. 2 
position in the morning ratings, leaping past Power 106's Jay Thomas and 
trailing only KIIS-FM's resurgent Rick Dees.

HOT TYPE: Every magazine is entitled to have an anniversary issue, even RIP, 
which celebrates its third anniversary this month. The new December issue of 
the sassy hard-rock bible features a Motley Crue pull-out poster, Serious Rock 
Talk with Jon Bon Jovi ("Q: What would you do if you could be invisible for a 
day? A: Hang out in a girls' shower. A girls' shower in the locker-room of a 
strip club."), features on Metallica, L.A. Guns, Warrant &amp; Tora Tora and 
gloriously frank reader mail ("Your cover story on Great White left me feeling 
nothing but disgust for the entire band . . . if the only angle they want to 
promote is how accessible they are to horny groupies, a sign in the window of 
the tour bus would suffice"). . . . And KRS-One, who's out on a 27-city tour 
with L.A.'s own Young MC, isn't just doing rap concerts this fall. Both 
performers will be giving a series of lectures at local colleges along the way, 
in part as a way of encouraging students to join the teaching profession. So 
far the duo's lecture schedule includes such lofty institutions as Princeton 
and Yale.

BLUESBUSTERS: The greatest of the blues greats was Muddy Waters, who gets his 
due Nov. 7 when MCA Records releases a boxed-set of 72 classic Waters 
performances. Besides his many hits, the collection will offer 10 previously 
unreleased tracks, most notably a 1948 gem, "Good Looking Woman," a live 
version of "Country Boy" and a 1959 outtake of "Take the Bitter With the Sweet" 
complete with raucous in-studio dialogue between Waters and legendary Chess 
producer Leonard Chess. The box also features a wealth of rare photos and 
memorabilia, including a 1975 birthday telegram from his biggest fans, the 
Rolling Stones, saying: "We are all thinking of you. If it had not been for 
you, we would never be where we are today." (Now if only the Stones could 
donate a tiny percentage of the mega-mega-bucks they're making on their U.S. 
tour to help get Mississippi's Delta Blues museum off the ground). . . . And 
this month's Truth in Advertising Award goes to Columbia Records, whose 
full-page ads touting Bob Dylan's "Oh Mercy" album include a Musician magazine 
review that is excerpted to read ". . . A masterpiece." Only one problem: Mark 
Rowland's actual review reads "It's tempting to tout a strong album like 'Oh 
Mercy' as . . . a masterpiece. It would be the easy thing to do -- but as the 
philosopher Richard Nixon once pointed out, that would be wrong."

ART NEWS: ARTISTS TURN LANDSCAPE ART INTO VIDEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUNA SNOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A museum-organized exhibition of several video installations focusing on a 
single theme opens Friday at the Newport Harbor Art Museum. In "American 
Landscape Video: The Electronic Grove," video works by six artists -- Dara 
Birnbaum, Frank Gillette, Doug Hall, Rita Myers, Steina Vasulka and Bill Viola 
-- continue the strong American tradition of landscape art, transforming 
natural outdoor imagery into electronic fusions of picture and sound. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the importance of this exhibition is that (the artists) are using a 
specific 20th Century technology to express their relationships to the 
landscape," said Marilu Knode, the museum's assistant curator. "Each (artist 
uses) a full room (for his or her video installation) and incorporates elements 
of the architecture or space (of the room). . . . They're creating an 
intellectual or social landscape." 
</P>
<P>
The six works include Birnbaum's "Will-o'-the-Wisp," which employs video 
monitors, music and large photo panels as a metaphor for the interrelationship 
between individual and social experience; Gillette's "Arkansas," which 
contemplates the individual's place in the world through its multi-channel 
composition of images recorded in the coastal region north of Corpus Christi; 
and Hall's ominous "The Terrible Uncertainty of the Thing Described," which 
represents nature as a dangerous presence in a sculpture of video, steel chairs 
and a steel mesh fence in which a lightning-like charge of electricity is set 
loose. 
</P>
<P>
The others are Myers' "Rift Rise," a meditation upon destructive force that 
incorporates video monitors, music, live trees and mixed media constructions 
into a confrontation of landscapes; Vasulka's "The West," a 22-monitor tribute 
to the American Southwest, that plays both harmony and counterpoint to the rich 
colors and forms of the New Mexican mountains, desert and architectural 
remains; and Viola's "Room for St. John of the Cross," which recreates a 16th 
Century mystic who was imprisoned by the Inquisition and whose spiritual verse 
is heard accompanying dramatic landscape images. 
</P>
<P>
"So many people expect just a video monitor (from video art), but these works 
are all encompassing, and try to express a certain mood about the environment," 
Knode said. 
</P>
<P>
ON THE BLOCKS: A complete portfolio of 21 gelatin prints from Alfred 
Steiglitz's "Equivalent" photographic series will be auctioned off Oct. 31 at 
Christie's auction house in New York. The prints will be offered along with 
other important 19th and 20th century photographs including "Boulder Dam," by 
precisionist painter-turned-photographer Charles Sheeler; Edward Westin's 
classic "Nautilus," of a single conch shell; and Margaret Bourke White's 
"George Washington Bridge" (1933) and "Chrysler Building" (1930). 
</P>
<P>
Steiglitz once described his "Equivalent" series as "a picture of the chaos in 
the world and of my relationship to that chaos." According to Claudia Gropper, 
director of Christie's photography department, the portfolio could fetch "in 
excess of $200,000." 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated series of auctions beginning Oct. 24, Sotheby's in New York is 
selling works from the collection of Roberto Polo, including French and 
Continental furniture, tapestries and works of art. The collection, which is 
being sold at the direction of the Internal Revenue Service, is expected to 
bring $6 to $8 million. 
</P>

NOTES: The Long Beach Museum of Art has received $125,000 in recent gifts. 
Long-time Long Beach resident Ellen M. Taylor left the museum a $100,000 
bequest, which will be used to establish an operating endowment for exhibitions 
and educational programs; and an anonymous Long Beach community service 
foundation has sent the museum $25,000 to initiate a new art education program. 
LBMA director Hal Nelson said he hopes the latter donation will challenge other 
community groups to match it. . . . The Museum of Contemporary Art has new free 
multilingual family guides available to its patrons. The guides are printed in 
English, Spanish, Korean, Chinese and Japanese, and are intended to provide a 
basis for discussion of contemporary art between parents and children. Included 
are a glossary of basic art terms, activities to be done after leaving the 
museum, and tips to make the museum more accessible.

'SEX' AND ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cudos to Dan O'Neill's labeling of the movie "sex, lies and videotape" as the 
pretentious mediocrity that it is (Letters, Oct. 8). 
</P>
<P>
There is a tendency for film critics to laud any so-called "art film" so long 
as it is ponderous, slow-paced and photographed to look as though it were a 
half-finished student film. 
</P>
<P>
"Sex, lies and videotape" fills all of these criteria. Also, all of the letters 
in its title are lower case. It must be art.

'SEX' AND ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
O'Neill displays shortsightedness when, in his assessment of "sex," he mistakes 
a laconic style for shallowness. He refuses to believe that this "yuppie soap 
opera" could reveal the emptiness of modern life. (A stronger argument might 
have been that the use of yuppies to depict emptiness was too easy.) 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill obviously has definite ideas about what constitutes a work of art, and 
anything that does not conform to those preconceived notions doesn't deserve 
further consideration. This is so much easier than trying to approach a work on 
its own terms. But that would require thought.

JONES' OLDIES

<TEXT>
<P>
It was interesting to come across Calendar's Oct. 8 article on Rickie Lee 
Jones. I'm a retiree and was totally unaware of her talent until I heard her on 
TV doing the old Eddie Cantor song, "Making Whoopee." 
</P>
<P>
So I went to record stores on Florida's Gulf Coast trying to find tapes of her 
doing music of the '20s and '30s. Clerks remarked that many older people were 
asking for the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Jones is missing a market if she doesn't do more of the '20s and '30s with her 
cute voice.

BROTHERLY HELP

In Patrick Goldstein's Oct. 8 article, actor Beau Bridges is quoted as saying 
that years ago he was afraid his younger brother Jeff "was a pansy," so he took 
him out to the park and taught him to throw a curve ball. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges' comment prompts the following open letter: 
</P>
<P>
Beau, my nephew wanted to go see you and Jeff in your new movie, "The Fabulous 
Baker Boys." You'll be proud of the fact that I told him: 
</P>
<P>
"No way -- you get out there and play some baseball or I'll think you're a 
pansy." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks, Beau. You've saved your brother from a fate worse than death, and now 
my nephew is saved too! 
</P>
<P>
By the way, do all of the young people in your performing-arts group have to 
prove they're straight to work with you? 
</P>
<P>
Or do you just call them "pansy" or "dyke" if they're not? 
</P>
<P>
Do you send them out to toss a few balls around if you're suspicious? 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Goldstein should not have included your remark in his story and The 
Times should not have printed it. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think they did you a favor, and it shows an editorial lack of 
sensitivity.

Claudia Puig's puff piece, "Music to Someone's Ears," details how demographics 
were molded to make a case for dumping the classic KFAC. Given the bottom-line, 
throwaway mentality at work here, it sounds more like a dismal demonstration of 
demonographics.

As if the air in Los Angeles isn't bad enough already, the Texas-based 
Evergreen Corp. is now pouring its noxious audio fumes into our cultural

Let's hope the grandiose pipe dreams of those who now own and run KKBT lead to 
their speedy demise in a medium already up to its ears in noisome offal. It 
would serve these carpetbaggers right.

As Anita Crane (wife of former announcer Fred Crane) says in her Oct. 1 letter, 
Tom Dixon, Tom Cassidy, Crane, the one and only mellifluous-voiced Carl Princi 
(she omitted the personable and witty Doug Ordunio) -- all announcers in the 
class days of KFAC -- do not have master's degrees in music. 
</P>
<P>
If Mary Fain, with her stilted gibberish and fractured pronunciation of foreign 
names, was one of the two recent announcers touted as having master's degrees 
in a Sept. 17 letter from a KFAC executive, both she and the other one should 
demand refunds from their colleges.

YOUR FINANCIAL ANALYST

<P>
WOULD YOU LIKE to make a fortune in real estate, plan for your retirement and 
set aside money for your kid's education -- except every time you talk to your 
broker, banker or tax adviser, your eyes glaze over and your brain turns to 
mush? That's why programmers wrote programs such as Your Financial Analyst. 
There's nothing fancy here -- just four useful functions: loan calculator, 
equity calculator, amortization and financial planning. The loan calculator 
does exactly what it says. You tell it how much you want to borrow, for how 
many years at what interest rate, and it tells you what your monthly payments 
will be. Or if you want to go at it the reverse way, you tell it how much of a 
monthly payment you can afford, how long a loan you want and the current 
interest rate, and it will tell you how much money you can borrow. 
</P>
<P>
The amortization tables have a certain mesmerizing appeal. Once you enter the 
data on the loan, it can tell you how much interest you've paid at any point 
and how much principle still remains to be paid. It also tells you, if you 
choose to make a slight additional payment each month on the principle (say, 
$100), how much you can knock off the total cost (an astounding amount on a 
30-year loan). 
</P>
<P>
The college planner begins by asking whether you want to send your child to a 
private or public university or college. Figuring then that the average public 
college costs $6,165 per year and the average private college costs $12,511, 
Your Financial Planner then tells you how much you have to set aside each month 
now to send your child to college at age 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Your Financial Planner is a shareware program available from California 
Freeware, telephone (805) 273-0300.

CHILD'S PLAY: AROUND HOME; 
</P>
<P>
THE AU PAIR OPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY DIEHL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
IT'S THE BIGGEST PROBLEM working parents face: finding competent child care. 
American-born nannies and care-givers are scarce; families who hire 
undocumented foreign workers to care for their children are breaking the law 
and flirting (however remotely) with prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
There is now a legal alternative. To give more foreign students a chance to 
sample American life, the United States Information Agency (USIA) issues 
special one-year J-1 visas to young women (and some men) from 13 western 
European countries to live with American families, care for children and carry 
on a modest education program. Candidates must be 18 to 25 years old, have a 
secondary school education, fluency in English and experience in child care. 
</P>
<P>
American families pay a sponsor about $3,500 for air fare, training and health 
insurance. They pay their au pair a stipend of $100 per week, give him or her a 
room, two weeks of paid vacation and subsidize up to $300 in tuition. 
</P>
<P>
An au pair is not "hired help" -- he or she is to be included as a family 
member in meals and family activities. Au pairs may work up to 45 hours per 
week. Although not responsible for heavy cleaning, they are expected to perform 
light housekeeping chores related to the children and, like a family member, 
contribute to the neatness of the common areas of the home. 
</P>
<P>
Five venerable student exchange programs have been approved as sponsors by the 
USIA and now find themselves in the nanny business. All operate under the same 
USIA ground rules, and each can bring in up to 2,840 au pairs per year. They 
screen and interview candidates, then match them with prospective host 
families. Although families do not interview candidates directly, there is an 
opportunity for correspondence and a chance for all parties to get to know one 
another before the year begins. 
</P>
<P>
All programs employ counselors to ease the adjustment and to make sure that the 
agreed-upon working arrangement is being honored by all concerned. In case of a 
non-fit between au pair and family, the au pair will be placed in another home 
and the host family will receive a replacement. However, the original match-up 
succeeds about 85% of the time, odds which are at least as good as in most new 
employer-employee relationships. 
</P>

NEW BOOKS: SWEATERS BY HAND: DESIGNS FOR SPINNERS AND KNITTERS BY HELENE RUSH

RACHAEL EMMONS IS a spinner who knits, Helene Rush knits and is learning to 
spin, and together these two Portland, Me., women have created a beautiful and 
useful book -- even for those who don't spin their own yarns. Each sweater 
design (some simple, some lush, using all kinds of yarns from silk and mohair 
to sturdy wool) comes with spinning, dyeing and knitting instructions, complete 
with suggestions for modifications. Because hand-spun yarns don't always 
conform to commercial yarn weights, the authors give commercial equivalents for 
those of us who don't spin. But here is fair warning: After absorbing this 
book, I'm seriously considering buying a spinning wheel. Of course, the sofa 
will have to go. ($17.95) Judith Sims

HOSPITALS ADD BEAUTY AS TREATMENT OPTION;

HEALTH: HAIRCUTS, MANICURES AND COLOR EVALUATIONS ARE BEING TRIED OUT TO GIVE

<TEXT>
<P>
One man enjoyed a massage while two women had their hair and nails done. Mellow 
jazz played on a tape deck while a small group gathered around the hors 
d'oeuvres table for conversation. 
</P>
<P>
The gathering that had all the trappings of an exclusive beauty salon was 
actually part of the therapy program offered to patients at the mental health 
ward at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
"How one feels about oneself has a definite effect on how you function in 
society," said Dr. Leighton Huey, medical director of the hospital's mental 
health unit. "We're using this experience to try to elevate their 
self-awareness." 
</P>
<P>
During the carefully orchestrated sessions, patients are offered haircuts, 
massages and tips on improving their dress. Some patients even have their 
"colors" selected by trained fashion experts. 
</P>
<P>
Those services might seem mundane but they do help many depressed patients 
"feel better about themselves," according to Melodie Lohr, director of the 
hospital's expressive arts program. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps has for several months offered the "beauty wellness" program to 
patients elsewhere in the hospital for a fee. Typically, the service is paid 
for by individual patients who face more time in a hospital bed -- or who want 
to spruce up before being discharged. 
</P>
<P>
But the mental health ward has gone a step further and incorporated the beauty 
program into its drug and therapy programs, Lohr said. 
</P>
<P>
Health professionals at other hospitals acknowledged that the common-sense 
approach probably pays dividends. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes sense that with depression self-image is part of the problem," 
according to Leslie Satz, a nurse practitioner with the Veterans Administration 
outpatient program here. Satz plans to initiate a similar -- but decidedly 
lower-key -- program later this year at the VA's Mission Valley clinic. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to teach depressed patients to dress better and to take better 
care of their personal appearance," Satz said. "Because, if self-image is a 
problem, one way to help . . . is to give (that person) a boost." 
</P>
<P>
The VA program will be run by beauty counselors from local J. C. Penney Co. 
stores. The chain will make the beauty experts available to VA patients to 
provide make-overs and fashion tips at no cost. They also will provide fabric 
swatches that patients can use to determine the most appropriate colors to 
wear. 
</P>
<P>
The VA program, which is aimed at female veterans who are being treated on an 
outpatient basis for mild psychiatric problems, will not be as in-depth as the 
program offered by Scripps, according to Satz. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps' "beauty wellness" program has elicited dramatic responses from some 
patients who did not respond to traditional treatments, Lohr said. For example, 
two depressed male patients, both of whom had exhibited "robot-like" behavior, 
surprised Scripps' staff by lining up for massages. 
</P>
<P>
"They had been non-responsive to traditional therapies," Lohr said. But, after 
the massages, both men "even had their colors done," Lohr said. The men 
subsequently seemed better able -- and more willing -- to socialize with other 
patients and staff members. 
</P>
<P>
Socialization is an important part of the program, Lohr said. Doctors and 
nurses typically are first in line to get facials, manicures or massages 
because depressed patients often are hesitant to join in the action, Lohr said. 
</P>
<P>
But patients soon realize that the beauticians are not a threat, and "all of a 
sudden there's this interaction going on with the other patients," Lohr said. 
Patients "learn skills that will help them when it comes time" to return to 
general society, Lohr said. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps' "beauty wellness" program is operated by Fashion on Location, a San 
Diego-based company that provides on-site beauty care for corporations, film 
companies and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Only a fraction of the firm's in-hospital work, however, is done in mental 
health wards. For the most part, it provides beauty care to patients who are 
recuperating after surgery or who are about to be released. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Gordon, the firm's founder and president, believes "beauty wellness" 
programs can speed the recovery of patients who have undergone surgery -- as 
well as those who are hospitalized for mental health treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps "has told us that the sessions really break down barriers, and the 
patients and staff begin bonding together," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
Patients being treated for depression at Scripps are not billed separately for 
services provided by Fashion on Location. Patients elsewhere in the hospital -- 
and other hospitals serviced by the company -- are, however, billed by Fashion 
on Location for haircuts, beauty treatments and the like. A simple haircut and 
a blow-dry styling would cost about $25. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Blumenthal, a psychiatrist and chief of the behavioral medicine program 
at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md., gives a qualified 
endorsement to the appearance factor in mental health treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"What is important is that this be an adjunct to therapy, that it not replace 
psychotherapy or medication," Blumenthal said in a telephone interview. 
"Learning that you look better and draw a more positive response by dressing in 
certain colors won't cure depression. But it might help them to take control or 
charge of their life a little more." 
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal said she has not heard of other programs similar to those at the VA 
and Scripps. "Things always seem to start in California," she quipped. 
</P>
<P>
Fashion on Location's employees receive special training before working in 
hospitals because "most beauticians are not set up" to work with patients, 
according to Bruce Bainbridge, a part-time critical care nurse at Chula Vista 
Community Hospital who runs the firm's hospital division. 
</P>
<P>
"There are protocols for working in that kind of an environment . . . and there 
are things you can and can't do," Bainbridge said. "Most people aren't used to 
(patients with) a tube coming out of their nose and a few tubes going into 
their arms. Many people get queasy with that sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
"People who are getting ready to go back into society don't want to go back 
looking like hell," Bainbridge said. "You want the reaction as you go out the 
front door that you're looking good."

KEY TO AIRPORT SOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The key ingredient to any ultimate solution regarding San Diego's airport 
expansion needs, be it Lindbergh Field or another site, continues to elude us. 
</P>
<P>
That necessary missing component is a commitment by all of our governmental 
representatives to get together behind a plan. 
</P>
<P>
For over 25 years, one governmental entity, the San Diego County Board of 
Supervisors or the San Diego City Council, (usually driven by the elected 
officials representing Point Loma constituents living near Lindbergh Field), 
recycles the issue and institutes a study. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the commissioners of the San Diego Unified Port District strive to 
maintain Lindbergh's safety and functionality as much as possible, never 
knowing from study to study if the airport is interim or long-term. Like 
Sisyphus and the proverbial stone, they are caught between the politics of 
other governmental entities, unhappy residents living under the flight path, 
noise-abatement lawsuits and responsibility for operating the facility. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Assn. of Governments (Sandag) studies the problem, but has no 
real political clout to negotiate a solution on a regional basis. 
</P>
<P>
What is needed is a working commitment by the City Council, the Board of 
Supervisors and the county's entire congressional and legislative delegations. 
</P>
<P>
A solution will require the agreement, resources and all the political clout 
San Diego has, both locally and nationally. For example, a master plan 
encompassing the expertise and jurisdiction of every interested agency should 
be able to find a way to utilize Lindbergh Field and give it a real chance to 
succeed as a positive solution. 
</P>
<P>
If our government officials cannot get together behind the problem and cannot 
collectively find the power to influence the Department of Defense in 
Washington (if that's what's needed) to develop short- and long-term solutions, 
then we as citizens have elected the wrong people. 
</P>
<P>
Lindbergh Field is here to stay for at least 15 to 20 years. At the very 
minimum, consideration of public safety, growing air traffic demands and 
escalating costs of a new airport site require port, city/county and associated 
planners to merge their efforts to bring Lindbergh Field up to par on a 
short-term basis. In the process, they might also give it a chance to work as 
part of the solution to San Diego's long-term air traffic and transportation 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
An intergovernmental, nonpartisan, non-territorial effort is needed -- one that 
can be measured not by lip service or by committee attendance, but by results. 
</P>
<P>
If the idea caught on, who knows what other regional problems we could solve.

THE VANISHING SAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for your article on the sand-mining operations on the San Luis Rey 
River. The attitude at the county seems to be if one sand mine is good, then 
five will be wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
What is not mentioned in the article is the destruction of the once-beautiful 
California 76. Ironically, the county considers it a No. 1 priority scenic 
route. I really doubt that anyone from the county has looked at it lately. With 
the removal of large trees, piles of large rocks right up to the highway and 
huge sand piles, it looks more like a slum. 
</P>
<P>
We at Rancho Monserate Country Club, a senior-citizen mobile home park, have 
been inundated with sand. The prevailing winds from Oceanside send it 
throughout the park. Aside from the continual work of dusting and sweeping, 
there is the health problems it creates with residents suffering from chronic 
lung disease. 
</P>
<P>
Now we are faced with even more sand mining. A new major-use permit has been 
applied for by Millie Vessels, whose land abuts this subdivision. She is asking 
for sand mining on 560 acres. In addition, Hal Jensen is asking for a major-use 
permit for a rock quarry, asphalt plant and cement factory on Rosemary's 
Mountain, and it includes continual sand mining of the San Luis Rey for 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
It does make you wonder where it will all end. We can only pray for extremely 
heavy rainfall and large floods in order to move the sand to Oceanside and stop 
this effort to ruin the river.

BERNHARDT VICTORY SIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Floyd Morrow's backing of Linda Bernhardt gives a victory sign for Linda in 
November. After a disappointing defeat, it takes a really fine person to step 
forward so soon and endorse a former opponent. Floyd has always had his heart 
in the right place, and San Diego City Councilman Ed Struiksma should realize 
that Floyd's love and concern for Linda Vista and Clairemont will bring the 
voters out. Floyd has seen Linda grow with leadership capabilities that have 
surprised everyone. His endorsement gives us hope, and, if everyone gets out 
and works for Linda, we can end the reign of big money.

JAMES C. CORMAN; 
</P>
<P>
LOBBYIST SAVORS LIFE WITH FAMILY BUT MISSES CONGRESSIONAL CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even now, nearly a decade after voters in his San Fernando Valley district 
abruptly ended his 20-year congressional career, James C. Corman still wears 
his regret on his well-tailored sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just awful to be doing something you love and you think you do reasonably 
well, and it's all gone in one election and you can't do anything about it," 
Corman recalled recently over breakfast amid the leather furnishings and cherry 
walls of the sumptuous office where he works as a Washington lobbyist. "It's 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
He would mount an autumnal comeback in a minute if he could regain the coveted 
seniority that made him a leading Democratic advocate for the poor and 
disadvantaged on the influential House Ways and Means Committee, which crafts 
national tax legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"He's probably one of the few people I know who isn't happier in private life 
than he was in public life," said Rep. Andrew Jacobs Jr. (D-Ind.), a former 
colleague and close friend of Corman's. "He's a bleeding heart; he's an 
idealist." 
</P>
<P>
But make no mistake: Corman, 68, has found there is life after Congress since 
Republican Bobbi Fiedler rode the crest of the Valley's anti-school-busing 
movement in 1980 to oust him by a mere 752 votes out of 153,770 cast. 
</P>
<P>
The past 8 1/2 years as a successful Capitol Hill lobbyist have provided the 
courtly lawyer with the income and time to do things with his youthful second 
family that a congressional schedule and salary would have vetoed. 
</P>
<P>
"You ask Jim what time it is and he'll say, 'Let me tell you about Adam and 
Brian,' " Jacobs said, referring to Corman's sons, ages 10 and 9. "I've never 
seen a more devoted father." 
</P>
<P>
Bereft of the power to shape public policy, Corman has been blessed with a new 
life of private prerogatives as his prime focus moved from the House to the 
home. But, dapper in monogrammed shirts, leather suspenders and wing-tipped 
shoes, the white-haired former resident of Van Nuys still frequents the 
Capitol's marble halls. 
</P>
<P>
Like more than 80 former House members, Corman has cashed in on his contacts 
and knowledge of the institution and its issues, particularly often arcane tax 
matters handled by the Ways and Means Committee, on which he was the 
fourth-ranking member. He has made as much as $300,000 a year, five times his 
highest salary as a lawmaker (House pay is now $89,500 a year). 
</P>
<P>
His lobbying business, Corman Law Offices, includes such clients as MCA; 
Tropicana Energy, a Texas-based ethanol manufacturer; shopping center magnate 
Guilford Glazer; the U. S. League of Savings Institutions, and the American 
Newspaper Publishers Assn. He has one partner, William Kirk, a Georgetown Law 
School graduate and ex-counsel to the Ways and Means public assistance and 
unemployment subcommittee that Corman headed. 
</P>
<P>
Their top-paying client is the National Structured Settlements Trade Assn., 
whose members negotiate with plaintiffs and defendants in personal-injury cases 
to stretch out payments through tax-free annuities or government bonds. They 
support laws permitting legal cases to be settled this way rather than 
requiring a lump-sum settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Corman maintains that it is good public policy because victims are prevented 
from dissipating huge one-shot payments and then turning to the government for 
public assistance. But periodically he must beat back efforts by the Department 
of the Treasury, which is displeased about the loss of tax revenue from 
lump-sum payments, to change the law. 
</P>
<P>
Corman and Kirk recently agreed to merge Jan. 1 with Silverstein &amp; Mullens, 
a prominent Washington tax law firm. This will give the two partners additional 
support services and potentially higher income. Otherwise, Corman said, "it 
will not change the nature of what I do." 
</P>
<P>
Just as he was respected for his integrity, intelligence and diligence as a 
legislator, Corman is widely regarded as a savvy, well-prepared and unfailingly 
gracious lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he's done anything to call that earlier reputation into 
question," said Norman Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute 
in Washington. "I have never heard anyone say, 'Look what this hypocrite's 
doing' or that he's sold his soul for something or traded his access for 
something that someone thought was appalling." 
</P>
<P>
Such actions by others have prompted controversy on Capitol Hill over the 
so-called alumni lobby. House ethics rules impose virtually no restrictions on 
lobbying by former members (the Senate prohibits its ex-members from lobbying 
senators and aides for one year). Executive branch employees face much tougher 
revolving-door restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-members have access that other lobbyists do not enjoy. They can roam the 
House floor, although they are forbidden from lobbying there, and can work out 
in the House gym. 
</P>
<P>
"I never go on the House floor," Corman said, to avoid creating the appearance 
that he might be violating the rule even if he were there for other reasons. As 
for the gym, which he uses frequently, Corman said he often learns useful 
things there, but he maintains that the information is also available in many 
other places. 
</P>
<P>
Other former members have drawn criticism by lobbying for interests they had 
opposed while in office. Corman has generally avoided that reputation, although 
he raised some eyebrows when he represented Texas Air Corp. President Frank C. 
Lorenzo in his hotly contested takeover of Continental Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Corman points out that some of his paying clients are fighting for socially 
responsible, if financially self-serving, goals. And many of his corporate 
patrons are merely battling other private interests without a public interest 
at stake. He's also done pro bono work for individuals who he feels have gotten 
a raw deal from the system. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Corman has turned down or dropped clients when he was uneasy with 
their approach, possible conflicts of interest or their expectations about what 
he could do for them, said Ken Bowler, vice president of Pfizer and a former 
Corman associate. An example was the National Committee to Preserve Social 
Security and Medicare, which Corman stopped representing amid criticism of its 
high-pressure fund-raising methods and alarmist pronouncements. 
</P>
<P>
Corman's success as an advocate starts with the expertise he acquired in the 
House on tax, health and welfare issues. It also includes long hours -- he's 
often in the office by 6:30 a.m. -- and the thoroughness and persuasive skills 
honed during two decades in Congress. Then there is his knowledge of Ways and 
Means Committee members, staff and process. 
</P>
<P>
"You know the idiosyncrasies of various members," said Fiedler, who left 
Congress in 1987 after an unsuccessful U. S. Senate bid and returned to 
Northridge, where she does consulting and lobbying. "You know how to push their 
hot buttons by couching an issue in a way that they would be sympathetic." 
</P>
<P>
Corman's relationship with Bowler illustrates one advantage of his previous 
position. Bowler, who was staff director of Corman's public assistance 
subcommittee, joined him when he started his own lobbying firm. Later, he 
returned to the Ways and Means Committee as deputy director and, eventually, 
director, where he was a valuable contact for Corman. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim combines the personal contacts that he had as a congressman, as a 
well-known political figure in California, with the work habits of a new guy on 
the block: the extra effort, the tremendous consideration to people in an 
office, the kinds of things that make everyone have a very warm feeling toward 
him," said Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), who campaigned door-to-door 
for Corman as a UCLA law student and now represents much of Corman's former 
district. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not caught up in his status as a distinguished 20-year veteran of 
Congress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Less than a year after Fiedler had waged a tough, often personal 
campaign to oust him, Corman visited her on behalf of MCA. 
</P>
<P>
"It was obviously very difficult for him," Fiedler recalled. "He was sweating 
very profusely and was extremely tense. I understood that and did everything I 
could to make it as comfortable for him as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Corman, who refuses to say anything negative about Fiedler, had a trace of 
bitterness in his voice when he recalled the aftermath of their meeting. "She 
called my client," he said, "and told them that was a stupid thing for them to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Corman also participates in the campaign contribution game, considered by many 
a prerequisite of gaining access. He and 10 to 15 colleagues hold 10 breakfasts 
a year with various members of Congress. Each lobbyist contributes $500 to the 
visiting lawmaker's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nobody I would invite in here or any of the guests would invite that 
we couldn't get an appointment with," Corman said, downplaying the significance 
of the contributions. "People we invite are people we want to see get 
reelected." 
</P>
<P>
Corman said he also makes personal contributions, but strictly to liberal 
Democrats, and he remains committed to that political agenda. As a member of 
the House Judiciary Committee, Corman helped pass landmark civil rights 
legislation in the mid-1960s. He served on the National Advisory Commission on 
Civil Disorders, known as the Kerner Commission, after the urban riots of the 
late '60s. 
</P>
<P>
It was the volatile race issue that proved his undoing in 1980, when Fiedler 
mobilized increasingly conservative Valley voters behind the effort to end 
court-ordered busing to integrate the Los Angeles school system. Corman backed 
busing as a temporary, last-resort measure. 
</P>
<P>
"Dear friends told him he should trim his sails," Jacobs said. "He thought it 
would be habit-forming." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs is among those allies who angrily say that then-President Jimmy Carter 
sealed Corman's doom when he conceded defeat to Ronald Reagan before the polls 
had closed in California, causing some disheartened West Coast Democrats to 
simply stay home. Corman refuses to blame Carter. 
</P>
<P>
"I stood and yelled at the television, 'No, you can't do this!' " recalled 
Nancy Malone, Corman's wife. "I knew that early concession meant a lot of 
people wouldn't vote." 
</P>
<P>
What made the defeat particularly painful was that, in the calculus of 
congressional power, Corman had really arrived only a few years before he was 
ousted. Only four years earlier, he had gained a much-desired spot on a 
conference committee that make critical decisions reconciling the differences 
in House and Senate versions of major bills. 
</P>
<P>
For Corman, this calculus also ruled out a comeback in 1982 when redistricting 
created a new Valley district that included most of Corman's former East Valley 
constituents and moved Fiedler into solidly Republican territory. A return 
would have left Corman at the bottom of the seniority ladder. 
</P>
<P>
So, this son of a Kansas miner, who had known poverty as a Depression-era youth 
and worked his way through UCLA and the USC School of Law, turned his energies 
to making money and enjoying a new family. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went to Congress, I was driving a 5-year-old car, I owed $25,000 on my 
house and my kids were 7 and 12," Corman said. "When I left Congress 20 years 
later, I owed $50,000 on my house, I was driving a 14-year-old car, my kid was 
1 and my wife was pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Corman drives a 1986 Cadillac Cimarron, and home is a majestic French 
Colonial on three grandly wooded acres in affluent suburban McLean in northern 
Virginia. Life is filled with the hurly-burly of his boys' hockey and football 
practices, back-yard camping and family hikes, and museum outings. 
</P>
<P>
Malone, an attractive, vivacious accountant who in 1978 became Corman's fourth 
wife, is 24 years his junior. She was married once previously. 
</P>
<P>
Corman also has two children, Mary Anne, 41, and James C. (Chuck) Jr., 36, from 
his first marriage to Virginia Little, who died of cancer in 1966. His second 
and third marriages ended in divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Corman delights in round two of fatherhood. He drives the early-morning car 
pool. He and Adam are surveying the world's scariest roller coasters (so far, 
Knott's Berry Farm is No. 1). The family throws a renowned annual Christmas 
party for 250 to 300 friends and acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's been a tremendous compensation for the loss of his job," Bowler 
said of Corman's second family. 
</P>
<P>
"Life is very complex, and he can say very honestly that he thoroughly enjoys 
having the time and the money to do the things with Nancy and the children that 
his current job allows him to do. And he can still say, 'I want my job back on 
the Ways and Means Committee.' "

LANDMARK: A BLACK CADILLAC IS THE END OF THE LINE FOR A 1950S CARWASH THAT MADE 
NEWS AFTER BEING NOMINATED FOR CULTURAL LANDMARK STATUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The last car passed through the "Gateway to Studio City" on Saturday -- not 
with a bang but with a whoosh. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling through the 1950s-style carwash, the black Cadillac Seville was cleaned 
with rushing water and soap, then was rinsed off. 
</P>
<P>
Then Pat Galati -- who has operated the carwash and adjoining gas station for 
35 years -- watched workers dry off the last beads of water. "That's that," he 
said quietly. 
</P>
<P>
It was 5:30 p.m. and the carwash, which has been the focus of a bitter conflict 
between San Fernando Valley residents and a developer, was shut down. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Ira Smedra announced in May that he had purchased the corner at 
Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards and would demolish the carwash and 
adjoining gas station and Tiny Naylor's coffee shop to make way for a 
$15-million, 53,000-square-foot mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
That brought opposition from a Studio City citizens group that wanted the 
carwash preserved. The conflict attracted worldwide attention when the group 
lobbied Los Angeles city officials to designate the carwash complex a cultural 
monument. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, Smedra won. The citizens group, which calls itself Save Our 
Corner, lost its bid for cultural monument status. And at the close of business 
Saturday, Galati threw in the towel -- as well as the rags that had been used 
to clean the cars. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, it's emotional," Galati said. "There have been customers and friends 
coming in all week, saying goodby. This isn't about a carwash. It's about a 
community. It's about what makes a neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Walter McIntyre, owner of the Seville and one of the principal organizers of a 
grass-roots effort to save the carwash, said: "It's sad. The lights are going 
out. An era is coming to an end." 
</P>
<P>
The residents have said all along that the carwash, topped by a 55-foot tower 
shaped like three boomerangs, and the coffee shop are prime examples of 1950s 
architecture. Calling the corner the "Gateway to Studio City," they said that 
saving the buildings would have been a tribute to the Valley's car culture. 
</P>
<P>
Smedra countered that the proponents did not reflect the views of the majority 
of Studio City residents, who want the carwash torn down. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission in July refused to designate the 
buildings as monuments, clearing the way for Smedra to tear down the buildings 
and construct his shopping center.

Customers coming in for a last wash Saturday said they regarded Galati as a 
friend and the carwash as a meeting hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat Galati added something to this area that we need and won't get from some 
blasted shopping center," said Bob Costello, 58, a film editor at ABC Studios, 
who has frequented the wash for 35 years. "This wasn't a carwash, it was a 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
Toni Kimball, 70, who said she was one of the first customers of the carwash 
when it opened 35 years ago, was saddened by the closure. 
</P>
<P>
"This carwash and the coffee shop was our town hall, our meeting place," she 
said. "We need this here. We don't need a shopping center." 
</P>
<P>
All through the day, customers came up to Galati and wished him well. They 
shook his hand, hugged him, kissed him. Some cried. Studio City community 
leaders staged a cake-and-champagne reception for him. 
</P>
<P>
In other ways, it was business as usual. The 22-man crew washed 600 cars -- a 
large number for a cloudy day, Galati said. Manager Lenny Bauer, 54, who had 
worked in various jobs at the carwash for 32 years, watched the cars as they 
passed through. 
</P>
<P>
"The day comes for the end of everything," he said. "People deserve what they 
want, and they want the carwash here." 
</P>
<P>
Some regular customers were not aware of the closure. "This is upsetting," said 
Robert England, 26. "They were very thorough here. I guess it's back to the 
hose and bucket for me." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council gave some hope to the mall's opponents in August 
when it ordered Smedra to draft a detailed environmental impact report, which 
could delay the mini-mall project for a year. Smedra filed suit against the 
city Friday, calling the order illegal and unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood leaders are still hoping that Councilman Joel Wachs will try to 
bring the carwash complex back to life. Wachs is considering a proposal to take 
over the property and turn part of it into a city-owned parking lot. The 
existing buildings would remain under the plan. 
</P>
<P>
But for the time being, Galati said, he is saying goodby. 
</P>
<P>
"I would love to come back here, renovate the place, do it right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I want to take it easy for a little while," he said, his voice trailing 
off.

HYPERION PROPOSAL AWAKENS RESIDENTS' FURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marilyn Rothenberg says she and her El Segundo neighbors always tried to be 
nice guys when it came to dealing with the city of Los Angeles, which runs the 
Hyperion Treatment Plant near their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Not anymore, she says. Now they're fighting mad. 
</P>
<P>
"What they say and what they do are entirely different," said Rothenberg, who 
has lived near the facility for nearly 11 years. " . . . We have been very 
patient, we have been giving, but no more, because we have been absolutely 
fooled." 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, the residents' frustrations erupted when Hyperion officials 
raised 50 large weather balloons to demonstrate how homeowner views might be 
affected by a proposal to build a row of 105-foot-high tanks at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
The tanks, known as digesters and used to treat sewage, are part of the massive 
expansion project under way at the plant. El Segundo residents quickly learned 
that the tanks would block ocean views and breezes and, presumably, drive down 
property values. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess when the ballons went up (last month) it really kind of hit home on 
what kind of expansion was going to take place," said John VanHook, another 
resident who lives near the plant. 
</P>
<P>
The second shot in that battle was fired Saturday. At the urging of some 
residents who said the one-day demonstration should be repeated, Hyperion 
staged another balloon demonstration -- and the homeowners used the event to 
stage a rally. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 residents gathered at Hillcrest and Maple avenues Saturday 
morning, many wearing T-shirts that read "No Egg Segundo" -- referring to the 
egglike shape of the proposed digesters. 
</P>
<P>
Residents toured homes to see how views and breezes would be blocked, listened 
to politicians' speeches -- which were repeatedly interrupted as airplanes 
passed overhead -- and questioned a Hyperion official. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Naydo, Hyperion division engineer, explained to the crowd that white 
balloons marked the proposed sites for the digesters. Red balloons indicated a 
planned warehouse and service facility, blue balloons represented a proposed 
50-foot multiple-level parking structure, and yellow balloons represented two 
"headworks" buildings, one that would be about 74 feet high and would house two 
silos, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As Naydo spoke, residents waved signs that read "Hyperion Does Not Tell the 
Truth" and "Los Angeles, Stop Dumping on Us." After several residents began 
questioning Naydo at once about the height of the proposed buildings, Mayor 
Carl Jacobson took the microphone and admonished the crowd to remain orderly. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Curtis Tucker Jr. advised residents to write to Rep. Mel Levine 
(D-Santa Monica) and said he would speak to the congressman as well. "We don't 
mind the Hyperion expansion," Tucker said. "We just don't want it here." 
</P>
<P>
VanHook said the protest would let Hyperion officials know that the issue has 
galvanized the community. "We need to let the Hyperion people know we're dead 
serious," he told residents. "We're playing hardball." 
</P>
<P>
City representatives at the rally collected residents' written comments, which 
Jacobson said would be forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Several dozen residents then marched down Hillcrest Avenue to the Hyperion 
plant at the corner of Imperial Highway and Vista del Mar, many donning white 
breathing masks over their noses and mouths and chanting, "Save our 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
For years, El Segundo residents have occasionally, in small groups, confronted 
Hyperion officials over the noise and foul odors that sometimes emanate from 
the plant. Last year, Hyperion officials rented an office in downtown El 
Segundo and hired an ombudsman to assist them in handling complaints about the 
expansion work. 
</P>
<P>
VanHook, who is spokesman for Save El Segundo's Environment -- the citizens 
group that sprang up in the wake of the initial balloon show -- says the group 
has asked the City Council to file legal action against Los Angeles if the 
proposal to build the tanks is not abandoned. At least one council member, Scot 
Dannen, predicted Wednesday that the council will go along with the group's 
request. 
</P>
<P>
And the residents group has begun pressing to have Hyperion shift its expansion 
plans to 300 acres owned by the city of Los Angeles just north of Imperial 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Hyperion officials say that would delay their court-ordered upgrading of the 
plant and possibly harm the El Segundo blue butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
Hyperion officials say no final decision has been reached on whether to build 
the tanks, which would be about 85 feet in diameter. Plant officials have 
planned a fact-finding mission to Europe in November to seek alternatives to 
the high tanks, according to Naydo. 
</P>
<P>
The officials will then submit their findings to the Environmental Protection 
Agency, which is preparing the environmental impact report for the plant's 
expansion. Besides blocking views and ocean breezes, construction of the tanks 
could damage nearby homes, the residents fear. They point to the 21 El Segundo 
homeowners who have already filed claims against Hyperion, contending that 
their dwellings were damaged last year by constant vibrations caused by 
Hyperion construction crews operating bulldozers. The city of Los Angeles has 
settled seven of the claims. 
</P>
<P>
The same residents assert that added noise and air pollution problems will be 
created by the plant expansion. Despite past pledges by plant officials to work 
to decrease the foul smells that sometimes come from the plant, the problem 
persists, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"We call it a burnt pizza smell," said Patti Paynter, who moved into a home 
near the plant nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Save El Segundo's Environment argues it would be better for the city if 
Hyperion expands on the 300 acres at the end of Los Angeles International 
Airport's runways. The vacant land is controlled by the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we are, a little bitty town," El Segundo City Councilman Alan West said. 
"We have one square mile of residential use and we have huge Los Angeles, which 
has (300) acres of nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Naydo said expanding the plant on the vacant land north of Imperial poses 
several problems. For one, the property is a known habitat of the endangered El 
Segundo blue butterfly. As such, environmentalists, as well as the state 
Coastal Commission, have opposed an airport plan to develop the land as a golf 
course. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Naydo said that if Hyperion were to switch gears and seriously pursue 
using the land, it would fail to meet the 1998 deadline imposed by the federal 
government to turn Hyperion into a full secondary treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
Hyperion and other Los Angeles officials said they empathize with El Segundo 
residents who live near the plant. "I am sure living next to a sewage treatment 
plant is not your ideal situation," said Edward Avila, president of the city's 
Board of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Avila and the others said they have tried to be sensitive to the 
residents' concerns, and to mitigate as much as possible any negative impacts 
that might be caused by plant operations. 
</P>
<P>
Hyperion's Naydo said equipment has been installed and other steps have been 
taken to minimize the foul odors coming from the plant. Plans have been readied 
to correct problems at a sludge treatment facility responsible for a recent 
rash of bad odors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Dannen said El Segundo can create its own habitat for the butterfly 
on the dunes near the plant. He said he is unwilling to put up with any 
construction at Hyperion that would affect views. 
</P>
<P>
"The city of Los Angeles has felt it could do as it well pleased at the expense 
of the people who live here," Dannen said. " . . . The treatment of El Segundo 
has been shabby on a good day."

LAWNDALE TO EXPLORE REPLACING APARTMENTS WITH CONDOMINIUMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lawndale Planning Commission next month will consider a proposed set of 
standards designed to encourage the building of condominiums to replace the 
city's aging apartment stock. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Larry Rudolph, who last week submitted the proposal covering 
all multifamily residential zones, said the standards are intended to reduce 
the number of older, oversized apartments in the city and increase the number 
of new condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to bring Lawndale from the '50s to the '90s," he said. 
</P>
<P>
City Planner Kendra Morries said Friday that she has not read the 15-page plan 
but has scheduled a public hearing on the proposal before the Planning 
Commission on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph said the proposal would eliminate the required minimum lot size of 
10,000 square feet for condominiums and give builders the option of putting 
condominiums on lots where the only alternative had been apartments or 
single-family dwellings, Rudolph said. 
</P>
<P>
There is no minimum lot size for apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph said builders and landowners in the city would prefer to build 
condominiums rather than apartments. 
</P>
<P>
The plan drew some fire from two frequent Rudolph foes on the council. Mayor 
Sarann Kruse said Rudolph should have told colleagues before submitting the 
plan, and Councilwoman Carol Norman said the standards would make affordable 
housing less available and transform Lawndale into "Redondo Beach East." 
</P>
<P>
When the plan comes before the Planning Commission, that body will have the 
option of rejecting the proposal, rewriting it or accepting it as proposed, 
said Chairwoman Pam Sturgeon. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph said one of the benefits of the plan is that it would promote more open 
space and increase off-street parking, because city code requires condominiums 
to have more parking, open space and amenities than apartments have. 
</P>
<P>
Apartments in the R2 (two-family) residential zones have no open space 
requirements. Apartments in the R3 (medium-density) and R4 (high-density) zones 
require 120 square feet of open space for each unit, city officials said. Open 
space includes balconies, patios, courtyards and pools. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, condominiums in any zone are required to have 200 square feet of 
open space for each unit. 
</P>
<P>
Apartments in any zone are required to have two parking spaces for each unit 
and one guest space for every five units. Condominiums must also provide two 
parking spaces for each unit but are required to have two guest spaces for 
every five units. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed standards would also permit two separately owned condominiums to 
be built on one lot in R2 zones, which encompass 504 acres or 40% of the city's 
land. 
</P>
<P>
Kruse, who had not finished reading the proposal late Friday, criticized 
Rudolph for "ramrodding it through." 
</P>
<P>
She said she supports more parking and open space in the residential zones but 
would have preferred that Rudolph had consulted with the rest of the council 
before submitting the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"He should have done it just out of courtesy," she said, adding that the 
proposed changes "may be the best thing for the city, but I don't know. I have 
to read it." 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph, who said he worked on the proposal with former Planning Commission 
Chairman Gary McDonald and Commissioner Bruce McKee, said he did not feel 
obligated to notify each council member. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said he is sorry the mayor did not have a chance to study the 
proposal before a local newspaper reported about it. 
</P>
<P>
Norman blasted the proposal, saying it requires more study before going to the 
Planning Commission and suggested that, because of its potential for changing 
the face of the city, it ought to be put to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, who had also read just part of the proposal, said she believes that it 
would drive reasonably priced housing out of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph defended the proposed standards, saying they are intended to spur 
renewal of the city's dilapidated apartments. Rudolph said he has worked on the 
proposal for eight months and hopes to see the standards in place by January. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't just pull this thing out of the sky," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Dan McKenzie said he supports the proposal because it will encourage 
more residents to buy homes rather than rent. He said homeowners stay in the 
city longer than renters and provide more stability for the community. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only way to go," he said.

ENTOMOLOGISTS HOPE ATTENTION WILL PLANT BUG IN DECISION MAKERS' EARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As a caricature, the entomologist is often portrayed as a wispy, bespectacled 
man wearing tropical shorts and pith helmet chasing exotic butterflies with a 
long-handled net. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, some of them do things like that. But many others perform painstaking 
work that non-entomologists would see as sheer drudgery -- the meticulous slow 
work of scientists. 
</P>
<P>
"They save us a lot of grief," says Henry Becker III, an information specialist 
in the Agriculture Department's main science agency, the Agricultural Research 
Service. "They certainly make life easier for us by studying these insects, the 
good ones as well as the bad ones." 
</P>
<P>
Becker, in a recent telephone interview from his Beltsville, Md., office, is 
one of those attending a two-day conference in Washington on Tuesday and 
Wednesday that will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Entomological 
Society of America. 
</P>
<P>
Entomologists are intense about their experiments, he said. For example, when 
they observe a parasite lay eggs in a destructive beetle, for example, "it's 
like they're watching their kids do a virtuoso concert . . . they really get 
excited." 
</P>
<P>
But some entomological research "is so plodding, such as categorizing and 
cataloguing insects," Becker said. "But, yet, they're very, very interested in 
what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Today's society dates from the founding in 1889 of the American Assn. of 
Economic Entomologists, and the 1906 beginning of the Entomological Society of 
America. The two were merged, adopting the latter's name, in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
The society, a nonprofit educational group, says it is the largest 
international association of entomologists, with more than 8,700 members. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, who claims his only experience with entomology is "swatting flies and 
spraying cockroaches," said the society hopes for an attendance of around 350 
at its centennial symposium this week. Some members from Britain, Canada and 
Australia are expected to attend the sessions held at the Smithsonian 
Institution. 
</P>
<P>
Julius J. Menn, associate deputy area director for the Plant Sciences Institute 
at USDA's research center in Beltsville, said the symposium is unique in that 
it is directed at an intended audience of "decision makers who are not familiar 
with entomology." 
</P>
<P>
Menn said the sessions will be geared to legislators, federal and state 
officials, industrial representatives, news media and other non-entomological 
persons. 
</P>
<P>
Allen L. Steinhauer, head of the University of Maryland's Department of 
Entomology, College Park, said more than 15 authorities "on all aspects of 
insect-related research worldwide" are on the program. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the program highlights provided by the society, which calls itself 
ESA, illustrate what Steinhauer meant: 
</P>
<P>
In the first session, Carroll M. Williams of Harvard University will talk about 
"unraveling the secrets of insect life." Williams is a pioneer researcher of 
insect development biology. 
</P>
<P>
"He developed several novel techniques for performing surgery on insects," the 
society said. "One, which uses carbon dioxide anesthesia, was adopted the world 
over." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Eisner, Cornell University, is the world's leading authority on insect 
defenses and communication. His topic is the insect as a chemist, describing 
the ingenious ways insects use odors, poisons, plants and disguises to repel or 
injure a predator. 
</P>
<P>
"Societies: Insect and Human" is the topic of Edward O. Wilson, Harvard 
University, who is called the father of modern sociobiology and is an expert on 
ants. He says biological laws are the basis of social behavior among ants and 
humans. Wilson won a Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction in 1979 for "On 
Human Nature," about the influence of genetically determined patterns of human 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Other sessions will include talks on entomology in the developing world, 
insects in agriculture, the impacts of insects on public health, applying 
biotechnology to entomology, and policies for the future. 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, Donald L. Mclean of the University of Vermont will describe 
entomology in the 21st Century. He is an expert on the relationship between 
several insects and the diseases they cause on many important crops.

WOMAN, 31, COAXED FROM FREEWAY OVERPASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police officers and firefighters coaxed a 31-year-old North Hollywood woman 
from the edge of an overpass about 60 feet above the Hollywood Freeway in North 
Hollywood on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second such incident in the San Fernando Valley in two days. 
</P>
<P>
The woman inched along the edge of the Whitsett Avenue overpass to its west 
side while police held on to her clothes through a fence. 
</P>
<P>
"She was not irrational and not combative," said Los Angeles Fire Capt. Frank 
David. Police took the uninjured woman to Olive View Medical Center for 
psychiatric evaluation, said Los Angeles Police Sgt. Christopher Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters and California Highway Patrol officers blocked traffic on the 
freeway until the woman was safely off the bridge about 6:20 p.m. Officers and 
firefighters had reached the scene about 10 minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a Burbank police detective saved a 17-year-old Burbank girl by 
grabbing her arm as she stepped off an overpass above the Ventura Freeway about 
5 miles from the site of Saturday's incident.

INGLEWOOD EXTENDS BUILDING MORATORIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Inglewood City Council on Friday night extended for 10 1/2 months its 
moratorium on high-density apartment and condominium development after hearing 
pleas from residents to limit the city's growth. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium, which passed unanimously, bans development in areas zoned for 
R-3, R-4 and P-1 multifamily housing, or about 20% of the land in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the city tightened development standards for multifamily units 
through stricter height, setback and density requirements. But residents 
complained that those measures have failed to prevent developers from buying up 
single-family homes and replacing them with apartments and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard the people loud and clear," said Councilman Jose Fernandez. "There is 
a correlation between high density and crime, traffic and overcrowded schools."

NEW VACCINES FOR CHILDHOOD ILLS PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A vaccine that would be the nation's first for chicken pox has been submitted 
for federal approval, and a new whooping cough vaccine with less risk of side 
effects may follow soon. 
</P>
<P>
Chicken pox strikes more than 3 million Americans a year, mostly children. 
While it is generally just bothersome, a small fraction of patients suffer harm 
to the central nervous system or other complications such as pneumonia or 
bacterial infections. About 175 Americans a year die from such problems. 
</P>
<P>
Some calculations suggest that given the medical costs of complications, a 
chicken pox vaccine can make economic sense for society as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Merck Sharpe &amp; Dohme of West Point, Pa., in August asked the Food and Drug 
Administration to approve its vaccine, which Stanley Plotkin, chairman of the 
American Academy of Pediatrics said is already used in Japan and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
One question is whether a childhood inoculation will lose its effectiveness in 
adulthood, a particular concern because chicken pox is generally more serious 
when it strikes adults. 
</P>
<P>
"We would all like more data" on the duration of immunity, Plotkin said. 
Studies have shown no problem up to 10 years after inoculation, and vaccinated 
people who do get chicken pox later appear to get milder cases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The vaccine contains a weakened version of the chicken pox virus, which in its 
natural form causes a lifelong nerve infection that can erupt into herpes 
zoster, commonly called shingles. Studies suggest that vaccinated people run a 
lower risk of later shingles than do people who had chicken pox, Plotkin said. 
</P>
<P>
The standard vaccine for whooping cough, called pertussis, is given in early 
childhood as part of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, or DTP, vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
About half of children who get the DTP vaccine run a fever, with swelling or 
soreness at the injection site in 40% to 50%, chiefly caused by the pertussis 
portion of the vaccine, according to one large study. 
</P>
<P>
The fever can cause convulsions, usually not a serious problem but still 
upsetting for parents. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, recent research found that fever appeared in only about 5% of 
children vaccinated with a new "acellular" pertussis vaccine, and localized 
reactions were minimal, said James Cherry of the UCLA School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Lederle Laboratories of Wayne, N.J., may be ready by early next year to ask the 
FDA to approve the new vaccine, a spokesman said. The immunization, which 
eventually would become part of the DTP, is already used in Japan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The infectious disease committee of the pediatrics academy recently urged the 
FDA to approve the vaccine, but only for the booster shots given after age 1, 
Plotkin said. Experts disagree on whether it works as well as the standard 
version when administered before that age, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The DTP vaccine is recommended at 2 months, 4 months and 6 months, with 
boosters at either 15 months or 18 months, and again before entering school at 
ages 4 to 6 years. 
</P>
<P>
The current DTP vaccine has been dogged by concerns that its whooping cough 
component can cause brain damage, including mental retardation and movement 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
That is "a highly controversial area," Plotkin said. "My opinion is that there 
is no solid evidence that it causes brain damage." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the Lederle spokesman said, it is too soon to tell whether the new 
vaccine will affect rates of brain damage alleged to result from the current 
vaccine.

<P>
As we enter a new era of world economic competition, America's national 
security must be viewed not only by our defense capabilities, but also in terms 
of our economic prowess. The stark reality we face is that strength is measured 
in megabytes as well as megatons. And American strength seems to be diminished. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Times Mirror poll indicated that a huge proportion of the American 
people "see Japan, not the U.S., as the world's leading economic power. . . . 
People see our ability to compete in the world as declining during the Reagan 
years." Indeed, Japan apparently has surpassed us in overall wealth. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in three decades, we have begun to run a deficit in trade in 
services. Our current account deficit continues to build. Our debt to foreign 
nations grows at the rate of half a billion dollars a day. 
</P>
<P>
These problems are alarming not only as a signal of reduced American economic 
strength, but also for the threat that they pose to economic opportunity for 
all nations. At a time when the Polish people are crying out for help to foster 
democracy and economic freedom, we find that we simply don't have all the 
resources to lend a helping hand. 
</P>
<P>
To date, much of the effort to regain our competitiveness has focused on ways 
to reduce foreign barriers to our exports. These proposals form a vital part of 
our trade agenda. They assure workers, farmers and businesses that if they take 
the tough steps needed to restore America's economic vitality, our government 
will act to open foreign markets to their products. 
</P>
<P>
But even if these and other tools at the disposal of the Administration are 
used aggressively, we know that they are only part of the story. As foreign 
barriers are removed and a "level playing field" is created, American 
businesses must be prepared to take full advantage of the opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
This month we joined Senator John Glenn (D-Ohio) and U.S. Rep. Sander M. Levin 
(D-Mich.) in announcing a bill to change U.S. trade and economic policy -- not 
the final step, but an important one in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
Our bill would place our top economic Cabinet officers on the National Security 
Council, ensuring that economic security has an equal voice when diplomats and 
generals discuss national security with the President. 
</P>
<P>
This change is vital to our future economic prosperity. Earlier this year, 
Congress and the Administration went head to head over the FSX fighter aircraft 
deal. It was only after the secretary of Commerce was invited into the 
discussions at the White House that our economic security concerns were raised. 
Although the changes in the deal proposed by the President don't go far enough, 
without the secretary at the table, we might have seen a greater giveaway of 
American technology and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
We need the secretaries of Commerce and Treasury as well as the U.S. trade 
representative involved in all discussions concerning our national security. 
Our strategic and economic interests are inextricably intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
Our bill would restructure trade-related federal agencies and would reform the 
Commerce Department into a new, streamlined Department of Industry and 
Technology, beefing up the Foreign Commercial Service and creating an export 
strike force. 
</P>
<P>
In trade promotion, America is losing ground. In the Osaka/Kansai region in 
Japan -- an area with a gross national product twice that of South Korea's -- 
the French have eight commercial officers. We have only two. Canada has 112 
commercial officers in the U.S. In Canada, we have 15. It's a tribute to those 
hard-working Foreign Commercial Service officers that we're doing as well as we 
are. 
</P>
<P>
Also, we are creating an Advanced Civilian Technology Agency -- a new way to 
promote the public-private partnership that we need to compete on the cutting 
edge of technologies such as biogenetics, fusion and advanced robotics. We need 
to get more technologies into the world marketplace to compete against those of 
other countries. We need to change our priorities to put more of our research 
dollars into technologies that will result in commercial benefits, rather than 
simply another weapons system. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, we spent 47% of our federal research dollars on defense. Today, that 
percentage is 68%. Our bill would change our priorities and enhance our ability 
to get new technology from the lab to the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
We also need to boost our savings rate, expand investment in research and 
development, improve education, return a long-term perspective and a sense of 
responsibility to corporate America, and much more. And we need to do all of 
these things now. That's not simple -- but it's not impossible either. It is 
necessary to make America strong enough to meet the challenges and 
responsibilities of world leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Our parents were able to defeat the Depression at home and dictatorships abroad 
at the same time, even though the America of the 1930s and 1940s was less 
strong and dominant than the America of today. While the fight is less dramatic 
now, the stakes are as high. We must rise to meet the demands of a changing 
world to give future generations the jobs, hope and opportunity they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
We hope that Congress, as well as the President, also sees the nature of the 
challenges that we face, and joins us as we rise to meet them. For a great 
nation that is not the agent of change is sure to be its victim.

WE SHOULD TAKE SECOND LOOK AT CREDIT CARD RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a major opponent of legislation to remove California's 25-year-old ceiling 
on retail credit card rates, I read with interest and concern your recent 
article, "Rate Deregulation Has Cost Consumers $100 Million" (Sept. 15). 
</P>
<P>
In 1959, the Unruh Act was enacted in response to a number of consumer abuses, 
including excessive interest rates, which were routinely between 39% and 81% at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, at the urging of the retailers, the legislature last year passed 
and the Governor signed a bill that repealed portions of the Unruh Act, 
deregulated retail credit cards and removed the interest rate cap on these 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
I strongly opposed this bill because experiences in other states have shown 
that deregulation results in increases in interest rates on retail credit 
cards, without any resulting benefits to consumers in terms of greater credit 
availability. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the issuance of new credit declined by two-thirds in New Jersey after 
deregulation. In New York, interest rates went up between 15% and 20%. 
</P>
<P>
The record is devoid of any evidence supporting higher retail credit card 
interest rates. For the sake of California's consumers, perhaps we need to take 
a second look.

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE EXECUTIVES AT U.S. STEEL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your story about the troubled Monongahela River Valley steelworkers needs a 
follow-up ("The Struggle to Rebuild After Big Steel Moved Out" Sept. 27). 
</P>
<P>
What happened to the top managers, the chairman of the board, and the directors 
of U.S. Steel who made the decisions, years ago, which resulted in the losses 
of jobs for steelworkers and the closing of plants? I'll bet few of them were 
racked economically.

UNLESS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES GET BACK ON THE FAST TRACK, THE TRAIN 
OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY WILL PASS US BY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I found that Michael Schrage's column ("Entrepreneurial Gap at Local 
Universities" Sept. 14) hit a resonant set of truths and that the letter in 
rebuttal by James Zumberge, University of Southern California's president, 
smacked of the bland response of the old power in its sunset years. 
</P>
<P>
As the sixth largest economy in the world and a major trade center for the U.S. 
economy, Southern California cannot rest on its laurels and ignore its 
responsibility in supporting the global economic war that we as a nation are on 
the verge of losing. Entrepreneurship and high-technology enterprise will 
likely play a pivotal role in this war. Yet the vast technological resources 
remain virtually imprisoned in the aerospace and defense companies of the 
region, and the sacred catacombs of local academia. 
</P>
<P>
It was not always this way. Simon Ramo, Arnold Beckman, Henry Singleton, Dutch 
Kindleberger, Howard Hughes, Tex Thornton in the 1940s to the 1960s forged 
giants such as Hughes, TRW, North American Aviation, Litton, Teledyne and 
Beckman Instruments. 
</P>
<P>
One need merely ask, "Where are Southern California's equivalents today?" 
Perhaps there are a few possibilities such as Ashton-Tate, Amgen and AST 
Research, but there seem to be no sure fireballs. Let's not restrict ourselves 
to Silicon Valley. Where are our equivalents to Microsoft, Compaq Computers, 
Apollo, Lotus, Federal Express and MCI? 
</P>
<P>
Let there be no mistake about it. Semiconductor technology is the crude oil of 
the second half of the 20th Century and will change our economy and way of life 
irrevocably. Biotechnology will be the crude oil of perhaps most of the 21st 
Century and, riding on the wave of electronics technology, will change our 
longevity, our philosophy of life, our social memory and cultural evolution, in 
addition to our economic way of life. 
</P>
<P>
You will find no firms involved in these industries in Century City, in West 
L.A. or at the surf in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Shall we get on the train or watch it go by?

BUS FIRM'S USE OF PARKING LOT MIFFS NEIGHBORS; 
</P>
<P>
TOURISM: EFFORTS TO BOOST TOURISM INDUSTRY IN HOLLYWOOD PITS ECONOMIC INTERESTS 
AGAINST NEIGHBORS COMPLAINING ABOUT BUS NOISE AND POLLUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a move to bring more tourists to Hollywood, Los Angeles City Councilman 
Michael Woo has allowed Starline Sightseeing Tours to use a parking lot near 
Hollywood Boulevard as a bus station since July. But city inspectors say the 
company does not have a permit to run the North Whitley Avenue station, and 
regional air quality officials, responding to neighborhood complaints, allege 
that the operation is a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
Senior city inspector Mark Morrow said in an interview that the Department of 
Building and Safety will ask the city attorney's office this week to file 
criminal misdemeanor charges against Starline. Morrow said the company, despite 
repeated notices and a deadline extension, has not obtained a permit, which he 
said is required to run the station. If convicted, Morrow said Starline will be 
forced to close the bus station. 
</P>
<P>
"The permitted use right now for that property is auto parking," Morrow said. 
"They need a permit to change the use to a bus station. . . . We are alleging 
that they are operating in violation of the Los Angeles Municipal Code." 
</P>
<P>
Starline owner Vahid Sapir would not comment on the allegations last week. 
Ernie Gallipo, a transportation consultant hired by Starline, declined to 
answer questions about the bus station but denied that it is operating 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
"The property they are running on right now is legally adapted to their type of 
program," Gallipo said. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said last week that he was unaware that Starline was operating without a 
change-of-use permit or that idling buses at the station had been declared a 
public nuisance by air quality officials. The agreement Woo reached with 
Starline in August outlined specific restrictions on bus operations, including 
one allowing the buses to idle their engines for no more than 15 minutes, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we tried to do was work out a compromise that would restrict the buses 
but still allow them to do business," Woo said. "The tourism industry is an 
important part of the Hollywood economy." 
</P>
<P>
The bus station serves as a clearinghouse for Starline's tours throughout the 
Los Angeles area. Starline officials would not provide information about 
ridership from the Hollywood station. In February, when Starline bought the Los 
Angeles, Orange County and Santa Barbara operations of Gray Line Tours, Sapir 
said the combined companies had a fleet of about 150 buses carrying 2.5 million 
passengers a year. 
</P>
<P>
The 10,000-square-foot parking-lot-turned-bus-station had been used by 
motorists shopping along Hollywood Boulevard, city officials said. The property 
still looks like a parking lot, except it is now posted with signs for various 
tourist destinations, such as Universal Studios and Disneyland, and is crowded 
several times a day with a dozen or so buses and vans. Riders purchase tour 
tickets at a nearby shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Andrews, who oversees transportation issues in Hollywood for the 
Community Redevelopment Agency, said the agency helped Woo's office craft the 
conditions placed on the Starline station. Although the CRA has no authority 
over the station, it lies within the 1.7-square-mile Hollywood redevelopment 
project governed by the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the city removed several parking meters on Hollywood 
Boulevard outside the Janes House -- a Victorian home adjacent to the Whitley 
Avenue lot that houses a visitors and convention bureau -- and replaced them 
with a bus unloading zone. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, Starline agreed to various parking and route restrictions (the buses 
cannot "orbit" in residential neighborhoods, for example) and also pledged to 
give its passengers literature on Hollywood attractions and to consider 
advertising Hollywood businesses in its buses. 
</P>
<P>
"If a tour bus comes in at 8:20 and the Anaheim bus doesn't leave until 9:30, 
those people are walking around and hopefully spending their money in 
Hollywood," said Andrews. "One of the economic development strategies in 
Hollywood is to reinforce Hollywood as a legitimate stop on the Southern 
California tour." 
</P>
<P>
But the new bus station has angered residents and some workers along the 1700 
block of Whitley, which is just around the corner from the Janes House. 
Employees at Interview magazine and Limelight Production Co., who work out of a 
two-story building next to the bus station, said they have been forced to close 
their windows because of fumes from idling buses. Several said Starline has 
occasionally posted "No Parking" signs on a fence outside their building to 
reserve metered spaces for buses. 
</P>
<P>
"Thirteen buses will be lined up here at busy times," said Gore Verbinski, who 
works at Limelight. "We all get headaches." 
</P>
<P>
DeHaven Collins, whose apartment is in the same building as the magazine and 
production company, said she has clocked some buses idling their engines for 
more than five hours. She said the bus station should be moved to an industrial 
or commercial area. 
</P>
<P>
"This is residential here," she said. "There are plenty of parking lots that 
are away from people's homes." 
</P>
<P>
Woo, however, defended the parking lot as an ideal location for a tour bus 
station because of its proximity to the Janes House. Passengers enter Starline 
buses from a small shopping center in front of the historic home. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unreasonable to expect all of the tour buses to disappear from Hollywood 
Boulevard," Woo said. "It is reasonable to prevent them from circulating in 
residential neighborhoods. Here we have the problem of a residential area 
directly adjacent to an area known for tourism uses. I am trying to enable both 
sides of the controversy to live and let live." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the bus station opened in July, Barbara Bass, who lives in an 
apartment building across the street from the station, collected 40 signatures 
from her neighbors opposed to the station and sent them to Woo. She also 
complained to the South Coast Air Quality Management District about exhaust 
fumes from the idling buses. AQMD inspectors began monitoring the station in 
late July, and on Aug. 17 cited Starline as a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials said last week that the case has been referred to the agency's 
investigation unit for possible criminal prosecution. Public nuisance 
convictions can carry a maximum $25,000 fine per day. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials, however, said that there have been fewer complaints about the 
buses in the last few weeks and that Starline "has been very cooperative 
recently." AQMD spokesman David Rutherford said the bus company had installed 
air conditioners in an adjacent building because of complaints about exhaust 
fumes, but some residents and workers along Whitley said they knew nothing 
about air conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
"I sure could have used one on some of those hot summer days," Collins said.

ARTIST CONSIDERS LEAVING WORK IN BEVERLY HILLS, BUT DOES THE CITY WANT IT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Five rusty metal buoys, two old window mullions and a winch: The unveiling of 
George Herms' "Moon Dial" sculpture set off an outcry that made Beverly Hills 
officials think twice about public art. 
</P>
<P>
Now they may have to think again. As the loan period for "Moon Dial" nears an 
end, Herms says he is thinking about leaving it where it is. Permanently. 
</P>
<P>
So far, city officials are managing to contain their enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
"If and when he does make the offer, we'll have to look at it," said 
Councilwoman Vicki Reynolds, who was a member of the City Council committee 
that asked Herms to move the artwork shortly after it was installed in a park 
along Santa Monica Boulevard last year. He refused, and the city agreed to 
leave it in place for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the 18 months are nearly over, said Ellen Byrens, chair of the city's 
Fine Arts Committee, it's time for "Moon Dial" to go. "It's like renting a car 
or any other contract," she said. "When the period is over, you return it. You 
can have my assurance that . . . the piece will be removed." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, Reynolds said, is about to take another look at the whole 
question of art in public places. When it does, she said, "Moon Dial," which is 
much more widely known among city officials and residents by the nickname 
"Rusty Balls," will have to be considered like any other work. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people wanted to keep the gardens free of art entirely," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Some neighbors would settle for simply keeping the gardens free of "Moon Dial." 
</P>
<P>
"It's ugly," said Arlene Cohen, who lives just over the city line in Los 
Angeles and often passes the sculpture on her walks. "I think it should be 
moved to the garbage dump." 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Jack, added that when he first saw the work, "I thought some 
vandals had dumped it there." 
</P>
<P>
Herms, 54, a West Los Angeles artist whose work has been the subject of more 
than 30 one-man shows and more than 50 group shows, designed "Moon Dial" at the 
request of the Fine Arts Committee. 
</P>
<P>
He won the commission's approval for his model, drawings and photos of the 
materials he would use. After "Moon Dial" was unveiled, new rules were adopted 
requiring that an artwork be completed before it can be considered for public 
display, with the final decision up to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
There is no date yet for the "clipping and dumping," as one city employee put 
it, of "Moon Dial," but a decision is expected when the Fine Arts Committee 
meets Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Installation of the artwork took two trucks, a forklift, an arc welder and 
seven workers. Herms said removing it would be just as big a challenge, "sort 
of like the Normandy invasion in reverse." 
</P>
<P>
Herms said he found the window grates at a junkyard in El Monte and the marine 
equipment at a salvage shop in Wilmington. The sculpture, he said, was designed 
expressly for the Santa Monica Boulevard site, and he doesn't have anyplace 
else to put it. 
</P>
<P>
Selling the piece to a private buyer is out. "That's almost like censorship, 
putting in the bedroom of a rich collector," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And "Moon Dial" just wouldn't be the same anywhere else. If another site could 
be found, there might be "Son of Moon Dial," but Herms said he was not ready to 
even think about moving the sculpture from its current spot. 
</P>
<P>
"It sits between a magnolia tree and a coral tree, and there's a lot of 
relationships that developed there," Herms said. 
</P>
<P>
"Moon Dial" is about the inevitability of decay, Herms said. He calls it his 
"salute to the Beverly Hills I know," a glittering city where rust is 
unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an issue that has to do with permanence," he said. "We feel that 
something that's shiny and polished can be kept shiny and polished, whereas 
rust represents a flow of time and a gradual erosion. . . . What I like in my 
work is for it to be at that crossroad where our civilization has made its 
impression on organic materials, such as steel, but now (the materials are) 
beginning to turn and go back." 
</P>
<P>
Designed to look like a device that ancients might have used to track the 
transit of the moon, the assemblage occupies a lawn near the corner of Santa 
Monica Boulevard, Beverly Boulevard and Palm Drive, where an average of 35,000 
cars a day pass by. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're sitting there waiting for the light to change, you may spend more 
time in front of the 'Moon Dial' than many people do in front of a picture in a 
museum," said Herms, a lecturer on sculpture and photography at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is thinking of donating the work to the city as a memorial to the 
late George Schlaff, a former mayor who wrote a letter defending "Moon Dial" 
when it came under attack in April, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But Alfred J. Hyman, who lives nearby, finds the very thought horrific. 
</P>
<P>
He was moved to doggerel when "Moon Dial" first appeared: "The city fathers / 
Should be more cautious / And avoid such art / That makes one nauseous." 
</P>
<P>
That was printed in a local newspaper last April, but the muse has not 
abandoned Hyman, a real estate broker, and time has not blunted his criticism. 
Now, he says, "Everyone with common sense must know / That hideous artwork 
certainly must go." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine them accepting it," Hyman said in a more prosaic vein. "I've 
walked by there every morning for years, and once that appeared I had to close 
my eyes every morning -- and sometimes I'd walk into a tree."

DEVELOPERS FIND 'WINDOW' SHUT IN 2 AREAS; 
</P>
<P>
NEIGHBORHOODS: A BUILDING BAN HAS NOT YET TAKEN EFFECT IN PICO-FAIRFAX AND 
CRENSHAW, BUT DEVELOPERS ARE FINDING IT TOUGH TO GET PERMITS BEFORE IT DOES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles is refusing to issue building permits for two areas of 
Councilman Nate Holden's 10th District that are covered by a building 
moratorium that is not yet in effect, according to some developers. 
</P>
<P>
The permit denials have frustrated efforts by developers to get their projects 
under way during the 30-day window they thought they had between the passage of 
the ban last week over Mayor Tom Bradley's veto and its enactment next month. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium was proposed by Holden in September because developers were 
trying to build before another growth-management measure, called an Interim 
Control Ordinance, could wend its way through the planning and public hearing 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Bank, a developer denied a permit, said he doesn't know how to proceed 
because the rules keep changing. "I think a lot of people's rights have been 
violated," Bank said. "I think the city has taken a position that is totally 
illegal." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another group of developers who had obtained demolition and building 
permits before the moratorium was passed has frustrated homeowners by rolling 
diesel trucks into the neighborhood they fought to preserve and razing five 
houses on Hi Point Street in the Pico-Fairfax area. 
</P>
<P>
These developers, are racing to excavate and get their foundations poured 
before the temporary moratorium takes effect the first week in November. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surrounded by diesel trucks," said homeowner Veda Steinhart, a founding 
member of the Pico-Fairfax Good Neighbors Assn. "You can imagine what it smells 
like." 
</P>
<P>
Steinhart said she had to call police Thursday to get a catering truck to move 
off the street. 
</P>
<P>
Builders had their complaints too. Mike Stern put a guard at his site in the 
Pico-Fairfax area after a truckload of water was dumped into his unfinished 
apartment building foundation a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Pico-Fairfax homeowners have argued that their integrated neighborhood of 
moderately priced, single-family Spanish bungalows was worth saving. But a plan 
passed a decade ago zoned their area for apartments. A second area near 
Crenshaw and Wilshire, included in the moratorium, also was rezoned for 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for several of the developers, Benjamin Reznik, said the Department 
of Building and Safety is acting illegally and he has threatened legal action 
if the permits are not issued. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Building and Safety General Manager Warren O'Brien, Reznik said 
there "is no legal justification for utilizing the not-yet-effective moratorium 
as a basis for denying issuance of a building permit." 
</P>
<P>
Reznik, who in that instance was acting for a developer seeking to build in the 
Crenshaw-Wilshire area, said the department cannot treat the moratorium as 
though it had been adopted as an urgency measure because the 12 council votes 
required for immediate implementation were not obtained. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien refused to respond to calls from The Times. A secretary said he had 
instructed another official to answer questions, but that official could not be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
However, Assistant City Atty. Claudia McGee-Henry said the department is 
justified in denying permits. "It is within their discretion to look at the 
situation and see if during this interim period they want to retain the status 
quo," McGee-Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
Holden agreed. "Why let them tear up the place when they know the moratorium is 
going into effect in three weeks?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Developers who think their rights are being violated can appeal to the city 
Board of Building and Safety, an option already taken by two of them, 
McGee-Henry said. Their appeals are scheduled to be heard this week. 
</P>
<P>
The delays work against the developers, who must have their projects well under 
way when the ban goes into effect or risk being told to halt construction. 
</P>
<P>
Holden said the homeowners may mount a court challenge to the permits that were 
issued. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners are "deflated and demoralized. . . . It's just another example 
of what can happen to your community when City Hall doesn't listen to voters," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Holden, his colleague Robert Farrell has introduced to the City 
Council another way to slow down the development process. Farrell's idea is to 
resurrect a defunct ordinance requiring public notice when a single-family home 
is to be demolished in case anyone wants to move it.

DUARTE FIRM TAILORS TEXTS FOR A LOCALE AND HERITAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIOK-HIAN TAY KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eskimo Chief Willie Kasayulie smiled faintly as he recalled a child in his 
village seeing a moose for the first time -- and calling it a cow. 
</P>
<P>
Concern accompanied his amusement. 
</P>
<P>
Textbooks from the Lower 48 states describe skyscrapers, farms and pigs -- 
ideas foreign to his Yupiit tribe in western Alaska. But the familiar moose, 
berry picking and salmon fishing were never mentioned, lamented Kasayulie, who 
is president of the Yupiit School District's governing board. 
</P>
<P>
To remedy the situation, the district decided to buy culturally relevant 
reading materials for grades 2 through 9. 
</P>
<P>
It turned to Hoffman Custom Products, a publishing firm in Duarte that 
customizes supplemental reading programs for school districts. 
</P>
<P>
For $400,000, the firm wrote texts featuring maps of the villages, wildlife 
sketches by a local artist and stories sprinkled with names of residents. 
</P>
<P>
By weaving accounts of time-honored Yupik practices into reading materials, 
district officials hope to strengthen children's respect for their elders and a 
heritage that spans 10,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents have lost a lot of stature," Kasayulie said of his tribe on the 
Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, 500 miles southwest of Anchorage. "We're trying to 
recapture that before it is totally lost." 
</P>
<P>
Although the customized books are now just supplemental texts for the 307 
students in six schools, Yupiit Supt. Brad Raphel said they will replace basic 
readers by fall. Kasayulie and other Yupik school officials visited Duarte this 
year to review the texts. 
</P>
<P>
Ada Sullivan, president of Hoffman Custom Products, said nine employees and up 
to 25 free-lance writers write the texts in collaboration with district 
officials. The firm has also customized texts for schools in Cincinnati, 
Detroit, Cleveland and Dade County, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Reading specialists disagree over how reading materials should be used. 
</P>
<P>
Aileen Johnson, a UCLA reading language specialist, doubts the value of writing 
texts to fit instructional goals. Reading concepts should be taught using 
literary works, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing like a good book," she said, adding that if literature is used 
properly, no supplements should be needed. 
</P>
<P>
John McNeil, a UCLA literacy professor, disagreed, saying that most classics 
reflect the culture of a white upper class, denying the experiences of 
minorities and current issues such as environmental problems and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the nation's 15,500 school districts use a reading textbook with 
classics as supplements, according to Donald Ecklund, school division vice 
president of the Assn. of American Publishers. 
</P>
<P>
The content in Hoffman's Yupik books is more than 75% local and includes 
passages on native legends, the tanning of animal skins and even False Teeth, 
the local dog-sled racing champ. 
</P>
<P>
In one exercise, in which students must decide the focus of a story, the ritual 
of filling a dead seal with snow is explained: "The woman did this so the 
seal's spirit would not get thirsty. Then the seal's spirit could go back to 
the sea." 
</P>
<P>
Most lessons are presented in English and Yupik, the first language for the 
youngsters. Children learn that "assirluku snow-go-m Kitugtellra" becomes "the 
best way to fix a snowmobile." 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati Public School System also wanted regional information in its 
supplemental books. The 52,000-student district was searching for supplemental 
material to help teach reading, writing, listening, speaking and thinking 
skills in one program, said Reginald Green, Cincinnati's deputy superintendent 
of instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman tailored the program for kindergarten through eighth grade for 
$900,000, incorporating local tidbits in 30% of the material. 
</P>
<P>
In a writing lesson, the legendary Johnny Appleseed is described wandering 
along the Ohio River laden with a sack of apple seeds. Elizabeth Blackwell, the 
nation's first female doctor and a Cincinnati native, is also mentioned. Green 
said that teachers have reported their students are progressing faster and that 
parents have told him their children are reading more on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Ecklund said he has not heard of other publishers who customize textbooks. 
Hoffman, he said, is "unique; most publishers cater to national markets." 
</P>
<P>
Customizing for every school district would simply not be profitable for major 
publishers, said Gail Burns, product manager of Massachusetts-based 
Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., a national textbook publisher for elementary and 
secondary schools. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman, which has produced reading texts and audiovisual aids for two decades, 
launched its customizing division two years ago, Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
The company has also designed computer software for scoring tests in Dade 
County, Fla., schools and created a remedial reading program for pupils in 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
The Yupiit Reading Project was Hoffman's toughest challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-year-old school district, which began using the program in fourth through 
sixth grades in 1988, includes the villages of Akiachak, Akiak and Tulusak. 
Surrounded by willow-covered tundra, the villages are in a wildlife refuge on 
land belonging to the native Alaskans. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman's writers interviewed village elders and studied the Tundra Times, a 
local newspaper, to capture the native flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Williams, Yupiit school board vice president, said students and parents 
have told him that the project has increased their self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
The number of books or periodicals checked out from libraries in the villages 
has leaped from 54 to 1,700 a month, Raphel, the district's superintendent, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The customized textbooks also educate teachers on the Yupik way of life, he 
said. "A lot of them are from the Lower 48 and don't know the area, the 
climate, the people. They would come in, bring their little packets of material 
and teach what they were familiar with." 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, the new materials have changed the way teachers view students' 
absences for food-gathering trips. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging outdoor learning as legitimate and elders as experts, Hoffman has 
also designed grade sheets for parents to rate their children on traditional 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of the abilities listed would make the average child in the Lower 48 
wince: "Can endure continuous berry picking, knows the proper wood for smoking 
fish, understands winter and cold survival techniques, practices gun safety 
laws, makes nightly entries into school journal." 
</P>
<P>
"Learning cannot be isolated from the environment," because everything is seen 
through a cultural filter, said Hoffman vice president Carol Bradley, a former 
educator. 
</P>
<P>
She recalled how an Alaskan teacher's aide described Los Angeles' night lights 
as she flew into LAX: "It's like berries on the tundra."

PLANS FOR MALIBU EQUESTRIAN CENTER APPROVED BY STATE, SCHOOL DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District and the California Coastal 
Commission have given the go-ahead to plans for an equestrian center in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The equestrian park, which will be on leased school district property near 
Point Dume, will be developed and operated by the county Department of Parks 
and Recreation. Two horse arenas, a multipurpose field and other facilities 
will be built on half of the 20-acre site, and the other half will remain 
vacant. 
</P>
<P>
The school board on Tuesday unanimously approved a master plan for the park 
that included several revisions it had previously demanded, including 
provisions for boundary fencing and limits on the loudness of a public-address 
system. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the California Coastal Commission approved the project, subject 
to certain conditions, said county landscape architect Larry Hensley, who is 
guiding the project through the approval process. Those conditions include 
controls on erosion during construction, commission review of final landscaping 
and parking lot plans, and commission approval of a trail that will link the 
park to a proposed horse trail that would run to the Zuma Ridge Trail in the 
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, Hensley said. The commission 
also set construction time schedules, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Construction is expected to start early next year and be completed by mid-1992, 
Hensley said. 
</P>
<P>
The project has been studied and changed by several governmental agencies since 
1981, when the county, the school district and the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy agreed to develop the land for recreational use. The county 
originally wanted an all-purpose park with baseball diamonds, but that idea was 
later thrown out partly because it would have required extensive excavation and 
grading. County officials have also said the site is ideal for an equestrian 
center because hundreds of horse owners live within a few miles. 
</P>
<P>
It has taken eight years to get to this stage, Hensley said, because "you have 
public agencies working together, and they're each trying to satisfy the part 
of the population they serve the most . . . (and they) have other things to do. 
. . . It's just a fact of life in this day and age." 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project, estimated to cost $1.4 million, will entail 
grading, landscaping, installation of water and electrical utilities, and 
construction of two arenas and a children's play area. 
</P>
<P>
The second phase, which doesn't yet have a cost estimate, will include terraced 
spectator seating, a community center and a graded multipurpose field, Hensley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The park, which will be open from dawn to dusk, will have enough parking for 50 
cars and 55 vehicles with horse trailers. 
</P>
<P>
Hensley said the thumbs up by the district and the commission were a relief. 
"Any time you get any portion of a project completed, you feel you can see more 
of a glimmer at the end of the tunnel."

AROUND THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY: THE ROWLAND HIGH FAMILY RESPONDS WHEN A LITTLE 
GIRL NEEDS HELP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mary R. Heffron 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rowland High School was just a year old when Dick Ferrell, fresh out of 
college, began teaching there in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
"Back then," he said last week in his office in a portable classroom, "you 
could have shot a cannon down Colima." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Colima Road is lined with fast food outlets and gas stations and strip 
shopping centers, and behind them are houses and apartments and garages that 
spew people and cars by the thousands onto Colima and Nogales and all over 
Rowland Heights to the Pomona Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
There are 2,500 students at Rowland High now, and more than 100 teachers. One 
of them is Paul Nuccio, who with Ferrell is a 1960 alumnus of Glendale High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
This is a story of friendship and hardship. The friendship goes way back, as 
far as the Little League for two men now well into middle age. 
</P>
<P>
The hardship is more recent. It has to do with Nuccio's little girl, Danielle. 
Danielle has spent five of her 8 years ingesting medicine and chemicals and 
radiation in an effort to kill the disease inside of her before the disease, 
leukemia, kills Danielle. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, the chemotherapy appeared to be working. She went almost four 
years without a relapse, which increased her chances of complete recovery, 
before she suffered a major seizure last year. So, Danielle went back to the 
City of Hope Medical Center in Duarte for more chemotherapy and radiation. 
</P>
<P>
Nuccio and his wife, Sharon, handled much of the chemotherapy at home, giving 
Danielle the nauseating medicine on Fridays so the little girl could recover 
and be back to school on Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
Then, just after she started the second grade at Sellers Elementary in 
Glendora, Danielle suffered a seizure at school. The chemotherapy wasn't taming 
the monster anymore, and the monster was taking over Danielle's body. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the doctors say, Danielle's only hope is a bone marrow transplant. Her 
parents, sister Victoria, brother Steve and other relatives all had their blood 
tested. Usually, there's a one in four chance that a family member will have 
the proper blood type to donate bone marrow. 
</P>
<P>
The odds weren't with the Nuccios. But something more important was. 
</P>
<P>
"She's just such a special kid," Ferrell says of the girl with big brown eyes 
who likes Barbie dolls and "The Cosby Show" and who cheerfully endures needles 
and vomiting and the loss of her hair. "She's just used to wearing a little wig 
and going to school. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We like to think of ourselves as a family, everybody in this school district. 
Whenever there's a need, a communication comes out. Someone in the Rowland 
family needs help." 
</P>
<P>
This time, Ferrell put the communication out. He's organized two blood tests 
already to find that stranger -- the odds are up to one in 20,000 now -- whose 
blood will show a marrow that could match Danielle's. 
</P>
<P>
About 70 people, predominantly from the Rowland Unified School District -- 
since donors must be 18, most students weren't eligible -- were tested during 
those two days. None of them matched. 
</P>
<P>
So now, Ferrell and others at the school are planning a third drive, from 1 to 
7 p.m. Wednesday at the school, 2000 S. Otterbein St. The school district is 
</P>
<P>
publicizing the drive, and Rowland High is taking appointments for blood tests 
at (818) 964-2355 or 965-3448. Appointments aren't required; they're just to 
give the testers an idea of how many people will be there. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there's another drive from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. today at the 
Nuccios' church, St. Dorothy's in Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
The drives are coordinated through Life-Savers Foundation, a marrow match 
operation set up by Dr. Rudolf Brutoco of Covina that taps into a nationwide 
network of donors. Brutoco started the foundation after his wife was stricken 
with leukemia; she got a marrow transplant and was cured. 
</P>
<P>
With a transplant -- a simple, half-hour procedure for the donor, in which a 
needle extracts the liquid marrow from the hip bone -- survival rate for 
leukemia victims goes up to 70%. 
</P>
<P>
Through his family 's involvement with Life-Savers, Nuccio has gotten to know 
other children in Danielle's predicament. "Even if we found two or three donors 
for Danni today, I am going to try to stay active in the Life-Savers, because 
we're not fighting just for Danni's life but for the girl at Walnut High School 
and the boy in Brea," Nuccio says. 
</P>
<P>
He is calm, hopeful, with only the occasional gulp as he talks about his 
youngest child's ordeal. When he and his wife were told to take the chronically 
sick Danielle to City of Hope for tests five years ago, he says, they panicked. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife's cousin's 12-year-old son had died of leukemia. . . . When she was 
diagnosed, I thought my world was coming apart." 
</P>
<P>
Then came the long remission, and happy times. Last summer, for instance, the 
Make a Wish Foundation, which grants wishes to sick children, gave the family a 
trip to Walt Disney World in Florida. "We were feeling a little guilty," Nuccio 
says, "because she was doing so well. But then I talked to them and they said, 
no, go when she's well. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't afford it with two kids in college, and I figured I could pay them 
back later. It was a beautiful vacation for the whole family. 
</P>
<P>
"We came back and she started school. Midway through the second week, she had a 
seizure in class. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
While she's waiting for a marrow match, Danielle still goes to school. She 
still draws happy faces and rainbows and pictures of her home and family, 
sometimes even while she's waiting out the chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
"When she's well, it's a very uplifting time for my wife and I," Nuccio says. 
"When she's sick, it's back on the roller coaster for us. 
</P>
<P>
"She hasn't really known very many well days." Mary R. Heffron

PASADENA COLLEGE PLANS $17-MILLION, 3-STORY LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pasadena City College will build a $17-million, three-story library to replace 
a smaller, aging facility that dates from the 1950s, the school's president has 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
Ground breaking for the 90,000-square-foot building is set for mid-1990, and 
the new library is expected to open in 1992 at the southwest corner of Colorado 
Boulevard and Bonnie Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
It will be built with $15 million in funds provided by the state and $2 million 
that the college hopes to raise from alumni groups and charitable 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
School officials say the present facility, built in 1950 to serve 5,000 
students, lacks the space and books to serve today's student body of 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Gruen Associates of Los Angeles will design and build the library. The firm's 
architects have extensive experience in campus-related architecture: They built 
Claremont Colleges' Central Library, designed master plans for an addition to 
the central library at U.C. San Diego and the Miami University Art Museum and 
Cultural Center.

ARCHITECTURE AWARDS FETE DESIGNS THAT GO BEYOND MERE STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM HALL KAPLAN, TIMES DESIGN CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A variety of projects, from a residential remodel in Santa Monica to a major 
branch library in Berlin, West Germany, took top honors in this year's design 
awards program of the Los Angeles chapter of the American Institute of 
Architects (AIA). 
</P>
<P>
Honors also went to an addition to an artist's studio in Venice that was once a 
gas station, an ocean-side fourplex in Malibu and a commercial complex in Santa 
Monica that includes an art museum. Also awarded were seven citations to a 
variety of other projects by local architects. 
</P>
<P>
The designs, selected from a total of 135 submissions, "went to those projects 
which weren't necessarily avant-garde, but to those which the jury felt were 
well executed, beyond stylistic concerns," commented Larry Schlossberg and 
Herbert Nadel, co-chairmen of the chapter's awards committee. 
</P>
<P>
The jury was composed of three out-of-town architects, Joseph Esherick of San 
Francisco, A. Eugene Kohn of New York City and Myron Goldsmith of Chicago. All 
are honored Fellows of the AIA, with Esherick also a recipient of the coveted 
AIA Gold Medal. 
</P>
<P>
Concerning the overall quality of the submissions, Kohn said the large 
commercial architecture category was "most disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like buildings are still being transplanted from other places," he 
said, and that "tall buildings here tend to still be objects." 
</P>
<P>
The jury also said it was disappointed in how few quality residential projects 
they saw. However, the three that did receive awards were cited for being 
firmly in "the great tradition of Neutra and Schindler." 
</P>
<P>
These were a remodel of a 1960 tract home into a studio and residence for the 
Edwards family, designed by the firm of Appleton, Mechur &amp; Associates; the 
Seacliff Homes in Malibu, by Stephen Kanner of Kanner &amp; Associates, and the 
Tanaka/Ho residence in Venice, by Ted Tanaka. The former two received honor 
awards and the latter a merit award. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transformed House 
</P>
<P>
"The architect and an equally creative owner have succeeded in transforming an 
old tract house into a single unified house-garden design," said Esherick of 
the Appleton, Mechur &amp; Associates project. Kohn noted in particular how the 
design "provides a sense of privacy and street wall along the street and a 
sensitive relaxed and light-filled response to the terraced gardens at the 
back." 
</P>
<P>
The Seacliff design by Kanner was praised by Kohn for, among other things, "its 
simplicity of form, its clarity of plan and section, its feeling for light." 
Esherick added that "The project is a model of what can be achieved by a 
compact row house scheme, admittedly opulent but graceful and elegantly 
handled." The design also has been honored in this year's state AIA awards 
program. 
</P>
<P>
In bestowing an honor award on the Okulick Studio in Venice, designed by Steven 
Ehrlich, the jury cited how the renovation and addition captured the essence of 
its uses, "vertical spaces, natural translucent light and large wall surfaces 
to feature objects of art." 
</P>
<P>
Also honored were the designs by Frank O. Gehry &amp; Associates of the Edgemar 
commercial and museum complex in Santa Monica, and Moore Ruble Yudell of the 
Humboldt Bibliothek in Berlin. The latter is the first phase of a cultural 
center for an ambitious government-sponsored master plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Gehry design was praised by juror Goldsmith for its "mixture of simple 
buildings with sculptural elements," and the Moore Ruble Yudell design by Kohn 
for being sensitively sited, and for its interior. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Tanaka design of his own residence, other merit awards winners were 
Maris Peika of Gruen Associates for a parking structure in Beverly Hills; Leroy 
Miller Associates for the Leonard I. Beerman Early Childhood Center off of 
Sepulveda Boulevard in Bel-Air and the O'Leary Terasawa Partnership for the 
Marymount High School library, north of UCLA and Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parking Structure Cited 
</P>
<P>
The parking structure adjacent to Santa Monica Boulevard between Linden and 
Beverly drives was praised by Esherick for greatly improving the street 
environment rather than degrading it, "as too often the case with parking 
structures"; the center by Goldsmith as "very appropriate for children," and 
the library by Esherick for fitting "gracefully" into a setting of older 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
Other winners of merit awards were David Lawrence Gray &amp; Associates for the 
adaptive reuse of the landmark Sunset Tower on Sunset Boulevard in West 
Hollywood from an apartment house to a hotel; Dworsky Associates for an 
expansion of an engineering building on the State University campus in San 
Jose, and Frank O. Gehry &amp; Associates for the Herman Miller office 
furniture distribution center facility in Rocklin, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
The reuse of Sunset Tower was called by the jury a "sensitive" and "faithful 
restoration"; the San Jose State expansion "a most successful solution, well 
executed" and "very professional," and the Herman Miller facility "refreshingly 
unconventional." 
</P>
<P>
In a summary of the program, Schlossberg, a member of the firm of Gruen 
Associates, noted that of the 12 projects honored this year, at least five had 
been submitted last year but did not win. 
</P>
<P>
"This brings up at least two points," Schlossberg observed. "First, persistence 
pays off, and second, we should all bear in mind, winners and losers alike, 
that these design awards while justifiably coveted, largely represent the 
opinions of three individuals on a particular day."

HOT PROPERTY: 'MURPHY BROWN' BUYS NEAR WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Emmy-winning actress CANDICE BERGEN is buying a house in the Beverly Hills Post 
Office Area as a place to live while shooting her CBS-TV show "Murphy Brown." 
</P>
<P>
"The asking price was very reasonable for a 3,000-square-foot house at that 
location, and the sellers bought another house and didn't want to play games, 
so I'd think she's paying close to the $1,295,000 price tag," said a broker not 
involved in the deal. The property is still in escrow. 
</P>
<P>
The sellers bought a Beverly Hills home that another realtor described as "a 
nice little Mediterranean in the 3s," meaning the $3-million range. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1957, the one-story, Colonial-style house that Bergen is buying has 
three bedrooms, maid's quarters, four baths, a fireplace and a pool. 
</P>
<P>
Bergen, daughter of the late ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, lived nearby as a 
child in a walled hacienda overlooking the Beverly Hills Hotel. Known as Bella 
Vista, that property -- which Bergen described in her 1984 autobiography as 
being "high on a mountain, at the end of a steep, twisting road" -- was later 
owned by comedian Shelley Berman. It sold again about a year ago for 
$2,575,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bergen also has homes in France and New York with her husband, French film 
director Louis Malle, and their 4-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Tito Jackson, one of singer MICHAEL JACKSON'S brothers, and his wife, Delores, 
are planning to move to the beach and have put their 3.5-acre Encino home on 
the market for $6.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The property, a quarter of a mile from the Encino home where the Jacksons grew 
up, was formerly owned by Sydney Chaplin, one of Charlie Chaplin's two 
half-brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Tito and his wife practically razed the 37-year-old house after they bought it 
in 1978 from a screenwriter with Disney Studios. 
</P>
<P>
In its place, they built a larger, Spanish-style house, designed by Arthur 
Valdez, on three levels, with an elevator and about 10,000 square feet, 
including five fireplaces, five bedrooms, seven baths, maid's quarters, a game 
room, gym, library, breakfast room and recording studio, where Tito and his 
brothers Jermaine, Randy and Jackie recorded their 2300 Jackson Street album. 
</P>
<P>
The home also has a cabana, pool, spa, carport and heated and air-conditioned 
five-car garage with a workshop. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, it also has a batting cage," said listing agent Barbara Robinson of 
Alvarez, Hyland &amp; Young in Beverly Hills. That's of special interest to 
her, because her husband is Baltimore Orioles Manager Frank Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
DIANNE FEINSTEIN, former mayor of San Francisco, has leased a Century City 
condo to be near her Southern California campaign offices. 
</P>
<P>
The gubernatorial candidate is paying $2,500 a month rent for her temporary 
home, which she is redecorating, though she only leased it for six months. 
</P>
<P>
A 700-acre ranch in Santa Ynez Valley, owned in the '60s by FRED ASTAIRE has 
been sold to a Huntington Beach-based real estate developer for $4.08 million. 
</P>
<P>
The buyer plans to use the property, known as Rebalot Farm, as a second home. 
It was a thoroughbred ranch and has a 2-mile turf training track, but the new 
owner isn't interested in horses. He bought the ranch for its beauty and 
privacy, said Kerry Mormann, who handled the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Al Gersten Jr., a builder who is in the fast-food business, has decided to sell 
his 16-room "Pacific Palace" in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The 23,000-square-foot home has eight bedrooms, all with direct access to the 
swimming pool; 12 baths, two guest houses and a disco. The $2.95-million price 
includes furnishings and land. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not complicated to buy land down there anymore," said Cecelia Waeschle, 
who shares the listing with Joyce Rey, both of Rodeo Realty. Gersten is selling 
the house, which he had built a year ago, because he doesn't use it as much as 
he thought he would. 
</P>
<P>
NORMAN LEAR'S Act III Communications, known for such hit films as "Stand by Me" 
and "The Princess Bride," has leased 3,000 square feet of a Canoga Park office 
building that looks like a Queen Anne-style mansion, which is why its new 
owner, Stuart Marks, is calling it "The Victorian." 
</P>
<P>
The 34,000-square-foot building, at 19717-25 Sherman Way, was built in 1980 of 
materials from Los Angeles houses constructed in the 1890s. Designer Gail 
Claridge is giving it a fresh look. 
</P>
<P>
Mix Magazine, a recording-industry publication owned by Century-City 
headquartered Act III, plans to occupy the building, starting in November, 
according to Beitler Commercial Realty. 
</P>
<P>
A New York Times profile of BOB HOPE said earlier this month that "he lives on 
the wrong side of the Santa Monica Mountains -- on a street of modest homes a 
dozen miles away from Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
"Modest?" exclaimed Joe Babajian of Fred Sands Estates. "I sold the house next 
door to Bob Hope's for a little over $1 million, and I sold another one down 
the street for more than $2 million." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a fixer nearby at $2.7 million," said Dawn Papson of Ramsey Shilling, 
Better Homes and Gardens, which has offices in Hope's Toluca Lake neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyway," she joked, referring to Hope's vast real estate holdings, "he owns 
Toluca Lake, doesn't he? I don't think he's suffering." 
</P>
<P>
Some other celebrity residents near Hope's home are Henry Winkler, Jonathan 
Winters and Rick Dees.

CONDO Q&amp;A: BOARD SPENT HALF OF RESERVE ON RENOVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM, Hickenbottom is president of the Greater Los Angeles 
chapter of the Community Associations Institute (CAI), a national nonprofit 
research and educational organization. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: In the last six months, our board of directors has spent 50% of our 
reserves in addition to about $50,000 that was in the checking account. The 
board approved a major renovation of the lobby and hallways and paid for it 
over several months to avoid having to get approval of the homeowners to spend 
the money. The redecorating has changed our "Olde English Inn" decor to 
cheap-looking contemporary. What recourse do I have? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: The board has the right to use reserve funds for the repair, 
replacement or improvement of the property. Your reserve study should disclose 
when major expenditures are anticipated. When a large portion of the reserves 
are being depleted, the board should have a plan for replenishing those reserve 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to the work being done, the board had an obligation to show that the 
association could afford to do the remodeling without jeopardizing the overall 
financial stability. If there are no other major repairs, such as roofing, that 
will be needed in the near future, then the board may have acted properly. 
</P>
<P>
I sense that you are more upset with the choice of decor than with the large 
expenditures. I have never heard of a major improvement that 100% of the owners 
supported. As an individual homeowner you have the right to be heard, but if 
the majority of the owners like the improvements, what can you do? Now that the 
work is completed, it seems unreasonable to expect that the association would 
spend even more funds to change it. 
</P>
<P>
When you purchase in an association, you are automatically giving a tremendous 
amount of control to your board of directors. Most owners are glad to sit back 
and let the board make these major decisions for them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
President Says He's Not Read the CC&amp;Rs 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently attended my association's board meeting and questioned a 
decision. When I quoted certain parts of the CC&amp;Rs, the president's 
response was: "I've never read them, so I take other people's word for what the 
documents say." Doesn't the president have an obligation to read these 
governing documents? 
</P>
<P>
A: Of course, every owner should read the CC&amp;Rs and all of the governing 
documents. Certainly, the board has an obligation to read and understand them. 
If they cannot understand them, then they should consult an attorney. I assume 
that the president thought the response was a clever one. I feel that if board 
members haven't read the CC&amp;Rs, then they should not be serving on the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attorney on Board Makes CC&amp;R Changes 
</P>
<P>
Q: We currently have an attorney on our association board who is revising our 
CC&amp;Rs. When I asked why this was being done, he stated that he is updating 
them according to the recent changes in the state law. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that our documents (written in 1973) may need updating, but I would 
also like to know what the changes are and verify that they are legal and 
proper. The attorney who is making the changes says the owners will not be 
voting on this matter since the law mandates that these changes can be made 
without a vote of the membership. What advice can you give us? 
</P>
<P>
A: It appears that your attorney/board member does not specialize in common 
interest development law, or perhaps you misunderstood his answer. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the new legislation supersedes the association documents, in which 
case, changing your documents would not be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, certain phrases such as "unless the association's 
declaration otherwise provides" appear in several sections of the law. This 
means that the law does not supersede the association's documents. 
</P>
<P>
Changes in the wording of your association's CC&amp;Rs must always be submitted 
to the owners for a vote. The procedure for amending is explained in your 
CC&amp;Rs. 
</P>
<P>
If the amendment procedure is not explained, then you must refer to California 
Civil Code, Section 1355(b), where it is spelled out in detail. If the proper 
procedure is not followed, the amendment is not valid and would not be accepted 
for recording by the county. 
</P>
<P>
If your board wants to have the CC&amp;Rs revised, I recommend that you engage 
another attorney who specializes in common interest development law to provide 
further legal advice after your attorney/board member makes his recommendations 
on changes in the wording. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trees Are Obstructing Owner's Ocean View 
</P>
<P>
Q: Four months ago, I bought a condominium with a beautiful view of the beach. 
Some trees are growing and obstructing my view. I have sent three letters to 
the board president but nothing has been done. What can I do? 
</P>
<P>
A: You do not state whether the trees are on a neighbor's property or on 
association property. If it is a neighbor's property, perhaps the board has no 
power to act or perhaps they have requested that the trees be trimmed and the 
neighbor has not taken any action. 
</P>
<P>
Let's assume that the trees are on association property. Depending upon the 
size of the trees and the expense involved, the association may only trim the 
trees annually. Also, the species of the tree may determine the best time of 
year to trim for the good of the trees. In other words, there may be a valid 
reason for the board's delay, but they do owe you a timely response. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that you attend the next board meeting to inquire whether the board 
intends to take any action on your request, or write to the board again and 
request a written response by a specific date. Since the trees are not on your 
own property, you should not resort to trimming the trees yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Bear in mind that unless your view is clearly protected in the CC&amp;Rs, with 
specifications as to the acceptable height of the trees, the association may 
not have a legal obligation to trim them. There may be other owners who value 
these trees and do not want them trimmed. In that case the board will have to 
try to work out a compromise.

AT HOME: THE CHANGING FACE OF SANTA MONICA; 
</P>
<P>
NEIGHBORHOOD: RESIDENTS STRUGGLE TO PRESERVE SMALL-CITY LIFE STYLE THREATENED 
BY HIGH-PRICED HOMES, COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN, Feldman is a free-lance writer who lives in Santa Monica. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Men were warned to blindfold their women while passing through Santa Monica at 
the turn of the century because it was such a tough town. Saloons were 
everywhere, and park benches were "strewn with unsavory characters." 
</P>
<P>
According to the history books, a well-to-do citizen led the fight to close 
Santa Monica's bars by offering to pay the city what it would lose in licensing 
fees. He won the fight, and Santa Monica left its frontier reputation behind. 
</P>
<P>
And today, Santa Monica residents are fighting still, struggling to preserve a 
quality of life that is quickly disappearing because of high-priced homes and 
commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
Not only are traditional neighborhoods being disrupted by new building and 
heavy traffic but new home buyers tilt the city's old economic balance toward 
the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
The 96,000 residents of Santa Monica like the 3-square-mile city just the way 
it is, and if it were up to some they would close its gates to protect the 
pleasures of small-city life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Once Quiet Community 
</P>
<P>
They enjoy their 15-plus-mile bicycle paths, four-minute emergency response 
from police and fire departments, two hospitals, a college, a thriving art 
community, a public bus system and a pier with a carousel. 
</P>
<P>
When Roy and Maxine Naylor moved to the Sunset Park area of Santa Monica in the 
1950s, Santa Monica was still a quiet ocean-side community. 
</P>
<P>
The Naylors raised four children in a California bungalow they bought for less 
than $20,000. Today their children cannot afford to buy a home in the 
neighborhood they grew up in, where prices now start at $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish we'd bought property when it was cheap," Maxine Naylor said. "I'm 
amazed at values now." 
</P>
<P>
The Naylors have remodeled their home three times, enclosing a porch and adding 
onto the kitchen. Many residents choose to remodel rather than move because of 
the familiarity of the neighborhood. "Almost half of the people who moved in 
about the same time we did are still here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Red Erickson has been selling real estate for 26 years from his Montana Avenue 
office, and remembers that the now-costly homes of Sunset Park were tract homes 
developed on open fields for the Douglas Aircraft workers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Sunset Park is one of Santa Monica's two solidly residential areas, 
albeit the less prestigious community. The prime real estate area is the 
exclusive north of Montana section, where former $30,000 homes now sell for an 
average of $750,000 and what was once considered high-grade housing at $50,000 
now sells for $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
A house on La Mesa Drive, considered the most expensive street in Santa Monica, 
recently sold for a record $4 million. This street, where comedian Mel Brooks 
and actress wife Anne Bancroft live, recently had a bargain for under $3 
million dollars, but that's the lowest-priced home in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson said there are currently 55 houses for sale over the $1 million dollar 
level, and they are all north of Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Who's buying these houses? 
</P>
<P>
"My last eight sales have been to developers (who often tear down the existing 
and build a new, bigger home for resale) and buyers of Korean, Chinese and 
Japanese descent," said John Richards of Jon Douglas Co. 
</P>
<P>
"First-time buyers are priced out of the market, because sellers can't resist 
the all-cash deals or the 50% down sale," he said. "Sellers feel secure with 
contingency-free offers. Even physical inspections and termite reports are 
being waived." 
</P>
<P>
Also driving home prices up is the fact that Santa Monica doesn't have a large 
housing stock. Kenyon Webster, principal planner for the city, reported that 
"of the 47,000 housing units in the city, only 7,700 are single-family houses. 
The remaining 78%, according to a 1980 census, are renter-occupied." 
</P>
<P>
That number is changing monthly, because of the removal of rental units by 
building owners fed up with the low return on apartments under the city's 
strict rent control laws. Owners are either leaving their units vacant or 
giving them to family members. Some are being torn down and rebuilt as 
condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Rent-controlled apartments range from $235 for a one-bedroom unit to $500 for 
two bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Another prime residential area is north of Wilshire and west of 22nd Street, 
where streets have college names and houses sell for $800,000 on Berkeley Hill. 
A tear-down will sell for about $600,000, while a livable house can still be 
bought for $700,000, Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Condos Next Choice

If a buyer still wants to live north of Wilshire but can't afford a house, 
Richards said condos are the next affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
"But there aren't too many new ones. A single-level, two-bedroom, two-bath 
conversion north of Wilshire is selling between $260,000-$275,000. A townhouse 
built after 1982 is in the high $300s-low $400s. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Tom and Caroline Carroll moved to the Sunset Park area a year ago with their 
8-year-old son after renting in West Los Angeles. She's a facility planner at 
UCLA, and he's the executive director of the new 3rd Street Promenade in Santa 
Monica's revitalized downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
They paid in the mid-$300,000 range for a 1,200-square-foot, three-bedroom, 
one-bath house, managing the down payment by getting relatives together to 
invest in the property. According to Tom Carroll, the value of the house has 
already gone up, and it has been worth the sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Back to Downtown 
</P>
<P>
Carroll is a member of the team responsible for bringing people back to Santa 
Monica's downtown area. The once-popular outdoor mall fell on hard times and 
became a depressed area. Santa Monica's pier, considered the soul of Santa 
Monica, is also under development, and blueprints promise a family-oriented 
entertainment center. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond these two projects, it's hard to find any consensus regarding the 
proposed 8.3 million square feet of commercial development. There are at least 
three petitions being circulated to stop growth. 
</P>
<P>
Most people, like Caroline Carroll, want to protect the privileges of living in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to entice anyone to come to Santa Monica," she said. "I want to 
keep it the way it is. It feels like a small town. Services are generous, the 
air is nice and it's family-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
But development is not the only threat to the way of life in the city, 
residents say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crime by Homeless 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica is drawing homeless people by the thousands. More than 200 
residents at a recent gathering blamed the city's generous services for the 
influx of the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the homeless people are harmless, but crime is increasing by 
this group. Recently, two lifeguards were attacked by a homeless man wielding a 
corkscrew. 
</P>
<P>
"There were 4,700 citizen-initiated calls in 1989, and 1,120 of those calls 
were because of transients," said Sgt. John Miehle of the Santa Monica Police 
Department. "We spent 410 hours running down these complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, we had 276 burglaries, and 37% of them were committed by 
transients, five of the seven murders were committed by transients on 
transients, and eight of the 18 rapes were perpetrated by transients." 
</P>
<P>
The business community, working through the Chamber of Commerce, demanded city 
action on the homeless problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor admitted we have a problem, and concrete action like forbidding 
panhandling and stepping up security in the parking structures has started," 
said chamber President Duane Nightingale. "We'll always help people -- but we 
want them off the streets at night." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the homeless problem, Nightingale said business is booming, even 
though small retailers and workers cannot afford to live in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to lure large businesses to center here," he said. "That was 
one of the reasons why my company, GTE, left town." 
</P>
<P>
The business boom, according to Nightingale, is coming from the trend of more 
attorneys, doctors, dentists and other health professionals setting up their 
offices in the city. The medical field and its associated businesses make up 
the No. 1 work population in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Shelly Roth, a chiropractor, and her husband, John Kaufman, commercial real 
estate broker, both work in the city. They bought their home in the Ocean Park 
area 10 years ago. Their 1,400-square-foot house was recently enlarged to 2,600 
square feet. Roth values it at more than $1 million, 10 times the original 
purchase price. If they sell, they'll stay in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Quieter There' 
</P>
<P>
"When we moved in, John wanted to remodel immediately, but I wanted to move 
eventually, if the house became too small for us," Roth said. "Now he wants to 
move and I want to stay in the neighborhood. If we move, we want to start from 
scratch and remodel a house north of Montana. It's quieter up there and 
(there's) less traffic, but the advantage of living here is the young children. 
But we haven't decided yet." 
</P>
<P>
Ocean Park has pockets of single-family homes, but according to Erickson, none 
has sold for a million dollars. A high-quality duplex on 3rd Street, with a 
second-floor view of the ocean sold for $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the Main Street area, south to the ocean, there's a low turnover for the 
wood-frame houses whose deceiving exteriors conceal modern, artistic interiors. 
Many of them are beach house rentals -- bringing in sizable rents, since they 
are not under rent control. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean Park still has the last piece of affordable housing in the city, 
according to Felicia Allen of Jon Richards Co. She can get you into a 
two-bedroom one-bath dwelling for $269,000. It's half of a duplex, and it's the 
cheapest property in Santa Monica. For $269,500 you can get a one-bedroom, 
one-bath house. 
</P>
<P>
The Ocean Park area has a well-organized neighborhood association, one of three 
associations that receive support from the city-sponsored Santa Monica 
Neighborhood Support Center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Airport Project Protest 
</P>
<P>
Members are firm about maintaining their neighborhood's quality of life. 
Recently, 700 people attended a hearing to protest a development project at the 
Santa Monica airport. Traffic and noise were the key issues. City officials 
expect marathon meetings as they get closer to making the final decision. 
</P>
<P>
What may be the unifying thread for all Santa Monicans -- politician or 
resident -- is the concern for the quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Scholl, general manager of the city of Santa Monica, considers the city to 
be in the environmental vanguard. 
</P>
<P>
"We started a recycling program 11 years ago," he said. "We started the pilot 
program for treated storm drain water. We're going to require sampling for 
toxic chemicals from 1,118 of our 15,000 businesses." 
</P>
<P>
The city, at no cost to residents, retrofitted one-quarter of the city's 
households with water-heater blankets as well as requiring ultra-low-flow 
plumbing fixtures. "We also have our own hydroelectric power plant, which 
creates less pollution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of families being priced out of the housing market, the Santa 
Monica Malibu school district has suffered from eight years of declining 
enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
School Enrollment 
</P>
<P>
To counter the problem, school officials created a plan that allows people 
working in the city to enroll their children in the schools if they retained 
child care in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Dane Woll, associate general director of the 2,800-member YMCA, and the city's 
largest child-care provider, lives in Westchester but sends his daughter Katie 
to the Roosevelt School -- north of Montana. 
</P>
<P>
"There are about 300 non-resident kids who are currently in the school system," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica residents want to protect their small-town life style. As new 
resident Caroline Carroll said, "It's the atmosphere -- maybe it's a false 
sense -- but it feels real open. It's more than living in a house; we are 
living in a neighborhood. I would hate to see it overwhelmed."

GOVERNMENT GAIN

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dennis Sundstrom's Speaking Out was interesting as far as it went. However, his 
credibility might be suspect if all of his comments are as incomplete as his 
statement on the Mello-Roos Act. 
</P>
<P>
For example, it is true that the Mello-Roos Act requires a two-thirds vote. But 
in most cases where it has been used, the developer files an application with 
the county under the act and since he owns all the land, he has three-thirds of 
the vote! It is my understanding that where Mello-Roos has been put to a vote 
of the people, it has been voted down. 
</P>
<P>
I have found that after discussions with representatives of developers/builders 
and two different county assessor offices, where Mello-Roos does apply and thus 
the various facilities mentioned by Sundstrom are financed via bonds rather 
than by the price to the home buyer, there is no one who can verify that the 
price of the house is less than it would have been without application of the 
act. The word is that once Mello-Roos applies, this latter aspect will be 
"monitored by the market." 
</P>
<P>
Sundstrom's article asks who's to blame for high housing prices. Of course, he 
is a developer and he wrote the article as chairman of a nonprofit organization 
of the real estate industry, set up to educate the public. Education should 
include all aspects of a subject. Do we always have to have the fox tell us how 
many chickens are in the henhouse? Maybe we need a HUD-type audit of the entire 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Why no comment on builders who allocate a number of new houses to their 
employees, who may well be in the speculation business? 
</P>
<P>
Why no comment on speculators as contributors to the new-house price? 
</P>
<P>
Why no comment on builders who increase the price of new houses with each 
release of each new phase, even where releases are but a few weeks apart, when 
the land has been owned for some time, the facilities ae in (or at least the 
costs are included)? 
</P>
<P>
I know, free enterprise! But don't put all the blame on taxes. (Proposition 13, 
developer fees, etc.) 
</P>
<P>
Rather than beat this badly maimed horse, I'd ask this question: Is the house 
to which Sundstrom would apply Mello-Roos going to be cheaper to the consumer 
than the house where the "developer is charged for" such facilities (though we 
realize the cost is in the price of the house to the consumer)? If not, why is 
this mentioned as a big factor in the cost of housing?

YOUR MORTGAGE; 
</P>
<P>
HOW TO RESTRUCTURE MORTGAGE INTO THE EQUIVALENT OF A BIWEEKLY LOAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: What do you think of biweekly mortgages? I have been approached by a 
loan agent who, for a fee, will restructure my home mortgage into a biweekly 
loan. She claims I can thereby cut the loan down from 30 to 20 years and save 
thousands of dollars. What do you think? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: You can accomplish the same result on your own. Biweekly mortgages are 
the equivalent of 13 instead of 12 monthly payments every year. Another way of 
looking at the situation is to take your monthly payment, divide it by two, and 
make loan payments every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The secret for a successful biweekly mortgage is the lender must be given 
authority to withdraw funds automatically every two weeks from your checking or 
savings account. 
</P>
<P>
But you can accomplish the same result by making the equivalent of an extra 
monthly payment every year. For example, suppose your monthly mortgage payment 
is $1,200. Just add one-twelfth of the payment, $100 in this example, to your 
regular monthly payment and instruct the lender to apply the extra amount to 
pay down the principal balance. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the year you will have made the equivalent of 13 payments instead 
of 12. And you will accomplish the same result as a biweekly mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Worry if Your Lender Sells Mortgage 
</P>
<P>
Q: My mortgage lender recently sold my loan to an investment company. If they 
go bankrupt, what happens? 
</P>
<P>
A: The sale of mortgages and the loan servicing is a multibillion-dollar 
business. When your home loan was sold it became an asset of the new mortgage 
company. If they go bankrupt, your mortgage is one of their assets in 
bankruptcy. You would be notified to make your mortgage payments to the 
bankruptcy trustee. 
</P>
<P>
If you're concerned about making loan payments to an insolvent S&amp;L, don't 
worry. People make loan payments to several insolvent Texas S&amp;Ls and there 
is no change in their loan servicing. Should your new lender close its doors, 
your loan will be sold to another lender. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you were hoping that you might get out of paying your mortgage, 
forget it. You still owe the loan balance but the lender cannot accelerate your 
payments due. If you need more information, please consult a real estate 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How Deed of Trust and Mortgage Differ 
</P>
<P>
Q: You often refer to "mortgages," but our house has a "deed of trust" to the 
bank that loaned us the money to buy our home. What is the difference? 
</P>
<P>
A: Mortgages are referred to because everyone understands that security device 
concept. There are only two parties to a mortgage. The lender is called the 
mortgagee and the borrower is called the mortgagor. If the borrower doesn't 
make the monthly payments, the lender forecloses and the borrower loses the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
However, lenders prefer deeds of trust in states that permit them. There are 
three parties to a deed of trust. 
</P>
<P>
The borrower is called the trustor. The lender is the beneficiary. But the 
third party is the trustee who, theoretically, holds "bare, naked legal title." 
</P>
<P>
However, the trustee has nothing to do until either the loan is paid off (when 
a deed of reconveyance is recorded by the trustee), or the borrower defaults 
and the trustee handles the foreclosure. Lenders prefer deeds of trust because 
foreclosure does not involve court delays and can be completed much faster than 
with a mortgage which usually involves a judicial sale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disadvantages of Paying Mortgage Early 
</P>
<P>
Q: I disagree with your recent advice to that homeowner who is paying $50 extra 
each month on his mortgage payment. You even suggested he increase his extra 
payment to $100 per month to save thousands of dollars of interest by cutting 
his mortgage term. That is correct. 
</P>
<P>
But you conveniently overlooked the extra income taxes he will pay since his 
interest deduction will decline each year and if he should want to sell the 
house, homes with large mortgages sell easily, whereas homes with small loans 
and big equities are the most difficult to sell. Your comments please. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your suggestions are very valid, but the benefits of paying off the mortgage 
rapidly outweigh the disadvantages you list. As for the income tax savings from 
the interest deduction, it doesn't make much sense to pay $1 of interest to get 
28 cents of federal tax savings. 
</P>
<P>
Saving the interest is more profitable than saving income tax dollars. But when 
an owner expects to sell the home within a few years, I agree prepaying the 
mortgage is not a great idea since homes with big mortgages usually sell faster 
than those with small mortgages and large equities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Why Some Rates Go Up While Others Drop 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have an adjustable-rate mortgage at 10.6% interest. It is tied to the Cost 
of Funds Index. Do you think I should refinance now to get a fixed-rate 
mortgage? Why is my adjustable-rate mortgage's interest rate rising although I 
hear mortgage interest rates are falling? 
</P>
<P>
A: The general rule is it pays to refinance if you can reduce the mortgage 
interest rate at least 2% and pay for the refinance costs from mortgage payment 
savings within three years. Of course, this "two and three rule" has 
exceptions, such as if you need to take out tax-free cash or you would sleep 
better with a fixed rate mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons interest rates on most adjustable-rate mortgages are rising are 
many ARMs have maximum annual interest rate increase "caps" and the loan has 
unused increases that the lender can use before dropping the interest rate if 
the index declines and the Cost of Funds Index lags money market rates and is 
still increasing although general money market rates are falling. 
</P>
<P>
When interest rates rose, ARM borrowers didn't complain about the delay in 
increasing their payments. But since interest rates dropped, ARM borrowers are 
complaining that their interest rates haven't fallen. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of this mixed-up situation, mortgage lenders are originating mostly 
fixed-rate mortgages rather than ARMs. Currently, there isn't much saving for 
getting a new ARM, so most borrowers are taking the fixed-rate mortgages. But 
in your situation you won't save much interest and will incur refinance costs 
so I suggest you keep your ARM unless interest rates drop substantially.A 
Question That Has No Answer 
</P>
<P>
Q: I understand that if I buy a home, I can deduct the interest and loan fee on 
an "acquisition mortgage" used to buy the home. I have also been told that if I 
pay cash for the house but later change my mind, I have up to 90 days to obtain 
an acquisition mortgage. However, can I also deduct the loan fees "up front" or 
must I amortize them over the life of the mortgage? 
</P>
<P>
A: My tax consultants tell me they don't know the answer, either. You are 
correct that the mortgage interest on an acquisition mortgage, which is defined 
as a home loan secured by your principal residence and obtained within 90 days 
of receiving title to the property, is fully tax deductible. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is unclear if the loan fee paid to obtain such a mortgage is fully 
deductible in the year of obtaining the loan. Since this is a gray area of tax 
law, if you are an aggressive taxpayer you will fully deduct the loan fee in 
the year of obtaining the mortgage and hope you are not challenged by an IRS 
auditor. If you are a cautious taxpayer, then you will deduct the loan fee over 
the life of the mortgage. Please consult your tax adviser for full details.

BUILDING INDUSTRY SHOW, SEMINARS TO EXAMINE 'CRITICAL ISSUES OF '90S' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A November ballot measure that would increase the gas tax to finance 
improvements in the state's transportation system will be the topic of one of 
more than 30 seminars at a Southern California building industry trade show 
Nov. 9-11 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Transportation is an issue on almost every Southern California real estate 
project today," said Los Angeles attorney Phil Nicholson, moderator of the 
seminar titled "Critical Issues of the '90s." "This bill contemplates 
(generating) billions of dollars to improve the transportation system, which 
frustrates everybody." 
</P>
<P>
The seminar, open to anyone in the building trades, will explore such proposed 
solutions to the transportation problem as toll roads, which could be built and 
operated by private industry; computerization of signalization to speed traffic 
and move drivers off freeways and onto surface streets; staggered work hours, 
and extended efforts to keep trucks off the streets at certain times. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson views transportation as "the big issue of the '90s," but his panel 
also will focus on water, air quality and endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
"The kangaroo rat is a good example of the endangered species problem, which is 
having a major impact on real estate projects in Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"People are trying to save substantial amounts of acreage for the kangaroo rat, 
and this is competing with the public's desire for housing and the developer's 
ability to meet this need. If we don't build houses close in because the land 
is set aside for the kangaroo rat, we'll have to build further and further out, 
and then people will have commuting problems." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preferences of Asian Buyer 
</P>
<P>
In another seminar, special housing desires of Asian home buyers will be 
addressed. 
</P>
<P>
"If a house is already under construction, it's too late (to satisfy these 
desires)," said Harry Lorber, who is coordinating the panel for moderator Roger 
Werbel, a Monterey Park home builder. 
</P>
<P>
"Southern California is seeing growing numbers of Pacific Rim buyers, and some 
won't buy if the doors are placed in the wrong place or the houses face a 
certain direction." 
</P>
<P>
Some Asians are believers in a Chinese mystical craft called feng shui, which 
teaches that these and other architectural features can determine whether a 
house will be affected by good or bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
"The Asian Buyer" and other seminars were conceived to provide information on 
what Roy Humphreys, a Walnut builder and chairman of the event, terms "Southern 
California's special problems and opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Coast Builders Conference, an annual builders' event, has been held 
in San Francisco by the California Building Industry Assn. for 31 years, but 
the Los Angeles exposition is the first regional show to be jointly sponsored 
by the Building Industry Assn. of Southern California and the National Assn. of 
Home Builders. The Los Angeles Times is the corporate sponsor of the show. 
</P>
<P>
An economic forecast seminar, Nov. 7 at the Disneyland Hotel and Nov. 9 at the 
Los Angeles Convention Center, is also planned as part of the show but for a 
separate fee of $195. 
</P>
<P>
The forecast, focusing on economic trends for the '90s, is co-sponsored by the 
BIA/SC, UCLA John E. Anderson Graduate School of Management, Center for Finance 
and Real Estate, and the USC Law Center and Property Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Admittance to the other seminars is $90 for BIA members, $115 for others in the 
building industry. 
</P>
<P>
A $10 fee will gain entry to 24,000 square feet of exhibits featuring the 
building products and services of more than 150 companies. The exhibit hall, at 
the Convention Center, will be open Nov. 10 from 11 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., and Nov. 
11 from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
More details are available from the Building Industry Assn. of Southern 
California at 1571 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles.

SPEAKING OUT: CRA'S FEE BODES ILL FOR HEALTHY DOWNTOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN C. CUSHMAN III, Cushman is president and chief executive officer of 
Cushman Realty Corp., a downtown commercial real estate company. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The greater Los Angeles area has enjoyed extraordinary prosperity over the last 
25 years, but we are now paying the price for that prosperity. The phenomenal 
growth has brought serious problems, including traffic congestion, lack of 
affordable housing, poor air and water quality, inadequate waste management 
facilities, homelessness and crime. 
</P>
<P>
Given the demographic projections, it is clear that we cannot stop this growth; 
the challenge is to effectively manage it. Notwithstanding the significant 
commitments made by many organizations, the region is making little progress 
toward resolving its ills, and solutions will not be forthcoming if we depend 
solely on government, which, to a great extent, has been reactive and 
ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
Solutions can only be achieved if we change the process in a fundamental way. 
There needs to be a private-public partnership, driven by a massive commitment 
of the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
It is critical that the business community guide the long-term planning of 
downtown, committing the best of its leaders to take a hands-on role in 
formulating a process that can afford future generations a chance to enjoy the 
prosperity that we have enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the solution to the environmental and transportation problems facing 
Los Angeles will involve levying fees and exactions on developers of new 
downtown office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Developer Assessments 
</P>
<P>
A developer of an office building in the central business district in the 1990s 
will have to budget for such fees, costs and assessments as: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The proposed affordable-housing linkage fees, which will range from $2.50 
to $7.50 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The public art fee, equal to 1% of total project cost, which on a project 
of $300 dollars per square foot would equate to $3 dollars per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The South Park Open Space assessment, affecting developments south of 8th 
Street, which could be as much as 20 cents per square foot per year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Metro Rail benefit assessment payments, which could be as much as 40 
cents per square foot per year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The peripheral parking program, which includes the cost associated with 
purchasing land and the related costs of developing and operating an off-site 
parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
I am a strong supporter of the development of affordable housing, the 
improvement of our transportation systems and the inclusion of open space and 
public art in downtown development projects. I also feel that the development 
community should bear some of the cost associated with instituting such 
programs as contemplated above. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Density Transfer Fees 
</P>
<P>
However, I take strong exception to the structure of a recent proposal by the 
Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) to levy a public-benefit 
payment (PBP) on downtown developers who elect to transfer density rights, also 
known as floor-area ratio (FAR). 
</P>
<P>
It is important to state that much of the property in the central core of 
downtown Los Angeles has an "as of right" zoning density, or FAR, of 6 to 1. 
This means that a 100,000-square-foot parcel of land could be developed with a 
600,000-square-foot building. 
</P>
<P>
The TFAR (transfer floor-area ratio) policy provides the mechanism for a 
developer to transfer density from another parcel within the central core of 
downtown to his property. This enables a developer to increase the property's 
FAR to 10 to 1, allowing for the development of a 1-million-square-foot 
building on the 100,000-square-foot parcel. 
</P>
<P>
The public-benefit payment is envisioned to become part of the TFAR policy. I 
would contend that the PBP as proposed by the CRA is ill conceived, illogical 
and may possibly be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA proposal, if adopted, would require that a developer transferring FAR 
to his property pay a public benefit "tax" equal to 44% of the appraised land 
value of his property. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if a property with a FAR of 6 to 1 is valued at $1,000 per square 
foot of land, its value converts to about $167 per FAR square foot. The CRA is 
proposing that the benefit payment be 44% of $167, or about $73 dollars for 
each FAR square foot transferred. 
</P>
<P>
This public-benefit "tax" is in addition to the fee for actually transferring 
the FAR, which the CRA has already artificially inflated to a cost of $35 to 
$40 per FAR square foot. 
</P>
<P>
Developers have often transferred density to reduce the average land cost of a 
major office development. Private FAR transfer transactions have never exceeded 
$20 per FAR square foot and typically have been $15 per FAR square foot. 
</P>
<P>
The public-benefit payment bears no relationship to the public benefits and 
will dramatically increase the possibility that development in downtown Los 
Angeles will be significantly deterred. I would question whether the mayor, the 
City Council or the business community would find this acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
I am not against levying fees and exactions on developers for the benefit of 
the public if, in fact, those benefits are identified and quantified, and their 
relationship to the development project can be clearly established. In fact, 
these relationships and quantifications are required under California law. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the evolution of the 44% tax, it is my opinion that the CRA has 
given no consideration to the reasonable relationship between the tax and the 
cost of the proposed public benefits. 
</P>
<P>
What does this all mean, you may ask. 
</P>
<P>
Combining the public-benefit payment with all of the other development fees and 
exactions previously noted would have the impact of increasing the total cost 
of a new downtown office building by as much as 25%. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming a developer would proceed with a project given these burdensome fees, 
the cost will ultimately be paid by tenants who occupy the office buildings in 
the central business district. 
</P>
<P>
I can assure you that these businesses will soon conclude that it no longer 
makes sense to do business in downtown Los Angeles and will decide to relocate 
to other areas, including those outside of California, where the perception is 
that the local governments are sensitive to their concerns and are balanced in 
their thinking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Driving Away Business 
</P>
<P>
Left to their present course, the potential impact of the actions of bthe CRA 
will be to drive corporate America away from downtown Los Angeles. This 
threatens to destroy the heart of this great city, which is and should continue 
to be of major importance to the world's economy. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, the CRA has played a significant role in managing the growth and 
revitalization of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
However, the CRA has outlived its original mission of being responsible for the 
redevelopment project area of the downtown central business district. 
</P>
<P>
It is my opinion that the CRA has become a bloated and redundant organization. 
It has evolved into a jobs program whose officers are more concerned about 
preserving and expanding their payroll than they are about improving the 
quality of life in downtown Los Angeles. The CRA has so many layers of 
bureaucracy that it is no longer the effective planning tool that it may once 
have been. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA has created a slow-growth and possibly even a no-growth climate in 
downtown Los Angeles. This is apparent when one looks at the results. Not one 
project involving the transfer of development rights has been approved in 
downtown since the Ahmanson/Home Savings Tower in June of 1986 -- almost 3 1/2 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
So what is the solution? 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, one solution would be to eliminate the CRA altogether, but short of 
taking such a drastic measure, I think the CRA should redefine its goals and 
objectives and downsize itself to reduce its bureaucratic inefficiency. In this 
way the CRA could be more responsive to the needs of the community with a 
clearly defined mission statement. 
</P>
<P>
The private and public sectors also must join together to create a strategic 
plan for the future of downtown Los Angeles. A similar process was undertaken 
many years ago, spearheaded by Al Martin of Albert C. Martin &amp; Associates, 
the prominent architectural firm. 
</P>
<P>
This privately funded effort, conducted in conjunction with the public sector, 
proved to be instrumental in planning the development of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
It is welcome news to hear that a new downtown strategic plan advisory group 
has been created, because allowing the CRA to hold the pen of a downtown 
strategic plan might very well force our major employers to abandon the city to 
areas that send a clear signal that they want to attract and maintain a vibrant 
business environment.

HARARE, Zimbabwe 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of granite monoliths and towering walls often referred to as "Africa's 
greatest mystery" lie half-buried 200 miles southeast of this capital city. 
</P>
<P>
What the Great Pyramids are to Egypt, Great Zimbabwe is to Zimbabwe -- an 
enduring reminder of a civilization long gone. 
</P>
<P>
Covering 1,780 acres, this national monument is three groups of stone 
structures: the Hill Complex, the Great Enclosure or Great House and the Valley 
Complex. 
</P>
<P>
Evolving from a small settlement, Great Zimbabwe flourished under the Shona and 
Karanga civilizations between the 13th and 15th centuries. 
</P>
<P>
It was ruled by a succession of kings whose influence spread throughout what is 
now Zimbabwe. Its growth was stimulated by the gold trade, and gold mining and 
smelting operations were among its main occupations. 
</P>
<P>
On the edge of a 300-foot granite cliff, the Hill Complex, the oldest section, 
was the home of kings. The ridge is occupied by several small enclosures that 
were used for rituals. 
</P>
<P>
The Great Zimbabwe soapstone birds, artistic symbols of the country's past, 
were discovered in one ritual enclosure. The birds are now on Zimbabwe's flag 
and currency and on the crest of the nation's coat of arms. 
</P>
<P>
In a valley at the southern foot of the hill is the Great Enclosure, the 
largest and best preserved of Great Zimbabwe's ruins. 
</P>
<P>
This was the home of the king's wives. Built after the Hill Complex, its 
massive outer wall is 36 feet high and 800 feet in circumference. It contains 
nearly 60,000 cubic feet of stonework. 
</P>
<P>
A chevron design along the top of the Great Enclosure's wall is of the type 
found in other African countries. It is believed to represent the snake of 
fertility that promises a continuing line of descendants. 
</P>
<P>
The Great Enclosure's impressive conical tower was thought to have been built 
at the same time as the outer wall. It is also 36 feet high and has a 
circumference of 56 feet at its base. 
</P>
<P>
The builders of Great Zimbabwe left no records of their activities, so the 
function of the tower remains open to conjecture. 
</P>
<P>
Stretching across the valley are the remains of the dry-stone enclosures that 
make up the Valley Complex. Numerous relics have been uncovered there, and 
archeologists believe that dignitaries of the king's court lived in the 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
Before exploring the three ruins, visit the site museum, which contains a 
display of artifacts, including the Great Zimbabwe birds. The museum hours are 
8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The entire national monument closes at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Lodging and camping accommodations are available a short distance from the 
monument at Masvingo and at the Lake Kyle recreation park. 
</P>
<P>
Eastward, near Bulawayo, stands the nation's second-largest archeological find, 
the Khami ruins. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese porcelain of the Wan-Li period (1573-1619), found in the stonework, is 
believed to have reached Khami with early Portuguese explorers or traders. 
</P>
<P>
But it is Great Zimbabwe that remains the most spectacular of Southern Africa's 
ancient ruins. 
</P>
<P>

ON A TOUR THROUGH HUNGARY'S OUTLAW COUNTRY

Vienna.

DEBRECEN, Hungary 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's called the puszta (great plain), a giant lowland that covers about 20,000 
square miles. It's the largest plain in Europe, and you can view its most 
interesting regions from a tour bus on a six-hour journey through the flat, 
treeless landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Your puszta tour into eastern Hungary, organized by the government tourist 
bureau Ibusz, goes into an area of former outlaws, runaway serfs, clans of 
once-hostile Gypsies and roving packs of wolves. 
</P>
<P>
The puszta is where the powerful plum brandy was created, and where you are 
likely to be served a jigger of the potent stuff when you lunch at a czarda 
(rustic restaurant). 
</P>
<P>
At one tour stop you'll see a rousing horse-racing demonstration by Hungary's 
bareback riders, the czikos, who perform spectacularly in their soup-bowl 
turbans and flowing black pantaloons. 
</P>
<P>
Cracking long whips, these Gypsy horsemen -- the cowboys of the puszta -- stand 
astride two stallions, while controlling a team of five speeding horses with a 
set of reins. 
</P>
<P>
The rider raises his whip and snaps it full length over the heads of the 
horses, which tear past at great speed. Many consider this the most dangerous 
horseback ride anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Another place the tour visits is Kalocsa, a two-street town that is on the map 
only for its famous "Painting Women." These ladies made their mark in Hungary's 
history by specializing in flowery murals and Kalocsa embroidery. 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs in the Karoly Viski Museum is an array of overstuffed bolsters and 
quilts, at one time mandatory for a bride's dowry. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is the passion for floral motifs evident here, but it also appears at 
the Folk Art Museum. Even the walls of the Kalocsa railroad station are covered 
with this art form. 
</P>
<P>
Straddling the Tisza River, which cuts the puszta into two equal parts, is the 
town of Szeged, where the goddess-worshiping Koros culture had its heyday about 
4,000 years ago and where prosperity came after AD 1225, because of the royal 
salt monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
When a devastating flood in March, 1879, washed away all but 300 homes, Szeged 
started over again. Today the town has 180,000 people and a downtown that has a 
pleasing, albeit eclectic, architectural style. 
</P>
<P>
Szeged's big tourist attraction, which dates to 1913, is its open-air theater 
festival during July and August. The annual event, featuring opera and drama, 
is held on a 600-square yard stage in Dom Square, which can hold an audience of 
7,000. 
</P>
<P>
Tours to this least-frequented region of Hungary can be booked in Budapest or 
Debrecen, the capital of the puszta about 150 miles east of Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
West of the city is the Hortobagy, the most romantic region of the great plain. 
There birdlife and wildlife abound, including herds of wild horses. There the 
real character of the puszta has been preserved in tiny villages.

FOOTLOOSE: BODRUM IS PLACE TO BE ON AEGEAN

BODRUM, Turkey 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 15th-Century crusaders' castle crowns a hill beside the blue harbor here, but 
down below a crusade of a different sort has been going on for years. 
</P>
<P>
The latest wave of faithful is secular and consists in the main of young people 
who have made this their beachside capital on the Aegean Sea, getting up just 
in time for an afternoon of sun followed by an evening of cafe hopping until 
dawn. 
</P>
<P>
So popular has this town of 13,000 become that its population rises to about 
100,000 between April and November. New construction to accommodate tourists 
has been so frantic that the recently elected mayor ran on a sole platform of 
"no more building" during his five-year term. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being one of the prettiest and liveliest resort towns on the 
Aegean today, Bodrum has a modicum of antiquities and ruins to interest those 
seeking to combine a seaside holiday with a bit of history. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Take British Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, Pan Am or SAS to Istanbul, 
then Turkish Airways to Izmir. From there it's half a day bus ride to Bodrum, 
but many visitors sail in with a cruise line, Turkish ferry or the increasingly 
popular gulet, a private-hire sailing vessel right out of the Middle Ages. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? A day will do for the sights of Bodrum, but many linger on 
for a week or more. Costs for accommodations from moderate downward, with 
superb Turkish food for a pittance. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: The Turkish lira recently sold for 2,200 to the dollar, about 
.00045 each. Visit any time between April and November, but between July and 
September the town is crowded with Europeans and the harbor is choked with 
yachts and gulets. Taxis are cheap, dolmus (communal cabs) even cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
Settling in: Hotel Ayaz (Gumbet Bay; $42 U.S. double, half-pension) is owned by 
Huseyin Ayaz, whose family has held land in these parts for 400 years. It has 
its own beach with a fine pool, gardens, lively beachside bar and every 
possible water sport. 
</P>
<P>
Bedrooms of moderate size have private balconies and contemporary furnishings. 
A big plus for the Ayaz is its site on a bay behind the main harbor, away from 
the noise and bustle of town. And the owner has a six-cabin gulet with all the 
amenities of a yacht, just in case you'd like a cruise down the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Otel Park Palas (Gumbet Bay; $40 double, half-pension) is next door to the Ayaz 
and duplicates most of its virtues. 
</P>
<P>
The beachside garden is a cool haven of green lawn, banana and eucalyptus 
trees, and bowers of flowers. The gigantic pool sits beside an awning-covered 
terrace restaurant and American bar. There's a very friendly owner here who 
grows tomatoes, eggplant and herbs in his garden for the dining room. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Serthan (Gumbet Road; $39 double, half-pension) is a small and sparkling 
white place of local architecture that's perfect for families, many of which 
seem to come back yearly to go fishing with the owner. 
</P>
<P>
Only 31 rooms, it's built around the pool and is only a two-minute walk from 
the beach. Bedrooms are simple but beautiful, with balconies spilling 
bougainvillea. The pension meals are excellent. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: All along this coast you'll find plenty of fresh 
seafood, but it's usually about twice the price of meat and vegetable dishes. 
Look for fresh sardines, anchovies, swordfish, sea bass, red mullet and bream, 
plus whatever is running at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Two things that caught our fancy fast were ezo gelin, a lentil and rice soup 
spiced with tomato, mint and red peppers, and midya dolmasi, a cold meze (hors 
d'oeuvre) of mussels in their shells and stuffed with rice and pine nuts. The 
last was probably the best dish of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Another meze you'll enjoy is the patlican salatasi, a heavenly paste of 
eggplant pureed with yogurt, which you dip onto pide (pita) bread. Mezes go 
well with raki (anise liqueur) or ayran, yogurt mixed with water, a Turkish 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: Restaurant Han (just off the main shopping street) is built around 
a tree-shaded courtyard, its walls lined with colorful carpets. You dine at 
communal tables on kebabs, kofte (spicy lamb patties) and fresh prawns. The 
most expensive thing on the menu is $6.50. Evenings are festive, with Turkish 
folk dancers and the ever-present belly dancer gyrating away. 
</P>
<P>
Amphora (on the quay at the edge of town) is a pretty place where you may dine 
indoors or on a cool terrace rimmed with potted oleanders. A broad menu gives 
you a choice of 20 mezes, two dozen kinds of skewered meats and several koftes. 
Again, you'll find carpets decorating the floors and stuccoed walls. 
</P>
<P>
Eren (near the main square on the quay) is entirely open, with rustic tables 
and a menu of no-frills Turkish specialties. A lamb brochette goes for $2.25, 
fresh sea bream for $6.50. There are half a dozen similar cafe-restaurants 
along this front, so pick and choose. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: When it's lighted at night, the new Club M (on the hill near 
town; $75 to $120 double, half-pension) rivals the crusaders' castle as a local 
focal point. It's a huge place, airy and beautiful, with individual cottages on 
a hill leading down from the main building to the two pools and marina. 
</P>
<P>
Two restaurants, a beach club, fresh and saltwater pools, Turkish baths, a 
shopping arcade and casino. Meals are four-course affairs, or an open buffet of 
continental and Turkish dishes. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Start with the 15th-Century Castle of St. Peter, built by the 
Knights of St. John. The castle houses a museum that is worth the stop in 
Bodrum: Mycenaean pottery and jewelry from the 14th Century, silver coins from 
the 6th Century BC (coinage was started on this coast) and underwater relics 
recovered from shipwrecks that occurred 1,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bodrum is the Aegean Coast capital of boating, and the "blue journey" of 
coastal cruising is a popular pastime. A short trek inland takes you to Milas, 
where a cottage industry turns out fine Turkish carpets by hand. 
</P>
<P>
Ruins hopping: Izmir has the only large airport with regular service on this 
coast, so the logistics of getting from one remote town to another presents a 
problem. A tour or cruise company can help you get more from your visit here, 
particularly in understanding the history and archeology of southern Anatolia. 
</P>
<P>

(212) 687-2194, or write (821 United Nations Plaza, New York 10017) for a 
brochure on Bodrum and other towns on the coast, plus a travel guide to Turkey 
that includes hotel listings.

LOCATE THE FRUITCAKE AND YOU GET A LONE STAR

<P>
What I've come to call the "Great Texas Fruitcake Run" began with a simple 
request from my wife: "Don't forget the fruitcake." 
</P>
<P>
She's a fruitcake devotee and the Deluxe brand fruitcake from the Collin Street 
Bakery in Corsicana, Tex., is one of her favorites. 
</P>
<P>
It's a favorite with gift-givers the world over, although nobody has done a 
poll to find out if anyone actually eats a fruitcake. 
</P>
<P>
The fruitcake run began in Austin, Tex., where I was visiting friends and 
lending moral support to a friend from Los Angeles seeking a job in Austin. On 
the last full day of our visit to Austin, we decided to make a run for the 
fruitcake. 
</P>
<P>
Corsicana is about 180 miles northeast of Austin, but everyone assured me that 
Texas highways are much less crowded than roads back home in California. 
Because my job-seeking friend had lived and worked in Houston for five years, I 
deferred to his greater knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Austin has 500,000 residents, is the state capital and is the home of the 
University of Texas, but it has a livable feeling of a smaller town, like, say, 
Madison, Wis., or Eugene, Ore. It's a delightful city. 
</P>
<P>
Boasting a chain of lakes formed by damming the Colorado River, the city has so 
many trees that a drive through Austin on the elevated portions of Interstate 
35 is like a trip through a forest preserve. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Sixth Street 
</P>
<P>
The state capitol, constructed of pink granite quarried in the Hill Country 
west of Austin, is the largest in the nation, second in size only to the U.S. 
Capitol in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
A popular attraction for tourists and locals alike is Sixth Street in downtown 
Austin. It's the Melrose Avenue of Austin, with trendy shops and restaurants 
and the restored Driskill Hotel, the oldest hotel in town. 
</P>
<P>
My friend spread the map of Texas out on his bed in his motel room and sketched 
out a route that would take us away from the heavily traveled interstates to 
the "real" Texas of the state highways and the farm/market roads. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Corsicana, I wanted to see Waxahachie because of its historic 
homes and massive Ellis County courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
I like a bite of fruitcake now and then, to be sure, but what I really love is 
to photograph the magnificent county courthouses of the Midwest and South. From 
the pictures in the Texas travel guide, the Ellis County courthouse was a must. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, the 248-page book "Texas State Travel Guide" is available free from 
the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation, Travel and 
Information Division, P.O. Box 5064, Austin 78763-5064. Ask for a free state 
map when you order the guide. 
</P>
<P>
The route my friend sketched out deliberately omitted big cities. I've been to 
Dallas, Ft. Worth and Houston several times, but I wanted to see the 
countryside on this trip. I did have a moment's pause when he eliminated Waco 
from the itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lots of Dams 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like Waco because of its wacky name," he said. I said that the 
airplane is pronounced Wacko and the city is pronounced Wayco. I added that 
Waco appeared to be a pretty city about the size of Burbank on a lake formed by 
damming the Brazos River (dams are big business in Texas, which has 5,000 or so 
square miles of artificial lakes). 
</P>
<P>
"We'll see the Brazos on the way back to Austin," he said. "Trust me." 
</P>
<P>
I'm a "let's get going" kind of guy and my friend is a world-class 
procrastinator, so I decided to stick with his route. 
</P>
<P>
I slipped on my newly acquired Tony Lama Roper cowboy boots, grabbed my camera 
bag and hat and piled into our rental car, the Butter Beagle. I'm not making 
this up; that was the name of the car typed on the key ring from Rent-A-Wreck. 
Yes, this California institution has two franchises in Austin, renting cars for 
$19.95 a day. 
</P>
<P>
A 1981 Buick Regal with more than 122,000 miles, the Butter Beagle never failed 
us on the trip, got reasonably good gas mileage and kept us fairly comfortable 
in 100-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
After missing the exit for unleaded gas at 82.9 cents a gallon in Austin, we 
gassed up at a convenience mart in Belton, south of Temple. Gas was 15 cents 
more a gallon, but we picked up containers of coffee and cans of pop and I used 
the cleanest restroom I've ever seen in a service station. 
</P>
<P>
Californians might be surprised to see a restroom in a convenience store, but 
Texans are generally friendly, practical people who don't expect tourists to 
deface toilets or use them for narcotic injections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trucks With Gun Racks 
</P>
<P>
We left the interstate at Eddy, taking Texas 7 east through Mooresville, 
Chilton and Marlin, on to Kosse at the junction of 7 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
The country reminded me of southern Wisconsin, with its rolling hills and 
uncrowded roads. A definitely un-Wisconsin touch was seeing pickup trucks with 
gun racks clearly visible in the rear windows. Often the racks contained rifles 
or shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
This part of Texas gets as much moisture as the Midwest, so the green of the 
countryside was not surprising. West Texas -- around Midland, El Paso and Del 
Rio -- is as parched as much of California and has a distinctly desert 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
From Kosse it was a straight shot up Texas 14 to Richland and only a few miles 
more to Corsicana. 
</P>
<P>
I kept expecting to see signs telling us of our progress to the town that 
fruitcake made famous, but all I saw were signs indicating the distance to 
something called the Bubba Barbecue Co. 
</P>
<P>
Because we'd enjoyed the best barbecue in Austin at the Iron Works, First 
Street and Red River Avenue, we decided to give Bubba a pass. Texans take their 
barbecue seriously and the Iron Works attracts a varied crowd of students from 
the University of Texas, downtown office workers and tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Once in Corsicana we had to ask a gas station attendant for directions to the 
bakery, which turned out to be crowded with tourists buying pecan pies, loaves 
of bread, rolls, lemon cake and even a few fruitcakes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mailed Post Cards 
</P>
<P>
The bakery is a busy place, but not too busy for the saleswomen to say hello 
and give directions to the restrooms and telephones inside the bakery. 
</P>
<P>
After taking pictures next to the plaque commemorating the bakery, mailing 
complimentary post cards (the bakery even provides the stamps), and with our 
fruitcake stowed in the car, we hit the road for Waxahachie. 
</P>
<P>
The city of 20,000 is the headquarters of the planned superconductor collider, 
an underground, 53-mile-long, high-energy physics device that has just been 
funded. 
</P>
<P>
Waxahachie is only 30 miles south of downtown Dallas. It boasts 20% of all the 
historically significant houses in Texas, a state of 16 million people. It's no 
wonder that Waxahachie has attracted hordes of yuppies, savvy buyers seeking 
huge old houses at bargain (compared to Dallas, at least) prices. 
</P>
<P>
Accustomed to paying $5 to $7 for a movie, the new residents were pleasantly 
surprised to see "Batman" playing at the Plaza Theater across from the 
courthouse at $2 a seat. 
</P>
<P>
The red sandstone and granite courthouse, complete with a memorial to the 
Confederate soldiers who fought during 1861-65, was not a disappointment. It 
cost $150,000 to build in 1895, when a dollar was worth something. The clock 
still works and keeps excellent time. 
</P>
<P>
If Waxahachie looks familiar, it's because the town has been used for movies 
such as "Tender Mercies" and "A Trip to Bountiful." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Launch Site 
</P>
<P>
I'm afraid the Ellis County courthouse ruined the others for me. The Bosque 
County courthouse in Meridian was a gray blob compared to Waxahachie's wonder, 
although it has its charms. The Travis County courthouse in Austin is not in 
the same league. 
</P>
<P>
As my friend promised, I saw the Brazos River, just past Rio Vista on Texas 
174. A sign indicated a turnoff to a public picnic area/boat launch site. About 
half a dozen cars, trucks and vans -- many with boat trailers -- were in the 
parking lot, and the river was a beautiful sight flowing through the gentle 
hill country. 
</P>
<P>
We got gas at the friendly FINA station in Belton, and were soon back in 
Austin. The trip totaled about 400 miles and was an easy, relaxing run on 
highways that were nearly empty -- except for the interstate stretches. 
</P>
<P>
There's an old saying about the immensity of Texas, a state with more highway 
miles than most large countries: 
</P>
<P>
The sun has riz, the sun has set, 
</P>
<P>
And we still is in Texas yet. 
</P>
<P>
That was probably meant to be a lament, but I found it a powerful incentive to 
plan another drive through the Texas countryside. 
</P>

KEEPING HEALTHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARL NEUMANN, Neumann is a Forest Hills, N.Y., pediatrician who writes on 
travel-related matters. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Air travel with a cold is generally safe -- if you can breathe through your 
nose and have no earache or sinus headache. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce discomfort and to prevent earaches, do the following: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Take a decongestant an hour before takeoff and, on long flights, every four 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chew gum during ascent and descent. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use a nasal spray. Use the spray 10 minutes before ascent and descent, and 
repeat every 10 minutes for no more than three doses. Repeat every four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never sleep during descent. Sleep decreases the frequency of swallowing, 
and swallowing helps maintain equal pressure between the inner ear and the 
outside. This helps avoid pain. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Avoid air travel for 24 hours after scuba diving. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Side Effects Sharper 
</P>
<P>
Decongestants can cause sleepiness, dizziness and inability to concentrate. 
Such side effects are more severe on airplanes than at sea level. Smoking, 
drinking and taking other medications intensifies these symptoms. Never drive a 
car immediately after flights on which you used a decongestant. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Minimize fatigue before flights. Get to the airport rested. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do not allow air travel to interfere with your eating schedule. The 
incidence of headaches increases when you fast more than five hours during the 
day and more than 13 hours overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Low oxygen and high carbon dioxide levels cause headaches. Ask flight 
attendants to turn up ventilation equipment. 
</P>
<P>
When your headache is associated with a hacking cough, the cause may be ozone 
in the cabin air. On some aircraft, ozone is sucked in through ventilation 
valves from the outside. It is most common on winter flights over the North 
Atlantic. To counteract, breathe through a wet towel for 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aspirin or Ice 
</P>
<P>
Treatments for headaches: Ask flight attendants for aspirin, acetaminophen 
(such as Tylenol or Anacin 3) or ibuprofen (Advil). Apply ice to your temples. 
If the headache is severe, ask for oxygen. Inhale slowly a few times. Prolonged 
breathing of oxygen will not give further relief. 
</P>
<P>
Analgesics and ice also relieve toothaches. Apply the ice to your cheek next to 
the tooth that hurts. 
</P>
<P>
When possible, avoid dental treatment just before air travel. This will prevent 
aerodontalgia, or fliers' toothache, pain resulting from atmospheric 
decompresssion. Air Force dentists recommend not flying for three days after 
extensive dental work. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Healthy newborns can fly as soon as they are released from the hospital. Low 
cabin oxygen presents no problem. 
</P>
<P>
Offer infants bottles of milk or water during ascent and descent to minimize 
ear problems. On long flights, offer bottles frequently to prevent dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
Children being treated for uncomplicated ear infections may fly once there is 
no longer any pain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Care With Hot Drinks 
</P>
<P>
Never hold hot drinks while holding a small child. Tell your seat companion to 
be careful. Sudden movements by children have resulted in drinks being spilled 
and burning children. Also, do not give children hard candies and lollipops 
during a flight. In case of turbulence, they can lodge in the throat. 
</P>
<P>
Some airlines insist that you strap small children into your seat belt, others 
say you must hold them on your lap without strapping them in. All agree that 
the safest method is an approved restraint device strapped into a separate 
seat. Some car seats are approved. 
</P>
<P>
Using a child's seat restraint costs an additional full fare or reduced child's 
fare. Generally, airlines do not provide the safety devices. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Three to four hours into a flight, air conditioning has removed practically all 
of the moisture from the cabin air. This dries out the surface of the eyes and 
causes a burning sensation. The dryness is especially troublesome to 
contact-lens wearers. 
</P>
<P>
Carry eye drops if you have sensitive eyes or if you wear contact lenses. Use 
the drops every few hours. Keep air-conditioning vents turned off or away from 
your face. 
</P>
<P>
If possible, do not wear your contact lenses on flights. And never remove or 
insert contacts during flight. Many travelers have lost their lenses that way.

BARGAIN CORNER: EURAILPASS INTRODUCES NEW PASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK ADLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eurailpass will introduce two new Flexipass tickets in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
One pass, $198, allows five days of rail travel within a 15-day period. You can 
also get a pass for $458 that permits 14 days of travel within a month. Travel 
doesn't have to be on consecutive days. 
</P>
<P>
Eurailpass also is continuing its existing Flexipass, which offers travel on 
nine of 21 days. Next year the pass will cost $360, up from $340. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prices Rise 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Eurailpass is continuing its various consecutive-day travel 
passes. The 15-day pass will cost $340 in 1990, up from $320, and the 21-day 
pass, $440, up from $398. 
</P>
<P>
Rates for a one-month pass will be $550 compared to $498 last year. And prices 
for the two- and three-month passes will be $750 and $930, up from $698 and 
$860, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The Eurail Saverpass, two or more people traveling together 15 consecutive 
days, costs $240 per person, up from $230. However, a minimum of three people 
will be required to get this pass during the period from April 1 to Sept. 30, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
The Eurail Youthpass, for people under 26 years and good for second-class 
passage, will cost $380 for one month and $500 for two months, up from $360 and 
$470, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Each Eurailpass is good for unlimited first-class (except for the Youthpass) 
train travel in 17 countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, West 
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, 
Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
The passes must be bought in the United States. All of the passes are good for 
six months from the date of purchase. If you plan to travel within Europe 
during the first half of 1990, buy the pass this year and save money. 
</P>
<P>
The passes represent one of the better values for traveling around Europe 
inexpensively and conveniently (train stations are usually central). The passes 
also offer such benefits as free or reduced fares on ferries, lake and river 
steamers, ships and buses. 
</P>
<P>
If you plan to spend much time in a single country, check on that country's 
rail passes. You may save. JACK ADLER

YOUTH BEAT: TAKE CARE WHEN EXCHANGING CASH; 
</P>
<P>
MONEY: TRAVELERS WHO EXCHANGE CURRENCY ILLEGALLY IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES LEAVE 
THEMSELVES OPEN TO FINES AND EVEN JAIL SENTENCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON, Izon is a Canadian travel journalist covering youth budget 
routes. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When trying to stretch your dollars in foreign countries, beware of attractive 
offers for "easy gains." They can lead to trouble. 
</P>
<P>
In "Work Your Way Around The World," by Susan Griffith (Writer's Digest Books, 
$12.95), a traveler visiting India reported that when he tried to exchange 
money at a higher rate than the banks were offering, he had an unnerving 
experience at a bazaar in Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
"After I had agreed to the favorable rate offered to me, I was grabbed by a 
plainclothes policeman while his accomplice grabbed the money changer, who was 
promptly allowed to go." 
</P>
<P>
The traveler thought he might have been set up. "I wasn't allowed to go until I 
paid an official 50-rupee fine, and I was afraid through my detention that the 
penalty would be more serious." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Repeatedly Approached 
</P>
<P>
Before arriving in a country, find out if there are restrictions on taking 
local currency into the country, on taking out that currency, and on exchanging 
at other than official services such as banks. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in both the Soviet Union and China I was approached repeatedly on 
the street by people who wanted to buy my dollars. In these countries it was 
because dollars or "hard currency" could be used to make purchases in special 
stores that stock luxury items not easily available to local citizens. 
</P>
<P>
However, you run the risk of getting caught, getting set up or simply getting 
taken. Travelers have sometimes found themselves with a few bills on top of a 
stack of useless paper, and in other cases with counterfeit funds. 
</P>
<P>
Find out if informal exchanges are illegal. Foreign citizens, also, are subject 
to the laws and penalties of the country they are in. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some ideas for protecting and stretching your funds: 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving home, transfer money into traveler's checks. The value of the 
checks will be replaced if they are lost or stolen -- providing you keep good 
records. You can buy the checks through banks. The fee is about 1%. 
</P>
<P>
When you buy your checks, ask for a list of refund offices. Make copies of your 
check numbers. Keep one set for your luggage, and leave the other with a friend 
or relatives at home. Record the numbers on the checks as you use them. 
</P>
<P>
If there are no restrictions on where you can exchange money, avoid hotels or 
restaurants. Shop around at banks and traveler's check companies for the best 
rates and lowest commission fees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arriving at Odd Hours 
</P>
<P>
Last year in Portugal I found that some banks were charging about $4 per 
transaction, no matter if the check was for $20 or $100. If commissions are 
hefty, cash enough to last for several days. 
</P>
<P>
Consider if you'll be arriving after business hours or on a weekend or holiday. 
If your arrival is at an odd hour, play it safe and buy some of the currency 
before you head for that destination. Airports and major rail stations have 
some sort of exchange service open at odd hours, though they may not offer as 
attractive a rate as the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Carry your cash, tickets, passport and traveler's checks in a money belt or in 
a neck pouch under your shirt. If you make it difficult to lift your money, 
chances are that a thief will pick on another tourist. 
</P>
<P>
If you are going to stay in youth hostels or student dormitory hotels, pack a 
padlock because some have lockers that you'll be able to use. If not, slip your 
money belt into your sleeping bag at night. You may trust your roomies, but 
that doesn't mean it's impossible for someone else to intrude. 
</P>
<P>
Each time you exchange money, you lose a little because of different buying and 
selling rates. So don't exchange more than you'll need. When it's time to 
leave, get rid of your coins; they won't be accepted once you cross the border, 
even at banks. 
</P>
<P>
If you are going to leave a country by plane, you might need some local 
currency to pay an airport departure tax. Prepare for it. You'll want to avoid 
exchanging a big check into local currency just before boarding the plane.

Eighty-eight years after its inaugural run, the Grand Canyon Railway once again 
is offering steam train service from Williams, Ariz., to the south rim of the 
Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The line, which began operation on Sept. 17, 1901, had closed in 1968, partly 
because of increased road travel to the south rim. Congestion and environmental 
concerns have prompted the reopening of the service, using four 1910-vintage 
steam locomotives and 19 restored coach cars from the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
The line will offer weekend trains through Nov. 5, with special holiday trips 
planned for Thanksgiving and New Year's. In 1990, daily passenger service 
starts April 1. The round-trip fare is $37 for adults, $21 for children under 
12. For more information, call toll-free (800) THE TRAIN.

I have developed a serious addiction, and this week was in danger of going into

his column was missing several weeks ago as well, I felt it warranted a

THE AMERICAN WEST: BUST, BOOM, HANG ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Stall, Bill Stall is a Times editorial writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lot of nonsense is being written these days about the American West. Recent 
magazine and newspaper accounts, now spreading to network television, portray a 
West mired in social despair, an economy gone bust with no new boom in site. 
The land is harsh. Small towns wither. Young people move away. The western myth 
has died. 
</P>
<P>
There is some truth there. But this is not new. Such comments overstate the 
case. They leave the impression of a sudden phenomenon. They make it appear the 
Plains states and the intermountain West are in terminal decline, leaving 
little reason for anyone to want to live there anymore. And they imply that the 
only difference between good times and bad is a little economic exploitation of 
the West's natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
"When oil was good, Wyoming was good," Newsweek observed in an article about 
"America's Outback" in its Oct. 9 edition. Yet when the oil business was 
booming in Wyoming -- and the coal business, too -- there was plenty that was 
exceedingly bad. The state sprouted dreary colonies of trailer houses; its 
schools and other public facilities were overwhelmed; there was alcoholism, 
mental illness and domestic violence -- and bitterness between those who got 
the money and those who did not. Most often, the best jobs went to outsiders 
who drifted on as soon as the boom faded. 
</P>
<P>
But western life never has been easy. There is never enough rainfall, except 
when there is too much, as when the hay has been cut and left in the field to 
dry, or when rain falls as hail and batters a good grain crop to nothing, or 
when a blizzard hits in the middle of lambing. From the beginning, ranching was 
a marginal operation. Businesses and towns perpetually struggle. Young people 
have always been lured out of state by better job opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
This new interest in the West seems to result in part from the success of books 
about the region in recent years, including Ian Frazier's current bestseller, 
"Great Plains," and poignant novels by Montanan Ivan Doig and Wyomingite Gretel 
Ehrlich. The last time the national media took such interest was during the 
energy boom of the 1970s when the so-called Overthrust Belt of the Rockies was 
the hot topic of petroleum clubs in Denver and Casper and when Wyoming was 
becoming the national leader in coal production. Those articles tended to focus 
on the burdens of success, not the benefits. The universal question was whether 
sudden prosperity and an influx of strangers, uncaring of western traditions, 
would alter the romantic life style of the rancher forever. 
</P>
<P>
More than just economics is being dredged up in the latest round of articles 
and essays. The theme suggests a dark side to the West marked by dreariness, 
bitterness, brutality and exhaustion. In examining the recent literature of the 
West, U.S. News &amp; World Report says, in an article entitled "Our Imaginary 
Plains," that the heroes of the late-20th Century are nothing like Zane Grey's 
lonesome cowboy. They turn out to be, after all, people pretty much like people 
anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Looking to the future, the Wall Street Journal quoted Frank and Deborah Popper 
of Rutgers University describing the Plains as "an austere monument to American 
self-delusion" centered on the concept that emigrants to the West could start a 
new life on 160 barren acres granted under the Homestead Act. The Poppers then 
indulge in a sentimental notion of their own: that as the Plains become 
depopulated, they be turned into a massive grasslands park inhabited by buffalo 
and other beasts. Newsweek romanticized the same theme by declaring that the 
promise of a century ago is dead in the six Western states celebrating their 
centennial years in 1989 and 1990, and that the West may return to what it once 
was: "Vast silent spaces where wild game stare at the passing horseman." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, 1889 was not so terrific. The brief age of the open cattle range in my 
home state of Wyoming ended in the terrible blizzards of the late 1880s. Soon 
after Wyoming joined the Union in 1890, the state's big ranchers, with tacit 
support from state government, hired a trainload of Texas gunmen to kill a 
score of small ranchers suspected of being rustlers (but the small ranchers 
surrounded the gunmen at the TA Ranch near Buffalo and the governor had to send 
the army to the rescue). 
</P>
<P>
The era of the homesteader was no glory period, either. The Plains are littered 
with sun-bleached skeletons of homesteads gone bust and consolidated into large 
ranches. Abandoned windmills dot the prairie like spindly tombstones. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1940s, my parents moved from Philadelphia to live the romantic life of 
ranchers, buying a homestead near Big Horn, Wyoming, with a two-story house, a 
cabin, two barns, two small ponds, lots of redwing blackbirds, cheat grass and 
a team of horses named Buck and Bally. My folks tried to raise sheep and went 
bust. They tried milk cows and went bust. We moved to Chicago and two years of 
a good-paying job, but by then my mother and father could not stand to be away 
from Wyoming. They preferred being poor in Big Horn to being comfortable 
anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Rugged individualism was not necessarily the key to running a small ranch. It 
was being a good neighbor. That was wartime and the only way to survive was for 
everyone to help everyone else. When we had milk cows, Dad would take turns 
with other ranchers, driving around the Big Horn Loop road picking up their 
full milk cans every morning and taking them to the creamery in Sheridan. In 
the summer, we would go to the Bensons or the Dows to help put up hay and then 
everyone would come to the Stall place and do the same. 
</P>
<P>
No vacations. When the hay is ready, it must be cut. Cows have to be milked 
twice a day, every day. Sheep and cattle must be fed regardless of weather. 
Animals get sick and must be tended. Horses kick. Tractors slip off blocks. 
Hands get caught in gears. People age quickly under such conditions. Medical 
attention may be many hours away. 
</P>
<P>
The promise of the future may be no more than the ability to hang on, get 
through the summer without losing a crop, or the winter without having to buy 
expensive feed -- and being able to make the next bank payment. Perhaps to buy 
a new pickup next year. Or see the youngest of seven children become the first 
to graduate from high school. Maybe go off to Laramie or even California to 
college. 
</P>
<P>
Outside money and business is greeted with ambivalence or suspicion. Many of 
these people like things pretty much the way they are. They go down to the bar 
for a beer or two in the evening, cheer for the the high school teams, go to 
town to shop on Saturdays, attend dances at the community center and know 
everything about their neighbors there is to know. They will be there through 
the current bust. They will be there through the next boom, too. Harsh as the 
land may be, they love it. They are survivors.

NEEDED: STRONG GOVERNOR TO SOLVE GROWTH GRIDLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Development Report, a Ventura-based newsletter covering local growth issues 
statewide.

VENTURA, CALIF. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last winter, after the deluge of local growth-control initiatives on California 
ballots, state legislators flooded the Capitol in Sacramento with a record 
number of bills supposedly designed to deal with growth pressures in the state. 
By the time the Legislature adjourned in mid-September, however, only a trickle 
of bills made it through to the desk of Gov. George Deukmejian. And with one 
exception -- the gas-tax bill, designed to provide $18 billion for 
transportation and encourage local traffic-reduction programs -- none of these 
bills really address the question of how California will handle its astounding 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
California once led the nation in innovative and aggressive land-use planning. 
The state's stable of talent in this area -- planners, lawyers, designers and 
consultants -- is still regarded as by far the best in the country. But the 
state remains unable to deal with the side-effects of growth -- in particular, 
high housing prices and severe air pollution created by an auto-oriented 
society -- because of the political gridlock surrounding growth and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
On the local level, this gridlock is by now familiar. Developers want to build 
buildings with a minimum of fuss. Neighbors don't want the buildings at all. 
And politicians walk a tightrope between them because they need both developer 
money and neighborhood votes to win reelection. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, however, that this gridlock exists because nobody in California 
is willing to make the sacrifice required to solve the problem. In a way, the 
solution is simple. It is true growth management, which means finding ways to 
accommodate further growth of all sorts (population, commerce, industry) while 
using fewer resources (cars, land, water) in the process. And nobody really 
wants to do this. Developers already feel that all of society's problems are 
being blamed on them. Neighborhood slow-growthers don't want to surrender cars 
and back yards. Politicians don't want to alienate constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
What happens in Sacramento is important because the growth conflict is not 
going to be resolved on the local or regional level. Local politicians can't 
really deal with the problem because ultimately they are responsible to 
parochial constituencies. Look at Ruth Galanter, now at odds with Venice-area 
residents who helped elect her to the Los Angeles City Council. Galanter was 
elected largely on her promise to cut the gigantic Playa Vista project down to 
size. No matter how well she does that, however, if she votes for the project 
at all she'll be pegged as "pro-development" -- and maybe booted out of office. 
</P>
<P>
Regional solutions probably won't work either -- at least not bottoms-up, L.A. 
2000-style solutions. Bottoms-up regional solutions depend on the support and 
political courage of local politicians committed to them -- and such 
politicians usually don't survive. The Los Angeles area is littered with former 
city-council members who were defeated for reelection because they spent too 
much time away from their core constituency, dealing with regional issues at 
meetings of the Southern California Assn. of Governments. (They're not hard to 
find; most of them work for SCAG now.) 
</P>
<P>
When the solution to a problem is this politically unpopular, the only way to 
solve it is from above -- by a political figure with a broad-enough 
constituency to take the heat. In the area of growth management, there is only 
one possibility: a strong governor willing to take risks in order to seek the 
broader political advantage that real problem-solving might bring. 
</P>
<P>
Here California can learn important lessons from two other states that have 
experienced similar growth problems in recent years: Florida and New Jersey. 
Both have dealt with growth aggressively at the state level. And in each case, 
a strong, committed governor has played a pivotal role. 
</P>
<P>
Florida has the strongest growth-management role in the country. The state has 
a few clearly stated goals -- housing, environmental quality, compact urban 
development, coastal protection. Local governments do most of the planning, but 
they are held accountable to state goals by the state Department of Community 
Affairs. If local plans don't measure up, they are rejected and development 
permits issued by local governments are no longer valid. 
</P>
<P>
This harsh but effective system was established by a strong governor, Democrat 
Bob Graham, and is now being carried on with surprising aggressiveness by his 
Republican successor, Bob Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez is currently sponsoring a legislative proposal to establish an 
urban-growth boundary around every large metropolitan area in Florida -- in 
essence, a dividing line between city and countryside that developers cannot 
cross. It is hard to imagine a Republican governor of California taking such a 
strong position. 
</P>
<P>
In New Jersey, regional planning was originally imposed by the state Supreme 
Court, which forbade suburban townships from zoning out low-income housing in a 
1975 case involving the community of Mt. Laurel. But when the state government 
finally did take control of the issue and passed a Florida-style 
growth-management law, it was largely due to the efforts of a Republican 
governor, Thomas H. Kean, with help from Democrats in the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, California suffers legislative gridlock, not only at the local 
level but in Sacramento as well. As in local politics, important interest 
groups in the capital all say the problem should be solved, yet none are 
willing to give up what they have. 
</P>
<P>
Local governments, with strong lobbying presences in Sacramento, are embroiled 
in growth issues all the time but their concerns are parochial. They fight 
among themselves, jealously guard their own power and don't want to be 
accountable to the state for housing, air quality, traffic congestion or 
anything else. The last thing they want is some bureaucrat in Sacramento 
telling them they have to permit more apartments and fewer auto malls. 
</P>
<P>
Builders, also a strong lobbying force, are not interested in projects that 
will permit people to use fewer resources, for example by encouraging more 
dependence on public transit and using land more efficiently. For one thing, 
they perceive a market risk. But beyond that, it would mean more governmental 
interference; builders already feel they are taking a beating at the local 
level. 
</P>
<P>
And the slow-growthers, despite all their talk about solving the problem, are 
rarely able to translate their rage about a new neighborhood building into 
effective political force at Sacramento. The only issue they really seem to 
care about is protecting their virtually unbridled ability to place any local 
land-use issue on the ballot. Only when this power is threatened do 
slow-growthers forge useful alliances with environmentalists and, therefore, 
manage to influence legislation in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has never really grasped the exercise of leadership, especially on 
the issue of growth. After six years of ignoring it, the governor finally 
backed a gas-tax increase this year, mostly for road construction. But building 
more roads is not the same as managing growth -- in fact it may encourage more 
land-gobbling and auto-dependent development, diggingCalifornia even deeper 
into the hole. 
</P>
<P>
The only interesting and potentially useful piece of legislation to come out of 
Sacramento this year was the so-called "congestion management" portion of the 
gas-tax deal, sponsored by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar). The Katz bill 
makes some $3 billion in gas-tax money available to local governments for 
transportation purposes -- but only if these cities and counties embark on 
"trip-reduction" programs to reduce the auto travel to and from new 
developments. If properly implemented, the Katz bill would constitute 
California's most important step so far toward true growth management, as 
opposed to simply building more roads. 
</P>
<P>
But local governments don't really like Katz's plan (he cut them out of the 
negotiations), and builders, who signed off on it earlier this year, are trying 
to get Deukmejian and Katz to weaken it. This political victory for growth 
management may soon vanish. 
</P>
<P>
So gridlock continues. Local politics remains a hopeless stalemate. Regional 
planning solutions are useless if they depend on the courage of local 
politicians. And in Sacramento, the process is dominated by interest groups 
that won't give anything up to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
But it is possible to break the gridlock. The California middle-class may seem 
reluctant to sacrifice much of anything, but it is still pretty riled up about 
traffic, housing, smog and the other side effects of growth. In a recent Field 
poll, 68% of those surveyed favored controls on "the spread of urbanization 
into undeveloped areas of my county." And while a majority said they want 
slower population growth, most still favored economic expansion. In other 
words, here is a populace that could be moved by political leadership. 
</P>
<P>
A strong gubernatorial candidate from either party should be able to take this 
clear public sentiment and turn it to his or her advantage. As in Florida and 
New Jersey, such a politician could make growth management a campaign 
centerpiece, break the gridlock of interest groups and reap the resulting 
political rewards. 
</P>
<P>
The political opportunity is there. The question is whether anyone will be 
shrewd enough to seize it in the campaign -- and strong enough after the 
election to break the gridlock.

</P>
<P>
"Greenhouse Effect Looks Like Just a Lot of Hot Air." 
</P>
<P>
"Environmentalists, Not Pollution, Are the Real Threat." 
</P>
<P>
The greenhouse backlash has appeared, as is obvious from these recent newspaper 
headlines. Global climate change has not only been popularized, it has been 
politicized. 
</P>
<P>
Those already unhappy with the state of the world are using one hot summer to 
call for major social reform. Those traditionally comfortable and conservative 
are resisting. They will probably deny the possibility of climate change until 
they see palm trees growing in New York and rising seas lapping the White House 
steps. 
</P>
<P>
If we let public discussion of environmental matters degenerate into ideology, 
we will all be losers. The planet does not lean right or left. It follows its 
own laws, which we can understand, at least partially -- and we will need all 
the understanding we can get to deal with the slow, complex, Earth-changing 
phenomenon we call the greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, as greenhouse politics gets more muddled, greenhouse science is 
becoming more clear. There are maverick scientists with extreme opinions, of 
course, but there is also strong scientific consensus -- strong enough to 
debunk many politically popular greenhouse myths. Here are seven deadly ones: 
</P>
<P>
Myth 1. "We're not sure there's a greenhouse effect." One of the first Nobel 
Prize winners, the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius, explained in 1896 how 
greenhouse gases trap the sun's energy and warm the Earth. He warned that one 
of those gases, carbon dioxide (CO2), is released when we burn oil, gas or 
coal. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 years later his reasoning is completely accepted, and atmospheric 
CO2 has increased by 25%. The main thing changed since Arrhenius' time is that 
we now synthesize gases he never heard of, such as Freon and other 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which are more powerful heat traps than carbon 
dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
The warming effect of greenhouse gases is not in doubt. Nor is the fact that 
these gases are increasing. They have been measured directly for 30 years, and 
indirectly (from air bubbles buried in polar ice) for 200 years. Different 
gases are increasing at different rates, all of them in upward-rising curves. 
Each year fossil fuel burning, deforestation and pollution release more of them 
into the atmosphere than the year before. 
</P>
<P>
If we allow these atmospheric changes to continue at their current rates, the 
equivalent of Arrhenius's CO2 doubling will be reached about the year 2030 -- 
when a child born this year is 41 years old. That would produce an average 
global warming of 1.5 to 4.5 degrees centigrade. That range tells you how much 
scientific uncertainty there is -- not in the existence or the direction of 
climate change, but in its exact rate of onset. 
</P>
<P>
Because scientists talk so much about an equivalent CO2 doubling, people are 
beginning to see doubling as some sort of end-point to the greenhouse warming. 
It is only a calculation point. The warming will not stop there, or anywhere, 
unless we stop it. 
</P>
<P>
Myth 2. "Last summer's drought was a sure sign of the greenhouse effect." 
Specific weather events at any one place or time are not evidence for or 
against the greenhouse effect. Even the fact that the 1980s saw the five 
hottest years in the past 110 doesn't prove anything. Weather is variable, 
noisy, shifting. A climate change can only be proved by keeping track of 
weather over decades. 
</P>
<P>
The counterclaim by greenhouse scoffers that the contiguous 48 states have 
cooled doesn't prove anything either. Such statistics represent only 1.5% of 
the Earth's surface. The Earth as a whole has warmed by 0.6 degrees centigrade 
in the past century. 
</P>
<P>
Myth 3. "There will be time to act when a climate change is measured for sure." 
The climate is the last place the greenhouse effect will show up. That's not 
only because it takes so long to measure climate, but because the oceans and 
ice sheets act as delays or drags. Any climate change we detect now reflects 
what we put into motion decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
If we want to deal constructively with the greenhouse effect, we have to 
measure not the lagging indicator, climate, but the leading indicators, 
greenhouse gases. Scientists use the word "commitment" to indicate the warming 
portended by the gases already in the atmosphere. So far we are committed to a 
warming of 0.5 to 1.5 degrees centigrade. 
</P>
<P>
Myth 4. "It will get warmer everywhere." No one really knows what a greenhouse 
world will be like. As ocean and air currents shift, some places will be 
hotter, some colder, some wetter, some drier. Climatologists are using huge 
computer models to sort out what might change where, but the models do not 
agree. Anyone who tells you that the Soviet Union will grow more grain with 
global warming, or that the Midwest will dry up, or that there will be more 
rain in the Sahara, is going out on a limb. The one certainty is that "normal" 
weather will change just about everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Myth 5. "We can adapt at reasonable cost." Since we don't know exactly what 
greenhouse weather will be like, easy claims that we can build dikes or move 
the Grain Belt north are just speculation, and uninformed speculation at that. 
</P>
<P>
The most chilling speech I have heard about greenhouse implications was from a 
senior agricultural expert who pointed out that it takes years to learn local 
conditions well enough to farm successfully. Imagine coping with ever-changing 
weather and pests, with shifting ground water, with irrigation systems 
engineered for obsolete water regimes. Old agricultural traditions will fail. 
New ones cannot form as long as the climate is in flux, perhaps for 100 years 
or more, during which time Third World population is scheduled to double -- and 
then double again. 
</P>
<P>
If you add up the possible costs of what scientists are projecting -- more 
forceful tropical storms, salt water infiltration of coastal ground waters, 
some rivers rising, others falling, inland droughts, flooding of coasts and 
estuaries -- you ask less about the cost of adapting to all this and more about 
the cost of preventing it. 
</P>
<P>
Believe it or not, there's good news there. 
</P>
<P>
Myth 6. "Combating the greenhouse effect will require great, grim sacrifice." 
By some kind of providence, every measure that will reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions is worth doing anyway, has other benefits and can be cost-effective. 
For example, here is a list presented last month to an international scientific 
gathering, of greenhouse prevention measures, in order of their effectiveness 
and urgency: 
</P>
<P>
Use energy much more efficiently and accelerate the transition to solar, wind, 
hydro and biomass energy sources (would also reduce fuel bills, urban smog, 
acid rain, oil spills, toxic wastes and oil imports). 
</P>
<P>
Phase out CFCs completely and quickly (a partial phase-out is already 
internationally agreed upon, at a leisurely schedule, to fix the "ozone hole"). 
</P>
<P>
Shift fossil fuel use, away from coal and oil, toward natural gas (would reduce 
many air pollutants). 
</P>
<P>
Stop deforestation, accelerate reforestation (would protect lumber, pulp and 
other forest resources, reduce soil erosion, flooding, and drought, moderate 
temperatures, preserve endangered species). 
</P>
<P>
Increase use-efficiency and recycling of all materials and of water (would 
increase energy efficiency, with all the benefits listed above, plus reduce 
municipal solid waste, toxic waste, mine waste, water pollution and materials 
and ground water depletion), 
</P>
<P>
Practice low-input agriculture (would reduce farm costs, increase energy 
efficiency, restore soils and rural ecosystems, reduce water pollution, improve 
health). 
</P>
<P>
These measures require tremendous changes in our current, environmentally 
semiconscious ways of doing things. Changes, not sacrifices. Actually 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
But if we look at the gains to the whole society and take into account the very 
real social and environmental costs of continuing business as usual -- 
especially the immense costs of not reducing the greenhouse effect -- we would 
see there is no better payoff on the planet than greenhouse prevention. 
</P>
<P>
Myth 7. "The greenhouse effect is a problem of the rich countries/poor 
countries, capitalist countries/communist countries." This is the favorite 
international political myth, a convenient way of shifting responsibility 
around the world. We point to the Brazilians burning their forest, they point 
at us wasting energy. Western Europe points at inefficient coal-burning in 
Eastern Europe (while the West Germans could save 26 million tons of CO2 
emissions a year just by putting a speed limit on their autobahns). Everyone 
looks nervously at China's plans to burn its huge deposits of coal. The Third 
World says it really has more immediate problems than some future climate 
change. We all suggest that someone else go first. 
</P>
<P>
If there was ever a problem the whole world has in common, this is it. If we 
let it proceed full-scale, climate change will affect everyone and the effects 
will be devastating. There will not be winners and losers -- only losers. 
Without a sense of global responsibility and justice, we will make a hash of 
this challenge. And we get only one chance -- only over the next decade or two. 
</P>
<P>
I would see no hope, if the the steps we must take were not possible, 
affordable and beneficial. It's not a matter of allocating unbearable costs, 
but of building a more efficient, less polluted world -- a world worth 
building, greenhouse effect or no greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
There is a greenhouse effect, though, pushing us toward environmental maturity. 
It's very real. So far only a small amount of it is inevitable. Probably the 
greatest and most dangerous myth we could create about global warming is to 
call it a matter of destiny, rather than a matter of choice.

STEIN ON OAKLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's too bad Gertrude Stein didn't live to see the A's make it twice in a row 
to the World Series as she would have been happy to know Oakland did, indeed, 
have something there. 
</P>
<P>
A group of us visited her in Paris while we were waiting for our division, the 
82nd Airborne, to be shipped home. Several of us were sent to the Sorbonne for 
a course in the French language and civilization. 
</P>
<P>
When she found that one of our group was from Oakland she said, "Il n'y a rien 
la." Her French, of course, was excellent but to us it translated "there is no 
there there." So started the meaningless phrase and its thousands of 
explanations. Sacrebleu! Maybe her "rose is a rose is a rose is a rose" can be 
explained the same way.

CONGRESS BOBBLES THE DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An uncommon burst of good sense gripped leaders of the U.S. Senate the other 
day and they agreed to strip all the extraneous non-essential items from the 
budget bill, including consideration of a capital-gains tax cut and a variety 
of outrageous special-interest provisions. Still, the action came too late to 
avoid what Washington has dreaded ever since 1985: imposition of 
across-the-board spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction act on 
Monday. Without similar action from the House, the broad ax of the law will 
fall on $16 billion in expenditures, half from the defense budget and half from 
domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
The Gramm-Rudman cuts have been the hammer that forced Congress in recent years 
to meet specific deficit-reduction targets. Doing so involved making painful 
choices -- along with considerable sleight-of-hand -- but those choices were 
not as painful as the threat of deeper, mindless reductions under Gramm-Rudman. 
This year, however, the budget process got delayed by President Bush's proposal 
to cut the capital gains tax and his opposition to any tax increase -- both 
promises from his election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
So finally, the Gramm-Rudman budget doomsday will arrive on Monday. Will the 
Capitol evaporate in smoke? Will the Washington Monument fall? Will the Mint's 
money presses grind to a halt? Of course not. No one needs to worry about the 
Gramm-Rudman curse because Congress already had decided to make that relatively 
painless, too. Leaders made it clear well in advance that if the Gramm-Rudman 
cuts actually went into effect, they would be restored just as soon as the 
budget reconciliation bill finally passed. In this case, Gramm-Rudman turns out 
to be a paper tiger after all. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that both Bush and congressional leaders decided back in the 
spring to fudge the deficit issue this year and attempt to forge a major 
deficit compromise in 1990. The implication was that Congress then could 
persuade the Administration to go along with a tax increase after giving the 
President one year of grace on his campaign pledge. But by deciding to just 
slide by in 1989, Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) of the House Ways and 
Means Committee said in a newspaper column Friday that the nation lost its best 
opportunity to achieve some real progress against the deficit since it was a 
year of clean slates with a new President, a new Congress and no congressional 
election. 
</P>
<P>
The offshoot of Friday's action is that the capital gains tax will be 
considered in separate legislation in coming weeks. And it appeared that Bush 
was ready to accede to Democrats' demands that there also be a restoration of 
the tax deduction for funds invested in individual retirement accounts. Such 
deals cost the Treasury money, of course, and it will be interesting to see 
where the revenue is to come from to pay for them (the capital gains reduction 
would earn new revenue for three years and then become a deficit-producer). 
</P>
<P>
Almost certainly the plan will make permanent the 3% federal excise tax on 
telephone service and cancel a scheduled reduction in the 8% tax on airline 
tickets. Thus the consumer will bear much of the burden, on top of the high 
interest rates he is paying as a result of the nation's staggering, and 
growing, debt. Anyone surprised?

Yocum is both right and wrong. She is right in saying that battered persons

right: Courts should punish abusers quickly and severely. But, Yocum is wrong 
about police not being able to respond to a call like Maria's. If Maria's 
father had been a county supervisor, or a movie star, or a police officer 
wouldn't they have come? And, isn't a life more important than a drug bust or a

CLARIFYING TOP FEDERAL TAX RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial "The Capital Gains Tax Muddle" (Sept. 26) reflects the 
misunderstanding most taxpayers have of current federal income tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
You stated, in part, "And the new tax rates contain a quirk by which a couple's 
taxable income of between $77,850 and $177,720 a year is assessed at 33% while 
all other income above that enjoys a maximum rate of 28%. That should be fixed. 
Democrats would raise the maximum tax rate for all the higher brackets to 33%." 
</P>
<P>
This suggests that higher income taxpayers receive an unfair advantage -- not 
so. Congress tried in 1986 to simplify the tax law by establishing just two 
rates, 15% and 28%. Prior to 1987 there were 14 rates for couples and 15 for 
singles, ranging from 11% to 50% 
</P>
<P>
To offset this change, numerous deductions and other benefits were eliminated. 
The new law also changed the historic procedure where every taxpayer, 
regardless of income, paid on the first portion of income at the lowest rate, 
the next portion at the next lowest rate, on up to the highest rate. 
</P>
<P>
Now, beginning at a certain level of income (you indicate $77,850), the lower 
rate is phased out. This is accomplished by adding a 5% surtax to the regular 
28% rate until all income taxed at the 15% rate has been increased to 28%. 
Additionally, the surtax continues until the credit for personal exemptions has 
been eliminated. Thereafter, the surtax is ended, and all additional income is 
taxed at the 28% rate. 
</P>
<P>
It is understandable that most people conclude that there is a 33% rate for the 
upper middle-income taxpayer, and a lesser rate for higher income taxpayers. 
IRS publications and tax-rate schedules shed no light on this matter. 
</P>
<P>
I am not forgiving of politicians who understand the procedure and try to 
describe what would just be a tax increase as correcting an inequity. If they 
want to increase taxes, fine, but don't con us.

ABORTION DEBATE FINDS THE APPROPRIATE STAGE; 
</P>
<P>
STATES: COMPETING MORAL CLAIMS CAN BEST BE RESOLVED BY POLITICAL ARGUMENT. WHAT 
BETTER PLACE TO DECIDE THEM THAN THE LEGISLATURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY L. McDOWELL, Gary L. McDowell, former associate director of public 
affairs in the Department of Justice, is vice president of the National Legal 
Center for the Public Interest in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Supreme Court handed down its abortion opinion last summer in Webster 
vs. Reproductive Health Services, it was greeted by the expected hue and cry. 
If anyone still doubts the political significance of the case, he or she need 
look no further than the political turmoil now brewing in their respective 
state capitals. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic politics has been radically altered by the Webster case for the 
foreseeable future. The states are rediscovering the gravity of their original 
role as centers of moral judgment. And that is the real virtue of the Webster 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Florida Legislature has just battled through a special session to consider 
abortion legislation strongly backed by Gov. Bob Martinez. That the Republican 
governor lost to the Democrats in the Sunshine State has been made into more 
than it is. Other states are confronting the same issue, and every indication 
is that Florida will not be the general rule. Pennsylvania, for example, is 
about to consider a package of the most restrictive abortion laws yet -- and 
the Democratic governor there, Robert Casey, has vowed to sign that legislation 
into law as soon as it hits his desk. To make the politics of abortion even 
more interesting, Casey is being opposed in the gubernatorial race by a 
Republican running hard on the pro-choice side of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
For 16 years, those who agreed with the court's landmark Roe vs. Wade ruling 
have been more than happy to avoid the legislative fracas that they now must 
face. In Roe, the justices constitutionalized abortion. In Webster, the court 
stopped far short of overruling Roe but was willing nonetheless to enlarge the 
states' prerogatives in dealing with the tumultuous issue. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, as the experience in Florida shows, the question of abortion finds 
good and decent people on both sides of the issue. There is no clean and simple 
line dividing pro-life from pro-choice; neither race, religion, gender nor age 
explains a person's stand on abortion. The reason is simple. At its deepest 
level, the question of abortion is a political question of the first order -- 
that is to say, it is a moral issue. 
</P>
<P>
Such moral questions can be resolved only by political argument, that laborious 
process of weighing the pros and the cons, the pluses and the minuses of this 
policy or that. While one might believe deeply that abortion is basically 
wrong, that judgment might have to be tempered, if not mitigated, by facts. 
Incest, rape, the life of the mother all must be weighed politically against 
any absolute claim that abortion is simply wrong. The legislatures of the 
states are quite capable of addressing the question and reaching some practical 
compromise between the competing moral claims engendered by abortion. Public 
policy governing abortion will be all the better for it. But there is an even 
better reason for shifting the political responsibility for abortion back to 
the states. That reason is federalism. 
</P>
<P>
To many, the states seem little more than a political inconvenience or a 
constitutional artifact. The fact is, they are essential parts of the 
Constitution's original concern for encouraging decent self-government. By 
providing a forum for the airing of fundamental controversies, the states serve 
to draw the citizenry more immediately into the conduct of public affairs. When 
the justices of the Supreme Court fenced the people out of the abortion 
question, they did more than merely skew the federal balance between the 
national government and the states; they undermined popular government. 
</P>
<P>
By forcing the people to confront such issues as abortion directly within their 
states, federalism can inculcate a healthy regard for the political process. 
Laws hammered out in a process open to all sides will enjoy a greater support 
among the people, none of whom will simply have their own way, but all will 
have a chance to be heard, to make their case, to persuade. 
</P>
<P>
As the other statehouses batten down their hatches preparing for a storm, they 
should reflect on how politically uplifting their role can be. From the 
deliberations they will be forced to engage in, state legislators and governors 
will inevitably serve to flesh out the moral dimension of this troubling issue 
of abortion. From the heat likely to be generated within the states can also 
come a good bit of light. While the politics will not be easy, the results will 
at least be democratically legitimate.

COLUMBUS LEFT 'REAL' INDIANS IN A BIND; 
</P>
<P>
AMERICANA: WHEN THE EXPLORER MISTOOK AMERICA FOR INDIA, HE CREATED AN IDENTITY 
PROBLEM FOR LATER ARRIVALS FROM THE ASIAN SUBCONTINENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANKUR J. GOEL, Ankur J. Goel is a lawyer and writer in Los Angeles who 
publishes The Indo-American Statistical Sourcebook. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I don't mean to sound unpatriotic, but now that the national observance is out 
of the way, I believe it's time for us to recognize that Christopher Columbus 
was a thief. 
</P>
<P>
I don't mean that he was a thief in the normal sense, although many Native 
Americans believe he stole their land. What I mean is that he made a mistake, 
and in the process stole the name "Indian" from its rightful owners and gave it 
to the natives of the New World. 
</P>
<P>
As most of us learned in school, American Indians got that name because 
Columbus, searching for a westward route to India, landed in North America. 
Believing he had reached India, the explorer called the natives "Indians." 
Stubborn man that he was, he continued to do so even after he found out he 
hadn't reached India at all. And by that time, the name had taken hold in the 
European explorer fraternity. 
</P>
<P>
Five hundred years later, the whole world continues to use the term "Indian" to 
describe those people who lived in the Americas long before Europeans even 
dreamed of sailing west. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I know that to most Americans, Columbus' little mistake is just a tidbit 
of historical lore. I also know that for those Native Americans who were run 
off their land and massacred by European settlers, Columbus' real mistake was 
showing up on this continent in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of that, my complaint may seem, well, trivial. And I suppose it can 
be viewed that way. But that's the nature of pet peeves, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
When I was in grade school, kids used to ask "What are you?" I always found 
this a difficult question. Were they asking me if I was a human? Were they 
asking me if I was stupid or smart? Or were they asking me why I looked 
different from them, with darker skin? 
</P>
<P>
Concluding that it was the latter, I would say, "I'm Indian." 
</P>
<P>
The next question was predictable: "What tribe?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, no," I would say, "Indian from India!" Eventually, I caught on and began 
to give that as the answer in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Years later, when I launched a magazine for Americans of Indian heredity, I 
faced the more practical aspects of the name problem. Once, when we were 
working on a historical piece about Indians from India in the United States, I 
looked in the library card file and found a whole drawer labeled "Indians." 
</P>
<P>
"Success," I thought to myself. I selected one title that sounded promising and 
traipsed through the rows of books until I spotted the target volume. I pulled 
it down from the shelf expectantly. 
</P>
<P>
On the cover, in full color, was a picture of Chief Sitting Bull. I'd been had. 
</P>
<P>
I asked a librarian for assistance. She couldn't find what I was looking for, 
either. Choosing an identification line for the magazine was also a challenge. 
The most logical choice seemed to be "The magazine for Indian Americans." This, 
I reasoned, was the way all other ethnic groups did it. There were Polish 
Americans, Mexican Americans, Chinese Americans. Unfortunately, "Indian 
Americans" often became confused with "American Indians." 
</P>
<P>
Other Indians-from-India proposed solutions. How about "Asian Indian American?" 
A well-intentioned friend who is not Indian proposed "East Indian," not 
realizing that the East Indies are a set of islands nowhere near India. 
</P>
<P>
The clearest solution seemed to be "The magazine for Indians from India." But 
the more I thought about it, the funnier it sounded. "Indians from India." It 
was so redundant. Like "Americans from America," or "Canadians from Canada." 
</P>
<P>
I decided to get to the bottom of the problem. I would campaign to have the 
term "Indians" reserved for people from India. I thought Columbus Day would be 
a good time to begin. 
</P>
<P>
When I told a friend who is a lawyer about the proposal, she was 
unenthusiastic. "The American Indians have been using that name for 500 years," 
she argued. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like you abandoned your trademark. Anyway, the statute of limitations has 
run out. You should have done something sooner."

PANAMA: IN MESSY FOREIGN-POLICY SITUATIONS, REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAINTY AND 
CONTROL ARE OFTEN TANTAMOUNT TO A COMMITMENT TO INACTION.

Some have blamed "wobbly diplomacy" for U.S. failure to take effective action 
during the Panama coup attempt. Some have blamed the absence of an effective 
crisis-management process, while others have cited "excessive prudence" or 
"timidity." Still others have concluded that a "profoundly anti-interventionist 
mood" in Washington was the basic reason that the United States did not act to 
assist Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega and his fellow officers in trying to topple 
Manuel Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
I believe the culprit was failure to understand the fundamental characteristics 
of violent events -- a failure widely shared in our time by the executive and 
legislative branches of U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
Comments of some senators and top Administration officials reveal that U.S. 
foreign policy and policy evaluation are driven by the desire for clarity, 
certainty and control, even in situations that are intrinsically and 
necessarily doubtful, ambiguous and volatile. 
</P>
<P>
Again and again, Administration spokesmen -- responding to questions about 
their inaction -- have explained that information was inadequate, that sources 
were of unknown reliability, that plans for the coup attempt were unclear and 
the United States' ability to control the situation unsatisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of such statements: "All through the day, the President was getting all 
these different sets of facts from different sources, and none of the sources 
was that good, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
"Unless it's your coup, it's hard to know what is really going on." 
</P>
<P>
"We were not sure Giroldi was the real thing." 
</P>
<P>
"It was not our timing." 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know if they would hand him over." 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know if it was a set-up." 
</P>
<P>
Thus were lack of reliable information and control of timing cited repeatedly 
by the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Many on Capitol Hill share the belief that a U.S. commitment to act in a 
foreign situation should require a higher level of specific, reliable 
information than was available in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
One Republican senator said, "Before the President commits U.S. troops 
anywhere, he should know at least three things: What is the reliability of the 
individual involved? There was doubt about that. What was the adequacy of the 
planning involved? There were great doubts about that. What was the likelihood 
of casualties, should the U.S. go in? . . . You should not commit U.S. military 
forces unless you've got a very clear objective." 
</P>
<P>
And a Democratic senator demanded, "Why weren't the contingency plans in place? 
I believe the Administration was right not to act without more information." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the Administration was acting (or failing to act) from the criteria of 
clarity, certainty, controllability and explainability that have been imposed 
by Congress on Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
Not only has Congress increasingly imposed restraints on the conduct of foreign 
affairs, it has articulated standards that are impossible to meet and, for this 
reason, are incompatible with the effective conduct of U.S. foreign affairs. 
But it is not simply Congress' fault. 
</P>
<P>
By accepting detailed oversight, review and prohibitions on presidential powers 
and the domain of foreign policy, Presidents have made Congress' standards 
their own. They have acquiesced in demands incompatible with the 
responsibilities of the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Today, there is a broad consensus in Washington against the use of American 
power in most situations. There is a consensus against U.S. intervention in 
almost all places, under almost all circumstances. There is a consensus on the 
need for clarity, certainty and control if U.S. forces are to be committed 
anywhere. There is a consensus against taking risks. 
</P>
<P>
As National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft noted, that consensus was shared 
by Administration officials during the Panama situation. 
</P>
<P>
But, as recent events have once again demonstrated, the requirements for 
clarity, certainty and control are often tantamount to a requirement for 
inaction by the United States, making it impossible to take advantage of 
fast-breaking, unplanned opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
As Karl von Clausewitz noted: "From the outset there is a play of 
possibilities, probabilities, good and bad luck, which spreads about with all 
the coarse and fine threads of its web, and makes war (or any use of violence) 
of all branches of human activity the most like a gambling game." 
</P>
<P>
There will never be a coup attempt about which the United States will have 
enough advance notice to permit an Administration and Congress to satisfy 
themselves about the reliability of the plotters, the viability of the plan and 
the chances for its success. 
</P>
<P>
By their very nature, coup attempts are perpetrated in deep secrecy by persons 
trusted by the dictator (therefore not trusted by us). They are swiftly 
undertaken and their outcome is uncertain. No one knows the attitude of forces 
confronted with the choices created by the attempt. 
</P>
<P>
These are the conditions of the game. Either the United States accepts them, or 
stays on the sidelines -- as the Bush Administration decided to do in Panama.

CONCERN OVER CRATER LAKE FOCUSES NEW ATTENTION ON FRESHWATER BODIES

<P>
On the bookcase behind biologist Jim Milestone's desk at Crater Lake National 
Park is a reminder that the National Park Service is "gravely concerned" about 
geothermal development just outside the park. 
</P>
<P>
The park service was so concerned that drilling for heat left by a volcano 
might rob the lake of clarity that it paid more than $600,000 for a series of 
dives to look for hot springs. It also focused attention on deep lakes, long 
the neglected stepchildren of oceanography. 
</P>
<P>
"It is finally begining to sink in that, gee, if we really want to know this 
planet, we've got to get down under not only the oceans of the world, but the 
fresh water as well," said Sylvia Earle, an oceanographer and head of Deep 
Ocean Engineering, the maker of Deep Rover, a one-person submarine. 
</P>
<P>
"It awaited the last couple of years, a couple of crafty (oceanographers), the 
Park Service and an issue, concern about geothermal development, to awaken 
people to how much we did not know," Earle said. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Oregon State University oceanographers Jack Dymond and Bob Collier 
led 23 dives -- 13 seeking hydrothermal activity, five for geological samples 
and five studying biology -- to the floor of the 1,932-foot-deep lake. 
</P>
<P>
They are convinced that hot springs exist but did not find conclusive proof. 
They will spend a year on a report to help determine whether Crater Lake stays 
on a list of national parks with significant thermal features. If it does, 
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. could block geothermal development to 
protect the lake. 
</P>
<P>
What Dymond and Collier did find were mysterious blue pools of dense salty 
water on the lake bottom laden with carbon dioxide and radon; fluffy orange 
mats of iron-eating bacteria; elevated temperatures in rock anchoring the 
bacteria, and rust-colored spires resembling stalagmites. 
</P>
<P>
At the deepest point of the lake, park biotechnician Mark Buktenica found tiny 
craters and a midge-fly larva. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Earle found ordinary green moss growing at the freshwater record 
depth of 725 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of it is the clarity of the water, but I think there may be more to it 
than that," said oceanographer Bruce Robison of the Monterey Bay Aquarium 
Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Indian legends ascribe the formation of Crater Lake to a battle between Llao, 
god of the underworld, and Skell, god of the surface world. Geologists date the 
cataclysmic eruption of Mt. Mazama at 6,850 years ago. The volcano collapsed, 
leaving a caldera that filled with rain and melted snow and became a world 
standard for lake clarity. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists became concerned that the lake was losing clarity and in 1982, 
Congress ordered a 10-year study. The clouding appears to be caused by growth 
in the population of microscopic plants called phytoplankton. The Park Service 
discounts a theory that nitrates from a septic system on the rim were feeding 
the plankton, but it is going to remove the system anyway. 
</P>
<P>
California Energy Co. filed leases just outside the park in the Winema National 
Forest, and in 1986 began drilling in search of geothermal energy. The company 
says it is impossible for its work to affect the lake. 
</P>
<P>
Dymond began studying the lake in 1984. "We found these unusual chemical and 
temperature variations at that time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Findings of a helium isotope he had seen in conjunction with ocean hot springs 
bolstered the theory that hot springs could be bubbling up through a crack 
ringing the lake bottom, producing heat and salts that stir up the lake. 
</P>
<P>
A remote-controlled submersible made five dives in 1987. On one, Dymond and 
Collier saw what looked like a plume of smoke curling up from a crack, but they 
failed to get a temperature reading or a water sample for proof. 
</P>
<P>
They returned last year for the first dives in Deep Rover. Navigation problems 
plagued them, and after 17 dives they were unable to claim more than 
encouraging evidence. This year, a system called ultra-short baseline acoustic 
navigation, which uses sound waves from four ground stations to locate the sub 
in three dimensions, cured the problems. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 19, Collier piloted Deep Rover to a depth of 1,400 feet in the South 
Basin, where hydrothermal explorations were concentrated, and poked a probe 
into a bacterial mat, where it registered 61 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, navigator James Cooley of Land and Sea Surveys peered into 
the colored plots on his computer screen and directed Dymond back to the area, 
where he found a temperature of 63.9 degrees Fahrenheit in another mat. 
</P>
<P>
The temperatures met the U.S. Geological Survey test for a thermal spring -- 18 
degrees higher than the mean annual air temperature at the surface, which is 
37.8 degrees. The water at the lake bottom is 38.3 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"So it is a thermal spring in some sense," said USGS engineer Manuel Nathenson 
in Menlo Park, Calif. Whether it is a "significant thermal feature" as required 
by law "is a judgment call by the secretary of the interior." 
</P>
<P>
California Energy geologist Joe LaFleur is skeptical and suggests that any flow 
at the lake bottom comes from cold mineral seeps. "Certainly an objective 
scientist would have to appreciate that nothing they have found would have any 
significant effect on the lake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the bacteria mats suggest that something is flowing, Dymond and 
Collier could not see it or devise any way to measure it. They hope that other 
data will show some fluid seeping through bottom sediments. 
</P>
<P>
One significant finding was made by Ray Weiss, a geochemist at the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego., whose team measured the amount of 
Freon in the water at the bottom of the lake, and found that it had been at the 
surface only three years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Nathenson said it appears that the lake is like a layer cake, with the top 
layer turning over like a normal lake in the spring and the fall, and a series 
of thinner layers mixing from one to the other to the bottom. In this way, 
oxygen works down from the top and heat and salts work up from the bottom.

VOLCANO LOCKED MAYAN SETTLEMENT IN A TIME CAPSULE; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHEOLOGY: FOR EXCITED INVESTIGATORS, THE 1,400-YEAR-OLD CIVILIZATION IS A 
POMPEII IN EL SALVADOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
On a June evening 1,400 years ago, a volcano suddenly erupted in what is now El 
Salvador and sealed an entire prehistoric settlement in a time capsule, 
complete with the dirty dishes of a civilization that flourished 600 years 
before Columbus arrived in the New World. 
</P>
<P>
Buried beneath 15 feet of volcanic ash and extensively excavated for the first 
time last summer, the houses of the village of El Ceren are preserved in such 
exceptional condition that archeologists say the dwellings and their contents 
are as nearly intact as Pompeii, the Greco-Roman city buried by the eruption of 
Mt. Vesuvius in AD 79. 
</P>
<P>
"No other site in the New World has domestic architecture so well preserved," 
said Paul Amaroli, an archeologist at Vanderbilt University who has visited El 
Ceren. "It's hard to wear out superlatives on this site." 
</P>
<P>
The excitement over El Ceren stems from the fact that although monumental 
architecture such as Mayan temples and Aztec tombs are abundant in the area, 
well-preserved households of the peasants and commoners who built the 
ceremonial cities and carried out commerce and farming are rare. 
</P>
<P>
Even more precious are dwellings that have been preserved with the clutter of 
everyday life -- the garden tools, the pots and jars, even the dead ducks in 
the courtyard -- found in the same locations as they were that day 1,400 years 
ago when the volcano exploded. 
</P>
<P>
"They lived better than we had pictured them," said Payson Sheets, an 
archeologist from the University of Colorado in Boulder who is leading the 
excavation of El Ceren. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize now that their domestic adobe architecture was much more 
sophisticated than we thought. The structures sit on big, fired platforms. 
They'd be dry even during the rainy season. The roofs were substantial. These 
were not people living crowded and huddled in a mud hut. Even their poorest 
houses were better than much of the rural houses in El Salvador today. They 
really seemed to be fairly well off." 
</P>
<P>
In El Ceren, ceramic pots were found tucked into adobe niches where they were 
placed by the occupants. A digging stick leans against a doorway. A wooden 
pestle rests in a stone mortar. Enigmatic graffiti are still visible in one 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Two metates, the flat stones used for grinding flour, were discovered still 
resting on the forked wooden posts that supported them in use. Sharp obsidian 
knives, some with food residue still clinging to the blades, are wedged into 
the thatched roof, placed as if to be safely out of reach of children. 
</P>
<P>
And what may turn out to be the only book, or codex, as archeologists call 
them, to survive was found in a small cubbyhole beside three painted pots and 
an oyster shell. 
</P>
<P>
"Other codices survive from Mesoamerica, but they were all squirreled away 
someplace, hidden, and then ended up in collections. None of the codices are 
attached to a context. We don't know where they're from or who used them. . . . 
Here we have a book from an agricultural setting," said Harriet Beaubien, an 
expert in the conservation of antiquities at the Smithsonian Institution who is 
trying to preserve the painted codex found in a block of ash at El Ceren. 
</P>
<P>
The Mayan settlement of El Ceren was inadvertently uncovered by a bulldozer 
helping to construct grain storage silos in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Sheets was in El Salvador, working at another site, and heard about the 
discovery of "recent houses" found under 15 feet of volcanic ash. Sheets said 
he expected the houses to be a hundred years old at the most. 
</P>
<P>
"I brought a trowel and went looking for Coke bottles, pieces of tin, plastic 
wrappers -- something that would date the structures," Sheets said. "Instead, I 
found a prehistoric pot. Well, I thought, these people must have had an 
interest in prehistory. I still didn't know what I was dealing with. Then I 
started finding more pots and I took some thatch samples for radiocarbon 
dating." 
</P>
<P>
Radiocarbon analysis of the thatch dated the structure about AD 600. Sheets was 
immediately intrigued, but even though he received funding from the National 
Science Foundation to begin excavating the site, he said he did not think it 
was safe to bring colleagues and students to El Salvador, which was then in the 
midst of a civil war. Sheets did not return to work in El Salvador until last 
summer, when the first extensive excavations were begun. 
</P>
<P>
El Ceren was buried when a vein of basaltic magma from the nearby Laguna 
Caldera Volcano came into contact with water from Rio Sucio. The combination of 
super-hot magma and water created steam explosions that blasted clouds of hot 
steam and ash toward El Ceren, a village of still unknown size. The rain of hot 
ash sealed the village within a volcanic cast. 
</P>
<P>
To date, three extended households have been excavated, along with outbuildings 
and storerooms. Nearby were furrowed fields with rows of short, young corn 
stalks along each little ridge, leading Sheets to guess that the volcano 
erupted in June. The fact that objects like digging sticks and cooking pots 
were put away makes Sheets suspect that the eruption occurred at night. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Miller, a volcanologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's Cascades Volcano 
Observatory who has studied the site, said he thinks there were several 
eruptions and ground shaking caused by volcanic earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the eruptions began, it would be hard to get away. With the fall of ash, 
it would be pitch black. The hot surges would be very lethal. The temperatures 
of the clouds would at least be boiling," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"There'd be hot, moist ash with larger chunks of rock sailing along or falling 
out of the sky. People would be scalded, their lungs would burn and they'd 
probably die of asphyxiation." 
</P>
<P>
Strangely, and with some disappointment, Sheets said that no human remains have 
been found in El Ceren. Residents who watched the bulldozer find the first 
household report seeing human bones and described shapes that might have been 
body casts. 
</P>
<P>
They have disappeared. Sheets expects further digging to reveal remains in one 
of the several structures still not fully excavated, or in a household yet to 
be found.

AS NEWEST PARK PLANS ITS FUTURE, MOST VISITORS SAY LET IT BE

The nation's youngest national park has barely taken its first steps and 
already visitors are worrying like overprotective parents about the future of 
its soaring mountains, 4,000-year-old trees and mysterious caves. 
</P>
<P>
Al Hendricks, supervisor of Great Basin National Park in eastern Nevada, said 
that more than 600 people commented on a proposed 10-year management plan and 
most called for restraint in improving the park. 
</P>
<P>
"The comments we received tended quite heavily toward protection and 
preservation," Hendricks said of the plan that was supposed to go to Congress 
this month, three years after the 77,109-acre park's dedication on Oct. 27, 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
"For the most part, people are not looking to build water slides, pave things 
over," he added, saying several people commented that "they didn't want Great 
Basin to turn into a Yosemite, which is overdeveloped. There's even a bank in 
Yosemite. It's practically a small city." 
</P>
<P>
"People like things mostly the way they are at Great Basin and we hope to keep 
it that way." 
</P>
<P>
Attendance is still small at the park, even though its 75,000 visitors last 
year represented an 83% increase over the 41,000 visitors in 1986. Hendricks 
said park attendance is expected to be remain at about 75,000 this year. By 
contrast, more than 3.3 million people crowded into 761,757-acre Yosemite 
National Park in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We are remote," Hendricks explained. "You kind of have to think twice about 
getting in the car and driving out here. But it's worth it. It's one of the 
last preserved places in the Great Basin." 
</P>
<P>
Responses to the management plan were compiled for the final plan document, 
which will not be ready to submit to Congress for about another year, despite 
this month's proposed deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Most agree with Hendricks about conserving the natural beauty of the park. 
</P>
<P>
"Great Basin is a gem: a small glimpse into the past that hasn't been trampled 
by the hand of man," said one anonymous visitor commenting on the plan. "I 
believe we should make every effort to preserve it as a testament to the old 
American West." 
</P>
<P>
"Please do not go on a building spree, paving over paradise to put up parking 
lots," another said. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's not broken, don't fix it," implored one Great Basin National Park 
lover. 
</P>
<P>
"Please change as little as possible," another said. 
</P>
<P>
But amid the anti-development comments collected in 1987 were statements from 
recreational-vehicle enthusiasts and urban dwellers who want creature comforts 
more than backwoods hardship when they commune with nature. 
</P>
<P>
"If you make Wheeler Peak campground inaccessible to us we will lose all 
interest in Great Basin National Park," one operator of a 22-foot mobile home 
responded. 
</P>
<P>
"Our RV was dirtier after a short visit to the park in June than in the rest of 
our 6,000-mile trip," complained one visitor. "Please pave major roads and camp 
areas. You have so much land that more should be developed." 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks said the plan would emphasize preservation of the park, but also 
would include some new campgrounds and access ways for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to try and accommodate as many people as you can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ranchers will be included in the park plan despite numerous negative comments 
that cattle and other livestock should be run out. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress put into the law that grazing would be allowed and unless they change 
the law there's nothing we can do about it," Hendricks said. 
</P>
<P>
Great Basin was the 49th national park dedicated in the United States and the 
first to receive the designation in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the park include 13,063-foot Wheeler Peak, second in Nevada only 
to 13,140-foot Boundary Peak; Lehman Caves National Monument's square-mile 
spectacle of limestone formations, and acres of 4,000-year-old bristlecone pine 
trees, grotesquely contorted from battling wind, sand and ice over the ages to 
become the oldest known living things on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Steep-walled glacial lakes and narrow canyons also are among park features that 
include Lexington Arch, a 70-foot-high, 83-foot wide stretch on which Indians 
left primitive drawings. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny town of Baker is the closest residential area to the park and has two 
small motels with about a dozen rooms. The larger town of Ely, about 70 miles 
away, has more amenities such as shopping and more motel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a ways off the beaten track," Hendricks said. 
</P>
<P>
Park operators submitted four proposed 10-year management plans for Great 
Basin. They range from leaving most of the park alone to developing miles of 
new roads, shuttle services and parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly three-fourths of the people who commented on the plan said they 
preferred two proposals that did not include much new development. 
</P>
<P>
Those two alternatives call for construction of a Great Basin interpretive 
center at Baker Ridge, access roads to the facility, and a 100-car parking lot 
for those visiting Lehman Caves. 
</P>
<P>
But the proposals do not include new developments or maintained roads for 
vehicles further into the park's unspoiled areas. 
</P>
<P>
Two other alternatives propose more deep-park vehicle access, including public 
roads leading to 11,658-foot Mt. Washington, and generally prefer a much more 
modern approach to managing the park. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the facilities we have now were built back when Lehman Caves became a 
national monument in 1922, so we do actually need some updated facilities," 
Hendricks said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, a third of the public comments urged park operators to relocate 
all housing, maintenance and administration facilities from the park to Baker 
to better preserve Great Basin. 
</P>
<P>
"We got comments on the far side of preservation and development," Hendricks 
said. "We just have to find a middle ground." 
</P>
<P>
Most respondents said they wanted to see access to such areas as Strawberry 
Creek, Snake Creek, Big Wash and Lexington Arch, which already have some roads. 
But they do not want maintained roads to Big Spring Wash, Decathlon Canyon and 
Mt. Washington, to which people usually must hike. 
</P>
<P>
Most want limited service camping in areas such as Wheeler Peak, Upper Lehman, 
Lower Lehman and Baker Creek, which already have some campgrounds. But they 
don't want campsites at Lehman Flats, Big Spring Wash, Decathlon Canyon or Grey 
Cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We want another four campgrounds in the park because now we don't have enough 
space," Hendricks said. "We're also working on getting the water system up to 
snuff. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever improvements we make, though, a lot of the park is going to remain 
mountainous territory available for hiking. I wouldn't say the park is exactly 
like it was in 1922, but it's close, pretty preserved." 
</P>
<P>
On other issues, about two-thirds of the respondents to the 10-year plan 
opposed hang-gliding and snowmobiling in the park. About one-third said that 
cross-country skiing routes should not be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Most said fishing should be allowed, but only on a catch-and-release basis, and 
that hunting should be strictly forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
The reintroduction of elk in the park should be encouraged, most of those 
commenting said, and predator populations should be left alone to control mule 
deer and other wild herds.

CAMBODIANS' VISION LOSS LINKED TO WAR TRAUMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE SIEGEL, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scores of Cambodians complain they are blind or suffer blurry vision although 
their eyes are normal -- a malady some experts blame on the horrors they 
witnessed in the killing fields of their native land. 
</P>
<P>
"These women saw things that their minds just could not accept," said 
psychology professor Patricia Rozee-Koker of Cal State Long Beach, who studies 
vision complaints of the Khmer Rouge regime's refugees. 
</P>
<P>
"Seventy percent of the women had their immediate family killed before their 
eyes," she said. "So their minds simply closed down, and they refused to see 
anymore -- refused to see any more death, any more torture, any more rape, any 
more starvation." 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the refugees with vision complaints are 40- to 70-year-old 
women who fled the Khmer Rouge regime, which was toppled a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the refugees suffer hysterical, psychosomatic or 
functional blindness, in which psychological turmoil spurs people with normal 
eyes to believe that they are blind or see poorly. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Cambodians also show signs of severe depression and post-traumatic 
stress disorder, which afflicted many Vietnam War veterans, Rozee-Koker said. 
</P>
<P>
Eye doctors said it is very difficult to distinguish patients with hysterical 
vision loss from malingerers who fake blindness to obtain disability benefits, 
attention or sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
Some question whether psychological vision problems were triggered by sights of 
mass murder in Cambodia, or by trauma endured by Khmer-speaking Cambodian 
peasants adjusting to U.S. life. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a real phenomenon," said Dr. Hector Sulit, a Long Beach eye 
doctor who examined dozens of Cambodians in recent years. "It could be the 
trauma. . . . The other possibility is cultural shock. There might be a few 
looking for sympathy." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael F. Marmor, ophthalmology chairman at Stanford University School of 
Medicine, said Cambodians examined there "for the most part were not 
consciously malingering, although it's almost impossible to rule out." 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Cambodians were killed from 1975 to 1978 by Pol Pot's 
fanatical communist Khmer Rouge, who tried to transform the nation into an 
agrarian commune until Vietnam invaded in late 1978. Nearly 200,000 Cambodians 
fled to the United States. Vietnam withdrew its troops in September. 
</P>
<P>
Hysterical blindness has been reported among shellshocked soldiers during World 
War I, children of divorced parents and people involved in traffic accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, an unusual number of female Cambodian refugees with 
psychosomatic vision problems were noticed by Gretchen Van Boemel, an 
electrophysiologist at Doheny Eye Institute in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
She contacted Rozee-Koker, an old friend, and since then they identified about 
150 Cambodian refugees in Long Beach who claim blindness or blurred vision, 
although brain wave and eye tests find nothing physically wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"One woman saw her four children and husband killed in front of her, then lost 
her vision right after," Van Boemel said. "One woman watched her husband and 
three children taken away in 1975. They never returned. She reported she cried 
daily for four years, then she stopped crying and couldn't see." 
</P>
<P>
About 15% of the women said they were blind -- with no perception of light -- 
and the rest claimed varying degrees of blurry vision, she added. 
</P>
<P>
At Stanford, Marmor and Dr. Michael Drinnan examined a number of people with 
psychosomatic blindness during the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
"There were more Southeast Asians with functional vision loss than other 
members of society, and almost all seem to be Cambodians," a majority of them 
women, Marmor said. "Most had some perception of light, but they ranged widely 
over what they could see. We speculated this may have to do with war trauma." 
</P>
<P>
Rozee-Koker and Van Boemel initially interviewed 30 Cambodian women through an 
interpreter, and found that those with the worst vision spent the most time 
living under the Khmer Rouge or in refugee camps. 
</P>
<P>
"The women's trauma history was extreme," Rozee-Koker said. "They had lost 
several to all of their relatives. They experienced beatings, starvation, 
forced labor, humiliations, separation from their families." She also suspects 
that the women may have been raped. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Eric Nelson, an ophthalmology fellow at UCLA's Jules Stein Eye Institute, 
said the women's psychosomatic vision problems "did seem to happen shortly 
after they saw some horrendous things, but they also went through horrendous 
changes of life" as refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Marmor speculated that Cambodian refugees may be more prone to complain of 
vision trouble because they tend to be uneducated peasants who experience 
difficulty adapting to life in a new country. 
</P>
<P>
"To know whether the Cambodian war was the cause of this would really take some 
scientific scrutiny, particularly when we have such a different social 
situation and culture to understand," said Dr. John Keltner, ophthalmology 
chairman at UC Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1977, Keltner and colleagues examined 137 patients who complained of 
vision problems but had healthy eyes. They included Laotian refugees but not 
Cambodians. Most were faking to obtain disability payments or awards in 
lawsuits, Keltner said. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson studied eight Cambodians to determine if their vision complaints were 
sincere. 
</P>
<P>
"Some had applied for disability, but some months before their vision loss," he 
said. "In five cases, the patients were given a diagnosis of major depression," 
and two more also probably suffered from it. 
</P>
<P>
Van Boemel said most of the women she studied also had psychosomatic headaches, 
dizziness, general malaise and stomach cramps. 
</P>
<P>
Rozee-Koker said the women "sit isolated in their rooms and live over and over 
the trauma through horrible nightmares and intrusive thoughts," and their 
vision problems are worse when they feel depressed. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Van Boemel and Rozee-Koker placed five of the women in group 
psychotherapy, while five others participated in a group where they learned 
survival skills: how to call police, shop and ride buses. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 weekly sessions, about three-fifths of the women reported improved 
vision and reduced depression, Rozee-Koker said. 
</P>
<P>
Sulit said some Cambodians get better without treatment. He refers many to 
mental health clinics, but "the system is not there to help them" with 
long-term counseling, he said.

ILLEGAL ALIENS DRAWN TO 'LUCKY' AUSTRALIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of people sneak into Australia every year, lured by its image as the 
"lucky country" where space and wealth are easy to find. 
</P>
<P>
Illegal immigrants, given scant attention in the past when they were relatively 
few in number, are receiving increasing scrutiny as a result of an emotional 
public debate over the influx of Asians into Australia's predominantly white 
society. 
</P>
<P>
Although most illegals are Europeans who have overstayed tourist visas, concern 
over immigration generally has focused attention on Asians and South Pacific 
islanders. 
</P>
<P>
Almost half the visitors from mainland China, tiny Tonga and Fiji drop out of 
sight when their visas expire. 
</P>
<P>
Most illegal immigrants find it easy to get regular jobs because of the relaxed 
local approach to rules and regulations, but many find it equally easy to key 
into Australia's social services. 
</P>
<P>
The government is now facing a bill of up to $380 million in social service 
costs every year from illegal immigrants who use health services and draw 
unemployment benefits without paying taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The total number of illegal immigrants is not certain but government and social 
service agencies estimate it at between 80,000 and 100,000 -- among 17 million 
people scattered around a land the size of the continental United States. 
</P>
<P>
About 750,000 visitors arrive legally every year, mostly tourists and business 
people. Immigration service figures show that most illegal immigrants are 
simply people who have overstayed their visas by as little as one day. 
</P>
<P>
Only a handful actually enter the country illegally to join the estimated 
15,000 people who overstay or breach their visas. About 4,000 of these are 
tracked down and deported, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Drug-runners and fishermen exploit the vastness of Australia's desolate 
northern coastline to drop the more gullible would-be new Australians into one 
of the least welcoming environments in the world. Few escape attention long 
enough to slip from the Outback into the cities. 
</P>
<P>
Government amnesties for some 15,000 illegal immigrants in 1976 and 1980 have 
encouraged hopes of further truces. 
</P>
<P>
"But after the amnesties, more illegal immigrants entered Australia hoping for 
further amnesties. There will never be an amnesty again and we regularly spread 
the message through our foreign missions," a senior immigration official said. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the majority of illegal immigrants are from Britain has done 
little to dispel popular concern that Australia is facing a major problem with 
Asian immigration. 
</P>
<P>
Australia accepts about 140,000 immigrants every year, and about 40% of the 
population are immigrants, or their descendants, from 140 countries. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 1945 some 90% of Australians were of British or Irish origin. Only about 
20% of the 115,000 immigrants who arrived during 1986 and 1987 came from 
Britain and Ireland. The biggest group, 32%, was from Asia, according to latest 
official statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The trend has given rise to anti-Asian sentiment here, almost 16 years after a 
"White Australia" policy favoring English-speaking Anglo-Saxons was officially 
buried. 
</P>
<P>
Race Discrimination Commissioner Irene Moss said the illegal immigrants make 
her job more difficult because of the general fear that they are mostly Asians. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen members of a racist group, linked to the extreme right-wing Australian 
Nationalist Movement, were recently charged with more than 100 offenses ranging 
from the fire-bombing of Chinese restaurants and assault to housebreaking. 
Their cases are pending. 
</P>
<P>
The government has no power to deal with racist groups until they commit a 
physical act of discrimination. Distribution of racist leaflets and other 
material is not illegal.

MERCHANTS FROM INDIA ADD SUBCONTINENTAL FLAVOR TO TEXAS BORDER CITY;

IMMIGRATION: HINDU RESIDENTS RETAIN TIES TO THEIR CULTURE, BUT EMBRACE AMERICAN 
AND MEXICAN TRADITIONS TOO.

<P>
The blending of more than two languages and cultures is apparent in the names 
of shops in the downtown district here: "Madre India," "Ropa Hindu," "Bombay 
Connection" and "Casa Hari." 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, an enclave of merchants from India has grown up in this 
bustling city on the U.S.-Mexico border. Spanish and English have met Hindi, 
Sindhi, Gujarati and other tongues from the subcontinent. 
</P>
<P>
On the back wall of Ramesh Tewani's Madre India No. 2 store on Zaragoza Street 
is a prominent figure of Ganesh, the Hindu god of good luck. Tewani came to the 
United States from India and settled in Laredo in 1977, about the same time 
other Indians were converging here. 
</P>
<P>
"What brought me to the U.S.? Business," said Tewani, who sells gold and 
Italian jewelry. "The Mexicans come and they buy gold from me in large 
quantities." 
</P>
<P>
His 20-year-old son, Mohan Tewani, runs the Madre India No. 1, which offers 
high-fashion costume jewelry, just a few blocks down the street. 
</P>
<P>
More than 90% of their customers are Mexicans who survey the retail selections 
before making their own large wholesale purchases, say the Tewanis and other 
Indian merchants on Juarez and Zaragoza streets. They say they found success in 
Laredo and spread the word to other Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Mexican customers smuggle the goods back into Mexico to avoid 
tariffs and trade restrictions, the Indian merchants say. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Aldo Tatangelo, a retailer, remembers a wave of Indians "just coming and 
coming and coming" in the early 1980s to set up the gold trade. 
</P>
<P>
"I call it Gold City because there's so much gold in there. The Indians are 
good in jewelry. It's very important to them, and they've got good connections 
with the factories in Italy." 
</P>
<P>
Tatangelo estimated that jewelry stores, now dominated by Indians, sell as much 
as $500 million in gold each year to Mexicans who come to shop in Laredo. 
Others have moved into cheaper jewelry, electronics, clothing and other lines. 
</P>
<P>
More than a few Indians live in the fashionable Del Mar "C" and Regency Park 
neighborhoods on the city's north side. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Indian immigrants have adapted to the U.S. and Mexican cultures, 
they also try to preserve their heritage. 
</P>
<P>
The India Assn. of Laredo's 33 families meet regularly for a dose of culture. 
In August they met at Ramesh Tewani's house for a katha, or thanksgiving prayer 
session. Afterwards, they raised the Indian flag to celebrate India's 
independence day. A letter to members, written in English, concluded with the 
message: "Viva. Indian Independence." 
</P>
<P>
Association President Kishin Rupani, owner of Dayasons Costume Jewelry &amp; 
Gifts, said the group helps maintain a close community. Indian entertainers 
touring the United States sometimes are hired to perform at members' homes, 
which serve as meeting places for the group. 
</P>
<P>
As with most immigrants, however, identification with the new country grows 
stronger with time, particularly for the young. 
</P>
<P>
Mohan Tewani has a shrine in the back of his store, but is unsure of the names 
of the Hindu gods represented. "My father would be the expert on that," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Command of the various native languages also is fading. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, they have to blend in with the society," said Rupani's daughter, 
Soma, a banking and finance major at Laredo Junior College. 
</P>
<P>
"We are Americanized in a way, but we're more conservative with dating and 
things like that," said Soma Rupani, 21. "You've heard of the arranged 
marriages? You have to stay within your community." 
</P>
<P>
Some parents still arrange their children's marriages, she said, but even that 
institution has been liberalized by time in a new country. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six years ago, Rupani didn't meet Soma's mother until after they were 
engaged. 
</P>
<P>
Today, "I will know the guy, but the one they approve of is the one I will 
marry," said Soma Rupani. "That's how we have changed a little." 
</P>
<P>
Andy Lakhiani moved to Laredo four years ago after nearly being killed by an 
armed robber in his former shop in Dallas. Nearly every square inch of his 
small store, Casa Hari on Juarez Street, is packed with plastic necklaces, 
earrings, scarfs, gold-filled jewelry, perfumes, sunglasses, clocks, purses and 
other merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
Lakhiani, originally from Bombay, said his three children don't recognize 
Indian culture, but he doesn't care. "It's good to be aware of roots, but you 
have to adapt, you have to blend in," he said as a radio behind the counter 
played music from a station in Mexico.

Moments after Marcella Gautier opens for business each morning, her regular 
customers begin arriving for their daily fix. 
</P>
<P>
The customers, blue-collar workers for the most part, quickly purchase a small 
amount of the fine, white powder they have come for. Many of them ingest it on 
the spot. 
</P>
<P>
"They tell me they need some of my powder to get them going in the morning," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
If it sounds as if something illegal is going on here, no one in Midway would 
be misled. 
</P>
<P>
Midway, you see, is midway between Salisbury and Winston-Salem, two of the 
region's remaining three headache powder producers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sell Oodles of Stuff' 
</P>
<P>
"Mister, you're smack in the middle of headache powder country," Gautier said. 
"We sell oodles of the stuff." 
</P>
<P>
She pointed to a shelf crammed full with packets of B. C., Stanback and 
Goody's, the last remaining brands in an industry that once had scores of 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
The powdery concoction -- traditionally a potent mixture of aspirin and 
caffeine -- used to be called "production powder" in the tobacco and textile 
mills that proliferated throughout the Southeast after the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
"The tobacco and textile mills were hot, noisy places and the . . . workers 
needed something that would give them quick relief from the long hours and bad 
working conditions," said Tom Chambers, president and chief executive of 
Winston-Salem-based Goody's. He noted that the first powders came on the market 
around 1910. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of druggists throughout the South -- and especially the Carolinas -- 
came up with their own special formulas. In the late 1920s, Winston-Salem 
druggist M. C. (Goody) Goodman combined powdered caffeine, aspirin and the 
analgesic acetaminophen. 
</P>
<P>
Goody's has always been a Winston-Salem firm. The company currently occupies a 
renovated overalls factory just down the street from where Goody Goodman used 
to dispense the original product over the counter. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers can recall the days when Goody's and competing powders were sold 
inside the mills from so-called "dope carts" that also offered cigarettes, 
coffee and cookies. 
</P>
<P>
"They're still sold in the mills today, but through vending machines," he said. 
A packet of two powders sells for about half a dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The three companies that survived -- B. C., Goody's and Stanback -- did so 
because they were better able to promote and market their product, Chambers 
said. "Marketing was the key because the ingredients weren't all that 
different." 
</P>
<P>
There's one notable exception to that: B. C. and Goody's still contain 
caffeine, but Stanback dropped the stimulant in 1984. "It hasn't worked worth a 
darn," William Stanback, son of the company's founder, said of the move. 
</P>
<P>
Stanback, located at nearby Salisbury, and Goody's are still small, family 
owned operations. B. C., which began in Durham, N.C., was bought out by the 
Block Drug Co. in the mid-1960s and was moved to Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Industry insiders generally recognize B. C., which was concocted in 1910 by the 
late Commodore Thomas Council, as being the first commercial headache powder to 
appear on the market. 
</P>
<P>
The headache powder industry grew rapidly in the 1920s and '30s, Chambers said. 
It continued to expand until World War II, when mechanization reduced the work 
forces at the plants and mills across the region. 
</P>
<P>
Today, headache powders account for about $50 million of the annual 
$1.4-billion analgesic market. They remain primarily a regional product.

IN HONG KONG, GETTING OUT IS BECOMING BIG BUSINESS

<P>
In this bastion of free enterprise and profit making, an industry is blossoming 
that cashes in on fear of the coming takeover by Communist China. 
</P>
<P>
From marriage counselors to immigration consultants, thousands in this British 
colony are capitalizing on a growing desperation about 1997 -- when Hong Kong 
comes under China's rule. Some appear to be profiting illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Emigration industry specialists say hundreds of millions of dollars are being 
spent by nervous residents who want to flee the colony. And, they say, business 
is bound to improve. 
</P>
<P>
The June 3-4 crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Beijing has sparked 
more interest in emigration than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 45,000 people left Hong Kong, mostly for the United States, Canada 
and Australia. The number is expected to rise this year. 
</P>
<P>
A survey in August said 2 out of every 5 residents want to emigrate, indicating 
that few among the colony's 5.7 million people believe in China's promise to 
maintain Hong Kong's economic system for at least 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent weekend at the Hong Kong Convention Center, about 50,000 people 
packed a show on overseas investment and immigration opportunities. 
</P>

Australian women sporting bright blue 10-gallon hats hawked houses in Perth. 
Videos showed sandpipers speeding down a Uruguayan beach and told of the 
wonders of investing in that Latin American country. A movie beckoned, "Come to 
New Zealand and be free." 
</P>
<P>
One consultant's Chinese sign promised a Peruvian passport for $1,500 and 20 
days in Lima. The Peruvian Consulate said it was impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Another consultant was selling $100,000 investments in the United States, 
although America does not accept business immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always a window," said former chemist Junny Co, with a wry smile and a 
wink as he passed out leaflets with the investment information. "I'm selling 
the American dream." 
</P>
<P>
Surveying the crowd, Peter Tse, a real estate agent for an Australian company, 
heaved a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a sucker born every minute," he said. "I'm just selling houses. But 
the consultants, they're exploiting fear." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in the emigration industry consultants are the big money makers, 
charging as much as $50,000 for a successful case. 
</P>
<P>
Consultants help prospective emigrants fill out forms, draw up business 
proposals and determine whether they have the necessary credentials to 
emigrate. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, the ranks of Hong Kong-based consultants have swollen to 600, a 
100% jump, according to Alex Lee, an advertising executive at Saleslink Ltd., 
which co-sponsored the convention. Hundreds more, including American lawyers, 
added to the flock when they set up temporary shop in hotel rooms around the 
colony. 
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Jagson Cheu elbowed his way out of a booth run by a New 
Zealand investment company. 
</P>
<P>
"They want all my money just to go to the bottom of the world -- I can't 
believe it," said the securities trader. "But I don't have a choice, I need 
help. Right now I'm just looking for the cheapest thief." 
</P>
<P>
Despite dozens of complaints of fraud to the Hong Kong Consumer Council, the 
government does not monitor the industry, and there is practically no way to 
sue a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Horatio Cheung, the only nonprofit consultant in the colony, tells of 290 
people who were denied Canadian citizenship after being bilked out of thousands 
of dollars by a consultant who tried to get around Canada's residency 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Royal Canadian Mounted Police raided a law firm in Toronto, 
and several Canadian lawyers have been charged with perjury and other crimes in 
connection with illegal immigration practices. 
</P>
<P>
Those who can't afford a consultant are going back to school to get necessary 
skills to emigrate. Some countries, like Australia, welcome certain workers, 
such as pastry chefs and carpenters. Singapore, which is facing a labor 
shortage, recently lowered its standards for immigrants, sparking 30,000 Hong 
Kong residents to mob the application office. 
</P>
<P>
But competition for seats in Hong Kong's few universities is intense. The Open 
Learning Institute, Hong Kong's newest college-level facility, recently 
received 60,000 applications for 5,000 spots for the upcoming school year. The 
government-run school made about $380,000 from applications alone. 
</P>
<P>
Fears about the takeover have also helped Hong Kong's matchmaking industry. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Mo, manager of the International Computer Marriage Consulting agency, 
says clients looking for a spouse with a foreign passport have increased by 50% 
since June 4. Her company now gets up to 200 inquiries a month and charges at 
least $1,000 for completed marriages. 
</P>
<P>
R. Shek, who is looking for a Western husband, said the crackdown made her want 
to leave Hong Kong as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong life used to be peaceful," said Shek, an executive secretary at an 
international firm, "but now it's time to leave. I don't have enough money to 
buy a passport, so marriage to a Westerner is the best route for me." 
</P>
<P>
But this sector, too, is tainted by suspect practices. One matchmaker showed 
letters from foreign men to his office, offering marriage for a "reasonable 
price," or $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
The immigration business has spawned its own service industry with TV and radio 
talk shows, newspapers and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
The Emigrant magazine started last year and now boasts 14,000 subscribers and a 
thick advertisement section, pushing land in Jamaica, passports in Latin 
America and factories in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"We have people in line at all hours buying back issues," Editor Katherine 
Kreuter said. "This is definitely a growth industry." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Britain has agreed to turn over Hong Kong to China in 1997. The colony, a 
bastion of free enterprise, fears communism. And those who can afford it are 
looking for a way out.

SCIENCE NORTHERN LIGHTS;

<P>
SCIENTISTS IN POLAR AREAS GO WITH GLOW

TROMSOE, Norway 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A geomagnetic storm battering the Earth's poles is growing increasingly 
violent, and northern lights researchers call it the best thing that's ever 
happened to them. 
</P>
<P>
The storm, caused by the bombardment of energy from solar activity, is making 
the shimmering aurora borealis brighter, more colorful and more spectacular 
than usual this year. 
</P>
<P>
Unni Pia Loevhaug, a space researcher, plans to fire bolts of electricity at 
the ionosphere, the layer of the Earth's atmosphere that acts like a movie 
screen for the solar lights, to get an even better picture. 
</P>
<P>
The study should offer insights into the universe and theories of physics and 
"increase man's storehouse of knowledge," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her work may have practical applications in helping to overcome the havoc that 
the electrically charged lights can play with radio communications and 
navigation. 
</P>
<P>
In Tromsoe, 185 miles north of the Arctic Circle, the tourism board is thankful 
for the aurora borealis, which has drawn the curious and adventurous for 
hundreds of years. 
</P>
<P>
These amazing sheets of light are the offspring of the solar wind -- bursts of 
energized atomic particles that sweep 93 million miles through space and slam 
into the Earth's magnetic field at a speed of 1.56 million m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The collision releases the storm of energy seen in the constantly changing 
lights. Over the South Pole they are called the aurora australis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely the most fantastic thing we have up here in the north," 
tourist official Gunn Sissel Jaklin said. 
</P>
<P>
"The aurora will just keep getting better and better from now until 1994 
because the 11-year solar cycle is moving toward a peak." 
</P>
<P>
Space researcher Loevhaug keeps tabs on the lights summer and winter, even when 
they are dimmed or hidden by the midnight sun. 
</P>
<P>
"We're already seeing things that I have never witnessed before," she said. She 
has studied the lights since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
From her laboratory 18 miles outside town, the 33-year-old physicist is taking 
part in European Incoherent Scatter Radar (EISCAT), a project launched in 1981 
to study the northern lights and the Earth's outer atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
EISCAT's studies are funded by Britain, France, West Germany, Norway, Sweden 
and Finland. 
</P>
<P>
A transmitter fed by five megawatts of power, enough to light a small village, 
bounces a radar beam off the ionosphere 30 to 1,250 miles above the Earth. 
Signals are picked up in Sweden and Finland and relayed to Tromsoe. 
</P>
<P>
"A radar wave is an electromagnetic field," Loevhaug said. "It scatters through 
the northern lights, and we receive a picture of what is going on. When solar 
activity builds up, it amplifies the lights and makes our studies easier." 
</P>
<P>
It took centuries for mankind to discover that solar flares, tongues of fire 
that leap thousands of miles above the sun's surface, caused the lights. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings believed the lights were flashes from the shields of warriors bound 
for heavenly Valhalla. Eskimos imagined dangerous spirits, while Swedes thought 
it was the torchlight of Lapps stalking stray reindeer. 
</P>
<P>
Centuries ago, Tromsoe's people feared that laughing at the northern lights 
would anger the gods, who would strike them lame. 
</P>
<P>
The aurora has sometimes been seen far south of the Arctic Circle. It was 
mentioned in the Bible and pondered by Greek philosopher Aristotle 2,500 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Even though lights are commonly seen in Tromsoe, "a colorful display makes 
everyone drop what they are doing to watch," Jaklin, the tourism official, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They look fantastic even when you understand them," Loevhaug said.

BUSHES' CAMP DAVID: LIVING IS EASY 
</P>

<P>
It's horseshoes instead of horseback riding, the movies are newer and the guest 
list is longer as President Bush settles in at Camp David, the weekend White 
House in the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 37 weekends of Bush's presidency, he went to "the camp" 20 times. 
Six weekends were spent at his oceanfront home in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
His stays at Camp David usually begin with a jog, aides say. 
</P>
<P>
Saturdays will typically include more athletic pursuits -- jogging, tennis, 
swimming, horseshoe pitching and "wally ball," a form of volleyball played on a 
squash court -- and work in his office. 
</P>
<P>
On Sundays, he attends interdenominational church services along with personnel 
from the camp, which is operated by the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Bush routinely accompanies her husband to the retreat. 
</P>
<P>
"She reads a lot, does her mail, takes work with her up there," said Anna 
Perez, the First Lady's press secretary. "If her husband is having guests and 
they bring the spouses along, which happens quite a bit, she'll maybe go 
bowling with the spouses. She always goes swimming when she's up there. They 
play tennis. It's a quiet time for her." 
</P>
<P>
As was the case when Ronald and Nancy Reagan used the camp, Friday and Saturday 
nights are often devoted to films in the camp's movie theater. The Reagans, 
with backgrounds in the golden age of Hollywood, preferred old movies. The 
Bushes' taste runs to newer offerings. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent weekend, they watched "Sea of Love" and "Shirley Valentine." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan used Camp David 187 times -- more than any other President since 
Franklin D. Roosevelt had it built in 1942. Weekends for the Reagans were 
usually quiet times spent without family or other visitors. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a place that the Reagans enjoyed to be alone together and to unwind and 
to be away from the pressures of the gilded cage of the White House," said Mark 
Weinberg, a spokesman for the former President in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans' son, Ron, who visited the camp several times with his wife, Doria, 
said that the routine was to "sleep late, depending on the weather, take a 
swim, have a ride, come back, hang out and probably see a movie in the evening 
after dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's daughter Maureen has said that she visited the camp only once. His 
other daughter, Patti, was estranged from her parents for much of the 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Reagan and his wife, Colleen, parents of the Reagans' only 
grandchildren, were living in California and did not visit the camp. 
</P>
<P>
For the Bushes, in contrast, weekends at Camp David often bring gatherings of 
family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
The First Family's newest grandchild, Ashley, went to Camp David on Easter, 
less than two months after she was born in Denver to Neil Bush and his wife, 
Sharon. The older grandchildren enjoy riding around the camp in golf carts. 
</P>
<P>
"You see grandkids putting around all the time," said one aide who has 
accompanied the Bushes to the retreat 65 miles northwest of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
On one weekend, the President invited Pam Shriver, a tennis professional, and a 
group for a weekend of tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Even foreign dignitaries have spent the night. Britain's Prince Charles was 
there in February, Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke visited in June and 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was there earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
One more thing: There is now a Nintendo game at Camp David.

RADIO BUFFS TUNE TO GOOD OLD DAYS; 
</P>
<P>
BROADCASTING: IN A TOWN WHERE THE LIKES OF THOMAS ALVA EDISON AND GUGLIELMO 
MARCONI ONCE WORKED, A TOWN THAT WAS HOME TO NEW YORK'S FIRST REGULARLY 
LICENSED RADIO STATION, THE MESSAGE IS THE MEDIUM. JUST ASK MEMBERS OF THE 
ANTIQUE RADIO CLUB IN SCHENECTADY, N.Y., ONE OF ABOUT 30 SUCH GROUPS AROUND THE 
WORLD. 
</P>

SCHENECTADY, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The members of the Antique Radio Club aren't very impressed with a fancy 
computer during "Show and Tell," even if the palm-sized gadget does decipher 
Morse code at the speed of light. 
</P>
<P>
But when someone starts passing around a set of stained, yellowed photographs 
from 1915 depicting one of Schenectady's first amateur radio stations, a buzz 
of animated conversation fills the cramped basement where they are meeting. 
</P>
<P>
This is, after all, something the 15 radio buffs, most considerably advanced in 
age, can understand. Tenderly thumbing the pictures, Carmin Baker wrinkles his 
brow and smiles. 
</P>
<P>
"Back then, it was kind of a prestige thing to know, hey, the guy next door is 
a radio ham," Baker said. "We used to try to hang around him because we were 
interested in that kind of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
The other silver-haired radio aficionados nod their heads. They've obviously 
come here to "get together with the other guys and see what they got and talk," 
as one member said. 
</P>
<P>
The Schenectady club, affiliated with the Rochester-based Antique Wireless 
Assn., is one of about 30 scattered around the world, according to Bruce 
Kelley, curator of the association's museum. All together, there are about 
10,000 antique or historical radio collectors, mostly in New York state, and of 
those 300 are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission to transmit on 
the rare radios, Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is something about the Schenectady organization that suggests 
that it is kind of special. 
</P>
<P>
"I built Langmuir's personal hi-fi set for him," said Robert Thayer, 73, 
referring to the Nobel Prize-winning chemist Irving Langmuir. "I put round 
knobs on the thing and he went crazy. He couldn't have a round knob. He wanted 
a pointer on there and he wanted to know where every one of the things was set. 
He didn't care how loud it was, but he wanted to know where that pointer was!" 
</P>
<P>
The memories come rushing back to these proud veterans of an era half a century 
ago when Schenectady, then home to the General Electric and American Locomotive 
companies, unabashedly called itself "the city that hauls and lights the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
They talk excitedly about an "intellectualism" that once permeated the 
"Electric City," located on the banks of the Mohawk River 15 miles northwest of 
Albany. Thomas Alva Edison started it all when he established his machine works 
in 1886, they said. Six years later, the two nondescript brick buildings would 
become GE. 
</P>
<P>
Besides jobs and prosperity, GE infused a much-needed dose of self-respect into 
a town that had too often been the butt of cruel jokes. The thankfully 
forgotten song, "I Can't Spell Schenectady," didn't seem fair to a thriving 
metropolis that had a lively downtown, huge department stores and a citizenry 
that included scientists such as Guglielmo Marconi. 
</P>
<P>
"Schenectady was a nice place to live back in the '20s. One of the nicest 
cities in the country," boasted club chairman Fay Eckert. "Well, they had the 
Erie Canal here for one thing, up to a point, anyway, which made it 
interesting. And it was such a clean city." 
</P>
<P>
But all this was before GE pulled out of the radio production business after 
World War II, quickly reducing its work force in Schenectady from a wartime 
high of 45,000 to 12,000. Many of the folks swapping memories at this reunion 
were among those thousands laid off. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years later, the locomotive company folded, giving a coup de grace to 
what had been a long downward spiral. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, nobody comes to Schenectady any more," grumbled Francis Emrich, a private 
radio operator for 42 years. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's insistent voice rises above the din: "When I was a young man, everybody 
got out of college, went down to GE and got a job in the testing department." 
</P>
<P>
That's why he, like most of the others, started working for GE in 1940, earning 
35 cents an hour on an assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
This was a time when Schenectady breathed, ate and drank radio technology, 
Emrich recalled. The city's skyline bristled with the antennas of "ham" radio 
operators. As a matter of fact, Emrich said, GE used to give away tubes and 
other paraphernalia to hams, until unscrupulous individuals began to steal the 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Emrich is a purist, which means that he won't use anything but genuine parts in 
his antique radio transmitters. So, many times, he's had to search in some 
pretty odd places for spare parts. 
</P>
<P>
It seems natural to these people that New York's first regularly licensed radio 
station, WGY, which first broadcast in February, 1922, was started by GE in 
Schenectady. Television, also largely developed by GE, soon followed in 1939. 
If necessity was the mother of invention, then GE was the doctor that performed 
the delivery. 
</P>
<P>
The old radios the members avidly collect and lovingly restore are becoming 
scarce, such as the 1924 Westinghouse Nelson keeps in his cluttered cellar. Or 
the 1930s Atwater Kent that a beaming Ed Farrell showed off in the back of his 
van at the club's flea market before the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is, when we were kids, a kid that was just mildly interested in 
radio could take a crystal and a pair of earphones and some wire and make it 
work," said Thayer, his fingers wrapped around an odd-looking 1936 GE metal 
tube that he uses as a gavel. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, everything is so terrifically complicated that a kid has to be 
terrifically interested to get into it. He can't just start with a simple thing 
and work up."

WONDERFUL MEMORIES OF SUBWAY SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY POVICH, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the first hint that two teams from the same neighborhood are verging on 
winning the two major-league pennants, the scream goes up and the sports pages 
react as if on command: "Subway Series!" Thus, some special significance, some 
historical importance is imputed to the upcoming World Series. It is not ours 
to reason why. 
</P>
<P>
Already there have occurred 15 of these intramural showdowns. So it has never 
been a rare event, or an endangered species to be cosseted and preserved. Yet a 
Subway Series is supposed to make one tingle, and that's what is coming up 
again on Saturday -- San Francisco's Giants versus Oakland's Athletics, from 
opposite sides of the bay. The subways are not as much involved as the Bay 
Bridge but that is easily overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago is always credited as being the site of the first Subway Series -- the 
1906 Cubs vs. the 1906 White Sox -- but in truth Chicago owns that distinction 
only because baseball's historians past-posted it. Chicagoans at that time were 
totally unaware of the city's place in history. It was no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
"Subway Series" had not yet come into the language, and Chicago, anyway, was an 
elevated railway town. Also, it was the era of the sports pages' wonderful 
slang. The Cubs didn't simply win the pennant. They "copped the bunting." And 
the White Sox more often than not were the "Pale Hose." For the horse racing at 
nearby Washington Park, they had a word too, "the bangtails are running." 
</P>
<P>
The 1906 White Sox were the famed "Hitless Wonders" and proved it by winning 
the first and third games on four hits each, losing the second on one hit and 
the fourth on two hits. But then they swung away for 8-6 and 8-3 triumphs and 
won the Series with a .198 batting average. They also set the tone for Subway 
Series to come. The American League would go on to win 11 of the 15. 
</P>
<P>
American League dominance in the Subway Series is due almost solely to the New 
York Yankees, who won 10 of those things from the Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
After 1906, the only other AL team to figure in a Subway Series was the wartime 
St. Louis Browns, who somehow poked their noses into the 1944 Series, hit .183 
as a team and were wiped out in six by the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees would go on to win nine Subway Series in a row but their initiation 
was not salubrious. They were knocked off in 1921 and 1922 by John McGraw's 
Giants in games played in the Polo Grounds before Yankee Stadium was built. 
However, in 1923 the Stadium-based Yankees beat the Giants in five, Babe Ruth 
sort of taking charge with three home runs. 
</P>
<P>
In my reckoning, these were the most memorable of the Yankees' Subway Series 
victories: 
</P>
<P>
1941 -- Beating the Dodgers in five with the help of the lasting infamy of 
Mickey Owens in Game 4 when, in Ebbets Field, the Dodgers had a one-run lead in 
the ninth, Hugh Casey pitching, two out, nobody on, 3 and 2 on Tommy Henrich, 
and now Casey throwing a strikeout curve at which Henrich swung. But, horrors. 
The pitch escaped Owens's mitt for a passed ball that rolled to the backstop. 
It was Owens's only muff all season, after 509 errorless chances. And then the 
deluge: Joe DiMaggio singled, Charley Keller doubled off the right-field wall 
to drive in the tying and winning runs, and Joe Gordon doubled home two more. 
Give the Yankees an inch and they'll take four miles. 
</P>
<P>
1947 -- The Yankees won the first two games and when the Series shifted to 
Brooklyn, the Brooklyn Eagle greeted them with a genus Brooklyn headline 
bannered across its front page: "YANKEES, DROP DEAD." The Dodgers tied the 
series at 2-2 in what became known as the Cookie Lavagetto game. It was a 
shocker. In the ninth, pinch hitter Lavagetto whacked in two runs with a 
two-out double that beat the Yankees, 3-2. It was the Dodgers' only hit of the 
game pitched by Floyd Bevens. 
</P>
<P>
That was also the year Commissioner Happy Chandler had suspended manager Leo 
Durocher for the full season, for hanging out with questionable characters. The 
Dodgers voted Durocher a full series share anyway. Chandler ruled that a no-no. 
It was also the year sportswriter Jimmy Cannon, arriving by subway a bit late 
for the game, heard a newsstand radio blaring the play-by-play. Cannon asked 
the news dealer, "What's the score?" And was informed by that Brooklyn cynic, 
"Yankees leading two-nothing if you wanna believe that thing." 
</P>
<P>
1953 -- Yankees beat the Dodgers in six, and who's the most valuable player and 
leading hitter in the Series? Surprise. 'Twas Billy Martin, who had 12 hits and 
batted .500. Billy, no power hitter, hit two homers in that Series, then won 
Game 6 with a ninth-inning single. 
</P>
<P>
1956 -- The Yankees over the Dodgers again, in seven. In Game 5 they were held 
to five hits and two runs by Brooklyn's Sal Maglie. It was useless. Don Larsen, 
who on Friday had been knocked out in 1 2-3 innings, giving up four runs, was 
back in there starting the Monday game. Larson was the Yankees' bad boy, often 
in early-morning trouble with traffic cops and other people. But that Monday he 
pitched a World Series game for the ages, allowing nobody to reach base, the 
only such game in all World Series history. It was, as was written, the perfect 
game by the imperfect man. Subway Series? That aspect of it, if it was ever 
important, has long been forgotten.

HIS SPIRIT LIVES ON;

<P>
COLORADO PLAYERS DRAW INSPIRATION FROM MEMORY OF SAL AUNESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Colorado acknowledges Sal Aunese as if he is still present. "Sal says" and "Sal 
is," the Buffaloes say. They nominate him for MVP awards, wear his name on 
their jersey sleeves, and point to the places he should and used to be. 
</P>
<P>
There is more than just a season going on at Colorado. A team that a year ago 
was blighted by arrests plays with greater cause and emotion than anyone in the 
country after burying its 21-year-old quarterback. That the Buffaloes are 
undefeated at 5-0 and ranked No. 3 is the least of what has happened here. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 23 at 8:47 p.m. Aunese died of stomach and lung cancer. But as a 
clergyman told them during a memorial service, and as running back Eric 
Bieniemy repeats over and over: "Sal's still here. You just have to point a 
little higher." 
</P>
<P>
The death of Aunese and the fervent play of the Buffaloes have apparently drawn 
together a team once rife with trouble. From January 1986 to Jan uary 1989, 
there were 24 arrests (18 in 1987) involving current or former football 
players, ranging from two rape accusations (both acquittals) to misdemeanor 
assaults such as throwing a magazine at a person. Just as public outcry reached 
a height, Aunese fell ill, and so they were struck by a humiliating alienation 
on campus and overwhelming grief at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last six months there have been several player departures and some 
searching discussions with campus officials, police, counselors and each other. 
There has also been the hard spiritualism of Coach Bill McCartney, who during a 
memorial service acknowledged publicly for the first time that Aunese fathered 
the son born last spring to his 19-year-old daughter, Kristin. 
</P>
<P>
So this overwrought season has become both a public memorial to Aunese and an 
attempt at redemption by the Buffaloes. They aspire to the Orange Bowl and a 
shot at the national championship; their last outright Big Eight championship 
came in 1961, and not since 1977 have they been ranked higher than both of the 
perennial conference champions, Oklahoma and Nebraska. On a board in their 
meeting room is a sketch of a set of steps, each one labeled with the name of 
an opponent. At the top it says, "Sal." 
</P>
<P>
"We went through a lot," McCartney said. "But you forge a sword in fire. Going 
through a furnace of affliction has a way of bringing you together." 
</P>
<P>
How they have individually dealt with the turmoil is more complicated. 
McCartney has not com-mented on his grandson again. Aunese's best friend, 
defensive tackle Okland Salavea, returns to his room each night after practice 
and talks as though Aunese is with him. Sophomore quarterback Darian Hagan, 
once known for brashness, has quieted. "I've lost all that," he said. "There's 
no place for mouthiness." Bieniemy instinctively glances up at the private box 
where Aunese watched the first three games of the season with oxygen tubes 
across his thinning face. His intention was to live until the Oklahoma game on 
Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe Sal is a major part of this team, how it came together," 
Salavea said, eyes welling. "When he was diagnosed, everyone dropped to their 
knees. We all looked at each other and said, 'Why Sal?' And there's just no 
answer. Sal told us there's nothing we can't do, that it all depends on us. 
That's what we're carrying right now." 
</P>
<P>
Against Iowa State Saturday, the Buffaloes were seeking to become 6-0 for the 
first time since 1961. They have manhandled every opponent regardless of how 
respectable, including Texas (27-6), Illinois (38-7) and Washington (45-28). 
Their 204 points scored is an all-time high for the school after five games. 
The Washington game was particularly indicative of the power of their option 
offense, as they led by 38-6 after three quarters and scored the most points by 
a visiting team in Husky Stadium in 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Aunese was no angel certainly, merely a talented, handsome fellow 
of Samoan descent who had his shortcomings like anyone else. In 1988 he served 
12 days in jail after pleading guilty to misdemeanor assault. He was also an 
intelligent and admired leader, majoring in sociology and on schedule to 
graduate, taking summer classes even as he was treated for his illness. 
</P>
<P>
Also at the same time, he sought to help remedy a team torn by its past and 
experiencing occasional dissent and murmurs of destructive egos. "Sometimes 
you'd have a guy trying to do too much, and another guy not doing enough," 
defensive tackle Art Walker said. "There was some complaining, bickering." They 
were somewhat isolated from an angered campus and sometimes from each other. 
</P>
<P>
"There were guys on this team I didn't even know," Salavea said quietly. 
"That's embarrassing. Now it doesn't matter where you see them or what you're 
doing, you stop and talk to them. You ask them how they are." 
</P>
<P>
Aunese left behind a letter to the team urging the players to pull together and 
to make the Orange Bowl. "We had to start doing things together," Bieniemy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Aunese has also become a sort of constant second thought for the Buffaloes, an 
internal caution and reminder of their new code of behavior. As players who 
normally had little to say to each other began collecting in groups, monitoring 
of each other became a habit. The Buffaloes say that has helped prevent more 
incidents like those over the last two years. "Everybody is there to talk you 
out of whatever bad, stupid thing you're about to do," Salavea said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the problems were minor, a handful of them major. Aunese's trouble came 
when he pleaded guilty after tearing up a dormitory, enraged by what he said 
was a racial slur. Bieniemy pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct after a 
bar fight as a freshman, also saying he was angered by a racial remark. There 
was a shoplifting offense that resulted in suspension; someone else had an 
argument with a girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
The incidents occurred on an otherwise quiet, affluent campus of pink granite 
and tiled roofs at the foot of pine-studded mountains. It is known for 
bandleader Glenn Miller, who as an undergraduate would drive up to the mesas 
and play under the moon and his headlights. Also for Supreme Court Justice 
Byron White, who as the Whizzer led the Buffaloes to an 8-0 start in 1937, and 
for Hale Irwin, a defensive back who graduated in 1966 and became a U.S. Open 
golf champion. 
</P>
<P>
It is also a campus where minorities make up 10.3 percent of the student body 
of 24,365, with 867 Hispanics, 905 Asians and 343 blacks. That, coupled with 
the usual ambivalence of a campus toward its football team, may have 
exacerbated some of the clashes. "They were saying (urban) people like us were 
the problem," Walker said. To Salavea, an imposing figure with close-clipped 
black hair and a dangling braid, perceptions and labels were partly 
responsible. "People said, 'They're just football players. They'll do what's 
expected of them -- nothing good at all.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bieniemy said, "We set ourselves up for it. It never would have happened if we 
had thought twice. People were pointing us out, but we also let ourselves in 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
McCartney steadfastly maintains there was no severe discipline problem on the 
team, more a series of clashes with townspeople or other students in a small, 
protective community with some strict ordinances. Even so, severe action was 
taken: of the two players acquitted of rape, one chose to leave, the other was 
asked to. Several other players on the spring roster are gone, for various 
reasons. "We weren't experiencing anything that society in general doesn't 
undergo," McCartney said. "Boulder is a unique place, and some inner-city kids 
had to adjust to it. ... I felt we ran a disciplined program, and yet we were 
having all these altercations. We had to call them to account in a stricter 
way." 
</P>
<P>
There have been no reported instances of encounters with police since the 
spring. Exchange and counseling programs between players and police were 
mandated by university officials to alleviate tensions. 
</P>
<P>
A truer indication of whether Colorado has put behavioral problems behind is 
more likely to come later. But getting over the loss of Aunese is another 
thing. That healing process will also go far beyond one season. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's been a recovery," Bieniemy said. "We've adjusted. I 
don't think we'll ever recover."

RAMS GAINED VARIED OFFENSIVE ATTACK AFTER DICKERSON DEPARTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG LOGAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When you think about it, maybe Eric Dickerson just would have been in the way 
of Ernie Zampese's plans for the Los Angeles Rams. If you've got Dickerson, 
you've got to give him the ball all the time, right? Since the Dickerson trade 
two years ago this Halloween, people such as quarterback Jim Everett, wide 
receiver Henry Ellard and running back Greg Bell, whose career in Buffalo was 
at a dead end until he was thrown into the deal, have blossomed in the Rams' 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams still can run the ball, as Bell's 1,212 rushing yards last season 
attest. The difference since Zampese joined Coach John Robinson's staff in 1987 
is that the Rams also have a varied passing attack. 
</P>
<P>
"They still beat you with the run first, but they've got an effective passing 
game," said Atlanta cornerback Bobby Butler, who has been playing the Rams 
twice a year for nine seasons. "They've got the best running game in the 
league; their quarterback is having a ball; they have good wide receivers, and 
they have a great offensive line." 
</P>
<P>
It shows. The Rams are the lone undefeated team in the NFL after five games, 
and they got a break when Bills quarterback Jim Kelly suffered an injury that 
will put him out of their Monday night encounter in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
The maturation of Everett, who threw 31 touchdown passes last season, and the 
emergence of Ellard, who topped the 1,000-yard mark in receiving for the first 
time in his sixth season last year when he caught a career-high 86 passes for 
1,414 yards, can be traced directly to Zampese's influence. "That offensive 
coordinator likes to throw the ball," Falcons Pro Bowl cornerback Scott Case 
said after a 26-14 loss to the Rams Sunday in Anaheim. "Of course, I might run 
that team pretty well with Everett and Ellard." 
</P>
<P>
Ellard joined the Rams in 1983, the same season as Dickerson, but he was just a 
bit player until Zampese arrived. "Eric carried us," Ellard said of the Rams' 
old offense. "I didn't mind running downfield to block for him because he's a 
great guy. But now, we're more balanced. We're more effective now. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the stuff we do is timing routes. Ernie Zampese is the mastermind. He 
tries to figure out how to get me somewhere (defenses) can't lock in on me and 
double-cover me. I owe Ernie Zampese a lot for the way my success has gone." 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons' Case said the Rams are especially effective at "hiding" Ellard 
from the defense by the way they move him around. "That's where Ernie Zampese 
comes in," Everett said. "We don't play Henry in one place all the time. We put 
him in motion. If you want to double him, we try to adjust. Maybe we send 
Flipper Anderson deep. If you want to double both wide receivers, we get the 
ball to (tight end) Pete Holohan. Teams can't clue in on one particular thing. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not one-dimensional. We're not a passing team that sets up the run. 
We're whatever it takes to beat you." 
</P>
<P>
When new Los Angeles Raiders Coach Art Shell was a player, his friend Gene 
Upshaw remembers he was very quiet before games. The Raiders had a loose locker 
room, but Shell sat in front of his locker, concentrating on his assignments. 
That changed when Shell became the Raiders' offensive line coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd tell funny stories to the offensive linemen before games to relax them," 
Shell said last week. "One was about the first year we had (300-pound tackle) 
Bob Brown. We were playing the Eagles, and Brown was going against a defensive 
end named Ernie Callaway. 'Boomer' was a striking force, and he was knocking 
Callaway all over the place. 
</P>
<P>
"He told the guy, 'You better stop coming like that. You'll get killed.' The 
guy said, 'I'm going to keep coming.' Brown said, 'You keep coming like that, 
and you'll be like a head of cabbage -- all head and no (rear) -- because I'm 
going to kill you."' 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco 49ers, who turned down a No. 1 draft pick from the Phoenix 
Cardinals for cornerback Tim McKyer during the off-season, are trying to trade 
McKyer, who was suspended last week for insubordination. Three doctors said 
McKyer had recovered from a groin injury and could play against the New Orleans 
Saints, but McKyer refused and told Coach George Seifert he didn't think he 
would play very well if he was used in the nickel defense. The Cardinals and 
Raiders have shown some interest in McKyer, who makes $500,000 a year, but his 
trade value definitely has declined. 
</P>
<P>
When Shell was named coach of the Raiders last week, he received a telegram 
from former Steelers defensive lineman Dwight White, a bitter enemy on the 
playing field. It read: "Congratulations. I might even become a Raiders fan." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers have scored more points in the fourth quarter this season (66) than 
the Cowboys have scored all year (54). 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner candidate Paul Tagliabue attended Georgetown on a basketball 
scholarship and wore the same No. 33 jersey later worn by Patrick Ewing. 
Tagliabue averaged 9.0 rebounds, compared to 9.2 for Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
Shell commenting on whether Bo Jackson, who was to report to the Raiders 
Wednesday, does or does not know diddly: "I don't want to tell Bo he don't know 
diddly. Bo knows. He's doing all right for himself. He's a very smart 
individual."

BY THE BAY, IT'S WHO'S ON HILL THAT COUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD JUSTICE, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Oakland Athletics play well in Peoria and Pensacola because of all those 
huge bodies and majestic home runs, but they're baseball's winningest team 
because of a pitching staff that's close to perfect. 
</P>
<P>
This World Series is about cities as different as Gertrude Stein and Jack 
London, about comparing Jose Canseco's biceps with Kevin Mitchell's forearms, 
about mayors making corny bets and about ticket scalpers having the best week 
of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately it may not be decided by any of those things, not the chilling winds 
of San Francisco's Candlestick or the Bash Brothers of Oakland. This World 
Series, like almost all of them the last 20 or so years, is about pitching. 
Which is why the A's expect to win. 
</P>
<P>
"Starting pitching," A's Manager Tony La Russa said. "If we get the most good 
games out of our starters, we'll probably win. If they do, they'll probably 
win." 
</P>
<P>
That may be true, except the A's have several safety valves. Seldom have middle 
relievers ever been such a hot topic of conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Yet seldom has a team had middle relief like that of the A's. While their front 
four of Dave Stewart, Mike Moore, Bob Welch and Storm Davis were 76-35, the A's 
are so deep in pitching that you could put together a first-rate rotation out 
of their bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
There's young right-handed Todd Burns. He's 26, has a 92-mph fastball and a 
slider that will make your eyes water. On almost any other team, he'd be a 
front-line starter, on some a No. 1 or No. 2 starter. 
</P>
<P>
In Oakland, he's a 96-inning middle man, who saved eight games, won six and 
rolled up a 2.24 ERA. He was so impressive that A's pitching coach Dave Duncan 
said, "The only negative thoughts I had about us signing Mike Moore last winter 
was that it would keep Todd Burns out of the rotation another year. He has 
accepted the role because this staff is so special. 
</P>
<P>
"He won't be satisfied with that forever." 
</P>
<P>
Down a couple of lockers is another hard-throwing right-hander, 29-year-old 
Gene Nelson. He had moderate success as a starter on bad teams in Seattle and 
Chicago, but with the A's has landed in the middle and become a valuable piece 
of a championship team, appearing in 50 games, pitching 80 innings, winning 
three times and getting three saves. 
</P>
<P>
There's also left-hander Rick Honeycutt, who was a top starter with the Rangers 
and Dodgers. With the A's, he's the short man before the other short man -- 
Dennis Eckersley. 
</P>
<P>
When Eckersley was injured this season, Honeycutt went 10 for 10 in save 
chances. He's also a big reason Eckersley is so dominating. 
</P>
<P>
"How many times do you see Eckersley come in and face a tight left-handed 
hitter," an American League scout asked the other night. "Don't take anything 
away from Eckersley, but La Russa gets the best out of all those guys." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed when someone asked Eckersley about facing Giants hitting star Will Clark 
in Saturday night's Game 1, Eckersley smiled and pointed toward Honeycutt. 
</P>
<P>
"Good luck, Rick," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the A's have Eckersley, the first pitcher in history to go from 
winning 20 games as a starter to saving 45 as a reliever. 
</P>
<P>
While other teams expect their starters to get them into the seventh or eighth 
inning, the A's do not, especially with Davis and Welch, who usually go hard 
for five or six innings, then beat their teammates to the postgame buffet. 
</P>
<P>
"We just feel like our pitching is the best," said Stewart, the first pitcher 
since Jim Palmer (1975-78) to win 20 games three straight years. "People love 
to talk about home runs, but pitching and defense is what keeps you in every 
game you play." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the A's weren't much of an offensive machine at all until Rickey 
Henderson arrived in June. They finished fourth in the AL in runs and tied with 
Cleveland for sixth in home runs. 
</P>
<P>
But their 3.09 staff ERA was the league's best in eight years and they're the 
first team in 16 years to win back-to-back ERA titles. They allowed three or 
fewer runs a staggering 94 times (80-14 record). 
</P>
<P>
The A's are so deep in pitching that La Russa will use a four-man rotation in 
the World Series. That's a change from a year ago when he went with three and 
hoped to pitch Stewart in Games 1, 4 and 7 (the Dodgers won in five games). 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the more times they give me the ball the happier I am," Stewart 
said. "But this way worked in the playoffs and whatever works is okay with me. 
I still pitched the clinching game." 
</P>
<P>
Still it would be a mistake to sell the Giants short. Their 3.30 staff ERA was 
third behind only the pitching-rich Dodgers and Mets in the National League. 
And if they were entering this series at full strength -- with Don Robinson, 
Mike LaCoss and Dave Dravecky healthy and with Steve Bedrosian throwing strikes 
-- they could match staffs with almost anyone. 
</P>
<P>
They are not. Manager Roger Craig has kept his staff together despite all kinds 
of problems. He has used 15 different starters, and his No. 1 reliever in 
April, LaCoss, became one of his best starters by August. 
</P>
<P>
His No. 1 starter, Scott Garrelts, was a full-time starter for the first time 
in his career. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants didn't even have a full-time closer until they acquired Bedrosian on 
June 18. But he was very erratic down the stretch, and in the National League 
playoffs picked up three straight saves despite allowing six base runners in 2 
1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
When Craig announced that Garrelts, Reuschel and Robinson would start the first 
three games of the World Series, he added, "After that, we'll see. I don't know 
yet, but that's the way the pitching has been all year." 
</P>
<P>
Craig also knows that what happened in April and July may be irrelevant in 
October, and this month his staff is in its best shape in months. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel, who had slumped for a month, was terrific in Game 5 of the playoffs, 
and Kelly Downs has been outstanding out of the bullpen. He has been so good 
that he might have gotten a start in Game 3 if not for Robinson's bum knee. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson says he's fine once he gets to the mound, but he needs about 20 
minutes to get ready, which makes it impossible to use him in get-ready-quick 
situations out of the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' hope is that all their pitchers will rise to the occasion, 
believing their staff at its best is as good as anyone's. 
</P>
<P>
They're hoping that rumors that Stewart and Welch both have tired arms are 
legitimate and that Garrelts will be sharp, which he was for most of a 14-5 
season. They're hoping that Big Daddy Reuschel's soft junk will give a 
fastball-hitting team fits. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, they're hoping they don't have to go to the bullpen too often. Downs 
has been reliable but Craig Lefferts, Jeff Brantley and Bedrosian have had some 
shaky moments. 
</P>
<P>
"Their pitching is outstanding, but our pitchers have done an outstanding job 
too," Craig said. "We've had some injuries, but we're ready for this series. 
It'll come down to who makes the pitches, keeps the runners close and all that 
stuff. Our guys are capable of doing all those things as well as anyone."

ROCKETS WON'T FIRE WITHOUT OLAJUWON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HUBBARD, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Happy-go-lucky Ray Patterson probably will be his usual happy-go-lucky self 
Thursday. The Rockets' president will go to the office, greet all employees and 
visitors enthusiastically, and in his private moments he will sit and smile ... 
while his franchise continues to go down in flames. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson was in a strange, upbeat mood last week when he learned Akeem 
Olajuwon, his all-interplanetary center, would be unable to play in preseason 
games. That seems to be a weird reason to celebrate and declare, as Patterson 
did, "I'm so enthusiastic, I can't control it." 
</P>
<P>
Patterson claimed to be happy because he had been worried Olajuwon would not be 
ready to play when the regular season begins Nov. 3. Before last week, however, 
Patterson never expressed concern. Obviously he and the Rockets had been 
covering up the seriousness of the thrombophlebitis that forced Olajuwon to be 
hospitalized for eight days in early July. Olajuwon, in fact, had been telling 
close friends he did not expect to play until December. 
</P>
<P>
But now the doctors say he will play, yet Patterson's ecstasy seems premature 
and unrealistic. Olajuwon still is on blood thinners to prevent clotting in his 
left calf and cannot risk contact because something as simple as a Charles 
Barkley knee to the calf might cause hemorrhaging. 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon is allowed to participate in conditioning drills, yet there is little 
doubt that when the season begins he will not be in game shape. And despite 
Patterson's blind optimism: If Akeem has been slowed during the off-season 
because of the leg problem, what will happen during the rigors of the 82-game 
regular season? Does anyone in Houston really believe Akeem will make it 
through the season unscathed? 
</P>
<P>
The Rockets appear to be in a close-your-eyes, keep-your-fingers-crossed and 
hope-for-the-best mode, but it would be rather ignorant to ignore the bleak 
possibility of Olajuwon missing significant time. The Rockets weren't going to 
be a great team with a healthy Olajuwon. Without him at full strength, their 
chances of winning the lottery are better than their chances of winning a 
title. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA and top amateur basketball officials are expected to announce Thursday 
in Colorado Springs that the NBA will join USA Basketball, the new name for the 
governing body of amateur basketball in the country. What will not be announced 
is that there is at least one major area of agreement between the pros and 
amateurs. It is a certainty the coach of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics will be a 
current or former NBA coach. The days of a Bob Knight or John Thompson getting 
the job have ended. 
</P>
<P>
But it will be a while before NBA players play for the U.S. national team. 
Despite public utterings to the contrary, those familiar with negotiations have 
said NBA players will not participate in international events until the 1992 
Olympics. There has been speculation they might play in the 1990 Goodwill Games 
in Seattle or in the 1990 World Championships in Argentina. The NBA wants to 
make a grand entrance into international play, so why play in the World 
Championships, which are an insignificant event in this country? 
</P>
<P>
The World Championships, however, are important everywhere else. And national 
teams in the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia were assured their NBA players could 
return to play for their country. So the Soviet and Yugoslav NBA players 
probably will participate in the 1990 World Championships, which means it is 
unlikely a team of U.S. collegiate players will win. If Danny Ferry and Brian 
Shaw have not signed with NBA teams, however, they would not be under NBA 
jurisdiction and could be on the U.S. team. That would make the World 
Championships interesting. 
</P>
<P>
More evidence that Bill Musselman is firmly in control of the Timberwolves. The 
Lakers have offered two No. 1 picks and center Mark McNamara for Rick Mahorn. 
That's correct. Two No. 1 picks. The Timberwolves have rejected the deal, 
saying it was a collective management decision. But General Manager Billy 
McKinney is a respected basketball man and it is unlikely he would not take two 
No. 1 picks -- no matter how late in the first round those picks will be -- for 
a player with a bad back who is not going to win one game for an expansion 
team. That decision smells of a coach who cannot judge talent and a rookie 
owner, Bob Stein. With Musselman making talent decisions, the Timberwolves' 
long-range prospects are dismal. 
</P>
<P>
Rockets guard Lewis Lloyd missed practice time last week because of a bruised 
foot. Seems Lew was doing a serious number on the dance floor when he felt 
pain. Turns out there was a dime in his shoe, and while doing some sort of 
funky hop, Lew awkwardly came down on his foot. "I kept wondering if anybody 
put it in there intentionally," said Lloyd, who apparently is going to keep 
closer watch. 
</P>
<P>
And Spurs forward Terry Cummings has taken such a liking to Yugoslav forward 
Zarko Paspalj that Cummings is writing and recording a song about Paspalj. 
Can't wait to hear that classic. And neither can Lloyd, who probably will not 
be impressed by the lyrics, but perhaps he will find the beat simply 
irresistible.

INEPT NETS ARE FITCH'S LATEST REBUILDING TASK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
He is where he wants to be on this glorious autumn afternoon, inside a stuffy, 
silent gym talking basketball to people who have learned quickly how to listen. 
</P>
<P>
This is as close as it gets to heaven on earth for Bill Fitch, and it had been 
his calling for 18 consecutive autumns until last October. Training camp had 
always led to the regular season, which usually led to the playoffs and, on one 
occasion, begat a National Basketball Assn. championship. 
</P>
<P>
No active NBA coach has won as much -- or lost as much -- as Fitch, 55. That 
mattered little to the Houston Rockets, who dismissed him after a fractious 
46-36 season in 1987-88. His successor, Don Chaney, went 45-37 and also lost in 
the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Fitch stewed for a while between rounds of golf, fishing trips and visits to 
the bank to cash his Houston paycheck. He also kept his satellite dish and VCR 
on overdrive, testament to his vigilance and confidence that someone would call 
again soon. And someone did -- the New Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, Fitch and his Nets were to meet the Boston Celtics in the Centrum 
in Worcester, Mass., in the exhibition opener for both teams. It was the first 
time Fitch and the man with whom he shared an NBA bench for 11 years, Jimmy 
Rodgers, went head-to-head. 
</P>
<P>
"For Jimmy," said Fitch last week, "this is an entirely different game than it 
is for me. He's got things he wants to look at. I've got things I don't know if 
I want to look at, but I have to. He's already been where I have yet to go." 
</P>
<P>
Over the summer, the movers and shakers of the heretofore hapless Nets surveyed 
the flotsam on their roster, discussed their hopes and expectations, kicked 
Willis Reed upstairs and decided on Fitch, the man who helped revive the 
Celtics and Rockets and who launched the Cleveland Cavaliers from scratch. 
"It's one thing to talk about developing a team and another thing to have 
actually done it. That's a big difference," says Nets General Manager Harry 
Weltman. "We wanted someone who'd done it and someone with toughness who could 
cope with our situation, where we have to fight for our identity." 
</P>
<P>
Says Fitch, between practice sessions at Jadwin Gym, "I guess they caught me in 
the right mood. The situation was right. The timing was right. The people were 
really, really convincing in wanting to have a major league operation and a 
major league program." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Fitch will put his reputation as an ornery Mr. Goodwrench on the line to 
try and achieve just that. It won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
His roster has more question marks than a Dr. Seuss book, and watching the Nets 
is somewhere between flossing teeth and cleaning the basement on the average 
New Jerseyite's list of things to do. 
</P>
<P>
Says Weltman, "Unlike the expansion teams, our problems are different. They at 
least have a base of community and fan support who will wait for the team to 
win. Here, we won't get that support until we do win. It's all backwards. It's 
even more difficult than when we used to draw 3,500 in Cleveland because you 
knew the fans were out there and hungry for a winner." 
</P>
<P>
Every NBA job Fitch has taken has been a "there's nowhere to go but up" 
proposition. He was in on the ground floor in Cleveland, took over the Celtics 
after their 29-53 season in 1978-79 and arrived in Houston in time to 
resuscitate the Rockets after their 14-68 campaign in 1982-83. Although he had 
impressive rookies to ease the transition in Boston and Houston, each situation 
also called for the head coach to provide brains, leadership, discipline and 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets certainly need all of the above, having put together records of 24-58, 
19-63 and 26-56 the past three years. And they have never been known as a model 
of stability either on their roster or in the front office. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, there is only one player, shooting guard Dennis Hopson, who was 
with the Nets for the start of the 1987-88 season. And he was a rookie that 
year. Only three players from the 1986-87 team are still in the NBA. The Nets 
have had six head coaches this decade and, since joining the NBA in 1976, only 
one coach, Kevin Loughery, has lasted as many as three consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
It could take Fitch that long just to get the Nets breathing air instead of 
dirt.

TURPIN PLAYS WEIGHING GAME FOR BULLETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID ALDRIDGE, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
EMMITSBURG, Md. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The story goes that two years ago, when the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Mel 
Turpin to the Utah Jazz, he told Salt Lake City writers he weighed 265 pounds. 
The next day, when players on the team got weighed, he was 282 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Reason? 
</P>
<P>
"I like airplane food," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So you may think it's funny that the Washington Bullets have signed Turpin, a 
6-foot-11 free agent center, and you may smirk at the reported $180,000 he has 
been fined for being overweight during his career. 
</P>
<P>
Or you could have watched him sweat at the University of Maryland this past 
summer, speed-walking, lifting weights and trying to shed the jokes and the 
pounds that have burdened him since he was traded from Washington to Cleveland 
on draft day 1984. And you could have watched him report to camp at 263 pounds, 
his lowest weight since he was at the University of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the hardest camp I've been in," he said after a Bullets' morning 
workout at Mount St. Mary's. "But it's good for you. It gets you in better 
shape. ... I can go out there and play a lot better, last longer, and get more 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
There are two likely spots open on Washington's roster, and Turpin, Doug Roth 
and Ed Horton are looking to fill them. 
</P>
<P>
He should be used to the grind. He's been having two-a-days all summer, working 
at Maryland with Brad Hatfield, an associate professor with a degree in 
exercise science. Turpin's four-man team helped shave 22 pounds from his frame 
in eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But all that work means nothing-and he acknowledges this-if the weight returns. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't come here weighing 286 and doing the stuff we're doing now," he 
said. "I'm happy I've got my weight down, and I'm lasting. I'm going through 
both practices. I feel pretty strong." 
</P>
<P>
People close to him think this is his last shot, considering what's happened in 
his past. That's included tours in Cleveland, Utah and a one-year stint in 
Zaragoza, Spain. All have been marred by weight problems, one reason that 
Turpin, at 28, is trying to make a roster instead of being in the prime of a 
solid NBA career. 
</P>
<P>
When he left Kentucky, he was probably as good or better a pro prospect as any 
on a team that included Sam Bowie and Kenny Walker, and he helped the Wildcats 
reach the Final Four in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
But his problems started there too. He had gone to Lexington at 190 pounds and 
left at 270. The Wildcats showed him how to put weight on, he said, but 
couldn't offer any solutions for how to keep it off. 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets took him with the sixth pick overall. But they were looking for 
scoring to complement Rick Mahorn and Gus Williams, so a deal with Cleveland 
was already in the works. Washington got Cliff Robinson, the draft rights to 
Tim McCormick and cash for Turpin. 
</P>
<P>
Turpin said he was hurt by the trade, but he played pretty well in his first 
two seasons with the Cavaliers, averaging 12 points a game on 52 percent 
shooting from the floor. In his second season he set a team record with 54 
percent shooting and finished second in rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
But there were problems. Some of them were with then-coach George Karl. Some of 
them were because of lackadaisical defense and rebounding. His battle with the 
bulge was close to a standoff, but he gained more than he lost, and the fines 
began. 
</P>
<P>
By 1987 his minutes had been cut by more than half and in October of that year 
he was sent to Utah. He again had nights of promise, but the Jazz didn't weigh 
him until almost midseason, and they were disappointed when they did. To this 
day, it's hard to find anyone in the Utah organization who has a kind word for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Utah released him at the end of the year and he went to the Zaragoza team; in 
return, the Jazz got Jose Ortiz out of the last two years of his contract in 
Spain and he went to Utah. No one wants to call it a trade, but that's what it 
was. 
</P>
<P>
Enter the Bullets, who were interested in Turpin even before the Jazz dealt 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"We had lengthy discussions," General Manager Bob Ferry said. "We talked to 
him. We even got to the point where I think we were negotiating. ... Basically, 
the scouting report on him is known to everybody. He's a very good offensive 
player. He runs the court well. He's a good athlete." 
</P>
<P>
Turpin's contract with the Bullets has no weight clause, but is full of 
incentives for him to keep his weight reasonable. And like everyone else, he 
will be weighed every day. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people, everything they eat turns to body fat, and some people burn it 
off," Ferry said. "He's just one of those people (that) to make it and stay in 
the NBA, he's probably going to have to continue to diet and train year-round 
the rest of his career. It's not hard if you want to do it. You need 
discipline."

2-YEAR-OLD CONSERVANCY BECOMES WHITTIER'S MOST VOCAL ADVERSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bumper sticker on Helen Rahder's car puts it quite plainly: "Think 
Globally, Act Locally." 
</P>
<P>
And for two years Rahder and other vocal members of the Whittier Conservancy 
have followed that motto with fervor and determination. 
</P>
<P>
The preservationist organization virtually arose from the rubble of the Oct. 1, 
1987, earthquake, holding its first meeting within a week to plan a march and 
other efforts to pressure the city to preserve historic buildings that were 
badly damaged. As more and more buildings were demolished, more residents 
joined the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the group, which claims to have a core of 30 members and a mailing list 
of 700, is the most vocal residents' organization in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy's form of activism is often controversial and eyebrow-raising. 
Rahder, who displays a biting wit, has no qualms about lashing out at city 
officials. "They would bulldoze all the historic buildings and put up ugly 
pink-stucco apartments, and then we would look like Orange County," Rahder, the 
group's issues coordinator and a founder, said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
When an important issue concerning historic preservation is before the City 
Council, members inundate city officials with letters voicing their opinions. 
The group has no problem packing a City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the group's core members, which include several lawyers, 
archeologists and historians, are well-versed on the state laws and local 
zoning codes, forcing city officials to take notice of what they are saying. 
The conservancy has sued the city twice, and won both times, in efforts to save 
two historic buildings damaged in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials cringe at the mention of the conservancy. Privately, they 
sometimes describe members of the citizens' group as wild-eyed 
preservationists. The irritation of council members at the conservancy members' 
forceful, sometimes insulting demeanor is obvious at meetings. Officials roll 
their eyes, tap their pens, look at the clock. 
</P>
<P>
"Their methods are just not correct," Mayor Victor Lopez said. "They try to 
mislead people; They say we don't care about the community." 
</P>
<P>
Others offer more diplomatic assessments. They say public comments are 
important to city government. Some city officials say they realize that the 
group will continue to be a vocal -- and important -- force in the community, 
which for years was without such activism. 
</P>
<P>
"They are very eloquent," Councilman Myron Claxton said. "They have a real good 
understanding of what's going on. The more interest in the community, the 
better, even though we disagree on things." 
</P>
<P>
The disagreements between members of the conservancy and city officials often 
have centered on one thing: money. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy members believe the city has a responsibility to spend public money 
to save the community's historic buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"We are fighting to save the gradual denigration of Whittier," said John Smith, 
the vice president of the conservancy. "The older people say they are feeling 
robbed of their heritage. The young say they (city officials) are destroying 
the thing that makes Whittier unique." 
</P>
<P>
Rahder added: "California is a sea of stucco tract homes and mini-malls. But 
Whittier is different. That's what we are trying to save. That's why we are 
here." 
</P>
<P>
City officials say they would like to accommodate the conservancy's desire to 
save historic buildings, but the effort would cost too much. 
</P>
<P>
"I recognize the importance of conservation," Claxton said. "But we've got to 
be realistic about things. The city is just not made of money." 
</P>
<P>
Recently the group lost two major battles, largely because of finances. 
</P>
<P>
In September, the City Council voted against a proposal to reface the Harvey 
Apartments, destroyed in the Oct. 1, 1987, earthquake, with the original, 
100-year-old bricks. To do so would have cost about $50,000, the project 
architect told the council. 
</P>
<P>
The city offered to come up with half the money if local preservationists came 
up with the rest. When the conservationists failed to raise the money, the City 
Council gave the architect permission to stucco the building, a less costly 
method than using the bricks. The city then decided to use the bricks to build 
other structures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vote Was Unanimous 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, the conservancy suffered a major setback when the City 
Council voted unanimously to demolish the historic Whittier Theater, at 
Whittier Boulevard and Hadley Street. Council members voted without comment, 
but previously expressed concern over the cost of saving the theater. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy had obtained a court order two years ago stopping the city from 
demolishing the historic film palace until an environmental impact report was 
conducted. Conservancy officials said they will return to court in an effort to 
stop the demolition. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the two recent losses, the conservancy has accomplished much in the 
past two years, city officials acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The activists have been instrumental in persuading the city to allow only 
single-family houses to be built in much of the Uptown area, where developers 
were trying to demolish old, earthquake damaged homes and build apartment 
complexes in their place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Park Historic District 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy also was influential in persuading the city to declare the area 
around Central Park as a historic district. The homes there cannot be altered 
without approval from the city. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the group has stressed the importance of conducting environmental 
impact reports before the buildings are razed or new development started. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not out to save every old brick and piece of wood in the city," Rahder 
said. "What we are trying to save is our quality of life before someone rips it 
out from under us. 
</P>
<P>
"If we care enough about the local environment, it will have a domino effect on 
the larger picture -- the state, national or global level. It all starts at 
home."

SOVIET, U.S. PANELISTS TRADE GAGS IN SUMMIT TALKS ON POLITICAL WIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's in: bureaucrats, punks, pollution, stone-washed jeans, Stalin. What's 
out: Gorby, glasnost, Americans. 
</P>
<P>
What's fair game for roasting nowadays in the Soviet Union was the hot topic at 
a symposium aimed at assessing the state of the wit in the two countries and 
how humor reflects social and cultural values. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one more step in demystifying the 'Evil Empire,' " said American 
stand-up comedian Paul Krassner, who sat on a discussion panel recently at 
Antioch University Southern California in Marina del Rey. Also on the panel 
were American professors of humor and visiting Soviet humor magazine editors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2-Day Visit 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet editors stopped on the Westside for two days as part of the second 
Soviet-American Exchange of Humorists. The traveling humor summit, which also 
ventured to Virginia, Nebraska and New York state in its two weeks, was 
sponsored by the semi-satirical International Assn. of Professional 
Bureaucrats, a Washington-based organization that, according to its president, 
Jim Boren, is dedicated to dynamic inaction. The exchange also was held at UCLA 
with another panel featuring George Carlin. Next year, Americans will head to 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The first such round of visits, in 1987 and 1988, included Americans Art 
Buchwald and Jim Berry. 
</P>
<P>
Political satire is the primary form of humor in the Soviet Union, and the 
Soviet delegation reflected that. Represented were three official publications 
that conferees likened to National Lampoon and England's Punch and Private Eye. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow-based Krokodil (crocodile), the largest humor magazine in the Soviet 
Union, is published every 10 days; its circulation is 5.3 million, out of the 
country's 287 million people. Editor Leonid Florentiev said the magazine, like 
its namesake, "bites, as a humor magazine should." 
</P>
<P>
The two other magazines have equally pointed names: Peretz (pepper), from the 
Ukraine, and Pikker (a lance), from Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
Glasnost, or openness, has affected almost everything in Soviet life including 
what gets a laugh, said Florentiev, at 35 among the youngest of Krokodil's 16 
editors. Florentiev said censorship exists only "inside our editors in chief, . 
. . and that decides whether the magazine is brave or not brave." But, he said, 
"your psychology cannot change overnight." 
</P>
<P>
Current targets for roasting include individual politicians -- dead and alive 
-- and the Communist Party, the visitors said, and their magazines snipe at 
certain ministers for incompetence and the Central Committee for its posh 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet government's penchant for secrecy provides fodder as well. One joke 
making the rounds recently has former Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko asking 
Leonid Brezhnev, "What do we do about these foreign correspondents, who lie 
about us?" 
</P>
<P>
Brezhnev replies: "If they're lies, they're OK. But if they start speaking the 
truth, get them out of the country in 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fertile Fields 
</P>
<P>
Satirists also aim at corruption, vice, alcoholism, crime and environmental 
problems as well as the black market, Florentiev said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Krokodil cartoon shows devils stirring a vat of stone-washed jeans, 
the latest craze in the Soviet Union. Harvey Mindess, an Antioch professor of 
psychology of humor who coordinated the visitors' Westside stay, said he sees a 
difference in what gets a laugh among Soviets just since the last conference 
two years ago. Discussing Playboy's bawdy humor, for example at that time made 
the Soviet delegation uneasy. This time, they roared. And Kaido Liiva, 
editor-in-chief of Pikker, showed some risque cartoons from his own magazine.

These Soviet humorists -- except for editor Andrey Benyukh -- were not the same 
delegates that attended two years ago. According to Krassner, even the body 
language this time was looser. "They kept whispering to each other the last 
time, to make sure they were following party line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As in America, the Soviets have some old standards. 
</P>
<P>
An old woman is sitting on a Moscow street corner, with an empty shopping bag. 
"I've become so old, I don't remember -- did I go to the store, or am I going 
to the store?" Benyukh, Krokodil deputy foreign editor, said the joke is 
decades old but "now the (shortage) situation is so bad, that (it) is up to 
date." 
</P>
<P>
Underground jokes have sprouted above ground. Liiva told of a Soviet emigre 
waiting at an airport. As he waits for his flight, he hears an announcement: 
"The party delegation is leaving for abroad." A bit later, there's another 
announcement: "The delegation from the Youth Communist League is leaving." The 
man waits some more; the next announcement is, "The trade union delegation is 
leaving." The man turns to another would-be emigre and says, "Now it makes 
sense to stay here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Range of Topics 
</P>
<P>
Recent Krokodil issues show the range of humor in Russia: everything from 
cartoons to poetry to articles, poking fun at aging politicians, the Soviet 
drug problem, rock music, artists and liubers, gangs of hooligans from the 
suburbs who beat up Muscovites. 
</P>
<P>
A punker has a scrub-brush for a Mohawk. A long-haired hippie with beads and a 
peace-sign chain meditates -- picturing a cooked chicken. There is even a Gary 
Larson cartoon of two fleas on a dog's back, checking a map of the dog that 
tells them, "You are here." 
</P>
<P>
 Glasnost has made some humor passe. Benyukh gave as an example the tale about 
three Russians sitting on a park bench. The first one sighs; the second one 
says, 'Oh," and the third says: "Are you crazy? You have to really be more 
careful in expressing your political views." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-Western attacks have stopped, Florentiev said. "Our readers are pretty fed 
up with that kind of stuff," he said, adding that if the magazine wants to take 
stabs at the West, it now uses American cartoons for that. Ethnic jokes are 
out, because of the y situation with the various nationalities in the Soviet 
Union that have increased their calls for autonomy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The editors say their job has become more difficult in some ways because under 
glasnost, newspapers also are doing satire. "The competition is much greater 
than we had before," Florentiev said. 
</P>
<P>
Before, the humor magazines stood alone, and "it was easy to be on top of the 
interests of the audience. Now, everybody seems to be very sharp," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Glasnost-era humor does have its sacred cows, however, among them glasnost 
itself. "I don't feel any euphoria about the situation," Florentiev said. 
"We've got a long way to go before we consider ourselves a real democracy. But 
the change is dramatic, and Mikhail Gorbachev has done a great job." He added 
that the parliament is considering a proposed law that would increase freedom 
of speech, and he thinks it will pass. 
</P>
<P>
Attacking glasnost, therefore, would be suicidal, he said. "If we attack 
glasnost and perestroika, it can be used by the conservatives to undermine 
Gorbachev's influence." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Gorbachev has been spared, though even that is changing. Benyukh 
related this one-liner: Gorbachev was just a party leader before, but now is a 
party leader and president -- "because he understood the impossibility of 
surviving on one salary in our country." 
</P>
<P>
Panelists exchanged jokes about each other's countries. They generally hit the 
other country's funny bone, but some missed. Such as an obscure Soviet story 
about Brezhnev and poet Alexander Pushkin. And an American joke about various 
groups of Soviet citizens waiting for a share of a phantom shipment of oranges. 
The visitors politely laughed but later said it was only "so-so." 
</P>
<P>
Stand-up comics of the American sort are not found in the Soviet Union, said 
the Soviet humorists. Instead, satirical writers read their work -- and fill 
1,000-seat auditoriums, earning 5,000 rubles (about $8,000 on the official 
exchange in the devalued Soviet economy, $500 on the black market) a 
performance, according to the Soviet humorists. 
</P>
<P>
And as for movies and television comedies, Florentiev said, "watching the 
Soviet parliament in session on TV is enough humor." 
</P>
<P>
American comedians known in their country, the Russians said, include Billy 
Crystal (whose recent visit to Moscow was a success, they said), Eddie Murphy, 
Bill Cosby and Art Buchwald (whose articles have run in Pikker and Krokodil). 
Woody Allen has God-like status.

ANOTHER CHAPTER IN COMPTON'S FISCAL TALE; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: COMPTON'S CONTROLLER SAYS HE WAS PLACED ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE 
AFTER DISCLOSING THAT THE CITY HAS A STACK OF UNPAID BILLS, PURCHASE ORDERS AND 
CONTRACTS WORTH BETWEEN $5 MILLION AND $6 MILLION.

The city's embattled controller, who was ordered Monday to stay home from work, 
says some officials are trying to keep him out of his office because they do 
not want to hear the truth about the city's poor financial health. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo to the City Council Tuesday, Controller Timothy Brown said his 
disclosure that the city has $5 million to $6 million in outstanding bills, 
contracts and purchase orders from the previous fiscal year was used as an 
excuse to place him on administrative leave. 
</P>
<P>
"The real issue is that management has overcommitted the financial resources 
currently available," Brown said in his memo. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from his home Tuesday, he said: "Unfortunately, 
sometimes when people get bad news, they want to kill the messenger. Well, 
that's the way I feel." 
</P>
<P>
Brown was ordered to stay home by Acting City Manager Howard Caldwell after 
Brown reported to the manager that there are millions of dollars in leftover 
financial obligations that must be transferred into this year's 
already-strained budget. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council became involved in the rift Tuesday. After a lengthy 
closed-door meeting, council members Maxcy Filer and Jane Robbins attempted to 
pass a motion to put Brown on administrative leave. But the motion failed when 
the other three council members abstained. 
</P>
<P>
The controller returned to his office Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Both Brown and City Treasurer Wesley Sanders continue to insist that the city 
is spending more money than it has. In his memo to the council Tuesday, Brown 
said that as of Oct. 2 the city had about $3.2 million cash on hand, compared 
to about $7 million at about the same time last year. The city's bimonthly 
payroll is about $1 million and weekly expenses are between $200,000 and 
$300,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city regularly gets small amounts of money from such sources as fines, fees 
and sales tax, but, as Brown pointed out in his memo, the city will not receive 
"significant" additional revenues until December when county property tax money 
is apportioned to the municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, who works closely with the controller, said some city officials are 
trying to "railroad" the controller out of City Hall for telling the truth. 
</P>
<P>
"We let the council know last November that they had financial problems," 
Sanders said. "We're about to go broke. That's why (Brown is under fire), not 
because he didn't tell them." 
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure that city employees receive paychecks, Sanders said, 
payments to vendors are being delayed. Purchases approved months ago by the 
council and city manager also have been postponed, Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly a year, Brown has been insisting publicly that the city was headed 
for a fiscal crisis. Last week, the controller reported to the acting manager 
that unpaid obligations from the last fiscal year, which ended June 30, would 
total around $5 million to $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Caldwell insists, however, that he was surprised to learn that. He said he told 
Brown to stay home so that the manager's budget staff could review the 
controller's records in order to confirm whether there are millions of dollars 
in outstanding financial obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Brown says such financial obligations exist because they occur every year. 
Outstanding financial obligations totaled $4.1 million in 1987, and $2.4 
million in 1986, according to Brown's council memo. He did not supply a figure 
for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
State law, Brown says, requires cities to total up the unpaid obligations from 
the previous fiscal year. These obligations then are included in the new 
budget, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most cities pass a resolution sometime between August and December, he said, 
and amend their budgets by shifting money from the reserve account into the 
operating fund. In Compton's case, however, there are no reserves, Brown said.

WHITTIER VOTES TO RAZE HISTORIC THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously last week to demolish the historic Whittier 
Theater, closing the final curtain after two years of emotional public debate 
over whether the city can afford to save the crumbling, Depression-era film 
palace. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge may save the building by refusing to lift an 
injunction that for two years has prevented the city from demolishing the movie 
house. The court will examine a recently completed environmental impact report. 
City officials said the report clearly supports the demolition. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago attorneys for the Whittier Conservancy obtained the injunction 
after successfully arguing in court that the city must conduct an environmental 
impact report before razing the theater, which was damaged in the Oct. 1, 1987, 
earthquake and then partially bulldozed by a city wrecking crew. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-style theater was built in 1929 at Whittier Boulevard and Hadley 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Whittier Conservancy, the group fighting to save the old 
theater, said the environmental impact study is inadequate because it does not 
explore ways the theater could be rehabilitated. Members said they will try to 
persuade the judge not to lift the injunction. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully the judge will recognize that the EIR is incomplete," said Helen 
Rahder, spokeswoman for the Whittier Conservancy. "The EIR could have been a 
McDonald's menu and the City Council would not have known the difference." 
</P>
<P>
But, in the end, Rahder said she believes the theater will be demolished 
anyway. "It's simply a city policy decision," she said. "The theater is going 
down over our dead bodies." 
</P>
<P>
After listening to two hours of heated public testimony from historical 
preservationists, officials said privately that the decision to destroy the 
building was based on one thing: money. To rehabilitate the theater, the city 
would have to heavily subsidize the project. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you want to subsidize this project or put the money to some other use?" 
City Atty. James Markman asked the council. "It comes down to public money." 
</P>
<P>
For two years council members have said that they would not subsidize the 
theater, which could cost the city $1.6 million to $3.4 million for acquisition 
and rehabilitation, plus an additional $500,000 annually to operate. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not in the business of spending a lot of money to restore a badly 
damaged theater," Councilman Gene Chandler said. "We have better places to 
spend our money." 
</P>
<P>
About 20 people -- including historical enthusiasts from Los Angeles, Pasadena, 
Santa Barbara and San Bernardino -- spoke out on the importance of saving the 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
"The theater could be a jewel in our crown," said Peter Holliday, an art and 
architectural history professor at Cal State San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the film palace, designed like the court of a Spanish hacienda, is 
one of a few remaining examples of a once-popular style of theater architecture 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"Interestingly, it is the kind of theater that some developers are now trying 
to re-establish," Holliday said. "We have a chance to keep what other cities 
are trying to imitate." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to historical value, the theater also has emotional value as well, 
Holliday and several other people told the council. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in Whittier and the Whittier Theater is where many of us first saw 
certain movies," Holliday said. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents reminisced about the interesting design of the inside of the 
theater. Painted clouds and lights that looked like stars decorated the 
ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
"If you got bored with the movie you could always look up at the ceiling," one 
resident told the council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP The city attorney will ask a Superior Court judge to review the EIR 
and lift an injunction prohibiting the demolition of the historic theater. If 
the injunction is lifted, a wrecking crew will raze the building. City 
officials said it could take several months for a judge to rule on the matter.

GUIDE TO REPAIRS FOR DO-IT-YOURSELF OWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The homeowner confronted by minor repairs might get some help from a book 
designed for beginning do-it-yourselfers. 
</P>
<P>
"Small Home Repairs Made Easy," an 88-page manual, is edited by Robert L. 
Berko, executive director of the nonprofit Consumer Education Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
The illustrated paperback lists step-by-step directions on how to do 
around-the-house repairs. According to Berko, such mysteries as unstopping the 
toilet, fixing the doorbell and repairing the garage door are within the 
capability of even the most unskilled. 
</P>
<P>
The book can be ordered for $6.50, including postage, from the Consumer 
Education Research Center, 350 Scotland Road, Orange, N.J. 07050, or by calling 
(800) 872-0121.

SOURCES OF NATIVE PLANTS AROUND THE SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, TIMES GARDEN EDTIOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those who know California's native plants also know that fall is the best time 
to plant them, so it is not too surprising that most of the special sales of 
native plants -- by botanic gardens and other groups -- occur during the autumn 
months. (Natives are hard to find at general nurseries because they look 
terrible in containers). Here are some sales coming up: 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton: Every weekend from now through mid-December, the Fullerton Arboretum 
will be having their weekend plant sales, which among other things, will 
feature drought-tolerant plants and California natives from the Tree-of-Life 
Nursery. They also offer to special order any plant you are looking for. Hours 
are from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturdays and 1 to 4 p.m. Sundays. The arboretum is 
located at the northeast corner of the California State University campus, on 
Associated Road, in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara: Santa Barbara Botanic Garden's fall sale is Oct. 21, from 12:30 
to 2:30 p.m., and will feature drought-tolerant plants from all of the world, 
but especially California natives, including the beautiful but hard to find 
bulbs, perennials and iris. The botanic garden is on 1212 Mission Canyon Road 
in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Claremont: Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden holds its annual plant sale Nov. 4, 
from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. They will also have other drought-resistant Mediterranean 
plants as well as natives. You can even purchase three endangered California 
species, which the botanic garden is propagating. A booklet on their care comes 
with each plant. The entrance to the garden is at 1500 North College Ave. in 
Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Valley: The Theodore Payne Foundation will hold its fall plant 
sale on Nov. 4, from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. It is located at 10459 Tuxford St., 
Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Mountains: The Santa Monica Chapter of the California Native Plant 
Society, will hold (rain or shine) a special sale of native plants on Nov. 18 
and 19, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., at Calamigos Ranch, on Mulholland Highway, 500 
yards west of Kanan-Dume Road, in the Santa Monica Mountains.

THE CASE STUDY HOUSES: 1946-1963 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here is a list of the 24 Case Study Houses that were built and the architects 
who built them. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the architects who designed Case Study Houses are dead, including some 
of the more famous, such as Richard Neutra, Charles and Ray Eames, Eero 
Saarinen, Quincy Jones and Raphael Soriano. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen are still living, and several are still in practice, including Pierre 
Koenig in Brentwood and Ed Killingsworth in Long Beach. Craig Ellwood lives in 
Tuscany, Italy, and teaches one semester a year at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney Smith, John Rex and Kemper Nomland Jr. have retired. Ralph Rapson, 
Calvin Straub and Beverly Thorne have moved from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
1946: 540 Barrington Ave., Brentwood. J. R. Davidson. The first Case Study 
House, since destroyed, was small but ingeniously planned, without an inch of 
wasted space in its innovative open plan. 
</P>
<P>
1947: 857 Chapea Road, Pasadena. Spaulding &amp; Rex. In the second Case Study 
House, the basic open floor plan, with the living areas separating the parents' 
and children's bedrooms, was developed as a prototype that became the standard 
for many following houses. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 9945 Beverly Grove Drive, Beverly Hills. Rodney A. Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 7861 Woodrow Wilson Drive, Hollywood. Rodney A. Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 199 Chautauqua Blvd., Pacific Palisades. Rodney A. Walker. 
</P>
<P>
(These three houses, by Walker, pioneered a simplified wood-frame construction 
made up of standard 3-foot modules intended as a model for low-cost housing.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- 711 San Rafael Ave., Pasadena. Nomland &amp; Nomland. Set in a picturesque 
eucalyptus grove, this house features a simple shed roof and long walls of 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 4755 Lasheart Drive, La Canada Flintridge. J. R. Davidson. This small and 
simple dwelling is another example of the Case Study House urge to create 
standard and repeatable plans for low-cost houses. 
</P>
<P>
1948: 6236 N. Deerfield Ave., San Gabriel. Thornton M. Abell. A blank concrete 
block wall screens the house from its suburban street to create a private 
interior environment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 219 Chautauqua Blvd., Pacific Palisades. Richard Neutra. This house 
continued the innovations Neutra had incorporated in a number of his pre-World 
War II two-bedroom houses, including the ground-hugging horizontal emphasis and 
the deep and sheltering roof overhangs. 
</P>
<P>
1949: 13187 Chalon Road, Brentwood. Wurster &amp; Bernardi. An H-shaped plan 
divides the living from the sleeping wings with a central porch that is also 
the entry. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 203 Chautauqua Blvd., Pacific Palisades. Charles Eames. The most famous 
Case Study House, the Eames house uses off-the-shelf industrial structural 
components in a style that later became known as high-tech. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 201 Chautauqua Blvd., Pacific Palisades. Eames and Saaarinen. Surprisingly 
restrained in its structural expression, Entenza's own house lacks the boldness 
of the Eames house next door. 
</P>
<P>
1950: 1080 Ravoli Drive, Pacific Palisades. Raphael Soriano. In the first study 
house built of steel, Soriano pioneered the standardized system he used on many 
later projects. 
</P>
<P>
1952: 1811 Bel Air Road, Bel-Air. Craig Ellwood. 
</P>
<P>
1955: 9554 Hidden Valley Road, Beverly Hills. Craig Ellwood. The house has 
since been altered. 
</P>
<P>
1957: 1129 Miradero Road, Beverly Hills. Craig Ellwood. 
</P>
<P>
(The design of the three houses above by Ellwood followed in Soriano's 
footsteps with steel-framed dwellings that allowed long spans free of columns 
and clear interior spaces with low partition walls or storage units. The 
Miradero Road house has been altered.) 
</P>
<P>
1958: 2275 Santa Rosa Ave., Altadena. Straub &amp; Hensman. Adapting the 
standardized, factory-built systems developed for steel framing, this 
wood-framed home for famed designer Saul Bass is warmer in feeling than the 
colder steel houses. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 9036 Wonderland Park Ave., Hollywood. Pierre Koenig. 
</P>
<P>
1959: 1635 Woods Drive, Hollywood. Pierre Koenig. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig, like Ellwood and Soriano, was fascinated by the lightness and openness 
a steel frame allowed in house design, enhanced by the dramatic possibilities 
of perching a house on the edge of a precipice. 
</P>
<P>
1960: Three houses: 2329, 2342 and 2343 Rue de Ann, La Jolla. Killingsworth, 
Brady &amp; Smith. This triad of houses in the hills marked the Case Study 
program's move toward planning communities as well as single-family houses. 
Closely grouped, the homes offer a unique insight into what an entire Case 
Study House neighborhood or tract might have looked like. The house at 2343 Rue 
de Ann has been altered. 
</P>

PUSHING BOUNDARIES;

IN AN ERA WHEN THERE'S NOT A LOT OF TRAFFIC IN WRITING FOR BANDS, BILL HOLMAN'S 
CAREER IS STEADY -- AND THE JAZZ KEEPS PERCOLATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When he was a teen-ager, Bill Holman felt that he had a thing for mainstream 
big-band writing, and time has proven he knew what he was talking about. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the distinguished composer/arranger/bandleader has contributed 
hundreds of charts, as big-band arrangements are called, to large ensembles led 
by Stan Kenton, Woody Herman, Buddy Rich and Doc Severinsen's Tonight Show 
Orchestra, as well as to college groups and his own band. And though there's 
not a lot of traffic in composing and arranging for bands these days, Holman, a 
native of Orange County, still gets plenty of work, both here and in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, my career is solid, but not spectacular," he said, his hirsute face 
typically deadpan before he broke into a peal of gentle, self-effacing 
laughter. 
</P>
<P>
"The phone is still ringing," he continued, sitting in the living room of the 
Hollywood home he shares with his wife, Gaye. "There's always something to do. 
I could do more, but I'm pretty comfortable at this level, because with the 
kind of music I'm writing, I don't like to rush." 
</P>
<P>
Holman's jobs range from an occasional chart for Severinsen to a commission 
from a college ensemble to yearly contracts to write music for and appear with 
the West German Radio Network band in Cologne. He works at the piano in his 
downstairs studio, approaching each task painstakingly. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea for a tune or arrangement starts with me just thinking about it, 
letting it percolate," said Holman, 62. "Then I'll get a lick here, a lick 
there, try out a chord progression, either end up rejecting it or using it, and 
so on." 
</P>
<P>
He always keeps the requirements of the designated ensemble uppermost in his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, now I'm working on a commission for the jazz band at Elmhurst 
College outside Chicago," said Holman, who leads his band today at the Count 
Basie Ballroom of the Compton Lazben Hotel in Compton. "I did one for them last 
year that they liked, and that the band director, Doug Beach, said they played 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"So he wants another piece, kind of an opener, a hot up-tempo piece which I 
seem to have a reputation for," he went on, smiling at the thought. "I asked 
him who his strong soloists were, and what the capabilities of the various 
sections were. For example, here I'm not writing the trumpet parts too high." 
</P>
<P>
Wailing trumpet parts are just what Severinsen wants Holman for -- he has 
crafted about 30 arrangements for the flamboyant brassman/celebrity. One of 
these, a version of Billy Strayhorn's "Take the 'A' Train," garnered Holman a 
1987 Grammy for Best Instrumental Arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
"Doc likes to be featured with or over the ensemble, and since the tunes are 
for the "Tonight" show, they have to be fairly exciting," said Holman, whose 
ensemble is spotlighted on "the Bill Holman Band" (JVC Records.) 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his present compositional direction, Holman thought for a moment, 
and said, "I'm trying to push the boundaries a little and still keep the jazz 
feel, which to me means 'human sounding.' I'm getting away from the things that 
came out of the dance band-jazz band style, like familiar chord progressions 
and textures, sort of trying combinations of different instruments. . . . I 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
He paused again, frustrated at the difficulty of explaining. "Music itself 
doesn't translate into words at all, but we're talking about techniques, which 
if I were a little more verbal, I might be clearer about." 
</P>
<P>
Then he continued. "I always used to try to approach jazz writing as 
improvising, keeping that quality about it," he said. "But with pushing the 
boundaries, I'm starting to get less of the improvised feel. I'm not entirely 
sure that's the way I want to go, but I'm kind of going that way to see if it 
works out." 
</P>
<P>
Though Holman doesn't write every day, he would like to. "It helps to write 
steadily," he said. "If I let a couple of weeks go by, it's like pulling teeth 
to get started. I feel totally divorced from the whole process. Music? Me? 
Actually, the first couple of days after a break are hard, but then you get 
into it." 
</P>
<P>
A good work day would find Holman putting in four hours, he said. "I'd be happy 
with that, but if I did six, I'd feel more like I was pulling my weight. Still, 
there are always distractions . . . the phone, having to send out charts, 
writing bills." 
</P>
<P>
Holman, who also plays tenor saxophone, is mostly self-taught, though he did 
study arranging and composition at the Westlake School of Music in Hollywood 
from 1948 to 1951. Soon he was working with bands led by Charlie Barnet and 
Kenton, and it was for the latter, between 1952 and 1954, that he first 
established himself as a first class composer and arranger whose charts swung 
like mad, yet had a provocative quality. 
</P>
<P>
Playing with Kenton also provided Holman with the opportunity to get to know 
one of his idols, the great saxophonist Zoot Sims, who had first made an 
impression on Holman when he was with Woody Herman's "be-bop band" in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been getting more and more into Zoot and hoped to meet him someday," 
Holman recalled with a nostalgic smile. "Then when Stan was in New York, we had 
an off night, and Zoot was playing somewhere, and I said, 'I'm gonna go meet 
him.' I was scared because he had this scowl, a penetrating look that made him 
seem fierce. I introduced myself, and he turned out to be this gentle guy, 
really soulful. I never expected that. We had a great time." 
</P>
<P>
Sims and Holman deepened their friendship when Sims joined Kenton for a year in 
1953. "In 1953, Zoot joined Stan's band, and at that time, the band was 
traveling in cars, and he got assigned to my car, which was always referred to 
as 'the Space Car,' " Holman said, chortling. 
</P>
<P>
From the mid-'50s until the mid-'60s, Holman worked both as a saxophonist in 
small bands with drummers Shelly Manne and with Mel Lewis, where he was 
co-leader of the band, and with trumpeters Conte Candoli and Shorty Rogers. But 
the lack of work for jazz players in the burgeoning studio scene made him place 
his emphasis on his writing. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I had to make a choice," he said. "It was either learn four or five 
other instruments so I could compete in the studio scene, or become a writer. 
And I didn't consider myself a good enough player that I could make it as a 
jazz tenor saxophonist." 
</P>
<P>
After recording his tunes with studio ensembles on a few LPs, such as the 
recently re-released "In a Jazz Orbit" (Andex) and "The Fabulous Bill Holman" 
(Coral), in 1975 Holman decided to jump in with both feet and form his own 
band. The band has been rehearsing at the Musicians Union Local 47 on Vine 
Street in Hollywood almost every week since he started it, but engagements have 
been considerably less regular. Still, Holman manages to accentuate the 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it's great we made the record" on JVC, he said. "And last month we 
played at the Monterey Jazz Festival, which was another first. Things that 
haven't happened before keep happening. And I've talked with the people at JVC 
about doing another record after the first of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Saying his home life is "super -- Gaye and I get along great," Holman seems 
satisfied with his musical milieu. "My career is pretty much what it is," he 
said matter-of-factly. "I don't imagine it's going to build a lot from here. 
I'm just fortunate there are still a lot of jazz bands out there."

Far-right French politician Claude Autant-Lara, who outraged France and the 
European Parliament with anti-Semitic comments, must stand trial for his 
remarks, court sources in Grasse, France, said. The case was brought last month 
after the 88-year-old former film director was quoted as denying the World War 
II Holocaust and regretting that the Nazi genocide had "missed" Simone Veil, a 
Jew and former president of the Strasbourg-based Parliament.

A woman who allegedly tried to sell her 2-month-old child to two different 
couples for $3,000 has been charged with child neglect. Clay County Prosecutor 
Richard Facemire said Lena Lynn Romine, 22, was charged with the misdemeanor 
offense because there are no state laws specifically prohibiting the selling of 
children. "It's clear that it's neglect of a child and it's abuse," the 
prosecutor said. "A child isn't . . . a horse or a cow you can sell and trade." 
The prosecutor said the court granted his motion to remove the child from 
Romine's custody.

Satellite-gathered data on weather, crops and environmental damage will be 
crucial in avoiding world famine in the 21st Century, an Ohio lawmaker said in 
urging support for U.S. Earth-observation programs. Rep. Tony P. Hall (D-Ohio) 
said satellites "are basic tools for humanity in the search for solutions to 
hunger." But according to a report, funding for the primary U.S. satellite 
program, Landsat, is in doubt. Hall, chairman of the House Select Committee on 
Hunger, said the study, "Satellite Technology and World Food Security," offers 
"clear evidence that any loss of our satellite capability will directly affect 
our ability to avert famine."

About 100 people, many of them using metal detectors, combed corn and bean 
fields in northwest Iowa and found more missing pieces of United Airlines 
Flight 232, the jet that crash-landed in Sioux City in July. The search was 
organized by General Electric Co., which manufactured a jet engine suspected of 
exploding and damaging the DC-10's hydraulic lines, causing the flight crew to 
lose almost all control of the aircraft. A number of small pieces of the jet 
engine were found. Janice Sorenson earlier in the week was given a $116,000 
reward by General Electric for finding a titanium engine disk.

A Sacramento man whom police sought in the drive-by killing of a 6-year-old

his lawyer into the Hall of Justice. He was booked into the county jail on a 
charge of first-degree murder and held without bail until arraignment next 
week. Leticia Gonzales was killed and her mother, Esperanza Gonzales, 24, and 
aunt, Katrina Richards, 27, were wounded Tuesday night when gunfire was sprayed 
from a car into a group of people standing at Northgate Park. The women were 
talking with two men, known to be gang members, who police believe were the

DETECTIVE ACCUSED OF OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE

A woman detective with the Sacramento Police Department has been charged with 
illegally using police computers to help her body-builder boyfriend in a 
steroid sales scheme. Vicki Romani, 31, who has been released on bail, is 
charged with conspiring with William Cambra to unlawfully use the police 
computer and with obstructing justice. Cambra, a former "Mr. California" and 
owner of a health club, was arrested last month on charges of conspiracy, 
possession and sales of anabolic steroids. He pleaded not guilty in U.S. 
District Court in San Diego last week. Authorities accuse Romani of running 
vehicle license checks for Cambra on the police computer to screen possible 
undercover agents investigating his activities. If convicted, Romani could face 
up to five years in state prison.

CIGARETTE BLAMED FOR FIRE THAT KILLED 4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Fire officials blame a smoldering cigarette for a fire that killed a suburban 
family of four. Ironically, Ernest Troutman, 22, and his wife, Brenda, 22, had 
taken down the smoke detector from their upstairs hallway just a few days 
earlier and had failed to put it back, said Sacramento County Fire Marshal 
Michael Dobson. The couple and their sons, John, 4, and Steve, 22 months, were 
asleep when fire broke out in a living room chair of their two-story apartment 
in Rancho Cordova. "They never had a chance," Dobson said.

SMITH WORKED UP AFTER USC WORKS BEARS OVER, 31-15 
</P>

<P>
After dominating their opponent, winning their fifth consecutive game and 
moving into sole possession of first place in the conference race, the USC 
Trojans might have expected a pat on the back from their coach. 
</P>
<P>
Think again. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Smith's reaction to Saturday's 31-15 victory over California was a swift 
kick in the collective rear ends of his players. 
</P>
<P>
After verbally lambasting his Trojans, Smith was still furious when he met with 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
And embarrassed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And ashamed. 
</P>
<P>
Because while USC dominated the Bears physically, they lost in the macho 
department. In a game marred by fights and penalties, the Trojans had one 
player, Junior Seau, kicked out, were penalized 12 times for 137 yards and 
nearly lost the momentum they had gained by racing to a 24-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Our guys played hard," Smith said, "but I am embarrassed of our school, and 
ashamed of our players. That's not the way football should be played. It's a 
lack of discipline and, as head coach, I take full responsibility. It's not 
going to happen again. I can guarantee that." 
</P>
<P>
Smith proceeded to talk about the pluses of a game in which both Leroy Holt and 
Ricky Ervins rushed for more than 100 yards, quarterback Todd Marinovich threw 
for one touchdown and rushed for another and the Trojan defense, No. 1 in the 
nation against the run, played just about to its average, allowing Cal only 40 
net yards rushing on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
But asked if he's concerned about next Saturday's game against top-ranked Notre 
Dame, Smith became incensed again. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have that number of penalties," he said, "we'll get killed, 90-0. This 
Notre Dame team may be the best in 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
Cynics might think Smith's tirade was just another way to psyche his team up 
for next Saturday's showdown, but USC receiver John Jackson doesn't approve. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the coach was overreacting," he said. "Winning this game and moving 
into the conference lead was a big thing. And for the coach to be so negative, 
well, you can see the mood in the locker room now. We're certainly not riding 
on a high." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson got involved in the first big confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
With the Trojans facing a third-and-goal at the Cal seven in the first quarter 
of a scoreless game, Marinovich kept the ball and gained two yards. 
</P>
<P>
But when defensive lineman Rhett Hall appeared to be overzealous in slamming 
Marinovich to the turf, Jackson had words with the Cal defender. 
</P>
<P>
USC was slapped with a personal foul and a 15-yard penalty and had to settle 
for Quin Rodriguez's 37-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
The mood of the day was set. The Trojans would never be caught. Not on the 
scoreboard. Not in penalty yards. 
</P>
<P>
USC moved into a 10-0 advantage in the second quarter when Marinovich, who 
completed 16 of 26 passes for 206 yards with no interceptions, hit Gary Wellman 
with a 32-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
But the offensive star this day was Holt, the often overlooked fullback who 
spends much of his time clearing the way for Ervins, the tailback. 
</P>
<P>
He did that again Saturday, coming up with a key block on Ervins' 10-yard 
scoring run in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Holt also found plenty of holes for himself. He rushed 21 times for 160 
yards, including the 55-yard touchdown run in the third quarter that broke the 
game open. 
</P>
<P>
Ervins also went over the 100-yard mark, picking up 134 in 31 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Even Marinovich got into the act, scoring on a keeper from seven yards out. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Coach Bruce Snyder said before the game that there was little use trying to 
run on the impregnable front wall of the Trojan defense. 
</P>
<P>
He knows his team. 
</P>
<P>
What the Bears got came through the air. Quarterback Troy Taylor got both 
scores on touchdown pass plays to Brian Treggs, for 75 yards in the second 
quarter and 14 in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor followed his second scoring pass by hitting Brent Woodall in the end 
zone for the two-point conversion, and suddenly, the Memorial Stadium crowd of 
52,000 had a reason to look at the scoreboard other than checking on the 
progress of the World Series just down the road. 
</P>
<P>
With still 10 1/2 minutes left after Cal's second touchdown, Snyder went for 
the onside kick. 
</P>
<P>
And almost got it. 
</P>
<P>
The ball appeared to be within the grasp of several Cal players only to have it 
bounce off the face mask of one into the firm grasp of USC's Matt Gee. 
</P>
<P>
That caused the fans, the few hardy who remained, to go back to checking on the 
Oakland Athletics and the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the earlier tension was gone. 
</P>
<P>
So was Seau, who was tossed out for fighting, along with Cal offensive lineman 
Steve Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just one of those stupid things," Seau said. "I've got to learn from 
it. I could have backed out. I should have. I saw two of their guys on one of 
ours and I just went over to make sure he was OK. I got into a little tangle 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys were involved, but it seemed like I stuck out. I felt the 
officials used me as an example to settle things down." 
</P>
<P>
But nothing could settle Smith down. 
</P>
<P>
It course have been worse, though. Imagine what he would have done if the 
Trojans had lost? 
</P>
<P>
USC Notes 
</P>
<P>
USC, ranked 10th before Saturday, is 5-1, 3-0 in conference. Cal falls to 2-4, 
0-3 in the Pac-10. There will be no roses for the Bears again this season. . . 
. USC had 499 yards of total offense to Cal's 288. . . . The Trojans sacked 
Troy Taylor five times. Dan Owens was credited with 2 1/2, Craig Hartsuyker 
with two. . . . Taylor completed 13 of 31 for 248 yards. . . . Brian Treggs 
caught three for 129 yards. . . . Gary Wellman was USC's leading receiver with 
two catches for 60 yards. John Jackson had two for 51. . . . Saturday marked 
the first time since 1985 that two Trojans rushed for 100 yards in the same 
game. Against Stanford that season, Aaron Emanuel had 122 and Fred Crutcher 
105. . . . Ricky Ervins began play Saturday with 547 yards rushing, which 
already put him ahead of last year's season leader, Emanuel, who had 545. . . . 
The Trojans have beaten Cal four in a row, 11 of the last 12 and 26 of 31.

BAYAKOA WINS SPINSTER BY A RECORD 11 1/2 LENGTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bayakoa strengthened her bid to become older mare of the year Saturday, scoring 
a record-breaking 11 1/2-length victory in the Grade I Spinster Stakes at 
Keeneland in Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa, ridden by Laffit Pincay Jr., took the lead at the start and gradually 
put distance between herself and five rivals in winning the $250,000-added race 
over 1 1/8 miles in 1:47 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
It was the largest winning margin in the 34 years of the Spinster, and the 
second-fastest time in the race's history, equaling Track Robbery's mark in 
1982. Numbered Account set the record of 1:47 2/5 in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Goodbye Halo finished second by 1 1/2 lengths over Sharp Dance. Stoneleigh's 
Hope was another three lengths back in fourth before a record Keeneland crowd 
of 28,788. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was worth $172,412, pushing Bayakoa's lifetime earnings to 
$1,061,866. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa returned $2.80, $2.20 and $2.40. Goodbye Halo paid $2.60 and $2.60, and 
Sharp Dance paid 3.80. 
</P>
<P>
Goodbye Halo, a 4-year-old daughter of Halo, stumbled at the gate and an 
anticipated two-horse battle with Bayakoa never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa and Goodbye Halo had met five times this year, with Bayakoa winning 
four times. Goodbye Halo, however, turned in a strong effort in the last 
meeting in defeating her rival by 15 lengths in the Grade II Chula Vista 
Handicap at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Adjudicating and Rhythm, 2-year-old stablemates of Easy Goer, finished 1-2 in 
the $572,000 Champagne Stakes at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
Adjudicating, ridden by Jacinto Vasquez, got to the end of the mile a neck in 
front of his stablemate, ridden by Craig Perret, in 1:37 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
Juvenile fillies also were featured on the program, with Stella Madrid 
overcoming a poor start to win the $294,500 Frizette. 
</P>
<P>
Rhythm and Adjudicating are owned by Ogden Mills Phipps, whose father owns Easy 
Goer, the 3-year-old who is the leading candidate for horse of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In the filly race, Stella Madrid was left at the break, but Angel Cordero put 
her along the rail and into the lead after the first quarter-mile. She was 
never headed and won by a half-length in 1:38 4/5 for the mile. 
</P>
<P>
Western Playboy, winner of the Bluegrass and Jim Beam Stakes, set a stakes 
record and led by as many as 17 lengths in winning the $300,000 Pennsylvania 
Derby at Philadelphia Park. The colt covered the 1 1/8-mile course in 1:47 3/5.

SULLIVAN IS PENALIZED; UNSER JR. WINS RACE

Al Unser Jr., winless since the Long Beach Grand Prix, scored a major financial 
victory Saturday when he drove his backup Lola-Chevrolet to a $252,500 windfall 
in the Marlboro Challenge at Laguna Seca Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
Little's Al win in the 100-mile sprint for the 10 top drivers in the 
Championship Auto Racing Drivers Indy car series was made easier when runner-up 
Danny Sullivan was penalized for spinning his wheels coming out of the pits. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan was given a black flag and called back into the pits for a stop-and-go 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"I never heard of such a thing in the rule book," Sullivan said. "The penalty 
cost me 16 seconds and I lost by four. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you think of that?" Sullivan asked of Unser in the victory circle." 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you," a grinning Unser said. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed the money because my wife is planning a new wing for our house in 
Albuquerque," the winner said. 
</P>
<P>
The Marlboro Challenge is a race held for race winners and pole winners during 
the season, with additional drivers added from the PPG Cup standings to make a 
field of at least 10. 
</P>
<P>
Emerson Fittipaldi, who has already clinched the Indy car championship, was 
running second most of the day until his Penske-Chevy ran out of fuel on the 
last lap. This enabled Sullivan, and then Bobby Rahal, Teo Fabi, Mario 
Andretti, Scott Pruett and Michael Andretti to pass the Brazilian veteran in 
the final two miles. 
</P>
<P>
Two cars, driven by Rick Mears and Arie Luyendyk, failed to finish. Mears had 
brake failure late in the race, and Luyendyk lasted only four laps before 
pitting with electrical failure. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Andretti, who stood to make $400,000 if he won because of a bonus from 
the cigarette sponsor, jumped into the lead with a daring pass of Mears and 
Fittipaldi on the second turn. 
</P>
<P>
Unser was running fourth at the time. He began his move toward the lead by 
passing Fittipaldi for third place on the second lap and set out after Mears. 
On the seventh lap he passed Mears on the outside of the first turn and began 
running down Andretti, who had a five-second lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I passed Rick on the outside," Unser said. "I was surprised when he just 
lifted. I had been working on him for a couple of laps, trying to figure out 
where to get him. He's become a real good road racer. I got him with a pass I 
learned from Teo Fabi at Mid-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"Fabi did it to me to win the race and I learned a lesson. It came in handy 
getting past Rick (Mears). 
</P>
<P>
Five laps later, Unser caught and passed Andretti for the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I passed Michael on top of the corkscrew. I think I surprised him. He never 
expected me to get him there. I was able to get into the corners real well 
today. I hope I can do as well Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the same 10 drivers plus 18 others, will compete in the Champion Spark 
Plug 300-kilometer race, the final event of the CART/PPG 15-race schedule. 
</P>
<P>
All of the drivers in Saturday's race were driving their backup cars and will 
switch into their No. 1 machines today,. 
</P>
<P>
"Our crew is very repeatable in the way they set up my car," Unser said. 
"Actually, I feel like I have three No. 1 cars, instead of a No. 1 and two 
backups." 
</P>
<P>
Unser held a 12-second lead after making his mandatory pit stop, but the close 
of the race became dramatic when Fittipaldi and Sullivan began closing the gap 
by as much as a second a lap. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan ran the fastest lap of the day, 109.335 m.p.h., on the 40th lap of the 
45-lap race. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I was burned up about that penalty and I was taking it out on the 
car," Sullivan said. "They said I was spinning my tires before the car hit the 
ground (off the jacks). I know they warned Michael Andretti about that in the 
past, but I didn't know it was a rule. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it cost me a lot of time, but I would never predict that if I hadn't 
had the penalty that I would have beaten Little Al. Changing the circumstances 
would also change how the cars might have been driven. Al knew he had a 
substantial lead and drove accordingly. If I had been closer, he might have 
driven entirely differently. He drove a fine race and deserved the win. " 
</P>
<P>
Hans Stuck of West Germany drove an all-wheel drive Audi 90 Quattro to an easy 
victory in the International Motor Sports Assn.'s GTO-GTU race earlier in the 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Stuck's win over his Audi teammate, Hurley Haywood, denied the Mercury Cougar 
team of Pete Halsmer and Wally Dallenbach Jr. the opportunity of winning the 
individual championship until next Sunday's final race at Del Mar during the 
Camel Southern California Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
Halsmer, who finished fifth, holds an eight-point margin over Dallenbach, 188 
to 180, with Stuck still in the running with 170. A win at Del Mar is worth 20 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Alesi of France debuted a Ferrari in the GTO series, and finished after 
briefly leading at the start of the one-hour preliminary event.

<P>
GAME OF THE DAY 
</P>
<P>
Washington (3-2) at New York Giants (4-1), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants were making an early move to run away with the NFC East until 
Philadelphia rallied last week to beat them in the final minutes, and now the 
Redskins can bring New York back to the pack. Washington had a comeback of its 
own last week behind Mark Rypien, scoring 17 points in the fourth quarter to 
beat Phoenix. The Redskins had the Giants beaten in the season opener until a 
fumble by Gerald Riggs led to a 27-24 victory for New York. Giant Lawrence 
Taylor has 6 1/2 sacks, including Randall Cunningham twice last week. 
</P>
<P>
INTERCONFERENCE GAMES 
</P>
<P>
Houston (2-3) at Chicago (4-1), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
With the Oilers struggling, there has been talk in Houston that Jerry 
Glanville's job is on the line and that running back Mike Rozier, who has 
carried the ball only twice this season, may be traded. The Bears are getting 
plenty of offense from Mike Tomczak and Neal Anderson, the NFL's leading rusher 
with 530 yards, but last week Vinny Testaverde shredded the Chicago defense, 
which had allowed only 15 points a game. Houston is 9-18 on the road under 
Glanville, and the Bears are 23-4 at Soldier Field since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
New York Jets (1-4) at New Orleans (1-4), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Things go from bad to worse for the Jets, who lost wide receiver Al Toon for 
four weeks with two sprained ankles. That won't help Kyle Mackey, who replaces 
Ken O'Brien at quarterback. New York has scored only 29 points in first-half 
play this season, one touchdown in the first quarter. The Saints led San 
Francisco, 17-3, before losing. Without Rueben Mayes, New Orleans needs help 
from Ironhead Heyward. 
</P>
<P>
New England (2-3) at Atlanta (1-4), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Patriot quarterback Doug Flutie doesn't pile up the numbers, just victories. 
However, even more important was the return of running back John Stephens in 
last week's win over Houston. Atlanta quarterback Chris Miller, who passed for 
340 yards against the Rams, could have another big day against New England's 
defense, which has been weakened by injuries. The Falcons are better than their 
record, but had to play the Rams, the NFL's only unbeaten team, twice in the 
first five weeks. Deion Sanders will get his first start in the Falcon 
secondary. 
</P>
<P>
AFC GAMES 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis (3-2) at Denver (4-1), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
TV: Channel 4. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos are glad to be 4-1 but can't wait to see what happens when John 
Elway gets going. Elway pulled a leg muscle in practice this week, so Gary 
Kubiak may have to replace him. Rookie running back Bobby Humphrey and an 
improved defense have made the difference for Denver. The Colts are tied with 
Buffalo atop the AFC East by making up for injuries to Chris Chandler and Eric 
Dickerson. Indianapolis has allowed only two touchdowns while winning three in 
a row and is getting solid quarterbacking from Jack Trudeau. Indianapolis 
routed Denver last season, 55-23, scoring 45 points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Miami (2-3) at Cincinnati (4-1), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins aren't what they used to be but have to be reckoned with every 
week because of Dan Marino, who led an overtime upset of Cleveland last week. 
The Bengals are winning, despite having lost Ickey Woods for the season and an 
injury that has slowed quarterback Boomer Esiason, because the defense hasn't 
allowed more than 17 points in any game. James Brooks has helped ease the loss 
of Woods by running for 429 yards. Cincinnati leads the league in rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle (2-3) at San Diego (2-3), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
With the Kingdome not so kind this season, the Seahawks have had to go on the 
road for their two victories. Dave Krieg ranks with the AFC passing leaders, 
but Seattle has had trouble shaking Curt Warner and John L. Williams loose. The 
Chargers have been able to run the ball, but Jim McMahon has been unable to 
generate much passing offense. San Diego has beaten Seattle only twice in 12 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh (2-3) at Cleveland (3-2), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers aren't as bad as they seemed in a 51-0 loss to Cleveland in the 
first week of the season, but will have to go with Todd Blackledge at 
quarterback, since Bubby Brister suffered a knee injury last week. Bernie Kosar 
and the Browns have to be smarting since being slowed by penalties and scoring 
only 10 points in an overtime loss in Miami. Cleveland has won eight of the 
last nine games in this series. 
</P>
<P>
NFC GAMES 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco (4-1) at Dallas (0-5), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
TV: Channel 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys got five players for Herschel Walker, but it will take time to work 
them into Jimmy Johnson's scheme. Not that anything figures to help this week. 
The 49ers ought to be able to get Joe Montana and his sore right arm off the 
field early and give Steve Young some work. San Francisco, however, seems to be 
playing to the level of the competition, rallying in the second half in all 
four victories and losing to the Rams. The Cowboys were worse only in 1960, the 
year they joined the league and were 0-11-1. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay (3-2) at Minnesota (3-2), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
To challenge Chicago in the NFC Central, the resurgent Packers must first get 
past Minnesota, which they did twice last season, 34-14 and 18-6. Green Bay has 
won seven of the last eight in Minnesota. The offense Lindy Infante brought 
from Cleveland is making Don Majkowski look like Bernie Kosar, especially in 
the second half, in which Packers have outscored opponents, 104-23. The Vikings 
hope Herschel Walker will help them bounce back from a disappointing start, 
although at 3-2, the Vikings still are in the thick of the battle. Minnesota is 
ranked No. 1 in defense, Green Bay No. 1 in offense. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia (3-2) at Phoenix (2-3), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Buddy Ryan's Eagles have developed into a strong road team, having won five of 
their last six games. Randall Cunningham had the worst passing game of his 
career -- 106 yards -- but brought the Eagles back to beat the Giants last 
week. With Roy Green out with a broken collarbone, the Cardinals must depend on 
J. T. Smith, who caught three touchdown passes last week. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit (0-5) at Tampa Bay (3-2), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions hope to have both Rodney Peete and Barry Sanders near full speed for 
the first time this season, and will need those highly regarded rookies, the 
way Ray Perkins has the Buccaneers playing. Vinny Testaverde is living up to 
his promise, and Tampa Bay has only nine turnovers in five games. The 
Buccaneers swept the Lions for the first time last season, 23-20 and 21-10. 
Detroit is 0-5 for the first time since 1955.

SEAHAWKS HOBBLING INTO SAN DIEGO; 
</P>
<P>
CHARGERS: A TEAM, SO FAR UNABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OTHERS' MISFORTUNES, TODAY 
FACES SEATTLE -- ANOTHER TEAM IN TRANSITION. 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chargers can't say timing has not been on their side. But in each of their 
first five games, they have failed to take advantage of the wrecks that have 
lined up across from them. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for instance, Seattle -- their next opponent. The Seahawks come to San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium today with an historically powerful running game 
mired in a miserable slump. 
</P>
<P>
Worse for Seattle, the Seahawks have lost both their games in the 
highly-partisan Kingdome. Plus, they are missing wide receiver Steve Largent 
(elbow) and linebacker Brian Bosworth (shoulder). Both are on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a real good football team at this point," said Seattle Coach Chuck 
Knox. For the record, they are 2-3 and tied with Kansas City, the Chargers and 
the Raiders for second and last in the AFC West behind Denver (4-1). 
</P>
<P>
In a 20-16 loss to Kansas City at Seattle last week, the Seahawks blew a 16-3 
halftime lead. Running back Curt Warner managed only one yard in seven carries. 
Fullback John L. Williams wasn't much more effective. He gained 22 yards in 
nine rushes. Only the Jets and the pass-oriented Dolphins have gained fewer 
yards on the ground in the AFC than Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Nor were the Seahawks able to stop the run against Kansas City. Christian 
Okoye, the Chiefs' 253-pound fullback, rumbled for 156 yards in 30 tries. It 
was the most yards gained by a back in an AFC game this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, it appears, are getting the Seahawks at the right time. But it 
looked as if they were getting the Raiders at the right time in their season 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders had just slogged through the first winless preseason in the history 
of the franchise. Late reporting Marcus Allen was disgruntled and out of shape. 
And quarterback Jay Schroeder left the game in the first period with a shoulder 
injury and never returned. 
</P>
<P>
Final score: Raiders 40, Chargers 14. 
</P>
<P>
The next week Houston arrived in San Diego with one of the worst road records 
in football. They were fresh from a 38-7 shellacking in Minnesota where the 
Vikings had sacked their quarterback, Warren Moon, seven times. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody could be worse off than we are," said Oiler Coach Jerry 
Glanville before the game. 
</P>
<P>
Final score: Houston 34, Chargers 27. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers won their first game the following Sunday when they did play the 
worst road team in football. When the Chargers beat Kansas City, 21-6, it was 
the Chiefs' eighth consecutive loss away from home and the 16th defeat in their 
past 18 road games. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers then outlasted Phoenix, 24-13, thanks, in large part, to the 
absence of the Cardinals' leading rusher, Stump Mitchell (injury), and their 
best pass rusher, Freddie Joe Nunn (suspension). 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, the Chargers caught a flat Denver Bronco team that was still 
trying to figure out how officials had allowed Cleveland's Matt Bahr to kick a 
game-winning field goal downwind when it should have been against the wind. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chargers lost, 16-10, when fourth-quarter mistakes separated them from 
a victory that should have been theirs. Now come the struggling Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, Charger Coach Dan Henning prefers to talk about what his team can 
do to improve. "We have to be like we were against Phoenix and be up by 11 at 
the end," he said. "That's when one critical error doesn't put you out." 
</P>
<P>
Against the Seahawks, the Chargers will be without their best all-around 
offensive weapon, Rod Bernstine. Bernstine, the Chargers' leading pass receiver 
and third-leading rusher, injured his left knee against the Broncos and won't 
play today. Diminutive rookie Dana Brinson (5-9, 167) will try to take his 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, right cornerback Sam Seale will probably return to the starting 
lineup. Seale missed the Denver game with a sore shoulder. His replacement, 
Elvis Patterson, did not tackle well. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Seahawks have only one rushing touchdown (tied for last in the 
league with Miami), Henning insists it is only a matter of time before they get 
untracked. 
</P>
<P>
"The Seahawks are a team that doesn't change," he said. "They aren't trendy. 
They have a formula and they believe in what they do. And I don't see a great 
deal of change in the scope of what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Still, one rushing touchdown in five games? 
</P>
<P>
"Kind of uncharacteristic," said Charger defensive coordinator Ron Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
"We just haven't played well in the three games we've lost," Knox said. "When 
you lose, everything you do looks stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Charger Hank Ilesic's 64-yarder last Sunday was the longest punt in the AFC 
this year and tied for the longest in the league with Detroit's Jim Arnold. 
After three games with the Chargers, Ilesic has risen to second place in AFC 
punting with a gross average of 44.3. Houston's Greg Montgomery is first at 
46.0. . . . The Chargers have lost eight of their past nine games to Seattle. 
But the series, which started in 1977, is tied 10-10. . . . Veteran Ron Mattes 
has replaced Notre Dame rookie Andy Heck at left tackle for Seattle. . . . 
Seattle's leading receiver, Brian Blades, has 23 catches for 375 yards. But 
their most efficient receiver, perhaps, is Paul Skansi. All three of Skansi's 
touchdowns this year have come on third down. And 45 of Skansi's 53 career 
receptions on third down have produced a first down. . . . No NFL team has 
tried fewer field goals than the Chargers. But Chris Bahr has made good on both 
of his attempts. The Chargers are second-to-last in the league in penalty yard 
edge. Only winless Dallas is worse. . . . The Chargers rank last in kickoff 
return average but first in opponent's net punting average.

Pete Rose, already suspended from baseball and under investigation by a federal 
grand jury, will be investigated by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The department confirmed it raided a Staten Island, N.Y., sports memorabilia 
company named Pete Rose Hit King Marketing Friday. Apparently confiscated were 
bats, balls, hats, clothing and other articles. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Inspection Service is investigating complaints that the company used 
the promise of Rose autographs to solicit business for the company, then did 
not deliver. 
</P>
<P>
The exact nature of Rose's affiliation with the company "is yet to be 
determined," inspector Mary Flynn said. "We don't know." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for Rose said Rose neither has any financial interest in the 
company nor does he share in its profits. She also said the company did not 
carry Rose's name, but Flynn said stationary had "Pete Rose Hit King Marketing" 
on its letterhead.

The trade that sent running back Herschel Walker from the Dallas Cowboys to the 
Minnesota Vikings for several players and draft picks may also include rookie 
quarterback Steve Walsh, a Ft. Worth radio station reported. 
</P>
<P>
Station KLIF said the Cowboys have an option to keep all five players and all 
of the conditional draft picks obtained in the trade with the Vikings. But to 
activate the option, the Cowboys would have to send Walsh to Minnesota before 
Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the Vikings nor Cowboys officials have said Walsh was linked to the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
The station also reported that the Vikings will pay the Cowboys $2.5 million if 
Walker signs a contract extension with Minnesota. Dallas reportedly paid Walker 
$1.5 million to accept the trade.

REUSCHEL SHUTS UP AS HE IS PREPARING TO SHUT DOWN A'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rick Reuschel, today's starting pitcher for the San Francisco Giants in Game 2 
of the World Series, will be one day shy of his 40th birthday when he takes the 
mound. That will make him the oldest pitcher to start a World Series game in 60 
years, and the third oldest overall. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean he's mellowing. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel, who promised reporters "minimum cooperation" during the playoffs, 
apparently has changed that edict to no cooperation for the World Series as he 
didn't show for his first news conference Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In his place was Giant pitching coach Norm Sherry, who was asked why. 
</P>
<P>
"Rick is busy," said Sherry, who was then asked how the introvert Reuschel 
handles the postseason pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing with Rick is, he doesn't care who is hitting," Sherry said. "He 
doesn't care about the hitters names or where they are batting in the lineup. 
He pitches them all the same. That's how he handles it." 
</P>
<P>
Sherry is referring to Reuschel's off-speed pitches, which induce hitters into 
hitting grounders and looking silly. Sherry recently detected a flaw in 
Reuschel's delivery that caused those pitches to hang, which happened when he 
was battered for five runs in one-third of an inning in Game 2 of the playoffs 
against the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry said he showed Reuschel the problem on a video tape. 
</P>
<P>
"You know Rick," Sherry said. "He just looked at me and kind of said, 'OK.' But 
he must have done something about it, judging by what happened in his next 
start." 
</P>
<P>
That was Game 5, in which Reuschel gave up one unearned run in eight innings to 
help the Giants to a 3-2, pennant-clinching victory. 
</P>
<P>
The two oldest World Series pitchers are Jack Quinn of the Philadelphia A's, 
who was 46 in the 1929 series, and Grover Alexander of the St. Louis Cardinals, 
who was 41 in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
Today's starter for the Oakland Athletics, Mike Moore, cannot remember what he 
was doing last year at this time. He only knows that, as a Seattle Mariner, he 
wasn't watching the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in Arizona with my family, just enjoying my off-season -- and I was not 
watching baseball," he said. "I play baseball for 162 games and if our season 
is done, I go home and do what I want to do." 
</P>
<P>
Moore signed with the A's last winter after five seasons with the Mariners, 
only one of which was a winning one. This year he went 19-11 with a 2.61 ERA 
for the A's, and had a postseason victory against the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 
2 of the American League series when he gave up three hits and one unearned run 
in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's a clear-cut reason why I ended up doing better here," 
Moore said. "There was a bunch of little factors -- confidence, better run 
support, a winning team. But not one reason." 
</P>
<P>
The A's are hoping that their scouting reports on the Giants are as successful 
as the Dodgers' scouting reports that helped them beat the A's last fall. But 
it won't be as easy. 
</P>
<P>
While the Dodger scouts followed the A's through much of last season, Oakland 
scout Jeff Scott was only with the Giants the last 11 games of the season 
because of a scouting department shakeup. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think it helps that we see them so much in spring training," said Scott, 
who was joined for the last few Giants games by Ron Schueler, A's special 
assistant to the president. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of our spring games, basically our guys know who bats how, and who can 
throw, and that kind of thing," Scott said. "It's a lot different than last 
year, when you had two teams which had spring training in different states and 
had never seen each other." 
</P>
<P>
The Jose Hotline has to heard to be believed, but if you don't have a few 
dollars to throw away, highlights from Saturday's message are provided here as 
a public service. 
</P>
<P>
First on the phone is Esther Canseco, Jose's wife. Esther begins by reminding 
listeners of her appearance Saturday morning on a local television talk show -- 
"If you saw it, you probably got a kick out of it" -- and then reveals that her 
husband gears up for a World Series opener by sticking Fido in the 
refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
"He stuck my dog in the freezer last night," Esther says, giggling. "No, not 
the freezer, the refrigerator. In the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I caught him messing up my freezer and I asked him what he was doing. He 
said he was setting it up to stick my dog in the freezer. . . . He stuck my dog 
in the freezer for 30 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Jose grabs the phone and says, "Don't listen to her. Women love 
to exaggerate. One thing I know -- you can't get 'em off the phone and you 
can't get 'em out of the mall." 
</P>
<P>
Enlightened Jose then discusses, in great detail, the intrasquad workout the 
A's had Friday and how the A's were "rusty" against the Dodgers last year and 
how "this year, we're going to go all the way. An indication is how we did 
against the Giants in spring training. We beat them eight out of nine times -- 
and Rickey Henderson wasn't around at the time and I had my (wrist) injury at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
"We played them without several everyday players and with some reserves and did 
quite well. Hopefully, we can continue that." 
</P>
<P>
Jose then offers his World Series prediction -- "I'm looking forward to the A's 
winning in six games. . . . I'm looking forward to going to the White House, 
doing this, doing that and having a g-r-e-a-t time." 
</P>
<P>
Jose concludes his daily chat with some words of advice for all the Little 
Leaguers out there. 
</P>
<P>
"Stay in school," Jose said. "Say no to drugs. Stay in shape. And listen to 
your parents -- if they make sense. Don't listen to them if they're crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Oh, and one more thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Call tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
How can anyone resist? 
</P>
<P>
Giant starter Scott Garrelts sounded shell-shocked after allowing five runs 
(four earned) in four innings Saturday. He begins his first World Series with a 
9.00 ERA after finishing his first National League Championship Series with a 
5.40 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't understand it, I really wasn't nervous," Garrelts said. "OK, I got 
nervous after Henderson (Rickey) hit that 2-and-2 pitch in the second, after 
that I calmed down." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson's RBI single in the second, for the record, occured on a 3-and-2 
pitch. But you can't blame Garrelts for not remembering much on a night when he 
allowed nearly as many homers (two) as the Giant pitching staff allowed in the 
entire five-game NL playoff (three). 
</P>
<P>
"This night is gone, it's over with, I've got to forget about it," said 
Garrelts. "I got them to put the ball in play, but those balls found the holes. 
Then my main thing was keeping us out of three-run innings, but I couldn't do 
that either." 
</P>
<P>
Giant Manager Roger Craig defended Garrelts, saying: "I thought he had his good 
stuff tonight. He just made some mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics' Jose Canseco, by going zero for three with a walk, is hitless in 
his last 21 World Series at-bats. His last and only World Series hit was the 
first-inning grand slam last October in Game 1 against the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is this mark just bad, it's approaching a record. The World Series 
record for consecutive at-bats without a hit is 31, by Detroit's Marv Owen in 
1934-35. 
</P>
<P>
"I started with a grand slam and finished with nothing," Canseco said of last 
year's Series. "Maybe this time I'll start with nothing and finish with a grand 
slam." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' Matt Williams, after going zero for four with two strikeouts 
against Dave Stewart Saturday, was asked whether the A's superior pitching 
staff has intimidated the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"I never said they had a superior pitching staff," Williams said. "I have yet 
to hear any of our coaches or players say the A's have a better pitching 
staff." 
</P>
<P>
Somebody reminded Williams that Giant Manager Craig had been quoted as saying 
the A's had a better pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh," he said. "Well, I guess Roger knows what he's talking about." 
</P>

Colorado was almost perfect Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The third-ranked Buffaloes had the ball 10 times in their Big Eight Conference 
game against Iowa State and scored on eight of those possessions in blowing 
past the Cyclones, 52-17. 
</P>
<P>
Led by quarterback Darian Hagan, who ran for two touchdowns and passed for two 
others, Colorado scored on all seven of its first-half possessions in building 
a 45-10 lead and also scored the only time it had the ball in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine seeing that team and knowing there's two more like it," said Iowa 
State Coach Jim Walden, whose team plays Nebraska and Oklahoma the next two 
weeks. "I wish I was in the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a good team, a really good team. You saw the best football team in the 
country today. Those are full-grown men out there, and they've got a lot of 
them and they're fast." 
</P>
<P>
It might have been a costly victory, however, because Colorado's leading 
rusher, Eric Bieniemy from Bishop Amat High School in La Puente, broke a bone 
in his lower right leg in the first half. Colorado trainers did not know how 
long Bieniemy will be out. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado, 6-0 overall and 2-0 in the Big Eight, did not have to punt and didn't 
have any turnovers. The Buffaloes gave the ball up once on downs and allowed 
the clock to run out the last time their offense was on the field. 
</P>
<P>
All of Colorado's first-half scoring drives lasted less than four minutes, the 
longest taking 3:42 and the shortest 37 seconds. Hagan ran and passed for 269 
of Colorado's 422 total yards in the first half, then sat out the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried about his stamina," Colorado Coach Bill McCartney said. "He 
gets plenty of plays in practice. It strengthens the team to be able to 
substitute at quarterback and every position. 
</P>
<P>
"Our second units are getting stronger and I know that's what we need going 
into the end of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Colorado set school records with its 45 points in the first half and 35 in the 
second quarter. The old records for points in a half and quarter were 41 and 27 
in a 55-7 victory over Northwestern in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're pleased with the win, especially after the way the game 
started," McCartney said. "You have to give Iowa State credit. They had a 
masterful game plan. They do a good job with the players they have." 
</P>
<P>
Iowa State (3-3, 1-1) was tied with Colorado, 10-10, early in the second 
period. But Colorado had two touchdown drives that took less than 3 1/2 
minutes, then capitalized on two interceptions and a fumble to break the game 
open.

NO. 1 NOTRE DAME USES ROCKET TO BLAST AIR FORCE OUT OF PATH

<P>
Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz calls Raghib (Rocket) Ismail his "wild card," a 
tribute to the flanker's versatility. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail added another dimension to his game Saturday night by returning a punt 
for a touchdown and even playing briefly at tailback. He had only 10 carries, 
but made them count for a 9.2-yard average and a 24-yard touchdown on a 
reverse. 
</P>
<P>
His many skills and top-ranked Notre Dame's power football were decisive as the 
Irish beat previously unbeaten and 17th-ranked Air Force, 41-27, before a 
record Falcon Stadium crowd of 53,533. 
</P>
<P>
The final score is deceiving inasmuch as Notre Dame led, 35-14, at halftime and 
38-14 after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons lost, though, by a respectable margin with guard Steve Wilson 
scoring on the old "fumblerooskie" play in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame has won 18 consecutive games, last losing to Texas A&amp;M in the 
1988 Cotton Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
Dee Dowis, Air Force's quick, resourceful wishbone quarterback, was virtually 
shut down as a runner. However, he surprised Holtz with his passing ability. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-10, 153-pound Dowis, who is regarded as a Heisman Trophy prospect, 
completed 15 of 24 passes for a career-high 306 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
He had accumulated only 369 passing yards through six games. However, he came 
into the game as the nation's fourth leading rusher, averaging 133.6 yards a 
game. He was restricted to 39 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Falcons had been averaging 449 yards on the ground to rank No. 1 
nationally in that category. They had to settle for 168 yards rushing against 
the Irish, who outweighed the Falcons approximately 30 pounds to a man. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we'd have more trouble stopping Air Force's running game, but we did 
a great job with that," Holtz said. "But I didn't think we'd have any trouble 
with the pass. We even dropped eight people back on pass defense and still he 
had people wide open." 
</P>
<P>
So Notre Dame (6-0) continues to roll on, while Air Force (6-1) realized a 
sobering truth. It isn't in Notre Dame's class -- and there's plenty of 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame set the tone for the game in the first quarter when it controlled 
the ball for 12 minutes 46 seconds. The Irish scored on four of their five 
possessions in the first half and added another touchdown on Ismail's punt 
return. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail is renowned as a kickoff return specialist. Only a sophomore, he has 
four touchdowns on kickoff returns in his career, including runs of 92 and 89 
yards against Michigan this season. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail had returned only one punt in five games before Saturday night's game. 
Now opponents will have to be concerned with him as multi special-teams threat. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a big hole," said Ismail, who bolted up the middle and then cut to 
the sideline on his 56-yard run. "Everybody played their roles and the blocking 
was great." 
</P>
<P>
USC will play Notre Dame next Saturday in South Bend, Ind. and, for sure, Larry 
Smith and his staff will be discussing Ismail at length. 
</P>
<P>
When USC was mentioned Holtz said: 
</P>
<P>
"Todd Marinovich throws the ball very well and USC has four All-Americans. If 
you want to talk about Southern Cal, you'll really ruin my flight home." 
</P>
<P>
Holtz had said earlier that his offense was inconsistent. It wasn't Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish drove 80, 69, 69 and 35 yards for touchdowns in the first half. They 
went into a bit of shell in the second half, getting only two field goals. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to win," Holtz said. "We didn't pitch the ball, or go outside 
in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
The Irish touchdowns came on fullback Anthony Johnson's one-yard run, a 
five-yard run by tailback Ricky Watters, Ismail's punt return, quarterback Tony 
Rice's 27-yard pass to Johnson and Ismail's 24-yard run on a reverse. 
</P>
<P>
On that play, the Falcon defenders were completely fooled as Ismail was 
escorted to the goal line by three offensive linemen. He didn't even need their 
help. 
</P>
<P>
Dowis tried to make it interesting, teaming with with halfback Greg Johnson on 
a 61-yard pass play for one touchdown and throwing a 26-yard pass to wide 
receiver Steve Senn for another. 
</P>
<P>
With Notre Dame leading 41-14 in the fourth quarter, the pro-Air Force crowd 
game to life on a gimmick play. 
</P>
<P>
Dowis put the ball on the ground and then moved to the right as the offense and 
Irish defenders flowed with him. 
</P>
<P>
The ball was apparently hidden by guard Steve Wilson, who then picked it up and 
lumbered 23 yards to a touchdown against the bewildered Irish. 
</P>
<P>
The "fumblerooskie" play has been used successfully by Air Force's junior 
varsity team this year. Nebraska scored a touchdown against Miami in the 1984 
Orange Bowl game with the same gimmick.

BACKUP TORRETTA LEADS NO. 2 MIAMI

A record passing performance by Miami Hurricane freshman Gino Torretta may not 
be enough to keep him from going back to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Torretta, making his second start for injured Craig Erickson, threw for 468 
yards Saturday to break Bernie Kosar's one-game school record in a 48-16 
victory over San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson, who broke a knuckle on his throwing hand two weeks ago, hopes to be 
healthy when No. 2 Miami (6-0) plays its next game, Oct. 28 at No. 19 Florida 
State. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dennis Erickson said Craig Erickson remains Miami's No. 1 quarterback. 
But the coach also said he's undecided about who will start against the 
Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
"If Craig is healthy and 100 percent, then we're going to make a decision," the 
coach said. "We're going to take a look at it. What we want to do is play the 
guy that's going to win games for us." 
</P>
<P>
Against San Jose State (2-3), Torretta completed 32 of 49 passes and converted 
10 of 15 third-down situations. He repeatedly beat the Spartans' blitzes and 
passed for touchdowns covering 18 yards to Lamar Thomas, 38 yards to Wesley 
Carroll and 17 yards to Randy Bethel. 
</P>
<P>
Torretta, who came off the bench to help beat Michigan State and started last 
week's 56-0 victory over Cincinnati, hopes he has changed the perception that 
he is Miami's backup quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"If I haven't, I don't know what I can do to change it," he said. "I'm not 
worried about who's going to start, who's going to play. I'm just worried about 
beating Florida State." 
</P>
<P>
Torretta's 13-yard pass to Randall Hill early in the fourth quarter broke 
Kosar's record of 447 yards, set in the famous Hail Flutie loss to Boston 
College in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"After I threw the pass, someone said congratulations," Torretta said. "I 
didn't know what they were talking about. But if we hadn't won, it wouldn't 
have mattered anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Defense also played a big role as Miami denied San Jose State a first down on 
nine of its 12 possessions and gave up only 215 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Miami is the best team I have ever coached against, perhaps the best I will 
ever face," said San Jose State's Claude Gilbert, a college head coach for 14 
seasons. "Our guys played the best they could." 
</P>
<P>
The Hurricanes led, 17-8, at halftime and scored 24 unanswered points on their 
first four possessions in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose State scored in the second quarter on a 35-yard pass-and-run play from 
Matt Veatch to Kevin Evans, and late in the fourth quarter on a two-yard pass 
from Ralph Martini to James Courtney. The Spartans also scored two two-point 
conversions.

PENN STATE RUNS PAST SYRACUSE

<P>
Blair Thomas scored on a 38-yard run and No. 23 Penn State kept its record 
perfect in games in which Thomas has rushed for more than 100 yards with a 
34-12 victory over Syracuse Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore O.J. McDuffie ran back a punt 84 yards for a touchdown as the Nittany 
Lions broke open a close game at Syracuse, N.Y., with 17 third-quarter points 
and ended a two-game losing streak to the Orangemen. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas finished with 115 yards in 17 carries, but he carried only once in the 
second half as the Nittany Lions won for the fifth consecutive time after a 
season-opening loss to Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse lost its third in a row, able to score only two field goals against 
the nation's second-ranked scoring defense. Penn State entered the game 
allowing less than a touchdown per game. 
</P>
<P>
After a 10-6 halftime lead, Penn State's Mark D'Onofrio intercepted a Syracuse 
pass to set up Ray Tarasi's 20-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
After regaining possession on a punt, Penn State drove 65 yards to score on 
Tony Sacca's seven-yard pass to tight end Dave Jakob. 
</P>
<P>
Three minutes later, the Nittany Lions got the ball back again on a punt. 
McDuffie used a spin move to break one tackle and then dodged kicker Ken 
Hawkins to score on the fifth longest punt return in Penn State history. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 31, Navy 14 -- Adam Walker ran for 105 yards and scored two 
touchdowns at Pittsburgh, assuring the Panthers an unbeaten record going into 
their Oct. 28 showdown at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, a senior, started at tailback only because Curvin Richards was held out 
of the first half by Coach Mike Gottfried after missing a team meeting. 
Richards, who has also been bothered by a pulled groin, scored on a 52-yard run 
on his first carry in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Redshirt freshman Alex Van Pelt completed 13 of 26 passes for 204 yards, giving 
him 1,414 yards for the season, and threw two touchdown passes as Pitt overcame 
a 7-0 deficit by scoring 24 consecutive points. Pitt, idle next Saturday, is 
5-0-1. 
</P>
<P>
Army 45, Holy Cross 9 -- Mike Mayweather ran for 171 yards and three 
touchdowns, snapping the Crusaders' 13-game winning streak and moving into 
fourth place on the Cadets' all-time rushing list at West Point, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Army (3-2) ran for 493 yards against the Crusaders (5-1). Mayweather, who moved 
past Tory Crawford and Charlie Jarvis, has 2,426 career yards and needs just 
532 to surpass Glenn Davis' record of 2,957. 
</P>
<P>
Yale 24, Dartmouth 19 -- Tailback Kevin Callahan scored three touchdowns and 
quarterback Darin Kehler rushed for 114 yards to carry the Bulldogs to an Ivy 
League victory at Hanover, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
Yale improved to 4-1 and 2-0 in the league; Dartmouth dropped to 1-4 and 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
Cornell 28, Harvard 0 -- John McNiff rushed for 130 yards and two touchdowns 
and Frank Monago caught two scoring passes to lead the Big Red to victory at 
Ithaca, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Cornell, 3-1 overall and 1-0 in the Ivy League, won its second consecutive game 
and Harvard (1-4, 1-1) lost its fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
McNiff scored on a draw play from 42 yards out 3:54 into the game. Then, with 
three minutes left in the first quarter, he went over the left side from 10 
yards out to make it 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
Princeton 24, Columbia 8 -- Judd Garrett rushed for 163 yards, scored three 
touchdowns and became the Tigers' all-time leader in rushing, scoring and 
touchdowns at Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers' defense forced five turnovers as Princeton raise its record to 
3-1-1 overall and 3-0 in the Ivy League. Columbia fell to 0-5 and 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
Penn 32, Brown 30 -- Bryan Keys rushed for a school record 249 yards in 37 
carries and scored four touchdowns to lead the Quakers to the Ivy League win at 
Philadelphia. Keys broke the one-game mark of 214 yards set by Francis Bagnell 
in 1950 and Adolph Bellizeare in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Boston College 35, Temple 14 -- Tim Frager ran for two touchdowns and kicker 
Brian Lowe became BC's career scoring leader as the Eagles (1-4) beat the Owls 
(0-7) at Newton, Mass. Lowe kicked field goals of 47, 27 and 42 yards and two 
conversions for a career total of 223 points, breaking the BC record of 216 set 
by running back Troy Stradford from 1982-86.

PRINGLE, FULLERTON TAKE BIG LEAD; PACIFIC NEARLY TAKES IT BACK, 35-26

<P>
A week ago, Cal State Fullerton's offensive line didn't open many holes, and 
Mike Pringle didn't find many of the ones they did. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had 29 yards rushing and a loss to winless Utah State in spite of a 
481-yard passing performance by Dan Speltz. 
</P>
<P>
Against Pacific Saturday, the holes were plentiful, and Pringle didn't let many 
go wasted, gaining 242 yards rushing in Fullerton's 35-26 Big West Conference 
victory in front of 7,127 in Amos Alonzo Stagg Memorial Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
By halftime, Pringle had 124 yards and a school record for touchdowns in a game 
with four. He added another touchdown -- this one on a pass reception -- in the 
second half. By game's end, he had carried the ball 42 times, another school 
record, and had become the first Fullerton player to run for 200 yards since 
Rick Calhoun in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"Not too bad," Pringle said when he heard he had 200 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle, the national leader in all-purpose running, has five 100-yard rushing 
games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton would have been happy to see the game end sooner than it did. 
</P>
<P>
After building a 35-7 lead in the third quarter, the Titans let Pacific come 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't make anything easy," Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said. "Thirty-five 
to seven, and here we go again." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy's halftime talk was a warning against the dangers of complacency -- and 
a reminder of Pacific's past comebacks and Fullerton's past folds. But it 
didn't seem to have much impact. 
</P>
<P>
The lead was still 21 points when the fourth quarter began, but Pacific cut the 
lead to 35-20 with nine minutes left after a 77-yard touchdown drive that began 
with Louis Greggs' interception of a pass by Speltz, who completed 17 of 22 
passes for 228 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific's two-point conversion attempt failed. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific got another chance when the Tigers recovered a fumble by Pringle with 
7:51 left. 
</P>
<P>
But the Tigers took six minutes to drive 82 yards for a touchdown, scoring with 
only 1:40 remaining. The Tigers again failed on a two-point conversion attempt 
before Fullerton recovered an onside kick and ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
"The win was good for the record, and that was it," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton is 3-3-1, 2-1 in the Big West, and plays conference favorite Fresno 
State (6-0, 3-0) next week in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific (1-6, 1-4) started well, driving for a touchdown on its first 
possession. But the Tigers sputtered after that. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific quarterback Troy Kopp, a freshman from Mission Viejo High School, 
completed 13 of 20 passes for 173 yards with one touchdown and one 
interception.

Myron Jones ran for two touchdowns and Aaron Craver rushed for 101 yards as 
Fresno State ran away from Utah State, 34-7, in a Big West Conference game 
Saturday at Logan, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Shelley also caught five passes for 132 yards as the Bulldogs improved 
to 6-0, 3-0 in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs' 13-game winning streak is the longest in school history and 
second-longest in the nation behind Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies (1-5 and 1-1) played close for one quarter before Fresno State took 
control after capitalizing on three Utah State fumbles in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Jones helped the Bulldogs draw first blood when he scored from six yards out on 
a sweep to the left side when Fresno State had a fourth-and-two with 10:24 left 
in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
His second touchdown, a four-yard run with 1:05 left in the first half, gave 
Fresno State a 20-7 lead. Fresno State's Steve Loop also kicked field goals of 
27 and 22 yards, both coming after Utah State fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
Tulsa 34, New Mexico St. 13 -- Dan Bitson caught two touchdown passes, one on a 
44-yard pass play in the second quarter, as the Hurricane beat the winless 
Aggies of the Big West in a nonconference game at Tulsa, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
Fullback Brett Adams picked up 123 yards in 21 carries, including a 10-yard 
touchdown run in the third quarter for Tulsa (4-3). 
</P>
<P>
David Fuess added a pair of field goals of 26 and 29 yards and tight end Bill 
Buehner scored on a 12-yard pass from quarterback T.J. Rubley for an insurance 
score in the fourth quarter.

Collegiate Athletic Assn. career rushing record Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
A four-yard run in the third quarter against Central State (Okla.) gave Bailey 
6,085 yards, eclipsing the mark of 6,082 set by Dorsett in his four years at 
Pittsburgh in 1973-76. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey rushed 16 times for 88 yards and two touchdowns in the first half, then, 
on the Javelinas' first play of the second half, he scored on a 49-yard run. He 
needed eight more carries to get the record and finished with 172 yards, his 
season average, with four touchdowns in 25 carries. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, Bailey has won the Harlon Hill Award, Division II's 
version of the Heisman Trophy, and has led the division in rushing since the 
start of his college career. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, a 5-foot-9, 180-pound senior from Houston, had 2,011 yards as a 
freshman, 1,598 as a sophomore and 1,442 last season.

DONAHUE DOESN'T OVERHEAT IN BIG DEFEAT; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA: BRUIN COACH IS DISAPPOINTED, BUT HE CONTROLS HIS TEMPER IN LOSS TO 
ARIZONA. 
</P>

<P>
The temperature on the field reached 102 degrees Saturday during UCLA's 42-7 
loss to Arizona, but Terry Donahue kept his cool. 
</P>
<P>
While he watched repeated cases of windburn among his defensive team as Arizona 
runners passed by, Donahue's face was about the same color as his lemon yellow 
shirt. 
</P>
<P>
His expression changed little when David Eldridge squeezed through the line, 
sped to the sideline and turned a pitchout into a 54-yard touchdown in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Donahue had seen something like it before. Only 5 minutes earlier, 
Eldridge had scored on a 19-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the fourth quarter, when 5-foot-8 freshman running back Errol Sapp, 
flowed straight up the middle of UCLA's defense for a 14-yard touchdown, 
Donahue folded his arms in front of him, like a man resigned to his fate. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a chance to be a clear-cut leader for the conference championship and 
we get totally outclassed," Donahue said. "You have to evaluate that. You can't 
sweep it under the rug. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a close game, we didn't lose a heartbreaker. We got thrashed. Our 
team isn't very good now. We're trying to get better, but we didn't get any 
better today." 
</P>
<P>
For UCLA, it was a defeat of stunning proportions. The Wildcats, coming off an 
upset, 16-10 loss to Oregon, led 14-0 after two possessions, 28-0 at the half 
and 35-0 after three quarters, rushed for more yards (480) than any opponent in 
UCLA history and thoroughly baffled their coach in one of the most memorable 
performances ever. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure I can remember a more inept performance by one of my teams," 
Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
It was also "a nightmare," and "a thrashing," which are the normal descriptive 
passages used on such occasions as these. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, the Bruins watched as Eldridge rushed for 205 yards in 20 
carries, the most yards a UCLA team has yielded to someone since Marcus Allen 
had 219 in a 22-21 USC victory in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
This could be the only time that Eldridge, who missed spring drills with a 
broken ankle, has ever been mentioned in the same sentence as Allen. 
</P>
<P>
What made the whole thing possible for Arizona was a newly installed offense, 
the I-formation, for which UCLA seemed totally unprepared. The Bruins countered 
defensively with the "What?-formation." 
</P>
<P>
It appeared as if the only hope UCLA's defenders had was that Eldridge might 
break his ankle again, possibly as he tripped over the stripe at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona, which came into the game last in the Pacific 10 Conference in total 
offense, scored one more touchdown against UCLA than they had the rest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
With Arizona leading, 35-0, quarterback Ronald Veal gave way to backup George 
Malauulu late in the third quarter, which meant that 51,562 witnessed the 
tongue-twisting passing combination of Malauulu to Olatide Ogunfiditimi. 
</P>
<P>
Little worked for the Bruins. Quarterback Bret Johnson gave way to Jim Bonds 
with the score 21-0 and UCLA on its 12 yard line. Two passes later, it was 
about to become 28-0. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Singleton intercepted Bonds' pass and returned it nine yards to the 
seven-yard line, from where Veal scored on the first play he called. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins were outblocked, outrushed, outdistanced and outscored by an Arizona 
team that just wasn't expected to be able to do those things. 
</P>
<P>
But there was split end Ogunfiditimi way downfield, throwing a clearing block 
for Eldridge on his 54-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Later, it was Eldridge leveling Bruin Marvcus Patton on a cut by Veal, which 
turned out to be a key play in another touchdown drive. 
</P>
<P>
There were seven touchdown drives by the Wildcats, although Arizona Coach Dick 
Tomey tried for more. Leading 35-0, Tomey twice called time in the last two 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Although Donahue seemed to have total recall of his feelings about every other 
situation in the game, he blanked out when asked about Tomey's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just in the game . . . and we were getting our . . . kicked," Donahue 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Eric Turner: "That's OK, that's their style, if you want to call it a lack 
of class or whatever, we knew they'd be trying to score as many points as they 
could." 
</P>
<P>
And who can blame them? The Bruins had trouble enough of their own in that 
department, their 210-game scoring streak jeopardized until the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But with Bonds at quarterback again, the Bruins scored with 4:18 to go and 
Donahue found something good in that. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have just quit, but at the end of the game, our football team 
scored," he said. "It wasn't enough, but it surely beats the alternative." 
</P>
<P>
In the quiet UCLA locker room, players showered, changed, picked up their bags 
and were out the door as quickly as possible. No need to linger around this 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Punter Kirk Maggio, one of the few Bruins who did not have an off-day, said he 
had no idea why the team could be so flat. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought we were going to come back, even at halftime," Maggio said. 
"Coach Donahue kept reminding us of how Maryland was behind Miami, 30-0, at the 
half and won (31-30 in 1985). 
</P>
<P>
"We thought were were going to do it," Maggio said. "It was a great halftime 
speech. After the game, Coach just told us that sometimes things go our way and 
sometimes they don't. Coach Donahue is just a very, I would say, quiet coach. 
He keeps his cool, kept his cool today. 
</P>
<P>
"But he's feeling sick right now," Maggio said. "A lot of us are."

<P>
WASHINGTON MAKES MOST OF OREGON'S MISTAKES 
</P>

<P>
Washington intercepted four of Bill Musgrave's passes and recovered three 
fumbles in defeating Oregon, 20-14, in a sloppily played Pacific 10 Conference 
game Saturday at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies took the lead for good in the third quarter on a one-yard touchdown 
run by quarterback Cary Conklin. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies, 3-3 overall and 1-2 in the conference, avoided losing their fourth 
consecutive game, which would have been most losses in a row in Coach Don 
James' 15 seasons in Seattle. The three defeats were the most by a Washington 
team since 1976. Washington beat Oregon for the first time in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Washington recorded three of its seven turnovers in the fourth quarter, 
including a fumble that stopped a last-ditch Oregon drive on the Huskies' 40 
with 1:38 left. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon is now 3-3 and 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
Washington State 31, Stanford 13 -- Steve Broussard broke off tackle and ran 71 
yards for the Cougars' first touchdown early in the second quarter and scored 
again on a five-yard run later in the same period to lead No. 17 Washington 
State to a win at Pullman, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars (6-1 and 3-1) fumbled the ball away on their first two possessions, 
but scored four touchdowns in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford (1-5 and 1-3) led, 10-7, after scoring its only touchdown when Tom 
Vardell recovered a fumble in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
But Aaron Garcia, who completed 23 of 41 passes for 341 yards and two 
touchdowns, hit tight end Doug Wellsandt with a 12-yard scoring pass and then 
capped a 93-yard drive with a 24-yard touchdown pass to C.J. Davis seven 
seconds before halftime and Washington State was on its way. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona St. 17, Oregon St. 17 -- Paul Justin of Arizona State threw for a pair 
of second-half touchdowns and Oregon State's Pat Chaffey ran for two scores as 
the two teams battled to a standoff at Corvallis, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Troy Bussanich of Oregon State missed a 55-yard field-goal attempt as the game 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State is 2-3-1 and 1-1-1.

PALMDALE'S WILSON MAY FACE PROSECUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Criminal charges are likely to be filed this week against Palmdale High 
football player Darius Wilson after he tackled an official during a game 
against Saugus on Friday night at College of the Canyons, a Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, 18, was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor battery Friday night after 
a bench-clearing melee forced officials to suspend the scoreless game midway 
through the fourth quarter. Wilson was released on his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
The case will be presented to the Newhall district attorney, according to Lt. 
Marvin Dixon of the Santa Clarita Valley sheriff's substation. "I anticipate 
charges to be filed Monday or Tuesday," Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section officials will review the incident before determining the 
outcome of the Golden League game, according to Saugus Coach Dick Flaherty. 
Flaherty contended that Saugus should be awarded a victory by forfeit but said 
he will rely on school administrators to pursue the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not interested in a suspended game," Flaherty said. "And I'm not 
interested in a letting-bygones-be-bygones tie. I think a statement should be 
made that will get the message across." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that Wilson, a 6-foot-2, 175-pound senior, grabbed back judge 
Bradley Woolley and threw him to the ground after Palmdale was charged with 
three consecutive penalties with 7:40 to play. A second official was struck by 
Palmdale's Mike Warren but no arrest was made, Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had my back turned and I heard him say, 'I'm going to kill you! I'm going to 
kill you!' " Woolley, 31, said. "The next thing I knew, I had my head on the 
ground and he was punching me." 
</P>
<P>
Woolley said that he will consider filing civil charges against Wilson. "I'm 
not sure what my options are," he said. "I just believe that something should 
be done. This can't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale Principal Linda Janzen said that disciplinary action will be taken 
against Wilson, a starter as a wide receiver and defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
"Consequences will follow and the young man is aware of that," Janzen said. 
"What kind of action will be taken, we don't know yet." 
</P>
<P>
Janzen said that Wilson might be suspended or expelled from school, or simply 
suspended from athletic competition. Janzen drove Wilson home after his 
release. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an emotional moment for the young man," Janzen said. "As far as I know 
him, this was totally out of character for him. He is a good student. He was 
remorseful, humble, polite. He didn't want to talk about it at the time." 
</P>
<P>
After Palmdale had been assessed 15 yards for a personal foul on a Saugus punt, 
two more 15-yard penalties followed after members of Palmdale's bench allegedly 
directed remarks toward officials. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Wilson nor Kent Bothwell, Palmdale's first-year coach, could be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale, a preseason favorite to contend for the league championship, entered 
the league opener with a 1-4 record. Saugus (3-2) had been outgained, 220 yards 
to 30, but did not allow the Falcons to penetrate inside its 20-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, there was a lot of tension between players," Janzen said. "There 
is a lot of pressure on this team. They obviously want a good season."

PALOS VERDES RACKS UP ANOTHER COME-FROM-BEHIND 'MIRACLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palos Verdes wide receiver Richard Lee is not likely to forget the first catch 
of his high school football career. 
</P>
<P>
Neither are any of his teammates, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, if Lee never catches another pass, he will always be remembered for 
his juggling, 28-yard touchdown reception from quarterback Blake Anderson with 
nine seconds left Friday that gave the Sea Kings a 23-21 victory over Torrance 
at Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
The come-from-behind triumph -- Palos Verdes trailed, 21-10, after Torrance 
scored with 4:28 left to play -- was the latest in a series of "miracle" wins 
the Sea Kings have pulled off on their home field in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"It's this Palos Verdes field," said Lee, still beaming after making his 
game-winning grab. "Every year we have a game like this." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bill Judy has grown accustomed to the heart-stopping finishes. It's 
gotten to the point where he envisions them before they happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a dream about (Lee) catching a touchdown pass," he said. "But it was in 
the other end zone." 
</P>
<P>
Close enough, coach. Judy was asked if he envisioned Palos Verdes winning next 
Friday's game against unbeaten Leuzinger. He smiled and replied, "I hope we 
play a solid ball game." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Judy wants the Sea Kings to put together a 48-minute effort 
rather than have to rely on the two-minute drill. 
</P>
<P>
But Palos Verdes does seem to use the fourth quarter as a wake-up call. In last 
week's 35-34 win over Santa Monica, the Sea Kings rallied from a 34-13 deficit 
with three unanswered touchdowns in the final quarter. As a result of their 
last-minute heroics, they are 2-1 in the Bay League and tied for third place 
with Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes (5-1 overall) had several stars Friday. 
</P>
<P>
One of the brightest was Anderson. The senior quarterback, who two weeks ago 
could barely raise his right arm because of a shoulder bruise, enjoyed his 
finest passing game by completing 10 of 21 attempts for 175 yards. He was 4 of 
8 for 103 yards on the Sea Kings' last two scoring drives. 
</P>
<P>
And, needless to say, all four completions were huge: 
</P>
<P>
* Faced with fourth-and-10 from the Torrance 49, Anderson passed 32 yards to 
receiver Mark Antrobius, who made a leaping catch over cornerback Carlos 
Hilliard with 2:13 left to keep the Sea Kings' hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
* On the next play, Anderson floated a perfect touch pass in the left flat to 
running back George Felactu for a 16-yard gain that gave Palos Verdes 
first-and-goal at the 1. Running back Bill Smiley punched it into the end zone 
on the next play to cut the deficit to 21-16 with 1:53 left. 
</P>
<P>
* Taking over at the Palos Verdes 45 after forcing Torrance to punt, Anderson 
passed 27 yards to the left side of the field to receiver John Miller, who made 
a leaping, twisting catch near the sideline with 18 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
* Then, on a play they'll be talking about at Palos Verdes for some time, 
Anderson fired a pass toward the right sideline for Lee. A diving Hilliard 
missed the ball, and Lee juggled it momentarily before turning into the end 
zone and into the arms of his jubilant teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if (Hilliard) tipped it or not," Lee said. "It just happened." 
</P>
<P>
Said Anderson: "When I saw Rich catch it, I just went crazy." 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the field, Torrance Coach Rich Busia appeared to be going 
a little crazy from the frustration of another close loss. The Tartars (2-4, 
0-3) have lost four consecutive games by a total of 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't feel like talking right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Who could blame him? At Palos Verdes, the visiting team is frequently left 
speechless. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly but surely, South Torrance is developing into a fine football team under 
first-year Coach Don Morrow. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans, who lost their first three games, made it three wins in a row 
Friday night with a 20-17, come-from-behind victory over previously unbeaten 
Culver City at South. 
</P>
<P>
"We started off kind of slow," Morrow said. "But the last three weeks have been 
great." 
</P>
<P>
By improving to 3-0 in the Ocean League, South remained in a first-place tie 
with West Torrance (5-1, 3-0), the preseason favorite. League coaches picked 
South to finish fourth. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Spartans and West meet Oct. 27 at South, it could be for the Ocean 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting," Morrow said. "I thought we had a pretty decent football team. 
To start off the way we did and (then) win three in a row is really a tribute 
to the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Kevin Fitzpatrick engineered South's comeback from a 17-7 halftime 
deficit by running for a three-yard touchdown and passing to wide receiver Tom 
Adams for a 12-yard score in the third quarter. Fitzpatrick also had a one-yard 
touchdown run in the second quarter and intercepted a pass. 
</P>
<P>
"Kevin played great," Morrow said. "He's invaluable to the team." 
</P>
<P>
Deftly running the option, the 5-foot-10, 170-pound Fitzpatrick rushed for 99 
yards on 22 carries and completed enough passes (4 of 6, 79 yards) to keep 
Culver City off balance. South finished with 217 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Another key was the play of the Spartan defense in the second half. After 
Culver City quarterback Troy Dunlap picked apart the South secondary in the 
first half (11 of 20, 142 yards, 1 touchdown), he completed just one of six 
attempts for 20 yards and was intercepted once in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"We stepped up our pass rush in the second half," Morrow said. "And the kids 
played a lot better pass defense. We were running out of our areas in the first 
half." 
</P>
<P>
Morrow said much of the credit for South's successful option attack goes to 
assistant coach Chris Forseth, who learned the offense as a lineman for the Air 
Force Academy. Forseth played with current Air Force quarterback Dee Dowis, a 
Heisman Trophy candidate and perhaps the best option quarterback in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows the wishbone and he's helped us put in that type of offense," Morrow 
said of Forseth. "He's been an inspiration to our kids." 
</P>
<P>
Carson defensive back Clayvand Thomas, in only his second game of the year, 
tied a school record Friday night by returning an interception 30 yards for a 
touchdown in the Colts' 40-6 Southern-Pacific Conference win over Gardena at 
Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas has three touchdowns, tying him with former Carson linebacker So'o 
Maulupe (1971) for the most touchdowns scored by a defensive player in a 
season. Thomas, a junior, returned an interception and a fumble for touchdowns 
last week against Washington in his first game back from a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Another Colt zeroing in on a school record is quarterback Armin Youngblood. 
With three touchdown passes Friday, the senior now has 12 TD tosses in four 
games, putting him on a pace to break the record of 24 set by Doug Ellison in 
12 games in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Look for Carson (3-1) to continue rewriting the record book in the coming 
weeks. Because of the overall weakness of the conference this year, the Colts 
and Banning (4-0-1) probably won't be tested until they meet in their annual 
showdown Nov. 9 at Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

The Serra juggernaut keeps rolling along. The Cavaliers opened the Camino Real 
League with a 46-0 victory over St. Bernard and have now outscored their 
opponents, 224-33. Ranked No. 2 in Southern Section Division II, Serra improved 
to 6-0 and running back Dennis Gerard increased his area-leading touchdown 
total to 15 with four scoring runs against St. Bernard, including one covering 
63 yards . . . With 251 yards rushing in a 44-8 Bay League win over Inglewood, 
Rolling Hills tailback Robert Coulter became the first South Bay player to 
surpass 1,000 yards this season. He has 1,070. Coulter also scored five 
touchdowns, giving him 12 on the year . . . Hawthorne maintained its half-game 
lead in the Bay League with a decisive 32-7 victory over Santa Monica. Running 
backs Itchy Delpino and Armando Fernandez each scored two touchdowns for the 
Cougars, who improved to 6-0 overall and 3-0 in league play entering next 
week's game at home against Rolling Hills (4-1-1, 1-1-1)

BADMINTON CHAMP IS OLD HAND AT WINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN LINDSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There aren't many 57 year olds who can say they are the world champion in any 
sport. Jim Poole is one of the few and the proud, the world champion in the 
over-55 age group for badminton. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because you get older doesn't mean you don't like to compete anymore. I 
enjoy competing and trying to play as well as I can," Poole said. 
</P>
<P>
"I also play down into the 40s on occasion. My partner, Tom Carmichael, and 
myself went to the Canadian Open this year and we won the over-40 men's 
doubles. I'm 57 now, so I gave them 17 years and we still won, though it was 
only by one point in the final game. You just enjoy being able to compete on 
that level." 
</P>
<P>
In the 31 years since Poole, chairman of the Cal State Dominguez Hills physical 
education department, started playing badminton professionally, he has won 65 
U.S. championships and 25 Canadian championships. Going into the World Master 
Games in Denmark this summer, he was the defending champion in men's doubles. 
The World Master Games are for players over 40. 
</P>
<P>
"In four years I'll be in another age division, and I expect I'll still be 
playing. This year I saw a lot of people from all over the world that I played 
against 20 or 25 years ago. You kind of remember, and you always have old 
memories just from talking about places that you played," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was quite a bit bigger than most of the people I was playing against then. 
I've had people say to me that I should be playing football, not badminton. 
When I was playing in the Far East years ago, they thought I was huge because 
of my size and that they didn't have many people that were that tall. They used 
to say in their newspaper articles that I was a giant on the court," said 
Poole, who was 6 feet, 180 pounds in his heyday. An ice cream fan, Poole these 
days has a bit heftier build. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave me an advantage; some of the smaller ones would try to hit the feather 
shuttle over my head or out of reach and I could still get to the birdie. Being 
a left-hander also made a difference; they would almost instinctively hit the 
feather shuttle to a right-handers' backhand, which is my forehand. From there, 
it was easy to go on the attack." 
</P>
<P>
Poole played badminton for the first time in 1955 as a 21-year-old student at 
San Diego State. His first championship came in the U.S. Open in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
"It was easy for me to play and to play fairly well in a short period of time. 
I was a baseball and basketball player in college, and I liked badminton 
because the movements on the court were very similar to the movements I was 
making when I played basketball. I was a pitcher in baseball, and the overarm 
swing in badminton, with the changes of direction and changes in speeds, (is) a 
lot like pitching," Poole said. 
</P>
<P>
After being the dominant U.S. player of the 1960s and early '70s, Poole spends 
a great deal of time teaching at Dominguez Hills and as a referee in the 
National Football League. He worked the 1987 Super Bowl. Although badminton has 
cost Poole time and money over the years, it has given him a great deal of 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"I still (play) to keep fit and have some fun," Poole said. "I play about twice 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the best times I had was when I won the Malaysian Championship in 1961. 
It turns out that only two non-Asians have ever won it, and I was the first one 
to win it. That's a nice feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"Officiating in the NFL, you enjoy the competition and you are competing -- 
competing to be the best and to call the best game that you can. In playing 
(badminton), it's the same feeling. I think that I've been enjoying the 
competition on more levels for a number of years." 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Poole coached the badminton team at Dominguez Hills, but 
budget cuts forced the school to drop the program. Badminton is making a 
general comeback since it was announced that it will be a demonstration Olympic 
sport in 1992. Poole focuses his attention on the future of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"Once people get a chance to see it, people will realize what a good game it 
really is and want to play," Poole said. "I would like to see it get back to 
the college level; right now it's big on the high school level. I help the CIF 
to host their championships here. I make the (Dominguez Hills) facilities 
available and generally help out where needed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not doing any coaching now, but besides coaching (at Dominguez Hills) I 
have coached the national team. It used to be that everything was on a 
volunteer basis and I was quite willing to do that, but I could see that the 
game was passing us by without someone who was more up to date with what was 
going on in the world. That's why I was very happy when (the national team) 
went out and hired Tariq Wadood to handle the job. He had been playing at a 
world-class level just a few years before. 
</P>
<P>
Many people here, in the U.S., think of it as an outdoor, Fourth of July type 
of thing. There are places throughout the world where people make actual 
livings from badminton, like England and the Far East. For the sport to grow, 
people are going to have to see these people play." 
</P>
<P>
Poole said one of the fun things about continuing to play badminton is the 
thought of how things were and the excitement of where they are going. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early '60s, nobody played full time. We were all people who worked or 
went to school. It was all played at night and on the weekends. Only in the 
past 10 years has it reached a point where there are people who do nothing but 
play badminton, just like people who play tennis or basketball," Poole said. 
</P>
<P>
"You get a lot of enjoyment out of seeing people that you helped to get better 
do well. As you get older, you don't play as well, and the coaching becomes the 
fun part.

LOYOLA JUNIOR SPARKS THE VOLLEYBALL TEAM TO A COMMANDING LEAGUE START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pardon the pun, but it's fair to say that Loyola Marymount's Kerry House is a 
House on fire these days. 
</P>
<P>
After a trying preconference schedule, the volleyball team's outside hitter has 
led the Lions to a 5-1 start in the West Coast Conference and has been named 
WCC Player of the Week two straight times. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the 5-foot-8 junior had 31 kills and six digs in a five-game victory 
over St. Mary's, and came back with 13 kills and 13 digs plus five service aces 
the next night in a three-game sweep of Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the week, House was rated eighth in the country in dig average at 4.3 
per game. In conference matches she's averaging 4.25 kills per game, a close 
third behind Melanie Kaiser of USS at 4.40 and leader Ann Pinkowski of Portland 
at 4.57. 
</P>
<P>
It's not quite accurate to say House has carried the Lions on their recent 
upswing, which started when Coach Mike Normand retooled the lineup, inserting 
freshman hitter Raquel Glenn and making junior Anita Irwin the main setter. But 
it's fair to say that if Irwin is the ignition, House has been the engine. 
</P>
<P>
Teammates agreed that she deserved the weekly awards, which are given by the 
WCC. "She's really doing well, she's leading our team," said team captain Tina 
Hammers. "She's dominating out there." 
</P>
<P>
Irwin noted, "I know if I'm in trouble I can always put it up to her and she'll 
at least keep it in play." 
</P>
<P>
Normand said the improvement has been a teamwide effort, adding that House "is 
a tremendous player. (She) and Raquel and Anita are the three who've hung in 
there. Kerry is definitely our floor leader. She's definitely a positive asset 
for the team, an inspirational leader." 
</P>
<P>
Normand has also had a positive effect on House, who has learned two valuable 
lessons this fall: She is capable of playing a dominant role in the WCC, and 
you can go home again -- but it's difficult. 
</P>
<P>
House grew up within, well, a few houses of the Loyola campus in Westchester. 
Although she was a high school star at Notre Dame in Sherman Oaks, she grew up 
riding her bike around Loyola. Her mother, Donna, works on campus, and her 
brother, Brian, goes there as well. 
</P>
<P>
So when it was time to pick a college, staying in her own back yard was the 
last thing on House's mind. She packed her bags and headed to San Luis Obispo 
to play for Mike Wilton at Cal Poly. 
</P>
<P>
After two frustrating seasons, she has returned to Westchester and reignited 
her enthusiasm for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
House said: "At SLO, I didn't agree with the coach's philosophy, and I couldn't 
get into the major I wanted (education). When I was having problems, my mom 
kept saying, 'You can go to Loyola.' Originally I wasn't going to play, I was 
kind of burned out. But I figured I don't have much longer to play." 
</P>
<P>
Normand changed several aspects of House's technical approach, and has worked 
on the mental aspect as well, something that is beginning to carry over to the 
whole team. "Before the match I'm always kind of nervous," House said. "After 
winning the (Player of the Week) award last week, I felt like if I didn't live 
up to expectations. . . . Coach said, 'Just have confidence in yourself.' As 
long as he has confidence in us, we'll do well. There are times we start 
doubting ourselves. He reminds us we can do the job. That's what he did to me." 
</P>
<P>
House transferred from a winning program and was a bit shellshocked when the 
Lions, playing a schedule that looked like a Who's Who of women's volleyball, 
opened at 0-8 and didn't win a game. But Normand knew that he was getting the 
team ready for a run at the conference title. The Lions' five WCC victories 
after one-third of the schedule are already more than they had last season. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all on each other's backs" during the losing streak, House said. Now, 
"we're more of a team. We're definitely progressing. When we play well, I think 
we can beat any team. When we're off, we're really awful. We have to 
concentrate on perfecting our skills. I still don't think we're playing (at the 
level) we can play." 
</P>
<P>
Along with Glenn and Irwin, House said the middle blockers have been solid, 
especially Stacy Trapp, who was asked to move from hitter, and freshman Jill 
Sutton, who came off the bench to spark the team in Santa Clara after Dawn Moon 
was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
She said Normand's coaching approach has been a surprise after her two years at 
Cal Poly. "SLO was more physically demanding," she said. "(Normand) 
concentrates on perfecting skills, a lot of repetition and doing it over and 
over. It's helped a lot. But it's been hard. I was used to doing things one way 
for a long time. He's changed so much of my technique. My blocking's improved 
since I got here. I'm a lot more confident in my hitting." 
</P>
<P>
House said the return home has also been more of an adjustment than she 
expected. She's living at home and devoting most of her time to volleyball and 
studies. "It's tough getting into the social scene," she said. "It's tough 
meeting people again. I feel old. Everybody knows everybody at a small school, 
but everybody already has their own little groups." 
</P>
<P>
House is also used to having volleyball get a little more attention. "I wish we 
had more fans," she said. "We used to pack the house at SLO. I'm used to 
volleyball standing out. Here, it's like people don't respect us." 
</P>
<P>
If the team continues to win and stays in contention for a WCC title, that may 
change.

LAWSON LOSES SLEEP OVER KEY ROUGHING PENALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rich Lawson didn't get much sleep Friday night. He shouldn't have stayed up so 
late watching Friday Night Video. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of being captivated by names like Madonna, Springsteen and Sting, 
the Chaminade football coach concentrated on names like Kelly and Afarian. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday morning, a weary Lawson was still lamenting a roughing-the-kicker 
penalty against the Eagles that proved decisive in the Knights' 14-12 San 
Fernando Valley League victory Friday night at Chaminade. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson replayed the third-quarter scene in which a diving Dan Kelly blocked 
Notre Dame kicker Chris Afarian's 32-yard field-goal attempt. Kelly, however, 
was flagged for making contact with Afarian before the ball was kicked. The 
tape seemingly confirms Lawson's claim that contact was made after the kick was 
blocked. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame capitalized on the penalty and scored what proved to be the winning 
touchdown three plays later on an 11-yard pass from quarterback Greg Andrachick 
to Guillermo Eguez. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame Coach Kevin Rooney said after the game that he did not have a good 
view of the play. After watching a videotape, he saw things differently. 
</P>
<P>
"From watching the film, it appears the guy blocks the kick and then runs into 
the kicker," he said. "I can empathize with those guys for feeling lousy about 
it. We certainly wouldn't have scored on the drive. But that doesn't mean they 
would have won the game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lawson: "It changed the whole complexion of the game. That was the first 
kick we blocked all season." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson protested the call -- on and off the field. After the game, the coach 
made a fly pattern to the videocassette recorder in his office. Minutes later, 
he wheeled the television and recorder into the officials' locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'I don't want to embarrass you and I do this with some hesitation, but 
I want you to see this so you can understand my disappointment,' " Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson hinted that the show was not met with rave reviews by the officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Physically, I don't see how it's possible," Lawson said of the call. "It was 
so blatant. It was so bad." 
</P>
<P>
But it was final. And Notre Dame (5-1 overall, 1-0 in league play) now is 
likely to win its second consecutive league title. 
</P>
<P>
Foster injured: Thousand Oaks fullback Chris Foster suffered an injury to his 
left knee in Friday night's 21-0 Marmonte League win over Camarillo and could 
miss the Lancers' next three games. 
</P>
<P>
Foster, who has rushed for 402 yards and nine touchdowns in 80 carries, went 
down in the Lancers' opening series. "I think I have a hyper-extension," he 
said. "A guy just went down right into my knee with his helmet and it (the 
knee) bent back. I was in pain. I was rolling around. I was doing a lot of 
screaming." 
</P>
<P>
Foster will be examined by a doctor this week and could be out three weeks if 
cartilage damage is found. 
</P>
<P>
Feminine touch: She's got a leg. And she knows how to use it. 
</P>
<P>
Score one for Monroe's Rachel Gagliano, who made history Friday night by 
becoming the first girl in City Section history to score a point in a varsity 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Gagliano booted an extra-point in the third quarter that aided the Vikings' 
18-17 Valley Pac-8 Conference upset of visiting Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was going to play in this game. I just had a feeling before it 
started," said Gagliano, an All-City soccer player. 
</P>
<P>
Two opportunities for field goals had gone awry earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
In one game, the snap went through the holder's hands. In another, time expired 
before the Vikings could snap the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was waiting for it," Gagliano said of the kick. "When it went 
through, Jesse Wallace slapped me on the helmet and said, 'You did it!' 
Everybody was jumping on me. I just kinda stood there. I liked it." 
</P>
<P>
Don't get mad, get even: More than a handshake was exchanged between Burroughs 
Coach Butch McElwee and Hart Coach Mike Herrington after Hart clobbered 
Burroughs, 47-11, Friday night at Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
Seems that McElwee was peeved at Hart's point total, especially because Hart 
led, 33-3, after three quarters and quarterback Rob Westervelt and tailback 
Howard Blackwell remained in the game almost until the final gun. Hart scored 
two fourth-quarter touchdowns in the Foothill League opener. 
</P>
<P>
Herrington said that his first-stringers needed the playing time. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought last week I pulled them a little too soon and I looked back and 
thought they didn't accomplish what I wanted them to accomplish," Herrington 
said. "I figured, since it's league, we'll leave them in. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard because we want all the kids to play and we want the kids to be 
happy, but we want the kids who have started and worked hard to get as much 
recognition as possible." 
</P>
<P>
McElwee had little to say after the game. "Their time will come," he muttered. 
</P>
<P>
Said Herrington: "That's what he said to me. But I'll face that time when it 
comes. And I'll take it like a man."

SOUTHWEST GOES TO THE AIR FOR 28-7 VICTORY OVER PIERCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY MICHAEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When his team's highly respected running game was stopped for almost all of the 
first half, L.A. Southwest College head Coach Henry Washington simply adjusted 
and went to the air, as his team secured an expected victory, 28-7, Saturday at 
home over L.A. Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
Cougar freshman quarterback Craig Manigo threw four touchdown passes, the first 
two to sophomore wide receiver Ansel Littlejohn, as the state's 14th-ranked 
team improved to 4-0-1, 3-0-1 in the Western State Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Manigo-Littlejohn connection first scored on a 52-yard pass on the first 
play of the second quarter, for a 7-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Brahmas (1-4 and 0-4) figured to be an underdog because of a lack of depth, 
but stayed close in the first half by holding off the Cougars' running attack. 
Washington credited the game plan of his Pierce counterpart, Bob Enger, for 
stopping the Cougars in the early going. 
</P>
<P>
"Pierce was stacking (its line) for our running game," Washington said. "We 
finally got smart and went to our other strengths. We loosened Pierce up with 
the pass and that got us going." 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars got going quickly in the third period, getting their second 
Manigo-to-Littlejohn touchdown on a 28-yard pass play little more than two 
minutes into the period. Manigo had another touchdown pass 32 seconds later, 
this time for 20 yards to Donovan Johnson. That came after Brahma freshman 
quarterback Jamie Grossman fumbled following a 12-yard gain on a reverse pass 
from running back Louis Vann. 
</P>
<P>
Manigo, who completed 14 of 19 passes for 223 yards, put it out of reach by 
again going to the air for a 30-yard TD pass to freshman wide receiver Donald 
Turner with five minutes remaining in the third period.

Down by 28 points, Pierce got on the scoreboard with a 23-yard TD pass to wide 
receiver Shannon Culver from Grossman, who was 18 for 38 for 193 yards passing, 
with an interception. While the Cougars' top rusher for the season and the 
game, William Jarrett, was held to 35 yards on 11 carries, Littlejohn caught 
six of Manigo's passes for 131 yards. Jarrett caught three passes for 14 yards.

Cal State Dominguez Hills got a badly needed victory in men's soccer, defeating 
Cal Poly Pomona, 2-1, Saturday in Pomona for its first California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. win. The Toros' Mark Merino scored both Dominguez Hills goals, 
breaking a 1-1 tie in the 78th minute for the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros, defending co-champs of the CCAA, improved to 1-2-1 in the CCAA and 
7-5-1 overall. Merino gave them a 1-0 lead 29 minutes into the game on a header 
off a pass from Rick McKaig. Pomona's Doug Bear tied the game shortly before 
halftime, knocking in a rebound. Merino's game-winner came off a pass from Rich 
Galbaldon. Merino has four goals this season. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona fell to 0-4 in the CCAA and 2-10-1 overall. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros resume CCAA play Wednesday night at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
The second-rated Dominguez Hills women's soccer team, 13-1, plays at home today 
against unbeaten UC San Diego, the top-ranked team in Division III. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount had a tough day in the opener of the Bruin Water Polo 
Invitational at UCLA, dropping its first game to UC San Diego 17-3, then 
falling later to Air Force, 11-9. The losses dropped the Lions' season record 
to 6-6 going into today's action, when they face Claremont Mudd Scripps at 11 
a.m. and UCLA at 3:30 in the Sunset Canyon Recreation Center. Air Force leads 
the six-team pack after one day at 2-0. UCLA is 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's cross-country teams competed in a four-way meet in San Diego, where 
the Lion men placed third and the women fourth. Running a 5-kilometer course in 
Balboa Park, the men's scores were: Redlands 31, Biola 68, Loyola 77, 
University of San Diego 94. The women's scores: Biola 33, San Diego 37, 
Redlands 63, Loyola 100. The top Lions runner, Mike Thom, placed 11th in 16:55, 
about a minute off the lead. Tim Feeley was 13th in 17:00. Amy Martin was the 
Lions' best in the women's race, finishing 15th in 22:35.

HARBOR COLLEGE BREAKS SCORELESS STREAK, 49-15

A visit from West Los Angeles College was probably the best thing that could 
have happened to Harbor College Saturday. After being shut out in the last 
three games, Harbor erupted for 36 unanswered points to hand the Oilers their 
15th consecutive loss, a 49-15 thumping in their Western State Conference 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor, 2-3 overall and 1-3 in the WSC, scored first on a three-yard Corey 
Henry run. That capped a drive that saw the Seahawks march 57 yards in nine 
plays. After a 40-yard second half kickoff return by Camaron Pitcher gave the 
Seahawks the ball on the Oiler 38, Bill Harris ran 30 yards, giving Harbor a 
first and goal at the West L.A. six. Perris Clark scored two plays later from 
three yards out. Harris' two-point conversion run gave the Seahawks a 14-0 
lead. Harbor went up 16-0 after the Oiler center snapped out of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Harris scored the first of two touchdowns in the third quarter on a three-yard 
run, making the lead 23-0 after Jose Rocha's kick. Clark got his second 
touchdown of the quarter on a one-yard run. Following an interception by Victor 
Dobbs, Harris scored on a one-yard run, building the lead to 36-0 at the end of 
three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Oiler quarterback Ruanda Manuel connected with Ken Cannon for a score from 20 
yards out to break the shutout. Not to be outdone, Harbor quarterback Mike 
Seward hit Christian Capper running down the sideline for a 45-yard touchdown. 
Clifford Bulkhalter scored on a 37-yard gallop for Harbor, increasing the led 
to 49-8. The Oilers, who remain winless at 0-5, got their final score on a 
29-yard pass completion to Joseph Stephens.

ST. FRANCIS LOSES IN BATTLE FOR THIRD

<TEXT>
<P>
St. Francis High and St. John Bosco entered Saturday night's Del Rey League 
opener with losing records and high hopes of resurrecting their seasons. After 
all, somebody has to finish third behind Loyola and Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
And visiting St. John Bosco retained those hopes after soundly beating the 
Golden Knights, 38-6. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves (3-3 overall) ran at will, gaining 313 yards on the ground and 441 
total yards. 
</P>
<P>
"They played an excellent game and they prepared for us very well," St. Francis 
Coach Bill Garrison said. 
</P>
<P>
St. John Bosco tailback Anthony Bull gained 134 yards in 17 carries and scored 
on runs of three, 10 and 76 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Sergio Diaz added 98 yards in nine carries, including a four-yard scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves had built a 30-0 lead before St. Francis (1-5) scored. 
</P>
<P>
On the first play of the fourth quarter, Golden Knights quarterback John Willis 
hit Marty Konrad with a 46-yard touchdown pass. Willis completed nine of 22 for 
142 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Pete Morales gained 63 yards in 13 carries for St. Francis. 
Considering the numbers, St. Francis was fortunate to trail at the half by only 
17 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves, who outgained the Knights, 213 yards to 66, scored on three of 
their four first-half possessions. On their fourth, the drive stalled on the 
Golden Knights' 22. 
</P>
<P>
Bull scored on first-half runs of three and 10 yards, and kicker Nomar 
Garciaparra added a 24-yard field goal to give St. John Bosco its lead going 
into the half. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves' defense did its share as well, limiting St. Francis to six rushing 
yards and sacking Willis twice. DAVE DESMOND

THE NEW MILKEN; 
</P>
<P>
THE DEPOSED KING OF JUNK BONDS STILL PRACTICES THE ART OF THE DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Milken may be gone from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., but his 
deal-making days aren't done. 
</P>
<P>
On the eighth floor of the United Artists building on North Roxbury Drive in 
Beverly Hills, just a couple of blocks from his old perch on Drexel's junk bond 
trading desk, carpets have been laid, wallpaper is up and furniture delivered. 
Milken's new company, International Capital Access Group, is open for business. 
Despite the racketeering and securities fraud indictment hanging over him and 
his forced resignation from Drexel in June, Milken hasn't retreated to the 
sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
When Drexel's former junk bond chief announced plans for the firm, he said it 
would help members of minority groups and unions raise the capital to own 
companies. And, four months after it was founded, ICAG appears to be doing just 
that. 
</P>
<P>
But the new firm is also gearing up for a considerable amount of potentially 
more profitable business. Since leaving Drexel, Milken has had talks with many 
of his old firm's clients, according to a senior Drexel executive. And in a 
long interview in ICAG's offices, Milken confirmed that a significant part of 
ICAG's business will be with ordinary companies. 
</P>
<P>
It may make direct investments in companies. And it is working on finding new 
capital for successful companies and refinancing firms that are in trouble. In 
exchange for Milken's brainpower and contacts in arranging refinancing, ICAG 
expects to receive an ownership stake in most of the companies that it helps. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're doing here is pretty much what we were doing before (at Drexel)," 
in the sense that his focus is on finding ways for companies to raise capital, 
Milken says, although he no longer trades or underwrites securities. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, however, protests any suggestion that the firm's main purpose is to 
make money. All of its activities, he says, fall under the category of "helping 
people." He refuses to discuss ICAG's fees or even confirm that he expects the 
company to be profitable. "Financial reporters have this preoccupation with 
money," he says. "We're focused on creating value. Wealth is a byproduct." 
Several times during the interview, the man who earned $550 million in one year 
at Drexel, and is estimated to be worth well over $1 billion, complained that 
"people are so hung up on money." 
</P>
<P>
At Drexel, Milken essentially created the market for high-yield, high-risk junk 
bonds, and he revolutionized the way that capital was raised for medium-sized 
U.S. companies. He also turned junk bonds into a potent tool in corporate 
takeovers and leveraged buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Milken seems determined to prove that the government's case against him 
will not stop him from carrying out his ideas. An ordinary person might be 
overwhelmed by the chore of preparing a legal defense against a 98-count felony 
indictment. But Stephen Weinroth, a longtime Drexel official now on leave, 
says: "Mike has an energy level that makes a nuclear plant look pathetic." 
</P>
<P>
In the short time since ICAG was formed, it already has purchased $2.5 million 
worth of barges and other equipment to lease to Unimar International Inc., a 
Seattle-based shipbuilder and tugboat company that was bought out by its 
unionized employees with Drexel's help in 1987. Milken says ICAG plans to do 
this for other employee-owned companies as well, since many of them have 
trouble raising the money to buy equipment outright. 
</P>
<P>
Among activities involving minorities, Milken has put groups of minority 
businessmen in contact with potential backers. And Bill Tatum, publisher of New 
York's black newspaper, the Amsterdam News, says he met with Milken about 
backing for a bid on a major general-circulation newspaper, perhaps the 
troubled Daily News. Milken says that helping unions and members of minority 
groups, and devising ways to help indebted countries, such as Mexico, will make 
up more than half of ICAG's business. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to these areas, Milken already is doing a considerable amount of 
mainstream business. He says he has agreed to help recapitalize an 
entertainment and publishing concern, which he won't identify. He is working on 
bailing out Weintraub Entertainment Group, a Los Angeles company that was 
straining under its junk bond debt after a string of unsuccessful movies. He is 
helping to arrange financing for a Los Angeles chain of car dealerships. And he 
says that enough progress has been made on some deals that they may soon be 
announced publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Milken says that, in all, he has been approached by several hundred companies. 
Of these, ICAG is doing work on behalf of about 30. He says that 12 of these 
already are at the point where a transaction has occurred or is about to. 
</P>
<P>
Milken won't comment on the terms on which ICAG is helping these companies, but 
one deal that fell through suggests that, while his aim may be to help others, 
he isn't neglecting his own interests. Wolfgang Puck, the well-known chef and 
proprietor of the Los Angeles restaurant Spago, said he approached Milken in 
July about raising new financing for Puck's frozen pizza venture, Wolfgang Puck 
Food Co. In an interview, Puck said he wasn't able to come to terms with ICAG. 
Puck said he balked when Milken demanded a majority stake in the company. 
</P>
<P>
Milken says he wasn't directly involved in the Puck negotiations, and denies 
that they fell through because of the ownership issue. He says Puck's company 
at the time was in financial difficulties and needed a lot of financing. (It 
has since obtained some financing elsewhere.) He says that the talks broke down 
because they involved too many lenders and stockholders who simply couldn't 
come to terms on a variety of issues. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's challenge in establishing a new firm will be to overcome serious 
handicaps imposed by his pending criminal prosecution. ICAG cannot trade or 
underwrite securities. Such activities were a main part of Milken's activities 
at Drexel. But they require licensing by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. From a legal standpoint, Milken could apply for such licenses, 
since he has yet to be convicted of anything. For practical reasons, however, 
he has chosen not to, and so must rely on other firms to perform these services 
for his clients. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if it bothers him that he can no longer issue new securities, Milken 
says, "it's not something I'm thinking about at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Investment banking sources say that Milken, in effect, also is closed out of 
doing work for the gambling industry, which made up a big share of his clients 
at Drexel. Because he is under indictment, New Jersey and Nevada gaming 
authorities have indicated that they might take legal steps against casino 
operators who do business with him. 
</P>
<P>
And though Milken's press spokesman and personal lawyer strongly deny it, a 
number of potential clients are frightened of having their names publicly 
associated with him. In an off-the-record interview, the chief executive of a 
publicly traded company who was a client of Milken's at Drexel and praises 
Milken effusively said that he couldn't afford to have any formal business 
relationship with ICAG. He said the commercial banks with which his company 
does business have indicated that they might stop lending to him if he does. 
Some banks, he said, "have decided that Milken is not a credible person right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
This hasn't stopped a flood of companies that have approached him in 
confidence, however. And there are still plenty of well-known executives who 
praise Milken publicly and wish his company success. Steven J. Ross, 
co-chairman of the recently merged Time Warner Inc., said: "Mike has to be one 
of the most brilliant financial minds of our time." But Ross would not say if 
he expects to use ICAG's services. "We have factors that we never make public 
about any of our business dealings," he said, adding: "That's not to be 
construed that we are or aren't." 
</P>
<P>
In true Milken style, ICAG's new offices are comfortable but not ostentatious. 
Only the firm's name, not Milken's, is on the door. And he refers to everyone 
who works there as co-workers, not employees. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the firm is a long rectangular table made up of 18 wooden desks 
pushed together. Complete with financial data computer screens, it looks 
remarkably like a trading desk. It is an environment that evidently makes 
Milken feel at home; his years in Drexel's Beverly Hills office were spent at 
the center of the junk bond trading desk. But at this one, for the foreseeable 
future, no securities will be traded. 
</P>
<P>
The firm currently has about 20 employees, with more expected to join soon. 
(Milken says he doesn't know how many.) Among the top staff members, whom 
Milken calls "principals," are Steven Fink, a former official at Pacific Asset 
Holdings (a partnership in which Milken holds an interest), Lorraine Spurge, 
formerly one of his top assistants at Drexel, and Randolph Read, former 
president of a merchant banking concern. Officials at the new firm say they are 
aren't making overtures to lure Drexel employees to ICAG. But Milken doesn't 
rule out talking to former Drexel colleagues who may, on their own, contact him 
about a job. 
</P>
<P>
He refuses to discuss how much capital the firm has, a key measure of the 
potential scope of its activities. "It's a private firm," he says. Milken did 
say that all of the firm's capital comes from himself and the principal staff 
members, not outsiders. "There are a number of people who have called, but we 
felt it would be better that we did not take in outside backers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But one clue to the amount of money that Milken personally is committing to the 
firm is how much he says ICAG is willing to invest in an individual 
transaction. For most types of transactions, he says, the firm stands ready to 
invest between $500,000 and $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
Milken draws a sharp distinction between his goals and those of Bruce 
Wasserstein and Joseph R. Perella, formerly of First Boston Corp., who, like 
Milken, left a big Wall Street firm to set up shop on their own. Their new 
firm, Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co., was established as a corporate takeover 
boutique. In contrast, Milken says, "you will not find us involved in any 
unfriendly transactions." 
</P>
<P>
Although Milken is credited with inventing the use of junk bonds to back 
hostile corporate raids, he maintains that hostile transactions have "never 
been a major focus of mine." Milken adds: "There's so much we can do to help 
people, I just don't think it's something we're interested in." 
</P>
<P>
By "helping companies," Milken means suggesting ways that they could improve 
their basic business, working out creative means of raising capital or 
recapitalizing to reduce interest costs, and using his vast network of contacts 
to put companies in touch with potential investors. 
</P>
<P>
After a speech he made in September, Milken was widely quoted as suggesting 
that companies should now attempt to reduce their level of high-yield debt. 
Some analysts interpreted this as a major reversal, since Milken's later years 
at Drexel were largely spent promoting leveraged buyouts financed with huge 
chunks of junk-bond debt. But Milken maintains that he is simply doing what he 
has always done, advising companies to profit from market conditions. 
</P>
<P>
One service that ICAG expects to perform is finding creative ways for its 
customers to convert their costly high-interest debt into a combination of 
lower-interest debt and equity -- that is, stock. Milken says his firm expects 
to help salvage some of the large companies that have been in the news in the 
last couple of months because of severe difficulties in meeting the payments on 
their junk debt. "There are some companies today that aren't knocking the cover 
off the ball, and yes, we are willing to help," he says. Milken declines to 
discuss individual companies but denies that the debt per se caused their 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
As ICAG takes on customers, one thorny issue is its relations with current 
Drexel customers. When Drexel settled a massive SEC lawsuit, the firm agreed 
not to do business "directly or indirectly" with Milken. What this means 
precisely hasn't been defined and could be a source of further SEC action. It's 
not clear, for example, whether legal problems would arise if a company hired 
Drexel to underwrite securities according to a recapitalization plan drawn up 
by Milken. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's lawyers are interpreting the provision to be Drexel's problem, not 
his. (A Milken adviser notes that Milken isn't a party to the settlement with 
the SEC.) Still, the adviser acknowledges that "it's something that exists, and 
we're conscious of it." 
</P>
<P>
Some current Drexel clients say they wouldn't be troubled by feelings of 
disloyalty if they also decided to seek help from ICAG. Oscar U. Mutz, 
president and chief executive of Forum Group, an Indianapolis developer of 
retirement communities that is a Drexel customer, says: "I don't ask Drexel's 
permission to go see Morgan Stanley (another Wall Street investment bank), and 
I don't ask Drexel's permission to go see Michael Milken or anybody else." 
Mutz, however, says he hasn't yet had occasion to do business with ICAG. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Anreder, Drexel's spokesman, says the firm hasn't lost any clients to 
ICAG. And he said he doesn't expect conflicts to develop. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, who was one of the most feared competitors on Wall Street when he was 
at Drexel, now frequently is funneling to other firms the trading and 
underwriting business that he can no longer do himself. One ICAG staff member 
says Milken's old competitors today are more than happy to do business with 
him, now that he's no longer directly competing. "The reality is that we can 
generate a lot of business for people," the staff member says. 
</P>

Milken himself takes pains to downplay his former role as competitor, saying 
that as a former buyer and seller of securities, he always had to maintain good 
relationships with other firms. 
</P>
<P>
One big, unanswered question is what will become of the firm if Milken is 
convicted and sent to prison. His trial is scheduled for March, and he faces 
the possibility of a lengthy sentence. He denies any wrongdoing and is 
vigorously fighting the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Milken and staff members say they are hoping for the best and, no matter what 
happens, they expect ICAG to remain in business and grow. Meanwhile, Time 
Warner's Ross says: "He's got such a brilliant mind that I think he could do 10 
things at one time and still prepare for what he's about to undergo."

DETROIT STALKING JAGUAR, ONE OF LAST OF ITS BREED; 
</P>
<P>
AUTOMOBILES: FORD AND GENERAL MOTORS ARE VYING FOR A PIECE OF BRITAIN'S 
VENERABLE JAGUAR PLC, AND THE BRITISH SEEM RESIGNED TO RELINQUISHING THE KEYS 
TO THEIR CAR INDUSTRY.

<P>
When Ford Motor Co. announced last month that it planned to buy a 15% share in 
Britain's Jaguar PLC, it sought meetings with government ministers, opposition 
political leaders and even trade union officials to explain its decision. 
</P>
<P>
It may seem like a lot of unnecessary public relations effort given the value 
of the deal, only about $300 million at best -- spare change for a giant like 
Ford. But "they remember what happened last time," noted Gavin Launder, auto 
industry analyst for the British investment bank Kleinwort Benson Ltd., "and 
they're not going to let it happen again." 
</P>
<P>
"Last time" was 1986, when Ford entered into what were supposed to be secret 
negotiations with the government to buy Austin Rover, the then-state-owned 
descendant of the companies that once produced such famous, now-defunct British 
makes as Morris, Triumph and MG. General Motors was simultaneously trying to 
cut a deal for Leyland Trucks and Land Rover, two other units of Rover Group. 
</P>
<P>
But when word of the talks leaked, there was such a public outcry that it 
killed both sets of negotiations. It was as if the government was trying to 
sell the family silver, outraged critics charged. 
</P>
<P>
Now, three years later, what of Jaguar -- the prestigious successor to the 
manufacturer of Britain's very first motor car and still the builder of 
automobiles for no one less than the Queen and Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher? Isn't there a similar patriotic uproar now that not only Ford, but 
also General Motors are publicly on the prowl for at least a substantial piece 
of the company? 
</P>
<P>
In a word, no. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few grumbles from classic car buffs and Jaguar -- that's a 
three-syllable word here: JAG-you-ah -- owners' clubs. But even the opposition 
Labor Party, which usually delights in any issue with which it might discredit 
Thatcher's Conservatives, has been surprisingly muted. 
</P>
<P>
As much as Ford's public relations people might like to think otherwise, what 
has made the difference is not their campaign, but the realities of Britain's 
once-proud auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
New car sales here are at record levels, but well over half of the cars being 
sold are imports. While domestic production is on the increase, it is still a 
third below the peak achieved in 1972. And even the cars that are produced in 
British plants these days bear mostly non-British nameplates. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, given Ford's stake in Jaguar -- and the Rover Group's announcement in 
July that Japan's Honda was taking a 20% share in that firm -- Rolls-Royce has 
become the largest wholly British-owned auto maker. Its output, however, is 
fewer than 3,000 cars a year, or about 0.2% of the total produced in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a motor industry in Britain rather than a British motor industry," 
said Garel Rhys, a Cardiff Business School professor and adviser to the House 
of Commons' Committee on Trade and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The motor industry is still a very, very important part of the economy," Rhys 
added in an interview. "But we have to accept that we can't turn the clock 
back, and we're just not going to own very much of it." 
</P>
<P>
Rover, which became a subsidiary of British Aerospace last year, remains this 
country's largest-volume auto maker, but only by a whisker over Ford of 
Britain. General Motors/Vauxhall is third, followed by the French-owned Peugeot 
Talbot and Japan's Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota has announced plans for a United Kingdom assembly plant, and both Nissan 
and Honda are expanding so aggressively that by the turn of the century 
Japanese manufacturers are expected to build at least one of every three new 
cars turned out here. 
</P>
<P>
It is particularly telling that the changes sweeping the industry should catch 
up with Jaguar, which was hailed not long ago as a shining example of this 
country's Thatcherite economic miracle. 
</P>
<P>
The company's roots go back to the Swallow Sidecar Co., formed by motorcycle 
enthusiast William Lyons in 1922. It started building motor car bodies four 
years later, and in September, 1935, introduced the SS Jaguar. After World War 
II, the company changed its name to Jaguar Cars Ltd. and went on to perhaps its 
greatest fame, aided by the race track success of the legendary driver Sterling 
Moss. 
</P>
<P>
Company founder Lyons personally introduced the car to the United States, now 
its biggest market, and brought back with him $1 million in orders, including 
one from the late actor Clark Gable. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar's E-Type model is still regarded by aficionados as one of the best 
sports cars ever produced. In 1960, Jaguar bought Daimler Co., which produced 
Britain's first motor car in 1897. A Daimler remains the official car of both 
Queen Elizabeth II and the Queen Mother. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1960s, Jaguar's fortunes began to turn, and it was merged with BMC, 
producers of Austin and Morris cars, in 1966. That firm was merged two years 
later into the new British Leyland, which by 1975 had become symbolic of 
everything that was wrong with British industry -- chronic labor problems, low 
productivity, inadequate investment and poor quality. The Labor government of 
the time had to nationalize British Leyland to save it. 
</P>
<P>
A new Jaguar management team installed in 1980 found "a company that had 
suffered from more than a decade of neglect," recalled David Boule, the firm's 
director of public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview, Boule explained: "We 
had a situation where Jaguar was building 14,000 cars a year, struggling to 
sell them. Quality had reached a very low ebb indeed. Productivity was poor, 
and there seemed very little prospect at that time of the company returning to 
good fortunes again." 
</P>
<P>
In the spirit of the nascent Thatcher revolution, the new team boosted quality, 
built up its worldwide dealer network and improved productivity. And by 1984, 
Jaguar was ready to be an early example of the Conservative government's 
program to privatize formerly state-owned enterprises. It was spun off from 
British Leyland (now the Rover Group) at a $400-million windfall for the 
government and quickly became a jewel in its privatization crown. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar's profits peaked at the equivalent of about $150 million a year later, 
but with the subsequent 1987 stock market crash and the weakening of the dollar 
against the British pound, they soon tumbled again. In the first half of this 
year, the company posted its first six-month loss since privatization. 
</P>
<P>
That history only proves the inevitable weakness that goes with being a small, 
independent company in a worldwide industry increasingly dominated by giants, 
according to industry experts. If it were producing 500,000 cars a year like 
West Germany's BMW, Jaguar might better withstand the vicissitudes of 
fluctuating currency markets and interest rates, they say. But with a volume of 
only about one-tenth that number, it is much more vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
If Jaguar needs a backer with a broader industrial and financial base, said 
Kleinwort Benson's Launder, "both Ford and GM need (Jaguar) for their strategic 
development." 
</P>
<P>
Both firms lack a strong entry in the European luxury car market, an area in 
which Jaguar offers built-in name recognition and mystique. Also, whatever 
either American firm would spend to gain a foothold in Jaguar, it would 
probably be much less than the cost of developing a new entry from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Ford nor GM could take over Jaguar before the end of next year. The 
government retains a so-called golden share as part of the 1984 privatization 
package, limiting any shareholder to no more than 15% of Jaguar's stock until 
the end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Ford insists that its long-range plans are uncertain, although there is little 
doubt here that it wants ultimately to take control of the British 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
While Jaguar officials refused to be interviewed because of the situation, 
Chairman Sir John Egan has previously emphasized his determination that Jaguar 
"remain an independent company" -- albeit one open to various forms of 
"collaboration with other companies." 
</P>
<P>
He has also made it clear that the Ford announcement was both unexpected and 
unwelcome. On Monday, Jaguar and GM confirmed that they are discussing "certain 
manufacturing, marketing, and other commercial joint venture arrangements," 
that could involve GM "taking a minority interest" in the British firm. 
</P>
<P>
The British press has even speculated that GM might begin Jaguar production in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
That seems unlikely any time soon, however. To make Jaguars somewhere other 
than in Britain could undermine the mystique that is such a large part of the 
firm's value. On the other hand, industry analysts here say that if Jaguar is 
to become the foot in the European luxury door for either Ford or GM, its 
capacity will have to be boosted considerably. 
</P>
<P>
Ford has been particularly careful to depict its interest in Jaguar as part of 
what a spokesman called its "very long history of commitment to the United 
Kingdom." 
</P>
<P>
Henry Neuberger, an assistant to Bryan Gould, the Labor Party's trade and 
industry shadow minister, said in an interview that Ford has been viewed "quite 
favorably" in Britain as a company that "operates in a fairly helpful sort of 
way in the U.K. economy. . . . GM has always been regarded with more suspicion 
than Ford." 
</P>
<P>
As the competitive international courtship continues, however, there is no 
question but that the level of nationalist angst visible here is minimal 
compared to just a few years ago, said Shauin Campbell, deputy editor of Auto 
Car &amp; Motor magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're all more grown up," Campbell said. The reality, he added, is 
that "there's nothing left of the British car industry. It's gone." Ultimately, 
Jaguar, too, "will have to be taken over if it is to survive." 
</P>
<P>
As for national pride, the editor said, "it's better that the (British) names 
still exist, even though they're owned by a foreign company, than that they 
disappear altogether. To talk about the motor industry in nationalistic terms 
just doesn't make any sense any more."

JAMES FLANIGAN: HOW TRUMP-STYLE TAKEOVERS HURT AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald Trump, the self-adoring New York real estate developer, can forget his 
offer of $7.5 billion for AMR Corp., the owner of American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
If the world's banks wouldn't finance the $7.2-billion buyout of United 
Airlines, as they indicated on Friday, they are certainly not going to pony up 
that much and more for Trump. 
</P>
<P>
And make no mistake, Trump is not the power in the proposed AMR takeover; 
overseas bankers are. Trump's ambitious offer, like similar megabuck bids 
recently for United and Northwest Airlines, depended not on the force of his 
ego but on the lenders, most of them giant Japanese banks. 
</P>
<P>
Over a week ago, Trump proposed to put up $1 billion for AMR and borrow the 
rest, a possible total of $8 billion, counting the assumption of AMR's existing 
debt. Borrow from whom? Citicorp was said to be interested. But along with 
Chase Manhattan, Citicorp was the bank trying to put together the United buyout 
-- a loan syndication of 150 banks worldwide that recalled the big credits to 
developing countries in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it recalled those disastrous loans to developing countries too much, 
because all last week there were reports among American bankers that the 
Japanese banks were getting very nervous about the United deal. The Japanese 
banks telephoned some of the American banks that had declined to participate in 
the United financing and asked them why they chose not to. In the end, they 
apparently decided that they had better things to do with their capital. 
</P>
<P>
And that kiboshed the United deal because the real power in today's financings 
is with the Japanese banks, which often provide most of the money, while U.S. 
banks are only agents. "Nothing can be done without the Japanese banks," says 
an international loan officer for a major U.S. bank. 
</P>
<P>
The most hopeful interpretation to put on the collapse of the United financing 
is that it may put an end to a takeover movement that makes less and less 
sense. The question was always clear: Why should a speculator like Trump be 
able to disrupt a going business like American Airlines, threaten the 
livelihoods of its 67,100 employees and the convenience of the traveling 
public? It's not because he could do a better job than could American's current 
chairman, Robert Crandall, who gets compliments from both American's employees 
and its competitors. Nor is Trump an industry visionary, as was C. R. Smith, 
the Texan who built American. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Trump, the 43-year-old author of the autobiographical "The Art of the 
Deal," is a deal maker who took advantage of the global capital market while 
the going was good. It was a situation that demanded rethinking in U.S. 
business and law, even before Friday's events. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the U.S. Congress was already on the verge of passing legislation to 
stymie Trump's bid for AMR. It was properly worried about the consequences of 
excessive debt on American as well as United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, big lenders, most of them foreign, would have power over 
borrower companies -- dictating working capital levels and other matters 
through loan covenants. 
</P>
<P>
Yet more important is the debilitating effect of debt on company ambitions. The 
major U.S. airlines, American in particular, have a dawning opportunity to give 
the United States international leadership in a service industry. They not only 
have the size but they're also pioneers in computer techniques for operations 
and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
But, put such airlines in the hands of a speculator like Trump and the computer 
system would probably have been sold to pay down debt. That's smart business in 
circles more adept at liquidating a company than building one. 
</P>
<P>
So what can or should Congress and the government do? Gear policies to support 
builders like Crandall rather than people like Trump, who only want to cash in 
on the efforts of others. 
</P>
<P>
What about shareholder value? Well, in the nine years that Crandall has run it, 
American's stock price has gone up eightfold -- even before takeover 
speculation pushed it over 100. In Friday's trading, AMR declined 1/8 to 98 5/8 
just as it fell in the 1987 market crash, but it had risen again to new highs 
since then, even without Trump or takeover speculation. 
</P>
<P>
In short, American Airlines doesn't need Donald Trump, and neither do AMR 
shareholders. His bid was based on a theoretical breakup value, a price that 
reflects a going-out-of-business sale rather than a going concern. It's time to 
move on from such worth-more-dead-than-alive calculations. 
</P>
<P>
And maybe we have. Maybe the collapse of takeover financings in the final days 
of 1989 will be seen in time as an encouraging epitaph for the 1980s, a decade 
that honored financial trickery more than business creativity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always thus when savings are low and capital scarce," says Peter Rona, a 
worldly-wise Hungarian-born investment banker and president of IBJ-Schroder in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when the handlers of financial resources, like Donald Trump, are 
heroes, and not the Thomas Edisons." Perhaps the 1990s will have the good sense 
to ignore the Trumps and to find and praise the new Edisons.

THE REMAKING OF DOUGLAS BY MCDONNELL; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: FOLLOWING A MASSIVE RESTRUCTURING OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
AIRCRAFT FIRM BY ITS ST. LOUIS PARENT, MORALE IS LOW AT DOUGLAS AND THERE IS A 
SEA OF RED INK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A cabal of McDonnell Douglas executives plotted a cultural upheaval at their 
Douglas Aircraft subsidiary in Long Beach early this year, undertaking 
revolutionary changes in what they had come to view as an antiquated and poorly 
run aerospace firm. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting in the basement of the St. Louis home of Robert H. Hood Jr., who would 
later take over as president of Douglas, the executives had a mandate from the 
corporation's new chief, John F. McDonnell, to recast the autonomous and 
independent-minded Douglas after 22 years under McDonnell ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Later, other executives were brought into the planning sessions, picked up by 
chauffeurs and not told where they were being taken. Stunned, they were led 
down the stairs to Hood's basement, where the walls had been plastered over 
with organization charts, to spend 12-hour days and "ponder the imponderables," 
as one participant recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The basement sessions were so secret that none of Douglas's senior managers was 
brought into the discussions or even made aware of them. Rather, the chief 
architects of the new Douglas management system were mostly people who had 
never built airplanes. They included a veteran of the missile business, a 
personnel executive and a former United Auto Workers official who had recently 
joined McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on a cold day in February, Hood dropped the bombshell. In Long Beach, he 
called every one of Douglas's 5,200 managers, supervisors and executives into a 
large paint hangar and announced that they had all lost their jobs. The 
long-troubled aircraft company, which has lost a quarter of a billion dollars 
so far this year, suddenly had an awesome new challenge ahead of it. 
</P>
<P>
If they wanted to remain with Douglas, the managers could reapply for about 
1,000 fewer positions. All but a few did so. To qualify for the new 
organization, they had to pass personality tests designed to measure leadership 
aptitude and whether they were team players. The leftovers were offered 
non-management jobs. It was a lengthy and tortuous process that has seriously 
wounded morale at the proud aircraft firm. 
</P>
<P>
The turmoil and scramble for jobs turned hundreds of career employees at 
Douglas into walking wounded. Although there was widespread agreement that 
major changes were needed, some executives assert that the reorganization was 
so traumatic and poorly executed that much of the work force has lost faith and 
trust. 
</P>
<P>
"Douglas needed some medicine, but the treatment has been too strong," said 
Richard Randall, who made it to the top of Hood's new organization as a vice 
president but became disenchanted and left in May. "The changes were more 
traumatic and dramatic than they had to be. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people were hurt. You have to ask, did the philosophy and process 
require that?" he added. "Rather than bad-mouth the changes, I have to 
personalize it and say the approach taken and the process used wasn't right for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas officials do not dispute that morale has been hurt. Joel Smith, a vice 
president for quality and one of the most influential of the new executives, 
said: "Sure, it is a big problem. It is like an Army without any morale, but I 
don't doubt that the culture and morale will be supportive (of the 
reorganization). Right now, we are a little disconnected." 
</P>
<P>
The new system needs to work -- and quickly -- because Douglas is hemorrhaging. 
It lost $224 million in the first half of 1989 and disclosed that every one of 
its aircraft programs was behind schedule and losing money. Analysts forecast 
continued losses through 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Most seriously, the Air Force C-17 cargo jet program is more than $400 million 
over its $4.2-billion contract for development and very close to a so-called 
contract ceiling beyond which Douglas must pay for all future cost overruns. 
Spending 10% over the ceiling would saddle the corporation with more than $400 
million in charges against profits. 
</P>
<P>
The T-45 Navy jet trainer development is already over its ceiling cost and 
overruns are being borne entirely by Douglas. The MD-11 wide-body jet program 
is four months behind its development schedule. Even the firm's venerable MD-80 
commercial jetliner program lost $34 million in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Many insiders blame the reorganization for the $224 million loss, but Douglas 
officials dismiss that out of hand and say the losses were inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"The programs are in bad shape because they have not been attended to all this 
year," said one former executive, speaking not for attribution. "The people 
they brought in are good people, but they are new to the commercial aircraft 
business and new to the military aircraft business and new to each other. 
</P>
<P>
"Douglas is a place where you constantly have to keep things on track because 
they will get off track in a minute or two," the former executive added. "We 
were programmed to have made a good profit this year." 
</P>
<P>
Randall confirmed that assessment, saying: "I was the chief financial officer 
at Douglas, and this year would have been as good as last year. (Douglas earned 
$127 million in 1988 on sales of $4.9 billion.) There was bound to be a cost of 
this reorganization. Many of us said it would be as severe as it has been." 
</P>
<P>
But Smith, the vice president for quality, disputed the idea that Douglas could 
have earned a profit this year. "I am sure the losses were amplified by the 
reorganization, but the basic losses had to do with a whole lot of history." 
</P>
<P>
The C-17 program for some time has been having problems with excess weight on 
the aircraft. Likewise, the MD-80 program has suffered from delays for more 
than a year. Security analysts said that Douglas's new management could be 
trying to get all the bad news out of the way as quickly as possible by taking 
write-offs sooner, rather than later. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Hood assumed control of Douglas, he began making extraordinarily 
critical statements about the condition of the company. In March, he told 
reporters that Douglas's management systems were "antiquated," its procedures 
"disorderly," the plant "dirty" and that the quality of the aircraft it was 
building was not up to his personal standards. 
</P>
<P>
It all hinted of an attack on James E. Worsham, the previous president long 
credited with saving Douglas from bankruptcy when he took over in 1982. 
Worsham, who retired from Douglas in January at age 65, is still popular at the 
firm and many there give him credit for a record $16-billion backlog of new 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"I sincerely hope and trust that the new organization at Douglas is 
tremendously successful," Worsham, now chairman of GPA Asia Pacific, a unit of 
the Irish aircraft leasing firm, said in a telephone interview last week. "I 
would not have gone about the changes exactly the same way. I would have gone 
about it in a more evolutionary and less revolutionary way, but I hope it 
works. The world needs Douglas products. There is a lot of tradition and 
strength there." 
</P>
<P>
Just how strong those traditions are is difficult for outsiders to imagine. 
When McDonnell acquired Douglas in 1967, there was sometimes-open antagonism 
between the two operations. 
</P>
<P>
The differences were as basic as the way two pieces of aluminum are joined on 
an airplane skin and to the way blueprints are drawn. It involved old alliances 
with engine companies and other manufacturers. But Douglas's rivalry with 
McDonnell's headquarters in St. Louis also manifested itself in strange ways. 
</P>
<P>
After the merger, the two organizations ordered new pencils for their 
engineers. In Long Beach, the pencils read McDonnell Douglas, but with the name 
starting at the blunt end of the pencil. That way, the engineers could sharpen 
them and eliminate "McDonnell" and the pencil would simply read "Douglas." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in St. Louis, the McDonnell Douglas name started at the eraser end of 
the pencil and the engineers there sharpened off the "Douglas" name first, 
leaving only "McDonnell." 
</P>
<P>
"If you sent a guy from St. Louis in here for a year, he couldn't do anything, 
because he would be swallowed up by the organization or the system," Smith 
said. "In the relationship between St. Louis and Douglas, we now have a lot 
more things going together than we had before." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas almost continuously lost money after McDonnell acquired it in 1967, and 
McDonnell came close to shutting down the operation in the early 1980s. Douglas 
finally earned a profit in the second quarter of 1984, ending an extraordinary 
10 years of annual losses. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, this year's reorganization was aimed, in part, at ending the 
autonomy and independence from St. Louis that Douglas has long cherished. That 
was a key reason that no senior Douglas managers participated in its planning, 
many insiders say. 
</P>
<P>
The revolution at Douglas involved two separate sets of changes. First, the 
corporate organization was turned upside down. The old matrix management 
system, in which various departments such as engineering and production worked 
for different aircraft programs, was thrown out. The line system that replaced 
it has separate organizations for each program -- each with its own engineering 
and production department. 
</P>
<P>
The change whittled the layers of management down from eight to five, Hood said 
last March. The number of management jobs was severely cut. For example, the 
ranks of directors -- executives who report directly to vice presidents -- were 
thinned from 275 to 75. 
</P>
<P>
The second part of the overhaul involved what is called the Total Quality 
Management System, a plan that closely parallels one used by the General Motors 
and Toyota joint venture in Fremont, Calif., known as the New United Motors 
Manufacturing Inc. or NUMMI. It has been essentially a training ground for GM 
in Japanese management systems. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, the vice president for quality, was a former UAW official involved in 
the NUMMI project and was hired only last year by John McDonnell after 
McDonnell became a disciple of the NUMMI system. 
</P>
<P>
It was Smith, along with Hood and McDonnell Douglas Senior Vice President James 
Henry MacDonald, who drew up the new management organization in Hood's 
basement. Later, all nine of the executives who were to become Douglas general 
managers -- four of whom had no experience at Douglas -- were invited into the 
basement. 
</P>
<P>
The premise of TQMS is that through teamwork and less direct supervision, 
quality will improve, deficiencies will not have to be repaired at a later 
stage of production, waste will decline and productivity will increase. 
</P>
<P>
Under the old system, first-level factory supervisors at Douglas typically had 
25 workers under them; now 40 would be typical, Smith said. The workers are 
subdivided into teams of five to 15 and a non-management team leader is 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis in the new system, Smith said, was to find the right managers. The 
search included personality tests and other psychological evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
"All the folks applying for the management positions went through an assessment 
program that was aimed at looking at their team leadership aptitude, rather 
than looking at technical qualifications -- does he know how to build 
airplanes? -- " Smith said. "The thrust was on leadership and team-playing." 
</P>
<P>
Outside consultants were brought in, and managers were required to go through a 
day or two of "team exercises." 
</P>
<P>
"In our view, the future is going to be wrapped around people's team 
leadership, rather than technical, capabilities," Smith said. "They are going 
to have to delegate the technical work to others." 
</P>
<P>
And that is as fundamental a change as possible in the aerospace industry's 
world, where for decades the best engineers and scientists became the bosses. 
In Smith's view, the best engineers might remain engineers and be rewarded in 
the same way as managers. 
</P>
<P>
A critical part of the new teamwork approach is a partnership with the Douglas 
unions, but that has been a rocky relationship. The president of the UAW local 
representing Douglas workers recently wrote a letter to Douglas management 
threatening to dissolve the partnership. A second letter retracted the threat. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute centered on exactly who had responsibility for making specific 
decisions, one area that was not well defined in the TQMS system. 
</P>
<P>
"My management is telling me I am supposed to listen to my employees, but my 
employees don't want to take responsibility for anything," one tooling manager 
complained recently. "They say I wear the necktie." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Lee, regional director for the UAW, added, "It is hard to get people 
adjusted to sharing power and accepting responsibility for making decisions. 
That's true on both sides. It makes the job pretty tough when you have a plant 
that size and totally change the face of it." 
</P>
<P>
Lee agrees that the hard feelings created by the management reorganization are 
"the single most important element of what is causing difficulties over there." 
</P>
<P>
"It is devastating," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But John D. Wolf, a Douglas vice president and general manager of the MD-80 
program, said last week that the new system has already had a beneficial effect 
on his program. 
</P>
<P>
MD-80 deliveries to airlines have long been behind schedule, even after several 
agreements to reset the schedule and more than a decade of experience in 
building the plane at Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf said that production of the MD-80 is paced by the output of nose sections. 
Since TQMS went into effect, the production time of those sections has dropped 
from 160 days to 130 days. Meanwhile, output has risen from an average of one 
or two noses a week to three a week. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas is aiming to increase its MD-80 production rate by 33% by 1991 without 
any increase in the 17,600-member work force on that program. The rate will 
jump from the current 2.5 aircraft a week to 3.3 a week. 
</P>
<P>
Some improvement will undoubtedly result just from the young work force gaining 
experience. Douglas has a still-growing force of about 40,000 employees, up 
from about 12,000 in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
On July 19, Hood told Douglas employees that it would be critical for the 
company to deliver 123 of the twin-jet MD-80s this year. That goal has since 
been reduced to 119 and personnel on the flight ramp where the aircraft are 
delivered have been told that they will be working maximum overtime through the 
Christmas holidays. 
</P>
<P>
If the new total quality system is working, Wall Street has yet to be convinced 
of it. Judging by the price of McDonnell Douglas shares, investors are deeply 
skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
At the current price of about $71 a share, the stock is selling at only 85% of 
its book value and has dropped more than 20% since the first-quarter loss was 
announced, according to securities analyst Jack Modzelewski of the New 
York-based investment firm of Paine Webber. 
</P>
<P>
"If this was a patient in the hospital, you would say he has yet to respond to 
the treatment," Modzelewski said. "At the present time, there is no evidence 
that the medicine is working." 
</P>
<P>
The losses led Moody's Investors Service Inc. to downgrade its rating of the 
firm's long-term debt and commercial paper in July, affecting $2.6 billion of 
McDonnell's debt. "Production inefficiencies in McDonnell Douglas's transport 
aircraft business and a reduction in defense spending will continue to impair 
the company's overall (profit) margins," Moody's said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Harris, aerospace analyst at the Los Angeles financial firm Bateman 
Eichler, Hill Richards, predicts that Douglas will lose $300 million this year, 
meaning $76 million in losses on top of the $224 million racked up so far. He 
also believes the firm will lose $125 million in 1990 and then show profits in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to concerns about losses on the T-45 and C-17 contracts, Harris 
said the company has been overly optimistic in projecting that it will have the 
first three MD-11 jetliners flying by the end of this year and 10 to 15 of them 
delivered to customers in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
William Gross, the former No. 2 executive at Douglas who retired this month 
after 37 years there, said it is unclear to him just when the benefits of the 
reorganization will begin to offset its costs. 
</P>
<P>
"You won't find many people who say this isn't the right thing for our company 
to do," Gross said. "The profitability had always been poor since the jet era, 
since the early 1950s. All you have to do is look at the financial record." 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "You don't take (thousands of) managers and supervisors and tell 
them on Monday morning that they don't have a job and then create a procedure 
where the jobs aren't filled for months and months. That was the criticism."

PRAISE, SUSPICION GREET POLICE 'OUTPOST'; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE LAPD'S EXPERIMENT AT THE IMPERIAL COURTS HOUSING PROJECT 
IN WATTS IS TESTING THE WATERS OF A NEW APPROACH TO POLICE-COMMUNITY RELATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lorene Grant, a 59-year-old mother of seven and grandmother of "30-some," sat 
outside the front door of her small apartment in the Imperial Courts housing 
project in Watts recently and gave her assessment of the "neighbors" who moved 
in next door three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, they're getting a little more polite," Grant said. "Some of them are 
beginning to recognize that you're a senior citizen and that they can speak to 
you without wanting to go upside your head." 
</P>
<P>
Grant was referring to the contingent of 11 police officers that, since July, 
has been operating a police "outpost" in a former apartment in Imperial Courts. 
The three-room office is an experiment in police-community relations that, if 
successful, could be expanded to housing projects elsewhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
While the operation still has some critics among project residents, Capt. M. M. 
(Sandy) Wasson, patrol supervisor for the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Southeast Division, said that the officers assigned to the outpost have come a 
long way since last spring when suspected gang members firebombed the office 
three times to try to keep it from opening. 
</P>
<P>
"The residents are becoming friendlier, they're talking willingly with any of 
the officers. They're even telling them to watch themselves," Wasson said. "I 
would expect that from good people. You don't expect that from gang members or 
drug dealers but every once in a while they say it, too." 
</P>
<P>
The city spent about $11,000 to establish the officers in Imperial Courts for a 
six-month trial period, Wasson said. He said he already has received assurances 
that the program will be continued at least until spring. 
</P>
<P>
The hope, police say, is that a bond of trust eventually will develop between 
the officers and project residents, leading to a reduction in crime in Imperial 
Courts. The project, like many others in the city, has become a haven for drug 
dealers, largely because its labyrinth of streets makes for easy getaways. 
</P>
<P>
But officers said that Imperial Courts, a 498-unit project located in the far 
southeast corner of Watts, was chosen for the pilot program not because it is 
any more crime-ridden than other city housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, they said, it was selected because it is relatively small and 
manageable, and an apartment was available there for police to use. 
</P>
<P>
No statistics are available to measure the impact of the program thus far. 
Wasson, however, said the effort has paid off in the form of anonymous tips 
that helped solve the fatal shootings in Imperial Courts of 7-year-old Kanita 
Hailey, who was hit by a stray bullet in a drive-by shooting Aug. 2, and 
Enrique Ayala, 28, a snack vendor who was killed a month later at the edge of 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is no consensus among residents about how the experiment is going. 
</P>
<P>
At one end of the spectrum are people like Lorene Grant who seem, for the most 
part, pleased with the program. Grant praised the officers, for instance, for 
installing security lights outside their outpost. She said the lights 
discourage youths from gathering on her lawn at night. 
</P>
<P>
Other residents view the operation with suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
The two groups seem to break down along gender and age lines. Older women tend 
to like the idea or at least are willing to withhold judgment to give the 
officers more time to prove themselves. Some men, especially younger men, said 
the outpost only made it easier for police to harass them. 
</P>
<P>
A frequent complaint from more than a dozen men interviewed was that officers 
try to chase them off the streets when they are doing nothing illegal. 
</P>
<P>
"Their favorite question is, 'You got a house?' " recalled a 50-year-old 
Vietnam veteran who did not want to be identified. "When you say 'yes,' they 
say 'then get in it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Once, the man said, he refused to comply with an order to leave from in front 
of a friend's apartment. He said an officer then handcuffed him and took him 
into custody on suspicion of possession of cocaine. He had no cocaine, and 
police found none on him, but he spent two days in jail anyway, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask me, it's just like Russia," the man said. "Who wants to see a 
police car riding down the street every time you look up?" 
</P>
<P>
Wasson declined to comment on the man's complaint, but he said that, in 
general, many of the men who are seen in and around the project don't live 
there, but use the complex as a hangout, sometimes to deal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, city officials unveiled a trespassing ordinance designed 
specifically to roust non-residents from all of Los Angeles' 21 housing 
projects. People caught in the complexes who cannot satisfactorily explain why 
they are there will be warned not to return. If they come back within 30 days 
and are caught, they are subject to arrest and a six-month jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
But crime prevention is not the only aim of police stationed at the project. 
They also are there to do some simple fence-mending. 
</P>
<P>
That's a key concern of Officer Myrna L. Lewis, a nine-year Police Department 
veteran, who has been assigned to the outpost since July. While other officers 
spend most of their time patrolling the project or taking reports, Lewis, a 
state-licensed family counselor, may spend her time doing such chores as 
picking up litter in an effort to show residents that she, too, is concerned 
about the community. 
</P>
<P>
An outsider walking through Imperial Courts, among the pastel-colored rows of 
box-like apartments, might view the community much the same as other low-income 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
But amid the signs of poverty and neglect, children play and laugh in yards, 
and adults who sit on their stoops or gather in parking lots return greetings. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, tension rises when the subject of police is broached. Even people 
who seem enthusiastic about the increased police presence are cautious about 
how much and what they say. 
</P>
<P>
"Some residents don't want to talk to the police and they don't want to be seen 
around police because people will think they are telling on someone," Lewis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For the last several weeks, Lewis has spent much of her time meeting with 
project residents and city recreation workers to establish a youth sports 
league in Watts. Eight soccer teams, four of them from Imperial Courts, are 
scheduled to take the field this month. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis also attends meetings of the residents' advisory council, publishes a 
one-page newsletter and makes herself available as a sort of all-around answer 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
She described what she does as "kind of a community-outreach type thing." 
</P>
<P>
Gwen Johnson, a mother of four who has lived in the project for 12 years, 
praised Lewis for arranging to move her teen-age son's school bus pick-up site 
from outside the project, where he was in constant danger of being attacked by 
gangs, to a spot inside Imperial Courts. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said it took her just a few days and a handful of phone calls to the 
school district to accomplish the task. 
</P>
<P>
"She's police, don't get me wrong," Johnson said. "But she is also like a 
neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's feelings about Lewis, however, don't necessarily translate into 
satisfaction with other police officers. A few weeks ago, she said, officers 
from the police anti-gang unit stopped her son a few feet from her apartment as 
he was on his way inside to get dressed for work. She said the officers, who 
also were questioning two adults, had her son "jacked up" against a wall. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said she complained to a sergeant at the Southeast Station and was 
assured that it would not happen again. 
</P>
<P>
Similar stories were told by other residents. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the greatest setback suffered by the program came when Kanita Hailey 
was shot. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses have complained that a police patrol car was less than a block away 
when the shooting occurred, but did not immediately chase the car carrying the 
gunman and allowed him to get away. After a crowd gathered and people loudly 
voiced their anger about that, the residents contend, officers attacked them 
with batons, breaking one man's arm. 
</P>
<P>
Police have denied the accusations. At the request of Assemblywoman Maxine 
Waters, the city's civilian Police Commission has ordered the department's 
Internal Affairs Division to investigate the matter. That investigation is 
incomplete, Wasson said. 
</P>
<P>
Though he believes that police acted properly, Wasson was clearly frustrated by 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like we took three steps forward and two back," he said.

ELDERLY, POOR ARE EASY PREY FOR HOME-EQUITY SCHEMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the value of land soared in Southern California over the last decade, 
elderly people and low-income families who purchased a home years ago found 
themselves with a valuable asset: property with substantial equity. 
</P>
<P>
But many of them also became targets for unscrupulous real estate dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials and public-interest attorneys say fixed-income 
homeowners, strapped for cash and ignorant of the law, have increasingly fallen 
victim to schemes in which the equity in their property -- and sometimes the 
property itself -- is snatched away. 
</P>
<P>
Networks of fast operators have especially been targeting homeowners in poor or 
working-class neighborhoods, such as South-Central and East Los Angeles, 
victimizing hundreds of people, according to law enforcement authorities and 
public-interest attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
One Los Angeles man alone faces 14 counts of grand theft and forgery for 
allegedly recording deeds in his name for several properties in South-Central. 
He simply drove through the neighborhood and picked the property he wanted, 
police said. He never even met the owners. 
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon continues largely to elude prosecution while sending shock waves 
through regulatory agencies and the title insurance industry, which estimates 
that real estate fraud will cost insurers $250 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Equity in someone's home is like money in the bank," said William E. Moran, 
managing deputy state real estate commissioner. "Some people rob banks. Those 
more clever can rob equity." 
</P>
<P>
Police, the city attorney's office and others in Los Angeles County consider 
the problem serious enough to have reactivated a special inter-agency task 
force on housing and real estate, which meets regularly to discuss alleged 
scams or frauds that befall homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a perfect crime," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert M. Youngdahl, who is 
handling several real estate fraud cases. "It's all done on paper, then the 
legal process helps the crook." 
</P>
<P>
A review by The Times of dozens of civil lawsuits and criminal investigations 
sheds light on how low-income people might lose their equity or their entire 
home -- often their principal material asset. In many cases, the same players 
appear time and again, interwoven in a complicated web of fast-paced business 
deals and straw buyers. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how the home equity schemes have been carried out, there usually are 
two basic ingredients: an unsophisticated victim and a home with substantial 
equity -- one purchased years ago and nearly paid off. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble often starts when the homeowner defaults on mortgage payments. When 
that happens, a flag goes up in the computerized world of real estate. Notices 
are printed in trade journals, and then the homeowner is inundated with offers 
of help from lenders, buyers and "consultants" -- many legitimate, others not. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, according to attorneys and authorities, there are a variety of 
ways -- some legal -- in which one can lose title to one's property. Some 
examples: 
</P>
<P>
* The homeowner is persuaded to sign "loan documents" to save his home from 
foreclosure. In fact, a deed conveying ownership to someone else is slipped 
among the documents, and the homeowner unwittingly signs his house away. 
</P>
<P>
* Or, the homeowner is told to "temporarily" sign over the property to someone 
else to secure refinancing, but title is not returned. 
</P>
<P>
* In a perfectly legal transaction, so-called hard-money lenders -- the lenders 
of last resort -- make a home equity loan for an amount the borrower clearly 
cannot pay back. When the homeowner defaults, the lender forecloses and takes 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
Home equity rip-offs were rampant in Southern California in the late 1970s and 
early '80s. But despite a series of new laws aimed at preventing such abuse, 
authorities say the problem appears to be on the rise again as the region's 
land values soar. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these equity rip-off artists see a property bought in 1960 for 
$10,000, and now they can come and see $80,000 or $90,000 in equity to be 
taken," said Kenneth W. Babcock, director of the Poverty Law Program for Public 
Counsel. "They are realizing there's a lot of profit to be made." 
</P>
<P>

TARGET: THE ELDERLY 
</P>
<P>
It is often the elderly -- unschooled in the wheeler-dealer world of real 
estate -- who are most in danger of losing their homes. Public-interest 
attorneys say they make easy targets because they are easy to trick, often do 
not have access to legal help and are less likely to make good witnesses if the 
case does get to court. 
</P>
<P>
Ora Lee Colbert, a 69-year-old widow and retired X-ray technician, appears to 
be losing her battle to get her house back, even though the man who allegedly 
took it from her is in jail. She is staying with relatives now, having been 
evicted in June from her home of 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
Her story, outlined in a lawsuit filed in Superior Court, is typical, according 
to public-interest attorneys. She said she borrowed $4,000 from a man named 
Artie Gilbert, offering her property as collateral. She maintains that even 
though she paid Gilbert back, he recorded a grant deed against the home, 
listing himself as owner. 
</P>
<P>
Records show Gilbert then sold the home, and it was transferred back and forth 
between him and other parties for three years until it ended up with a realty 
company that evicted Colbert this year. Gilbert pleaded guilty this year in 
U.S. District Court to unrelated drug charges and was sentenced to 10 years in 
prison, police said. A separate trial on real estate fraud counts -- none 
involving Colbert -- is under way in Los Angeles. Gilbert could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SELLING FALSE HOPE 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners are frequently hit at a vulnerable time, when they are in need of 
cash and are already afraid of losing their homes. Sinking deeper in debt, they 
readily accept what the man at the door is offering. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to believe these equity skimmers . . . who come on as financial 
whizzes, telling them to 'use your money, use your equity,' " said Betty Stark, 
senior investigator for the county Department of Consumer Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"But the equity skimmers are selling them false hope," she said. "The 
homeowners are getting taken." 
</P>
<P>
Doris and Gary Clark have lived in their Inglewood home for 16 years. Mounting 
medical bills from Gary Clark's kidney operation caused them to default on a 
mortgage, and soon they faced foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
A man who identified himself as Gary L. Palmer showed up at the Clarks' front 
door one day in the autumn of 1986, the Clarks told district attorney 
investigators. He offered his services as a "loan broker" and had the Clarks 
sign for a $5,000 loan. Two weeks later, a grant deed with the Clarks' 
signature -- one they insist they never signed -- was recorded, establishing 
someone else as owner of the home. 
</P>
<P>
The Clarks say now they believe Palmer hid a carbon underneath the loan paper. 
</P>
<P>
The allegedly fake deed conveyed the Clarks' home to Erikson M. Davis as a 
"bona fide gift," according to property records. Davis, a Santa Monica magician 
who dabbled in real estate part time, told investigators that he and Palmer 
then took out a $60,000 loan -- an arrangement that was repeated with several 
pieces of property. 
</P>
<P>
Davis told investigators he was paid $5,000 for each loan he lent his name to, 
with Palmer pocketing the remainder of the loan money. Davis said he knew 
nothing about how the properties were acquired, and that he assumed that Palmer 
merely needed Davis' credit rating to secure the loans and would be making 
payments on the loans. 
</P>
<P>
Fronting for someone like Palmer, he said, is not an unusual practice in the 
real estate trade. 
</P>
<P>
The loans were never paid off and Davis said he has since received several 
foreclosure notices. In some cases, the Clarks and other true owners of the 
properties have also received foreclosure notices and have had to go to court 
to keep their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unbelievable that this can happen," said Doris Clark, 42. "We almost lost 
our entire property." 
</P>
<P>
Davis has not been charged. Palmer was charged in August with eight felony 
counts of grand theft and four counts of forgery, including charges involving 
the Clark matter. A warrant has been issued for his arrest. In a telephone 
interview with The Times, Palmer vehemently denied the charges, denied knowing 
his alleged victims and said he had been "set up." 
</P>
<P>
"I never cheated anyone on real estate," Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GRAY AREAS 
</P>
<P>
Cases that involve alleged fraud and misrepresentation are seldom clear-cut and 
are difficult to prove, say prosecutors and investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Until she died early this year, 79-year-old widow Xenia Reece was fighting to 
regain title to her home of 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
In a lawsuit filed in Superior Court, Reece alleged that in August, 1987, Barry 
A. Malcolm offered to help "save her house" by lending her $5,000 to pay 
overdue mortgage bills. But, she said, he tricked her into signing a blank 
grant deed. 
</P>
<P>
According to public records, the deed was recorded in Malcolm's name, then the 
property -- estimated by Reece's attorneys to have more than $50,000 in equity 
-- was sold to a limited partnership. One of the partners was real estate 
businessman Kevin S. Merritt. 
</P>
<P>
In their legal response, attorneys for Merritt and Malcolm denied any 
wrongdoing, denied that the two were acting "in concert" and said that their 
deal with Reece involved paying her $5,000 and creating a "life estate" that 
would allow her to remain in the house until she died. However, Merritt's 
company tried to evict Reece after the property was conveyed to it, according 
to court papers. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Merritt said Reece's failure to make monthly payments of $185 
on a first mortgage triggered the eviction proceedings, which ultimately were 
not carried out. He said Reece was fully aware of the terms of the life estate 
agreement but reneged when she got a better offer; he has since offered to 
return title, but efforts to settle stalled in July, according to attorneys for 
Reece's estate. A trial date is set for Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HIGHLY LITIGIOUS BUSINESS 
</P>
<P>
Merritt, 29, is one of a number of Southern California businessmen who have 
made money over the years in foreclosure real estate, but who have also 
attracted the attention of law enforcement agencies, state regulators and the 
press. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the foreclosure and hard-money lending fields maintain that they work 
in a highly litigious business bound to create controversy. Merritt and others 
dispute the notion that there is a concerted effort to cheat homeowners out of 
their homes, saying it is common practice for some homeowners to back out of a 
deal and claim later that they were duped or did not understand the terms as a 
last-ditch tactic to keep their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Merritt has been named in recent years in dozens of civil lawsuits -- many 
settled out of court -- but he said the number is minimal compared to the 
"thousands" of transactions he has handled. He also has been the subject of an 
investigation by the Sheriff's Department, which referred the case to the 
district attorney's office, where it is under review for possible prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year the state Department of Real Estate revoked Merritt's 
broker's license, finding that he had charged borrowers excessive commissions 
and improperly used fictitious business names. 
</P>
<P>
Flanked by a disbarred attorney and two other attorneys, Merritt and his 
associates said in the interview that the sheriff's investigation and the 
lawsuits were part of a "vendetta" orchestrated in part by Legal Aid attorneys 
because he is a "high-profile individual," an easy target seen by some as "a 
little too aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
"You default on a loan, you lose your house," Merritt said earlier in 
explaining the problematic nature of his business. Foreclosure "is common in 
real estate. It's not pretty, but it happens." 
</P>
<P>
Merritt said he, like others in the field, has done a portion of his business 
with people who receive a finder's fee for bringing in potential borrowers or 
sellers. Merritt and his associates concede that there are "bad apples" among 
these free-lance dealers but that they sever their relationships with them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I BELONG HERE' 
</P>
<P>
In another suit, Lillian and Elijah Flowers, an elderly couple who have lived 
for years in their 75-year-old Craftsman-style home south of the Los Angeles 
Coliseum, claim that they were duped into signing a grant deed by a broker who 
then recorded it in a third party's name. 
</P>
<P>
Univest Home Loan Corp., whose president at the time was Merritt, then made a 
loan to the newly recorded owner, who soon defaulted. Univest, which said it 
ensured that the title was clear before making the loan, could foreclose but is 
awaiting outcome of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Flowers family, the problems began after Elijah Flowers, 84, 
suffered a stroke and was put in a convalescent home. Lillian Flowers, 76 and 
blind in one eye, began to lose track of a few of life's details and neglected 
to mail several mortgage payments. When a foreclosure notice came in 1986, she 
stuffed it in a drawer and forgot about it, her relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that a man named Johnny Cargo "took advantage of (the 
Flowerses') age and physical infirmities" to obtain their signatures on the 
deed. Cargo has denied the accusations, saying Lillian Flowers clearly wanted 
to sell the house. 
</P>
<P>
Lillian Flowers did sign a handwritten statement saying she understood Cargo 
would be "taking over our property." But the family says she did not understand 
what she was signing and instead thought she was authorizing Cargo to do work 
on a dilapidated garage. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm too old to be moving," Lillian Flowers said in an interview in her living 
room, where old photographs of her grandfather hang above the mantle. "(The 
house) means so much to me. . . . It's home. . . . I belong here." 
</P>
<P>
Cargo, who has since offered to return title to the Flowerses to extricate 
himself, said he never planned to evict the Flowerses and would have allowed 
them to continue living in the house. 
</P>
<P>
"You constantly have this kind of problem when you buy properties in distress," 
Cargo said. "You don't twist these people's arms, there's no pressure on them. 
We negotiate the very best we can. Every time you do business in foreclosure 
(real estate), you get sued half the time, mostly without merit." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Carlos and Aurora Lopez, language differences could have cost 
them their home. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Lopez, a gardener, and Aurora came to Los Angeles from Mexico 20 years 
ago. When they fell behind on mortgage payments for their home of 12 years, the 
Lopezes were contacted by a representative of Pentagon Investment Group of 
Beverly Hills, who told them they could secure a new loan by signing over -- 
temporarily -- a partial interest in the property, according to a lawsuit filed 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
The Lopezes do not read or write English. The documents they were told to sign, 
in English, actually conveyed full ownership of their home to Pentagon's 
president, Navtej Kohli, according to the suit and public records. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that four months after Kohli became owner of the Lopezes' property 
in 1986, he transferred title to Erikson Davis -- the same Santa Monica 
magician involved in the Palmer case -- who took out a $136,000 loan on the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Kohli blamed the transaction on a mistake he said was the work of a business 
associate no longer employed by Pentagon -- mistakes Kohli said he moved to 
correct as soon as he became aware of them. Pentagon was sued in two similar 
cases, both of which have been settled. 
</P>
<P>
Kohli said the deal was designed to generate enough money to pay off the 
Lopezes' debts and provide some working capital for Pentagon. He said Pentagon 
never planned to evict the Lopezes or take their property and would return 
title to them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'THE CROOKS ARE WAITING' 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of real estate transactions are on the up-and-up, and home 
equity lending is a valuable part of the legitimate banking industry. But, 
authorities say, there is enough abuse by disreputable operators to put 
homeowners on alert. 
</P>
<P>
"People have unrealized equity in their homes; they have become wealthy beyond 
their wildest dreams -- with their ordinary house," Youngdahl, of the district 
attorney's office, said. "The crooks . . . are waiting to prey on them." 
</P>
<P>
And, others say, the know-how for pulling off equity-seizing schemes is being 
imparted to entire new circles and generations of practitioners. Frequently, 
con artists employ as their fronts people from the targeted community who can 
more easily gain the trust of their potential victims. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be the white landowner coming down and ripping off the ethnic 
community," said Deputy City Atty. Ellen Pais, of the consumer protection 
office. "Now, we have a lot of blacks preying on blacks, Hispanics preying on 
Hispanics. That's the biggest selling feature. You trust someone from your own 
community. You don't think they'll harm you." 
</P>
<P>
Industrywide, a full range of real estate fraud across the nation is expected 
to cost insurance firms charged with guaranteeing property transfers at least 
$250 million this year. Title companies are expanding their corporate security 
divisions and starting programs that reward employees for detecting and 
reporting frauds and forgeries. 
</P>
<P>
"Fraud . . . is increasing at a staggering rate," said James N. Laichas, senior 
vice president of Ticor Title Insurance. Homeowners in financial straits "are 
sitting ducks for . . . swindlers."

S. AFRICA FREES SISULU, 7 OTHER BLACK LEADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SOWETO, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walter Sisulu, a powerful leader of the outlawed African National Congress who 
has been unseen and unheard by South Africans for 26 years, was freed from 
prison at dawn today and greeted by singing crowds at the door of his modest 
home in Soweto. 
</P>
<P>
The 77-year-old Sisulu, fully gray and wearing glasses, arrived under police 
escort and was raised on the shoulders of singing and cheering young black 
supporters who had maintained a two-day vigil in the street outside. He was 
quickly carried into the yellow house where he was living in 1963 when he, ANC 
leader Nelson R. Mandela and eight others were arrested, charged with plotting 
sabotage and sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the house were his 71-year-old wife, Albertina, and a dozen supporters, 
who had been waiting since President Frederik W. de Klerk announced Tuesday his 
intention to release Sisulu and seven other prominent political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
A prisons service spokeswoman said that all of the men were released early 
today and were on their way home. All except one of those men have been in 
prison for a quarter century on political charges. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, 71, was not among those named, but government officials and Mandela 
associates have said publicly that he was consulted over a period of months by 
Justice Ministry officials about the release of his fellow inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Sisulu, wearing a gray suit and tie, was driven to his house today by police 
and was almost immediately swarmed by the crowd. As he emerged from the car, a 
reporter for Reuters news agency shouted: "Are you Walter Sisulu?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, and how are you?" came Sisulu's reply. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd grew outside the house as word spread through this sprawling township 
on the outskirts of Johannesburg. Young blacks were singing ANC songs and, in 
an act of open defiance against the government, an ANC flag was unfurled in the 
cool, clear morning air. The ANC, the principal guerrilla group fighting white 
minority-led rule, has been banned in South Africa for 29 years, and many black 
activists have gone to prison for years on a charge of "furthering the aims of 
the ANC." 
</P>
<P>
Sisulu, a secretary general of the ANC in the 1950s, is Mandela's closest 
confidant, and when the two men were put on trial, they formed the nucleus of 
the high command of Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation, the ANC's 
military wing. Together, they helped launch the ANC's armed struggle after 
years of polite petitioning of the government had failed to win rights for 
South Africa's black majority. Neither man has renounced the use of violence -- 
the government's longstanding condition for their release. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said Sisulu and the others, representing a generation of leaders, 
would be released unconditionally, but government sources have said that the 
eventual release of Mandela, now expected sometime next year, will depend on 
the events of the coming days. 
</P>
<P>
Govan Mbeki, another of Mandela's co-defendants, was released two years ago 
unconditionally. But, within days, the government placed him under 12-hour 
house arrest and ordered him not to engage in political activity. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk also has left open the possibility that restrictions on the freed 
prisoners may be required if their behavior -- and the public reaction to it -- 
is seen as a threat to public order. Some 400 black activists are restricted 
from political activity and under nighttime house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
But the government, which has eased its clampdown on some forms of 
anti-government protest in recent weeks, is reluctant to restrict the men. De 
Klerk has received worldwide praise in recent days for his decision to release 
them unconditionally and, in the view of many political analysts, bought 
himself a reprieve from additional economic sanctions so he can begin 
implementing what he has described as a step-by-step program to dismantle 
apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-apartheid leaders have greeted de Klerk's initiatives cautiously, 
insisting they need more concessions -- including ending the three-year-old 
state of emergency, lifting the ban on the ANC and releasing all political 
prisoners -- before any talks with Pretoria can begin. 
</P>
<P>
Before the freeing of the eight political leaders, tens of thousands of black 
workers and anti-apartheid activists carried ANC banners through the streets of 
more than a dozen South African cities on Saturday to protest a new labor law 
-- and to celebrate the anticipated releases. 
</P>
<P>
Police for the most part watched quietly from a distance as protesters sang and 
danced in the streets and listened to militant anti-government speeches, 
suggesting that the government needs to go much further than releasing Sisulu 
before the 26-million black majority will be ready to go to the negotiating 
table. 
</P>
<P>
One banner carried above the marchers in Cape Town read "Eight is Not Enough -- 
Free Mandela." 
</P>
<P>
Sisulu was a founder in 1943 of the ANC Youth League and secretary general of 
the ANC from 1949 to 1954, when the government ordered him to stop working for 
the organization. He continued his ANC work in secret and, in 1963, a year 
after the beginning of the Mandela-led campaign of armed resistance, was 
convicted of furthering the aims of the ANC and placed under 24-hour house 
arrest while awaiting appeal. 
</P>
<P>
He disappeared, however, rejoining the underground leadership of Umkhonto we 
Sizwe, and was among those arrested in a police raid on the guerrillas' 
headquarters in Rivonia, a northern Johannesburg suburb. He served part of his 
sentence at Robben Island and was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison on the 
mainland in 1982.

<P>
Colombia extradited a convicted cocaine trafficker and two accused drug figures 
to the United States on Saturday, bringing to four the number of people turned 
over to U.S. officials since the Bogota government cracked down on the 
country's drug cartels in August. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 6, the reputed finance officer of the notorious Medellin cartel, 
Eduardo Martinez Romero, was turned over to U.S. authorities and flown to 
Atlanta amid escalating threats of retaliatory violence against the Bogota 
authorities by drug kingpins. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, possibly drug-related, news agencies reported from 
Colombia on Saturday that gunmen killed a broadcast journalist in front of his 
home in the northern state of Cordoba. The victim, William Bendeck Olivella, 
57, was the fourth journalist reported slain in that country in four days. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department identified the Colombians extradited Saturday as 
Bernardo Pelaez Roldan, 44; Ana Rodriguez de Tamayo, 50, and Roberto Carlini 
Arrico, 37. They were delivered to U.S. marshals at 3 a.m. in Bogota and 
immediately flown to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Pelaez was described by a U.S. government attorney as "one of the most 
significant players in the Medellin cartel," which is believed to control 80% 
of the cocaine that enters the United States from Colombia. Even so, he and the 
two other prisoners are not among the 12 "most-wanted" drug figures identified 
by the Justice Department's Drug Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Pelaez was convicted in absentia in federal court in Detroit five years ago of 
conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute one ton of cocaine. He is 
scheduled to be brought before a U.S. magistrate in Detroit on Monday for 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Tamayo will be tried in Miami on federal charges of importing cocaine and 
conspiracy to possess and sell cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Carlini was transferred to Orlando, Fla., where he faces federal charges of 
importing and possessing with intent to distribute 7,000 pounds of marijuana. 
He also faces Florida state charges of drug trafficking involving more than a 
ton of cocaine, according to state prosecutor Pete Antonacci of Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh praised Colombian President Vigilio Barco Vargas and 
his government for turning over the three prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
"I commend (Barco) and the government . . . for their continued diligence in 
the war against narco-terrorists," Thornburgh said. He continued: 
</P>
<P>
"The Colombian people are setting an example for the world as they continue to 
extradite international drug traffickers in the face of continued threats and 
acts of intimidation." 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, chief of Colombia's war on drugs, called Pelaez a 
"much bigger" drug figure than Martinez, the first person to be extradited as 
part of Colombia's latest efforts to crack down on its drug cartels. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, brought to Atlanta to await trial on money-laundering charges, was 
known as the "treasurer" of the Medellin cartel. 
</P>
<P>
Pelaez was arrested last month in Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
Tamayo, like Pelaez an accused member of the Medellin cartel, was jailed Aug. 
23 in the Colombian resort city of Cartagena. Carlini, son of Italian 
immigrants, was jailed in Cartagena a week later. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the killing of broadcast journalist Bendeck coincided with continued 
threats by drug traffickers on the lives of employees of El Espectador, a 
Bogota newspaper whose offices were bombed and seriously damaged Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Medellin cartel was directly linked to the killing of two employees of El 
Espectador in Medellin last Tuesday, and anonymous callers threatened to kill 
more employees of the newspaper's Medellin bureau unless they leave town. A 
magazine director was also slain Tuesday in Medellin. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Bendeck, director of a local radio news program in Monteria, about 
300 miles north of Bogota, was shot and killed by two gunmen in front of his 
home Friday night. The killers escaped on a motorcycle.

Police had no suspects in Bendeck's killing, but Colombia's leading newspaper, 
El Tiempo of Bogota, described him as a "passionate" opponent of the drug 
cartels and guerrilla groups allied with them. 
</P>
<P>
In another action Friday, Colombia deported a Canadian citizen arrested in 
Cartagena. Richard Houle, who had been living in Colombia for four years, was 
reported by the Bogota newspaper La Prensa to have operated a drug ring in the 
Caribbean port and to be wanted by Canadian authorities on cocaine smuggling 
charges.SH

BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The first and still the most important drug lord Colombia has extradited to the 
United States is Carlos Lehder Rivas, 38, a Medellin cartel partner. He was 
called one of the top three cocaine kingpins in the world. Colombian troops 
swooped down on his ranch and arrested him and 14 bodyguards in 1987. A 
flamboyant figure, he once announced he would pay $350,000 to anyone who would 
kill the head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. He went on trial in 
Jacksonville, Fla. In July, 1988, a federal judge sentenced him to life in 
prison plus 135 years for importing 3.3 tons of cocaine into the United States.

OFFICIAL SETS MODEST GOALS FOR U.S.-JAPAN TRADE

U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills said Saturday that the United States 
expects only a "blueprint" for reform and a "small down payment" in action when 
a yearlong set of negotiations to remove structural barriers to trade between 
Japan and the United States end next summer. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called Structural Impediment Initiative, she told a breakfast meeting at 
the American Chamber of Commerce, is not aimed at getting "definitive action by 
spring or summer. It is rather to have a blueprint draft . . . and then perhaps 
to have a down payment to show some small steps to convince the American people 
and Japanese people that we're moving in earnest." 
</P>
<P>
Later, she told a group of American reporters that "I would not dream that the 
macroeconomic factors (that contribute to the trade imbalance) we're addressing 
in the Structural Impediments Initiative will be dramatically changed in the 
next nine months or 12 months." 
</P>
<P>
The "down payment" on reforms to be pledged in the negotiations, she said, is 
needed "to get away from the concern that (might be) expressed that 'Is this 
just another report?' " 
</P>
<P>
Hills said it might take "several years" to fully remove structural impediments 
to trade, which include such factors as Japan's distribution system, business 
customs and the propensity to save. But she said reforms could bring a 
"geometric increase in prosperity" in "the next century." 
</P>
<P>
Her meetings with Japanese officials convinced her that "we can get our report 
out in time" to meet deadlines that have been set. An interim report is to be 
produced by March, with the final report due next summer. 
</P>
<P>
Although she called her meetings here "constructive," Hills admitted that an 
appointment with Justice Minister Masao Goto was canceled at the last minute. 
She said she did not know the reason for the cancellation, which was scheduled 
to discuss discrimination against American lawyers in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Cancellation of a meeting with a visiting American Cabinet member is extremely 
rare. 
</P>
<P>
Hills, visiting Japan for the first time since joining the Bush Cabinet, told 
the American reporters that her visit gave her an opportunity to get to know 
officials she had not met before. But, when asked to enumerate substantive 
results, she offered none. 
</P>
<P>
One businessman at the breakfast surprised Hills by telling her that the 
American Chamber of Commerce had surveyed its members on problems they found 
with Japan's distribution system and that "65 of the 70 members who responded 
said there isn't any problem with distribution in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
Hills replied by saying that "foreign companies that have located in a market 
that is regarded as relatively closed have less of an interest to open that 
market to newcomers. But our trade policy is that the market must be open to 
all comers." 
</P>
<P>
Hills also charged that the U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement that the 
Reagan Administration negotiated in 1986 amounted to "selling ourselves short" 
by setting a goal for American chip makers to win 20% of the Japanese market by 
1991. Their present share is 11%.

EX-JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER TANAKA RETIRES 
</P>

<P>
Former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, 71, who held his seat in Parliament 
through the turmoil of being arrested and convicted of accepting a $1.8-million 
bribe and after suffering a stroke, announced Saturday through his adopted 
son-in-law that he is retiring from politics. 
</P>
<P>
Naoki Tanaka, himself a member of Parliament, told Tanaka's supporters in 
Niigata prefecture (state) that their mentor will not run in the next 
lower-house election. 
</P>
<P>
Although the stroke in February, 1985, ended the one-time political kingmaker's 
clout -- not once has he appeared in public since -- the retirement 
announcement stirred a flurry of comment from politicians and business leaders. 
The media treated the news in banner headlines, almost as if it were an 
obituary. 
</P>
<P>
Admirers and critics both proclaimed it the end of an era in Japanese politics. 
</P>
<P>
"Recalling his unparalleled dynamism, it makes me feel lonely," said Prime 
Minister Toshiki Kaifu, whose own mentor, the late Prime Minister Takeo Miki, 
permitted authorities to arrest Tanaka in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
In the announcement, the politician once nicknamed "the computerized bulldozer" 
thanked his supporters for sending him to the lower house in 16 elections 
beginning in 1947, prayed for the continued development of "my beloved Niigata" 
and declared that his 42-year political career contained "not one regret." 
</P>
<P>
Although forced out of the prime minister's post by accusations of illicit 
financial dealings in 1974 and stung by his arrest two years later in the 
Lockheed scandal, Tanaka built up the largest faction of members of Parliament 
that any leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party had ever amassed. At its 
peak, more than 140, or 18%, of the members of both houses of Parliament 
pledged their obedience to the man whose formal education ended with the 10th 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
Remnants of the Tanaka faction, now led by former Prime Minister Noboru 
Takeshita, remain the main bloc of power in the ruling party today. 
</P>
<P>
Tanaka's retirement, ironically, creates an opportunity for the ruling party to 
gain a seat in the next election. He abandoned party membership after his 
arrest and is listed as an unaffiliated representative. 
</P>
<P>
An appeal of his bribery conviction is pending before the Supreme Court.

A band of armed robbers escaped with $3.5 million in cash and checks in the 
third and largest heist at Messina's main railway station post office in two 
years, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said five or six masked gunmen armed with shotguns, pistols and clubs 
rushed into the complex Friday night when a door opened to allow a truck to 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the gunmen forced workers to open a safe containing cash and 
pension checks. The robbers loaded 125 postal sacks filled with cash and checks 
into a truck and made their escape within 15 minutes of gaining access to the 
office.

APARTHEID FOES STAGE S. AFRICA 'VICTORY MARCHES' 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tens of thousands of black workers and anti-apartheid activists, many carrying 
banners of the outlawed African National Congress and celebrating the imminent 
release of key ANC leaders, marched through the streets of more than a dozen 
South African cities Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Listening to militant anti-government speeches, and wearing placards saying 
"Long Live the ANC," the protesters sang and danced in the downtown streets as 
police, for the most part, watched quietly from a distance. 
</P>
<P>
"We are marching to freedom," Moses Mayekiso, general secretary of the National 
Union of Mineworkers, told about 12,000 who had marched from a downtown church 
to the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. "We must give them (the 
government) the message that their time is over. They are talking about 
negotiation. We say they must scrap apartheid, imperialism, colonialism and 
capitalism." 
</P>
<P>
The marches, approved in advance by local officials, were organized by the 
Congress of South African Trade Unions to protest new labor laws that unions 
say will restrict their ability to strike. But in recent days, organizers had 
said the demonstrations also would serve as "victory marches" to welcome the 
release, expected within a day or two, of eight prominent black nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa's black townships have been tense in recent days as residents 
anticipate the arrival, after 26 years in jail, of Walter Sisulu, the 
77-year-old former ANC general secretary, and seven other political prisoners. 
Sisulu and five others were moved from Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town to a 
prison near Soweto, the Johannesburg township that is Sisulu's home, on Friday 
in preparation for their release. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the marches were peaceful, although police said several people were 
arrested in Pietermaritzburg during a protest for breaking shop and bus windows 
and looting. March marshals kept most of the protests quiet, although riot 
police in Johannesburg ordered more than 10,000 people who had gathered at the 
final destination of the march to disperse, giving them an hour to do so. They 
left without incident. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 10,000 activists marched in Port Elizabeth, 2,000 in Bloemfontein, 
the conservative provincial capital of the Orange Free State, and several 
thousand in Durban. Several hundred marched in Secunda, where a municipal judge 
had approved the protest but the right-wing Conservative Party-controlled town 
council had denied permission. 
</P>
<P>
In Cape Town, where about 5,000 joined the march, demonstrators took down the 
South African flag in front of Parliament and placed flags of the ANC and the 
outlawed South African Communist Party over a statue of former Prime Minister 
Louis Botha. 
</P>
<P>
The Afrikaner Resistance Movement, a militant group of right-wing whites, 
issued a statement Saturday condemning "these Communist-inspired protest 
marches" and warned that if President Frederik W. de Klerk allows such protests 
to continue, the movement would find a way to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
DeKlerk has taken the first steps toward creating a climate for negotiations 
with the black majority by allowing anti-government protests previously 
considered illegal under the state of emergency. He then ordered the release of 
the eight prisoners, including seven who have spent a quarter-century in jail.

A spare engine computer checked out Saturday and NASA cleared the space shuttle 
Atlantis for a Tuesday launch with the Jupiter-bound Galileo probe. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the countdown, interrupted after a previous computer developed a 
problem, would resume at 9:01 p.m. PDT today, aiming for liftoff during a 
26-minute period starting at 9:57 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The faulty computer, which forced postponement of a planned Thursday launch, 
was removed and a spare was installed Friday. Testing of the new unit was 
completed Saturday and workers began closing up the engine compartment, 
removing work platforms and reinstalling heat shields. 
</P>
<P>
The 230-pound, $6-million computer controls all functions of one of Atlantis' 
three main engines during launch. Its failure could lead to an engine shutdown 
and an emergency landing. 
</P>
<P>
The five astronauts who will fly the mission returned here from their training 
base in Houston. They had gone back there after the Thursday launch date was 
scrubbed. 
</P>
<P>
The crew members are commander Donald Williams, pilot Mike McCulley and mission 
specialists Ellen Baker, Franklin Chang-Diaz and Shannon Lucid. 
</P>
<P>
During the five-day mission, the astronauts are to release the nuclear-powered 
Galileo spacecraft on the start of a six-year journey to Jupiter. The craft is 
to shoot a probe into the Jovian atmosphere and orbit the planet, examining it 
for 22 months. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge on Tuesday rejected a request by three environmental groups to 
halt the flight for fear that the Galileo could scatter plutonium, its nuclear 
fuel, over Florida if the shuttle exploded. The groups have appealed. 
</P>
<P>
A long-range weather forecast said conditions on Tuesday will be 70% favorable. 
Weather officials said there was a 20% probability of showers or thunderstorms 
and a 10% chance of winds from the southeast exceeding the launch limit of 23 
m.p.h.

<P>
The 2,000 residents of Louisiana's only inhabited barrier island were asked to 
evacuate Saturday as Tropical Storm Jerry churned through the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
After the storm weakened, a hurricane watch for the coast from the mouth of the 
Mississippi River west to Port Arthur, Tex., was changed to a less serious 
tropical storm watch. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service reported that the storm had slowed, with maximum 
sustained winds down from 70 m.p.h. to near 65 m.p.h., and movement 
north-northeast at about 6 m.p.h., down from 13 m.p.h. The storm was expected 
to reach land today at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
Oil companies continued evacuating the more than 4,000 people who work on 
offshore rigs, Texas authorities mobilized emergency workers, and Mississippi 
officials worried about whether they would have to postpone a special election 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In Grand Isle, Mayor Andy Valence said he asked residents to evacuate starting 
Saturday morning, even though the storm's main effect at the time was good 
fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic appeared normal in both directions on Louisiana Highway 1, the only 
road connecting the island to the mainland, but Valence estimated that up to 
1,000 people had left by midday. He said most of the 150 or so boats moored at 
Grand Isle left Friday at his request to avoid tie-ups at a drawbridge. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal flooding was a major concern. Because of the way the Earth, sun and 
moon are aligned, tides through Friday are expected to peak at their highest 
levels in a decade.

185 ARRESTED WHILE TRYING TO BLOCK ABORTION CLINICS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 185 Operation Rescue anti-abortion activists in Chicago and Boston 
were arrested Saturday for attempting to block abortion clinics in the face of 
counterdemonstrations by abortion rights advocates, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, 116 protesters were booked on charges of mob action and resisting 
arrest, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests began after a crowd of about 300 people shouting and carrying signs 
prevented the American Women's Medical Center on the North Side from opening as 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
"They are determined to shut us down," said Karen Burns, a spokeswoman for the 
clinic. "We have a court injunction against what they are doing. I guess we 
will just have to go back to court." 
</P>
<P>
Some Operation Rescue protesters read Scriptures and sang hymns as they marched 
around the clinic. Others held signs, including one that showed an aborted 
fetus wrapped in an American flag. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 members of an abortion rights group called Emergency Clinic Defense 
Coalition arrived at the clinic at about 11 a.m. to stage a counter-protest. 
</P>
<P>
The group displayed banners and signs that read: "Honk if you're pro-choice." 
Several passing motorists honked their horns, but police told the abortion 
rights advocates they would be arrested if they did not turn the signs away 
from motorists. Officers cited an ordinance that prohibits using car horns 
except in the event of an "imminent emergency." 
</P>
<P>
In Boston, police arrested 69 anti-abortion protesters for blocking entrances 
to a women's clinic there during a demonstration by an estimated 300 Operation 
Rescue members and sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion-rights advocates, including National Organization for Women President 
Molly Yard, staged a simultaneous counterdemonstration outside the GyneCare 
clinic. Participants said there were some pushing and shouting matches. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth protest that the Operation Rescue anti-abortion group has 
staged at GyneCare in the last year, police said. All but one of those arrested 
were charged with disorderly conduct and released, police said. One man was 
charged with assault and battery and was to be arraigned Monday in Boston 
Municipal Court.

FRAUDULENT TITLE TRANSFERS A SNAP IN STATE; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: IN CALIFORNIA, PROPERTY CAN BE TRANSFERRED WITH AN OWNER'S SIGNATURE ON A 
GRANT DEED AND A NOTARY SEAL. THE COUNTY RECORDER'S OFFICE IS NOT REQUIRED TO 
VERIFY THE REAL ESTATE DOCUMENTS IT REGISTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities express frustration at the difficulty in catching unscrupulous real 
estate operators. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many other parts of the country, the law and real estate practices in 
California make it very easy to fraudulently transfer title of property. 
</P>
<P>
The transfer of property can be achieved with nothing more than an owner's 
signature on a grant deed and a notary seal. The county recorder's office is 
not required to make any effort to verify the real estate documents it 
registers. 
</P>
<P>
Once the document is recorded, it automatically becomes part of the official 
title chain, and the new owner -- legitimate or not -- can take out loans or 
even sell the property. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to do and a relatively large amount of money is involved," said 
Sheriff's Detective Tom Hart. "The risks are minimal (to unscrupulous 
operators) and the rewards are great." 
</P>
<P>
When fraud is carried out, it is often buried in a long string of paper work. 
Investigating such paper trails requires real estate expertise that law 
enforcement agencies complain they do not have. 
</P>
<P>
And in places where there is expertise, such as the state Department of Real 
Estate, there are no criminal investigators. Pending legislation, however, 
would give real estate regulators search warrant powers they currently do not 
have, thus strengthening their ability to build cases against lawbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also point to laxity in the regulation of the notary public business. 
In several court cases involving real estate fraud, serious questions have 
arisen about the legitimacy of some notary seals. The signatures of homeowners 
known to be in convalescent homes or hospitals have in some cases appeared as 
notarized authorizations to sell property, according to lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the state employs only three investigators for notaries public. 
There are about 150,000 licensed notaries public in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say there is often confusion about whether the abuses committed 
fall under criminal or civil jurisdiction. The statute of limitations is 
relatively short -- three years for forgery and two for fraud -- and has often 
gotten dangerously close to expiring by the time the victim realizes his home 
is no longer in his name. 
</P>
<P>
Further, prosecutors and investigators say they often need multiple victims 
before a clear pattern can be established sufficient to incriminate those 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
There are laws on the books that would prevent some of the abuse, such as the 
Home Equity Sales Contract Act and the Mortgage Foreclosure Consultant Act, 
both of which lay down rules for how contracts should be written and how sales 
of foreclosure property should be conducted. But many people find ways around 
the laws or ignore some of the requirements, public-interest attorneys say. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, experts in real estate say, there is little regulation that can stop 
frauds that work because of the gullibility, desperation or ignorance of 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, you're trying to protect people from themselves," said James N. 
Laichas, senior vice president of Ticor Title Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, equity schemes straddle a narrow line between what is legal and what 
is not, what constitutes questionable business ethics and what constitutes a 
crime. For example, lenders are not legally required to verify the 
credit-worthiness of someone taking out a home equity loan, but many of the 
loans carry terms or payments that are far beyond what the borrower can meet, 
and he is certain to default. 
</P>
<P>
"When there is forgery, it is clearly a crime," said Compton Deputy City Atty. 
Wilmont Odom. "The problem is those who dance on the edge of the law." 
</P>
<P>
Whether they can be prosecuted or not, questionable property transfers 
increasingly are ending up in court. 
</P>
<P>
Paul E. Lee, director of litigation for the Legal Aid Foundation of Los 
Angeles, has represented several defendants in alleged equity fraud cases. "At 
any one time, we have 30 to 40 cases in court," he said, "and a new one comes 
in virtually every day."

TORRANCE FACILITY PUTS 'GEE WHIZ!' INTO SCIENCE CLASSES 
</P>

<P>
Inside one classroom, 30 students squealed with delight at flickering computer 
screens. Next door, other children whooped exuberantly as they sat inside an 
inflated planetarium. Outside, dozens of equally noisy youngsters added to the 
din as they chased after giant soap bubbles. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the myth of the golden virtue of classroom silence. The smiling 
instructors of these children did nothing to quiet their charges. 
</P>
<P>
The constant clamor is exactly what they had in mind. And they hope to see 
plenty more of it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping someday all of our classrooms will look like this, or better," 
said Lucille LeMieux, a Torrance Unified School District curriculum consultant, 
gesturing to a room crowded with computers and high-tech teaching gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
"Our district is committed to preparing students for the 21st Century," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, district officials will stage an official dedication of their new 
"classroom of the future," called the Textor Room, and its next-door neighbor, 
the Discovery Center, both located at the Levy Curriculum Center in south 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Built with a $36,000 bequest from the estate of a former Torrance teacher, Mae 
Grudin Harris-Textor, and a $167,000 special federal grant, the two rooms are 
intended to bring science and math lessons alive as one intriguing whole. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance district's vision of education's high-tech future, one of 361 
grant requests filed nationwide, so impressed federal officials that they 
awarded the Discovery Center one of the largest of 29 math and science grants 
given nationwide, according to Department of Education spokeswoman Jane 
Glickman. The Torrance grant also was the only one given to a California school 
district, she said. 
</P>
<P>
With the money, district officials have created a mini-museum of science, 
crammed with modern equipment and space-age experiments, with a healthy mix of 
time-honored teaching tools, such as wooden dowels, straws and Lego pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Students from any school in Torrance -- public or private -- are welcome to use 
the center, LeMieux said, noting that morning sessions at the center -- when 
bus transportation for public students is most readily available -- are almost 
completely booked for this school year. 
</P>
<P>
Schools close enough for children to walk to the center have some classes 
scheduled to visit the center every week, LeMieux said. Others hope to bring in 
some students as often as once a month. 
</P>
<P>
LeMieux, who first conceived of the Discovery Center and was one of six 
instructors who wrote the grant application, said one of the central ideas was 
to create a place where teachers uncomfortable with science and math could ease 
their anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer months, teachers unfamiliar with the intricacies of science 
and math filled the Discovery Center, learning by enjoying the same experiments 
that they now use to teach their students. 
</P>
<P>
They played with a ruby red laser, bouncing it off quartz, light bulbs and milk 
cartons to see what they could learn about its light. They experimented with 
"stream tables," tanks filled with water and grains of silicon to show how 
erosion works. 
</P>
<P>
In the Textor Room, they learned how to operate a space-age blackboard that 
prints out duplicates of everything written on its surface and a poster-maker 
that turns information written on small sheets of paper into classroom-size 
enlargements. 
</P>
<P>
"The teachers sounded just like the kids. They were saying, 'Oooh, aaaah,' " 
said Magruder Middle School teacher Kathy Cleary, who both taught and learned 
during the summer sessions and who helped write the grant. 
</P>
<P>
The idea behind both the teacher training and the student sessions is to get 
everyone to figure out what is happening and why. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to just come in and cookbook them. We try to lead them into 
making a discovery because they buy into it that way," said Chuck Pillet, a 
Torrance district science mentor teacher who has helped select and set up the 
center's equipment. 
</P>
<P>
All the kids know is that they get to have a darned good time. 
</P>
<P>
"Rad!" "Cool!" "Neato!" yelled enthusiastic 8- and 9-year-olds from Yukon and 
Walteria elementary schools as each new experiment and demonstration unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
Students in the Textor Room, given a random collection of computer disks, 
eagerly jumped from screen to screen, ordering musical lions to appear, 
answering animated math questions and watching planets orbit through the solar 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Walteria teacher Kay Griffith gathered the children around to look at a 
rainbow-hued laser video disk. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember how we learned about all the information you can put on one of those 
computer disks?" Griffith asked the class. "Well, this one record holds as much 
as 40,000 computer disks." 
</P>
<P>
The children stared at the video disk with renewed appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to have a classroom like this all the time," said Amie Hagins, 9, who 
said she plans to become either "a cake-maker or someone who discovers 
crystals." 
</P>
<P>
Outside, budding planet researcher Martin Mora, 8, from Yukon school learned 
about surface tension by creating gigantic soap bubbles. Noting that one of his 
bubbles "looks just like Earth," Martin said he wants to keep coming back to 
the Discovery Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is really fun, and I'm glad they earned the money to make this 
for us," he said.

UCLA CAN'T LOOK ARIZONA IN THE I IN 42-7 LOSS 
</P>

<P>
The crimson hue on the faces of UCLA players and coaches Saturday as they 
walked out of Arizona Stadium had less to do with the desert heat than with the 
fact that the Bruins were caught unprepared for changes in Arizona's offense 
and were overwhelmed by the Wildcats, 42-7. 
</P>
<P>
Unprepared? 
</P>
<P>
How else to explain 480 yards rushing by the Wildcats, a record for a UCLA 
opponent and only 12 shy of an Arizona school record? 
</P>
<P>
Or 27 first downs by rushing, which was a school record? 
</P>
<P>
UCLA hadn't been beaten so decisively in a Pacific 10 Conference game since 
Nov. 24, 1979, when USC crushed the Bruins, 49-14, at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
But that was a great USC team, led by Heisman Trophy winner Charles White and 
owner of an 11-0-1 record that left it No. 2 in the final polls. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona, which improved its record to 4-2, averaged only 246.6 total yards in 
its first five games, ranked last in the Pac-10 in total offense and passing 
offense, and scored only six touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
But, running out of the I formation for the first time this season, the 
Wildcats ravaged UCLA for 505 total yards, the most given up by the Bruins 
since Sept. 14, 1985, when Tennessee gained 510 yards in a 26-26 tie at 
Knoxville, Tenn., and doubled their season touchdown total. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst licking we've taken in a long, long time," said Terry 
Donahue, whose teams have lost by more than 35 points only once in his 14 
seasons as UCLA's head coach. "I'm not sure I can remember a more inept 
performance by one of my teams." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, after Arizona generated only 161 total yards in a 16-10 loss to 
Oregon, Wildcat Coach Dick Tomey dispatched two of his assistants to Boulder, 
Colo., to study Colorado's offensive formations. 
</P>
<P>
Ten days ago, Tomey implemented the Buffaloes' option I. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue, believing that Arizona would continue to run a triple-option offense 
out of several formations -- the Wildcats had a bye last week -- said UCLA 
practiced very little against the I. 
</P>
<P>
How about not at all? 
</P>
<P>
"Everything except the I formation, we prepared for," said Mike Lodish, a UCLA 
senior defensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Safety Eric Turner said that UCLA prepared to face the wishbone and the 
run-and-shoot, Arizona's favored formations in recent seasons. 
</P>
<P>
How confused were the Bruins? 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Craig Davis, explaining Arizona's offensive success, said: "When a 
team makes its blocks and you miss your tackles, especially in the wishbone, 
you've got one guy left over and if he misses the tackle, you're (in a lot of 
trouble)." 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats seldom ran out of the wishbone formation. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA didn't anticipate the speed of the Wildcat offense, Lodish said. "Their 
backs, I guess, were (lined up) so close to the line that they hit (the line of 
scrimmage) right away. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for a defensive lineman to get off the block and react. You don't 
have much time to think." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona quarterback Ronald Veal disputed that notion. 
</P>
<P>
"Our backs were a little deeper," Veal said of the I-formation, "and they were 
able to read the blocks." 
</P>
<P>
Even after they had experienced the Wildcats' new formation, the Bruins seemed 
mixed up. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the ball, nobody was more excited about the offensive 
changes than tailback David Eldridge, who ran for 205 yards and two touchdowns 
in 20 carries, averaging more than 10 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
Veal ran for 81 yards and two touchdowns in 11 carries and freshman running 
back Errol Sapp, L.A. City player of the year last season at Carson High 
School, ran for 77 yards and a touchdown in 12 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Both coaches, however, attempted to downplay the significance of the Wildcats' 
new alignments. 
</P>
<P>
"It appeared from my vantage point that they could have been in any formation 
they wanted to be in and it wouldn't have made a whole lot of difference," 
Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
Tomey said that the Wildcats ran the same plays that they usually do, but just 
ran them out of different formations. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest difference was the way we blocked," he said. "If you line up in 
this formation or that formation, you've still got to block." 
</P>
<P>
Somebody must have been blocking because Eldridge and Co. ran through some 
gaping holes in the Bruins' defense. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA won the coin toss before the game, elected to kick off and its day went 
downhill from there. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona, in its new offense, took the kick and drove 80 yards in seven plays, 
none of which gained fewer than eight yards. Eldridge, who carried four times 
for 45 yards, scored the touchdown on a 19-yard run up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after UCLA's first possession went three plays and out, Arizona drove 82 
yards in six plays. A 54-yard run by Eldridge around the left end of the line 
made it 14-0 with 7:44 still left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In its fourth possession, Arizona drove 78 yards in 16 plays to another 
touchdown, aided by a curious decision by Donahue at the end. 
</P>
<P>
An Arizona player was called for holding on a second-down play at UCLA's 
nine-yard line, but the Bruins declined the penalty. Fullback Mario Hampton 
scored on a 10-yard run on the very next play, charging untouched through the 
middle and into the end zone to make it 21-0 with 9:28 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, UCLA had 21 total yards and one first down. Arizona had 246 
yards and 17 first downs. 
</P>
<P>
How poorly was the day going for the Bruins? 
</P>
<P>
With 4:53 left in the half, quarterback Bret Johnson positioned kicker Alfredo 
Velasco for a 36-yard field-goal attempt, only to watch Velasco's kick glance 
off a goalpost upright and fall wide to the left. 
</P>
<P>
In 30 previous attempts inside 40 yards, Velasco had not missed. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the half, Donahue replaced Johnson with seldom-used sophomore Jim 
Bonds, whose first pass was almost intercepted by cornerback Darryl Lewis, who 
would have scored if he hadn't dropped the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds' second pass was picked off by linebacker Chris Singleton, setting up a 
seven-yard touchdown run by Veal that made it 28-0. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona, which rolled up 286 total yards in the first half to UCLA's 110, 
waited until the second possession of the second half to make it 35-0. Veal 
scored on a one-yard run at the end of a 65-yard drive that featured 27 yards 
rushing in three carries by Eldridge and a 24-yard scramble by Veal that put 
the Wildcats at the Bruins' 12-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Sapp made it 42-0 with 7:25 left, scoring on a spectacular 14-yard run at the 
end of a 74-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, which hasn't been shut out in a national-record 211 games since Sept. 24, 
1971, saved some face when it scored with 4:14 left at the end of a 69-yard 
drive led by Bonds. Brian Brown got the touchdown on a two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
That, however, seemed of little consolation to Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
"The game, obviously, was a real nightmare for us," he said. "Arizona played a 
great game in every aspect of the contest and was decisively, far and away, the 
better team in every category and deserved the lopsided victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very disappointed. We had a bad day at the office." 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
UCLA fell to 3-3 overall and 2-1 in the Pac-10 and fell out of a first-place 
tie with USC. . . . Arizona is 3-1 in the Pac-10. . . . UCLA's Kevin Williams 
ran for 79 yards in 11 carries. His 23-yard run on the last play of the first 
half was the Bruins' longest run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA quarterback Bret Johnson completed 11 of 22 passes for 135 yards and had 
two passes intercepted in the second half. . . . Jim Bonds was five of eight 
for 56 yards and also had two passes intercepted. . . . Mike Farr caught three 
passes to move past Cormac Carney and Karl Dorrell and into second-place on 
UCLA's all-time reception list with 110.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House voted 360 to 62 to cancel a 1988 Medicare expansion designed to 
protect the elderly and disabled against catastrophic hospital, doctor and 
prescription drug costs. The repeal was included in budget reconciliation 
legislation (HR 3299) later sent to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 14-month-old Catastrophic Coverage Act, Medicare beneficiaries must 
pay for the expanded benefits. Most of the cost falls on those with enough 
means to pay federal income taxes, with many of the elderly paying up to $800 
annually in tax surcharges. The repeal effort answers protests from those who 
would finance the catastrophic coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Repeal advocate Roy Rowland (D-Ga.) said Congress "made a mistake" in enacting 
the 1988 law. "Let us face it . . . let us correct this mistake completely." 
</P>
<P>
Pete Stark (D-Oakland) said the House was being "stampeded by a group 
representing a small group of the wealthiest seniors to deny needed benefits to 
a majority of seniors." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to repeal the 1988 Catastrophic Coverage Act.

Child Care Legislation 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 195 to 230, the House rejected the less extensive of two proposals 
before it for expanding the federal role in providing child care. This cleared 
the way for approval of legislation to provide several billion dollars over 
five years in areas such as expanding Head Start, increasing child-care tax 
credits, funding state programs for children and setting federal quality 
standards for child-care personnel and facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Included in budget reconciliation legislation (HR 3299), the 
Democratic-authored program was backed by labor, education and civil rights 
groups. The alternative defeated by this vote was supported by President Bush 
and business groups. It cost less than the successful measure, did not 
establish federal standards, gave more emphasis to programs run by the private 
sector and was more beneficial to church-run programs. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Petri (R-Wis.) said the alternative relied on choice by parents rather 
than "social engineering" to achieve its objectives. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported a less extensive federal approach to child care.

3026). It urged them to accept Senate language keeping Georgetown University, a 
Catholic institution, from being penalized for declining to accommodate gay 
student organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) said the main issue was Georgetown University's 
freedom to practice religion. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said "this amendment picks on a minority that is 
not popular" and resembles "the same kind of onslaught that we saw in Nazi 
Germany." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to protect Georgetown University against D.C.'s gay 
rights law.

To Restore Fairness Doctrine 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 162 to 261, the House rejected an amendment in opposition to the 
"fairness doctrine." The vote preserved language in a budget reconciliation 
bill (HR 3299) restoring the federal requirement that broadcasters give 
opposing views on key issues a chance to be heard. The doctrine was repealed in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
Amendment supporter Harold Rogers (R-Ky.) said "how dare this Congress even 
contemplate a law which would fine broadcasters whose news coverage the 
government does not like." 
</P>
<P>
John Dingell (D-Mich.) said it is "only fair than when broadcasters own that 
wonderful right to use that money machine which they are given by the FCC, that 
they should use it in the public interest." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes opposed reinstatement of the fairness doctrine.

HOMES THAT CAPTURED THE DREAM; 
</P>
<P>
INNOVATIVE CASE STUDY PROGRAM REDEFINED RESIDENTIAL ARCHITECTURE IN POSTWAR 
L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON, Whiteson is a Los Angeles free-lancer who writes on 
architectural topics. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It all seemed so excitingly simple in postwar America. The prosperity of the 
1940s and '50s made the American dream -- every family cozy and happy in its 
own home -- seem more attainable than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
More than any other U.S. city, Los Angeles was buoyant upon a tide of optimism. 
The war had transformed it from a big, sleepy town of orange groves and the 
Hollywood movie studios into an industrialized city bursting with energy and 
fresh talent in a wide range of endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles was a wonderful place to be in the 1950s," said designer Craig 
Ellwood. "The city was wide open, eager for experiment. The feeling that, 
finally, we were going to get the chance to create a truly honest architecture 
was like wine in the air." 
</P>
<P>
In this heady atmosphere, Ellwood, along with a group of talented Los Angeles 
architects and designers, including Charles and Ray Eames, Richard Neutra, 
Raphael Soriano, Pierre Koenig, Whitney Smith, Quincy Jones, Ed Killingsworth 
and Ralph Rapson, plus Michigan's Eero Saarinen, set out to redefine the 
character of the American home. 
</P>
<P>
The series of innovative houses they designed in a program titled "Case Study 
House" had a major impact on domestic architecture on the West Coast, across 
the United States and around the world. 
</P>
<P>
A multimedia exhibit commemorating the houses, "Blueprints for Modern Living: 
History and Legacy of the Case Study Houses (1945-1966)," will open Tuesday at 
the Museum of Contemporary Art's Temporary Contemporary, 152 N. Central Ave. It 
runs to Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
The 36 Case Study houses designed between 1945 and 1962, 24 of which were 
built, embodied the architects' vision of a typical single-family home that was 
aesthetically avant-garde, yet thoroughly practical and affordable. 
</P>
<P>
The Case Study program developed several major innovations that later became 
standard in popular house design. Among them were: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The open-plan house with a minimum of internal walls to allow the interior 
to be flexible and seem spacious. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The integration of indoor and outdoor living through the use of sliding 
glass screens. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The reversal of the traditional home plan by relocating the living rooms at 
the rear of the house, away from the street. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The emphasis on exposing a building's structural frame, particularly where 
houses were constructed of steel, persists in contemporary architecture around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
Case Study architects believed that a house that directly expressed the way it 
was constructed, that was open in plan and filled with light and sunshine, that 
was put together with standardized components to be mass produced as cheaply as 
the family car, would set the stage for new chapter in the American dream. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these designers became world famous, including Neutra, Eames and 
Saarinen. Others, including Ellwood, Killingsworth, Quincy Jones, Koenig and 
Soriano, were widely recognized as leading innovators of postwar American 
modern architecture. Several fell away into obscurity in the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
The Case Study program was the brainchild of John Entenza, the visionary editor 
of the Los Angeles-based Arts &amp; Architecture magazine. 
</P>
<P>
An intellectual with an arts degree from the University of Virginia and a 
generous inheritance to spend upon his missionary fervor, Entenza sensed the 
changes that World War II would generate in U.S. society and foresaw the 
tremendous technological advances the wartime industries would foster. 
</P>
<P>
As early as 1943, Entenza sponsored a competition: "Designs for Postwar 
Living." In an editorial on this competition Entenza looked forward to a new 
breed of American worker who would be "better trained, more technically aware," 
and who would "demand simple, direct and honest efficiency in the material 
aspects of the means by which he lives." 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, when launching the Case Study House program in Arts &amp; 
Architecture, Entenza declared: 
</P>
<P>
"What man has learned about himself in the last five years will express itself 
in the way in which he will want to be housed in the future. . . . It becomes 
the obligation of all those who serve and profit through man's wish to live 
well to take the mysteries and black magic out of the hard facts that go into 
the building of a house." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enlightened Clients 
</P>
<P>
The program depended on Entenza's skills in putting together talented 
architects and enlightened clients. He was the client for one Case Study house, 
designed by Charles Eames and Eero Saarinen on a 5-acre parcel he purchased in 
Pacific Palisades. Eames built a Case Study house and studio for himself on the 
same parcel and it stands today as one of the prime icons of modern residential 
design in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
A third house sharing the same acreage was designed by Richard Neutra, who 
welcomed the opportunity offered by the program's emphasis on standardization 
to engage in "the constant study of one subject" and so not be "haunted by the 
anxiety for originality, the fear of staying too long with one idea. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
As the program got under way, Entenza sought designs for publication in Arts 
&amp; Architecture, and solicited patrons who would be willing to build the 
radically modern homes. 
</P>
<P>
Often clients appeared spontaneously, drawn by the publicity given the Case 
Study designs in Entenza's influential magazine, read by aficionados of modern 
architecture all around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Ellwood recalls the heady feeling when, as a young man of 26, he was invited to 
design a Case Study house. 
</P>
<P>
"The Arts &amp; Architecture offices on Wilshire Boulevard were jammed with 
designers from all over the world," he said. "We really felt we were at the 
heart of things, and John was the heart of the heart." 
</P>
<P>
Pierre Koenig, designer of the dramatic 1959 home perched on a precipice in the 
Hollywood Hills (reproduced in a full scale mock-up at MOCA), said that the 
Case Study houses were "a product of love." 
</P>
<P>
Said Koenig: 
</P>
<P>
"You had to love architecture to put in the long hours and hard sweat to not 
only invent a new design vocabulary but convince reluctant contractors and 
conservative lending institutions, who distrusted modern architecture and 
feared its poor resale value, to go along." 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Rapson's 1945 design for a prototype 1,800-square-foot "Greenbelt" house 
incorporated a number of new ideas that influenced residential architecture at 
every level over the next decades. 
</P>
<P>
The open plan for the Greenbelt house -- which was never built until it was 
constructed in the the MOCA show -- was focused inward on a patio garden to 
engender a sense of privacy on a typical suburban lot. 
</P>
<P>
The light, flat roof floated above walls of glass and plywood that gave a 
feeling of spaciousness. The only solid partitions in the house enclosed the 
bathrooms; all the other walls could be folded back out of sight, to allow 
views out into the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems fundamental to bring nature within the house," Rapson wrote in Arts 
&amp; Architecture. "For once, the complete integration of outside and inside 
will have been accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
Case Study House No. 25, designed for furniture store owner Edward Frank by 
Killingsworth, Brady &amp; Smith in 1962 in the Naples area of Long Beach, was 
the most urban home in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on a narrow lot in a built-up section of this unique water-oriented 
neighborhood, the Frank house fronts onto the Rivo Alto Canal that curves past 
its front door. 
</P>
<P>
The main entry on the canal side is shielded by a big blank wall. A series of 
concrete stepping stones crosses a shallow pool to a 17-foot-high front door. 
The stepping stones both connect the house to the canal-side sidewalk yet 
distance it from public view, and the tall door offers a hint of the spacious 
elegance of the hidden interior. 
</P>
<P>
The two-story house behind the wall is planned around an internal courtyard 
that is an outdoor extension of the large open-plan living and dining room, 
through floor-to-ceiling sliding glass walls. All the main rooms of the house 
look into the courtyard, including the second-floor bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Discreetly Elegant 
</P>
<P>
A pergola of closely spaced slats casts a dazzling grid of shadows over the 
court, changing patterns as the sun moves across the sky. 
</P>
<P>
Now owned by Ron and Karen Van Wert, the house is as simple, private and 
discreetly elegant as the day it was built. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back on the Case Study houses, it is clear that the program's emphasis 
on the single-family home transformed by technological innovation is no longer 
relevant to today's needs. 
</P>
<P>
The era of the ever-expanding suburb, taken as gospel in the 1950s, is over. 
American cities have run out of spare land for the expansion needed to provide 
free-standing homes on separate lots for their swollen populations. 
</P>
<P>
The construction industry has resisted the kind of mass-produced 
standardization Case Study designers hoped would make houses cheaper to build. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the construction process today, despite widespread on-site 
mechanization and a certain amount of prefabrication, essentially continues the 
tedious assemblage of a multitude of materials that goes all the way back to 
the pyramids. 
</P>
<P>
The Case Study architects thought they could reinvent the world. In fact, the 
world has reinvented architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back upon those halcyon Case Study days, Ellwood, who retired from 
architecture in the mid-1970s to live in Tuscany and paint, draws a sharp 
contrast between then and now. "Every time I come back to L.A. it's a culture 
shock for me," he said. "I see more homeless people. I see more stress. I see 
more traffic. I see more ugly buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Current architecture has no ethic and no purpose, Ellwood feels. "Designers 
lack vision. They no longer have any clear view of what to offer people. 
Architecture has became an arm of the fashion industry, changing its skylines 
every year. It lacks the moral force, the urge to create a better world for 
everyone that made the 1950s so exciting."

Peter Bogdanovich once knew a painter who made it a habit not to sign his 
works. When one of his customers insisted on his signature -- years after 
buying a painting -- the artist finally agreed. Arriving with brush and palette 
in hand, he immediately became so distracted by the picture itself that he 
began embellishing his own work. He couldn't help himself, he explained to his 
startled customer, the painting was not quite . . . right. 
</P>
<P>
The painter was Bogdanovich's father. And this family trait -- a refusal to 
leave well enough alone, an insistence on dipping into and altering the past -- 
has infected his son, the Hollywood movie director. Mention any of his movies, 
and Bogdanovich will go on at length about how, if given the chance, he could 
touch it up, add new shadings, make it somehow perfect.

Even the film widely considered his best, "The Last Picture Show," is not 
immune from this diagnosis. In a barren patch of Texas, where the oil boom has 
come and gone, where a relentless orange sun sets behind a few lonely oil rigs 
and mansions rise up off the lowlands alongside ratty homesteads, Bogdanovich 
is reaching back into his past to make "Texasville," the sequel -- 19 years 
later -- to "The Last Picture Show." 
</P>
<P>
But it's more than a need to embellish an early work that brought Bogdanovich 
to Archer City: The director has always had a romance with history. The late 
Esquire editor Harold Hayes once wrote of Bogdanovich's "reverance for the 
past." As a critic and film historian, he has written extensively about the 
film-making of such directors as John Ford, Alfred Hitchock, Howard Hawks and 
Orson Welles. Many of his early films, including "Picture Show," captured a 
part of America that long ago disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
So it's not surprising that Bogdanovich, now at a low point in his career, 
would reach back into his own, much happier past for guidance. Bogdanovich may 
not consider "Picture Show" a perfect work, but it was the one that propelled 
him into Hollywood stardom at age 31. After its release in 1971, the film was 
nominated for eight Academy Awards, including best picture and best director. 
</P>
<P>
Bogdanovich wasn't the only one who first tasted stardom with "Picture Show." 
Cybill Shepherd was transformed overnight from magazine cover girl to Hollywood 
leading lady. At age 20, Jeff Bridges received an Oscar nomination for best 
supporting actor. Timothy Bottoms received critical acclaim in just his second 
movie role; Randy Quaid and Eileen Brennan got plenty of attention for strong 
supporting performances. Cloris Leachman won an Academy Award for best 
supporting actress, and Ellen Burstyn was nominated in the same category. Ben 
Johnson took home an Oscar for best supporting actor. "The Last Picture Show," 
says Bogdanovich, "was a cataclysmic experience for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Johnson and Burstyn, whose characters have died, each of 
these actors is making the arduous journey back to Archer City to appear in 
"Texasville." They are joined by Annie Potts, star of TV's "Designing Women," 
and William McNamara, who stars in the upcoming TV series "Island Sun." 
</P>
<P>
Bogdanovich has nearly as much claim to fame as his returning cast. After 
"Picture 
</P>
<P>
Show," critics compared him to the great, if precocious, director Orson Welles. 
By the time the film hit the theaters, he was in demand by one of Hollywood's 
biggest stars, Barbra Streisand, and the cameras were rolling on their comedy, 
"What's Up Doc?" Another audience pleaser, "Paper Moon," with Ryan O'Neal and 
daughter Tatum (who won an Oscar for her performance) followed. 
</P>
<P>
But since then, Bogdanovich's celebrity has grown as much from his personal 
life as his movie-making skills -- an 8-year relationship with Shepherd that 
broke up his marriage to producer Polly Platt; a short-lived love affair with 
Playboy playmate Dorothy Stratten that ended tragically with her murder at the 
hands of her estranged husband; a subsequent marriage, nine years after 
Stratten's death, to her 20-year-old sister, Louise. 
</P>
<P>
As a film maker, the years since "Paper Moon" have been undistinguished ones 
for Bogdanovich. Two films starring Shepherd, "At Long Last Love" and "Daisy 
Miller," were lambasted by critics and audiences alike ("two of the worst 
modern films imaginable," insist the writers of the annual Motion Picture 
Guide). "Nickelodeon," his 1976 tribute to the film industry's roots, didn't 
fare much better; and "Saint Jack," his character study of an American pimp in 
Singapore, put Bogdanovich back on the map with critics but failed to find a 
broad audience. "They All Laughed," starring Stratten, drove Bogdanovich into 
bankruptcy when he attempted to distribute it himself. 
</P>
<P>
Only in 1985, with the release of "Mask," did Bogdanovich recapture some of his 
lost popularity with audiences. But even that experience turned into a fiasco 
when Bogdanovich and Universal Pictures fell into a bitter public dispute. 
Bogdanovich sued when the studio -- citing CBS Records' demand for a large 
portion of the videocassette sales -- balked at using several Bruce Springsteen 
songs in the soundtrack. Then he publicly attacked the film as "not the movie 
we all made," while its star, Cher, accused Bogdanovich 
</P>
<P>
of "looking after his own interests and not the interests of the film." 
</P>
<P>
After the "Mask" dispute, the director's reputation as an outsider in 
Hollywood, a potential troublemaker, was sealed. None of the major studios 
would finance the $18 million "Texasville," forcing him to turn to independent 
financing from Nelson Entertainment and financial guarantees from Cine-Source. 
Columbia Pictures will distribute the film under an existing partnership with 
Nelson, and may re-release "Picture Show," which is still not on videocassette. 
</P>
<P>
Bogdanovich's decision to make a sequel to "The Last Picture Show" is not just 
an exercise in nostalgia. During the 1980s, his fiancee was murdered, he fell 
into bankruptcy and nearly lost his Bel-Air home, and his professional 
reputation soured. As the 1990s approach, Bogdanovich hopes that by reaching 
into the past, he can propel himself into a more promising future. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember in 1979, I was at an end-of-the-year party and Dorothy was there," 
Bogdanovich says, his voice softening as it always does when he talks about 
Stratten. "We were singing a song called 'Ringing in the '80s.' And I thought, 
wow, this is going to be a great decade. It turned out to be the worst decade 
of my life. But it was probably the most illuminating. I learned more in that 
decade than I did in the previous three combined." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
It's midnight at a rodeo rink in Archer City, and the day is just beginning for 
Bogdanovich and his crew. The 105-degree heat and oppressive humidity has 
finally subsided, and a balmy breeze is kicking up. His graying hair swept 
back, his shirt cuffs unbuttoned in an affectation he picked up from Audrey 
Hepburn, Bogdanovich already looks tired. The weeks of night filming and the 
complexity of the production have taken a toll on everyone. 
</P>
<P>
But Bogdanovich has something else on his mind this night. "It's odd," he says 
about the production, with a hint of melancholy in his voice. "It's difficult." 
That's all he will say for now. Only later does he explain: "You're constantly 
being reminded of that time, 20 years ago. Then it conjures up not just (our 
lives) 20 years ago, but all the 20 years in between." 
</P>
<P>
The 20 years in between didn't turn out quite the way Bogdanovich intended when 
he and his first wife, Polly Platt -- then in their early 20s -- befriended 
some of Hollywood's great directors in the course of writing about them. The 
ambitious young Bogdanovich was anxious to achieve the same level of prominence 
as these film makers. But Platt also recalls that the starry-eyed couple vowed 
not to be seduced by the destructive Hollywood life styles so many of their 
idols had led. Bogdanovich, it turned out, gained the fame he sought but was 
nearly destroyed by the life style. 
</P>
<P>
When she first met him, Bogdanovich was "arrogant, erudite, and cat-like in his 
sense of his own dignity," Platt says. Even when they were broke, living in New 
York, he refused to take the subway. Only a cab would do. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his failures and tragedies, that description still suits Bogdanovich. 
But in another, important way, says Platt, Bogdanovich has changed: "At last he 
has started to relate to something besides movies. People -- real human beings 
versus those on celluloid -- have an equal opportunity with him now." 
</P>
<P>
Platt discovered the book that would become Bogdanovich's career-launching 
film, Larry McMurtry's "The Last Picture Show." Shooting in black and white, 
Bogdanovich created a sad, often bleak, look at adolescent life in a tiny Texas 
town during the 1950s. In its sequel, "Texasville," the central characters are 
now in their late 40s (forcing Bridges, Bottoms, Shepherd and Potts to play 
people 10 years older than they are.) 
</P>
<P>
The parallels between Bogdanovich's own life and "Texasville" are striking. 
Bridges' character, like the 50-year-old Bogdanovich, has been through a 
bankruptcy. Shepherd's character has lost a loved one in a tragic accident. Set 
in 1984, the characters of "Texasville" are grappling with an oil boom gone 
bust, misguided love affairs and the traumas of raising nearly grown children. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to "Picture Show," says Bogdanovich, the lives of the "Texasville" 
characters are "more chaotic, less structured, more fragmented, more insane, 
more desperate. There's something intrinsically tragic about coming-of-age. But 
there's something inherently funny about a mid-life crisis. It can be sad, but 
not tragic. I think 'Texasville' will be lighter on the surface, but down below 
even sadder." 
</P>
<P>
Archer City itself hasn't changed much, though its residents have. There's a 
new glassy bank building -- a remnant of the oil boom -- right around the 
corner from the town's crumbling movie theater, made famous in "Picture Show." 
McMurtry's sister, Sue Deen, has opened an antiquarian bookstore and the locals 
have adopted a new Dairy Queen up the highway as their hang-out. But an earlier 
hub, The Golden Rooster Cafe, is boarded up. So are several other storefronts, 
with no sign that anything will replace them. 
</P>
<P>
The region's dire economic condition is one reason why local residents are more 
hospitable this time around. In 1970, residents decried McMurtry's book and 
Bogdanovich's production, principally because of the sex scenes but also 
because the story hit so close to home. A Baptist minister stood outside the 
set and railed against the film makers for their sinful ways. The county was 
dry then, and the only way cast and crew members could get a drink was through 
a licensed "club" at the Days Inn in Wichita Falls. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot different this time," says Deen, whose family suffered ridicule in 
those days because of her brother's book. "It's the late 1980s, almost the 
'90s. The area needs money. Also, a lot more people are intrigued this time 
with the fame that comes with it. Suddenly I have a lot of friends and a lot of 
relatives I didn't know I had." All are hoping Deen can get them parts as 
extras or sneak them onto the set. 
</P>
<P>
For the cast, too, the experience is different. The salaries on the first film, 
which was produced for $1.3 million, were in the $5,000 to $50,000 range. Now 
commanding star-level pay after her success on TV's "Moonlighting," Shepherd 
gave the producers a break when she accepted $1.5 millon to do "Texasville." 
Bridges is being paid $1.75 million. In 1970, the cast and crew stayed together 
at a Days Inn motel in Witchita Falls. In 1989, Shepherd has rented a house in 
an upscale Wichita Falls neighborhood and Bridges has taken over a suite at the 
Sheraton -- not exactly The Four Seasons, but a far cry from the Days Inn. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the strong emotions that Bogdanovich and his cast may have felt on 
their return to Archer City, the set of "Texasville" can't be completely 
described as the site of a blissful reunion between good friends. Many of the 
actors have not stayed close with Bogdanovich or each other. Stars now, several 
of them shuttle in and out of Texas between other projects. 
</P>
<P>
One actor, Timothy Bottoms, is bitter about his experience with "Picture Show." 
"I didn't want to do this movie because I don't like any of the people in it," 
he says. "I didn't like 'The Last Picture Show.' I didn't like the script. I 
didn't like the people I was working with. I didn't like the way they treated 
each other -- without compassion or care. I felt like I saw Hollywood at its 
worst." 
</P>
<P>
Bottoms agreed to do the part, he says, because "Texasville's" producer, Nelson 
Entertainment, permitted him to make a $100,000 behind-the-scenes documentary 
about both films and the reaction of the local community. 
</P>
<P>
The other actors and Bogdanovich insist that the making of "Picture Show" was a 
much happier experience than that, although Bogdanovich acknowledges that there 
were tensions between him and his crew at the time. 
</P>
<P>
But between Bottoms' animosity, and the distant cordiality some of the other 
actors seem to maintain, there is one very close relationship on the set -- 
Bogdanovich and Shepherd. As Shepherd finishes a scene late one night 
Bogdanovich gently brushes her bare arm with the back of his hand, a gesture 
signaling their continued close friendship some 10 years after their love 
affair ended. 
</P>
<P>
The oft-told story of how Bogdanovich discovered Shepherd is true: He spotted 
her face on the cover of Glamour Magazine as he was standing in a grocery store 
line in the Valley. "There was something witty in the look," the director 
recalls. He thought she was perfect for the part of Jacy Farrow, the small-town 
beauty who, innocently or not, tortures the adoring young men around her. He 
recalls their first meeting, in New York, when the 20-year-old model sat on the 
floor, casually playing with the petals of a rose on the coffee table, while 
she and her agent talked to him about the part. 
</P>
<P>
They began their love affair during the filming of "Picture Show," even while 
Platt -- with two small children -- worked on the set. After the movie's 
success, Bogdanovich slipped easily into big-time Hollywood film making. He was 
cocky, arrogant and determined to make the new love of his life, the vivacious 
young Shepherd, a star. At times, he even referred to her as "Miss Shepherd," 
just as director Josef von Sternberg called the leading lady and love of his 
life, Marlene Dietrich, "Miss Dietrich." 
</P>
<P>
When asked to play the critic on his own career, Bogdanovich says that his 
"work that was uncompromised by interference was clearly the best work." On 
"Nickelodeon," he insists, Columbia Pictures forced him to make compromises on 
the casting and took the bitter out of a bitter-sweet story. "At Long Last 
Love," he says, was rushed out before it was finished. (He later recut the 
musical, and it found a measure of popularity overseas.) "Saint Jack" didn't 
find an audience, he argues, because producer Roger Corman distributed it as an 
exploitation film. 
</P>
<P>
But there is another theory on the director's career: This one holds that 
Bogdanovich can be his own worst enemy. Unlike other directors who work with 
strong producers, Bogdanovich has produced most of his films himself, and often 
writes the screenplays as well. His obsession with making films starring 
Shepherd -- even in roles widely viewed as hopelessly inappropriate -- was an 
example of the director's potential excesses, according to this view, which is 
widely held in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, some of that (criticism) was true," says Eileen Brennan, who had parts 
three films the pair made together. "But so many of (their critics) were silly 
asses. They didn't do it with any dignity. They forgot the films and just 
criticized (Bogdanovich and Shepherd)." 
</P>
<P>
Bogdanovich later wrote that the version of his life making the rounds of 
Hollywood in the late 1970s went something like this: "He broke up his marriage 
with a loyal wife and two kids; made a couple of flop pictures with Shepherd 
and ruined both their careers." 
</P>
<P>
Bogdanovich doesn't completely disagree with that assessment, though he 
continues to defend the films they made together. "We certainly didn't help 
each other's careers after 'The Last Picture Show,' " he says. "We didn't have 
a hit and that's all anybody cares about." 
</P>
<P>
"Peter didn't rescue me, nor did he destroy me," Shepherd says of that period 
in their careers. "You can't play destroyer without playing rescuer." Asked if 
she had any regrets from those years, she says, "I was always happy to have a 
job. The (choices) that I might regret, well, I always needed money to live on. 
I definitely had some regrets, but they're too personal to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
The Shepherd-Bogdanovich relationship survived most of the public snickering, 
but Columbia's refusal to let Shepherd appear in Bogdanovich's 1976 
"Nickelodeon" took a toll. "I think what really screwed us up is that we 
couldn't do 'Nickelodeon' together," says Bogdanovich. "The fact of the matter 
is that Cybill and I had written the part for Cybill. Everything about the 
character was Cybill, only it was a version of her that nobody had ever seen 
because it was the real Cybill." 
</P>
<P>
The pair broke up after living together for eight years. But they've remained 
close friends: Shepherd providing support for Bogdanovich after Stratten's 
death and his bankruptcy that followed; Bogdanovich lending a friendly ear when 
Shepherd was going through a difficult pregnancy and catching flak in the media 
for her reported temper on the "Moonlighting" set. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever blindness that infatuation brought, it's gone," Brennan says of the 
current relationship between Shepherd and Bogdanovich. "He treats her like he 
would treat an actor, much more so than before." 
</P>
<P>
Bogdanovich fell in love with Dorothy Stratten and wanted to make her a star 
too. And once again the director's personal and professional lives blurred. 
</P>
<P>
He first met the luminescent blonde at the Playboy mansion. "I never saw a 
photograph that quite captured her," he says adoringly. Stratten had come to 
Los Angeles via her home in Vancouver, where a manipulative boyfriend years her 
senior convinced her to let him take nude photos of her and send them to 
Playboy. The 18-year-old Stratten quickly became a darling of the magazine, and 
later became Playmate of the Year. The boyfriend, Paul Snider, followed her to 
Los Angeles, married her and began hanging around the Playboy Mansion. 
</P>
<P>
The marriage was in shreds by the time Bogdanovich and Stratten began their 
romance during the making of "They All Laughed" in 1980. But on Aug. 14, just 
months after she had moved into the director's home, Stratten was brutally 
raped and murdered by Snider after agreeing to meet him at his apartment. 
Snider then turned the shotgun on himself. 
</P>
<P>
It was Playboy's Hugh Hefner who relayed the horrific news to Bogdanovich. 
Later, in his 1984 book about Stratten, "The Killing of the Unicorn," 
Bogdanovich laid much of the blame for her death on the doorsteps of the 
Playboy mansion, where Hefner promoted a notoriously promiscuous life style. 
</P>
<P>
But didn't Bogdanovich himself meet Stratten in Hefner's mansion, flirting with 
her the same way other leering men did, the same ones he disparaged in his 
book? "I think if I had to do (the book) over I'd be a little harder on myself 
-- for not knowing more, for not realizing the consequences of my own actions, 
for not realizing that my presence in someone's house is an endorsement," 
Bogdanovich says. "And I'd be a little less hard on Hefner." 
</P>
<P>
Then his voice drops so that it's barely audible. "It was a tragedy that 
everything just went wrong. There were a lot of ways it could have been 
different. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
After the book's release, Hefner held a press conference to defend himself 
against Bogdanovich's charges. At the news conference, Hefner and Stratten's 
stepfather, Burl Eldridge, claimed that Bogdanovich "seduced" Louise B. 
Hoogstraten, Dorothy's younger sister, when she was 13 years old. The pair also 
claimed Bogdanovich paid for cosmetic jaw surgery on the girl so that she would 
look more like Dorothy. 
</P>
<P>
Louise responded with a $5-million lawsuit charging Hefner with slander, libel 
and invasion of privacy. The suit was later dropped. (This wasn't Bogdanovich's 
first run-in with Hefner. Shepherd sued Playboy after the magazine printed nude 
shots of her obtained from film outtakes on "Picture Show." The settlement 
resulted in Shepherd and Bogdanovich obtaining the film rights to the story 
"Saint Jack" from Hefner.) 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Bogdanovich raised more than a few eyebrows when he married 
the 20-year-old Louise, whom he calls L. B. The tabloids loved the story (not 
only is Louise Dorothy's sister, she's also about the same age as Bogdanovich's 
two daughters by Polly Platt). And People magazine ran a cover story in which 
L. B.'s mother distressingly asked: "If he is in love with one daughter, how 
can he be in love with the other daughter?" 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think (the marriage) would get so much attention," Bogdanovich says 
of the publicity. "Then I shrugged and thought, this comes with the territory. 
What's the point of saying the media is this or that? They're doing a job. It's 
a story. You can't accept the good part and then complain about the bad part. . 
. . People sometimes know about me for the wrong reasons, but it translates 
into interest in my films." The negative publicity, he adds, was much harder on 
his new wife. 
</P>
<P>
Bogdanovich cast L. B. in his 1988 film starring Rob Lowe, "Illegally Yours." A 
failed attempt to recapture the kind of humor early '70s audiences loved in 
"What's Up Doc?," the movie went straight to video shelves without much of a 
theatrical release. Bogdanovich says he'd rather forget the whole experience. 
</P>
<P>
His new wife also helps produce the film-history spots that Bogdanovich 
narrates for his weekly video feature for CBS Morning News. She was planning on 
assisting with the production of "Texasville" but she injured her knee and now 
spends most of her time in a mobile dressing room near the set. 
</P>
<P>
It's been said that Bogdanovich is attracted to young women whom he can mold. 
"The thing about Cybill or Dorothy or L. B. is that I feel inspired by their 
presence to be better than I am," says Bogdanovich. "And I'm interested in 
bringing out whatever talent they might have." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledges a strong attraction to youth. "I just think people get 
destroyed as they go through life, and those that aren't (destroyed) are just 
more fun to be with. I like younger people because they're open and they have 
more hope. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I just don't like to grow up." 
</P>
<P>
Bogdanovich is still recovering from the bankruptcy that his devotion to 
Stratten's memory brought on. Unhappy with the original marketing on "They All 
Laughed," the only film he made with her, Bogdanovich bought it from the old 
Time-Life Films division of Time Inc. and distributed it himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I was completely foolhardy, naive," he says now. "I'm not sorry I did it 
because I did it for love and dedication. But people would come to me and say 
'You're running out of money' and I'd just laugh. Money didn't matter to me 
then. It does now because I see what happens when you don't have any." When he 
declared bankruptcy, court documents listed his debts as $6.6 million, against 
assets of $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
To stay afloat now, says Bogdanovich, "I just have to keep making pictures." 
McMurtry's book "Texasville," published in 1987, came along at the right time 
for Bogdanovich. "I guess what decided it for me is that it's rare in one's 
career to be given the opportunity to go back in time and recapture something 
that's important in your career, and in your life. And to approach it from 
another angle, to find a new way of looking at the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
But deciding to make "Texasville" and pulling the production together were two 
different matters. The headaches involved in locating financing were just the 
beginning. At several points, the film nearly fell apart because of competing 
demands on the schedules of the principal actors. 
</P>
<P>
Bogdanovich may feel at times like he's running a shuttle service in and out of 
Archer City, but he finally managed to pull his cast together. Now it's up to 
him to prove he can recover some of the glitter his career lost in the years 
following "Picture Show." 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is jittery," Bogdanovich says as he drives the lonely road from 
Archer City to Wichita Falls at the end of a day. "It's a tough thing to do to 
put yourself up against something you did before that everyone liked. 
</P>
<P>
"You can only be discovered once."

<P>
What impact did "The Last Picture Show" have on the principals? A look at the 
nearly two decades in the careers of three of the stars who are returning in 
"Texasville." 
</P>
<P>
Cybill Shepherd 
</P>
<P>
After the release of "The Last Picture Show" in 1971, Shepherd followed with 
roles in "The Heartbreak Kid," "Taxi Driver," "At Long Last Love" and "Daisy 
Miller," among others. Her performances in the latter two films -- both 
directed by Bogdanovich -- drew ridicule from critics. After this rocky start 
in Hollywood, Shepherd moved back to her hometown of Memphis and did regional 
theater. In the 1980s, her career took off again when she returned to Hollywood 
and got cast with Bruce Willis in the flashfire TV hit "Moonlighting." "I was 
sad to see it over," Shepherd says of ABC's decision last spring to cancel the 
show, "but it's also a relief." 
</P>
<P>
Shepherd's personal connection to "Texasville" goes beyond her affair with 
Bogdanovich. After "Picture Show," she developed a close relationship with 
author Larry McMurtry: He even dedicated the book "Texasville" to her. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Shepherd says she was petrified about doing the famous diving 
board scene in "Picture Show" in which she strips in front of several guests at 
a pool party. "I was waiting for God to strike me dead," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Bridges 
</P>
<P>
"The Last Picture Show," says Bridges, "changed my life a hell of a lot. It 
really put me on the map as an actor." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Bridges has been all over that map, proving himself as both one of 
Hollywood's most reliable leading men and one of its boldest gamblers. "I seem 
to be attracted to anything that's risky or challenging," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges has played conventional strong leading men in such pictures as "Jagged 
Edge" and "Against All Odds," but he has also taken on such offbeat roles as 
the alien visitor in "Starman," for which he won a best-actor Oscar nomination, 
the luckless dreamer in "Nadine" and a quirky failed inventor in Francis Ford 
Coppola's "Tucker."

Many of Bridges' early films weren't box-office hits but are still considered 
favorites among film officiandos -- including "Thunderbolt and Lightfoot," "Fat 
City" and "Rancho Deluxe." In "Picture Show," Bridges played Duane, boyfriend 
to the beautiful and flirtatious Jacy (Shepherd). Thirty years later in 
"Texasville," Duane is married to the impetuous Karla, played by Annie Potts, 
star of TV's "Designing Women." But his flame for Jacy lives on. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Bottoms 
</P>
<P>
As Bridges' friend Sonny Crawford, Bottoms arguably was the star of "Picture 
Show." But his career nose-dived during the 1970s and never quite recovered. 
Compared to co-stars Shepherd and Bridges, Bottoms has a relatively small part 
in "Texasville" and is being paid only $175,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Picture Show" followed Bottoms' critically acclaimed performance in Dalton 
Trumbo's "Johnny Got His Gun." In 1973, he appeared in "The Paper Chase," but 
most of his films after that were not memorable ones. 
</P>
<P>
Now Bottoms spends most of his acting time in European productions. "It's not 
that I'm not interested (in Hollywood)," Bottoms says. "I'm just not offered 
the parts. It's all so political." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the actor lives on a cattle ranch in Santa Barbara with his 
family and is active on American Indian and environmental issues. "I'll never 
make the big money or be a giant star," he says, "but I'm having a great life."

CRITIC'S NOTES: THE ART OF POLITICS AND PASSION; 
</P>
<P>
'A DRY WHITE SEASON' IS OVERPOWERED BY A LITTLE FILM, 'MAPANTSULA,' IN 
DEPICTING THE PLIGHT OF SOUTH AFRICAN BLACKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Do we have to endorse mediocre art in the service of good politics? The 
question arises in the wake of four showings of "A Dry White Season" at a 
Johannesberg film festival two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
That the film would be profoundly disturbing to Johannesberg's white audiences 
is hardly surprising. Set in 1976, its action scenes begin with the incident 
that sparked the Soweto uprising: the government's attack with dogs and tear 
gas and bullets on black schoolchildren marching peaceably in a demonstration 
against their educational system. It became a massacre, and by the time the 
riots that erupted in its wake were over, there were more than 300 dead, a 
great many of them children. 
</P>
<P>
And that's the film's first quarter-hour. Unmistakably effective, "A Dry White 
Season" also includes graphic scenes of torture by the government's special 
forces. From published reports of torture in that country, these examples, 
agonizing as they are, are mild. No wonder white Johannesberg audiences are 
shocked. They are publicly confronting crimes done in their name. 
</P>
<P>
Of course it moves audiences -- everywhere. How can scenes of torture and of 
the death of children not? But "A Dry White Season" lets audiences congratulate 
themselves on feeling fury at the death of children -- it doesn't take the 
further step of forcing audiences to feel complicity in these deaths. And 
setting the film in the past begs the issue. A generation of black children 
have grown up since in Soweto under virtually the same conditions: They are 
still harassed, they are beaten, some have been murdered and their educational 
system still cripples them. 
</P>
<P>
You can't help but wonder what the effect of a superb film on apartheid would 
be. Because "A Dry White Season" is a tract, a dry rerun of "Cry Freedom," with 
none of that film's visual sweep (whatever else its faults) and with nothing 
new to tell us. It's filled with obvious, earnest performances -- Marlon 
Brando's ironic and subtle one is the only exception -- and unresonant writing. 
</P>
<P>
And, in an ending added by the director, it answers crimes of murder by the 
Nazi-like whites, personified by "Das Boot's" Jurgen Prochnow, with an act of 
murder by an improbable black man, played by Zakes Mokae, omnipotent, 
omnipresent and armed -- in 1976. In addition to improbability, decades of 
Gandhi-like practices by black South Africans are sacrificed in favor of one 
"satisfying" moment of revenge. You can't help wondering what Nobel Peace Prize 
winner Bishop Tutu or activist Anglican leader Beyers Naude would make of this 
image, the lingering last one of the film. 
</P>
<P>
There were reasons to have every hope for "A Dry White Season," one of only a 
handful of mass-audience features on apartheid in recent years. Even though 
it's the adaptation of a novel by a white South African, Andre Brink, and it 
takes us, yet again, through the white experience of apartheid, "A Dry White 
Season" comes from a black film maker, Euzhan Palcy. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, Palcy is from Martinique -- and Paris -- not South Africa. We could 
still hope she would inform her film with facets of life under apartheid that 
we'd never seen before. We could hope for the sort of complexity of characters, 
the personalization of moral dilemmas that were detailed in Chris Menges' 
superb "A World Apart." 
</P>
<P>
But "A Dry White Season's" screenplay by Palcy and Colin Welland has no 
insights into life on either side of the color line. It deals in characters who 
are either improbable, like Mokae's almost-magical taxi driver, Stanley, or who 
are already old friends on the movie screen: the highly placed Afrikaner who is 
completely ignorant of life around him. The black township family, scarred, 
saintly, cut down before us, one after another. (In "A Dry White Season" a 
black schoolboy is killed, his father is killed, his mother is killed . . . but 
when our newly awakened white man is killed, then attention is paid. The 
equation is insultingly out of kilter.) 
</P>
<P>
There is a film of comparison to "A Dry White Season," not mainstream and 
simplified and certainly without the draw of major stars, but one that drops us 
right down into life in the townships and trusts that we'll form our own 
conclusions about the vice-grip of racism. Called "Mapantsula" ("thief"), it 
was shot, guerrilla-style, in Soweto and Johannesberg by black first-time 
director Oliver Schmitz, who draws a portrait of day-to-day township life as we 
rarely get a chance to see it. 
</P>
<P>
Schmitz knows better than to make his contemporaries saintly sufferers; the 
tone of his raw, unsparing film is closest in feeling to the Jimmy Cliff 
Jamaican classic, "The Harder They Come." His characters are a rich mixture: 
hard-working young women who spend their days as housekeepers in upscale white 
kitchens; older residents who've somehow learned to survive despite their daily 
indignities, and petty crooks like the film's central character, who likes to 
call himself Panic. "Mapantsula," isn't perfect; it has its share of simplistic 
characterizations, but as a lesson in the details of black South African life, 
"A Dry White Season" can't touch it. 
</P>
<P>
Cynical, streetwise and as apolitical as they come, Panic is caught in a 
routine police sweep of blacks on Johannesberg's streets after curfew and 
tossed in a tank with a group of political activists. One by one, each greets 
the others: "Forward!" "Power to the people!" "Comrades!" Shoved in their 
midst, Panic greets then with a hip, "Hi gents, how is it?" 
</P>
<P>
Sensing a weak link, the police try to force Panic to spy for them, as his 
fellow prisoners begin a hunger strike, and in a flashback Panic reviews his 
raffish, checkered life. Panic is an unfashionable black hero -- he's ignoble, 
crummy and there's no one, buddy or lover, he hasn't yet let down in his life. 
But when he makes the moral choice he does at the film's end, terrified and 
sweating, and in quite literal fear of his life, it's more moving than all the 
halo shots of Steve Biko in the world. It becomes a moment impossible to shake 
off. There's a quality of reality to it that well-intentioned films will have 
to co-opt if they're going to make their important messages anything more than 
political night letters. 
</P>
<P>
"Mapantsula," which has no distributor, has begun to make the rounds of film 
festivals, including this year's AFIFest, as well as Toronto's recent Festival 
of Festivals. It will have a one-night screening, Tuesday at USC as part of 
their "Signs of Hope" series, Room 101, Taper Hall of Humanities, 7 p.m. For

South Africa -- In Sheila Benson's Oct. 15 commentary, the director of 
"Mapantsula" was identified as a black South African. Oliver Schmitz is a white 
South African who collaborated on the screenplay with Thomas Mogotlane, the 
black South African who starred in the film. The two used a mixed crew to shoot 
the movie in the black township of Soweto and in Johannesburg.

SKEPTICS AND BOOSTERS AWAIT SAN DIEGO'S SOVIET ARTS FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERARD GARZA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They said it couldn't be done. Some said it shouldn't be done. But Saturday, 
San Diego opens "Treasures of the Soviet Union," a three-week arts festival 
that organizers hope will put the city on the cultural map. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Arts Festival is largely the brainchild of Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor, who dreamed up the event while in Scotland for the 1987 Edinburgh 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Though organized by a nonprofit corporation, the festival is clearly a 
city-sponsored event. The officers of the corporation are O'Connor, the city 
manager, the city attorney and the city auditor. City tax dollars provided 
almost one-half of the $6.25-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
The festival is designed to be a triennial event and the 1992 fest will likely 
be tied to the quincentennial celebration of the discovery of the New World. 
The mayor plans to step down as president after this year's festival, saying 
she will leave future festival planning "to the professionals." 
</P>
<P>
Therein lies the rub for many of the festival's detractors. O'Connor has 
personally made many of the artistic choices, traveling to the Soviet Union in 
June of 1988 and continuing to have a major hand in all aspects of the 
festival's planning, even after artistic coordinator Bruce Joseph was hired in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
One of the early criticisms of the festival was that it would be "thrown 
together" because of the short lead time. The 1987 Los Angeles Festival had 
three years planning. The 1990 Goodwill Games Arts Festival in Seattle, which 
also will feature a Soviet theme, is working on four years planning. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego festival had 18 months of planning, not much longer than the lead 
time for another Soviet-American collaboration -- the 1988 Making Music 
Together Festival in Boston, which had some artistic success, but was a 
logistics nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
One telling result of the short lead time was the absence on the program of any 
Russian ballet, arguably the Soviet Union's greatest cultural export. All the 
major companies had already booked tours that didn't coincide with the San 
Diego festival dates. 
</P>
<P>
Also providing fodder for skeptics was the mayor's boosterish attitude toward 
the festival. "For once, San Diego has won!" she exclaimed upon her return from 
the Soviet Union, adding the city had beaten "Seattle, the Smithsonian and New 
York." 
</P>
<P>
But except for an unsuccessful attempt to keep independent promoters from 
presenting events not sanctioned by the festival, the mayor has had her way. 
</P>
<P>
Artistically, the festival has a little bit of everything: glitz (Faberge 
eggs); old art (religious icons and folk art); new art (contemporary 
photography and the world premiere of a play); heavy (a Mussorgsky opera and an 
epic stage production about dreary rural life after World War II), and light 
(marionettes and folk dance). There will be a huge, free, daylong celebration 
-- titled "Super Powers Sunday" -- at Balboa Park on Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as there is "official" and "unofficial" art in the Soviet Union, there 
are similar designations for festival events. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor did her best to prevent two independent promoters from presenting 
Soviet acts that weren't part of the festival. She invoked a verbal agreement 
with the Soviet Ministry of Culture that supposedly gave festival organizers 
authority to approve all Soviet acts in the city during the festival. 
</P>
<P>
Her efforts ultimately failed, but she did provide this classic piece of irony: 
The San Diego Soviet Arts Festival, made possible in part by the new Russian 
openness, was accused of using the heavy-handed tactics once associated with 
the old Soviet system. Thus, in the spirit of perestroika, there are some 
"unofficial" or "Fringe" events. For information on the festival schedule, call 
(800) 245-FEST.

NO STARS, NO PIZAZZ, NO PRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES SOCIETY WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a Los Angeles party planner's nightmare: Mickey Rourke, Rob Lowe, 
Patrick Swayze and other celebrities were confirmed to attend an exhibition for 
celebrity portrait photographer Harry Langdon at a tony Beverly Hills 
restaurant. Although 1,500 people turned out, few celebs showed: former 
"Gilligan's Island" castaway Tina Louise, one-time Prince protegee Apollonia 
and actress Michelle Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
The press wasn't happy that the expected A-listers didn't show; the publicists 
had to soothe the ticked-off press; and the party didn't generate as much 
coverage as was hoped. 
</P>
<P>
"You're just so on edge about people showing up," says Kathleen Rogers of the 
Venema Group, a publicist who has worked on other events with better turnouts. 
She says she was brought in two weeks before this event and had nothing to do 
with the guest list. "It's never guaranteed, and you don't know until the time 
comes who will show up. Hollywood has always been a town where who's who always 
counts. People want to be seen at parties where there are big names." 
</P>
<P>
It's an undisputed fact of the crowded, competitive L.A. party scene that 
celebrities are a necessity for an event to pull in major media coverage and, 
if it's a fund-raiser, sell tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"The celebrity factor has always been the case," says publicist Josh Baran of 
Josh Baran &amp; Associates, whose firm has worked on projects for groups such 
as Heal the Bay, the Rainforest Foundation and nonprofit radio station KUSC. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much competition for charity dollars, and so many events, that 
often the edge is the element of fame. Who are they going to see? It pulls 
whether we like it or not. I wish the issue would pull people. I once had the 
most ludicrous situation -- I was working on a march for the homeless, and the 
media wanted to know what celebs could I deliver. We got some coverage, but if 
I had had Martin Sheen or Bette Midler I would have gotten five times the 
coverage." 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Fischer, a Josh Baran alum who recently formed her own firm, the Fischer 
Group, agrees. "There are the benefit wars, and sometimes you'll have a case 
where there will be three major events the same evening, and you'll call 
'Entertainment Tonight' and they'll say (whether they cover it) depends on who 
the celebrities are. Or someone will say, 'That's great, I believe in the 
cause, but I can't send you anyone because my crew is out covering the Bob Hope 
Classic. . . .' It's shallow, but it's Hollywood, it's glitz and glitter." 
</P>
<P>
The public's insatiable appetite for new stars keeps the A-list changing fast 
enough to give diligent celeb-watchers whiplash. Grown-up brat packers Judd 
Nelson, Robert Downey Jr. and Emilio Estevez were once superhot draws, but now 
their status has cooled. 
</P>
<P>
Current flavors of the month include Madonna (better if she's with any current 
flame, best if she's with the flame and comedian Sandra Bernhard), Roseanne 
Barr, Cher and Sting. Elusive celebs like Robert De Niro, Katherine Hepburn, 
Jack Nicholson, Prince, Barbra Streisand, Meryl Streep and Michael Jackson are 
always in demand, as is perennial favorite Elizabeth Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
And look what a stint in court has done for Zsa Zsa Gabor: The media used to 
yawn when her name was on a guest list; now they can't wait to photograph her. 
</P>
<P>
Any combination of those celebrities could pique the interest of "Entertainment 
Tonight's" supervising producer Barry Berk, the show's former field producer 
and veteran of many Hollywood parties. 
</P>
<P>
"We base covering a party on a couple of factors," he says. "We look at the 
guest list, see what kind of star power it has. A lot of times it's the cause, 
something we feel we want to cover because of the charity or the uniqueness of 
the event. . . . Not everybody has to be an A-player for us to show up at a 
party. Viewers like to see how people are dressed, what they're eating, what 
kind of venues they go to." 
</P>
<P>
The more elusive a star is, the bigger the draw and the harder it is to get him 
or her to show up. As Fischer puts it, "You want to get ones that don't go out 
for the opening of every door." 
</P>
<P>
Celebrities can become mere commodities when there is something to sell and 
events become a business proposition: How much exposure will the star get, and 
what caliber of celebrity can a magazine put in its party pages? 
</P>
<P>
And what if the stars know next to nothing about the group they're supporting? 
A few minutes of coaching before the press conference will do the trick. They 
get the exposure and the group gets coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some celebrities who really care and want to contribute, and there 
are some who just show up for the photo opportunity," Fischer says. "I think 
the press knows who they are." 
</P>
<P>
Do reporters care if a rock musician out stumping to preserve the ozone layer 
doesn't even know what an ozone layer is? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they really care," says Fischer, "because they're really looking 
for the sound bite." 
</P>
<P>
Want to entice a star to show? Pay them. Some organizations reportedly do; 
almost none will admit it. Most stars are "comped" tickets to an event (so is 
the press), some are delivered to the party in limos. 
</P>
<P>
There are truly dedicated celebrities who do more than show up for photo 
opportunities and hors d'oeuvres. Sting holds concerts and press conferences to 
save the rain forests. Meryl Streep testifies in Washington against pesticides 
and Ted Danson campaigns to clean up the ocean. It's easy for them to pull in 
other star friends for more support. 
</P>
<P>
"In general, celebrities are very important to us," says Harlene Marshall, 
former president and now second vice president of L.A. chapter of Mothers 
Against Drunk Drivers. "On a superficial level it creates an excitement about 
the event, but more important, celebrities serve as role models. They give 
credence to things. In our case, very often the celebrities who commit to us 
are sincerely concerned and committed about drunk driving, and in a lot of 
cases they've either been victims themselves or know people who have been." 
</P>
<P>
For an organization like the local chapter of the Society for the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Animals, currently pushing for a higher profile in the community and 
taking strong stands on animal rights issues, supportive, dedicated celebrities 
can be an asset. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Renee Sheranian, the group's vice president for development, stars are 
"sort of the frosting on the cake. The real leadership comes from the corporate 
and community leaders and philanthropists. The celebrities draw the crowds, but 
quite often they lend more their time and talent than money. Still, that's 
valuable." 
</P>
<P>
Actress Betty White has been a longtime supporter of the SPCA; more recent 
converts include Cassandra Peterson (better known as "Elvira"), actor Robert 
Wagner and artist David Hockney. 
</P>
<P>
There are times when party planners would gladly settle for five B-list 
celebrities who do appear rather than a confirmed A-list star who decides to 
skip the event at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
It happens all the time, and those who have been on the party circuit even a 
short time knows that a "confirmed" guest list is meaningless. Unless a star is 
being honored, there is no guarantee he'll show up at all. 
</P>
<P>
Even celebrities slated to host an event aren't required to show. And a 
star-studded dinner or honorary committee list on an invitation is an 
indication the stars lent their names to an organization, not that they're 
going to appear at the party. 
</P>
<P>
"We do the best we can with that," says Josh Baran. "We hear from their 
publicists, and then we put out a list of people expected to attend. Sometimes 
we have 100% attendance, sometimes 0%. Sometimes people say 'yes' because they 
were asked by the right person, and then they get tired and don't show up. 
</P>
<P>
"We take it with a grain of salt," he adds. "I did an event for Meryl Streep 
when she was (protesting pesticides). It was a small brunch at a private home, 
and every single celebrity that RSVP'd showed up. Some people came to support 
Meryl, but it was an issue they deeply cared about." 
</P>
<P>
Publicists call other publicists or agents to persuade their clients to attend 
an event, using whatever contacts they have. The larger public relations firms 
often stock parties with their own clients. 
</P>
<P>
Says Fischer: "From the celebrity's point of view, (being associated with a 
charity group) can build an image in the public's eye." 
</P>
<P>
Showing up too often, however, can backfire, leaving jaded reporters snickering 
about the starlet who shows up to the opening of a filing cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
It happened to actress Whoopi Goldberg, who was roundly criticized for stepping 
out too frequently when she was Hollywood's Hot New Thing. 
</P>
<P>
Years later she still smarts from the remarks. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to like to go to a lot of stuff, but I got hassled for it. People made 
nasty comments about me going to everything. You don't want to read that kind 
of stuff about yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"These were dreams for me," she explains, "to be able to go to parties and look 
at stuff like that. Who knows how long Whoopi is going to last? I wanted to 
look at it all, and I was honored to be invited. If you can do something for 
somebody as well as have a good time, I challenge anyone who has an interest in 
Hollywood not to go." 
</P>
<P>
She's since cut down on parties, but still receives some 100 invitations a week 
from charity groups alone. Unfamiliar organizations are checked out by her 
staff, and Goldberg says she tries not to be comped when asked to show up. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years she's aligned herself with organizations like Comic Relief, the 
Starlight Foundation and the AIDS Project Los Angeles. "I lend my name to a lot 
or organizations to save the whales, save the world, leave the gorillas alone, 
let's make sure the rain forest is OK; these are things I'm concerned with." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg sees firsthand what showing up does for an organization. "One of the 
most clear responses has been to Comic Relief (the yearly comedy concert to 
raise money for the nation's homeless). People come up to me and say, 'Whoopi, 
you and Robin (Williams) and Billy (Crystal), we send checks in for you guys.' 
</P>
<P>
"Also, I have this thing," she says, "that I'm going to wake up and people are 
going to say, 'Whoopi who?' This is a very strange business, and I want to make 
sure that in case someone takes my home away, I have a shelter."

<TEXT>
<P>
Oliver Sacks is both exhausted and exhilarated. His body advises him to sit, 
enjoy a cup of coffee or an apple, and relax. But his mind will not listen. 
</P>
<P>
Sacks has arrived at the California School for the Deaf, widely praised for its 
progressive teaching philosophy, and despite a tiring cross-country flight and 
a restless night's sleep, the veteran researcher's unquenchable curiosity 
insists on a lightning tour. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, Sacks -- neurologist, professor and best-selling author -- may 
not have crossed the street to visit a school for the deaf, much less driven 
himself to exhaustion. That changed when he wrote "Seeing Voices." 
</P>
<P>
"Voices," subtitled "A Journey Into the World of the Deaf" (University of 
California Press), is Sacks' fifth book, and his first since the best-selling 
"The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat" in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
It is also Sacks' first book based on neither his own personal or clinical 
experience (he is a professor of neurology at the Albert Einstein College of 
Medicine in New York), but on the insights, research and experiences of others. 
In it, he has explored what it means to be deaf -- and, by extension, what it 
means to be without language, the software of human thought. 
</P>
<P>
Readers share Sacks' interest. A first printing of 50,000 copies was sold in 
two weeks, making "Voices" the best-selling general-interest book in University 
of California Press history, said spokeswoman Denise Cicourel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our big book of the year -- maybe our big book of the century," said 
Stanley Holwitz of UC Press' Los Angeles office. Holwitz, a friend of Sacks, 
brought Sacks back to the academic publishing house -- where general-interest 
titles normally sell from 5,000 to 25,000 copies -- after working with him on a 
revised edition of Sacks' 1970 book, "Migraine." 
</P>
<P>
Holwitz saw the seed of a book in two essays Sacks wrote for the New York 
Review of Books on deaf history and the campus revolt last year when students 
demanded more deaf administrators at Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C., 
the world's only four-year liberal arts college for the deaf. 
</P>
<P>
"Oliver has a compulsion about writing; if you want an essay of 2,000 words, he 
will deliver 12,000," Holwitz said, "so I knew he was ready to write more." 
</P>
<P>
Sacks was interested in writing more, and writing for Holwitz at UC Press. But 
first there was the small matter of his contract with Summit Books, which had 
published "Hat." Summit did eventually release Sacks from that contract, but 
Holwitz said he believes Sacks will return to Summit following the "Voices" 
publicity tour. 
</P>
<P>
During a quick visit to the San Francisco Bay Area last week, Sacks sought out 
members of the region's active deaf community, centered in Fremont and 
Berkeley, and engaged them in discussions over the best way to teach deaf 
people -- and the best way to learn from them. 
</P>
<P>
"Deaf people may find themselves more linguistically sophisticated than hearing 
people," he said. "I have spoken since I was an infant, for example, but I 
never really thought about language until I started writing this book. Deaf 
people think about sign language in a way we never think about English." 
</P>
<P>
That is, in part, he says, because deafness gives the deaf a taste of the 
somewhat unimaginable handicap and isolation of being unable to communicate in 
any way with others -- or, in a real sense, with oneself, since some form of 
language is essential to higher forms of internal thought. 
</P>
<P>
But there is even more to it than that. As Sacks says, deaf people may think in 
an entirely new -- and, in some ways, better -- fashion than the hearing. Sacks 
calls it "a new form of visual intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling -- and it is only a hunch -- is that there are some things that 
lend themselves more to signing and some things that lend themselves more to 
English," he told an auditorium full of deaf students and their teachers in 
Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting this thesis are research experiments and practical experiences in 
which hearing, English-speaking people also learn and use American Sign 
Language (or, as Sacks prefers, simply Sign). Each of those languages has its 
own distinct attributes, he writes, and bilingual people often jump back and 
forth between them, shopping for the language best suited for the idea being 
expressed. 
</P>
<P>
For example, English, being more abstract and linear, is more effective at 
metaphor and intellectual inquiry, while Sign, being more iconic and spatial, 
is better at conveying context and emotion. 
</P>
<P>
In his travels among deaf communities from Martha's Vineyard off Massachusetts 
to Fremont, Sacks confirmed this himself in bilingual people. He found some, 
for example, who chatted in English but joked in Sign. Others, he noted with 
amazement, sat placidly in easy chairs and on porch swings, their hands 
twitching slightly in their laps. They were daydreaming in Sign. 
</P>
<P>
"With Sign, there is a special playfulness in narrative and thought," said 
Sacks, whose own halting training in sign language has been interrupted while 
he promotes the book. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a terrible paradox here. There is no one worse at languages than I 
am," he said. "My father was very gregarious and outgoing while my mother was 
great at learning vocabulary and rules but never able to speak a word. I'm 
afraid I rather take after her." 
</P>
<P>
On his most recent return to the Bay Area -- the London native interned at a 
San Francisco hospital in the early 1960s -- Sacks was eager to zip down to the 
California School for the Deaf. His book praises the small, residential school 
for advocating early and complete education of deaf children, embracing Sign, 
and encouraging its students to pursue their interests as vigorously as do 
their hearing peers. 
</P>
<P>
He also has high praise for Fremont itself, a Silicon Valley suburb with an 
unusual degree of integration among its deaf and hearing residents. Here, many 
deaf people are an integral part of the local arts community and government, 
and many hearing people are learning Sign to expand their social and financial 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some deaf people who say, with a smile, that they can no longer tell 
secrets in restaurants," because so many hearing people in town have learned 
Sign, said school administrator Diane Morton. 
</P>
<P>
Treating deaf people as people might not seem unusual. But, as Sacks details in 
"Seeing Voices," it is. 
</P>
<P>
His book is actually a series of three essays, the longest of which is the 
summation of research into the fundamental importance of language to mental 
development -- an importance illustrated by several clinical tales of deaf 
children denied all language skills until they are of school age. 
</P>
<P>
This phenomenon usually results in permanently impaired language skills, he 
writes, and is a big reason why so many otherwise capable and intelligent deaf 
people read and write at no more than a fourth-grade level. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest calamity for deaf people is to be denied access to language when 
they most need it, before the age of 4 or 5," he told Fremont students, many of 
whom brought copies of Sacks' book for his signature. 
</P>
<P>
"The denial may not be intentional. It may be just the result of exposure to a 
language not easily understood" by a deaf child -- that is, English or a 
tedious derivative called Signed English. 
</P>
<P>
Denying language, and thus education, to a child may seem barbaric, but Sacks 
asserts it actually was -- and, in too many cases, still is -- quite common. 
</P>
<P>
Such abuse is chronicled in the book's first essay, a brief but impassioned 
history of deaf people in Western society. In it, Sacks recalls how for 
centuries deaf men and women, who as children were improperly denied an 
education, endured unthinkable discrimination. Among other injustices, the deaf 
were forbidden to own property or inherit it; they were denied work and 
prevented from marrying. 
</P>
<P>
Enlightenment for the deaf flickered first in Paris in the 18th Century, Sacks 
recounts. There, priests first challenged a popular assumption that the deaf 
were incapable of learning, then recognized the genius of the informal sign 
language of the streets and standardized it for teaching to others. 
</P>
<P>
Laurent Clerc, a deaf French teacher, brought sign language to America in 1816 
at the request of the Rev. Thomas Gallaudet, a Connecticut minister who was 
determined to nurture the intelligence he recognized in a neighbor's deaf 
daughter. Together, they founded the American Asylum for the Deaf in Hartford 
and used informal native signs to develop what is now American Sign Language. 
Gallaudet University, the world's only four-year liberal arts college for the 
deaf, is named after that visionary New England cleric. 
</P>
<P>
Education of the deaf -- the key to a full and decent life, and for Sacks a 
goal tied closely to the use of Sign -- flowered and died as a social priority 
on several occasions in the intervening decades. With each historical retreat 
from that "visual language" of the deaf, Sacks writes sadly of "egregious" and 
"notorious" reformers who -- wrongheadedly, he argues -- sought to straitjacket 
the deaf with what was for them an unwieldy language, English. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his evident passion for early education, preferably in Sign, Sacks 
holds himself out as an arbitrator, not an advocate of any education theories. 
"The purpose of my book is to urge reflection," he said. "I am not a pusher of 
ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, on the way to Fremont, he recalled a confrontation the night before 
with "angry and anguished" parents of deaf children at a Berkeley bookstore. 
The parents, he said, were opposed to Sign because they felt it would exclude 
their children from intercourse with hearing people. 
</P>
<P>
"They were saying, 'Why are you trying to kidnap our children into the world of 
the deaf?' " he said, looking pained at the thought of having upset so many 
people. "The answer is, 'No, no, no, no, no.' I could not make them see the 
critical importance of giving children language -- any language -- early in 
their lives, to let them learn." 
</P>
<P>
Sacks explains that his affinity for Sign is based on the ability of deaf 
students to learn that language in a matter of months, compared to the 10 or 15 
years of difficult and tedious training needed for a congenitally deaf person 
to learn to speak English. 
</P>
<P>
"Language development is a critical part of human development," he said. 
"Acquiring language is a central part of being human, and a central part of 
neurological development." 
</P>
<P>
Even though deaf people themselves greet Sacks warmly -- students at Fremont 
collected around him to discuss his work and seek his opinions -- the previous 
night's confrontation with the hearing parents of deaf children still weighed 
heavily on him. He said he did not sleep well, and finally telephoned his 
friend, Gallaudet linguistics professor Robert Johnson, seeking counsel on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
Sacks clearly prefers consensus to confrontation. Along with a shoehorn, for 
example, he carries in his briefcase a room thermometer, which he said he uses 
to cut short any disagreements over whether the temperature in any particular 
room is too warm for comfort. 
</P>
<P>
"I have this idealistic view that if I could only get people to listen to one 
another, they would not be at each other's throats," he said, then added with a 
smile: "Of course, maybe if they really did (listen), they would be at each 
other's throats more often." 
</P>
<P>
Despite this disdain for disputes, Sacks carries a rainbow of colored pens, 
with which he frequently jots observations and ideas in a worn green notebook. 
Different colored pens, he explained, let him argue with himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Voices" is filled with such personal debate. Several of the book's 98 
footnotes contradict the main text. At one point, for example, he writes that 
deaf people "live in a world of utter, unbroken soundlessness and silence." His 
own footnote snipes: "This is the stereotypical view, and is not altogether 
true. The congenitally deaf do not experience or complain of 'silence' (any 
more than the blind experience or complain of 'darkness')." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to present all sides," he said. Besides, he added, "I think in 
footnotes and asides and tangents. Why shouldn't I write that way?" 
</P>
<P>
No reason at all. In fact, it fits perfectly with the impression one gets of 
Sacks as a brilliant and charming but rumpled and somewhat absent-minded 
academic. He could easily be cast as everyone's favorite professor, one whose 
lectures are scribbled on paper scraps bulging out of every pocket, one who 
somehow makes even the most arcane topics not only accessible but fun.

PITTSBURGH STILL ADORES CATHEDRAL OF LEARNING

<P>
When John Bowman first arrived in this city in 1921, the 10th University of 
Pittsburgh chancellor had trouble finding someone who knew the location of the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
So a few years later, Bowman built the tallest school building in America to 
make sure everyone in Pittsburgh would know exactly where the university was. 
</P>
<P>
It took 12 years -- from 1926 to 1938 and $10 million -- to construct the 
university's 42-story Cathedral of Learning, the largest Gothic structure and 
only college skyscraper in the United States. But Chancellor Bowman cleverly 
anchored the towering Cathedral with classrooms honoring and preserving the 
ethnic identities of the people of Pittsburgh. His concept for the Nationality 
Rooms was to enrich the Cathedral of Learning with treasures of Old World 
heritages. 
</P>
<P>
Ethnic groups in the city form committees to design classrooms reflecting their 
heritage. They raise funds to construct and fill them with objects of art. 
</P>
<P>
When the Cathedral of Learning was dedicated 51 years ago, there were five 
Nationality Rooms -- Scottish, Swedish, German, Russian and Early American. 
Today there are 21 with two more under construction and nearing completion. 
</P>
<P>
Each room has students' chairs and a professor's podium of the era depicted. 
Even the chalk boards are artistically compatible with the room. Regular 
university classes are conducted in the Nationality Rooms throughout the day 
and evening. Visitors from throughout the United States and many parts of the 
world are led on guided tours of the Nationality Rooms by members of Quo Vadis, 
a student volunteer group. Lectures and special events of the different ethnic 
groups are also held in the Nationality Rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Architecturally, the rooms range from classical 5th century B.C. Greece to 
Byzantine, Romanesque, Renaissance, Tudor, French Empire and folk. All styles 
predate 1787, the year the University of Pittsburgh was founded. 
</P>
<P>
Entering a Nationality Room is like stepping into a time machine. 
</P>
<P>
The Greek Room is Athens at the time of Pericles, the Polish Room a 
16th-Century castle, the Irish Room a 6th-Century oratory. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Room is the Palace Hall in the Forbidden City; the Italian Room 
recreates the serenity of a 15th-Century Tuscan monastery, and the German Room 
is 16th-Century Renaissance with details inspired by the auditorium of the 
University of Heidelberg, founded in 1386. 
</P>
<P>
Rooms are decorated with tapestries, paintings, frescoes, sculptures, 
stained-glass windows, hand-carved beams, and parquet floors typical of the 
nationalities they represent. 
</P>
<P>
The largest is the English Nationality Room filled with original material 
salvaged from the 16th-Century Tudor-Gothic House of Commons destroyed by bombs 
in World War II. The Syria-Lebanon Room was a 1782 library in a Damascus home 
that was dismantled, shipped here and reassembled. 
</P>
<P>
There are also French, Yugoslav, Norwegian, Chinese, Czechoslovak, Italian, 
Hungarian, Polish, Lithuania and Romanian Nationality Rooms, each 
architecturally distinct and representing highly created periods of the various 
cultures. 
</P>
<P>
The Nationality Rooms are cultural and aesthetic, not political. No political 
symbol is permitted, nor is any likeness of a living person. 
</P>
<P>
The two Nationality Rooms currently under construction are the African Heritage 
Room and the Ukrainian Room. The African Room will depict a courtyard typical 
in an Ashanti village of Ghana in the late 1700s. The Ukrainian Room will 
feature "Ukrainian Baroque" architecture that flourished during the 17th and 
18th centuries. The rooms cost $300,000 each, contributed by the two ethnic 
groups as a gift to the university. 
</P>
<P>
Last year saw the opening of the Armenian Room, a replica of the 10th-Century 
Armenian library at Sanahin Monastery. Engraved on a stone heritage wall in the 
room, that was designed by Los Angeles architect Torkom Khrimian, are names of 
historically important Armenians, including composer Aram Khatchaturyan of 
"Saber Dance" fame and Fresno, Calif., author William Saroyan. 
</P>
<P>
The Israel Heritage Room was dedicated two years ago. It is a replica of a 
1st-Century dwelling. Reproductions of three 3rd-Century paintings cover chalk 
board doors. The paintings are of Ezra the Scribe, Moses striking a rock for 
water and the consecration of a temple by Aaron and his sons. 
</P>
<P>
There are three other nationality groups in Pittsburgh planning and raising 
money for Nationality Rooms in the Cathedral of Learning -- Finns, Danes and 
Austrians. 
</P>
<P>
"It was Chancellor Bowman's idea to erect an educational skyscraper visible 
from every hillside in Pittsburgh to inspire all the immigrant groups to go for 
higher education," explained Maxine Bruhns, director of the Cathedral of 
Learning's Nationality Rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"Some 17,000 men and women and 97,000 school children made individual 
contributions to a fund drive for the tower in the 1920s. Today, many older 
residents of the city cherish certificates they received as a child for 
donating 10 cents, which they earned themselves, to buy a brick for the 
Cathedral of Learning," Bruhns added. 
</P>
<P>
"If Bowman just had the millionaires behind him, he never would have pulled it 
off," she said. "There will probably will never be another university building 
like this again. It would not be economically feasible. It was the time of the 
Great Depression, yet somehow Bowman did it."

MAKING HOW-TO MANUALS 'USER-FRIENDLY'

A senior executive at Ford Motor Co. wanted to reset the clock in his Ford car. 
Unable to figure out how to do it by himself, he reached for the owner's manual 
in the glove compartment. 
</P>
<P>
He found he couldn't understand the manual. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't alone. Growing numbers of psychologists and linguists spend their 
days thinking about the incomprehensible instructions and unmanageable manuals 
that accompany the technological revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The Document Design Center of the American Institutes for Research in 
Washington is a not-for-profit outfit that tries to help corporations and 
government agencies make their reading material readable. 
</P>
<P>
As it has with insurance claims, computer tutorials, phone bills, loan 
applications and instructions for chicken fryers, the Document Design Center 
recently tackled the owner's manual for the Ford Taurus. 
</P>
<P>
Using techniques similar to those of political polling, the document center 
formed several "focus groups" of about 10 people. They were handed the manuals 
and asked questions such as, "How do you put in oil?" or, "What does it mean 
when the brake light is on?" 
</P>
<P>
Some people seek their answers in the index, some go for the table of contents, 
"and some start in the middle of the book and just leaf through," said Carolyn 
Boccella Bagin, a senior communications specialist. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the focus group responses and problems, Bagin and co-workers rewrote 
the Taurus text to be more "user-friendly." 
</P>
<P>
They introduced personal pronouns and cut back on boldface type that shouted 
warnings. They packaged concepts into bite-sized "chunks" and created 
"breathing spots" to ponder the meaning of the blinking brake lights. They 
reworked the index and table of contents to list not only "instrument panel" 
but "dashboard." Then they tested the "before" and "after" manuals on a fresh 
supply of Taurus owners and found a rise in satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
On the whole, Bagin said, she worries that forms and instructions may be 
getting worse instead of better. Part of the problem may lie with the authors. 
They are often lawyers, engineers or marketers. Lawyers want to avoid lawsuits. 
Marketing people want to sell something. And engineers want to tell you how 
things work. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't need to know how your computer works. You just need to know in plain 
English how to put in the disc and turn the machine on," Bagin said.

THIEBAUD: CHANGER OF THE MUNDANE INTO THE SURREAL

You're moving your tray down the cafeteria line, reaching for the rolls, the 
salad, the hot dish. You swore you weren't going to eat dessert, but the stuff 
looks so luscious. That wobbly drift of delicately browned meringue over that 
slab of chocolate pie. . . . Well, damn the calories. 
</P>
<P>
Anybody with a sweet tooth knows that siren call. We carry pictures in our 
minds of these treats, and we expect that whatever we see in the restaurant 
will match our mental images. How could a slice of pie fail to be triangular? 
How could meringue not be white and slightly browned on top? 
</P>
<P>
When Northern California artist Wayne Thiebaud began painting pictures of 
restaurant desserts in the 1960s, he was struck by the way the food looked 
under the harsh, unnatural glare of fluorescent lights. He was intrigued by the 
traditional ways desserts are decorated to tempt the diner. And he liked to 
think about the differences between their real appearance and the way we 
picture them in our minds. 
</P>
<P>
Thiebaud's subjects also include other inanimate objects, as well as the San 
Francisco cityscape, landscapes and the human figure. All these bases are 
covered by a dandy show of more than 80 of his paintings on paper, drawings and 
prints from the past four decades, at the Fine Arts Gallery at UC Irvine 
through Nov. 4. The exhibit was organized by Nelson Gallery at UC Davis, where 
the 69-year-old artist has taught since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
That was the year when he hit upon his signature approach to objects -- an 
effect he once described as "somewhat like the feeling in an air-conditioned, 
well-lighted, quiet place where the slightest tremor can be sensed." 
</P>
<P>
Orderly rows of food on plates turn out to be studded with tiny discrepancies 
-- variations in the sizes of the cake wedges or the way the cherry garnishes 
are plunked on top. Even when Thiebaud zeroes in on a single dish, like a 
serving of pudding -- you find yourself noticing the slight ooze of cherry 
juice that disturbs the pillowy whiteness of whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
By isolating his stylized subjects against brightly lit, white backgrounds, 
Thiebaud could recreate them as clearly recognizable yet oddly surreal products 
of the mind's eye. Objects frequently have rims of bright yellow, red or green, 
mimicking the optical phenomenon known as "halation" -- the rainbowlike halo 
effect that occurs under bright lighting. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Thiebaud has used dark backgrounds as a backdrop in such works 
as "Dark Candy Apples," a watercolor (it also exists in an oil version). With 
</P>
<P>
nothing else to distract the eye, the viewer is struck by the glossy tactility 
of the deep-red glazed apples and by the rhythm of the different angles of the 
wood sticks. 
</P>
<P>
Other still-life subjects of his include glistening fish, a hunk of red-brown 
rib chops, a smoking cigar, a daffodil in a drinking glass, rows of wire-rimmed 
eyeglasses and a pair of polished shoes. 
</P>
<P>
The familiar subject matter and seductive style of Thiebaud's work make it so 
immediately lovable that it's easy to ignore or misunderstand its virtues as 
serious contemporary art. During the '60s, Thiebaud's food imagery was assumed 
to be part of the Pop Art movement, which cast a variably neutral or jaundiced 
eye on consumer products and mass media. 
</P>
<P>
In common with a number of pop artists such as Andy Warhol and James 
Rosenquist, Thiebaud worked in the commercial-art world before he came to 
concentrate on fine art. His clarity and economy of line may well owe something 
to the discipline he learned during his days as an illustrator, cartoonist and 
Rexall Drug Co. layout design man. (His interest in lighting, on the other 
hand, may date all the way back to his stage-crew work for his high school's 
theatrical productions.) 
</P>
<P>
But unlike the pop artists, Thiebaud didn't choose to stress the 
consumer-oriented aspect of this food. Instead, he followed in the footsteps of 
generations of artists who had a particular fascination with small, familiar 
objects. 
</P>
<P>
Having worked in restaurants as a youth, Thiebaud remembered (as he once told 
an interviewer) how rows of pies or "a tin of pie with a piece cut out of it 
and one piece sitting beside it . . . were always poetic to me." 
</P>
<P>
He zeroed in on the formal qualities of this humble food in a particularly 
contemporary way, with an ultra-cool, detached approach that stressed minute 
variations within multiple images of the same object and simple geometric 
forms. 
</P>
<P>
Thiebaud's landscape and city images are the product of the same values. 
Although the country scenes are rooted in the Sacramento Valley countryside 
Thiebaud knew well, their rhythms, shapes and colors exist only in the artist's 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
In a pastel drawing, "Cow Ridge (Three Cows)," three cows separated by equal 
distances make their way down a hill that is as severely slanted as the side of 
a triangle. The sky is green, the hill is blue, and the shadow patterns of the 
animals create a simple three-note harmony. The cows look alike -- except for 
the different shapes of their tails. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, after establishing a second home in San Francisco, Thiebaud began 
translating the dizzying grades of San Francisco streets into puzzle-like 
stacks of colored shapes. Sometimes combining several perspectives in one view, 
he created wonderfully dense and rhythmic patterns that combine specific 
building details with vertical ribbons of road. Other works dwell on the shape 
of freeway curves, punctuated by slender light poles that droop like delicate 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
When his subject was the human figure, the artist must have found it 
particularly hard to strip away all the extraneous detail, to treat flesh and 
blood with the neutral, bright-light scrutiny of a piece of pie. Thiebaud has 
painted suave, immaculately stripped-down canvases of people -- including his 
own wife. But the figure drawings on view show him simply as a good draftsman, 
not the alchemist who can turn the stuff of daily life into simple, startling 
objects that compel attention. 
</P>
<P>
Works in the exhibit from the late '40s and '50s reveal the eclectic activity 
of Thiebaud's early days, when he was restlessly pursuing artistic leads from a 
range of different sources. This sampling includes a careful, Cubist-derived 
landscape ("Rocks and Sea"), an academic portrait ("Woman with Fan") and a 
landscape with skittering, Expressionistic dashes of ink flying over the white 
paper ("Figures in the Snow/New York City"). 
</P>
<P>
Other artistic influences he has acknowledged include the ornate, 
presentational style of Byzantine art, the creamy brushwork of the 19th-Century 
Italian Macchiaioli painters and the figurative painting of his Bay Area 
colleagues, particularly Richard Diebenkorn. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he figured out how to combine aspects he admired in these works 
with his own distinctive take on the world around him. Watching this process 
unfold in the first batch of drawings and watercolors -- watching him single 
out the slant of a hill or the tilted display box in a grocer's window -- is 
one of the quiet joys of this exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
As a longtime teacher, used to having to explain himself, Thiebaud has made 
many pithy observations about his work. Drawing, he once said, is a way "to 
test what one can know about the look of such things as grace, sensuality, 
affectation, tension, repose, ineffableness, and those many mysterious 
characteristics which remain between a question and an answer."

DRIVER BADLY HURT, 6 OTHERS INJURED IN STREET RACE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A driver who reportedly tried to beat a yellow light on Katella Avenue between 
the cities of Stanton and Anaheim while racing another car was seriously 
injured, and six other people received minor to moderate injuries in a two-car 
collision Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol officials said the driver of the car that ran the 
light, Cecil G. Wilson, 59, of Anaheim, was taken to UCI Medical Center in 
Orange, where he was listed in serious condition. Although an investigation is 
pending, CHP officials released a statement that Wilson had been drinking 
before the incident. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officials said Wilson had been racing against a red Porsche eastbound on 
Katella Avenue just before he ran the yellow light at the Magnolia Avenue 
intersection, which is in an unincorporated area. His vehicle struck a car 
pulling out of a driveway about 200 feet east of the intersection.

</P>
<P>
WELFARE: AN OVERHAUL OF THE COUNTY'S GENERAL RELIEF PROGRAM HAS CREATED A NEW 
CROP OF INEQUITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1980, when a bad economy and rising poverty forced the Republican candidates 
for Orange County supervisor to debate welfare, the issue turned into a contest 
over who was tougher on fraud and laziness. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton won the election. And following through on his 
campaign promise, he helped create what is still one of California's most 
extensive welfare-fraud units as well as a rigorous workfare program, in part, 
to drive home the message that "there is no free lunch." 
</P>
<P>
"In the political world, workfare is probably a good thing to be supportive 
of," Stanton said recently. "There is in this country a negative connotation 
attached to the welfare system, and workfare puts integrity into the system." 
</P>
<P>
The politics of welfare in Orange County assumes that everybody has bootstraps, 
if they want to use them. But almost 10 years after the 1980 campaign led to an 
overhaul of the county's General Relief program, many of its goals and 
assumptions appear confused and unmet. 
</P>
<P>
General Relief "is almost money down the drain," said Jean Forbath, director of 
Share Our Selves, a Costa Mesa-based advocacy group for the poor. "You can't 
stop, because it's putting the finger in the dike. But it's not solving the 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
The $8-million General Relief program -- completely funded by county taxpayers 
-- is supposed to provide most needy, childless adults with housing, food, 
clothing and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike its larger state-funded counterpart -- Aid to Families with Dependent 
Children -- the program's rules and benefits are largely set by Orange County's 
five county supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the workfare program here, much like those in other counties, 
requires that recipients who are healthy spend two days per week searching for 
a job and up to three days each week working for the county, mainly in 
maintenance or clerical jobs. 
</P>
<P>
It is a politically popular program because it presumes that there will be aid 
only for the diligent and deserving. The reality, however, is much different. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
* County officials estimate that up to 90% of the General Relief workfare 
clients are homeless, even though state law requires that they be provided a 
large enough benefit to pay for housing. Housing in Orange County is expensive 
-- more than $20 per night in the cheapest motel. The maximum General Relief 
payment in Orange County -- for housing, food and all other living expenses -- 
is about $11 per day. 
</P>
<P>
* More than half of the clients in the General Relief workfare program suffer 
from alcoholism, drug addiction or mental handicaps, county records show. 
Still, partly because there are not enough medical facilities to care for them, 
most are required to maintain a rigorous five-day-per-week schedule of work and 
job searches to receive their welfare payment. About two-thirds of all workfare 
clients are cut off from their aid because they fail to maintain the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
* Despite all of the county's safeguards for fraud and abuse, officials 
acknowledge that many times, the cash they give out for living expenses is used 
to finance drug or alcohol addictions. Some clients are so severely addicted 
that they are declared unemployable, allowing them to receive their aid payment 
without having to join the work program. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than helping the person overcome his problems, we're giving him what he 
needs to perpetuate it," Larry Leaman, director of the county's Social Services 
Agency, conceded. "There is a dilemma when you hand a substance-abusing client 
a cash grant." 
</P>
<P>
While most of the state's AFDC welfare clients are women and children, almost 
all of the county's General Relief recipients are men, mostly young. They are 
victims of poverty and, at the same time, of a popular perception that a young 
male should be self-sufficient and, if he is not, it is his own fault. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, county officials admit, is that the system does not account for 
the many single men trapped in poverty who are also suffering from addictions 
or paralyzing emotional problems such as hopelessness and loss of esteem. 
</P>
<P>
"Government can only do so much," said Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez. "It is 
willing to give a hand to those who want assistance, but we're not going to 
force-feed those who don't want to be helped." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Bagarry, director of the county's welfare office in Anaheim, said the 
county is "not very hospitable" to people on welfare. "Personally, I don't know 
how they make it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the politics of welfare, officials say, is that there is not a lot of 
public sympathy for poor single males and so there is not a strong incentive 
for the county to spend more money or provide more care. 
</P>
<P>
Partly because the General Relief program does not have a high political 
priority, it has not been monitored closely. The county has done little 
research to determine if the program's goals are being met since the system was 
overhauled in 1980 -- even though there is evidence of problems. 
</P>
<P>
One of the main goals of workfare was to move people off the welfare rolls by 
preparing them for a job. But the county has not done any analysis to see if 
that objective is being met, even though there is skepticism among experts. 
</P>
<P>
There are not even any figures on how much is needed to cover the cost of 
shelter for the night, county officials say. While they maintain it is possible 
to find housing at General Relief rates of about $8 a night, Leaman admitted 
that actually "nobody knows" what it would cost. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Mather, head of the county's Homeless Issues Task Force, said the lack of 
information serves to protect the county from further expenditures. "If you 
don't recognize there's a problem, then you don't have to spend more money," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another of the primary goals in overhauling the welfare system was to reduce 
the county's cost. By requiring the recipients to participate in a rigorous 
workfare program and taking a hard line on law enforcement, the supervisors 
said the county would save money by reducing its welfare population to those 
willing to work for their benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County last year sent 6,332 clients to its workfare program. Almost as 
many were found to be eligible for General Relief, but unable to work because 
of a disability. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the county checked whether its workfare program was saving money 
was in 1982. At that time, a study concluded there was a savings. But a cost 
analysis done recently by the county for The Times Orange County Edition 
indicates the program has lost money for the county. 
</P>
<P>
The study for The Times found that it cost the county $552,790 to operate the 
workfare program for the year ending last February -- including employee 
salaries and benefits. But it estimated that the program only deterred enough 
people to save $431,305 in aid payments. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Kersh, the county analyst, also said there was a potential $137,000 savings 
generated by those in the work program performing tasks for the county. That 
savings was calculated by applying the $4.35 hourly minimum wage to the number 
of hours worked by welfare clients. 
</P>
<P>
But he called that a "soft savings" because the jobs assigned to welfare 
clients are intentionally superfluous to the county staff. County rules 
prohibit a welfare client from replacing a salaried employee because of 
protests from county unions and because the welfare workers are largely 
unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the questions about its effectiveness, Diane Edwards, head of the 
General Relief program, insisted that there are intangible savings and that the 
program is cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
After examining the apparent cost shortfall, she said: "In today's situation, 
it's hard to come up with a dollar amount. I believe it, I just can't prove to 
you that it is just as cost-effective as it was" in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's problems in providing for its poor on General Relief are 
severe, but they are not unique. Several other counties, particularly those 
with urban areas, also have homeless and addicted clients in their aid 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County's problem is exacerbated by its lack of low-income housing, 
such as that found in the state's largest cities. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, for example, the county does not give cash to its clients for 
housing. Instead, it has contracts with some of its cheapest hotels and it 
gives clients a voucher that is redeemable only for a room. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, said Bob Morrell, head of the Los Angeles General Relief 
office, there is a bed identified for every client and the city avoids giving 
out some of the cash that might be used to buy drugs or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, however, almost all of the very-low-income hotels -- known as 
SROs for Single-Room Occupancy -- have been demolished over the last few years 
by municipal redevelopment projects. So county officials say they are forced to 
give out cash. 
</P>
<P>
Leaman also said that with a voucher system the county could be liable for 
health and safety conditions in the hotels. And, he said, some clients would 
trade the vouchers for cash or drugs anyway, as they do in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County also has one of the highest General Relief payments in the state 
-- up to $341 per month for an individual. That is largely due to the high cost 
of housing in the area, and it is a rate the county was forced to pay after a 
lawsuit was filed by the Legal Aid Society. General Relief recipients are also 
eligible for up to $90 per month in food stamps, paid for by the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the county's high payment, though, Orange County's $7-million annual 
bill for General Relief in 1988 was much lower than most areas its size. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County, with a $275 maximum monthly payment, spent $16.5 million in 
1988 on its General Relief budget. And Alameda County, with a $310 maximum 
payment, spent $17.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials say their cost is so much lower because less than 3% of 
the population is below the poverty line. But critics, such as Forbath, charge 
that it is also because Orange County is more successful in deterring 
applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Asked overall how the county's welfare program is serving those in need, Leaman 
pondered the question and said, "On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd say 8." 
</P>
<P>
Then he volunteered a perspective for his conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing a manager in this field has to deal with is that these 
programs are run by a political process and a judicial process -- and the 
result is a compromise on almost every issue. 
</P>
<P>
"(It's) a system that almost no real skilled manager would design," he said. 
"Overall, the program is keeping a lot of people afloat. So, given that world, 
it's a miracle the system is serving the needs as well as it is." 
</P>
<P>
SAVINGS FROM WELFARE FRAUD CRACKDOWN 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's Welfare Fraud Early Detection and Prevention Program estimates 
that it has saved taxpayers more than $173 million since it started in March, 
1981. Based on this estimate, the direct tax dollar savings to Orange County is 
5.9% of that total or more than $10 million. Federal and state governments 
share the bulk of the savings.

City Council members strolled four miles along Bristol Street on Saturday for a 
firsthand view of the thoroughfare to see if it needs major redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
Such a project would raze entire blocks as well as rejuvenate blighted areas. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way they heard mixed reviews of the plan, which is designed to clean 
up one of the city's toughest crime and drug neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The potential redevelopment area runs from the Santiago Creek bridge near 
Memory Lane south to Central Avenue. It would involve 783 acres along and near 
Bristol Street. The plan has been criticized by members of a monitoring group 
who say that many residents could lose their homes if the city redevelops the 
area. A separate project would widen Bristol. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the seven council members -- Miguel A. Pulido, Ron May and Richards L. 
Norton -- along with staff aides and a police escort, marched for about three 
hours. They stopped occasionally to talk to business owners and residents, who 
were divided in their opinions. In the past, City Council members have been 
tight-lipped about whether they would support redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
Bristol Street has deteriorated recently, said Pulido, who initiated the 
walking tour. Pulido is familiar with redevelopment -- his family fought City 
Hall in 1983 when its muffler shop was threatened by a redevelopment project on 
1st Street. 
</P>
<P>
Notoriously congested during peak traffic hours, Bristol Street bisects the 
city and is lined with a smorgasbord of houses and mom-and-pop shops. 
</P>
<P>
If the city declares the area a redevelopment zone, Santa Ana will be allowed 
to funnel incremental taxes from improved properties back into the project to 
revitalize the area, said project manager Patrician Nunn. 
</P>
<P>
The money also could be used to widen the street, said Joyce Amerson, manager 
of the street-widening project. The city wants to add two lanes at a cost of 
$45 million to $73 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day, it's (Bristol) bumper-to-bumper traffic. It's carrying cars beyond 
its capacity," Amerson said. 
</P>
<P>
But such redevelopment is unfair to homeowners who would have to move, said 
V.L. (Hank) McGowan, a member of the resident advisory group whose home would 
be affected by the redevelopment plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I've owned my house for 13 years. It's paid and it's mine. Now, all of a 
sudden, the city can take the house right from under me," McGowan said. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner Gregory Rhodes said the plan is "lousy." His house in the 300 block 
of Bristol probably would be razed, Rhodes said. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm getting shafted," Rhodes said. "I know they are trying to 
upgrade the area. But it's a giant impact on me." 
</P>
<P>
The city would be required by state law to relocate people affected by the 
redevelopment and to pay fair market prices for their homes, Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
Bristol Street should be redeveloped but not in a way that jeopardizes people's 
livelihoods, Councilman Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment would be hard on smaller businesses, said Charles Krueger, owner 
of Santana Florist near 1st Street. But Krueger said he welcomes the change 
because the area has been besieged by petty crime and traffic woes. 
</P>
<P>
"Not everybody wants to see the older buildings go down. It's a hardship for 
many of us businessmen. But if they can make the street better, it might be 
worth the sacrifices," Krueger said. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the plan say the redevelopment is "nonsense." Private developers 
should take care of redeveloping areas, said Jim Lowman, who heads the advisory 
group. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the City Council -- acting as the redevelopment agency -- will hold 
a public hearing onthe redevelopment and street-widening projects. A vote is 
scheduled in November.

SALES TAX HIKE'S BACKERS TO STRESS BENEFITS TO DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Anaheim residents can expect letters in the next few weeks -- signed by some of 
their neighbors or civic leaders -- describing plans to widen Katella Avenue 
and Harbor Boulevard, repair Brookhurst Street and build a grade crossing where 
Ball Road passes the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
In San Clemente, letters signed by that community's activists may highlight 
plans to resurface Avenida Calafia, widen Avenida Pico and improve a freeway 
on-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
And in other communities throughout Orange County, voters will begin to receive 
mailers this week describing how their neighborhoods may benefit if on Nov. 7 
they approve Measure M, which would increase the county's sales tax from 6 to 
6.5 cents in order to raise $3.1 billion specifically for transportation 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The mailers will mark the emergence of the million-dollar campaign for Measure 
M. And the goal of what is expected to be a low-key campaign is to deliver a 
personalized message, conveyed in a sort of neighbor-to-neighbor chitchat: how 
the trip from your driveway to your job or grocery store can be made a little 
easier. And how your everyday life might be different if this sales tax is 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole campaign is tied to three words: benefits, benefits and benefits," 
said Alan Hoffenblum, campaign manager for Measure M, which has been projected 
to cost the average county consumer an extra $50 to $75 a year. "It is our 
belief that people will not vote for a tax increase unless they can see what 
they will get for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The strategy to pass a tax increase in fiscally conservative Orange County is a 
lesson in the soft sell. It is tiptoeing to Election Day, hoping not to stir 
the forces that overwhelmingly defeated the last attempt to raise the sales tax 
in Orange County in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign officials say that in the three weeks left before the election, they 
do not plan to use any radio, television or billboard advertising. Rather, they 
will concentrate on a sophisticated, state-of-the-art direct mail pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opponents of Measure M, who are expected to be vastly outspent, 
are hoping to defeat the sales-tax increase with claims that developers will be 
the beneficiaries, and citing as evidence the million-dollar-plus campaign 
financed largely by developer contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the opponents -- still a small and relatively unorganized group -- are 
slow-growth activists and environmentalists who were part of a coalition behind 
last year's countywide slow-growth measure, which was defeated. They include 
slow-growth activist Russ Burkett of San Juan Capistrano and council members 
from Laguna Beach and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But the slow-growth coalition is split on Measure M. Some of its leaders -- 
most notably Tom Rogers -- have endorsed Measure M, and some were even involved 
in writing its language. 
</P>
<P>
Measure M now includes a requirement that every city adopt a growth-management 
plan to make future development contingent on adequate roads. And it would 
create a citizens oversight committee that would monitor how the sales tax 
revenue is spent. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the compromise measure has drawn a list of supporters that is most 
unusual in Orange County politics. 
</P>
<P>
It includes such slow-growth advocates as Rogers and Norm Grossman; development 
company executives, such as the Irvine Co.'s Jack Flannagan; Bob Balgenorth, a 
labor leader with the Building Trades Council; the Democratic Foundation, 
chaired by Audrey Redfern, which is helping with a get-out-the-vote effort; 
Bruce Nestande, a member of the state Transportation Commission, and John 
Simon, chairman of Citizens for Traffic Solutions, which helped defeat the 
slow-growth measure in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not joined the other side," Rogers said recently of his support for 
Measure M. "But I have to say, we got more than we thought (in 
growth-management language in the measure). Every city would have to adopt a 
growth-management plan. And we could never have done that by initiative." 
</P>
<P>
Nestande, chairman of the Measure M campaign, added: "I think the fact the plan 
has the support it has speaks for itself. If this plan had a flaw, a major 
deficiency, you would not see this support. These are very independent people." 
</P>
<P>
The campaign is largely underwritten by developers. The last finance disclosure 
statement on Sept. 30 showed that the proponents had raised and spent almost 
$800,000. That included individual contributions of more than $25,000 from such 
development firms as Buie Corp., Fieldstone Co., J.M. Peters Co., Koll Co., 
Santa Margarita Co., Shea Homes, the William Lyon Co. and Woodcrest Development 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the unsuccessful campaign for a 1-cent sales-tax increase -- which was 
also intended for transportation improvements -- raised about $1.8 million, 
largely from developers. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents say the biggest mistake they made in 1984 was asking for a tax 
increase without showing how it would be spent. This time, the $3.1 billion 
that the tax is expected to generate over the next 20 years is detailed in an 
inch-thick spending plan that includes road maintenance and the construction of 
new roads, widening major roads as well as freeways, and planning for future 
commuter trains. 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, the campaign's pitch will include the personalized message 
about improvements in each voter's neighborhood as well as the protections 
built into the measure for those who distrust government -- the citizen 
oversight committee and the growth-management requirement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dislike for Politicians 
</P>
<P>
Part of the campaign's strategy, in fact, is to exploit the public's basic 
dislike for politicians by emphasizing in literature that the measure was 
"written by Orange County citizens . . . not politicians." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the measure originally was drafted by the Orange County 
Transportation Commission, negotiated with the county's League of Cities, then 
modified by a citizens commission. 
</P>
<P>
But elected officials who support the measure -- including all five Orange 
County supervisors -- are keeping a relatively low profile in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not being played down, but they're not being played up," said campaign 
manager Hoffenblum. "This is not a political plan; it is a citizens plan." 
</P>
<P>
But some of the supervisors do not like the anti-politician pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see why that has to be part of the issue," Board of Supervisors 
Chairman Thomas F. Riley said. "If you keep telling a story long enough, it 
becomes believable." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the campaign message, the key to the race may be how many voters 
will turn out for an off-year election in which Measure M will be the only 
entry on the ballot in many areas of the county. Turnout is expected to be low 
-- 30% of the registered voters or less, which Measure M proponents fear 
worsens their chances. 
</P>
<P>
Polls done by the campaign for Measure M have shown that voters favor the tax, 
62% to 29%. However, a Times Orange County Poll released in early July showed 
that Measure M was favored by 48% of those surveyed and opposed by 46%, down 
from 54% favorable rating in a 1988 poll. With a margin of error of 4%, 
pollster Mark Baldassare, who conducted both polls for the Times Orange County 
Edition, indicated that the measure's chance of passage was far from certain. 
</P>
<P>
Measure M campaign officials are more optimistic -- provided the turnout is 
good. 
</P>
<P>
"If everybody turned out, we get 62% of the vote," Hoffenblum said. "My own 
personal opinion is that if we get a very low turnout, we could do very 
poorly." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is exacerbated by the fact that only 900 polling places will be 
open in this election, contrasted with 2,200 for a normal election-year ballot. 
It means that many people will have to go farther out of their way if they want 
to vote. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, Hoffenblum said, the campaign plans to emphasize absentee 
voting so that voters can cast ballots by mail. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a low turnout has given even greater significance to the 
planned direct-mail campaign targeting those most likely to vote. 
</P>
<P>
"If only 30% of the voters are going to participate, you don't want to waste 
money talking to all of the voters," said Paul Ambrosino, a direct-mail 
consultant in San Francisco. "It's better to communicate repeatedly with the 
30%." 
</P>
<P>
Ambrosino said computer lists can identify those most likely to vote by 
searching the public records of an individual's voting pattern -- how often 
they vote; do they vote only in a presidential year; a normal election year or 
do they vote every time. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't difficult at all," he said. "Voter files available from different 
vendors have all of this information, and it's simply a matter of researching, 
then targeting and tailoring." 
</P>
<P>
They can also tailor that direct mail to address the specific area concerns of 
local voters. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hoffenblum: "People want to know what specific benefit they are going to 
receive, and you can't do that on a 60-second radio spot or on TV. We're trying 
to do a neighbor-to-neighbor campaign. People will get letters from someone 
they know, someone they trust." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHAT MEASURE M WOULD PAY FOR 
</P>
<P>
Measure M, the proposed half-cent sales tax for transportation projects, would 
raise $3.1 billion over 20 years. Measure M designates which projects would be 
undertaken with passage, including: 
</P>
<P>
* Ten-year-earlier completion of Santa Ana Freeway widening from the San Diego 
Freeway interchange in Irvine to the San Gabriel River Freeway in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
* Rebuilding the interchange of the Santa Ana and San Diego freeways, known as 
the El Toro "Y." 
</P>
<P>
* Adding lanes to Interstate 5 in South County, the Riverside Freeway 
throughout the Orange County, the Orange Freeway from Diamond Bar to the Santa 
Ana Freeway, and adding lanes to the Costa Mesa Freeway between the Riverside 
and Santa Ana freeways. 
</P>
<P>
* Building a 220-mile network of "super streets," using Orange County's 21 
busiest streets. 
</P>
<P>
* Expanding Los Angeles-to-San Diego rail service, planning commuter train 
service between Riverside and Irvine and studying additional train service 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
* Coordinating traffic signals throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
* Requiring every city and the county to adopt comprehensive growth management 
plans to link traffic relief with future development. 
</P>
<P>
* Creating a citizens' oversight committee to monitor agencies' compliance with 
the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the added freeway lanes would be reserved for buses and car pools. 
Freeway projects would total $1.325 billion; street and road improvements would 
be $650 million; transit projects -- including rail -- $775 million, and 
regional projects such as "super streets" and signal coordination would get 
$350 million. If Measure M passes with more than 50% of the vote, county 
officials intend to use bonds to finance an early start of many projects.

SEAL BEACH COUNCIL OKS RESIDENTIAL PROJECT ON FORMER WETLANDS SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Seal Beach City Council, in a rare special session Saturday, approved a 
long-debated 355-home development project on the old Hellman Ranch site, a 
former wetlands area. 
</P>
<P>
The special session was called, in part, so that a decision could be made in 
time for the California Coastal Commission staff to review it at a meeting 
later this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Mola Development Co., which agreed during negotiations on the project to 
restore and enlarge the surrounding wetlands, build an 11-acre public park and 
give the city $1 million, wants to have its plans ready for approval by the 
state commission at its Nov. 13 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The housing project, which is north of Pacific Coast Highway and just west of 
Seal Beach Boulevard, has created controversy since it was first proposed more 
than three years ago. But only a handful of people showed up to witness the 
final 3-0 council vote. And only one resident, whose home is near the project, 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Sanfilippo, who has sought refinements of the plan at many previous 
council meetings, asked the council members what their rush was. He urged them 
to wait until a regular meeting of the council next week. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Victor S. Grgas explained that the Coastal Commission was meeting in the 
Southland in November, in Playa del Rey, and that would give Seal Beach 
residents who oppose the development a chance to attend the hearing. The 
commission staff, meeting this week, reviews matters before they go before the 
full commission. 
</P>
<P>
But also, the five members of the council have had a difficult time with a 
quorum recently because of vacation plans and business obligations. 
</P>
<P>
"This was one of the rare times when we could get three of us together to vote 
on this," Councilwoman Joyce Risner said. 
</P>
<P>
Risner and Councilman Joe Hunt approved the project. Council members Frank 
Laszlo, the only opponent of the development, and Edna Wilson could not attend 
the meeting. Laszlo is opposed because the new development would be a gated 
community, and many public officeholders have complained that the city has so 
many gated areas that it is difficult to reach the voters. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach-based development company originally had proposed a 770-unit 
project for the 149-acre site. But that plan, which included more than 600 
condominium units, was strongly opposed by residents and was voted down by the 
Coastal Commission last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not rushed this; we've been at this for 3 1/2 years. We've taken our 
sweet time to get to this point," the mayor told the small audience. "We've 
negotiated a deal we think is fair to the developer and to the city." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Hunt offered another reason for voting as soon as possible: the city 
stands to make about $50,000 for its redevelopment agency from property taxes 
raised from the new single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
"The faster we get going, the sooner that money is going to start rolling in," 
Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
The city council negotiated more than 100 points with the developer. Some 
include: 
</P>
<P>
* The city no longer will have to lease the Gum Grove Park, the linear 
wilderness area that is adjacent to the development. The developers will give 
it to the city. Also, the 11-acre park to be built by the developer will be 
outside the gated area, open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
* Those seeking municipal office will have a right to enter the gated 
community. However, in a compromise, the developers retained the right to keep 
them out if a majority of the homeowners don't want them. 
</P>
<P>
* Mola will build a road connecting the development to Seal Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
* Mola promises to restore 26 acres of degraded wetlands on the property and 
expand them to 36 acres. Mola also promised to return tidal flow to the 
wetlands and replant native flora. 
</P>
<P>
* The development is contingent on an agreement between the executors of the 
Hellman Ranch and city officials that the city buy five acres for city use. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you today that consummation of the five-acre deal is imminent," 
Grgas said. 
</P>
<P>
Grgas also remarked to the few opponents at the meeting that the Coastal 
Commission may order further restrictions on Mola that might appease some of 
the residents in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Risner said after the meeting that she was still less than happy with the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"But politics is the art of compromise," she said.

HOMEOWNERS: IN-HOUSE SQUABBLING MAY POINT TO A LARGER QUESTION OF CONTROL OF 
THE CITY. SOME BLAME IT ON AN UNDERCURRENT OF SUSPICION AGAINST THE COMMUNITY'S

<P>
While Mission Viejo City Councilman Robert A. Curtis battles local developers 
and the Mission Viejo Co. for his political future, another contest is being 
quietly played out against a similar backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
Its outcome, observers say, could chart the course of the city's largest 
association of residents: the Lake Mission Viejo Assn., with nearly 16,000 
household memberships representing about 60,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Strife within the association started with a petition drive in July asking the 
association not to accept a $450,000 gift, in the form of a roadside wall near 
the lake to deflect traffic noise, from the Mission Viejo Co. Assn. membership 
entitles families to use the 124-acre man-made lake. 
</P>
<P>
But months of debate have done little to quell passions in the dispute, and 
other residents are waging a separate but equally impassioned struggle, 
creating a group called Citizens Against Mandatory Lake Membership, which seeks 
to break away from the association. 
</P>
<P>
Various reasons are cited for the continuing dissent within the lake 
association, and not all critics stress the same issues. But an underlying 
current of suspicion involves the Mission Viejo Co., which founded the lake 
association and which critics portray as a meddlesome presence in the young 
city's civic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Those same charges of meddling by the Mission Viejo Co. have dominated debate 
surrounding the effort to recall Curtis, which is being helped financially by 
the Mission Viejo Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of the New York-based Phillip 
Morris Companies Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis has been targeted for recall by a citizens' group that charges he 
"represents outside interests" and is a carpetbagger and a divisive element on 
the City Council who does not properly represent its residents. The group has 
turned in petitions, and the city clerk is verifying signatures to determine 
whether there are enough to require a recall election. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis has denied all allegations, countering that the real issue in the recall 
is his opposition to Mission Viejo Co. development plans. The Mission Viejo Co. 
has given at least $1,385 in the form of consultant services and a loan of 
furniture to the recall organizers, while two developers who have worked as 
subcontractors for the Mission Viejo Co. have given $20,000. New financial 
disclosure records will be filed this week. A spokeswoman said the Mission 
Viejo Co. supports the recall because of Curtis' unsuccessful attempt to annex 
a pie-shaped parcel of developed land to the city, which the company opposed. 
Curtis' pursuit of the annexation is central to several of the recall charges. 
</P>
<P>
The role of the Mission Viejo Co. also is being questioned in the lake 
membership controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mission Viejo Co. is still trying to be parent and treating us as a child, 
and that bothers me," said Larry Gilbert, a community activist who has emerged 
as one of the most vocal critics of the company and lake association. "They 
exert a lot of control, and I don't like Big Brother telling me what to do and 
how to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Suspicion of the company cuts a narrow but deep path through Mission Viejo. 
Most longtime residents express admiration for the company, which began 
building the planned community in 1965. But there is a strong countercurrent of 
resentment as well, and it is asserting itself as the newly formed city tests 
its authority. 
</P>
<P>
W.W. (Tex) Shannon, who organized the anti-wall petition drive that gathered 
more than 2,000 signatures, agreed that the arguments about the association are 
often really disagreements about the company. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has been kind of polarized," he said. "People are either highly 
supportive of the Mission Viejo Co. and everything it does and supports, or 
they are suspicious of it. That's led to some tension." 
</P>
<P>
Although the citizens' committee and wall opponents have begun forging links 
and cooperating with each other, they came from different starting points. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-membership group includes mostly older residents who are protesting a 
covenant in their deeds requiring them to be members of the lake association 
and pay $162 in annual dues, whether they use the lake or not. Association 
officials are unsympathetic, and the group has threatened the association with 
legal action. 
</P>
<P>
Wall opponents coalesced in response to the proposed construction of what the 
Mission Viejo Co. calls an "enhancement project" along the lake shore. 
Supporters of the project, including the association management, say it would 
shield the shoreline from traffic noise along Alicia Parkway, but opponents 
argue that it will rob residents of their view. 
</P>
<P>
That dispute seemed settled when the city, after seeing Shannon's petition and 
hearing from residents vehemently opposed to the wall, rejected the proposal. 
But association officials, backed by the Mission Viejo Co., are pressing ahead 
and are expected to appeal later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the dissidents are also pleading with the city, asking officials there 
to try to give them relief from the association's rules and management. City 
officials, however, are not eager to wade into the fray. 
</P>
<P>
"The lake association is certainly a private organization and as such there is 
no direct relationship with the city," said Mission Viejo Mayor William S. 
Craycraft. "In these cases of tension, the appropriate course would be for them 
to take their complaints to the board of directors of the association." 
</P>
<P>
Association officials, weary of the fighting and trying to keep discussion of 
the issues in-house, blame disgruntled minority elements for attempting to 
disrupt smooth operations. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty people screaming in a room would like us to think that they're the 
majority, but they're not," said association President Jeff Miklaus. 
</P>
<P>
As turmoil has engulfed the association, officials have worked diligently to 
keep any hint of disagreement to themselves, often refusing public comment and 
not returning reporters' phone calls. The association held elections this week, 
but officials refused to allow members of the press and public to attend 
proceedings. Later, Gilbert accused officials of running a "sham" election, and 
only then did officials respond. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I had more votes than Mr. Gilbert, that makes the election unfair," 
Miklaus said. "I have a problem with that." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert said proxies were used improperly during the balloting, but Miklaus 
denied it, and said Gilbert misunderstood the power of the board in an 
association election. As president, Miklaus has the authority to cast proxy 
ballots, which he did in several contested races. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert and other dissidents "don't care who or what they step on to get what 
they want," Miklaus said. "I have strived to make decisions based on what's 
best for the majority of members, and I'll continue to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Sheean, an association delegate, was one of several who credited Miklaus 
and the board with adeptly managing a difficult situation, but he conceded that 
centrifugal tensions wrought by the two groups have put new pressures on 
association officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I've been surprised by the amount of opposition," Sheean said. "I 
really think this is as much a comment on people's feelings about the Mission 
Viejo Co. as it is about the association. . . . I think this is a case of 
people resenting that they feel dependent, so that when they get a chance to 
get even, they take their best shot." 
</P>
<P>
Still, not everyone is distressed at the way association business has evolved. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, it's been tense," Sheean said. "But in a community like this, where 
everything is so neat and tidy, I kind of welcome a little action."

UCI AUDITOR EXAMINES CHARGES OF IMPROPRIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The internal auditor for UC Irvine is investigating allegations of possible 
financial improprieties involving mid-level managers in the maintenance 
department of the university's financially troubled medical center in Orange, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation apparently was prompted by unspecified charges made in recent 
weeks by two senior employees of UCI Medical Center's facilities management 
department, one of whom recently left the center, medical center sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Yeilding, director of internal auditing for the UC Irvine campus, said 
his office has done "minimal work" so far but plans in coming weeks to step up 
its investigation into allegations of improprieties within what he described as 
mid-level management at the facilities department. He declined to name the 
individuals implicated in the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
He and other center officials refused to discuss any details of the case, 
citing its active status. "We don't know how good" the information is yet, 
Yeilding said. 
</P>
<P>
However, UCI Medical Center spokesman Kenneth Ross said he believed that 
investigators had examined the allegations of financial impropriety, found "no 
substance" to them, and closed the case. Officials with the facilities 
management department declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Yeilding said that the allegations center on what appear to be an isolated 
problem rather than on any systemic financial abuse within that department of 
the medical center that handles maintenance and minor construction. As for the 
amount of money that may be involved, he said, "My guess is it wouldn't even be 
in the tens of thousands." 
</P>
<P>
The investigation comes at a time of increasing operating losses for the 
hospital, which reported a loss of more than $11 million for its last fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators blame what they say is an overwhelming number of uninsured or 
impoverished patients whose care must be covered in part by the center's own 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
One employee in the division said to be a source of some of the allegations 
refused to discuss the case. The former employee identified as the other source 
of the allegations could not be reached for comment.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: BAILIFFS -- THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE INDIFFERENT -- MAKE 
A BIG DIFFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When an important case is about to go to trial, news reporters always think of 
the basics: Will this mess up my vacation? Will it be assigned to an 
interesting judge? Will I get a good bailiff? 
</P>
<P>
Most deputy marshals in Orange County's courtrooms are first rate. You just 
hate getting that rare bad one. Bad is defined here as grouchy, testy, lazy, 
uncooperative, cynical, moody -- or as a nice person who just doesn't happen to 
like reporters. 
</P>
<P>
With so many courtrooms to be covered, reporters depend on bailiffs to save 
them enormous amounts of time. A quick telephone call can save an hour of your 
day between courts in Santa Ana and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"You pick a jury yet?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, but no opening statements until Monday." 
</P>
<P>
Or: 
</P>
<P>
"They put the defendant on yet?" 
</P>
<P>
"He won't make it today. Juror has a doctor's appointment; we knock off at 
noon." 
</P>
<P>
These answers are lifesavers, unlike, for instance, "Hey, I don't know nothin', 
man," or "You'll have to call back after 4:30." 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say some bailiffs live to coddle reporters. Even the good ones 
let you know when you've been a pain just once too often. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite bailiff is Jack Quinn, who now works for Superior Court Judge 
Richard J. Beacom. Quinn is like a lovable pet you'd give someone special for 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Judges adore him. Jurors always comment how helpful and pleasant he is. And 
reporters get no special treatment from Quinn. He usually nails us about the 
stories we've missed, or overplayed. But even murderers in court get respect 
from Quinn, and that's all that any of us really wants. 
</P>
<P>
Judges become attached to good bailiffs. Superior Court Judge David O. Carter 
thinks so much of Deputy Marshal Steve Scott that he makes sure Scotty goes 
with him any time he changes assignments. 
</P>
<P>
And although bailiffs don't always look busy, their job can be demanding. In 
the yearlong Randy Kraft serial-murder trial, Deputy Marshal Mitch Miller had 
his hands full: 20 jurors (counting alternates), a mountain of evidence to help 
watch, and a steady stream of traffic in and out of the spectator section. When 
lawyers would ask the court to check something in the statutes, Judge Donald A. 
McCartin would simply nod in Miller's direction: "You got that, Mitch?" 
</P>
<P>
And Miller was accommodating to reporters when to do so would not interfere 
with his work. He knew we had a job to do. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the only bailiff I've ever really disliked once substituted for Miller 
during the Kraft trial. Testimony ended early -- at 2 p.m. -- and he abruptly 
swept reporters and other spectators from the courtroom. Just five minutes, we 
asked. We had matters to check with the clerk. Nope, he said. Get out. 
</P>
<P>
He always says that it's for security. But I've been watching this guy for 
years. Truth is, his favorite pastime is propping his feet on the desk and 
taking it easy. I couldn't wait for Miller's return. 
</P>
<P>
Bailiffs are also a jury's lifeline to the system. Jurors have lots of 
questions and no one to turn to but the bailiff. I remember a day when jurors 
ordered to report at 9 a.m. had had to wait three hours in the hall while the 
judge and lawyers met privately. Finally, Deputy Marshall Rocky Galante opened 
the doors, announcing: "OK folks, it's 9 o'clock." The laughter it brought did 
a lot to ease the frustration. 
</P>
<P>
I was steaming last week when a bailiff kept me out of a courtroom. It was 
after dark, and the judge had insisted that the lawyers keep working. The 
bailiff claimed it was a closed hearing. I knew better, and I verified the next 
day it had been open to the public. This guy just didn't want the bother at a 
late hour. 
</P>
<P>
But that incident made me think about the countless times bailiffs have put up 
with my telephone calls while jurors were deliberating, or took time to help me 
with a file when the clerk was away. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it takes a bad experience to remind you to treat all those good folks a 
little better.

TIME TO FEEL SOME GUILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
None of us who heard our mothers admonish us to finish our spinach by reminding 
us of the "starving children of China" can but feel guilty when we waste food, 
even though some of us now leave food on our plates simply to save our figures. 
</P>
<P>
But, during this coming week, proclaimed Hunger Week by the Orange County Board 
of Supervisors, perhaps it is a good idea to let the guilt jab at our 
consciences. The fact is, as mother said, there are starving children in many 
parts of the world. And even in an area as affluent as Orange County -- where 
the median income tops $45,000 -- there are thousands of people who go to bed 
hungry every night. 
</P>
<P>
Hunger Week is part of a larger program, including World Food Day on Monday, in 
which 140 countries will focus on hunger in observances sponsored by the Food 
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In Orange County, events 
will include food drives, school talks, fund-raising and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
Finding a hungry person sometimes means looking only as far as next door. 
Nationwide, estimates are that a majority of adults aged 55 to 75 consume less 
than two-thirds of the nutrients they need to stay healthy, in many cases 
because they can't get out to buy food or have no one who cares for them. And 
one-fifth of all American children are below the federal poverty level, 
according to the House Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families, with 
hunger a direct result of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
America is spared the tragedy of massive starvation. And, while it had nothing 
to do with finishing spinach, so is China. But deadly hunger persists in Africa 
and parts of Central America, South America, India and Southeast Asia, 
according to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 18 million people -- three-fourths of them children under the age of 5 -- 
die of hunger each year, hunger agencies say. Only 10% of them die directly 
from lack of food, with the rest dying of illnesses that someone with enough 
food would easily survive. 
</P>
<P>
It is good to focus on hunger, especially in Orange County, where this past 
year some services to the poor have been threatened by city councils responding 
to fears of some residents that the homeless will breed crime in their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
While understanding some of their concerns, we recognize those who do not 
complain. And we especially admire those who open their eyes to the needs of 
their neighbors and who commit themselves, during Hunger Week and all year 
long, to finding food for the hungry.

2 VIEWS ON SALES TAX HIKE FOR ROADS; 
</P>
<P>
NO: MEASURE M IS A TAX INCREASE COSTING EVERY RESIDENT IN ORANGE COUNTY AN 
AVERAGE $63 A YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Want to buy a duck? It's pretty much your garden variety duck. You know -- 
looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck. Funny thing, though. 
The folks trying to sell it don't call it a duck. 
</P>
<P>
This particular duck is labeled the "Orange County Traffic Improvement and 
Growth Management Ordinance," or Measure M. Doesn't sound too bad. But wait! 
What's that quacking? 
</P>
<P>
Measure M is a tax measure! A half-cent sales tax increase to be exact, costing 
every man, woman and child in Orange County an average $63 a year. That's $126 
a year for a married couple, and $252 for a family of four. Over 20 years, 
that's more than $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Measure M is also a bond measure. It allows spending up to $900 million a year, 
but since the tax raises just a fraction of that, bonds may be sold to raise 
the rest. 
</P>
<P>
So, what does it buy you? Traffic improvements? 
</P>
<P>
Well, there are super-streets, or mini-highways, like Harbor Boulevard and 
Laguna Canyon Freeway, er . . . Road. It accelerates Santa Ana Freeway 
improvements. And it builds car-pool lanes on the Santa Ana, Riverside and 
Orange Freeways. That's fine -- if you can car-pool. But projects on state or 
federal highways require state and/or federal approval. What if Caltrans or the 
feds have other plans? 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, shouldn't Caltrans or the Federal government pay for state and federal 
roads? Actually, after shortchanging Orange County for years, Caltrans finally 
is funding some of the same improvements provided under Measure M. Why tax 
ourselves again? 
</P>
<P>
Will traffic improve? It could, if growth were managed properly. But Orange 
County Transportation Commission (OCTC) documents show that, when all is said 
and done, many locations will still be at level of service F, or system 
failure. The tax provides money to fix these areas, but new development will 
leave things just as bad as they are today, or worse. For example, OCTC 
projects that development in the Anaheim Stadium area will triple, leaving the 
Santa Ana-Orange-Garden Grove interchange at level of service F. The 
interchange of the Santa Ana and San Diego Freeways will also be at level F, 
after massive development at the El Toro "Y." In both areas, you'll pay 
millions to expand capacity. A lot of good it'll do you. 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't Measure M require growth management? Well, local growth management 
plans are required, but that's nothing new. For years, state law has required 
that cities and counties adopt general plans specifying the type and amount of 
growth that may occur and coordinate them with plans for streets and highways. 
If Orange County governments don't obey existing law, will they obey a new law 
any better? 
</P>
<P>
Under Measure M, the citizens' committee supposedly overseeing things is 
expressly forbidden from even considering whether growth plans are adequate. 
The committee can merely check off whether or not a piece of paper called a 
plan exists. Further, Measure M permits planning for levels of service commonly 
defined as the lower acceptable limit for most drivers. It is claimed Measure M 
won't benefit developers. Sure, that's why developers have already kicked in 
nearly a million dollars in "duck feed" to promote it -- and will undoubtedly 
double or triple that by November. Why? 
</P>
<P>
The tax provides commuter rail service straight from Riverside to Irvine 
Spectrum, where OCTC projects growth at almost 500%. Guess who benefits? By the 
way, this project is so costly, one OCTC member speculated that it might be 
cheaper to buy houses in Irvine for commuters. 
</P>
<P>
Tax dollars go for car-pool lanes in San Clemente. What future development and 
traffic are these new lanes for? Measure M specifically provides tax money to 
deal with "cumulative effects of development." Who profits from that 
development? After Measure M money is spent on Caltrans projects, nothing 
prevents the reallocation of Caltrans funds to projects that help developers. 
These guys are no dummies. When they invest big bucks, they expect big returns. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of later, Measure M sets us up for future taxes. Much of the transit 
money goes for operating subsidies and rolling stock with a useful life of 12 
to 30 years. What about future operating subsidies? How will we replace old 
equipment? The transit right of way to be acquired can't complete the system, 
and there's no money for construction or operations. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, why are they trying to muzzle the duck? If Measure M is so great, why 
obscure its true nature as a tax, both in its title and in ballot arguments? 
Why are the duck pushers so reluctant to debate local citizens opposed to 
Measure M? Why will they attend "information meetings" where they don't have to 
share the podium, but avoid open forums? Perhaps they fear the feathers will 
fly if they stop ducking the issues! 
</P>
<P>
Vote No on Measure M!

HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the front page of your Orange County Edition (Oct. 6), there was a story on 
a housing project for low-income families to be built by a coalition of Habitat 
for Humanity, the Fieldstone Co. and Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
While the great bulk of information you conveyed was correct, there was one 
significant error. Your article stated that this project was basically my idea. 
While I would like to take credit for it, it was the brainchild of Dave 
Langlois, one of our corporate directors and manager of our Orange County 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of whose idea it was, we see this as a tremendous opportunity to use 
our home-building skills in reaching out compassionately to some of Orange 
County's hard-working but less fortunate families.

TRAFFIC ATTITUDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The philosophy and beliefs expressed by Sherry Lee Meddick ("Traffic Solutions 
and Measure A," Oct. 8) sadly reflect the ideas and misconceptions of many 
Orange County residents with regard to their responsibilities for solving our 
transportation and other societal problems. 
</P>
<P>
By stating that she has paid gasoline taxes for 20 years in justifying her 
opinion, Meddick ignores the fact that Californians, compared with 1969, should 
be paying a 50-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax just to keep up with the effects of 
inflation and the fuel-efficient automobile. 
</P>
<P>
The Silverado resident also says she did not cause the problems. Nonsense! We 
all did, and we will continue to make them worse unless we end our 
recalcitrance toward justifiable taxation and overcome the demagoguery of many 
of our political leaders.

THE DEMISE OF FOUNTAIN VALLEY TRAUMA CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having been a principal architect of the Emergency Medical Services of Orange 
County and founding director of the trauma service at Fountain Valley Regional 
Hospital and Medical Center, I have been following with concern the 
deterioration of emergency medical services in Orange County and the impending 
demise of the Fountain Valley Regional Trauma Center. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of the trauma center impacts almost exclusively on relatively affluent 
cities, like Huntington Beach, Newport Beach and Fountain Valley, whose 
population of about 400,000 is able and willing to pay for emergency medical 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of Fountain Valley Regional Hospital from the Orange County trauma 
system will force diversion of patients from these communities to Western 
Medical Center, UCI Medical Center or even Mission Hospital Regional Medical 
Center, which would require an unacceptable surface transport time, according 
to national and local standards. 
</P>
<P>
These cities have excellent paramedic coverage and are served by two base 
stations at Hoag and Humana Huntington Beach hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
It is conceivable that for the immediate future, these communities could 
develop a program in which their citizens can still obtain the benefits of 
trauma coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The financial burden of emergency systems and trauma centers now falls on 
physicians and hospitals, whereas in fact these facilities benefit society as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
As with police and fire department services, the burden of paying for emergency 
services should fall on the public. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians who back up hospital emergency departments should be reimbursed for 
their services at the same level as they would be compensated for treating 
patients in their private practices. Funds for payment of physician services 
could come from local communities by way of individual taxation or by 
contributions from the involved city governments. 
</P>
<P>
Governments have always been derelict about their obligations on behalf of the 
poor in hope that the private sector will bail them out. Local emergency 
medical services are in need of urgent critical care, and innovative solutions 
by the public will be required.

THE DEMISE OF FOUNTAIN VALLEY TRAUMA CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the closure of the Fountain Valley Regional Trauma Center: 
</P>
<P>
During the past 20 years I have been integrally involved in the emergency 
medical systems in Southern California. I have worked as an ambulance driver, 
emergency medical technician and as a charge nurse in the trauma unit at 
Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
During the past two decades, I have directly observed the relationship between 
the progress in the emergency medical service and patient survival. Accidents 
can happen to anyone, anywhere and at any time. Sure, there are deaths from 
severe head and spinal injuries. But dozens of people survive and resume normal 
or near-normal activities, thanks to timely intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Trauma centers are a vital link in the emergency medical system. Each of us has 
a stake in their continued service. Every time one closes, it further burdens 
the remaining trauma centers and community resources, thereby accelerating 
their demise. This ultimately impacts us all personally and economically. 
Paramedics delivering trauma patients to non-trauma facilities does not work. 
Trauma centers have trained professionals on standby to perform dramatic 
interventions that do indeed save lives. 
</P>
<P>
The public must act now. Your children, neighbor or you may be the next 
accident victim to benefit from a sound emergency/trauma program -- or die en 
route to a distant facility or an inadequate one. The private sector can no 
longer afford to provide costly emergency and basic medical service without 
reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
Government continually underpays for services rendered, and the average patient 
cannot cover the cost of an underinsured hospital visit. Orange County is one 
of the richest counties in the country. It must have the clout to secure 
continued viability of our successful emergency medical system for all members 
of our society, rich and poor, young and old.

RIGHTS PANEL CHIEF

So William Allen of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission believes that protection 
of minority rights causes social divisiveness. Well, I suppose so. As long as 
minorities "knew their place" and did not raise their voices in protest, things 
looked peaceful -- never mind the injustice. We might even give Allen the 
benefit of the doubt and say he is advocating the theory of "benign neglect." 
Under this theory minorities quietly work out their own problems without undue 
attention from the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
If that is the case, what is he doing at (Rev.) Lou Sheldon's anti-homosexual 
conference? "Benign neglect" is the furthest thing from the minds of Sheldon, 
(Rep.) William Dannemeyer and their cohorts. They would ban gay and lesbian 
groups from access to public parks, recriminalize homosexual conduct in 
California, bar gays and lesbians from teaching, and forbid the appearance of 
homoerotic art in publicly funded museums. 
</P>
<P>
This is government tyranny and interference, not a policy of hands off. 
</P>
<P>
Professor Allen's theories might have some debatable academic interest, but his 
appearance at Sheldon's conference marks him as a bigot and a homophobe.

RIGHT TO WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The members of Los Amigos observed with interest Laguna Beach Mayor Robert F. 
Gentry's recent statements supporting the rights of all people to seek gainful 
employment. We are specifically referring to his view that people are first of 
all human beings and should be treated in a just and humane manner, whatever 
their color or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry's candor and public openness is a hopeful sign to those of us who view 
with disgust the use of plainclothes police officers to entrap and arrest 
people whose only "crime" is the desire to find work so they can feed 
themselves. It is hoped that other mayors will use the Laguna Beach approach to 
the problem of day laborers rather than follow the model established north of 
Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The desire of people all over the world to come to the United States of America 
is nothing new to us, but it is not without its accompanying problems. Since 
most all of us have immigrant heritage, we should all be more understanding of 
this latest surge of immigration and seek to find humane solutions to the 
problems that develop from it. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to us to be morally right to treat all people first as human beings 
and then seek humane and just ways to deal with other issues. We teach these 
new entrants into the "American Dream" what liberty and justice for all means 
by the way we implement these principles in our political practices.

TITAN RUSH HOUR: PRINGLE RUNS OVER PACIFIC IN VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Pringle could hardly get his pads straightened and his chin strap 
tightened Saturday before Cal State Fullerton gave him the ball time and again. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Fullerton's offensive line didn't open many holes, and Pringle 
didn't find many of the ones they did open in a loss to Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
But against the University of the Pacific Saturday, the holes were plentiful 
and Pringle didn't let many go to waste. The Titans gave him the ball 42 times 
and he finished with a career-high 242 yards rushing in Fullerton's 35-26 Big 
West Conference victory in front of 7,127 at Amos Alonzo Stagg Memorial 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
By halftime, Pringle had 124 yards and a school record for touchdowns in a game 
(four). He added one more touchdown -- this one receiving -- in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Five touchdowns in the game for Fullerton, five for Pringle. 
</P>
<P>
By game's end, Pringle was exhausted. But with Pacific closing in, he was still 
in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd just take a deep breath and run," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Before Saturday, no Titan had carried the ball more than 36 times in a game, 
and no one had run for 200 yards since Rick Calhoun in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"Not too bad," Pringle said when he heard he had 200 yards. "Our line blocked 
excellent." 
</P>
<P>
Pringle, the national leader in all-purpose running, has five 100-yard rushing 
games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton would have been happy to see the game end sooner than it did. 
</P>
<P>
After building a 35-7 lead in the third quarter, the Titans let Pacific come 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't make anything easy," Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said. "Thirty-five 
to seven, and here we go again." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy's halftime talk was a warning against the dangers of complacency -- and 
a reminder of Pacific's past comebacks and Fullerton's past folds. It didn't 
seem to make much of an impression. 
</P>
<P>
The lead was still 21 points when the fourth quarter began, but Pacific cut it 
to 35-20 with nine minutes left after a 77-yard touchdown drive that began with 
Louis Greggs' interception of a pass by Dan Speltz, who completed 17 of 22 
passes for 228 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The interception was Speltz's first in his past 133 attempts over four games. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific got another chance when the Tigers recovered Pringle's fumble with 7:51 
left. 
</P>
<P>
But the Tigers took six minutes to drive 82 yards for a touchdown, scoring with 
1:40 remaining. The Tigers failed on a two-point conversion attempt for the 
second time in the game, leaving the score 35-26. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton safely fielded an onside kick and ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
"The win was good for the record, and that was it," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
The game began with back-to-back touchdown drives. With only seven minutes 
gone, the score was already 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was going to be a 39-38 game like a couple of years ago," Murphy 
said. "Whoever has the ball last wins." 
</P>
<P>
But Pacific's offense, led by Troy Kopp, the freshman from Mission Viejo High 
School, didn't score again in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Kopp completed 13 of 20 passes for 173 yards with a touchdown and an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
David Henigan, a freshman from Fountain Valley who started at quarterback in 
Pacific's first two games, got his chance on the Tigers' third possession, but 
Pacific was forced to punt after three plays. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Thomas led Pacific's running attack with 114 yards in 16 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's defense, which held the Tigers to a touchdown in the first half, 
finally faltered. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave up big plays," linebacker Russ Oleyer said. "Big plays on third and 
long . . . The defense wasn't wrapping things up. We'd make a hit and nobody 
would wrap it up. 
</P>
<P>
"If they'd had any more time, we'd have been scared." 
</P>
<P>
Going into the game, Fullerton was worried about its running attack. With a 
back as good as Pringle, Fullerton somehow was held to 29 yards rushing last 
week -- a statistic reminiscent of the Titans' loss to Northern Illinois in the 
season opener, when Fullerton had only five yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
"After last week, the question was whether we'd be able to run the football," 
Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton adjusted by turning to Tim Byrnes, a fullback who is out of a job in 
the Titans' one-back offense. But with Byrnes in the game at tight end or 
receiver, Fullerton essentially had an extra back to block. 
</P>
<P>
"We beefed up our front a little bit," Speltz said. "Byrnes was in motion a lot 
and doing a lot of lead blocking." 
</P>
<P>
The Titan offense started much like it did against Nevada Las Vegas two weeks 
ago, with a high-scoring first half. 
</P>
<P>
But Speltz, always with an eye for shortcomings, saw the down side. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been nice to score 28 in the second half, too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But even he couldn't complain much. 
</P>
<P>
"We just ran our offense," Speltz said. "The coaches did a great job of keeping 
things balanced. It seemed like everything they called was open." 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Fullerton moved to 3-3-1, 2-1 in the Big West. Pacific is 
1-6, 1-4. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans head into the biggest conference game of the season next week, 
against Big West favorite Fresno State in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
"Our backs were up against the wall," Pringle said. "We had to win this one 
going into Fresno." 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton kicker Phil Nevin missed his only field-goal attempt, a 48-yarder in 
the second quarter. . . . Pacific's Greg Koperek, a former Edison High School 
player, returned to action despite breaking his arm three weeks ago. He had 
four tackles.

FLIPPER FINDS PRACTICE MAKES SENSE; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: WITH HIS MIND NOW FIRMLY FIXED ON HIS JOB, WIDE RECEIVER ANDERSON 
REALIZES THAT PRACTICE REALLY IS A PRELUDE TO SUCCESS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Last year in practice, rookie Flipper Anderson's mind would sometimes, well, 
wander. Is it any wonder? 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't coincidence that some of his pass routes seemed to zig-zag across the 
field in the shape of dollar signs. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson says he couldn't get over the fact that he was a rich young Ram. Who 
could concentrate on a pass pattern when showrooms were still open? 
</P>
<P>
"I was going from having no money to having money," Anderson said of his 
transition from a UCLA senior to the National Football League. "You're at 
practice thinking about what you're going to do after practice." 
</P>
<P>
What was important? 
</P>
<P>
Clubs, dances, parties, cars, clothes. Football. In that order, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
"Just having fun," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, what's so hard about catching a ball? He'd been doing it all his life. 
</P>
<P>
By the second game of the 1988 season, Anderson had his first NFL reception, a 
21-yarder against Detroit on Sept. 11. Six weeks later, he caught his second 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
In offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese's simple rules of pass etiquette, he who 
works hardest in practice gets rewarded in games. Some weeks, Anderson opened 
his playbook on Wednesday and wondered if he was still on the team. Where was 
No. 83? 
</P>
<P>
Zampese might have suggested Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was just a kid then. He's 24 now, and it shows. Through five weeks, 
Anderson already has matched last season's total of 11 receptions. In the Rams' 
eyes, he's a different player, becoming overnight a complete receiver and 
big-time weapon. 
</P>
<P>
He's more than just Henry Ellard's shadow, in other words. Anderson is 
averaging 30.9 yards per catch, incredible when you consider no one in either 
conference is even close. Mervyn Fernandez of the Raiders comes closest with an 
average of 23.3 yards per catch. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's secret? Practice, practice, practice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a helluva difference how I'm playing and competing in practice compared 
to last year," he said. "That's the key to where I'm at right now." 
</P>
<P>
Last year's reception drought taught Anderson a few lessons about the football 
world according to Ernie Zampese. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't do your thing in practices, he's not the type of coach to go, 
'Well, he's a gamer,' " Anderson said. "You can't just show him you can do it 
in a game. You've got to show him you can do it in practice, so they have the 
confidence to put you in a game." 
</P>
<P>
It's amazing how fast maturity kicks in between ages 23 and 24. 
</P>
<P>
"I take practice more serious than I did last year," Anderson said. "That's 
where it is. Practice is the hard part. The games are fun. Last year, I was 
just happy to be here and getting paid for doing this. It was fun. I didn't 
look at it as the business that it is." 
</P>
<P>
And this year, Anderson has meant serious business. He's so good now, Aaron Cox 
will have a tough time getting his starting spot back. Cox, remember, was the 
second starter last season as a rookie and finished the season with 28 
receptions. But he pulled a hamstring early in training camp and Anderson, with 
his 4.42 40-yard speed, raced right by his friend Cox, who is now returning to 
form. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Anderson and Cox have all but switched roles. Cox is now the No. 3 
receiver and has only one catch through five games. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't affected our relationship at all," Anderson said. "Unfortunately, he 
got hurt. I got the opportunity to come in and do some things, to show what I 
can do, and I've done everything the coaches have asked of me. As far as our 
relationship goes, Aaron and I are best of friends. It's kind of a role 
reversal from what it was last year. People ask me, 'How come Aaron's not 
playing?' People don't realize he's playing a lot, but he hasn't caught the 
ball that many times." 
</P>
<P>
The third receiver in the Rams' offense takes what he can get, which isn't 
much. Last season, Ellard and the two tight ends, Damone Johnson and Pete 
Holohan, combined for 187 receptions. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson also gives much of the credit for his improvement to Ellard, every 
young receiver's role model. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best route runner I've seen," Anderson said. "He gets out of his 
breaks quicker than anyone I've ever seen. I wish I had his ankles." 
</P>
<P>
Ankles? 
</P>
<P>
"He just stops on a dime out of his breaks," Anderson said. "I would blow my 
ankles out if I tried the things he did. I don't know how he does it." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson learned from Ellard that being fast and being good aren't necessarily 
related. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Henry's one of the fastest guys," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Could you beat him in a foot race? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah," he said, chuckling, "I think so. It would probably be close, but I 
think I could beat him in a race. But he's quick. There's a difference between 
quick and fast. He runs his routes real quick. He's quicker than I am." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson couldn't have asked for a better receiving partner. All the attention 
Ellard receives from defenses leaves more running room for him. 
</P>
<P>
"You pretty much know Henry's going to get double covered, so most of the time 
I'm going to see single coverage," Anderson said. "That makes me even hungrier. 
If a guy's covering me (with) single-coverage, I think I can win at least 80% 
of the time. That makes it fun." 
</P>
<P>
It's gotten to the point where Anderson doesn't make a big deal about his 
30-yard per catch ratio. 
</P>
<P>
" It's not as hard as it seems in this offense," he said. "Henry's the 
control-type receiver and I'm the deep guy. Most of the balls that go deep are 
going to come to me." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Statistically, the Rams are the league's second-worst team against the pass, 
but sometimes numbers are deceiving. Or so says Buffalo quarterback Frank 
Reich, making his first NFL start against the Rams Monday night. "The only 
reason the Rams are ranked where they are in passing is because they're 5-0, 
and they're ahead of everyone," he said. "And everyone has to throw to beat 
them." . . . Jim Everett is the NFL's second-leading passer with a 104.3 
rating, trailing only Joe Montana's 108.6. . . . Receiver Henry Ellard has 
caught at least one pass in his past 40 games. Ellard leads the NFL with 636 
yards. . . . The Rams were never interested in obtaining tailback Herschel 
Walker, traded from Dallas to Minnesota this week. John Robinson has long 
admired Walker's skills, but says the days of one dominant back in his system 
are over for now. "I don't know that we'd give him the opportunity," Robinson 
said. "I don't want to go back to a 2,000 (yard) rusher and a non-spiral 
passer." . . . Greg Bell's hamstring still isn't 100%, but the odds of him 
missing Monday's game against his former teammates are about a million-to-one. 
. . . Linebacker Fred Strickland is listed as questionable for Monday. 
Strickland had to have fluid drained from his right knee after last week's 
victory over Atlanta. He had arthroscopic surgery on the knee in August.

DEFENSE HELPS RANCHO SANTIAGO STAY UNBEATEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although it got pushed around a bit, Rancho Santiago College's defense 
responded in the clutch to help the Dons to a 35-14 victory over Cerritos 
Saturday in a Mission Conference game in front of about 1,500 at Santa Ana 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The unbeaten Dons led, 14-7, midway in the third quarter when Rancho Santiago 
linebacker Fred Soares intercepted a pass and raced 26 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
After the score, Cerritos fumbled on its second play and Rancho Santiago 
defensive back Scott McMahon recovered. The Dons then went 50 yards in 11 
plays, scoring on a 11-yard pass from quarterback Scott Wood to running back 
Paul Maund. Rancho Santiago then led, 28-7. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos cut the lead to 28-14, but the Rancho Santiago defense stopped two 
subsequent Falcon drives, the second on an interception by McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
In the game, Rancho Santiago recovered two fumbles and had three interceptions. 
Mike Moore also had an interception for Rancho Santiago (5-0 overall and 4-0 in 
Mission Conference play). 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago is ranked second the Southland Poll and sixth in the J.C. 
Grid-Wire national poll. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense has been doing super," Rancho Santiago Coach Dave Ogas said. "But 
all the kids have really been doing well. We've rallied together with a great 
deal of confidence in the last few week." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago had 480 yards in total offense, including 258 by quarterback 
Wood. He was 16 of 26 with three touchdowns and one interception. Estrus 
Crayton rushed for 166 yards in 29 carries and also scored three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Crayton scored Rancho Santiago's first touchdown on a 10-yard run in the first 
quarter. He broke a 7-7 tie with a 27-scoring run in the second quarter and 
scored the Dons' last touchdown on a two-yard run with 4:01 left. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos (2-3-1, 1-3) had 314 yards in total offense, including 159 from 
running back Tyrone Vickers. Vickers had a 78-yard touchdown run on Cerritos' 
first play from scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago plays at Riverside (also 5-0) next Saturday in the Mission 
Conference Central Division opener.

In other Mission Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton 30, Grossmont 17 -- Kicker Eric Lang had three field goals, one a 
school-record 55-yarder, to lead visiting Fullerton. Rick Frank set the old 
mark of 52 yards in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, 3-2 overall and 2-2 in conference play, also was led by running back 
Jeff Andrews, who had 134 yards rushing on 18 carries and two touchdowns. 
Andrews moved to within 19 yards of the career-yardage record at Fullerton, 
increasing his total to 2,018 yards. Grossmont is 1-4, 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West 24, Palomar 14 -- Sean Cheatham rushed for 147 yards and two 
touchdowns to pace Golden West (3-2, 3-1) at Orange Coast. Cheatham also 
completed his only pass for a 39-yard gain. He scored on runs of 34 and two 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Sylvia intercepted a pass and returned it 12 yards for a touchdown in the 
second quarter to give Golden West a 14-0 lead. Palomar quarterback Scott 
Barrick was 29 of 59 for 300 yards with a touchdown and three interceptions. 
Palomar is 1-4, 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena 24, Saddleback 20 -- Saddleback took the lead, 20-17, with 4:44 left 
on a 38-yard scoring run by John Burns. But Pasadena came back to win on 
10-yard pass from Jay Walker to Derrick Howard with with 53 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Burns had 138 yards in 18 carries and scored three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback dropped is 1-4, 1-3. Pasadena is 4-1, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback reserve quarterback Jeff Bailey replaced John Barnes with 7:04 left 
in the second quarter and was 14 of 28 passes for 217 yards and a touchdown 
thereafter.

Despite losing its leading rusher, Orange Coast College cruised to a 34-7 
victory over San Diego Mesa in a Mission Conference football game Saturday at 
OCC. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Greg Angelovic completed 16 of 23 passes for 179 yards and three 
touchdowns to lead the Pirates (4-1 overall and 3-1 in conference play). But 
the afternoon started disastrously for running back Mike Vaez and OCC. 
</P>
<P>
Vaez ran 15 yards on OCC's first play, but a helmet hit his right knee as he 
was tackled. The play was nullified for illegal motion, and Vaez was finished 
for the game and most likely the season. He spent the rest of the first half 
with ice on his injured knee, then was taken to a hospital for further 
examination. 
</P>
<P>
Vaez came into the game as the second-leading community college rusher in 
Orange County with 454 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of taints the win, " OCC Coach Bill Workman said. "We're talking major 
reconstructive surgery at this point. That's the early report anyway." 
</P>
<P>
With Vaez out, fullback Jason McGehee handled most of the running. He had 94 
yards and two touchdowns in the first half as OCC opened a 20-0 lead. He 
finished with 110 yards in 22 carries and had three catches for 52 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Craig led OCC receivers with seven catches for 101 yards and two 
touchdowns. Craig and Angelovic combined on scoring passes of 12 and nine 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
OCC outgained San Diego Mesa, 441-227. Mesa is 1-3, 2-3. STEVE KRESAL

In a Sea View League game: 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor 24, University 21 -- Newport Harbor High School Coach Jeff 
Brinkley thinks his players might have learned some valuable lessons in the 
league opener at Irvine High. 
</P>
<P>
The Sailors were trailing 15-0 in the second quarter and then scored the next 
24 points to improve their record to 5-1. University is 2-4 overall. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a little success early on in the season," Brinkley said. "Maybe it came 
too easy for our kids. But I think they learned their lesson, and we still won 
the ball game. Sometimes you learn your lessons and lose the ball game." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor's rally was keyed by tailback Todd Farley, who carried 25 times 
for 157 yards. Farley's 17-yard touchdown sprint in the third quarter was 
followed by a two-point conversion that tied the game at 15. 
</P>
<P>
Newport took the lead late in the quarter when quarterback Stephen Scheck (11 
of 17 for 120 yards) hit a wide-open Matt White for a 45-yard touchdown. 
Newport Harbor's first touchdown came on Ryan Abbey's 1-yard plunge just before 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
University had built its 15-0 lead on a 35-yard field goal by David Jacobson 
and two touchdown passes by Brian Vail (73 yards to wingback Victor Davis and 
six yards to Thad Machnikowski). The Trojans scored with 3:50 remaining in the 
game on Marc Walker's 1-yard run, but their final drive fell flat. 
</P>
<P>
Brinkley's halftime talk with his players might have sparked the Sailors' 
comeback. "I just told them that if we're gonna have a shot at a league 
championship, then we've got to make up an eight-point deficit," he said. "They 
responded." STUART MATTHEWS

IN DANA POINT, TAKING ON THE RITZ-CARLTON; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: QINTEX GROUP IS LOOKING AT A SMALLER, THOUGH PLUSHER, RESORT THAN 
PLANS ORIGINALLY CALLED FOR, BUT THE CITY HAS BIGGER IDEAS FOR ITS PRIME 
COASTLINE SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local governments hereabouts don't get many developers asking to build smaller 
buildings than the law allows. 
</P>
<P>
But it may happen in the beach town of Dana Point. And, in an ironic twist, the 
town will probably oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't just any construction project, either. At stake is one of the 
choicest pieces of real estate in California, a billion dollars or so and the 
reputation of a brash Australian financial wizard. 
</P>
<P>
The wiz is Christopher C. Skase, the dapper chairman of Qintex Group, the 
Australian hotel and television conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex recently paid a king's ransom for the Dana Point land, where Hawaii 
resort developer Christopher B. Hemmeter had planned a huge, gaudy resort. Now 
Qintex says it has scrapped Hemmeter's plan. Instead it plans to build a 
smaller, plusher resort to compete directly with the Ritz-Carlton just up the 
road, which caters almost exclusively to the carriage trade. 
</P>
<P>
But the town of Dana Point may not want a smaller hotel, which could mean less 
revenue from a room tax and more residential development. 
</P>
<P>
And as Qintex's other big U.S. deal falls apart -- the purchase of the MGM/UA 
movie studio at a price some analysts considered way too high -- it raises 
questions about Qintex's financial ability to become a big player in the U.S. 
entertainment and leisure industry. Qintex insists the apparent failure of the 
studio deal won't affect the resort. 
</P>
<P>
But both deals are similar in one way: The resort deal is almost as complicated 
as the intricate MGM/UA deal. And if a fight develops between Dana Point and 
Qintex over the size of the hotel, for instance, it could take a lot longer -- 
and a lot more money -- to get the hotel built. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Point, at first blush, suggests nothing of high finance. It used to be a 
sleepy little beach town known for funky neighborhoods, cheap apartments and 
good surfing. 
</P>
<P>
The surfing is still good. But Dana Point is known now as a place where a lot 
for a single house near the ocean can sell for several million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Blamed 
</P>
<P>
The town began changing in 1971, when a yacht harbor opened. Some of the 
resulting growth wasn't planned very well. The town folk blamed the five county 
supervisors 20 miles or so up the freeway in Santa Ana. Last year they'd had 
enough: They voted to incorporate and take control. 
</P>
<P>
But developers managed to persuade the county supervisors to approve 1,700 new 
homes before the incorporation. (This in a town of 28,000.) So no matter where 
you go in Dana Point these days, you are never far from the skeletal frames of 
new houses and the drumbeat of hammers. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest change, though, is the hotels. There are two of them perched on the 
bluffs above the ocean: the marble-laden Ritz-Carlton and the less stuffy Dana 
Point Resort. 
</P>
<P>
With the hotels and the tourists and the construction and the bustle, the town 
is beginning to seem less like the funky beach town it once was and more like 
its trendy neighbors just up the coast: artsy-craftsy Laguna Beach and glitzy 
Newport Beach with its yachts and socialites. 
</P>
<P>
It had to happen eventually: Dana Point was the closest place to Los Angeles 
that still had lots of empty land for sale right on the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Drive south down the coast from Los Angeles County and the first big open space 
that's not already spoken for is just behind Dana Point's Monarch Beach, 
namely, 232 empty acres on a bluff overlooking the Pacific. It is, says 
Christopher B. Hemmeter, a man with an eye for choice real estate, "one of the 
best pieces of land in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First on California Coast 
</P>
<P>
Hemmeter should know; he has made a mint picking good spots, most of them in 
Hawaii, on which to put hotels. This was to be his first on the California 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
It was 1987 when Hemmeter joined two local developers, David Stein and Barry 
Brief, to build one of Hemmeter's elaborate resorts. (Stein-Brief Group owned 
the land, and Stein-Brief and Hemmeter paid Stein-Brief's lender just $32 
million to obtain the land free and clear less than two years ago.) 
</P>
<P>
The hotel was to be a copy of William Randolph Hearst's grandiose castle in San 
Simeon. The old press lord probably would have liked the frills Hemmeter 
planned: a water ride through a Japanese garden, a theater big enough to stage 
an opera and an ice-skating rink. 
</P>
<P>
The partners needed $450 million to build it. They hired an investment banker 
to find an investor who would put in $150 million in return for 50% of the 
hotel. The group would then borrow the other $300 million, according to David 
Stein. 
</P>
<P>
The investment banker brought them Skase, and Skase surprised everyone by 
offering to buy the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked what price I'd accept," Hemmeter says. "I told them our bankers 
wouldn't let us turn down $100 million more than what we paid for it. They came 
back with an offer of $132 million. We couldn't turn it down." 
</P>
<P>
Qintex had paid a stiff price, and almost all of it in cash, a source said. On 
the other hand, it was no longer a junior partner. Now that it had gotten rid 
of Hemmeter, it could design any sort of hotel it wanted. And it was in a 
position to go out and find investors to risk their own cash in return for just 
a minority interest in the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
If Qintex can make its new hotel a going concern, it will look like a pretty 
smart deal. If the hotel is a bust, however, it could put a serious dent in 
Qintex's plans to become a major operator of resorts in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of gamble is not unusual for Skase, 41, the nattily attired former 
stockbroker and business reporter. He is regarded by admirers as something of a 
precocious genius, a man who according to Qintex lore became a millionaire 
while still in his 20s. Skase took the Brisbane-based company from practically 
nothing to $2 billion a year in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Produced "Lonesome Dove" 
</P>
<P>
Besides the MGM deal, Qintex is probably best known in the states for producing 
"Lonesome Dove," the hit television miniseries. But it has also built two big 
Australian resorts, acquired an Australian television network and bought a 
Hawaiian resort. 
</P>
<P>
Not, however, without detractors. Qintex stock has languished until recent 
months, when the problems with the MGM/UA deal sent it plummeting from $1.50 
Australian to the 40-cent range; even before MGM/UA, the company had a 
propensity to scare off investors by running up heavy debt. "The stock's 
performed dismally," says Brad Orgill, an analyst for S.G. Warburg &amp; Co. in 
Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
It was the film business that first lured Qintex to America. After picking up a 
small company, Qintex went big time: It outbid another Australian tycoon, 
Rupert Murdoch, for MGM/UA. That deal was to cost Skase a hefty $1.5 billion. 
But last week MGM/UA backed out and accused Skase of missing a September 
deadline for delivering a $50 million letter of credit. Qintex accused MGM/UA 
of queering the deal by continuing to make exorbitant demands after the deal 
was closed. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson, of course, is that glamorous stuff like resorts and movie studios 
don't come cheap. 
</P>
<P>
But at first it's hard to see what's so glamorous about Dana Point. It is, 
after all, a nice little town. But it's not Hawaii or Tahiti. 
</P>
<P>
The answer, oddly enough, is back in Hawaii: The place is overrun with resorts. 
There aren't many suitable spots left on which to build a new one. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Searching the Globe 
</P>
<P>
So resort developers fan out over the globe looking for likely locations. One 
of the likeliest is Southern California, since it comes with its own enormous, 
ready-made market. 
</P>
<P>
After some rocky years, the success of the Ritz-Carlton -- which is celebrating 
its fifth anniversary -- showed a resort hotel could work in Orange County. The 
Ritz-Carlton is one reason everybody with a piece of coastal property in the 
county is building a hotel these days. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson hasn't been lost on Qintex, either. In fact, now that Qintex has 
tossed out Hemmeter's Hawaiian fantasy, Qintex executives say they want to 
build the kind of resort they're more comfortable with, the kind they run in 
Australia and which they compare -- with a little exaggeration, say experts -- 
to the Ritz-Carlton. 
</P>
<P>
There's just one small problem: The land Qintex bought is approved for two 
adjacent hotels, an 800-room behemoth and a 300-room building. Together, they 
would be one of the largest hotels on the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
That's a perfect size for Hemmeter's waterfalls, ponds and opera house. But it 
is too big and impersonal to have the same cachet as the Ritz-Carlton. With 
only 393 rooms and 850 employees, the Ritz-Carlton boasts better than two 
employees per room and the sort of service that keeps the Dom Perignon cold and 
the towels hot for its rich, pampered guests. The hotel is, in fact, Dana 
Point's largest employer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extremely Expensive 
</P>
<P>
When Skase told The Times in July at the time of the land sale that his hotel 
would be less than 1,000 rooms, he was apparently thinking about the 
Ritz-Carlton and this fact of hotel economics: In order to make a profit, a 
hotel needs to charge $1 in room rates for every $1,000 it costs to build the 
room. Qintex's hotel will be extremely expensive since Qintex paid such a 
princely sum for the land. So the hotel will have to be very posh indeed to 
justify the steep room rates it will need to charge. 
</P>
<P>
There are other advantages to a smaller hotel, advantages that may also be 
crucial if the resort is to make money on all that expensive land. A smaller 
hotel might leave Qintex more room to build condominiums and houses around the 
resort. Qintex says it is considering this. And well it should: They would be 
extremely profitable to build. You can charge a lot more for houses when they 
are near a resort or close to a golf course, and there is a golf course already 
operating on the property. 
</P>
<P>
Selling high-priced houses could also defray the costs of buying the land and 
tide the hotel over its first -- and probably unprofitable -- years. Qintex 
already builds homes at its two Australian resorts. If you don't want to use 
your villa -- as Qintex calls condos -- year-round, the hotel will rent them to 
guests for you. 
</P>
<P>
But over at Dana Point's tiny City Hall -- a trailer where city officials wait 
for their new rented offices to be finished -- the notion of more houses and a 
smaller hotel sets off alarms. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: Fewer hotel rooms mean less revenue from the city's 8% room tax. 
The Hemmeter hotel, by some estimates, would have brought in a cool $5 million 
to $6 million a year. That's terribly appealing to a town that takes in less 
than $10 million a year and which -- until little less than a year ago -- 
depended on the largess of county government for its public services. 
</P>
<P>
Another worry is traffic. New houses would probably generate as much traffic as 
a resort hotel, where at least the guests stay put, and it might generate more. 
Irate residents have killed projects they thought created too much traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Stein and Hemmeter spent months haggling with the county, the state Coastal 
Commission and now the new city government for approval to build their hotel. 
Getting a change could take Skase more months -- perhaps years -- and lots more 
money, which Qintex says it realized going into the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Because residents don't want the traffic from new housing, "there'll be major 
resistance if Qintex decides to downscale the hotel or put houses on that 
land," says City Manager William O. Talley. 
</P>
<P>
Eileen Krause, the town's new mayor, is a little more conciliatory. She 
wouldn't mind a smaller hotel, she says, but not if that means making room for 
more houses. 
</P>
<P>
Some town folk say they are starting to get nervous because Qintex has yet to 
announce definite plans for the Hemmeter land and another parcel just down the 
road. (Qintex says it will have an announcement within 90 days.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Headlands Property 
</P>
<P>
That other piece of land is 115 acres on the Dana Point headlands a quarter of 
a mile down the coast, for which Qintex paid another $115 million. The 
headlands is a stunning piece of property, but "a very emotional one for the 
town," says a city planner. 
</P>
<P>
A town landmark, the headlands was empty when 19th-Century novelist Richard 
Henry Dana first sailed by in 1835 and mentioned it in "Two Years Before the 
Mast." (The town later borrowed his name.) Most of the headlands has remained 
empty since. Whatever goes up there is sure to be unpopular with at least some 
town folk. A fence across the property is routinely breached by surfers and 
other locals with a proprietary interest in this stretch of coast. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler-Sherman Corp., the old owner, had persuaded the county to zone the 
land for quite a few townhouses and two hotels. But as yet nobody holds a 
permit to actually build anything. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex actually went after this piece of property before the Hemmeter property, 
but buying both may have been smart: Since the two properties are tied 
together, any improvements Qintex makes to the Hemmeter property -- like the 
planned upgrading of the golf course there -- enhances the value of the houses 
it builds down the road at the headlands. 
</P>
<P>
What seems likely to happen, Qintex says, is this: The company will ask to 
build an extremely lavish -- if smaller -- hotel on the Hemmeter property and 
build mostly houses and condominiums -- and possibly another small hotel -- on 
the headlands, still close enough to the resort for residents to use the golf 
course, restaurants and other amenities. 
</P>
<P>
But then there's this last small problem: Where are these new hotels going to 
find enough guests? 
</P>
<P>
A waterfront hotel is going up in Huntington Beach and -- within the next few 
years -- on the Irvine Co. property between Newport Beach and Laguna Beach. 
Within a few years, there will be thousands of new hotel rooms on a stretch of 
coast that until five years ago had none. Some experts expect at least a 
temporary glut. 
</P>
<P>
And some are skeptical that the Orange County coast will attract tourists from 
all over the world. "As Orange County continues to urbanize, who wants to come 
to a smoggy and congested part of the country for a vacation?" asks Christopher 
B. Leinberger of real estate consultants Robert Charles Lesser &amp; Co. The 
real money to be made in those hotels, then, is likely to be from conventions 
and business conferences. Resort hotels are so expensive to build these days 
that most of them can't rely on tourists to return their owners' investment: 
They have to scramble for convention business too. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Ritz-Carlton, which by all accounts has made a roaring success 
catering to the rich, says it makes a lot of its money from mundane business 
meetings. And when the Irvine Co.'s first hotel -- a 1,100-room Marriott -- 
opens up the coast in 1993, it will have a big advantage over almost everyone 
else: It will be only minutes from John Wayne Airport, an obvious attraction to 
people who book conventions. 
</P>
<P>
But Qintex's hotel may have an advantage too, a little something called rich 
Japanese investors. Although no announcement has been made yet, the Japanese 
are likely to be big investors in the resort, sources said. The Japanese can 
borrow money in Japan at lower interest rates and thus can invest a lot for a 
rate of return that looks piddling by U.S. standards. That means that while the 
sums they pay for hotels and golf courses and office buildings seem 
astronomical and unprofitable from the U.S. point of view, Japanese buyers can 
still make a decent profit because they borrowed money at such low rates. 
</P>
<P>
And there are cultural differences too, which mean Japanese investors won't be 
pressing Qintex for a quick score: They're often willing to take a small return 
now in exchange for a big payoff down the road if, for instance, the hotel is 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Japanese who bailed Qintex out when it got top-heavy with debt from 
building its two Australian resorts and buying the Princeville resort in 
Hawaii. Skase sold 49% of the three resorts to consumer credit company Nippon 
Shinpan Co. and the trading concern Mitsui and Co. As part of that deal, both 
got first crack at buying 49% of the Dana Point hotel and, given the enthusiasm 
of Japanese investors for resorts and golf courses, there is a good chance they 
will take it. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese like hotels and resorts because -- when inflation's running high 
-- you don't have to wait for a lease to expire before you can raise prices. 
Tokyo Masuiwaya, Japan's biggest maker of kimonos, bought the nearby Dana Point 
Resort in July for $104 million from Edward and Thomas Slatkin, who walked away 
with $40 million more than they paid for the hotel last year. 
</P>
<P>
At the nearby Ritz-Carlton, however -- where rooms start at $185 a night and 
run up to $2,000 for a suite with a study, grand piano and fireplace -- the 
management professes not to be worried by the prospect of competition from 
Qintex. 
</P>
<P>
"A five-star hotel is not just marble and crystal," sniffs Henry E. Schielein, 
the Ritz-Carlton's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
"They still have to prove they can do it. And I won't lose sleep over it until 
I see something happen."
