Woodpeckers can be a problem for cities -- their penchant for boring holes in 
telephone poles is especially destructive -- so it seems curious that the 
County Board of Supervisors would name Woody Woodpecker as the mascot of the 
county's recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
You can almost hear Woody's malicious laugh . . . 
</P>
<P>
Heh, heh, heh, hee, hah. Heh, heh, heh, hee, hah. Hah, hah, hah . . .

 Obviously, he was approved without a confirmation hearing.

L.A.'s in no danger of losing its title as the capital of dual-purpose, 
unmarried groups, offering such combinations as the Millionaire Singles Club, 
the Atheist Dating Service, the Southern California Freeway Singles and 
Vege-Match of Redondo Beach (vegetarian sunbather singles). 
</P>
<P>
Now comes another variation: Comedy Singles Night in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
No joke. 
</P>
<P>
Unmarried quipsters who've resisted trying out their best lines in singles' 
bars are invited to the Twenty/20 Club on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have single amateurs do comedy routines," said Robert Kohn, 
chairman of the nonprofit event, which is being sponsored by the Century City 
Chamber of Commerce. Tickets go for $5 per funnyman or funnywoman. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone will get to perform. But Kohn said that, as a get-acquainted 
gimmick, each attendee will be given a name tag of a partner of a famous comedy 
team and asked to match up with the other member. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have tags for Burns and Allen, Lucy and Ricky, and others," Kohn 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Don't forget Zsa Zsa and The Cop.

State Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) shocked some people with his proposal

<P>
Most everyone favors a crackdown on rowdies at the Coliseum, but Art Grandy of 
Gardena wonders if some gendarmes are overreacting. 
</P>
<P>
Grandy said that at the Raiders-Seattle game Sunday, an L.A. policeman warned 
him not to stand up and cheer or wave his Seahawks hat. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in a section of Raiders' fans and it was a fine group of people," said 
Grandy, whose godson plays for Seattle. "No one had been doing any drinking or 
anything like that. And I hadn't had much chance to stand up because it was 
early on when the Seahawks were really getting beat. Raiders fans were doing a 
lot more standing up. I asked the officer what I was doing wrong and he said, 
'You're making a lot of noise and you're going to cause a problem. . . . If you 
wave that hat again, I'm gonna take you to jail.' " 
</P>
<P>
Grandy added: "I'm 57. How much noise can I make?" 
</P>
<P>
The show never stops in L.A., notes Steve Holley of West L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"As I left the Royal Theater after viewing 'Jesus of Montreal,' a film in which 
an avant-garde Passion Play is censored by the Catholic Church and closed down 
by the police, I was greeted by eight protesters kneeling on the sidewalk," he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"In unison, they participated in a droning chant, indicting the film as 
blasphemous and sure to send us all to Hades. Funny, that's the same thing the 
antagonists in the movie were saying." 
</P>
<P>
Which reminds us:

OUTGOING ZOO DIRECTOR BLASTS A RANGE OF CRITICS; 
</P>
<P>
GRIFFITH PARK: HE TAKES NO BLAME FOR PROBLEMS AT THE FACILITY, WHICH HE SAYS 
HAS BEEN 'UNJUSTIFIABLY PILLORIED AND PERSECUTED.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a defiant speech to his superiors Monday, departing Los Angeles Zoo Director 
Warren D. Thomas lashed out at city officials, federal inspectors, the Greater 
Los Angeles Zoo Assn., the press and critics, taking no responsibility for 
problems that prompted him to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas told the city's Recreation and Parks Commission, which oversees the 
Griffith Park facility, that the zoo has been "unjustifiably pilloried and 
persecuted" over the last month. 
</P>
<P>
"It does no good for them to sit down here at City Hall and call shots for us 
out in the trenches when they have no frame of reference," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that alleged violations of the U.S. Animal Welfare Act cited at the 
zoo over more than three years "were basically minuscule" and questioned the 
expertise of the U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors who had threatened 
legal action against the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, 59, resigned 10 days ago amid allegations of chronic deficiencies and 
fiscal improprieties at the zoo. Officials said he resigned because of damage 
to the zoo's reputation and his own. 
</P>
<P>
His resignation was announced just hours before City Controller Rick Tuttle 
released an audit that concluded Thomas had violated several City Charter 
provisions in his operation of a special fund into which he deposited $78,003 
in city money without his superiors' knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had begun to examine Thomas' management of the zoo last month, 
after The Times reported that the facility had been cited repeatedly by the 
Agriculture Department for more than three years. The citations listed such 
alleged violations as inadequate food storage, sanitation and drainage 
problems, pest and rodent contamination, inadequate housing and run-down animal 
barns. 
</P>
<P>
The Times also reported that Thomas did not reply to a letter sent by the 
Agriculture Department nearly a year ago demanding an immediate response to the 
list of allegations. 
</P>
<P>
In his remarks Monday, Thomas said The Times account was "a sensationalized 
story which was calculated to scandalize and damage." 
</P>
<P>
"It is incredible to me that these charges were made and printed in the paper 
and virtually no one visited the zoo or asked the zoo staff to explain exactly 
what these charges meant, their importance and what caused them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Turner, metropolitan editor of The Times, replied: "The Times' articles 
on the zoo situation were carefully researched and balanced. Moreover, the 
reporter sought and received comment from city officials, including Mr. Thomas 
himself, on all criticism leveled at the zoo." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas seemed to reserve his sharpest criticism for the Greater Los Angeles Zoo 
Assn., the nonprofit organization that raises funds for and helps run the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas accused the association of meddling in the operation of the zoo and said 
it has "never understood (its) role as a support group." 
</P>
<P>
"Their aim has always been to protect themselves and their reputation -- often 
at the city's expense -- with the ultimate goal of finally taking over the 
zoo," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The association should stop trying to "micro-manage" the zoo, he said, and 
instead concentrate on raising funds and operating the concession stands. 
</P>
<P>
He accused zoo association members of "promoting their own egocentric 
aggrandizement in the community," but did not specify in what manner this was 
done. 
</P>
<P>
During the session, the commission listened to Thomas' speech and did not 
attempt to ask questions. When he left, Thomas refused to answer a reporter's 
questions about the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas R. Tellefsen, chairman of the zoo association's executive committee, 
said Monday that Thomas' accusations "really have nothing to do with the matter 
at hand, which is that he did not deal with an issue that arose in the manner 
that he should have." 
</P>
<P>
Tellefsen added that the remarks indicate that the next few months will be a 
difficult period for the management of the zoo because Thomas will remain in 
charge until January. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have hoped or thought there would have been a lot more sensitivity to 
the morale of the zoo staff and of the (zoo association's) staff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the special fund he established, called the Zoo Emergency Fund, 
Thomas said during his speech that it was made necessary by the city's 
"inefficient" bureaucracy, which could not react quickly enough to his requests 
for money for zoo projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Had there been effective financial procedures set up for handling everyday 
crises . . . there would have been no need for the Zoo Emergency Fund," he 
said. "Whether right or wrong," he added, "the Zoo Emergency Fund was set up to 
deal expeditiously with a spectrum of things." 
</P>
<P>
According to the city controller's audit, Thomas established the fund with the 
zoo association in 1987 with money collected from companies that paid fees for 
use of the zoo grounds. The money should have gone to the city treasury, the 
audit said. Less than half of the money was spent, most of it apparently for 
equipment and other zoo expenses. 
</P>
<P>
However, the auditors questioned a $17,000 advance Thomas took to pay for a 
trip to Ethiopia this year and city officials said Monday they may attempt to 
recover some of the money. Zoo association officials have said that, until 
June, they believed city officials had authorized the account.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RAIDERS FAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Raiders fan pleaded not guilty Monday to charges that he beat and 
seriously injured a Pittsburgh Steelers fan in an attack at the Coliseum that 
sparked tighter security at the stadium and a one-game beer ban. 
</P>
<P>
Shane C. Geringer, 19, of Agoura Hills, appearing in Municipal Court for 
arraignment, pleaded not guilty to one count each of assault with a deadly 
weapon and battery causing serious bodily injury, both felonies. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Candace Beason allowed him to remain free on $30,000 bail and ordered him 
to return to court on Nov. 19 for a preliminary hearing. Each charge carries a 
maximum four-year state prison term upon conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Geringer, accompanied to court by his parents and defense attorney Leslie 
Abramson, declined to comment. He was baited by at least one bystander, who 
shouted out, "Want a beer?" 
</P>
<P>
Abramson described Geringer as "a fanatic Raiders fan" who has had a drinking 
problem since age 13.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN ON TRIAL IN MURDER DESCRIBED AS A 
VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman accused of helping a drifter kidnap two Chatsworth girls and kill one 
of them was forced at gunpoint to cooperate with the man, the woman's attorneys 
said in court Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Marsha Lynn Ramos was as much a victim of drifter Roland Norman Comtois as were 
the two girls, according to Alex R. Kessel, one of two attorneys representing 
Ramos in her San Fernando Superior Court trial on charges that include murder 
and kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
"All her actions were done at gunpoint by Mr. Comtois," Kessel said in his 
opening statement. "There's only one perpetrator, who has been put to justice, 
and that's Roland Comtois." 
</P>
<P>
Comtois, 60, was sentenced July 31 to the gas chamber after he was convicted of 
murder, attempted murder, kidnaping, attempted sodomy and other charges. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos is accused of luring Wendy Masuhara, 14, who was shot to death, and a 
13-year-old girl into Comtois' camper on Sept. 18, 1987.

DAUGHTER, GRANDSON HELD IN SLAYING OF WOMAN, 78 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A La Canada Flintridge woman found dead Sunday night was shot and killed by her 
daughter and 11-year-old grandson as she sought help by telephone after being 
stabbed, authorities alleged Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Family members said the slaying culminated more than two decades of mental 
instability by the daughter, who they said was diagnosed as a paranoid 
schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
Roma Jaul Jacobs, 78, dialed 911 around 6:50 p.m. from her home in the 
upper-middle-class community and told Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies 
that she had been stabbed. Officers taking the frantic call reported hearing 
gunshots in the background. 
</P>
<P>
By the time deputies arrived a few minutes later and forced their way into the 
ranch-style home in the 600 block of Durwood Drive, Jacobs was dead, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies discovered a woman dressed in combat fatigues and a boy clad in girl's 
clothing in the back yard. Deputies said they also found three firearms on the 
suspects and in nearby bushes. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the pair turned out to be the victim's daughter, Victoria 
Elizabeth Jacobs Madeira, 43, of Anaheim, and the victim's 11-year-old 
grandson, whose name was not released. Both were booked on suspicion of murder. 
The mother and son offered no resistance to arrest, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just standing there," said Sheriff's Lt. Robert Flores. "But they 
refused to talk, wouldn't say anything." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs' family said Madeira has aimed her aggression at the family for the last 
22 years, despite their efforts to help her. They said she has been 
institutionalized at times. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened here was a tragedy, a tragedy of this family and a tragedy of 
the failure of the mental health system," Brian Jacobs, the victim's son and 
Madeira's brother, said in a brief interview at the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs and other family members declined to discuss details of Madeira's 
history, but he testified Monday in Los Angeles before a state Senate panel on 
mental health and plans to appear in Sacramento today on the same subject to 
express his concerns about the system used to treat the mentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors, warned to stay inside Sunday night as deputies moved into the Jacobs 
house, watched from their homes as Madeira, handcuffed, was led quietly to a 
squad car. But her son slammed his head against the side of the vehicle and 
began screaming when his mother was taken away, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs, a homemaker who neighbors said had lived in the house for 35 years, had 
been stabbed and shot several times, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was apparent that she had been bleeding before she made the (911) call 
because the blood came from the kitchen door all the way to the phone," Flores 
said. "There was a lot of blood, and a lot of expended (bullet) rounds." 
</P>
<P>
"We have no motive yet," said Deputy Larry Mead. "That's what we'd like to find 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Samantha Kalmer, 15, who lives a few doors from the Jacobs home, said that 
about 6 p.m. she and a friend noticed a large woman in military fatigues and a 
large boy or man with closely cropped hair who appeared to be wearing gold 
earrings, women's makeup, a colorful blouse and silk pants. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was a girl," Kalmer said. "It looked very, very weird." 
</P>
<P>
Other neighbors recalled the boy wearing a dress and an orange wig. Police 
would say only that he had on "female clothing." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Jacobs' fiancee, Carla McLelland, said of the boy's attire: "That's just 
Betty and another one of the symptoms of her schizophrenia." 
</P>
<P>
Laura Gatkowski, who lives next door, was watching TV and said she did not 
believe it when guests in her home said they thought they heard shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard the 'bang, bang, bang,' " she said, "but I didn't know they were 
gunshots. I'd never heard gunshots before. I just couldn't believe it. It's 
scary to even think about." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Wolff, who lives next door to Jacobs and said his children visited the 
victim frequently. 
</P>
<P>
"She was such a sweet, wonderful person. This is the sort of person anyone 
would like for a grandmother," Wolff said. "How do you explain to a 4-year-old 
now that someone was murdered?"

JUDGE TO QUESTION CAMARENA JURORS ON OUTSIDE INFLUENCES; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: RAFEEDIE ORDERS A HEARING INTO ONE PANELIST'S CHARGES OF MISCONDUCT. THE 
CASE LED TO FOUR CONVICTIONS RELATED TO 1985 MURDER OF U.S. DRUG AGENT.

<P>
A federal judge in Los Angeles on Monday ordered a hearing into alleged 
misconduct during jury deliberations for four men accused in the 1985 kidnaping 
and murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie scheduled a hearing for Nov. 5 to determine 
if the deliberations had been tainted by outside influences. 
</P>
<P>
Rafeedie said the jurors definitely had been exposed to a July 27 article in 
The Times about one of the verdicts in the case, but he said it was uncertain 
what else they had read or seen or heard. All four defendants ultimately were 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is necessary to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine the 
precise nature of any extraneous information that reached the jury," Rafeedie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In August, defense lawyers asked Rafeedie to order a new trial based on a 
formal declaration by juror William Parris that other jurors had been exposed 
to news reports containing information that had not been introduced into 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Parris alleged that jurors had frequently ignored the judge's instructions to 
avoid news accounts of the trial. He said the jurors had discussed at length a 
news account that included criticisms of their first verdict. 
</P>
<P>
He also said a federal marshal, who served as a jury bailiff, had urged the 
panel to return a quick verdict on one defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors said in a written response, however, that Parris' 
statements were not credible because the juror earlier had told the judge that 
the verdicts had not been influenced by news reports. Prosecutors also asserted 
that Parris might hold a grudge against some of the other jurors because of 
disputes during deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, Ruben Zuno Arce and Juan Jose 
Bernabe Ramirez were convicted of conspiracy, kidnaping and violent crimes in 
aid of racketeering stemming from the February, 1985, abduction and murder of 
Camarena, an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration, in Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
Javier Vasquez Velasco was convicted of violent crimes in aid of racketeering 
in the murders on Jan. 30, 1985, of two men in Guadalajara who had been 
mistaken for DEA agents. Sentencings of the four defendants have been delayed 
because of the mistrial motion. 
</P>
<P>
The judge ordered attorneys not to speak to jurors or news reporters before 
next month's hearing. The session might be held behind closed doors, outside 
the presence of the news media, "to protect the jurors from a circus 
atmosphere," Rafeedie said. 
</P>
<P>
Rafeedie said he would question the jurors but would take suggested questions 
from the attorneys. He said he would ask the jurors about several topics that 
Parris said the jurors had discussed: 
</P>
<P>
* News reports regarding criticisms by defense lawyers of the jury's verdict on 
Matta, the first defendant convicted. 
</P>
<P>
* News reports that Matta had been sentenced to life in prison on a prior drug 
conviction and been characterized as a narcotics "kingpin." 
</P>
<P>
* The kidnaping of a Mexican doctor, a suspect in the Camarena murder, by men 
working with the DEA. 
</P>
<P>
* Allegations of corruption in the current Mexican government. 
</P>
<P>
* The convictions of three men in a 1988 trial in the Camarena case. 
</P>
<P>
If Rafeedie concludes that the jurors had been subjected to improper outside 
influences during deliberations, that could necessitate a new trial for one or 
more of the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he would ask Peggy Dolan, who replaced Parris as jury foreman 
during deliberations, whether she had said before the trial that she believed 
the defendants were guilty. Parris had alleged that Dolan made such a statement 
before they were sworn in as jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Rafeedie said he would order a new trial if he concludes that the information 
considered by the jury "had prejudiced (a) defendant to the extent that he has 
not received a fair trial."

PANEL ENDORSES $900,000 SETTLEMENT FOR COMATOSE BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $900,000 settlement was approved by a county panel Monday for an 11-year-old 
boy who has been comatose since February, 1985, when he climbed a fence at the 
San Fernando Swap Meet and was swept down a flood control channel. 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous decision, the three-member Los Angeles County Claims Board 
conceded that although the county made various repairs to the fences along the 
Pacoima Wash, dirt and debris left stacked near a fence at the swap meet made 
it easy to scale. As a procedural step, the settlement must be approved by the 
County Board of Supervisors and a Superior Court judge before it is final. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very tragic thing," said Louis V. Aguilar, principal deputy county 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
The insurer for swap meet owner William Hannon also recently agreed to pay $1 
million toward the cost of German Gonzales' 24-hour care, bringing the total 
settlement to $1.9 million, said Louis Dewitt, attorney for the Gonzales 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors have told Perfecto and Maria Gonzales, of South El Monte, that there is 
no chance their son will recover, DeWitt said, adding that German, then 5, was 
taken off a respirator about two weeks after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"They expected him to die immediately, as they were told by the doctors," 
DeWitt said. "They really said goodby. . . . But he just kept on." 
</P>
<P>
The family could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of the settlement was determined by estimating what it will cost to 
care for German for the rest of his life, which doctors say could last from 7 
to 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
German is being cared for at Fairview State Hospital in Costa Mesa. Past 
medical expenses were estimated by the county at $500,000; it costs an 
additional $7,000 per month for his standard care and occasional acute care for 
respiratory distress and infections. 
</P>
<P>
The outdoor swap meet, at 585 Glenoaks Blvd., San Fernando, caters to the 
northeast San Fernando Valley's large Latino population, selling everything 
from produce to clothes. 
</P>
<P>
The Gonzaleses had a booth selling fabric at the swap meet on Feb. 12, 1985. 
That day, while playing with a group of children, the boy apparently climbed 
the fence in a section used routinely by people to sneak into the swap meet, 
DeWitt said. 
</P>
<P>
German fell into the water at the base of the concrete-sided ditch where 
shallow water was running about 15 m.p.h., Aguilar said in his recommendation 
to the claims board. Rescuers found German within 10 minutes about two miles 
downstream. He was already comatose. 
</P>
<P>
The family sued for several million dollars in damages for their pain and 
suffering and for the boy's loss of earning capacity. The trial was postponed 
several times because of court backlogs, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
DeWitt said that he encouraged the family to accept the settlement amount 
because questions of parental negligence had been raised in a countersuit filed 
by Hannon's insurer. The attorney for the insurer, Jeffrey Zinder, declined 
comment but acknowledged that the insurer had settled with the family earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some problems with the case," DeWitt said. "The child was only 5 
years old and he was apparently left alone for about a half hour before the 
accident with no explanation." 
</P>
<P>
DeWitt said that once approved by the county board and the court, the 
$1.9-million settlement will be invested in annuities so that interest gains 
will match rising hospital costs.

SCHOOL REOPENS AFTER SOLVING ITS OIL CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Students returned to Park Avenue Elementary School in Cudahy on Monday, 15 
months after they were driven off the campus by pools of petroleum sludge that 
oozed from the ground beneath the playground. 
</P>
<P>
As their parents looked on cautiously, hundreds of children pranced across the 
newly covered playground, some stooping to touch the rough blue surface, others 
more interested in getting in a quick game of tag before the morning bell. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed this school every day we were gone," said 8-year-old Johanna Bonilla, 
who said she didn't like being bused to Teresa Hughes Elementary School. "Some 
kids there used to say, 'Park Avenue kids glow in the dark,' and they say we're 
contaminated." 
</P>
<P>
Her classmate Vanessa Garcia was happy to be back because "here, they give us 
sugar with our cornflakes." 
</P>
<P>
Since July of 1989, when the school was shut down, state and school officials 
have been working feverishly on the $2-million cleanup of the playground. 
</P>
<P>
Park Avenue school, at 8020 Park Ave., is located above an old dump. Several 
months ago, officials of the Los Angeles Unified School District, which 
includes Cudahy, identified at least 11 companies that they believe are 
responsible for the dumping. Pat Spencer, a district spokesman, said it is 
unknown whether the firms will be required to help pay for the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental firm hired by the district earlier this year determined that 
the petroleum-based waste was not harmful to the children unless they had 
prolonged, repeated and direct contact with it, but district officials decided 
not to reopen the school until the petroleum was either cleaned up or 
contained. 
</P>
<P>
After studying several options, an environmental task force of parents, 
teachers, and state, local and federal officials decided during the summer to 
cover the playground with a 10-inch-thick plastic liner. The liner was covered 
with gravel, sand and asphalt to keep the petroleum sludge from percolating to 
the surface. In addition to the liner, a gas ventilation system was installed 
throughout the playground and will be monitored each month for noxious fumes. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said the liner is temporary, though environmental 
consultants have said it could be used permanently. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Unified School District board member Leticia Quezada said a few 
more coatings of polyurethane will be applied. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is that the students and staff are back home, and 
their school is safe," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some parents were a little more cautious than Quezada. They said they thought 
the school was "pretty safe now" and they did not know how long it would last, 
but "it was great to be back." 
</P>
<P>
For years, dime-sized puddles of tarry ooze had marked the surface of the Park 
Avenue playground during hot months, but it was not until last year that 
teachers and parents expressed fear that the ooze might be harmful to the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
In an atmosphere of anger, fear and some hysteria, the school was shut down and 
the 1,100 students were divided between Teresa Hughes, Elizabeth Street School 
and Clara Street Primary Center. After 15 months, students and teachers said 
they were glad to be back. 
</P>
<P>
"My kids were getting up at 5:45 every day to catch the bus," said parent Sara 
Landeros, referring to the 15-month stretch when the children were bused 
elsewhere. "That's an eight-hour day for a kid. It's tough on them. I watched 
them work here, and I feel everything will be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Said fourth-grade teacher Cathy Ashdown: "I know it's corny, but there is no 
place like home. They were very hospitable at the other (schools), but we were 
visitors there. I think the leave made us appreciate what we had here at Park 
Avenue."

PEOPLE: PROF. GETS A BOOT OUT OF FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At times, chemistry and astronomy professor David M. Gray wears his hog nose, a 
Washington Redskins fan trademark, to show what a loyal Redskins fan, follower 
and hard-nosed football zealot he really is. 
</P>
<P>
So it only seemed right that he teach others, especially women, the unabashed 
joy of watching and understanding football, especially from an armchair. 
</P>
<P>
And they don't necessarily have to be Redskins fans, even though it would make 
him feel better. 
</P>
<P>
"Television was made to watch football," said Gray, who feels it would be a 
smart idea for couples to jointly attend classes to learn the ins and outs of 
gridiron watching. 
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate the game," said the Golden West College professor, who reveals to 
those in his recent three-meeting, two-hour Armchair Football class at the 
college that he has never played organized football. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago, it might have been a fantasy of mine to have played," said 
the Huntington Beach man who stands 5-foot-8. "I recognized I would never have 
survived." 
</P>
<P>
Those in his night non-college-credit class have fun homework assignments. 
</P>
<P>
The usual roster of 12 women were asked to watch weekend football games and see 
if they could recognize the things that were discussed in class. 
</P>
<P>
That includes the subtleties in the sport, such as individual player changes 
and defensive matchups. "It's also fun trying to anticipate different 
strategies and watching the different skill levels of the players," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When he taught in Georgia 20 years ago, Gray taught a similar class called 
Football for Football Widows, which would regularly attract 25 females. Most 
had abstained from watching football because they were unfamiliar with the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"Most women really don't have any type of understanding on how the game breaks 
down," he said. "It's like any other sport. If you don't understand the basic 
concepts, you really can't enjoy watching it." 
</P>
<P>
While the classes in Georgia and at Golden West College were geared to women, 
Gray feels the information that he imparts would help everyone better 
understand the game. "There are many men who don't understand it," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you every watched cricket?" asked the University of Mississippi graduate 
during the interview. "I tried to watch a few matches and had no idea what they 
were doing, and without someone to tell me what was going on, I stopped 
watching after a few minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Gray said women in the class tell him that their husbands watch football all 
the time and when the wives join in, they "are bored stiff (because) they don't 
understand what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line for women, he feels, is for them to get the knowledge of the 
game and watch it for their own enjoyment "and maybe offer some good insight to 
their male counterparts." 
</P>

SMOKERS LOSE AGAIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It seems that nonsmokers want to have it all their way. Twice, within one week, 
my friend and I -- both smokers -- went to lunch and had to put in our names to 
wait for a table in the smoking section. 
</P>
<P>
When we were told there was a 10-minute wait, I commented that I didn't know 
there were still that many smokers around. The hostess told me, "Oh, there are 
nonsmokers who will sit in either section." 
</P>
<P>
I told her that I felt the same say and that I'd sit in either section, too. Of 
course, that didn't work. Why are nonsmokers able to sit in smoking areas while 
smokers cannot sit in nonsmoking areas, particularly when they are the most 
vocal about "second-hand smoke"? 
</P>
<P>
My third incident of the week occurred in another restaurant where the smoking 
section is in the back of the cocktail lounge. One of the two men who were 
sitting in a back booth commented to me, "I suppose you're going to light up a 
cigarette now, huh?" I answered that it was the smoking section and he then 
told me, sarcastically, to wait until his food was delivered and then light up.

National swim team coaches from the United States, Hong Kong and Australia 
suspect the Chinese women's team of using steroids in the wake of China's 
world-best performances during last month's Asian Games. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Quick, coach of the U.S. national team and Stanford women's team, said 
he felt obligated to speak out after the Chinese produced three times that rank 
No. 1 in the world this year and three others that are No. 2 during the 
competition at Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"I got tired of whispering about it with the East Germans, and I'm not going to 
whisper about it with the Chinese," Quick said during the weekend. "I think 
they've improved very quickly. I know some coaches who have watched them, and 
their ability to recover in practice is phenomenal. It is either extremely 
sophisticated training with the proper nutrition and massage, or it is with 
artificial aids." 
</P>
<P>
Said Australia's national team coach, Bill Sweetenham, who worked with the 
Chinese as recently as February: "I hope they are not doing it (using 
steroids), but I question their rapid improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a very positive advocate of the Chinese, their strict discipline and the 
Spartan attitude toward their training. Their high-altitude training is very 
significant, as is the socialist system. You are dealing with people who have 
nothing, and all of a sudden if they perform well they get something." 
</P>
<P>
The suspicions have been fueled by the quick improvement of the Chinese 
performances and what the coaches consider a familiar pattern. "It seems like 
we're seeing the same rapid improvement the East Germans had, and they (the 
Chinese) had help from the East Germans," said Sweetenham, Australia's Olympic 
coach from 1980-88. 
</P>
<P>
According to Coach David Haller, whose Hong Kong national team swam against the 
Chinese during the Asian Games, the Chinese women have made significant weight 
gains and developed deep voices. Those are common side effects of steroids, 
muscle-building drugs that some consider to be performance-enhancing. 
</P>
<P>
China's national team coach, Yunpeng Chen, denied the allegations from Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"Never," Chen said. "In China, our swimming association forbids it, and you 
know at the Asian Games we have serious doping control." 
</P>
<P>
None of the Chinese swimmers tested positive for any banned substance at the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Chen said his team has had East German help. East German Coach Klaus Rudolf 
went to China in 1986 for eight months to share training techniques. Chen also 
learned from the Americans during 1979-80 when he studied at Springfield 
College in Massachusetts, and from the Australians in 1983 when he observed 
Coach Dennis Pursley's methods. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned a lot about the East German system of weight training, high-altitude 
training, dry-land and aquatic training," Chen said. "Then I mixed the 
Australian, U.S.A. and East German training methods to make the Chinese 
method." 
</P>
<P>
Pursley, because of his current position as U.S. national team director, would 
not address the question of steroids with regard to the Chinese. However, he 
did attend the Asian Games and was willing to share his views of the Chinese 
program, which Chen said has about 25,000 swimmers. The Chinese population is 
estimated at 1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that really surprised me is that they really haven't scratched the 
surface," Pursley said. "They have a small number of swimmers and they don't 
have sophisticated talent identification or networking methods." 
</P>
<P>
In a report Pursley prepared for U.S. Swimming, he wrote: "It doesn't appear 
that the success of the Chinese program can be attributed to any 'secret' 
training methods that are unknown to the rest of the world. The training 
program is based on a solid work ethic and utilizes traditional methods of 
preparation." 
</P>
<P>
Quick also credits the Chinese training, saying that the swimmers could not 
improve on artificial aids alone. 
</P>
<P>
"The major benefit from steroids is that you can train so much more effectively 
so many more times," he said. "So you can get off them in time before the 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
Quick added that female swimmers benefit from steroids more than males. 
</P>
<P>
"And (improvement) has come in the power events first, the shorter events, the 
100s, and then the 200s," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Voy, former chief medical officer of the U.S. Olympic Committee, 
gives credence to Quick's belief that steroids have a greater impact on women. 
</P>
<P>
"Women have male hormone receptor sites that require very little male hormone 
to fill," Voy said. "They can get that by using smaller doses and getting 
bigger gains." 
</P>
<P>
Chen, however, offered several reasons for the success of the women as opposed 
to the men, including the belief that the fastest women can train against 
faster men while the fastest men have no one to push them. 
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the average height of Chinese women is only an inch 
shorter, at 5 feet 8, than the average height of female finalists in the 1988 
Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
He says the average height of the Chinese male swimmer is 5-11, three inches 
shorter than the average height of male Olympic finalists in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
With regard to power events, the only world record the Chinese women have is in 
the shortest event, the 50-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Wenyi Yang, who set the mark at 24.98 seconds in 1988, has gone as fast as 
25.51 this year and is one of five Chinese women with world-best times in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The others are: Yong Zhuang in the 100 freestyle (55.12), Xiaomin Huang in the 
100 breaststroke (1:09.70), Xiaohong Wang in the 100 butterfly (58.87) and Li 
Lin in the 200 individual medley (2:13.16). Wang's time and the 58.89 turned in 
by teammate Hong Qian represent the second- and third-fastest times in history 
behind the world record of 57.93 set by Mary T. Meagher of the United States in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has seven individual world bests this year -- four by

100 backstroker Betsy Mitchell. This year's other bests are by Hungarian 200 
backstroker Kristina Egerszegi and 200 breaststroker Elena Volkova of the 
Soviet Union.

Quick fears steroid users will not be caught through the testing procedures at 
the World Championships or the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
One former member of the East German women's team acknowledged in a Toronto Sun 
article recently that she used steroids and said that many of her teammates 
used the banned substances, but none of the swimmers tested positive during 
competition. During the U.S. Olympic trials in 1988, Angel Myers tested 
positive for a banned substance and was taken off the team, but those cases are 
generally the exception. 
</P>
<P>
Said Voy: "Only someone who misjudges a dose or gets greedy and takes too much, 
a la Ben Johnson, is going to get caught. With an eight- to 10-week cycle they 
can get off within two weeks of the competition date and still get a lot of the 
positive effects of the drug."

MT. CARMEL DOMINATES N.Y. RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
They had to raise more than $10,000 to make the trip. Once there, they had to 
deal with inclement weather, a new course and a 28-team field. 
</P>
<P>
But the Mt. Carmel girls exceeded their No. 9 national ranking by defeating No. 
3 Palos Verdes to win the Eastern States Championship race Saturday at the 18th 
annual Manhattan College Cross Country Invitational at Van Courtland Park in 
New York City. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Sundevils' first appearance at the invitational, which, with more 
than 8,000 runners, is the largest cross country race east of the Mississippi 
River. 
</P>
<P>
The day before the race, it rained three inches, but the Sundevils negotiated 
the soaked 2 1/2-mile course and finished with 100 points. Palos Verdes had 
114. 
</P>
<P>
Six Sundevils finished in top 30, led by sixth-place Susan Scott with a time of 
15:52. Other finishers were Rita Hermiz (19th), Jennifer Vergith (21th), 
Charaighn Foss (26th), Marcia Larson (28th) and Kathleen Carl (29th). 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge of going out there in a foreign environment with a different 
layout and in the rain is a real positive, rewarding thing," Mt. Carmel Coach 
Dennis McClanahan said. "The girls, how they ran, is probably one of the better 
days we've ever had. They dominated everything." 
</P>
<P>
McClanahan's request to enter two varsity teams was denied, so he had one team 
in the first of two junior varsity races and then entered the two remaining 
girls in the second race. Mt. Carmel won the first junior varsity race by 50 
points by placing all six runners in the top nine. The Sundevils' Sara Smith 
won in 17:24. In the other JV race, the two Sundevils entered placed first and 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona was picked by every Avocado League coach to win the league, but now it's 
struggling just to make the playoffs. After being shut out, 41-0, Friday by El 
Camino, the Bulldogs are 3-3 overall and 1-2 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona, which had 17 of 22 starters returning from a team that last year 
advanced to the 2-A semifinals, has lost two consecutive games since assistant 
coach Jack Campbell was suspended indefinitely for directing a practice drill 
that resulted in a player suffering a shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino coach Herb Meyer, one of many who jumped on the Ramona bandwagon 
before the season, offered his perspective on what has gone wrong with the 
Bulldogs: "I'm sure there's been some chaos over the coaching situation. 
Outsiders don't understand how much that can affect a program. Another one of 
the major problems is, it's hard to be as good as everybody expects you to be. 
When you read all those great things about you in the paper, it makes it real 
hard to get your kids to focus." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer also said Ramona's line, which averaged 250 pounds, might have been 
overrated.: "When you start getting gigantic size, it really cuts down on your 
mobility. We watched them against San Marcos. That kind of size in high school, 
unless that person is a tremendous individual, can be offset by quickness." 
</P>
<P>
There will be a plot within a plot when La Jolla (5-1) meets Kearny (5-1) at 7 
p.m. Friday at Mesa College in a football game many believe will determine the 
City Western League. That's because La Jolla running back E.J. Watson, the 
county leader in touchdowns with 17, and Kearny's Darnay Scott, who led the 
county with 13 touchdown receptions last season, will be on the same field. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, a receiver/kick returner whose explosive speed has produced 11 
touchdowns and attracted Division I college recruiters, met Watson two years 
ago after Scott moved from St. Louis to Clairemont. Scott, a senior, quickly 
grabbed the spotlight over his neighbor last year, compiling 903 receiving 
yards for a 20.1-yard average. Now this may be Watson's year. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't wait to play against him," Watson said of Scott. "It's going to be 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista's Markeith Ross rushed for three touchdowns against Torrey 
Pines on Friday, giving him 15 for the year and a San Diego Section-record 58 
for his career, eclipsing the previous record of 56 by Sweetwater's Terry 
Rodgers (1983-85). 
</P>
<P>
Ross was a slow starter this season. He didn't rush for a touchdown until the 
fourth game of the season, when he scored a Section-record seven times against 
Poway. 
</P>
<P>
Through six games, he has gained 1,079 yards, but 761 of those have come in the 
past three Palomar League games.

THE PREPS: CALIFORNIA HIGH HAS CERTAIN AIR, THANKS TO HANEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California High in Whittier has only a 2-4 record in football, but junior 
quarterback Larry Haney has gained notice with his passing statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Haney is leading quarterbacks in the Southern Section with an average of 254.4 
yards passing per game. In six games, he has completed 131 of 223 passes for 
1,526 yards and 18 touchdowns, and in last week's 34-31 double-overtime loss to 
Whittier High, he passed for 285 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Haney passed for 1,563 yards in his first year as starting 
quarterback under Coach Tom Tereschuk. Despite learning a new offense, Haney 
showed signs of promise with his mobility and passing touch. 
</P>
<P>
"We run a one-back offense that features a lot of high percentage underneath 
passes," said Tereschuk, in his second year as coach at California. "We try to 
control the ball with our passing and Haney is the person in control. He has 
improved tremendously from his sophomore year." 
</P>
<P>
Haney, 6 feet 2, is as smooth as they come in operating the Condors' passing 
offense, but said he was surprised by his passing ranking. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think that I'd be so high in the rankings," Haney said. "Even though 
we are passing more than last year, our offense is pretty easy. It is basically 
a run-and-shoot offense that doesn't throw the ball downfield that often." 
</P>
<P>
Haney's best statistical game this season came in a 44-43 loss to Whittier 
Christian, when he passed for 315 yards and six touchdowns. He has learned to 
spread the ball around to his receivers, with five of them having double 
figures in catches. Toby Whickoff leads with 41 receptions and 10 touchdowns, 
followed by Paul Martinez, who has 30 catches. 
</P>
<P>
"I just get the job done because I don't have that strong of an arm," said 
Haney, who ran the 400-meter dash on the track team last spring along with 
playing in the outfield for the baseball team. "Every week I feel that I'm 
improving. For one thing, I stay in the pocket a lot better than I used to and 
that has helped." 
</P>
<P>
Hacienda Heights Los Altos Coach Dwayne DeSpain entered this season only four 
away from his 200th victory. It seemed like a sure bet considering that Los 
Altos has appeared in the playoffs the past 18 seasons, a Southern Section 
record, and has won seven Southern Section titles. 
</P>
<P>
However, after winning their first two games of the season, the Conquerors have 
had problems, losing three of four games, including last Friday's 35-15 defeat 
by Nogales. 
</P>
<P>
"I really haven't thought about (the 200th win)," said DeSpain, who has a 
199-67-4 record in his 24 seasons coaching. "It is not something that the team 
is concerned about this season. We're not sitting here crying over spilled 
milk, but we're not as good as we've been in years past." 
</P>
<P>
So, when does DeSpain think he'll get his 200th victory? 
</P>
<P>
"It might not come," DeSpain said laughing. "It is just one of those things 
where we are getting overmatched, but we've still got a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Claremont Coach Bob Baiz gained his 210th victory and his 100th at Claremont 
when the Wolfpack defeated previously unbeaten Glendora, 14-7, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
After trailing, 7-3, at halftime, Claremont received a major break midway 
through the third quarter when Glendora's Nathan Pellow kicked a rolling 
Wolfpack punt that was recovered by Nick Baiz, the coach's son. Claremont 
scored on a four-yard pass from Adam Metwalli to Ryan Wall. 
</P>
<P>
"We punted and the most unlikely thing happened," said Baiz, who coached at San 
Dimas and Fermin Lasuen of San Pedro before taking over at Claremont. "Their 
safety just kicked the ball while it was still moving. That was a key play to 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
Glendora had a chance to score on its last possession when it drove to 
Claremont's seven-yard line. However, Nick Baiz again made the big play when he 
intercepted Glendora quarterback Tracey Thompson's pass in the end zone with 13 
seconds remaining.

DOW RISES 18.32 AFTER SEE-SAW DAY OF TRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services

<TEXT>
<P>
Wall Street stocks closed higher Monday after a roller-coaster session that saw 
the Dow Jones industrial index fall by more than 36 points and rise by more 
than 37. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said traders were encouraged by lower oil prices and cheaper gold. 
Earlier, the index fell on worries about IBM's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow climbed 18.32 to 2,416.34, after rising 32.92 on Friday. In the broader 
market, advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 802 up, 748 down and 441 unchanged. 
Big Board volume totaled 164.98 million shares, down from Friday's 187.94 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an extremely volatile day," said Alfred Goldman, technical analyst 
at A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons. "The conviction both among bulls and bears is so 
thin." 
</P>
<P>
Buying was boosted in the afternoon by a plunge in oil prices. Short covering 
-- by traders who had correctly guessed stocks were headed lower recently -- 
also helped lift prices. 
</P>
<P>
Investors also drew encouragement from President Bush's comment that he was 
confident Congress would meet its Oct. 19 deadline for completing a 
deficit-cutting budget blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the type of good news we need to get a better market atmosphere," said 
Ron Doran, director of C. L. King &amp; Associates' institutional trading. "But 
there's the question of whether we'll get fluff." 
</P>
<P>
In the morning session, stocks skidded when IBM announced that its 
third-quarter earnings topped $1 billion, more than a 26% gain from the same 
period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the earnings fell within predicted estimates but that analysts 
participating in a conference call with the company were concerned about 
projected 1991 earnings. IBM ended the day down 1 at 99 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Among the highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Consumer products firms were among the day's better performers, as investors 
continued to favor recession-safe issues. Gillette rose 3 to 55 3/8, General 
Mills added 2 5/8 to 83 3/8, Wrigley rose 1 7/8 to 47 1/2, Ralston Purina 
climbed 1 7/8 to 101 3/8 and Procter &amp; Gamble closed up 1 5/8 to 76 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
* The market continued to react sharply to earnings disappointments. 
Archer-Daniels lost 2 1/8 to 21 1/2. It reported first-quarter profit of 36 
cents a share, compared to 40 cents a year ago. On the plus side, 
better-than-expected earnings lifted Dover Corp. 2 3/8 to 31, Phelps Dodge 3/4 
to 48 3/4, and Magnetek 1/4 to 7 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Eastman Kodak jumped 3 1/4 to 37 7/8 on news of a smaller-than-expected 
patent infringement award to Polaroid. Prudential-Bache cut its rating on 
Polaroid, which plummeted 6 1/2 to 22 3/4, and Shearson Lehman cut its 1991 
earnings projection. 
</P>
<P>
* The tech sector was mixed. Compaq added 1 to 37 3/4. The company unveiled a 
new notebook personal computer. Elsewhere, Intel rose 1 3/8 to 31 3/8. It 
introduced microchips that it said will radically simplify the job of building 
lightweight but powerful notebook-sized personal computers. But NCR plunged 3 
1/2 to 46 1/2 after saying orders have been disappointing recently, and 
Syntellect tumbled 5 to 7 3/4 after reporting weak quarterly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lotus Development dropped 1 1/2 to 12 3/4 in anticipation of 
third-quarter earnings to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
* Caesars World jumped 1 7/8 to 13 7/8. The casino company declined comment on 
the activity. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks rose sharply as investors bought up issues seen benefiting 
from a stronger yen, as well as the shares of financial companies viewed as 
having been oversold during recent market declines. The Nikkei 225-share 
average rose 719.04 points, or 3.21%, to close at 23,109.20. 
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, Germany, the 30-share DAX index ended 19.19 points higher at 
1,478.89. 
</P>
<P>
London shares closed slightly higher but below gains made earlier. The 
Financial Times 100-share index closed up 1.5 points at 2,101.9. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT: Bond Prices Rise in Quiet Session 
</P>
<P>
Government bond prices closed slightly higher Monday after a listless session. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond gained 7/32 point, or $2.19 per $1,000 in 
face amount. Its yield slipped to 8.93% from 8.95% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Government bond prices rose slightly when the market opened after rising 
overseas, then slipped slightly and remained at virtually the same level the 
rest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8%, up from 7.875% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY: Technical Factors Push Dollar Higher 
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished up against most currencies, boosted by technical factors 
that analysts predicted would be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
"The dollar seems more bid than it has in the recent week or two," said Charles 
Wheeler of Swiss Volksbank. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said they doubted that the dollar's rise would last due to lingering 
worries over the economy and the lack of a concrete agreement to cut the 
federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed at 1.526 German marks, up from 1.524 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
However, the dollar fell against the yen across the board. It closed in New 
York at 127.73 yen, down from 129.05 Friday. In Tokyo, it fell to a closing 
128.83 yen from 129.98 yen Friday. Later, in London, it fell to 128.05 yen. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the activity was in cross trading with movement out of high-yielding 
currencies . . . and movement mostly into yen," said Ronald Holzer, chief 
dealer with Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: Oil Prices Decline Amid Profit Taking 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices fell sharply as traders took profits amid the stand-off in the 
Persian Gulf. Gasoline and heating oil also posted big losses. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, oil futures fell; near-term orange juice rebounded; 
grains and soybeans were lower, and livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's lower oil prices also were linked to expectations that U.S. 
consumption of crude oil has begun to weaken on a seasonal basis as refineries 
retool to produce more heating oil and less gasoline, said Peter Beutel, energy 
analyst with the Pegasus Econometric Group of Hoboken, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Light sweet crude oil futures settled 57 cents to $1.74 lower on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange, with November at $37.95 a barrel, down $1.74; heating oil 
was 2.17 to 3.29 cents lower, with November at $1.0207 a gallon, and unleaded 
gasoline was 1.55 to 2.7 cents lower, with November at 94.95 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Frozen concentrated orange juice for November delivery rose 4.5 cents to 
$1.1795 a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange, rebounding from a loss of 
16.45 cents Friday. All other orange juice contracts fell their permitted daily 
limit of 5 cents, though, in a continued reaction to a government report that 
predicted a bumper Florida orange crop. 
</P>
<P>
Harvest pressure helped push most grain and soybean futures prices lower Monday 
on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said dry weekend weather in the Midwest allowed farmers to get back 
into their fields to resume the soybean and corn harvest, which was stalled by 
heavy rains early last week.

Magnetek Inc.: The Los Angeles-based provider of electrical equipment and 
services posted first-quarter net income of $6.4 million, up 21% from a year 
earlier. Sales totaled $265 million, a gain of 11%. The results were attributed 
to continuing demand for its utility and power products, a reduction of debt 
and the broadening of its manufacturing base and marketing channels overseas.

Birthday Bash: British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher turned 65 Saturday but 
has no intention of slowing down. She marked the milestone with a family 
celebration at the prime minister's country residence. 
</P>
<P>
Members of her Conservative Party called for 10 more years of her leadership. 
"I am not immortal," she said recently, "but I've got a lot left in me yet." 
Thatcher became prime minister in 1979.

Sorry Charlie: Charles Keating, the recently incarcerated savings and loan

bungle."

Dream Job: Talk show host Larry King says in People magazine that his fantasy 
interview would be with Jesus Christ: "I would ask him if he believed that he 
was born of virgin birth, because whatever the answer is changes or reinforces 
the world." King, 56, said his toughest interviews were Demond Wilson, who 
starred in the TV series "Sanford and Son," and actor Robert Mitchum. Wilson 
"was brash and obnoxious." Mitchum "just gave me one-word answers," said King.

Aussie Has Heart: Australian media mogul Kerry Packer is donating $2 million to 
the ambulance service to buy heart revival machines like the one that saved his 
life when his heart stopped during a polo match. Packer, considered the richest 
Aussie, later made front-page headlines when he was involved in a scuffle with 
a newspaper photographer Saturday on the same polo grounds where he collapsed 
earlier in the week.

The recent budget mess was about jobs. Not people's jobs, but congressional 
jobs. This was brought home to me by House member Luke Slowly, who lives down 
the street. He dropped by the other day with a fistful of polls in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
I had never seen him so depressed. 
</P>
<P>
"This could be the end of the planet Earth as I know it," he told me. "I might 
be shoveling snow by November." 
</P>
<P>
"You're being too pessimistic. Lots of Congresses have been unable to come up 
with a budget and have still been returned to office in a landslide." 
</P>
<P>
"But this is the big one. The American people are boiling mad because we 
couldn't cut $500 billion out of the deficit without causing pain. 
</P>
<P>
"You should see my mail. They are calling me names I would only use against my 
opponent." 
</P>
<P>
"What do the people write?" 
</P>
<P>
"They say that the members of Congress are idiots because half of us wanted to 
give everything to the poor and the other half wanted to give everything to the 
rich. It hurts to hear my constituents blame me because all I was trying to do 
was put the American Dream on hold. If I lose the election because of this, the 
voters will have to live with it for the rest of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
"You are taking a dim view. After all, just because you might lose the election 
doesn't mean you're completely worthless." 
</P>
<P>
"That's easy for you to say," Slowly muttered. "But nobody wants a has-been 
legislator who can't even get on a local talk show any more." 
</P>
<P>
"Slowly," I said, "you'll still be a valuable asset even though you may be out 
of a job." 
</P>
<P>
He asked, "What could I do?" 
</P>
<P>
"You could become a lobbyist and fight for what you believe in -- for a large 
fee." 
</P>
<P>
"Every congressman who loses in November is going to become a lobbyist. What 
have I got to sell the vested interests that they don't have already?" 
</P>
<P>
"You could teach them the art of wheeling and dealing," I told him. "Why not 
take credit for killing all the new taxes on cigarettes and liquor?" 
</P>
<P>
Slowly responded: "But they weren't killed!" 
</P>
<P>
"Who's going to know that? The only ones who will be aware of the taxes are the 
smokers and the drinkers, and since it's a sin tax, they will be happy to pay 
it. My advice is to print up cards and call yourself 'Across-the-Board Slowly.' 
You'll have all the business you can handle."

ORIGINS: THE LIVES AND WORLDS OF MODERN COSMOLOGISTS, BY ALAN LIGHTMAN AND 
ROBERTA BRAWER. HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS. $29.95, 561 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cosmology -- the study of the universe and its origin -- is perhaps science's 
grandest stage. But galaxies don't lend themselves to experiments as, say, 
atoms do. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, cosmology has historically occupied a place on the edge of 
science, say MIT physicist and essayist Alan Lightman and MIT graduate student 
Roberta Brawer in "Origins," a fascinating, surprisingly accessible and 
altogether human collection of conversations with today's leading cosmologists. 
</P>
<P>
The field began to gain respectability rapidly in the 1920s, Lightman tells us, 
when astronomer Edwin Hubble made two key discoveries at Palomar Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
First, the universe extends far beyond our own Milky Way galaxy, which had been 
thought to be all there was. Second, the universe is expanding, not static as 
had been surmised. Hubble was the first to see that the stars, no matter which 
way he looked, were all moving at high speed away from him. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Lightman earned a large and enthusiastic following among fans of popular 
science writing with the marvelously warm, personal essays on physics and other 
topics he wrote for Science 80s, a magazine bought and killed by Time, Inc., in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
His essays have been collected in two previous books: "Time Travel and Papa 
Joe's Pipe" (1984) and "A Modern Day Yankee in a Connecticut Court" (1986). 
Lightman has also co-authored or otherwise contributed importantly to four 
textbooks on physics and astronomy, subjects he used to teach at Harvard. Now, 
having passed what he calls his "senior" years as a physicist (i.e. mid-30s), 
he teaches mostly science writing at MIT. 
</P>
<P>
"Origins" is composed of a lucid 49-page introduction to the field of 
cosmology, followed by question and answer interviews with 27 prominent 
cosmologists. A useful annotated bibliography of popular books on cosmology and 
a wonderfully clear glossary of technical terms round out the book. The book 
not only makes excellent use of Lightman's remarkable talent for explaining, it 
also allows him to exercise another of his peculiar strengths: looking at the 
human side of science. 
</P>
<P>
From what Lightman tells us about his cosmologists' family backgrounds, for 
instance, cosmology seems to be an equal opportunity profession -- within 
limits set by environment and individual aptitude. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most striking examples is that of Don Page, now a professor of 
physics at Penn State University. Page grew up in a succession of Eskimo 
villages in Alaska, where his missionary parents taught elementary school. He 
left Alaska for the first time after graduating from high school to attend a 
small liberal arts Christian college in Missouri. As a graduate student, he 
made a quantum leap to Caltech. There he met the eminent astrophysicist and 
best-selling author Stephen Hawking, who was a visiting scholar at the 
institute. Page later joined Hawking in England, and the two men co-authored 
some landmark papers. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most consistent similarity in the backgrounds of the front-rank 
cosmologists interviewed for the book is their parents' role in their early 
education. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Geller, professor of astronomy at Harvard University, recalls that her 
father gave her toys that helped her visualize abstract, geometric shapes in 
three dimensions -- an invaluable skill in mathematics, physics and cosmology, 
Lightman says. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave me toys where you could connect flat shapes up with rubber bands to 
make solid figures . . . and he'd explain to me the relationships between the 
things I built and things in the world," Geller recounts. 
</P>
<P>
She is now known for her extraordinary power of visualization, Lightman says, 
and particularly for having discovered, from reams of computer data, that some 
galaxies appear not to be evenly distributed throughout the cosmos, as was 
widely thought, but rather to be located on the surfaces of immense bubble-like 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
Concepts such as this one, and many others in the book, may stagger the average 
reader on first impact. Lightman is perfectly at ease with them. Arcane cosmic 
phenomena such as black holes, where a teaspoon of matter weighs more than a 
billion tons, are meat and drink to him. Readers lucky enough to sit near him 
at this intellectual banquet table will share the physicist's exquisite 
pleasure at the feast.

INTO THE NIGHT: THE PARTY CHRONICLES: A FIRST-NIGHT FETE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: Sunday night at the Doolittle Theatre in Hollywood, at the Los 
Angeles premiere of "The Heidi Chronicles," a new production of the Center 
Theatre Group and the Ahmanson Theatre. (The play, which one critic called "a 
chronicle of frayed feminism," earned playwright Wendy Wasserstein a Tony 
Award, a Pulitzer Prize and seemingly every possible accolade except a World 
Series ring.) After the comedy-drama concluded, cast and guests went over to 
the Columbia Bar &amp; Grill for an after party. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: Wasserstein, director Daniel Sullivan, and cast members Amy 
Irving, Mark Harelik, Robert Curtis-Brown, Mimi Lieber, Elaine Hausman, Maggie 
Baird, Amy Ryan, and Michael Sandels, as well as Scott Bakula, Ed Begley Jr., 
Jim Bridges, Patrick Dempsey, Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, U.S. Rep. Mel Levine, 
Barry Levinson, Donna Mills, Cassandra Peterson, Priscilla Pointer (Amy 
Irving's mother), Charles Nelson Reilly, Rob Stone and Joanne Worley. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code: On temperate Sunday evenings, when people have spent the weekend 
relaxing, apparently anything goes. Most people managed to put on suits and 
ties, but a few couldn't give up the blue jeans they'd been wearing all day. 
</P>
<P>
Fashion Statements: Director Sullivan wore a vintage "Students for Kennedy" 
button, while cast member Harelik topped off his yellow argyle socks with 
leather sandals. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Crab cakes, quesadillas, lox, carrot cake, brownies and fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Noted: Like so many writers of her generation, Wasserstein has studded "The 
Heidi Chronicles" with plenty of '60s hits. Judging from the number of people 
in the audience who seemed to know all the words, the lyrics of Motown have 
become literary allusions for the thirtysomething crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: Wasserstein, whose down-to-earth persona is the antithesis of the 
stereotypical astringent Manhattan playwright, came into the party lugging a 
plastic shopping bag. "Inside is a basketful of different kinds of soaps. It's 
a gift from the cast, and it's very sweet and very dear," she said. She's 
working on a Heidi screenplay as well as a film script of Stephen McCauley's 
novel of a few years back, "The Object of My Affection." 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: The party featured an elaborate cake shaped like the stage, with 
representations of the set design. Closer examination revealed that the 
confection was a fake cake, and that the tiny figures were made out of some 
compound that looked like clay. Everything in the theater, apparently, is an 
illusion. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: The Columbia Bar &amp; Grill is close to the Doolittle, but not close 
enough to walk in high heels and dress clothes -- necessitating the use of 
valet parkers twice in one night. Maybe the theater could consider the use of 
shuttle buses from the theater to parties.

A FIRST: VIRGINIA IS NO. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coach George Welsh, who rescued Virginia's program from college football's skid 
row, has moved the Cavaliers atop the Associated Press poll for the first time 
in its history. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's like Andy Warhol," Welsh said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe this is our 15 minutes of fame." 
</P>
<P>
Before Welsh's arrival in 1982, Virginia had only two winning seasons in 29 
years and had not been ranked higher than ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia, 6-0 and ranked No. 2 last week, was a 31-0 winner over North Carolina 
State; top-ranked Michigan lost, 28-27, to Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
"This may last only a week," said Welsh, whose team will be a heavy favorite 
Saturday when it plays at Wake Forest (2-4). 
</P>
<P>
Virginia, leading the nation with averages of 48 points and 540 yards, has 
outscored its opponents, 288-66. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we had respect nationally before this year," Welsh said. "But the 
polls don't mean that much to me. They don't mean anything. They don't mean 
anything until the bowls are over." 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers are one of three Atlantic Coast Conference teams in the top 25. 
Georgia Tech, which will play Virginia at Charlottesville Nov. 3, improved from 
18th to No. 11 after beating league foe Clemson. The Tigers slipped from 13th 
to a tie for 22nd with Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Miami is No. 2, followed by Tennessee, Nebraska, Auburn, Notre Dame, Florida 
State, Illinois, Houston and Michigan.

One week after gaining 203 yards in his debut against Washington State, 
tailback Mazio Royster said he felt the effects of his 22 carries for 112 yards 
against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't really attacking last week," Royster said of Washington State's 
defenders. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy would hit me and I wouldn't feel it too much. But with these (Stanford) 
guys, I would feel it every time. They're rough and rugged." 
</P>
<P>
For the record: It was reported last week that Oklahoma, while on NCAA 
probation in 1974, was voted to national championships in the Associated Press 
and United Press International polls. Actually, USC, with a 10-1-1 record that 
included a 55-24 come-from-behind victory over Notre Dame, won the UPI version 
of the national title. It was the first season that teams on NCAA probation 
were not included in the UPI poll. JERRY CROWE

3 TROJAN PLAYERS CHARGED;

COURTS: FRESHMEN MEMBERS OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM ARE ACCUSED IN ALLEGED SEXUAL 
ASSAULT ON A COUNSELOR.

Misdemeanor charges were filed Monday in L.A. Municipal Court against three USC 
football players in connection with an alleged sexual assault on a 23-year-old 
graduate student, a spokesman for the city attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Freshmen Willie McGinest of Long Beach, Jason Oliver of Bakersfield and Michael 
Jones of Granada Hills will be arraigned Nov. 2 in Division 82 of the municipal 
court, spokesman Ted Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 18, faces one count of sexual battery, which carries a maximum sentence 
of six months in county jail, a $2,000 fine or both, and one count of false 
imprisonment, which carries a maximum sentence of one year in county jail, a 
$1,000 fine or both. 
</P>
<P>
McGinest, 19, and Oliver, 18, also face one count each of false imprisonment, 
and one count each of battery, which carries a maximum sentence of six months 
in county jail, a $2,000 fine or both. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations stem from an incident July 20 in Pardee Tower, a campus 
dormitory at USC. The alleged victim said that the players took her to a 
dormitory room and assaulted her. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was a peer counselor in a summer college indoctrination program in 
which the players participated. The incident allegedly took place during a 
program-ending party in the residence hall. 
</P>
<P>
The case initially was brought to the L.A. County District Attorney's office, 
which forwarded it to the city attorney's office. Charges were filed after 
review of the case, which included interviews with six witnesses, Goldstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The three players remain on the team. Coach Larry Smith declined comment on the 
charges, referring questions to Jim Dennis, USC's vice president in charge of 
student affairs. Dennis said that the status of the players will remain 
unchanged pending the outcome of criminal procedures.

Football coaches usually strive for a balanced offense, but UCLA had to use its 
passing game more often early in the season because it fell behind against 
Oklahoma, Stanford and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
However, in victories over Washington State and San Diego State and a loss to 
Arizona, the Bruins have rushed for 680 yards and passed for 681 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Brian Brown has rushed for 100 or more yards in each of the past three 
games. For the season, he has gained 425 yards, a 4.8-yard average. Fullback 
Kevin Smith has gained 305 yards, a 4.6 average. MAL FLORENCE

See Rickey run. 
</P>
<P>
See him steal 65 bases during the regular season and bedevil opposing pitchers 
and catchers. See him succeed in 12 of 13 attempts on artificial surfaces like 
the bright green carpet in Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium, site of Games 1 and 
2 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"If I played on (artificial) turf, I'd steal 160 bases," Rickey Henderson, the 
Athletics' left fielder, said after Monday's workout. "You get a lot better 
traction and power. And this turf is faster than a lot of turf I've played 
on.," 
</P>
<P>
See the Reds wince. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of intimidating," Cincinnati catcher Joe Oliver said. 
</P>
<P>
To keep Henderson and the A's from running away with the World Series, the Reds 
have resolved to keep Henderson off the basepaths -- as much as it's possible 
to stifle a .325 hitter. 
</P>
<P>
They will also rev up their own running game, which produced 166 stolen bases 
-- 25 more than the A's -- and featured seven players who reached double 
figures, compared with three for the A's. Billy Hatcher and Barry Larkin shared 
the club lead with 30 steals each, five more than Chris Sabo. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to run in the Series," Manager Lou Piniella said. "We've got to 
get people on base to be able to do what we'd like to. Overall, we probably 
have a little more team speed, but it only helps you if you get on base. 
</P>
<P>
"They key (with Henderson) is getting him out at the plate. If he can get on 
base, he's nearly impossible to stop. Once he's on, you can't lose your 
concentration on whoever's up there because they're all capable of hitting it 
out of the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson hit .294 in Oakland's sweep of the Boston Red Sox in the American 
League playoffs and stole two bases in three attempts. Willie McGee and Jose 
Canseco each added two steals. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody talks about Rickey running, but McGee and Canseco can steal a base, 
too," said Oliver, a .231 hitter whose arm put him in the lineup instead of 
Jeff Reed. "It's not going to be easy." 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati's catchers threw out only 60 of 195 base stealers -- that's 31% -- 
during the regular season and two of four during the Reds' six-game National 
League playoff victory over Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe and even Jeff have a chance of throwing him out, but if Rickey gets his 
best lead and best jump versus our best release, he's going to beat us," said 
Red coach Jackie Moore, who managed the A's from 1984 through June, 1986, and 
was their first-base coach in 1982 when Henderson set the single-season steal 
record of 130. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland catchers Terry Steinbach and Ron Hassey threw out 44 of 117 runners -- 
38% -- during the regular season and were victimized once by Boston. Hassey 
plays rarely but is expected to catch Bob Welch in Game 2, as he has in 67 of 
Welch's last 69 starts. 
</P>
<P>
"There could be some more pitchouts and things like that, but we're not going 
to drastically change anything now," Steinbach said. "I'm not going to change 
my thinking or start thinking I have to throw quicker or better. If the pitcher 
gives me a good chance and I get off a good throw to the second baseman, most 
of the time I'm going to have a good chance of getting the guy. 
</P>
<P>
"They have five or six guys who like to run, and I'm sure they're going to be 
running. That's been a strong part of the game for them all year. But I can 
only worry about what Terry Steinbach can do behind the plate. I can't try to 
throw off my knees. I have to stay with what's worked for me. . . . You try to 
keep the pitchers as quick as possible without messing up their whole delivery, 
but our pitchers are pretty experienced, and they know what they have to do." 
</P>
<P>
Hall of Fame catcher Johnny Bench, an announcer on Reds' telecasts during the 
season and a radio analyst for the Oakland-Boston series, said Steinbach and 
Hassey could have an edge over Oliver and Reed behind the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"Steiny is one of those guys who digs down in the dirt but is sound 
fundamentally, and his basic defense is very good," Bench said. "Joe Oliver has 
a good arm, and Reed doesn't throw as well as Oliver. As far as handling the 
pitching staff, you've got to look at Steinbach and Hassey. They can fall out 
of bed and know what they're going to do. A lot of times a catcher can see a 
hitter step into the box and know how to pitch him. Oliver is new to it. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not going to stop Rickey Henderson. The catcher's role is to stop the 
rest of the guys. Rickey is going to get nine of 10 in a bad week and the 
catcher is going to feel lucky he got that one. Oliver can do it, with the 
right pitcher, but it's really a matter of getting the other guys. 
</P>
<P>
"The Reds have more people who can run or will run, but (Dave) Stewart and 
Welch are former Dodgers, and they learned their (pickoff) moves well." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson will make his moves regardless of who is pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anything about the Reds and I ain't studying now," he said. "I 
really don't know the moves of any pitchers in the American League. I just 
focus on what I have to do. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to run if we get on, but we're not going to run more because we're 
on turf. If it's running time, we'll run. If it's not running time, we won't. 
We're just going to stay within our game plan."

WEISS DROPPED BECAUSE OF INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walt Weiss was dropped from the Oakland Athletics' World Series roster because 
of the strained ligaments in his left knee he suffered during the American 
League playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably needed three more weeks if I seriously thought about getting out 
there," Weiss said. "It's going to be tough to feel involved when I'm used to 
being out there every day." 
</P>
<P>
Infielder Mike Bordick replaces Weiss on the roster. Mike Gallego will start at 
shortstop and Willie Randolph will start at second, where he and Gallego have 
been platooned.

The Cincinnati Reds speak of him in hushed tones. They know he is one of the 
primary reasons they are in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
And yet . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough, it's still real tough for anyone to talk about him," infielder Ron 
Oester said. "He's here in spirit, we know that. And we know he'll be watching 
us. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's hard sitting here talking about him, because he's not here, and we 
don't know what he's going through. It's sad thinking about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wish he could be here, being a part of all this. We all do." 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose is wearing No. 01832-061 these days. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of being on a baseball field, the former manager of the Reds is in a 
minimum security prison in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
"I still hear people saying the reason we won it this year is because Pete's 
not here, with all of the distractions he caused," Oester said. "That's bull. 
Pete Rose had nothing to do with us losing." 
</P>
<P>
Said first baseman Todd Benzinger: "This town worships Pete, and it always 
will. What we went through last year was a fiasco, but you can't blame that on 
Pete, you really can't. No one could have managed that team to the World Series 
with all our injuries." 
</P>
<P>
Oakland's Willie McGee, expected to start Game 1 tonight in center field, still 
is awaiting word about his future. He has yet to be told by the Athletics 
whether they will attempt to sign him as a free agent. They acquired him in a 
trade Aug. 29 from St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
McGee says, if he has to guess, he thinks they will let him go. 
</P>
<P>
The way he sees it, there's no sense keeping a $3-million player as a reserve 
outfielder, considering that Dave Henderson is almost fully recovered from his 
knee injury and ready to return as the starting center fielder in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they need me," McGee said. "Dave's the one who got them there, 
he deserves the opportunity to play. I'll just help out. "I'd like to stay, but 
I can't see myself being an everyday player with Hendu here." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, a right-hander, will probably start Game 2 at Cincinnati, with 
left-hander Danny Jackson pitching for the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Dibble, the man who said Sunday he would keep his mouth shut during the 
World Series, waited all the way until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The subject was Dennis Eckersley, bullpen stopper of the Athletics. When asked 
if Eckersley could be an honorary member of the Nasty Boys, Dibble said he 
would be thrilled to invite him. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, he's my idol," Dibble said. "I watched him when I was growing up in 
Connecticut. I consciously studied him, copying his delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, he's the best there is. He's got everything I want. I'm envious of a 
guy who can throw a slider and breaking ball like his. People say I can't 
because I have bad mechanics, but how can you have bad mechanics when you throw 
100 miles an hour? 
</P>
<P>
"He's even got the long hair I want. We can't have long hair here, it's against 
club policy. But hopefully one day I'll be able to grown a fu manchu like Goose 
Gossage. I want to get my own identity. I think I'll grow a mustache when I go 
to Japan (in November), and take it from there." 
</P>
<P>
Said Eckersley: "He can have my mustache, I'll take his fastball." 
</P>
<P>
Jose Rijo, the Reds' scheduled starter in Game 1, refused to say anything 
outrageous that would incite the Athletics. Then he returned to his locker, 
took off his jacket and exposed a T-shirt that read: "It's Over." Said Rijo: 
"Hey, I didn't say it, my shirt said it." 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati's Lou Piniella played in four World Series with the New York Yankees 
before making it to the Series as a manager this season. Given the choice, he 
would rather be here as a player. 
</P>
<P>
"It's different as a manager," Piniella said. "You have more responsibility. As 
a player you get yourself ready to play and that's all you have to do." 
</P>
<P>
Piniella wears the 1977 ring he won with the Yankees. "It was the first one and 
that's special," he said. "But if we win this one, I'll wear a Cincinnati 
ring." 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Moore, a coach for the Reds, was Oakland's manager when a right-handed 
pitcher who had been released by the Philadelphia Phillies asked the A's for a 
job. 
</P>
<P>
That pitcher was Dave Stewart, Oakland's starter tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Sandy (Alderson, Oakland's vice president for baseball operations) to 
sign him, but I'm not going to tell you I was smart enough to say he would win 
20 games four times," said Moore, who was fired in June of 1986 after nearly 2 
1/2 seasons as manager.

DONAHUE: IT'S STILL EARLY IN THE RACE; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA: THERE IS A LOT OF FOOTBALL TO BE PLAYED, THE COACH SAYS. THIS WEEK'S 
RESULTS WILL TELL MORE.

Midway through the Pacific 10 Conference football season, five teams have been 
virtually eliminated from championship contention. 
</P>
<P>
With two defeats, Arizona, Oregon, Arizona State, Stanford and Washington State 
can only hope to play in a bowl game other than the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Still alive are Washington, the only unbeaten team at 3-0; UCLA, California and 
USC, all with 2-1 records, and, if you can believe it, Oregon State at 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
The list of contenders could be pared to three teams this weekend, depending on 
the outcomes of UCLA's game against Cal Saturday at Berkeley, and the 
USC-Arizona and Oregon State-Washington State games. 
</P>
<P>
"If you subscribe to the theory that two losses is the kiss of death, then it's 
an elimination tournament," UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said Monday. "I don't 
know, though, that this year that will necessarily be the case. 
</P>
<P>
"The conference is awful tough from top to bottom and hard to read. There's a 
lot of football left in five weeks. A lot of people want to predetermine the 
championship early. But a lot of things can happen." 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the Bruins' schedule is demanding, but also presents opportunities 
-- games against California, Oregon State, Oregon, Washington and USC. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to evaluate his team, which is 3-3 overall at the midway point of the 
season, Donahue said: 
</P>
<P>
"I wish this was the beginning of the year. And what I mean by that is that we 
know more about our team. The quarterback position is established (with Tommy 
Maddox), (fullback) Kevin Smith has emerged, (tailback) Brian Brown has come on 
and (flanker) Scott Miller is back in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're in a developmental process. We have some powerful people who can 
impact a game, and then we have some other personnel deficiencies that makes us 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're a great team by any stretch of the imagination, or a bad 
team. I think were kind of in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's offense is flourishing, averaging 26.2 points a game. But the defense 
has given up an average of 30.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think our defense is as bad as it appears statistically when we're 
healthy," Donahue said. "Unfortunately, our defensive team is very thin and, 
when we lose a starting player, it's just has an unbelievable rippling impact 
on us. We can't replace players like we once could." 
</P>
<P>
Defensive lineman Siitupe Tuala is the latest addition to the Bruin injury 
list. He suffered torn ligaments in his right knee on the last play of the game 
against San Diego State Saturday night and is lost for the season. Surgery is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Roman Phifer has missed the last two games with a hamstring injury. 
Linebacker Rocen Keeton missed the first three games after having had 
arthroscopic knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Others who have been inactive for one to three games with injuries are 
defensive tackle Brian Kelly, safety Matt Darby, defensive end Mike Chalenski, 
and cornerbacks Dion Lambert, Michael Williams and Damion Lyons. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA center Lance Zeno was unable to play against San Diego State because of 
sprained ligaments in his foot. His backup, John Zilinskas, injured his ankle 
in the game and may be inactive for several weeks. Aron Gideon, a walk-on, 
finished the game at center. 
</P>
<P>
California is 4-2 overall, having won its past three games. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said the big difference in the Bears from others years is their running 
game. Cal hasn't had an outstanding running back since Chuck Muncie in the 
mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Bears apparently have accomplished players in tailbacks Anthony Wallace 
and Russell White. Wallace is averaging 4.7 yards a carry, White is at 5.2 and 
has scored 10 touchdowns, seven rushing. 
</P>
<P>
"White is extremely fast for a big running back (6 feet, 200 pounds)," Donahue 
said of the former Encino Crespi High star. "He breaks a lot of tackles and 
makes people miss him. Wallace is also a fine player in his own right."

BUSH CONDEMNS HUSSEIN AMID CONFUSING SIGNALS 
</P>

<P>
Bush Administration policy-makers are intensely studying a rash of confusing 
signals from occupied Kuwait that could indicate an Iraqi plan to withdraw from 
part of the country, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, Bush and his senior aides continue to issue 
bellicose warnings about Iraqi atrocities in Kuwait -- warnings that one 
official said are part of a deliberate campaign to prepare the American people 
for the possibility of military action against Iraqi forces. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, campaigning in Texas, for the first time explicitly compared Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein to Adolf Hitler and, also for the first time, publicly 
raised the possibility of a war crimes trial for the Iraqi leader's "ghastly 
atrocities" against the Kuwaiti people. 
</P>
<P>
"The story of two young kids passing out leaflets: Iraqi troops rounded up 
their parents and made them watch while those two kids were shot to death -- 
executed before their eyes," Bush said as he listed the "horrible tales" of 
Iraq's actions in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Hitler revisited," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
The strong rhetoric, U.S. officials say, is part of an effort to keep 
international pressure focused on Iraq at a time when events elsewhere in the 
Middle East, particularly in Israel, threaten to create dissension within the 
anti-Iraq alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Even more dissension would be likely if Iraq did withdraw from parts of Kuwait, 
officials fear. And new signs indicating that may be a possibility have 
prompted considerable discussion within the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two schools of thought here," one Administration official said. 
"One, that Saddam Hussein is trying to find a way out; the other, that he is 
simply trying to divide everybody" by pretending to be willing to withdraw. The 
tactic is one Hussein used frequently during the Iran-Iraq War. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be something. We don't know," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this fall, some U.S. analysts, pointing to the massive looting of 
Kuwait, had suggested that Hussein was planning to strip the country first, 
then pull out of most of it. Iraq's chief interests in Kuwait, the analysts 
noted, are a large oil field straddling the border between the two nations and 
two Kuwaiti islands, Warba and Bubiyan, that command the approaches to Iraq's 
only Persian Gulf port. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi denials of any willingness to withdraw from any part of Kuwait had 
quieted such speculation. But the possibility is now being taken seriously once 
more because of more recent signals, ranging from movements of border signposts 
by Iraqi troops to statements by a ranking Soviet official after a visit to 
Baghdad that Hussein had indicated a willingness to withdraw from much of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In Saudi Arabia, the wife of the Kuwaiti planning minister, who recently left 
Kuwait, reported that Iraq is fencing off the northern third of the country -- 
an area that includes the oil field and the disputed islands. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqis are setting up a wire fence across Kuwait. They apparently plan to 
gulp up Bubiyan and the northeastern oil field," said Fatima Hussein, who fled 
her occupied country last week. She is the wife of Planning Minister Salman 
Abdul-Razek Mutawa. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a senior member of the Saudi royal family confirmed that 
intelligence reports indicate Iraqi troops may be building reinforced positions 
in northern Kuwait south of the disputed islands and the Rumaila oil field. 
</P>
<P>
And a member of Kuwait's ruling Sabah family said he has received reports that 
Iraqi troops are putting up concrete barriers along the Mutla Ridge, a range of 
low mountains that separates northern Kuwait from the more populated areas 
around Kuwait city. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti officials at the government-in-exile in Saudi Arabia are clearly 
alarmed about the possibility of what, for many of them, has been a nightmare 
scenario: a partial Iraqi pullout that likely would cause fatal leaks in the 
international alliance against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Nations now willing to confront Iraq for the liberation of Kuwait would be far 
less likely to do so over a mere border dispute between the two nations, they 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
"We would become just another international conflict," one member of the Sabah 
family said. "Another Palestine. Another Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, many officials say that -- had Hussein seized only part of Kuwait in 
the first place -- the international campaign against him never would have 
gotten off the ground. After a brief period of protest, "we would have jumped 
quickly there and mediated and kissed each other," one senior Arab diplomat 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaitis, along with some Saudi and U.S. officials, fear that Hussein may 
now try to pull back, hoping to hold onto much of what he truly wanted in the 
first place while avoiding a war that would probably end his regime. 
</P>
<P>
Other officials are far more skeptical, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe Iraq now has any thinking of withdrawing from Kuwait," one 
Saudi official said. "There is no sign at all that that is Hussein's intention. 
The Iraqi officials still say they don't want to leave Kuwait, that there is no 
Kuwait. Something like that doesn't mean peaceful intentions." 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials say Bush would oppose settling for a partial 
withdrawal from Kuwait but would have to defer to whatever decision the 
Kuwaitis made on the issue. Any such compromise, U.S. officials fear, would be 
seen in the Middle East as a victory for Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly better to use the military option than it is to compromise your 
objectives," one senior U.S. official said. "Do I think it is better to use the 
military option than realize the existing objectives diplomatically? No. Is it 
better to use the military option than having Saddam Hussein sit in Kuwait 
forever? Yes. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The official said "everyone is pretty sober" about the possibility of war 
although he added, "People realize that it's potentially costly, but it's a 
serious option." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, meanwhile, stepped up his condemnation of Hussein. In Texas, where he 
campaigned for Clayton Williams, the Republican candidate for governor, Bush 
denounced Hussein's "systematic assault on the soul of a nation." 
</P>
<P>
Reiterating reports delivered last month, when he was visited at the White 
House by the Kuwaiti emir, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah, Bush told of infants 
removed from incubators and dialysis patients taken from kidney machines so 
that the equipment could be shipped to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember -- when Hitler's war ended, there were the Nuremberg trials," Bush 
said, referring to the war crimes trials that followed World War II. 
Administration officials have privately been investigating the possibility of 
such trials since August. 
</P>
<P>
Staff writers Kim Murphy in Saudi Arabia, Jack Nelson and Robin Wright in 
Washington and James Gerstenzang, traveling with President Bush in Texas, 
contributed to this report.

B-2 SURVIVES KEY TEST AS SENATE OKS DEFENSE BILL; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: LAWMAKERS, IN 50-44 VOTE, REJECT BID TO HALT PRODUCTION OF PLANE AT 
SIX INSTEAD OF 75 SOUGHT BY BUSH.

<P>
The controversial B-2 Stealth bomber narrowly survived an effort to gun it down 
Monday as the Senate approved a $268-billion defense spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
An amendment to halt production of the radar-eluding bomber at six planes 
instead of the 75 sought by President Bush was defeated, 50 to 44. Less than a 
year ago, opponents of the B-2 were able to muster only 29 votes against 
further production. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the B-2, attacked as a costly white elephant whose mission died with 
the end of the Cold War, reportedly won another key battle to stay alive. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Senate and House conferees on a companion military programs 
bill had agreed to fund two new planes in fiscal 1991 in exchange for cutting 
funding of the "Star Wars" anti-missile program. 
</P>
<P>
While the Senate has narrowly supported the B-2, the House has passed defense 
spending and programs bills that would terminate production at 15 planes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a very good chance of passing a conference report with the B-2 
in it," said a key B-2 supporter in the House who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Senate approval of the defense spending bill Monday was by a vote of 79 to 16. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who voted against the measure, supported the 
anti-B-2 amendment offered by Sens. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and William S. 
Cohen (R-Me.). Cranston protested that the bomber, built in Southern California 
by Los Angeles-based Northrop Corp., is a waste of resources that could be 
devoted to more deserving programs. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), who did not vote because he is campaigning for 
governor in his home state, has strongly supported the B-2 in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The Leahy-Cohen amendment would have permitted completion of only six B-2s, 
which would be used for flight testing in the development of two new fighter 
planes using the revolutionary Stealth technology. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment would have canceled $2.75 billion in procurement funds but would 
have retained all $1.75 billion requested for research, development and testing 
of the B-2. About $3 billion in previously appropriated, but unused, funds 
would have gone for termination costs. 
</P>
<P>
In spirited debate on the plane, Leahy declared: "Let's make the Stealth bomber 
truly invisible. Let's make it disappear today." 
</P>
<P>
He said that "we can cut $35 billion off the deficit by ending this program." 
</P>
<P>
About $27 billion has been invested in the program to date, mostly on research 
and development. The Pentagon, which originally proposed building 132 planes at 
a cost of about $70 billion, now is seeking 75 planes at a cost of $65 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen argued that the plane, which was intended as a deep-penetrating bomber in 
the event of nuclear war with the Soviet Union, no longer has a mission, 
despite arguments by proponents that it could be employed in regional 
conflicts, such as the current Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
He also cited serious management problems at Northrop disclosed in 
congressional testimony last week. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) pleaded that 
development be permitted to continue on "a revolutionary plane that is going to 
change the nature of warfare and in our favor." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn said that dropping the plane probably would wind up costing the United 
States much more in the long run. He explained that, while the Soviet Union 
would have effective air defenses against the existing B-52 or B-1 bombers, the 
United States would have limited defenses against Soviet bombers. 
</P>
<P>
"It will cost, in my opinion, between $100 billion and $200 billion to build an 
air defense for this country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, the Senate adopted an amendment requiring the withdrawal of 
10,000 U.S. troops per year from Japan, unless the Japanese pay all costs of 
stationing U.S. forces there. 
</P>
<P>
There are now about 50,000 U.S. troops in Japan, with the Japanese picking up 
about 40% of the $5-billion yearly cost -- a far larger share than any other 
country pays for supporting U.S. deployments. 
</P>
<P>
But the Senate rejected a similar amendment aimed at pulling 80,000 U.S. troops 
out of Europe instead of the 50,000 required by the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The two amendments, offered by Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), reflect a growing 
congressional move to reduce the U.S. share of the cost of mutual defense 
efforts. The critics charge that the United States is subsidizing commercial 
competitors who also are military allies -- notably, Germany and Japan.

KUWAIT WOMEN RESIST IRAQ, SEEK RECOGNITION OF ROLE; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: CHANTS, POSTERS AND PEACEFUL MARCHES ARE THEIR ARMS AGAINST 
INVADERS. THREE HAVE DIED SO FAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
JIDDA, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Instead of guns, their weapons are soft Arabic chants and posters of their 
beloved emir, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah. Their battlefields are the 
mosques and living rooms of Kuwait city. For armament against the Iraqi 
soldiers, they tote their children at their sides. 
</P>
<P>
With most of the military leaders of the organized resistance now in hiding, 
the veiled, often-secretive women of Kuwait have become the most public leaders 
of the opposition, marching peacefully through the streets, organizing 
neighborhoods for civil defense and secretly carrying cash and supplies to the 
military resistance. 
</P>
<P>
"After the invasion, the whole of Kuwait nearly froze. Nothing going on except 
telephone calls and tears and fears, and of course you hear all of these sounds 
of the military machines," said a woman named Fatima, an organizer of the 
women's resistance who escaped from Kuwait only last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it was our responsibility to break the ice. If somebody hits you on 
the head and you faint, you need somebody to splash cold water, to pat your 
cheeks to wake you up. I think at this particular moment this is the role of 
women in Kuwait," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Three women have been shot to death in public demonstrations so far. Others 
have been imprisoned and raped, according to reports from Kuwait, and still 
others have risked their families by secretly aiding the Kuwaiti resistance. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Fatima made a step toward official recognition of women's role in 
the resistance effort, becoming the only woman to address the more than 1,000 
Kuwaiti intellectuals, political leaders and businessmen who gathered in Saudi 
Arabia over the weekend to discuss the liberation of Kuwait and future 
political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Women do not have the right to vote in Kuwait. They do not attend the private 
diwaniyas, a kind of Kuwaiti men's kaffeeklatsch, where important political 
issues are usually debated and decided. 
</P>
<P>
Sheik Saad al Abdullah al Sabah, the crown prince and prime minister, has 
promised an expanded role for women in a liberated Kuwait. However, many women, 
angry at not being invited to participate in the Jidda talks, want to make 
certain that the pledge includes real, tangible political rights, such as the 
right to vote. 
</P>
<P>
As she stood in front of the delegation in a closed session Monday, Fatima 
said, many men seemed to think the idea of women's political rights was a novel 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thought it was new, just because the crown prince had mentioned it," 
she said. "I told them this was not something new. Somebody asked me: 'Did you 
think about all this before?' I said, 'Of course, yes. For years.' " You know, 
I think they were listening." 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti women organized their first demonstration against the Iraqi occupation 
only three days after the Aug. 2 invasion, telephoning neighbors and calling 
them to a meeting at a centrally located mosque. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was to be limited to women and children. Fathers and sons who 
dropped off family members were instructed to leave immediately in the hope of 
avoiding a confrontation with Iraqi soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
By 9 a.m., nearly 250 women had shown up, and they began praying for those 
killed in the invasion up to that point. Then, they began quietly marching down 
the street with posters of the emir and the crown prince, planning to go only a 
short distance. When Iraqi soldiers held back, the women made a circuit of the 
entire block. 
</P>
<P>
Women arriving at a nearby grocery store got out of their cars and joined the 
demonstration. By noon, the crowd had swelled to 400. 
</P>
<P>
"That was quite a change," Fatima said. "Anybody who was living in Kuwait could 
really feel it. Everyone had been afraid to leave their houses, and the next 
day, there were three times more cars on the streets because we broke the wall 
of fear." 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, they organized another demonstration at another mosque. 
Nearly 750 women participated. The demonstrations went on, erupting at one 
point into an angry confrontation with Iraqi soldiers that left three women 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
And so, quietly, the women began a system of organizing neighborhoods, drawing 
up lists of doctors and pharmacists living in each region of Kuwait city, 
conducting first-aid training, showing women how to protect their families 
against chemical weapons, explaining how to store food and water supplies and 
manage electricity in the event of war. 
</P>
<P>
A few women began publishing a newsletter, Al Kuwaitia (The Kuwaiti Woman), 
carrying documentation of the Kuwaiti resistance and news of the occupation 
based on reports from the British Broadcasting Corp. and the Voice of America. 
Women provided reports of resistance clashes based on what they had seen in 
their own neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
They published 18 issues, at first daily, then every three days, until Iraqi 
soldiers began confiscating fax and photocopying machines and arresting people 
found with copies of the newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, as violent reprisals have forced members of the military 
resistance into hiding, Kuwaiti women have taken on the job of bringing food 
supplies to the resistance fighters and withdrawing cash for them from the 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
For former policemen and soldiers who are no longer collecting government 
salaries, the women of the resistance have been contacting friends and 
collecting money. They also have been calling on Kuwaiti merchants, collecting 
rice, sugar and tea for the men in hiding. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the military resistance who have left Kuwait said women are going so 
far as to carry weapons and give medical treatment to the resistance fighters. 
Some have become soldiers in the Kuwaitis' mounting psychological warfare 
campaign as well. 
</P>
<P>
"They go up to the Iraqi soldiers and ask them, 'Why are you here? Why do you 
want to kill our people and destroy our country?' " said one former resistance 
fighter. The soldiers, he said, are usually "perplexed." 
</P>
<P>
Some Kuwaiti women, Fatima said, have been captured by Iraqi soldiers and 
sexually assaulted. Her nephew, held prisoner in a home occupied by Iraqi 
troops for several weeks, said he and several of his colleagues heard the 
weeping of women every night from a room nearby. 
</P>
<P>
When the male prisoners were finally released, they saw the source of the 
crying: three Kuwaiti women huddled together in a room in their underwear. The 
men took off their long, white dishdashas and threw them at the women as they 
left. When the soldiers demanded to know why they had done this, her nephew 
told them: "Because they're mine." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how to translate what this means," Fatima said. "It means they 
are my responsibility, they are my family, and it also has a sexual meaning, in 
a way," she said. "He was crying when he told me this." 
</P>
<P>
Fatima decided to drive out of Kuwait to the Saudi border city of Khafji last 
Tuesday after Iraqi soldiers surrounded and searched her home and began 
following her around Kuwait city. 
</P>
<P>
She drove through Saudi Arabia as far south as Dammam before the religious 
police stopped her and reminded her that women are not allowed to drive in 
Saudi Arabia. She quietly complied -- just as she did a few days later at the 
airport in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, when she was told that she was not 
allowed to have a glass of water in the main passenger lounge, but would have 
to go to the "family" lounge instead. 
</P>
<P>
"In Kuwait, I would put my finger in their eyes if anybody says anything like 
that," she said. "In Kuwait, we are allowed to sit in any coffee shop, 
anywhere. But we must be well-behaved guests. If I am invited to your house for 
lunch, I don't change my clothes and go into your bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
Still, some Kuwaiti women have expressed irritation that this past weekend's 
conference on the future of Kuwait, which concluded Monday when a final 
communique was issued, was held in a place like Saudi Arabia, where joint 
meetings between men and women are forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a woman who identified herself only as Aicha sat boldly in the middle 
of the male delegates during Saturday's opening session, a silk veil demurely 
covering her head, and listened as the crown prince vowed: "The Kuwaiti woman, 
whether she is a mother, a sister or a wife, has confirmed that she is equal to 
men and has participated fully in the resistance, rejecting the occupation. She 
has proven that she is equal to her brothers in Kuwait. I am quite confident 
that she will play a major role and contribute further in our future, freed 
Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Aicha confessed that she sneaked into the conference disguised as a 
journalist but said she isn't sure if full political rights for women is a good 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, we had democracy between all the people in Kuwait. Now there will be 
more democracy for women," she said. "But we are an Islamic country, and we are 
an Arabic country. The women, we don't need to sit with men and talk, and we 
don't like to vote. When the men do it, it's good for all of us. Everything we 
want, our prime minister will do for us." 
</P>
<P>
Fatima shrugged and said she fully expects that women will be elected to 
Kuwait's new national assembly after the liberation. 
</P>
<P>
"Democracy is something that's new for us," she admitted, "but as anything else 
in life, it's always between high tide and low tide. So I think now we have 
quite a good future experience. It had got a little bit stuck. Now, it's 
recovering. I think with this shock we will have a full, complete, bright 
democracy."

FEELING HEAT, WILSON GOES BACK TO SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL and CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. Pete Wilson, smarting from criticism over his absence from the U.S. 
Senate, broke off his California quest for governor Monday and flew to 
Washington for crucial end-of-session votes, removing himself from the campaign 
trail and forcing postponement of Thursday's debate with Democrat Dianne 
Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco debate, the second of two agreed to by the candidates, 
tentatively was reset for Oct. 25. Wilson was expected to be in Washington at 
least through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein has hammered Wilson for more than a week, maintaining that he should 
be in Washington protecting California's interests as a budget bill and other 
major pieces of legislation are crafted. The attacks clearly hit their mark, 
particularly after it was disclosed that Wilson missed a pivotal vote on an 
abortion amendment last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But Feinstein, who earlier vowed to suspend her campaign if the second-term 
senator returned to Washington, refused to do so Monday. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if she was adhering to the pledge, made at their first debate, 
Feinstein snapped, "No, I am not." She was not reneging, she emphasized, 
insisting that her pledge applied only to an earlier round of budget votes. And 
she said she was "outraged" by the fact that Wilson was not present in the 
Senate on Friday to break a 48-48 tie on a vote to kill an amendment that would 
require parental consent before young women could get abortions in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
During a press conference at the Southridge Middle School in Fontana, Feinstein 
said: "He did not go back and vote on the deficit-reduction bill. He did not go 
back the first time that was up. So all bets are off." 
</P>
<P>
After their first debate Oct. 7, Feinstein told reporters she would suspend 
campaigning if Wilson had to go East. "For the remainder of the campaign?" she 
was asked. "Oh, not for the remainder of the campaign," she replied. "This 
vote's coming up tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
As recently as last Wednesday, however, Feinstein said she would suspend all 
campaign activities, even fund raisers, "if that's really what it takes to get 
a United States senator to do his duty." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, she added: "I think that when Pete Wilson fulfills his duties in the 
United States Senate, as he was elected to do, then we can talk some more about 
it. . . . I'm going to continue to work just as hard as I possibly can to press 
my candidacy to the people of the state of California." 
</P>
<P>
As he prepared to board American Airlines Flight 36 at Los Angeles 
International Airport, Wilson's office issued a statement in which the senator 
said: "I feel it's both my job as California's senator and as a candidate for 
governor to go back and cast some tough votes, because the economy of our 
nation and our state could depend on what Congress works out with the 
President." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's aides took pains to portray his return to Washington as an assertion 
of his senatorial role rather than a reaction to pressure from Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
"Sen. Wilson has said since the August recess that he would go back when the 
key budget votes would come up and this is the time," said Otto Bos, his 
campaign director. "Whether or not Feinstein has made noise on it, it has to do 
with the votes. The time is now at hand." 
</P>
<P>
Bos accused Feinstein of duplicity, saying she reneged on the promise to 
suspend her campaign. Wilson earlier had scoffed at Feinstein's offer, claiming 
it was meaningless because most of her campaign consisted of fund-raising 
events and not public appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"She has reneged on the promise and we feel that it's sort of like the crib 
notes on her hand," Bos said, referring to words Feinstein had inked on one 
hand during the debate. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson gave up a heavy, GOP star-studded fund-raising schedule in California to 
make the Washington trip, his first since Congress' Labor Day recess. It 
includes events today and Friday with former President Ronald Reagan and 
appearances with Vice President Dan Quayle on Thursday and Friday and with 
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan events and Quayle's appearances will continue as scheduled, Wilson's 
aides said. Sununu's schedule was not known. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and Feinstein agreed to postpone Thursday's debate by one week, although 
both made clear the Oct. 25 date could be jeopardized by an extension of the 
budget debate or other unforeseen events. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the campaign, Wilson had adeptly used his service in the Senate to 
his advantage, running almost as an incumbent. Nearly everywhere he went, he 
could tell his listeners of some action he took in the Senate that benefited 
them. As late as Labor Day, no one expected the congressional session to drag 
so far into the election season. 
</P>
<P>
Even when Congress was forced to adopt an emergency spending resolution a week 
ago, Wilson claimed that his being away from Washington made no difference. 
Most of the votes being taken were routine, he said. And he added there was no 
need for him to be present to vote "no" because being absent from the Senate 
chamber had the same effect. 
</P>
<P>
He promised, however, to return when a decisive budget vote was due or in the 
event another major issue surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein stepped up her attacks on Wilson being "missing from action" when 
critical national decisions were being made. She cited the confirmation of 
Supreme Court Justice David Souter, the sending of American troops to Saudi 
Arabia, the budget deficit and the weakening economy. 
</P>
<P>
Friday was a turning point. Wilson missed a vote on an unexpected amendment by 
Sen. William Armstrong (R-Colo.) that would bar hospitals, doctors and other 
health care providers from receiving federal funds unless they give 48 hours' 
notice to parents of minors seeking abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson opposed the amendment because it made no exceptions for rape or incest 
and did not provide for the courts to grant exemptions. A motion to table the 
abortion amendment, and thus kill it, failed on a 48-48 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, if Wilson had been present and voting "aye," the amendment would 
have died. Ultimately, the amendment was placed in an appropriations bill on a 
voice vote and could become part of federal law if it survives conference 
committee negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Both Wilson and Feinstein are strong supporters of a woman's choice on 
abortion. But Feinstein frequently tells her audiences that, as governor, she 
would be more reliable than Wilson in standing by that position. 
</P>
<P>
Monday she said: "Frankly what happened last Friday was outrageous. He could 
have been there. His vote would have made a difference. Today, based on what is 
probable to happen, I think it puts women in great jeopardy on the choice 
issue."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS TREASURER; 
</P>
<P>
HAYES, BROWN IN UPHILL BATTLE FOR RECOGNITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS P. SHUIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Appointed Republican Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes concedes that the majority of 
voters who will decide his future in the Nov. 6 election still don't know who 
he is, despite 20 months in office. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, Hayes points out that public opinion polls show most voters don't 
know his opponent, Democrat Kathleen Brown, either. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates acknowledge that their race is a toss-up and both figure it 
will go down to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
The poll results are not surprising, since Hayes, appointed by Gov. George 
Deukmejian to fill the unexpired term of the late Jesse M. Unruh, is a new kid 
on the block and the treasurer's office is the kind of institution that no one 
hears much about unless something goes wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Pollster Mervin Field found in late August that 31% of prospective voters could 
identify Hayes, who took office in January, 1989. That compares to 78% who 
could identify Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, 73% who had heard of Secretary of 
State March Fong Eu, and 60% who could pick out Controller Gray Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes argues that his low visibility is a point in his favor. His reasoning: 
Since the treasurer is responsible for issuing about $3 billion worth of bonds 
each year and handling short-term investments of tax funds worth tens of 
billions, no news is good news. Even a minor foul-up, he points out, can cost 
the state millions. A major one, like bungled investments that cost West 
Virginia $297 million, can be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
His opponent doesn't buy that. Brown argues that the treasurer's office is an 
elective office -- and for good reason. She said if all that was needed was a 
shepherd for taxpayers' money, the job could be filled adequately from the 
Civil Service ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Promising she would be a much more aggressive treasurer than Hayes, she 
contends that Hayes' cautious, conservative approach has cost school districts 
at least $37 million in higher interest revenue and that billions of dollars in 
voter-approved bonds are "sitting on the shelf, gathering dust." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, the state's auditor general before taking the treasurer's job, 
frequently characterizes his race as "a financial manager" versus "a 
politician," the label he pins on Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, the daughter and sister of two former California governors, Edmund G. 
(Pat) Brown and Edmund G. Brown Jr., hopes to turn the tables on Hayes. During 
the primary, she portrayed Hayes as "a professional bureaucrat." While she 
still refers to him that way, she also is playing up his ties to the Capitol's 
political establishment. 
</P>
<P>
She points out that the Legislature, just before it appointed Hayes auditor 
general, passed a law removing the requirement that the job be filled by a 
certified public accountant. Hayes is not a CPA. Brown also frequently points 
out that Hayes owes his job to Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the one who owes his career to the politicians in Sacramento, not me," 
Brown said during a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes and Brown will give the voters some clear choices on election day. 
</P>
<P>
Contrasts include: 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, the veteran gray government official, versus Brown, born into 
California's best-known political family. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, with a cautious approach to issuing bonds and the debt that goes with 
them, versus Brown, who promises to aggressively market the $12-billion backlog 
in bonds approved by voters for housing, schools, earthquake repair and other 
projects that have not yet been issued by the treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, who doesn't rock the boat, versus Brown, who would like to use billions 
in pension fund investments as leverage to shake up corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, what the treasurer does is raise and disperse through the sale of 
bonds the $3 billion or so needed each year to keep pace with building and 
capital costs needed to maintain California's prisons, schools, highways and 
water and park systems. 
</P>
<P>
Californians contribute more than $40 billion a year in state taxes to support 
government services -- from meeting the needs of public schools to sending out 
checks to welfare recipients and paying off the bonds. A large part of the 
treasurer's job is finding a place to put idle tax dollars, a place where the 
money can earn a good rate of interest until it's needed. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes contends he has earned consistently high yields on investments while 
managing bond sales so prudently that the state's perfect AAA bond rating has 
not been jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
Brown maintains that Hayes should be doing a lot more, specifically using his 
authority to influence corporate policy. 
</P>
<P>
He could do that, she contends, through his seat on the governing boards of 
Public Employees' Retirement System, with $56 billion in investments, and the 
State Teachers' Retirement system, which manages nearly $30 billion in 
investments. A substantial portion of that money is invested in common stocks, 
which gives the state's shareholders voting rights. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, noting that the employees' retirement system owns 6.2 million shares of 
General Motors Corp. stock, argues that the treasurer should have opposed $42 
million in pension fund benefits voted for top GM management. Brown argues that 
ownership of other stock should be used to generate more environmental and 
social consciousness among U.S. corporations. Hayes strongly disagrees, arguing 
that "government should not get involved in corporate affairs. 
</P>
<P>
For now at least, Brown is continuing a big fund-raising lead over incumbent 
Hayes. In the latest reporting period, Brown had $1.18 million in the bank, 
compared to $252,768 for Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
When they aren't slinging barbs at each other or talking about investment 
strategies, both Hayes and Brown can be charming. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it's Brown talking about a son "leaving the nest" to begin his freshman 
year in college or Hayes talking excitedly about his daughter's next soccer 
game, the candidates rarely miss a chance to mention their children. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, who probably would still be auditor general if the Legislature had 
confirmed Deukmejian's first choice to succeed Unruh -- former Rep. Daniel 
Lungren -- at times seems nonplussed about being in politics. He often defines 
his priorities as "family, job and politics, in that order." 
</P>
<P>
Brown grew up in politics, moving to Sacramento in grade school after her 
father was elected governor, watching her brother win the governorship in 1974 
and winning an election herself to the Los Angeles Board of Education in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, when she recently turned 45, she used her birthday as an opportunity 
to raise money for her campaign, picking up $1,000 a person at Chasen's, the 
Beverly Hills restaurant. She said that was a trick she learned from her 
father. "My mother likes to say my father never considered it a birthday unless 
he celebrated it in five cities and raised X numbers of dollars," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But, while Brown owes much to her family, the connection also has hurt her. A 
favorite line of hers is that she has three great assets: being a woman, a 
Democrat and a Brown. At the same time, she has three great liabilities: She is 
a woman, a Democrat and a Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the campaign, Brown has been needled about being "Jerry Brown's 
little sister." Roger Ailes, the Washington-based media consultant hired to 
prepare Hayes' television commercials, referred to her as "Sister Moonbeam," a 
reference to the "Gov. Moonbeam" name pinned on the former governor by his 
detractors. 
</P>
<P>
Ailes, who Kathleen Brown refers to as Hayes' "hired assassin," called the race 
"Kathleen Brown's debutante coming-out party in politics so that she can one 
day be queen of California." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes also has questioned Brown's decision to leave her job on the Los Angeles 
Board of Education midway through her second term to move to New York when her 
husband, former news executive Van Gordon Sauter, took a top job with CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, noting that Brown also left a job as an appointed Los Angeles public 
works commissioner, said "she walked away from two jobs" and asks, "Why won't 
she walk away from this one, too?" 
</P>
<P>
Brown said of the move to New York: "It was a tough choice, but I made it out 
of what I thought were the best interests of my family and my constituents." 
She said bi-coastal marriages were in vogue at the time, but such an 
arrangement would have made her a part-time school board member and a part-time 
mother and wife, an arrangement she found intolerable. 
</P>
<P>
In between jobs as a school board member and public works commissioner, Brown 
worked as a public finance attorney in New York and Los Angeles for the law 
firm of O'Melveny &amp; Myers, giving rise to her self-description as "the 
financial Brown." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes has no famous politicians in his family, but he has received much needed 
support from the Deukmejian political family. Hayes' campaign manager is Donna 
Lucas, a former Deukmejian press deputy, and the treasurer is getting campaign 
advice from Sacramento attorney Steven A. Merksamer, Deukmejian's former chief 
of staff, and Larry Thomas, the governor's former press secretary. Hayes also 
is getting a significant amount of help raising money from Karl Samuelian, 
Deukmejian's chief fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a twist, Hayes is getting help from a former Jerry Brown ally. Early 
on, he hired B. T. Collins, former chief of staff to Brown, as a top deputy 
treasurer and political trouble-shooter.

</P>
<P>
EPA CHIEF QUESTIONS PROVISIONS OF 'BIG GREEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief William K. Reilly joined the 
controversy over a sweeping environmental initiative on the November ballot, 
calling it potentially costly and disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
In remarks to reporters after a speech at a clean air conference in Los 
Angeles, Reilly stopped short of taking a position on Proposition 128, known as 
"Big Green" by its supporters, saying: "I will observe with fascination what 
California does with it." 
</P>
<P>
The EPA administrator, who was also in California to boost the Republican 
gubernatorial campaign of U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, raised questions about the 
initiative, which Wilson opposes. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative could result in fairly significant new taxes on gasoline and 
other fuels because of provisions that call for a 40% reduction in carbon 
dioxide emissions by 2010, Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
He questioned the scientific basis of "novel" sections that would outlaw trace 
amounts of pesticides on food if laboratory tests concluded that they caused 
cancer in animals when ingested in high doses. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be disruptive and obviously involves setting up a very different 
pesticide registration testing program than exists for the rest of the U.S. Yet 
if it passes, we will do everything we can to work with it," Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly also questioned whether it makes sense for California to reduce the use 
of chemicals that destroy the upper atmosphere's protective ozone layer four 
years earlier than 2000, the year called for in the Montreal Protocol, a treaty 
signed by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative calls for phasing out chlorofluorocarbons by Dec. 31, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a question of whether it makes sense to go down that road when 
after a great deal of scientific analysis and international negotiations the 
world community has agreed on the year 2000," Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly said the additional time was allowed by the treaty so more energy 
efficient substitutes could be developed. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an awful lot in Big Green," Reilly added. "It would appear to have 
very significant costs associated with it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Wilson was concerned about the creation of an elected 
statewide environmental advocate. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly said other provisions in the initiative are praiseworthy. 
</P>
<P>
He said the ballot measure, though costly, would not be ruinous to the economy 
and could promote savings through energy conservation. Reilly said that if the 
initiative fails, he hoped it would not mark a turning point in public support 
for environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"If it fails, I think one would only point to how extremely inclusive and 
ambitious it is and then speculate perhaps if fewer (proposals) had been 
involved, if the costs had been lower and schedules somewhat different that the 
result might have been different," Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the opening day of a three-day California Clean Air and New 
Technologies conference at the Los Angeles Bonaventure Hotel, Reilly said the 
public and private cost of environmental regulation in the United States will 
rise to $200 billion annually by 2000, or up to 3% of the gross national 
product -- twice the current level. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly said Congress was close to enacting "the most sweeping and innovative 
clean air act in American history." He said that the Bush Administration is 
concerned that Congress may not complete work before adjourning later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
He also criticized provisions of the bill being hammered out in a House-Senate 
conference committee, particularly an amendment to provide up to $250 million 
to retrain coal miners who might lose their jobs because of the bill's limits 
on sulfur dioxide emissions from coal that cause acid rain. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that is bad economic policy, bad social policy and certainly bad 
environmental policy," Reilly told reporters. "And we don't trust the ceiling 
of $250 million." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the President would veto the bill if that provision remained, Reilly 
replied, "I am not going to talk about a veto right now. We're much more 
concerned to encourage the Congress to move with dispatch on the legislation. . 
. . Our concern is very much to get a bill that the President can sign."

Amid tentative signs of change in North Korea, South Korean Prime Minister Kang 
Young Hoon today crossed the Demilitarized Zone to become the first chief of a 
Cabinet in the south ever to visit the Communist north. 
</P>
<P>
Kang, accompanied by six other officials and a staff of 33, is scheduled to 
arrive in Pyongyang this afternoon for a four-day visit. However, South Korean 
officials said they expect few results from the talks, which reciprocate a 
visit to Seoul on Sept. 4-7 by North Korean Prime Minister Yon Hyung Muk. Those 
meetings failed to produce any agreements. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither prime minister exercises independent power in his own right, 
the exchange marks the highest level of North and South Korean officials to 
meet in 18 years of off-and-on attempts to ease tension between the two 
nations. About 43,000 U.S. troops are still stationed in South Korea, 40 years 
after the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, President Roh Tae Woo gave Kang an oral message to deliver when he 
meets North Korean President Kim Il Sung on Thursday. In it, Roh reportedly 
urges the 78-year-old Stalinist leader to agree to hold the first north-south 
summit meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Roh also reportedly will assure Kim that South Korea -- which on Sept. 30 
established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, the north's chief ally 
-- has no interest in isolating the north and will propose that both Korean 
governments "recognize each other's existence." 
</P>
<P>
Crossing the heavily fortified border at the truce village of Panmunjom, Kang 
said: "This military demarcation zone . . . is the wall of mistrust and 
confrontation that has caused numerous tragedies and agonies to our people in 
the past 40 years, including the separation of 10 million family members. We 
are going to Pyongyang to bring about the spring of peace and cooperation by 
melting down this frozen wall." 
</P>
<P>
Despite South Korean expressions of pessimism, the talks are occurring in the 
aftermath of a series of apparent changes in North Korean attitudes over the 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
Only three days before Seoul and Moscow declared they were establishing 
relations, North Korea for the first time agreed to open talks on setting up 
diplomatic ties with Japan, Korea's former colonial master. 
</P>
<P>
Kang's trip to the north also follows a series of friendly grass-roots gestures 
that began with Koreans from both north and south cheering jointly for their 
separate sports teams at the recent Asian Games in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
The first sports exchange between the two countries, a soccer game that the 
north won 2 to 1, was held in Pyongyang on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
And on Sunday, the first private group of South Koreans to visit North Korea, a 
band of 14 traditional musicians, accompanied by three reporters, received a 
warm welcome in Pyongyang, where they will perform concerts, some with North 
Korean musicians, until Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
At the least, the prime ministers' talks are expected to provide a reading of 
whether Pyongyang's about-face in seeking diplomatic relations with Japan 
represents a potential opening of its closed society. 
</P>
<P>
Among the agreements reached by the North Korean Workers Party and a mission of 
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party were calls for an opening of a direct 
air route between Tokyo and Pyongyang, stepped-up economic exchange and North 
Korean use of Japanese satellite facilities. 
</P>
<P>
One highly placed South Korean source said the two governments might agree to 
unprecedented barter trade of South Korean rice for North Korean potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, North Korea, which has portrayed the South as a poor, struggling 
nation in its domestic propaganda, has refused consistently to accept South 
Korean offers of economic assistance or direct trade.

TUBERCULOSIS NOW THE DEADLIEST DISEASE AS TOLL CLIMBS

<P>
Tuberculosis has become the world's deadliest infectious disease, and the toll 
could soon rise even more dramatically if controls are not initiated quickly, 
the World Health Organization said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency, in its first comprehensive look at global tuberculosis in a 
decade, said the disease kills nearly 3 million people a year, most of them 
between the ages of 15 and 59, "the segment of the population that is 
economically most productive." 
</P>
<P>
WHO attributed the sharp rise in part to the growing AIDS epidemic. It 
estimated that about 3 million people worldwide are dually infected with the 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, and tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
"It is becoming a parallel epidemic, and it is this trend that has public 
health officials worried," Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, director general of WHO, said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The agency estimated that between 15 million and 20 million adults will be 
infected with HIV by the year 2000, and it predicted that the number of cases 
and deaths from tuberculosis will rise sharply as a result, especially in 
sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
"These new data have been stunning to everyone, because an awful lot of people 
had thought that tuberculosis had gone away," said Dr. Barry Bloom, a professor 
of microbiology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and a 
consultant to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Tuberculosis is a highly communicable disease of the lungs and other organs 
caused by a bacterium transmitted through the air when infected people cough or 
sneeze. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 8 million new cases of tuberculosis a year, according to the 
U.N. agency. About half of these are infectious. Also, an estimated 1.7 billion 
individuals worldwide carry the organism but are not infectious to others. In 
these individuals, the organism can remain dormant without causing active 
disease for many years unless the immune system is somehow impaired. AIDS, or 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys the body's immune system. 
</P>
<P>
An individual does not have to have a damaged immune system to contract an 
active case of tuberculosis. But when a case of tuberculosis becomes active, as 
it can in individuals who carry the organism, that person can also infect 
numerous others. This is what is happening in developing nations, where the 
AIDS epidemic is raging. 
</P>
<P>
"In many places, more than half the beds in medical wards are patients with 
tuberculosis," Bloom said. "Many of these people do, in fact, die of AIDS. But 
if they're not treated for tuberculosis, those people will be spreading the 
disease (tuberculosis) in their communities. You don't have to have a depressed 
immune system to get tuberculosis." 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, public health officials began to recognize about five 
years ago that tuberculosis -- after steadily declining since the 1950s -- was 
making a surprising comeback as a result of the AIDS epidemic. At that time, 
they noticed a startling and unexpected drop in the rate of decline of 
tuberculosis cases. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Bloom said, the number of cases of active tuberculosis in the United 
States is up nearly 5% over last year, with 23,495 new cases. 
</P>
<P>
The overall incidence of tuberculosis in the United States is 9.5 cases per 
100,000 population, he said. In New York City, which has the highest number of 
AIDS cases in the nation, the incidence is 36 per 100,000, Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
Effective drugs to combat tuberculosis cost about $30 to $50 per person, given 
over six months. 
</P>
<P>
However, the drugs are not always available in developing countries, and 
compliance is a major problem. The drugs must be taken for the entire six 
months to eliminate the infection.

SHAMIR ASSAILS U.S. MIDEAST POLICIES;

ISRAEL: WASHINGTON'S STRENGTHENED TIES WITH ARABS ARE A SLAP IN THE FACE, HE 
SAYS. THE GROWING TENSION IS AN UNEXPECTED TURN IN THE GULF CRISIS.

Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, in a grim speech to the Israeli Parliament, 
attacked key pillars of U.S. policy in the Middle East on Monday, adding a 
bitter note to the strained relations between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir made no direct reference to the United States or the Bush 
Administration, but he referred clearly to short- and long-term Administration 
policy in the region, including a massive arms sale to Saudi Arabia, efforts to 
arrange Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and the promotion of close relations 
with Arab countries, even if they are hostile to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Israel is "expected to put up with the renewed and massive supply of arms of 
advanced weapons to those states, to agree to negotiations with the terrorist 
organizations and to ignore the words of incitement and hatred that are 
constantly voiced and written in the Arab states," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
"Each time, reality comes and slaps anew the faces of those who hold with 
theories of moderation. But the lesson is not learned. . . . Israel will not 
pay the price of the lessons that the international community must extract from 
this gloomy reality." 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also repeated his government's rejection of a U.N. Security 
Council plan to send a mission to investigate the police shooting of 
Palestinians in a riot last week in Jerusalem. The United States helped draft 
the U.N. resolution, which expressed condemnation of Israel and authorized the 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's attack on Washington's overall Middle East policy came as a surprise 
in light of the critical state of affairs in the region, with U.S. troops 
massed in Saudi Arabia against Iraqi forces in Kuwait, which Iraq invaded on 
Aug. 2. Israel, at Washington's behest, has kept out of the Kuwaiti crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir accused the United Nations of hypocrisy and listed several terrorist 
attacks on Israelis that passed without censure by the international body. In 
this case, Shamir said, the Security Council ignored the danger of stones 
hurled at Jewish worshipers at the Temple Mount. 
</P>
<P>
"What stood out was the absence of any mention of the grave attack on the 
Jewish people's holiest place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir rejected any U.N. role in Jerusalem, which Israel considers under its 
sovereignty, although much of the world thinks the status of the city is still 
a matter to be negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
In a direct reference to the Persian Gulf crisis, Shamir once again warned Iraq 
against setting foot in neighboring Jordan, and he declared that Israel will 
strike back if attacked. 
</P>
<P>
To many Israeli observers, the growing tension between Washington and Jerusalem 
is an unexpected turn of events. In August, when the Persian Gulf crisis broke, 
Israeli officials predicted with some relief a renaissance of relations with 
the United States, its chief ally and benefactor: no more pressure to resolve 
its conflict with Palestinians, no more criticism of its dealings with Arabs or 
its settlements on occupied land. 
</P>
<P>
Field conditions had changed, some analysts said, and Israel's role as 
America's dependable ally in the ever more dangerous Middle East would eclipse 
the disagreements of the recent past. 
</P>
<P>
This view, it develops, was optimistic, and Israel is having to face the 
reality that the shifting landscape in the Middle East does not necessarily 
mean easier times. The Palestinian issue, seemingly in regression, was thrust 
back into the spotlight last week by the killing of Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than putting aside complaints about Israel's treatment of Palestinians 
or the reluctance of Shamir's government to enter peace talks, Washington voted 
for the U.N. resolution that condemned Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel's strategic role was muffled. The Bush Administration told 
Israel to keep a low military profile so that Washington's Arab allies against 
Iraq might not suffer the charge of being "stooges" of Zionism. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials attribute U.S. criticism of its handling of the Jerusalem 
incident to a debt Washington owes to Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia for joining 
an American-led force to force Iraq out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
But this view ignores Washington's longer-range concern with the Palestinian 
issue, observers say: Having grown accustomed to a U.S. shield against U.N. 
censure, Israel appears to have put out of its mind a long string of U.S. 
warnings over its handling of the Palestinian conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The Shamir government also saw little diplomatic risk in the long standoff with 
the Palestinians and had resisted American-brokered proposals for peace talks 
over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with Washington tied to contradictory alliances, there is talk that once 
Kuwait is out of the way, the Palestinian issue will become a priority item on 
the international agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Already, with the United Nations affirming that the Arab districts of Jerusalem 
are "occupied," Israel is on the defensive in the city it sees as entirely its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts warn that the U.N. position may make peace talks even more 
difficult than expected because Israel is being pushed into a corner. 
</P>
<P>
"We are starting at the most difficult issue -- Jerusalem -- and this is not 
helpful," political commentator Aryeh Naor cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir is taking steps to confirm the inviolability of Jerusalem by expanding 
housing programs in Arab districts of the city -- but the price of this may 
well be a further strain with Washington, which has never recognized Israel's 
1967 annexation of the city's eastern sector. 
</P>
<P>
Israel also has overlooked the emergence of the United Nations as a key 
problem-solving tool, some observers say. 
</P>
<P>
It was safe to ignore the United Nations, which is highly suspect in the eyes 
of the Israeli government for its traditional pro-Palestinian tilt, as long as 
the U.S. veto was in place. When Washington changes its mind, Israel finds 
itself in full isolation.

U.S. URGES ISRAEL TO ACCEPT U.N.'S INVESTIGATION

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration, increasingly concerned that fallout from a bloody riot 
in Jerusalem is interfering with U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf, urged the 
Israeli government Monday to accept a United Nations investigation because 
continued resistance would let Iraq "off the hook." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials, who believed that they had averted a split in the international 
coalition against Iraq when they persuaded the U.N. Security Council to vote a 
mild censure of Israel, were shocked when Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he 
would not cooperate with a U.N. investigation of the killing of 21 Palestinian 
demonstrators by Israeli security forces. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to see that U.N. resolution fully implemented," President Bush told 
reporters aboard Air Force One on the flight from Washington to Dallas at the 
start of a two-day political trip to Texas and the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
"We were part of it, and we think it's the right step," he added. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the U.S. government is 
"disappointed that the Israeli government has decided not to cooperate with the 
mission." Later, she said: "We would like to see this issue concluded, and we 
hope that Israel will find a way to work with the secretary general's 
representative." 
</P>
<P>
From the Bush Administration's standpoint, the incident last week on 
Jerusalem's Temple Mount -- and Israel's refusal to accept blame for use of 
excess force -- is damaging on two levels: 
</P>
<P>
First, it threatens to divert attention from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait at a 
time when Washington had hoped to sharpen the political and economic sanctions 
against President Saddam Hussein's government. U.S. officials plan to ask the 
U.N. Security Council to take additional steps against Iraq soon, probably 
starting with a threat to bring war crimes charges against Hussein for 
atrocities against civilians in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, by complaining that the United States had betrayed Israel because of 
its preoccupation with the Persian Gulf situation, Israeli authorities have 
saddled the Administration with a potentially damaging domestic political row. 
The controversy raises new questions about U.S. objectives in the gulf at a 
time when the Administration is struggling to prevent erosion of public support 
for its Middle East policy. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler attempted to deal with the second problem by arguing that "our sense 
of concern over Israel's handling of the situation would have led us to support 
(the U.N. Security Council) action regardless of the situation in the gulf." 
</P>
<P>
However, Secretary of State James A. Baker III warned Israel that Shamir's 
refusal to cooperate with the U.N. mission both damages the campaign against 
Iraq and threatens to push Israel into the same category as Baghdad -- nations 
that defy Security Council resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's warning was telephoned to the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv on Saturday with 
instructions that it be passed along to Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy as 
soon as possible, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government had intended to keep the message secret, but a leaked 
account of it was published in Israel on Monday. A U.S. official said the 
published account accurately reflected the substance of the U.S. warning. 
</P>
<P>
"The aggression of Saddam Hussein is the real issue the world should be 
concerned about," Baker said, according to the Israeli account. "We want to 
keep that in focus, and you too should do that. This week we are requesting to 
go back to the Security Council with a new resolution on Iraqi aggression. 
Let's not let Saddam Hussein off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish to emphasize that if Israel rejects the Security Council decision, 
there will be some who will compare you, even though it is not justified, to 
Saddam Hussein and his rejection of Security Council decisions," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
At the United Nations in New York, Israel's decision to resist the secretary 
general's mission set off an intense round of behind-the scenes negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar directed Johanan Bein, Israel's U.N. 
representative, to ask his government if it would accept U.N. investigators 
after an Israeli commission finishes its report on the Jerusalem killings. 
</P>
<P>
It is understood that Perez de Cuellar suggested that U.N. fact-finders could 
be given access, either in New York or in Israel, to some of the testimony 
taken by the Israeli commission. Perez de Cuellar also asked for additional 
clarifications of the Israeli position. 
</P>
<P>
Bein said that during his meeting in the secretary general's offices, he 
delivered "a full explanation why the government of Israel would not receive 
the delegation." 
</P>
<P>
"I transmitted to the secretary general the decision of the government of 
Israel which was announced on Sunday and which explains why the government of 
Israel regards the Security Council resolution as completely one-sided and 
therefore completely unacceptable," he said. "We have established an 
independent commission of inquiry to establish the facts and draw conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, by asking for clarifications, the secretary general appeared 
to have bought several days to continue his efforts to find means for the U.N. 
mission to visit Jerusalem in a way that it can carry out its fact-finding 
mandate.

MEXICO'S TOUGH DRUG CZAR LOSES HIS JOB 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mexico's controversial drug czar, Javier Coello Trejo, was removed from his 
post Monday after repeated charges that federal anti-narcotics police under his 
authority committed widespread human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
Coello, 42, was named Monday night as federal attorney general for the 
consumer, a position that officials portrayed as a promotion but which, in 
reality, is far less powerful than his old job. 
</P>
<P>
As deputy attorney general since December, 1988, the robust, chain-smoking 
Coello has overseen the Mexican Federal Judicial Police assigned to combatting 
narcotics production and trafficking. Heroin poppy and marijuana crops are 
grown illegally in Mexico, and the country is a major transshipment route for 
U.S.-bound South American cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
During Coello's tenure, Mexican police have seized a record 75 tons of cocaine 
and jailed drug lord Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, reputedly the top cocaine 
supplier to the U.S. West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
American officials have lauded Coello's aggressiveness in fighting narcotics 
trafficking and his close cooperation with the Drug Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been great. This is a blow," said a U.S. official. "The whole success of 
the large cocaine seizures can be attributed to his planning and management of 
these operations." 
</P>
<P>
But at home, politicians and human rights activists have been far more critical 
of Coello's leadership. Half a dozen governors have protested violence 
committed by the Federal Judicial Police in their states, as has the National 
Human Rights Commission, created by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari last 
June. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-based Americas Watch human rights group issued a report in June 
charging that "federal narcotics police are accountable for a large number of 
cases of murder, torture and abuse of process in Mexico today. Extortion and 
robbery are also frequent elements of federal police operations." 
</P>
<P>
And last month, in special hearings before a subcommittee of the U.S. House 
Committee on Foreign Relations, Deputy Asst. Secretary of State Sally G. Cowal 
said that "chief among our human rights concerns in Mexico is mistreatment of 
detainees by Mexican police, particularly the Mexican Federal Judicial Police . 
. . (which) has traditionally enjoyed considerable immunity from prosecution 
for its human rights abuses." 
</P>
<P>
Rights activists applauded Coello's removal but said the government must go 
further to restructure the police and judicial system, particularly to 
eliminate the use in court of confessions extracted in police custody. They 
said they believe Coello was removed to ease international criticism of Mexico 
as the government tries to negotiate a free trade agreement with the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
A government source said Coello is to be replaced by Jorge Carrillo Olea, an 
army colonel who has been serving as director general of national security.

IRAQ EMBARGO STARTING TO BITE, CHENEY REPORTS;

SANCTIONS: BUT HE SAYS U.S. IS PREPARED TO KEEP TROOPS IN SAUDI ARABIA FOR 
YEARS, IF NECESSARY.

<P>
The global economic embargo against Iraq has begun to erode the capabilities of 
President Saddam Hussein's military and could threaten his domestic political 
position, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, in London for meetings on the Persian Gulf crisis with British Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher and Defense Secretary Tom King, said the sanctions 
against Hussein "are beginning to tell on his economy and his ability to 
sustain his military machine." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney cautioned that the sanctions should be allowed to run their course 
before any offensive military action is contemplated. He said the United States 
is prepared to keep troops in the Arabian desert for years, if necessary, to 
enforce demands that Iraq withdraw from occupied Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The sanctions and the embargo are beginning to have an impact," Cheney said, 
in the most optimistic assessment yet by a senior U.S. official of the effect 
of the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the next few months, (Hussein) will see the erosion of his political base 
within Iraq, the erosion of the economy within Iraq, an erosion of the 
capability of the enormous military machine that he's deployed in Kuwait and 
against Saudi Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
When pressed to provide evidence that Hussein could face growing political 
opposition at home, however, Cheney acknowledged that he was speculating on a 
possible outcome of Iraq's mounting economic and military problems. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein has led Iraq virtually without opposition since taking power in 1979 by 
ruthlessly eliminating any resistance. He maintains one of the Third World's 
largest and most effective internal security systems to suppress dissent and 
ensure the continued dominance of the Arab Baath Socialist Party. 
</P>
<P>
There is no sign of any political opposition in Iraq, but the United States 
does have evidence that Iraq's military force of 430,000 men in Kuwait and 
southern Iraq is suffering from shortages of supplies and growing morale 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said that situation could prove to be the flash point for war between 
Iraq and the American-led multinational force in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
In Iraq, Information Minister Latif Jasim told reporters he believes his 
country is in imminent danger of being attacked but will not fire the first 
shot. He insisted that "Kuwait is the 19th province of Iraq, and this fact will 
not be changed, even if we fight a long war." 
</P>
<P>
In another development, 15 Spanish nationals reached Jordan from Iraq, making 
Spain the first European Community country to see all its hostages safely out 
of Iraq. Seven Spanish diplomats remain in Baghdad on a voluntary basis. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, in an interview Monday with the British Broadcasting Corp., said the 
two periods of "greatest danger" in the gulf region were early in the 
deployment of allied troops, when they were too weak to challenge an Iraqi 
invasion of Saudi Arabia, and over the next few months, "when the sanctions 
really begin to bite." 
</P>
<P>
As shortages mount in Iraq and Baghdad finds it increasingly difficult to 
supply its huge army, Cheney said, Hussein "might then choose to use his 
military (to try to break the sanctions) rather than see it degraded over a 
period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Should Iraq attack, "we would respond very forcefully," Cheney said. But he 
would not elaborate on the form that the U.S. response would take. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney will leave London today for Moscow, where he will meet with President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Defense 
Minister Dmitri T. Yazov. It is only the second visit of a U.S. defense chief 
to the Soviet Union since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The talks will focus on the gulf, the evolving new security arrangements in 
Europe and on arms control initiatives, officials said.

CHESS GAME ADJOURNED; EARLY KASPAROV MOVES STUN EXPERTS

Chess champion Garry Kasparov and challenger Anatoly Karpov resumed their 
grudge match Monday, but the game was adjourned for the night after nobody won 
within the alloted time. 
</P>
<P>
The game, which is to be resumed today, was the third in the championship 
match. 
</P>
<P>
Kasparov, 27, the highest-rated player in the history of chess, leads 1 1/2 
points to 1/2 points in the 24-game title match against Karpov, 39, whom he 
unseated as world champion in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Reuters reported that Kasparov's opening ploy involved sacrificing a rook for a 
bishop. While grandmasters were shaking their heads in bewilderment over that 
move, the champion stunned them further by sacrificing his queen -- the game's 
most powerful piece -- for two lesser pieces. 
</P>
<P>
In the adjourned position, Karpov has a king, rook, bishop, knight and four 
pawns. Kasparov has a king, two bishops, a knight and five pawns. These are the 
moves for the third game in algebraic notation. Karpov (white) and Kasparov

DIDN'T LIE TO COUPLE WHO HIRED HER TO BEAR CHILD, SURROGATE MOTHER SAYS

Surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson testified Monday that the infertile couple who 
hired her to bear their baby should not have trusted her to give up the child, 
but she denied that she misled or lied to them about her intent to keep the 
infant. 
</P>
<P>
Under four hours of intense questioning, Johnson repeatedly fended off 
accusations from the baby's lawyer that she is a liar, and insisted she had the 
right to change her mind and keep the child she agreed to bear for Mark and 
Crispina Calvert for $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 29, wrote a July 23 letter to the Calverts, demanding they pay her the 
remaining $5,000 or they would "not get the baby." 
</P>
<P>
Questioned by the Calverts' lawyer, Christian R. Van Deusen, Johnson testified 
Monday that even if the couple had paid the money by her deadline, she still 
would not have agreed to give up the child. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson denied Van Deusen's suggestion that she was lying by implicitly 
promising to surrender the child if the payment was made. She said she simply 
"changed my mind." 
</P>
<P>
"Are you saying the Calverts should have been more circumspect about believing 
what they heard coming from you?" Van Deusen asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess," Johnson answered. 
</P>
<P>
"Weren't you deceiving the Calverts into believing that if they complied with 
the letter you'd turn over the child?" Van Deusen asked. 
</P>
<P>
"If they so chose to believe," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The proceeding in Orange County Superior Court marks the first time a surrogate 
mother has sought legal parental status even though she is not genetically 
related to the child she bore. The Calverts have temporary custody of the baby.

NEA APPROPRIATIONS TAKE UNUSUAL PATH;

ARTS: THE HOUSE ADDS THE ENTIRE TEXT OF A BILL ON EXTENDING THE AGENCY TO A 
FUNDING MEASURE. OPPOSITION LED BY SEN. HELMS IS LIKELY.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Employing unusual parliamentary tactics, the House of Representatives voted 
Monday to attach provisions of a bill it had approved last week to renew the 
legal mandate of the National Endowment for the Arts to a separate measure that 
would fund the agency in fiscal 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The 234-171 vote sends the bill to the Senate, which is expected to consider it 
later this week. 
</P>
<P>
The provisions added to the appropriation bill contain no language barring 
specific kinds of art from being supported by the NEA -- except for a general 
ban on funding of work that is judged obscene by a criminal court. The bill 
also includes an admonition to the arts endowment, however, to refrain from 
supporting "indecency" and art that does not "respect the diverse beliefs and 
values of the American public." 
</P>
<P>
The House action in Washington on Monday night was unusual because it took the 
entire text of the bill passed last Thursday, extending the NEA for three 
years, and added it to the 1991 appropriation measure. Rep. Jamie L. Whitten 
(D-Miss.), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and a veteran of half 
a century in Congress, said that he did not remember ever seeing such a 
parliamentary device. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, the legislation is expected to face opposition from 
conservatives led by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). 
</P>
<P>
The money bill passed Monday includes $180 million for the arts endowment. The 
bill is an omnibus measure that appropriates $14.5 billion for the Interior 
Department and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Before approving the measure, the House voted down an amendment by Rep. Ralph 
Regula (R-Ohio), that would have prohibited the NEA from supporting art 
inappropriate for a "general audience" or that was obscene or indecent. To 
establish indecency, the amendment would have relied on a U.S. Supreme Court 
case written to regulate radio and television broadcasting and never applied to 
other artistic media. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual legislative tactic was proposed by Reps. E. Thomas Coleman (R-Mo.) 
and Pat Williams (D-Mont.), who argued that the move was necessary because of 
the logjam of money bills that face Congress as it rushes to adjourn. 
</P>
<P>
Williams contended that the Senate, which has not yet taken up either an NEA 
reauthorization or appropriation bill, may not get to the reauthorization 
measure before Congress adjourns. Appropriations bills, however, are all likely 
to come to a vote since they must be passed to keep government agencies 
operating. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the amendment tactic was the only way to ensure that an NEA bill 
largely free of restrictions on artistic content reaches President Bush. "This 
will assure that something that the House wants will reach the President's 
desk," Williams said.

SAN DIEGO SERIAL KILLINGS REMAIN A MYSTERY; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE LEADS CONTINUE TO POUR IN -- 2,200 AT LAST COUNT -- BUT LOCAL POLICE 
SAY THEY ARE NO CLOSER TO CATCHING WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STABBING 
DEATHS OF FIVE WOMEN.

<P>
Police have received 2,200 leads in connection with the serial stabbing deaths 
of five women but are no closer to catching the killer, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"A piece is still missing," said Police Capt. Dick Toneck. "If I had something 
to bring forth in the way of an arrest, I would relish that. But as it stands, 
we're sifting through all the clues and all the tips people have phoned in. 
We're just hoping one will lead to an arrest." 
</P>
<P>
The case has received widespread attention in San Diego, where Police Chief Bob 
Burgreen labeled it the largest manhunt in the city's history and the 
department's first priority. Toneck said the 33 investigators working the case 
full time have called back virtually everyone who has phoned with information. 
</P>
<P>
Since Jan. 12, four women between the ages of 18 and 21 have been killed inside 
their homes in the middle of the day after their assailant apparently entered 
through an unlocked or open door. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth victim, 42-year-old Pamela Gail Clark, was the mother of one of the 
victims, 18-year-old Amber Clark. Both were stabbed inside their home in 
University City on Sept. 13. The three other women lived within two blocks of 
one another in a row of apartment houses in the nearby community of Clairemont. 
</P>
<P>
The manhunt and subsequent publicity led to a run on locks and security devices 
at local stores. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Toneck, one of seven ranking officers assigned to the case full 
time, acknowledged that investigators are uncertain whether the killer is still 
in the San Diego area or has fled. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have anything to indicate (the suspect) is still here," the captain 
said. "We don't have any leads to tell us where he may be." 
</P>
<P>
Toneck said the leads had given police a range of possible suspects "who fit 
the (suspect's) description; and yet, those are not the people. Their 
backgrounds, their whereabouts, just don't fit."

<P>
The San Diego Police Department made a controversial arrest shortly after the 
third killing in early April when a Puerto Rican-born man -- a decorated 
ex-Marine -- was followed for weeks and finally detained because he closely 
resembled a composite drawing of the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
He was cleared shortly after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, San Diego police ruled out any link between the serial slayings and 
a man arrested on suspicion of rape in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
The Clairemont-University City suspect is said to be a light-skinned black 
male, 5-foot-7 to 5-foot-10, with medium build and short, dark, curly hair. He 
was briefly seen by a painter as he ran from the Clairemont apartment where 
18-year-old Holly Suzanne Tarr was killed on April 3. 
</P>
<P>
It is that one sighting upon which the widely distributed composite of the 
suspect is based. 
</P>
<P>
Toneck said a psychological profile prepared for the San Diego Police 
Department by the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va., indicates the killer is a loner 
and "disorganized" in his methods of operation. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe the weapon used in each of the killings was obtained at the 
scene. In every case but the first, investigators later found knives believed 
to have been the killer's weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Although he appears to be a loner, "there's no doubt that somebody -- a loved 
one, a neighbor, a close friend -- knows this guy," Toneck said. "We just don't 
know why this person hasn't called in and said, 'I know this guy.' We're hoping 
that will happen." 
</P>
<P>
Toneck said the number of investigators working the case was recently scaled 
back, from 34 to 33, and that $145,000 has been spent investigating the 
slayings. He said the number of detectives working the case "may be scaled back 
further at the point where the leads start to diminish." 
</P>
<P>
Police are concerned, Toneck said, that residents may grow complacent and stop 
taking precautions. 
</P>
<P>
"This person is still around, still out and about, so please lock your doors in 
the daytime, be aware of your surroundings, get to know your neighbors and have 
your neighbors know you. Know the routines of one another at all times," Toneck 
advised.

DROWN MUST TESTIFY ON DUFFY AND JAIL ABUSE; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: SHERIFF'S CANDIDATE OPPOSES TIMING OF HIS APPEARANCE AT 
HEARING, TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Assistant Sheriff Jack Drown has been subpoenaed to testify two weeks before 
the Nov. 6 election about Sheriff John Duffy and allegations of inmate abuse by 
a so-called "Rambo Squad" of deputies who were disciplined for jail beatings. 
</P>
<P>
Although Drown said he has no new information about what went on in County Jail 
at El Cajon, or what led to the punishment of 10 deputies for alleged abuse 
there, his attorney has fought attempts to have Drown testify at the Oct. 24 
county Civil Service Commission hearing and asked that his appearance be 
delayed until after the election. 
</P>
<P>
Drown, whom Duffy endorsed just after announcing last year that he would not be 
running for a sixth term, is running against Sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache in what 
polls show to be a close race. Roache won the June primary, gathering 32% of 
the vote to Drown's 28%. 
</P>
<P>
The commission hearing is an appeal by Sheriff's Capt. Maudie Bobbitt of her 
35-day suspension without pay in late 1989. Duffy suspended her for "failure to 
take appropriate steps to investigate various allegations of mistreatment of 
prisoners at (El Cajon) by a number of deputies," according to attorney Martin 
J. Mayer, who is representing both Duffy and Drown. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbitt was one of 10 deputies and officers disciplined for alleged abuses at 
the El Cajon jail as part of the "Rambo Squad," which the county grand jury 
said tormented and abused prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbitt was the jail's highest-ranking officer, and is the only Sheriff's 
Department official whose case has not been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, attorney Everett Bobbitt, said Duffy singled out his wife for 
punishment, even though the grand jury criticized the inner workings of all 
county jails. Bobbitt said Duffy dislikes him for a series of court victories 
the attorney has won over the years, including one that allowed Roache to run 
for sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbitt, who is representing his wife, said he will ask Drown why, as his 
wife's supervisor, he did not review her suspension, as is normal practice. 
Drown said he was not Maudie Bobbitt's supervisor when the alleged abuses 
occurred. But she said Drown was her supervisor at the time the suspension was 
handed down, which required him to review the punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Everett Bobbitt also said Drown has told him in a tape-recorded interview taken 
as part of his wife's case that that he has not reviewed the department's 
investigation into the alleged jail beatings, a claim that Bobbitt says makes 
Drown an uninterested administrator. 
</P>
<P>
"I will attempt to link Drown and Duffy together as two people who mishandled 
my wife's case," he said. "Already, there is a thinly veiled attempt to protect 
Duffy and Jack Drown from testifying." 
</P>
<P>
Mayer, the attorney for Duffy and Drown, asked Bobbitt in August to continue 
the hearing until after the election. 
</P>
<P>
"As you can appreciate, it is vital that (Drown) be able to devote his 
undivided attention to his election campaign," Mayer said. " . . . It seems to 
me that the best way to avoid unnecessary controversy would be a short 
postponement of the hearing, so that Mr. Drown's appearance would take place 
after the election." 
</P>
<P>
Commission hearing officer Richard Lyon said he would not delay the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer also has asked Lyon to exclude certain evidence in the case, including 
the possible motive Duffy might have had in suspending Maudie Bobbitt, whether 
Duffy had condoned abuse at the jails, whether Duffy chose to investigate 
brutality allegations at other jails and, if not, whether abuse occurred at 
other jails. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon is expected to rule Wednesday on whether the evidence should be admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy could not be reached for comment Monday. In a letter to the grand jury in 
August, 1989, Duffy said his own internal investigation confirmed the existence 
of the "Rambo Squad." 
</P>
<P>
The deputies involved, he said, engaged in "cell-trashing," the indiscriminate 
destruction of an inmate's cell under the guise of a search; "wall leaning," in 
which inmates had to lean spread-eagle against a wall until they lost muscle 
control, and "what simply amounts to deliberate and cruel harassment of inmates 
in order to establish control and to 'show the inmate who's running the jails.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Duffy concluded that the deputies' conduct was "inexcusable, unprofessional and 
embarrassing to the department." 
</P>
<P>
Drown said Monday that he knew little about the "Rambo Squad" because the El 
Cajon jail was not under his jurisdiction. He said he has no choice but to 
testify, although he now is beginning to believe that Bobbitt is playing 
politics with the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm beginning to think all of this is very much pointed to me and the 
election," he said. "I'm beginning to have resentful feelings about it. This is 
not what civil service hearings are supposed to be about." 
</P>
<P>
Drown said he had Mayer request the postponement until after the election 
because "I didn't want to be sequestered away for hours waiting to testify." 
</P>
<P>
Although Roache has likened Drown to Duffy, because the two served closely 
together for so many years, Drown said he didn't always agree with his boss. 
</P>
<P>
"We had operational differences from time to time, but you don't air those in 
public," he said. "This campaign is not, nor should it be, a report card on 
John Duffy. Come January, 1991, there will be a different management style and 
different policies and programs in place." 
</P>
<P>
Roache said Drown ducked the El Cajon jail incident because he found it 
unpleasant and bothersome. Bobbitt said Drown believed it would come back to 
haunt him during this election. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbitt said he will ask Drown to assess Duffy's leadership and management 
style during the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the hearing could have a potentially great impact on Jack Drown's 
chances for election," Bobbitt said. "Here he said he was concerned about 
abuses in the jails, and he claims never to have read the investigative package 
on the El Cajon jail. What does that tell you?" 
</P>
<P>
Duffy was elected sheriff in 1970 and reelected four times. He decided last 
December that he would not run for a sixth term, after scrutiny into whether 
public money helped finance his home security system.

POLICE SAY INVESTIGATION OF SERIAL KILLINGS IS AT A STANDSTILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police have received more than 2,200 leads in connection with the 
serial stabbing deaths of five women in Clairemont and University City, but 
with no arrest in sight and tips tapering off, the case is at a standstill, 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Asked at a press briefing whether an arrest was imminent, or if a piece was 
still missing, Capt. Dick Toneck said investigators are stuck. 
</P>
<P>
"A piece is still missing," he said. "If I had something to bring forth in the 
way of an arrest, I would relish that. But, as it stands, we're sifting through 
all the clues and all the tips people have phoned in. We're just hoping one 
will lead to an arrest." 
</P>
<P>
Toneck said the Police Department's 33 investigators working the case full time 
have called back almost everyone who phoned in with information. 
</P>
<P>
The case has received widespread media coverage in San Diego, where Police 
Chief Bob Burgreen has labeled the search for the killer the largest manhunt in 
the city's history and the department's No. 1 priority. 
</P>
<P>
Since Jan. 12, four women between the ages of 18 and 21 were murdered inside 
their homes in the middle of the day, after the killer entered through an 
unlocked or open door, police say. The fifth victim, 42-year-old Pamela Gail 
Clark, was the mother of one of the victims, 18-year-old Amber Clark. Both were 
stabbed inside their home in University City on Sept. 13. The three other women 
lived within two blocks of one another in a row of apartment houses in 
Clairemont. 
</P>
<P>
The manhunt and subsequent publicity led to a run on locks and security devices 
at local stores. Police have held twice-weekly press briefings, at which they 
often have nothing new to report. The briefings are to be reduced to once a 
week later this week. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Toneck, one of seven ranking officers assigned to the case full 
time, said investigators don't have a clear idea of the killer's possible 
whereabouts or whether he has left the area. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have anything to indicate (the suspect) is still here," Toneck said. 
"God forbid he's still here. We don't have any leads to tell us where he may 
be." 
</P>
<P>
Toneck said the leads had given police a range of possible suspects "who fit 
the description to a T. And yet, those are not the people. Their backgrounds, 
their whereabouts, just don't fit." 
</P>
<P>
Toneck has said police are eyeing a number of possible suspects but have no one 
under "classic surveillance." He declined to say what that means. 
</P>
<P>
The department made a controversial arrest shortly after the third killing in 
early April when a native-born Puerto Rican -- and a decorated ex-Marine -- was 
followed for weeks and finally detained because he closely resembled a 
composite drawing of the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
The man later said he phoned police and told them he committed the crime in the 
hope he could then convince them he was innocent. He was cleared shortly after 
his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, police ruled out any link between the serial slayings and a man 
arrested on suspicion of rape in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
The Clairemont-University City suspect is said to be a light-skinned black 
male, 5-foot-7 to 5-foot-10, with medium build and short, dark, kinky hair. He 
was briefly seen by a painter as he ran from the Clairemont apartment where 
18-year-old Holly Suzanne Tarr was killed April 3. 
</P>
<P>
It is that one sighting upon which the widely distributed composite of the 
suspect is based. 
</P>
<P>
Toneck said that, based on a psychological profile prepared for the Police 
Department by the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va., the killer is thought to be a 
loner and "disorganized" in his methods of operation. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe the weapon used in each of the killings was obtained at the 
scene; in every case but the first, investigators later found knives believed 
to have been the killer's weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Although he appears to be a loner, "there's no doubt that somebody -- a loved 
one, a neighbor, a close friend -- knows this guy," Toneck said. "We just don't 
know why this person hasn't called in and said, 'I know this guy.' We're hoping 
that will happen." 
</P>
<P>
But police have declined to say what, if any, reason they have to believe 
someone knows the suspect. They also decline to discuss almost any question 
relating to evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Toneck said the number of investigators working the case was recently scaled 
back from 34 to 33, and that $145,000 has been spent investigating the 
slayings. He said the number of detectives working the case "may be scaled back 
further at the point where the leads start to diminish." 
</P>
<P>
Police are concerned that unsuspecting residents may soon grow complacent and 
stop taking the precautions that many in the area instituted after the fourth 
and fifth killings in University City on Sept. 13, Toneck said. 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to get complacent. But as we've said to them, don't get 
complacent. This person is still around, still out and about, so please lock 
your doors in the daytime, be aware of your surroundings, get to know your 
neighbors and have your neighbors know you. Know the routines of one another at 
all times."

SIERRA CLUB FILES SUIT IN BID TO BLOCK RT. 56 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sierra Club filed a lawsuit in San Diego Superior Court on Monday to block 
the widening of Interstates 5 and 805 near Del Mar, the western extension of 
Route 56 through North City West and the construction of a massive interchange 
joining the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit contends that the freeway project will do irreparable harm to 
coastal wetlands and Carmel Valley, and that the California Coastal Commission 
didn't adequately pursue alternatives that would do less harm to the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was not unexpected; the Sierra Club promised to pursue the matter 
in court after the Coastal Commission approved the project by a bare 5-4 vote 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's own staff had recommended against the $160-million project, 
saying the destruction of coastal wildlife habitat around Los Penasquitos 
Lagoon and in the Carmel Valley was not sufficiently offset by mitigating 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
The project has been backed by Caltrans and the city of San Diego as necessary 
to relieve the I-805-I-5 bottleneck near Del Mar and to provide a link between 
Interstate 15 and the coast by widening 1.8 miles of Carmel Valley Road into a 
six-lane freeway. 
</P>
<P>
But Laurens Silver, attorney for the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, said the 
organization is asking the court to set aside the Coastal Commission permit 
because the commission should have approved a less environmentally damaging 
alternative -- one that would have consumed less of the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, the commission should have, at least, demanded more 
mitigation than it did to replace the 50 acres of wetlands that will be lost in 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of uncertainties in replacing wetland habitats, the commission in the 
past has required that new wetlands be created by a 3-1 ratio over the ones 
being destroyed," he said. "But the commission didn't do that in this case. 
It's a marked departure from the commission's historical practice." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Coastal Commission said he could not comment on the lawsuit 
because his office had not yet seen it. 
</P>
<P>
But Hannah Cohen, a consultant to the Mid-County Transportation Coalition that 
had lobbied for the highway project, called the Sierra Club's lawsuit 
"frustrating" and said she hoped the city of San Diego and Caltrans would move 
ahead until told otherwise by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
"This alignment has been approved since 1965. It's been a frustrating and long 
process, but we all feel we have a very viable and defensible environmental 
impact report. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry they're trying to put another hindrance in our way, but I believe we 
are on the winning end, having gotten this far with the project." 
</P>
<P>
A differing position was held by Jerry Mailhot, co-chairman of the Carmel 
Valley Coalition, which has fought the Route 56 plans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's encouraging for us that the Sierra Club has taken this on, because they 
don't normally take on lawsuits unless they see merit in them and think there's 
a chance of winning. 
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned by the destruction that freeway project will cause in the 
Carmel Valley and the impact on the Los Penasquitos Lagoon." 
</P>
<P>
Silver said he wasn't sure when a court hearing on the suit will be scheduled.

PATERSON ON REFUSING TO GO TO SAUDI ARABIA

When I was in the Marine Corps in World War II, anyone like Paterson, sitting 
back in picturesque Hawaii writing columns while his buddies were stationed in 
a combat zone where fighting could break out any day, was considered a coward 
and would be making small rocks out of big ones at Portsmouth.

PATERSON ON REFUSING TO GO TO SAUDI ARABIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was a Marine judge advocate and served for a time as a military judge. In my 
28-year Marine Corps career, I read many letters like the one by Paterson, 
written by young men desperately trying to persuade anyone in authority that 
they should be classified as conscientious objectors. 
</P>
<P>
The problem that I faced as a military judge lay in trying to determine whether 
the accused's conversion to pacifism was based upon sincere and deeply held 
beliefs or was merely an opportunistic ploy for the purpose of evading combat 
or other unpleasant duty, or, perhaps, was simply a manifestation of the 
accused's desire to obtain the benefits of military service while avoiding the 
concomitant obligations. One thing is clear: absent an admission by the 
accused, there is no way to tell for sure. 
</P>
<P>
There usually are, however, certain clues to which the trier of fact can look. 
Paterson's column contains numerous clues as to his true feelings. Principal 
among them are the facts that he voluntarily enlisted in the Marine Corps; 
accepted his pay and other benefits for four years and five months, and then 
decided to become a conscientious objector only after getting orders to an 
unpleasant and potentially dangerous place.

RAIL WAY: TRANSIT WITHOUT TEARS; 
</P>
<P>
A VITAL DEAL -- AND TWO VITAL BALLOT MEASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Raising mass transit to the former glorious level of the beloved Red Cars will 
be a long process. L. A. County transit officials last week took a big step 
along the way, a step that could benefit commuters in every surrounding county. 
</P>
<P>
After many months of negotiations, Southern Pacific Transportation Co. agreed 
to sell or lease the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission 245 miles of 
valuable rights-of-way. Someday those rail lines will be part of the commuter 
rail system that this region badly needs to help relieve increasing highway 
gridlock. Southern Pacific agreed to sell the rights-of-way, and 190 acres of 
adjacent land parcels, for $450 million, a bargain price 40% less than the 
original asking price. 
</P>
<P>
MAJOR ADVANCE: Specifically how the rail lines will be used -- where stations 
will be located, for example -- is still to be determined. But by purchasing 
passage rights along some very busy transit corridors, the commission has 
filled in large gaps in the map of the region's hoped-for mass-transit system. 
And from Ventura to San Clemente, most local officials agree that some kind of 
mass transit must be moving along those corridors soon, or we'll choke on 
traffic and smog. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the rights-of-way covered by last week's agreement are old railroad 
lines that SP doesn't use much any more. They converge on downtown Los Angeles 
from the Simi Valley, the Santa Clarita Valley, San Bernardino and the 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement will also allow purchase of a right-of-way to the Orange County 
line that can be linked to 4.5 miles already owned by the Orange County Transit 
District. That would open the door for major advances in commuter rail service 
from the south. But there's a catch for Orange County: The $50 million to buy 
the right-of-way and build the necessary stations and other capital projects is 
in Measure M, a half-cent sales tax for transit and transportation projects on 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
PROPS C AND M: L. A. County was able to purchase Southern Pacific's 
rights-of-way because voters assessed themselves a half-cent sales tax back in 
1980. Now Los Angeles voters are being asked to enact another modest 
transportation tax on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition C would raise the county sales tax another half cent for 
mass-transit projects. Under normal circumstances, we would be dubious about 
another sales tax hike so soon. Unfortunately, the need is there because the 
federal funds that once could be relied on to pay for major transportation 
projects like the Metro Rail subway are drying up. If Los Angeles is to 
maintain the momentum created by its new mass-transit projects, local residents 
must do more to support them. 
</P>
<P>
From that perspective, another half cent is a reasonable investment. Probably 
nothing that has been done with Los Angeles' transit tax money -- even building 
the Blue Line trolley between downtown and Long Beach -- will be as important 
as developing these rights-of-way. By enacting Proposition C in Los Angeles, 
and Measure M in Orange County, voters will help put these old rail lines to a 
new use as quickly as possible.

IN MEMORIAM; 
</P>
<P>
BRAVO, MAESTRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leonard Bernstein, who died Sunday at the age of 72, was in some deep sense the 
embodiment of that self-confident cultural maturity America achieved in this 
century's middle years. 
</P>
<P>
It now is possible, for example, to read much that once seemed prodigal or 
idiosyncratic about him as the intuitive progress of an artist who enjoyed not 
only the courage of his convictions but also of his affections. 
</P>
<P>
Had his part been played by another sort of artist one easily can imagine an 
America that might well have remained little more than an aesthetic province of 
Europe's great tradition. 
</P>
<P>
But, in Bernstein, American culture found a champion who was master of that 
great tradition while remaining entirely comfortable with the fact of his 
American origins. In his hands, the artist's unavoidable process of 
self-invention always was an act of affirmation rather than denial. 
</P>
<P>
He loved jazz, our authentic vernacular art music, and its expressive invention 
animated some of his finest work. He loved the musical theater, our vernacular 
opera; to it, he brought the great tradition's rigor and nobility of spirit; 
from it, he took the vigor of a vibrant popular culture. 
</P>
<P>
In search of inspiration for his own compositions, he returned again and again 
to the nourishing wellspring of his Judaism: to Jeremiah, that scold of a 
prophet, to the dark comfort of the Kaddish, to the sweetness of the Psalms, to 
the legend of the dybbuk. 
</P>
<P>
And yet for all of this, there was no part of his life or work that might be 
called sectarian, provincial or triumphal. His achievement was astonishing.

PROPOSITION 136 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his column about the overuse of bonds by state government (Opinion, Oct. 7), 
Cary Lowe incorrectly states Proposition 136, which I authored, requires a 
two-thirds vote for new taxes. In fact, Proposition 136 requires a simple 
majority vote if the taxes go into the general fund where spending can be 
prioritized. 
</P>
<P>
The two-thirds requirement applies only to "special taxes," those taxes which 
are permanently locked in for special purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Lowe also misses the mark when he argues that general obligation bonds should 
receive a majority vote for passage. The two-thirds vote requirement for 
passage of local general obligation bonds -- a requirement that predates 
Proposition 13 -- is an important protection for taxpayers. These bonds are 
backed by property taxes, that is, people's homes. Further, under the 
rent-control laws of Los Angeles, tax increases to cover bonds cannot be passed 
on to renters. Therefore, Lowe is mistaken when he says the costs of local 
general obligation bonds are shared by the whole community.

DEMONSTRATORS FORM LIFE CHAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times' coverage of the Oct. 7 Life Chain held in Torrance again included 
the typical negatively biased terms "foes," "anti-abortion" and "protest" 
("Foes Form 'Life Chain' Along Streets," Metro, Oct. 8). 
</P>
<P>
Many individuals involved in a variety of pro-life activities came together to 
form the Southern California Life Chain organization. 
</P>
<P>
We were also blessed with the endorsements of numerous church leaders and 
pro-life organizations. 
</P>
<P>
As an original member of the general Life Chain Committee, I know that an 
invitation to participate in the life chain was extended to all churches in the 
Los Angeles-Orange County areas and that the 30,000-plus participants were 
Christians of all denominations, not just Catholics. The focus of the committee 
was always on the prayerful and peaceful education of the general public that 
"abortion kills children." 
</P>
<P>
It was my humble privilege to, first, work with so many dedicated pro-lifers in 
organizing the life chain, and, second, to stand with my fellow church members 
to present our message on behalf of the defenseless unborn children.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ENCINITAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Dieguito High School teacher accused of molesting four teen-age girls 
pleaded not guilty Monday. 
</P>
<P>
George Dewey Warner III, 34, is charged with committing a lewd act with a 
minor, two counts of sexual battery on another girl and two misdemeanor counts 
of child molesting with two other girls. 
</P>
<P>
Warner, who had been free on $33,000 bail posted eight hours after his arrest 
Oct. 6, was allowed to remain free by Municipal Judge Michael Orfield. 
</P>
<P>
The judge ordered Warner not to contact the alleged victims or their families 
and not to associate with minors without the presence of an adult. 
</P>
<P>
Warner is on administrative leave from the school. 
</P>
<P>
"These crimes are alleged to have occurred outside the classroom," said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. John Williams, who declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The girls are between the ages of 15 and 17, and one of the charges states that 
the incident took place almost a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing was scheduled for Dec. 14.

The police gang unit continued its search Monday for a man who shot into a 
group of late-night beach-goers Saturday and wounded four people after an 
altercation near La Jolla Cove. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the injured were taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, 
treated and released Sunday morning, said Lt. George Saldamando, head of the 
police gang unit. 
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old girl was listed in fair condition at the hospital Monday after 
undergoing surgery for a gunshot wound to her left leg, a hospital spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred about 11:10 p.m. Saturday in a parking lot north of the 
lifeguard tower in the 800 block of Coast Boulevard, Saldamando said. A group 
of blacks was having a party in the parking lot just north of a larger group of 
Filipinos, when words were exchanged between the two groups, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A black man picked up a trash can and charged at the Filipinos, Saldamando 
said. A Filipino man fired two warning rounds from a handgun into the air, 
frightening off two of the black man's companions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The man with the trash can continued to challenge the Filipino, who then fired 
four shots into the group, hitting two group members and two bystanders who 
were passing through on their way to go scuba diving, Saldamando said. The 
gunman's shots were not returned, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Rabin, 28, was struck in the right arm; Gary Hurd, 43, was hit in the 
left ankle, and Lonnie Bennett, 24, was struck in the right leg. The 
17-year-old's name was withheld by authorities because she is a minor.

WELLS FARGO MUSEUM OF S.D. HISTORY TO OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Wells Fargo History Museum, with exhibits ranging from the priceless 
"Davies watch" to an 1867 stagecoach, is scheduled to open today at Old Town 
State Historical Park. 
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony at noon will feature a ribbon-cutting with 150 area 
schoolchildren in attendance and the arrival of Wells Fargo Bank dignitaries in 
a replica of a 19th-Century Wells Fargo stagecoach from California's 
gold-mining days. 
</P>
<P>
Museum admission is free. Hours are from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-square-foot museum is housed in the former state of California 
Visitor Center at the corner of San Diego Avenue and Mason Street in the state 
park. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo spent five years and $120,000 planning and creating the museum and 
remodeling the visitors center, said museum curator Michael Shanahan. Wells 
Fargo also has history museums in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The museum will be part of the San Diego Unified School District's history 
curriculum for fourth-grade students, Shanahan said. Groups of students are to 
visit the museum twice a day to meet state education requirements for studying 
California history. 
</P>
<P>
"Our No. 1 commitment is to education," Shanahan said. "We're happy to be part 
of the San Diego school system." 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the "hands-on" museum will be allowed to look through the 1860s 
business records of Ephraim W. Morse, a San Diego merchant and Wells Fargo 
agent, and examine balance scales, coins and other priceless of the era, many 
of which pertain to San Diego history, Shanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibits will include an Abbot-Downing Concord stagecoach purchased by Wells 
Fargo in 1867, an audio-visual theater and displays highlighting Wells Fargo 
documents, furniture and fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
The showcase exhibit will be the "Davies watch," a 24-carat gold watch given by 
Wells Fargo in 1873 as a reward to a San Diego man who returned a bank treasure 
box that had been lost from a Wells Fargo stagecoach. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Davies asked for a reward of $10 for recovering the box, which held 
$10,000 in gold from the Julian gold mines. The bank gave him the $10 plus the 
watch, valued then at $600 and today considered priceless, Shanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1850s, Old Town was the county seat of San Diego, then one of the 
largest and least-populated counties in California. Wells Fargo had an 
important role in developing the area with its express mail, stagecoaches and 
banking services, and its history museum will highlight those accomplishments, 
Shanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
The bank's history department will oversee the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan, a La Mesa resident and San Diego State University graduate, said 
Wells Fargo plans to move the museum within three years to the larger Colorado 
House, one of the state park's original structures from the mid-1800s. 
</P>
<P>
The Colorado House, which will be the museum's permanent home, will accommodate 
more exhibits.

A former lawyer for the state of West Virginia has pleaded guilty in federal 
court in San Diego to a felony tax charge, prosecutors said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Clay Hart, 61, pleaded guilty Friday to aiding and abetting the 
preparation of a false tax return, Assistant U.S. Atty. S. Gay Hugo-Martinez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hart formed and promoted tax shelters in 1984 and 1985 that promised 
alternative energy tax credits for the purchase of windmills, Hugo-Martinez 
said. In 1984, Hart failed to buy the windmills but prepared a 1984 tax return 
that said windmills costing $605,640 had been purchased, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hart, a certified public accountant, is a former assistant attorney general for 
the state of West Virginia. He lived in Southern California from 1981 to 1986, 
Hugo-Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing is set for Jan. 22. Hart faces up to three years in prison and a 
$100,000 fine, Hugo-Martinez said.

BOEING'S COUP FUELS GLOBAL RIVALRY AMONG AIRCRAFT FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Boeing dramatically raised the competitive stakes in the world aircraft 
industry Monday, introducing another new aircraft model as part of a 
$22-billion sale to United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
United ordered 34 and took options on an additional 34 Boeing 777s, a large 
twin-engine aircraft that will compete against the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 and 
the Airbus Industrie A-330/340 in the market for long-range jets. All the 
aircraft sell for about $100 million each and seat between 300 and 400 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
The launch of another model will give Boeing five distinct families of 
aircraft, filling virtually every segment of the large jetliner market and 
closing in on a niche that the two smaller producers have exploited in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Although the huge sale was far from a crushing blow to McDonnell Douglas, the 
smallest and weakest player in the international aircraft industry, it exerts 
additional pressure on the firm to keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
"This launch closes in the walls around McDonnell," said Jack Modzelewski, 
aerospace analyst at Paine Webber. The firm's Douglas Aircraft unit builds 
commercial aircraft in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
For Boeing, the development of the new jet will be expensive -- analysts say it 
could cost $3 billion to $5 billion -- but the payback could be significant. 
</P>
<P>
"The 777 is a new cash cow for Boeing in the making, though it won't get there 
until late in the decade," said Robert Paulson, a McKinsey &amp; Co. aerospace 
expert. "If Boeing can achieve in the 1990s what it had in the 1980s with the 
747 aircraft, then that can be meaningful. It will make Boeing stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Boeing believes that the market for the 777-type of aircraft will be among the 
most significant until past the turn of the century. The United order for 34 
aircraft and spare parts is worth about $4 billion -- a sum that would double 
if the options for another 34 planes are exercised. The $22-billion figure 
cited by United for the combined purchases of 747s and 777s includes the 
effects of future inflation, without which the sale would be worth about $16 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The Seattle-based aerospace firm is projecting that 42% of all jetliner 
deliveries, measured by dollar volume, will be in the 777-category of aircraft 
-- roughly a market of $260 billion over the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Boeing's goal is to capture 55% to 60% of that," a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
If Boeing fulfills that prediction, competitive and financial pressures could 
increase on McDonnell Douglas, which offers only the MD-11 and MD-80/90 models, 
has no new family of jets in development and lacks the financial strength of 
Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell has 173 firm orders and 202 options for its MD-11, a respectable 
backlog worth about $37 billion. It has succeeded in part because the MD-11 was 
launched long before either Boeing or Airbus introduced their models. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of the United order would have been far worse for McDonnell if it had 
not built that backlog by securing massive orders from Delta Airlines, American 
Airlines and the leasing firm GPA, analysts said. Moreover, the United loss was 
not unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
"United has always been a strong Boeing customer and I guess we tried hard and 
we are certainly disappointed, but I don't think we are surprised," Robert 
Hood, president of the Douglas Aircraft unit of McDonnell, said in an interview 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be the first to admit that the 777 is a good airplane, but . . . we 
still think we have the right airplane for long-range routes," Hood said. 
</P>
<P>
The 777 will initially have a 4,800-mile range versus 7,000 miles for the 
MD-11. A later 777 model will extend its range to 7,600 miles. But Hood noted 
that the aircraft will be powered by two engines and suggested that there is 
still a "mystique" about flying long transoceanic routes with just two engines. 
The MD-11 is a three-engine jet. 
</P>
<P>
The 777 and MD-11 will compete closely in their passenger capacity and overall 
weight capacities. 
</P>
<P>
The longer range 777 will seat 300 to 320 versus a seating capacity of 323 for 
the MD-11. The shorter range 777 will seat 360 to 390, Boeing said. The 
long-range 777 will have a gross takeoff weight of 590,000 pounds, versus 
602,500 pounds for the MD-11. 
</P>
<P>
Modzelewski said the 777 will offer superior fuel economy, in part because it 
will be powered by two engines and have newly designed wings. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing's latest advance is considered less of a threat to Airbus, a consortium 
of European companies, because Airbus' government subsidies limit the financial 
harm done by the loss of sales to Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told that we lost out because our price was too high, clear and 
simple," said Airbus Industrie spokesman David Vance. "One person involved with 
United told us that our plane offered better fuel burn. But I guess the overall 
price wasn't low enough to beat Boeing." 
</P>
<P>
The Boeing board must still authorize the formal launch of the 777, which is 
scheduled for Oct. 29. Additional orders are expected shortly, including one 
from All Nippon Airways and at least one other Asian carrier. 
</P>
<P>
British Airways is expected to make a big order and said it is "considering its 
options," with all three manufacturers in the running. However, the airline is 
"pretty well committed to Boeing," suggested Paul Turk, an airline analyst with 
Avmark Inc., an Arlington, Va., consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, experts warned that the competitive shape of the industry could 
radically change in a deep recession and with continued increases in jet fuel 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
Paulson, the McKinsey expert, said 30% of the large backlog accumulated by 
aircraft makers in recent years could evaporate, creating serious problems for 
McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Air Transport Assn., an airline trade group, said Monday that U.S. 
airlines face a $10-billion boost in the cost of jet fuel in the final quarter 
of 1990 and will post a cumulative $1-billion loss. 
</P>
<P>
"The airline industry has never lost that much in an entire year," Robert J. 
Aaronson, the association's president, said in a speech prepared for delivery 
in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
HOW THEY STACK UP 
</P>
<P>
The three biggest aircraft producers are each offering a new model. Here is how 
the planes compare.

<TEXT>
<P>
Apple Computer Inc., in an aggressive but overdue effort to stem a decline in 
market share, launched a new line of computers Monday that cuts the price of 
the flagship Macintosh in half and fundamentally alters the company's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
The elaborate introduction ceremony, featuring live satellite links with 
Berlin, Singapore and a number of U.S. locations, took place at Apple's factory 
in Fremont, emphasizing the company's intention to transform itself into a 
high-volume, low-cost manufacturer of personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
The new strategy has been described by Apple Chairman and Chief Executive John 
A. Sculley as the outgrowth of a complete re-evaluation of how Apple will 
compete in the volatile personal computer business. Although the Macintosh is 
widely recognized as being easier to use than competing IBM-compatible personal 
computers, it has also been far more expensive -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple must increase its market share 
beyond the estimated 10% that it now holds if it is to be more than a niche 
player in a market dominated by IBM-compatible machines that use the DOS 
operating system. That challenge has been sharpened by the success of 
Microsoft's Windows 3 software, which gives DOS machines many of the 
easy-to-use features that made the Macintosh a success. 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts have praised the new products, whose basic characteristics have 
been widely known for months, although Wall Street has been uncomfortable with 
the expected reduction in Apple's profit margins that will come with the 
low-priced products. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tremendous product announcement, though I don't know why they didn't 
do it a year ago," said David Wu, a computer analyst with S. G. Warburg &amp; 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
Sculley emphasized that Apple did not simply cut prices of existing machines, 
but rather redesigned them to reduce cost and increase performance. And though 
he said the economy was already in a recession, he nonetheless maintained that 
businesses and consumers would continue to buy productivity-enhancing 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
The new Apple machines include: 
</P>
<P>
* The Macintosh Classic, an entry-level computer priced at $999 with one 
megabyte of memory and a floppy-disk drive, or $1,499 with two megabytes of 
memory and a 40-megabyte hard-disk drive. The Classic, available immediately, 
is equivalent to the Macintosh SE, which will be discontinued, as will the 
Macintosh Plus. 
</P>
<P>
* The Macintosh LC, a color computer that has a small, pizza-box-like shape 
with a separate monitor. It comes with a 40-megabyte hard-disk drive and a new 
sound-editing system that allows voice or other sound to be attached to files 
and edited. The LC, which will not be available in volume until February, will 
sell for $2,499 without a monitor. A special card that will allow the machine 
to run Apple II software will cost $199. 
</P>
<P>
* The Macintosh IIsi, a high-performance color machine that uses the fast 68030 
microprocessor from Motorola. The IIsi is faster and has better expansion 
capabilities than the LC, and includes the new sound-editing system. It is also 
available now, at a price of $3,769 in a basic configuration that includes two 
megabytes of memory and a 40-megabyte hard disk. It replaces the existing Mac 
IIcx. 
</P>
<P>
All the products are expected to sell at "street prices" up to 20% below the 
listed price. 
</P>
<P>
Sculley said the new machines had been brought to market even more quickly than 
Apple had originally planned, and that the company would have plenty of the 
Macintosh Classics on hand for the Christmas season. But the limited 
availability of the LC, considered by some analysts the most important of the 
new products, could make it harder for Apple to build momentum. 
</P>
<P>
The LC is the key to Apple's efforts to win back the education market, which it 
once dominated with the Apple II but has lately lost to IBM-compatible 
machines. One of the new television advertisements that are part of a 
$40-million marketing campaign features a teacher giving a roomful of 
LC-equipped students an inspirational lecture on the value of production and 
productivity.

Carl's Jr. Announces Licensing Deal: The Happy Star is about to become La 
Estrella Feliz. 
</P>
<P>
The translation will be official today when Anaheim-based Carl Karcher 
Enterprises Inc. is expected to sign a licensing agreement that will result in 
the opening of at least 10 Carl's Jr. restaurants -- with the signature yellow 
shooting star -- over the next five years in Mexico. The agreement with Valores 
Metalicos, based in Monterrey, Mexico, marks the company's first move south of 
the border and its third international venture. The restaurants will likely be 
developed in the Monterrey area, about 100 miles south of Laredo, Texas.

Journal Reacts to Singapore Press Restrictions: The owners of the Wall Street 
Journal announced that they will halt the circulation of the Asian Wall Street 
Journal in Singapore, following the publication of new restrictions on the 
foreign press there. "What the government of Singapore wants is for the foreign 
press to practice self-censorship," Dow Jones &amp; Co., the majority owner of 
the Asian Wall Street Journal, said in an editorial.

Bally Chief Rules Out Bankruptcy Filing: The new interim chief executive of 
Chicago-based Bally Manufacturing Corp. said bankruptcy is not an option for 
the financially troubled gaming and recreation company. 
</P>

"That word isn't in my vocabulary," Arthur A. Goldberg said. Goldberg, the 
largest stockholder, took the reins Friday when Chairman Bob Mullane stepped 
down. The company, which owns hotel-casinos in Las Vegas, Reno and Atlantic 
City, has $1.86 billion in debts. Goldberg, known as a cost-cutter, said, "I 
have been on record that a thing's for sale at the right price, but we're not 
committing ourselves to anything."

T-Bill Rates Nearly Unchanged: The Treasury sold $9.4 billion of new 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.18%, down from 7.19% last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Another $9.4 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount 
rate of 7.22%, up from 7.21% last week. The new discount rates understate the 
actual return to investors -- 7.41% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill 
selling for $9,818.50, and 7.60% for a six-month bill selling for $9,635.00. 
The discount rate reflects the price discount received when government 
securities are purchased at less than face value.

Justice Department Backtracks: The department urged adoption of sentencing 
guidelines for corporations convicted of crimes that would force judges to 
impose fines based on the seriousness of the offense. But the department shied 
away from a proposal it had earlier advanced under which a company involved in 
a massive fraud could be fined twice its gain or twice the loss to its victims. 
The department rescinded its support for one of the proposals under 
consideration, as well as its own suggestion, after receiving an inquiry from 
the White House, which had been contacted by some business groups expressing 
concern over stiff fines.

MARKETING: 'BOSS AS STAR' CAMPAIGNS CAN BACKFIRE IF THE EXECUTIVE FALLS FROM 
GRACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In just a few weeks, TV commercials for Remington shavers will once again fill 
the airwaves. As always, these pre-Christmas spots will feature the firm's 
perky leader, Victor Kiam II, best known for his laughable line about liking 
the shaver so much that he bought the company. 
</P>
<P>
That sappy slogan was supposed to cause consumers to like Kiam so much that 
they would rush out to buy the shavers. And for years it worked. Remington 
became a real heavyweight as consumers snapped up the cordless whisker 
removers. 
</P>
<P>
But several weeks ago, Kiam, who also owns the New England Patriots football 
team, stuck his football in his mouth. After a female newspaper reporter 
complained of sexual harassment in the Patriot locker room by several players, 
Kiam initially stuck up for his players. Only after several women's groups 
threatened a boycott of his company did he relent and run apologetic ads. 
</P>
<P>
Now, marketing experts say, Kiam's credibility as a product pitchman may have 
turned from shining gold to razor-stubble black. The overnight tarnishing of 
his commercial credibility is not unlike that of hotel queen and convicted tax 
evader Leona Helmsley, whose familiar face has recently disappeared from her 
hotel chain's advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when company leaders become spokesmen they can unintentionally become 
liabilities. Back in 1988, the Wickes furniture chain suddenly found itself 
without a TV spokesman when former Chairman Sanford C. Sigoloff ("We got the 
message, Mr. Sigoloff!") left the company. Meanwhile, William S. Davila steps 
down as president of Vons Grocery Co. in 1992, and the company is still trying 
to figure out how it will replace his friendly and familiar mug in TV spots. 
And at 83, the frail Orville Redenbacher cannot forever hawk the popcorn that 
bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of all this, ad agency executives are asking aloud: Why risk 
placing top executives in ads? 
</P>
<P>
"The minute these guys go on TV, it starts to corrupt them," said Larry 
Postaer, executive vice president and creative director of the Los Angeles 
agency Rubin Postaer &amp; Associates. "Because of all the money some 
executives put into their faces being on TV, they become celebrities larger 
than their products," said Postaer. "It's a perk that's tougher to walk away 
from than a corporate jet." 
</P>
<P>
Some industry critics say chief executives are probably the very last people 
who should appear in ads. "I don't understand the perception that viewers will 
believe something if a CEO says it," said Dave Vadehra, president of the New 
York research firm Video Storyboard Tests. "There's no reason to believe a 
chief executive. He has so much at stake that he's the one who is most likely 
to lie. People are much more likely to believe a salesman." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most familiar executive hawker is Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee A. 
Iacocca, who has appeared in 68 ads since 1979. A brand new ad featuring 
Iacocca hyping Chrysler's revamped minivans premiered over the weekend. "We try 
to keep him for just the major events," said Arthur C. Liebler, vice president 
of communications at Chrysler. "We don't want him there as just a huckster." 
</P>
<P>
Many have tried to follow in Iacocca's footsteps. There's R. David Thomas, the 
founder of Wendy's, now seen on TV hawking chicken sandwiches in his bathrobe. 
Likewise, founder Carl N. Karcher has tried to get consumers to nibble on 
Carl's Jr. fast food for years. And even Barron Hilton briefly tried to fill a 
few Hilton Hotel rooms by yakking in some TV spots. 
</P>
<P>
But the going gets tough when an executive falls from grace. Both Kiam and 
Helmsley declined interviews through the same New York spokesman, Howard 
Rubenstein. The new Kiam ads are being tested during screenings to groups of 
consumers, Rubenstein said. "Oddly enough," Rubenstein said of Kiam's remarks 
about the female sportswriter, "if anything, the situation has only heightened 
the public's awareness of the product and of Mr. Kiam." 
</P>
<P>
Marketing experts say it is usually ego that leads to executives pitching 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the Helmsley Hotel's former advertising agency recommended against 
featuring Leona Helmsley in corporate ads, she continued to appear in them for 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"The corporate policy was (that) her picture should remain in the advertising," 
said Lawrence Aarons, chairman of the New York agency, Taylor-Gordon, Aarons 
&amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
"Most agencies only place CEOs in ads because the CEOs want to be in them," 
said Lee Kovel, chairman of the Japanese agency HDM Los Angeles. "But it's 
fraught with peril. It's dangerous for any one person to stand for a company, 
no matter who they are," said Kovel, who, at a previous agency, helped create 
Eastern Airline ads that featured the airline's short-time leader, Frank 
Borman. 
</P>
<P>
Since that time, troubled Eastern recently turned to its court-appointed 
trustee, Martin R. Shugrue, to star in its ads. But even though Shugrue is 
generally regarded as a convincing spokesman, after just six months Eastern now 
says it will soon stop using him in ads. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want him to be the star of the commercials," said George Brennan, 
senior vice president of marketing at Eastern Airlines. "We want our 
advertising to focus on the product." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gemstar Fires Agency After Only One Month 
</P>
<P>
These days it's big news when an agency picks up a new account worth $3 
million. But it's also rather embarrassing when the agency loses the business 
within a month of announcing the win. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Gemstar VCR Plus, a Los Angeles maker of remote devices that 
program VCRs, awarded its account to the Los Angeles office of J. Walter 
Thompson. Last week, Gemstar turned around and handed the ad business to the 
Los Angeles office of DDB Needham Worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
For DDB, the win is the second in three weeks. Last month, it won the ad 
business for the Moto du Monde motorcycle road-racing series. DDB/Los Angeles 
has picked up $40 million in new billings since Jan. 1, said Dave Park, 
president of the office, which now posts annual billings of $176 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Davis Ball Picks Up Avis' Regional Account 
</P>
<P>
The same agency that handles advertising for Knott's Berry Farm and Marine 
World Africa U.S.A. has picked up a client that can transport people to both 
places -- Avis. The Los Angeles agency Davis Ball &amp; Colombatto last week 
won the Avis Rent-A-Car licensee business for Southern California, Las Vegas 
and Nevada. Although agency executives declined to state the size of the 
business, industry sources estimate it to be worth about $3 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
"All rental car ads look the same," said Mark Davis, executive vice president 
of the agency. While unwilling to describe his agency's upcoming Avis ads, 
Davis said they would be very unconventional. "Otherwise," he said, "they'd be 
wasting their money." 
</P>
<P>

Card Maker Come-On: Reggie's Autographs 
</P>
<P>
What's a baseball card maker to do during the fall, when most people are 
thinking about football? 
</P>
<P>
Well, how about slipping something extra into baseball card packets -- such as, 
say, 2,500 "Baseball Hero" cards that are numbered and personally autographed 
by former California Angel slugger Reggie Jackson? 
</P>
<P>
That's what the 2-year-old Yorba Linda company Upper Deck has done. As a 
result, sales are up. Of course, the odds of finding the card aren't good. 
There are 700,000 other Reggie Jackson cards that aren't autographed, said Don 
Bodow, vice president of the company. 
</P>
<P>
How long did it take Reggie to sign all those cards? An entire weekend.

STATES LOSE SUPREME COURT BATTLE TO AIRLINES OVER ADS ; 
</P>
<P>
DECISION: THE JUSTICES LET STAND A RULING THAT ONLY THE U.S. CAN REGULATE 
MERCHANDISING THAT CALIFORNIA AND 33 OTHERS CONTEND IS DECEPTIVE.

Airlines that boldly advertise low fares but mention extra charges only in tiny 
type cannot be attacked for deceptive advertising under state laws, according 
to a ruling that the Supreme Court let stand Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The high court refused to hear an appeal by attorneys from 34 states, including 
California, who contended that the airlines are misleading consumers through 
deceptive ads. 
</P>
<P>
In April, a U.S. appeals court in New Orleans ruled that airline ads are 
off-limits to state law. Its ruling was based on the Airline Deregulation Act 
of 1978, which forbids state interference in matters "relating to rates, routes 
or services" of the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Only officials of the U.S. Transportation Department can regulate airline ads, 
the court said. The current federal rules require airlines to disclose extra 
charges in fine print, but they do not require that these costs be included in 
the boldly advertised low fare. 
</P>
<P>
The court decision marked a sharp setback for state attorneys, such as John K. 
Van de Kamp of California and Jim Mattox of Texas, who have sought to use state 
law to protect consumers as the federal government has increasingly deregulated 
the industry. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the attorneys for 34 states informed several airlines, including TWA, 
Continental and British Air, that their promotions violated state guidelines on 
fair advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Shelden, a California deputy attorney general, said that officials 
wanted airlines to advertise the cost of a round-trip fare rather than the 
one-way cost and to include extra charges in its advertised price. 
</P>
<P>
"We can require all other industries to advertise in a non-deceptive manner and 
we thought we could do the same with the airlines," Shelden said. 
</P>
<P>
But before the states could take legal action against the airlines, lawyers for 
the airlines filed suit against the states. They won a judge's order forbidding 
state interference with their advertising policies. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court not only upheld the judge's order, but agreed that his ruling 
could cover all 34 states that wanted to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
Congress intended to preempt state laws affecting the airlines, the appeals 
court said, so that the airlines would face "only one regulator in matters 
pertaining to rates, routes and services." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Supreme Court refused to review this decision (Mattox vs. TWA, 
90-221, and Atty. Gen. of California vs. TWA, 90-232). 
</P>
<P>
Since the judge's original order was a preliminary injunction, the state 
officials could appeal again when the order is final. But David Corban, a 
Houston attorney for the airlines, said that the result likely would be the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the court has correctly construed the intent of the (1978) law," 
Corban said.

IBM PROFIT RISE DISAPPOINTS WALL STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
International Business Machines on Monday announced a nearly 27% jump in 
third-quarter earnings, but Wall Street -- clearly expecting an even better 
performance -- sent IBM shares lower. 
</P>
<P>
While IBM stock closed at $99.25 per share, down just $1 in New York Stock 
Exchange trading, at times during the hectic trading day it was trading as low 
as $96.25. Other high-technology stocks, often affected by the Wall Street 
fortunes of the world's largest computer company, were not dragged down by 
investors' reactions to IBM's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
"Wall Street and its bears clearly overreacted on IBM," said John Jones, a 
technology analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "These results 
were nothing to be disappointed about." 
</P>
<P>
Profit for the quarter totaled $1.1 billion, compared to $900 million in the 
year-ago period. Revenue totaled $15.3 billion, up 6.8% from $14.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of the year, profit totaled $3.6 billion, up 12.5% 
from $3.2 billion. Revenue for the period totaled $46 billion, up 8.8% from 
$42.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said IBM benefited from strong sales of computer software, up 23% from 
the prior year, and an aggressive leasing program that generated 26% more 
revenue than the prior year. 
</P>
<P>
IBM said the most recent quarterly results were also aided by the weak U.S. 
dollar, which increased the value of results from its foreign operations. 
Although the company declined to quantify the effect of the currency 
translations, some analysts said it could account for as much as $170 million 
of the quarter's profits. 
</P>
<P>
IBM said it expects its operations to remain strong for the remainder of the 
year, and it stuck by earlier projections that sales would rise between 7% and 
10% in the final months of the year if the world economy does not shatter. 
</P>
<P>
"Assuming no further deterioration in the world's economies, we continue to 
expect substantially improved financial performance for 1990," IBM Chairman 
John F. Akers said in the firm's financial statement. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some analysts said they wonder whether IBM can achieve these goals given 
the slowdown of sales of its personal computers and its ongoing transition to a 
new generation of mainframe computers, the 390 series. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, computer sales dropped 1.5% in the third quarter, a slip the company 
attributed to a slowdown of sales of its PS/2 models in Europe and deep 
discounting of the products in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the introduction five weeks ago of the 390 series led to an 
increase in mainframe leasing while customers waited for the new models to be 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts, including Stephen Cohen of Soundview Financial, say the product 
transition in mainframes -- IBM's largest and strategically most important 
computers -- could last well into 1991, depressing sales and profits until late 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
However, company officials say that the transition is nearly complete and that 
customers have responded well to the new systems. A spokesman said the company 
had more orders for its new mainframe models in the third quarter than it could 
satisfy.

Sales of North American-made cars and light trucks fell 2.1% in early October, 
continuing a slump that began when the 1989 model year ended last September, 
the companies said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The auto makers sold cars and trucks during the Oct. 1-10 period at an average 
daily rate of 30,096, compared to a rate of 30,734 during the same time last

ELECTRONICS: MANUFACTURER HOPES TO CASH IN ON NEW TECHNOLOGY EXPECTED TO 
INCREASE SALES OF HOME SATELLITE DISHES AND DESCRAMBLERS THIS DECADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Executives at VideoCipher, which manufactures scrambling and descrambling 
technology that is used in the satellite television broadcast industry, firmly 
believe that technological advances eventually will make home satellite dish 
systems as appealing to consumers as microwaves and VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
That belief is driven by the development of new satellites and transmission 
devices that, during the coming decade, will allow homeowners to use relatively 
small signal-receiving dishes instead of the current generation of dishes that 
take of up space and, all too often, make neighbors see red. 
</P>
<P>
The bulky nature of dishes -- the current generation are between 7 and 10 feet 
in diameter -- has kept satellite systems from gaining a mainstream following, 
in large because many communities have ordinances that prohibit them. 
</P>
<P>
But the new satellites, which are as small as 2 feet in diameter, could defuse 
public concern and turn satellite systems into a mainstream product, said 
Stewart Schley, editor of Denver-based Cable World magazine. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the expected sales explosion, VideoCipher, which also sells 
signal receivers, scramblers and descramblers to wholesalers, has taken the 
unusual step of opening Satellite Sensations, a retail store in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
VideoCipher, a division of New York-based General Instrument, decided to open 
Satellite Sensations because "in consumer electronics, nothing beats seeing 
that glint in the consumer's eye when (a customer is) listening to a 
presentation," said Greg Gudorf, who joined VideoCipher this summer as director 
of retail operations. 
</P>
<P>
Before opening the company store, VideoCipher's knowledge of consumers' 
reactions was limited to what could be gleaned through conversations with 
satellite system retailers around the country, Gudorf said. VideoCipher's store 
is probably an industry first, observers said, because sales traditionally have 
been handled by electronic companies -- many which lack sophisticated marketing 
and sales programs -- that install the devices. 
</P>
<P>
VideoCipher will use sales and marketing information generated by the store, 
which will offer products manufactured by VideoCipher and its competitors, to 
improve its own line of products, Gudorf said. VideoCipher personnel who 
operate the store will pay close attention to how customers respond to the best 
-- and worst -- features of products made by VideoCipher and its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
But the company also intends to make marketing information available to its 
dealers around the country in an attempt to bolster the sales of VideoCipher 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Although the name suggests a concentration of satellite-industry-related 
electronics, Satellite Sensations also offers a wide variety of 
home-electronics devices, including both audio and video technology. 
</P>
<P>
The store, which includes a play area for children, is designed "to make it 
appealing to the whole family, because that's who we're after," said Charles 
Dunham, a consultant who helped design the store. The play area was added 
because it takes about 30 minutes to explain satellite broadcasting to a 
typical consumer, said Dunham, the brother of VideoCipher's president, Lawrence 
Dunham. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is uncertain when the new technologies will take hold -- industry 
estimates range from 5 to 10 years -- at least three direct-broadcast companies 
already have unveiled systems that will utilize the new satellites and 
receiving dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Kent, Wash.-based SkyPix, for example, hopes to use the new-generation 
equipment on a broad basis when it beams signals to residents of select cities 
during early 1991, according to SkyPix spokesman Harvey Bolgla. 
</P>
<P>
VideoCipher has a decided interest in how the satellite industry matures 
because, as new companies begin to beam signals, they will use scrambling 
systems that will force consumers to buy a descrambler. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a handful of companies, including VideoCipher and Toshiba, manufacture 
receiving and descrambling systems, Gudorf said. However, the other 
manufacturers are dependent upon a proprietary descrambling technology 
developed by VideoCipher, Gudorf said. 
</P>
<P>
But VideoCipher's dominance in the scrambling-descrambling industry could be 
threatened, observers said, because, as the new programming services spring up, 
VideoCipher will be competing with other manufacturers. Scientific Atlanta, a 
VideoCipher competitor, recently won a contract to scramble and descramble 
signals for KPrime, a satellite service that will begin operation in a handful 
of locations Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Gudorf said the store is, in part, an attempt to learn what fears exist in the 
minds of consumers, many of whom were frightened away from direct satellite 
broadcast in the mid-1980s when programming companies such as HBO and Cinemax 
scrambled their signals. Although an estimated 700,000 satellite systems were 
sold in 1985, "things cooled off substantially" in 1986, Gudorf said. 
</P>
<P>
Annual sales in the satellite-system industry hit 350,000 during 1989, and 
about 3 million systems are now in operation, according to Linda Brill, public 
relations manager of the Satellite Broadcasting &amp; Communications Assn., a 
Washington-based trade group. 
</P>
<P>
"With the new dishes, you won't have zoning problems, you won't have these . . 
. eyesores," Brill said. "With the 20-inch dishes, you can stick them on your 
window or on the roof and nobody will know that they're there."

ENCINO FIRM ACCUSED OF MISHANDLING MCENROE ESCROW; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: THE COMPANY VEHEMENTLY DENIES ANY WRONGDOING. IT CHALLENGED 
REGULATORS BY TAKING THE CASE TO SUPERIOR COURT.

<P>
California regulators are accusing another Encino escrow firm, Pavilion Escrow 
Inc., of breaking state laws while handling several real estate deals, 
including the $3.6-million sale of tennis star John McEnroe's house in the 
exclusive Carbon Beach area of Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
In a complaint before the Department of Corporations (DOC), Corporations 
Commissioner Christine W. Bender has alleged that Pavilion, among other things, 
opened two different escrows on McEnroe's house early this year without telling 
McEnroe or getting his approval -- in violation of state financial laws. 
McEnroe eventually sold the house in May. 
</P>
<P>
But Pavilion vehemently denies any wrongdoing, and aggressively challenged the 
DOC by taking the case to Superior Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In the McEnroe case, Pavilion asserts that the two escrows were merely a 
paperwork oversight. Both escrows involved the same buyer and seller, and it 
was "physically impossible" for McEnroe to not have approved the situation 
because he signed the instructions for both escrows, Joseph S. Fischbach, a 
lawyer for Pavilion, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, neither McEnroe -- who had bought the house from Johnny Carson -- nor 
anyone else has filed a complaint about Pavilion with the DOC or brought a 
lawsuit in court, Fischbach said. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome J. Eisenberg, a former lawyer for Pavilion, said in court papers that 
"all the parties were advised of the nature of the transaction and simply 
forgot to cancel" the first escrow. 
</P>
<P>
"The allegations stated by the DOC are frivolous and clearly demonstrate their 
inability to understand complex transactions," Eisenberg stated. 
</P>
<P>
Escrow firms, which must be licensed by the state, help ensure that buyers and 
sellers of real estate meet certain conditions, such as obtaining a title 
search, before the sale is completed. In effect, they stand as a neutral party, 
holding documents and cash transferred between the buyer and seller until the 
deal is closed. Frequently, each side is required to make a deposit of at least 
a few thousand dollars to open escrow. 
</P>
<P>
The Pavilion case points up how the DOC is looking closely at escrow firms 
since early last year, when the agency seized the now-defunct Escrow Shoppe, 
another Encino firm. The DOC closed it after alleging that the Escrow Shoppe 
made unauthorized payments totaling $3 million, and asserting that up to 
$450,000 was missing. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, the DOC was heavily criticized by some of the Escrow Shoppe's 
customers because the DOC also froze $5 million of customers' money for several 
months while its investigation continued, which threw the customers' housing 
plans into chaos. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pavilion case, however, none of the complaints by Bender involve missing 
funds or customers being deprived of cash they were due. 
</P>
<P>
She did allege that Pavilion altered escrow instructions, failed to disclose 
important information to lenders and let its former lawyer, Eisenberg, draw 
cash from Pavilion's bank account without first telling regulators. In court 
papers, Pavilion called all the allegations false and, on the Eisenberg matter, 
said he only had access to the firm's "general" bank account, not the "trust" 
account where customers' escrow funds are held. 
</P>
<P>
The DOC's complaints were made on June 20 and co-signed by Judy L. Hartley, a 
senior counsel at the DOC in Los Angeles who declined comment on the case. The 
agency also said then that it planned to revoke Pavilion's escrow license and 
to bar its sole owner, Deidre Nulty, from the business pending a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the DOC tried to block Pavilion from accepting any new 
business because "we thought the danger to the public was so great," said Alan 
S. Weinger, a DOC lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
But Pavilion convinced a Superior Court judge in Los Angeles to block the DOC's 
order stopping Pavilion from taking on new accounts, because Pavilion had not 
been given due process to defend itself. Pavilion today continues operating as 
normal under Nulty's supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Pavilion also tried to get a court order blocking the DOC from pursuing its 
intention to shut Pavilion down, but Pavilion lost that round. So the parties 
are scheduled to argue the matter before an administrative law judge Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, Nulty started Pavilion in February, 1989, and has 
been in the escrow business overall for nine years. She deferred comment on the 
DOC case to her lawyer.

DEFENSE FIRM TAKES THE OFFENSIVE; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: OCEAN TECHNOLOGY OF BURBANK HAS ITS SIGHTS SET ON FOREIGN CUSTOMERS TO 
MAKE UP FOR AN EXPECTED 10% DECLINE IN SALES TO THE U.S. MILITARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For most companies, flat sales are a sign of bad times, but in the defense 
industry these days it's not bad. Ocean Technology Inc. in Burbank, a small 
defense contractor, expects its sales to hold steady this year at about $33 
million and hopes to record a small increase next year. 
</P>
<P>
That's because Ocean Technology plans to make up for an expected 10% decline in 
sales to the U.S. military by increasing its share of foreign business. It 
intends to boost sales to Taiwan, where it has already sold some voice 
communications systems and color display monitors used on naval ships, 
submarines and aircraft. And it plans to start selling soon to Korea, Malaysia, 
Turkey and Greece. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working very hard on the foreign marketplace," said John M. Molloy, 
Ocean Technology's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean Technology is a subsidiary of Alltel Corp., a telecommunications company 
from Hudson, Ohio. Ocean Technology's biggest domestic contracts are for 
providing Trident submarines with signal data converters -- box-shaped devices 
that transmit computer data and commands to weapons and typically cost upward 
of $250,000 -- and for color computer monitors that display data for weapons 
systems operators on the Aegis-class cruisers, some of which are now stationed 
in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
But over the next several years, cuts in the U.S. defense budget are expected 
to slow the building of new ships and submarines -- Ocean Technology's biggest 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Selling to foreign countries "is one of the major strategies of most companies 
in the defense industry," said Reeve Darling, a Los Angeles defense consultant 
and chairman of the President's Roundtable, a group of about 50 defense 
industry chief executives. 
</P>
<P>
Darling said many foreign countries are eager to buy sophisticated 
American-made military equipment. "Any country that wants to protect itself has 
a significant demand" for the types of products that Ocean Technology makes, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Others are less enthusiastic, however, about the strategy of turning to foreign 
markets to compensate for a decline in domestic military spending. "I'm a real 
skeptic about foreign sales," said Michael Beltramo, a Los Angeles defense 
analyst. Why? Because selling in foreign markets often means years of 
groundwork, packaging older technology to suit military systems that aren't as 
sophisticated as ours and dealing with a bureaucratic maze to get U.S. 
government approval to make the sales. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a long-term commitment," Beltramo said. 
</P>
<P>
Molloy said Ocean Technology actually made the commitment to boost foreign 
sales six years ago, when the Reagan-era defense buildup was still under way. 
Even then, he said, the company saw that the good times for defense contractors 
couldn't last forever. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense budget always goes up, but it always comes back down again," 
Molloy said. When the U.S. has finished a defense buildup, that's when foreign 
demand for American military goods typically starts picking up, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Selling overseas often requires years of maneuvering. Ocean Technology's entree 
to the foreign market is a case in point. In 1984, it had been doing research 
and development for General Electric, which was working on a program to sell 
mobile radar systems to Taiwan. Ocean Technology wanted to get in on the 
program by selling its color display monitors as part of the systems. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving a license from the U.S. government to make a proposal to 
Taiwan, Ocean Technology executives spent the next year shuffling back and 
forth to Taiwan for technical briefings. When the Taiwanese finally awarded the 
contract to build prototypes to GE and Ocean Technology, another license was 
needed from the U.S. government -- yet another months-long delay. 
</P>
<P>
Years later, some monitors have finally been delivered to Taiwan for testing. 
"If they're happy, we'll go to production and we'll sell to Taiwan for the next 
three to four years," Molloy said. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean Technology also has a contract with Taiwan to sell voice systems that 
link communications between ships or aircraft. It hopes to land contracts to 
provide the systems to Korea and Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
The company also has big hopes for its new MK 53 fire control system, which 
combines a signal data converter, color graphics display and computer into one 
system for launching weapons. The MK 53 takes input from sonar, analyzes it and 
presents the data on the monitor. When the operator on a ship gets ready to 
fire a torpedo, for example, the computer provides data on where to point the 
launcher, the projected distance and radar to track the torpedo when it hits 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
Molloy said Ocean Technology won the U.S. Navy contract to supply the MK 53 two 
years ago over competitors including Honeywell, Unisys and Librascope, a 
Glendale-based defense contractor. The contract is worth about $50 million over 
a four-year period, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now the company hopes to secure orders for the MK 53 from Taiwan, Korea and 
Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
The key to making sure its products are marketable in foreign countries -- and 
permitted by the U.S. government -- is to piggyback on foreign sales of ships 
and aircraft, Molloy said. For instance, if a sale of submarine or an F-16 
aircraft is made to a foreign country, Ocean Technology will try to follow with 
sales of the voice communications equipment or graphic displays that go on 
board. 
</P>
<P>
When a planned sale of F-16s is made to Turkey in the near future, and expected 
sales of helicopters to Greece, for example, Ocean Technology hopes to win the 
contracts to provide the communications systems for those aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Ocean Technology's foreign business is done by its office in 
Washington, where transactions are arranged through the Pentagon or through 
foreign embassies. Like many smaller defense contractors, it also maintains 
relationships with independent marketing agents in foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean Technology was founded by Arnold Larson, a former Librascope engineer who 
left with six others in 1964 to start a new company. In 1985, they sold Ocean 
Technology to CP National, a Walnut Creek telecommunications company. When CP 
National merged with Alltel in December, 1989, Ocean Technology went along as 
part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Alltel now plans to sell Ocean Technology as part of its plan to focus on its 
core business. "It just doesn't fit our strategic long-range plans," said 
Alltel spokesman Ronald Payne. 
</P>
<P>
Alltel has hired the investment banking firm Stevens Inc. to find a buyer for 
Ocean Technology, but Payne declined to say how much Alltel was asking or if 
any discussions are under way. 
</P>
<P>
Molloy said there were no plans for a management-led buyout of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Larson, who stayed with the company through the changes in ownership, retired 
last year. President James Majewski, an engineer and former executive at 
McDonnell Douglas and H.R. Textron, joined the company in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
At Ocean Technology's Burbank headquarters a staff of about 50 engineers design 
and update equipment. The parts are made by various subcontractors, then 
assembled at the Burbank plant. The company's work force totals about 400, 
including service offices in San Diego and Newport, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
Though the defense industry is likely heading into a slump that could last for 
several years, Molloy said, "Everything isn't going to go to zero." Ocean 
Technology hopes to keep government funding for research and development and 
also cash in on the need for refurbishing old equipment. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he said, "what the foreign business does is let you sell the 
things you've already developed."

CHEROKEE SCRAPS $40-MILLION INITIAL PUBLIC STOCK OFFERING; 
</P>
<P>
APPAREL: THE SUNLAND FASHION MANUFACTURER CITES WALL STREET'S SLIDE IN 
CANCELING THE SALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cherokee Inc., citing the stock market's severe slump, said it scrapped plans 
to go public with a $40-million-plus stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was not a surprise. Cherokee, a privately owned Sunland apparel 
maker that specializes in women's sports clothing, had said last month that 
unless the market enjoyed a quick rebound, the company would probably cancel 
its offering. 
</P>
<P>
Many companies, in fact, have been forced to withdraw or postpone initial 
public offerings because of the market's slide. Investors, especially 
institutional investors such as pension funds, are refusing to buy new untested 
issues at a time when even the market's blue chip stocks are taking a pounding. 
</P>
<P>
Cherokee was particularly vulnerable because of the inherent fickleness of the 
fashion business, and the checkered health of the apparel industry's customers, 
the retailers. However, some analysts have said Cherokee's primary customers, 
such as the Mervyn's department-store unit of Dayton Hudson Corp., are in 
relatively good shape. 
</P>
<P>
Some aspects of Cherokee's offering also might have put off some investors. 
Cherokee offered 4 million shares of Class B stock that it expected to sell for 
between $10 and $12 a share, raising between $40 million and $48 million. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Class B shares would have had only a 10th of a vote each, compared 
with the full vote accorded each of Cherokee's Class A shares, which are held 
by Cherokee's current owners and executives. In other words, buyers of the 
Class B stock would have contributed significant equity to Cherokee, but would 
have had very little impact on Cherokee's governance. 
</P>
<P>
Cherokee planned to use the offering's proceeds to whittle down its debt, which 
totaled $171.1 million as of June 2, when its fiscal year ended. (In fiscal 
1990, Cherokee lost $224,000 on sales of $208.6 million; the loss stemmed from 
$28.1 million in debt interest costs.) Now, the company will have to find other 
means of paring the debt. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the debt was incurred last year, when a group led by Cherokee 
executives and investment banker Jeffrey S. Deutschman bought the then-publicly 
held company from its stockholders in a $174-million leveraged buyout. In a 
leveraged buyout, the company is purchased with mostly borrowed money secured 
by the company's assets. 
</P>
<P>
Cherokee had stated in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that 
even without the offering, the company's operations generate enough cash to 
cover Cherokee's debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
The canceled offering also means Cherokee President Robert Margolis and 
Cherokee's other owners will be deprived of a paper profit of more than $40 
million. The executives were not planning to sell their stock in the offering, 
but had the sale gone through, the market value of their stock -- at $10 to $12 
a share -- would have been $40 million higher than what they originally paid 
for the shares. 
</P>
<P>
But Cherokee's executives aren't hurting. Cherokee paid Margolis a $1.2-million 
bonus in fiscal 1990 in addition to his $400,000 salary, according to 
Cherokee's annual financial report to the SEC. All of Cherokee's eight 
executive officers were paid a total of $2.84 million in bonuses that year.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: AMWEST'S 3RD-QUARTER PROFIT DOUBLES FROM '89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amwest Insurance Group Inc., a Woodland Hills marketer of bail bonds and other 
surety bonds, said its third-quarter profit more than doubled from a year 
earlier, to $1.76 million from $729,000. 
</P>
<P>
The higher earnings in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 were largely due to a 
onetime gain of $797,000 that stemmed from Amwest's termination of a previously 
established reserve account. 
</P>
<P>
The reserve was set up in case Amwest had to pay rebates under Proposition 103, 
the insurance-reform initiative that is being debated in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
In August, however, legislators exempted surety companies from major provisions 
of Proposition 103, enabling Amwest to close its reserve account. 
</P>
<P>
Amwest's first-quarter net premiums earned -- an insurance industry gauge of 
total revenue -- rose 25% to $12.1 million from $9.68 million. For the first 
nine months of 1990, Amwest's profit jumped to $3.41 million from $2.31 
million, and its net premiums earned rose 29% to $34.5 million from $26.8 
million.

SCULPTOR TONY CRAGG'S URBAN RENEWAL OF THE PASTORAL TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you didn't already know better, you could be forgiven for thinking, at first 
glance, that the 15-year survey of sculpture by Tony Cragg opening today at the 
Newport Harbor Art Museum is, in fact, a group show. Cragg is nothing if not 
diverse in his approach to sculptural materials and artistic forms. 
</P>
<P>
There are figurative images on the wall made from bits of discarded plastic, 
constructions of carved and polished stone or plaster, cast-iron and -bronze 
forms, joined pieces made of sawed or lathed or painted wood and, finally, 
assemblages brought together wholly from found objects. If the survey is not 
truly comprehensive as a catalogue of the artist's materials and motifs -- this 
is not, after all, a career retrospective -- it nonetheless admirably suggests 
the breadth in a fairly tight number of works (34 in all). 
</P>
<P>
Still, something important and "of a piece" clearly emerges from the diversity 
in the exhibition. In an odd way, that unifying feature is less a coherent and 
clearly defined subject than it is a larger sense of ambition -- not merely 
ambition of a personal sort, but a powerful drive to open up a formidable 
tradition that had become clogged and restrictive. Cragg has lived in the 
rather obscure German town of Wuppertal since 1977, but he is nonetheless 
British for it (he was born in Liverpool). And what lurks throughout the work 
assembled in Newport is a visceral desire to take on -- and reform -- the 
venerable British tradition of the pastoral landscape. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony Cragg: Sculpture 1975-1990" is the first substantive survey of the 
41-year-old artist's work to be seen in the United States, and one of the rare 
opportunities we've yet had to see Cragg's sculpture in Southern California. 
Organized by Paul Schimmel, former senior curator at Newport and now the holder 
of that post at the Museum of Contemporary Art, the show concentrates on 
sculptures made in the last five years (more than two-thirds of the 
exhibition), with but a single work from the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The focus is apt. Cragg first came to wide attention with his so-called 
"mosaic" sculptures, made from fragments of plastic refuse scavenged from the 
alley and the gutter, and the present exhibition includes four of those works 
made before 1987. And it was in 1987 that the Newport Harbor Art Museum hosted 
"A Quiet Revolution: British Sculpture Since 1965," a traveling six-artist 
survey (including Cragg) that provided a useful background for American 
audiences and on which this more incisive examination builds. 
</P>
<P>
The show is not installed chronologically, thematically or by medium in the 
museum's galleries and outdoor patios, but rather by a feel for visual 
contiguity and fit. Call this method of display itself a mosaic, and a key to 
Cragg's often impressive endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
His earliest plastic mosaic sculpture, located in a rear gallery, is a 
rectangular floor piece, 8 feet wide and 12 deep, titled "New Stones -- 
Newton's Tones" (1978). It is composed from what look like archeological 
potsherds of industrial civilization. Piles of plastic flotsam -- a blue bottle 
cap, the yellow handle of a toy shovel, a red fork, the green cab of a kid's 
truck, etc., as well as lots of indecipherable little remnants, have been 
sorted out by color and arranged on the floor to form the bars of a spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
The "new stones" of the title are a not-so-subtle reference to the sculpture of 
British artist Richard Long, who, in 1967, made a work called "A Line Made by 
Walking England," in which he walked a straight line back and forth across a 
grassy field until the line was clearly visible in the trodden path; this he 
photographed. Subsequently, Long's walks through the English countryside 
developed into a procedure whereby he gathered sticks and stones along the way, 
and brought them back to the gallery for arrangement in a (usually geometric) 
sculptural form that would contain a kind of "physical memory" of the landscape 
as experienced. 
</P>
<P>
Cragg's "new stones" consist of industrial refuse collected on voyages through 
the urban landscape. Manmade materials are provocatively set up as direct 
equivalents for Long's natural, romantically inflected ones. The plastic 
mosaic's titular reference to Sir Isaac Newton, English mathematician and 
natural philosopher, underlines the assertion. 
</P>
<P>
What's odd about "New Stones -- Newton's Tones," and what may have called forth 
the figurative motifs for subsequent mosaics, is the way your eye reads the 
material stuff from which it is made. A sequential refinement occurs: rectangle 
subdivides into spectrum, which divides into individual colors; these break 
down into a tonal array of diverse reds, yellows, blues, etc., which divide 
again into actual objects such as bottle caps and "abstract" bits of plastic; 
last but not least, the sculpture splits between solid and void, figure and 
ground. Having thus found yourself drawn into refined connoisseurship of 
individually material being, any arrangement of these plastic bits into a 
recognizable picture simply adds yet another layer of pleasurable complication 
to the interdependence of the figure and its ground. 
</P>
<P>
Cragg first went to art school in 1968, not long after Richard Long had 
documented his pastoral walk, and Cragg made his pivotal mosaic sculpture the 
year after he took his master's degree from London's Royal College of Art. 
Given Long's engagement of the pastoral tradition through sculptural means, and 
given Cragg's confident elaboration of Long's achievement, "walking England" 
leads straight to the front door of Henry Moore, whose pierced sculptures 
literally allowed the landscape to merge with the sensual body. 
</P>
<P>
It's important to remember just how imposing a figure Moore was at the time. 
His artistic reputation having consolidated in the 1950s, Moore was by then the 
most famous living artist in Great Britain and the premier modernist sculptor 
in the world. For a generation born in England after World War II, Moore's 
example and his legacy must have been daunting. 
</P>
<P>
The most imposing and beautiful work in the Newport show is a large, untitled 
1988 bronze that stands in relation to Moore's sensuously reclining, pierced 
sculptural forms as Cragg's plastic mosaics do to Long's gathered stones. One 
side of a 7-foot-tall vessel, reminiscent of a laboratory beaker, is stretched 
and pulled into space as if the bronze was really taffy. The extruded form 
swells and twists in a buoyantly organic and airy way, the beaker's mouth 
elongated into a graceful, liquid curve. The upright beaker shape and the 
voluptuous open form move in and out of view as you walk around the sculpture, 
interpenetrating one another with an unmistakably sexual charge. 
</P>
<P>
A fundamental difference between this sculpture and anything Moore ever did 
will be found in the nature of its emphatic materiality. Moore worked in 
bronze, but typically for the sake of its durability; bronze was used to cast 
forms originally conceived as carved masses. Cragg's extruded beaker is, by 
contrast, a literally fluid vessel, whose image, shape and material echoes the 
very process involved in casting molten metal. The industrial, 
process-orientation of post-Minimal sculpture has marvelously materialized in 
what would have seemed to be a stubbornly resistant medium. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony Cragg: Sculpture 1975 -- 1990" remains at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, 
850 San Clemente Dr., Newport Beach, to Dec. 30. Tonight at 8 p.m., Cragg will 
lecture at the Student Center, UC Irvine.

For the second week in a row, Steven Seagal proved hard to top at the weekend 
box office. 20th Century Fox's "Marked for Death" had ticket sales of $7.4 
million, a 30% drop from its opening weekend take, bringing its total grosses 
to nearly $22 million. With ticket sales of $5 million, Warner Bros.' 
</P>
<P>
WWII drama "Memphis Belle" soared to second place. Among other new titles: 
Disney / Touchstone's fantasy "Mr. Destiny" grossed $2.9 million on 727 screens 
(an average of $4,115), for seventh place. Paramount's coming-of-age comedy 
"Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael" was ninth with $1.7 million on 635 screens (an 
average of $2,762). 
</P>
<P>
* Orion Pictures' "The Hot Spot" -- directed by Dennis Hopper, and starring Don 
Johnson as a drifter who becomes trapped in a steamy love triangle -- grossed 
$112,188 in limited release on 23 screens, for a modest opening average of 
$4,878. In its second week, Barry Levinson's "Avalon" earned $201,574 on seven 
screens, a huge per-screen average of $28,796.

A New Identity for Costner: The Sioux Nation has decided to make Kevin Costner 
an adopted member of the tribe in appreciation of his sensitive portrayal of 
the Sioux people as director and star of the film, "Dances With Wolves," due 
out in theaters Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
The Sioux nation will adopt Costner as a brother of Sinte Gleska College, the 
place where Costner and his crew were given a crash course in Lakota, the Sioux 
language. About 30% of the movie is in Lakota, with subtitles. Costner and 
co-producer Jim Wilson and co-star Mary McDonnell will all be adopted in a 
ceremony in Washington on Friday . CLAUDIA PUIG

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN;

Thanks to conductor David Amos, some of San Diego's most notable music-making 
this month will take place in London. Working with three local musical 
colleagues -- violist Karen Elaine, baritone Sheldon Merel and San Diego State 
University resident composer David Ward-Steinman -- the globe-trotting Amos 
will make three recordings of American music with three London orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
Known locally as the music director of the Jewish Community Center Orchestra, 
Amos began recording in Israel several years ago. When he completes the London 
project, Amos will have made seven recordings this year, a respectable tally 
for a conductor not connected with a major orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
By offering record companies musical programs off the beaten track -- Amos does 
not see his own complete Beethoven symphony series in the offing -- the San 
Diego conductor has found his niche. Labor costs in England, Israel and Poland, 
where Amos made two recordings in June, are significantly lower than comparable 
costs in the United States, so recording companies can afford to speculate on 
this type of music. 
</P>
<P>
Amos has specialized in music written by composers he knows and with whom he 
has worked. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are looking for music to record, the best method is to ask a composer 
which of his compositions he thinks has been undeservedly neglected," Amos 
said. Ward-Steinman, for example, was eager to have his Chamber Concerto No. 2 
preserved on disc. Amos and the City Sinfonia of London are recording it this 
afternoon for Harmonia Mundi records, with the composer on hand to offer his 
interpretive counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Another composition on the Ward-Steinman disc will be Norman Dello Joio's 
"Lyric Fantasies," with Elaine performing the viola solo. Dello Joio, a 
Pulitzer prize-winner and one of the elder statesmen of U.S. composers, wrote 
"Lyric Fantasies," which is really a viola concerto, in 1973. Amos spoke with 
the retired composer while he was preparing his conductor's score for the 
upcoming recording session. 
</P>
<P>
Merel, longtime cantor at San Diego's Congregation Beth Israel, will perform 
the vocal solos in Alan Hovhaness' "Shepherd of Israel," to be recorded with 
London's Philharmonia Orchestra. Amos has recorded several of the 
Armenian-American composer's works recently, including a critically 
well-received account of Hovhaness' "And God Created Great Whales." 
</P>
<P>
A busy recording schedule is the bread and butter of the various London 
orchestras, but according to Amos, the British musicians keep a good sense of 
humor about the nonstop projects. But they are sufficiently jaded to size up a 
guest conductor very quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"I once asked a London concertmaster (the British call them 'leaders') how long 
it typically took the musicians to evaluate a conductor once he started a 
rehearsal. 'We know if he'll be any good before he steps on the podium,' was 
the unhesitating reply." 
</P>
<P>
Vocal relief. While most U.S. opera houses are well into their fall 
productions, local opera buffs must mark time until San Diego Opera's season 
opens in January. Temporary relief is in sight, however, with a pair of vocal 
recitals sponsored by the local company at La Jolla's Sherwood Auditorium. 
Sunday at 7 p.m., German tenor Hans Peter Blochwitz will make his American 
recital debut, and the following Sunday, Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky 
will sing his only West Coast recital this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Blochwitz, who made his stage debut in 1984 as Lensky in Tchaikovsky's "Eugene 
Onegin," made his Metropolitan Opera debut last month in Mozart's "Don 
Giovanni." As Don Ottavio, a role he will sing for San Diego Opera in 1993, New 
York Times music critic Donal Henahan praised Blochwitz for "his silvery tone 
and a pliantly phrased 'Dalla sua pace' ." For the San Francisco Opera, 
Blochwitz sang Idamante in Mozart's "Idomeneo." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's program will be devoted to two complete song cycles, Schubert's "Die 
schone Mullerin" and Robert Schumann's "Dichterliebe." Blochwitz will be 
accompanied by Australian pianist Peter Grunberg. Although the Hvorostovsky 
recital is sold out, some tickets are available from the opera office for 
Blochwitz. 
</P>
<P>
Requiem for Rozsnyai. The San Diego Symphony's Oct. 19 performance of Gabriel 
Faure's Requiem will be dedicated to Zoltan Rozsnyai, who died last month. The 
symphony's music director from 1976-71, Rozsnyai conducted the orchestra's 
first commercial recording. Current music director Yoav Talmi will conduct this 
performance of the Requiem, assisted by the La Jolla Civic-University Chorus, 
soprano Sivan Rotem and baritone Hector Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
Another new music director. Kerry Duse will fill the post left vacant by the 
recent death of Zoltan Rozsnyai. Duse has been rehearsing the International 
Orchestra at United States International University for the last few weeks and 
will make his debut in his new role with the ensemble Dec. 14, 8 p.m., in La 
Jolla's Sherwood Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
At USIU, Duse has directed more than 30 musical-theater productions and has 
also conducted ballet and pops concerts with the International Orchestra. 
Before his association with USIU, the California native spent five years as 
music director of Canada's Royal Winnipeg Ballet. He had a similar post with 
the Banff Festival Ballet and was principal pianist with Switzerland's Geneva 
Opera.

'TWELFTH NIGHT' IN LA JOLLA . . . AS YOU MIGHT LIKE IT

<P>
No one will accuse Des McAnuff of wanting for imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Following his witty staging of "A Funny Thing Happened On the Way to the Forum" 
this summer, he has now delivered a Shakespearean semi-equivalent to cap the 
season at the La Jolla Playhouse. It is "Twelfth Night," that comedy of 
star-crossed twins and star-crossed lovers, that opened Sunday as an outrageous 
hodge-podge of periods, plunkings, pictures and pranks. 
</P>
<P>
The jokes are on every level. The lyricism . . . that's another matter. How 
well this "Twelfth Night" agrees with you will depend on the size of your 
appetite for the eclectic. 
</P>
<P>
It is, however, impossible not to admire it -- if not for the individual 
performances, which can be disappointing, then for the improbable coherence of 
its visual and aural incongruities: the massive Venetian Palazzo beauty of 
designer Neil Patel's faux-marble walls, archways and floors, and the 
shimmering Adriatic projected beyond them; the ruthless scrambling of periods 
in Christina Haatainen's costume design, ranging from Elizabethan to Victorian 
to modern, with Sir Toby Belch (Clarence Felder) looking like the March Hare 
and Sir Andrew Aguecheek (William Youmans) like a refugee from Le Cirque du 
Soleil. 
</P>
<P>
Even wilder and more distinctive is the tangy electronic sound of the music for 
the Shakespearean songs that McAnuff co-composed with Michael Roth (who 
performs them with relish). 
</P>
<P>
If this lunacy had to breakdown somewhere, it does so in the less persuasive 
cross-gendering of Curio (Tracey Leigh) and Valentine (Kari McGee), attendants 
to the lovesick Duke Orsino (James Morrison), who come off as wimpy henchmen. 
Casting women in those male roles fools no one, certainly, but it does support 
the plausibility of the acceptance of Viola as Cesario (played with inviting 
self-assurance by a gamin Molly Hagan). 
</P>
<P>
Plausibility, however, is not what "Twelfth Night" is about, especially not 
this one. 
</P>
<P>
What's plausible in a story of twins separated by shipwreck, in which the girl 
for no terrific reason decides to dress up as a boy and seek employment with a 
Duke? What's plausible about a Duke who sends him/her to press his suit with 
the woman he loves, the lady Olivia (Lisa Pelikan) instead of doing it himself? 
And what's plausible about that woman promptly falling in love with the 
androgynous messenger? 
</P>
<P>
As for subplot, it is the implausible buffoonery of the triumph of the servant 
Maria (Katherine Hiler), the rake Sir Toby and the wimp Sir Andrew over the 
puritanical Malvolio (Mark Bramhall). 
</P>
<P>
Scratch plausible. If anything is supported in this production it is the 
totality of the director's deconstructionist habits and his compleat creative 
control. Make that grip. The zaniness of that vision may not be for all 
markets, but a "Twelfth Night" set, at various times in a steam room, on a 
tennis court, in a Williams-Sonoma kitchen with suspended refrigerator, and 
where Sir Toby and his crew order pizza, can't be all bad. 
</P>
<P>
It's not. Its weakest elements are the actors, particularly Morrison and 
Pelikan who look every inch their regal parts but speak the speech less than 
trippingly on the tongue. Excepted from this criticism are Hagan, Bramhall's 
Malvolio (who can be colorless, but is always clear), Daniel Jenkins' strumming 
troubadour of a Feste, Zaraawar Mistry's Antonio and Evan MacKenzie's 
Sebastian. 
</P>
<P>
The triumvirate of real fools -- Felder's Toby, Youmans' Aguecheek and Hiler's 
lisping Maria -- are lucidly vociferous and funny (though we could do without 
Aguecheek throwing up, thank you), but more as the instruments of McAnuff's 
comedic imagination than on their own initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The production is quintessentially a director's confection -- distinguished 
more for the way McAnuff has manipulated his strings than the individual 
contributions of his players. The advantage is a conceptual unity that would 
not have seemed possible given the disparate mix of ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
Since there is no accounting for taste, it's take it or leave it. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I'll take it -- including a final, sobering image that tacitly 
presages a changing of the guard and the discomforting arrival of more chilling 
and repressive times. One may, without any great leap of faith, draw the 
appropriate contemporary parallels.

'THE FOURTH MAN': A TALE OF STEROIDS IN THE HIGH SCHOOL LOCKER ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today's well-acted "CBS Schoolbreak Special: The Fourth Man" (at 3 p.m. on 
Channels 2 and 8) dramatizes the statistic that an estimated 7% or more of all 
high school athletes are on steroids. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Billingsley ("A Christmas Story"), is Joey, the brainy, non-athletic son 
of a former football hero. 
</P>
<P>
Dad (Tim Rossovich), lukewarm to Joey's intellectual triumphs, makes a big fuss 
over Joey's best friend Steve (Vince Vaughn), a star athlete. 
</P>
<P>
Joey, determined to please his father, decides to try out for the track team. 
He is fast enough to qualify, but the coach says he will have to work to stay 
on the team. 
</P>
<P>
When weight training and a special diet don't get quick results, a sports 
equipment store employee "helps" Joey with steroids. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, the drug's side affects take their toll. Bouts of unreasonable anger 
dismay the people who care about him, his schoolwork suffers and, inevitably, a 
near-fatal collapse reveals his secret. 
</P>
<P>
The script, by director Joanna Lee and Annie Caroline Schuler, is predictable, 
with strong, key emotional scenes between Joey and Steve and Joey and Dad, 
although you do wonder why Joey's "smart" mom (Adrienne Barbeau) hasn't set 
insensitive Dad straight. 
</P>
<P>
But the pain comes across, and so do the pressures that so many school athletes 
find themselves under: peer and parent approval, the coach, the big win tied to 
a school's prestige. LYNNE HEFFLEY

RICK DU BROW: A 'SIMPSONS' DEMOGRAPHICS LESSON

<TEXT>
<P>
TV or not TV. . . . 
</P>
<P>
BREAKDOWN: Eye-opening demographics disclose just how "The Simpsons" virtually 
tied "The Cosby Show" last week in their ratings matchup. 
</P>
<P>
It's only one week -- but the Fox cartoon's smashing season debut came about 
like this: 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six percent of kids 2-11 and more than 50% of youngsters 12-17 tuned in 
"The Simpsons." What's more, 50% of men 18-34 and 42% of men 18-49 also watched 
Bart Simpson and his animated family. 
</P>
<P>
The figures for women fans of "The Simpsons" were slightly lower but still 
impressive -- 41% of females 18-34 and 36% of those 18-49 watched the show's 
fall premiere. 
</P>
<P>
Among folks 50 and older, there was almost no "Simpsons" audience: 8% of the 
men and 6% of the women. 
</P>
<P>
"Cosby" was more consistent across the board, but it's still more popular with 
women, kids and teens than with men. 
</P>
<P>
"The Simpsons" actually tied "Cosby" in the key category of overall audience 
share -- with each show attracting 29% of the nation's viewers. 
</P>
<P>
That figure probably stunned the fledgling Fox network as much as anybody. 
</P>
<P>
"Cosby" barely edged out "The Simpsons" by one-tenth of a point in total 
household ratings. But even an NBC source expressed amazement at the tight 
competition because NBC has 208 stations and Fox has lined up only 133 thus 
far. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the whopping "Simpsons" performance, Fox still finished third for the 
night -- not only behind NBC, but also ABC as viewers 50 and older went solidly 
for a two-hour "Columbo" with Peter Falk. 
</P>
<P>
MAESTRO: Leonard Bernstein, who died Sunday, gave TV some of its happiest 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
His "Young People's Concerts" on CBS in the 1950s and '60s were joyful 
excursions into musical learning. He seemed to be having more fun than anyone. 
</P>
<P>
He also appeared on the great "Omnibus" series. And he remained a TV presence 
through the years on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
It is certainly a sign of the times that there is no room for a series like the 
"Young People's Concerts" on any commercial TV network today. 
</P>
<P>
MOLLY: Blair Brown had said earlier this year that she would like to continue 
in "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd," which Lifetime cable picked up after 
NBC canceled it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a diary of a woman," said the series star. 
</P>
<P>
But after Lifetime last week disclosed the imminent end of "Molly," a spokesman 
for the channel said: 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it had run its course, creatively speaking. The show is not what it 
was." 
</P>
<P>
"Molly," created by producer-writer Jay Tarses, has focused on a single, 
independent-minded career woman living in New York. When the most recent 
original episodes ended in a cliffhanger this year, she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
And in its final 13 new episodes that begin in January, the father will be 
revealed. 
</P>
<P>
The coming episodes will have "a lot of closures," says the Lifetime spokesman. 
"The series will come to an end, come together nicely." 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe. But the end of "Molly" is TV's loss. It went its own quirky way 
and became something special. At least, however, Lifetime will have rerun 
rights to "Molly" through 1992. 
</P>
<P>
AFTERMATH: KCET Channel 28 registered its most-watched day ever with its Sept. 
30 rerun of the entire PBS documentary series "The Civil War." In fact, the 
show's original run, just days before, gave KCET the most-watched week in its 
history. 
</P>
<P>
CLOUT: New acquisition Michael Tuck is the most authoritative anchor KCBS 
Channel 2 has had in years. His recent 11 p.m. teaming with Bree Walker 
improved and sharpened her performance considerably. 
</P>
<P>
THE LADY VANISHES: If Susan Dey does indeed leave "L.A. Law" after this season, 
there'll be a lot less reason to watch it. 
</P>
<P>
BY GEORGE: Did you know that George Burns, whom we salute each week by using 
his "Say good night, Gracie" punch line, can be heard delivering it to Gracie 
each Saturday night when KNX Radio runs the old "Burns &amp; Allen" series at 
9:30? Don't miss it. Holds up great. And it's part of a classic radio hour: 
Reruns of "The Jack Benny Show" precede it at 9. 
</P>
<P>
PROGRESS REPORT: Always liked the way Richard Beymer hung in there after his 
weak, early career portrayals in the films "West Side Story" and "Hemingway's 
Adventures of a Young Man." What a pleasure it is to see him now as a 
commanding actor in "Twin Peaks" -- as unscrupulous mogul Benjamin Horne. 
</P>
<P>
SICK, SICK, SICK: At least it was a gag -- a terrific one -- when the 
principals in the 1968 movie "The Producers" connived to put on an intentional 
flop called "Springtime for Hitler" -- and cheat their backers. But now comes 
the report of a planned British sitcom about the home life of Adolf Hitler, his 
lover Eva Braun and their Jewish neighbors, titled "Heil Honey, I'm Home" and 
set in 1960s Hollywood. It's the most repulsive show business notion in memory. 
</P>
<P>
GAME PLAN: Look, if Oakland has Cincinnati in its hip pocket by 7 tonight in 
the first game of the World Series, no problem. Just flip over to superstation 
TBS at 7:05 and you can catch the ever-wondrous "American Graffiti." 
</P>
<P>
NIGHTWATCH: CBS' new Charles Kuralt-Lesley Stahl series, "America Tonight," 
isn't doing badly in the ratings considering that it's not cleared in a number 
of top markets. But CBS doesn't seem to realize that Kuralt and not Stahl is 
the natural center of the show. 
</P>
<P>
BEING THERE: Caught "To Have and Have Not" on KTLA Channel 5, and when Lauren 
Bacall and Walter Brennan truck on out of that nightclub, with Humphrey Bogart 
in tow -- well, folks, that's about as good as movie endings get. 
</P>
<P>
Say good night, Gracie. . . .

DRUG RAIDERS FIND ARSENAL IN RESIDENCE; 
</P>
<P>
SIMI VALLEY: AUTHORITIES SEIZE 125 FIREARMS, 100 BLADED WEAPONS AND $750,000 
WORTH OF COCAINE. THREE ARE ARRESTED. 
</P>

<P>
An arsenal of knives, grenades and machine guns was described by law 
enforcement authorities Monday as the largest collection of weaponry ever 
seized during a drug raid in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they found 125 firearms and 100 bladed weapons -- along with 
$750,000 worth of cocaine -- in an upstairs bedroom when they stormed a Simi 
Valley house on Sunday and arrested Gardner Ernest Flockhart, 31, a suspected 
high-level cocaine dealer. 
</P>
<P>
"This is incredible," said Sgt. Steve Bowman, supervisor of the Ventura Police 
Department's narcotics division. "I haven't found any policeman who's seen this 
many guns in one place at one time." 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said it was the most extensive collection found 
during a drug raid in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure culminated a six-month investigation by local law-enforcement 
agencies into a ring suspected of distributing cocaine to residents of Ventura 
and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation of Robert Dale Lloyd, 27, an alleged drug courier from 
Ventura, led to Flockhart, who is believed to be his supplier, Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Lloyd allegedly delivered one kilogram of cocaine to an undercover 
officer in a parking lot in Simi Valley and was immediately arrested on 
suspicion of sale of a controlled substance and possession for sale of a 
controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
Police then served search warrants on Lloyd's Ventura auto-repair business and 
his house on El Medio Street, where they found half an ounce of cocaine 
packaged for sale and arrested his wife Sharon Lloyd, 32, on suspicion of 
possession of a controlled substance for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Police also raided Flockhart's house, where they found $50,000 worth of guns, 
12 pounds of cocaine with an estimated street value of $750,000 and more than 
$500,000 in cash -- including Krugerrands, silver ingots and antique coins, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"One room was a veritable arsenal and supermarket for cocaine dealing," Bowman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When officers entered the residence, they found Flockhart in the upstairs 
arsenal standing next to a hand grenade, Bowman said. Flockhart was arrested 
without incident on suspicion of sale of a controlled substance, possession of 
a controlled substance for sale and federal firearms violations. 
</P>
<P>
Flockhart's girlfriend, Christine Lynn Helenick, 28, was arrested on suspicion 
of possession of a controlled substance for sale. Brian Howard Mudge, 27, who 
also lived in the house, was arrested on suspicion of possession of a 
controlled substance for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Lloyd was being held in lieu of $20,000 bail in the Ventura County Jail, 
a jail spokesman said. Sharon Lloyd, Helenick and Mudge have been released on 
bail, police said. Flockhart remains in custody without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Flockhart, who describes himself as an unemployed actor, was convicted of 
possession of narcotics for sale in Los Angeles County in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
As a convicted felon, it is illegal for Flockhart to possess any firearms, 
Bowman said. If convicted in federal court, Flockhart could receive a 40-year 
prison sentence, Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that Flockhart, a gun enthusiast, traded drugs for the weapons. 
Bowman said it appears Flockhart used the guns primarily for target shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 125 firearms were 12 illegal weapons. They included four 
semiautomatic Uzi-type weapons, which had been converted to fully automatic 
machine guns. Some guns had been outfitted with silencers, and five rifles were 
fitted with illegally short barrels, Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
Flockhart also had Teflon-coated and armor-piercing bullets, which can 
penetrate the bulletproof vests used by police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors' items such as two $5,000 miniature replicas of machine guns also 
were found. The rest of the guns included pistols, semiautomatic assault 
rifles, shotguns and hunting rifles, Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three of the 100 bladed weapons also were illegal, Bowman said. They 
included six Shurikens, four-bladed weapons that are thrown like a Frisbee and 
designed to stick in the target. Five brass knuckles and 12 gravity knives, in 
which blades can be exposed with a flick of the wrist, also were found. 
</P>
<P>
One of Flockhart's neighbors, who asked not to be identified, said others 
suspected drug activity at the house but had no idea of the number of weapons 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big surprise, everything they found," the woman said. "None of us 
thought all that was over there." 
</P>
<P>
She said Flockhart, who had lived there about four years, enjoyed jogging and 
was an avid sportsman, going deer hunting and bringing home venison. 
</P>
<P>
All the guns seized in the raid Sunday will be forfeited to the state through 
asset-forfeiture laws if Flockhart is convicted, Bowman said. The knives will 
be ground up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The departments involved in the investigation stand to gain $700,000 to $1 
million through state asset-forfeiture laws from the house, guns, six vehicles 
and other belongings. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 officers from five agencies were involved in the investigation -- the 
Ventura Police Department, Oxnard Police Department, Simi Valley Police 
Department, Ventura County Sheriff's Department and the district attorney's 
office. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was called in to 
examine the firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman said he is sure that there are others above Flockhart, but added that 
there is nothing to indicate that Colombian drug cartels are involved. He said 
he does not expect more arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Also, authorities say there is no evidence that this case is linked to the 
August, 1989, bust in which a Simi Valley police investigation led to the 
seizure of more than a ton of cocaine in Newhall and Chatsworth. Ten M-60 
machine guns were seized during a raid that followed the breakup of a Colombian 
drug ring operating in the area.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-LITTLE LEAGUE COACH SENTENCED IN 
MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Lawndale Little League coach has been sentenced in Torrance Superior 
Court to three years in state prison for molesting two of his team members. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Steese, 34, pleaded no contest in June to two misdemeanor counts of 
molesting the boys, who were 10 and 11 when the incidents occurred last 
December and April at Steese's home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence imposed by Judge John P. Shook was less than the five-year term 
recommended by Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Geltz. 
</P>
<P>
Steese's conviction marks the second time in two years that a local league 
volunteer has been arrested for molestation. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Lawndale Little League team manager William Anthony Boguille, 
23, pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor counts of sexual battery for 
regularly pulling down his players' pants to spank them. Boguille denied that 
those events constituted molestation.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: RESERVE SEABEES TRAIN FOR COMBAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Navy reserve battalion of Seabees from four Eastern states began annual 
training this week at the Port Hueneme naval base, with an emphasis on combat 
readiness to prepare the unit for a possible call to active duty, officials 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 23, based at Ft. 
</P>
<P>
Belvoir, Va., brought 640 reservists to the Port Hueneme base, said Navy 
spokeswoman Kassandra Gale. Usually, reservists train in smaller groups of 
about 200 to 300. 
</P>
<P>
This year's training is focused on "full-unit readiness." Seabee battalions, 
trained in construction trades as well as combat, include about 600 members. 
</P>
<P>
"They are here to review their construction and combat skills. It will be much 
more intensive in light of Operation Desert Shield," she said, referring to the 
buildup of U.S. forces in the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
The reservists from Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland will 
train in marksmanship and defense against chemical and biological weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The reserve unit is training in Port Hueneme because the nation's only other 
Seabee base, in Gulfport, Miss., is occupied by another Seabee reserve 
battalion. 
</P>
<P>
"Active-duty Seabee battalions have already been deployed in support of 
Operation Desert Shield, and it is prudent to bring our reserve battalions to 
the highest possible state of readiness," said Rear Adm. Paul C. Rosser, 
commander of the Reserve Naval Construction Force. 
</P>
<P>
Three of four Seabee battalions based at Port Hueneme are either in the Middle 
East or headed there. Meanwhile, the Navy has called about 40 members of a 
reserve Seabee unit in the area to active duty on the Port Hueneme base to fill 
in as clerks and record keepers, Gale said. KENNETH R. WEISS

PEN-PAL SERVICE FOR U.S. FORCES IS BUSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KASH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura resident Grace Baskin has about 800 letters piled on her dining room 
table and more in boxes on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
In the last three weeks, Baskin has gotten more than 2,000 pieces of mail from 
all over the country, which she has been forwarding to troops stationed in the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Baskin, 43, is the founder of the U.S. Forces Letters Brigade, a pen-pal 
service matching civilians with overseas military personnel. She founded the 
service three years ago, after rereading some of her own correspondence with a 
high school friend who was killed in Vietnam. The project began in a period of 
relative military calm, as Baskin's way to remind overseas service people that 
they are not forgotten in peacetime. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Middle East crisis began, Baskin has been in the news and has 
received mail from all over the country, including parcels of letters from 
elementary school children. So many letters have arrived that Baskin has been 
shipping them overseas in huge bundles, with no attempt made to match up 
civilians and service people. "We've been overwhelmed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 450 names on Baskin's list of people stateside who want to 
become regular correspondents with a service person. But Baskin has the names 
of only about 250 service people with which to pair them, although she 
continues to advertise in military papers. 
</P>
<P>
"I really would like to reach more of the troops," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Several parents who have been unable to contact their sons and daughters have 
sent frantic letters in care of the Letters Brigade. However, Baskin cannot 
send mail to individual service people who haven't contacted her. "I hated to 
do it, but I had to send them back," she said. "This is not a matchmaking 
service. Some of these girls go into detail about how good-looking they are." 
</P>
<P>
Baskin handles the letters with help from her husband, her sister and her two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Those wishing to send a letter or to add a service person's name to Baskin's 
list of potential pen pals may write to the U.S. Forces Letters Brigade, P.O. 
Box 4961, Ventura 93007. KIM KASH

STATE OKS $127,151 MARINA PARK GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Ventura received backing for a $127,151 grant to help restore 
Marina Park, a popular seaside playground and picnic spot that in recent years 
has suffered from storm damage and sea erosion. 
</P>
<P>
The Marina Park grant, one of 16 in California in the 1989-90 allocation from 
the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, must be presented to the National 
Park Service for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
It got preliminary approval from the state Parks and Recreation Department. 
</P>
<P>
Marina Park is on Pierpont Bay just north of the Ventura Marina at the southern 
tip of San Buenaventura State Beach. Its main attraction for the dozens of 
children who visit every day is an old pirate ship marooned on a sandlot. 
</P>
<P>
The grant would be used to repair walkways, replace security lights, restore 
dunes and do minor landscaping, said Rose Mary Bauer of the city Parks and 
Recreation Department. 
</P>
<P>
"The grant will help us complete the park restoration project we began two 
years ago," Bauer said. The city also allocated $258,400 of its own funds for 
improvements to Marina Park. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

FREE DAILY NEWSPAPER GOES BROKE, STOPS PUBLISHING AFTER 13 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura Today, a free daily newspaper delivered to 18,500 Ventura homes, has 
ceased publication after 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
The tabloid, which appeared Tuesdays through Saturdays, published its last 
edition on Saturday, said Steve Morris, president of the parent company, 
California Dailies Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Morris said the demise of Ventura Today marks the end of a journalistic 
experiment: a free paper delivered to all single-family houses in a target 
area, dependent entirely on advertising revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"There are papers doing that, but with street stands only, not home delivery," 
Morris said, citing successful free dailies in Vail and Aspen, Colo. "If we had 
had two years, we probably could have done it." 
</P>
<P>
Morris said the paper cost about $15,000 a week to publish and was getting back 
about half that much in revenue. "It's my fault for not raising enough 
capital," Morris said. "We were making solid revenue gains." 
</P>
<P>
An outside audit found that 73% of the people who received the paper read it, 
Morris said. "The community was great to us. We couldn't expect more out of 
them or our advertisers." 
</P>
<P>
Morris, a Ventura resident who formerly was publisher of the San Fernando 
Valley-based Daily News, said he has not decided what he will do next. The 
paper had a staff of 10, not counting carriers, and was printed by the Ojai 
Valley News. 
</P>
<P>
Executive Editor Curtis Robinson said the staff received no advance warning 
that the paper would close. "The shock is still setting in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Morris said the paper, which ranged from 16 to 28 pages, tried to fill a gap in 
coverage that resulted as other dailies adopted a regional focus. For example, 
Ventura Today published the entire agendas of the Ventura City Council and 
County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The paper, which subscribed to United Press International news service, also 
published summaries of state, national and world news, daily television 
listings, three comic strips and a stock market report. 
</P>
<P>
"I think on the editorial side, we did a really good job for a small paper," 
said Robinson, who supervised two news reporters and a sports writer. 
</P>
<P>
With the paper's closing, Robinson said, "there's one less voice out there . . 
. one less person that might come up with something the public needs to know 
about. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what people will miss most," Robinson said, "is the kind of attention 
we paid to issues both before and after the larger papers picked them up . . . 
they'll miss the localness of it. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll also miss it being free, I think. Certainly the price was right."

When people in Oak Park recycle, they're throwing dollars into the community's 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Operating the only drop-off center in the county that financially benefits a 
school district, Oak Park earns about $1,000 a month from newspapers, aluminum 
and soda bottles deposited at the Oak Park School District administration 
building, said Carla Beach, chairwoman of the Oak Park Recycling Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Since the center opened in March, the district's five schools have shared about 
$7,000 for field trips and other projects that deal primarily with the 
environment, Beach said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, a nonprofit group of volunteers and school and county officials, 
uses 10% of the money for maintenance and supplies for the center and gives the 
rest to the schools' parent organizations. It began working with county 
officials and the district a year ago to serve as a model for other districts 
in Ventura County, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
Children in Oak Park, a community of about 11,000 north of Agoura Hills, will 
expand the project this month by separating paper used in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
By separating paper by color, students gain experience in recycling and help 
cut the schools' trash bills, Beach said. 
</P>
<P>
"You know this will carry over into the homes," she said. "I see these children 
growing up to simply think of this as a matter of course. . . . You only throw 
away what you can't use anymore." 
</P>
<P>
In January, the district intends to introduce a curriculum packet for grades 
kindergarten through six to deal with air, energy and water conservation, said 
Victoria Hand, manager of the department's recycling effort. Such lessons would 
last about two weeks and offer teachers ideas for introducing conservation 
ethics into other subjects, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Sue Hearn said the district also plans to meet with its grounds staff to 
talk about composting yard waste. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole program has done a great deal to raise the level of awareness of 
children and their families," Hearn said. "It has the potential to raise a 
whole generation of children who are aware of their environment and willing to 
do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
The solid waste department is working with other areas in the county, including 
Bell Canyon and Piru, to attempt similar programs, Hand said. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Park "had a school district that wasn't too large. It was a perfect place 
to test out these programs," Hand said.

COUNTY TO BUY 13-ACRE SITE IN CHATSWORTH; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: SOUTHERN PACIFIC'S SALE OF THE PARCEL TO THE COUNTY IS EXPECTED TO 
SOOTH RESIDENTS WHO FEARED THAT A LUMBER TRANSFER STATION WOULD BE BUILT THERE. 
</P>

<P>
A 13-acre site in the heart of the Chatsworth commercial district will not be 
developed into a controversial lumber transfer station because it has been 
included in a $450-million package of property to be sold to the county's 
transportation agency by Southern Pacific, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Devonshire Street site is likely to become a transportation center where 
commuters can transfer among buses, shuttles and trains, said Nikolas 
Patsaouras, president of the Rapid Transit District board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
The site also could serve as the northern terminus of a proposed 16.5-mile 
bikeway that would start in North Hollywood, Patsaouras said. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference at the site Monday, Los Angeles City Councilman Hal 
Bernson hailed the purchase as a "very good thing for Chatsworth" and suggested 
that the Southern Pacific property could be the linchpin to stimulate 
redevelopment of the community's downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson, who represents the area, joined local civic and business leaders in 
calling for construction of a railroad station "that reflects the cultural and 
architectural heritage of Chatsworth." 
</P>
<P>
Members of Citizens for Chatsworth distributed photographs of the Old 
West-style Chatsworth train depot that was torn down in 1962 and suggested that 
a new station could be built to look like it. 
</P>
<P>
Community leaders were angered two months ago when they learned that Southern 
Pacific planned to develop the long-vacant site, which is next to the 
railroad's Coast Main Line, as a storage yard for lumber brought in by rail and 
bound for local builders and lumberyards. 
</P>
<P>
Activists said up to 70 lumber-hauling trucks a day would destroy the 
small-town ambience of Chatsworth and pose a safety hazard to a nearby 
elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Anderson, a Southern Pacific spokesman in San Francisco, said the railroad 
"has no alternative plans for a lumber transfer station elsewhere at this time, 
but we are studying the demand." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission and Southern 
Pacific announced agreement on the sale of 177 miles of railroad right of way 
that transit officials say will be used to dramatically expand the region's 
rail transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Fernando Valley, the purchase includes the east-west Burbank Branch 
freight line, which crosses the Valley from Burbank to Canoga Park parallel to 
Chandler and Victory boulevards and Oxnard and Topham streets before turning 
north parallel to Canoga Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
By 2001, the commission plans to extend the downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro 
Rail subway west along the Burbank Branch line from North Hollywood to the San 
Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the purchase agreement announced Friday, the commission will obtain 
rent-free use of 69 miles of Southern Pacific's two main lines to the north, 
which diverge in Burbank. The agreement gives the commission track rights on 
these two lines from downtown Los Angeles to Moorpark and Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
The commission plans to launch commuter rail service on those lines within two 
years, carrying commuters downtown on intercity rail cars pulled by 
conventional diesel-electric locomotives. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also includes purchase of a 40-foot strip alongside Southern 
Pacific's Coast and San Joaquin lines for possible future light-rail lines 
similar to the Blue Line operating between Los Angeles and Long Beach.

TEE-OFF TIME IN FIGHT OVER WATER'S PATH; 
</P>
<P>
SEPULVEDA BASIN: ERNANI BERNARDI AND FELLOW GOLFERS COMPLAIN TO A CITY COUNCIL 
COMMITTEE ABOUT PLANS TO BISECT WOODLEY GOLF COURSE WITH A NEW PIPELINE 
PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi and a group of brightly clad fellow 
golfers testified Monday that plans to cut water pipelines across the 
city-owned Woodley Golf Course would needlessly disturb the city's already 
sorely pressed golfers. 
</P>
<P>
In remarks before a City Council committee now considering a motion Bernardi 
introduced about the pipeline project, Bernardi, an avid Woodley player, 
complained "that it's about time golfers got some consideration." 
</P>
<P>
The project would bisect the Woodley course, cutting across eight fairways and 
forcing them to be shortened for at least two months. An average of 110,000 
rounds are played each year at the flat Sepulveda Basin course, which is 
popular with seniors. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Tom Bradley's office and city engineers said the golfers' plea to 
have the two pipelines dogleg an additional 2,000 feet around the Woodley 
course would add an unacceptable $700,000 cost to a major public works project. 
</P>
<P>
The $9-million project is the first leg of a far-reaching plan to use treated 
effluent from the Tillman sewage treatment plant immediately east of Woodley to 
irrigate golf courses and city parks in the San Fernando Valley. Tillman water 
is now dumped into the Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
In the initial phase, Tillman water flowing through one pipeline would be used 
to irrigate Woodley and the basin's two other courses, Encino and Balboa. A 
second pipeline in the same trench would be used to fill up the newly created 
Balboa Lake, north and west of Woodley. Now just an empty hole, Balboa Lake is 
to be used for boating and fishing upon completion of the pipeline project. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor is trying to be patient about this project, and he's running out of 
patience," John Stoddard, Bradley's top environmental aide, said in an 
interview. "The issue of these golf concerns should not hang up this project, 
especially with a drought." 
</P>
<P>
After hearing from both sides, members of the City Council's Arts, Health and 
Humanities Committee said the city should not pick up the extra tab for 
realigning the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
But if the golfers would pay the extra cost, that would be fine, said 
Councilman Joel Wachs, the panel's chairman. "I'd be willing to go with that," 
Wachs told Bernardi. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Tregnan, president emeritus of the L.A. Municipal Golfers Assn., the 
lobbying arm of the golf community, said he would endorse a surcharge on 
existing green fees at all 13 city-owned courses to pay for the extra cost if 
he were assured the costs were not inflated. 
</P>
<P>
Tregnan, wearing a red blazer with golf patches on it, said he believes current 
cost estimates for rerouting the pipeline are too high. 
</P>
<P>
Any change in greens fees -- now $10.50 for 18-hole weekday play, $14.50 for 
weekend games -- must be approved by the city's Recreation and Parks 
Commission. About 1.2 million paid rounds are played each year on the city's 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
Before he could endorse a fee hike, Tregnan said he would want the city's 
Recreation and Parks Department to verify the costs of a new route. The 
$700,000 estimate is based on an analysis by a private engineering firm and the 
city's Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
Golfer skepticism about the costs have gotten a sympathetic ear from the city's 
parks department. 
</P>
<P>
"The department staff's position is that nobody really knows what the extra 
costs would be," said Frank Catania, director of the parks department's 
planning unit. 
</P>
<P>
The department hopes the city's Board of Public Works, which is now in charge 
of overseeing the pipeline project, will authorize the design of two routes -- 
one across Woodley and one around it -- and put them both out to bid among 
contractors. That would finally determine what the real cost differential would 
be, if any, Catania said. 
</P>
<P>
Catania and Tregnan also noted that the $700,000 in extra costs does not 
account for lost revenues to the parks department from Woodley's golf 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Catania predicted the pipeline-laying project would result in $50,000 to 
$100,000 in lost revenues from a drop in use of the course by golfers and from 
reduced greens fees charged players. Typically, fees are cut when the courses 
are not fully playable. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said in an interview later that the "City Council can raise the 
questions, but the parks department can actually stop the work. We're going 
back before the committee next Monday, and by then, we want to get some more 
figures -- where they get this $700,000."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 7TH PERSON ARRESTED IN PARTY SHOOT-OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A seventh person was arrested in connection with what detectives characterized 
as a racially motivated shoot-out at a Tarzana party that left four people 
injured, Los Angeles police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Anello, 19, of Encino was arrested Sunday on suspicion of attempted 
murder in the Friday night gunfight that erupted between a white supremacist 
gang and a black gang at a house party in the 4700 block of Hermano Drive, 
Detective Joe Diglio said. 
</P>
<P>
Anello, who was acting as a bouncer at the racially mixed party attended by 
about 200 people, allegedly pulled a gun and fired it during the confused 
shoot-out in the street outside the house, Diglio said. Four people were 
wounded in the cross-fire. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, a member of the white supremacist gang shouted "white 
power" and opened fire with a shotgun during the party. As party-goers 
scattered into the street, white gang members exchanged gunfire with black gang 
members, police said.

POLICE REVISE ACCOUNT OF SHOOTING BY OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Glendale police on Monday changed their account of an officer-involved 
shooting, saying that police, and not an elderly man, fired the first shot in 
an exchange that critically wounded the 85-year-old Glendale resident. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles County sheriff's shooting reconstruction team was summoned Monday 
to the Glendale home where three police officers shot Albert Levinson Rackin, 
who had reportedly threatened them with a flare gun Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale police Sgt. Peter A. Michael said the deputies were hired to help 
police supervisors interpret how the exchange of gunfire took place. 
</P>
<P>
Michael said Glendale police will finish their internal probe within two weeks, 
then report to the district attorney's office, which will decide whether to 
conduct its own investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Rackin, who lived alone in a small rental house in south Glendale, had been 
described Saturday by police as being in his mid-60s. He remained in critical 
condition Monday at Glendale Memorial Hospital, said hospital spokesman Bryan 
Bishop. Police said he was shot several times in the upper torso. 
</P>
<P>
Rackin's neighbors called paramedics because he appeared to be suffering from 
diabetes-related problems, Michael said. The paramedics who arrived at the home 
called police when Rackin threatened them with the flare gun. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said they confronted Rackin at the door of the house, but he refused 
to drop the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale police initially reported that officers fired after Rackin shot at 
them. But Michael said further investigation determined that police fired first 
"to protect one of the officers" when Rackin moved toward the policeman. 
</P>
<P>
After the officers fired, Rackin discharged the flare gun, but the round landed 
behind police, Michael said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers who fired their weapons were identified Monday as Sgt. Don 
Meredith, an 18-year veteran of the department and officers Stephen Robertson 
and Robert Breckenridge, who have each been with the department for three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Michael said the department had not yet determined Monday which officer shot 
first and how many rounds were fired.

ATTORNEY SAYS AFFAIR, PLAN TO SELL FIRM LED TO SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Tarzana woman shot and killed her millionaire husband in anger because he had 
been having an affair for 12 years and because she feared his plans to sell his 
import-export business would decrease the value of his estate, a prosecutor 
alleged in Van Nuys Superior Court on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney for defendant Carole Evelyn Mellinger, however, argued in his 
opening statement that Mellinger was simply very drunk and thought she was 
shooting a burglar when she fired four shots into her husband, Brainerd, last 
Jan. 24 in the den of their posh hillside home. 
</P>
<P>
The contrasting views emerged during the opening day of testimony in 
Mellinger's trial on charges of first-degree murder. Mellinger, 48, has pleaded 
not guilty and is free on $400,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
"Ladies and gentlemen, this case has all the makings of a finely written soap 
opera but the tragedy is, it all happened," Deputy Dist. Atty. Ann Korban told 
jurors who will decide Mellinger's fate. 
</P>
<P>
The Mellingers had been married for 23 years but Brainerd Mellinger had a 
mistress with whom he had been having a 12-year affair, Korban said in 
detailing a motive for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Mellinger also was upset with her husband's plan to sell his company, Korban 
said. Although the couple had a premarital agreement specifying that Mellinger 
would get no money if the couple divorced, she was the primary beneficiary of 
her husband's will, Korban said. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock provided the bulk of the estate and Mellinger feared that 
the sale of the company would decrease her share, Korban said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Caruso, one of Mellinger's two attorneys, did not dispute that his client 
shot her husband. But he said it was an accident. 
</P>
<P>
Mellinger came to work for her husband when she was 19 years old, and they were 
"very much in love with each other." She knew about the mistress and about 
other affairs her husband had had, Caruso said. 
</P>
<P>
Mellinger had been the victim of a peeping Tom in the past and her husband had 
said he would be out of town the night of the shooting, Caruso said. He said 
Brainerd Mellinger had given his wife the handgun with which she shot him, 
saying "if anybody breaks into the house, shoot to kill." 
</P>
<P>
Mellinger had a blood-alcohol level of .19% and .18% in two tests taken by 
police five to six hours after her arrest, the attorney added. Her 
blood-alcohol content therefore could have been as high as .30%, nearly four 
times the legal limit, Caruso said. 
</P>
<P>
In other testimony, Los Angeles Police Officer Jerry Fritz testified that 
Mellinger discussed the city's gang problems as he drove her to the police 
station after the shooting, never inquiring about her husband's condition.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: VALLEY FEDERAL POSTS $5.45-MILLION PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Valley Federal Savings and Loan in Van Nuys said it "slightly exceeded" 
earnings targets that the capital-poor thrift agreed upon with the federal 
government, posting a profit of $5.45 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 
30, compared to a loss of $70.7 million in the same quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Federal is required to meet targets in a capital plan approved in May by 
the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, since the S&amp;L falls far short of 
requirements for capital reserves, which are meant to provide a cushion against 
potential losses. 
</P>
<P>
As of Sept. 30, Valley Federal had a deficit of $22.3 million in tangible 
capital; that measure is essentially equal to the net worth of the institution 
minus the value of some non-cash assets. But that marks an improvement since 
Dec. 31, 1989, when Valley Federal had a tangible capital deficit of $43.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine months that ended Sept. 30, Valley Federal earned $21.5 million, 
compared to a loss of $73 million for the period in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Federal had total assets on Sept. 30 of $2.72 billion, a 14% decline 
from $3.17 billion a year ago.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: CAMERA PLATFORMS, UST AGREE ON EXCHANGE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Valencia-based Camera Platforms International Inc. and a subsidiary of UST 
Inc., formerly U.S. Tobacco, have agreed in principle to a stock-for-debt swap, 
which calls for UST to cancel the debt owed to it by Camera Platforms in 
exchange for shares of Camera Platforms' common stock. 
</P>
<P>
Camera Platforms, which rents cars mounted with cameras to the film and TV 
industries, owes UST $11.5 million. Under the agreement, the debt will be 
exchanged for 8.83 million Camera Platforms shares at $1.30 per share. After 
the swap, UST would own 9.43 million Camera Platforms shares, or 76% of the 
total outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
UST also holds an option to purchase 500,000 shares of Camera Platforms stock 
owned by a principal shareholder.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: CINE-SOURCE STOCK FALLS AS 'TEXASVILLE' FALTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock of Universal City-based Cine-Source Inc. has collapsed from $6 on 
Oct. 7 to 21.875 cents as of Monday's close. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps investors have noticed that "Texasville," the Peter 
Bogdanovich-directed sequel to the "Last Picture Show," hasn't turned out to be 
the box office success that Cine-Source, the film's co-producer,was hoping for. 
Since its opening Sept. 28, "Texasville" has taken in a paltry $1.93 million in 
ticket receipts. 
</P>
<P>
The film was the first project for Cine-Source, which lined up $24 million from 
investors to finance the production, promotion and advertising costs.

SCALPEL VS. NO-SCALPEL VASECTOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vasectomy is a popular male contraceptive option. An estimated 336,000 
vasectomies were performed in 1987, according to the Association for Voluntary 
Surgical Contraception. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more doctors have begun to perform a "no-scalpel" technique, 
which uses a clamp-like instrument to pierce the skin. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors disagree on which technique is better. Here, two doctors debate the 
traditional versus no-scalpel techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 No-Scalpel: Dr. Barton Wachs, urologist, Long Beach Memorial Medical Center; 
clinical instructor in urology at Harbor/UCLA Medical Center 
</P>
<P>
 "When a physician says, 'Hand me the scalpel,' or 'May I have the knife?' men 
about to undergo a vasectomy get scared. 
</P>
<P>
"With a no-scalpel vasectomy, they do not hear this. In this technique, the 
scrotal skin is infiltrated with local anesthesia. A ringed forceps traps the 
vas deferens (sperm-carrying duct) against the skin. 
</P>
<P>
"A sharpened hemostat (a clamp-like instrument) pierces the skin. The vas is 
cut in half and occluded by a standard technique such as cautery, tying off 
with a suture or cutting. 
</P>
<P>
"The puncture wound contracts to a few millimeters immediately, eliminating the 
need for sutures, and leaves little or no scar. There is no bleeding. There is 
less pain. Patients are told not to lift anything or exercise for 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"The chance for reversal is the same for both techniques. This method makes 
vasectomy more attractive, especially for men who fear the knife." 
</P>
<P>
Traditional: Dr. Stanwood S. Schmidt, a Eureka, Calif., urologist; author of 
published studies on vasectomy 
</P>
<P>
 "What is the old saying about 'Don't be the first to accept or the last to 
reject something new?' 
</P>
<P>
"Traditional vasectomy works fine. I use local anesthesia and verbal analgesia 
to talk patients through it. The scalpel provides a cleaner job. As far as the 
length of the incision, I make it no longer than a half-inch. Then I cut the 
(sperm-carrying) tube and cauterize each end. 
</P>
<P>
"I do put a stitch in the skin. I could do it without a stitch, but it is safer 
with a stitch. Most (patients) are back to work the next day. I see them four 
or five days later to check the wound and take out the stitches. 
</P>
<P>
"Most doctors who have jumped on the no-scalpel bandwagon are not surgeons but 
general practice physicians who do vasectomies occasionally."

RESEARCHERS IDENTIFY SOME RISK FACTORS FOR MENTAL ILLNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As experts become convinced that many mental disorders begin in childhood and 
adolescence, responsibility for recognizing problems is shifting to parents, 
teachers, pediatricians and youth counselors. 
</P>
<P>
But researchers can give adults only vague guidelines to help them assess 
whether children are at risk for mental disorders or show symptoms of an 
emerging problem. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers, for example, know that genetic factors are linked to autism and 
some learning disabilities; that head injury or exposure to toxic substances 
puts some children at risk for behavior disorders; that psychological trauma, 
such as physical or sexual abuse, increases the risk of such mental illnesses 
as multiple-personality disorder. 
</P>
<P>
But, says Michael Goldstein, of the UCLA department of psychology, "These risk 
factors need to be honed down to those that have high reliability and high 
predictability. I'm not sure we're there yet." 
</P>
<P>
Experts often group risk factors for mental disorders into four areas: 
</P>
<P>
* Biological risk factors, including genetic defects; very low birth weight; 
chronic physical conditions, such as deafness or blindness; illness, such as 
diabetes or asthma; physical trauma, or exposure to toxic chemicals or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
* Psychological risk factors, including low intelligence, learning difficulties 
and deficits in sensory perception. 
</P>
<P>
* Social risk factors, including poverty, homelessness, over-crowded living 
conditions, inadequate schooling, neighborhood disorganization and poor peer 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
* Familial risk factors, including poor prenatal care, a very young or mature 
mother, parental criminality, maternal mental disorder, severe marital discord, 
poor parental supervision, erratic discipline, child abuse and placement of a 
youngster in a series of foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
But much research remains to be done before the association between these risk 
factors and the emergence of a mental disorder can be understood. 
</P>
<P>
While many mental disorders are thought to have a biological cause, little is 
known, for example, about which genes might predispose an individual to a 
particular disorder, says Dr. James F. Leckman, a child psychiatrist at Yale 
University. Technological skills to understand genetic defects are within 
reach, he says, but little research is directed at causes of child psychiatric 
disorders: "There are fewer than 100 child psychiatrists in the nation who 
devote 30% or more of their time to research." 
</P>
<P>
Leckman blames the low priority given to child psychiatric research to the 
stigma associated with mental disorders; the relatively low status of 
professionals working with children, especially impaired children, and the fact 
that the field of mental health is overwhelmed with providing services for the 
ill, leaving little time for basic research. 
</P>
<P>
Research into the social and familial risk factors is equally vague, says Gail 
Wyatt, who studies psychological effects of childhood physical and sexual abuse 
at UCLA's Neuropsychiatric Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Abused children tend to develop sleeping and eating problems, withdraw from 
friends and have problems concentrating in school. Girls tend to become 
depressed and withdrawn while boys act out. "Children are often punished, 
rather than treated, for their mental health problems," she says. "But these 
are classic mental health problems that in the past have not been associated 
with sexual abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Children with low intelligence or learning disabilities are also vulnerable to 
mental disorders, says Claire Kopp, a developmental psychologist at UCLA. 
Cognitive problems can lead to aggression, conduct disorders and psychosis. 
</P>
<P>
"These children are greatly neglected because there are many complexities 
involved," she says. "They tend to fall through the cracks because they are so 
easy to miss in terms of mental disorders." 
</P>
<P>
Also far from clear is how certain family relationships and problems affect 
children, Goldstein says. "It has been difficult until recently to obtain 
clear-cut evidence about the type of family disturbances that cause problems," 
he says. "Some children are more vulnerable than others. Some family 
disturbances are more toxic than others." 
</P>
<P>
In general, the risk of having a mental disorder increases with the number of 
risk factors. One study found that the likelihood of having a mental disorder 
increased tenfold when four or more risk factors were present. 
</P>
<P>
Children with cognitive difficulties often fare worse, for example, when 
adverse rearing conditions are present, Kopp says. And depression is 
increasingly seen by experts as a precursor to substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
One study showed that a major depressive episode among 18- to 30-year-olds 
doubles the risk of subsequent drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"It's usually the behavioral problems that start first," says Dr. Adrian 
Angold, a Duke University researcher. "These kids do not just have substance 
abuse problems, they have a variety of emotional and behavioral problems as 
well. If we focus just on substance abuse, we're missing the point. We need to 
start before the individual has even seen alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
Besides pinpointing the predictability of risk factors, researchers are trying 
to learn more about "protective factors" that seem to make some children immune 
to psychological injury no matter what they experience in life. 
</P>
<P>
Although less well-understood, these factors are thought to include: early 
prenatal care, good maternal nutrition, a loving relationship with at least one 
parent or other adult, consistent parental supervision and discipline, 
cognitive training, social skills training and improved peer relations. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're learning . . . is how to tie together risk and protective factors 
with specific disorders," says Dr. Felton J. Earls, a professor of child 
psychiatry at Harvard. "We're beginning to make some progress. We have to 
understand something about timing and the combination of risk factors."

JAPAN'S HOLLYWOOD SCOUTS; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: A TROIKA OF INSIDERS IS GUIDING JAPANESE INVESTORS EAGER TO TAKE ON THE 
RISKY WORLD OF FILMMAKING IN AMERICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Japanese come calling in Hollywood, one of their first stops is 
usually talent agent Michael Ovitz's sleek new I. M. Pei building in the heart 
of Beverly Hills, attorney Peter Dekom's elegant wood-paneled office high above 
Sunset Boulevard, or Jake Eberts' table at the Polo Lounge in the Beverly Hills 
Hotel, where the London-based producer frequently resides. 
</P>
<P>
Ovitz, Dekom and Eberts are part of an elite corps of Hollywood insiders who 
have served as location scouts for Japanese investors eager to get into the 
glamorous -- but risky -- world of moviemaking. Not content to rely only on New 
York investment bankers, the Japanese have turned to Hollywood's insiders to 
advise them on talent and movie projects, to sort out the charlatans and 
self-promoters from the true success stories, to make introductions to 
trustworthy business partners. 
</P>
<P>
"The history of outside investments in Hollywood has been a fairly unfortunate 
one," says Christopher Murray, an O'Melveny &amp; Myers attorney who worked on 
the recent formation of Media International Corp., a $200-million consortium of 
major Japanese companies that will fund everything from movie production to 
sports programming. Adds Robert Cort, president of Interscope Communications: 
"A lot of people who have come into Hollywood have done so with a real sense of 
arrogance." 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese want to avoid the mistakes of past investors. 
</P>
<P>
In Hollywood, reality is rarely what it appears to be. An executive producer 
credit can mean no more than that the lucky recipient finagled part of an 
option on a movie script. A movie that looks like a box-office hit can actually 
be a money loser. A star with a household name could be at the brink of a 
career slide. 
</P>
<P>
"Investment bankers can evaluate the worth of an investment on the basis of 
economics," says Lee Rosenberg, a partner with Triad Artists talent agency. "We 
see things from a different perspective -- the human element, the creative 
side." 
</P>
<P>
That's where Japan's Hollywood-based contacts come in. Forty-three-old Dekom 
cuts his own swath in the cliquish world of Hollywood. He and his firm -- 
Bloom, Dekom &amp; Hergott -- are known for doing more than simply giving legal 
advice to such clients as actors Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Kim 
Basinger, directors George Lucas and Ron Howard, and producers Don Simpson and 
Jerry Bruckheimer. Dekom and his partners also know who's up and who's down, 
which companies are in need of cash, and which studio executive is coming in or 
going out (Universal Pictures Chairman Thomas Pollock was a partner in the 
firm, and clients have included 20th Century Fox chairman Joe Roth and former 
Columbia Pictures President Dawn Steel). 
</P>
<P>
About three years ago, JVC/Victor Co. of Japan joined the firm's roster, with 
Dekom and his partner Melanie Cook doing general legal work for the company. 
Then JVC officials said they wanted to invest in Hollywood. Dekom looked around 
at the options, but didn't like what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
"In those days, people were submitting things to Japan (for financing) that 
they couldn't get any other way," Dekom recalls. So Dekom proposed what he 
calls his "home-grown" solution. He introduced JVC to another client, producer 
Lawrence Gordon. The Japanese last year agreed to invest $100 million in equity 
and debt guarantees in a new company called Largo Entertainment to be run by 
Gordon. Dekom designed the business plan (in return he was given a small 
ownership position), and JVC agreed to cede total creative control to Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
Eberts was no stranger to international financing or moviemaking. The former 
Canadian chemical engineer and financier founded the independent film company 
Goldcrest, which released such Oscar-winning pictures as "Chariots of Fire" and 
"Gandhi" before its demise (which Eberts has chronicled in a new book, "My 
Indecision Is Final"). Eberts has strong ties to such English film people as 
David Puttnam and Richard Attenborough and has raised money for filmmaking 
efforts from overseas sources. 
</P>
<P>
Nomura Babcock &amp; Brown -- a joint venture between the Japanese securities 
giant and an American financing firm -- plucked Eberts' name off a short list 
of major Hollywood producers and put him to work looking for investment 
opportunities. "He was a consultant, advising us on the inner workings of the 
industry." says Richard Koffey, managing director of Babcock &amp; Brown, the 
San Francisco firm that has teamed with Nomura Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
Eberts helped the company settle on a strategy of cautiously wading into 
Hollywood's murky waters with a couple of $100-million investments in 
well-capitalized independents. Murray served as Nomura's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
After Eberts made the introductions, Nomura Babcock invested $100 million in 
Morgan Creek films (now distributed by Warner Bros.) and committed to at least 
$100 million investment in Interscope movies to be distributed and co-financed 
by Disney. Both independent companies have enjoyed strong success: Morgan Creek 
with films like "Young Guns"; Interscope with hits like "Three Men and a Baby." 
</P>
<P>
Eberts, who declined to discuss the details of either deal, noted that once an 
introduction is made, the Japanese -- or their American partners -- take over 
the negotiations and his role is phased out. Morgan Creek chief executive James 
Robinson, for example, has negotiated directly with Nomura Babcock since that 
first introduction more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese have a tendency to do a lot of reconnaissance," says Robinson. 
"While initially they use intermediaries, once they get into a deal, they will 
use their own people." 
</P>
<P>
The point man who has made the biggest splash is Ovitz, now advising Matsushita 
Electric Industrial Co. on its hoped-for buyout of MCA, owner of Universal 
Pictures -- a deal that could be worth anywhere from $6 billion to $8 billion. 
Industry sources say CAA has been advising Japanese companies for five years 
now, but it wasn't until Ovitz's name popped up in Sony's search for a studio 
that some details about his sideline business surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1988, Sony hired Ovitz as a consultant once it began shopping in 
earnest for a Hollywood studio. His connection to Sony came through the former 
chief of Sony's CBS Records unit, Walter Yetnikoff, according to industry 
sources. Yetnikoff's relationship with Ovitz dated back to his movie deal with 
Disney, which Ovitz had brokered. (Out of that deal came just one movie credit 
for Yetnikoff -- as executive producer on "Ruthless People.") 
</P>
<P>
According to insiders, Sony officials who met Ovitz were particularly impressed 
by his early and accurate predictions of box-office and Academy Award attention 
for "Rain Man," a film starring CAA clients Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise and 
directed by CAA client Barry Levinson. 
</P>
<P>
Sony already had an investment bank on retainer -- New York's Blackstone Group 
-- but it needed Ovitz to give an insider's view on studios that it was 
interested in buying, particularly MGM/UA, Columbia Pictures and MCA. His 
efforts included assessing each company's movie slate and valuing the studios' 
ties to talent. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the deal say Ovitz also smoothed rough waters between Sony's 
Yetnikoff and then-Columbia chief executive Victor Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
Ovitz's efforts apparently were impressive enough to earn a job offer from Sony 
once the Japanese company settled on Columbia Pictures. Ovitz turned it down, 
however, and Sony -- following Yetnikoff's advice -- hired producers Peter 
Guber and Jon Peters. 
</P>
<P>
Ovitz's role in leading Matsushita to MCA came as no surprise to those familiar 
with that Japanese company's corporate style. "(Matsushita executives) are not 
real risk takers," said Steven Clemons, executive director of the Japan America 
Society. "They are using Ovitz because he was successful with Sony." 
</P>
<P>
There remains widespread speculation inside Hollywood that Ovitz will 
eventually take a top job at MCA if the deal goes through, though CAA officials 
say there are no current plans for him to do so. Still, the speculation has 
been greeted with glee by competing agents, who are hoping that an Ovitz 
departure would weaken CAA, and some studio executives, who blame CAA's 
aggressive dealmaking on behalf of clients for the rise in movie production 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of Ovitz's future plans, these Japanese connections could be quite 
lucrative for CAA. It is unclear what the agency earned for its Sony services 
-- or what it will earn if Matsushita's bid for MCA goes through. But 
knowledgeable industry sources say it is possible that CAA could make the 
equivalent of an investment banker's fee, or .5% of the total deal. On an $8 
billion buyout of MCA, that fee would be $40 million. (While CAA's total 
revenues are a closely guarded secret, some very rough estimates put them at 
about $70 million.) 
</P>
<P>
Given the potential earnings from acting as Japan's tour guides, it's little 
wonder that other talent agencies also are turning their attention in that 
direction. ICM has advised some Japanese media concerns in the past and is 
expected to do much more in the future. Triad's Rosenberg has made trips to 
Japan to drum up business for his agency. 
</P>
<P>
At this point there appears to be plenty of business to go around. When 
attorney Murray spoke at a Tokyo seminar on Hollywood investment last spring, 
the room was packed with representatives of industries as diverse as steel and 
energy. "Even Osaka Gas sent several representatives," he noted. "That would be 
like SoCal Edison investing in Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, major Japanese companies have started financing 
Hollywood movies and looking for takeover targets among the major studios. The 
electronics giant Sony Corp. bought Columbia Pictures last year for $3.4 
billion. Matsushita Electric Industrial Corp. is now considering a buyout of 
MCA, which owns Universal Pictures, for a reported $6 billion to $8 billion. In 
these, as well as much smaller deals, the Japanese have turned to Hollywood 
insiders to provide needed expertise on movies, actors and entertainment 
executives.

MOVIE: THE WRITERS OF 'MARKED FOR DEATH' AND STEVEN SEAGAL ARE STILL FEUDING 
OVER SCRIPT CREDIT. 
</P>

<P>
The writers-producers of "Marked for Death" are thrilled that their low-budget, 
wall-to-wall action picture grossed about as much at the box office during its 
first week in release as it cost to make. But Mark Victor and Michael Grais 
aren't interested in engaging their star, martial arts master Steven Seagal, in 
any kind of combat over the hit film's writing credit. 
</P>
<P>
Even after losing a dispute for writing credit before an arbitration board of 
the Writers Guild of America, the tall, lean, pony-tailed Seagal has continued 
to raise the credit issue in recent interviews and during an appearance on a 
late-night talk show. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured it out -- I rewrote 93% of their script," said Seagal in an 
interview with The Times by telephone from the Brooklyn location of his current 
film, "The Price of Our Blood." "It hurts me when I read lines (in reviews) 
like, 'They tailor-made the action scenes for Steven Seagal.' That's a total 
joke." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not really looking to get into a confrontation with Steven Seagal or 
anyone else about who wrote what," said Grais, during a joint interview with 
Victor in a West Hollywood hotel. "The record in the Writers Guild speaks for 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
The experience with Seagal has been a strange turn of events for Victor and 
Grais, who spotted the actor in his first leading role -- 1988's "Above the 
Law" -- and were convinced he would become a major star. Now that "Marked for 
Death" has confirmed their judgment, they find themselves at long-distance odds 
with him. Besides his above-the-line billing in "Marked for Death," Seagal also 
receives co-production credit with Victor and Grais. 
</P>
<P>
Seagal reserved his strongest comments for the Writers Guild of America 
arbitration committee that ruled against him. "They're responsible for some of 
the most unjust, ridiculous legislation anywhere in the film business," said 
Seagal, adding that he'd "never again go through the arbitration process." 
</P>
<P>
"Seagal also has claimed that he wrote over 90% of his last movie, 'Hard to 
Kill,' which he didn't get screenplay credit for, either," Victor said. 
"Somewhere there seems to be some misunderstanding as to what gets screen 
credit from Steven's point of view." 
</P>
<P>
In "Marked for Death," Seagal plays a retired drug-enforcement agency cop who 
moves back home to suburban Chicago and discovers the drug scene flourishing in 
his old neighborhood. He finds himself facing a Jamaican drug lord, Screwface, 
who casts a death sentence on Seagal and his family. 
</P>
<P>
The film has been No. 1 in the box office during its first 10 days in release 
and its nearly $22 million in grosses marks it as the first big hit of the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Victor and Grais would prefer to shove the feud with Seagal into the background 
and bask in a success that was a long time coming. Friends since fourth grade, 
the pair became writing partners early in their careers and had co-written 
"Poltergeist" and "Poltergeist II" (which they also produced) before being 
introduced by their agent to Seagal. They said they decided immediately that 
they wanted to write a script for him. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, what happened is that we saw this guy and we said he could be the 
next Eastwood or Stallone," Grais said. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we viewed this was 'Dirty Harry' for the '90s," Victor said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus began a nearly three-year collaboration that would eventually produce 
"Marked for Death." They said they first went to Seagal, who had been familiar 
with their earlier Charles Bronson script, "Death Hunt," with a pitch for a 
Japanese-set action story. But they soon discovered it was too close to "Black 
Rain," a film then in production that starred Michael Douglas as an American 
cop who goes to Japan on assignment. 
</P>
<P>
As Seagal went to work on his second feature, "Hard to Kill," the pair wrote a 
script called "Screwface," based on the name of the Jamaican drug lord of the 
current film. "We wrote the movie on spec for Steven and stylized with him in 
mind," Victor said. "What subsequently happened was that we went out to raise 
the money. But we had a lot of difficulty doing that because 'Above the Law,' 
(Seagal's first film) was a marginal success and did not do well overseas." 
</P>
<P>
Among the studios to reject the project was Warner Bros., which has a 
multipicture deal with Seagal. But at the time, Victor and Grais speculated 
that the studio, not having had the success it envisioned for "Above the Law," 
wanted to wait and see how "Hard to Kill" would fare before green-lighting a 
third Seagal project. So the pair eventually took the film to 20th Century Fox, 
which agreed to distribute the film. 
</P>
<P>
That Seagal was not a box-office draw was a blessing as well as a curse, the 
partners said. It was one of the major factors -- among other economies they 
employed -- that allowed them to make the film on a $12-million budget, instead 
of the $40 million-plus budgets of most action pictures featuring high-salaried 
stars. By the time Seagal's "Hard to Kill" came out and became a major success, 
"Marked for Death" was already shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that you'd be able to make a movie again with Steven Seagal that 
would be under $20 million," Grais said. "Part of it is picking the right guy 
at the right time before he breaks and before he costs you $5 (million) to $10 
million."

KILLER HANDS: Four serial killers, including Randy Kraft and William Bonin from 
Orange County, spend their free hours on San Quentin's Death Row playing 
bridge, says the current Vanity Fair (E1). . . . Told of the card games, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Bryan Brown, who prosecuted both Kraft and Bonin, was incredulous. 
"We introduced evidence that Kraft had a death list of more than 65 people and 
Bonin had confessed to at least another 22 people, and they're up there playing 
bridge?" Chris Pasles and Tom McQueeney

HOLLY-SEACLIFF OKD BY COUNCIL OVER PROTESTS 
</P>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite pleas from residents to delay action, the City Council on Monday night 
voted 6 to 1 to approve a controversial development agreement for 
Holly-Seacliff, the biggest development project in the city's 86-year history. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement with Pacific Coast Homes, a sister firm of the Huntington Beach 
Co., came after rancorous debate and testimony from several citizens who 
accused the City Council of needlessly rushing the big project and bowing to 
the political dictates of the powerful Huntington Beach Co. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I've learned in my 25 years in Huntington Beach is that I don't 
trust the Huntington Beach Co.," said resident Dave Sullivan, in urging the 
council to scuttle the proposed agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But the council majority, including Councilman Peter M. Green, who usually 
sides with slow-growth elements, said they were convinced that the agreement 
overall would be good for the city. 
</P>
<P>
The sole opposing vote came from Councilwoman Grace Winchell, an environmental 
activist who said the city could get the same benefits that are in the 
development agreement simply by proceeding on a project-by-project basis. 
</P>
<P>
Winchell said she opposed the agreement because "it locks future councils in as 
to what may be needed for citizens of this city." 
</P>
<P>
The $1-billion, 15-year pact with Pacific Coast Homes calls for transforming 
545 acres once dotted by dozens of oil wells in northwest Huntington Beach into 
an upscale area of 3,780 residential units, four new parks and landscaped 
pockets of commercial and light-industrial areas. 
</P>
<P>
City planners say at least 10,000 new residents will move into the city as 
Holly-Seacliff evolves over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The council's approval of the long-range pact came despite fears expressed by 
some residents of the city tightening its bond with the controversial and 
influential Huntington Beach Co. 
</P>
<P>
The company and the city have had a symbiotic relationship since 1904, when the 
company took over the village of Pacific City, changed its name to Huntington 
Beach and began marketing residential lots. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Huntington Beach Co. and Pacific Coast Homes are now wholly owned by 
Chevron, and together the three entities are the largest land owners in the 
city. All three companies are heavily involved in the city's political 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry about this agreement being fulfilled because sometimes the Huntington 
Beach Co. acts as if it's above the law," Planning Commission Chairwoman Geri 
Ortega said last week. 
</P>
<P>
But the council majority said Monday night that Huntington Beach will gain 
substantial benefits from the development pact and that many safeguards are 
built into the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's good planning for the city and good planning for the future," 
said Mayor Thomas J. Mays. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement will allow the company to build 1,200 single-family homes and 
2,580 town houses and condominiums. The residences will range from townhouses 
expected to sell for about $250,000 to single-family estates with ocean views 
that will sell for $1 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Holman, project manager for the Huntington Beach Co., said the city has 
much to gain from the development. 
</P>
<P>
"The company is taking a financial risk in this because we have pledged to 
build all the infrastructure -- the roads and improvements -- before we do 
anything else," Holman said in an interview before Monday night's City Council 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Holman said the city, represented by new Huntington Beach Administrator Michael 
T. Uberuaga, proved to be a tough negotiator . . . "very tenacious." 
</P>
<P>
Uberuaga has said he is a hard-liner on development agreements because they 
generally prove to be more beneficial to developers than to city government. He 
told the council last week that he would not give his blessing to the 
Holly-Seacliff pact unless it contained "many things the city otherwise would 
not be able to obtain." He withheld his approval last week because the 
development company balked at agreeing to pay new fees on Holly-Seacliff -- 
fees that future city councils may enact during the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Coast Homes ultimately yielded to Uberuaga's insistence on accepting 
new fees. 
</P>
<P>
Following that concession, Uberuaga said he could now recommend approval of the 
pact because it contained several major items beneficial to the city. The 
agreement, he noted, also requires the developer to make the following: 
</P>
<P>
Give 41 acres of land to the county's new Bolsa Chica Linear Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
Donate an additional 12 acres of land for neighborhood parks in Holly-Seacliff. 
</P>
<P>
Build a new police substation and a new fire station, both in the 
Holly-Seacliff area. 
</P>
<P>
Construct a new water reservoir in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Widen and improve existing roads in the area and build several new ones. 
</P>
<P>
Pay double the city's existing traffic-impact fees.

Bernstein. . . . Last year, St. Clair toured Europe and the Soviet Union with 
Bernstein, and last August he subbed for the ailing conductor at Tanglewood, 
Mass. . . . "As soon as I heard the news, I felt a great emptiness and a great

COURTS: RULING PLACES 17-YEAR-OLD IN COUNTY JAIL. DEFENDANT FATALLY SHOT A BOY 
IN A SIMILAR INCIDENT FOUR YEARS AGO.

Richard H. Bourassa Jr., the 17-year-old Anaheim youth charged with murdering a 
classmate four years after he fatally shot another school friend, will be tried 
as an adult, a Juvenile Court judge ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The court finds that Richard Bourassa is an unfit subject to be processed in 
the Juvenile Court," said Juvenile Court Judge C. Robert Jameson. "I'm 
extremely offended at this offense and find it to be quite serious." 
</P>
<P>
Bourassa, prosecutors allege, killed Christian Wiedepuhl, 17, on May 24 while 
acting out a form of Russian roulette in the same room of his family's Anaheim 
Hills home and at the same hour of day that he fatally shot 13-year-old Jeffrey 
A. Bush. Bush's death on Sept. 13, 1986, was called an accident by police. 
</P>
<P>
Bourassa on Monday was transferred from Juvenile Hall to Orange County Jail and 
was being held in lieu of $200,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
During the two-day hearing to determine whether Bourassa should stand trial as 
an adult, Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathi Harper described the youth as having a 
fixation with guns. She alleged that Bourassa wrote a school English paper on 
them and was found to have advertisements for pellet guns in a duffel bag that 
also contained a picture captioned "Kill Saturday" and a letter with the 
reference, "Get that S.O.B." 
</P>
<P>
Harper declined to elaborate on the markings. Defense attorney Edward W. Hall 
said he believed that they did not relate to the victim and were merely doodles 
besides others such as "Richard and Allison forever." 
</P>
<P>
Hall had argued that there was no evidence that Bourassa intentionally killed 
his friend, and he tried unsuccessfully to discredit a probation officer who 
recommended that Bourassa be tried as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting, which was on a Thursday, involved a "high degree of 
sophistication and planning," Harper said, from the time he first thought about 
getting his stepfather's gun from his parents' bedroom before the shooting to 
the "whole big lie" he twice told police to "cover up" after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Harper contended that Bourassa retrieved the loaded five-chamber, .38-caliber 
handgun, removed one of the bullets and pointed the weapon at Wiedepuhl in a 
"reverse Russian-roulette" scheme. But, because he is dyslexic, he may have 
miscalculated the chamber's rotation and fired a live round when he thought he 
would hit the empty chamber, Harper explained outside court. 
</P>
<P>
This scenario, Harper said, would warrant a second-degree murder charge, for 
which the prosecution must show "implied malice" -- a wanton and willful 
disregard for the life and safety of another human being that resulted in 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said that even in that scenario, which his client denies, the prosecutor's 
evidence shows that the shooting was "very close to an accident, misadventure, 
misfortune, a tragic situation." 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, Bourassa told police that it was Wiedepuhl who got the gun 
from the bedroom and was pointing it around when Bourassa took the gun away. 
The gun accidentally fired as Wiedepuhl bent down to pick up the gun's holster, 
striking him in the head, Hall explained outside court. 
</P>
<P>
Hall told the judge that Bourassa, "rather then being someone who potentially 
plans things out and potentially covers them up, he is an individual involved 
in a tragic situation." 
</P>
<P>
Hall added that Bourassa's taped statements to a 911 dispatcher after the 
shooting indicated that he did not plan the incident. "He told the dispatcher 
'he's starting to turn over, what should I do?' and he made statements like 
'Oh, Christian how can I help?' and words to that effect. It would seem that 
someone who had planned (the shooting) would not have necessarily had that 
attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Harper, however, said that Bourassa was also recorded as saying, "My God, will 
I be in trouble for this?" 
</P>
<P>
"Who was Richard Bourassa concerned about? Christian Wiedepuhl or Richard 
Bourassa," Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
Hall discounted the remark as taken out of context and only reflected concern 
normal of "human nature." 
</P>
<P>
Bourassa is scheduled to be arraigned today in North Orange County Municipal 
Court.

ATTORNEYS QUESTION SURROGATE'S CREDIBILITY; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: SHE DENIES THAT SHE MISLED THE COUPLE AND INSISTED THAT SHE HAD THE 
RIGHT TO CHANGE HER MIND ABOUT GIVING UP THE BABY.

Surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson testified Monday that the infertile couple who 
hired her to bear their baby should not have trusted her to give up the child, 
but she denied that she misled or lied to them about her intent to keep the 
infant. 
</P>
<P>
Under four hours of intense questioning, Johnson repeatedly fended off 
accusations from the baby's lawyer that she is a liar. She insisted she had the 
right to change her mind and keep the child she agreed to bear for Mark and 
Crispina Calvert for $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 29, wrote a letter to the Calverts on July 23 demanding that they pay 
her the remaining $5,000 or they would "not get the baby." Questioned by the 
Calverts' lawyer, Christian R. Van Deusen, Johnson testified Monday that even 
if the couple had paid the money by the deadline she set, she would not have 
agreed to give up the child. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson denied Van Deusen's suggestion that she was lying by implicitly 
promising to surrender the child if the payment was made. She said she simply 
"changed my mind." 
</P>
<P>
"Are you saying the Calverts should have been more circumspect about believing 
what they heard coming from you?" Van Deusen asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess," Johnson answered. 
</P>
<P>
"Weren't you deceiving the Calverts into believing that if they complied with 
the letter, you'd turn over the child?" Van Deusen asked. 
</P>
<P>
"If they so chose to believe," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The proceeding in Orange County Superior Court marks the first time a surrogate 
mother has sought legal parental status even though she is not genetically 
related to the child she bore. The Calverts have temporary custody of the baby. 
Permanent custody will be decided later. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing has increasingly focused on Johnson's motives for changing her mind 
about giving up the child and deciding instead to seek custody of the baby boy, 
who was born Sept. 19. She claims she formed a deep bond with the child, but 
lawyers for the Calverts and for the infant question whether that is true. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Calvert testified briefly Monday, 
</P>
<P>
saying that Johnson repeatedly indicated that she would give up the child and 
that she was confident she would form no bond with the baby. 
</P>
<P>
"She represented throughout that she was an incubator and she was carrying our 
baby for us and had every intention of turning the baby over to us," Calvert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"She said that since she was not genetically related to the child, she'd have 
no bond to the child or want to keep it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Deusen also called as a witness Times reporter Catherine Gewertz, who 
interviewed Johnson in early August. Gewertz confirmed a published remark in 
which Johnson said she did not feel bonded to the baby because it was not made 
from her genetic material. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, under examination by Van Deusen, Johnson denied making that 
statement to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson attorney Richard C. Gilbert charged that Gewertz was biased against his 
client and had "grossly misrepresented" her statements, allegedly because 
Gewertz was not granted an exclusive story. Gilbert sought to have Gewertz's 
notes from the August interview introduced into evidence. But a lawyer for The 
Times objected, citing a state law that protects reporters from having to 
disclose unpublished information. Judge Richard N. Parslow did not make an 
immediate decision on the motion. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the sharpest questions about Johnson's credibility were raised Monday 
by the infant's court-appointed lawyer, Harold F. LaFlamme, who closely 
examined Johnson on dozens of points: 
</P>
<P>
* LaFlamme accused Johnson of withholding critical information from the 
Calverts -- such as her two previous stillbirths and two miscarriages -- so she 
could be certain they would use her as a surrogate. Johnson denied that. 
</P>
<P>
* LaFlamme charged that Johnson engaged in a "pattern of deceit," a "pattern of 
manipulation" and "lying to gain what she wanted." She denied those 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
* LaFlamme asked why she had loaned $900 to her roommate in April when she was 
demanding early payments from the Calverts because she allegedly needed money 
to pay medical bills. LaFlamme also asked why Johnson's attorney said on "The 
Donahue Show" on Sept. 6 that she had no money when she was receiving more than 
$1,200 a month in disability and child support, and why she said on the same 
program that she had not taken money from the Calverts when, in reality, she 
had cashed several of their checks. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said she "had the money" when she loaned it to her roommate. She said 
her disability and child support income "did not go far." And she said that she 
did not consider herself to have "taken money" by cashing the Calverts' checks 
because they were earmarked for pregnancy-related expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson testified that the Calverts made her feel abandoned by failing to visit 
her when she was hospitalized several times for complications, but she later 
admitted that on one occasion she did not tell them she had been hospitalized 
and that on another occasion the couple visited twice and brought her flowers 
and food and drove her home. 
</P>
<P>
LaFlamme also attacked Johnson's credibility by focusing on her medical 
complications. Johnson testified that one of her doctors suggested that she see 
a psychiatrist because there did not appear to be a physiological basis for her 
medical complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also testified that she believed when she signed the surrogation 
contract that she had the right to change her mind and that the contract was 
not enforceable.

LEISURE WORLD BACKS CANYON CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
More than 800 Leisure World residents have joined the campaign to keep the 
controversial Laguna Laurel housing development from being built, despite an 
earlier agreement that the retirement community would not officially oppose the 
project, community leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like it," said Dave Blodgett, president of Leisure 
World Residents to Save the Canyon, which has recruited 824 members for Laguna 
Canyon Conservancy since August. 
</P>
<P>
"There's never been such a spontaneous response that I've seen in Leisure 
World. To get this many people to write out a check in a specific time to an 
organization that is headquartered in Laguna Beach is absolutely 
unprecedented." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Leisure World residents have contributed almost $12,000 to the 
conservancy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. had planned to build Laguna Laurel, a 3,200-home project, along 
Laguna Canyon Road between El Toro Road and the San Diego Freeway. But on Oct. 
7, Laguna Beach reached an agreement with the developer to buy 2,150 acres of 
the canyon for $78 million. The deal is contingent on voters' approving a 
$20-million bond issue in the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the Irvine Co. gained a promise from the board of directors of the 
Golden Rain Foundation, Leisure World's governing body, not to oppose the 
Laguna Laurel project in exchange for a commitment to deal with the traffic and 
environmental concerns of residents, said Alex Gunster, the board president. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the 15 board members have joined hundreds of other residents as 
members of the Laguna Canyon Conservancy, which was formed to oppose the 
development, Gunster said. 
</P>
<P>
The board's agreement was an official decision, he said; individual decisions 
to join the conservancy were a matter of personal choice. 
</P>
<P>
"Even (Irvine Co. Chairman Donald) Bren himself is supporting this effort," 
Gunster said. "This changes all the time, so what you have to do is roll with 
the punches." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co. Vice President Carol Hoffman said the developer sought the board's 
agreement that it would not oppose the project in return for the company's 
commitment to address the concerns of residents. Company officials realized, 
however, that individuals might want to "take part in the public process," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Leisure World and the Willows Foundation, a smaller retirement 
community within Leisure World's gates, did indeed rally behind the city in its 
effort to stop the development, Blodgett said. 
</P>
<P>
A major reason for opposition within Leisure World was that the Laguna Laurel 
project would extend Santa Maria Avenue to Laguna Canyon Road, Blodgett said. 
Santa Maria Avenue now runs through Leisure World and dead ends into Moulton 
Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
The additional traffic would have been a safety hazard for the community of 
older residents, Blodgett said. The prospect "terrified Leisure Worlders," he 
said. LESLIE EARNEST

GROUND IS BROKEN FOR CHILD CARE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Groundbreaking ceremonies for Rancho Santiago College's new Child Development 
Center were held Monday at the college's Orange campus. 
</P>
<P>
The new center will provide child-care service to students attending the Orange 
campus, which is at the corner of Chapman and Newport avenues. 
</P>
<P>
The center will also serve as a laboratory site for students in the college's 
Human Development Program. 
</P>
<P>
Officials participating in the groundbreaking ceremony included Orange Mayor 
Don E. Smith, Orange Unified School District President Jeff Holstein and Rancho 
Santiago College District Board President Vernon S. Evans. 
</P>
<P>
"The center is the next important step in the continuing development of Rancho 
Santiago's Orange campus," Evans said. "This . . . will give more local 
residents, those with children, an opportunity to attend classes at the Orange 
campus." 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the new facility will begin later this month. It is scheduled 
to open next August.

Campaign spending in the county's least populous city promises to rank among 
the lowest, as none of the six City Council candidates have spent, or expect to 
spend, more than $1,000, according to mandatory campaign finance documents. 
</P>
<P>
Although Villa Park is an affluent bedroom community, when it comes to 
elections, "there's not much money here," said council candidate Robert 
Fauteaux, adding that he will probably not spend more than $600 on publicity 
and mailers. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Kaysene Miller said that low-cost and low-profile campaigns are the 
rule in Villa Park and that no candidate has spent more than $1,000 to win a 
seat in the 12 years she has worked for the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We get a few signs, and that's about it. It's word of mouth, and some of the 
candidates go door-to-door. (The campaigns) are just real low key and grass 
roots," she said. JON NALICK

'MISSING' WOMAN CONTACTS POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 20-year-old woman reported missing more than two weeks ago recently notified 
police that she is safe and living with a family in Los Angeles County, 
authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Tufa Petelo arrived at the Anaheim Police Station on Friday and told officers 
that she left home Sept. 26 after receiving a severe beating from the woman who 
reported her disappearance, Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
Petelo informed police of her whereabouts when she heard that they were 
conducting an extensive missing-person search but declined to press charges in 
the alleged beating, Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have confirmed that she was beaten severely on Sept. 25 or 26 by the same 
person who reported her missing," Hedgpeth said. "This caused (Petelo) to run 
away. In her mind, she left for her own safety." 
</P>
<P>
Futatia Tausili, 48, the Anaheim woman who reported Petelo missing, originally 
told police that she is Petelo's aunt. Police have since confirmed that the two 
women are not related. Tausili could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A police investigation revealed that Tausili was named two years ago in a 
felony assault case involving Petelo in a neighboring city, Hedgpeth said. He 
would not name the city or provide further details on that incident. 
</P>
<P>
Petelo, who police said is mentally disabled, was apparently sent by her 
parents in Samoa to live with Tausili. WENDY PAULSON

COSTA MESA HIGH GETS A ROYAL VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY MARCANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the students at Costa Mesa High School heard that they would be visited by 
British royalty, many envisioned a snooty couple sweeping onto the campus in a 
fleet of gleaming horse-drawn carriages, looking down upon and waving politely 
to the little people. 
</P>
<P>
Although Princess Alexandra of Britain and her husband, Sir Angus Ogilvy, did 
arrive at the school Monday in a fleet of gleaming Rolls-Royces, the students 
pronounced them anything but snooty. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they were going to be all high and stuck-up, but they were nice," 
said ninth-grader Mike Curtis, 14. 
</P>
<P>
The royal couple, visiting Orange County as part of the Festival of Britain, 
ventured to Costa Mesa High after Princess Alexandra, 53, first cousin of Queen 
Elizabeth II, asked for a tour of a typical California high school. 
</P>
<P>
Students and faculty perched along a second-floor railing gazed down as the 
princess and her entourage arrived shortly after 11 a.m. to cheers ordinarily 
associated with the arrival of a pop musician or star athlete. 
</P>
<P>
While the princess and her husband took a brief tour of the school, teacher 
Phyllis McKown and her ninth-grade world history class nervously prepared for a 
skit in which nine of her 34 students presented an Elizabethan-era "telecast" 
of the "Renaissance News Network," focusing on battles with the Spanish Armada. 
</P>
<P>
The princess, with her entourage in tow, was led into Room 163, where McKown 
introduced her students to the couple and presented the princess with another 
bouquet of flowers. "Do you enjoy history?" the princess asked the class, which 
replied "yes" in unison but with an obvious degree of apprehension. 
</P>
<P>
Seated in standard-issue plastic classroom chairs, Princess Alexandra and Sir 
Angus looked on as "anchorwoman" Tienna Rodriguez, 14, dressed in a bright 
green blazer, opened the "broadcast" and introduced "correspondent" Michelle 
Hitchcock, who, in turn, introduced "Queen Elizabeth I." 
</P>
<P>
The queen, portrayed by Julie Wooten, 14, resplendent in a floor-length white 
gown and tiara, delivered a soft-spoken but flawless address detailing the 
fight against the Armada. Her address was rebutted in Spanish by King Philip I 
of Spain, portrayed by Robert Rodriguez, 14, and translated by Dawn Fries, 14. 
</P>
<P>
McKown later said it was the students' idea to deliver speeches for the 
"newscast" in as many foreign languages as possible. After Robert Rodriguez -- 
who brought smiles to the faces of the royal couple after he proclaimed that 
"it is true that I had fallen in love with Queen Elizabeth, but we're bitter 
enemies now" -- delivered his address in Spanish, classmate Giancarlo Renella, 
14, portraying Pope Alexander, did his bit in Italian. Nancy Duigou, 15, 
presented France's perspective in French. 
</P>
<P>
"Congratulations -- well done!" Sir Angus told the performers. "Very 
enjoyable." 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of nervous," said Chad Van Sweden, 14, who interviewed "Pope 
Alexander" for the mock broadcast. "It was just a different feeling having 
reporters and royalty in the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
"They were fabulous," said Nancy Duigou, who said she was pleased to learn that 
the princess speaks some French and was able to follow her presentation. "She 
was really nice, not like I expected." 
</P>
<P>
The entire school, it seemed, was similarly impressed by the royal couple. At 
their departure -- marked by a one-song recital by the school choir -- the 
princess stopped to shake a few hands and exchange pleasantries with a number 
of students. 
</P>
<P>
"Omigod, I talked to her!" one girl yelled after the princess stopped to say 
hello. "I talked to a princess!" TONY MARCANO

VANDALISM AT YMCA ESTIMATED AT $10,000 
</P>

<P>
Vandals broke into the Fullerton YMCA last weekend, smashing windows and 
causing an estimated $10,000 in damage, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident at 2000 Youth Way occurred either late Saturday night or early 
Sunday morning, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Vandals used rocks and heavy flower planters to smash windows at the building 
and of vans used to pick up children for the Y's day-care program. YMCA sweat 
shirts and food were reported stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Police said investigators are treating the incident as a burglary and would not 
say whether it was gang-related. The building is closed on the weekend and is 
generally used by seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a total mess," said Tony Shuman, executive director of North County 
YMCA. "There was so much broken glass that we had to hire a carpet cleaner to 
get it all out." Shuman said coffee packets were also opened and scattered all 
over the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Shuman said the YMCA alerted police a month ago about a group of youngsters 
that gathers near the facility at night on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
"We were getting a little concerned because when we opened on Monday, we would 
find broken beer bottles in the parking lot," Shuman said, adding that the 
police had even sent out a patrol car on Friday nights but found nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Shuman said the vandalism will force the YMCA to keep a worker on duty during 
weekend nights, and that will burden an already-strained budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't understand why people do things like this," Shuman said. "This 
center is for everyone. It doesn't make any sense." ERIK HAMILTON

SANTA ANA OKS ORDINANCE TO LIMIT GARAGE SALES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council approved an ordinance Monday night that would limit households 
to two garage sales a year. 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous vote, the council agreed to regulate garage sales in the city 
and drop a 1960 law, which had previously prohibited all types of sales from 
residential households. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the 1960 law, City Manager David N. Ream said, garage sales have 
thrived in Santa Ana. City officials say garage sales have gone slightly awry 
in neighborhoods where some residents have been illegally using their garages 
as retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Merchandise -- some of which is stolen or was just recently purchased from 
local thrift and outlet stores -- have been sold for profits in these 
garage-type businesses, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The new law prohibits these businesses from operating, Ream said. And the 
ordinance would also mandate that only household items can be sold. 
</P>
<P>
In a staff report to the City Council, Planning Department staff member Steve 
Crawford describes garage sales as being "part of the American experience." 
</P>
<P>
The report says that garage sales have positive benefits for Santa Ana, 
including giving residents a chance to "spring clean" and help the environment 
at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"From an environmental standpoint, a garage sale provides the vehicle wherein 
the life of durable goods is extended, rather than the goods being relegated to 
a landfill," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
The new law will limit the hours of a garage sale from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and to 
no more than three consecutive days. Households also cannot conduct the sales 
onpublic sidewalks, parkways, or alleys. And displays for the garage sales 
cannot be posted on telephone poles, street lights or traffic signs. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, a Moorpark city ordinance limits garage and home boutique 
sales to three a year and prohibits residents' displaying sale items on front 
lawns. Moorpark adopted the ordinance after residents complained that signs to 
advertise home boutique sales littered lawns during the holiday season.

DIPLOMACY: FORMER PRIME MINISTER EDWARD HEATH TELLS THE WORLD AFFAIRS COUNCIL 
THAT COUNTRIES MUST POOL THEIR SOVEREIGNTY. HE PLANS A MISSION TO MIDDLE EAST.

<P>
Former British Prime Minister Edward Heath said Monday that a united Europe was 
"logical and inevitable . . . the only question is when are we going to be wise 
enough to do it?" 
</P>
<P>
Heath, who served as prime minister of Great Britain from 1970 to 1974, spoke 
to a gathering of the World Affairs Council of Orange County at the Richard 
Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to today's world events, Heath said: "There are distractions in 
China, Africa and the Middle East. . . . The main changes are taking place in 
the ancient continent of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Heath, 74, told reporters that he would meet with Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein when he makes a humanitarian visit to the Middle East later this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to elaborate on the Middle East crisis beyond saying that he would 
hope to free the "suffering and dying" British citizens who are being held 
hostage. 
</P>
<P>
The British member of Parliament devoted the major portion of his address to 
the prospects of a united Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Heath said European countries must pool their sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
"Sovereignty is not something you take to the cellar and once a week you go 
there with a candle to see if it's still there," Heath said. "It is there to be 
used for the benefit of the people. Europe will never again be a continent of 
little states fighting each other. It will be governed by supranationality." 
</P>

Heath was taken on a brief tour of the Nixon Library. He described the facility 
as "impressive," saying, "You know how to treat your presidents." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from being an inveterate world traveler, Heath is also a champion 
deep-water sailor, author and an internationally active conductor. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Heath pursued his musical interests when he visited the 
Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove. After meeting with the Rev. Robert Schuller, 
Heath played the church's organ for about 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
His small delegation stood at attention when he broke into "God Save the 
Queen." 
</P>
<P>
Heath promised to take up Schuller's offer to return next year and conduct a 
concert with the Pacific Symphony, the Pacific Chorale and the Crystal 
Cathedral Choir. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving the Crystal Cathedral, Heath headed for Newport Beach, where he 
met several Orange County yachtsmen , against whom he had competed in 
international sailing events.

The bad news for Steve Giguere of Garden Grove at 5:35 p.m. Monday was 
something he was used to. The bus he was waiting to catch on Harbor Boulevard 
at McFadden Avenue was full. He would have to wait for the next one. 
</P>
<P>
But the good news was that he only had to wait 15 minutes. In the past, he 
would have waited 20 minutes to half an hour, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Great," said Giguere when told of the Orange County Transit District's recent 
decision to increase bus service. "Sounds like somebody had a good idea for a 
change." 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, it was about 15 minutes after the first bus that Giguere caught 
the next one, which had plenty of seats. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to rider complaints about slow service during peak hours, OCTD last 
week started a new program -- called Frequent Service Transit Routes -- aimed 
at guaranteeing a bus every 15 minutes during weekday peak hours along seven 
major routes. 
</P>
<P>
The peak hours are from 6 to 9 a.m. and from 3 to 6 p.m. The major routes are: 
</P>
<P>
* Line 43, Fullerton to Newport Beach via Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
* Line 53, Orange to Balboa, via Main and Baker streets and Orange Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
* Line 57, Santa Ana to Laguna Hills, via Bristol Street. 
</P>
<P>
* Line 60, Tustin to Long Beach, via 17th Street and Westminster Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
* Line 64, Santa Ana to Seal Beach, via 1st Street and Bolsa Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
* Line 70, Santa Ana to Sunset Beach, via Edinger Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
* Line 85, Santa Ana to Laguna Hills, via Santa Ana Boulevard, Red Hill Avenue 
and Crown Valley Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
Some sections of these routes have always had buses every 15 minutes; a few 
places in the county have buses every six to 12 minutes. But some waiting 
periods on even the major lines had been up to as much as half an hour in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
"One complaint we occasionally hear is that our buses don't run frequently 
enough, and people can't rely on them to get to work or to school on time," 
said OCTD General Manager James P. Reichert. "This program will answer that. . 
. . It's getting really busy out there." 
</P>
<P>
The only way to get more buses on major lines -- without raising the standard 
90-cent fare -- is to get the buses from somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Joanne Curran, OCTD spokeswoman, said it took some readjusting. 
</P>
<P>
"On some of the less frequently used routes, we've had to increase the waiting 
period from 20 minutes to half an hour," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But officials only did that on lines on which the rider traffic was slow 
anyway, she said. 
</P>
<P>
People standing at bus stops along Harbor Boulevard Monday evening applauded 
OCTD's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"When you do all your traveling by bus, that's a considerable improvement," 
said Lanier White, waiting on the southbound bus at La Palma Avenue with his 
girlfriend and their 2-year-old daughter. They had been at the welfare office 
in Fullerton picking up a check and would transfer buses at Harbor Boulevard 
and Lincoln Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
White, 27, said he noticed immediately the quicker bus service along Harbor 
when it began last week but did not realize it was because of a specific change 
in schedules. 
</P>
<P>
"When you travel every day on the bus, you get so those timetables are 
implanted in your mind," he said. "I knew something was going on. I didn't know 
what it was; I was just happy how soon that bus seemed to be showing up." 
</P>
<P>
Another appreciative rider was Debbie Deardorf, 35, a teacher at a day school, 
who said taking the bus makes it difficult to always get to work on time. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you can catch a bus every 15 minutes, you really don't have a reason to 
be late," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For a few, however, the only thing that matters is when a bus, any bus, finally 
does show up. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie and Donnie Crain, a homeless pair traveling cross-country from Florida, 
were waiting at a southbound bus stop at North Street along Harbor Boulevard in 
Anaheim Monday evening. They had no place to spend the night. They were hoping 
the bus driver could tell them how to get to Long Beach. They'd heard someone 
there might help them. 
</P>
<P>
"Faster bus service? Sounds good; I'm all for it," Donnie Crain said. "Always 
good to know someone cares about people who have to ride the bus."

<P>
A Westminster man was arrested Monday on suspicion of shooting a woman in the 
face after an argument over a business deal, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, identified as Tam Odom, 47, of Ventura, was reported in stable 
condition at Westminster Hospital after being shot with a .22-caliber pistol, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Jermain Patchen, 23, surrendered to police after the 4:25 p.m. shooting 
and police said that he was being held in County Jail on suspicion of attempted 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
Patchen and Odom apparently had an argument earlier in the day over an 
undisclosed business deal at a house in the 14700 block of Alcester Street, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Patchen left the house and returned later in the afternoon. During another 
argument, officers said, Odom was shot in the face.

APARTMENT-DWELLERS IN ANAHEIM WATCH GAMES FROM THEIR WINDOWS

<P>
It's 6:30 on a Thursday night, and Western High School's Handel Stadium is 
slowly coming alive. Cheerleaders giggle and chatter. A marching band honks, 
booms and toots. Coaches bark last-minute instructions. The smell of hot, 
buttered popcorn wafts through the air. 
</P>
<P>
Although the game won't start for another hour, high school football fan Jim 
Hughes is already hyped, scouting the action from his favorite vantage point: 
</P>
<P>
His bedroom window. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, a 1984 graduate of Western High, lives with his wife in a small, 
one-bedroom unit of Westchester Square Apartments, a 424-unit complex bordered 
on one side by Handel Stadium's football field. 
</P>
<P>
From their bedroom, parallel to the west end zone, Hughes could almost fall out 
of his window and find himself in a goal-line stand. 
</P>
<P>
For some, living a pompon's throw away from a high school football stadium 
equals a headache of Super Bowl proportions. The crowds, the lights, the loud 
bursts from the band. . . . At Handel Stadium, home field to not one but four 
high school teams, game night comes two, sometimes even three nights a week. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester Square manager Jollene Dillanwater says prospective tenants are not 
forewarned about the possible noise from the stadium. She said most just make 
do. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, if you can't watch the game (from your window), you go to the game, 
because you can't sleep," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Others think it's terrific. Heck, for $525 a month, you're not only getting a 
place to live, you're getting a stadium luxury box. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first decided to get married, I said, OK, but only if we get an 
apartment up here so I can watch the games," said Hughes, a 25-year-old driver 
for an Anaheim courier service. 
</P>
<P>
To this, Dolores Hughes rolls her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim, we rented the apartment, not the football field," she said dryly. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes doesn't hear her. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really neat," he said excitedly. "You can see everything. You can hear 
everything. When they score a touchdown, it's so great, all the cheerleaders 
run down jumping for joy, the band plays louder, people are screaming, the 
announcers yelling, everyone's going nuts . . . I mean, it's really intense." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, who on game nights stocks the apartment with pizza and diet soda and 
invites over friends, points to his white cat, Snowball, sitting on a 
custom-made blue furry window perch designed so she, too, can watch the action 
below. 
</P>
<P>
"See, even Snowball gets into it," Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time, in fact, when even Western football Coach Jim Howell enjoyed 
the view. After he and his wife married in 1965, they rented a first-floor 
apartment in the complex and watched the games over their fence. Howell, then a 
junior high football coach, had yet to coach a high school game. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not everyone at Westchester Square is so captivated by the football 
games. For instance . . . 
</P>
<P>
In Apartment 21, an upstairs corner unit, John and Susan Harris can see and 
hear the goings-on, but they'd rather not. John, a 32-year-old production 
manager for a Fullerton electronics firm, is a jazz saxophonist who played in 
the marching band while at El Rancho High in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"As a musician, hearing the bands makes me reminisce," John said. "But it also 
makes me remember, as a purist musician, how much I hated marching band. Fight 
songs are so boring to me." 
</P>
<P>
True, the theme song from "Bonanza" can wear on you after a while. 
</P>
<P>
In Apartment 18, Terry Hansen, a 36-year-old mechanic, has one of the better 
views of the field, but it's hard for him to watch because he's on crutches. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen broke his left leg a few weeks ago playing croquet. Now, while the bands 
play on, Hansen plays Nintendo. 
</P>
<P>
Apartment 15 is the home of Laura Espinoza, mother of Anthony Espinoza, 2 1/2. 
Anthony loves football, his mother doesn't. Still, she supplies him with a 
large spoon and a frying pan so he can play along with the Western band. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony likes the football even better. 
</P>
<P>
"He's hung out that window to watch them play ever since he was 1 1/2 years 
old," Laura Espinoza said. "He'd rather watch that football than cartoons." 
</P>
<P>
Said Anthony: "Football! Football! . . . Ka-poom! Ka-poooom!" 
</P>
<P>
Apartment 14 is the home of South Korean natives Tea and Mija Yun. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband likes to watch," Mija said. "I'll watch, but only if I'm bored." 
</P>
<P>
Downstairs, in Apartment 3, Judy Fox and her 16-year-old daughter, Anitra, live 
in the shadow of the bleachers where you can hear teen-agers chat all sorts of 
chit-chat. The Foxes don't mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it," Judy said. "The only thing I don't like is when they clean the 
stands at 11:30 at night and make a bunch of noise. That drives me nuts." 
</P>
<P>
The close proximity of their apartment is a big help, though. Anitra is a 
member of Western's color guard, and Judy is the team mom. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever someone's uniform rips or a button pops off, all we have to do is 
rush over and have my mom sew it," Anitra said. 
</P>
<P>
Next door, Vera Judge, one of many senior citizens in the complex, said the 
noise doesn't bother her too much as long as she keeps herself busy. During a 
Magnolia-Western game last Thursday, she and two friends played pinochle. 
</P>
<P>
In the adjacent building, 70-year-old Roger Anderson has a good view of the 
field from Apartment 7, but he hasn't been watching the football games lately. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"Because Western hasn't been doing a diddly-damn," he said.

BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: JASON MINICI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
School: Irvine High 
</P>
<P>
Sport: Football 
</P>
<P>
Position: Quarterback 
</P>
<P>
Class: Junior 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Coach Terry Henigan has decided that in order to win in the South Coast 
League, the Vaqueros must pass effectively. Judging from the school records 
Minici is setting, Henigan has found the right player for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Minici, who started at quarterback last year as a sophomore at Adlai Stevenson 
High School in suburban Chicago, had 18 completions to set a school single-game 
record in his first game for Irvine this season. Friday, he completed 14 of 25 
passes for 304 yards -- another school single-game record -- passed for two 
touchdowns and ran for another in Irvine's 26-14 South Coast League victory 
over Dana Hills. Minici, who also helped receiver Mark Huffman set the school 
record for reception yards (201) in the game, transferred to Irvine last spring 
and was the starting catcher for the baseball team. Henigan says Minici has 
been helped by competition at quarterback from sophomore Aron Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other top performers: 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Ioja, who caught two touchdown passes, recovered a fumble and returned 
it 35 yards for another touchdown and kicked five extra points to lead Garden 
Grove to a 35-7 victory over Los Amigos Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Jessie, who caught four passes for 159 yards and two touchdowns in 
Edison's 21-10 victory over Santa Ana Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Niednagel, a Dana Hills cross-country runner who had the fastest time of 
the day -- 15 minutes 17 seconds for three miles -- to win the invitational 
race of the Orange Country Championships Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Windle, who completed 16 of 18 passes for 255 yards and two touchdowns and 
also scored two touchdowns on a couple of one-yard runs in Troy's 28-7 victory 
over Sonora Friday.

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: CRISTIN ROSSMAN 
</P>

<P>
School: Marina High 
</P>
<P>
Sport: Volleyball 
</P>
<P>
Position: Middle blocker 
</P>
<P>
Class: Senior 
</P>
<P>
There have been few times this season that Marina's volleyball team needed 
points worse than it did in the fifth game of its match against Fountain Valley 
last week -- and when Marina needs points, Rossman is usually there. Trailing, 
14-10, a point away from dropping into second place in the Sunset League, the 
Vikings set it to Rossman on nearly every point despite the fact that she often 
had three defenders marking her. Rossman, who missed much of her junior season 
because of a couple of ankle injuries, had 10 of her match-high 32 kills in 
that final game, which Marina won, 16-14. Rossman, whose sister Tricia is one 
of three sophomore starters on the team, leads the Vikings with 91 kills for 
the season. Rossman is at her best against Marina's toughest competition and 
that has allowed the Vikings (9-2, 7-0 in the league) to rise to No. 6 in the 
Orange County rankings. "She's not the highest jumper," Coach Dennis Creighton 
said. "She's not the quickest kid but she's determined and she hits the ball 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other top performers: 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Berkowitz, who won all nine of her singles sets to help Fountain 
Valley win two of its three tennis matches last week, is undefeated in the 
Sunset League and 35-4 overall this season. 
</P>
<P>
Missy Clements, who had 28 kills in La Habra's five-game volleyball victory 
over Sunny Hills Tuesday. Clements also helped La Habra, the No. 1 ranked team 
in the state, defeat Sonora Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Kay Negota, a Woodbridge runner who finished in 17 minutes 49 seconds to win 
the invitational race of the Orange County Cross-Country Championships 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Pinto, who ran the fastest girls' time of the day, 17:26 for three 
miles, to win her fourth title at the Orange County Cross-Country Championships 
Saturday.

CARL'S JR. HOPES ITS STAR WILL RISE IN MEXICAN MARKET 
</P>

<P>
The Happy Star is about to become La Estrella Feliz. 
</P>
<P>
 The translation is expected to become be official today as Carl Karcher 
Enterprises Inc. signs a licensing agreement that will result in the opening of 
at least 10 Carl's Jr. restaurants -- with the signature yellow shooting star 
-- over the next five years in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement with Valores Metalicos, a company based in Monterrey, marks 
Karcher's first move south of the border and third international venture. The 
company, confronting an increasingly saturated U.S. fast-food market, has 
opened units through a licensee in Japan and signed an agreement for outlets 
throughout the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexico is definitely a goal. It was one of our targets," said Carl's 
spokeswoman Patty Parks. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican restaurants will probably be developed in the Monterrey area, in 
the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon about 100 miles south of Laredo, Tex. The 
agreement also gives Valores Metalicos the option of expanding into the states 
of Tamaulipas, just south of Brownsville on the Gulf coast, and Coahuila, 
northeast of Monterrey, also along the Texas border. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, what we are seeing with our entry into Monterrey is the beginning 
of a commitment to expand further to Mexico City and other parts of the 
country," Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
She said that Valores Metalicos is a diversified company, whose operations 
include the air taxi, travel agency and automobile dealership businesses. The 
firm will open a food division to handle the new Carl's Jr. restaurants. Parks 
said the Mexican company has the same entrepreneurial spirit as the Carl's 
chain, which started when founder Carl Karcher started hawking hot dogs from a 
cart on the streets of Los Angeles in the early 1940s. "This company is an 
excellent fit," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of the 557 Carl's Jr. restaurants are company owned, but 
Karcher has looked to licensees to run its international operations. Under the 
arrangement, the foreign companies usually provide the building and royalties 
in exchange for the Carl's Jr. name, products, know-how and marketing 
expertise. 
</P>
<P>
Carl's Jr. has made no secret of its international intentions but until now has 
chosen the Pacific Rim for most of its new growth. Its Japanese partner has 
already opened three stores and plans to build seven more. 
</P>
<P>
And MBF of Kuala Lumpur has a license to develop Carl's Jr. units in Malaysia. 
That company is also studying the possibilities for Carl's Jr. in Singapore, 
Australia and Hong Kong. Eventually, MBF hopes to open Carl's Jr. outlets in 
Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
One stock brokerage analyst said the latest deal with the Mexican franchisee 
appears to be a smart move. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the concept is OK," said Doug Christopher of Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co. 
"In general, American food does pretty well down there." 
</P>
<P>
The move beyond U.S. borders comes at a time that the company has been 
struggling due to increasing competition and discounting in the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the company's net earnings dipped after it took a $14.5-million 
charge related to losses and restructuring of its Arizona operations. The 
company reported earnings of $5.6 million in the year ended Jan. 29, contrasted 
with net income of $20.5 million the year before. 
</P>

I-Flow Corp. said Monday that it has received federal permission to market its 
first line of high-tech home infusion medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Donald M. Earhart, the company's chief executive officer, said the device is 
lightweight and computerized, enabling a patient to receive up to four 
infusions of drugs or nutrients either one at a time or simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the product we will finally go to market with," said Earhart, adding 
that the potential market for the device is greater than $500 million a year in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, he said, patients who need chemotherapy or other treatments with 
more than one drug or a combination of drugs and nutrients are using several 
single-channel pumps or cumbersome hospital systems. By contrast, Earhart said, 
patients can use the I-Flow equipment in their homes or take it with them to 
work or on a trip, carrying it in small bags. 
</P>
<P>
Earhart said I-Flow is trying to raise additional funds from private investors 
to cover anticipated production costs.

MANAGEMENT: THE FAST-FOOD COMPANY HOPES TO REDUCE EMPLOYEE TURNOVER BY OFFERING 
TO PAY UP TO $405 A TERM FOR HIGHER EDUCATION.

<P>
At 23, Andrew J. Maldonado manages a nearly $1-million operation and a crew of 
more than 30 employees at the Carl's Jr. restaurant in the Mall of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The demands of management require long hours and many skills -- fix-it man, 
recruiter, bookkeeper and chef. It has left Maldonado little time to earn a 
college degree in business -- an achievement that he feels is necessary for 
future advancement. 
</P>
<P>
But this semester, aided by an innovative program offered to all Carl's Jr. 
employees, Maldonado has resumed earning credits toward his degree. He is 
taking a class at a nearby community college, and the bill is being paid by his 
employer. 
</P>
<P>
Maldonado is participating in an educational program offered by the chain's 
parent company to reduced employee turnover. Anaheim-based Carl Karcher 
Enterprises Inc. is paying up to $405 a term for some employees' tuition, 
transportation and books. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the right thing to do," said John A. Kubas, Carl's vice president for 
human resources. "It's reflective of Carl's philosophy that we have an 
obligation to return something to the community." 
</P>
<P>
Strictly from a business standpoint, it also is reflective of Carl's desire to 
return something to its kitchens -- namely workers. 
</P>
<P>
That has not always been easy for Carl's Jr. The chain's work force has an 
average annual turnover rate of 160%, Kubas said. That means Carl's Jr. must 
fill each position three times within a two-year period. Such churning takes a 
large toll on the company in expenditures for recruitment, training and other 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
Carl's Jr. is not alone. Kubas said other fast-food chains have even higher 
turnover rates. The industry as a whole averages yearly turnover of 225% to 
250%, Kubas said, meaning that each position must be filled more than twice a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that many young people no longer look at flipping hamburgers as a 
good part-time job while in high school or college or as a good entry-level 
job. They are turned off by minimum wages, low prestige and poor working 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The fast-food industry, aware that declining birth rates in the 1970s have 
shrunk its historic labor pool of young people, has sought out senior citizens 
and other groups to try to fill the uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Carl's Jr.'s education program, which has attracted industrywide attention, 
represents a new tack -- albeit an expensive one -- to try to retain more of 
its young work force and attract new recruits. 
</P>
<P>
Though still an experiment, the program has paid the costs of a semester's 
worth of schooling for 96 Carl's Jr. workers, or their immediate family 
members, since it began in August, 1989. Only about 10% of the chain's 557 
restaurants are participating so far. 
</P>
<P>
Both full- and part-time workers can use the benefits to attend college, go to 
trade school, or take English, Spanish or other language classes. The program 
is available to employees who have worked at least one month at a participating 
Carl's Jr. outlet. 
</P>
<P>
Benefits are based on the number of hours an employee works a week. The maximum 
benefit of $350 toward tuition, $30 for books and $25 to cover transportation 
costs goes to employees working 26 hours a week or more. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Newman, 20, said he is using the Carl's Jr. program for his first 
semester at Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson. "It makes ends meet, believe 
me," Newman added. 
</P>
<P>
He said that word of the program has spread at the Carl's Jr. where he works 
near the university. Some workers transferred to the restaurant from other 
Carl's Jr. sites in order to take advantage of the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Maldonado, who hopes to earn a degree in business administration, has attended 
Fullerton College and Cal State Fullerton in the past to study computers. This 
semester, he enrolled in an elective photography class at Cypress College, with 
Carl's picking up the tuition tab. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he has tried to promote the educational benefit program among 
members of his restaurant crew but that, so far, few have enrolled. He said 
many of the employees are Latino, supporting themselves or families on the 
money they earn at Carl's, and have only sixth- or eighth-grade educations and 
no immediate desire for more schooling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really hard to get them motivated to use it," Maldonado said, adding that 
many Latinos are unaccustomed to receiving job benefits. "Some are afraid of 
it. They don't really trust it." 
</P>
<P>
Kubas said that 43% of Carl's work force is Latino, and many of them are recent 
immigrants. He said that he hopes, over time, to attract more Latinos to the 
education program. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sal D. Rinella, vice president for administration at Cal State Fullerton, 
said that the challenge will be to show Latinos that the program is available 
and that education will help them work their way into the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what it will do is develop the worker so that the company gets better 
performance and so that the worker can (eventually) move on to other things," 
Rinella said. "Turnover goes down. Morale is sustained very high." 
</P>
<P>
Rinella has worked extensively with Robert J. Kopecky, a consultant based in 
Troy, Mich., who helped formulate both the Carl's Jr. plan and a similar 
program in two Detroit-area Burger King franchises. Kubas said it was an 
article in a trade magazine on the Burger King experiment that first drew him 
to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
In Detroit, Kopecky said he experimented with various programs to try to cut 
Burger King's turnover rate of 179%. The restaurants initially tried 
cash-incentive programs, improving the look and comfort of uniforms, making 
schedules more flexible and enticing managers to extend better treatment to 
workers. Though the changes were appreciated by employees, none stemmed the 
high dropout rate. 
</P>
<P>
Then the two Burger Kings set up the program to pay for tuition and books. It 
appeared to strike an immediate chord with workers. "They all wanted to get an 
education somewhere, because they didn't necessarily want to flip hamburgers 
the rest of their lives," Kopecky said. 
</P>
<P>
President of the Excellence Group Inc., Kopecky said that absenteeism dropped, 
productivity increased by 3% and employees stayed on the job longer. "For some 
reason, the workers began to feel the company was really behind them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the tuition costs are high compared to the workers' relatively low 
hourly wages, they are less than the estimated turnover cost of $600 for each 
new worker. Turnover costs include the value of management time to advertise an 
opening, scout for and interview applicants, and provide a uniform and 
training. 
</P>
<P>
Rinella, who studied the Detroit experiment, said that the educational program 
appears to have a staying power that other kinds of incentives lack. With the 
program, he said, a fast-food job "is not a dead-end anymore. It also changes 
the image of fast foods as companies that take in great numbers of people (as 
employees) and don't care very much about them."

<P>
Parker Automotive Corp. said Monday that it raised $3.4 million in a private 
offering to institutional investors that closed Oct. 9 -- bringing the total 
raised in a two-part offering that began in late August to $5.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which has reported signing numerous exclusive distributorship 
deals in the past year, said that it initially planned to raise only $2 million 
through the offerings but that demand for the unregistered common stock was 
much greater than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Cruttenden &amp; Co. of Newport Beach acted as adviser in both offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials declined to identify any of the investors who bought stock in 
the two offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Parker Automotive manufactures and markets a cleaning system for internal 
combustion engine fuel systems. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Parker, chairman and chief executive, said proceeds will be used to 
finance continued expansion of the company.

Parker Automotive Corp.: The Costa Mesa manufacturer of engine cleaning 
products reported second-quarter earnings of $205,800, contrasted with a loss 
of $48,000 for the comparable quarter in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the quarter ended Aug. 31 more than doubled to $3.6 million from 
$1.3 million. For the six-month period, earnings totaled $1.5 million, 
contrasted with a loss of $833,300 for the year-earlier period. Revenue rose to 
$7.7 million from $1.6 million. The company said earnings in the second quarter 
were adversely affected by postponement of a shipment to Saudi Arabia due to 
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The Saudi shipment will be reflected in the 
company's third quarter results.

FLAVORISTS' WORK DRAWN FROM PALETTE OF CHEMICALS; 
</P>
<P>
FOOD: THE SECRETIVE BUSINESS STRIVES TO ADD WHAT PROCESSING TAKES OUT, 
GENERATING A $750-MILLION-A-YEAR INDUSTRY IN THE PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

CINCINNATI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From high-tech chicken pot pies to powdered soft drinks, a super-secret world 
is at work on much of our food. 
</P>
<P>
The flavor industry replaces the savor we destroy, making a TV dinner taste 
less like cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
"In processing food to get it into the form people want or to make it safe, 
flavor is processed out," said Bob Pellegrino, general manager at 
Cincinnati-based Fries &amp; Fries, one of the nation's largest flavor 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
Grandma went to her garden or market for fresh produce hours before preparing 
and serving it. But we expect food that waits months in warehouses and on store 
shelves to be popped into a microwave oven and still taste as good as 
grandma's. 
</P>
<P>
To a surprising degree, it does, thanks to flavorists who have created an 
estimated $750-million-a-year industry that helps make the food we eat 
palatable. 
</P>
<P>
Flavorists usually are chemists who have spent several years learning to 
identify and duplicate natural flavors. Many say they can discern thousands of 
flavors -- nuances such as the difference between the part of an apple near the 
skin and the part near the core. 
</P>
<P>
The flavorist's challenge is to restore natural flavors, no matter what 
processing, packaging, storing and cooking have done to them. 
</P>
<P>
America's changing lifestyle means that food processors have to compensate for 
flavor that used to be provided by animal fats, cream and other 
high-cholesterol foods that don't fit into diet-conscious lives. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a few words that are driving our industry -- light or low-fat, 
natural and convenient," Pellegrino said. 
</P>
<P>
Flavoring agents are pervasive. Dairy products, bakery goods, desserts and 
beverages are laced with flavorings. 
</P>
<P>
Because ingredients are listed in descending order by weight, flavoring is last 
because it comprises less than one-half of 1% of the weight of the product -- 
sometimes just a few parts per million. 
</P>
<P>
"That means 100 pounds of flavoring makes more than 20,000 pounds of product," 
Pellegrino said. Liquid flavoring rolls out of his plant in 55-gallon drums and 
powders in 10,000-pound lots. 
</P>
<P>
The flavor-making industry is secretive and clannish, Pellegrino conceded. A 
food company that markets its brand has a proprietary interest in the way its 
pot pie, pudding or potato chip tastes and doesn't want anybody else to produce 
that flavor. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a high level of trust between the flavor company and the food and 
beverage company," Pellegrino explained. "Service and confidentiality are 
important. We'd be out of business pretty quickly if we said we were flavoring 
this or flavoring that." 
</P>
<P>
He refuses to identify any brand that uses his products. But he says Fries 
&amp; Fries and a competitor, International Flavors and Fragrances Inc., are 
among the nation's largest, each handling about 10% of the industry's business. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 100 flavor companies in the United States, and about 80 of them 
belong to the Washington, D.C.-based Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Assn., 
according to Earl Klinger, the group's administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The association refuses to acknowledge any ranking among the industry's 
companies or the volume of the business. 
</P>
<P>
"We really do not know for certain," Klinger said. "It's not legally possible 
to patent, copyright or otherwise protect a formula for a flavor, so the only 
way one company can maintain a competitive advantage is to keep it a secret. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard all sorts of figures, and we really have no way of knowing." 
</P>
<P>
Flavorists like to say that they can reproduce a flavor from taste the way some 
musicians play songs by ear. They usually start by analyzing the chemical 
content of a food by using a gas chromatograph and listing the ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
Then they recreate flavors in the laboratory, altering them by, for example, by 
making a fruit drink taste riper, sweeter or more tart. 
</P>
<P>
There might be 500 components in any flavor, and it is the distinctive 
formulation of those components that makes one brand of soft drink taste 
different from another.

DARING ARTISTS INVEST THEIR TALENTS IN GOLD AND SILVER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Peer at the colorful wonders inside the Zia Jewelry Co., and one knows what 
owner Ron Cohan means when he calls this "daring jewelry." 
</P>
<P>
Here one finds gold rings and pendants by Raoul Sosa inlaid with startling 
combinations of fiery opals, blue lapis, turquoise and purple sugalite. 
</P>
<P>
"When people walk up to the case, their mouths drop open," says Cohan, owner of 
Zia Jewelry Co. in San Juan Capistrano. "They've never seen gems in these 
combinations." 
</P>
<P>
While people on the East Coast might favor traditional diamond solitaire 
pendants and rings, says Cohan, many in California want jewelry that's 
different. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that color is so important for clothes, anything goes," he says. "People 
have loosened up, and the next step is to carry that over to jewelry." 
</P>
<P>
Cohan looks to the Southwest for unconventional jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be bored to death if I had to sell the same thing over and over. For me, 
the fun is showing unusual, different pieces." 
</P>
<P>
He travels around the reservations of New Mexico to find artists who make 
unusual jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll work with them to keep them in touch with what people like out here and 
motivate them to use different stones," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"They need people to inspire and push them. I tell them, 'Use purple. People 
are wearing purple.' But I don't want to imply I tell someone like Raoul Sosa 
what colors to use. He'd kill me." 
</P>
<P>
Two of his favorite jewelry artists, Sosa and Delbert Vandever, will visit his 
shop this month for separate shows. 
</P>
<P>
Sosa and Vandever both live in New Mexico and design jewelry inspired by the 
local landscape -- but similarities between the two end there. 
</P>
<P>
Sosa works in gold, Vandever in silver. Sosa has a gift for combining colored 
gemstones, Vandever for adorning his silver with fine etchings. 
</P>
<P>
Sosa grew up in Northern California, Vandever grew up on a reservation in New 
Mexico and has never seen the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Vandever, a 33-year-old Navajo, lives on a reservation in New Mexico where he 
makes silver jewelry just as his father and grandfather did before him. 
</P>
<P>
At age 13, he quit school to work as a silversmith. He picked up the trade 
quickly, and by 16 he was considered a master. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a genius at jewelry -- it was already inside him," Cohan says. 
</P>
<P>
He hammers his jewelry on an old sawed-off tree stump with a small pit carved 
out of the top for making rounded edges or domes on silver conches. He uses 
nail heads etched with his designs to stamp out patterns on his jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Vandever's feathers have become his trademark. 
</P>
<P>
The artist etches the fine grooves of the feathers by hand. One bracelet 
features a single feather that wraps around the wrist, available at Zia for 
$159. Feathers also dangle from earrings and pendants. 
</P>
<P>
He makes necklaces out of chains of feathers. One has a bold pendant adorned 
with a steer head and a lapis stone, available for $695. 
</P>
<P>
"He loves having a little surprise," Cohan says. "He'll do a turquoise 
bracelet, and on the inside will be a beautiful feather." On the flip side of 
one pendant fitted with a large purple stone, Vandever has added a bear claw 
and a small blue lapis. Such small details -- some which are seen only by the 
wearer -- distinguish his work. 
</P>
<P>
Vandever stamps all of his pieces with a tiny cowboy hat and feather -- a 
symbol of the eagle feather given to him by his grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
"He wears it in his hat and he's very proud of it. He uses it as his logo," 
Cohan says. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Stayner, a visitor from Washington, bought a Vandever necklace adorned 
with feathers and a large lapis to take back home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's different," she says. "It's not something you see all the time. I like 
the lines and the simplicity of the design. It's real elegant-looking." 
</P>
<P>
When Vandever's not making jewelry, he rides in the rodeo or works on the 
ranch, rounding up cattle and sheep. 
</P>
<P>
"He loves to compete," Cohan says. 
</P>
<P>
He has won hundreds of jewelry awards, including a best of show at the Santa Fe 
Indian Market, an annual competition featuring top jewelry artists, and the New 
Mexico State Fair. 
</P>
<P>
Vandever will bring his stump and tools and demonstrate his jewelry-making at 
Zia on Oct. 27 and 28. 
</P>
<P>
Sosa's strength as a designer rests in his fresh use of color. He's not afraid 
to mix turquoise and sugalite with diamonds. The 39-year-old artist works in 
Santa Fe, N.M., and draws inspiration from the landscape and architecture. 
</P>
<P>
"The light here is something else. Georgia O'Keefe said this is the only place 
in the world where true color exists," Sosa says. 
</P>
<P>
Sosa designed one ring with a teardrop-shaped sugalite stone set in gold and 
surrounded by pieces of opal and green turquoise, available at Zia for $3,750. 
He created a pendant in the shape of an arrowhead with an opal and a diamond in 
the center and a border of blue lapis and purple sugalite. It sells for $2,995. 
</P>
<P>
Some bracelets and rings have zigzag shapes reminiscent of the pueblos. 
</P>
<P>
"I love Indian ruins. A lot of the feeling and motifs come from ruins in 
Mexico," Sosa says. 
</P>
<P>
Sosa will show a large collection of his work at the shop Oct. 19, 20 and 21. 
His pieces sell for about $900 to $4,000.

A SWORD HELPED PROTECT FAMED MUSICAL BOND; 
</P>
<P>
O.C. MUSIC: THE GILBERT AND SULLIVAN RELATIONSHIP SEEMED NEAR AN END WHEN FATE 
INTERVENED AS A JAPANESE BLADE FELL. 
</P>

<P>
By one of those ironies that would fit right into their own comic operas, 
Gilbert and Sullivan wrote what would become their most popular work -- "The 
Mikado" -- just when their famous partnership seemed on the verge of breaking 
up. 
</P>
<P>
After the uncharacteristically modest success of their "Princess Ida," Sullivan 
had become ill. Also, prompted in part by well-intentioned friends who urged 
him to write oratorios and operas, he declared that he didn't want to write 
another comic work. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, for his part, didn't have any new ideas and suggested another version 
of a plot that Sullivan had long rejected -- in which one person would become 
another character by means of a charm or "lozenge." Sullivan wrote in his 
letters that he felt the idea was an impossibly "unreal and artificial 
concept." The two men exchanged what seemed to be parting shots in letters on 
May 3 and 4, 1884. 
</P>
<P>
Still, they both faced contractual obligations to produce something for 
impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte, who had created the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company 
to stage their works. Then, the story goes, fate intervened. A Japanese sword 
hanging in Gilbert's study fell off the wall and conjured up a whole 
topsy-turvy world in his mind. Within four days, he sketched out a summary of a 
new "Japanese" opera and sent it to Sullivan, who replied immediately with his 
"inexpressible relief" at "a plot without the supernatural and improbable." 
</P>
<P>
The partnership was on course again. 
</P>
<P>
First produced in 1885, "The Mikado, Or the Town of Titipu" ran for nearly two 
years -- 672 performances -- the longest run of any of the Savoy operas. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gilbert credited inspiration to the sword (which was used as a stage 
prop in the first production), the crusty librettist, as usual, enjoyed the 
opportunity to parody yet another extravagant social vogue in Britain, this one 
for japonaiserie. Japanese fans, wickerwork and knickknacks could be seen in 
every fashionable drawing room. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert took advantage of the Japanese Exhibition in London in 1884, where he 
found a geisha girl ("her English was limited to 'sixpence, please,' " he 
remarked) to take along to the Savoy rehearsals to teach the cast Japanese 
"deportment." She taught the women how to dress, make up and move with the 
quick, shuffling steps appropriate to ladies in kimonos. She instructed both 
the men and women in manipulating the large, ornate fans that became a feature 
of the opera, adding flair to every mood and gesture. 
</P>
<P>
In summary, the plot of "The Mikado" may sound more grim and bloodthirsty than 
it actually is. 
</P>
<P>
Nanki-Poo, the son of the Mikado, or Emperor of Japan, has disguised himself as 
a wandering minstrel to escape the attentions of Katisha, an elderly lady 
determined to marry him. He is in love with Yum-Yum, a beautiful schoolgirl, 
but she is engaged to her ward, Ko-Ko, the Lord High Executioner of the town of 
Titipu. 
</P>
<P>
Because there has not been a recent execution in Titipu, the Mikado threatens 
to demote the city to the status of a village unless an execution is carried 
out forthwith. The love-thwarted Nanki-Poo volunteers to be the victim -- 
provided he can marry Yum-Yum first and spend a month with her. Ko-Ko agrees. 
But before the plan can be carried out, the Mikado arrives, with Katisha. . . . 
Naturally, all the muddles and puzzles are worked out and the two young lovers 
are united. At the end, in fact, everyone is more or less happy with his or her 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert rewrote the plot 11 times. Sullivan began composing the music shortly 
before Christmas, 1884. The first thing he wrote -- in one day -- was "Three 
Little Maids From School." He composed "The Flowers That Bloom in the Spring" 
one evening between tea and dinner. His diary also recounts: "March 3rd: Worked 
all night at Finale, 1st Act. Finished at 5 a.m. 63 pages of score at one 
sitting." 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of the piece led other people to attempt their own productions. 
To forestall one such production in New York, Carte secretly sent a small cast 
to open "The Mikado" at the Fifth Avenue Theater on Broadway a week before his 
American competition mounted a production in August, 1885. 
</P>
<P>
The case went to court, where a Tammany Hall judge decided against the D'Oyly 
Carte. Judge Justice Divver of New York City ruled: "Copyright or no copyright, 
commercial honesty or commercial buccaneering, no Englishman possesses any 
rights which a true-born American is bound to respect." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, who was in the United States at the time, replied to the judge with 
an impassioned speech from his box at the end of a gala performance. The speech 
later was published throughout the United States and is credited for bringing 
about revision of the copyright laws of America. 
</P>
<P>
The American run, incidentally, lasted 430 performances. 
</P>
<P>
So how Japanese is it? 
</P>
<P>
"The March of the Mikado's Troops" is the only truly Japanese music in the 
whole piece. It is the march to which the imperial army reputedly marched to 
battle in 1868. 
</P>
<P>
But otherwise, not much at all. 
</P>
<P>
As the English author G. K. Chesterton wrote: "Gilbert pursued and persecuted 
the evils of modern England till they had literally not a leg to stand on, 
exactly as Swift did under the allegory of 'Gulliver's Travels.' I doubt if 
there is a single joke in the whole play that fits the Japanese. But all the 
jokes in the play fit the English." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Japanese were worried enough to protest, albeit briefly, during the 
opera's first run. And 20 years later, in 1907, the Lord Chamberlain withdrew 
"The Mikado's" license during a state visit by a Japanese prince. For six 
weeks, the play was officially banned. Even concert performances of the music 
were banned. Helen D'Oyly Carte, wife of impresario Richard, went ahead with 
her touring performances all the same. 
</P>
<P>
Later productions were decidedly unauthorized. A Berlin version in the decadent 
'20s featured Katisha arriving in an automobile, the schoolgirls in short 
skirts, a Charleston in the first-act finale and Yum-Yum bathing nude at the 
beginning of the second. There have been two "swing" versions, both on Broadway 
in 1939 (one starred legendary tapper Bill (Bojangles) Robinson). In a '60s 
television abridgement, Groucho Marx played Ko-Ko. In the '70s in London, a 
"Black Mikado" introduced West Indian touches. 
</P>
<P>
Would Gilbert have approved? 
</P>
<P>
We know that the librettist was renowned for his strictness with the cast and 
his close attention to detail. He once reprimanded George Grossmith, who was 
playing Ko-Ko, for adding some "comic" stage business -- rolling over 
completely on the floor when kneeling before the Mikado. Gilbert asked 
Grossmith to omit the roll in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, if you wish, but I got a big laugh by it," Grossmith said. 
</P>
<P>
"So you would if you sat on a pork pie," Gilbert answered. 
</P>
<P>
 The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company of Great Britain will present "The Mikado" 
tonight through Thursday at 8 p.m. and "The Pirates of Penzance" Friday and 
Saturday at 8 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m. at the Orange County

SCULPTOR TONY CRAGG'S URBAN RENEWAL OF THE PASTORAL TRADITION

<P>
If you didn't already know better, you could be forgiven for thinking, at first 
glance, that the 15-year survey of sculpture by Tony Cragg opening today at the 
Newport Harbor Art Museum is, in fact, a group show. Cragg is nothing if not 
diverse in his approach to sculptural materials and artistic forms. 
</P>
<P>
There are figurative images on the wall made from bits of discarded plastic, 
constructions of carved and polished stone or plaster, cast-iron and bronze 
forms, joined pieces made of sawed or lathed or painted wood and, finally, 
assemblages brought together wholly from found objects. If the survey is not 
truly comprehensive as a catalogue of the artist's materials and motifs -- this 
is not, after all, a career retrospective -- it nonetheless admirably suggests 
the breadth in a fairly tight number of works (34 in all). 
</P>
<P>
Still, something important and "of a piece" clearly emerges from the diversity 
in the exhibition. In an odd way, that unifying feature is less a coherent and 
clearly defined subject than it is a larger sense of ambition -- not merely 
ambition of a personal sort, but a powerful drive to open up a formidable 
tradition that had become clogged and restrictive. Cragg has lived in the 
rather obscure German town of Wuppertal since 1977, but he is nonetheless 
British for it (he was born in Liverpool). And what lurks throughout the work 
assembled in Newport is a visceral desire to take on -- and reform -- the 
venerable British tradition of the pastoral landscape. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony Cragg: Sculpture 1975-1990" is the first substantive survey of the 
41-year-old artist's work to be seen in the United States and one of the rare 
opportunities we've yet had to see Cragg's sculpture in Southern California. 
Organized by Paul Schimmel, former senior curator at Newport Harbor and now the 
holder of that post at the Museum of Contempoary Art, the show concentrates on 
sculptures made in the last five years (more than two-thirds of the 
exhibition), with but a single work from the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The focus is apt. Cragg first came to wide attention with his so-called 
"mosaic" sculptures, made from fragments of plastic refuse scavenged from the 
alley and the gutter, and the present exhibition includes four of those works 
made before 1987. And it was in 1987 that the Newport Harbor Art Museum hosted 
"A Quiet Revolution: British Sculpture Since 1965," a traveling six-artist 
survey (including Cragg) that provided a useful background for American 
audiences and on which this more incisive examination builds. 
</P>
<P>
The show is not installed chronologically, thematically or by medium in the 
museum's galleries and outdoor patios, but rather by a feel for visual 
contiguity and fit. Call this method of display itself a mosaic and a key to 
Cragg's often impressive endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
His earliest plastic mosaic sculpture, located in a rear gallery, is a 
rectangular floor piece, 8 feet wide and 12 deep, entitled "New Stones -- 
Newton's Tones" (1978). It is composed from what look like archeological 
potsherds of industrial civilization. Piles of plastic flotsam -- a blue bottle 
cap, the yellow handle of a toy shovel, a red fork, the green cab of a kid's 
truck, etc., as well as lots of indecipherable little remnants, have been 
sorted out by color and arranged on the floor to form the bars of a spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
The "new stones" of the title are a not-so-subtle reference to the sculpture of 
British artist Richard Long, who, in 1967, made a work called "A Line Made by 
Walking England," in which he walked a straight line back and forth across a 
grassy field until the line was clearly visible in the trodden path; this he 
photographed. Subsequently, Long's walks through the English countryside 
developed into a procedure whereby he gathered sticks and stones along the way 
and brought them back to the gallery for arrangement in a (usually geometric) 
sculptural form that would contain a kind of "physical memory" of the landscape 
as experienced. 
</P>
<P>
Cragg's "new stones" consist of industrial refuse collected on voyages through 
the urban landscape. Man-made materials are provocatively set up as direct 
equivalents for Long's natural, romantically inflected ones. The plastic 
mosaic's titular reference to Sir Isaac Newton, English mathematician and 
natural philosopher, underlines the assertion. 
</P>
<P>
What's odd about "New Stones -- Newton's Tones," and what may have called forth 
the figurative motifs for subsequent mosaics, is the way your eye reads the 
material stuff from which it is made. A sequential refinement occurs: Rectangle 
subdivides into spectrum, which divides into individual colors; these break 
down into a tonal array of diverse reds, yellows, blues, etc., which divide 
again into actual objects such as bottle caps and "abstract" bits of plastic; 
last but not least, the sculpture splits between solid and void, figure and 
ground. Having thus found yourself drawn into refined connoisseurship of 
individually material being, any arrangement of these plastic bits into a 
recognizable picture simply adds yet another layer of pleasurable complication 
to the interdependence of the figure and its ground. 
</P>
<P>
Cragg first went to art school in 1968, not long after Richard Long had 
documented his pastoral walk, and Cragg made his pivotal mosaic sculpture the 
year after he took his master's degree from London's Royal College of Art. 
Given Long's engagement of the pastoral tradition through sculptural means, and 
given Cragg's confident elaboration of Long's achievement, "walking England" 
leads straight to the front door of Henry Moore, whose pierced sculptures 
literally allowed the landscape to merge with the sensual body. 
</P>
<P>
It's important to remember just how imposing a figure Moore was at the time. 
His artistic reputation having consolidated in the 1950s, Moore was by then the 
most famous living artist in Great Britain and the premier modernist sculptor 
in the world. For a generation born in England after World War II, Moore's 
example and his legacy must have been daunting. 
</P>
<P>
The most imposing and beautiful work in the Newport show is a large, untitled 
1988 bronze that stands in relation to Moore's sensuously reclining, pierced 
sculptural forms as Cragg's plastic mosaics do to Long's gathered stones. One 
side of a 7-foot-tall vessel, reminiscent of a laboratory beaker, is stretched 
and pulled into space as if the bronze was really taffy. The extruded form 
swells and twists in a buoyantly organic and airy way, the beaker's mouth 
elongated into a graceful, liquid curve. The upright beaker shape and the 
voluptuous open form move in and out of view as you walk around the sculpture, 
interpenetrating one another with an unmistakably sexual charge. 
</P>
<P>
A fundamental difference between this sculpture and anything Moore ever did 
will be found in the nature of its emphatic materiality. Moore worked in 
bronze, but typically for the sake of its durability; bronze was used to cast 
forms originally conceived as carved masses. Cragg's extruded beaker is, by 
contrast, a literally fluid vessel, whose image, shape and material echoes the 
very process involved in casting molten metal. The industrial, process 
orientation of post-Minimal sculpture has marvelously materialized in what 
would have seemed to be a stubbornly resistant medium. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony Cragg: Sculpture 1975-1990" continues through Dec. 30 at the Newport 
Harbor Art Museum, 850 San Clemente Drive, Newport Beach. Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m., Tuesdays through Sundays. Admission: $2 to $3. Tonight at 8 p.m., Cragg 
will lecture at UC Irvine's Student Center. Tickets: $5, $7 and $8.

</P>
<P>
The party, which believes that President Frederik W. de Klerk is selling out 
the country's whites, plans a series of provocative resolutions, including one 
rejecting what it calls "the doomed reform measures," another praising the Zulu 
nation for resisting the "oppression" of the African National Congress and 
South African Communist Party, and another linking AIDS to blood transfusions 
in multiracial hospitals. 
</P>

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dressed in faded jeans and a Hawaiian shirt, Joe Wilson settled into a deck 
chair beside his tiny swimming pool in suburban Baghdad the other night, fired 
up one of the fat cigars that have become his trademark, and reflected on yet 
another day as the cutting edge of U.S. policy in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
It was well after midnight, but his dinner of cold pizza and olives remained 
uneaten on the kitchen counter. Joseph C. Wilson IV, the highest-ranking U.S. 
diplomat in Iraq and the man President Bush officially designated as "his man" 
in Baghdad days after the current Persian Gulf crisis began, had been far too 
busy to eat. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, he had spent hours this day haranguing low-level Iraqi officials 
about the plight of scores of ailing and aged American hostages, and hours more 
arranging the nightmarish logistics for a series of freedom flights taking 
American women and children out of occupied Kuwait city. Then, there were the 
press briefings, reports to Washington and the basic work of running an embassy 
that has been America's only official presence behind enemy lines since the 
Persian Gulf crisis erupted nearly 10 weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
When Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said in those early days he was ready to 
talk to Bush, the U.S. President responded that if Hussein had anything to say, 
he could say it to Joe Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
But even with such a burden squarely on his shoulders, the 41-year-old career 
diplomat from an established Northern California family showed few signs of 
strain as he sat with a Times reporter in the early morning autumn blackness 
outside his modest, Malibu-style Baghdad residence. Far from it. To hear Joe 
Wilson tell it, he's just getting started. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you kidding, or what?" Wilson laughed when asked whether the weeks he has 
spent commanding the front lines of America's diplomatic combat with Iraq were 
finally beginning to take their toll on him. 
</P>
<P>
"No way. For a diplomat, it can't get any better than this," he said. "This is 
it. This is the ultimate test and the ultimate challenge. This is what we're 
trained for. This is the major leagues. This is what I spent all those years 
clinging to the vines of small African countries learning, studying, preparing 
and waiting for. I've always dreamed of covering a war as a diplomat, and now 
that I'm here in the middle of it; it's absolutely fascinating." 
</P>
<P>
If there was a faint strain of immodesty in Wilson's tone, it was well within 
context. Disarmingly frank even in the quietest of times, the UC Santa Barbara 
graduate has carefully crafted an image -- both in public and in private -- 
that is finely tuned to personify official U.S. policy toward Saddam Hussein. 
President Bush is outraged by Hussein's invasion, annexation, and continuing 
occupation of Kuwait. So, Wilson's public pronouncements and daily meetings 
with Iraqi authorities are steeped in the kind of bluster and angry confidence 
most likely to convey that pique. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe Wilson has taught the Iraqis a whole new set of four-letter words, as well 
as some interesting new ways to use them in combination," noted a European 
diplomat in Baghdad who has witnessed some of the American's angrier meetings 
with Iraqi Foreign Ministry officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of a reverse diplomacy," the European envoy added. "In most 
situations as a diplomat, you don't want to offend. But in Joe's case, here and 
now in Baghdad, I think he'd actually be a little disappointed if he didn't. 
And that's exactly the role that he should be playing here now. He must make it 
clear on each and every occasion that America is mad as hell and that it isn't 
going to take much more." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, Wilson's antics have gone beyond words. 
</P>
<P>
At one point last month, for example, when U.S. Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III engaged in some psychological warfare by publicly turning an 
innocuous Iraqi diplomatic note into what he inaccurately characterized as an 
outrageous threat to execute Western diplomats in Baghdad, Wilson read the cue 
perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, the American diplomat showed up at a briefing for Western 
journalists here with a noose around his neck. The gesture wasn't meant as 
"gallows humor," he stressed, but as a powerful physical statement of America's 
utter disdain for the Iraqi regime. 
</P>
<P>
Still, his friends and colleagues in the State Department insist that the role 
he is playing out here in Iraq is perfectly suited to Wilson, who combines the 
textbook skills of Old World diplomacy with the looser and more innovative 
approach that characterizes many members of the department's new generation of 
diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
If Wilson had any weaknesses coming into the present crisis, it was his 
relative lack of experience in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Before arriving in Baghdad from Brazzaville, Congo, 13 months ago, Wilson had 
spent most of his career as an administrator posted to embassies in former 
French colonies throughout the African continent. The son of a journalist, he 
spent several childhood years in Paris. He met his French wife, Jacqueline, on 
a golf course in Burundi, and, were he not at the eye of the diplomatic storm 
in Baghdad, Wilson would be taking his scheduled autumn vacation at the 
couple's home near the French Riviera town of Hyeres. 
</P>
<P>
Since coming here, however, Wilson has purposely put thoughts of France and 
Africa aside in order to immerse himself in the complexities of the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
"I was phenomenally lucky when I arrived here," Wilson said of his posting as 
deputy chief of mission to veteran U.S. Ambassador April C. Glaspie a year ago. 
"As far as I'm concerned, April is the finest Arabist in the State Department, 
and I had strengths in administration. So, our deal was I'd put together the 
management of the embassy, and she'd teach me everything she knew about Arab 
affairs. It's been like a crash graduate course." 
</P>
<P>
Not even Wilson knew how valuable that course would be at the time. But, when 
the invasion of Kuwait was launched on Aug. 2, Wilson clearly needed every bit 
of knowledge he had been able to absorb -- Glaspie had left for her summer 
vacation a few days before, and Wilson suddenly found himself alone at the top 
amid the biggest crisis in decades. Since the Bush Administration supposedly 
wanted to avoid sending the "wrong signal" to Iraq by returning Glaspie to her 
post after the invasion, her No. 2 has remained No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson insisted that his crash course in Arab affairs provided enough of a 
foundation to handle the crisis at hand. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of being in the Middle East, this is the center of it," Wilson said 
of Baghdad. "The Iraqis have a finger in every game in the Middle East, and 
Iraq's role has traditionally been both key and pivotal. So, I do think this 
has been the best possible classroom to prepare for handling this crisis." 
</P>
<P>
It is, however, an increasingly lonely job. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great team," Wilson said repeatedly during the first weeks of the 
crisis, referring to what was then a nine-person embassy staff and the way they 
all managed to handle the personal stress of operating in a hostile land. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last month, three of the embassy's top staff members were declared 
persona non grata and forced to leave Baghdad in retaliation for a European 
Community decision to expel all Iraqi military attaches and other diplomatic 
staff from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, I think this is the loneliest night of my life," Wilson said with 
uncharacteristic sadness that night during another poolside session after 
escorting his departing colleagues to Saddam International Airport. "Those guys 
really have been keeping all of us going. And now, we're just six." 
</P>
<P>
Even then, however, Wilson's depression quickly evaporated. Firing up another 
cigar, the bulky diplomat sat back in his deck chair and started in again on 
what has become his favorite subject of conversation -- Saddam Hussein and the 
latest moves in what Wilson likes to think of as a prolonged, high-stakes poker 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we'll just keep on plugging away and doing our thing out here," Wilson 
concluded on a genuinely gleeful note that dismissed gloomier aspects of the 
crisis at hand. "And, hell, in the meantime, you've got to look at the brighter 
sides. I mean, it's not like we've been forgotten out here. For one thing, 
we've all been collecting danger pay since the 11th of August, and, hey, that 
helps pay the mortgage."

FILLING A VOID WITH 'QIGONG' IN CHINA;

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hypnotic voice of qigong master Zhang Ruming floated through a hall packed 
wall-to-wall with 300 working-class Beijing residents. 
</P>
<P>
"The lotus flower endlessly grows," Zhang intoned. "The lotus flower envelops 
you. Think, 'I am the lotus flower. The lotus flower is me. . . . The lotus 
flower is all of nature.' " 
</P>
<P>
Everyone seemed lost in quiet meditation on the soothing words, rich in 
Buddhist imagery. But no one considered this a religious meeting, at least not 
openly. 
</P>
<P>
Those in the crowd had come in the belief that they could receive healing 
benefits of the master's qi -- the vital energy of life. They believed that he 
had the gong -- the skill -- to control this force and impart it to them. At 
the start of the meeting, a dozen people had offered testimonials to Zhang's 
healing power. 
</P>
<P>
The gathering reflected an explosion of interest in qigong (pronounced 
CHEE-goong), a blend of Chinese medicine, Buddhist and Taoist philosophy, 
magicians' tricks and traditional exercises that is quickly expanding to fill a 
deep spiritual void in Chinese life. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities here view the phenomenon with a nervous mixture of respect and 
fear. Qigong is not a political force. But it pulls people together in loose 
associations that are not government-controlled. Some observers believe that it 
could ultimately challenge the Communist Party's wide-ranging grip on social 
life and that this, in turn, could have unpredictable political consequences. 
</P>
<P>
It is generally estimated that there now are at least 60 million practitioners, 
up from a few hundred thousand a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The strongest organizations in China today, after the Communist Party, are the 
rapidly growing qigong associations," the respected Hong Kong-based 
China-watching magazine Contemporary recently declared. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional religion in China was suppressed by the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung, 
who instilled in its place a fanatical belief in his own power. Then, Deng 
Xiaoping replaced the cult of Maoism with economic reforms, promoting a 
widespread conviction that China was on the road to prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
But Deng's own prestige, and that of the Communist Party over which he 
presides, was among the casualties last year when the People's Liberation Army 
fired on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing. People were left with nothing 
to believe in. Especially in the cities, where disillusionment struck deepest, 
many are turning to qigong. 
</P>
<P>
 At its most fundamental level, qigong is based on deep-breathing exercises. 
These can be used simply to keep fit. They also are used in meditation and for 
the concentration of energy that medical qigong claims can be achieved. 
</P>
<P>
The exercises themselves, which fit into a well-established pattern of morning 
calisthenics, enjoy official approval. Performances of qigong tricks, such as 
breaking bricks with one's head, are routinely offered as public entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Respected physicians sometimes credit qigong with healing powers. An 
international symposium on qigong and health will be held in Beijing in 
November. It is widely believed that senior leader Deng, 86, is himself treated 
by a qigong master. Some Chinese say this explains why he has lived so long. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese media have printed articles warning of qigong's dangers, 
including risks of hallucination and mental breakdown. As part of a broad 
effort to bring qigong activities under official supervision, sweeps have 
recently been made of exercise classes in public parks, with instructors 
required to register their names. 
</P>
<P>
Qigong gatherings of more than 1,000 were banned after several 1988 rallies in 
Beijing drew up to 15,000 frenzied participants who writhed, screamed, laughed 
or cried as masters projected qi upon them. But this ban failed to stop 
qigong's spread. 
</P>
<P>
The official newspaper, the China Daily, reported in August that there are now 
200,000 to 300,000 adherents of qigong in Beijing alone, with 23 institutions 
conducting teaching or research into the discipline. Only one of these centers 
had registered with the proper authorities, the article complained. In 
addition, it said, there are more than 200 "guidance centers" with more than 
600 instructors in public places such as parks. 
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine has launched a 
program to license all medical-related qigong activities, and "anyone working 
in breach of the rules would be severely punished," the article said. 
</P>
<P>
The report also stated that eight medical qigong clinics have already been 
ordered to close this year, and two individuals "have been detained . . . on 
charges of swindling." 
</P>
<P>
Fears of political instability have helped prompt such assertions of government 
control. 
</P>
<P>
"Qigong is a popular folk religion with very strong indigenous roots," Stan 
Rosen, a professor of political science at the University of Southern 
California, commented during a recent visit to Beijing. "With no other belief 
system left in China, it fills a vacuum. It can spread extremely rapidly in a 
situation where people don't believe in the government. I think that's why the 
government is afraid of it." 
</P>
<P>
Rosen noted that several episodes in Chinese history provide precedents for 
growth of powerful mass movements based on religious or quasi-magical beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most famous of these was the so-called Boxer Rebellion of 1900, an 
anti-foreign uprising launched by members of a secret society that practiced a 
discipline called "Boxing of Righteousness and Harmony." Practitioners believed 
that Taoist magic made them invulnerable to foreign bullets. 
</P>
<P>
"The Boxers thought they were invincible," Rosen noted. "The qigong people have 
a similar belief. The qigong people believe anything is possible as far as 
curing illness. . . . At a time when the government is emphasizing stability 
above all else, these kinds of movements are very dangerous. The 
dissatisfaction is so strong, and the lack of control is so obvious now, 
there's fertile ground for something like qigong to take root." 
</P>
<P>
Qigong practitioners generally do not deal with political issues, however, and 
even religious aspects are usually ignored or downplayed. While acknowledging 
that the discipline has roots in Buddhism and Taoism, most masters insist that 
in China today, qigong is primarily a science and a theory of life. 
</P>
<P>
"Qigong has something to do with religion, but there is a difference between 
the two," said Chen Linfeng, a qigong master who founded a branch of the 
discipline called Huiliangong ("The Skill of Wisdom and the Lotus"). 
</P>
<P>
"Qigong is just a name, while its contents are varied," Chen said. "For 
instance, qigong can keep people fit, which is something on the surface. It can 
be used to cure patients, which is something deeper. It can also produce new 
wisdom. That is the deepest aspect. Qigong is not a religion, but a kind of 
theory. It is the theory of wisdom." 
</P>
<P>
Chen added that in his view, Buddhist meditation, the Taoist search for 
immortality, Christian prayer and Hindu yoga all incorporate elements of 
qigong. He also noted that qigong has developed against a background of 
government promises of religious freedom made when China's economic reform 
program was launched in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Chen's own life provides a glimpse into a shrouded world of mystics that 
survived the violent anti-religion campaigns of the 1966-76 Cultural 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1962, Chen learned his art growing up in the countryside. At the age of 
5, he started learning qigong exercises from his father. A few years later, he 
said, there rose in his mind the image of a bearded old man, a master who could 
teach him much more. Then one day he met a Buddhist monk, a faith healer, "who 
looked exactly the same as I imagined," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I became his last pupil," Chen said. "I told him I wanted to cure patients 
(like he did). . . . He asked me to set my mind to saving all living creatures 
from a sea of bitterness." 
</P>
<P>
The year that the Cultural Revolution ended, Chen, still only 14, began his own 
career as a faith healer, he said. In recent years he has focused on spreading 
knowledge of qigong rather than offering cures. 
</P>
<P>
"Qigong is a way to wake up people," he said. "If all of society attains a 
correct understanding of things, then power struggles and wars will disappear. 
This is because you are me and I am you. Someone older is my father or my elder 
brother, those younger are my little brothers, just like a family. All of 
society will be equal, as in the Buddhist Paradise." 
</P>
<P>
At the opposite end of the spectrum from such philosophical musings is qigong 
entertainment based on alleged supernatural powers. 
</P>
<P>
Yuan Xiyin of Beijing's Orient Qigong Troupe put on such a performance at a 
recent variety show, balancing his body on a large metal trident with the 
sharply pointed middle prong pressed against his stomach. The stunt began with 
the claim that should Yuan lack true qigong, he would surely be hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Such tricks contribute to an atmosphere in which most Chinese credit qigong 
with capabilities unexplained by modern science. But they also provoke a 
backlash. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper "Health News" recently ran an expose of qigong stunts such as 
walking on balloons or sending shocks of electricity through people's bodies. 
Fu Weizhong, a qigong master, was quoted as explaining that these performances 
depend on mechanical principles or hidden equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"Qigong is a treasure of the Chinese nation, but now it has become a tool used 
by quacks and swindlers," Fu lamented. 
</P>
<P>
Most adherents of qigong are not too interested either in philosophy or stunts. 
They have aches or illnesses, and they want cures. 
</P>
<P>
"I have tumors all over my body, which relate to each other just like a net, 
but since I've come to this course my neck has become flexible and my back 
pains are relieved," said a middle-aged woman at Zhang's qigong meeting. 
</P>
<P>
A young man in the crowd credited Zhang's power with curing him of a hacking 
cough. A paraplegic man, hope in his voice, said that attendance enabled him 
first to feel pain and tingling in his legs, then a sensation as if worms were 
climbing up his body. 
</P>
<P>
Zhang claims that in a clinical study, his type of qigong eliminated gallstones 
in more than 30 out of 50 patients. 
</P>
<P>
He explained the treatment this way: "Qigong masters conduct their brain waves 
to patients, who are asked to lie down in a state of complete physical and 
spiritual relaxation. . . . The energy comes from the hands and brains of the 
qigong masters." 
</P>
<P>
Such techniques "are part of Chinese traditional medical treatment," Zhang 
said. "But people usually acknowledge only herbal medicine and acupuncture. Now 
we should restore another part, that is qigong." 
</P>
<P>
Qigong is also credited with more mundane benefits in daily life. 
</P>
<P>
Wei Qing, a young amateur photographer, said she gets fresh ideas for pictures 
by reading a book of qigong poetry called "Daily Songs of Spiritual Linkage." 
Like some prayer guides in the United States, this book has one poem for each 
day of the calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
Long Ying, creator of these songs, said they are based on five mystical words 
that his father and grandfather learned decades ago from a Taoist monk, who 
used them in treating Communist guerrillas injured in battle with Japanese 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
"The seriously wounded could avoid death, ease their pain and restore their 
health," Long said. "My ancestors wrote down these things." 
</P>
<P>
For those who must know how or why, there is no real answer. 
</P>
<P>
"Qigong, this science, is a profound mystery," Zhang declared to his enraptured 
audience. "Many things cannot be explained."

The bust was made after California Highway Patrol officers discovered the 
cocaine earlier this month, packaged and stuffed into secret compartments in 
two big rigs, Los Angeles Police Cmdr. William Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
The seized drug has an estimated street sale value of $20 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure sparked the investigation that resulted in the arrests of the seven 
people earlier this month. Four of the arrests were made locally while the 
other suspects were captured in New Jersey on Oct. 13, Booth said.

South Korean Prime Minister Kang Young Hoon proposed direct trade with North 
Korea and a visitor exchange involving the elderly today on the eve of the 
second round of talks with his northern counterpart, Yon Hyong Muk. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by six other delegates, 33 support personnel and a 50-member 
official press corps, Kang arrived in Pyongyang at about 1:20 p.m. on the first 
trip to North Korea by a South Korean prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Kang said on arrival that it is deplorable and frustrating that only South and 
North Korea are left split while other divided nations of the world are united, 
but the meetings were a positive step toward reunification. 
</P>
<P>
"Differences in ideology and system between the two parts of Korea must no 
longer form a barrier dividing the people. The first thing to do to demolish 
the barrier of national division and become one as soon as possible is to 
restore Korean ethnic community," he said.

Nadia Comaneci, the gymnastics darling of the 1976 Olympics, said the man who 
helped her flee Romania last year, far from being her lover, kept her prisoner 
in the United States, beat her regularly and cheated her of $150,000 in income. 
</P>
<P>
Comaneci said the ordeal lasted three months and took her on a harrowing 
journey through Florida, California, New York and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
She said that shortly after arriving in the United States, she was locked in 
hotel rooms and a Los Angeles apartment and was not even allowed to answer the 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Comaneci, 29, said Constantin Panait had taken her earnings from interviews and 
magazine layouts and returned with his wife and children to his native Romania.

"I am not a scandal person," she said. "This is not my image."

The army today set up a checkpoint outside the French Embassy, where defeated 
Christian Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun has taken refuge, heightening Lebanon's 
diplomatic quarrel with France over Aoun's fate. 
</P>
<P>
Government bulldozers continued removing mines and mounds of earth along the 
five-mile Green Line that divides Beirut into Christian and Muslim sections. 
Workers on Monday opened one key intersection, the Galerie Semaan crossing, and 
motorists honked horns in jubilation as they drove through. 
</P>
<P>
Several Cabinet ministers today compared the planned dismantling of the Green 
Line to the removal of the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
The unification of the war-torn Lebanese capital is the next step to follow 
Saturday's end to Aoun's 11-month mutiny, when his troops were crushed in a 
Syrian-led assault. 
</P>
<P>
France granted Aoun asylum Saturday, and French President Francois Mitterrand 
on Monday called the decision "a matter of honor." 
</P>
<P>
But Lebanese Agriculture Minister Mohsen Dalloul said the government is 
determined to bring Aoun to trial and have asked the French to turn him over. 
</P>
<P>
The army posted an armored personnel carrier and 12 soldiers, one equipped with 
tear gas canisters, on a checkpoint about 300 feet from the embassy in East 
Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
French diplomats said the measure amounted to a siege. The French news agency 
Agence France-Presse quoted diplomats as saying that large numbers of troops 
had surrounded the embassy and closed all approaches. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a newspaper today quoted a Cabinet minister in President Elias 
Hrawi's government as saying that the Western hostages held by pro-Iranian 
Shiite Muslims in Lebanon will be freed soon. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Dalloul said Syrian President Hafez Assad's government has 
made progress in its efforts to free the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"The question of the hostages is about to come to an end. Our Syrian brothers 
are carrying out contacts and have achieved progress," the leftist Beirut 
newspaper As-Safir quoted Dalloul as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The daily said Dalloul declined to speculate on a release date or to say 
whether the 13 hostages would come out together or separately.

USAir flight attendants have agreed to a tentative 18-month contract with the 
airline, the Assn. of Flight Attendants said today. 
</P>
<P>
The union, representing 30,000 flight attendants at 18 airlines, said the 
accord was reached after more than a year of negotiations. A federal mediator 
entered the talks in July. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the tentative pact were not disclosed pending a ratification vote by 
union members "sometime in late November," the association said. 
</P>
<P>
"The agreement represents a significant victory for USAir flight attendants in 
maintaining their industry-leading contract in the face of tough economic 
times," union leader Dee Maki said. 
</P>
<P>
The airline, headquartered in Arlington, Va., recently dropped expansion plans 
and laid off hundreds of employees.

In a ruling that could derail a plan by a Connecticut utility to take over 
Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, a judge late Monday overturned a 
$500-million bond issue that was to have partially financed the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Northeast Utilities of Berlin, Conn., is taking over PSNH in a $2.3-billion 
plan to bring the New Hampshire utility out of bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is to be partially financed through the sale of pollution control 
bonds, about half of them tax-exempt, issued through the state's Industrial 
Development Authority. 
</P>
<P>
PSNH is the lead owner of the Seabrook nuclear power plant, and the bonds would 
nominally finance pollution control projects at Seabrook. 
</P>
<P>
But the bond issue was challenged in a lawsuit by Robert Cushing of the 
Campaign for Ratepayers Rights and other Seabrook opponents, who charged that 
the IDA was misusing its authority by approving bonds that would actually be 
used to finance a corporate takeover.

General Electric Co. said today that sales of aircraft engines and power

business, gave the company a 9% boost in third-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
For the quarter, after-tax profit totaled $1.02 billion, or $1.16 a share, 
compared with earnings of $945 million, or $1.04 per share, a year ago.

<P>
Revenue for the quarter rose 9.2% to $14.2 billion from $13 billion in the same 
period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of 1990, earnings rose 10.5% to $3.06 billion, or 
$3.44 a share, from $2.77 billion, or $3.06 a share, in 1989. Nine-month 
revenue rose 7%.

Northwest Airlines said today it will raise fares 5.8% on tickets purchased on 
or after Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
"The price increase is designed to further combat higher operating costs 
resulting from fuel prices that have more than doubled since Iraq invaded 
Kuwait Aug. 2," the airline said. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest, the nation's fourth largest carrier, and other airlines already have 
raised fares 9.5% in two steps since late August. 
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the Mideast crisis, the spot price for jet fuel has jumped 
from about 57 cents a gallon to $1.42 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
In another effort to cope with fuel costs, Northwest last week asked its labor 
unions to consider a 10% wage cut for half a year in lieu of layoffs. But the 
International Assn. of Machinists, the carrier's largest union, rejected wage 
cuts.

RAIDERS DEAL MCELROY TO SEATTLE; ALLEN, BEUERLEIN STAY IN L.A.

The Raiders traded safety Vann McElroy, a two-time Pro Bowl performer, to the 
Seattle Seahawks today for an undisclosed future draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, running back Marcus Allen and reserve quarterback Steve Beuerlein, 
two players rumored to be headed elsewhere, stayed put as the NFL trade 
deadline passed. 
</P>
<P>
McElroy, 30, was a training camp holdout in a salary dispute and has played 
only sparingly on special teams since being activated. 
</P>
<P>
McElroy was a third-round draft choice of the Raiders in 1982 from Baylor and 
became a starter in his second season. He earned Pro Bowl honors in 1983 and 
1984 and was an alternate selection in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, McElroy was off to what he called his best start before he suffered a 
torn hamstring, which sidelined him for the most of the rest of the season. He 
returned for the final three games. 
</P>
<P>
During the time McElroy was out, Eddie Anderson established himself at free 
safety. When McElroy returned, he was used as a backup. 
</P>
<P>
In his career with the Raiders, McElroy intercepted 31 passes and had four 
quarterback sacks on safety blitzes.

Rock guitarist Carlos Santana has accused the Miller Brewing Co. of mimicking 
without authorization his rendition of "Black Magic Woman" in a TV commercial. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit filed Monday alleges Miller and its New York ad agency, Backer 
Spielvogel Bates Inc., violated trademark law in the commercial for Miller Lite 
Beer. Santana's lawyer, David Phillips, said damages may surpass $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit claims the brewer knowingly used an "imitation of Santana's 
distinctive guitar playing." 
</P>
<P>
Although Santana did not write "Black Magic Woman," the lawsuit said, the 
public considers it his "theme song." Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac wrote the 
1970 hit. 
</P>
<P>
Miller spokesman Steve Forsythe said the brewer had no comment.

Andie MacDowell, the repressed young wife in "sex, lies, and videotape," 
flinches at the possibility of becoming a superstar. 
</P>
<P>
"I like doing normal things, like going to Disney World with my family. 
</P>
<P>
And it would be terrible not to be able to because of fame," MacDowell said in 
the November issue of Glamour magazine. 
</P>
<P>
MacDowell, who was a top model before landing her first role in "Greystoke," 
lives in a Victorian house in Upstate New York with her husband, model Paul 
Qualley; son Justin, 4, and daughter Rainey, 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
If she weren't an actress, she said, she would be "a mother and a gardener." 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a huge vegetable garden, everything from arugula to broccoli, to corn 
to sunflowers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She has two new movies coming out soon: "The Object of Beauty" with John 
Malkovich and "Green Card" with Gerard Depardieu.

Actress Shirley MacLaine says her relationship with Meryl Streep while filming 
"Postcards From the Edge" was nothing less than "awesome." 
</P>
<P>
The last time Old Hollywood met New Hollywood -- when MacLaine and Debra Winger 
co-starred in "Terms of Endearment" -- there were a series of skirmishes 
between the two actresses. 
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Entertainment Weekly magazine, Hollywood insiders 
predicted similar quarreling between MacLaine and Streep. But it didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
"Meryl is a genius," MacLaine said. "You don't say her name in the same breath 
as Debra Winger's. Or mine. She's got a whole other thing going there. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more akin to channeling than anything else. It's awesome."

Ed Begley Jr. says he has been into recycling since 1970 and recently refused a 
ride in an NBC limousine during a promotional tour for his new TV series, 
"Parenthood." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Begley said in the November issue of Redbook, he rode his bike from 
his San Fernando Valley home to the Century City studio. 
</P>
<P>
"It's late. But it's not too late," said the former "St. Elsewhere" star, who 
is on the boards of seven environmental organizations and recycles everything 
from newspapers to metal products. 
</P>
<P>
"People have to realize that they can turn this around quicker than they think. 
How? By exercising their voting power and their purchasing power."
