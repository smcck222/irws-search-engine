Doris Bloch wants to thank the youngster who donated four toy Soviet jets to 
the downtown relief organization she heads. 
</P>
<P>
But, inasmuch as she's executive director of the Los Angeles Regional Food 
Bank, she says that the aircraft will have only a short stopover there. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll give them to an agency that deals with needy children," said Bloch, 
noting that Christmas is approaching. 
</P>
<P>
She offered her thanks to the anonymous benefactor, but added that "he should 
work on his spelling." 
</P>
<P>
A note accompanying the gift said: "I donate theys micro jets to th needy. I am 
sory to say that I stoel them but my dad paid for them when he found out about 
it. I will pay my dad back." 
</P>
<P>
Just a temporary cost overrun. 
</P>
<P>
Several blocks north, pink balloons were carefully tied Sunday to a fence along 
a trash-littered sidewalk on Winston Street. A Skid Row wedding was about to 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
The bride, Tamara McZeal, 18, arrived in a flowing white dress, a gift from the 
Skid Row Ministry of the West Angeles Church, which organized the event. 
</P>
<P>
The groom, Albert Franco, 35, wore a turquoise-and-white sweater and a gray 
pair of pants. 
</P>
<P>
The two, who had been living in a nearby motel, said they wanted to show others 
that good things can happen on Skid Row. But an unwanted guest showed up: A 
camera crew from a local television station. 
</P>
<P>
"No cameras!" the groom yelled. 
</P>
<P>
The couple, a few friends and a church minister then jumped into a car and sped 
off. They exchanged vows on the steps of the County Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, when the newlyweds were certain that the TV crew was gone, they 
returned to the dirty street, where they ate wedding cake on a folding table. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted it to be just us," Franco said. 
</P>
<P>
"Just us and Skid Row." 
</P>
<P>
The city of Long Beach will go to court in two weeks in an attempt to make 
resident Ski Demski take down the 95-by-160-foot American flag that he flies in 
his front yard. The charge: The big flag flaps too noisily. 
</P>
<P>
But the San Francisco Giants, who might welcome noise after their lifeless 
World Series beginning, are more appreciative. Demski's flag -- an Only in L.A. 
regular -- will be unfurled today at Candlestick Park during pregame 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
"At least something from down here will be in the World Series," quipped 
Demski. 
</P>
<P>
An ache up her sleeve: Hathu Koff suffered minor injuries when a Los 
Angeles-based tour bus flipped on its side in Las Vegas the other night. It 
didn't stop her from gambling. But she did switch to push-button video poker. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel like pulling the slot-machine arm," she explained, "because my 
side is hurting too much."

AL MARTINEZ: UNDER A RED OCTOPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Resuming a column after a long absence is like trying to have a baby in your 
50s. It's possible but not easy. 
</P>
<P>
You have to go at the thing slowly. The column thing, I mean. 
</P>
<P>
You get off the plane in L.A. after a month in far places, drag your stuff from 
the luggage carousel, lie your way through customs, catch a cab to the nearest 
hotel and sign up for a tour. 
</P>
<P>
A tour? Let me explain. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I had been driving through Europe in a rented car since 
mid-September, down crooked little alleys and up the kinds of mountainsides 
where even goats won't go. 
</P>
<P>
We took roads through the Pyrenees so difficult to traverse that 2,000 years 
ago Roman generals on the path of conquest said to hell with it and turned 
back. They said it in lyrical Latin, but meant it no less. 
</P>
<P>
My wife loves these untraveled byways and it does no good for me to explain the 
reason they are untraveled is because they are twisty, foggy, slippery and 
probably haunted by werewolves. 
</P>
<P>
That part of the world is famous for cathedrals and demons. 
</P>
<P>
She dismisses danger with a sweep of her hand. "Press on," she says. 
</P>
<P>
God help me, I married Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
I ended up, of course, loving every mile of it. I wrote the word charming so 
many times in my travel diary I got sick. 
</P>
<P>
It was undoubtedly hyperglycemia. My body isn't accustomed to prolonged 
injections of a positive attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, however, we were at Lourdes, where even lepers feel hopeful. My 
recovery, while unaccompanied by hosannas, was complete. 
</P>
<P>
"Doesn't it strike you as odd," my wife said as we headed north toward the 
unknown, "that there have been 64 miracle cures at Lourdes but only one miracle 
sickness?" 
</P>
<P>
I love it when she's incredulous. 
</P>
<P>
Then, suddenly, we were back in L.A., which, when you have been swimming in 
sweetness, is like clicking your heels together three times and waking up in 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
We had literally been exploring castles in Spain just a few hours before, and 
there we were in Inglewood. Trust me when I tell you no one ever applies the 
term charming to Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
We desperately needed to be re-acclimated to L.A., to be reintroduced, as it 
were, to the town that gave more press to Zsa Zsa Gabor's scuffle with a cop 
than to Manuel Noriega's scuffle with a revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, we stopped at a Marriott hotel and signed for a four-hour look 
at Los Angeles on a tour bus loaded with East Indians, Germans, Danes, two 
Okies and a cluster of Japanese businessmen who took notes the entire trip, no 
doubt calculating the risk of a buyout bid on Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Our bus driver was from East Brooklyn, so we got a lot of dats and deres over 
the PA system, such as, "Youse folks would be interested in dat place dere on 
the left owned by a Canadian kid named Michael J. Fox." 
</P>
<P>
We were seeing L.A. through the eyes of Archie Bunker, but that didn't bother 
the boys from Tokyo. They just kept on taking notes. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murphy's mansion on a hill got the biggest rise from the Okies. "Man," 
one of them said wistfully, "ah bet it's loaded with groupies." 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows?" the bus driver said. "Now dose places on da right . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Next stop, the Fairfax District where a woman with orange hair and black makeup 
paraded through Farmer's Market. She wore a cowboy outfit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm feeling more at home," I said to my wife. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still back with the demons," she said. 
</P>
<P>
I watched the Cowgirl From Hell walk by. "They may have followed us," I said. 
</P>
<P>
On to Hollywood where Super Evangelist Billy Graham was getting a star on the 
Walk of Fame. God would like that. I heard a Japanese tourist ask one of the 
Okies who Billy Graham was. 
</P>
<P>
"A Christian," the Okie replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Ahhh," the Japanese said, writing it down. 
</P>
<P>
There were no buildings rich with history on the L.A. tour, unless you count 
the little gray house once occupied by Grace Kelly. We saw her other place in 
Monaco, shining like a child's dream. 
</P>
<P>
There were no castles, cathedrals, Roman ruins or museums dedicated to the old 
masters; no gondolas, no sidewalk cafes, no cobblestone streets. Just . . . 
well . . . L.A. 
</P>
<P>
That night, still being tourists, we took a Marriott recommendation and ate at 
a neo-Mexican place in Venice called Rebecca's. 
</P>
<P>
The food wasn't important. The decor was. My wife pointed upward. 
</P>
<P>
We were seated under a giant red-domed octopus made of plastic beads and bathed 
in light. Its tentacles were amber and gold. It clung to the ceiling like a 
magic spider. 
</P>
<P>
I ordered a martini and relaxed. Home at last.

STANFORD STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carol Watson's otherwise excellent story (Part I, Sept. 27) on Stanford 
freshman Lupe Vasquez, who came from an Oxnard shelter for the homeless, gives 
life to the fading myth that California private education is primarily for the 
wealthy and privileged. 
</P>
<P>
By treating Vasquez as an exception to Stanford's "country-club image," and 
claiming that "freshmen are as likely to have $2,000 computers as they are to 
have notebooks," Watson overlooks a reality of education in California, and at 
Stanford in particular: that the best and the brightest of our college students 
come from increasingly diverse backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of Stanford's entering freshmen need and receive financial aid, 
and approximately 100 have parents who are unable to make any contribution 
toward the cost of their education. Stanford remains committed to a "needs 
blind" admission policy and guarantees that the demonstrated financial need of 
all accepted applicants will be met.

BIGOTRY ON CAMPUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Brooks Slaughter's column, "Bigotry Is Back in Fashion" (Editorial Page, 
Oct. 7), and its charge that racism is back on our nation's campuses was 
accurate, perceptive and disturbing in its implications about the very places 
where an intelligent dialogue should be taking place that would demolish the 
very foundations of racism. 
</P>
<P>
Yet these college campuses are now the fertile ground for a new racism that 
must not go unnoticed or unattended. This alarming rise in racial ugliness can 
be found on every campus, public and private. I teach at a well-known Catholic 
university in Los Angeles that has witnessed several such racist incidents over 
the last several months and for which yet another "committee" will investigate 
and make recommendations. It is discouraging to see this sort of thing on a 
campus that prides itself on social justice, but this epidemic knows no 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
It can only be dealt with by swift, decisive, dedicated action. If the skinhead 
mentality is allowed a foothold in academia, future generations are at risk. 
Slaughter, president of Occidental College, appears to be one educator who not 
only "talks the talk" but who "walks the walk." We need more such campus 
leaders.

BIGOTRY ON CAMPUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a shame that we are seeing a return of bigoted minds in the hallowed 
halls of learning. These minds today should be totally free of this cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Yet today to understand this we see something that lights this fuse, a feeling 
of frustration in these young people that we have not seen before, failure 
because things are "not fair." 
</P>
<P>
I spoke to a young man, age 21, who is a senior at UC San Diego. He plans to 
enter the medical profession. I've known him since his birth. He has never had 
a bigoted bone in his body. Years have developed a successful student, athlete, 
leader and a compassionate human being. When asked whether his college 
grade-point average would permit access to a UC medical school he stated, "Dad, 
it isn't fair . . . our family had no slaves, were part of the system and we 
succeeded to be educated and earn an honest living; now we hear that more seats 
must be filled with minorities. Dad, it's not fair." 
</P>
<P>
I do not believe in discrimination but when I hear that affirmative action has 
replaced selection based on merit and aptitude I can understand the frustration 
of a young man who sees people far less qualified being given "extra points" 
for affirmative action. It becomes personal. To express feelings in opposition 
brings cries of "racist." 
</P>
<P>
The kids today are feeling the brunt of all this and a few respond in socially 
unacceptable ways. They are not right in what they do, agreed, but let's look 
at the problem. My son is right when he says, "Dad, it's not fair."

What Slaughter has to say is, sadly, very true; I have perceived what he 
describes. But my perception is that bigotry is but a part of a swelling tide 
of intolerance in this country. The mood began seeping to the surface during 
the Reagan Administration, which made us feel comfortable with our prejudices. 
Not only are blacks' civil rights being threatened, but also the civil rights 
of other minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
What a striking coincidence that this mood of bigotry and intolerance is 
worsening as Christian fundamentalists are becoming more politically active. It 
seems that the Christianity of these religious fanatics is based on 
intolerance, conformity and ignorance.

A STEP FOR WORLD SAFETY, IF EAST BLOC IS SERIOUS; 
</P>
<P>
TERRORISM: THE SOVIETS MAY NOW RECOGNIZE IT AS A MENACE THAT MUST BE FOUGHT, 
THOUGH THEIR ACTIONS SO FAR GO ONLY PARTWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERNEST CONINE, Ernest Conine writes a column for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Western governments were intrigued but skeptical when Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
declared almost four years ago that "the Soviet Union rejects terrorism in 
principle and is prepared to cooperate actively with other states to uproot 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union and other East Bloc nations have a long track record of 
providing weapons, training and sanctuary for America-hating terrorists 
dedicated to the destruction of Western democracy through assassination and 
sabotage. They have been the major source of arms and political support for 
Syria and Libya, which in turn have sponsored the Middle Eastern fanatics who 
maim, murder and kidnap in the name of holy war against Israel and 
"imperialism." 
</P>
<P>
Evidence is growing, however, that the Soviets really have come to see 
international terrorism as a menace that must be fought in cooperation with the 
United States and other countries. If so, the ramifications for the war against 
terrorism are incalculable. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's 1986 remarks on terrorism were followed by feelers to the West and 
subsequent U.S.-Soviet contacts on the subject. Formal superpower talks opened 
last June. And an unofficial task force of U.S. and Soviet experts has twice 
met to discuss possible areas of cooperation. The last such meeting, which 
included an ex-CIA chief and two former generals in the KGB secret police, 
occurred this month in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Task force members agreed on the need for "timely exchange" of information on 
terrorist plans and activities. They proposed that no nation "sponsor, 
encourage, train or supply any kind of terrorist activity," and that all 
governments "take all appropriate measures to . . . persaude other nations and 
groups with which they have contact to cease and desist from employing 
terrorism tactics." 
</P>
<P>
The proposals bear no official imprint so far, but they are being relayed to 
both governments in preparation for a second round of official talks. 
</P>
<P>
Most Western experts dismiss any notion that the Soviets have masterminded the 
global terrorism network. But Moscow has supported terrorist groups that would 
have existed anyway in the apparent conviction that violence directed against 
the capitalist West was, by definition, in the Soviet's interest. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Third World "freedom fighters" received training in subversion and 
sabotage at training camps in the Soviet Union, Cuba, North Korea, Bulgaria and 
Czechoslovakia. Many later emerged as terrorists. Defecting terrorists have 
told of East German and Cuban instructors at similar training camps in the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets clearly are in a position to provide, if they will, a gold mine of 
information on the personalities, communications and logistics arrangements of 
international terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
But why should they do us favors? Part of the answer, Western experts believe, 
is that Moscow has become increasingly concerned that links with terrorists 
could seriously endanger the good relations with the West that are essential 
for the economic success of perestroika. Beyond that, the Soviets have come to 
realize that terrorism could endanger the internal stability of the Soviet 
Union, too. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Jenkins, formerly of the RAND Corp., recently noted that, while many 
incidents have not been publicly reported, "in recent years hijackings inside 
the Soviet Union and terrorist attacks against Soviet officials abroad have 
brought the Soviet Union to fifth place in the list of terrorist targets." 
</P>
<P>
In view of the nationalist fervor now sweeping the Soviet Union, the Kremlin 
must be uneasy that terrorist tactics could be adopted by anti-Soviet elements 
in the Baltic states, the Ukraine and especially the southern border republics 
with their large Muslim populations that might be potentially susceptible to 
the fundamentalist extremism that is rampant in neighboring Iran and 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, one suspects, would like to head off the possibility of home-grown 
Soviet terrorists receiving support from the West. What's needed now is action 
to back up the rhetoric of cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have gone part way. They are credited with helping to influence the 
Palestine Liberation Organization to embrace efforts for a negotiated 
settlement with Israel. They are also said to have bluntly told Syria not to 
use military force against Israel, to have urged a policy of restraint upon 
Iran and to have been active in trying to end the cycle of murder and terrorism 
in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
If the Soviets are serious, though, they could do much more. They could 
pressure Cuba, Bulgaria and East Germany to stop giving aid and comfort to 
visiting terrorists. As the major supplier of arms to Syria and Libya, they 
could exert great leverage on these state sponsors of terrorism to knock it 
off. They could blow the whistle on impending terrorist operations known to 
Soviet intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Until such things happen, the Soviets will be a part of the problem instead of 
the solution.

BILLS GET LAST CHANCE, GIVE THE RAMS FIRST DEFEAT, 23-20

<P>
With the game secured, intended messages sent, Greg Bell's clock rung, Frank 
Reich discovered, the unbeatens beaten and 1:33 remaining, a football game 
unraveled at the seams and unfolded into Monday night history -- a conclusion 
seen but not believed by the Rams, who may need weeks to recover. 
</P>
<P>
The Buffalo Bills defeated the Rams, 23-20, before 76,231 at Rich Stadium on an 
eight-yard scoring pass from Reich to receiver Andre Reed with 16 seconds 
remaining. But one play doesn't begin to tell the story of the Bills who, in a 
span of 1 minute 17 seconds, won a game, lost a game, and snatched a game back, 
using a near-impossible scenario that included a quarterback making his first 
National Football League start. 
</P>

It started innocently with Bill tailback Thurman Thomas, who was running out 
the clock on a 16-13 win, the Rams helpless after failing on fourth down at 
their own 22. Thomas headed into the line on first down, and was stripped of 
the ball by linebacker Mel Owens. Michael Stewart somehow recovered at the 22 
with 1:33 and one last breath of life to be breathed. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jim Everett heaved a pass over the middle on first down and Flipper 
Anderson somehow caught it and eluded defenders Kirby Jackson and Leonard Smith 
on the way to a 78-yard touchdown play with 1:22 left, deadening a sellout 
crowd and sending the Rams into gyrations of elation on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills were left with barely more than a minute and three timeouts with 64 
yards to cover behind Reich, Jim Kelly's replacement and a man who once went 
three years without throwing a pass in this league. 
</P>
<P>
It was thought Reich had worked his one miracle for the evening, leading the 
Bills on a fourth-quarter drive that ended with a one-yard scoring pass -- the 
presumed game-winner -- to Thomas with 2:23 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Reich is a boot salesman by trade, a quarterback by perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
When he took control behind center at his own 36 with 1:17 remaining, the 
Anderson catch firmly embedded, there seemed little chance. But the Rams were 
lying back, and Reich chopped them to pieces, the first deep cut coming on an 
18-yard pass to Thomas to the Ram 43. With 26 seconds left, Reich dumped a pass 
to Thomas for 15 yards to the Ram 22. 
</P>
<P>
Then came a swing pass to Ronnie Harmon, who moved passed safety Vince Newsome 
for 14 yards to the Ram eight. Twenty seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
What could Reich have up his sleeve? Who before Monday night could have cared? 
</P>
<P>
Reich's final strike to Reed was perfect on a post pattern. Reed lined up left 
and cut to the middle in front of Rams' cornerback LeRoy Irvin. Reed crossed 
the goal's plane with 16 seconds left, briefly stopping Ram hearts and making 
Reich a hero. 
</P>
<P>
It was a game in which the final two minute outshone the first 58. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Sutton, the ex-Ram cornerback who keeps following his former teammates 
around the league -- he's already faced the Rams this season as a Green Bay 
Packer -- set up the Rams' first score when he fumbled a wind-blown punt at his 
own 16 with 7:08 left in the quarter. On third and eight at the 14, Everett 
dumped a pass over the middle to Buford McGee to get the Rams to first and goal 
at the four. One play later, Everett found McGee again on a three-yard scoring 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Bills' defense, inspired by Bruce Smith and Cornelius Bennett, wouldn't 
let the Rams pull away. 
</P>
<P>
With with 6:13 left in the half, the Bills, with great pleasure, forced Bell to 
fumble for the first time in 112 carries this season. Jeff Wright recovered at 
the Ram 20, and although the drive stalled, Buffalo made it 7-3 on Scott 
Norwood's 38-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills shut down the Ram offense again on the ensuing possession, and got 
the ball back with 2:16 left at the Ram 49. 
</P>
<P>
Reich hit Reed on passes of nine and five yards to help get Buffalo close 
enough for Norwood. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the Bills barely managed. Norwood's 47-yard field goal with 
56 seconds left grazed the crossbar on its way over, slicing the lead to 7-6 at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, who made no secret this week his disdain for Buffalo, was generally 
crushed at every turn. He gained 44 yards in 21 attempts but vowed to move on. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the media tried to hype this game," Bell said. "I just tried to go out 
and play the best football that I was capable of playing. Tomorrow morning we 
will wake up and this game will be history. We are going home 5-1 instead of 
being 6-0." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams had so many chances to prevent a miracle finish it bares inspection. 
On the first play of the second half, Thomas, who gained 105 yards in 24 
carries, fumbled at his 33. But the Rams were knocked out of field goal range 
when Smith sacked Everett for a five-yard loss to the 37. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the third quarter, with the Bills driving in Ram territory, Reich's 
pass went through cornerback Jerry Gray's hands and bounced into Reed's for a 
nine-yard gain. Had Gray held on, he might have scored. Instead, the Bills 
drove on and cut the lead to 10-9 on a 40-yard field goal by Norwood with 14:09 
left. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams drove 60 yards on their next possession, but again had to settle for 
three -- on Lanford's 36-yarder -- instead of seven. 
</P>
<P>
The Bill defense, reborn after a slow start and local criticism, returned to 
form against the Rams, sacking Everett twice and causing several more poor 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Ellard, the NFL's leading receiver, made his first catch with 5:05 left 
in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"No question, they played their best game of the season," Bill Coach Marv Levy 
said of his defense. "They gave up that touchdown at the end on a great play, 
but they rose time and time again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ram linebacker Fred Strickland sprained his left ankle in the second half but 
X-rays were negative. . . . Jim Everett completed 15 of 36 passes for 219 yards 
with two touchdowns and one interception.

VALLEY EARNINGS: SALES AND PROFIT INCREASE 19% AT SUPERIOR INDUSTRIES

ERMA BOMBECK: MESSING AROUND WITH A CLEAN LIFE 
</P>

<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Erma Bombeck is on a book tour. This Best of Bombeck release originally 
appeared on Sept. 28, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the best fiction being written today is never serialized in the slick 
magazines and never makes it to the New York Times list. They're messages 
between the working wife/bachelor and the woman who comes in to clean their 
house/apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes they never even see each other. They communicate only by notes left 
on the refrigerator door. The following is a series of written communiques 
between Wilma and her employer, Mrs. Rutledge. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Rutledge: There is a cat mess at the end of the sofa. -- Wilma 
</P>
<P>
Wilma: I know. -- Mrs. Rutledge 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Rutledge: What do you want me to do with it? -- Wilma 
</P>
<P>
Wilma: You are limited on options. You can surround it with sand and use it as 
a putting green, gift-wrap it and amaze your friends, or clean it up. I prefer 
the latter. -- Mrs. Rutledge 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Rutledge: I was going to clean up the you-know-what, but the sweeper 
smells funny and sounds strange and won't pick up anything. Can you fix it? -- 
Wilma 
</P>
<P>
Wilma: The cat is missing. I suggest you check the sweeper bag. -- Mrs. 
Rutledge 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Rutledge: The cat was not in the bag. Maybe the cat mess is not a mess at 
all. It looks just like something in a green bowl in the refrigerator. Is it 
what I think it is? -- Wilma 
</P>
<P>
Wilma: What do you think it is? -- Mrs. Rutledge 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Rutledge: I knew once, but I forgot. The sweeper works just fine. What did 
you do to it? -- Wilma 
</P>
<P>
Wilma: I emptied the bag. -- Mrs. Rutledge 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Rutledge: You know that little problem I told you about two weeks ago 
about the cat? I think I solved the problem. I moved the sofa over it and you 
can hardly notice it now. -- Wilma 
</P>
<P>
Wilma: You're fired! -- Mrs. Rutledge 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Rutledge: There is another cat mess I didn't tell you about. It's hard to 
find. I'm the only one who knows where it is. Goodby. -- Wilma

Deep Time: The Journey of a Single Subatomic Particle From the Moment of 
Creation to the Death of the Universe and Beyond by David Darling (Delacorte 
Press: $17.95; 192 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Most books about the history of the universe and everything in it begin with 
the Big Bang and come up to the present day. By now it is a familiar story: The 
gigantic explosion that started it all, the formation of the light elements, 
followed by stars, supernovas, the heavy elements, planets, primordial soup, 
amino acids, DNA, evolution and, voila, you and me. 
</P>
<P>
David Darling's "Deep Time" goes one or two or three steps further. It begins 
with the Big Bang all right, sweeps through the present and soars off more than 
a hundred billion years into the future, when the implications of quantum 
theory reach full flower and we discover that mind is the most important thing 
there is. It has made the universe go. 
</P>
<P>
"Only through observership could the universe become, by progressive stages, 
conscious of itself, comprehending of itself, and, ultimately, selective and 
creative of itself," Darling writes near the end of the book. 
</P>
<P>
"Presently it astonished itself by realizing that it had this power -- that it 
was the self-creating universe. . . . Thus was the terrific conception 
revealed. That mind was what transformed the abstract mathematical 
relationships of the world into perceived reality, gave substance to the 
equations. That there was nothing concrete outside the mind. That mind created 
reality -- inner and outer -- and, at the same time, allowed the underlying 
mathematical relationships to be symbolized and better understood." 
</P>
<P>
And that's not all. The upshot of this discovery, according to Darling, is that 
the past and the present and the future in some sense are all one. The future 
already exists in mind, and the past has not ceased to be. "The creation of the 
universe was in some curious way bound up intimately with what was to come," he 
says at one point. Mathematics and physics and God and man are all one, too. 
</P>
<P>
At least, that's what I think he says. The end of the book gets a tad hokey -- 
but that's a matter of taste (as what isn't?). 
</P>
<P>
But I'm giving away the end. Let me go back to the beginning. Darling, a 
science writer with degrees in physics and astronomy, tells us at the outset 
that he is always dissatisfied with books about cosmology because they never 
deliver what they promise. They never answer the big questions like where did 
the universe come from and what is the meaning of it all? He aims to rectify 
that failing. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is that nobody knows the answers for sure. In fact, nobody knows 
whether those ultimate questions have any answers. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a book that is grounded in science but skirts the edges of 
science fiction, blurring the distinction between the two. It's like one of 
those fictionalized biographies by Irving Stone. Like Stone, Darling begins 
with what is known and fills in the interstices with plausible guesses. And 
who's to say that he is wrong? 
</P>
<P>
"Deep Time" has many strengths. Darling crams a lot of information into 192 
pages, and he does it by not getting bogged down in details, as many more sober 
books about cosmology do. This is not to say that he plays fast and loose with 
the facts. Rather, he has the right level of generality for interested 
nonspecialists. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Darling writes very well despite a tendency to overwrite here and 
there. His descriptions have a breathless tone, which can be put down to his 
great affection for the subject. He has obviously thought a lot about it. Along 
the way, he muses about what he is describing. Here is part of his discussion 
of the start of life on Earth: 
</P>
<P>
"Was there some magical moment when the first living thing appeared? A dramatic 
instant when a flash of lightning, say, struck the primal ocean and caused two 
innocuous-looking molecules, by chance, to fuse and come alive? Of course not. 
That never -- never could have -- happened. For the simple reason that there is 
no sharp distinction between living matter and nonliving. No molecular Adam . . 
. . The juncture at which life begins is defined by us, not by nature." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, whether Darling's conclusions are right or not, he deserves credit 
for tackling the questions. This is a speculative and provocative book that 
extends what is known into what is unknown. It is not just another book on 
cosmology, of which there are many good ones in print. The emphasis here is on 
wonder. 
</P>
<P>
But I'm still not sure I know where the universe came from and what it all 
means.

FIRST NOVEL CAPTURES MANY 'VOICES'

Voices From Home by Neil Caudle (Putnam: $19.95; 304 pages.) 
</P>
<P>
There really isn't anything more wonderful in the world than opening a book 
you've never heard of by a first novelist whose name you don't know and 
beginning to read with no expectations at all, then being jerked up one side 
and down the other as if Malcolm X himself was teaching you the Lindy Hop, or 
the Virgin Mary was leaning out of a cloud to haul you up to heaven on an 
unexpected weekend jaunt. "Voices From Home" is absolutely wonderful, and Neil 
Caudle is absolutely amazing. 
</P>
<P>
Caudle's got first-novel-fever, for one thing. He's tried to pack this book 
with as many ideas as a squirrel has nuts in the ground in case a truck runs 
him over before he gets to write a second book. Caudle takes as his material 
not just the Changing South, but he makes his narrator a 15/16-year-old girl 
and never falters for one word in his language or tone. (Caudle actually could 
be a 16-year-old girl, for all I know, and that bearded man on the jacket an 
impostor.) 
</P>
<P>
But what about the nature of art, Caudle also wonders, of being existentially 
engage? The importance of finding your own cosmically perfect spot in the 
universe? What about the individual's relationship to his or her parents? How 
can a person claim his or her familial legacy and still be free? And -- just in 
case Caudle should get struck by lightning before he gets around to his second 
novel -- how can children cope with the nightmares of childhood, divorce, adult 
persecution, and finally, one of those domestic crimes that should seal 
anyone's fate forever? Last but not least, God knows, what is the role of 
suffering in the life of an artist -- or, turning the question on its head, is 
it at least possible to transmute suffering, not just the lead of daily life, 
but the deadly toxic chemicals of terrible injustice and fear and brutality and 
sadness into the gold that goes beyond gold, the real stuff: High Art? 
</P>
<P>
Well, sure!, Caudle says, as he rides this bronco of a book that sometimes 
almost gets out of control but never does. Libby Lampert is only 15 when her 
beautiful, charming, cool-dude dad takes up with another woman and Libby's 
mother, cutting her own losses, kicks him out. Libby and her brother, Buddy, 
freak. Part of the problem may be the Southern town they live in, small and 
claustrophobic, where blacks and "white trash" live on one side of a creek, and 
the aspiring middle class lives on School Hill. Libby's mother came from 
"better." Her dad, who used to be a baseball player, came from the wrong side 
of the creek. He has made it to the "right" side, but his "instincts" bring him 
down. He lives with his new girl in a squalid trailer. She drinks; he 
brandishes his guns. 
</P>
<P>
Libby's mother takes the safe road. She finds an unglamorous house painter, 
moves to Chicago and takes her senile, dementia-case mother with her. Libby and 
Buddy choose to stay in town, battling the agony that telegraphs every minute 
of the day: They're not wanted. What does "society" do to these kids? Society 
brands them as juvenile delinquents, of course, and some of the scenes with a 
cruel social worker are spookily Dickensian. How do you live when your whole 
life is falling apart? What can you do from minute to minute to keep from going 
crazy? Libby tries drugs, sex, and the consolations of a best girlfriend. But 
her lover and her best friend are black, and in this town, love and/or 
friendship with blacks is a crime far worse than murder. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, those who are going to survive do survive. This ascension above 
existential agony is probably the greatest miracle of any life. Libby 
repudiates her mother, then gets her back. Libby adores her father, then frees 
herself from him, gets humiliated, and jerked around, and preached to, and 
betrayed, and bullied, but at every instant, life itself is going on -- almost 
too precious to put into words. Libby stands with her brother by a car drinking 
cold beer. She shares one cigarette with her dad. She allows her 5-year-old 
cousin to adore her from afar. She tells whopping, monstrous lies that are an 
art form in themselves. And finally, in an ending that's been present in clue 
after clue, she extricates herself from the past enough to make art out of all 
of her terrible experiences. 
</P>
<P>
If Pete Dexter's "Paris Trout" (an amazing work) danced in a sock hop with 
Gavin Lambert's "Inside Daisy Clover," the result might be "Voices From Home." 
In real life, Pete Dexter and Gavin Lambert would probably never even speak to 
each other, but still, this electric, literary liaison has happened. What a 
kick! What a marvelous, beautiful surprise!

Theater audiences are going ga-ga over baby movies. Tri-Star's romantic comedy 
"Look Who's Talking," which features the voice of Bruce Willis as a precocious 
embryo, set a new fall opening record with $12.1 million on 1,208 screens. The 
previous record belonged to Universal's "Sea of Love," which debuted last month 
for $10 million. "Look Who's Talking" -- averaging a strong $10,023 per screen 
-- follows on the heels of Universal's "Parenthood," which has grossed $87.4 
million since its release in August. Galaxy's "Halloween 5: The Revenge of 
Michael Myers" cashed in on its Friday the 13th opening and the upcoming 
holiday to gross $5 million. Jeff and Beau Bridges as two piano-playing lounge 
lizards in Fox's "The Fabulous Baker Boys" finished sixth in the box office, 
grossing $3.3 million on 858 screens -- a per-screen average of $3,862. In all, 
an unusually high 15 films opened over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
* Avenue's critical hit "Drugstore Cowboy," starring Matt Dillon and Kelly 
Lynch as two junkies, opened in three theaters -- one in Los Angeles and two in 
New York -- for $51,068, a smash $17,022 per screen. At the Nuart in Los 
Angeles, the independent film broke opening day records, grossing $6,458.

Table, WEEKEND BOX OFFICE; Photo, WEEKEND BOX OFFICE John Travolta stormed back 
into theaters this weekend in Tri-Star's playpen comedy "Look Who's Talking," 
which smashed fall box-office records with a take of $12.1 million. Travolta, 
who bombed in 1985's "Perfect" and went straight to videocassette last year in 
"The Experts," has two other films awaiting release.

'FROG GIRL' STANDS HER GROUND IN 'SCHOOLBREAK SPECIAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1987, Jenifer Graham, a 10th grader at Victor Valley High in Victorville, 
had her biology grade changed from an A to a C for refusing, on moral grounds, 
to dissect a frog. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by the Humane Society, she took the issue to court. Although her C grade 
still stands, her suit helped bring about California's Students' Rights Bill, 
allowing students to make a choice about dissection without fear of penalty. 
</P>
<P>
CBS tells her story in "The Frog Girl," today's "Schoolbreak Special" at 3 p.m. 
on Channels 2 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
It's a straightforward telling: Jenifer's request that she be excused from the 
dissection because, as a vegetarian and animal lover, she found it ethically 
wrong; the escalation of administration objection to her bucking of the system, 
and her distress at being the target of contempt from other students and on 
view in the media. 
</P>
<P>
Intercut throughout the film are snippets of re-enacted testimony before a 
California legislative subcommittee considering the students' rights measure. 
(Lesley-Anne Down makes the briefest of cameos here.) 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Harry Longstreet -- he and Renee Longstreet wrote the script -- the 
show itself is a trial at times. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Dunning, as Jenifer, is not particularly appealing, too often seeming 
whiny and holier-than-thou. As her mom, Kerrie Keane appears to blossom during 
all the media attention, like an overeager stage mother. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the film succeeds in showing Graham's story as a fascinating progression 
of events. 
</P>
<P>
While the issue may seem frivolous at first, the point is made that using a 
disposable supply of small lives deserves serious thought. LYNNE HEFFLEY

GISH CONFRONTED WITH DATE RAPE IN 'NOT A STRANGER' 
</P>

<P>
After sitcoms, TV likes to fill its time with social evils. Like "When He's Not 
a Stranger," a cautionary tale on campus rape. It airs tonight at 9 on Channels 
2 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
The movie, courtesy of executive producer Don Ohlmeyer and writer-director John 
Gray, is about a dreamy frosh named Lyn (Annabeth Gish, who made such a strong 
debut in the feature "Mystic Pizza" as the innocent kid sister; she's 
appropriately vulnerable and distraught here). 
</P>
<P>
Lyn leaves her little home in New York to study at a college in our state. 
Handsome star quarterback Ron Cooper (John Terlesky) inveigles her into his 
dorm room and rapes her. 
</P>
<P>
What ensues is pain, then anger. Her roommate, who's "dating" Ron, doesn't 
believe her; her parents are dubious; the football coach says her allegations 
will hurt the team; the college panel beats her up with its questions, then 
finds no evidence of physical rape. 
</P>
<P>
Lyn bravely persists and files felony rape charges. In the end, there is a plea 
bargain and it looks as if Ron will get off with probation -- until. . . . 
</P>
<P>
There isn't much here that we haven't seen on "Cagney &amp; Lacey" and "L.A. 
Law," etc. The script opts for simple-minded characterizations and elementary 
insights. But anything additional on the subject is helpful. This sort of 
brutality doesn't go away. IRV LETOFSKY

PANEL BACKS EXPANDED IN-FLIGHT SMOKING BAN; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: SENATE AND HOUSE NEGOTIATORS AGREE TO EXTEND THE PROHIBITION ON TOBACCO 
TO 99% OF DOMESTIC TRIPS.

In a dramatic setback for the tobacco industry, Senate and House negotiators 
agreed Monday night to ban smoking on all airline flights within the 
continental United States and on flights of six hours or less to or from 
Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
"The Marlboro Man has just lost all of the sky for his territory," said Ahron 
Leichtman, an enthusiastic anti-smoking lobbyist. "It's a big victory." 
</P>
<P>
The ban, part of an $11.9-billion transportation appropriations bill, would 
take effect 90 days after the measure becomes law. Currently, cigarette smoking 
is forbidden on domestic flights of two hours or less -- about 80% of domestic 
flights affecting two-thirds of all domestic passengers. 
</P>
<P>
The new ban would apply to 99% of domestic flights and affect nearly all 
domestic passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N.J.), chief Senate sponsor of the smoking ban, 
called it "a milestone." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, which represents U.S. tobacco companies, 
noted that the agreement would permit smoking on several non-stop flights 
outside the continental United States. "It's not what we would have liked, but 
it's better than a total ban," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under congressional procedures, the agreement worked out in conference 
committee will go back to the House and Senate for final approval before it is 
sent to the White House for President Bush's signature. Both chambers are 
expected to go along with the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to reduce health hazards to airline passengers began with a National 
Academy of Science recommendation for a ban in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Outlines of the compromise were worked out in a Senate committee room 
prominently posted with "No Smoking" signs. At one point, negotiations almost 
broke down over what once was a politically untouchable issue. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate had approved a total ban on smoking on all domestic flights within 
the 50 states but the House voted merely to make permanent the temporary ban on 
flights of two hours or less. 
</P>
<P>
When the House delegation took a poll on whether to go along with the Senate 
position, the vote was 6 to 4 against the total ban. Lautenberg appeared ready 
to break off the conference without an agreement rather than yield his 
position. 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Martin Olav Sabo (D-Minn.), chewing on an unlit cigar, managed to work 
out the compromise with the aid of Rep. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), convincing 
five of the six dissenters to go along with the version exempting a handful of 
flights. Only Rep. Jamie L. Whitten (D-Miss.), chairman of the Appropriations 
Committee, balked. 
</P>
<P>
While Lautenberg at first refused to bend from the Senate-approved total ban, 
he and other senators eventually supported the plan outlined by Durbin. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. William H. Gray III (D-Pa.), the Democratic whip, at first refused to go 
along with the Senate position but accepted the compromise even though he said 
it went much further than he would prefer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a smoker," Gray added. "I stopped about five years ago -- cold turkey. 
But I do believe in supporting the House position." 
</P>
<P>
Gray tried but failed to get Senate conferees' approval for a ban on smoking 
only during the first several hours of domestic flights but the proposal ran 
into a stone wall of opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be impossible to administer and would lead to panic smoking toward 
the end of a flight," Durbin protested. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, the conference appeared to be deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
Lautenberg and the chairman of the House conferees, Rep. William Lehman 
(D-Fla.) then put their heads together, literally, over the long, narrow table 
that divided them. 
</P>
<P>
Others went to work with Sabo's suggestion to allow smoking only on "very, very 
long flights" and institute a total ban inside the 48 contiguous states. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief recess, Lautenberg reconvened the meeting and announced: "We've 
had a chance to reflect on our position. Reflection always helps to cool 
ardor." 
</P>
<P>
Durbin outlined the compromise and Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) made sure 
it applied to flights going to and from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands 
as well as Alaska and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, the compromise was set. Gray said that he would support the 
agreement on the House floor despite his earlier reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Lautenberg, who at first said that he did not know how to compromise on the 
public's health, ended the conference by noting that airlines could impose an 
even broader smoking ban voluntarily, without the pressure of federal law. 
</P>
<P>
But he made no bones about his objections to airline smoking, saying: "It's 
like smoking in a telephone booth -- repulsive."

100,000 SURGE THROUGH LEIPZIG TO URGE REFORM

The biggest demonstration in East Germany in decades took place Monday night in 
the southern city of Leipzig as at least 100,000 opposition activists surged 
through the streets after peace services in five Protestant churches. 
</P>
<P>
They crowded into Karl Marx Square in the center of East Germany's 
second-largest city as part of a mass effort to urge the hard-line Communist 
regime to introduce political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the people" and "Give young people power," they chanted. Some carried 
banners calling for free elections, unrestricted travel and a free media. 
Breaking with tradition, the official East German news agency ADN, a radio 
station and the main television evening news program all carried accounts of 
the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not interfere with the marchers, staying on the sidelines as they 
did last week during a similar gathering, when the turnout was estimated at 
50,000. The estimated number of people in the street Monday night made it the 
biggest protest since worker riots in 1953, which were suppressed by Soviet 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Warsaw, the East German Embassy reversed its policy and began 
giving East Germans travel documents enabling them to emigrate to West Germany. 
At least 1,300 East Germans are in the Polish capital waiting for 
transportation that would allow them to join an exodus of refugees to the West. 
</P>
<P>
The East Berlin regime had insisted that these citizens be sent back through 
East Germany so they could be officially "expelled" as undesirable. The tactic 
backfired, however, when hundreds of other East Germans tried to jump on board 
the westbound trains. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, officials at the East German Embassy began handing out emigration 
papers to their countrymen. Ambassador Juergen van Zwoll personally met the 
first two busloads of East Germans when they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"The East German government found a solution for those East German citizens who 
are in Poland by issuing them a certificate of renunciation of citizenship and 
providing them with an identification paper," Van Zwoll said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that "these people can go to whatever country they wish -- their 
further destination does not interest us." 
</P>
<P>
Several East Germans confirmed that they were required to sign a certificate 
renouncing their citizenship and that they were then given new identification 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are stateless people," one said as he left the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Not for long, however. The first group of East Germans to call at their embassy 
moved quickly on to the West German Embassy, where they were given travel 
documents and then prepared to depart for West Germany. West Germany recognizes 
only a single German citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
An official with the Polish airline LOT said the airline had received inquiries 
from the West German Embassy about chartering flights to West Germany, and a 
spokesman for the West German airline Lufthansa said his company is ready to 
fly the refugees out if called on to do so. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, Austrian police said Monday that about 1,800 East 
Germans crossed the border from Hungary en route to West Germany in the 
previous 24 hours. About 36,000 East Germans have crossed into Austria from 
Hungary since Sept. 11, when Hungary opened its border to the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
In East Germany, members of the reform-minded group Democratic Awakening 
demanded in an open letter to East Berlin Mayor Erhard Krack that the state 
undertake an inquiry into police beatings of demonstrators during celebrations 
10 days ago marking the 40th anniversary of the East German state. 
</P>
<P>
The letter said hundreds of citizens have complained that they were humiliated 
and mistreated for more than 24 hours, adding: "Violence and intimidation are 
not suitable conditions for the democratic dialogue all sides are seeking."

CORNEL WILDE, DASHING FILM STAR, DIES AT 74 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
Cornel Wilde, whose athletic abilities first brought him to Hollywood and whose 
elegant physique, good looks and dramatic talent kept him there for nearly 50 
years, died in Los Angeles early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Wilde, whose film portrayals ranged from the romantic composer Frederic Chopin 
in "A Song to Remember" (for which he received an Academy Award nomination) to 
a hunter being tracked down by bloodthirsty African tribesmen in "The Naked 
Prey," which he also directed, was 74. 
</P>
<P>
Wilde, who was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on Sept. 2 suffering 
from leukemia, died shortly after midnight, said hospital spokeswoman Paula 
Correia. His son, Cornel Wilde Jr., and daughter, Wendy, were at his side. 
</P>
<P>
During his long and varied career, which spanned the years 1940 to 1987, the 
aristocratic actor, writer and director was involved in more than 50 movies. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized long ago that I could not depend on luck to bring me success," 
Wilde once said. "I worked hard, extra hard to improve my chance by increasing 
my abilities and my experience. It was my goal to accomplish, in my life, 
something of value and to do it with self-respect and integrity." 
</P>
<P>
He made one of the first films ever dealing with environmental pollution ("No 
Blade of Grass" in 1970) and portrayed Revolutionary War spies, Omar Khayam, 
Constantine the Great, Robin Hood's son and aesthetic protagonists ranging from 
the consumptive Chopin to the eccentric Lord Byron. 
</P>
<P>
He moved from studio to studio in quest of satisfying roles and from in front 
of the camera to behind it when he couldn't find producers and directors who 
agreed with his point of view. 
</P>
<P>
"Acting is not just 'another day, another dollar,' " he told columnist Hedda 
Hopper as long ago as 1954. "If I hate a script or think it's foolish or in bad 
taste, I'm miserable." 
</P>
<P>
A linguist with a command of Hungarian, French, German, Italian and Russian, he 
was born in New York City to Hungarian-Czech parents but spent much of his 
formative years in Europe, where he became interested in fencing. 
</P>
<P>
After his Hungarian father, who traveled Europe for a cosmetics firm, finally 
settled in the United States in 1932, Cornelius Louis Wilde studied at City 
College of New York, intending to become a physician. In 1935, he won a 
scholarship to Columbia University, where he hoped to study surgery but instead 
abandoned his classes after appearances in several stock theater companies 
whetted his interest in things dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
He also gave up his membership on the U.S. fencing team that was headed to the 
1936 Berlin Olympics; yet it was his skill with a foil that would eventually 
lead him to Broadway and then to motion pictures. 
</P>
<P>
After several modest stage productions in New York and on the road, he was 
hired as a fencing instructor and featured player (Tybalt) in the Laurence 
Olivier-Vivien Leigh stage production of "Romeo and Juliet." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the stars' movie commitments, some of the play's rehearsals were 
held in Hollywood and Wilde was offered, and accepted, a Warner Bros. contract. 
Originally he was cast as a heavy or lead in B pictures, but his dark good 
looks and a change in studios (to 20th Century Fox) earned him feature parts in 
such pictures as "Lady With Red Hair" in 1940 and "High Sierra," in 1941, where 
he played an apprentice hoodlum to Humphrey Bogart. 
</P>
<P>
But it was as Chopin opposite Merle Oberon as George Sand that Wilde broke out 
of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
"When 'A Song to Remember' came along (1944), I begged for a test," he told 
Hopper. "The powers that be wouldn't consider it. 'You're too healthy' (to play 
a tubercular musician)." 
</P>
<P>
Finally after three months of testing what Wilde described as "every other 
actor" in town, he was given the role and received an Oscar nomination. (One 
critic later said he grew paler and wanner with each reel while fingering an 
impressive sound track on a mute piano. The pianist off screen was Jose 
Iturbi.) 
</P>
<P>
But the success proved a Pyrrhic victory, for afterward producers came to 
consider him fit only for costume dramas. 
</P>
<P>
He stayed in costume for "The Bandit of Sherwood Forest" and "Forever Amber," 
appeared in such melodramas as "Roadhouse," and "The Walls of Jericho" and then 
made the Big Top classic "The Greatest Show on Earth" for Cecil B. Demille in 
1952. 
</P>
<P>
But the roles had taken on what seemed to Wilde to be a certain unsettling 
sameness, and he abandoned what was at the time a $150,000-a-picture career to 
become a writer-producer-director. 
</P>
<P>
He formed, with his second wife actress Jean Wallace (they had performed 
together in "Star of India"), Theodora Productions, and in they 1955 produced 
"Storm Fear." The other pictures he starred in, produced or directed included 
"The Big Combo," "The Devil's Hairpin," "Maracaibo," "Sword of Lancelot," 
"Beach Red" and "The Naked Prey," in which he spent most of the 94-minute film 
wearing a loincloth and brandishing a spear as savages pursued him as they 
would a lion. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the plot's naivete, it was nominated for an Oscar for its script. 
</P>
<P>
It was filmed in South Africa while many other of the Theodora films were also 
made overseas on limited budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Those independent efforts produced mixed reactions. "The Big Combo" (1955), a 
melodrama about syndicated crime that included some torture scenes, was 
criticized at the time for being too violent. 
</P>
<P>
"Beach Red," about an American landing on a Japanese-held island during World 
War II, was also criticized for violence and supposed degradation of women. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get away from violence in drama," was his reply. "If you do not have 
conflict, you do not have drama. If a brutal scene is shown for no reason 
except to shock, then it is bad." 
</P>
<P>
On television, the seemingly ageless actor was featured in "Gargoyles" in 1972 
and then went back to directing and/or writing for "Shark's Treasure" and "The 
Fifth Musketeer." 
</P>
<P>
At his death he was editing his autobiography, "My Very Wilde Life," and was 
working on a sequel to "The Naked Prey." 
</P>
<P>
Wilde's first wife was actress Patricia Knight, whom he married in 1938. They 
had a daughter and were divorced in 1951, and that same year he married 
Wallace. They had a son and were divorced in 1980. Wilde is also survived by 
two stepsons from Wallace's marriage to the late Franchot Tone. 
</P>
<P>
His children, who are planning a private memorial service, ask contributions in 
their father's name to the American Cancer Society.

VAN DE KAMP PONDERS POLITICAL 'SWAMP'; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGNS: THE CANDIDATE'S INITIATIVE PROMISES TO DRAIN IT, BUT HIS OPPONENTS 
SUGGEST HE MAY ALREADY HAVE WET FEET.

<TEXT>
<P>
For John K. Van de Kamp, Democratic candidate for governor, California attorney 
general and veteran politician, it was a question of the ticklish kind. But not 
necessarily the trivial kind. 
</P>
<P>
Here he was, in front of the massed Capitol press corps on Monday, denouncing 
special interest money as having made a moral "swamp" of state government. Here 
he was, offering the final draft of his bold ballot initiative proposal to 
"drain the swamp" with 64 pages of new laws -- limiting campaign spending, 
offering taxpayer financing for candidates, restricting their terms in office 
and imposing a broad code of ethics on elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The quest for campaign money never stops. Those who do not play the game are 
very quickly overwhelmed by those who do. So the rule becomes play or die. And 
everybody plays," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But, then, what of Van de Kamp? What special treatment has he given to special 
interests during his career in politics? After all, for seven years as state 
attorney general and seven before that as Los Angeles County district attorney, 
Van de Kamp has proven an accomplished fund-raiser, with broad support in the 
very special-interest community he blames for strangling government through 
semi-legal corruption. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it can be said that those who have contributed in the past have often 
asked to come in and talk. Frankly, I see them," Van de Kamp replied, as if, 
yes, special interests had received special treatment. Most politicians grant 
that money does buy access, not more. 
</P>
<P>
But then Van de Kamp added quickly, "At the same time, I would see anyone who 
called in and made a special request to talk, even my opponents. That's just 
the way I behave. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think my decisions have been influenced by those (special interest) 
groups," he added. 
</P>
<P>
As for others, though, he was not so kind: "By all accounts the worse abuses 
occur in soliciting campaign contributions. Yet our laws in that area are so 
weak that only the very dumb or the very careless are ever caught violating 
them." 
</P>
<P>
The question of righteousness, in one form or another, is bound to follow Van 
de Kamp in the upcoming 1990 campaign for governor. His sponsorship of this 
ballot proposal, titled "The Clean Government Initiative," was from its 
conception an effort to reshape his image as a crusading political outsider 
rather than status quo insider. And it has spawned powerful enemies as well as 
eager allies along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Both of his major opponents in the 1990 campaign zeroed in on the question 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign of Republican candidate and U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson drew attention 
to several positions Van de Kamp has taken over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"For the last seven years John Van de Kamp has lifted nary a finger for the 
legislative program for the California district attorneys. Instead I think you 
will find he has been exceptionally close to the California trial lawyers, who 
are on the other side," said Wilson aide Otto Bos. 
</P>
<P>
Also cited by Bos was Van de Kamp's lead role in opposing a ballot measure in 
1986 to limit tort claims in personal injury cases, a measure strongly opposed 
by trial lawyers. In 1982, Van de Kamp also was one of only two district 
attorneys to oppose an anti-crime ballot proposition called the Victims' Bill 
of Rights. Again, he was on the side of trial lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't heard a peep from John Van de Kamp on this issue of ethics. . . . 
Only now that it's politically expedient does he posture as Mr. Outsider while 
all along he has happily been partaking as Mr. Insider. I think frankly the 
public is not going to buy that," said Bos. 
</P>
<P>
From Democrat Dianne Feinstein, former mayor of San Francisco and also a 
candidate, came similar criticism. "Here's Mr. Insider trying to reposition 
himself as Mr. Outsider. Remember, as chief law enforcement officer for 
California he is the one responsible for rooting out corruption in California. 
And he hasn't done it." 
</P>
<P>
The major elements of Van de Kamp's proposal were outlined at an earlier series 
of press conferences. His appearances Monday in Sacramento and San Jose were to 
divulge the precise language of the complicated ballot measure -- and to see 
how much more news attention he could draw with the issue. This initiative is 
one of three that form the major planks of Van de Kamp's campaign platform -- 
the others dealing with environmental protection and criminal justice. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the passage of time between first announcement of the measure and 
Monday's press conferences gave opponents time to sharpen their attack. 
</P>
<P>
From the Legislature, Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra bored 
in on what may be the measure's biggest soft spot: partial public financing of 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to open the state treasury and provide tens of millions of 
dollars to politicians running for office," Johnson said through a spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
One goal set by Van de Kamp, and his ally in the effort, the activist group 
Common Cause, was to limit overall campaign spending for all state offices. The 
Supreme Court has held that the only effective way to limit spending is to 
offer candidates taxpayer funding. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, candidates for the Assembly could spend up to $250,000 in the 
primary and $400,000 in the general election. For the state Senate, $425,000 
and $700,000. Statewide offices, such as attorney general and insurance 
commissioner, $1.5 million and $2.4 million. For governor, $4.5 million and 
$7.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates who agree to such limits would receive some of their total allotment 
direct from the treasury. To try and ease the sting of the idea, Van de Kamp 
proposed allowing citizens to designate on their income tax forms whether they 
want $5 of their taxes to be used to help finance these campaigns. The total 
cost to the treasury was estimated at $15 million. If citizens did not cover 
the bills with check-offs, Van de Kamp acknowledged, "we may have to go to the 
general fund." 
</P>
<P>
All kinds of politicians have previously reacted unhappily to a third major 
element of the proposal: A limit of two four-year terms for governor and other 
statewide offices and 12 years for a seat in the Legislature. Van de Kamp noted 
with a smile that he has lived up to the spirit of his reform by never trying 
to hold an office longer than his proposal would permit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Valid signatures of 595,484 registered voters will have to be collected in the 
next five months to qualify this proposed amendment to the state Constitution 
for a spot on the November, 1988, ballot. A rule of thumb is that from 800,000 
to 1 million raw signatures will be needed to assure enough valid ones.

FAULTY BRAKES ON FLIPPED BUS REPORTED; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: THE OWNER OF THE VEHICLE THAT TURNED OVER IN LAS VEGAS, INJURING 41 
PEOPLE, DISPUTES THE FINDINGS. 
</P>

<P>
A Los Angeles-based tour bus that flipped on its side on an interstate highway 
in Las Vegas last Saturday had faulty brakes, the Nevada Highway Patrol said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The bus owner disputed the finding, saying there was nothing mechanically wrong 
with the vehicle and that it had passed recent inspections in California. 
</P>
<P>
Forty passengers and a tour operator were injured in the accident, several 
suffering broken or separated limbs. One passenger, Esparanza Villa Vicencio, 
40, of Oxnard, remained hospitalized Monday in Las Vegas with a broken pelvis. 
</P>
<P>
Highway Patrol spokesman Phillip Dart said the brake problem was discovered 
when officers conducted a safety inspection of the impounded bus. 
</P>
<P>
"The brakes on one of the three axles were not properly adjusted," said Dart. 
"That means that for the whole bus, the braking capacity could have been 
reduced by one-third to one-half." 
</P>
<P>
Dart said the defect "may or may not have contributed" to the accident, which 
is still under investigation. But Dart added that if the 1974 MCI vehicle had 
been pulled over by the Nevada Highway Patrol for an inspection before the 
accident "it would have been placed out of service." 
</P>
<P>
Bus driver Jose Luis Figueroa Arceo, 49, of Los Angeles told authorities that 
his bus skidded out of control on rain-slick Interstate 15 when a car cut in 
front of it and he attempted to swerve out of the way. The bus, owned by 
Scorpio Tours of Los Angeles, had just arrived in Las Vegas with a load of 
weekend gamblers from East Los Angeles, Oxnard and Santa Barbara. Each had paid 
$10 to $45 for the overnight tour package, including accommodations at the 
Thunderbird Hotel and Casino. 
</P>
<P>
Dart said a preliminary investigation showed that Arceo may have committed two 
infractions during the trip -- driving more than 15 hours in a day without an 
eight-hour break and making false entries in his log book. When authorities 
inspected the crippled bus, Dart said, they found that the driver had already 
completed his log for the entire trip. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Bretado, owner of the 7-month-old, one-bus firm, quarreled Monday with the 
initial findings of Nevada authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing wrong with the bus, nothing," Bretado said. "The bus was 
inspected about 30 days ago. . . . It had new tires and everything. There's 
nothing wrong with it." 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol officials said Monday that the bus, which the 
fledgling firm purchased earlier this year, had indeed passed its most recent 
state safety inspection in August. The bus was due to be inspected again this 
month, according to CHP motor carrier specialist John Leighton. 
</P>
<P>
The tour bus company also had proper state Public Utilities Commission and 
federal Interstate Commerce Commission permits to operate interstate and 
intrastate tours, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Arceo, according to the California Department of Motor Vehicles, has a valid 
tour bus driver's license. But he had received four traffic tickets in the last 
2 1/2 years, including two for speeding and one for driving too slowly. His 
most recent ticket, in May, was for carrying a soft-drink cooler in the front 
of the tour bus rather than in the luggage compartment, Bretado said. 
</P>
<P>
"The driver has a clean record, a pretty good record," said Bretado, adding 
that Arceo, who was not injured in the collision, quit his previous job because 
"the company . . . pushed him to go fast, fast, fast." 
</P>
<P>
State PUC officials said Monday that Scorpio received a charter party permit 
last month, allowing it to transport passengers within California, after 
meeting requirements including the proper licensing of its driver. Requirements 
for the state permit also include a CHP safety inspection of the bus and proof 
that the firm has $5 million in accident insurance coverage.

ON CALIFORNIA: FORGET SIGNS -- WHAT'S YOUR AREA CODE? 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a building in Pasadena where they make new area codes for Southern 
California. If you call directory assistance, the operator will not admit this 
building exists. Its number is unlisted. But somewhere in the dungeons of this 
Pac Bell office, right now, a new area code is being planned for L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of L.A., of course. Just certain parts. Once again, the city has 
outgrown 213 and some neighborhoods must be marked for exile to a new number, a 
new identity. Eventually, in the next three or four years, a visitation will 
take place in the dark of night. Whole blocks, small cities, will be taken 
away, never to see 213 again. 
</P>
<P>
This is not happy news, I know, and thus far the phone company has kept it 
secret. Those of you who survived the 818 split in 1984 probably thought you 
were safe. Well, you are not. This thing could hit anyplace, snatch anyone's 
213. It won't be pretty. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't understand the repercussions, think of it this way: there are only 
three area codes that mean anything in this country. They are 212 in Manhattan, 
202 in Washington, D.C., and our own 213. Everyday, from dawn to midnight, 212 
gets on the horn to 213 and vice versa. In turn, both 212 and 213 light up the 
fiber-optics to 202. These three form the supreme troika of codes; they run the 
country, and you're either in this troika or you're out. Soon, a big chunk of 
L.A. is going to be out. 
</P>
<P>
And who's to blame for this new split? Not Pac Bell, as tempting as that might 
be. No, it's us. It's the auto phoners, the faxers, the modem users, the 
multiliners. We are eating up phone numbers so fast that even the 818 break-off 
did not suffice. So we must make a sacrifice to our phone greed, a sacrifice of 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
And the issue, of course, is which neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Take a look at a map of 213 and you will see how hard the choice will be. 
Compared to this, the 818 thing was easy. With 818, Pac Bell simply ran the 
boundary down the ridgeline of the Hollywood Hills. Everyone to the north was 
out. There was such a logic to it that the whining of the 818'ers was 
fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
This time, there's no geography to use. That means the company has to make its 
decision on cultural grounds. Should the Westside be lopped off? Just picture 
the wailing. Or should downtown become the cultural amputee, cut off from its 
telephonic roots? 
</P>
<P>
In truth, Pac Bell could go after the smaller players, like East L.A. or 
South-Central. There's one major problem with this strategy: it would leave the 
company vulnerable to the charge that Latinos and blacks had been gerrymandered 
out of the code, leaving 213 to the rich whites. As I say, this could get ugly. 
</P>
<P>
And there's the matter of the new number itself. This country has been gobbling 
area codes so fast that only a few remain available. The phone company won't 
reveal these numbers, but that's OK. We've made our own calculations, based on 
the arcane rules of area code formation. The list of possibilities looks pretty 
much like this: 310, 410, 903, 909, 910. 
</P>
<P>
In my mind, there's only one choice. The numbers ending in 10 are entirely too 
friendly for L.A. They're codes for the suburbs. And 903 is nowhere, a nebbish. 
That leaves 909, a great code. Nine-Oh-Nine has dark power, it's a sort of 
Darth Vader number. Nine-Oh-Nine could carry on the struggle with New York. 
</P>
<P>
All of which leads me to my modest proposal. As we know, show biz has always 
existed as a separate community in L.A., a world that's hidden and unavailable 
to the minions. Swell. Let's recognize that, draw a circle around the show biz 
neighborhoods and give them this new power code, 909. Then the rest of the 
city, with the old 213, could disengage and go its own way. 
</P>
<P>
Think of it. Outside the perimeter of 909, real people would matter once again. 
Historians, plumbers and algebra teachers could get reservations at 
restaurants. When someone slapped a cop, they'd just go to court and take their 
medicine with no fuss. Newspapers, spared the celebrity fever, would have more 
space to print stories about lost dogs. 
</P>
<P>
As for the new 909'ers, they would hate it at first but soon adjust. Here would 
be a universe all their own, uncluttered by the rest of us. Only the trade 
papers would be circulated, no need to read other news. Only white limos would 
purr down the streets. 
</P>
<P>
So consider carefully, Pac Bell. This plan has possibilities and, after all, 
someone has to get the ax. Brood on it.

SALVADOR OUTLINES PLAN TO END WAR; 
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL AMERICA: BUT MARXIST REBELS, OFFERED FEW OF THE CHANGES OR RIGHTS 
GUARANTEES THEY SEEK, BELITTLED THE OFFER.

<TEXT>
<P>
El Salvador's new government outlined a plan Monday to end nearly 10 years of 
guerrilla war but offered Marxist rebels few of the political changes or human 
rights guarantees they seek in return for laying down their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In its first peace proposal since taking office June 1, the right-wing 
government of President Alfredo Cristiani called for a cessation of hostilities 
within two days and the return of the guerrillas to civilian life by Jan. 15 
under international supervision. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, made here in peace talks with the guerrillas, addressed two rebel 
demands. It offered a multi-party "review" of electoral laws and measures to 
"perfect" the justice system. The rebels want a new Supreme Court, a new 
attorney general and early legislative elections, before their scheduled March 
1991 date. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrilla leaders quickly belittled the plan, saying it ignored entirely their 
demands for investigations of right-wing death squad murders, a purge of 
anti-democratic elements from the armed forces and specific steps to punish 
military officers who abuse human rights. It also rejected any negotiations 
over the size of a peacetime army. 
</P>
<P>
The government offered instead to set up a joint commission with the rebels to 
oversee the disarmament process and "protect the life and the physical and 
moral integrity" of former rebels. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the proposed accord would be supervised by delegates of the United 
Nations, Organization of American States and the Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a serious, responsible proposal that seeks a global solution to the 
conflict," said Oscar Alfredo Santamaria, the Salvadoran justice minister, 
during an evening break on the first of two scheduled days of talks. "It 
deserves a serious response." 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, the chief rebel negotiator, Joaquin Villalobos, faced reporters 
and branded the proposal "absurd, illogical and inflexible." 
</P>
<P>
"It is a plan that asks us to make an unconditional surrender and accept the 
country as it is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, talks on the proposal, and a rebel peace plan made last month, resumed 
late Monday evening. Rebel negotiators said it was expected that the two sides' 
opening positions would be far apart and expressed guarded hope for closing the 
gap. 
</P>
<P>
The Cristiani government and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front met 
for the first time Sept. 13-15 in Mexico City and agreed to try to end the 
fighting "by political means in the shortest time possible" through monthly 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
This first round of substantive talks at the suburban monastery of the Roman 
Catholic Clarist Sisters. was mediated by Catholic leaders from El Salvador and 
witnessed by U.N. and OAS representatives. 
</P>
<P>
In a sign of the pressure on both sides to end the war, Costa Rican President 
Oscar Arias Sanchez met separately with each, then challenged them publicly to 
"bury the past." 
</P>
<P>
"Seven million Salvadorans have turned their eyes toward you, with optimism and 
faith," said the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize winner. "You do not want to leave here 
as accomplices of more war." 
</P>
<P>
The conflict has left at least 70,000 dead, most of them civilians killed by 
right-wing death squads. 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, the rebels have made prosecution of such violations the key 
condition for disarming. Their plan calls for a cease-fire by Nov. 15 in return 
for reforming the judiciary and the army to end rights abuses. The rebels would 
then disarm by Jan. 15 and turn into a political party. 
</P>
<P>
The government proposal calls for agreements on undefined "measures to 
strengthen respect for human rights." 
</P>
<P>
"The impunity of those who kill and torture has to end," said Villalobos. 
</P>
<P>
The onset of talks appears to have sharpened the conflict, adding to a climate 
of distrust. More than 70 combatants on both sides have been killed since the 
rebels ended an 11-day unilateral truce Sept. 23, after the government began 
arresting and beating leftist union leaders and other rebel supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Since taking office June 1, Cristiani has surprised his critics just by his 
willingness to talk. But opposition in the military and his right-wing 
Nationalist Republican Alliance appears has given the rebels the edge in a 
propaganda war. 
</P>
<P>
"We all want peace to come to our country right now," Cristiani said Sunday in 
a speech televised in El Salvador. "But 10 years of fratricidal conflict is 
difficult to solve. We do not want people to get frustrated if, perhaps, the 
talks do not move forward at the accelerated pace that the people demand."

BRITAIN ASKS ALLIES' AID ON HONG KONG PASSPORTS

David Wilson, the British governor of Hong Kong, suggested Monday that the 
United States and other countries grant passports to residents of Hong Kong to 
ease fears of what may happen when China takes over the colony in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's remarks, made during a visit in which he met with top U.S. 
officials, served notice that Britain hopes to enlist the help of Western 
allies to ensure Hong Kong's stability and prevent a massive "brain drain" of 
skilled professionals. 
</P>
<P>
"What Hong Kong really needs is assurances that will help people to stay," 
Wilson said in an appearance at the National Press Club in Washington. ". . . 
What people really want is an insurance policy." Granting passports to Hong 
Kong residents might provide such an insurance policy, Wilson indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Britain has said it could not absorb a huge exodus from the colony although it 
is willing to accept a limited number of residents. 
</P>
<P>
One proposal now before Congress would lift the five-year residency requirement 
for U.S. citizenship for Hong Kong residents. This move would enable them to 
become American citizens while still living and working in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed five years ago, Britain will return Hong Kong to 
Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The Chinese government promised it would preserve 
for another 50 years Hong Kong's capitalist system and some of the political 
freedoms that the colony's 5.5 million residents now enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
However, the agreement does not spell out exactly how much political autonomy 
the Hong Kong government will have after China takes over. Over five years, 
Chinese officials have made clear their opposition to having Hong Kong conduct 
direct elections to choose a chief executive and legislature largely 
independent of Chinese control. 
</P>
<P>
The political upheavals in China in May and June heightened fears that China 
will not keep the promises it made in the 1984 agreement or that it will 
interpret the pact in ways that undercut the current political and economic 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"The tragic events of last June shook confidence badly, and there's no point in 
pretending otherwise," Wilson said, referring to the crushing of pro-democracy 
demonstrations by Chinese troops. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hong Kong residents have been lining up outside the consulates of 
Western governments such as the United States, Canada and Australia, seeking a 
chance to emigrate. The Hong Kong government expects about 42,000 people to 
leave the colony this year -- a rate more than double that of the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Hong Kong authorities have been particularly upset by foreign 
companies that tried to recruit professionals and technicians away from the 
colony. 
</P>
<P>
"A significant number (of the people leaving Hong Kong) are young 
professionals," Wilson said. ". . . So, we have a problem."

DISSIDENT POSES A POLICY DILEMMA; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: WHAT TO DO WITH FANG LIZHI? CHINA'S BEST-KNOWN ADVOCATE OF DEMOCRACY 
REMAINS HOLED UP IN THE U.S. EMBASSY WHILE WASHINGTON AND BEIJING DEBATE HIS 
FATE.

<P>
Four months after he fled to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, Fang Lizhi, China's 
most prominent dissident, remains sequestered inside the compound, and U.S. 
officials concede that they are stymied in efforts to persuade the Chinese 
regime to let him go free. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decision to grant refuge to Fang has become a continuing but largely 
invisible source of contention between the Bush Administration and the Chinese 
government, which has branded Fang a "traitorous bandit" and accused him of 
"counterrevolutionary crimes." 
</P>
<P>
So sensitive is the continuing stalemate that the Administration acknowledges 
it is trying to say as little as possible in public about Fang's case, 
apparently in the hope of letting passions subside. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say boo about it," a senior Administration official said recently when 
asked about Fang. The Fang case has become so touchy at the State Department 
that "around here, we call it the F-word," another official said. 
</P>
<P>
Much more is at stake than Fang's personal freedom. The fledgling democracy 
movement of Chinese exiles and students in France and the United States has no 
single recognized leader, and Fang could well emerge as a powerful symbol and 
unifying force. Some U.S. analysts believe the Chinese are reluctant to work 
out a deal that could enable Fang to be politically active in the West. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not entertaining what appear to be obvious solutions," a U.S. 
official said, referring to proposals that Fang be transferred from the U.S. 
Embassy to some unspecified neutral country. "We're at an impasse." 
</P>
<P>
Fang is an astrophysicist sometimes known as "the Chinese Sakharov," after the 
Soviet dissident Andrei D. Sakharov. In recent years, he has become the 
best-known and most outspoken proponent of a more democratic political system 
in China. 
</P>
<P>
Last winter, when President Bush was in Beijing, Chinese security agents 
physically barred Fang from attending a banquet to which Bush had invited him. 
</P>
<P>
In June, three days after the Chinese People's Liberation Army seized Tian An 
Men Square from pro-democracy demonstrators, Fang and his wife, fearing arrest, 
took refuge in the U.S. Embassy. They have been there ever since. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials insist that Fang is not restless, that he is hard at work doing 
research in astrophysics. U.S. officials are said to be providing him with the 
books that he needs. 
</P>
<P>
Some Fang supporters have questioned the Administration's resolve. 
</P>
<P>
Princeton University scholar Perry Link, who befriended Fang while he was 
living in Beijing last year and took part in the talks leading to Fang's 
seeking refuge in the embassy, said recently that the Administration is not 
doing as much as it could to obtain Fang's release. 
</P>
<P>
"He is stuck there for a while, probably until (Chinese senior leader) Deng 
Xiaoping dies, or at least until the State Department bargains him loose, which 
I wish they were trying harder to do," Link said in a speech at the Woodrow 
Wilson Center in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
State Department officials reacted testily to Link's assertion. 
</P>
<P>
"Perry Link should mind his own business," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that although they would like to expedite Fang's release, 
they don't want to push too hard or seem too eager because doing so might 
strengthen the Chinese negotiating position. 
</P>
<P>
"They probably feel it is a monkey on our back, that there's more pressure on 
us to resolve this," one source said. "That's not true. . . . As long as he's 
there, he'll be an obstacle to improvement in our relations -- and a big one." 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration officials reject the argument that the Chinese leadership 
benefits from Fang's confinement. 
</P>
<P>
"While he's in there, he's a kind of martyr, a symbol of the pro-democracy 
movement," one official said. "The Chinese could remove that symbol by doing 
right by Fang." 
</P>
<P>
Last August, Yuan Mu, spokesman for the Chinese State Council, told Japanese 
reporters that although the Chinese government will not forcibly seize Fang 
from the embassy, it will not allow him to be moved to a neutral country. 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. officials have suggested another solution -- that the United States 
set Fang loose on Chinese soil if the regime will guarantee that he will not be 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
But it seems unlikely that China will accept such a deal any time soon. Chinese 
authorities last June issued a warrant for Fang's arrest, and he has been 
officially charged. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be impossible to settle this, given the current leadership struggle in 
China," one U.S. analyst said. "Any Chinese leader who suggested doing so would 
be sticking his neck out." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's reticence to talk about Fang contrasts with his often-repeated public 
support for Sakharov in the early 1980s, when the Soviet dissident was confined 
to Gorky and his wife, Yelena Bonner, was under house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, when Bonner was refused permission to travel to the West, then-Vice 
President George Bush told a NATO meeting: "It is hard for us to comprehend, 
let alone condone, a system where internal and external travel and 
communication are subject to such arbitrary state prohibition."

SCIENCE FICTION: AMERICAN EXPERTS CAST DOUBTS ON REPORTS OF ALIENS WITH RAY 
GUNS.

We hate to tell you this, Comrade Mukhortov, but those aliens you claim to have 
interviewed near Moscow probably weren't really from another planet. 
</P>
<P>
For Times readers who do not subscribe to Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Communist 
Party youth newspaper, Pavel Mukhortov was identified in Thursday's edition of 
the official Soviet publication as a reporter who had chatted with a few exotic 
aliens. The report is the latest in a series of stories published by the 
normally staid Soviet press claiming that weird creatures with shining eyes and 
ray guns had landed at various sites around Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet people have long been fascinated with the subject of 
extraterrestrials, but what makes the recent reports rather startling is that 
they have appeared in the official press in what seems to be a ratings war, a 
high-water mark for glasnost. Soviet Television has become so much more 
liberalized in recent months that one of the most popular television 
personalities in Moscow is a faith healer. 
</P>
<P>
But, party poopers that they are, American scientists have their doubts about 
aliens from space. 
</P>
<P>
Astronomer Carl Sagan, who is almost as well known in the Soviet Union as he is 
in the United States, would love to believe the stories are true because he has 
spent much of his adult life promoting programs to search the cosmos for other 
intelligent beings. 
</P>
<P>
"It would save me a lot of trouble if they were already here," Sagan said when 
told of the conversation Mukhortov claims to have had with the visitors. But he 
said the reports from Moscow are just a little too "weird" for his tastes. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, he said, such reports "would have been suppressed as not serious 
or unscientific, but now it is permitted to come out. So, suddenly, it just 
pops out." 
</P>
<P>
And popping out is just what the reports are doing these days all over the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
It began with a story in Tass, the official Soviet news agency, that claimed 
that schoolchildren had seen creatures with knobby little heads near the city 
of Voronezh. 
</P>
<P>
"Scientists have confirmed that an unidentified flying object recently landed 
in a park," the Tass report stated. "They have also identified the landing site 
and found traces of aliens who made a short promenade around the park." 
</P>
<P>
Not very likely, snapped Thomas McDonough, a Caltech professor who also would 
like to believe that aliens have indeed landed on Earth. As the coordinator of 
the "search for extraterrestrial intelligence" for the Pasadena-based Planetary 
Society -- and the author of a book by the same name -- McDonough does not rule 
out the possibility of interstellar travel, but not this time, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
And he figures that if aliens came all the way to Earth for a visit, they 
probably would want to do something other than stroll around a Soviet park. 
</P>
<P>
Even the noted science fiction writer Isaac Asimov, who said he thinks "there 
may be other intelligences in the universe," believes that other creatures 
probably would find something better to do with their time. 
</P>
<P>
"Here on Earth and doing the silly things people say they are doing?" Asimov 
asked with a note of incredulity. 
</P>
<P>
Asimov admitted that his novels sometimes go beyond the facts. For example, he 
has written of instances in which beings move through space faster than the 
speed of light -- although Albert Einstein said they couldn't -- "but that's 
science fiction." 
</P>
<P>
Still, you can't rule out space travel entirely, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asimov believes that mortals might some day leave Earth for another solar 
system, but they probably will travel in a spacecraft so large that it will 
become the permanent home for them and the generations they spawn. That's not 
the sort of saucer that could land unnoticed in a Soviet cornfield. 
</P>
<P>
McDonough, who speaks Russian, said tales of invasions from space have been 
featured for years in Soviet underground publications equivalent to the 
National Enquirer. The only difference now, he said, is the endorsement of the 
bizarre stories by the official press. 
</P>
<P>
Pravda, however, appears to be getting a little edgy about the story, 
indicating concern that the fantasy has gone too far. In an article Friday, 
Pravda warned that "clear and well-argued answers are required immediately. 
Otherwise, rumors of alien landings could suddenly spread all over the globe."

U.S. ACCUSED OF TRYING TO BUY ELECTION; 
</P>
<P>
NICARAGUA: THE ADMINISTRATION INSISTS THAT THE $9 MILLION IT SEEKS FOR THE 
OPPOSITION PARTY IS NEEDED TO OFFSET THE WELL-FINANCED SANDINISTAS.

<P>
President Bush's plan to pump $9 million into Nicaragua to assist the 
opposition party over the next four months is giving rise to charges that the 
United States wants to buy the Feb. 25 election in the Central American nation. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration officials have insisted that U.S. assistance is necessary 
because the well-financed Sandinista regime is making it virtually impossible 
for the impoverished National Opposition Union (UNO), led by presidential 
candidate Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, to communicate with Nicaraguan voters. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents of the Bush assistance package, including conservative Sen. Jesse 
Helms (R-N.C.) as well as many liberal Democrats, argue that $9 million far 
exceeds the sum needed to guarantee a fair election, especially in a country 
where the annual per capital income is about $300. 
</P>
<P>
The excess, according to these critics, is actually intended by the Bush 
Administration to be used as "walking around money" to buy votes for the 
opposition party in Nicaragua -- a tactic that they predict will backfire on 
Chamorro. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we really want Mrs. Chamorro to be known as the best candidate American 
money can buy?" asked Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), a leading critic of the 
proposal. "Do we really want free elections and fair elections in Nicaragua, or 
do we want an election bought and paid for by the United States government?" 
</P>
<P>
Despite intense criticism, there are indications that Bush's request will be 
approved by Congress this week -- a sign of just how weary the critics of U.S. 
policy have grown after nearly a decade of quarreling over aid to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
The irony of the debate is that the aid package has been opposed primarily by 
liberals, who have long advocated a policy of encouraging democratic elections 
in Nicaragua, and it has been supported mostly by conservatives, who previously 
sought a military solution to the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Also, many of the Republicans pressing for the President's request strongly 
oppose financing elections in the United States with federal money. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's proposed package, which was sent to Congress last month, 
calls for $5 million to fund "internal groups," understood to be UNO and its 
allied parties. The remaining money would be given to outside organizations to 
spend in the Nicaraguan election, including $4 million for the National 
Endowment for Democracy, an organization set up to foster democracy abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal has moved quickly through Congress, largely because the 
Administration argued that it was needed to assist in registration of voters 
during October. The House passed it Oct. 4. Nevertheless, officials said that 
the money is unlikely to reach Nicaragua before November, even if the Senate 
acts favorably on it this week. 
</P>
<P>
A supporter of the Administration's package, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), 
defended the proposal on grounds that the Sandinistas are "able to manipulate 
the electoral process far beyond the level that is tolerated in democratic 
societies." 
</P>
<P>
"They will offer food and jobs to the poor and starving victims of their 
chronic mismanagement of the Nicaraguan economy," he predicted. "They will 
threaten Nicaraguans supporting the opposition. They will continue to dominate 
the media and to permit the opposition extremely limited access to television." 
</P>
<P>
Even many critics agree with the President that the United States should 
provide some assistance to guarantee a fair election, but they are suspicious 
that UNO leaders will use some of it for outright vote buying or for lavish 
living. 
</P>
<P>
Harkin, recalling that former Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza was reputed 
to have bought votes for 30 cents each, said the proposed aid package -- 
combined with $3.5 million already spent by the United States in Nicaragua this 
year -- would amount to an expenditure of $5 per person in a country of 1.7 
million registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
He said it is the equivalent to spending $500 million for a campaign in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to buy an election," Harkin said, "it could be done cheaper than 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Harkin was particularly critical of a budget drawn up by UNO that proposed to 
spend $600,000 for 20,000 poll watchers, or $30 a day; $140,000 for invitations 
to international observers; $50,000 for UNO leaders to travel abroad; $815,000 
for salary and benefits of UNO leaders, and $1.3 million for automobiles, which 
he said could finance 2,241 rental cars at $20 a day, 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of nonsense are we talking about, $1,345,000 for vehicles?" he 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
Harkin and other liberals also maintain that the U.S. support will undermine 
Chamorro's campaign by allowing the Sandinistas to portray her as the 
hand-picked candidate of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Administration supporters emphasize that none of the money will be 
spent directly for UNO's campaign. Instead, it is designated for such 
activities as party building, voter registration, training of poll workers, 
election monitoring, get-out-the-vote drives and international observers.

FED, AS EXPECTED, INJECTS CASH INTO FINANCIAL SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE ACTION HELPS TO CONTAIN THE STOCK MARKET SLIDE AND IN THE PROCESS 
NUDGES INTEREST RATES DOWN SLIGHTLY.

<P>
The Federal Reserve Board, moving as promised, injected added cash into the 
nation's financial system early Monday, helping to contain the stock market 
slide that began Friday and, in the process, nudging interest rates down 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said that the Fed temporarily provided about $2 billion by buying 
securities from banks and brokerage houses with the usual understanding that 
the dealers would buy them back within a week. It acted at about 8:40 a.m. PDT, 
about two hours after the market opened and after stock prices had begun 
rebounding from a further decline in the early morning. 
</P>
<P>
Although the amount was not unusually large, analysts said its impact was 
heightened because the purchases came at a time when the Fed ordinarily would 
have sought to drain reserves from the banking system to offset seasonal 
transactions by the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed's action appeared to be just what the markets needed. "They promised 
they were going to provide liquidity, and they did," said James Capra, a bond 
trader at the Shearson Lehman Bros. investment firm in New York. Capra called 
the move "a measured response." 
</P>
<P>
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, in a speech to the American Bankers Assn. here, 
took a low-key approach to Friday's market plunge. 
</P>
<P>
"We at the Federal Reserve are watching developments in the financial markets 
very closely," he said. He added that "coordination exists at a detailed level" 
between the Fed, the Treasury Department and the agencies that regulate the 
financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed, as is its custom, did not announce its injection of cash into the 
financial system. But analysts were able to spot the Fed's tracks by tracing 
transactions in the markets. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing the Fed did was psychological -- that is, it 
reassured the market that the funds would be there," said Scott Pardee, a 
former Federal Reserve official who is now co-chairman of Yamaichi 
International America in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the timing of the Fed's intervention appeared to signal that the 
central bank was easing its money and credit policies slightly in its efforts 
to avert a panic following Friday's 190-point stock-market slide. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Fed began injecting reserves at a point when the federal 
funds rate -- the interest charged on overnight loans between banks -- had 
fallen to between 8.5% and 8.6%, down about one-quarter of a percentage point 
from Friday's level of 8.75% to 8.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Market specialists said the action suggested that the Fed will probably allow 
interest rates to remain at this new level and may even permit them to edge 
lower -- in effect, relaxing money and credit conditions marginally. 
</P>
<P>
Because the market seemed not to have panicked during the first few hours of 
trading Monday, traders said, the Fed apparently decided to tread lightly and 
keep some of its powder dry in case the slide resumed later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that stocks were trading on the firm side today made them feel they 
didn't have to come in very early or very fast," one analyst said. "They did 
not want to make it look like an emergency operation." 
</P>
<P>
Edward Guay, chief economist for Cigna Corp. in Hartford, Conn., a long-time 
observer of Federal Reserve actions, called the Fed's move on Monday "a gentle 
nudge toward an easier posture." 
</P>
<P>
Guay said the central bank apparently had come through on its promise over the 
weekend to inject cash into the financial system if it were needed to ward off 
another slide, "but they did not want it construed as a move toward an easing 
in monetary policy." 
</P>
<P>
While Fed policy-makers "want to maintain economic growth, they don't want a 
new spurt of inflation or a surge of speculation," Guay said. "All in all, it's 
a rather gentle move on their part." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Fed's performance stood in sharp contrast to that of 
Black Monday -- Oct. 19, 1987. Then the central bank did not act until Tuesday, 
the day after the 508-point crash and two trading days after a preliminary 
108-point decline. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts said later that the Fed's late entry then -- combined with 
conflicting signals that the central bank issued then concerning likely 
interest-rate changes -- resulted in a larger slide than might have otherwise 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, the Fed was in early, before the market had a chance to plummet 
500 points or more, and deftly, so as not to upset its long-standing goal of 
leaning against prevailing inflationary pressures in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
After the stock market closed with the Dow Jones industrial average up 88.12 
points, Roger Kubarych, manager of Henry Kaufman &amp; Co., a Wall Street 
consulting firm, said the Fed had turned in "a very balanced, good 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
But Kubarych noted that the bond market fell Monday and the currency market 
zig-zagged throughout the day. "There's going to be a lot of volatility in all 
these markets until people get their bearings," he said.

APPEALS COURT PERMITS SHUTTLE LAUNCHING TODAY

An appeals court Monday dismissed a last-ditch attempt by environmentalists to 
stop today's launching of the shuttle Atlantis, setting the stage for a flight 
to fire the nuclear-powered Galileo probe to Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
Eight anti-nuclear activists were arrested Monday in a symbolic protest at the 
Kennedy Space Center. But, with beefed-up security teams on guard against more 
serious infiltration attempts, Atlantis' countdown ticked smoothly toward 
blastoff at 9:57 a.m. PDT today, five days late because of work to replace a 
faulty main engine computer. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line . . . is that we think we have an excellent chance of getting 
airborne . . . ," NASA Administrator Richard H. Truly said. "The vehicle's in 
good shape; the crew's ready to go fly, and the weather looks like we'll have a 
good chance of getting airborne." 
</P>
<P>
Late Monday, technicians detected a problem with a "black box" that collects 
speed and other data for the shuttle's navigation system and worked to replace 
the cockpit device, but no delay in the launching was expected, NASA 
spokeswoman Lisa Malone said. 
</P>
<P>
Rocket crews rolled a giant rotating service gantry away from Atlantis, 
exposing the 4.5-million-pound spaceship to set the stage for fuel loading 
early today. 
</P>
<P>
Commander Donald Williams, 47, co-pilot Michael McCulley, 46, flight engineer 
Franklin Chang-Diaz, 39, Shannon Lucid, 46, and Ellen Baker, 36, plan to spend 
five days in orbit before landing at 12:42 p.m. PDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force 
Base, Calif. Lucid and Baker were scheduled to deploy the space probe from 
Atlantis's 60-foot payload bay. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.4-billion Galileo probe, the most sophisticated interplanetary craft 
ever built, has generated controversy because it is equipped with two atomic 
power packs loaded with 48 pounds of radioactive plutonium 238 dioxide. NASA 
contends that the power packs would survive a Challenger-class disaster and 
most other accidents intact. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-nuclear activists charge that Galileo is too risky to launch, that a cloud 
of deadly radiation could be released in a disaster. But a federal judge last 
week refused to block the flight, and an appeals court in Washington Monday 
agreed with that decision. 
</P>
<P>
At the Kennedy Space Center, eight demonstrators were arrested when they 
trespassed at a guard gate in a symbolic protest. NASA is spending an extra 
$100,000 to bolster security around the launching pad. But, although gun-toting 
NASA guards were prepared for more activity, organizers said that no one would 
try to infiltrate the launching zone today. 
</P>
<P>
"We're urging people not to be within 25 miles of the launch pad," said Bruce 
Gagnon of the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice.

</P>
<P>
Unlike the other six defendants, Steven Curreri, 18, was not charged with 
murder for the Aug. 23 killing of Yusuf Hawkins.

FAA PROBES HEALTH OF PILOT WHO CRASHED IN SEA

The Federal Aviation Administration said Monday that it is investigating 
whether Washington lawyer Thomas L. Root, who suffered a gunshot wound during a 
flight that ended when his small airplane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean July 
13, is physically competent to continue flying. 
</P>
<P>
"We have sent him a letter of investigation," said FAA spokesman Fred Farrar. 
"We're investigating to see if he still qualifies for an FAA medical 
certificate." 
</P>
<P>
But Farrar said that the FAA is bringing no charges against Root, who said he 
blacked out before the crash. "We have no regulations saying a pilot can't pass 
out," Farrar said. 
</P>
<P>
Root has said that he blacked out from a carbon monoxide leak in the plane and 
that he received his gunshot wound when his loose handgun went off in the 
cockpit as his plane crashed. Doctors later confirmed that carbon monoxide was 
found in his lungs. 
</P>
<P>
There was no evidence of a shooting in tapes released by the FAA Monday of 
conversations between Root, who was alone in the plane, and air traffic 
controllers. Farrar refused to respond to suggestions that Root's wound was 
self-inflicted.

The flight of Root's Cessna 210 Centurion originated at Washington's National 
Airport and was destined for Rocky Mount, N.C. But an hour into the flight, 
Root radioed controllers that he was feeling ill. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm having a little problem up here," Root said in the tapes. " . . . Having a 
little trouble breathing. . . . How far am I to Rocky Mount?" 
</P>
<P>
"You are about 17 minutes from Rocky Mount," the tower replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Ah, ah, one three," Root said before ending the transmission. The numbers Root 
mentioned were the first two digits of his plane's identification code. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty minutes later, an Army aircraft flying alongside Root's plane reported: 
"The pilot is slumped over." Two Marine F-14 fighters intercepted Root's 
aircraft 15 minutes later near Norfolk, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Root apparently had activated the automatic pilot to maintain an altitude of 
10,000 feet before losing consciousness. The aircraft continued out to sea and, 
half an hour later, ran out of fuel and plunged into the Atlantic near the 
Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
One of Root's clients, Sonrise Management Services, filed a $584,600 lawsuit 
against him six days after the crash, alleging that Root did not perform 
contracted legal services, misused funds and double-billed Sonrise for services 
rendered. 
</P>
<P>
Sonrise, based in Columbus, Ga., manages small FM radio stations across the 
country, including 16 in California. Root, who lives in Arlington, Va., has 
since filed for bankruptcy to protect his law firm.

ROUND 2 OF SALVADOR TALKS OPENS; 
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL AMERICA: THE PRESIDENT OF HOST COSTA RICA CALLS ON THE COMBATANTS TO 
'RECTIFY THE HISTORY OF 10 YEARS OF WAR.'

<TEXT>
<P>
Government and rebel negotiators from El Salvador opened a new round of peace 
talks here Monday after hearing a plea by Costa Rica's president to "rectify 
the history of 10 years of war in your country." 
</P>
<P>
"Seven million Salvadorans have turned their eyes toward you, with optimism and 
faith," President Oscar Arias Sanchez told the negotiators in a public 
ceremony. "You have an obligation to bury the past, because you do not want to 
leave here as accomplices of more war." 
</P>
<P>
The stern appeal by the Costa Rican leader, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize 
for his campaign to pacify Central America, dramatized the pressure on both 
sides to end a war that has cost 70,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
El Salvador's new rightist government and the Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front met for the first time Sept. 13-15 in Mexico City and agreed 
to try to end the fighting "by political means in the shortest time possible" 
through monthly negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
This first round of substantive talks, in a suburban Roman Catholic monastery, 
centered on a rebel peace plan unveiled during last month's meeting and a 
government counterproposal offered Monday. Catholic leaders from El Salvador 
mediated the talks, and representatives of the United Nations and Organization 
of American States attended as witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
The rebel plan calls for a cease-fire by Nov. 15 in return for reforming the 
judiciary and the army to combat human rights abuses, as well as moving the 
1991 election of a national legislature to a date in 1990. It envisions an end 
to the conflict by Jan. 31, with the transformation of the guerrilla movement 
into a political party and a sharp reduction of the 55,000-man armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the government counteroffer have not been made public. But its 
central point, announced by Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani to the U.N. 
General Assembly on Oct. 2, is that all fighting must cease before serious 
talks can proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Arias appeared to endorse that idea Monday when he told negotiators they "have 
a lot to learn" from the two-year-old peace process in Nicaragua. There, an 
informal truce between the Sandinista government and U.S.-backed Contras took 
hold in March, 1988, at the start of high-level peace talks, and still holds 
despite the lack of a final armistice. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving here for the scheduled two-day session, Salvadoran guerrilla leaders 
ridiculed any comparison with the Nicaraguan rebels, who are apparently more 
dependent on foreign support, and rejected the idea of an unconditional 
cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
They also expanded their own proposal by calling for creation of a powerful 
human rights body representing "all political and social forces," including the 
rebel front. The new body, working under U.N. and OAS supervision, would have 
access to army and police jails. 
</P>
<P>
Such safeguards, the rebels insist, are needed to halt the practice of 
arbitrary arrests, torture and murder by government forces and right-wing death 
squads and to ensure a climate of peace. 
</P>
<P>
"The impunity of those who kill and torture has to end," said Joaquin 
Villalobos, the rebels' chief military strategist. "It is impossible to base (a 
settlement) on so simplistic a concept as a ceasing of hostilities if everybody 
just keeps shooting as they please." 
</P>
<P>
Villalobos said the new demands are a response to a recent government crackdown 
on the rebels' civilian supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the onset of peace talks appears to have sharpened the conflict. More 
than 70 combatants on both sides have been killed in intense fighting since the 
guerrillas ended an 11-day unilateral cease-fire Sept. 23, after the government 
began arresting and beating leftist union leaders and other rebel supporters. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the talks, army troops used tear gas to break up a peace vigil by 
100 leftists in a Catholic church in San Salvador. The same day, the Salvadoran 
air force commander, Gen. Juan Rafael Bustillo, made a fight-to-the-finish 
speech that likened the guerrilla alliance to a wounded bull. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wounded, it's dying," he said. "But we must not turn our backs, because 
that's how great bullfighters die." 
</P>
<P>
Since taking office June 1, Cristiani has surprised his critics just by his 
willingness to talk. But opposition in the military and his right-wing 
Nationalist Republican Alliance has given the rebels the edge in the propaganda 
war. 
</P>
<P>
"We all want peace to come to our country right now," Cristiani said Sunday in 
a speech televised in El Salvador. "But 10 years of fratricidal conflict is 
difficult to solve. We do not want people to get frustrated if, perhaps, the 
talks do not move forward at the accelerated pace that the people demand."

JUST JOKING, NOT DROWNING, YELTSIN SAYS

Interior Minister Vadim V. Bakatin told the Supreme Soviet on Monday that an 
investigation has been made into a purported attempt to drown maverick 
Communist Boris N. Yeltsin, but Yeltsin said on state TV that it was all a 
joke. 
</P>
<P>
Bakatin told the lawmakers that Yeltsin had reported to a policeman that a car 
overtook him, and unknown persons made him get into their car, pulled a bag 
over his head and, on reaching a bridge across the Moscow River, threw him in 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeltsin said he managed to reach the bank, rested to regain his breath and 
then turned to the militia (police). However, he asked the militia people not 
to let anyone know what had happened," according to an account by the Tass news 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
Bakatin said that legal action was started to establish the circumstances 
behind the statement made by Yeltsin, since it referred to a criminal case 
involving an attempt on a person's life. Yeltsin's account "could not be 
confirmed," Bakatin said. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told Bakatin on Sept. 30, two days after the alleged incident, that the 
policeman misunderstood a joke. On Monday, he had to tell the Supreme Soviet 
and the entire nation.

YOUTH SHOT -- AND DEATH LIST GROWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There's a different sort of roster at George Washington Preparatory High School 
on West 110th Street -- a list containing more than 500 names of students, 
former students and their friends and relatives who have died violently in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, they prepared to add another name. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that about 12:10 p.m., a lone gunman -- probably a gang member 
-- drove by in a car and shot 17-year-old student Fernando Avalos to death as 
he stood on the sidewalk outside the school in the unincorporated Athens area 
west of Watts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just another drive-by shooting," Reesheyma Acrey, 17, a fellow student, 
said with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Soriano, 17, a student and friend of the dead youth, said Avalos had 
been involved in a fight with members of a new street gang in the area last 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"They came to get back at him," Soriano said. "You're walking with him one day, 
and the next day he's dead." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to stop," said another student, who declined to give his name. 
"His friends know who did it." 
</P>
<P>
Washington Prep gained national attention in 1986 when a television movie aired 
on its former principal, George McKenna, who is now Inglewood's superintendent 
of schools. 
</P>
<P>
Current Principal Larry B. Higgins said Avalos, a senior who transferred to the 
high school last month, had not attended classes for more than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
According to Eddie Rodriguez, a 16-year-old sophomore, Avalos had stopped by 
the school on Monday to "talk to some girls. He was just kicking back when . . 
. a car came by and started blasting." 
</P>
<P>
A lone gunman in the car shouted out the name of a local gang before firing 
once at Avalos, who was standing with a group of friends just outside the 
schoolyard fence, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Van Mosley said. No one 
else was injured in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The witnesses said the car sped away after the shooting, and sheriff's homicide 
investigators said no suspects were in custody. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins, in an announcement over the school's public address system, noted that 
Avalos was standing outside the school grounds when the attack took place. He 
told students that the shooting was "a message that your safety is at risk if 
you are not on campus during school hours." 
</P>
<P>
The principal said the roster, displayed in a glass case in the lobby at the 
entrance of the school, was posted there to draw attention to the violence that 
is sweeping through the community. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like our own Vietnam Memorial," Higgins said.

COUNTY NURSES ACCEPT PACT THAT NEARS GOAL OF 'PARITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR and RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County nurses late Monday approved by a 3 to 2 margin a tentative 
contract that includes a 17.25% pay raise over two years -- and a promise by 
county officials to study increased security at hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to move the nurses working for the county health care network 
closer to parity with the private sector," said Steve Weingarten, a spokesman 
for Local 660 of Service Employees International Union, which represents the 
nurses. "The nurses have agreed that this is a competitive package." 
</P>
<P>
The nurses, who staff six county-run hospitals and 47 neighborhood clinics, had 
been seeking a 22% increase over two years. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed agreement must still be ratified by the county Board of 
Supervisors. After results of the voting were announced, Supervisor Deane Dana 
said he was confident the board would approve the contract. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful news," he said of the vote. "I congratulate the county staff 
and the nurses for pulling it together." 
</P>
<P>
The county promised to study proposed new security measures, such as trams, to 
take nurses to and from parking lots. In addition, the county will study 
installing a barrier to separate the emergency room from public waiting areas 
at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center in Watts. The hospital was 
singled out for increased security because of gang shootings in the 
neighborhood, a county official said. 
</P>
<P>
County nurses, who currently earn between $2,600 and $3,000 a month, claimed 
they make less money than nurses working at private hospitals. The tentative 
contract will increase nurses' top salary to $3,337 by July 1, 1991, Weingarten 
said. A 10.5% raise will be retroactive to Oct. 1, followed by 1% increase on 
July 1, 1990, 3% on Oct. 1, 1990, and 2.75% on July 1, 1991, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached Wednesday, just five hours before the county's 5,126 
nurses were set to strike, and after Board of Supervisors Chairman Ed Edelman 
summoned both sides to his office in an 11th-hour effort to prevent a strike. 
</P>
<P>
The nurses voted on the new contract throughout the day Monday at 18 locations 
in the county. Only about half of the nurses are union members, although almost 
all will be affected by the new contract. 
</P>
<P>
County officials maintained during negotiations that in the event of a strike, 
they were prepared to seek a court order, as they did in 1988, directing the 
nurses to return to work.

AT 102, IT'S HIGH TIME TO TAKE THE OATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE McMILLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After nearly four decades in the United States, Kazimieras Bandzevicius decided 
he had enough time on his hands to become an American citizen. On Monday, he 
took the oath of allegiance -- at age 102. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service believe 
Bandzevicius, a native of Lithuania who immigrated to the United States in 
1950, is the oldest person ever naturalized in Los Angeles. But because of the 
way statistics are kept, officials say they do not know whether he is the 
oldest ever naturalized in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood resident grinned as he walked slowly down the halls of the U.S. 
District Courthouse in Los Angeles on Monday. One hand held a wooden cane and 
the other clung to the arm of his granddaughter, Olga Goodman of Beverly Hills. 
A small American flag stuck out of his vest pocket. 
</P>
<P>
He had just left the chambers of U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr., where 
he and a 10-year-old boy from the Philippines, John Michael Cruz Cortes, 
pledged to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Hatter administered the oath to them in chambers, ahead of the 34 others who 
later took the oath as a group in the courtroom because of the media attention 
shown Bandzevicius, court officials said. The boy, son of U.S. District Court 
Deputy Clerk Jose Cortes, was added to the private ceremony because he was the 
youngest in the group. 
</P>
<P>
"It's never too late to become a citizen of this great nation, and it's 
certainly never too soon," Hatter said as he congratulated both. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like a newly born little baby," Bandzevicius said in Russian, with 
Goodman translating. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel really good, and I'm planning to live a long time," added Bandzevicius, 
his gray hair framing a bald pate and his blue eyes shining behind thick-lensed 
glasses. 
</P>
<P>
Why had he waited so long to apply for citizenship? 
</P>
<P>
"I worked so hard it seemed like there was no time," he said. "Now there is 
time, and I want to help the Republican Party." 
</P>
<P>
After Bandzevicius came to America at age 63, he said, he worked as a machinist 
for various companies and did not retire until he was 92. "He wouldn't have 
retired then," Goodman said, "except that he had to have cataract surgery." 
</P>
<P>
Not long after that, his wife died, and he developed various circulatory 
ailments. After he had vascular surgery on one leg late last year, Goodman said 
he told her, " 'I want to die an American.' " 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, Kaye Evans, said he passed his oral and written examination April 
12, his 102nd birthday. 
</P>
<P>
For his family, which includes his two daughters, four grandchildren and one 
great-grandchild, the citizenship effort was the latest in a lifelong pattern 
of strength and determination, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
Bandzevicius was born in a family of 12 children in 1887 in rural Lithuania, 
then under the control of czarist Russia. He wanted to be a pharmacist, he 
said, because "in a rural town if you were a pharmacist you were a big person." 
</P>
<P>
But since his family did not have money for his education, he struck out on his 
own at age 13. Eventually he made his way to what was then called St. 
Petersburg, now Leningrad. There, he stayed with Roman Catholic priests, and 
through scholarships and tutoring jobs he eventually graduated -- with honors, 
Goodman said -- from the University of St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
But he never became a pharmacist because the Russian Revolution broke out and 
changed his life. A friend of his was executed by the Bolsheviks. Bandzevicius 
promised this friend, who was actually Goodman's grandfather, that he would 
care for the man's wife and children. He married the widow in 1920, adopted the 
children and took them to Lithuania, believing life would be safer for them 
there. 
</P>
<P>
There, he worked as both a banker and as a Buick car dealer. But in 1940 he 
moved the family to Germany, Goodman said, because of the impending Soviet 
occupation of Lithuania. In 1950 he moved to Chicago and then Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the freedom," Bandzevicius said when asked what he liked best about the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Bandzevicius, who lives in a two-story Hollywood house, still takes care of 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"He did his own taxes this year. He calls me up to tell me when he wants to 
move his money to another account for interest," Goodman said. But, she added, 
"the family cooks for him." 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted him to wear new clothes for today," Goodman said, looking at the 
outfit Bandzevicius had chosen for the day -- a jacket, tie, vest, trousers and 
shoes, all in brown, with white socks. "But he said, 'I'm an old man. I'll wear 
my old outfit.' "

POLICE ABSOLVE BORDER AGENTS IN BOY'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police have found no evidence of negligence in the death of a 
14-year-old Mexican boy run over by a U.S. Border Patrol vehicle in August, and 
authorities have no plans to prosecute the agent who was driving, federal and 
local officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The incident, which occurred just inside U.S. territory in San Diego early in 
the morning of Aug. 20, sparked considerable controversy -- and a call by the 
Mexican government for a thorough investigation -- after an attorney 
representing the dead boy's family alleged that the agent had been driving 
recklessly. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Border Patrol officials, who characterized the incident as an unfortunate 
but unavoidable accident, said immediately afterward that an initial inquiry 
had uncovered no evidence of wrongdoing by the driver, Agent George Brunner, 
29, or his partner, Agent Oscar Lomeli, 34. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, San Diego Police Cmdr. Cal Krosch said the official police 
investigation found no criminal negligence by the agents. "As far as we're 
concerned, it's a closed matter," Krosch said. 
</P>
<P>
James W. Brannigan, chief assistant U.S. attorney in San Diego, said U.S. 
authorities, who reviewed the police investigation because it involved federal 
officers, did not dispute the police findings. 
</P>
<P>
"The San Diego police concluded this was accidental," Brannigan said, "and we 
see no reason to take any further action at this point." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Mexican consul in San Diego declined comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Still to be litigated is a civil claim filed by the family of the dead boy, 
Luis Eduardo Hernandez, a native of the Mexican state of Jalisco. He and a 
15-year-old brother, Angel, were en route to Los Angeles, where their father, 
Aurelio Hernandez, resides, when the boy was run over at 2:30 a.m. Aug. 20. 
Luis Eduardo was buried 11 days later in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The family's attorney, Michael D. Padilla of San Diego, has maintained that the 
Border Patrol vehicle, a 1988 Chevrolet Blazer, was driving at excessive speed 
-- up to 50 m.p.h. -- when it ran over and killed the boy at a spot just north 
of the border fence and south of the Tijuana River channel. The boy was one of 
scores gathered that evening along the channel, which has become the most 
popular crossing spot for undocumented migrants along the entire U.S.-Mexico 
border. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeking Damages 
</P>
<P>
The family is seeking unspecified damages from the U.S. government for wrongful 
death and for emotional distress inflicted upon Angel Hernandez, who witnessed 
the death. U.S. authorities have rejected the initial claim. The family plans 
to file suit shortly in U.S. District Court in San Diego, Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
The Border Patrol has maintained that the vehicle was traveling at no more than 
15 m.p.h. -- within agency guidelines -- when it struck and ran over the boy. 
The youth was running when he fell in the path of the vehicle, which was unable 
to stop, the patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
The death occurred in an area where, each evening, all-terrain enforcement 
vehicles patrol back and forth along the tattered border fence as hundreds of 
migrants gather on the Tijuana side and just inside U.S. territory, all waiting 
for an opportunity to dart north. Witnesses estimate that the vehicles, which 
churn up clouds of dust along the dirt track, have been seen traveling as fast 
as 35 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, according to a San Diego civil-rights coalition, Border 
Patrol vehicles have run over and killed at least six migrants in the 
California-Mexico border region, prompting calls for more safety procedures.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROSECUTOR ENDS PHASE OF MCMARTIN ARGUMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Telling an attentive jury in Los Angeles Superior Court that the totality of 
evidence "draws the ring around Ray Buckey and Peggy McMartin Buckey closer and 
tighter, to the extent that you should find them guilty," Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Roger Gunson on Monday wound up the first phase of the prosecution's final 
arguments in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial. Gunson spent three days 
tying together more than two years of evidence and attempting to demonstrate 
how the defense's own witnesses frequently corroborated the prosecution's case. 
He cited the testimony of the alleged victims and their parents, medical 
findings, a jailhouse informant's account of conversations with defendant Ray 
Buckey, and testimony by both Buckey and his attorney, Danny Davis. 
</P>
<P>
He also raised questions about what is contained on a missing half-page snipped 
from the diary of nursery school founder Virginia McMartin. The missing entry 
was for the date a child who attended the Manhattan Beach school was allegedly 
molested. The child's accusations triggered the case. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Dean Gits, who represents Peggy McMartin Buckey, will present 
his arguments today, followed by Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Each side has been allotted 6 1/2 days. 
</P>
<P>
Deliberations are expected to begin by the end of this month.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SPRING VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fire early Monday in a Spring Valley school has been blamed on arson, a San 
Diego County Sheriff's Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Spring Valley and other East County firefighters contained the blaze at the 
Kempton Street Elementary School, which began at 4:30 a.m., to the nurses' 
office, sheriff's investigator Paul Bledsoe said. Then, he said, firefighters 
called sheriff's deputies, suspecting a burglary. 
</P>
<P>
A teachers' lounge door was found opened near the nurses' office and several 
thousand dollars worth of computer equipment was stolen from the main office, 
Bledsoe said. 
</P>
<P>
Bledsoe estimated the total loss from the burglary and fire at $50,000.

D.A. ASKS JAIL TIME, STIFF FINE FOR GABOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zsa Zsa Gabor's legal battles resumed with a flourish on Monday, with Los 
Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner announcing he will seek a 30-day jail 
term for the former glamour queen and Gabor's attorney countering with a 
request for a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, in an attempt to make an example of the fiery actress, surprised many 
courthouse observers by recommending that the nearly 70-year-old Gabor be 
jailed for slapping Beverly Hills Police Officer Paul Kramer in June. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor's sentencing on the misdemeanor battery conviction, originally set for 
today, was delayed until Oct. 24 by Beverly Hills Municipal Judge Charles G. 
Rubin to allow time for Gabor's new attorney, Harrison E. Bull, to prepare 
arguments on her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"She made her bed and she can lie in it -- and that's at Sybil Brand (women's 
jail)," Reiner said before Monday's brief hearing. Deputy Dist. Atty. Elden 
Fox, who jousted frequently with Gabor during the three-week trial in 
September, had hinted earlier that prosecutors might recommend only a fine and 
community service work. 
</P>
<P>
But in discussions about the case, Fox and Reiner decided that the high 
visibility of the trial and Gabor's apparent lack of penitence justified 
harsher punishment, Fox said. The district attorney's office filed papers 
Monday seeking 30 days in jail, $3,100 in fines -- the legal maximum -- and 
more than $14,000 in assessments against Gabor to pay for costs incurred by the 
Beverly Hills Police Department because of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors dropped a recommendation that Gabor pay a lesser fine of $1,000 and 
perform 150 hours of community service work. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, her case is going to be a yardstick for all other battery cases 
on a police officer," Fox said in an interview. "As a prosecutor, I would have 
a hard time . . . asking for jail time (in other cases) if I do not ask for it 
in a case like this. She is not contrite and she has no remorse about this." 
</P>
<P>
Reiner's office, which handles all felony and misdemeanor cases in Beverly 
Hills and a number of other small cities, concluded that community service work 
would only create more publicity for Gabor, Fox said. Prosecutors also did not 
ask for a shorter jail term -- one or two days, for example -- for much the 
same reason, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"To have her come waltzing in with her mink stole and cameras following her 
would make a farce of it," Fox said. "My idea is punishment and not her 
continued promotion." 
</P>
<P>
Gabor, who did not appear in court Monday, got into the altercation with Kramer 
after a routine traffic stop. She was convicted of slapping the officer, 
driving without a license and possessing an open container of alcohol -- a 
flask of Jack Daniels -- in her $225,000 Rolls-Royce. All are misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
Her sentencing was delayed when her new attorney, Bull, asked for a new trial, 
charging that she was poorly represented by her former lawyer, William Graysen. 
</P>
<P>
Bull, a veteran criminal lawyer from Santa Barbara, accused Graysen of 
soliciting Gabor's legal business merely to publicize his own practice. Bull 
told the court that Graysen represented Gabor for free and made unethical 
promises to her that she would not be sent to jail. 
</P>
<P>
"He told her, 'It's no big deal; you cannot go to jail for this -- it's 
impossible,' " Bull said. "What we have here is a miscarriage of justice." 
</P>
<P>
Graysen, contacted later, denied promising Gabor she would not go to jail, 
saying he had only offered his opinion "that I didn't think it was likely." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, "During the course of the trial she made many comments to the 
media that she was concerned about going to jail." 
</P>
<P>
Graysen said that he is permitted under rules of the California State Bar to 
solicit cases as long as he is not paid for them.

POSTSCRIPT DROPPING OUT: FROM HERO TO JERK: GOOD OLD ED SERVES PARTY CROWD A 
DOSE OF REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At Hughes Aircraft, minds have changed about Ed Greer. 
</P>
<P>
A Hughes dropout from the corporate fast track, engineer Greer had become the 
subject of a fantasy cult since he vanished eight years ago without telling a 
soul. 
</P>
<P>
The colleagues he left behind imagined that Greer, 41, was on some tropical 
beach, sunning himself -- free of deadline stress, his arm around a 
good-looking woman. His smiling face adorned gag pictures propped on desks at 
Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
Each year his former co-workers celebrated the anniversary of his disappearance 
-- hailing him last year as the presidential candidate of the "Hughesocratic 
Party." 
</P>
<P>
But this year the celebration, held Friday at a bar in Manhattan Beach, had a 
bitter twist. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of honoring his disappearance, the occasion was the first anniversary 
of the day the FBI caught up with Ed Greer in Houston -- alive, well, and with 
a new woman, still working with computers, still driving a red sports car, but 
with someone else's name on his tax returns. Greer's scheme began to unravel 
when the IRS noted that something was funny when two tax returns with the same 
name -- one from the real Kenneth Hearn and one from Greer posing as Hearn -- 
came in from different parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
The sentiment at Hughes now is as vitriolically anti-Greer as it was 
sophomorically pro-Greer before. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not celebrating the guy. We're getting together to talk about what a 
jerk he was," said Sherry McCulloh, Greer's former secretary and party 
organizer. 
</P>
<P>
"When he was discovered, it did not live up to our fantasies. We had been 
having parties for him all those years. When we found out the reasons he left, 
it seemed kind of cowardly. 
</P>
<P>
"If the reason he left was that he didn't like his wife, he could have told his 
kids. We were hoping he had a good reason." 
</P>
<P>
The invitation this year urged people to come because "Ed's a JERK!" Two Ed 
Greer dolls transfixed with pins hung from a light at the party. 
</P>
<P>
In his most recent public interview, conducted in the spring, Greer said he had 
indeed spent a lot of time on the beaches -- Florida beaches -- without steady 
work, with several romantic encounters, before moving on to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
On April 29, Greer married Victoria Hogg, an Exxon tax attorney, whom he met 
and wooed while passing himself off as Hearn, a computer engineer working for 
Input-Output Inc. of Houston, a small oil exploration firm. 
</P>
<P>
The invitation to Friday's gathering had some doggerel verse containing a 
reference to Greer's Florida period: 
</P>
<P>
 There was a man with a beard 
</P>
<P>
 Who wore three-piece suits and was weird. 
</P>
<P>
 He grew tired of 'Hughes life,' 
</P>
<P>
 His dad and his wife, 
</P>
<P>
 So off to Fort Lauderdale he steered... 
</P>
<P>
 Once we gathered in honor of Ed, 
</P>
<P>
 But he turned out to be a bonehead. 
</P>
<P>
 Our cult had been shattered, 
</P>
<P>
 Cause he left all that mattered. 
</P>
<P>
 It's really too bad that he's not dead! 
</P>
<P>
 The party is only one indicator that Greer's resurfacing has been difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Greer's two sons, and his former wife, Kit Clark, who is remarried and now is a 
marriage counselor living in Northern California, have spoken out publicly, and 
bitterly, about the whole episode. They were the subject of an article in 
People magazine and have appeared on Geraldo Rivera's show and "A Current 
Affair." 
</P>
<P>
At the Ed Party, a poster quoted an exchange between Rivera and one of Greer's 
sons: 
</P>
<P>
Rivera: "But, what kind of guy is he?" 
</P>
<P>
Jason: "Oh, a jerk." 
</P>
<P>
Greer's problems with the IRS were settled soon after he was discovered. Still, 
Greer remains entangled in a pending court case stemming from his attempts to 
re-establish a relationship with his sons. Clark has filed suit against Greer 
to terminate his parental rights. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who had been critical of Hughes personnel last year for celebrating 
what, in effect, were her personal difficulties, talked about the changed 
attitude of the Hughes personnel and the latest Ed Party. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they found out that reality wasn't as funny," she said. GEORGE STEIN

OPERATORS SAY NEW LANDFILL PLAN WILL SAVE 1,000 TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN STEINBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The operators of Sunshine Canyon Landfill, who have proposed more than doubling 
the size of the dump, told Los Angeles County planning commissioners touring 
the site Monday that they will submit a new plan next month to preserve 1,000 
of the 8,613 trees slated for destruction under the company's initial proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan is a response to county planners who asked the dump's owner, 
Browning-Ferris Industries, to develop alternative proposals that could save 
the unusual blend of oak, big-cone spruce and Douglas fir trees in the upper 
reaches of the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The tree removal is one of the most controversial aspects of the planned 
expansion, which is opposed by the North Valley Coalition, a Granada Hills 
residents group that wants Sunshine Canyon included in a proposed state park. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the new plan will be presented at the second public hearing on the 
project, scheduled for 4 p.m. Nov. 2 at Kennedy High School in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
BFI had proposed expanding its existing 230-acre dump into 542 acres of 
unincorporated county territory north of Granada Hills. It would preserve the 
1,000 trees by reducing the proposed area by about 40 acres, said James T. 
Aidukas, director of environmental affairs for BFI's Pacific region. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners, making their first visit, toured the dump without comment. 
</P>
<P>
Supervising regional planner Richard Frazier characterized BFI's new plan as 
"in between the two things requested" by planners at the first public hearing, 
on Oct. 4. In addition to preserving trees, planners asked BFI to develop an 
alternative plan that would reduce the 70 million tons of trash the company 
would like the dump to accommodate. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan, however, does not address the amount of trash that would be 
dumped at the landfill. "By making adjustments in the overall design, we could 
save trees and still have the same capacity," Aidukas said.

of so many trees is a controversial aspect of the expansion, which is opposed 
by Granada Hills residents. B3

SANTA CLARITA AGREES TO PAY $7 MILLION FOR CITY HALL SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a yearlong search for a site for a city hall, Santa Clarita has agreed to 
pay $7 million for 238 acres of vacant land in the center of the city, 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager Ken Pulskamp said the owner of the property, Wes Lind, 
accepted the city's latest offer last week. The city bid $5.1 million in 
September, but Lind rejected the offer. 
</P>
<P>
The city paid Lind a $50,000 deposit. The hilly property, of which about 145 
acres are usable, is southeast of Bouquet Canyon and Soledad Canyon roads. 
</P>
<P>
The city has 75 days to conduct a study to determine whether the site is 
suitable for a city hall, Pulskamp said. 
</P>
<P>
If the study uncovers any problems -- and Pulskamp said he is doubtful it will 
-- the city can pull out and recover its deposit with interest. Among other 
things, the city will study whether a maintenance yard can be built on the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
City offices are now on the third floor of the Valencia National Bank building. 
The city hopes to open the new city hall before that lease expires in 1992, 
Pulskamp said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials inspected 18 sites before bidding on Lind's property, Pulskamp 
said. The first choice had been the defunct Saugus Rehabilitation Center, a 
520-acre parcel owned by the city of Los Angeles. The center, vacant except for 
dilapidated military-style barracks, has been closed since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members said that site was a prime spot for a city hall, public 
park and possibly an arts center and are still trying to acquire the property, 
Pulskamp said. 
</P>
<P>
The Castaic Lake Water Agency also is trying to obtain 60 to 80 acres of that 
property for a water treatment plant and agreed to work with Santa Clarita 
officials in pursuing the site. In September the agency offered $15.8 million, 
but Los Angeles officials said the offer was too low for all 520 acres. 
Officials agreed to negotiate with the water agency on the acreage needed for 
the treatment plant.

A 41-year-old Escondido man has been arrested in the beating death of his 
74-year-old mother, a San Diego Sheriff's Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Hayhurst, who lived at the home in the 14100 block of San Pasqual Road 
with his mother, was booked into County Jail in Vista on suspicion of murder, 
Sheriff's Sgt. Danny Goodrich said. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Violet Susan Hayhurst was found lying near the passenger door of 
her truck, a quarter-mile from her home early Sunday morning, Goodrich said. 
Deputy Coroner Chuck Bolton said Hayhurst died of multiple blows to the head 
with a blunt instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies questioned the victim's unemployed son at the residence. 
</P>
<P>
The case will be presented to the San Diego County district attorney's office 
by Wednesday, Goodrich said.

The Navy said Monday it has suspended a Baldwin Park defense contractor from 
doing business with it, saying the company supplied untested circuit boards for 
tactical missiles. 
</P>
<P>
The boards, made by Asher Engineering Corp., went into such weapons as the 
Navy's Phoenix long-range air-to-air missile, the Harpoon anti-ship missile, 
the Tomahawk cruise missile, the Sidewinder heat-seeking missile and an 
advanced medium-range air-to-air missile, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The firm made printed wiring boards that were put into arming switches made by 
another defense contractor, Micronics International of Brea.

KILLEA ENTERS RACE, SETTING UP FIGHT OF THE INCUMBENTS FOR STIRLING SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Setting the stage for a rare political showdown between two incumbents, 
Assemblywoman Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) on Monday announced her candidacy in 
this December's special election in the 39th State Senate District -- a race 
that will pit her against Republican Assemblywoman Carol Bentley of El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
Killea, a former San Diego city councilwoman who traditionally has run well 
among Republicans, will need to draw on that political attribute again in order 
to have a serious chance to succeed recently retired Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San 
Diego) in the heavily Republican 39th District. Stirling stepped down from the 
Legislature last month to accept a gubernatorial appointment to the San Diego 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
With Republicans holding a 49%-38% registration edge in the district, many of 
Killea's own advisers recommended that she not enter the Dec. 5 contest. 
Although Killea acknowledged that the district's demographics are slanted 
against her, she also enters the race with confidence born of the fact that her 
own 78th Assembly district, which she has represented for seven years, is the 
most heavily Republican district held by a Democrat in the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Choose for Themselves' 
</P>
<P>
"Conventional wisdom has it that a Democrat, regardless of record, experience 
or position on the issues, could not win in this (39th) district," Killea said. 
"Perhaps they are right. On the other hand, many residents of the 39th . . . 
have urged me to give the people an opportunity to choose for themselves who 
should represent their interests in the state Senate, making that choice based 
on a broader criteria than party affiliation." 
</P>
<P>
Killea's entry in the race sets up a compelling contrast of styles and 
philosophy with Bentley, a longtime state legislative aide who was elected to 
the Assembly from the 77th District only last November. 
</P>
<P>
Noted for a low-key style that disarms many opponents, Killea, 67, served for 
four years on the City Council before moving to the Assembly. The 44-year-old 
Bentley, meanwhile, is more aggressive -- and, from Killea's perspective, a bit 
too eager to quickly move up the political ladder after only 10 months on the 
job in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not waiting very long, is she?" Killea asked, rhetorically, when Bentley 
entered the race. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Differing Opinions 
</P>
<P>
The two also differ on myriad issues -- none more potentially significant than 
the always volatile topic of abortion. Killea is pro-choice on abortion, saying 
that "a woman's right to make this decision is paramount and does not belong in 
the hands of politicians or judges." Bentley, meanwhile, opposes abortions 
except in cases of rape, incest or where the mother's life is endangered. 
</P>
<P>
"This issue goes beyond abortion to the more constructive solution of family 
planning and how to prevent the tragedy of an unwanted child," Killea said. "My 
opponent voted against family planning, even when those funds could not be used 
for abortion. The choice here could really not be more clear." 
</P>
<P>
Among their other notable philosophical differences, Killea supported the ban 
on military assault rifles and opposes oil drilling off the California coast, 
while Bentley has cast opposite votes on both issues. 
</P>
<P>
Though the names of about half a dozen other potential candidates have been 
mentioned, only one -- El Cajon lawyer Thomas Connolly -- has taken out 
candidacy papers to date. If no candidate in the December primary receives more 
than 50% of the vote, the top Democrat and Republican -- along with the top 
vote-getter of any minor parties entered in the primary -- will compete in a 
Jan. 30 runoff.

REFLECTIONS: I MUST BE A FANATIC BECAUSE THIS ESCAPING IS VERY DANGEROUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PERRY C. RIDDLE

<TEXT>
<P>
Oleg Emelyanov had a variety of ideas for escaping from the Soviet Union. Four 
years ago he came up with the right idea and several weeks later he arrived in 
Los Angeles. Emelyanov lives in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
I like to travel, I like to see other countries, but it was impossible to do it 
being in the Soviet Union. That's one reason why I escaped. 
</P>
<P>
At first I thought maybe I can marry foreign woman; I can leave Russia that 
way. But after awhile I realized is very difficult to contact any foreign woman 
because I didn't speak any foreign languages. 
</P>
<P>
After that I had many fantastic ideas. For example, I thought maybe I can build 
a small submarine and leave Russia on it. I thought it was possible to cross 
the Baltic Sea to Sweden. But it was impossible because the submarine must 
weigh more than one ton. I had no car so I couldn't bring it to the seaside. It 
was wrong idea. 
</P>
<P>
After that I thought maybe I could cross the border on foot, but Russian border 
is not American-Mexican border. So it was wrong idea. 
</P>
<P>
I saw little ad in newspaper. Some person was flying in this very small plane 
for one person and it doesn't have any cabin. I called him and he told me it 
cost 25,000 rubles. I earned 2,000 rubles per year. So it was wrong idea, also. 
</P>
<P>
Then I started to think about small boat to cross the sea. And I visited 
seaside of Baltic Sea in Lithuania. But I saw big coast guard ship, then I saw 
radar station and I realize it's almost impossible to leave Russia from this 
part of land because Sweden is very near Russia. 
</P>
<P>
So I realized it would be better to cross the Black Sea, because it's not so 
important for Soviet Union because it's a closed sea. I chose point which was 
450 kilometers from Turkey, it's not so heavily guarded. 
</P>
<P>
I studied for about a year. I had to know a lot of things about the weather, 
about the season, a little about navigation, a little about astronomy. I read a 
lot in the library. 
</P>
<P>
It takes six months to get the boat. It was small, one man plus me. The sail 
and the motor I bought in one day. We had some apples and 10 liters of fresh 
water. That's all. 
</P>
<P>
I must be a fanatic because this escaping is very dangerous. I was some kind of 
crazy. Some days I thought, "Of course I can do it, it's no problem." But after 
a while I thought, "No, it's impossible, they catch me, 100%." And then again I 
think, "No, I can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Then my friend and I went to Anapa, a city on the Black Sea. We took all of our 
stuff, the boat, the motor, sail, to seaside and found a place to stay for a 
couple of hours waiting for dark time to inflate the boat. We decided to start 
at 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
I think it takes seven or eight days, but it took us only five days, because 
after two days there was a storm and the wind came stronger and stronger, and 
we could move very fast. But this wind was very dangerous because it blew from 
the side, our boat could capsize. The water comes again and again. We have to 
sit in water because our boat was full of water, but it can't sink because it's 
inflated. It was very cold. We thought about a warm bed especially at nighttime 
because we couldn't sleep during the five days. 
</P>
<P>
To see the land after five days was the most exciting. We were very tired after 
this trip. We can't walk straight because of spending five days in small boat. 
</P>
<P>
I was three days in Turkey police station, then I was one week in secret base, 
then exactly 30 days in Ankara prison. Turks took us to the airport and in two 
hours we were in Munich. I went to New York, in two weeks I went to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
I started English when I came to Los Angeles, so I study English, nighttime. It 
was difficult for me to get the first job. But the second job was much easier. 
I have same job, electronic assembly, as in Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
My plans are to be an idea man. But maybe it's impossible for me, so I will be 
a programmer because I know math very well. Maybe in a year I will take 
college. I like to create ideas. I think my escaping is good example, I thought 
a lot about it.

COUNCIL MEMBERS ASSAIL CRA BUDGET REPORT AS 'MISLEADING'; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: TAKING THEIR FIRST HARD LOOK AT THE AGENCY'S MASSIVE AND COMPLEX 
EXPENDITURES, SOME ON THE PANEL DON'T LIKE WHAT THEY SEE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Struggling to make sense of a 350-page document, City Council members on Monday 
criticized the Community Redevelopment Agency for producing a budget they 
called "misleading" and "suspicious." 
</P>
<P>
"It's like an Easter egg hunt," Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said. "You've got to 
be a Harvard research assistant to try to figure out what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky and Councilwoman Gloria Molina professed exasperation Monday during 
a committee meeting scheduled to take the first hard look at the CRA's 
expenditures since the council voted itself greater control over the agency 
last June. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, this is the last you've seen of rubber stamps by the City 
Council," Molina said. 
</P>
<P>
The document sent to the council describes an annual budget of $582 million and 
two dozen major projects under way. 
</P>
<P>
But Molina complained that, for example, nowhere in the document could she find 
money earmarked to pay the Union Rescue Mission $6.5 million to relocate its 
downtown site, a proposal approved by the council last week at the prodding of 
the CRA. 
</P>
<P>
"This makes your budget look suspicious," Molina said. "How am I to know what 
you are really spending money on?" 
</P>
<P>
Molina called the budget "very misleading" and said: "This document doesn't 
tell us the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Said Yaroslavsky: "It does not give us a true picture of how you're spending 
money." 
</P>
<P>
John Tuite, the CRA's chief administrator, appeared angered by the criticism 
and said he was offended at the suggestion that he was attempting to mislead 
the council. He offered to provide the council with any information it wants, 
in any form they like. 
</P>
<P>
In a developing controversy over the direction of the CRA, the council voted 
last June to give itself authority to review the agency's budgets and work 
programs before they are approved by the CRA's commission, appointed by Mayor 
Tom Bradley. In addition, the council gave itself veto power over CRA decisions 
and created a new committee to review CRA policy. 
</P>
<P>
The council rejected a proposal sponsored by Yaroslavsky last June to take over 
the CRA entirely. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have taken the thing over when we had the opportunity," Yaroslavsky 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The council's new review panel, called the Community Redevelopment and Housing 
Committee, is chaired by Molina, who in recent weeks has become a thorn in the 
side of the CRA. She voted against the Union Rescue Mission move and has been 
increasingly vocal in her criticism of the CRA. 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Hertzberg, an aide to Molina, said Monday that the council's new role in 
relation to the CRA is "more revolutionary than evolutionary" and said the 
committee, which is meeting jointly with Yaroslavsky's Budget and Finance 
Committee, intends to go over the CRA budget "line by line" and make changes 
where warranted. 
</P>
<P>
In past years, "nobody knew what was going on" with the CRA budget, Hertzberg 
said.

IS HE OUT?: A DISLOCATED SHOULDER, BRUISED KNEE AND SPRAINED ANKLE MAKE THE

<P>
It went from bad to worse Monday for the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Bad was the 17-16 defeat Seattle handed them Sunday when the Seahawks blocked 
an extra point and a field goal in the final period. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, was the preliminary injury report handed to Coach Dan Henning less than 
24 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
Charger quarterback Jim McMahon suffered a dislocated shoulder, a bruised knee 
and sprained ankle against the Seahawks, won't practice Wednesday and may not 
play against the Giants Sunday at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Trainers were 
able to pop the shoulder back into position during the Seattle loss in which 
McMahon threw for 286 yards. But it was extremely sore Monday. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon topped a long list of Charger injuries. And his delicate condition 
could prompt Henning to activate rookie quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver, 
eligible to come off injured reserve this week. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Tolliver insists he will be ready if needed even though he hasn't 
played one regular season down in the NFL. Tolliver's injury, a broken 
collarbone, occurred during the Chargers' final exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
"If Dan Henning tells me to go jump off that Coronado Bridge or whatever it is, 
then I'm gonna jump off that bridge," Tolliver said. "That's the only way to 
play the game. If he tells me to come off IR (injured reserve), then I come off 
IR." 
</P>
<P>
Henning said he won't make a decision on Tolliver until Wednesday's practice. 
He also has the option of starting backup David Archer at quarterback against 
the Giants if McMahon can't play. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon has been the Chargers' starter through six games. But because of a 
history of injuries he has never started more than nine consecutive games in 
one season. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought he could be ready by Sunday for the Giants and their 
fearsome pass-rushing linebacker Lawrence Taylor, Tolliver said, "if they got 
me in there practicing with the regular group, then it's not a question of, 'Do 
I think I would?' it's, 'I've got to.' There's no ifs, ands or buts about it. 
If Taylor comes on a blitz, it's my job to throw it." 
</P>
<P>
The most serious injuries to other key players include H-back Rod Bernstine 
(knee), wide receiver Quinn Early (knee) and left tackle Joel Patten (knee). 
Henning said running back Dana Brinson has a "neurological problem" between his 
neck and shoulder described as a "burner." 
</P>
<P>
Henning also said it is entirely possible that McMahon, Early, Brinson, Patten 
and Bernstine will all miss the Giants' game. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of Brinson and Bernstine cripples the Chargers at the H-back position 
which, next to quarterback, is the most important spot in their offense. "I'm 
going to put up a notice on the board out there," Henning said. "It will say, 
'All those interested in being a back, apply.' " 
</P>
<P>
Added Henning: "It's going to be difficult to prepare for this game no matter 
what offensively because of the amount of injuries that we have." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Charger cornerback Gill Byrd leads the AFC with five interceptions. . . . 
Giants place-kicker Raul Allegre leads the NFL in scoring with 63 points. The 
Chargers (2-4) play the Giants (5-1) at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium Sunday. . 
. . Asked if the "burner" injury suffered by Dana Brinson was anything like 
what other teams commonly refer to as a "stinger" Charger Coach Dan Henning 
said, "I thought a stinger was a drink."

BANKS' CHARGER FUTURE IS STILL UNDER DISCUSSION;

<P>
IS HE IN?: THE TROUBLED LINEBACKER WILL CONTINUE HIS DRUG REHABILITATION IN SAN

The Chargers had a tentative agreement to trade drug-troubled linebacker Chip 
Banks to the Cowboys Monday. But the deal fell through when Banks and his 
counselor, David Katz, agreed that Banks' rehabilitation should continue in the 
San Diego area and not anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day Banks traveled to Stockton and met with Charger owner Alex 
Spanos and Steve Ortmayer, the team's director of football operations. There 
they discussed what future Banks might have with the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Spanos, who has stated publicly that Banks will never play again for the 
Chargers, reiterated that sentiment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"My position has not changed," Spanos said. 
</P>
<P>
But Spanos left a crack in the door open for Banks' return when he added, 
"we'll deal with the trading deadline when it comes." 
</P>
<P>
The trading deadline is 1 p.m. today. After it passes, the Chargers could still 
sign Banks and bring him in for workouts on a trial basis. It is believed 
Ortmayer has been trying to convince Spanos to give Banks a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas' interest in Banks began heating up Saturday when John Wooten, the 
Cowboys' director of pro personnel, visited Banks in San Diego. The two visited 
for two and a half hours. But the more Wooten talked to Banks the more he 
realized Banks' rehabilitation must continue in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't have been there if I didn't think Chip couldn't still play," Wooten 
said Monday. "But I think it's best he stay where he is, not only in terms of 
football, but in terms of getting his life back together." 
</P>
<P>
Katz said Banks has just finished a 90-day extended care program at the Rancho 
L'Abri center in Dulzura. The next step for Banks, Katz said, is an extended 
care program in what he called a "recovery home." 
</P>
<P>
Katz said the recovery home is in the San Diego area. And its rules would allow 
Banks to practice and travel to road games if the Chargers decide to give Banks 
another chance at football. The recovery home program is scheduled to take one 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Banks, 30, hasn't played since the 1987 season. He missed all of 1988 in a 
contract dispute. Meanwhile, he was arrested five times on various drug and 
sexual abuse charges in the last 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer said it is now unlikely the Chargers will trade Banks before the 
deadline. Ortmayer also said it is improbable the Chargers will trade unsigned 
running back Gary Anderson before the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel very strongly that they (Anderson and his agents) have not made an 
effort to get this (a contract) done," Ortmayer said. "Consequently we feel 
this player (Anderson) is more valuable to us than anybody else."

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: HOLIDAY BOWL GUARANTEES PARTICIPANTS $1 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Holiday Bowl announced Monday a guaranteed payoff of a minimum of $1 
million to each participating team in this year's game, an increase from 1988's 
payoff of $907,613 to Oklahoma State and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, the Holiday Bowl's first year, Navy and Brigham Young each received 
$218,645. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Moore, 1989 Holiday Bowl President, also announced a new agreement with 
ESPN which extends the original deal with the network through 1993. The Holiday 
Bowl and ESPN originally signed a three-year deal in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
No terms of the new television contract with ESPN were disclosed. Last year's 
game earned a 6.1 rating on ESPN, making it the second-most watched event 
outside of NFL games in the history of the network. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Moore said that the 1989 Holiday Bowl is sold out -- the earliest 
sellout in the 11-year history of the game. More than 40,000 tickets have been 
sold, and the Holiday Bowl is required by the NCAA to hold 20,000 tickets for 
the participating teams. 
</P>
<P>
This year's game will match the champion of the Western Athletic Conference 
with an at-large team. SCOTT MILLER

The message was hardly reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
"The seat-belt light is flashing and on the trading desk is a bottle of Maalox 
and a copy of the New Testament. We're ready," Larry Wachtel, the voice of 
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., broadcast at 6 a.m. Monday over intercoms in 
the brokerage's branches. 
</P>
<P>
As Wachtel's voice crackled over speakers on the 13th floor of the downtown Los 
Angeles headquarters of Prudential-Bache, apprehensive brokers listened 
intently. "Our initial impression is that it's going to be rocky but not nearly 
as bad as 'Meltdown Monday.' " He referred to Oct. 19, 1987 -- Black Monday -- 
when the stock market plummeted 508 points. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking of that Monday two years ago, the 42 brokers waited tensely. An eerie 
quiet settled over the office as the market began its descent -- the Dow Jones 
industrial index dropping 24 points in the first 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Institutions are standing 100% on the sidelines; they are trying to get a feel 
of the stock market," explained Bernard Kassover, a senior vice president and a 
23-year veteran at Prudential-Bache, as he shuffled pink order sheets and 
peered intently at the flashing green numbers on his computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the first half hour of trading, the Dow index was down 36 points. 
But Kassover, who expected the indicator to plummet 100 points within the first 
30 minutes, was relieved that the market was acting rationally. 
</P>
<P>
"No hysterics -- it's nothing like two years ago. This is almost a normal day, 
but it could change in 30 seconds. Everybody is waiting for the next man to 
act." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, 15 minutes later, the market was down 64 points. "It's getting worse, 
and a lot of stocks haven't opened yet," said Kassover as he placed a call to 
Prudential's international desk to get the London price on BAT Industries for a 
client. "People are confused. People are trying to get a handle on things. When 
it settles down, buyers will come back." 
</P>
<P>
Kassover was on the phone soothing clients and doing a lot of hand-holding to 
get them to ride out the market's volatility. He had worked Sunday to prepare 
for Monday, putting in some sell orders for clients. Still, he arrived at the 
office on Monday at 4:30 a.m. -- half an hour earlier than usual. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, down the hall, Y. Clifford Tanaka and his son, Jonathan, were also 
taking calls. Only one of their clients, a new one, had decided to liquidate 
his portfolio Friday. The others were hanging in there. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the first hour, the market had recovered to a plus-30 position. 
By 7:30 a.m., John W. Eisele, vice president and resident manager, was on the 
loudspeaker. "The selling panic has turned to buying . . . decide on the price 
you want to buy." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a selling panic," said the elder Tanaka. "Aw, dad, he is just trying 
to rally the troops," responded his son. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, the buy orders began coming in, eventually outnumbering the sell orders 
as the day progressed. Wire operators couldn't field the orders fast enough. 
One was for a $10,000 buy of Retirement Planning Funds of America Inc., an 
equity fund. Another was for 100-share purchases of Johnson &amp; Johnson, 
Citicorp and Philip Morris. Another was for Disney at $115 a share. 
</P>
<P>
By 9 a.m., a lull settled in, but volume continued heavy. Kassover clients 
called in to chat. One, from Long Island, N.Y., asked, "Bernie, you OK?" 
Kassover was thankful for their concern. 
</P>
<P>
Tanaka reports that clients are making "switches," pulling money out of one 
stock but buying another. 
</P>
<P>
In the conference room, scrawled in blue marker, were the highlights from the 
morning call. "Focus on utility, income stocks. Fire sale: buy franchise cos., 
WMT (Walmart), Disney, also yield securities. Chinese word for crisis also 
means opportunity. Don't panic -- buy value." 
</P>
<P>
As the hours wore on, trading drifted up and down but stayed mostly on the plus 
side. Donald J. Trump withdrew his offer for AMR Corp., but it did not bring 
the disruption to the market that occurred Friday when United Airlines 
announced that it could not obtain financing for its employee-led buyout. 
</P>
<P>
As noon approached, and it appeared that no market crisis was in sight, brokers 
began to relax and chat. A favorite visit was to the office of Kassover's 
associate, Jeffrey D. Daggett, for free gum balls from a red machine sitting 
atop a small refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope Donald Trump took a bath on that," said one visitor, referring to the 
AMR Corp. deal. "They should sue him," said another. "The greater game is 
taking a position and withdrawing and then making a lot of money, almost like 
insider trading," said another. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, orders were coming in at a rate two-thirds greater than normal and 
double Friday's rate. Eisele was estimating a Monday trade volume between $15 
million to $20 million for his office. 
</P>
<P>
As the market wound down, brokers were anxious for the close. Five minutes 
before the close, Kassover popped open a can of 7-Up and poured it in his blue 
mug. As the market closed, he took a gulp from his mug slugged "1 Boss Bernie" 
and sighed: "I'm relieved."

THUNDER OF A NEW BREED OF BULLS

This time it's different. Investors bulled stock prices to a big rebound 
Monday, demonstrating great confidence in the U.S. economy and their own 
judgment. Their action was in marked contrast to two years ago, when the market 
crashed and investors, fearing an imminent recession, fled from stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Now, visible evidence of a slowing economy did not deter them. "Considering 
that corporate earnings are falling, not rising, it's amazing how easy it was 
for the market to bounce back," said Charles Clough, chief investment 
strategist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. His own forecasts for company 
earnings notwithstanding, Clough recommended Monday that his firm's 
professional investor clients increase their holdings of common stocks and 
reduce holdings of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, he followed a thundering herd of brokerage houses making similar 
recommendations. Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., Shearson Lehman Hutton, Paine Webber 
and the research house Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., among others, advised 
customers to put more money in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
Evidently, they were preaching to the choir as many investors spent the weekend 
telling their brokers and even the Gallup Poll that they were in the mood to 
invest. The Gallup organization polled a few hundred of Fidelity Investments' 
mutual fund customers and found almost all of them upbeat about the American 
economy and prepared to stay invested in stocks for the long term. 
</P>
<P>
Individual brokers heard similar sentiments. "I came in Monday morning with buy 
orders," said Walter Haddad, senior vice president of Paine Webber in Los 
Angeles. Haddad waited until a selling hangover from Friday cleared the market 
-- during roughly the first hour of trading -- and then went in buying. He was 
part of a nationwide rush to purchase stocks that drove trading volume to 
416.29 million shares, the fourth largest ever. 
</P>
<P>
Confident as they were about the economy's underlying strength, investors 
favored basic industries. Shares of the chemical companies, Dow and Du Pont, 
each rose more than $3. General Electric was up more than $2, AT&amp;T was up 
more $3. Heavy machinery makers Caterpillar, Deere and Ingersoll Rand were up; 
the aluminum companies Alcan and Alcoa were up. Even the automobile makers, 
Ford, General Motors and Chrysler, were up, although the outlook for car sales 
this fall is not strong. 
</P>
<P>
The over-the-counter market, where stocks of smaller companies are traded and 
individual investors outnumber big institutions, declined early Monday -- a 
late reaction to Friday's fall in the larger markets. But the OTC recovered 
later to post a small loss on the NASDAQ composite index. 
</P>
<P>
In their optimism, investors were making up for a past mistake, explained 
investment managers. After the market's 190-point plunge on Friday, investors 
recalled their fears of recession in October, 1987, and also remembered that 
those fears had been unwarranted -- that in fact common stocks had outperformed 
certificates of deposits and other investments in the year following the crash. 
They were determined not to miss out this time. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, some investment experts questioned whether lightning would strike 
twice. Kenneth Fisher, a San Francisco investment manager, suggested that this 
is a time to be more cautious than enthusiastic about stock investments. 
</P>
<P>
"There is weakness in all parts of the auto supply industry," Fisher noted, as 
Detroit auto makers have scheduled relatively low production for the next few 
months. "And the trucking industry is already suffering hard times." 
Nonetheless, investors boosted prices Monday for such auto suppliers as Genuine 
Parts and for the big trucking firm Consolidated Freightways. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Danger for Investors 
</P>
<P>
In high technology also, there are signs the economy is slowing -- from the 
owner of a small software company, who wonders why sales dried up in October, 
to giant IBM, which reported a 29% decline in third-quarter earnings on Monday. 
(IBM had forecast the decline weeks ago, and its stock had already fallen. 
Nonetheless, IBM dropped to a 52-week low of $97.75 a share early Monday before 
recovering to close at $103.) 
</P>
<P>
The danger for investors, said Fisher, is that their enthusiasm for the 
economy's long-term strength will blind them to its near-term weakness and 
they'll fall into a "sucker's trap" -- buying stocks in a market rally that 
masks a general, long-term decline. 
</P>
<P>
The public wasn't listening to bearish advisers, however -- or to bullish ones 
for that matter. They were listening to their own counsel, said Michael Hines, 
who samples investor psychology for Fidelity. "Ever since the 1987 crash, the 
public has been disregarding the major institutions and making up its own 
mind," said Hines. 
</P>
<P>
No institution had been able to predict the crash, they decided -- and none had 
predicted Friday's plunge either. So individual investors now rely on their own 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
As Monday's rebound demonstrated, they are no longer easily frightened and, 
though the going might get rough for a while, they are in for the long haul. 
That's why the number of individual investors, which fell to 33 million after 
the crash two years ago, has grown back to more than 50 million at present. The 
American public, in short, is bullish.

SCHWAB &amp; CO., STUNG IN 1987, HAD CRISIS PLAN READY FOR FALL OF 1989

<P>
Randall N. Kirk, manager of the downtown Los Angeles branch of Charles Schwab 
&amp; Co., rolled into the office at 4:30 a.m. Monday to prepare for the 
onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
He was still sleepy. But memories persisted of an October Monday two years ago, 
when a flood of panicked investors overloaded phone lines at Schwab and other 
brokerages in the Wall Street selloff that would become Black Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Some investors later charged Schwab with botching, delaying or failing to 
complete stock transactions; others, mostly individuals, said they simply 
couldn't get through. 
</P>
<P>
Stung by the snafus, Schwab made major changes, such as extending hours and 
adding phone lines, for the next time that trading volumes exploded. That time 
came Monday, the first market day since an unsettling 190-point drop Friday in 
the Dow Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk and other Schwab employees nationwide arrived an hour earlier than usual. 
By 5 a.m., Kirk's office was staffed. By 6 a.m., switchboards were turned on, 
and the flood of calls began. 
</P>
<P>
By the close of trading Monday, the 110 offices of the country's largest 
discount brokerage firm had fielded more than 45,000 transactions, 
overshadowing Friday's heavy volume of 20,000 transactions and more than four 
times the normal volume, said Schwab spokesman Mark Thompson in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike 1987, the brokerage took things in stride, investors and Schwab 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone calls to several Southern California Schwab offices were answered by 
machine but were picked up in less than a minute by a Schwab employee. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had any transactions with them, (but) I did call them a few times 
(Monday) morning, and I got quick service as far as getting a few quotes," said 
investor David Schettini of La Crescenta, who was watching the ticker tape at 
Schwab's downtown office. 
</P>
<P>
Schwab was one of several brokerages that anticipated heavy volume and took 
steps to avoid 1987-style customer complaints. On Monday, Fidelity Investments 
ran full-page newspaper ads saying "Fidelity is ready for your call." 
</P>
<P>
After 1987, Schwab doubled its computer links with major exchanges to avoid 
trading bottlenecks, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
More important, Schwab now requires about 90% of its 2,000 branch employees to 
have broker's licenses, compared to 60% to 70% in 1987, Thompson said. Now, 
almost any employee -- even those in support functions -- can take orders in an 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Schwab also opened a call overflow center, to which calls could be bumped from 
swamped local offices, and added phone lines for investors using touch-tone 
phones to obtain quotes or make trades directly. 
</P>
<P>
And the brokerage extended its hours. After Friday's unexpected drop, Schwab 
opened all of its branches on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. In addition, 
employees came to work Sunday to prepare for Monday's expected deluge. 
Nationally, Schwab took about 18,000 calls over the weekend, more than three 
times the normal weekend load on its 24-hour telephone hot lines. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Schwab was scheduled to open an hour earlier, as well. It will decide 
whether to extend hours through the week depending on market conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, the mood at Schwab's offices was quite different from that in 1987. 
"Two years ago at this time, the momentum just kept getting stronger and 
stronger as the day went on . . . and there was a lot of panic," a Century City 
Schwab broker recalled. But this time, "We're not seeing the panic at this time 
that we saw two years ago," the broker said. 
</P>
<P>
In the downtown office, the activity was constant but subdued. No one took much 
time to lunch on the delivered pizza that grew cold, but Kirk was relaxed 
enough to chat for a few minutes with a couple of visitors just before the 
market's close. 
</P>
<P>
One investor even regretted the relative ease with which he transacted business 
Friday. It took only about five minutes for a Bellflower resident to reach a 
broker and sell his shares -- at a $3,000 loss. 
</P>
<P>
"They were good, and I wish I hadn't gotten through now," he said.

SALES OUTPACE INVENTORY RISE

<P>
Business sales far outpaced inventory accumulation in August, the government 
said Monday in a report that one analyst attributed to a mini-inventory 
correction. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said inventories edged up 0.3% to a seasonally adjusted 
$789.9 billion, while sales advanced a steep 3.1% to $526.8 billion. The pace 
in inventories was down from a 0.9% hike in July, while sales rose from a 0.9% 
decline the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of sales advancing far faster than the accumulation of goods on 
shelves and back lots is good news for the economy. If inventories were to pile 
up excessively, it could mean cutbacks in production and a loss of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce report showed a decrease in the ratio of inventories to sales from 
1.54 in July to 1.50 in August. That means it would take 1 1/2 months to 
exhaust inventories at the August pace.

<TEXT>
<P>
When 250 of Findlay's elite gathered for the Rotary Club's regular luncheon on 
Monday, club officials asked for a show of hands: How many had jumped in or out 
of the stock market on Friday? 
</P>
<P>
Only four or five of those present raised their hands. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pretty conservative folks," observed Ward Abbey, manager of the downtown 
Findlay brokerage office of A. G. Edwards, a St. Louis-based investment house.

<P>
"That's the Midwest," he added. "The ramrod, go-go, speculating style isn't the 
way we are. We're long-term investors. We probably miss some opportunities but 
we don't get trapped, either." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Findlay, like much of Middle America, seemed almost untouched by Wall 
Street's latest crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Financiers in New York and Los Angeles may have had trouble sleeping over the 
weekend, but here and elsewhere across the broad center of the nation, Friday's 
stock market dive seemed strangely out of sync with a vast majority who are 
enjoying a period of solid economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Most Midwesterners would now agree with those analysts and business leaders who 
say that the stock market, obsessed as it is with takeover rumors, no longer 
serves as an accurate barometer of the nation's economic climate. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, you read what those dummies up in New York are doing, but it's not 
something anybody's worried about," said Floyd Bhaer, a gruff, retired 
investor, as he watched the ticker at the A. G. Edwards office Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say people panic in New York far more than they do here," he added. 
"There's too much of that leveraged stuff up there. As long as you stick with 
quality, you will be all right." 
</P>
<P>
Findlay, a town of 38,000 in western Ohio, has lots of money; it is home to 
Fortune 500 corporations and has a minuscule unemployment rate. Marathon Oil, a 
subsidiary of USX, is headquartered here; so is Cooper Tire. Japanese factories 
have been rapidly setting up shop here over the past few years, providing 
plenty of new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Findlay is also conservative in the true Midwestern mold. People here 
don't throw their money around. They keep it close, or at least in a place 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
So, for most people here, the junk-bond-fueled gyrations of Wall Street remain 
a distant abstraction. 
</P>
<P>
"People in Findlay just don't seem to get shaken up by Wall Street as a general 
rule," contractor Marvin Rich said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who invest in the market do so cautiously: They dabble in blue chip 
stocks, while most of their money stays in tax-exempt bonds, certificates of 
deposit, company stock plans or cash. Local brokers say they try to discourage 
speculating in takeover stocks; there is broad displeasure here with Carl C. 
Icahn's occasional forays against USX. 
</P>
<P>
"Things like (the decline Friday) don't affect us much," noted Sterling 
Pfeiffer, a broker with Cleveland-based McDonald &amp; Co.'s office in Findlay. 
"Most of our people are long-term investors." 
</P>
<P>
So there was more bemusement than concern among Findlay's small coterie of 
investors when the market went on its wild ride. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anyone who's gotten too excited," said Howard Walker, a retired 
businessman. "I don't think you'll find much speculation here. You don't find 
people buying on margin and then getting forced to sell when the market plunges 
400 points or so. Most people here buy stock with cash." 
</P>
<P>
The calm that pervaded Findlay was reinforced by the fact that the stocks of 
Findlay's major employers, especially Cooper and USX, weathered the storm 
relatively well on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"None of them dropped nearly as much as they did two years ago" in the crash of 
October, 1987, said Lee Luff, executive vice president of the Findlay Chamber 
of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when the market recovered Monday and the nation's financial centers 
breathed a sigh of relief, Findlay simply shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard much conversation about it," developer Nick Petti said as he 
greeted Findlay civic leaders and other guests at the ground-breaking for his 
latest subdivision on the edge of town. Friday's stocks plunge "sure didn't 
affect our sales," his daughter, Michele Treece, added. "I had four families 
lined up outside the (sales) office this morning." 
</P>
<P>
As the market rose Monday afternoon, Findlay's conservative investors were 
still sitting tight. There was no rush to cash in on quick bargains. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some inquiries, but we haven't been flooded with orders," said 
Abbey, the stockbroker. "People are biting off little bits and pieces, but I 
don't see anything wrong with waiting a few days."

The dollar finished mixed in hectic U.S. trading Monday after rising on 
overseas markets early in the day in response to the rebound of the Dow Jones 
stock market index. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said a rebound in the Dow Jones industrial index was responsible for 
the dollar's improved showing in domestic trading compared to closing levels 
overseas. The dollar finished below Friday's closing levels in New York in 
relation to the West German mark, Japanese yen and Swiss franc. 
</P>
<P>
The rise in blue chip stock prices in New York, after the big selloff Friday, 
was viewed as taking some of the pressure for lower interest rates off the 
Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before the business day begins in Europe, the 
dollar fell to 140.75 yen from 144.00 yen Friday. Later, in London, the dollar 
was quoted at 141.10 yen. In New York, the dollar finished at 141.80 yen, still 
below its level of 142.05 yen Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, which rose to $1.5820 
from $1.5625 late Friday. But the pound declined in relation to the dollar in 
New York, to $1.5750 from $1.5820 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late Friday's rate, included: 
1.8680 West German marks, down from 1.8720; 1.6340 Swiss francs, down from 
1.6420.

<P>
GLOSSARY OF 'WALL STREET SPEAK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wall Street likes to speak its own language much of the time. Here is what some 
of it means: 
</P>
<P>
 Arbitrage: The attempt to make a profit on takeovers by guessing which company 
will be the next target. Also used to describe the practice of buying and 
selling comparable securities -- for instance, a stock and a stock index future 
-- and profiting on the price difference. 
</P>
<P>
Call option: An option agreement that allows an investor to buy a stock or 
other investment at a certain price during a certain period of time. The call 
buyer is speculating that the investment's price will rise. 
</P>
<P>
Computerized program trading: A type of stock trading used by big institutional 
investors that involves trading huge blocks of stocks and stock index futures. 
This kind of trading is believed to have aggravated the stock market crash of 
October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bonds: High-yield bonds that also carry high risk and, after recent market 
reverses, appear to be earning their name as companies fail to make interest 
payments. Junk bonds have been used to finance many takeovers, particularly 
leveraged buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
Leveraged buyout: Buying a company with borrowed funds that are repaid with 
cash generated by company operations or by selling parts of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Margin account: A line of credit to buy stocks, limited to 50% of the value of 
the stock. 
</P>
<P>
Margin call: A demand by a lender that an investor put up more collateral for 
securities bought on credit. 
</P>
<P>
Mutual funds: A fund managed by an investment company that raises money from 
shareholders and puts it into a variety of investments. 
</P>
<P>
Option: An agreement, arranged for a fee, to buy or sell a stock or other 
investment at a certain price for a limited time. See call option and put 
option. 
</P>
<P>
Portfolio Insurance: An investor ploy to avoid losing money by selling options 
or futures against the stock in a portfolio in hopes of offsetting price 
declines and magnifying price increases. Widely viewed as a contributor to the 
October, 1987, crash. 
</P>
<P>
Put option: An option agreement that allows an investor to sell a stock or 
other investment at a certain price during a certain period of time. The put 
buyer is speculating that the price will fall. 
</P>
<P>
Price-earnings ratio: The price of a company's stock divided by the company's 
annual earnings per share. It is an indicator of how much an investor is paying 
for a company's earnings muscle. 
</P>
<P>
Selling short: Selling borrowed stock to take advantage of an anticipated drop 
in the price. The investor hopes to buy back the stock at a lower price before 
it is time to return the securities. 
</P>
<P>
Stock index futures: Contracts to buy and sell packages of stocks for delivery 
in the future. Investors use stock index futures to speculate on where stock 
prices are going and to hedge against the market's ups and downs.

UAL STOCK OFF $56; WOLF TRIES TO REVISE BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UAL Corp. shares plunged more than $56 Monday as the airline's pilots and 
managers worked to revise their failed $6.75-billion offer for the parent of 
United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The steep drop in UAL's shares followed the announcement Friday that the 
employee group, led by UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf, had not been able to raise 
the $4.2 billion needed to buy the company. The news triggered a sharp decline 
in the stock market Friday, and UAL's shares fell $5.50 that day before trading 
was halted. UAL shares closed Monday at $222.88. 
</P>
<P>
Airline industry analysts and professional stock speculators said in interviews 
Monday that they expected the Wolf group to make a new offer for the company. 
Some said they anticipated that the new offer would be a combination of cash 
and securities worth about $240 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street traders said they believed that a new offer would emerge because 
Wolf and other top UAL officers stand to make huge profits in a takeover. The 
employee group had offered $300 a share for the company, and Wolf's UAL stock 
and options were worth around $76 million at that price. "I can't see Wolf give 
up all that profit," one trader said. 
</P>
<P>
News reports from Tokyo early this morning said several large Japanese banks 
are willing to finance the UAL transaction on new terms. The report in Nihon 
Keizai Shimbun, a Japanese business journal, said Citibank had presented eight 
large Japanese banks a revised offer that involved a lower purchase price for 
UAL shares and larger fees for the banks. 
</P>
<P>
Many banks in the United States and Japan balked at the terms for the failed 
UAL deal because they included skimpy fees for the banks and involved loading 
too much debt on the airline. At a lower price, UAL would be able to take on 
less debt to complete the transaction. Citibank and Chase Manhattan are acting 
as lead banks on the UAL deal. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report in Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Citibank said the Wolf group 
would lower its bid to $250 a share, reducing the amount it would need to 
borrow to $6.1 billion from $7.2 billion. The report also said the banks could 
raise the interest rate on the loan to 2.5% above the rate that banks charge 
each other, known as LIBOR, the London interbank offered rate. Originally, the 
rate was to be 2% above LIBOR. 
</P>
<P>
Citibank refused to comment on the report, and an adviser to United's pilots 
said there was no new deal. "If Citibank is doing that, they are feeling out 
the Japanese banks to see what is acceptable to them," said Stuart I. Oran, a 
lawyer with the New York firm of Paul Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison. 
"There is no revised deal." 
</P>
<P>
Oran said United's pilots and management had discussed various changes in the 
transaction, but he would not describe them. Oran said that the Wolf group is 
not looking for another partner. "That is one thing we have not discussed," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some airline industry analysts speculated that the Wolf group might look for 
another equity investor to make the transaction more acceptable to possible 
lenders. British Airways was to supply $750 million, more than three-quarters 
of the equity. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Hersch, an analyst with the Los Angeles investment firm of Bateman 
Eichler, Hill Richards, said it is possible that the United employees might 
recruit a partner and reduce their ownership stake to 30% from 75%. However, 
under such a scenario, United's employees would no longer control the airline, 
and "that might be an issue for United's management," Hersch said. 
</P>
<P>
Mentioned as possible investors in the UAL deal were Los Angeles investor 
Marvin Davis and Morgan Stanley, the New York investment house. Davis triggered 
the bidding for UAL in August by offering $240 a share. Davis was studying the 
situation Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said a lower bid by the Wolf group would probably mean that British 
Air could reduce its contribution. British Air said Monday that it was 
"reviewing its position" regarding the UAL bid "together with the other 
participants." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Monday, an officer with Chase Manhattan said the $300-a-share 
bid for UAL fell apart because of concerns from lenders about the fees and 
doubts about United's financial projections. Thomas G. Labreque, president and 
chief operating officer for Chase Manhattan, defended the deal. "The cash flows 
in this deal were quite good," he said.

STIFFER RULES FOR AIRLINE TAKEOVERS OKD

A House subcommittee agreed Monday to impose tough new standards on takeovers 
of major airlines after witnesses testified that the debt that accompanies 
leveraged buyouts could threaten airline safety and viability. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would give the Transportation Department authority to block an airline 
takeover if it would financially weaken the airline and jeopardize safety, 
cause a major reduction in assets or transfer control to a foreign interest. 
The bill would apply to any purchase involving at least 15% of a major 
carrier's voting stock. 
</P>
<P>
The House Public Works subcommittee on aviation passed the legislation by voice 
vote despite the objections of the Bush Administration. The bill was sent to 
the full Public Works and Transportation Committee, where approval is virtually 
certain, probably this week. 
</P>
<P>
Subcommittee members impatiently dismissed financier Donald J. Trump's 
assertion that mere consideration of the measure helped kill the pending buyout 
of UAL Inc., parent of United Airlines, last Friday, causing stocks generally 
to plunge. 
</P>
<P>
Another airline takeover -- Trump's proposed $7.5-billion buyout of AMR Corp., 
the parent company of American Airlines -- helped prompt quick action on the 
bill in Congress. However, Trump on Monday withdrew his $120-a-share offer as 
AMR's stock dropped to less than $80 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Trump indicated that he might make another proposal at a lower price. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to be intimidated by Donald Trump saying that we caused the 
downturn in the market," said Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), a key sponsor of 
the proposed new takeover restrictions, along with Rep. James L. Oberstar 
(D-Minn.), chairman of the aviation subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
The day after similar legislation was approved Oct. 5 by the Senate Commerce, 
Science and Transportation Committee, the Dow Jones industrial index and the 
associated transportation average both hovered near historic highs. 
</P>
<P>
Because of recent mergers, Oberstar said, the country's top eight airlines now 
control more than 90% of domestic air traffic. "There is a widespread feeling 
that leveraged buyouts ought to be subject to review and some degree of 
regulation so they do not jeopardize the potential for competition," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Martin Frost (D-Tex.) said takeovers "can result in debt so great that 
even the healthiest of airlines may be forced to take drastic actions, such as 
selling off assets . . . delaying or abandoning needed growth and modernization 
of its aircraft fleet, and neglecting personnel operations important to the 
safety and maintenance of the airline." 
</P>
<P>
However, a letter from Deputy Transportation Secretary Elaine L. Chao hinted at 
a veto by President Bush if the bill passes in its present form. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration "strongly opposes enactment" of the proposed legislation, 
Chao said. "The Department of Transportation currently has sufficient authority 
to act where an acquisition raises questions about an air carrier's fitness."

Coldwell Banker Sells Stock: Coldwell Banker Commercial Group said it has 
completed the sale of about $47 million worth of common stock to its employees, 
bringing employee ownership in the commercial brokerage to more than 40%. The 
price of the stock was $10 a share. A group of employees and outside investors 
bought the company in April for about $300 million from Sears, Roebuck &amp; 
Co. The company said money raised from the sale would be used in several ways, 
including for working capital and to pay back loans from Sears.

Prosperous Decade Forecast: The 1990s should be more prosperous as the result 
of new economic competition, according to the new First Interstate Bancorp 
Economic Forecast. "Competition among the Untied States, a much more unified 
Europe, Japan and the newly industrializing economies of Asia will promote 
economic growth," according to Jerry Jordan, senior vice president and chief 
economist. He added that the U.S. economy is likely to weaken in the latter 
part of 1989, with softness spilling over into early 1990. California's growth 
rate will also be reduced due to the national slowdown and a decline in defense

Lots of Christmas Trees: Despite the preference of many Americans for 
artificial Christmas trees, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is expecting a 
bumper year for Christmas tree farmers. A record 34.3 million Christmas trees 
were sold in 1988; this year, the USDA expects the market to exceed 35 million.

PERSONALITY: NEW CEO AT OFFICE AUTOMATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joel Shusterman has been appointed president at Office Automation Systems, a 
San Diego-based laser printer manufacturer. He replaces Peter M. Steiner, who 
recently resigned to pursue a business opportunity in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Shusterman, 51, comes to Office Automation with more than 20 years of 
experience in the computer industry. After earning an electrical engineering 
degree from Drexel University in Philadelphia, he got his first job with 
Philco, designing circuits. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Shusterman was vice president of marketing with Commodore 
Business Machines. He has also held management positions with Burroughs Corp., 
Sanders Associates and General Electric. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, at the beginning of the personal computer industry, Shusterman 
co-founded Franklin Computer Corp. and came out with a series of computers 
closely emulating the Apple personal computer. By 1984, Franklin was ranked the 
nation's seventh-largest personal computer company. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Computer Reseller News named Shusterman among the 25 most influential 
people in the computer industry. "It was the same month Franklin pushed me 
out," Shusterman recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the irony of this business," he said. "As CEO at Franklin, I thought 
that success would be measured by great revenues and large profits, but that's 
not always the case." 
</P>
<P>
Shusterman says he looks forward to working with the staff at Office Automation 
and is impressed by the existing talent. "This company is really like a 
well-constructed ship sitting in the middle of an ocean that just doesn't have 
the head of steam," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The ship is sound, but it was drifting, it had no direction," he said. "I have 
to aim the company where its strengths are. One of my major functions is to 
find that formula for success." 
</P>
<P>
From his early days working in the home radio laboratory at Philco, Shusterman 
has developed a love of old radios from the 1920s and '30s, and he spends much 
of his spare time restoring them. He is also an avid history buff. CAROLINE

SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan, a Van Nuys-based thrift, said Imperial 
Corp. of America withdrew its application to buy five Valley Federal branch 
offices in the San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial, the San Diego-based parent of Imperial Savings &amp; Loan, withdrew 
its application from the federal Office of Thrift Supervision because Imperial 
Savings is not yet in compliance with certain requirements of the Community 
Reinvestment Act, said Imperial spokesman Tim Larrick. 
</P>
<P>
The act requires S&amp;Ls to lend money in amounts related to areas where 
deposits are received. Imperial is taking steps to meet the criteria under the 
act, and it might resubmit its application to buy the Valley Federal branches, 
Imperial said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed sale was first announced in August. Terms were not disclosed, but 
Valley Federal said the sale would enable it to save about $2 million in 
operating costs a year.

REDKEN SUBSIDIARY OFFERS HAIR PRODUCTS WITH GLACIER WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There seems to be something about the grandeur of glaciers that makes 
entrepreneurs think big. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, a Saudi Arabian prince proposed hauling glaciers and 
icebergs to drought-ravaged countries in the Middle East. Nothing happened with 
that idea. More recently a couple of companies have begun bottling and selling 
melted glacier water, touting the freshness and purity of the water to the 
Perrier generation. Another firm ships plastic bags of glacier ice cubes to 
Japan and makes vodka using glacier water. 
</P>
<P>
And now Redken Laboratories, the big Canoga Park hair care products company, is 
bankrolling a fledgling company called Alaska Glacier Products that sells a 
line of shampoos and hair conditioners containing none other than Alaskan 
glacier water. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Glacier vice president Neil Wallach said, "Glacial water is the freshest 
water on the planet," and so is ideal for shampoos and the like since it 
doesn't junk up the hair with chemicals and minerals found in other water. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics could say the only thing fresh about glacier water in shampoos is the 
gimmick. But then John Sebastian, president of the Woodland Hills-based hair 
care company Sebastian International, says gimmicks are what make or break hair 
care companies. "Everyone is going to have what is called in the industry a 
'hook' or a 'handle' -- something that's going to make their products much more 
appealing than other products." 
</P>
<P>
In the fiercely competitive $4.5-billion a year hair care products industry, 
shampoo peddlers use anything they can to to distinguish themselves, as 
companies vie for customers who are as loyal to shampoos as they are to this 
year's fashions. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Glacier's new line of products, called Glacial Fresh, has been available 
in beauty supply shops since June and Wallach expects the company to break even 
or turn a small profit in the fiscal year that ends July 31, on sales of about 
$1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
But is being different enough to make it in the hair care business? 
</P>
<P>
At Art Spector Beauty and Barber Supply in Sepulveda, there are dozens of 
exotic products available. "Everyone has a gimmick," said co-owner Marilyn 
Spector, who isn't carrying the Glacial Fresh line. "One has papaya from New 
Zealand. One has molecular or nucleic protein. There's lots of new ones that 
come out and very few of them make it." 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Abramovitz, manager of Sunshine Beauty Supply in Canoga Park, is carrying 
Glacial Fresh, but says the new line hasn't sold well yet. She keeps a close 
eye on this sort of thing and if a product doesn't sell, she puts something 
else on the shelf. "I rotate, rotate, rotate," she said. Some shampoos she 
sells contain concoctions such as "golden seal root," "a botanically fortified 
polymeric acid balanced pH3 keratin enhancer" and a "Belgian formula." 
</P>
<P>
Sunshine was among the first of the 800 beauty supply stores that handle 
Glacial Fresh, but Abramovitz believes a new series of advertisements in People 
magazine will help boost sales. "Advertising is the key," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Glacier's ad budget isn't setting Madison Avenue on fire. So far it has 
spent about $50,000 on trade ads and $100,000 on consumer ads, Wallach said. 
That's not much compared to the multimillion-dollar ad budgets of the large 
hair care companies. 
</P>
<P>
But then Alaska Glacier is something of a marketing departure for Redken 
Laboratories, which has more than $120 million in annual sales, and is the 
largest manufacturer and distributor of hair care products sold in beauty 
salons. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Redken has zealously cultivated its status as a supplier of upscale 
products sold only in hair salons. But Alaska Glacier will be sold only through 
beauty supply stores -- another fast-growing segment of the hair care market 
that sells to the public and to professional hair stylists. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Geller, a consultant specializing in cosmetics and toiletries at the 
market research firm Kline &amp; Co. in Fairfield, N.J., says this could be a 
risky move for Redken. "If they're not careful about merchandising the two 
lines separately, they run the danger of denigrating their history with the 
salon." Redken's name, though, doesn't appear on the boxes of Glacier Fresh, 
and Alaska Glacier stresses that Redken's other products are still marketed 
solely to salons. 
</P>
<P>
There are now about 7,000 beauty supply shops in the United States and they 
sell anything from the cheap drugstore brands to the pricey salon products. At 
$4.99 for each nine-ounce bottle, the Glacial Fresh line is far from the most 
expensive of hair care products on the market, but it's not bargain-basement 
either. 
</P>
<P>
"In the overall scheme of things, it's a relatively expensive product line," 
Wallach said. But he hopes to cash in on the increasing focus on the 
environment, and maintained that the products will have strong appeal to 
consumers who eschew man-made chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Redken, which was taken private last year in a leveraged buyout by founder 
Paula Kent Meehan and her husband John E. Meehan, won't divulge the size of its 
investment in Alaska Glacier. But the new company's offices are located at 
Redken's Canoga Park headquarters and its products are formulated and 
manufactured by Redken. And there's more than just glacier water; the shampoo 
also contains juniper, heather, mistletoe and flaxseed to underscore the 
natural theme. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Glacier is the brainchild of Rick Thornton, an Anchorage hair care 
products distributor and glacier buff. About two years ago, Thornton, who 
describes himself as "a country boy from Alaska," heard about Wetco, an 
Anchorage company that was selling two-pound bags of glacier ice cubes in Japan 
for $7. "That struck a chord in me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska's glaciers are scattered over thousands of miles of pristine wilderness, 
and Thornton thought that if he could combine his hair care business with the 
appeal of the glaciers he'd have a unique product. "I wanted to have a story 
that no one else has," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After some research, Thornton, who is Alaska Glacier's president, approached 
Redken with the idea. Wallach, a 28-year industry veteran of such firms as 
Clairol and Windmere, joined Alaska Glacier in August. The company's only other 
full-time employee is business manager Jeanette Corum, who used to work for 
Redken. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Glacier's water is harvested by Wetco, which sends workers out on boats 
to lasso huge hunks of ice that have broken off from the Eklutna Glacier, 30 
miles north of Anchorage. The ice is melted and put in tanks, which are loaded 
onto a barge and shipped to Seattle, where the tanks are transferred to trucks 
for the long ride to Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, Alaska Glacier is different. "This is the first time I've ever 
heard of a company with Alaska glacier water," said Geller. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wallach talks of his company's sales growing to $5 million or more 
within five years, he still has a long way to travel till he gets to that 
plateau. Still, he's convinced that glacier water will become a magic marketing 
ingredient. 
</P>
<P>
"There's absolutely no doubt in my mind you'll see another product come out 
with glacier water," he said. "If you look at the leaders in the market today, 
they've all been copycatted. I think there's a certain wonderful posturing in 
being first."

VALLEY ROUNDUP: WEST COAST DEALER SERVICES ACQUIRED BY INCOMNET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Incomnet, a Westlake Village operator of a computerized auto-parts network, 
said it completed the acquisition of West Coast Dealer Services, also of 
Westlake Village, for an undisclosed amount of cash, debt and equity. 
</P>
<P>
Sam D. Schwartz, Incomnet's president, said the acquisition doubles the size of 
Incomnet and links the company with another network that trades more than $100 
million worth of auto parts a year. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition will add about $2 million a year in revenue to Incomnet, and 
will lead to combined 1990 revenues of about $7 million and income of $2 
million, Schwartz said. He also said the purchase would allow Incomnet to 
expand its services to car dealers and auto service contract companies.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES TO POST 4TH-QUARTER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traditional Industries Inc., an Agoura Hills firm that markets camera and film 
processing packages, said it expects to report a loss for the fiscal fourth 
quarter. Meanwhile, the company said its financial report for the fiscal year 
that ended June 30 has been delayed, and it expects to report its results 
within 45 days. The delay was partly caused by the settlement Traditional 
recently reached with the Federal Trade Commission, which alleged that the 
company made false claims in advertising its photographic packages. 
</P>
<P>
The FTC said in August that Traditional could lose up to $50 million in sales 
as the cost of complying with the agreement. Traditional said the impact would 
actually be far less than that, although the company also said it was seeking 
new financing alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate matter, a group led by the New York investment concern Allen 
Holding Inc., cut its stake in Traditional to 54,378 common shares of stock, or 
1.5% of the company's total, according to a filing with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. The group, which includes Allen's executive vice president 
Harold M. Wit, previously held the equivalent of a 7.6% stake in Traditional.

Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan, a Van Nuys-based thrift, said Imperial Corp. 
of America withdrew its application to buy five Valley Federal branch offices 
in the San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial, the San Diego-based parent of Imperial Savings &amp; Loan, withdrew 
its application from the federal Office of Thrift Supervision because Imperial 
Savings is not yet in compliance with certain requirements of the Community 
Reinvestment Act, said Imperial spokesman Tim Larrick.

The act requires S&amp;Ls to lend money in amounts related to areas where

Imperial said.

The proposed sale was first announced in August. Terms were not disclosed, but

VALLEY ROUNDUP: COMPANY WILL CLOSE REFINERY IN SANTA CLARITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newhall Refining Co., which operates an oil refinery in Santa Clarita, said it 
plans to suspend operations by year's end, resulting in the layoff of about 70 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall Refining, a unit of Pauley Petroleum of Los Angeles, said about 15 of 
its 86 employees will be offered jobs at Pauley's other refining unit, Fletcher 
Oil &amp; Refining Co. in Carson. The rest will be laid off, it said. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita refinery has suffered losses in recent years, and future 
demand for the refinery's products -- mostly liquid asphalt, fuel oil and jet 
fuel -- appear "unlikely to reach sufficient levels to justify a resumption of 
operations in the near future," Newhall Refining said.

The body of deposed Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos was laid to rest 
in a temporary mausoleum in a tree-lined memorial park in Honolulu at a service 
attended by more than 1,000 mourners. Imelda Marcos, clutching a rosary, sang 
"Ave Maria" and "Our Father" while her son, Ferdinand E. Marcos Jr., stood at 
the casket. Marcos' daughter, Irene Araneta, criticized Philippine President 
Corazon Aquino for refusing to allow Marcos to be buried in his homeland. The 
family has vowed not to bury Marcos, who died Sept. 28 after a long illness, in 
Hawaii.

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi met briefly 
in Matruh, Egypt, and agreed that citizens of the two longtime foes will be 
allowed to travel freely across their common border. After the meeting, Kadafi 
called Mubarak his brother and said the conference has restored his hope that 
Arabs could unify in the face of "external threats."

The U.S. Forest Service plans to triple the amount of logging in the Tahoe 
Basin next year in an effort to clear an estimated one out of five dead and 
dying fir trees in the Sierra Nevada, officials said. Three years of drought 
and an ongoing attack by the fir engraver beetle have wiped out large sections 
of forest and speckled the once-emerald-green basin with brown trees. "Look at 
any hillside and 10% to 100% of the trees are dead in any given area," said the 
Forest Service's John Swanson in South Lake Tahoe. "There are well over 50 
million board-feet in the Tahoe Basin that are dead or dying trees. They may 
look alive but they aren't."

A drug used for more than a decade to treat psoriasis is preventing and halting 
the rejection of transplanted organs in animals, a Stanford University 
researcher said. The compound will be tested on human transplant patients 
pending approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said Dr. Randall 
Morris, director of Stanford's laboratory for transplant immunology. The drug 
mycophenolic acid inhibits the formation of DNA, critical in the growth of skin 
lesions common to psoriasis. Researchers altered mycophenolic acid to make it 
more easily absorbed by the body. In its altered form, it defuses the DNA 
process required for white blood cells to attack transplanted organs, Morris 
said.

The California Highway Patrol is starting to inspect commercial truck terminals 
this week under new vehicle safety standards, Commissioner Maury Hannigan said 
in Sacramento. The inspections were to begin this past summer under 1988 
legislation, but the CHP held up enforcement because of several questions about 
the statute that were clarified in subsequent legislation. Under the program, 
commercial truck terminals are to be inspected at least once every two years. 
Penalties range from fines to suspension or revocation of operating authority 
for carriers that fail to meet standards.

GIANTS GO TO ROBINSON WITH BARELY LEG TO STAND ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The man chosen to rescue the San Francisco Giants was wandering behind the 
batting cage Monday when he spied a former Giant star. He grinned, grabbed a 
bat, and poked at the man from behind. 
</P>
<P>
Say hey. It's not everybody who would tease Willie Mays. 
</P>
<P>
"Don Robinson," explained teammate Mike Krukow, "is our caveman." 
</P>
<P>
By taking the Candlestick Park mound this afternoon at 5:30 against the Oakland 
Athletics in Game 3 of the World Series, Robinson has come to the right place. 
His Giants are trailing, two games to none. They have been outscored, 10-1. 
They have been out-hit, 18-9. Neither of their two starting pitchers has lasted 
more than four innings. 
</P>
<P>
And those aren't even the most telling statistics. This one is: No team has 
trailed, 3-0, in games and come back to win a seven-game World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Today, more than anything spectacular, the Giants just need to come up with a 
good reason to continue playing. It may take something fearless, something 
senseless, something that does not play by society's established rules that the 
better team -- in this case, Oakland -- should win. 
</P>
<P>
It may take somebody with a heavy stubble, most of whose 235 pounds are in his 
belly and who can barely run. A guy who was found in the Giants' clubhouse 
after the loss in Game 1 exhorting his teammates to cheer during a televised 
college football game. A guy who, when he takes batting practice, gets in as 
many loud insults as swings. 
</P>
<P>
It may take a caveman. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm your guy," Robinson drawled in an accent carved from the West Virginia 
hills. "Give me the ball, man." 
</P>
<P>
Giant Manager Roger Craig will do that, pitting Robinson against an Oakland 
pitcher -- Bob Welch -- who has a 6-0 lifetime record in Candlestick Park and 
has a lifetime record of 19-4 against the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"When the game begins, that stuff doesn't matter," said Welch, a former Dodger. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson has never faced the A's in a regular-season game. Because of his 
chronically sore right knee, he didn't face many National League teams at the 
end of this season either. His four September starts numbered just one more 
than his September cortisone injections. 
</P>
<P>
His knee is so bad that he wears a brace underneath his pants that Krukow says 
is not a brace. "It's a Lawn Boy," Krukow said. 
</P>
<P>
His knee is so bad that he is not thinking about today in terms of a complete 
game or a shutout. He just wants to be in there long enough so the patrons of 
Robby's, his restaurant-bar in Huntington, W. Va., can still be watching him 
when their chicken wings arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to get through the first inning, and I'll be fine," said Robinson, 
who missed his only scheduled playoff start against the Chicago Cubs because of 
the knee. "I want to be able to stay out there long enough so those people can 
get in there and get their seats and still see me pitch." 
</P>
<P>
And yet he is being entrusted with this game, against this A's team that thus 
far has turned this World Series into a Giant world of hurt and embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
What has gotten into Manager Roger Craig? Having no luck in improving his 
team's statistics so far, he apparently is trying to give them some emotion. 
</P>
<P>
During a season in which he went 12-11 with a 3.43 earned-run average despite 
the knee, five times Robinson was given the ball with the Giants clinging to a 
2 1/2-game lead, or less. All five times, he won. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a lot of pitchers on this staff with a lot of heart, but if I have to 
take one for a big game, Robby is the one," Craig said. "No offense to the 
other guys, but it's like when you are going into battle. You want one general, 
one leader, and he's our guy." 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Robby Thompson agreed. "The guy is a warrior," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And an honest one. After Robinson's encounter with Mays during Monday's 
workout, the Hall of Fame center fielder asked him how he felt. 
</P>
<P>
"My arm hurts, man," said Robinson, 32, who has undergone six types of surgery. 
"My shoulder is also killing me. My back is killing me. And my knee." 
</P>
<P>
Then he laughed and thought back to his only World Series appearance, when he 
allowed three runs in five relief innings for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been telling all the young guys on this club to cherish the moment," 
Robinson said. "I remember when I got in the Series with Pittsburgh, I thought, 
'Heck, I'll be back three of four more times.' And now look how long it's taken 
me. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them, 'Have fun, because it ain't that easy.' " 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't Craig know it. Applying to the lineup card the same sense of 
desperation evident in his team's face, he announced three changes. He will 
replace right fielder Candy Maldonado with Pat Sheridan, move third baseman 
Matt Williams to shortstop in place of Jose Uribe, and bring in pinch-hitting 
star Ken Oberkfell to play third base. 
</P>
<P>
He will be hurting himself defensively, particularly with Williams' limited 
range. But since Maldonado and Uribe are a combined one for 11 this series, 
Craig figures he has no choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to do something," he said. "So I'm sacrificing more defense to get 
some more offense in there." 
</P>
<P>
That offense should be further helped by Robinson, who, well, let him tell you. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's a better hitting pitcher in baseball," said Robinson, 
who has hit three home runs, one more than third baseman Oberkfell. In his 
13-year career, he is hitting .253 with 11 homers and 57 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"That's really all I've been thinking about, finally getting a chance to hit in 
a World Series," he said. "I want to be out there long enough to get an at-bat. 
I just want to get up once." 
</P>
<P>
If the Giants' bad luck continues, Robinson could end up out-hitting this 
postseason's most powerful hitter, Giant first baseman Will Clark. That is 
because Clark has been hit with what is normally a children's illness, 
tonsillitis. He played with it in Game 2 Sunday and went hitless in four 
at-bats, and then did not work out Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Although he had general malaise . . . he felt a lot better today," Giant 
trainer Mark Letendre said. 
</P>
<P>
The A's have become so confident that their only certain lineup switch today 
will mean that a player with a home run and a Series-leading three RBIs will be 
benched for a player making his first Series appearance. 
</P>
<P>
No, Manager Tony La Russa would not explain why Ron Hassey will replace Terry 
Steinbach. A good guess might be that Hassey helped Welch make the switch to 
the American League last season, and caught 31 of his 33 starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
La Russa would only say that talking to his team about being overconfident 
would not be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"We've watched the Giants all year, we know they can bounce back and play 
tough," La Russa said. "We have never taken anything for granted. So, we are 
going to be very ready to win tomorrow, and if someone beats us, we'll take our 
hat off to him."

DODGERS RESPOND TO NEW RULE, REASSIGN COACHES MOTA, FERGUSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers have announced their response to an impending baseball rule that 
would limit teams to five coaches by reassigning batting and first base coach 
Manny Mota and dugout coach Joe Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
Mota will handle various special assignments throughout the organization, while 
Ferguson will simply move from the dugout to the press box, where he will 
resume his old job as the Dodgers eye in the sky, aligning Dodger defenses. 
</P>
<P>
"Manny Mota is an important contributor to the Dodger organization and his new 
position will enable us to use his talents in several areas," said Executive 
Vice President Fred Claire, who added that Ferguson will be working the 
defenses just as he did in the dugout, only he won't be in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Batting coach Ben Hines is the likely replacement for Mota as the first base 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers have also announced that longtime Cleveland Indian scout Gary 
Sutherland was joining the organization as a special assignment scout, 
replacing Steve Boros, who was recently named assistant minor league field 
coordinator.

CRAIG KNOWS WHO TO BLAME IF GIANTS LOSE 
</P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A tricky pitch, that split-fingered fastball. Even when you've got it mastered, 
you're never really quite sure what turn it might take next. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Craig knows. The acknowledged guru of the split-finger, the man who took 
the pitch and gave it to the masses, has seen all his ground-breaking work come 
back and betray his San Francisco Giants during the first two games of the 1989 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stewart couldn't keep a job in the major leagues before coverting to the 
Church of the Split-Finger. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has won 62 games in three seasons and used the pitch Saturday 
night to shut out the Giants, 5-0, in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Moore was a pitcher of untapped potential with a 65-96 career record 
before he came to Oakland and was introduced to the split-finger this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Six months later, he's a 19-game winner and a World Series Game 2 winner, 
throwing seven innings' worth of split-fingered fastballs past the Giants 
Sunday night en route to a 5-1 Oakland victory. 
</P>
<P>
Oh mighty split-finger, what hath thou wrought? 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you could say it's come back to haunt us," Craig said during the 
Giants' off-day workout at Candlestick Park Monday. "It's the pitch that's been 
called the Pitch of the 80s and, even more so, it's going to be the pitch of 
the 90s. Now, more people are learning to throw it because of the success so 
many people have had with it." 
</P>
<P>
Craig insists he didn't invent the pitch, which is basically a forkball thrown 
with a fastball delivery. The Einstein of the split-finger, according to Craig, 
is Fred Martin, the late pitching coach of the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the one who taught it to Bruce Sutter," Craig said. "That's where it 
started. If I did anything, it was to come up with a simple way to teach it." 
</P>
<P>
Craig broke in his method at his baseball school in San Diego, teaching the 
pitch to 16- and 17-year olds, before taking his findings to the Detroit 
Tigers, where Craig was employed as pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1984, the Tigers won the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
By 1985, Craig was named manager of the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
By 1987, he had his whole staff throwing the pitch and San Francisco made the 
playoffs for the first time in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
Split-finger fever swept the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when Gene Mauch was managing the Angels and he told me, 'I don't 
know if any of our guys can throw it, but they're all going to try,' " Craig 
said. "Now, the Angels have several pitchers who throw a good split-finger." 
</P>
<P>
So, to Craig's immediate chagrin, do the A's. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart first learned the pitch from Sandy Koufax when he was with the Dodgers, 
but didn't perfect it until he joined Oakland in 1986. Moore picked it up this 
spring from A's pitching coach Dave Duncan, almost on a whim. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of came by accident," Moore says. "I was sitting on the bench, 
stretching my fingers over a ball, when Dave Duncan comes over and asks me if I 
ever threw (a split-finger) before. I told him no, but we started fooling 
around with it in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
"A few starts into the season, I began throwing it in games. Then, I threw it 
more and more as the season progressed." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Moore is among the leading practitioners of the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"I know a lot of guys came back here and said that Moore's got one of the best 
they've ever seen," said San Francisco pitcher Don Robinson, who, of course, 
also throws one. 
</P>
<P>
And so does Bob Welch, Oakland's scheduled starter for Game 3 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Will the madness ever cease? Craig can only wonder. 
</P>
<P>
And if it results this week in the World Series elimination of the Giants, 
Craig knows who'll have to answer for it. 
</P>
<P>
One Way To Shut Him Up: Stricken by a case of tonsillitis, San Francisco first 
baseman Will Clark didn't participate in Monday's workout, although he did show 
up at Candlestick Park briefly to undergo therapy on his sore knee. 
</P>
<P>
"We also changed his medication for his tonsillitis," Giant trainer Mark 
Letendre reported. "Although he had a general malaise -- and that's not 
somebody who was in the French Revolution -- he felt a lot better today." 
</P>
<P>
According to Craig, Game 3 won't go on without Clark. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm managing, or even if I'm not managing, he'll be at first base," Craig 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After going hitless in seven at-bats in the first two games at Oakland, Candy 
Maldonado is out as Craig's right fielder and Pat Sheridan is in. 
</P>
<P>
It's the latest downward spin in a season Maldonado says "I wouldn't wish on 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Maldonado, who batted just .217 with nine home runs and 41 runs batted in 
during the regular season, lost his starting job in May, platooned with 
Sheridan through August and then served primarily as a pinch-hitter and 
defensive replacement for the last six weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts," Maldonado said of his Game 3 benching. "All year long, you get on 
your knees, hoping and praying to do your best in times like this." 
</P>
<P>
Maldonado fell short of that against Stewart and Moore, but believes he's been 
made a scapegoat for San Francisco's overall offensive drought thus far in the 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time, it seems like right field is the position that (supposedly) costs 
us the game," Maldonado said. "They keep bringing it back -- if we lose a 
ballgame, it's because the right fielder didn't hit. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like it's been a one-man show all year. It could be myself, it could 
be Pat, it could be whoever's out there. It seems like we're always the focus. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it seems like the World Series focus has been 'Candy Maldonado -- 
what's he going to do?' " 
</P>
<P>
The last time the Giants made the playoffs, in 1987, Maldonado was an integral 
part of the San Francisco attack, batting .292 with 20 home runs and 85 RBIs. 
Now, he gets benched because the Giants need more offense -- and gets replaced 
by a .205 hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of those things people don't realize about pro athletes," 
Maldonado said. "If a pro athlete doesn't perform to his capabilities, we're 
human beings, too. We're not a computer. You can't program us -- 'Do this, do 
that.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's not fun when you take your uniform off and go home and see your kids and 
your wife and try to be happy. When you're not successful in your job, it's 
tough." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, however, Maldonado says it's time for "all of us to pull on the same 
side of the rope. I didn't do the job. Hopefully, they've found the right man. 
I hoping Pat can do the job." 
</P>
<P>
Although this World Series has taken on the early look of a foregone 
conclusion, San Francisco center fielder Brett Butler insists that the return 
to Candlestick will make an immeasurable difference for the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, it puts (Dave) Parker on the bench and we'll get (the wind) to come out 
and make it cold and windy," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
Parker is the Oakland designated hitter who will not be in the Oakland lineup 
tonight because they play by National League rules tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The frigid wind that whips through Candlestick Park during night games turns 
the stadium into the world's largest ice box. 
</P>
<P>
"You better concentrate on every pitch in every inning here, or (the wind) is 
gonna get you," Butler says. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember coming in here when I was with the (Atlanta) Braves. I never liked 
playing here. You know it's going to be cold and windy and you're always 
thinking, 'Three days and I'm getting out of here.' 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we try to use it to our advantage. As the home team, we know what they 
are thinking. They're saying, 'How can you play here? It stinks.' 
</P>
<P>
"I hear that and I love it."

BATTLE FOR BAY AREA SUPREMACY EXTENDS FARTHER THAN FIELD; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIA: THE WORLD SERIES IS VERY BIG NEWS, SO THE NEWSPAPERS AND TV AND RADIO 
STATIONS ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THE TYPE OF COVERAGE THEY PROVIDE.

<P>
There's more than one Battle of the Bay up in these parts. 
</P>
<P>
Of course there's the one between the Athletics and Giants, which has changed 
fronts and continues today on the west side of the San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
That battle might have fizzled somewhat, but there's another one that remains 
fierce -- the battle among the Bay Area media outlets. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay's Ball World Series, or rather the Snoozer Ball Series, as some are now 
calling it, remains big news. 
</P>
<P>
The A's have been here before, the Raiders won two Super Bowls when they were 
in Oakland, the 49ers have won three Super Bowls, including one played down the 
road in Palo Alto, and, back in 1975, even the Warriors won a National 
Basketball Assn. championship. 
</P>
<P>
But when you're talking about big stories in San Francisco, it's hard to top 
the A's and Giants playing in the same World Series. 
</P>
<P>
So Bay Area TV, radio and newspapers are serious about this Series. 
</P>
<P>
You turn on a TV and you see Series reports. You turn on the radio, and get 
more of the same. And the newspapers seem to have all the bases covered, and 
then some. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the area newspapers have special World Series sections. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Chronicle's World Series Extra, as it is called, was 16 pages 
Monday. The regular sports section was 11 pages. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers and Hershel Walker dominated the front of the Chronicle's regular 
sports section. There was a picture of Wayne Gretzky at the bottom of Page 1, 
but the story of his record-breaking night was played on Page 8. 
</P>
<P>
On the front page of the Chronicle's main news section, the World Series got a 
four-column headline, two stories and a big picture. The state of the stock 
market, meanwhile, got a two-column headline. 
</P>
<P>
The main front page of the San Francisco Examiner also gave the Series 
four-column play and the stock market a two-column headline. 
</P>
<P>
The Examiner had three sports sections -- an 18-page World Series section, a 
nine-page Sports Monday section and another nine-page section that had more 
Series stories and other sports as well. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's record got a one-column headline at the top of Page 1 of the 
Examiner's Sports Monday section. 
</P>
<P>
As for television coverage, KGO, the Bay Area's ABC affiliate, is naturally 
doing the most, since ABC is televising the Series. 
</P>
<P>
The station has a cast of thousands, or so it seems, working special pre- and 
postgame shows. Joe Morgan has been a regular and Willie Mays will be in the 
KGO studio after Wednesday's game. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other people besides KGO sportscasters and reporters who are 
appearing or will appear are former A's pitcher Steve McCatty, former Giant 
pitcher Mike McCormick, former outfielder Billy North, who played for both the 
Giants and A's, stat freak and fantasy league guru Bill James, and 
sportswriters Leonard Koppett and Glenn Dickey. 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, KGO overlooked Tom Lasorda. Who can forget the job he did with 
KNBC's Fred Roggin during last year's World Series? 
</P>
<P>
KGO offers the only game telecasts, but there are no fewer than five choices of 
radio broadcasts, two of them in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Just spin the dial and pick a number. At 560 AM is KSFO, the A's flagship 
station, with Bill King, Lon Simmons and Ray Fosse. 
</P>
<P>
King, however, missed Game 2 Sunday. Seems his contract with the Raiders puts 
the football team first, so he was at the L.A. Coliseum for the Raiders' game 
with the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
At 680 AM is KNBR, the Giants' station with Hank Greenwald and Ron Fairly, the 
former Angel announcer. 
</P>
<P>
At 740 AM is KCBS with Jack Buck and Johnny Bench of CBS radio. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anything like this has happened since 1956," said KCBS program 
director Ed Cavagnaro, referring to the year the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York 
Yankees played in the last all-metro Series. 
</P>
<P>
The smorgasbord of Series broadcasts may be a treat for the fans, but not 
necessarily for the stations. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, some loyal Bay Area fans may turn down the sound on their TV and listen 
to their favorite team's announcers. But since the ABC trio of Al Michaels, Tim 
McCarver and Jim Palmer is generally well liked, that practice probably isn't 
too common. 
</P>
<P>
And, besides, Michaels was once a Giant announcer himself and still has a 
pretty good following here. 
</P>
<P>
So after commuters get home from work and out of their cars, the radio stations 
probably lose most of their audiences. 
</P>
<P>
KNBR program director Bob Agnew told the Chronicle that he would be happy if 
his station ended up getting the same number of listeners it gets for a 
regular-season Giant game. "And I'd be ecstatic if we are higher," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Agnew figures KNBR is probably beating the competition. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bay Area is primarily a Giants town," he said. "The A's still haven't 
captured the hearts of Bay Area fans like the Giants." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hamilton, KSFO programming boss, said he expected both stations to do very 
well. 
</P>
<P>
KSFO's advantage, Hamilton said, is the play-by-play experience of King and 
Simmons, who have been on the Bay Area airwaves since the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest ratings book, according to the Chronicle's Tom Gilmore, KNBR 
averaged a 5 rating for all its programming, up from a 3.5 for the previous 
ratings period, while KFSO went from a 2.4 to a 2.9. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers suggest that KNBR benefited considerably more from the Giants' 
pennant drive than KSFO did from the A's stretch run. 
</P>
<P>
Still, KSFO was confident enough to consider also putting its game broadcasts 
on its FM sister station, KYA. But the station was turned down by major league 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
If that had come to pass, listeners could have heard King screaming "Holy 
Toledo" in stereo. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Bay Area radio stations, KCBS is facing the toughest challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a couple of things we have going for us," said KCBS' Cavagnaro. "One 
is the curiosity factor. We think people are switching stations during games to 
get a different perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Cavagnaro pointed out, his station offers two nationally known announcers 
in Buck and Bench. Bench, in particular, has been outstanding during the 
playoffs and Series. 
</P>
<P>
KCBS, like the other stations, also thinks it is drawing listeners with strong 
lead-in programming, such as live reports from Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
All the stations are using a squadron of reporters, including some former and 
current ballplayers. 
</P>
<P>
The KCBS crew includes Giant catcher Brenley, who was left off the Giants' 
postseason roster, and A's shortstop Walt Weiss. KNBR is using injured Giant 
pitcher Mike Krukow. 
</P>
<P>
The way Cavagnaro sees it, KCBS can't help but benefit from an all-Bay Area 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the magnitude of the Series, it has to help -- if not during the 
games then for our programming during the rest of the day," he said. "We're a 
news station and this is our biggest story." 
</P>
<P>
He won't get much argument there.

<P>
The unfortunate aspect of this Battle of the Bay is that it must bridge two 
more games. You can talk about the beauty of the suspension spans here, but not 
the suspense of the 86th World Series. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Athletics have clearly demonstrated that they are the deeper, 
dominant team. They have returned from last year's collapse against the Dodgers 
with a missionary zeal. Intense but controlled. 
</P>
<P>
Their theme blares over the PA system at the Oakland Coliseum. You expect "Take 
Me Out to the Ballgame" during the seventh inning stretch but get "Takin' Care 
of Business" instead. 
</P>
<P>
And how! 
</P>
<P>
A 10-1 advantage in runs. A .277 to .150 advantage in batting average. A 0.50 
to 5.06 advantage in earned-run average. A 2-0 Series lead that makes Games 3 
and 4 appear to be formalities. 
</P>
<P>
Even Terry Kennedy, the San Francisco Giants' catcher, displayed a trace of 
resignation as he reflected on the A's and said: "You can almost see how 
they've learned their lesson from last year. I don't know what their mind set 
is, but it seems obvious the experience taught them something." 
</P>
<P>
Cautiously, A's manager Tony LaRussa, stoking the fire still, says, "We've 
smelled this for a long time and played ourselves into a good position, but 
this is no time to back off." 
</P>
<P>
History shows that 10 of the 39 teams that took a 2-0 Series lead failed to 
protect it, including the 1985 St. Louis Cardinals and 1986 Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the A's loss of Dave Parker under the postseason's ridiculous 
designated hitter restrictions will hurt more than the Giants' loss of Ernest 
Riles. 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, there's a possibility that the Candlestick Park winds will destroy 
the A's professionalism, that all those airborne hot dog wrappers will have 
more impact than the hotdog himself, Rickey Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Forget it. Even with those considerations in mind -- even at the risk of 
ignoring those 2-0 precedents -- this Series seems to be history, and the only 
real questions deal with how history will rank these A's. 
</P>
<P>
Do we finally have another dynasty here? 
</P>
<P>
Is a dynasty even possible amid the free-agent parity and economic 
considerations now prevalent in the sport? 
</P>
<P>
Said Sandy Alderson, the A's general manager: 
</P>
<P>
"By and large, our club is relatively young at most positions, if not all. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the kind of experience we want both in the rotation and the role of 
bullpen closer. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't use the word dynasty, but I'm confident we'll remain competitive 
during the near future. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, our division (American League West) gets stronger every year. Being 
competitive may mean you finish fourth." 
</P>
<P>
In the context of the last decade, the A's have already established something 
of a dynasty. They are the first to have won consecutive pennants since the New 
York Yankees of 1977 and '78. Their 203 regular-season victories -- 99 this 
year while beset by injuries -- are the most by any American League team in 
consecutive seasons since the Baltimore Orioles won 209 in 1970 and '71. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Mets won 206 games in 1985 and '86, but their total of 213, 
including postseason play, has already been eclipsed by the A's, who have won 
214. 
</P>
<P>
This brief dominance pales compared to the consistency of two teams of the 
'70s. The Cincinnati Reds won six division titles, four National League 
pennants and two World Series between 1970 and '79. The Oakland A's won five 
straight division titles starting in 1970 and three straight American League 
pennants and World Series starting in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
What has happened since? 
</P>
<P>
Why has the dynasty gone the way of the mood ring? 
</P>
<P>
Alderson cited two factors. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The amateur draft, he said, has had a leveling effect. A club gets only one 
out of every 26 players selected. Thus, the talent is more evenly divided. And 
a club that consistently finishes near the top, consistently drafts near the 
bottom, making it difficult to sustain an input of quality talent. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With today's economics, he said, the top teams can only keep their 
personnel together by paying large salaries through arbitration and free 
agency, and all eventually reach a limit or have players depart no matter how 
much they pay. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Alderson said, the multiyear contract has affected the 
motivational level of many players. 
</P>
<P>
"That's human nature and I accept it," he said. "But the system now becomes so 
expensive that a club's success can't be maintained. There's a constant 
turnover that you didn't have 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone goes through the same cycle. You start over in the farm system and 
piece it back together." 
</P>
<P>
Can it be avoided? Can the A's avoid it? 
</P>
<P>
Budding dynasties have stood pat and died. A commitment to build -- and spend 
-- seems essential. Progressive management is pivotal, and that the A's have. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of their 81-81 record in 1987, having finished four games behind 
the Minnesota Twins in the AL West, the A's added eight players through trade 
or free agency: Storm Davis, in August of '87; Bob Welch, Don Baylor, Parker, 
Ron Hassey, Dave Henderson, Rick Honeycutt and Glenn Hubbard. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of their 104 victories last year, the A's signed free agent pitcher 
Mike Moore for three years at $3.95 million and traded in midseason for Rickey 
Henderson, knowing he will be eligible for free agency when this season ends 
and that it might take $3 million a year to retain him. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, the A's have been lucky with a number of reclamation projects. 
There was no predicting that Dave Stewart or Dennis Eckersley or Dave Henderson 
or Davis or Honeycutt or Gene Nelson would have responded as they have. 
</P>
<P>
But, Alderson said, they were potential pieces in the puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
"We were confident we had the type manager and coaches who could help them," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with Moore and Rickey Henderson representing missing links, the A's have a 
club of solidly consistent pitching, defense and hitting -- deep in 
versatility, reliable in execution and comparatively young overall. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart and Welch, each 32, are the oldest members of the rotation. Relief ace 
Eckersley is 35 and appreciative of the care LaRussa has given his use. 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Carney Lansford is the oldest position player at 32. Designated 
hitter Parker is 38. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to look ahead, Alderson said the A's won't have openings next spring for 
more than one or two pitchers -- farm product Jim Corsi is a good bet -- and a 
No. 2 catcher. 
</P>
<P>
The puzzle doesn't need as many pieces now. The A's are almost certain to 
re-sign Rickey Henderson, who will move to the top of their salary ladder. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, also eligible for free agency, led the A's in runs batted in, has 
enjoyed productive postseason play, represents the team's only left-handed 
power threat and is also likely to be re-signed. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Langston? The free agent pitcher who would seem to represent the insurance 
policy on a dynasty? 
</P>
<P>
The A's have been giving mixed signals, publicly indicating they do not have 
the resources to sign both Henderson and Langston -- and forcing, in turn, a 
deserved renegotiation of Stewart's contract -- while privately leaving the 
door ajar. 
</P>
<P>
"I like our foundation, but that doesn't mean we won't keep trying new things, 
changing the parts," Alderson said, refusing to discuss Langston in specifics. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a good situation here. The club and environment have become 
reasonably attractive, but that doesn't mean we can sign every player who wants 
to play for us. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the revenue that teams in the big markets do, our resources 
aren't limitless. The need for change and improvement doesn't just mean 
supplementing what you have. Sometimes it's a choice between what you have and 
what you would like to have." 
</P>
<P>
As Alderson noted, what the A's have is a respected manager who can be counted 
on to keep his players hungry as he did this year and a team that should remain 
competitive in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's all that can be expected of any team now. Maybe that's the new 
definition of dynasty given the sport's current format.

NEWSWIRE: SOVIET GYMNASTS TAKE SIZABLE LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Romania's Daniela Silivas had the first perfect score of the World Gymnastics 
Championships in Stuttgart, West Germany, but Svetlana Boginskaya was the best 
overall as the Soviet Union opened a sizable lead Monday, halfway through the 
women's team competition. 
</P>
<P>
Boginskaya, the reigning European champion and Olympic all-around bronze 
medalist, excelled on all four apparatus exercises and scored 39.837 out of 40 
points. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of compulsory exercises, the Soviet Union has 198.058 out of 200 
points, ahead of Romania with 196.447 and China with 195.896. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, led by Brandy Johnson, was in fourth place with 193.895. 
Johnson was eighth individually after the compulsories. 
</P>
<P>
Silivas, 19, had a perfect 10 on the vault and continued to perform strongly on 
the other three compulsory events to finish with 39.699, edging China's Yang 
Bo, who scored 39.649, for second place.

Todd Hickman, a former Olympic boxing hopeful who won 221 amateur fights, has 
died of a gunshot wound to the head suffered last week, the Summit County 
coroner's office reported. Hickman, 23, had been in intensive care at Akron 
General Medical Center after he was wounded last Wednesday in what police said 
was a drug-related shooting. A 119-pounder, he lost out in the 1984 Olympic 
trials.

Clarence J. (Jake) Kline, whose teams earned 542 victories in his 42 seasons as 
Notre Dame's baseball coach, died at the age of 94 Sunday at St. Joseph's 
Medical Center. He had suffered a stroke on Oct. 5. In 1976, Notre Dame's 
baseball field was named in his honor. A member of both the College Baseball 
Hall of Fame and the Indiana Baseball Hall of Fame, Kline was named Notre 
Dame's head coach in 1934 and coached until the end of the 1975 season when he 
was 80.

The NCAA began three days of closed-door meetings, setting an agenda of 
proposals it will sponsor at the NCAA convention, which begins Jan. 7 in 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Among items expected to be discussed were proposals for expansion of drug tests 
and reduction of basketball schedules. The NCAA Presidents Commission already 
has urged a cut in the basketball season by almost one month and removing three 
games from the Division I men's and women's schedules. 
</P>
<P>
The council also may consider changes to Proposition 42, approved at the last 
NCAA convention, which would eliminate scholarship aid to freshmen who fail to 
meet all academic requirements.

THE PREPS: GOOD THINGS DO COME IN SMALL PACKAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Rudy Ramirez Jr. maintains that he is 5-feet-7 and weighs 145 pounds, but the 
standout senior running back for Bell Gardens High School has a difficult time 
convincing others that he is that big. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Ramirez was listed at 5-6 and 140 when he was named to the 
Southern Section's Division IV team after gaining 1,049 yards and scoring 23 
touchdowns for the Whitmont League champion Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
In this year's Southern Section preview guide, which normally adds height and 
weight to returning players, Ramirez was pumped up to only 5-8 and 150. 
</P>
<P>
Even Bell Gardens Coach Dave Newell tends to play down Ramirez's size. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that Rudy is 5-6 and about 139 pounds," Newell said. "And, he may 
be closer to 5-5." 
</P>
<P>
Even at home, Ramirez, who claims to be the second-tallest in his family, has 
to deal with questions regarding his size. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a sister who is two inches taller than me and sometimes I wish that I 
had her height," he said. "But, I am taller than my dad, even though he doesn't 
like to admit it." 
</P>
<P>
Debates regarding Ramirez's physical stature may go one forever, but there are 
not many questions about his talents on the football field. 
</P>
<P>
After six games this season, Ramirez is among the Southern Section leaders in 
scoring with 16 touchdowns, and in rushing with 615 yards. In Bell Gardens' 
47-14 win over California High of Whittier last Friday night, he rushed for 147 
yards and scored three touchdowns. "Ramirez has really carried the load for us 
this season," Newell said. "We have had to give him the ball more because we 
have had so many big games early. Despite his size, he is very durable. After 
every game he can barely walk, but he has not missed a practice in two years." 
</P>
<P>
Getting attention because of his football playing skills is nothing new to 
Ramirez, who began playing touch football in the street in front of his house 
when he was 6. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I was small, I have always been pretty good and people looked up to me 
for that," Ramirez said. "I never doubted myself despite having people always 
tell me that I was too small." 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez became known to Newell and his staff at Bell Gardens as a 5-4, 
110-pound freshman. In his first full season of contact football, Ramirez 
proved to be as elusive in pads as he was when he played touch football at Bell 
Gardens City Park in junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
"It has always been pretty easy for me because I am quick and I know where I am 
going all of the time, while the defense doesn't," Ramirez said. "I am not all 
of that fast, but when I'm making a move, I just seem to make the right 
decision against the defense." 
</P>
<P>
One of Ramirez's biggest fans is Newell, who has coached Bell Gardens to 11 
consecutive playoff appearances. Newell says that sometimes he cannot believe 
Ramirez's toughness. 
</P>
<P>
"He is like Silly Putty," Newell said. "No one ever gets a full hit on him. He 
just flows like music. . . . He is constant motion on the field where sometimes 
a defender will get three chances to tackle him on the same play." 
</P>
<P>
Newell points to a game earlier this season against Montebello, which Bell 
Gardens won, 28-20, as an indication of Ramirez's dedication. 
</P>
<P>
"In that game, he was almost knocked unconscious in the first quarter and 
missed a play and then in the fourth quarter he missed another after throwing 
up all over himself," Newell said. "All he did was account for over 360 yards 
in total offense while scoring four touchdowns. It was just a tremendous human 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
A Golden League football game between Palmdale and Saugus last Friday night at 
College of the Canyons was suspended in the fourth quarter after a Palmdale 
player allegedly attacked an official. 
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, Palmdale's Darius Wilson, 18, grabbed back judge 
Bradley Woolley and threw him to the ground after three consecutive personal 
foul penalties were called against Palmdale. The game was suspended with the 
score tied, 0-0, and 7:40 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-2, 175-pound Wilson was arrested after the game on suspicion of 
misdemeanor battery charges and may face criminal charges, according to Elliott 
Fisher of the Newhall district attorney's office. Wilson was released Friday 
night on his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, a wide receiver-defensive back, also faces disciplinary action from 
school administrators, according to Principal Linda Janzen. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale and Saugus school administrators met with Southern Section officials 
Monday to review videotape of the incident. The Southern Section office will 
rely on Golden League officials to determine the outcome of the game. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Southern Section officials are expected to make 
recommendations within the next two days regarding disciplinary action against 
either school, according to Saugus Athletic Director Randy Parker. 
</P>
<P>
With Beverly Hills teachers on strike, Beverly Hills High's fall athletic 
programs will suffer. Coaches of four of the school's five fall sports honored 
the picket line. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Jack Dyck said that the football, tennis, cross-country and 
volleyball coaches were out but that the water polo team will continue play 
under its walk-on coach. 
</P>
<P>
"The coaches are very upset and frustrated regarding the strike but they will 
remain united," Dyck said. "Every fall team is in playoff contention and their 
chances of making the playoffs will be hurt with the strike." 
</P>
<P>
A girls' tennis match has been canceled and Principal Ben Bushman said that 
Friday night's football game at Santa Monica will be forfeited. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping that the strike ends soon, but it doesn't look good," Dyck said. 
"As of now, everything in our athletic department is shut down and the 
possibilities of replacing the coaches with walk-on volunteers is not our first 
choice because we are concerned about the kids getting quality coaching without 
any compromises." 
</P>

Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
The biggest high school cross-country meet in the western United States will be 
held this weekend at Mt. San Antonio College, featuring more than 300 schools 
and 7,000 participants. Headlining the boys' action will be an expected 
showdown between Bryan Dameworth of Agoura, generally considered the top high 
school distance runner in the nation, and Louis Quintana of Arroyo Grande, who 
was the fastest sophomore miler in the nation last spring. They will meet in 
the large-school boys' sweepstakes race Saturday, which features the top six 
teams in the state -- Camarillo, De La Salle of Concord, Canyon Country Canyon, 
Arroyo Grande, Agoura and Saddleback of Santa Ana, along with Ashland (Ore.). 
</P>
<P>
In girls' action Saturday, unbeaten Shelley Taylor of Huntington Beach Edison 
will race freshman Miesha Marzell of Reed High School in Sparks, Nev., who 
defeated the top runners in Northern California two weeks ago at the Stanford 
Invitational. The meet opens Friday, with small-school races from 2:30-5:30 
p.m. featuring the state's top boys' teams, McFarland and Laguna Beach, and 
girls' teams, Bret Harte of Altaville and Los Angeles Baptist of Sepulveda. On 
Saturday, the large schools' meet begins at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>

MORNING BECOMES DYSPEPTIC; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT CONFLICT AND SUDDEN CHANGE ARE NOT WHAT 
BLEARY-EYED VIEWERS WANT IN MORNING NEWS SHOWS, BUT CHANGE IS IN THE AIR.

It used to be that morning television was as comforting a way to start the day 
as a fresh cup of coffee and a hot, buttered roll. If late-night TV is what you 
watch between your toes, the network morning shows are like radio with rabbit 
ears: programs you listen to and watch between the shower and the car door -- 
for friendly banter, useful features and the reassurance that the world has 
made it through another night. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the first news of the day for many people," notes Charles Gibson, "Good 
Morning America" co-anchor, "and they want to know that Cleveland is still 
there." 
</P>
<P>
They also want to know that Charles Gibson is still there, along with Joan 
Lunden -- or, if they're "Today" show fans, Jane Pauley and Bryant Gumbel. 
</P>
<P>
Since morning TV began nearly 40 years ago with NBC's "Today" and host Dave 
Garroway, the collegiality of the on-air "family" has been considered a 
significant factor in a show's success. The traditional on-air marriage of 
David Hartman and Joan Lunden on "Good Morning America" might give way to the 
"Moonlighting"-style relationship of Gumbel and Pauley as the preferred format, 
but network research has found that conflict and sudden change are not what 
bleary-eyed viewers want. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm going to argue with my wife, I'll save it until nighttime," says Jack 
Reilly, executive producer of "Good Morning America." "That translates to 
television -- viewers don't want aggravation when they have their whole day 
ahead of them." 
</P>
<P>
Well, fasten your Mr. Coffee machines -- it's going to be a bumpy morning. 
America's TV wakeup call -- already jangling with the planned departure of Jane 
Pauley from "Today" -- is likely to be in for some changes. 
</P>
<P>
NBC is expected to announce this week that Pauley will leave "Today" after 13 
years to work on a prime-time news series. She has been concerned about the 
possible direction of "Today" and the handling of the promotion of Deborah 
Norville as news anchor. Weatherman Willard Scott, meanwhile -- who was 
criticized for his cornpone ways by anchor Bryant Gumbel in a now-infamous memo 
to the executive producer -- has made no secret of his desire to leave the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
And "Today" -- which remains No. 1 in the ratings but has been losing ground to 
ABC's "Good Morning America" -- will be getting a new senior executive producer 
in January: David Nuell, the executive producer of "Entertainment Tonight." 
Nuell has helped to improve the ratings of "ET" with more tabloid-style 
features. While there is no indication that Nuell would bring "ET" to "Today," 
some network observers project that a revamp of "Today" could be in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
Behind all the publicity about the "Today" show, the bottom-line story of 
morning news is that ABC's "Good Morning America" has been beating "Today" with 
a key demographic group for advertisers -- women aged 18 to 49. 
</P>
<P>
A successful network show can be a cash-cow for a network and its stations; 
"Today" brings in more than $65 million a year in revenue. Being outperformed 
by ABC with a key demographic group, therefore, hurts where it counts. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the overall ratings, "GMA" has been gaining. Although "Today" remains 
No. 1, in the last year it has declined 7% in its share of the total audience, 
while "GMA" has gained 3%. The race is now so close that only two-tenths of a 
ratings point separates "GMA" from "Today," according to Nielsen ratings for 
the third quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
While they're not gloating about the negative publicity at "Today," the 
producers of "GMA" are glad they don't have that problem to worry about at the 
moment. The last time there was early-morning dissent, it was over Joan 
Lunden's dissatisfaction with years of playing second-fiddle to David Hartman. 
Hartman has now left the show, replaced by ABC newsman Charles Gibson, with 
whom Lunden shares co-anchor duties. 
</P>
<P>
"GMA" has been changing some of its features to accommodate the changing 
interests of the audience, cutting back on celebrity interviews now seen on 
many other shows and adding contributors such as Terry Rohe, a 72-year-old 
reporter who talks to both parents and their grown children about issues 
concerning older people. 
</P>
<P>
According to NBC executives, NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol was given the 
additional responsibility of overseeing "Today" for the news division earlier 
this year because "Today" seemed to be lacking in fresh ideas. Noting that 
"Today" had overtaken the then-top-rated "GMA" in the mid-1980s with the 
pairing of Gumbel and Pauley, news-making trips abroad and other fresh 
approaches, NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff said in an interview, 
"The show needed innovation and new leadership. It seemed to be running on 
previous momentum." 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the situation said that the appointment of Deborah 
Norville last August to replace John Palmer as news anchor on "Today" was 
intended as a bid for younger viewers. The theory was that Norville, a touted 
new NBC star, would be more attractive to them than the veteran Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
Ebersol is said to have explained the change to Pauley, but there seems to have 
been some misunderstanding on the full extent of Norville's role, which has 
proved to be more of a full partner with Gumbel and Pauley than simply a 
news-reader, as Palmer had been. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, the arrangements, which one source describes as "more of a 
screw-up than a conscious plot," appear to have backfired on NBC. Pauley, who 
is very popular with the early-morning audience, according to NBC's own 
research, is leaving the show, probably at the end of the year. And Norville, 
who was recently signed to a $1-million contract by NBC, may bear the burden of 
being portrayed as "the other woman" in the "Today" domestic drama if, as 
expected, she is named to succeed Pauley as co-anchor. 
</P>
<P>
Third-ranked CBS, meanwhile, on Monday got a new executive producer for "CBS 
This Morning" with Kathleen Sullivan and Harry Smith: Erik Sorenson, formerly 
vice president and station manager at KCBS-TV Channel 2 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
CBS, a perennial third in the morning-news race, has been lagging far behind 
"GMA and "Today" with "CBS This Morning." Sullivan, a former news anchor at 
ABC, was brought to CBS with great fanfare, but "CBS This Morning" has not 
ignited the ratings since its premiere two years ago. Sorenson has not said 
what his plans for the show are. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent remark that was overhead on an open mike, Sullivan called CBS the 
"Cheap Broadcasting System." Her lawyer, Ronald Konecky, says that the remark 
was in jest and the incident was overblown. But sources at CBS say the comment 
was not a big hit with management. Sullivan has more than a year to go on her 
contract, which is estimated at $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the network morning shows remain dominant in the 7-9 a.m. period, 
they've seen some erosion of their audience to the many new other choices 
available. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not just competing with each other now," notes "GMA"s Reilly. "There's 
cable, local morning shows and even a lot of kids' cartoons that people are 
watching at those hours. If there isn't enough audience for one of the three 
network morning shows, maybe somebody will decide to run a half-hour soap -- or 
a rock concert at 7:30 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their differences, all three networks are doing essentially the same 
kind of show that "Today" began 40 years ago, although their serious news 
content has grown. That's probably because the format works well, and sudden 
change can be disastrous. But if somebody comes up with a new wakeup call that 
works for today's audience, whether it's news, entertainment or some new 
combination, the rewards could be very big indeed.

CRITIC AT LARGE: WOODY WOOING A NEW MUSE WITH 'CRIMES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tombstone-style ad Woody Allen has decreed for his new film "Crimes and 
Misdemeanors" is startling in its lack of startle. No pulsating quotes, no 
searing ad line, no pretty faces, no drawn gun, no bared bosom; just the title 
in large letters adrift in a sea of white space, with the cast and crew in much 
smaller type and Allen's name nestled inconspicuously among the other players. 
</P>
<P>
A drawn gun and several bared bosoms are implicit although not revealed in the 
film's contents, and ad lines of incendiary power would be possible ("When Love 
Dies . . . The Hard Way," and so on). 
</P>
<P>
The ad may (or may not) be a distributor's nightmare. Despite his critical 
reputation, Allen has never been a consistently big box-office attraction. The 
ad can also be variously interpreted as one man's modesty and his earnest 
rebellion against customary hype, or it can be viewed as a kind of inverted 
arrogance that says Allen's work does not require the hard sell. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that the ad will probably work as well as and conceivably better 
than another kind of ad would have. Word of mouth sells or kills most films, 
and Allen has a hard-core following which amplifies word of mouth when Allen is 
on form. 
</P>
<P>
And the fact is that "Crimes and Misdemeanors" reaffirms Allen's status as the 
most persistently personal, original and provocative of all U.S. film makers. 
It is one of his best films. 
</P>
<P>
As has been said about Ken Russell and a few other obstreperously 
individualistic creators, Allen's less successful films are more interesting 
than most directors' smooth triumphs. "Interiors," "September" and "Another 
Woman" may have fizzled at the box office, but in their examination of 
characters and relationships and in their capturing of moods and environments 
they can't accurately be called failures. 
</P>
<P>
In "Crimes and Misdemeanors," as Michael Wilmington pointed out in an eloquent 
review last week, Allen has done what many of his fainter-hearted admirers have 
beseeched him to do, which is leaven the serious stuff with a few good jokes. 
</P>
<P>
There is a sizable cargo of laughs in "Crimes and Misdemeanors," some of them 
Allen's sardonic one-liners as a failed documentary-maker, scorned husband and 
rejected lover. More of them derive from the character Allen created for Alan 
Alda to play (dazzlingly well) as a lecherous, overbearing, egocentric producer 
of television comedy. Alda will call to mind, at least in the industry, all or 
part of several real life models. 
</P>
<P>
What is noteworthy about the humor, which leavens the whole piece, is that it 
exists within Allen's darkest film yet. 
</P>
<P>
His pessimism has seemed real enough in several of the films. The characters he 
has played have often as not lost the girl. Like Chaplin's Tramp, the 
collective Woody has gone on alone, with a wry joke instead of a strut. 
</P>
<P>
The disappointments Allen rendered on Mia Farrow in "Purple Rose of Cairo," 
masked only slightly by his technically ingenious homage to the movies as our 
principal source of solace, were bitterly cruel. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's pessimism lifted measurably in "Hannah and Her Sisters," which glowed 
with an uncommon family warmth. Yet much of the warmth began, or flowed from, 
an acceptance of the world as it is and a setting-aside of the infidelities, 
the estrangements, the disappointments and betrayals of the past. Ripeness, and 
forgiveness, were all. 
</P>
<P>
In "Crimes and Misdemeanors" -- the echoing parallel to the Ingmar Bergman 
title "Cries and Whispers" is intriguingly close -- Allen seems to take the 
idea of ripeness, of a philosophical acceptance of reality, even further than 
before. 
</P>
<P>
The film maker Allen plays is making a documentary on a German-Jewish 
philosopher. With his thick accent, the philosopher can be taken as a parody of 
an academic type. He is also a comment on the film maker's unworldliness. On 
the evidence, PBS would be hesitant to show the documentary at midnight, even 
if they could get it for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
But the philosopher is saying desperately coherent things, depicting the 
universe as cold, indifferent and mechanistic, warmed only by such efforts as 
human beings make to create warmth within it. 
</P>
<P>
The documentary is left unfinished because the philosopher has evidently found 
the efforts to warm the universe unavailing. The documentary sequence is played 
off against Allen's growing infatuation with the production assistant played by 
Mia Farrow. It is not unlike a magician's use of indirection, making you 
realize only later what was really going on. 
</P>
<P>
As reviews have noted, "Crimes and Misdemeanors" is the most melodramatic of 
Allen's films: Martin Landau, in another superb performance, conspiring with 
his brother Jerry Ohrbach in the murder of a discarded mistress who is making 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
In this movie Allen is wrestling with a lot of major stuff, love and the death 
of love, guilt and punishment (if any), and, embracing all else, the question 
of the existence and nature of God. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to think of another film maker who could give us a Seder table 
argument about an all-seeing God (insisted upon by Allen's devout father) 
against a cynical worldly pragmatism voiced by an atheistic aunt. 
</P>
<P>
Ingmar Bergman has often dealt with faith and the death of faith, the pains of 
spiritual aridity, but never a laugh in a carload, though affecting in other 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's film is first and last an entertainment with all the appurtenances 
thereof -- humor, suspense, drama, conflict. It also offers reverberations that 
won't die down, and speculations about living in a world with and without the 
consoling, chiding idea of God. 
</P>
<P>
Allen has come a long way from humor for its own sake to humor as the carrier 
of some very somber thoughts.

IS MELISSA ETHERIDGE THE DOOM-AND-GLOOM STAR OF ROCK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How does Melissa Etheridge feel about being the doom-and-gloom queen of 
pop-rock? Words couldn't quite express her feelings. During afternoon tea in 
West Hollywood recently, the singer-songwriter let her nose do the talking -- 
wrinkling it as if she'd just gotten a whiff of a foul odor. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the fact that people think I'm this depressed, miserable person," 
lamented Etheridge, who opens a five-day engagement tonight at the Roxy. "Some 
people come to see me wallow in misery. Men write me letters telling me how 
they want to help me become a happy person." 
</P>
<P>
Blame her image on her debut album, "Melissa Etheridge," which has sold nearly 
1 million copies. The songs are intense melodramas focusing on rocky 
relationships, on people in emotional turmoil. She sings with great conviction, 
her slightly croaky voice sounding angry and emotionally wounded. These songs, 
fans assume, have to be autobiographical. 
</P>
<P>
"I do songs about how people relate to each other, about what happens in these 
relationships," she explained. "I'm sensitive to pain -- to other people's 
pain. That doesn't mean I've experienced all the pain I write about. Let's say 
I have a good imagination." 
</P>
<P>
Chuckling, she quipped, "If I was like the characters in some of my songs, I 
probably would have committed suicide years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Etheridge comes across as overwhelmingly sincere. Often underscoring her words 
with forceful gestures, she looks you intently in the eye, giving the 
impression she's hanging on your every word. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a good listener," she said. "I absorb a lot about people's thoughts and 
feelings. If you don't have a good feeling for what makes people tick you can't 
be a good songwriter." 
</P>
<P>
A cheery follow-up album would have shattered her gloom-and-doom image. But her 
recently-released second album, "Brave and Crazy," is essentially more of the 
same. Her fans are apparently pleased with it. After a few weeks out, it's 
already in the Top 30 on the Billboard pop chart. 
</P>
<P>
Etheridge, though, doesn't agree that the two albums are that similar. "I did 
these songs differently," she explained. "My approach to the themes is more 
mature this time. The challenge was how to talk about some of life's basic 
complications and problems in new and interesting ways. I think I accomplished 
what I set out to do." 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, the albums are different. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, her phrasing is more offbeat, a little more dramatic. The songs 
on the new album are more pensive too. There's less unbridled anger, more humor 
and more soul-searching. Her imagery is sharper this time and her lyrics have 
more dimension. 
</P>
<P>
Musically, the new album has more of a live feel -- thanks to improved 
production. "That live feel was missing on the first album," she explained. "I 
wanted to make this album sound more like I do in person. When I went on tour 
with the first album, people saw I was more of a rock 'n' roller. That tour, 
showing a different side of me, really helped sell the album." 
</P>
<P>
On her albums, she's more like a traditional folk singer, accompanied by 
minimalist, guitar-dominated musical tracks, her dramatic vocals mostly 
carrying the songs. In person, though, backed by a band, she sounds more like a 
rocker -- the musicians fleshing out that spare instrumental accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
Etheridge, who's from Leavenworth, Kan., figured out in high school that she 
wanted to be a singer, and worked for years with a country band before 
switching to pop. After a short, uneventful detour into scholarly training -- 
at the Berklee School of Music -- she decided her best bet was on-the-job 
training. 
</P>
<P>
"I started playing bars, clubs, street corners -- wherever people would listen 
and I could make some money," she said. "I worked on my writing. After a while 
I thought I was good enough to get a record deal." 
</P>
<P>
Record companies, though, had other ideas. They didn't think her music was very 
commercial. "I was pretty discouraged," said Etheridge, who moved to Los 
Angeles five years ago. "I thought no record company would ever take a chance 
on me." 
</P>
<P>
But Island Records' head man Chris Blackwell, impressed by her performance in a 
Long Beach club, signed her about 2 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Now she's a budding star with two hit albums. She acknowledged, though, that 
something is missing -- something she'll gladly do without. 
</P>
<P>
"It's that aching about the future that was gnawing at me all the time," she 
said. "I was wondering if I would ever make it or if I would be one of those 
people with big dreams who failed miserably. I'm still concerned about the 
future -- this isn't what you'd call a secure business. But at least that 
horrible ache is gone."

GRAMM-RUDMAN IS THE KEY TO REDUCING DEFICIT, CONGRESSMAN TELLS IRVINE GROUP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Blaming a "politically paralyzed" Congress, House Ways and Means Committee 
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski on Monday told Orange County accountants and tax 
lawyers Monday night that Gramm-Rudman budget cuts are the only way to 
significantly reduce the federal deficit this year. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a combined dinner meeting of several local professional 
organizations at the Airporter Inn in Irvine, Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) also 
refused to predict whether a House-Senate budget conference committee will 
retain a House-sponsored capital gains tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush signed an order Monday night cutting federal programs by $16.1 
billion after 11th-hour negotiations over the budget ended in failure. 
</P>
<P>
The action may be symbolic, however, since congressional leaders have said they 
plan to restore funding for government programs and agencies as soon as a 
compromise on deficit-reduction efforts is reached in the next few weeks or 
months. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate budget bill has no capital gains tax cut or other so-called special 
interest items in it, but the House version does. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to about 500 people Monday night, Rostenkowski said, "We ought to let 
those (Gramm-Rudman) cuts go into effect . . . because they can result in more 
real deficit reduction than we will ever achieve under the 
budget-reconciliation bill that we will produce this year." 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski criticized Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) without 
mentioning him by name, saying, "It was your congressman" who voted with a 
House majority for the plan to restore funds cut by Gramm-Rudman pending 
further deficit-reduction efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Chiding President Bush and Democrats as well as Republicans, Rostenkowski said 
Congress is "politically paralyzed" by fears of losing elections and by 
political "gamesmanship" played by both parties. 
</P>
<P>
"The gap between the rich and the poor is increasing . . . but we simply refuse 
to pay for the government services we demand. The national debt is increasing 
by $50 million each and every day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Democrats want Bush to fail. . . . The Republicans want the House to fail. 
Both strategies are totally bankrupt." 
</P>
<P>
Several people in the audience suggested that capital gains taxes should be 
indexed to account for inflation, but Rostenkowski said he could not persuade 
federal budget director Richard Darman or House Speaker Thomas S. Foley 
(D-Washington) to agree to that. 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski spoke to a combined dinner meeting of the Newport Beach-Irvine and 
Orange County estate planning councils, the estate planning, probate, trust law 
and taxation sections of the Orange County Bar Assn., and the Orange 
County-Long Beach chapter of the California Society of CPAs.

ILL WOMAN STRUGGLES FOR HER FOOD, PRIDE

In some ways, Fran Michalski is luckier than most. At least she was injured on 
the job, so she is eligible for workers' compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Michalski's back injury three years ago, as well as ongoing battles with 
diabetes and psoriasis and a history of breast cancer, forced her to leave her 
job as a registered nurse to pursue a seemingly endless round of medical 
appointments. 
</P>
<P>
Michalski is 57, lives in Santa Ana, and has no health insurance. As such, she 
is one of thousands of Orange County residents with no financial net to fall 
back on when times get tough. 
</P>
<P>
Her travails have brought her to the economic edge where one more misfortune 
could mean the loss of her car or the apartment she has lived in for nine 
years. And it has forced her to search out additional help from Orange County's 
medical clinics and other programs for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean I just . . . ," Michalski says, then begins crying. "I've always been 
one of these who hates to ask. I've always given or done (for others). It 
really hurts when you have to go and beg." 
</P>
<P>
Once, she said, she went for food stamps when she had only 50 cents in her 
pocket, "not enough for a quart of milk." After waiting, and waiting, she was 
"refused point blank." 
</P>
<P>
Michalski has been unable to get medical insurance of any substance since she 
had a double mastectomy 12 years ago because of breast cancer. In this she has 
a lot of company. According to a study conducted at UCLA's School of Public 
Health, more than one-fifth of the adult, non-elderly population in the 
Anaheim-Santa Ana metropolitan area does not have health insurance, slightly 
higher than the state average. 
</P>
<P>
In Michalski's case, workers' compensation pays her $812 a month, and she 
receives another $293 in Supplemental Security Income. All told, it is more 
than many others in similar circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time she pays $655 a month for rent and nearly $300 for car payments 
and car insurance, there is little left for anything else, including food. To 
supplement her income, Michalski collects newspapers and cans to sell at a 
recycling center. 
</P>
<P>
"The most I ever came back with was $12. I was on cloud nine," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Michalski has turned to the Share Our Selves (SOS) clinic for help, where she 
can at least get some of the expensive medications she needs. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been wonderful," Michalski said. 
</P>
<P>
Michalski hurt her back when a male patient at an Orange County free medical 
clinic where she worked fainted and fell on top of her. After numerous 
surgeries, and in the face of continuing pain and other back and nerve 
problems, her doctors say she may never return to work. "I planned on working 
another 10 or 12 years, if this hadn't happened," Michalski said. "But as it is 
now I can't stand for very long. I have to lean on my elbows to do the dishes. 
. . . Just to do ironing last night, if you could see the contortions I go 
through. It takes me twice as long to do a blouse or a pair of pants than it 
does anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Michalski said that she was "always a hard worker" and that she is shamed by 
having to ask for help now. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling her humiliation over the food stamp incident she said, "I was 
serious. I wouldn't have gone there if I really didn't need it."

MUSTANG CLUB BACKER TELLS JURY OF SHOOTING THAT BLINDED HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mustang Club investor C. William Carroll, blinded in a shooting two years ago, 
used hand motions Monday to describe to jurors in a rare Orange County 
racketeering trial how both his assailants held him down before firing three 
bullets into his head. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, Superior Court Judge John L. Flynn Jr. is expected to take jurors 
to the loading dock of the courthouse in Santa Ana so that Carroll can 
demonstrate what happened in the same rented Honda in which the shooting 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, 57, dabbing his watering eyes with a handkerchief, identified Joseph 
Angelo Grosso, now on trial, as the man who drove him and Los Angeles racketeer 
Michael Anthony Rizzitello into an empty Costa Mesa parking garage on May 1, 
1987. Carroll claims that Grosso then held down his leg while Rizzitello, 
seated directly behind him in the back seat, grabbed him around the neck and 
shot him. Rizzitello's trial is scheduled to follow Grosso's. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors claim that Rizzitello, 62, wanted to take control of the Mustang, a 
topless bar on Harbor Boulevard in Santa Ana, which has since closed. But 
Carroll, prosecutors contend, was viewed as uncooperative and had to be 
eliminated. Grosso, 46, prosecutors say, used his connections to Carroll to 
help set up the assault. 
</P>
<P>
The Grosso/Rizzitello trials have drawn much interest from law enforcement 
officials in the region because of Rizzitello's longtime connections to the 
leading organized crime family in Los Angeles. Rizzitello has a long history of 
racketeering and fraud convictions, but he has long been under investigation as 
a possible top enforcer for the mob family. 
</P>
<P>
Although Monday was the first day of testimony in the prosecution's case 
against Grosso, it was Grosso's attorney, William Yacobozzi Jr., who in opening 
statements dominated most of the day with bold accusations that at the time of 
the shooting, Carroll, himself, was involved in everything from drugs to loan 
sharking to murder. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll is attempting to get back at Grosso, the lawyer contends, because 
Grosso was an FBI informant and was feeding some of Carroll's crime admissions 
to investigators. Part of Yacobozzi's attack strategy is to convince jurors 
that Carroll is a suspect in "two to five murders," including the New Year's 
Day, 1987, shooting death of Jimmy Casino, manager of the Mustang bar. Casino, 
prosecutors claim, had borrowed more than $300,000 from Carroll to open the 
Mustang in the early 1980s, and the Mustang corporation still owed Carroll 
$140,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you have anything to do with the murder of Jimmy Casino," Yacobozzi asked 
Carroll during cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors turned their eyes to Carroll for his reaction. Carroll, clutching at his 
handkerchief, appeared unruffled by the question, and answered slowly: 
"Absolutely, unequivocally, no." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll waited 1 1/2 years after the shooting before telling authorities who 
had wounded him. But Carroll explained Monday that he wanted to wait until 
after resolution of a fraud case pending against him. He ended up pleading no 
contest to a misdemeanor in that case and received no time in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that if I spent even one day in the County Jail, I probably would 
not come out alive," he said, explaining that he feared Rizzitello would have 
him killed in the jail.

SHOTGUN HAD JUST BEEN PURCHASED IN MURDER-SUICIDE

Thomas White bought a 12-gauge shotgun from one of the city's largest gun 
stores just hours before he used it to kill himself and his girlfriend, former 
Edison High School girls' basketball star Krisden Yoshiko Tanabe, police said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
While sale of a handgun requires a 15-day waiting period under state law, White 
could buy and immediately take home the shotgun he used for Thursday's 
murder-suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster police said White bought the weapon Thursday afternoon at B&amp;B 
Sales, on Golden West Street. 
</P>
<P>
At B&amp;B Sales, a store manager declined to comment Monday, beyond saying 
that he doubts that White had bought the weapon there. 
</P>
<P>
But police say White, a troubled 21-year-old loner, drove to Tanabe's home on 
Tree Bark Circle after making the purchase and shot her in front of a friend's 
home as she tried to flee. He then used the shotgun to commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting came two days after White checked out after nearly a monthlong 
stay at Los Altos Hospital and Mental Health Center in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster Mayor Charles V. Smith said the case points up the need for a law 
to require a waiting period for the sales of rifles and shotguns, similar to 
the system for handgun purchases. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, this thing would not have happened if we had a law 
requiring a cooling-off period for a few days," Smith said. A bill that would 
have extended the 15-day waiting period to rifles and shotguns was defeated by 
the state Senate last month. The measure's author blamed intense lobbying by 
the National Rifle Assn. for preventing its passage. 
</P>
<P>
The handgun waiting period is intended to give state officials time to 
determine whether the prospective buyer has a felony conviction or has been 
found to be mentally ill by a court. 
</P>
<P>
At present, rifle or shotgun buyers can take same-day delivery after they fill 
out a "firearms transaction record" issued by the U.S. Treasury Department's 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The form poses questions to the buyer 
about immigration status, criminal record, mental history and drug use. A yes 
answer to any would be enough to stop a sale immediately, one longtime gun 
dealer said.

CHILDREN TO LEARN ABOUT INDIAN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elementary school children will learn about American Indian music, housing, 
food and clothing under a new, pilot program in the Capistrano Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
In a survey of parents, district officials found that more than 1,000 children 
enrolled in Capistrano schools have American Indian ancestry. That qualified 
the district to receive a $104,000 federal grant for the program. 
</P>
<P>
The money will allow the district to train teachers and pay for new materials, 
said Bill Eller, an assistant superintendent. The program is intended to make 
students more aware of their Indian heritage and to instill pride in their 
cultural identity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The district previously had what Eller called a "road show," in which 
artifacts, pottery, examples of weaving, weapons and clothes were packed in 
boxes and moved from school to school. Classes at each school were allowed to 
view the materials for a week or two. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning this year, teachers in kindergarten through fifth grade will have 
their own materials, Eller said. G. JEANETTE AVENT

MARINA'S BIRTHDAY CELEBRATED AT HARBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dana Point Harbor Marina opened in 1971 with a most inauspicious event. It was 
18 years ago that Dana Point resident Bob Saxby, heady with the honor of being 
the first captain to officially guide his boat into the marina, forgot a basic 
equation: Vessels 22 feet tall do not fit under bridges 20 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
The collision almost snapped off Saxby's mast, effectively docking the boat for 
the rest of the weekend's celebrations. The ill-fated craft's name? The 
Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
On a gorgeous blue-sky Monday morning, the harbor's "coming of age" 
18th-birthday party ran a bit smoother. 
</P>
<P>
There were balloons, babies, a band and a handful of political dignitaries on 
hand to wish the harbor a happy birthday and pay homage to Alton E. Allen, the 
late Orange County supervisor often referred to as "the father" of the Dana 
Point yacht harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the harbor "a crown jewel in the 5th District," Thomas F. Riley, 
chairman of the Board of Supervisors, gave Allen credit for the "vision and 
leadership that gave birth to the harbor that we know now." 
</P>
<P>
Allen, he said, was a key figure in lobbying for federal financing of the 
harbor in the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Built at a cost of $27 million, the harbor "would cost over $200 million today, 
if it could be built at all," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisor helped unveil a permanent monument to Allen in a corner of the 
marina overlooking the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Assisting was the late supervisor's son, Jack Allen, who said Dana Point Harbor 
"was a special project of Dad's. I know he would have been tickled pink." 
</P>
<P>
Jody Tyson, president of the Dana Point Harbor Assn., said the celebration 
would continue throughout the week, with jugglers, mimes and musical groups 
scheduled to perform. FRANK MESSINA

DEVELOPER MAY GET BACK SOME DIG FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY PAULSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A developer who spent thousands of dollars on city-ordered archeological digs 
before putting up a new development in the historic downtown area should be 
reimbursed part of the money, a city official has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Stephen B. Julian, in a recommendation that will go before the 
City Council tonight, said that developer Paul L. Farber &amp; Associates 
should be reimbursed $277,365 because the archeological investigations were 
ordered by the city before work could begin on the controversial Franciscan 
Plaza development. 
</P>
<P>
Farber spent $379,047 to pay for the underground exploration before he was 
allowed to build the 18,000-square-foot, upscale plaza that includes 
restaurants, boutiques and a five-screen cinema. Construction was also delayed 
by nine months because of the study, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-style plaza at the corner of Verdugo Street and Camino Capistrano 
will be open by Christmas, Farber said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the proposed reimbursement deal that the City Council will consider 
tonight, Julian will also suggest that all artifacts that were uncovered at the 
Franciscan Plaza be turned over to the Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The historic finds include foundations from the former Valenzuela family adobe 
house, believed to date back to the early 1800s, and foundations from the Juan 
Avila adobe, built in the 1840s and destroyed by fire in 1879. Other artifacts 
documented by archeologists were a 1904 eagle nickel and old religious medals. 
</P>
<P>
"Legally, there are limits to what you can ask a developer to do," Julian said, 
explaining why the city is offering to reimburse Farber. "The costs associated 
with the archeology work were extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
If the reimbursement package is approved, the redevelopment agency would pay 
50% of the amount Farber spent in testing the site and 75% of what he will 
spend to preserve the finds. State law requires cities to reimburse developers 
a maximum of 50% of the costs associated with archeology. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very fair," Farber said of the arrangement for the city to own 
the resources earmarked for display in his shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
"The findings should belong to the community and not to a developer," Farber 
added. "Hopefully, someday, they can be displayed in a museum. I'm very happy 
to hand them over." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed agreement between the city and Farber would also give the city 
control of 131 parking spaces in a four-level structure adjacent to the plaza. 
The spaces would be available during the day to rail commuters using the nearby 
Capistrano Depot. WENDY PAULSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
TEAR GAS USED TO END SIEGE OF APARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After refusing to come out during a five-hour police siege early Monday, a 
41-year-old man ultimately surrendered to police following a tear-gas assault 
on the blood-spattered apartment in which he had locked himself. 
</P>
<P>
Police evacuated about 30 residents of the 198-unit Villa Yorba Apartments at 
Villa Yorba and San Angelo drives, after finding a blood-drenched hallway with 
messages written in blood on the wall. Police said they initially feared that a 
female resident in one apartment had been murdered and that the suspect was 
still inside. 
</P>
<P>
"Our worst-case scenario," Sgt. Lloyd Edwards said, "was that the woman was 
dead inside that apartment with her former boyfriend." 
</P>
<P>
Later police found that the man was alone. He came out after police lobbed two 
tear-gas cannisters into the third-floor apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, identified as Rudolph Sandoval of Huntington Beach, had 
deliberately cut himself with broken glass and written the bloody messages on 
the wall because he was despondent over breaking up with his girlfriend, police 
said. He was taken to a hospital for treatment of cuts on his hands, arms and 
feet and also a psychiatric examination, officers said. He may later be booked 
on suspicion of interfering with police and resisting arrest, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandoval had locked himself in his former girlfriend's apartment, Edwards said, 
after she had left during a dispute sometime Sunday night. The woman, 
identified as Sharon Christenson, 32, was not harmed. 
</P>
<P>
Police said a sister of Christenson's called them at 4:43 a.m. Monday and urged 
them to check Christenson's apartment. Edwards said the sister, who was not 
identified, feared that Christenson might be in danger. 
</P>
<P>
When officers arrived at 5 a.m. Monday to check on Christenson, they found the 
hallway to her apartment splattered with blood. 
</P>
<P>
On a wall written in blood was: "SHARON, RUDOLPH -- ONE TOGETHER -- DIE -- 
NEVER PART." 
</P>
<P>
Officers determined that a man was inside the locked apartment but did not know 
if he was armed. 
</P>
<P>
Sandoval at first talked to officers on the telephone but then hung up on 
calls, still refusing to come out, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
Christenson's fate remained in doubt until 9:30 a.m, when she walked up to the 
blockaded area around the apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
Christenson saw the police and put her hands to her mouth in alarm. "Don't 
worry, your son's OK," a neighbor yelled. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that Christenson later told them that she had had an argument with 
Sandoval on Sunday night and had left her apartment while he was still there. 
She then went to an all-night coffee shop with a friend, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police fired tear-gas into the apartment shortly after she arrived. Sandoval 
emerged a few minutes later and surrendered to police without incident. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said Sandoval had no weapon but that he had "trashed up" the apartment 
and had dripped blood from his wounds throughout the dwelling.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: OCTD WORKERS GET 12% SALARY INCREASE; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTYWIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mechanics and service workers will receive a 12% wage boost over three years 
under a new contract between the Orange County Transit District and Teamsters 
Union Local 952, OCTD officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The contract will affect 206 bus mechanics and service workers retroactively 
from Oct. 1 of this year to Sept. 30, 1992, OCTD spokeswoman Joanne Curran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Teamsters recently won an election to represent more than 700 OCTD bus 
drivers, but the United Transportation Union, which currently represents the 
drivers, has appealed the election results. Curran said the UTU's contract 
expires in April, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The new contract with the Teamsters for mechanics also provides for $100 to 
$500 pay bonuses for employees who meet attendance and productivity goals, 
Curran said. 
</P>
<P>
Salary ranges for bus mechanics and service workers were not available.

SCOUTS AID LANDLOCKED SURF TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE ESPY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Surfers in the sleepy, inland city of Placentia can almost hear the waves -- 
long before the sun comes up -- when they rise to head for the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Almost -- the nearest beach is 24 miles away. But that has not daunted a small 
group of dedicated surfers at El Dorado High School who are struggling to 
establish the Pleasantville Inland Surfers Club. 
</P>
<P>
Distance and rejection by their school have not discouraged this group of young 
men from fulfilling a dream they have had for years. 
</P>
<P>
"As seniors, this is our last year," said Mark Ritchie, student body president 
at El Dorado and an avid surfer. "I promised myself that if I got elected . . . 
I would do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
But initial attempts to start a club failed, Ritchie said, because school 
officials "said we couldn't associate the team with El Dorado in any way." 
</P>
<P>
All clubs at El Dorado must be related to the curricula, Paul Preston, 
activities director for the school, explained. He added: "Surfing is a 
high-risk activity. We can in no way sponsor such a group." 
</P>
<P>
Some inland high schools, such as Sunny Hills in Fullerton and Canyon High in 
Anaheim, have surfing teams supported by the school district. At some South 
County schools, surfing is a physical education class, Jeff Bakken, president 
of the Pleasantville Inland Surfers Club, said. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be done here," Bakken said, "but the school (officials do not) want 
to stick their neck out." 
</P>
<P>
Then the 15 or so El Dorado surfers approached the Boy Scouts of America, which 
agreed to sponsor and insure them. 
</P>
<P>
As an Explorer division of the Boy Scouts, they are covered by liability 
insurance, said Randy Wenz, a Scout executive. They can enter contests in the 
Inland Surf League, which was formed two years ago to give inland county teams 
a chance to surf competitively. 
</P>
<P>
The league, which has grown from three to more than 18 teams in the high school 
division, was started "to give kids an opportunity to compete," Wenz said. 
</P>
<P>
Inland teen-agers who tried to compete on their own in surfing contests 
"quickly became discouraged because they always came in last," he said. "They 
just couldn't compete against guys who live at the beach and practice every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
Team members said they need a lot practice before they will feel that they can 
compete well. 
</P>
<P>
"We are definitely behind everyone else," Ritchie said, "but the guys are just 
happy we're doing it. 
</P>
<P>
James Vartanian, the team's coach, said: "It's going to be tough, but I believe 
in them. Even if they don't win, just having them get up and do it is worth my 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Vartanian, owner of Vartanian Surfboards, met most of the boys when they came 
to him to buy boards. At 25 years old, he meets the Boy Scout requirement that 
someone over 21 be present at every event. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids talked about it for a long time," Vartanian said. "I let them know if 
they wanted it, they'd have to show some initiative." 
</P>
<P>
Vartanian said high school students should be able to participate in sports 
other than football, baseball and basketball. He began surfing 13 years ago 
because a disease affecting his knees prevented him from playing contact 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky there was a surf team at my school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Vartanian estimated that the team will need to practice at least twice during 
the week and "as much as possible" on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
But, Bakken said: "It feels great now that it's going somewhere." JULIE ESPY

COUNCIL TO CONSIDER CHANGES IN SIGN LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will consider amending its sign ordinance to improve the 
city's appearance when it meets tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The amendments represent the culmination of a seven-year effort by the city to 
find a middle ground between allowing ample advertisements for businesses but 
avoiding excessive, cluttered signs. 
</P>
<P>
"We pride ourselves on the way we look in Brea. We want to let retail, 
commercial and industrial establishments promote their businesses, but in a way 
that looks good," said Frank Benest, Brea's city manager. 
</P>
<P>
The city staff recommended several amendments to the citywide sign ordinance 
last month which were unanimously approved by the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The amendments would require those placing signs on private property to submit 
proposals to the Planning Commission for evaluation.

PEOPLE: JUGGLING DUO NOT READY FOR 9-TO-5 GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of these days, Jon M.C. Wee, 23, and Owen Norse, 22, plan on getting real 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, they're juggling their way around the country while cracking 
jokes about their seemingly uncluttered life style that started out as a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
"When we met at the International Jugglers Assn. convention in 1986, we were 
both trying to decide whether to get a real job or juggle for a living," said 
Wee, who graduated with an economics degree from Luther College in Iowa. "Both 
of us were looking for a partner." 
</P>
<P>
Norse added: "The switch from . . . thinking about getting a regular 9-to-5 
job, getting married and having kids was tough. I had to convince myself it 
would be the right decision," said the Tustin High and UC Irvine psychology 
graduate. 
</P>
<P>
They are living in Tustin while performing at Disneyland after a year on the 
road entertaining at fairs, colleges, nightclubs, and private and corporate 
parties throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to make a living from juggling as long as we can. We want to make it 
to the big time in Vegas and Atlantic City or on television," said Wee, who 
started juggling in the eighth grade, as did Norse. 
</P>
<P>
After only a year together, they won the world championship in team juggling at 
the July International Juggling Assn. contest in Baltimore. "That was our 
proudest moment," Wee said. 
</P>
<P>
Both began to juggle as a hobby. "But when we found out it was paying for 
school and leaving us with money, we found ourselves having an absolute blast," 
Norse said. 
</P>
<P>
They decided to form a comedy-juggling team -- called The Passing Zone -- last 
year after they graduated from college. Both sets of parents urged them to 
follow their feelings "and go for it. So we did," Norse said. 
</P>
<P>
Wee, who was part of a juggling team in high school, said: "In a sense, this is 
a real job. When we're not performing, we're on the phone trying to get jobs or 
else we're practicing. We're always practicing." 
</P>
<P>
With their careers on the upswing, "It's hard to picture us taking a real job," 
he said. "Suddenly, working a 9-to-5 job doesn't seem too attractive." 
</P>
<P>
Norse believes that society offers more options today to people who can turn 
hobbies, such as juggling, into lucrative businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it could happen to me until I looked at other jugglers and 
realized I was as good or better than a lot of them," said Norse, who usually 
is the butt of his partner's jokes in their comedy routine. 
</P>
<P>
"We found not too many people are interested in watching juggling alone, but 
they really tuned in when we added the comedy routine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The two jugglers seem to find themselves in perpetual motion. "We've worked 
every weekend since April and worked a lot during the week," said Wee, who 
wouldn't mind working as a comedian. 
</P>
<P>
"I've thought about stand-up comedy, but I think I'll stay with juggling and be 
funny at the same time," he said. "Comedy is a tough career. People expect you 
to be funny all the time."

When San Clemente restaurateur Robert Novello says he serves the freshest 
lobster, no one can challenge him. 
</P>
<P>
After the season opened Oct. 4, one of his lobster boats tied up at the San 
Clemente Pier and Novello helped pull up a gunny sack full of the crustaceans 
that his fishermen had just caught. 
</P>
<P>
From there, Novello took the bag into his Fisherman's Restaurant on the pier 
where the lobsters were cooked for waiting diners. 
</P>
<P>
Although he admits that hoisting the gunny sack was mainly a ceremonial 
gesture, "They still have got to be the freshest lobster anywhere," said the 
restaurant's director of operations. "It comes right out of the ocean." 
</P>

Acknowledgments -- Jay Lyttle, a Garden Grove machinist, retained his Amateur 
World Heavyweight Arm Wrestling title by defeating five challengers Sunday at 
Peak Park In Buena Park. Lyttle said he will continue to compete in other 
amateur contests but plans to turn professional next year. "Right now, I'm 
going back to the gym to continue my training," he said.

IT'S SARA NELSON'S TURN TO COURT SUCCESS AT LAGUNA BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL: WHILE STANDOUT SEAN STAFFORD IS AWAY AT COLLEGE, THE SPOTLIGHT 
TURNS TO HIS NEIGHBOR -- A VERSATILE SENIOR OUTSIDE HITTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE LOWERY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It so happened that two kids, a girl and a boy, grew up across the street from 
each other in a small, Orange County beach city. They both grew to love 
volleyball, as kids in beach towns have been known to do, and went on to star 
in the sport at the local high school. 
</P>
<P>
They shared strikingly similar styles on the court, with all-around abilities 
to dig, pass, set and hit, and they went about it with all the intensity of 
someone waiting in a bank to make a deposit. 
</P>
<P>
Sara Nelson and Sean Stafford never actually played volleyball together. 
Chances are they might have bumped a ball once or twice, since their mothers, 
Joan Nelson and Karen Stafford, were best friends and spent time at each 
other's homes. 
</P>
<P>
As it happened, Stafford was Orange County's top player last season as he led 
Laguna Beach High into the semifinals of the Southern Section championships. He 
now attends UC Santa Barbara, where he will play in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson is in the midst of her senior season at Laguna Beach, one in which she 
is making her claim as the best all-around player in the county. 
</P>
<P>
She was named most valuable player of the Orange County Championships after 
leading her team to the title of that tournament, one of the most prestigious 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Stewart, who coached the Laguna Beach boys' team with Stafford last 
season before taking over the girls' team this season, says, "the whole team 
revolves around Sara." 
</P>
<P>
And the team has spun itself right into a 10-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
All this might be surprising to some, seeing as Nelson wasn't even named to the 
All-Pacific Coast League first team last season. It seems one of the few things 
Nelson doesn't share with Stafford when it comes to volleyball is recognition. 
Stafford was well-known, well-touted and well-coveted by colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Part of Nelson's lack of recognition might be because she played with a torn 
rotator cuff last season. Part of it might be because, Nelson says, she has 
sometimes been tentative during games, afraid she might let her team down. And 
part of it might be because Nelson has been just plain overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, one other reason. Nelson is 5-feet-8. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'll get into one of the big volleyball schools," she said. 
"They want girls 6-feet tall, they want the big people. It's like they don't 
care what you can do if you don't measure up." 
</P>
<P>
What Nelson, an outside hitter, can do is just about everything. In an 
impressive show of anticipation and reaction last season, she dug hit after hit 
from Irvine's big two, Bev Oden and Melinda Norton. Laguna Beach lost that 
match, Irvine went on to win its second consecutive state championship, but 
Nelson's performance left a lasting impression. 
</P>
<P>
"What you see is a true athlete who's quick, fluid and able to always be in 
control of her body," Stewart said. "That's what really connects Sara and Sean, 
the fact that they're able to control their bodies, so after they pass they can 
get right into their hitting motion. And they both hit the ball very hard." 
</P>
<P>
And Nelson's hits seem to have a vicious streak to them because they originate 
from someone who doesn't look like a big hitter. Stewart, who took over for 
Lisa Mariotti this season, instituted weightlifting for his players, something 
Nelson says has made her stronger and more durable. 
</P>
<P>
But she had always been able to hit hard. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started playing in the sixth grade, my hits would just fly straight 
back and hit the wall," Nelson said. "The ball never got close to the ground, 
it just took off for the back wall." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson has always been a good athlete. Her father, Byron, played football at 
UCLA. Her mother taught physical education. 
</P>
<P>
"You noticed it right from the start with her," Joan Nelson said. "Her hand-eye 
coordination was amazing, even as a baby. Just the way she moved, the way she 
could catch a ball, you could just tell she was going to be an athlete." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach thought enough of her to place her on the varsity as a freshman. 
Nelson admits she was intimidated to be playing with older players and withdrew 
a bit, afraid to make a mistake. Things were more or less similar for her as a 
sophomore and as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
"She was really worried about making mistakes, about letting people down," Joan 
said. "If anything has changed about her this year it's been her confidence. 
She's not concerned what anybody thinks, she just concentrates on the game." 
</P>
<P>
And so far, all the matches have been Laguna Beach victories. Nelson 
acknowledges a difference in her outlook when she's on the court, one she 
credits Stewart with instilling in her. 
</P>
<P>
"If a coach believes in you, then you are going to believe in yourself," Nelson 
said. "He tells us just to go for it, it's not like you make one bad play and 
you're out. I know if I hit in the net a couple of times, I'm going to stay out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Which is where Stewart wants her. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always nice to have someone you can set the ball to and count on the 
kill," Stewart said. "It's always nice to have someone who, if they have the 
ball served to them, they're going to make a good pass. It keeps you from 
getting in big ruts. Having Sara on your team is like having a stopper in 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Or Sean Stafford.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
FULLBACK BYRNES ASSUMES NEW ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

FULLERTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Handing Tim Byrnes a playbook this season was like handing him a pink slip. 
</P>
<P>
Byrnes put in his time at fullback for four years, redshirting his freshman 
year and dutifully playing his part the next three. He had an 84-yard game once 
during his junior season, but everything was building toward this, his senior 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Byrnes was out of a job. Cal State Fullerton was going to a one-back 
offense, and there was no question who the one back would be -- Mike Pringle. 
</P>
<P>
In the Titans' opener, Byrnes carried the ball twice. Seven games into the 
season, he has four carries for a net yardage of zero. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the stuff of a running back's idle imaginings, nor was it the way 
Coach Gene Murphy wanted Byrnes to spend his final days as a Titan. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at your depth chart and you see who your winners are," Murphy said. 
"You've got to get him on the field." 
</P>
<P>
But what is there to do with a 5-foot-11, 215-pound fullback who has been 
rendered obsolete by a new offense? 
</P>
<P>
Murphy has made him a tight end -- a 5-foot-11 tight end. Not exactly in the 
tradition of Jim Thornton, the 6-foot-3 former Titan who plays for the Chicago 
Bears, nor even in that of 6-foot-6 Bill Brennan, Fullerton's other tight end 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Not, frankly, in the tradition of many tight ends outside of high schools and 
small colleges. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm probably the shortest tight end in college football," Byrnes said. 
</P>
<P>
To the pleasure of both Byrnes and Murphy, it has worked. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the particular position I'd like to play, but as long as I'm playing, 
that's what matters," Byrnes said. "At first, I was looking forward to carrying 
the ball, looking forward to getting the yards. Then reality set in. . . . 
After the first game I figured, hey, I can't just stand here all year, 
especially after three years of playing." 
</P>
<P>
Brennan, the starter in the first game of the season, suffered a hip pointer in 
that game and was unavailable for the next. 
</P>
<P>
Byrnes got the call. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't put a kid who played linebacker and fullback (in high school) at 
tight end," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
But that's what he did. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Titans have a tight end combination that can give defenses fits. 
</P>
<P>
With Byrnes, they have a tight end who can run with the ball once he catches 
it, a tight end who can go in motion and become the lead blocker for Pringle. 
</P>
<P>
With Brennan, they have a lanky fellow who says his favorite sport was always 
basketball anyway, and who when covered simply signals quarterback Dan Speltz 
to throw the ball high. 
</P>
<P>
Speltz lobs it, and Brennan makes defensive backs look as if they are little 
kids who want something off a high shelf -- even when they jump, the ball is 
just beyond their reach and just within Brennan's. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday against Pacific, Speltz went to Brennan, who finished with four 
catches for 74 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan has lost some playing time to Byrnes, but he isn't complaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad he's doing well," Brennan said. "If we're getting the job done, we're 
doing all right." 
</P>
<P>
Pringle's career-high 242-yard rushing, five-touchdown performance against 
Pacific not only earned him Big West Conference offensive player of the week 
honors, but also got him named national offensive player of the week by The 
Sporting News. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle had 290 all-purpose yards and remains first in the nation in 
all-purpose running at 231.7 yards a game. San Jose State's Sheldon Canley, who 
is second, trails by 19 yards. Pringle is eighth in the NCAA in rushing (124 
yards a game) and third in scoring (12 points a game). 
</P>
<P>
With 867 rushing yards this season, he needs only 133 to become the fourth 
Titan to rush for 1,000 yards in a season. Obie Graves gained 1,789 yards in 
1978; Rick Calhoun 1,398 in '86, and Dwayne Sims 1,071 in '73. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy was still irritated with the starters on Monday for allowing Pacific to 
make a close game out of what was once a 28-point Fullerton lead. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton finished with a 35-26 victory only after recovering an onside kick 
and running out the final 1:40. 
</P>
<P>
"The unfortunate thing is we have other football players who practice hard all 
year and don't get to play because other players do stupid, dumb things," 
Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (3-3-1 overall, 2-1 in the Big West) plays undefeated Fresno State in 
Fresno Saturday, taking on a team with a 13-game winning streak, second-longest 
to Notre Dame's 18 among Division I teams. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Both basketball teams have begun practice, with both preparing for 
regular-season openers Nov. 24 at Titan Gym. The men play Lamar and the women 
Weber State. . . . The soccer team (8-5-1) plays host to UC Santa Barbara on 
Friday in its final home match of the season.

ORANGE COUNTY INVESTORS;

<P>
MOST WEATHER THEIR WORRIES, SOME PROSPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL and LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lt. Col. Lonnie Howerton let his Marine Corps discipline slip a little Monday 
as he monitored the progress that his tiny stock portfolio was making in the 
day's roiling market. 
</P>
<P>
On a lunch-hour visit to his broker in Laguna Hills, Howerton -- who was in 
civilian dress for the occasion -- jammed a clenched fist high into the air, 
shouted joyfully and jumped up and down when he learned that he had made a 
profit on the AT&amp;T stock he had bought toward the bottom of Friday's 
skidding market. 
</P>
<P>
Howerton, who called himself a "very small-time investor," made $200 on the 100 
shares of AT&amp;T. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, most of the dozen regular investors who gathered in the Charles 
Schwab &amp; Co. Inc. discount brokerage office near Leisure World were subdued 
Monday. They were worried about the losses they took Friday and wondered 
whether the news would get worse. 
</P>
<P>
That pretty well describes the activity at most brokerages around Orange County 
and the nation Monday. It was a day of ups and downs. It was a day of 
nervousness and relief. It was a day of volatile trading on the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
After the Dow Jones industrial average fell 190.6-points Friday -- prompting 
investors to worry about another crash -- the market did an about-face and 
gained 88 points Monday. The increase came only after several steep drops, 
teasing investor fears of another disaster. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no repeat of two years ago, and local investors seemed to take 
the market turmoil in stride. 
</P>
<P>
Frank L. Randall III, resident vice president of the Merrill Lynch Pierce 
Fenner &amp; Smith office in Laguna Hills, said his brokers spent a lot of time 
answering phone calls from nervous investors after the market crash in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Now the same customers, he said, "feel comfortable, that they have been there 
before." Calls from customers, he said, were primarily to inquire about what 
stocks might be good buys. 
</P>
<P>
"There seem to be more buys than sells," agreed Jeffrey Kilpatrick, president 
of Newport Securities in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The regional brokerage, which specializes in the stocks of county-based 
companies, was fairly quiet Monday, in contrast with two years ago, when the 
atmosphere was tense and marked by the constant ringing of telephones and soft 
swearing of brokers watching favorite stocks take nose dives. 
</P>
<P>
Kilpatrick said investors have figured out now that "the gross numbers just 
aren't all that meaningful, now that the Dow Jones is so high." While a 
100-point dive from an 800 Dow is frightening, he said, a 200-point drop from a 
2,600-point Dow "doesn't make people panic." 
</P>
<P>
There was little panic among county companies, even though few fared well 
Monday. While the Dow gained ground, the broader markets -- where most local 
stocks are traded -- did not fare as well. On the New York Stock Exchange, more 
stocks lost value than gained Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, just 20 of the largest 126 public companies posted price 
increases, while 74 lost value. The remaining 32 finished unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The largest gain was a 7.4% increase, to $4.50 a share, by Irvine-based 
National Education Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Illustrating the fickleness of the market, EIP Microwave of Newport Beach, 
which Friday bucked the downward trend to post a 22% gain, was the loss leader 
in the county Monday. The stock dropped 18.2%, losing the entire dollar it had 
gained on Friday, to finish the day at $4.50. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of local firms caused barely a stir at the Crowell Weedon &amp; Co. 
brokerage office in Laguna Hills. At 8 a.m. Monday, Leon Bergsman, 86, was the 
only investor on hand to monitor the action. 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow the market doesn't draw them in when it is going down," Bergsman said 
of the absence of other investors. "When it is going up they are all here. Now 
they don't have the stomach." 
</P>
<P>
As the morning wore on, however, others took chairs alongside Bergsman. 
</P>
<P>
These investors, mostly retired Leisure World residents in the market for the 
long run, were not about to make rash moves. They did not even seem to be 
terribly concerned that the electronic ticker above the counter was not 
working. 
</P>
<P>
Bergsman, who went through the 1929 stock market crash as well as Black Monday 
two years ago, joked that he came in early because "I wanted to wave goodby to 
my money." 
</P>
<P>
He said his stock market investment is in "the substantial six figures." 
</P>
<P>
Bergsman said he had no intention of selling his stock, which is in such blue 
chips as IBM and Eastman Kodak. Rather, he said, "I was thinking of buying a 
couple of things." 
</P>
<P>
He said he expected "a little rally" on the market Monday and another drop 
later in the week, when he will pick up the stock he wants. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Vega also figured that he will be a buyer this week. Like other investors 
watching stock quotes on the computers at the Charles Schwab office in Laguna 
Hills, Vega said the key to making money on the market is patience. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he likes the excitement of frequent trading. "I'm a stockbroker's 
dream," he said, a reference to the commission brokers take every time a client 
buys or sells. 
</P>
<P>
Vega said he is on the lookout for attractive stocks to buy, with prices down 
for many issues. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the volatility of the market, he said he is confident about the 
strength of the economy: "There will be no downturn. People are paying their 
bills. And I should know. I'm a bill collector." 
</P>
<P>
Vega is one of the regulars at the Schwab office. He and a group of about a 
dozen friends spent Monday with eyes glued to the computer screens as they kept 
track of how they were doing. The regulars buy and sell frequently and monitor 
the market's antics on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
They divide into two basic groups. At one computer were the bears, those who 
are betting on a further drop in the market. Some insisted that Monday's rally 
was only a temporary aberration and that there is more bad news, perhaps even a 
recession, in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
At another terminal, the bulls congregated. They contend that the market is 
strong and are looking for the chance to buy stocks at bargain prices and watch 
them climb. 
</P>
<P>
The specialists in the county seem to side with the bulls. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman College economics professor James Doti, for example, said he is 
optimistic about the market because the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of most 
stocks is in the fairly conservative low teens. 
</P>
<P>
Doti -- whose own stock portfolio is almost completely limited to shares of a 
local company on whose board he serves -- said there is no comparison between 
current market events and the crash of Oct. 19, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, the PE ratio was 20.5 Now it is below 12, and the historic norm is 13 to 
14. . . . But just as happened two years ago, Friday's plunge will probably 
lead the Federal Reserve Board to drop interest rates a notch or two." 
</P>
<P>
And that, Doti said, will increase liquidity and "may put off an anticipated 
recession and keep our recovery going." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
O.C. BULLS AND BEARS 
</P>
<P>
Peter Churm, chairman, Fluorocarbon Co. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the market was ready for an adjustment. Something is terribly out of 
kilter with these crazy buyouts that add nothing to the economy. Maybe this 
will put a stop to it. That's my wish."

"I subscribe to the random walk hypothesis, which can be summed up basically by

"I have the same wait-and-see attitude as a personal investor in the stock

"Today the bond market dropped, so yields went up. That balances us out from 
Friday. We were hoping to see a repeat of what happened in 1987: The market 
drop created a bull market in bonds and lower mortgage rates. That doesn't seem 
to be the case this time."

NEW O.C. HOME SALES INCREASE IN 3RD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sales of new homes in Orange County were up 19.5% in the third quarter compared 
with the previous three-month period, while the median price of single-family 
homes dropped, according to a report released Monday by the Meyers Group, a 
real estate consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
New home sales increased to 2,970 in the three months ended Sept. 20, in 
contrast to 2,486 at the end of the spring quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the third straight quarter of overall sales increases since the 
seasonal slowdown during the last quarter of 1988," Steve Johnson, vice 
president of Meyers' Corona office, said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Sales were 2,096 for the quarter that ended in March and 2,021 for the quarter 
ended in December. 
</P>
<P>
"The total number of all types sold has increased by nearly 1,000 homes in less 
than a year, which demonstrates the continued demand of the market," Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Also between the spring quarter ended in June and the summer quarter ended in 
September, the median price for single-family detached homes dropped 5.4% to 
$350,000 from $369,000. 
</P>
<P>
"That's still the highest figure in Southern California, but it's still 
significant in that it bucks the trend of continually rising prices," Johnson 
explained. "The increase in sales can be partially attributed to the many new 
projects recently opening." 
</P>
<P>
The lowest home prices found by Meyers in the single-family category was 
$159,900 and the top of the scale was $1.15 million. "That's the biggest spread 
we have seen yet," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
While single-family homes became somewhat more affordable, the price of 
attached housing scaled upward. Condominiums and town homes sold at a median 
price of $173,000, up 3% from $167,900 in the spring. The median price for 
attached units had declined 13% in the previous three months.

EVEN HEARTS OF STONE CAN'T TURN DOWN FIRM'S CREATURES

<TEXT>
<P>
Sandy Brue is one chief executive officer who knows her animals. That is one 
reason why Brue's 8-year-old company, Sandicast, rang up annual sales of more 
than $10 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Brue links her company's success to attention to detail. She makes sure that a 
decorative "cast stone" animal sculpture looks like the real thing. So a 
Sandicast figure, whether it's a Samoyed, a Rottweiler, a sharpei, or a golden 
retriever, will look like the real McCoy, or at least the real McPup. 
</P>
<P>
Sandicast's stone menagerie includes cats and wild animals, ranging from 
raccoons to baby harp seals. But the company's line of dogs has been the 
biggest seller. Ranging in size from 3 inches long and 2 inches high to a foot 
long and 9 inches high, the canine sculptures retail from $10 to $100. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Very Classy' 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just the product," said Mifi Grosso of Just Animals in the Bazaar del 
Mundo. "The whole operation -- it's very classy. She (Brue) promotes from 
within, encourages people to be innovative. She engenders loyalty from the 
people who work with her." 
</P>
<P>
The result is that "we're right where we want to be" in the gift industry, says 
Brue, a petite woman of Italian-American ancestry who is the company president. 
Brue won't discuss figures other than to say that sales are "in the 
double-digit millions." 
</P>
<P>
Sandicast is not one of the giants of the sprawling gift industry, according to 
Brue. But her firm has carved out a strong position in the decorative animal 
sculptures market. 
</P>
<P>
"Her company is probably the single largest gift company making dogs and cats," 
said Bob Stansfield, a part owner of six Tinder Box gift and tobacco shops in 
several states. He describes Sandicast as "simply a phenomenal gift line." 
</P>
<P>
A careful, discreet chief executive, Brue learned her managerial skills on the 
job. On the face of it, Brue, an artist by calling, is an unlikely candidate to 
be president of a privately held, multimillion-dollar corporation. She has no 
MBA. In fact, Brue, who is a native San Diegan, never finished her 
undergraduate schooling (the University of San Diego and San Diego State), 
leaving to have a family. 
</P>
<P>
Until Sandicast, she devoted her energy to being a mother of four, a free-lance 
artist and an inveterate volunteer for such groups as the Children's Home 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in charge of more decorating committees than I care to say," she 
recalled. "I was always artistic. People would say, 'You should be doing 
something.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1981, Brue took a leap of faith away from free-lance 
assignments such as designing business logos. She started Sandicast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flattered by Comments 
</P>
<P>
Although flattered by a client's comments about the lifelike quality of her 
animal sculptures, it wasn't until her husband, an engineer, said that the 
family finances needed more help that Brue actually acted. 
</P>
<P>
The Brues mortgaged their house in Rancho Santa Fe, borrowed money from 
relatives, and Sandy opened a "two-employee factory" with a four-item line: a 
bunny, a squirrel, a fawn and a cocker spaniel puppy. The puppy quickly became 
extremely popular. 
</P>
<P>
At first Brue was her own sales force, lugging her sculptures to gift stores. 
Not everyone appreciated her animals. At one gift shop in La Jolla, the owner's 
response to her critters was: "Can't I get something like this in Tijuana?" 
</P>
<P>
"I came close to physical violence," Brue recalls. Then the owner forgot about 
Brue and left her cooling her heels in a hot stock room. After 20 minutes, the 
proprietor returned, listened to another presentation and advised her: "Dear, 
you should really get someone else to sell them." However, the woman made an 
order and is still a Sandicast customer. 
</P>
<P>
Describing herself as a "strong, opinionated person" Brue does not give in to 
rejection. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people just give up way too early," she says. "The minute they get 
their first no, they say, 'well I did my part.' The one thing I got from my 
mother was not to give up, to try another angle." 
</P>
<P>
She has also received a great deal of support from her husband, Bob, an 
electrical engineer who kept Sandicast's books part time, before becoming 
full-time controller after the first year and a half. Now Bob Brue is backing 
off from the operations of Sandicast to handle the family's investments. 
</P>
<P>
"I know a number of women who could be as successful, but their husband would 
not allow that," Brue said. "It would cause problems in their married life. I 
was lucky and married an '80s man in the '60s." 
</P>
<P>
Brue started a practice in 1982 of bringing out 10 or so new pieces twice a 
year. Then came an unexpected boost. About six or seven months after starting 
Sandicast, a Canadian distributor of gift products who had seen one of Brue's 
sculptures in a Carmel shop, tracked her down to her then-small factory. 
</P>
<P>
Brue was kneeling, wrapping her samples in Pampers when the distributor 
arrived. The small-time operation belied the product quality that had drawn the 
distributor. Although the first sales to Canada were small and not very 
profitable, Brue learned about exporting and was encouraged to learn that 
people in other countries liked her product. 
</P>
<P>
Rapid growth was not long in coming. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sales Continued to Grow 
</P>
<P>
"Early on I remember my husband asking, 'How big do you want this to get?,' " 
Brue said. She thought maybe $2 million. "That came and went so fast that I 
realized it wasn't that much harder to be larger." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1983, Sales had reached $3.5 million. Today the company employs 
more than 200 at its 40,000-square-foot factory headquarters off Miramar Road, 
which also turns out a new line of cast wall decorations. 
</P>
<P>
As president and resident artist, Brue still sculpts in clay and casts each 
model in Sandicast's line of more than 200 decorative animals. One of the big 
attractions of a Sandicast figure is that seemingly every hair of an animal's 
coat has been etched in. 
</P>
<P>
Brue works from live models. To get the proportions right, so that a beagle's 
muzzle does not look like a cocker spaniel's, she visits breeders to view 
champions or the San Diego Zoo for wild animals. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that Sandicast's sculptures are recognized by animal lovers the 
world over for their fidelity to living creatures. Sandicast products are sold 
in about 20 countries, including Canada, Japan and many European countries. 
</P>
<P>
"They are so realistic," said Toni Martinez, a sales clerk at Safari Animal 
Collection in Seaport Village. "That's why they sell so well. We get an order 
every week for one of the Sandicast pieces. We usually get an order every month 
for the other brands. In particular, her dogs have done so well." 
</P>
<P>
Although the retail market in general is in a slump, Brue says that Sandicast 
sales are up 26% above 1988 and that this year she added a line of mid-size 
products and a second factory shift. 
</P>
<P>
Brue distributes the animal sculptures through a selected group of 
manufacturers' representatives who work on commission rather than through a 
chain of stores. The reps are chosen by her because of the complimentary 
products of other manufacturers that they represent. 
</P>
<P>
A key to Sandicast's success, Brue acknowledged, is the placement of the 
product in better gift stores and in ensuring that those stores are not too 
close to each other.

HICKEN OF NAMED CHAIRMAN OF IRVINE-BASED ARMOR ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Armor All Products Corp., an Irvine-based supplier of automobile-care products, 
has named Kenneth C. Hicken, a McKesson Corp. executive and Armor All director, 
chairman of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Hicken succeeds Thomas W. Field Jr., who resigned last month as chairman, chief 
executive and a director of McKesson Corp., which owns 83% of Armor All, and 
concurrently as a chairman and director of Armor All. 
</P>
<P>
Field's resignation came after a dispute with McKesson's board over his 
management style and plans for the company. McKesson, based in San Francisco, 
is a $7-billion company that distributes drugs and health-care products. 
</P>
<P>
Hicken, 61, has held various management positions since joining McKesson in 
1965 and is executive vice president of operations. Before coming to McKesson, 
he held several managerial posts at Stokely-Van Camp Inc. (1961-65) and General 
Foods Corp. (1951-61). 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Pace University in New York, Hicken plans to work out of his

TOYON QUINTET OPENS CHAMBER MUSIC SEASON AT UC IRVINE WITH SOME COLOR

The Toyon Woodwind Quintet opened the third season of the UC Irvine Chamber 
Music series Sunday night. While the program of 19th- and 20th-Century French 
compositions did not tax audience intellects, it did at least tickle fancies at 
the Fine Arts Concert Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The jaunty red bow ties with matching cummerbunds sported by Gary Bovyer and 
Lawrence Kaplan should have hinted that this was not to be an evening of grave 
profundity. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the recently formed quintet -- Leanne Becknell, oboe (replaced on this 
occasion by Leslie Reed); Bovyer, clarinet; Rose Corrigan, bassoon; Carol Bacon 
Drake, horn; Kaplan, flute (all except Becknell and Kaplan are UCI faculty 
members) -- teased their listeners with good-natured humor -- particularly in 
the impish Allegro of Ibert's "Trois pieces breves" and the tongue-twisting 
flutter of tripping motives in the Vivace of Taffanel's Quintet. 
</P>
<P>
But the humor was strengthened by focused tone, well-considered balance and 
technical ease. And, despite the frivolous nature of some of the selections, 
the quintet members did not fail to attend to minute details of phrasing and 
dynamic sweep. Moreover, the cotton-candy fluff of Ibert and Taffanel did taste 
of enough sugar and fun that one hardly minded the lack of substance. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the program sparkled with elegant pastoral indulgence. 
Kaplan's flute served Debussy with a shimmeringly round-toned "Syrinx." 
Clarinetist Emily Bernstein and bassoonist John Steinmetz joined the quintet 
for the poignant folk scenes of d'Indy's "Chansons et danses." 
</P>
<P>
Two solos highlighted this final septet -- Drake's beckoning horn passage and 
Reed's searchingly caressing oboe melody. These, coupled with the restraint and 
coordination that had characterized earlier offerings, created a movingly 
pensive closing.

NRBQ GETTING BACK ON TRACK AFTER 6-YEAR RECORD LOCKOUT; 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ: TWO YEARS AFTER THE LEGAL WRANGLING FINALLY ENDED, THE BAND IS TOURING 
WITH R.E.M. AND WILL BE IN COSTA MESA WEDNESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Sometimes we look at each other and have to laugh," keyboardist Terry Adams 
says of his band mates in NRBQ, "and think that it's great that we're getting 
away with what we're doing, and even getting paid for it." 
</P>
<P>
Adams and bassist Joey Spampinato founded the New Rhythm and Blues Quartet 21 
years ago, with guitarist Al Anderson and drummer Tom Ardolino rounding out the 
lineup for the last 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
In that time the band has pursued a gleeful, border-less mix of American 
musical styles -- they call it "omni-pop" -- that ranges from free jazz to 
straight-ahead rock to country, bouncing off all points in between, with Adams' 
keyboard style often described as a cross between Thelonious Monk and Jerry Lee 
Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
That facility has found them equally at home at the Berlin Jazz Festival, on 
the Grand Ole Opry stage, on Hal Wilner's eclectic collections of Monk and 
Disney tunes, on "The Care Bears Movie" sound track, and, as they are presently 
engaged, opening for R.E.M. on its current tour. (The two bands perform 
Wednesday at Costa Mesa's Pacific Amphitheatre, after NRBQ squeezes in a club 
gig tonight at the Strand in Redondo Beach.) 
</P>
<P>
The R.E.M. tour and a new album "Wild Weekend" on Virgin Records are hopeful 
signs of change of fortune, but NRBQ's commercial career hasn't been a thing 
that would cause many musicians to smile. 
</P>
<P>
The band's fans include R.E.M., Bonnie Raitt, Keith Richards (who used 
Spampinato on his solo album and in his dream band for the "Chuck Berry, Hail! 
Hail! Rock 'n' Roll" film), Pat Metheny, Elvis Costello and others. 
</P>
<P>
But outside the music community, NRBQ has remained very much a cult quantity. 
That status was reinforced by a legal wrangle with a former label that 
prevented the group from recording for six years. 
</P>
<P>
Though Adams is well-versed in budget dining -- a vegetarian, he recommends 
Taco Bell's 40-cent lard-free refried beans -- he remains unguardedly 
optimistic about the band's fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
Of the six-year lockout, he only says, "We saved up a lot of good songs that 
way." Once their legal problems were resolved two years ago, within days the 
band had recorded a pair of live albums. Now, with Virgin behind the band, he 
thinks that the "Wild Weekend" studio album will find new fans. 
</P>
<P>
"People have never really rejected the music; they just have never heard it. I 
really think that's the reason why it hasn't taken off or been as huge as we 
may think it should be. And with a major label now and the R.E.M. tour, we're 
getting heard more all the time." 
</P>
<P>
"Wild Weekend" may well be the finest of the group's 17 albums, bristling with 
some of the best pop hooks since Brian Wilson's heyday, performed with a 
playground zeal coupled with a musicianship so good they make it seem 
effortless. Their lyrical topics range from ideal romantic love, to car love 
(Adams' "Little Floater," with the line "I love you, zoom, zoom, zoom") to a 
loopy tribute to zydeco accordionist Boozoo Chavis. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want lyric sheets in our records," Adams said, "It always bothers 
me when people start reading along to a record instead of listening." 
</P>
<P>
While it has caused the band to be dismissed by some critics, the lack of 
heavy-handed messages in the NRBQ's lyrics serves to focus on the music, where, 
like the best of ululant early rock, a sense of commitment to life is more than 
implicit. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really think music should be anything other than what can make people 
feel good," Adams said. "I like to get a good feeling from anything, whether 
it's listening to jazz or country or what. If you don't watch it, you can come 
in with lyrics that are depressing and come up with songs where you wonder what 
you're listening to it for." 
</P>
<P>
Active in Greenpeace and animal rights for years, Adams is encouraged to see 
those and sundry movements gaining momentum. "It's great to see the response 
Greenpeace is getting on this tour (the organization has representatives at the 
shows). When we and R.E.M. are off stage, we've got lots to talk about because 
some of us are vegetarians and we've been Greenpeace supporters for years. 
We're getting to be pretty good friends now." 
</P>
<P>
The group also has been making friends while on stage, if the several encore 
calls they've gotten so far on the tour are an indication. Adams prefers that 
reaction to some of the band's experiences in years past opening for other 
acts, which have included an ill-fated slot with Deep Purple and a stint with 
Charlie Daniels and the Outlaws, where the band was booed off after responding 
to the cowboy-hat fever of the day by wearing Indian headbands on stage. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said the current tour shows are more organized than the average NRBQ 
appearance, where the group is legend for flying without a set list and 
sometime tackling songs by the Chipmunks or the Carpenters. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the same amount we want to say, but in a shorter space, so it's a 
little bit more structured than usual. But we still haven't played the same 
show twice on the tour." 
</P>
<P>
That level of musical confidence and trust stems in part from the friendship 
shared by the band members. "We wouldn't have been able to stay together this 
long without that. I know if you were to try to replace any one guy in the band 
it would mess everything up. 
</P>
<P>
"I think each guy is in his own world, but those worlds collide in the right 
way. I think maybe when we were growing up we all had open minds, and now are 
able to express ourselves together in a way that no one else can, in any way 
that we want to. I've been free, fortunate and gifted enough that I've been 
able to do this and never had to do anything else, and never had anyone tell me 
how to do it or what to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Now 42, Adams doesn't expect that commercial success, or a continued lack of 
it, will change the band. 
</P>
<P>
"We've already done 20 years; we might as well keep going. I wouldn't have 
wanted to spend that 20 any other way. I really feel lucky to have been able to 
do this, so I owe something back to that. A lot of times you feel off of (some) 
music that somebody's only concerned with their own success and not with 
anything relating to life itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Musicians owe it to life, to get that life into their music. I know I've got 
that from others, from (iconoclastic jazzman) Sun Ra and the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, Piano Red used to say, 'Music is medicine, and if you don't leave 
this place feeling better than you came in, you can have your money back.' I 
don't really feel that I have the ability to express what we try to get across 
with anything other than music. There's no putting it in words." 
</P>

A 21-year-old rock climber was rescued by Los Angeles firefighters after she 
became stranded after dark on a high hillside ledge at Chatsworth Park, 
authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, whose name was not released, had climbed with a companion Monday up 
the side of the rocky hill that rims the park but became too frightened to 
climb down when it grew dark, Fire Department spokesman Alan Barrios said. 
</P>
<P>
About 8:30 p.m. after the companion climbed down and alerted authorities, two 
Fire Department helicopters hovered above the rugged hillside and aimed 
spotlights on the woman, who was on a ledge near the top, Barrios said. 
</P>
<P>
A group of firefighters climbed up and led her down, Barrios said. The woman 
was uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
"She was all right," Barrios said. "She had just been afraid."

ORANGE COUNTY TO BUILD STATE'S 1ST GENETIC TESTING LABORATORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously today to build what 
will become the first genetic testing laboratory in California and the third in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The DNA lab, providing sophisticated crime-fighting tools, will be built with 
$120,000 from county funds and $80,000 raised from private sources. The lab, to 
open by the end of the year, will initially operate out of the county coroner's 
offices in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The vote followed an emotional meeting earlier this month at which the board's 
only woman member, Harriett M. Wieder, questioned her male colleagues' concern 
for female rape victims because of their refusal to quickly pay for a "genetic 
fingerprinting" lab. The latest push for the DNA lab followed the rape of a 
12-year-old girl in the same Huntington Beach neighborhood where Wieder lives. 
</P>
<P>
Board members praised Supervisor Don Roth for his request two weeks ago to find 
ways to finance the genetic testing lab without dipping into the general fund. 
</P>
<P>
"Victims of crimes will be spared from painful and repeated efforts to identify 
violent criminals," Roth said. "And let the word go out into the criminal world 
that Orange County will have the most modern crime-fighting tools in our 
arsenal -- a DNA lab."

President Bush assured South Korean President Roh Tae Woo today that the United 
States will stand by its security commitments, but said South Korea must open 
its markets more to U.S. products. 
</P>
<P>
With Roh standing at his side in the East Room of the White House after more 
than two hours of talks, Bush promised that U.S. forces will remain in South 
Korea "as long as there is a threat from the north." He expressed support for 
Roh's efforts to reduce tensions on the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that while Korean workers and companies have benefited from access 
to open markets in the United States, "American workers and companies deserve 
equal access to Korean markets."

Stocks retreated today following two of the wildest sessions on Wall Street 
since the October, 1987, market crash. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 18.65 points to 2,638.73 
after spiking down as much as 63 points around 11:30 a.m. Broader market 
indicators also fell. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow average had plummeted 190.58 points on Friday and bounced back with an 
88.12-point gain on Monday, leaving investors groping for stable ground. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department handed the market some bad news today with its report 
that the merchandise trade deficit rose nearly 31% in August to $10.77 billion 
from a revised July deficit of $8.24 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts did not all agree that the big trade deficit was a major factor in 
today's stock decline. Some noted that bonds and the dollar -- which are most 
sensitive to bad trade figures -- held up relatively well. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar recovered after a sharp drop that followed the trade report, while 
bonds were mixed -- an indication that investors were not seriously worried 
about worsening inflation and higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve injected another $1.5 billion into the banking system today 
after adding $2 billion in reserves on Monday. Banks will be able to use the 
new reserves to make loans, including coming to the assistance of brokerage 
firms caught in a cash squeeze because of the drop in stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks remain somewhat unstable after the drastic moves of the past two 
sessions, some analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's much more going on in the stock market at the moment than the trade 
numbers," said Lawrence A. Veit, international economist at Brown Brothers 
Harriman &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll tend to see somewhat accentuated volatility this week and next," said 
Giulio Martini, economist at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
In the overall New York Stock Exchange today, declining issues outpaced 
advances by almost 3 to 2. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled a 
heavier-than-usual 224.07 million shares, with the heaviest action in the early 
going. 
</P>

The NYSE's composite index slid 0.87 to 188.89.

Attendance plummeted at Beverly Hills schools today as a teachers' strike 
against the elite district entered its second day with no sign of a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Students gathered for a brief morning rally outside Beverly Hills High School, 
shouting "Scabs, go home!" and "We want our teachers!" One student held up a 
sign that said "Students Can't Achieve With Bums." Beverly Hills police 
officers were evident at the rally, but there were no incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills Unified Supt. Robert L. French estimated that about 125 students 
walked out of class, but students and other observers said the number was 
closer to 200. 
</P>
<P>
Only a small number of students appeared to return to class. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is at Disneyland today," Doron Barness, 15, said. "I wanted to go, 
but I decided to support my teachers instead." 
</P>
<P>
Rady Rahban, 16, said his substitute teacher brought a VCR and television to 
class and showed basketball "bloopers." 
</P>
<P>
French said enrollment districtwide had dropped from 80% Monday to 53% this 
morning. Attendance was lowest at Beverly Hills High -- 42% -- while attendance 
at the district's four elementary schools was 62%, French said. 
</P>
<P>
The district has a total of 4,700 students, with 2,029 at the high school.

COLOMBIAN JUDGE SLAIN IN DRUG TRAFFIC CAPITAL

A federal judge was gunned down today as he waited on a Medellin street corner 
for a ride to work, and an anonymous caller said drug traffickers killed him in 
retaliation for extraditions to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Courts were paralyzed in Medellin after the slaying and judges announced a 
72-hour strike to press security demands. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Judge Hector Jimenez Rodriguez was shot six times by a passenger on 
a motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman got off the motorcycle, walked up to Jimenez and shot him, the 
Colombian radio chain Caracol quoted witnesses as saying in Medellin, the base 
of the country's most notorious cocaine cartel. 
</P>
<P>
An anonymous caller to Caracol said the judge was slain by "The Extraditables," 
a group of suspected drug traffickers being hunted for extradition to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The government of President Virgilio Barco Vargas has extradited four 
Colombians to the United States, including three last Saturday, since a 
crackdown on drug trafficking began Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
"The Extraditables" said in a communique soon after the crackdown began that 
they would kill 10 judges for every Colombian extradited. Jimenez was the first 
judge killed since the drug sweep started. It was not immediately known if 
Jimenez had been involved in any recent extradition cases. 
</P>
<P>
Court activity in Medellin came to a standstill as judges met behind closed 
doors to decide what to do, an executive of the Assn. of Judicial Employees 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, the National Judicial Assn. announced a three-day strike beginning 
Wednesday to protest the government's "lack of protection granted to judges," 
an association spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Colombia's 4,379 judges last month had threatened to go on strike unless they 
received assurances about concrete measures to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
Supreme Court President Fabio Moron urged the government today to "quickly 
adopt those measures," which include armored cars and guards assigned to 
judges' homes and offices. 
</P>
<P>
There are varying figures on the number of judges that have been killed in 
Colombia, but the Justice Ministry says about 50 judges and 170 judicial 
employees have been killed since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, a suspected drug trafficker sought for extradition by 
the United States escaped from a hospital in the Caribbean port city of 
Barranquilla Monday, apparently with the complicity of an army corporal, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Humberto Gomez Zapata, 36, who had been detained Sept. 21 and was to be 
transferred to Bogota to await extradition to Florida, vanished without a trace 
from the city's main hospital where he was recovering from an appendectomy. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital workers said the corporal gave drugged coffee to 14 people, including 
nine soldiers, who were guarding Gomez. He apparently left the hospital dressed 
as a soldier.

BUSH WILL VETO RAPE AND INCEST ABORTION BILL, WHITE HOUSE SAYS

President Bush will veto a bill allowing federally financed abortions in cases 
of rape and incest after giving up efforts to find a compromise, his spokesman 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the provision, part of a 
spending bill already approved by a House-Senate conference committee and the 
full House, will be vetoed once it wins final Senate approval. 
</P>
<P>
The White House had previously hinted that a veto was likely. Today, Fitzwater 
said it flatly. 
</P>
<P>
The White House abandoned the bid for a compromise after Chief of Staff John H. 
Sununu met for a second day Monday with leading anti-abortion congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked to people on all sides of the issue. . . . We couldn't find any 
flexibility," Fitzwater said today. 
</P>
<P>
Bush last week he said he was seeking "room for flexibility" to avert a veto. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional Democratic leaders have already conceded that they do not have 
enough votes to override a veto of the measure, which has already passed the 
House.

Former world heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali was quoted today as 
saying black Christians should have their own black Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
Ali, in an interview with the Sun, said the traditional portrayal of Jesus, 
angels and saints as white was meant to reinforce white supremacy and make 
blacks feel inferior. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason is because the whites didn't want their children to see a (black 
man) up there on the cross," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"If they continue with their icons, then black people should put up their own 
of a black Jesus, black saints and black angels. To them, Jesus is black, 
should be black. But to God he is no color." 
</P>
<P>
The Sun quoted a Catholic Church spokesman as saying that he would not take on 
Ali in the ring but that he was wrong. "Jesus was Middle Eastern," the 
spokesman said.

An Illinois House committee today voted to block further action on abortion 
restrictions designed to mirror the Missouri law upheld in July by the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The measure fell one vote short of the 10 needed to clear the House Rules 
Committee and move to the full House. Nine lawmakers voted in favor of the 
measure, eight against. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortion lawmakers have said they might try to bypass the committee and 
bring the issue to the House, but some parliamentary experts have questioned 
whether that is possible. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief debate before the vote, anti-abortion lawmakers said the measure 
adheres to the guidelines set down by the Supreme Court and that it was an 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice lawmakers argued that the measure was being rushed to final passage 
and amounts to "harassment" of physicians and women needing late-term 
abortions.

President Bush has decided to nominate Antonia Novello, a public health service 
officer, to replace C. Everett Koop as U.S. surgeon general, Administration and 
congressional sources said today. If confirmed by the Senate, she would become 
the first woman to serve in the post. 
</P>
<P>
"FBI background checks on her are under way," one White House source said. 
"That's the only thing that would derail it, and we don't expect that to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Novello, 44, is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and 
Human Development, a component of the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
A Novello aide said she would have no comment about her possible appointment to 
the post. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Puerto Rico, Novello began her career at NIH in 1978. She earned a 
doctorate from the School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials have been eager to name Latinos to highly visible 
Administration posts in order to fulfill a pledge Bush made during last year's 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has two Latinos in the Cabinet, Education Secretary 
Lauro F. Cavazos, who was initially appointed to the post by former President 
Ronald Reagan, and Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of Novello was expected to be greeted warmly in Congress, where 
her appearances before congressional committees have won praise, staff members 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"She can handle herself well," said one staff member of a congressional health 
committee. "She's a good choice." 
</P>
<P>
As an NIH congressional fellow, she served for two years as a physician adviser 
to Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), who was then chairman of the Senate Labor 
Committee with jurisdiction over national health policy. 
</P>
<P>
Her appointment to the post of surgeon general was strongly backed by Hatch, 
currently the top Republican on the labor committee. 
</P>
<P>
The post of surgeon general is largely symbolic, and has few official powers. 
Koop, however, took the job to the limits by using it as a pulpit to preach 
public health policy outside the formal policy-making loop. 
</P>
<P>
He took a hard line, for example, against smoking despite extensive political 
pressure from the tobacco industry and generated an uproar by urging detailed 
discussion of sexual activity as part of an AIDS education program. 
</P>
<P>
An anti-abortion activist before his appointment to the job, Koop initially was 
treated as a pariah by the public health community and by pro-choice forces. 
</P>
<P>
His outspoken advocacy of common-sense health approaches and his political 
courage soon won him the admiration of the very groups who had strongly opposed 
his appointment.

FISHING DISPUTE WITH CANADA WON BY U.S.

A joint dispute settlement panel has found that a Canadian rule requiring 
certain fish to be brought to shore before export to the United States violates 
the U.S.-Canada free trade pact, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Canadian rule, all Pacific salmon and roe herring caught in Canadian 
waters must be landed in British Columbia before being exported. 
</P>
<P>
The United States charged that this is an effort to protect the Canadian 
fish-processing industry from U.S. competition. 
</P>
<P>
The panel rejected Canadian arguments that the landing requirement could be 
justified on conservation grounds and agreed with the United States that it 
impeded the free flow of unprocessed fish. 
</P>
<P>
The panel was the first mechanism of its type to be set up under the historic 
trade pact between the two countries that was signed in January. 
</P>
<P>
"We are gratified that the panel has confirmed that Canada's landing 
requirement is inconsistent with the FTA (free-trade agreement)," U.S. Trade 
Representative Carla Anderson Hills said Monday. "We fully expect that Canada 
will promptly comply with the panel's ruling." 
</P>
<P>
Under the free trade pact, the Canada-U.S. Trade Commission has until Nov. 13 
to reach a mutually satisfactory solution to the dispute. If no solution is 
reached by then, the free trade agreement provides that the United States can 
suspend equivalent benefits to Canada.

U.S. SEEKS AID OF JAPANESE IN S&amp;L BAILOUT

<P>
The United States today took the first concrete step to enlist Japanese 
investors in the bailout of its ailing savings-and-loan institutions with a 
presentation by a top-level team in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Resolution Funding Corp., including a high-level U.S. Treasury 
official, presented details of an auction of securities to be held next week 
and aimed at raising funds to rescue the troubled thrift industry. 
</P>
<P>
Congress authorized total borrowing of $50 billion to pay for the S&amp;L 
cleanup. The first $20 billion has already been borrowed by the Treasury 
Department, and most of that amount has been spent by the Resolution Trust 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The presentation was attended by about 75 local dealers in U.S. Treasury bonds 
and their clients. 
</P>
<P>
The agency will auction Oct. 25 the first installment of Resolution Trust Corp. 
bonds, which will be used to fund ailing thrift institutions, the officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said the meeting here was aimed at ensuring that Japanese 
investors have enough information to participate in that auction. 
</P>
<P>
A dealer at the meeting said Japanese investors will find the securities 
attractive if their yield spread above Treasury issues is large enough to 
compensate for expected poorer liquidity. 
</P>
<P>
The thrifts are expected to bear the main responsibility for making interest 
payments, through asset sales if needed, but the U.S. Treasury is prepared to 
make payments that they are unable to cover. However, RTC officials emphasized 
that the bonds are not full-faith obligations of the U.S. government.

The child-care subsidiary owns and operates 115 facilities in 12 states and 
manages two centers for other employers. Revenues for the fiscal year ended 
March 31 exceeded $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
Gerber Chairman David W. Johnson said divestiture of the child-care subsidiary

Gerber has retained Salomon Brothers Inc. as its exclusive financial adviser in

The oil and auto industries, seeking to influence the outcome of Congress' 
debate over alternative motor fuels, today announced a joint program to test 
the pollution-cutting benefits of gasoline against methanol. 
</P>
<P>
Keith McHenry, senior vice president of technology at Amoco Corp., said the 
$11-million testing program would provide an "objective assessment" of the 
relative air quality benefits of methanol and new formulations of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
The joint program, involving the Big Three auto companies and the 14 largest 
oil companies, is to begin immediately. A report on findings is due by next 
July or August. 
</P>
<P>
McHenry said too little was now known about the emission-reduction potential of 
methanol and reformulated gasoline for Congress and the states to make good 
decisions on policies aimed at curbing smog caused largely by burning fossil 
fuels.

Ford Motor Co. snapped up millions of bargain-value shares in Britain's luxury 
car firm Jaguar as stock prices tumbled worldwide, the company disclosed today. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, which is vying for the prestigious Jaguar name with rival General Motors, 
said today it has doubled its share to 10.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Ford said it had bought or agreed to buy 19.04 million Jaguar shares by the end 
of trading Monday when prices slumped by the biggest margin since the Black 
Monday crash of October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, the world's No. 2 car maker, has said it aims to boost its stake in 
Jaguar to 15%, the maximum allowed by Britain's Conservative government when it 
privatized the former state-run firm in 1984. That special "golden share" 
blocking rule runs out in 1990.

The Colts' Eric Dickerson, slowed by a hamstring injury the last three weeks 
and held to only 35 yards in a 14-3 loss at Denver on Sunday, says he is 
considering retirement from football when his contract expires after the 1990 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson, 29, who earlier this season became only the seventh player in NFL 
history to rush for 10,000 or more career yards, made the comment Monday night 
on the Arsenio Hall television talk show. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been thinking about it awhile," Dickerson told Hall. "After this season, 
I have one year left. I'll play that for sure. But even if they offered me a 
new contract, I don't think I'd sign it right now." 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson, who moved to Indianapolis in a trade with the Rams early in the 1987 
season, has carried the ball 115 times for 481 yards and three touchdowns this 
year. Last year, with 1,659 yards, he was the NFL rushing leader for the fourth 
time in his six-year career. 
</P>
<P>
He has 10,396 career yards.

Puerto Rican gymnast Adriana Duffy, who suffered a broken neck last week during 
preparations for the World Championships, remains paralyzed in the legs and 
will go to the United States for further treatment, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy, 18, fell on her neck after her hands slipped during a vault exercise 
late Thursday. She underwent a two-hour emergency operation. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is stable now, but of course it is still very bad," said Puerto 
Rican trainer Ivan Rohena. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the world championships have said chances of paralysis are greater 
than chances that she will walk again. They said her parents will be able to 
take her back home by the end of the week, but no date of departure has been 
decided yet, according to Rohena. 
</P>
<P>
She will be taken to the United States for further treatment at a later date, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Delegations from the 47 other participating nations in the world championships 
and the organizing committee have set up a charity fund to help Duffy in her 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy was Puerto Rico's best gymnast at the 1987 World Championships in 
Rotterdam, the Netherlands.
