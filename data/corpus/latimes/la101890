Well, the latest state elections are over in Germany, and the folks at Killer 
Music in Hollywood are happy with the results. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the Christian Democratic Union's ruling coalition scored a near 
sweep. 
</P>
<P>
Killer Music, you see, wrote the CDU's campaign song, "Touch the Future," which 
has been getting plenty of air time on radio in Germany. The big test will be 
in less than two months, when the national elections are held. 
</P>
<P>
Killer was chosen for the job, Executive Vice President Dain Blair said, 
because it has composed numerous commercial songs for U.S. and international 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
"Touch the Future," an inspirational-type ditty with lyrics like, "See the sun 
rise / Feel the power," never mentions the CDU or Helmut Kohl. And it's in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
"When we asked why (the CDU wanted English lyrics)," Blair said, "they told us 
they were seeking support from a younger demographic group. And the youth of 
Germany grew up listening to American and British pop records." 
</P>
<P>
The following are some memorable student evaluations of psychology professors 
and teaching assistants at one institution of higher learning.

* "Brown shoes do not go with black pants." 
</P>
<P>
* "You're really cool, like, y'know, but you wrinkle your eyebrows funny." 
</P>
<P>
* "Russ is too tall." 
</P>
<P>
* "Dude, the earring is really nice. But get a life, you're not the teacher. I 
mean, give us a break, your lectures are dry. But I really like you. Chow 
(sic), baby."

This time, the visitors were fans of the "Rocky Horror Picture Show," who

The traffic mess is worse than ever, of course. But newcomers to L.A. can take 
some comfort in the fact that it's been a problem for decades. Thirty years 
ago, in fact, the late Bill Kennedy wrote in his "Mr. L.A." column in the late 
Herald-Express: 
</P>
<P>
"Here is the perfect solution for our traffic problem: Make all L.A. streets 
and freeways one way, going north. So what happens then? Who cares? Then it's 
Santa Barbara's problem." 
</P>
<P>
In its eternal search for knowledge, Only in L.A. was struck by this 
philosophical observation:

"It is not impolite to pass others in line if there is a vacant space ahead."

COST OF LAWYERS

<TEXT>
<P>
In response to University of Texas economist Stephen Magee's statement (Oct. 8) 
that due to the plague of lawyers, each new lawyer produced by our law schools 
costs the U.S. economy $1 million a year in generating spurious conflict: 
</P>
<P>
I have been an attorney for eight years. I have cost the U.S. economy $8 
million and I am ashamed. 
</P>
<P>
The solution is for me to get out of the business. Get out and stay out. I am 
willing to remain conflict-free at a cost to the government of only a $500,000 
per year subsidy not to practice law. If a dispute arises at any point during 
the period of subsidizing, I promise that I will see you in court.

In response to "Much Too Close for Comfort" (editorial, Oct. 11): 
</P>
<P>
The best thing that can be said about Louisiana's primary is not that Duke 
lost, but that hopefully it sends a message to our self-serving politicians 
that the electorate is becoming fed up with candidates whose positions depend 
solely upon which special-interest group they are speaking to at the time. Like 
it or not, at least we know exactly where Duke stands. 
</P>
<P>
And the demagogue who arises in California won't claim that the government sold 
the state to the immigrants; he will claim, justifiably, that the politicians 
gave it to them.

RODRIGUEZ ON POLICE BRUTALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Obviously, no useful purpose would be served by attempting to contradict 
Rodriguez's diatribe against law enforcement. However, I can and will dispute 
his facts. 
</P>
<P>
In the third paragraph, Rodriguez states " . . . two off-duty Los Angeles 
County deputies and a Maywood officer stormed a Maywood city jail cell and beat 
Marino D. Castillo. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In the first place, the precautionary term "allegedly" might be a wise idea to 
insert in this statement. I have noted that this is standard practice for The 
Times when talking about murderers and rapists, but apparently not when talking 
about police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, if Rodriguez wishes to attack the police, perhaps he should at least 
accuse the correct department. In the original account of the incident, 
published in The Times, it was very clearly stated that the two deputy sheriffs 
allegedly involved were from the Orange County Sheriff's Department, not Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
As a sergeant (and a sworn deputy) on the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department, I feel that by his statement, Rodriguez has incorrectly and 
unfairly besmirched my reputation and that of my colleagues.

WHERE PREDATORS FEED; 
</P>
<P>
POLICE: RUSSELL KUSTER PAID WITH HIS LIFE FOR THE DEFICIENCIES OF THE REST OF 
THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD PETIEVICH, Gerald Petievich comes from a police family and is the 
author of To Live and Die in L.A. (Pocket Books, 1989). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The murder of Detective Russell Kuster during a shoot-out with a parolee, an 
undocumented alien felon, is more than a brutal crime. It's a grim reminder of 
the twilight world that cops work in, this place where predators feed on 
humankind. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Kuster served 24 years in the Los Angeles Police Department. Like every 
other homicide officer, he became hardened, cynical. Spending one's career in a 
world ruled by the worst human impulses, constantly reminded of mortality, cops 
become pessimistic. In this universe of brutality, psychopathy and rage, they 
become inured -- perhaps a better word is insensitive -- to calamity. It's a 
defense mechanism. Once, at the scene of a homicide, I stared in horror at the 
bullet-riddled corpse. "You're not staring at a person," a veteran detective 
said calmly, making notes on his clipboard. "The suffering is over and that's 
just something that was left behind." A healthy way, I thought, of dealing with 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
The mind-set of the veteran cop is that the horror always happens to someone 
else, that victims are the naive, those without the ability to sense danger. 
But when a cop is killed, the wall of protection shatters. The impenetrable 
shield has failed and the infidels are inside the castle. 
</P>
<P>
So, yes, cops use insensitivity as a way to keep sane in an upside-down world. 
But the broken-down judicial process is another matter. Police see the system 
as insensitive at its very core, a victim of the "God complex." 
</P>
<P>
Overburdened district attorneys convince themselves that there is no 
alternative and heedlessly justify plea-bargaining even in murder and child 
molestation cases. Who's to complain? Certainly not the accused. Judges, 
weighed down with cases and benumbed by the system, eventually decide to make 
it easy on themselves and begin dispensing lighter sentences. The defense 
attorneys appearing in their court start to speak well of them and the stress 
eases. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers, officers of the court, show their extraordinary dispassion 
concerning right and wrong by making the courtroom an adversarial game, an 
arena for solipsistic argument and clever tricks. Parole officials, dealing 
with thousands of felons over long periods of time, simply give up and go along 
with the program, which calls for releasing lifetime career psychopaths back 
onto the street. After all, they didn't create the laws or the sentences. And 
our politicians, anesthetized by complaints and crime, tell us that the problem 
is getting better. As for the rest of us, we simply choose the avoid the issue. 
Like the apathetic functionaries in the judicial system, we of the middle class 
are generally afforded the luxury of distance from the crime problem. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers are afforded no such distance. They get no time for 
deliberation, no chance to consider the arguments, no time to refer the matter 
to committee, no opportunity to ignore crime. There was a call for help, and as 
a cop, Russell Kuster met his duty alone, without benefit of judicial robe, 
three-piece suit, magic, religion, sheepskin or clever academic precept. He 
lost his life and he got his man. 
</P>
<P>
The cops -- his friends, those men with hardened hearts, cried. But their tears 
were as much for an unfeeling, decayed judicial system as for a fallen hero.

PEOPLE ARE MOVING UP, THE AMERICAN WAY; 
</P>
<P>
NOT JUST THE RICH ARE GETTING RICHER. IN FACT, MOST PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GETTING 
RICHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL NOVAK, Michael Novak, theologian and author, holds the George 
Frederick Jewett Chair at the American Enterprise Institute and publishes 
Crisis, a journal of lay Catholic opinion. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everybody these days is beating up on "the rich." Most of those who do so 
carefully define "rich" at a level just above their own. Some of the people I 
know who speak bitterly about "the rich" are themselves, compared with most 
Americans, up in the stratosphere at $100,000 or more per year. For the public, 
"rich" begins at about $50,000 per year -- the top 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Just who are these "rich" Americans? The most striking characteristic of the 
top 20% is this: More than any other quintile, it consists almost entirely of 
families (90%) and married couples (82%). It has four times more married 
couples than the bottom quintile. In fact, each of the four higher quintiles 
contains more married couples than the one just below it. Marriage correlates 
with income. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Some argue that marriage is good for morale and motivation. It certainly 
gives a point to hard work. Without question, the top quintile has far more 
workers per household than any other. The Census Bureau reports that a 
spectacular 93% of the householders in the top quintile work full time 
(considerably more than in lower quintiles) and that 83% of its households have 
two to four earners. The average number of full-time workers per family in the 
top quintile is seven times larger than in the bottom, and almost 50% larger 
than in the other three. These rich may earn a lot, but most also work a lot. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, people in the top quintile have more years of education, buy and 
read more books and subscribe to more magazines. Two-thirds of them have had at 
least some college, and almost half have had four years or more. You don't have 
to be a college graduate to be in the top quintile: 32% completed only high 
school or less. But years of education do pay off. 
</P>
<P>
During the Reagan years, of course, it became harder and harder to "make the 
cut" into the top 20%, top 5%, top 1%. Not because times were bad, but because 
they were so prosperous that the dividing line between brackets kept sweeping 
upward, sometimes galloping upward. Between 1980 and 1988, in constant 1988 
dollars, the number of households earning $50,000 or more jumped by 6.3 
million. The proportion of all households earning above $50,000 increased from 
15.8% to 20.8%. In 1980, it took only $29,070 in annual income to make it into 
the top 20%, but by 1988 it took $50,593 (in constant 1988 dollars). 
</P>
<P>
A case of the rich getting richer? Not at all. Most people got richer. The 
Census Bureau divides all households into nine income brackets. Between 1980 
and 1988, significant percentages in every bracket moved up. At the same time, 
the proportion of households in the brackets below $50,000 decreased, while the 
proportion of those who made more than $50,000 increased. For example, those 
earning under $15,000 decreased from 28.8% to 27.3% and those earning from 
$15,000 to $49,000 decreased from 55% to 51.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Where did all these folks go? They moved up. The $50,000-$74,999 bracket 
increased from 11.3% to 13.4%; the $75,000-$99,999 bracket went from 2.9% to 
4.2%, and the topmost bracket (above $100,000) doubled, from 1.6% to 3.2%. 
</P>
<P>
This upward shift in all household income brackets during Ronald Reagan's 
presidency accounts for his popularity. Although in constant 1988 dollars only 
20% of households had incomes above $29,070 in 1980, by 1988, 38% of all 
households earned more than $35,000. This is phenomenal economic progress. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, this epic upward mobility helps to explain why the tax burden also 
shifted upward during Reagan's years. Although figures for 1988 are not yet 
available, in 1979, the top 10% (in adjusted gross income, more than $32,710 in 
constant 1987 dollars) paid 49.5% of all U.S. personal income taxes. But by 
1987, those in the top 10% ($54,700 or above) were paying 55.4% of all income 
taxes, and the top 1% paid nearly one-fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Left-wing critics sometimes retort: "Of course the rich were paying more taxes 
-- they were earning more!" But this retort plays right into the hands of the 
supply-siders. Their prediction was: "Greater incentives yield higher 
revenues." If you want higher tax revenues from the rich, you should lower tax 
rates. And if you want lower revenues, raise rates. It breaks the hearts of the 
left but, alas, only as the rich earn do their income taxes pour in. 
</P>
<P>
So let's cut the hypocrisy. Most of those who regularly bash the rich -- 
including politicians and TV journalists -- are in at least the top 20% (or 
much higher) themselves. And if they want to give even more of their money to 
the government, they can volunteer. "Put up or shut up" is sound advice they 
should heed.

<P>
WILTED CARROT, OR STICK WITH TEETH?; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS MAY HALVE MILITARY AID TO PROD NEGOTIATIONS. ACCEPTANCE OF A U.N. 
SETTLEMENT WOULD BE BETTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH E. SHARPE, Kenneth E. Sharpe is a professor of political science at 
Swarthmore College and co-author of Confronting Revolution: Security Through 
Diplomacy in Central America (Pantheon Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate is about to vote on whether to join the House in cutting military 
aid to El Salvador by 50%. Congressional liberals, with the support of many 
moderates, see such a cut as a message to the Salvadoran military: Stop the 
repression and begin negotiating a solution to the war with the leftist 
guerrillas. Sadly, the message is unlikely to be heard and it could backfire, 
embarrassing its congressional proponents. Only if the Bush Administration also 
gets Congress' message might things be different. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodd-Leahy amendment to the foreign appropriations bill is a compromise 
between those who want to cut all aid and those who fear that cuts will aid the 
guerrillas. It calls for $42.5 million in military aid, about 50% of last 
year's level, but provides for sending another $42.5 million if the guerrillas 
won't negotiate, or if they receive significant foreign arms shipments, or, 
most important, if they mount an offensive that threatens the government. 
</P>
<P>
These well-intentioned cuts are perhaps the best that can be done politically, 
but the measure is based on two fundamentally flawed premises about the 
military and the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
First, it assumes that the aid cut will persuade the military to reform -- stop 
the blatant murdering, disappearing, torturing and arresting of the unarmed 
opposition; bring to justice military criminals, starting with the authors of 
the Jesuit killings; restructure itself with an officer corps respectful of 
human rights, loyal to any elected government and obedient to the law and the 
courts, and negotiate seriously with the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
But the military has proved itself resistant to American calls for reform. In 
early 1989, for example, Vice President Dan Quayle told the military that 
continued U.S. aid was dependent on the prosecution of soldiers and officers 
involved in the massacre of 10 peasants in San Sebastian. This was a line drawn 
in the sand, and the military crossed it with impunity, as it has crossed 
others in the past decade: Nine men were arrested -- and eight were then 
released. In late September, Quayle again expressed concern to President 
Alfredo Cristiani, but no serious consequences have followed from the defiance 
of U.S. wishes. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, the Bush Administration opposed the aid cutback in Congress, sending the 
Salvadorans an entirely different message. 
</P>
<P>
The second assumption in the aid-cutback strategy is that the guerrillas will 
temper their offensive actions and make concessions at the bargaining table to 
avoid triggering the release of the other $42.5 million. But the guerrillas can 
read the Administration's waffling as well as the military can, and they know 
that $100 million in U.S. military aid is still in the pipeline. They want to 
see significant progress on reforming the military before they will agree to a 
cease-fire. After all, they argue, if the military will kill priests in cold 
blood and defy prosecution, what can guerrilla fighters expect if they lay down 
their arms? 
</P>
<P>
Given the military's intransigence to date, it would seem rational to the 
guerrillas to go ahead with an offensive to try to force the army's hand at the 
negotiating table. Conservatives will pay no political cost for the military's 
intransigence, but if the guerrillas mount a major offensive, the liberals in 
Washington will take the heat for having "encouraged" it and "trusted" the 
guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
If there is one slim hope for this bill, it is in the possibility that the 
Administration will accept Congress' advice to change the direction of U.S. 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
If the Administration faced reality, it would see that the only way to 
forestall further bloodletting and negotiate a solution in El Salvador is for 
the State Department to put its full weight behind negotiations mandated by the 
United Nations -- and to do so with other regional powers. A solution must be 
crafted that makes it rational for the guerrillas and the unarmed opposition to 
participate in nonviolent politics -- and it must protect the lives of their 
conservative opponents as well. That means a U.N.-monitored demilitarization on 
both sides and institutional guarantees of security and law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Now that we no longer have to fear a Soviet beachhead in the region (if we ever 
did), there is no vital security interest that prevents the Administration from 
making an ultimatum to the generals: If you don't shape up, you're on your own.

A COUNTRY DIMINISHED IN POSSIBILITY; 
</P>
<P>
THERE IS ROT. BUT OUR PROBLEMS ARISE FROM HUMAN FOLLY AND CAN BE RESOLVED BY 
HUMAN EFFORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard N. Goodwin, Richard N. Goodwin served in the Kennedy and Johnson 
administrations. He writes from Concord, Mass.

<TEXT>
<P>
There once was a country called America -- imperfect, scarred by spasmodic 
violence and large injustice -- but constituted by a common purpose, a belief 
in ever-enlarging opportunity for a free people. 
</P>
<P>
That nation is rapidly disappearing. It is being destroyed, not only by its 
public leadership, but by all those able to influence the course of events; 
even by those who could have acted or spoken out, but chose to remain silent. 
</P>
<P>
We must all share responsibility for the incredible waste and extravagance, the 
rampant greed and disregard for long-term consequences, that have characterized 
all of our public life and much of our private life over the past two decades. 
We have danced with the piper, and now the piper must be paid. 
</P>
<P>
If a house deteriorates it can usually be restored with fresh paint or a 
modicum of carpentry. But if the foundation goes there is nothing on which to 
rebuild. And the American foundation is being eroded, and with it the illusion 
that distress is merely cyclical, a belief we cling to despite the irrefutable 
evidence of history that permanent decline has been a constant feature in the 
story of nations and empires. 
</P>
<P>
And the rot at the foundation is visible and spreading. We continue to 
accumulate an already unmanageable debt; our industries have become less 
productive and competitive. Finance -- the source of future investment -- is in 
disarray. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40 million citizens are now below the so-called poverty level. They 
have been are virtually eliminated from the base of mass demand and savings on 
which our economy depends. Our educational structure is failing to prepare 
citizens to play a productive role in the life of the country. 
</P>
<P>
The approaching revolution in American politics is fueled by a growing 
awareness that the political structure has contributed to the accelerating 
cycle of waste and decline. For a decade Democrats and Republicans alike have 
sown the seeds of disaster. Indeed, we no longer have a two-party system. There 
is only one party: the Washington Party. And it has been thoroughly corrupted 
by private wealth, seeking, immediate profit at the expense of long-term 
investment in America's future. 
</P>
<P>
Many, perhaps most citizens, know this to be true. What we call disillusionment 
or voter apathy is a direct consequence of this awareness. Many people believe 
that who wins a particular election, whether for mayor or president, makes 
little difference to their lives or their hopes for the future. And they are 
right: It has made little difference. However, people are not indifferent to 
personal distress, fear about future prospects, or their own loss of connection 
with the American community. Indeed, they are angry, bitter and confused. They 
are, therefore, ripe for demagogues -- for men willing to assault adversaries, 
real or illusory, and offer assurance that they possess answers. 
</P>
<P>
What was once called the left -- the progressive, populist sector of American 
political life -- is virtually non-existent. Unless there is a revival, the 
emergence of a public movement that puts traditional values of equal 
opportunity at the top of its agenda, that is willing to rebuild our economic 
foundation, then the future belongs to the harbingers of a permanent class 
society and increasing public oppression. 
</P>
<P>
In little more than a decade we have betrayed the hope of centuries -- the 
promise that freedom would companion ever-enlarging opportunity for all. This 
was a promise, an idea, a purpose, a dream that once fired the imagination of 
the globe. It is being sacrificed, not merely to blind exploitation of the 
present at the expense of our future, but to a failure of imagination, of 
empathy, an erosion of the binding impulse of the human heart to consider each 
individual life worthy only if it contributes to the lives of our fellow 
citizens, those now among us and those yet to be born. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that we may be the first generation of Americans to bequeath the 
future -- our children and their descent -- a country diminished in 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
But our problems were not divinely ordained. They are the creation of human 
folly; and they can be resolved by human effort. That effort will will require 
us to accept a sacrifice in our living standards while we divert our resources 
-- money and vitality -- to building a nation capable of enriching the life of 
our future, a country able to bind to itself the mounting numbers of 
impoverished outcasts. 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish this will require specific, tangible measures. But they are not 
beyond our capacity, only beyond our will. We have the resources and we have 
the people -- the same kind of people -- ready to respond and to act if we are 
fortunate enough to find leadership intelligent and courageous enough to point 
the way.

LEGAL VIEW: USEFUL LAWBOOK FOR EVERYDAY LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN and LOUIS M. BROWN, Klein, an attorney and assistant to the 
publisher of The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The old expression, "a little knowledge is a dangerous thing" tells only part 
of the story. No knowledge at all can be even more dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to legal information, even a little knowledge can go a long way, 
especially if you know how to use it. And that means more than trying to 
impress your friends during cocktail party chatter. 
</P>
<P>
Understanding the law can help you deal with many everyday situations and 
challenges, from buying insurance to buying a car. It is even useful when you 
are already represented by a lawyer. The more you know, the better client you 
can be. 
</P>
<P>
"You and the Law," a new, large-format (8 1/2x11), 608-page book published by 
the American Bar Assn., and written by more than 15 experts, is a good way to 
learn the law. Of course, no single book, even one as large as this one, can 
tell everything consumers need to know. 
</P>
<P>
One key element is to know when and how to use a lawyer, and this book has an 
entire chapter devoted to that subject. Of course, "you do not need a lawyer 
every time you become involved with the law," as the authors note early on, 
while explaining how to get help from sources other than lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
When people think of the law, they usually think about the court system, which 
is explained in some detail in one chapter, but much of the law exists outside 
the court system. 
</P>
<P>
The law enters into nearly all aspects of daily living. It is there in some way 
every time you write a check, sign a document, move into a new house or 
apartment, start a new job or business, or use a credit card -- even when you 
get married. 
</P>
<P>
The legal system touches much more than criminal and civil trials. Courts are 
necessary to resolve significant civil disputes that cannot be resolved by some 
other means such as settlement, arbitration or mediation. Questions come up 
every day that require legal information to answer, but will never wind up in 
the courts. 
</P>
<P>
And the question-answer format of this thick resource helps you quickly find 
the information you need. 
</P>
<P>
"Read before you sign" warns one page that summarizes typical language in a 
lease. What makes this analysis different from similar warnings in other 
self-help books is that it contains a detailed explanation of typical clauses 
in a lease and then describes what the provision would say in a "pro-landlord 
lease" and what it should say in a "balanced lease." Those tips will help 
readers understand and negotiate their own leases. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the laws that govern our lives are state statutes and court decisions 
that are not the same everywhere. That's one of the pitfalls of writing a 
consumer law text that promises "instant help for hundreds of common legal 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
The authors help solve that problem by providing charts with specific 
information on a state by state basis, showing differences in such areas as 
spousal property ownership rules, child restraint laws and accident report 
filing requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Each chapter concludes with a section telling the reader where to find more 
information, including free or inexpensive publications, government agencies or 
other groups. There is a useful glossary and index. 
</P>
<P>
You can buy this book from a bookstore or send a check for $19.95 plus $3.95 
for shipping and handling to American Bar Assn., Order Fulfillment/PC235-0019, 
750 N. Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, Ill. 60611.

LUSH VIGNETTES TREAD IN INDIAN TERRITORY; 
</P>
<P>
THE SNAKE GAME BY WAYNE JOHNSON; ALFRED A. KNOPF $18.95, 262 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, TIMES BOOK CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne Johnson has set his book in the woods and lakes of northern Minnesota, 
where Ojibway and Chippewa Indians struggle to retain their existence and 
identity in a world darkened by the world of the whites. 
</P>
<P>
The 19 stories in "The Snake Game" are a portrait of violent encroachment. It 
is as if the passenger pigeon were telling us the history of its own 
extinction. 
</P>
<P>
The stories, most of them brief, harsh vignettes, touch upon two families over 
the course of 30 years from the 1950s to the 1980s. One, an extended kinship 
group, centers around Osada, an old Ojibway craftsman and follower of the old 
ways. It includes Red Deer, his son; Martha, his wife, and Joe, father of two 
other children by Martha: Bear and Eli. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to these blurred and shifting relationships -- which conceal an 
abiding, organic loyalty -- is the tight, white family of Dr. Neal Sorensen; 
Mary, his wife, and their son Martin. The tightness is an opposite illusion; 
the coarsely macho father, his pinched wife and the sensitive and rebellious 
son are cold galaxies apart. 
</P>
<P>
The vignettes, lush and bitten-off at the same time, and stylistically in 
considerable debt to Upper Michigan Hemingway, select incidents in the lives of 
the families that make the author's points about the beleaguering of the 
Indians and the arrogant domination of the whites. The Indians are portrayed 
with a full sense of their mystery, their values, and the loss that their loss 
represents. The whites are written with as much nuance as a weather report 
about a killer drought. 
</P>
<P>
The first story tells of the deadly encounter that scattered the Osada clan. 
The state had ordered the Ojibway children into school, thus restricting their 
families' freely wandering life. The children do badly; the authorities 
threaten to take them away. Osada, Joe and friends go to take them home; there 
is a confrontation that turns violent, and one of Joe's brothers is killed. 
</P>
<P>
Osada leaves his family and goes north to live in a lake cabin and work 
occasionally as a guide to a fishing camp. Red Deer, Bear and Eli will 
eventually join him and find work there. Many of the stories are set in and 
around the lake, and shift back and forth between the Indians and the white 
families who go up for fishing holidays. 
</P>
<P>
The Sorensens are one of the families. From the beginning, Martin, regarded by 
his father and his father's friends as something of a sissy, is drawn to the 
Indians. He will, as time goes by, become the author's voice. Several of the 
stories, in fact, tell of his acts of rebellion against the values of his 
father and friends, and of solidarity with those of the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
As a boy on a picnic run by one of the fathers of the white families at the 
lake, Martin sneaks hot dogs to Bear, who is a year or two older. Years later, 
he gets a job as a camp guide, submits to a harsh initiation by Bear, his boss, 
and gradually gains his acceptance. When the camp owner dumps a load of trash 
in the marsh near Osada's cabin, provoking the old Indian to fury -- it is one 
more encroachment -- Martin douses the marsh with gasoline and sets it on fire. 
</P>
<P>
He becomes a trusted friend of Bear and Eli. After the Vietnam War -- Martin 
flees to Canada in another protest against the conservative values of his 
community -- he comes back to the lake to find that Bear has been killed. 
Ostensibly, it was in a hunting accident; in fact, the "accident" was arranged 
by one of the whites who had held a long-standing resentment of Bear's uppity 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the best of the stories, Martin wins back Eli's trust. After his 
brother's death, Eli has chosen to judge all whites the same. The two walk to a 
promontory 70 feet above the lake. Eli jeers that Martin is afraid to go near 
the edge. In a foolhardy gesture of anger and heroics -- a legendary, nonwhite 
gesture -- Martin grasps Eli by the waist and hurls them both off the edge. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson tends to use melodramatic and occasionally sentimental touches. His 
plotting can be excessively contrived to bring out the nature of the Indians' 
pain and the white man's oppressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Martin's leap, though, is authentic drama. Here, and in some of the stronger 
stories, the author matches an extraordinary lost gesture with the 
extraordinary lost reality of the Indians. Martin cannot save his Indian friend 
or his friend's two brothers -- one killed, one in an aimless depression. But 
he can embrace him and fall with him. 
</P>
<P>
It is despairing, but it makes its point. Johnson's whites are object lessons 
in shortsighted arrogance. Our lakes are filling up with trash. We may not 
entirely believe all the maneuverings of these stories, but we do believe in 
the Indians, and in what we are all losing with their loss. 
</P>

INTO THE NIGHT: WINDY CITY CROWD BLEW IN TO PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: The fourth annual Windy City West party Monday at Ed Debevic's for 
expatriate Chicagoans connected to the entertainment industry. One guest 
mentioned that if Al Capone were alive today, he'd probably be an entertainment 
agent in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: More than 600 guests, including NBC Entertainment Group Chairman 
Brandon Tartikoff, Dick Butkus, Marsha Warfield, Arte Johnson, Fred Silverman, 
Betty Thomas, Tom Dreesen, Steve Edwards, Shelley Berman, Mary Frann, Dennis 
Farina and Carl Ballantine. Being born in Chicago wasn't an absolute 
requirement, but some connection -- more than just a lay-over at O'Hare -- was 
needed. (Tartikoff, for example, worked at WLS television in Chicago for four 
years.) 
</P>
<P>
Honored: The Windy City West Award went to William and Lee Bell, who are "gods 
in the soap opera world," according to one organizer. They write and produce 
"The Bold and the Beautiful" and "The Young and the Restless," both on CBS. The 
award was presented by Tartikoff -- winner of the first Windy City West Award 
-- who said: "Here I am giving an award to two people who are kicking my butt 
in daytime programming. Next thing you know, I'll be giving awards to Bart 
Simpson." 
</P>
<P>
Money Matters: Tickets were $25 and had to be purchased in advance. "Typical 
Chicago," said the doorman. "People were trying to bribe me to get in." 
</P>
<P>
Chow: The essence of the party was a mega-cholesterol menu flown in from 
Chicago: Mr. Beef sandwiches, Eli's cheese cake, Chicago Fish House smelts, Don 
Carson's barbecue ribs and Fluky's hot dogs. "You can't get a real hot dog fix 
any place but Chicago," said Shelley Berman. "Any place else, they're fake. 
It's like being on hot dog methadone." 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: "Hey, Chicago's a cold place, you need food like this," said Marsha 
Warfield. "You'd have a hard time surviving without some fat. You need the 
padding. There's only so much a winter coat can do." 
</P>
<P>
Pastimes: Revitalizing intense anguish over the Cubs' loss of a playoff berth 
to the Mets in 1969. The South reconciled itself to losing the Civil War in 
less time than it will take Chicago to accept being defeated by New York. 
</P>
<P>
Cub Fan Certification Question: Who was the peanut vendor in right field? 
Answer: Irving. "He was the guy with only one tooth," explained one fan. 
</P>
<P>
Key to Being a Chicagoan: "Chicago people are hangout people," said comedian 
Tom Dreesen. "You gotta be able to hang out, and the key to hanging out is 
being able to tell funny stories. And be able to listen to the same stories 500 
times. And still laugh." 
</P>

together at Monday night's party. MIKE MEADOWS / Los Angeles Times; Photo, 
Comedian Shelley Berman, left in photo at left, and Brandon Tartikoff, NBC

Tartikoff received the first Windy City West award and presented this year's 
award to soap opera wizards William and Lee Bell.

WHEN GRANDMA DISCOVERED HOT DOGS, AND OTHER TALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNDA BARRY, Lynda Barry is a columnist and the creator of the syndicated 
cartoon Ernie Pook's Comeek. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My grandmother, a brilliant cook, came to live with us from the Philippines 
when I was in the third grade. It was a happy event for all concerned, but 
especially for my brothers and me, because she had an exuberant disposition, 
spoke an unusual brand of English, preferred walking around barefoot and 
possessed the nearly supernatural ability to smoke a cigarette with the lighted 
end in her mouth. Plus she loved television and cooked with a passion. 
</P>
<P>
For the first year or so of her stay, I became accustomed to the Third World 
sights and smells she brought to our kitchen. Heavenly smells that carried me 
undulating nose-first to the table like a cartoon character floating on an 
irresistible aroma. Or hellish smells that instantly transformed my legs into 
buzz saws to carry me fast and away over distant hills in the opposite 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
I slowly grew used to setting the chocolate milk carton next to the whole 
octopus sitting moodily on a green plate in our icebox, and turning away while 
my grandmother shouted her suggestions for contestants on "Let's Make A Deal" 
while eating balut, a salted, nearly hatched duck egg that looked like it could 
be used in a "special effects" display at a science fiction convention. 
</P>
<P>
Except for these and a few other rather "far-out" dishes (one called "Black 
Out" or, alternately, "Midnight Meat," for example) I loved her cooking. I 
learned to want her chicken adobo more than I wanted any other meal on this 
planet. It's cut-up chicken, boiled in white vinegar and soy sauce with garlic, 
peppercorns and onions, and then left to sit in a dented pot at room 
temperature for three days. And no, it does not spoil. My grandmother grew up 
without the benefit of refrigeration and knowledgeably put food in situations 
that would cause psychological convulsions in even the most open-minded of 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner each night was a joy. Our kitchen was transformed into a cross-cultural 
Norman Rockwell painting (if Norman Rockwell could paint a plate of pansit 
being served by a 4-foot 8-inch Filipino woman with one eye on the TV and a 
cigarette hanging out of her mouth) and remained so until the day my 
grandmother entered into what can only be described as her "hot dog period." 
</P>
<P>
For various reasons, money began to get tight. My family had to cut corners 
wherever they could. My grandmother's solution to the problem was the hot dog. 
</P>
<P>
She adored the hot dog. She loved the economy of it, its easy shape and its 
adaptability. And even after we were over the hump of our financial troubles, 
her involvement with it continued. Perhaps it was destiny. The story goes that 
"hot dog" was the first thing she learned to say in English after "Hello Joe!" 
To my grandmother, the existence of the hot dog was ample proof of a loving 
God. 
</P>
<P>
She bought them in bulk and used them to transform previously mouth-watering 
examples of Filipino cuisine into, well, something "different." And when she 
was feeling especially adventurous, she worked from recipes from my mother's 
red-checked Betty Crocker cookbook, replacing actual meat with sliced hot dogs 
whenever possible. As in: spaghetti and hot dogs. Hot dog stew. And the 
unforgettable hot dog cacciatore. 
</P>
<P>
My grandmother was unfamiliar with and uninterested in the traditional way of 
serving the hot dog. To see one in a bun at my house was a rare sight. To see 
roundels of them peeking out from a hillock of fried eggs and left-over rice at 
breakfast was a vision I looked upon nearly every morning for the duration of 
this particularly tragic culinary epoch. 
</P>
<P>
I grew tired of the hot dog. 
</P>
<P>
When I opened the refrigerator and saw the stacked orderly armies of them lying 
in wait, I grew melancholy. I soon developed a reputation as "a picky eater." 
</P>
<P>
There were reprieves. On nights when my grandmother had bingo duty, my father 
led rescue missions to the Dag's Beefy Boy drive-in, or my mother took the 
Harvest Gold electric frying pan out of its original box and made the 
unimaginably delicious scalloped potatoes with sliced ham and Campbell's 
mushroom soup. But inevitably, the hot dog would return to our table, however 
disguised, and we would know it and feel sad. 
</P>
<P>
We lived under this cloud for many moons, and then just as mysteriously as it 
descended upon her, my grandmother's hot dog period lifted. Glory to God in the 
most high! The days of adobo returned! Plus Grandma, apparently challenged by 
Col. Sanders' boasts about his "secret recipe," began experimenting around and 
came up with a way to fry chicken that made you do anything to get it. I mean 
literally. 
</P>
<P>
Picture this. I'm 34 years old and I am sitting in my grandmother's kitchen. In 
honor of my visit she has set in front of me heaping platters of both adobo and 
fried chicken, a giant bowl of steaming white rice, a bottle of soy sauce and a 
bottle of green chiles, and she has just handed me a cold can of Coke. Now she 
is lighting a cigarette and asking me once again to please sing her favorite 
song of all time, "It's a Small World After All." How bad do I want that 
chicken? 
</P>
<P>
I sing it. I sing it even though it is a song that has given me prolonged 
nightmares ever since I first endured the horrors of the ride itself at 
Disneyland. I sing it because she is my grandmother, she has requested it, and 
I am at her table. But I also sing because I worship and adore her, because she 
has made my life incredibly rich, and in light of all I've just told you, the 
words suddenly seem overwhelmingly beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SPAGHETTI AND HOT 
</P>
<P>
DOGS 
</P>
<P>
1 package cheapest spaghetti 
</P>
<P>
1 large bottle cheapest catsup 
</P>
<P>
1 package cheapest hot dogs 
</P>
<P>
Boil spaghetti until it is nearly paste. Drain. 
</P>
<P>
Slice hot dogs into roundlets 1/2-inch thick. Fry for the length of one 
commercial. Do not drain. 
</P>
<P>
Combine hot dogs and spaghetti in saucepan and empty contents of catsup bottle 
over top. Light a Camel straight and smoke it while stirring mixture over 
medium heat. 
</P>
<P>
Serve in vaguely iridescent tan bowls given to you after each fill-up at the 
gas station at the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Adobo's flavor will deepen as the days pass. Stir the mixture twice daily. The 
dish is best when served on day three, with white rice and Coke or cheap beer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHICKEN ADOBO 
</P>
<P>
1 whole chicken, cut-up 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup white vinegar 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
1 large white onion, sliced 
</P>
<P>
5 bay leaves 
</P>
<P>
2 to 3 tablespoons black peppercorns 
</P>
<P>
5 to 6 cloves garlic, crushed 
</P>
<P>
Combine chicken, vinegar, lemon juice, soy sauce, onion, bay leaves, 
peppercorns and garlic in covered, non-aluminum saucepan. Bring to boil over 
medium high heat, stirring gently. Reduce heat and simmer until chicken is 
tender, about 50 minutes. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Test Kitchen Note: Saltiness of this dish is cut down when served with rice; if 
desired, reduce amount of soy sauce to 1/2 cup. For thicker sauce, remove 
chicken after it is tender, then reduce sauce by gently boiling, uncovered, 
until desired consistency is reached. Return chicken to sauce just to reheat.

THE SPOILED COOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
My mother's idea of a great meal was one that could be cooked in 10 minutes. 
She'd come breezing into the apartment, throw her hat onto the kitchen table 
and the cast-iron skillet onto the stove. Then she'd dump a can of peas into a 
pot, salt the skillet, take the lamb chops out of the refrigerator and the 
Minute Rice down from the shelf. The meat would hiss as it hit the hot salt, 
sizzle as she set the table. As she called out "dinner" she'd glance at the 
clock and peel off her gloves. "Eight minutes," she'd say with satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
The books piled on top of the refrigerator -- where the cookbooks should have 
been -- all had titles like "I Hate to Cook," and "No Fuss Food." My mother 
felt that she had better things to do with her life than spend it in the 
kitchen. My father, apparently, agreed. "Your mother," he'd say solemnly and 
often, "is a marvelous cook." 
</P>
<P>
I think he really believed it. Fortunately for him, he was blessed with an iron 
constitution. In our family you needed it to survive. My mother certainly 
thought she had better things to do than clean out the refrigerator. And she 
definitely didn't believe in the concept of spoilage. "Just a little bit of 
mold . . . " she'd say, scraping it off. 
</P>
<P>
My mother was equally blase about what went into the pot. I once watched her 
construct a casserole for dinner. It began with leftover turkey and broccoli. 
She found some ancient stewed prunes and plopped them in. Then she unearthed a 
little leftover rice. "This might be interesting," she mused, adding some 
cottage cheese she found floating on one of the lower shelves. By now she was 
happily dumping everything that was in the refrigerator into the casserole. 
"Mom," I said finally, stopping her, "you just threw in half an apple pie!" She 
looked disconcerted. "I did?" she asked. Then she shrugged. "Who knows," she 
said, "it might be good." 
</P>
<P>
I don't think it was -- to anybody but my father. But then I can only remember 
one time when my mother made something that even my father could not swallow. 
</P>
<P>
It was early one Saturday morning. Early for Dad and me -- late for my mother 
who, at 7, had already been up for at least three hours and greeted us with 
disgustingly cheerful smiles. All either of us ever wanted to do in the morning 
was to be left alone. In our house, that was impossible. "I need you to taste 
something," said my mother to my father. He followed her, groggily, into the 
kitchen. She held out a spoon. He obediently opened his mouth. But as he closed 
it, a look of absolute horror spread across his face. He stumbled to the sink 
and spat it out. "That," he said, gasping, "is the worst thing I've ever 
tasted." 
</P>
<P>
"Um hum," said my mother, "just as I thought. Spoiled." 
</P>
<P>
My mother might have been bored by everyday cooking, but parties were 
different. She entertained eagerly, often -- and eccentrically. Her main 
objective was to be creative, to feed her friends something they had never had 
before. For my mother, this was no problem; she was the first on her block to 
serve mussels, to serve wild rice, to serve kiwis. While ordinary cooks were 
concerned when people looked up from their plates and said, "This is so, er, 
unusual," my mother took it as a compliment. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, however, she accidentally hit on something really good. Like her 
baked corned beef. It was so good that when I was in college, I actually wrote 
and asked her for the recipe. "Your friends will love it," she wrote back, 
"it's so different." 
</P>
<P>
MIRIAM REICHL'S BAKED CORNED BEEF 
</P>
<P>
1 (3- to 4-pound) corned beef 
</P>
<P>
Few bay leaves 
</P>
<P>
1 onion, chopped, or 1 tablespoon onion flakes 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
Whole cloves 
</P>
<P>
1 (1-pound 15-ounce) can spiced peaches 
</P>
<P>
Place corned beef in pot. Cover with water. Add bay leaves and onion. Cook 
until meat is very tender, about 3 to 4 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Remove meat from water. Skin off all fat. Make paste of mustard and brown sugar 
and cover meat with paste. Insert whole cloves as desired. 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 325 degrees 1 hour, basting frequently with some syrup from spiced 
peaches. Serve with drained spiced peaches. Makes 6 servings.

WHEN IOWA CAME TO CALIFORNIA

<TEXT>
<P>
My mother was born in Dubuque, Iowa, and she never lost her taste for 
Iowa-style roast pork, corn on the cob and apple pie. Cooking was her great 
love, and her trusted guide was "Fannie," meaning Fannie Merritt Farmer, the 
author of the original "Boston Cooking School Cook Book." However, Mother never 
followed a recipe as written, not even "Fannie's," because she insisted on 
adding her own touch. There was no recipe that she couldn't improve and nothing 
that she couldn't cook, if she set her mind to it. 
</P>
<P>
When she moved to Los Angeles long before I was born, she continued to enjoy 
roast pork and corn on the cob, but she also responded to the new influences 
around her. She quickly became expert at Mexican food, copying the green corn 
tamales at El Cholo and duplicating the dishes that she enjoyed at a 
neighborhood Mexican restaurant. She made wonderful egg foo young, sukiyaki, 
Japanese cucumber salad, gazpacho, Norwegian lefse, Danish aebleskiver, 
baklava, German Christmas cookies and anything else that appealed to her, often 
simply copying what she had tasted. Dinner was always a feast, and the 
conversation frequently centered around the great finds she had made at the 
market that day. 
</P>
<P>
When I began to write cookbooks, she was of immeasurable inspiration. And I was 
pleased to tell her that my manuscript for a book on bread had been accepted. 
It was she who taught me to bake, making easy what could have been an 
intimidating pursuit. Unfortunately she passed away before she could see the 
book, but her recipes live on in its pages, among them this sumptuous coffee 
cake. 
</P>
<P>
ANNE HANSEN'S DANISH ALMOND COFFEE CAKE 
</P>
<P>
4 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
3/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1 cup butter, softened 
</P>
<P>
1 envelope dry yeast 
</P>
<P>
Granulated sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup warm water 
</P>
<P>
3 eggs 
</P>
<P>
1 cup sour cream 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons vanilla 
</P>
<P>
4 ounces almond paste 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons water, about 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup sliced almonds, lightly toasted 
</P>
<P>
Sift flour and salt together into large bowl. Add butter and rub into flour 
with fingers until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir yeast and dash 
granulated sugar into 1/4 cup warm water and let stand until yeast is 
dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
Combine 1 whole egg and 2 yolks in medium bowl. Place remaining 2 whites in 
small bowl, cover and refrigerate. Beat eggs until combined. Beat in sour cream 
and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Add dissolved yeast and beat until blended. Add to 
flour mixture and stir until thoroughly combined. Cover and chill thoroughly 
overnight, or at least 2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
When ready to complete coffee cakes, mash almond paste with enough of reserved 
egg whites to make soft mixture of spreading consistency. Beat until smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Measure 2/3 cup granulated sugar. Sprinkle some sugar over work surface. Divide 
chilled dough in half, returning one half to refrigerator. Place dough on sugar 
and pat to fairly smooth round. (Dough will be very soft and sticky.) Sprinkle 
dough lightly with more sugar and roll out to rectangle, rolling one way in 
each direction, not back and forth. Sprinkle any parts of dough that stick to 
rolling pin with sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Fold short edges of rectangle to meet at center. Do not overlap. Pat dough with 
hands into even rectangle. Sprinkle with sugar and roll out again to rectangle. 
Repeat this procedure third time. Fold short edges to center once more and 
sprinkle with sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Roll dough out to 14x10-inch rectangle. (Make as even as possible.) Spread 
entire surface with half almond paste mixture. Roll up like jellyroll, starting 
at one long edge. Place seam side down on large ungreased baking sheet. Repeat 
with remaining half of dough and place on baking sheet well separated from 
other roll. 
</P>
<P>
Let coffee cakes stand in warm place, away from drafts, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. (They 
do not need to double in bulk.) Bake at 375 degrees about 25 minutes, or until 
light brown. Cover loosely with foil if cakes start to brown too much. Remove 
from oven and immediately slide spatula under each to loosen. Let cool on 
baking sheet, loosening again if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
To make frosting, blend powdered sugar with about 2 tablespoons water (use 
enough to make spreading consistency). Add remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla and 
beat until smooth. Spread frosting over warm coffee cakes (frosting will not 
cover cakes completely). Sprinkle with sliced almonds. Makes 2 coffee cakes.

HOW WE SURVIVED THE EGGPLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
During World War II, my mother planted a Victory Garden in the back yard and 
found, as all California gardeners do, that eggplant and zucchini grow like mad 
in our climate. In fact, you can't kill them with a stick -- for years after 
the war those two, and the Swiss chard, reseeded themselves all over the place. 
</P>
<P>
A native Southern Californian and unquestioning believer in vegetables, she 
dutifully served us eggplant when it was in season. Unfortunately, the only way 
she knew to cook it was frying, and she was not aware that eggplant has to be 
salted first to remove the bitterness. It pained her affectionate and 
vegetable-trusting heart to see we didn't like the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
But there were all those eggplants! Something had to be done with them. I can 
remember my father drop-kicking a spare one over the back fence while we 
cheered. 
</P>
<P>
Finally she came upon a recipe for a Provencal dish where eggplant was stewed 
with other vegetables, and magically, you couldn't taste the bitterness. (And 
hey, it was also a way to use up some of those millions of zucchini at the same 
time!) We went for it, and she served us ratatouille all summer long from then 
on. 
</P>
<P>
MARY PERRY'S RATATOUILLE 
</P>
<P>
1 medium eggplant, about 1 1/2 pounds 
</P>
<P>
1 small zucchini, about 1/2 pound 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup oil 
</P>
<P>
1 medium onion, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 large green or red pepper, sliced 
</P>
<P>
4 medium tomatoes, quartered 
</P>
<P>
2 cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons salt 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon black pepper 
</P>
<P>
1 heaping teaspoon coriander seeds 
</P>
<P>
1 lemon, quartered, optional 
</P>
<P>
Wash eggplant and cut into 1-inch cubes. Wash zucchini, trim off ends and cut 
in 1/2-inch slices. 
</P>
<P>
Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat. Saute onion until tender. Add 
eggplant, zucchini, green pepper, tomatoes, garlic, salt, pepper and coriander 
seeds. Cook 5 minutes, stirring frequently. 
</P>
<P>
Cover and cook 10 minutes longer, or until vegetables are tender. Serve hot or 
cold (squeeze lemon over if served cold). Makes 4 servings.

Although my mother's cooking never won any blue ribbons at the fair, we had no 
problem cleaning our plates. Since money was always tight, my mom cooked a 
whole repertoire of casseroles -- they all seemed to contain at least one can 
of cream of mushroom soup -- and usually some Chung King chow mein noodles. 
</P>
<P>
On the days when my dad was on the afternoon shift and wouldn't be home for 
supper, my mother would often make rice pudding, and we'd make a meal of it. We 
all loved it, and it was cheap. If there was any left over, we'd have it the 
next day cold, for breakfast. My mom's rice pudding, hot or cold, is still one 
of my favorite meals. 
</P>
<P>
ARDELL KOCHEVAR'S RICE PUDDING 
</P>
<P>
1 cup rice, washed 
</P>
<P>
Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
4 cups milk 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 cup raisins 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup butter 
</P>
<P>
Ground cinnamon, optional 
</P>
<P>
Place rice in saucepan and add water to just barely cover it. Add salt. Cook, 
covered, until water is gone, about 5 minutes. Add milk and cook, covered, over 
low heat about 1 hour, stirring occasionally. During last 10 minutes of 
cooking, stir in sugar and raisins. 
</P>
<P>
When done, remove from heat, add butter and stir until melted. Divide into 6 
serving dishes. Sprinkle with cinnamon, if desired. Serve with milk or cream on 
top. Makes 6 servings.

THE CACTUS MANIFESTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"You know the saying, 'A woman's place is in the home'? That's the way we were 
raised." My grandmother works her fist into a mass of tortilla dough. "We never 
had ambitions to go out and work. It wasn't like now -- the school, the career, 
you know, everybody wants to be something. The whole idea was to grow up, get 
married, have a home, have children and raise them. Taking care of the house 
and the kids, and cooking -- that was just part of being a woman." 
</P>
<P>
These days, my grandmother makes tortillas only when someone -- her daughter, a 
granddaughter -- begs. At 71, she works two jobs, and recently moved out of her 
sprawling four-bedroom home into a compact one-bedroom apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not cooking the way I used to," she says. "It's hard to work in this 
kitchen, it's so small. And do you know I don't have any oregano? I guess I 
haven't needed it for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Periodically, she gives me a tortilla-making hint. "If the dough seems too 
dry," she says, "put a little oil in your hand then knead it in." Finally, she 
is satisfied with the dough's texture. 
</P>
<P>
"Now you let the dough relax," she says. "Sometimes I don't. But you really 
should. When you're first starting out, you need all the help you can get." 
</P>
<P>
She puts the dough in a bowl on top of the microwave, and turns to the nopales. 
</P>
<P>
When my mother and I had arrived the nopales were already simmering in a double 
boiler. "I thought you'd be hungry," my grandmother explained. 
</P>
<P>
But, like a well-prepared TV chef, she's set a few demonstration cactus leaves 
aside, on a cutting board she's balanced on an open kitchen drawer. 
</P>
<P>
"First you need to buy the most tender nopales available," she says. "The 
fresher ones have a bright green color, like this." She gestures at a leaf. 
"When nopales get older they have a dark green color and the skin looks drier." 
As she says this, her face scrunches in mild disgust. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, you take the nopales with a fork . . . " She stabs one of the cactus 
leaves, picks up a knife and scrapes at the already dethorned cactus leaf. 
"See, you just do this until you get all the little thorns. See? And you can 
take the knife around the edge here. Then when you're done, you rinse them and 
just cut them in strips. It's easy." 
</P>
<P>
My mother rolls her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to cook them in water years ago, until I wised up," my grandmother 
continues. "But now I just steam them. You get more of the nopales' goodness 
this way. They're medicinal." 
</P>
<P>
"Didn't you used to soak them?" my mother asks. 
</P>
<P>
"No," my grandmother says. 
</P>
<P>
"Didn't you used to cut them in cubes?" 
</P>
<P>
"I like them like this now." 
</P>
<P>
My mother looks distressed. 
</P>
<P>
"Forget the past," my grandmother tells her. "Everything's got to be new."

REMEMBERING THE WOMEN WHO SHAPED OUR TASTES. THE RECIPES ARE THE LEAST OF IT.;

<P>
When I was growing up on the Veracruz coast, the slap-slap of women's hands 
forming corn tortillas was as constant and soothing to me as the crash of the 
nearby surf. I remember wandering into our breezy, tiled kitchen each morning 
and devouring the puffy gold discs as our maids whisked them from the sizzling 
hot comal. 
</P>
<P>
Just as constant was the large ball of masa that sat on the counter top covered 
with a dampened piece of rough-hewn cloth. This simple dough of ground corn and 
water was our staff of life. It was the base not only for our tortillas but for 
countless other dishes that filled our plates and delighted our palates. 
</P>
<P>
For Mexicans, working with masa is a spiritual tradition. As legend tells us, 
the gods molded humans from corn. Some of the very food we place on our tables 
today was enjoyed by Montezuma and by prehistoric Indians. In essence, every 
time we work that heavy, pliable dough through our hands, we place ourselves in 
touch with our ancient roots. 
</P>
<P>
While Americans are beginning to experiment with the wide variety of Mexican 
chiles, salsas and herbs that are now available, they have not yet adopted masa 
into their cooking regime. A big reason for this is that hand work, in general, 
is not a part of the American culinary tradition. Americans are a bit daunted 
by the idea. It seems too complicated and time-consuming, especially when 
frozen entree and gourmet specialty shops provide such an appealing 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
What a shame. Nothing can quite compare to the taste of a mashed ripe avocado 
or a dab of onion-flecked beans cradled in a warm, soft tortilla. Nor can any 
store-bought treat make one's mouth water like the fabulous array of masa 
finger foods we call antojos. 
</P>
<P>
Literally meaning "before the eyes," these savory treats were traditionally 
served before meals to spark the appetite. Today, however, antojos are eaten at 
any time as convenient snacks for those on the go or alongside a tossed salad 
for a delicious meal. 
</P>
<P>
Working with masa as sculptors work with clay, Mexicans have managed to create 
a seemingly endless variety of antojos. Though similar versions may be found 
throughout the country, each region adds its own special twist, be it in the 
spices they use, the thickness of their dough or the shape of their finished 
product. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of pre-ground masa harina and a tortilla press, available in 
specialty shops and some supermarkets, working with masa is relatively fast and 
simple. And the payoff is tremendous. After a little bit of practice, expert 
and novice cooks will find they have discovered one of the most versatile and 
delicious of cooking mediums. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few tricks to cooking successfully with masa. Like a good pie crust 
dough, masa must have just the right consistency -- not too sticky, not too 
dry. The basic recipe I have provided below is my mother's. Start with the 
smaller amount of water and keep adding until the masa is pliable and pulls 
cleanly from your hands. 
</P>
<P>
A proper cooking surface, heated sufficiently, is also crucial. In Mexico, 
antojos and tortillas are cooked on a comal -- a thick iron griddle heated over 
coals. The ideal alternative in the American kitchen is a stove-top griddle. If 
this is not available, a cast-iron pan will do quite well. Either surface 
should be lightly greased with vegetable oil and preheated at medium-high for 
10 to 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, use imagination. Once you feel comfortable, don't be afraid to 
experiment with a variety of fillings and textures. Wrap a warm tortilla around 
leftover ratatouille. Enclose caramelized onions in masa, grill the pocket and 
douse it with a roasted pepper sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Masa is wonderfully adaptable, and its unique flavor and texture will add a new 
dimension to cooking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MASA AND TORTILLAS 
</P>
<P>
FROM MASA HARINA 
</P>
<P>
3 cups masa harina 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 to 2 cups lukewarm water 
</P>
<P>
Combine masa harina, salt and lukewarm water in bowl and mix with fork. Gather 
into ball and knead dough until smooth and no longer sticky. Cover with towel 
and let stand 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
To make tortillas, line base of tortilla press with sheet plastic wrap or 
plastic sandwich bag. Pinch off balls of dough from masa. (Size will vary, 
depending on desired tortilla diameter; balls usually are slightly bigger than 
walnut.) Center masa on lined tortilla press base. Cover masa with sheet 
plastic wrap. Lower top of press and push down on handle. Open. 
</P>
<P>
Carefully peel away plastic from top. Place left hand (if right-handed) under 
tortilla. Flip tortilla onto right hand, so plastic is on top. Carefully peel 
away plastic. Flip tortilla onto preheated, very hot griddle or cast-iron pan. 
When tortilla begins to dry on edges, flip over and cook until top begins to 
puff. Tap lightly with finger tips to allow even puffing and let cook briefly, 
1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Remove tortillas from griddle and wrap in napkin or clean 
towel and serve. Makes 1 1/2 pounds masa or about 24 tortillas.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: YOU CAN EAT THE ATMOSPHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the United States, the cheaper something is, the better it's likely to 
taste. West-Coast black mussels are invariably fresher than green ones flown 
from New Zealand; in-season squashes are nicer than October asparagus from 
Peru. The least expensive restaurants tend to be those closest to home cooking 
-- a $4.50 bowl of posole at a dive is almost always preferable to a $13 bowl 
on Melrose. In certain types of restaurants, Latin-American and Chinese, 
quality is usually inversely proportionate to price. 
</P>
<P>
But with steaks you get what you pay for -- the excellence of the raw material 
is even more important than the care taken in cooking it. The Grill's $27.50 
sirloin may be three times better than the Pantry's $9 job; the dinky, 
profoundly aged steak at Michael's in Santa Monica costs nearly as much per 
ounce as pure silver, and is probably worth it. The Niemann-Schell ranch in the 
Bay Area produces what is by far the best beef in the state of California, but 
charges so much for it that the priciest L.A. restaurants can't afford to put 
it on their menus. Good steak costs. 
</P>
<P>
So good steakhouses pass along the $15-plus per pound they pay for Prime meat 
wholesale, becoming as basically unaffordable as Pacific Dining Car or the 
Palm. (Taylor's, an excellent, old-fashioned steakhouse near Downtown, charges 
somewhat lower prices for Prime steak becausethey dry-age the meat themselves.) 
Other good steakhouses use less expensive grades, but make up for it with low 
prices, strong old-fashioneds and plenty of atmosphere. Among L.A. steakhouses, 
none are more atmospheric than the Arsenal and the Sherman Room. 
</P>
<P>
The Arsenal is your basic restaurant from the Twilight Zone, with medieval 
weaponry mounted on the walls, mortar shells hanging from the ceiling and a 
queer, Heironymous Bosch-like mural of crockery and anteaters painted behind 
the bar. Nailed to the wall above each red-leatherette booth is the Arsenal's 
drink menu, which includes such delights as coffee spiked with tequila and 
Swiss cherry liqueur -- at the Arsenal, evidence of your mortality seems always 
close at hand. 
</P>
<P>
You order a surf 'n' turf platter by asking for "undecided." The only waitress, 
25-year Arsenal veteran Mary Brady, is known to all as the Warden. And I've 
seen a tableful of thirtysomething Peaks Freaks here attempting to tie cherry 
stems into knots with their tongues. 
</P>
<P>
It's somebody's birthday tonight. The Arsenal's ancient jukebox lurches into a 
Bing Crosby-ish recording of "Happy Birthday," and the Warden emerges from the 
kitchen carrying a flaming cocktail that both glows a lurid red and drips 
gobbets of blue flame down the side of the glass. The honoree, who looks as if 
he's been drinking since noon, slouches further down into his seat and stares 
slackly into space. 
</P>
<P>
"It's for you," his wife says, beaming. 
</P>
<P>
"Like a big birthday candle," the Warden adds. 
</P>
<P>
The man scratches himself, burps softly and blows out his drink. Everybody in 
the dining room applauds. 
</P>
<P>
The menu here is exactly what you expect -- meat, foil-wrapped potatoes with 
goopy cheese sauce, and garlic bread -- and though it can take half an hour to 
attract the Warden's attention, a chilled plate of salad is in front of you 30 
seconds after you order. 
</P>
<P>
The big event seems to be chateaubriand for two, the most expensive thing on 
the menu. When it's ready, two honks sound from the kitchen and the Warden 
marches down the aisle followed by a busboy carrying a card table. (The 
procession wouldn't attract any more attention if Madonna were carrying the 
meat.) The busboy sets it down, flicks on a dim, plastic coach-lamp attached to 
the table, and carves the charred tube of steak into eight thick slices, 
transferring them to two plates. He flicks off the light. 
</P>
<P>
"That was wuhhhn-der-foool," the Warden says. 
</P>
<P>
But really, the steak isn't nearly as good as the show. 
</P>
<P>
Consider a New York steak, which has a little more flavor, or perhaps just a 
whole lot of bar-brand Scotch. 
</P>
<P>
The Sherman Room is a little more like a regular steakhouse-bar, the kind you'd 
expect to find in Idaho or Kansas City, with sporting prints, dad's-den 
paneling and a wait that can stretch more than an hour on weekend nights. A 
flagstone fireplace flickers with the cold light of a mechanical log; a blurry 
etching on the mirror behind the bar makes you feel as if you've bolted four 
martinis before you've even touched a drop. The attractions here are the 
prices, which are absurdly low -- steaks cost less than $10; steak and lobster 
less than $15 -- and the friendly waitresses, who seem to have been working 
there since Century City was a bean field. Plus, the restaurant is 21-and-over, 
a joint for grown-ups. 
</P>
<P>
To be truthful, the lobster here isn't the tastiest. The filet steaks seem a 
bit like wet cardboard. But the beer is cold, a New York steak ordered rare 
comes rare, and the garlic toast is pleasantly sodden. For dessert, there's 
that fudgy ice-cream concoction called mud pie. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, let grandma do it," our waitress said one night as she leaned over the 
table and extracted a stubborn lobster tail from its shell. (Previously she had 
refilled our water glasses half a dozen times, poured beer every time the level 
in a glass got a little low, passed out extra napkins in case we wanted them, 
emptied the ashtray an average of three times per cigarette, served the steaks 
and brought us bowls of delicious, smoky lentil soup.) 
</P>
<P>
"Those things can be tricky," she said. 
</P>

GOOD COOKING: FAMILY PLANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Home cooking may not be what it was in grandma's day, but it's still alive and 
well. And changed -- along with our food tastes: Today we prefer simpler meals, 
fresh vegetables, more salads and less elaborate desserts. 
</P>
<P>
In this day of two-career households, we may not spend as many hours in the 
kitchen as our mothers and grandmothers did. But despite all statistics to the 
contrary, my mail tells me that many of us are continuing the tradition of 
cooking meals for our families. There are still those of us who believe that 
sitting down together for a home-cooked meal is the civilized punctuation in 
the day's routine. 
</P>
<P>
The following recipes are from three home cooks: The baked apple dumplings and 
shortbread cookies are actually old family recipes, handed down from 
grandmother to mother to daughter. The beef-and-cabbage-soup recipe with 
caraway seeds is a hearty, thick soup, a popular meal that a working mother 
makes for her sons, hoping to stem the tide of convenience foods so prevalent 
among their peers. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that this column will prompt those of you with popular family recipes to 
send them in to me at Box 127, Winnetka, Ill. 60093. Sharing recipes is one of 
the great joys of cooking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Joan Bilderback of Woodstock, Ill., writes: "When I was growing up there was 
an apple tree in our back yard. This was before the days of home freezers, so 
apple season was eagerly anticipated. My mother and grandmother, both wonderful 
cooks, prepared apples in many delicious ways. Here is their recipe for apple 
dumplings. I think this had to be my favorite of all those apple dishes." 
</P>
<P>
 What makes this apple recipe so appealing is its versatility; consider it a 
brunch side dish with ham or Canadian bacon and eggs, or as a supper 
accompaniment to fried chicken. Add a scoop of ice cream, and it turns into 
dessert. Whatever role you give it, be sure to serve it warm. 
</P>
<P>
BAKED APPLE 
</P>
<P>
DUMPLINGS 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups water 
</P>
<P>
1 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1 3/4 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
3/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
5 tablespoons unsalted butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
Ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
4 small tart apples, about 1 pound total, peeled, halved and cored 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups chopped peeled tart apple 
</P>
<P>
Whipping cream, optional 
</P>
<P>
Place rack in center of oven. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Combine water, sugar and lemon juice in small saucepan. Bring to boil. Simmer, 
uncovered, 5 minutes. Set syrup aside. 
</P>
<P>
Combine flour, baking powder, salt and sugar in food processor fitted with 
metal blade. Add 2 1/2 tablespoons butter and process (or cut with pastry 
blender) until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 1/2 cup water. Mix until 
dough just begins to clump together. Transfer dough to floured board. 
</P>
<P>
Compact dough with hands. Cut in half, then cut each half into quarters to make 
8 equal-size pieces. Gently pat each piece into 3-inch round. (Flour hands for 
easier handling if dough is sticky.) Sprinkle with cinnamon. 
</P>
<P>
Place each piece apple, rounded side down, on center of dough. Wrap dough 
around apple, gently easing dough to cover fruit completely. Repeat with 
remaining dough, cinnamon and apples. 
</P>
<P>
Arrange apples, cut side down, in 2-quart round or square baking dish, spacing 
evenly. Fill spaces with chopped apples. Pour syrup over dumplings. Sprinkle 
with cinnamon and dot with 1 1/2 tablespoons butter. Place dish on baking sheet 
(to catch any spills). 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 350 degrees until lightly browned, about 1 hour, 10 minutes. Brush 
dumplings with remaining 1 tablespoon butter, melted. Cool on rack at least 30 
minutes before serving. Serve warm with whipping cream, if desired. Makes 8 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: If apples are large, use 2, cutting them into quarters. Dumplings can be 
made several hours ahead and kept at room temperature. Reheat in 350-degree 
oven until warmed through, about 20 minutes. Makes 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Gross of Hampshire, Ill., writes that her mother was born in Scotland, 
worked in Chicago as a registered nurse, married a farmer in 1926 and lived a 
busy, scheduled life. "She was a very organized lady with little time for 
extras. So when she made her shortbread . . . it was a real treat. She always 
served them with pride, broadening our isolated Midwestern lives with stories 
of family and of the times these foods had been served at her mother's table." 
</P>
<P>
SHORTBREAD COOKIES 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature 
</P>
<P>
2/3 cup light-brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon cornstarch 
</P>
<P>
Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
Place rack in center of oven. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Cut butter into 4 pieces and place in food processor bowl fitted with metal 
blade. Add brown sugar, flour, cornstarch, salt and vanilla. Process until 
mixture is crumbly. (Or combine ingredients in bowl and rub with fingers until 
crumbly.) 
</P>
<P>
For thin shortbread cookies, divide dough in 5 parts. (Dough is crumbly, 
requiring some patience.) Place each piece on floured board. Cover with wax 
paper, then compress dough lightly with hands. Roll firmly to 1/8-inch thick. 
Cut into 3-inch rounds using cookie cutter or mouth of glass. Reroll leftover 
dough. Repeat with remaining dough, remembering to flour board after each 
batch. Place on baking sheets and bake at 350 degrees until lightly browned, 
about 8 to 10 minutes. Let cookies rest 5 minutes on sheet, then remove to cool 
on rack. 
</P>
<P>
For shortbread bar cookies, pat dough evenly in bottom of 13x9-inch baking pan. 
Working through wax paper, compress dough with hands into smooth surface, 
including edges and corners. Bake at 350 degrees until lightly browned, about 
25 minutes. Cut into 2 1/4-x2 1/6-inch squares while still warm. When cool, use 
spatula to transfer squares from pan. 
</P>
<P>
Makes 15 (3-inch) thin cookies or 24 bar cookies. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Cookies can be stored in airtight container for few days at room 
temperature or frozen up to 3 months.

"Things Change" (1988), directed by David Mamet. 100 minutes. Rated R. An 
Italian shoemaker (Don Ameche) agrees to take the rap for a mob hit, but gets 
one last fling with the low-level Mafioso (Joe Mantegna) assigned to protect 
him. 
</P>
<P>
It's a comic tarantella with a soft-shoe style, and lots of little moments that 
make up for sentimental excesses. 
</P>
<P>
"The Thing" (1951), directed by Christian Nyby. 87 minutes. No rating. Among 
the first in a spate of '50s sci-fi films, this black-and-white movie is said 
to have inspired many contemporary filmmakers and movies. It's intentionally 
spare and direct, but there's wit in the script: the alien turns out to be a 
vegetable, of all things. 
</P>
<P>
"Vampire's Kiss" (1989), directed by Robert Bierman. 96 minutes. Rated R. A 
contemporary spin on the vampire fantasy, with Nicolas Cage as a neurotic New 
Yorker who thinks a one-night stand (Jennifer Beals) has turned him into 
Dracula. May be too offbeat for devoted horror fans, but this clever, 
cartoon-ish metaphor has bite. MARK CHALON SMITH

There are nearly two dozen varieties available, but most who come here order a 
doughnut only as an afterthought. Breakfast sandwiches are a hot item, as are 
massive breakfast plates with four strips of bacon. Or drop by at lunch, when 
the cheeseburger special comes with a choice of fries or egg roll. JOHN WEYLER

Open Monday through Saturday, 1 p.m. to 2 a.m. (714) 533-1286. Top 40 is 
strictly prohibited; it's too loud and cramped to ever be a pickup joint; and 
its grunge-over-glitz motif is the anti-thesis of all those peach-stucco and 
neon yuppie hangouts. It's also the best place in O.C. to hear avant-rock, 
drink Guinness and shoot pool. JOHN PENNER

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: SARDUCCI'S GOOD FOR OPENERS

<P>
Sarducci's Cafe and Grill is best known for its Italian dishes and seafood, and 
features what the restaurant touts as "South Orange County's Most Incredible 
Desserts." But what many don't realize is how good the breakfasts are. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the nature of San Juan Capistrano, Sarducci's offers a very 
relaxed environment and good, friendly service. The place is adorned with 
ceiling fans and white patio furniture and provides a choice of seating indoors 
or out. If you choose to sit out on the lower patio, you can watch the morning 
trains come in. The best news is that it's one of those rare places where you 
can get quality food and generous portions at a very reasonable price. 
</P>
<P>
Definitely worth trying are the Eggs Alaska (poached egg on an English muffin 
with tomatoes, crab and Hollandaise sauce), and the Seafood Omelette, with 
crab, shrimp and Hollandaise. The Italian Sausage Omelette is topped with tangy 
marinara sauce and comes, as all omelets here do, with potatoes and mini-carrot 
muffins or toast. 
</P>
<P>
The Cajun breakfast, with spicy smoked ham, sausage, chicken and scrambled 
eggs, pleases the more adventurous palate. Other good possibilities include 
chicken and mushroom crepes with sherried cream sauce, seafood crepes with 
crab, shrimp and Hollandaise sauce, and a familiar favorite: eggs Benedict. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to their good coffee, Sarducci's offers espresso or cappuccino, and 
a choice of fresh juices. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday brunches, accompanied by champagne, fruit juice or mimosa, are $7.95. 
The regular breakfasts are moderately priced, at around $10 to $12 for two 
people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Sarducci's, 31751 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Open daily, 8 a.m. 
to 10 p.m., Friday and Saturday till 11 p.m. (714) 493-9593. AMY McCURDY

KID STUFF: A WALK ON THE WILD SIDE WITH YOUNG NATURE LOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
Kid Stuff for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forget the videos and pricey toys. To most kids, heaven on earth is a double 
handful of dirt, room to roam and plenty of time to explore every bug and 
butterfly that crosses their path. Add to this a knowledgeable (and patient) 
grown-up to guide them, and you've got an unbeatable recipe for learning. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, there are several competent groups ready to expose your junior 
naturalist to the wild side of Orange County. Guided tours, geared for young 
people from infancy through college-age, are available at little or no charge 
from the following organizations: 
</P>
<P>
Nursery Nature Walks, led by four Orange County mothers under the auspices of 
the South Coast YMCA, offers babies, toddlers and preschoolers a chance to get 
down and dirty in Upper Newport Bay, Orange's Irvine Regional Park and Santiago 
Oaks Park, and Mission Viejo's Wilderness Glen. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very touchy-feely kind of experience," explained Dana Barney, who 
established the program in 1987. "We don't cover a lot of ground (most walks 
are about one-quarter to one-half mile) because we let the children set the 
pace. If they find a new bug, we talk about bugs; if they want to play in the 
dirt, we talk about dirt. 
</P>
<P>
"They're generally pretty grubby by the time we're done, but that's all part of 
nature, right?" 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's Nursery Nature Walks were inspired by a larger program serving 
L.A. and Ventura counties, which has involved more than 13,000 children and 
adults since it began in 1985. Local YMCAs assist both groups with insurance 
and publicity. Before leading a hike, volunteer docents must undergo an 
eight-part training course covering topics such as geology, botany and American 
history, as well as a variety of nature-themed games, songs and sensory 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
Nursery Nature Walks are held several times each month. Times and dates vary. 
Most walks last about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. A $3 donation is asked from each 
family. 
</P>
<P>
The Friends of Newport Bay, a nonprofit volunteer group dedicated to preserving 
the 752-acre Upper Newport Bay State Ecological Reserve, offers monthly public 
tours of this natural estuary to families, students and youth groups. (An 
estuary, by the way, is "a very productive area where salt and fresh water meet 
and mix," says park ranger Nancy Bruland.) The tours run from October through 
March, during the migration period for birds, but the best viewing is often in 
late November. During the three-quarter-mile hike, visitors meet with experts 
on the area's natural history and native birds and plants. Afterward, guests 
can explore the bay on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Tours depart every second Saturday of the month beginning at 9 a.m. from the 
corner of Back Bay and Eastbluff drives in Newport Beach. The walks are open to 
everyone but are mostly accessible to children age 8 and up. There is no fee; 
reservations suggested. 
</P>
<P>
The fish and game folks and the county's Department of Harbors, Beaches and 
Parks have teamed up to offer two nature programs for families. Beginning next 
month and continuing through April, they'll gather 'round the campfire at 
Newport Dunes for an evening of nature-themed songs, skits and stories. The 
free programs begin at sunset; reservations recommended. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, on the first and third Saturday of each month, park rangers and 
local naturalists lead 1 1/2-hour walks through various sites on the reserve. 
The walk is open to all ages; there's a fee of $2.25 per person. 
</P>
<P>
What: Nature walks for children and families. 
</P>
<P>
When: Year round. 
</P>
<P>
Where: Upper Newport Bay State Ecological Reserve; Irvine Regional Park and 
Santiago Oaks Park in Orange, Wilderness Glen Park in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Whereabouts: Take Harbor Boulevard south from Riverside Freeway or north from 
Interstate 5 and head east on Broadway. The Celebrity is on the left, just past 
Anaheim Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Wherewithal: Fees vary (some are free). 
</P>
<P>
Where To Call: Nursery Nature Walks, (714) 643-1444; Friends of Newport Bay, 
(714) 646-8009; Department of Fish and Game/O.C. Department of Harbors, Beaches

RESTAURANTS: PASTA AND LOVE, LA GRIGLIA STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a romantic story behind La Griglia, the cozy trattoria that opened 
recently in Anaheim Hills. Owner Gaetano Ianni literally met his wife, who is 
the restaurant's unofficial maitresse d', on the Love Boat. The young man from 
the southernmost city in Italy and the young Irishwoman fell in love while they 
were working for Princess Cruise Lines. 
</P>
<P>
Today Ianni and his wife, Donna, are in dry dock at their new restaurant, a 
real charmer that has brought instant improvement to dining in the remote 
foothills near the Riverside County line. 
</P>
<P>
The cooking here is Italian to the bone, but the decor is somehow French. The 
dining room is pink and pastel green, with a bay window and flowery curtains. 
Fresh orchids in Art Deco swan vases grace every table, and the white 
tablecloths and minimalist black designer chairs, standing on a gleaming white 
tile floor, look ever so simple in contrast. It's a casual, airy room and it 
suits the home-style food the restaurant serves. 
</P>
<P>
A few feet behind the tables, chefs toil away in the open kitchen. Right in the 
middle of the space is a large metal spit where Ianni and the chefs roast 
rabbit, lamb and chicken. He is fond of fresh herbs, and the scents of thyme 
and rosemary permeate the air. You catch a whiff of them the minute you enter, 
and it becomes almost impossible to limit yourself to a meal of salad and 
pasta. It's one of the most irresistible sales techniques I can think of. 
</P>
<P>
To the left of the kitchen is a large deli case where most of the antipasti are 
displayed. That's good technique, too, because it allows you to choose from 
what looks good to you. One antipasto you won't see is bruschetta, normally 
garlic-rubbed, grilled bread with olive oil, chopped tomatoes and fresh basil. 
As in most Italian restaurants around here, authenticity is skirted with this 
dish; the bread is oven toasted rather than grilled. But La Griglia serves a 
delicious version with the right combination of flavors dominated by sweet, 
fresh basil. 
</P>
<P>
I wasn't as thrilled with antipasto misto, just some marinated vegetables with 
the usual combination of cold cuts and cheeses. They seemed a bit tired, as if 
they had been sitting already cut for a while. But there is an arresting 
starter called olive all'Ascolana. It's billed as a green olive stuffed with 
veal and cheese, but in reality the olive is the stuffing, with a breaded, 
crumbly mixture of the meat and cheese on the outside. It's a real pub dish, 
like what the English (or the Irish) call a Scotch egg, with a Kalamata olive 
playing the part of the egg. Maybe they should change the name to olive alla 
Scozzese, or Scotch olive. 
</P>
<P>
There's an interesting mix of soups and salads here, too, should the antipasti 
seem too indulgent. Other than a lunchtime Caesar annoyingly made with iceberg 
lettuce instead of romaine, I liked them all, and found several quite 
innovative. 
</P>
<P>
The minestrone alla contadina, for example, is done with peas, green beans and 
Swiss chard, all of which stand up nicely in hearty chicken broth. Pastina, 
those tiny semolina pearls that Italian mothers have been feeding their babies 
for centuries, are brightened by a beef broth flavored with fresh parsley and 
basil. The salads are good too, especially insalata caprese, which the 
restaurant makes with a tasty, finely textured mozzarella it buys from a Los 
Angeles cheese maker. Ask for his scamorza or smoked mozzarella, as well. Ianni 
brushes it with olive oil, a bit of pepper and some oregano. It's delightful. 
</P>
<P>
The pastas here are rich and saucy, with the stamp of southern Italy on most of 
them. The filling penne alla rustica for one: tube-shaped pasta with fresh 
tomato, sausage, mushrooms, red wine and pancetta makes a complete dinner. 
There is a classic penne alla puttanesca dosed with Greek olives, lots of 
garlic and capers and a heady red sauce. Lasagna pecorara is a dense pie heavy 
with ricotta and cream, dotted gently with a touch of ground meat. Only 
vermicelli Calabrese, from Ianni's hometown of Reggio Calabria, approaches 
lightness. The thin spaghetti with broccoli, olive oil and red pepper make a 
palatable dish you could eat every day. 
</P>
<P>
By now you know that it's a task to save room for the roasted meats, but since 
you are constantly reminded of them by their scents they will not slip your 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
Chicken is the lightest of them, and probably also the best, served with 
lightly sauteed vegetables. It is rubbed with rosemary and comes out with a 
crisp skin. 
</P>
<P>
I wasn't as happy with the lamb or pork, although both were basically sound. 
The lamb looked wonderful on the spit, with a brown crust I wanted to taste. 
But when the meat arrived, the crust had been cut off, and I couldn't detect 
the herbs. The pork seemed a bit tough and came blanketed in a thick, 
overpowering thyme sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Avoid the gummy, storebought cheesecakes at dessert and head right into Donna 
Ianni's special tiramisu, served in a wine glass. Just when I think this dish 
is getting to be a cliche, someone comes up with a fresh version that I want to 
eat again and again. This is an impossibly rich tiramisu, layers of 
unadulterated mascarpone cheese punctuated with pungent espresso coffee and 
rum-soaked ladyfingers. 
</P>
<P>
La Griglia is high end moderate. Antipasti are $3.50 to $5.50. Paste are $8.50 
to $15.50. Meats are $14.75 to $19.50.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE WAS A GOOD SAMARITAN ON A TOUGH DAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Charlene Johanneson of Elbert, Colo., was driving home with her son and 
daughter on Interstate 25 near Denver Sunday when a hit-and-run driver struck 
their car from behind. 
</P>
<P>
Denver Bronco Coach Dan Reeves and his wife, driving home from the Broncos' 
34-17 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, stopped to help. After calling police on 
his car phone, Reeves stayed at the scene for 45 minutes until an ambulance 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Said Johanneson: "You know the guy wasn't feeling on top of the world. It was 
very admirable. I just think it was a very honorable thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Add Reeves: Johanneson told the Associated Press: "He introduced himself. I was 
so shaken up it didn't register. I thought, 'This guy looks familiar.' While I 
talked to the police, my son told Mr. Reeves that he looked familiar. 
</P>
<P>
"(Reeves) said, 'I'm the coach of the Denver Broncos.' My son is just Broncos 
crazy, and all he could say was 'Wow.' " 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Name the boxer who fought for the heavyweight title in his first 
professional bout. 
</P>
<P>
Service to sport: Inside Sports, in its November issue, fills out the entire 
1991 NCAA basketball tournament draw sheet, complete with seeding Nos. 1 
through 16 in each of the four regions. 
</P>
<P>
Quite a feat. Not only does the magazine tell us that South Florida will make 
it to the East Regional, it reads the minds of the selection committee well 
enough to know the Bulls seeded 14th. 
</P>
<P>
And the sixth-seeded-to-be Missouri Tigers will be shocked to learn that No. 11 
Murray State will knock them off in Round 1 of the Midwest Regional. 
</P>
<P>
Add Inside Sports: The magazine's predicted Final Four: Georgetown over North 
Carolina in one semifinal, Arizona over Arkansas in the other and Arizona over 
Georgetown for the title. 
</P>
<P>
Be prepared, too, for fourth-seeded UCLA to beat No. 13 Wisconsin in the 
Midwest, then lose to No. 5 Pitt. 
</P>
<P>
And of course No. 7 Cal State Long Beach will lose to No. 10 Houston in the 
West, where No. 14 USC also will lose its opener to No. 3 Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
Fan-tastic debut: To help promote its first season of NBA telecasts, NBC-TV got 
the Philadelphia 76ers to suit up commentator Ahmad Rashad for an exhibition 
game against the Minnesota Timberwolves in Minneapolis Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The 76ers, unfazed by Rashad's 2 1/2 minutes of playing time the third quarter, 
won 102-96. The former wide receiver with the St. Louis Cardinals and the 
Minnesota Vikings hit a 20-foot jump shot, but allowed his man, Tony Campbell, 
to score five points. 
</P>
<P>
While Rashad was playing, the Timberwolves cut an 11-point deficit to five. 
</P>
<P>
He was there: Yogi Berra was Paul Hornung's guest on last Saturday's telecast 
of "Greatest Sports Legends." 
</P>
<P>
Marion Brancato of Glendale wanted to be sure he got Yogi right, so he rewound 
the tape and heard: 
</P>
<P>
Hornung: "Yogi, the sixth game of the '56 World Series has to go down as one of 
the greatest baseball games of all time. You caught Don Larsen in that perfect 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Berra: "Well, it has to be, Paul, because it's never happened in the World 
Series competition and it still hasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Alma maters: File this one under "casual trivia." Has any former major leaguer 
other than Joe Torre managed all three of his former teams (New York Mets, 
Atlanta Braves and St. Louis Cardinals)? 
</P>

Defending champion Tim Simpson, who revamped his putting stroke overnight, 
cruised to an eight-under-par 64 Wednesday to take the first-round lead in the 
Disney Golf Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson, who has three PGA Tour victories in 13 years, made nine birdies and 
one bogey over the Lake Buena Vista Course, considered the easiest of the three 
layouts used in the $1-million event. 
</P>
<P>
"I played real solid, drove well and hit some good iron shots," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
But the change in his putting made the difference, Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
He putted for two hours Tuesday, adjusting his stance and slowing his stroke to 
return to a style that he had used in high school. "I just had to change, it 
was so bad," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Buttner was two strokes behind the leader after his round of 66, also at 
Lake Buena Vista. Buttner, who hasn't won in eight years on tour, had four 
birdies on the front side and an eagle on the par-five 14th hole. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson was three strokes ahead of five golfers with 67s -- John Mahaffey, Paul 
Azinger and Mike Smith, who toured the tough Palm Course; Nick Price, at Lake 
Buena Vista, and Dave Barr, at Magnolia. 
</P>
<P>
Mahaffey, a 10-time tour winner, and Smith each had six birdies.

Now that Kirk Gibson wants to be the manager and general manager, as well as 
the left fielder, the Dodgers should tell him where to go. . . .

Wednesday night's World Series game, which had a little bit of everything, was 
the best show of the new TV season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Was I seeing things or did Barry Larkin miss third base on his way to scoring

Johnny Bench, who ought to know better, called Riverfront Stadium the

<P>
My favorite crowd shot on opening night of the Series showed an older woman in 
a Reds jacket practicing the lost art of scorekeeping. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Success story of the year at USC is nose guard Don Gibson. He missed the 1989 
regular season after tearing up his knee, got into the Rose Bowl game and then 
suffered a broken ankle in 1990 spring practice. But now he's back at the top 
of his game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Gibson is playing at the same level as Tim Ryan and Dan Owens did," Coach 
Larry Smith said. "In films, he jumps right out at you. At Arizona, we had the 
Boot Award for the comeback player of the year. He would win it here." . . . 
</P>
<P>
USC-Oregon State Nov. 10 at Corvallis, Ore., will be the only Trojan game not 
on television. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Michael Nguyen, the UCLA freshman wide receiver who was born in Vietnam, 
appeared in the Michigan game, suffered torn ligaments in his hand and probably 
won't play again this season. If not, he probably will get the year of 
eligibility back. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If the remodeled Coliseum is as nice as it's supposed to be, UCLA should 
consider moving back from the Rose Bowl. . . .

Can't wait for the Independence Bowl. This week, representatives are scouting

In his prime, Vann McElroy, the safety traded by the Raiders to Seattle, ranked

hardest-hitting defensive backs. . . .

<P>
Have the Rams heard about that new invention, the Class B free agent? . . .

As with baseball, few football transactions were made just before the trading

The Clippers' second draft choice, Loy Vaught, is playing better than their

The New York Mets believe that erstwhile Minnesota Viking running back D.J.

The Chargers would like the Kansas City Royals to improve their baseball team. 
It's that simple. 
</P>
<P>
Send Bo Jackson to the AL playoffs, send him to the World Series. Why not even 
give him three weeks in Hawaii after the Series to rest his muscles and enter 
his football mind-set? 
</P>
<P>
"I hate him," Charger linebacker Gary Plummer said, smiling. "I'd rather go 
against one of the running backs at Crawford High School." 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, Gary. You're stuck with Bo. He is scheduled to play his first football 
game of the season on Sunday when the Raiders play the Chargers at San Diego 
Jack Murphy Stadium. And, of course, Marcus Allen will also be on hand. 
</P>
<P>
Two Heisman Trophy winners in the same backfield. Some fun for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Tough as Jackson is, there is more concern about Allen, who is eighth in the 
AFC in rushing with 295 yards in 73 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see Marcus on the bench," Charger cornerback Sam Seale said. "Both 
can beat you, but, to me, Marcus can beat you in more than one way. Bo can beat 
you in a lot of ways, but I think Marcus can beat you in more ways." 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Billy Ray Smith worked with trainer Keoki Kamau Wednesday, but 
probably will not be ready for Sunday's game. Smith has been on injured reserve 
four weeks because of an abdominal strain. "He looks like he's moving around 
pretty good," Henning said. "They have to make some strength determinations to 
(see) if he can handle what he's got to do in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Safety Vencie Glenn may miss Sunday's game because of a pulled hamstring, the 
latest of several injuries that have slowed him recently. "I've probably missed 
more practice in the last four weeks than I had in the last four years." 
</P>
<P>
Other Chargers questionable for Sunday's game include: tight end Arthur Cox 
(large toe), cornerback Donald Frank (fingers), offensive guard David Richards 
(large toe) and Seale (fingers). 
</P>
<P>
Raider injuries: Linebacker Art Jimerson (neck) is doubtful, running back Greg 
Bell (ankle) is questionable. DON PATTERSON

LOCAL GROUP TO MEET WITH NHL FRANCHISE COMMITTEE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Harry Cooper, the man behind the drive to bring a major league hockey franchise 
to San Diego, should know more about the city's chances of landing an NHL 
expansion team after today's meeting with a league subcommittee in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, attorney Scott Wolfe and an undisclosed number of San Diego 
representatives will meet in an informal question-and-answer session with the 
league's Franchise and Market Analysis Committee at NHL headquarters to present 
their plans to bring an expansion team to San Diego, preferably no sooner than 
1996-97, according to Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll tell them what we have to offer and what the business community can 
offer," Cooper said. "We can't guarantee that (the awarding of a franchise) 
will happen (this year), but we're trying." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Sports Arena is too small for a major league hockey team and part 
of Cooper's pitch will be a new 18,000-seat arena that could be operable as 
early as 1994, but 1996 is a more realistic target date. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't do it by 1992-93," Cooper said. "We wouldn't get investors to take 
that kind of risk." 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe, the La Jolla attorney who put together the Padre ownership group, said 
building the arena and bringing a hockey team to San Diego is a joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
"They go hand in hand," Wolfe said. "The focus is that we need a new major 
league team to justify the new arena. Then, when plans for the arena are more 
definitive, we can have a team to move into it." 
</P>
<P>
NHL spokesman Gerry Helper said the 12-man committee, co-chaired by Chicago 
Blackhawk owner Bill Wirtz and NHL President John Ziegler, will report details 
of the session to the league's governing board, but it won't make suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said he expects today's 35-40 minute session to be one of several 
meetings before the board's Dec. 4-8 meetings in Palm Beach, Fla., where two to 
six expansion franchises are expected to be awarded. 
</P>
<P>
"Two is a speculative guess," Helper said, "but there's always the chance that 
they could add more." 
</P>
<P>
The 21-team NHL, which has not expanded since 1979, has set its sights on a 
28-team league by 2000. San Jose has already been awarded a franchise and will 
compete in the 1991-92 season. 
</P>
<P>
Of the original 11 groups that paid a $100,000 application fee -- up to $65,000 
of it is refundable at the board's discretion -- nine from eight cities remain. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California is considered to have two bids. In addition to the group 
led by Cooper, Jerry Buss, owner of the Lakers and the former owner of the NHL 
Kings, has applied for a franchise in an undisclosed Southern California 
location. Groups representing Houston, Seattle, Miami, St. Petersburg and 
Tampa, Fla., Ottawa, and Hamilton, Canada, have also applied. 
</P>
<P>
Two International Hockey League cities, Phoenix and Milwaukee, have withdrawn 
their applications. Phoenix withdrew its bid a week after it filed and 
Milwaukee, considered to have had a lock on an expansion franchise partly 
because of its state-of-the-art arena, pulled out last week. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Pettit, owner of Milwaukee's IHL team, and the Bradley Center -- where 
the Bucks play -- said the $50 million franchise fee was unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
"Put yourself into the position of trying to run a major league hockey club on 
a loss basis for five to 10 years, even if you come up with five or six players 
who might be considered major league," Pettit said in announcing his decision. 
</P>
<P>
But the $50 million is only a start. There's a $5 million line of credit, up to 
$10 million in start-up costs and the recommended 10,000 season-ticket 
requirement that applicants must produce. 
</P>
<P>
"We do exceed the $100 million required by the NHL," said Cooper, who hopes 
Pettit's withdrawal would give the remaining applicants some leverage in trying 
to persuade the NHL to cut its fees for an expansion franchise. "Now's the time 
to tell them. Milwaukee saying those things makes it easier for us to say maybe 
they're trying to get too much." 
</P>
<P>
With Seattle's proximity to Vancouver, San Diego's to Los Angeles and San Jose 
in between them all, the West Coast may have the inside track for a new 
franchise. But Seattle is having trouble finding an ownership group, and has 
hired the First National Bank of Chicago to find one. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to expand on the West Coast," one league source said. "I think San 
Diego has a better chance than a lot of people think." 
</P>
<P>
As long as it can find the capital. Cooper said a core ownership group of 10 to 
12 investors, representing the business, real estate development, banking and 
political communities of the city, has been identified from an interested group 
of 20 to 30 businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been working with a cross section of business people," said Cooper, who 
will present financial portfolios to the committee. "But no one wants to put 
their name up for disclosure." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper has said he would be interested in a negotiable 10% ownership, but he is 
still looking for a general managing partner. Of the two he has in mind, one 
has been identified as Howard Baldwin, a sports consultant and movie producer 
in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin, an alternate on the NHL Board of Governors for Minnesota, is in the 
process of selling his 24.5% interest in the North Stars.

Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.: Third-quarter earnings for the San 
Francisco-based utility were $394.2 million, up 24% over the same quarter of 
1989. Revenue was $2.6 billion, up 17% over the third quarter of last year. The 
company said the results were due to an "excellent performance" by the utility 
business and its Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant.

Shopping for Halloween costumes at a thrift shop can be an adventure. For the 
most part it is the luck of the draw because recycled clothing comes in and 
goes out in a matter of days. But with a little imagination, an innovative 
costume can be put together faster than you can say "abracadabra" and for less 
than the retail cost of bat wings and lizard lips.

U.S. MUST BE FREE TO ATTACK IRAQ, BAKER SAYS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III insisted Wednesday that the Bush 
Administration must be free to attack Iraq without getting specific approval 
from Capitol Hill, although he promised to consult frequently with 
congressional leaders over U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"Our chances of settling (the gulf crisis) without resort to the use of force 
will be much improved if the opposition knows that we have got (military power) 
there and that we would not be reluctant to use it," Baker told the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
But most members of the committee, long one of the most dovish in Congress, 
made it clear that they oppose the use of military power except in response to 
new aggression from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Going far beyond the requirements of the Vietnam-era War Powers Resolution, 
several lawmakers said the Administration should not consider offensive action 
without asking Congress for a formal declaration of war. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members also expressed alarm at the prospect that President Bush 
might initiate combat during the 10-week congressional recess expected to begin 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
"I, for one, am not giving advance approval for any unilateral U.S. military 
action," said Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.). 
</P>
<P>
In an interview released Wednesday, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de 
Cuellar also discussed the military option. The German weekly magazine Stern 
quoted him as saying that if U.N.-imposed economic sanctions against Iraq do 
not work, military action "would be perfectly legitimate" -- should the U.N. 
Security Council so decide. 
</P>
<P>
Baker told the Senate committee that the Administration is prepared to keep 
congressional leaders informed probably in secret. But he said it would be a 
big mistake to stage the sort of full-scale debate that would be required 
before Congress could be expected to authorize military action. That sort of 
discussion would tip off Iraqi President Saddam Hussein about U.S. operational 
plans, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"You are not going to surprise Saddam Hussein; you are going to surprise the 
American people," Sen. Terry Sanford (D-N.C.) said. "I understand about 
operational security. I don't want to know where or when, but I want to know 
if." 
</P>
<P>
Baker responded: "If we have a big, long debate up here about whether -- we're 
going to have to talk about where and if and what with and who with." 
</P>
<P>
He also said the Administration objects to creating a special congressional 
committee to oversee the Administration's gulf policy during the recess on 
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty hard for me to say that the President would not, under any 
circumstances, take any action or do anything that he, as commander in chief, 
felt was necessary to protect American citizens, for instance, without first 
having some sort of consultation procedure or process formally in place," Baker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for you to give us a blank check," he said. "We know that. But we 
can't give you one either." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Baker said the Administration may soon return to the U.N. 
Security Council to seek authorization for the use of force. But he said that 
such a move would involve stand-by approval only -- in effect, the sort of 
blank check he conceded that the Administration cannot get from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be looking for authority to move in the future, if necessary," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Washington would resist any effort to put under U.N. command 
the multinational force in the gulf. He said that, although 25 nations have 
committed units to the force, the U.S. contingent is by far the largest. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned about putting the lives of our American men and women 
over there in the hands of someone other than an American military commander," 
Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
On related topics: 
</P>
<P>
Baker acknowledged that the run-up in the price of oil since the start of the 
crisis has resulted in windfall profits to Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf 
oil producers far in excess of the amount that they have agreed to contribute 
to the U.S.-sponsored coalition against Iraq. But he said he will seek 
additional "burden-sharing" payments if the crisis continues into 1991. 
</P>
<P>
He said that if Hussein withdraws peacefully from Kuwait and thus keeps his 
formidable army intact, the Administration will ask the U.N. Security Council 
to continue the arms embargo against Iraq and to impose tough new sanctions 
intended to prevent Baghdad from developing nuclear weapons or expanding its 
arsenal of chemical arms.

STATE UNVEILS RENEWABLE ENERGY PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a major push to encourage use of renewable energy sources, the California 
Energy Commission Wednesday released a plan to meet almost half the state's new 
electric-power needs with wind, biomass, solar and geothermal generation. 
</P>
<P>
If the plan is approved by the Public Utilities Commission, California would 
become the first state to require that a specific portion of its power needs be 
met by such sources. Under the proposal, renewable-energy companies would no 
longer have to compete head-to-head with fossil-fuel generating plants but 
would have a share of the business reserved exclusively for them. The plan 
would set aside for renewable energy companies contracts to provide as much as 
1,700 megawatts of the projected 3,500 new megawatts of electric power the 
state will need over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest boost that the industry has ever had," said V. John White, 
executive director of the Coalition for Energy Efficiency and Renewable 
Technology, or CEERT, a group of independent power producers, environmentalists 
and energy efficiency services formed last April. 
</P>
<P>
"We have become the first state in the nation to formally institutionalize 
environmental costs in resource options," said Charles R. Imbrecht, chairman of 
the Energy Commission. "What we have done is a first step." 
</P>
<P>
Renewable-energy companies and environmentalists have long argued that 
utilities do not give proper weight to the environmental benefits of renewable 
fuels. This makes it harder for the companies to win long-term contracts, 
especially when they compete against cheap fossil-fuel energy sources such as 
natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the renewable-energy firms have trouble attracting the investment 
they need to build plants and improve their technologies. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people around the country assume that we will have renewable energy 
available in 10 to 20 years, but this is the first policy decision by a state 
regulatory commission to ensure that," said Tim Duane, a consultant to the 
coalition and a Sierra Club member. 
</P>
<P>
California's utility companies generally oppose the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very supportive of the basic issues," said Vikram Budhraja, manager of 
electric-system planning for Southern California Edison. "But our approach does 
not go as far as the total set-aside. . . . We would rather see it go through a 
competitive bidding process." 
</P>
<P>
Edison said it already takes account of environmental benefits when it 
considers bids from various electrical power companies. 
</P>
<P>
The set-asides are likely to be phased out as renewable-energy sources gain a 
larger share of the state's market for electric power, Imbrecht, the Energy 
Commission chairman, said. 
</P>
<P>
"The set-aside is designed to ensure that we continue to make progress in 
diversifying our energy sources in California," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Commission plan is part of its 1990 Electricity Report, a projection 
of future energy needs made by the commission every two years. 
</P>
<P>
Edison and other utilities actually give out the contracts -- to provide 
electric power over periods from 20 to 30 years -- to independent energy 
companies, under guidelines set by the California Public Utilities Commission. 
The PUC must decide, in hearings beginning Nov. 1, whether to include the 
Energy Commission plan in its Biennial Resource Planning Update, which 
determines how California utilities acquire their electrical energy. The PUC 
update will be released for review in February, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"We give great weight obviously to the Energy Commission's biennial resource 
plan," said PUC Commissioner Stanley W. Hulett, "but we have other statutory 
requirements, particularly those that look at the needs of the ratepayers." 
</P>
<P>
"But speaking for myself," added Hulett, "to encourage a significant diversity 
in our resources, we may well have to look at set-sides of some kind to make 
sure that we're not putting all of our energy eggs in one basket." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lizbeth McDannel, director of policy and planning for Luz 
International Ltd., a West Los Angeles-based solar company with nine large 
solar power plants in the Mojave Desert near Boron, considered the move "very, 
very significant." 
</P>
<P>
"You can't expect to put us on a shelf for 10 years and in the year 2000 pull 
us off and expect our costs to have gone down and our technology to develop," 
said McDannel. "In other words, we might not have been around when they decided 
we were needed." 
</P>
<P>
Luz had been looking at options in other states to expand its 1,600-employee 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to develop projects," said McDannel. "That's how we improve -- by 
going out and building power plants, wherever we need to go. This means we can 
stay here in California."

SENATE RETAINS GAS TAX INCREASE; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: BIPARTISAN LEADERSHIP STOPS AN EFFORT TO DELETE THE 9.5-CENT-A-GALLON 
BOOST FROM ITS DEFICIT-CUTTING PACKAGE. THE ACTION CLEARS THE WAY FOR FINAL 
APPROVAL.

<P>
The Senate's bipartisan leadership staved off a potentially fatal blow to its 
$500-billion deficit reduction package Wednesday night by turning aside an 
effort to eliminate a proposed 9.5-cent-a-gallon increase in the gasoline tax. 
</P>
<P>
The leadership prevailed on a 59-40 roll call, burying the attempt to knock out 
the proposed gas tax increase. California's two senators split over the issue, 
with Democrat Alan Cranston voting to keep the tax in the package and 
Republican Pete Wilson voting to drop it. 
</P>
<P>
Although supporters of the budget plan won their battle, the difficult struggle 
to retain the gas tax signaled the fragile nature of the Senate coalition 
seeking to raise taxes and cut spending in the face of strong election-year 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The move cleared the way for final Senate approval of the deficit reduction 
package, which must be reconciled with a House plan that contains no gasoline 
tax hike. President Bush has indicated that he would support the Senate plan. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and his GOP counterpart, Sen. 
Bob Dole (R-Kan.), led the move to derail what they characterized as a "killer 
amendment" to eliminate the gasoline tax from the bill, saying that it would 
have destroyed their carefully crafted deficit-cutting plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing by the rules in an effort to preserve this package," Dole said. 
"I'm doing the best I can for President Bush, and the last time I checked he 
was a Republican." As for killing the gas tax hike, Dole said: "It would not 
only unravel the package -- it would finish the package." 
</P>
<P>
Dole said that eliminating the gasoline tax would result in the loss of $42.6 
billion in new revenue over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
The struggle over this issue delayed the Senate's progress on the overall 
budget bill. Congressional leaders hope to hammer out a compromise plan in a 
House-Senate conference and complete congressional approval by midnight Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Senate voted, 67 to 32, to kill an effort by Sen. Kent Conrad 
(D-N.D.) to raise top-bracket income tax rates to 33%, cut the proposed gas tax 
increase to 5 cents a gallon and reduce the impact of planned spending cuts on 
farmers and Medicare beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to act on the budget package quickly could throw the government into 
another weekend of fiscal chaos, prompting Bush to shut down government 
services again when the current funding authority runs out, at midnight Friday, 
as he did on Columbus Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The House deficit reduction measure, approved 227 to 203, would raise taxes for 
all Americans, especially those in higher-income brackets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a toughie," said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), chairman of the Senate 
Finance Committee, who was active in the battle to preserve the gasoline tax 
provision. "I think we'll get it (a majority), but it'll be a hell of a fight." 
</P>
<P>
The budget package, which had been endorsed, 15 to 5, by the Senate Finance 
Committee, faced strong election year opposition despite increasing pressure to 
meet the midnight Friday deadline for final congressional action on 
deficit-cutting legislation. 
</P>
<P>
In a party-line split, the House on Tuesday night defied Bush's veto threat and 
approved a Democratic plan that would raise taxes and reduce spending to reach 
the $500-billion deficit reduction target. 
</P>
<P>
The House-passed measure would keep federal gasoline taxes at the current 9 
cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
The White House backed off somewhat Wednesday from its threat to shut down the 
government if Congress had not finished its work before the government's 
spending authority expires. 
</P>
<P>
John H. Sununu, White House chief of staff, said he expected that the President 
would sign another stopgap spending resolution if the lawmakers showed that 
they meant business about passing a deficit reduction plan along the lines of 
the Senate bill. Senate progress slowed to a crawl Wednesday, however, as 
supporters worked behind the scenes to try to round up votes to defeat the move 
by Sen. Steve Symms (R-Ida.) to take the gasoline tax out of the package. 
</P>
<P>
Symms, who said he opposed all tax increases in the package, argued that the 
gasoline levy would weaken the economy and place an unfair burden on commuting 
workers, rural residents and older people. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good test of whether we want to raise taxes or freeze spending," 
Symms told the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
In an impassioned speech in defense of the gasoline tax hike, Dole said the 
deficit reduction effort that was started last May would be lost if the 
increase was deleted. "If we can't win this one, we might as well wrap it up," 
Dole said. "If this amendment passes, count me out." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who also staked his prestige on the outcome of the vote, agreed with 
Dole on the importance of retaining the gas tax. "This is a test of the Senate 
as an institution," Mitchell warned. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we have the minimum level of courage necessary to do something that is 
unpleasant, difficult and unpopular? Once we start down that road (of deleting 
proposed tax increases), this deficit reduction effort will be over." 
</P>
<P>
Some senators who supported the leaders' efforts to preserve the gasoline tax 
in the package served notice in advance that they expected it to be removed or 
scaled back sharply in a Senate-House conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't pick this apart one item at a time," said Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.), 
who said he traditionally opposed raising the gas tax but would vote to 
preserve it to get a budget bill into a Senate-House conference, where it might 
be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Others indicated that they expected the Senate-House conference to produce a 
plan that would place greater burdens on wealthy Americans and less on 
middle-income and lower-income families. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the (Senate) conferees . . . to be fighting for more progressivity," 
Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) said. But his home state colleague, Democratic Sen. J. 
James Exon, who is in a tough race for reelection, said he would oppose any tax 
increases at this time. 
</P>
<P>
"The price of gas is so high now," Sen. William S. Cohen (R-Me.) said. "This is 
not the time to raise the gas tax."

JAPAN'S MONEY TROUBLES BEGIN TO JOLT U.S. ECONOMY; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: JAPANESE INVESTMENTS ABROAD ARE BEING CUT. BUT SOME AMERICAN FIRMS MAY 
FIND ADVANTAGES.

High interest rates, falling stock prices and weak property sales are slowing 
Japan's financial juggernaut. 
</P>
<P>
That's of great concern in the United States, where Japanese money has 
supported everything from the U.S. budget deficit to the expansion of urban 
skylines. The recent reduction of such investment has been partly responsible 
for depressing U.S. commercial real estate values and driving up American 
interest rates, many experts say. And U.S. businesses may find it harder to tap 
Japanese banks -- by far the world's largest -- for loans. 
</P>
<P>
But Japanese financial problems could narrow the overwhelming advantage that 
Japanese companies have enjoyed over U.S. firms because of cheap capital. It 
also could help U.S. banks and other businesses seeking inroads in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"One and a half years ago (the Japanese) were raising money for nothing. They 
were on steroids," says Kenneth S. Courtis, chief economist at Deutsche Bank 
Group in Tokyo. "Now it is back to the normal interest rate structure they 
lived with in the 1960s." 
</P>
<P>
Japanese banks and life insurance companies, scared off by a faltering U.S. 
economy, are scaling back their U.S investments. Nippon Life Insurance Co., 
with billions of dollars in foreign investments, said recently it would invest 
only 10% of its new funds overseas, down from about 16% last year. Of the money 
that does go overseas, more will go to Europe where healthier growth is 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate companies, too, are retrenching, weakening already depressed real 
estate markets in the United States. "They were the one bright light in the 
whole picture," Alan Woodhull, a Japan expert at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets 
in New York, said of Japan's real estate investments in the United States 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Shuwa Corp., which has been one of the most aggressive Japanese investors in 
U.S. real estate, is said to have put some of its properties in California, New 
York and Washington, D.C., up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The company's Taco Bell building in Irvine, for example, is for sale, Orange 
County real estate brokers say. Japanese newspapers report that the company has 
$7.7 billion in debt and has suffered from price drops of retail store stocks 
in which it invested heavily. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese investors -- among the biggest suppliers of capital to the U.S. 
economy in the 1980s -- so far have removed almost $10 billion from U.S. stock 
and bond markets in the first half of this year, according to figures released 
recently by the Securities Industry Assn., a New York-based trade group. 
</P>
<P>
That pullback is making it more difficult for the U.S. Federal Reserve Board to 
help revive the American economy with lower interest rates. Current U.S. 
interest rates already are so unattractive that Japanese investors cut back 
their purchases of U.S. Treasury bills by two-thirds at the last auction, and 
there are concerns over the level of Japanese participation at future auctions. 
</P>
<P>
The outflow of money has also put pressure on the dollar, which has lost nearly 
20% of its value against the Japanese yen since early this year, threatening to 
push prices up further. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of the credit crunch on Japan is less clear. Japan's financial 
sector is feeling some pain. And smaller Japanese companies are likely to 
suffer from higher capital costs. 
</P>
<P>
But most observers say Japan's largest industrial companies, flush with cash 
thanks to cheap capital during the 1980s, will emerge healthy if somewhat 
sobered. 
</P>
<P>
To a large extent, Japan's current cash crunch was engineered by government 
authorities. In an effort to cool the nation's economy, the Bank of Japan has 
steadily raised interest rates. And Japan's Ministry of Finance, concerned 
about exploding land prices and speculative stock buying, has ordered banks to 
cut down on their financing of land and stock deals. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation this week of Ichiro Isoda, chairman of giant Sumitomo Bank, in 
connection with a branch head's involvement in stock speculation was a warning 
to other bankers to stay away from land and stock deals, says an executive at a 
major Japanese regional bank. 
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance has also proposed an increase in land taxes to cool 
rising land prices. 
</P>
<P>
But Japan's financial mandarins may be getting more than they bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
The stock crash, for example. The financial system is reeling from plummeting 
stock values that have erased about $1.7 trillion, or 38%, from stock values 
since the market's peak late last year. The Ministry of Finance was forced to 
ease certain investment requirements and take other measures earlier this month 
to prevent a further fall. 
</P>
<P>
Land prices, too, look like they are heading for a fall. Condominium sales in 
Tokyo have already shown signs of weakening and real estate brokers say few 
deals are being made. Experts say fire sales of land by big Japanese companies 
that had invested heavily in real estate during the 1980s boom could push land 
prices down by as much as 20% to 30% over the next several months. 
</P>
<P>
One company forced into such fire sales is Itoman &amp; Co. Over the past five 
years, Itoman President Yoshihiko Kawamura had borrowed heavily from banks to 
refashion his old-line company from a trader in suit fabric into a real estate 
empire with interests ranging from golf courses in Vancouver to industrial 
parks in Thailand and housing projects in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But now, unable to meet costly bank payments, Kawamura announced last week that 
Itoman would pull out of real estate altogether, unloading more than $5.4 
billion worth of property over the next year to pay off its debts. 
</P>
<P>
A drop in land prices would contribute to tighter money by making it more 
difficult for landowners to borrow using their property as collateral. 
</P>
<P>
The hardest hit by recent events have been the Japanese banks. By reducing the 
value of the banks' extensive stock holdings, the stock crash has dramatically 
shrunk their capital base. Under Bank of International Settlement regulations 
set to go into effect in 1993, the banks will be required to either raise new 
capital or cut back on their lending. 
</P>
<P>
With their own stock prices down about 50%, Japanese bankers will find raising 
the money costly, and many are already lowering lending targets. 
</P>
<P>
And if land prices fall, Japanese banks -- just like their U.S. counterparts -- 
could find themselves stuck with a growing portfolio of bad loans. Between 1987 
and 1989, banks increased their investment in loans to individuals and for 
property-related deals by 53%, adding $512 billion to those risky assets. 
</P>
<P>
As in the United States, riskier lending stemmed in part from deregulation of 
interest-rate controls, which has taken place in Japan over the last five 
years. Because banks had to pay higher interest rates to depositors, they 
sought borrowers willing to pay higher interest rates. Those new borrowers were 
high credit risks, says Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at Nomura Research 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
While the problems are still a far cry from those at U.S. banks, U.S. 
credit-rating agencies such as Moody's Investors Service have begun downgrading 
ratings of Japanese banks, cutting the top AAA ratings that many Japanese 
bankers had assumed would always be their privilege. 
</P>
<P>
One unlikely beneficiary of the Japanese banks' cutback in lending is the 
struggling U.S. bank sector in Japan. "The Japanese are sending their customers 
to us," says a U.S. banker in Tokyo. In September, foreign banks in Japan 
raised their yen lending to $66 billion, up 27% from the previous month, 
according to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a Japanese economics newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Losers include the U.S. Treasury and American real estate developers, all of 
whom are finding it more difficult to attract Japanese money. 
</P>
<P>
"You are already seeing a notable reduction in syndicated loans" by Japanese 
banks, said Courtis of Deutsche Bank. "This is bad news for the U.S. Foreigners 
aren't going to buy large quantities of U.S. debt." 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. companies hope that their Japanese manufacturing rivals, now saddled 
with higher capital costs, will also be hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The higher capital costs may eventually force Japanese firms to scale back 
somewhat on investment and research plans. The days are over when they could 
issue convertible bonds paying interest rates as low as 2% by including options 
to buy shares at a later 
</P>
<P>
date. 
</P>
<P>
But even without the advantage of cheap capital, such industrial powerhouses as 
Hitachi and Toyota are likely to remain strong. Heavy investment in factories 
in recent years has boosted productivity at most leading Japanese companies far 
above that of their U.S. competitors, while strong research spending has helped 
Japan generate more patents than its strongest U.S. rivals. 
</P>
<P>
The balance sheets of Japanese companies are also stronger. The 1,493 companies 
listed on Japan's stock exchange had $512 billion in cash at the end of March, 
according to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun. Ratios measuring their debt levels, 
which were twice as high as those of their U.S. counterparts in 1975, are now 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
Even companies with poor earnings can avoid dealing with high interest rates 
and still keep capital spending strong by turning to their cash hoard. Isuzu 
Motor, for example, says it will finance at least half of the $300 million 
required next year to modernize its truck factory by using cash on hand. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller Japanese companies will feel a credit pinch. Bankers predict a sharp 
increase in bankruptcies among smaller companies over the next four months if 
interest rates remain high. 
</P>
<P>
Over the long haul, the rise in capital costs could lead to consolidation in 
Japanese industry, with Japan's strongest companies swallowing weaker 
companies. Already, Japanese firms have shed cultural taboos that once 
discouraged takeovers. Japanese companies acquired 328 foreign firms and 217 
Japanese firms in the year ended March 31, a 16% increase over the year before. 
</P>
<P>
In an environment where capital is scarce, large companies capable of 
generating cash flow through steady exports could prove themselves 
well-positioned to acquire weaker companies. This could leave the largest of 
Japan's industrial giants larger and stronger than ever.

INDUSTRY-BACKED MEASURE BATTLES ENVIRONMENTALISTS TO SHAPE FORESTS

<TEXT>
<P>
In the midst of a bitter fight between environmentalists and the timber 
industry, California voters will decide the fate this fall of the last redwood 
forests remaining in private hands. 
</P>
<P>
For environmentalists, the Nov. 6 election offers the chance to save the 
ancient redwoods. For the state's major timber companies, the ballot provides 
the best hope of preserving their industry and maintaining their historic 
control over logging operations. 
</P>
<P>
There are three initiatives on the November ballot that would change the rules 
for timber harvesting and authorize hundreds of millions of dollars in bonds to 
acquire forests or plant trees. 
</P>
<P>
But beneath the apparent similarity of the propositions, environmentalists and 
the timber industry are vying to take advantage of increasing public concern 
over the destruction of California's forests. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the measures, Propositions 128 and 130, were written by 
environmentalists to ban the practice of clear-cutting, in which loggers cut 
down all the trees in an area of the forest. In place of clear-cutting, both 
initiatives would require timber companies to log selectively, leaving behind 
trees of all ages and sizes. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 138 was drafted by the timber industry in a bid to capture more 
votes and invalidate the two environmentalist initiatives. It also calls for a 
ban on clear-cutting but contains several loopholes, including one that would 
allow loggers to leave as few as five trees per acre, industry experts concede. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing that the environmentalists' proposals would put some companies out of 
business, the timber industry is spending millions to improve its image and 
persuade voters it can responsibly protect the state's forests. 
</P>
<P>
"The forest products industry as a whole is just now becoming aware that the 
perceptions the public holds are harsher than they realized," said Bernie Bush, 
a timber industry forester and spokesman for the Proposition 138 campaign. "We 
feel the forest ecosystem is being managed very well. We have been hesitant to 
give credibility to the fact that the public doesn't agree." 
</P>
<P>
The timber industry has been widely criticized for cutting down the state's 
forests at too rapid a pace, particularly the huge redwood trees of coastal 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists contend that the industry is contributing to the problem of 
global warming by harvesting forests faster than trees can grow to replace 
them. In addition, critics say clear-cutting of the forests is jeopardizing 
wildlife, including such species as the endangered spotted owl that lives among 
the ancient redwoods. 
</P>
<P>
"Old-growth forests are disappearing rapidly," said Tom Lippe, an 
environmentalist attorney who helped draft Proposition 130. "All of (the 
old-growth redwoods) on private lands are scheduled to be harvested in the next 
10 to 15 years. This is the last chance Californians have to protect what's 
left of the ancient forests." 
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists' ballot drive to save the redwoods began with Proposition 
128, the sweeping measure called "Big Green" by its supporters. Among other 
things, the initiative would ban the practice of clear-cutting and require 
loggers to use the "selection method" when harvesting redwoods, leaving behind 
trees of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
Big Green also would provide $300 million in bonds for the purchase of redwood 
forests and for urban tree planting. The measure would impose a one-year 
moratorium on redwood harvesting to allow the state to purchase some of the 
oldest stands of redwood. 
</P>
<P>
But the Big Green initiative is modest in its approach compared with 
Proposition 130 -- a separate measure by environmentalists who wanted to go 
further and fundamentally change the way the timber industry operates. 
</P>
<P>
Called "Forests Forever" by its backers, it would ban clear-cutting and require 
the selection method of logging for all species of tree. It also would prohibit 
loggers from taking more than 60% of the timber volume of the forest in a given 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of Proposition 130 argue that their measure would restore a proper 
balance to California's forests by requiring a system of "all-age" management 
in which trees of various ages are left standing. Allowing the forests to 
regenerate in this fashion, sponsors say, actually would help timber companies 
by assuring a supply of lumber that would last indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
"Proposition 130 will require timber companies to harvest timber on a sustained 
yield basis so we will end the boom-and-bust cycle that has plagued the timber 
companies for the last century," Lippe said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it would impose a variety of new restrictions on logging 
operations, including prohibiting the use of tractors on steeper slopes and 
protecting air quality by discouraging the routine burning of debris from 
logging. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Proposition 130 attempts to reshape the state Board of Forestry by 
requiring the appointment of environmentalists to a panel long dominated by the 
timber industry. 
</P>
<P>
And the measure would authorize $742 million in bonds -- $710 million for the 
purchase of prime forest land and $32 million for the retraining of loggers who 
lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The timber industry also has cast its initiative as an environmental measure, 
calling Proposition 138 "The Global Warming and Clear Cutting Reduction, 
Wildlife Protection &amp; Reforestation Act of 1990." 
</P>
<P>
David Fogarty, a spokesman for the Proposition 138 campaign, said the measure's 
restrictions on logging will reduce the timber harvest by 15%. Timber companies 
also would be required to prepare more detailed reviews of wildlife in areas to 
be logged, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very tough measure," Fogarty said. "We think it does a good job of 
balancing the human concerns with the economic concerns of protecting our 
forests." 
</P>
<P>
But the measure also would offer the industry some relief from regulations now 
in effect. 
</P>
<P>
One provision of Proposition 138 would reduce the state's long-term control 
over the industry by allowing large landholders to harvest trees under "timber 
management plans" that would be good indefinitely. Under current rules, timber 
companies must follow "timber harvest plans" that expire within three years. 
</P>
<P>
Companies that operate under the new timber management plans would be exempt 
from preparing environmental impact reports. The state would have 60 days to 
reject a proposed timber management plan; otherwise it would take effect 
automatically. 
</P>
<P>
Although the proposition provides no money for the purchase of forest land, it 
also would prohibit the state from buying any redwood forest land unless the 
owner agrees to sell. Proposition 138 would authorize $300 million in bonds 
solely for reforestation, including $120 million to help small-scale landowners 
improve their timber production. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 138's most controversial element, however, is the provision that 
bans clear-cutting in redwood forests and requires a 50% reduction in 
clear-cutting of other types of trees. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Remcho, an attorney for the industry, acknowledged that the language of 
the ban contains "ambiguities" and "drafting errors." Critics charge that the 
clear-cutting provision amounts to no ban at all. 
</P>
<P>
For example, under one section of the initiative, companies that operate under 
the old "timber harvest plans" would be prohibited from clear-cutting redwoods. 
But under another provision, all major timber companies operating under the new 
"timber management plans" would be exempt from the ban. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, opponents say the clear-cutting ban is so loosely worded that 
foresters could leave as few as one tree per acre when logging a forest of 
old-growth redwood. Bush, the industry forester, said such claims are "total 
nonsense." The ban would require loggers to leave at least five trees per acre, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the number of trees remaining, however, loggers could come back under 
their timber harvest plan and take all the trees within a three-year period, 
acknowledged Bush, a former president of the California Licensed Foresters 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Or, because the harvested area would no longer be considered an old-growth 
forest, loggers conceivably could come back within days under a new harvest 
plan and take the remaining trees, opponents say. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Bush insisted that Proposition 138 does prohibit clear-cutting 
and was not drafted to allow the industry to skirt the ban. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was a loophole, it was unintentional and it will be plugged," said 
Bush, a forester for the Simpson Timber Co. "To suggest there is anything 
created there to let you get around the clear-cutting ban is ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
Bush defended the practice of clear-cutting as a valuable method of logging 
that better approximates the natural growth of forests. Without the 
interference of humans, he said, forests tend to grow in sections of trees that 
are the same age. 
</P>
<P>
"Clear-cutting does more to mimic nature than the all-age method (of logging)," 
he said. "Clear-cutting is a silvicultural practice that certainly has a place 
in forest management." 
</P>
<P>
Bush also insisted that the timber industry has successfully managed 
California's forests to increase the redwood range and protect wildlife. 
Although the spotted owl has been listed by the federal government as 
endangered, Bush said the bird actually is thriving as a result of proper 
management of the forests. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of ancient redwoods is actually increasing," Bush said. "The 
spotted owl is neither threatened nor endangered." 
</P>
<P>
If all three ballot measures pass, it is likely to touch off a prolonged legal 
dispute over which provisions should take effect. 
</P>
<P>
Under the California Constitution, the initiative that receives the most votes 
prevails wherever it conflicts with other propositions that pass with fewer 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say their initiatives are compatible with each other and 
would not come into conflict if both are approved. But if Proposition 138 
receives the most votes, industry spokesmen say their measure would wipe out 
the Forests Forever initiative and the forest section of Big Green. 
</P>
<P>
Propositions 128 and 130 have the backing of the Sierra Club, the League of 
Conservation Voters, the California Teachers Assn., the California Democratic 
Party and a variety of other groups. In addition, Proposition 128, the Big 
Green initiative, has the backing of Campaign California, the Natural Resources 
Defense Council and has received substantial financial support from members of 
the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 130, the Forests Forever measure, also is endorsed by the 
California State Park Rangers Assn., the National Audubon Society and the 
National Wildlife Federation and has received much of its financial backing 
from millionaire investment manager Hal Arbit. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 138 has the support of most of the state's major timber companies, 
including Louisiana-Pacific Corp., Pacific Lumber Co., Simpson Timber Co. and 
Georgia-Pacific Corp. It also has the backing of the Board of Forestry, the 
California Professional Firefighters, the California Chamber of Commerce, the 
California School Boards Assn. and the California State Federation of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
To a large degree, Proposition 130 was sparked by the accelerated logging of 
Pacific Lumber after it was acquired by Maxxam Group Inc. in a highly leveraged 
junk bond deal in 1985. Pacific Lumber spokesmen refused to discuss the forest 
initiatives or the company's involvement in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The timber industry is devoting most of its energy to defeating Proposition 
130, which it contends would put some companies out of business and drive up 
consumer prices. 
</P>
<P>
Bud McCrary, an owner of Big Creek Lumber in Santa Cruz County, has long been 
praised by environmentalists for his selective logging methods. But he said the 
Forests Forever initiative would force him to shut down because it is too 
restrictive. In particular, he said, a prohibition on the use of tractors on 
slopes over 50% would make it impossible to log much of his land. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the last of the small companies and they're going to wipe us out with 
this," said McCrary, who for years has led Sierra Club hikes in the woods. 
</P>
<P>
He also contends that the 60% limit on the volume of timber harvested is so low 
he would not be able to clear enough trees to let sunlight reach the forest 
floor and help new redwoods sprout. 
</P>
<P>
But Gail Lucas, a Sierra Club leader and a backer of the initiative, said 
McCrary is misreading the initiative and insisted it would not put him out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 130 would permit him to clear sufficient space in the forest for 
new redwoods to grow, she said. Furthermore, the reconstituted Board of 
Forestry would have the power to draft regulations implementing the proposition 
and ensuring that provisions such as the limits on tractor logging are not 
unfairly restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of Forests Forever have taken to the airwaves to attack the measure's 
restrictions on burning. They predict that without the ability to easily burn 
branches, chips and other waste, loggers will leave behind debris that would 
fuel catastrophic wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists, however, point out that the measure allows the controlled 
burning of logging debris if it is necessary to reduce the danger of fire. 
</P>
<P>
The industry campaign also charges that the $742-million bond in Proposition 
130 for the acquisition of forest land and the retraining of loggers is too 
costly. Opponents say the bond measure would cost the state $1.3 billion in 
principal and interest over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
They argue that their $300-million bond in Proposition 138 for reforestation is 
a worthwhile investment, even though it would cost taxpayers an estimated $535 
million over the same 20-year period. 
</P>
<P>
In another argument against the measure, Bush also maintained that Proposition 
130's reductions in logging would be bad for California wildlife, because it 
would reduce the habitat for hundreds of species that thrive in open areas 
where trees have been cut. 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to impose a single inflexible system of management on an 
incredibly diverse ecosystem in California," Bush argued. "They are ignoring 
decades of sound forest research management." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TIMBER INDUSTRY: COMPARING THE PROPOSITIONS 
</P>
<P>
 Three propositions on the Nov. 6 ballot would change the way the timber 
industry operates: Proposition 128 and Proposition 130, sponsored by 
environmentalists, and Proposition 138, sponsored by the timber industry to 
cancel out the other two measures. These are the key forest provisions of the 
three initiatives: 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSITION 128 
</P>
<P>
Would ban clear-cutting of redwoods. 
</P>
<P>
Would impose a one-year moratorium on cutting of redwoods to give the state 
time to purchase ancient forests. 
</P>
<P>
Would require loggers to use the selection method when logging redwoods and 
leave trees of all ages standing. 
</P>
<P>
Would authorize $300 million in bonds, including $200 million for purchase of 
redwood forests and $100 million for tree planting. 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSITION 130 
</P>
<P>
Would ban clear-cutting in all California forests. 
</P>
<P>
Would prohibit logging companies from taking more than 60% of total timber 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
Would require loggers to use the selection method when logging any forest and 
require loggers to leave trees of all ages standing. 
</P>
<P>
Would change the composition of the state Board of Forestry to reduce industry 
influence and add environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Would restrict logging near streams and lakes. 
</P>
<P>
Would restrict the use of tractors in logging on steeper slopes. 
</P>
<P>
Would restrict the controlled burning of debris from logging. 
</P>
<P>
Would restrict the export of logs to mills in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Would authorize $742 million in bonds, including $710 million for purchase of 
redwoods and $32 million for retraining loggers. 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSITION 138 
</P>
<P>
Would ban clear-cutting of redwoods in name, but leaves various loopholes 
allowing loggers to take all or most trees in a given area. 
</P>
<P>
Would allow major timber companies to harvest under timber management plans 
that cover unlimited acreage and are valid indefinitely.

Jim Roberts, a gruff-talking engineer who is happiest poring over bridge 
designs and calculating stress and load factors, has been thrust by the Loma 
Prieta earthquake into the unlikely role of an international celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Oct. 17, 1989, collapse of the upper deck of Oakland's Nimitz 
Freeway, engineers and seismic experts from Soviet Armenia, Japan, France, 
Italy, Australia and New Zealand have made pilgrimages to California to trade 
information with Roberts and his engineering team in the structures division of 
the California Department of Transportation on their favorite topic -- seismic 
retrofitting of highway bridges. 
</P>
<P>
An appreciation of the subject may elude most people, but in earthquake 
engineering circles California offers the latest in the design of seismic 
safety devices for existing bridges. 
</P>
<P>
In the year since the Loma Prieta temblor showed California that its bridges 
were not earthquake-proof, Caltrans has embarked on a seismic safety program 
for bridges unparalleled in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Shaken out of what officials admit was complacency, state officials have 
approved more than $50 million for seismic bridge projects -- roughly the same 
amount they spent on seismic safety in the previous 17 years. The Legislature 
has demanded that every bridge, freeway connector, overpass or other type of 
elevated road structure in California be examined for earthquake vulnerability. 
It has mandated that any roadway deemed a possible earthquake risk be placed on 
a priority list for seismic retrofitting and that all of it be completed by 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Caltrans has identified 6,862 state bridges as potential candidates for 
seismic retrofitting. Officials believe that further analysis will pare down 
the list to about 4,800. Another 6,792 locally maintained bridges are expected 
to be added to the retrofit program. Before it is over, officials estimate that 
the retrofitting may cost between $1 billion and $2 billion, a far cry from 
their original guesses of between $300 million and $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a mandated crash program and right in the middle of that mandated 
crash program we are developing, experimenting with, learning and applying 
stuff that hasn't been done any place in the world," said Caltrans Director 
Robert K. Best. "We're doing things here in California during the last year 
that have never been done any place in terms of earthquake research and 
evaluation." 
</P>
<P>
In the 15 seconds that the Loma Prieta earthquake shook Northern California, it 
did more to change Caltrans than any single event. The collapse of a milelong 
stretch of the Cypress viaduct section of the Nimitz killed 42 people and 
exposed critical flaws in a seismic retrofitting program that had been 
considered a national model. 
</P>
<P>
George Housner, a retired Caltech professor who headed a board of inquiry 
appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian to investigate the collapse, said the 
disaster showed that seismic retrofitting could no longer be treated as an 
afterthought in the transportation budget-making process or permitted to 
proceed at a snail's pace. Nor, he said, could engineers use past experience as 
their sole guide for designing seismic protections for bridges. 
</P>
<P>
"If you put it (the Nimitz collapse) in the context of the total deaths and 
injuries that occurred in transportation-related accidents in California every 
year, it looks pretty small," said Best. "But it's a single, very spectacular 
event and because of that it has created a dedication both with the department 
and with the policy-makers of state government that we're going to make damn 
sure it doesn't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
From its inception 17 years ago, the retrofitting program has been driven by 
earthquakes. Each time a temblor strikes California and cripples highway 
bridges, engineers rush in to assess the cause of the damage and develop 
techniques for strengthening similar structures. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1971 Sylmar quake collapsed part of the I-5 and I-210 interchange, 
Caltrans launched a retrofitting program of reinforcing bridge spans by tying 
roadway sections together and mooring them to support columns to prevent 
slipping during intense shaking. After the October, 1987, Whittier quake, 
Caltrans turned its attention to the columns that support bridge decks and 
began designing ways that they could be buttressed to prevent crumbling under 
extraordinary stress. 
</P>
<P>
The two quakes together only caused two highway deaths, and seismic 
retrofitting took a back seat to other road programs in the budget-making 
process. 
</P>
<P>
"When the 1971 and the 1987 quakes occurred there was tremendous focus and 
rhetoric and a lot of promises immediately after the quakes, but as time went 
on seismic upgrading became less and less of a priority," said Assembly 
Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar). 
</P>
<P>
Housner credits Roberts' engineers for always being "willing to do a good job," 
but said that in the past they were often "cut back because somebody else felt 
they had more urgent need for the money." 
</P>
<P>
Then came the Loma Prieta earthquake and the death toll was not two but 44, the 
Bay Area highway damage not a few million but nearly $1 billion. Within weeks, 
the Legislature elevated the seismic retrofitting program to top priority in 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
"As of right now, the environment has changed definitely because we now have a 
law that essentially says earthquake retrofit is the No. 1 priority for the 
expenditure of funds in the state," said Best. 
</P>
<P>
Housner said the new funding priority forced the department practically 
overnight to change its fundamental mind-set. Expanding highway capacity became 
secondary to ensuring the safety of those that existed. 
</P>
<P>
"California has always been sort of a leader in earthquake engineering but 
Caltrans has just sort of put the blinders on," said Housner. "(Caltrans) had 
such a big building program they were turning out a bridge a day for years. 
Their main thought was how to build bridges efficiently and rapidly. 
Retrofitting was a low priority." 
</P>
<P>
After Housner's committee issued its recommendations it was determined that 
Caltrans would not only have to develop techniques to protect bridges from the 
type of damage created by the Loma Prieta quake, but it would have to predict 
what might happen to bridges in future quakes. 
</P>
<P>
With supercomputers and new techniques, Best said, the department could 
simulate different kinds of quakes and determine how individual structures 
would react to them. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that's a tremendous advancement away from the days of saying, 'Well, we 
saw this happen, now how can we stop that from recurring?' to sitting back and 
predicting things that we've never seen before and then designing ways to stop 
them from happening," Best said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the department is aiming at a retrofitting standard that would set the 
survival probability at 99.99%. 
</P>
<P>
"You talk about change," Best said. "We are so far ahead of almost everybody 
else in terms of seismic design and retrofitting of transportation structures 
that there is nobody to turn to. We're just developing everything as we're 
going along." 
</P>
<P>
Before the quake the department retrofit program employed just a few engineers 
and contractors; now at least 500 people work in one aspect or another of 
seismic retrofitting. Because of the retrofitting and accelerated highway 
construction programs, each year Caltrans is recruiting and hiring one-third of 
all civil engineering graduates in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
To assist in the development of techniques for retrofitting bridges, it has 
awarded nearly $8 million in research contracts in the last year to the 
University of California campuses at Irvine, San Diego, Berkeley and Davis; 
USC, the University of Nevada at Reno and two private consulting firms. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I think will make a big difference in the future is that they now 
are appointing some earthquake advisory committees that include outside 
experts," said Housner. "Before they were sort of inbred. They were not asking 
for any comments from outside so they fell behind on some of the earthquake 
engineering part of it." 
</P>
<P>
California's crash program is not without its potential aftershocks. State 
government has only begun to pay the bill for the massive retrofitting 
projects. The engineering and design work of the early months was relatively 
inexpensive; the real costs will come in a few years when some of the bigger 
projects get under way. 
</P>
<P>
"As you go on you start spending more and more money. That will be the test. 
Whether in a couple of years from now as the bills begin to mount it is still a 
crash program, full speed ahead, costs be damned, or whether the program is 
leveled out and those funds are distributed over more years," Best said. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, $80 million from a temporary quarter-cent sales tax was earmarked 
for bridge retrofitting. The state Department of Finance has indicated that 
another $300 million from the special sales tax may also be slated for 
earthquake retrofit work. The Federal Highway Administration has made funds 
available for the replacement of structures damaged or destroyed by the quake 
but has ruled that other retrofit programs are not eligible for federal 
disaster relief funds. 
</P>
<P>
Once the initial funding is used up, Katz said, the department will have to 
begin using money from a gasoline tax increase that was approved by voters in 
June. Although it was originally determined that some revenue from the tax 
increase would be used for seismic work, it was never contemplated that the 
"final price tag" would be over $1 billion, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Katz recently held a legislative hearing to examine the costs of the 
retrofitting program. He said the purpose of the hearing was twofold. He wanted 
to put Caltrans on notice that lawmakers were not going to back off from their 
decision to make seismic retrofitting the agency's top priority. At the same 
time, he said, he wanted it known that they would be watching expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of our purpose was to let Caltrans know we're not going away," said Katz. 
"The commitment I made was that seismic retrofitting is going to be high 
priority. I will honor that commitment even if it means some new project for 
new capacity is delayed. We have an obligation to make the existing roadways 
safe before we build new roadways."

SURROGATE PARENT TRIAL NEARS END; JUDGE IS LIKENED TO SOLOMON

<P>
In an emotional summation of a groundbreaking test-tube baby case, the lawyer 
for surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson likened the judge to King Solomon 
Wednesday and warned that denying Johnson parental rights is tantamount to 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Richard C. Gilbert urged Orange County Superior Court Judge Richard N. 
Parslow Jr. to establish a principle never before recognized in the law: That a 
woman who gives birth to a child made from another couple's sperm and egg is as 
much the mother as the genetic parents. 
</P>
<P>
"You are looking reality straight in the face and you see three parents," 
Gilbert told the judge. "The question is, 'Will you blink and turn your head?' 
Would King Solomon solve a three-parent problem by assassinating one of the 
parents? You have no right to play God." 
</P>
<P>
Closing his remarks, Gilbert again referred to Solomon -- a king of Israel 
whose wisdom was documented in the Old Testament -- who determined which of two 
women was a baby's true mother by threatening to cut the child in half. 
</P>
<P>
"And so, King Solomon, what will it be?" Gilbert asked. "I give you three 
parents and a gun. Tell us your wisdom." 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm being asked to split the baby," Parslow replied. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he will rule Monday whether Johnson, a 29-year-old single mother 
with a 3-year-old daughter, has parental rights to the child she bore Sept. 19 
for an infertile couple, Mark and Crispina Calvert. He must decide whether the 
baby boy has two parents -- the Calverts -- or three, including Johnson. 
Johnson is the first surrogate mother to seek parental rights to a child that 
is genetically unrelated to her. 
</P>
<P>
The Calverts have temporary custody of the child, and Johnson is permitted to 
visit twice a week. If Johnson is found to be a legal parent, however, Parslow 
will hold a separate hearing to determine whether she is entitled to custody or 
permanent visitation rights. 
</P>
<P>
The judge could also rule that although Johnson cannot be considered a legal 
parent, she has a lesser right that entitles her to participate in the child's 
life. Such rights are frequently assigned to foster parents, grandparents or 
stepparents who can establish an interest in a child's life. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert argued that it does not matter how a woman becomes pregnant or whose 
genetic material composes the embryo. The act of giving birth and the 
inevitable bond a woman makes to the fetus confers the rights of a mother, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Genetics means crap in determining parental rights," Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Calverts' lawyer, Christian R. Van Deusen, took the opposite view, 
saying a couple's sperm and egg are "the most precious thing they have . . . 
their genetic heritage." He said Johnson was trying to steal the Calverts' 
child, and that permitting it would be against public policy. 
</P>
<P>
"If the court were to endorse the conduct of Anna Johnson and the deception she 
has worked on these people, it would open the doors to exploitation of every 
infertile couple that comes down the way seeking to have a child by in-vitro 
fertilization," Van Deusen said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Deusen said the validity of the $10,000 surrogate contract signed by all 
three parties must be upheld. If men are permitted to sell their semen and 
people to sell their blood, a woman must have the right to choose to let 
another couple's child grow in her uterus, Van Deusen said. 
</P>
<P>
Harold F. LaFlamme, a court-appointed lawyer for the baby, said California law 
does not give Johnson parental rights. 
</P>
<P>
Although one portion of the state civil code says a birth mother shall be 
presumed to be a baby's natural parent -- a section Johnson's lawyers have 
repeatedly cited -- another allows a woman to bring a court action to determine 
a mother-child relationship, LaFlamme said. That shows that the framers of the 
law knew that birth alone does not necessarily prove motherhood, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Simply carrying the baby isn't enough to confer parental rights," LaFlamme 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If parentage is unresolved, the civil code dictates that blood tests provide 
the conclusive answer, and in that case, Johnson has no claim to parentage 
because she has no genetic relationship to the baby, he said. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves her with only one other argument, which is the bond she claims to 
have formed with the child, LaFlamme said. That assertion is suspect because 
she has made contradictory claims to others and "suppressed vital information" 
from the Calverts to make certain they used her as a surrogate, LaFlamme said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Deusen also attacked Johnson's claim of developing a bond with the baby, 
saying she has no sincere interest in raising the child and was pressing her 
lawsuit for national attention as well as a chance to make money off a possible 
book or movie deal. Johnson has said she has made no such arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE SURROGATE MOTHER SUIT 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Superior Court Judge Richard N. Parslow Jr. is expected to announce 
if surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson should be considered a legal parent of a 
child she bore Sept. 19 even though he is genetically unrelated. Johnson agreed 
to have a child made from the sperm and egg of an infertile couple, Mark and 
Crispina Calvert. But on Aug. 13, she filed suit seeking custody and parental 
rights over the boy. The Calverts have temporary custody. The case is 
unprecedented because other surrogate mothers suing to keep their children have 
been genetically related to their babies. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's claim: 
</P>
<P>
She contends that carrying and delivering the child, combined with the 
emotional bond she formed with the baby in utero, make her a legal parent of 
the infant. Johnson argues that the Calverts broke the $10,000 surrogation 
contract by paying her late, failing to buy her life insurance and neglecting 
her medical needs during the pregnancy. Her attorney contends that the contract 
is illegal because it amounts to baby-selling. 
</P>
<P>
The Calverts' claim: 
</P>
<P>
The Calverts contend that their genetic link to the child makes them the baby's 
only legal parents. They question the emotional bond Johnson claims to have 
with the infant, saying her custody battle is motivated by a desire for money 
and publicity. The couple say Johnson exploited them for money and duped them 
into the surrogation contract by withholding important information from them.

PLAN TO LIFT ANGOLA SECRECY VEIL REJECTED; 
</P>
<P>
AFRICA: THE HOUSE SAYS NO TO DELLUMS AMENDMENT TO BRING COVERT U.S. MILITARY 
AID INTO THE OPEN.

<P>
The House on Wednesday rejected a Democratic-led effort to bring covert 
military aid to Angola into the open, amid complaints that the funds would be 
halted altogether if whites, rather than blacks, were being wounded and killed 
in the African civil war. 
</P>
<P>
House members voted 246 to 175 to defeat a proposal by California Rep. Ronald 
V. Dellums (D-Berkeley) that would have lifted the veil of secrecy surrounding 
the Angola aid program. Voting with Dellums were 170 Democrats and four 
Republicans, while 168 Republicans and 78 Democrats voted against the proposed 
amendment to the House intelligence authorization bill for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Approved by a voice vote late Wednesday, the $29-billion funding measure now 
goes to a House-Senate conference to iron out differences. 
</P>
<P>
A similar anti-secrecy amendment was defeated four years ago by about the same 
margin, suggesting that the end of the Cold War has done little to change 
fundamental views in the House on the Angolan conflict. Moscow has been backing 
Angola's government for 15 years, while Washington has supported the rebels for 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
Dellums' amendment was viewed as an effort not only to bring the Angolan aid 
program "out of the closet" for open debate and decision, but also as an 
attempt to kill the aid program, reported to total $60 million this year. The 
actual funding amount was not discussed in open floor debate. 
</P>
<P>
Some influential Democrats, such as former House Intelligence Committee 
Chairman Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), endorsed the anti-secrecy amendment while 
supporting continued aid for the rebels. He noted that the Angolan government 
has a huge stockpile of Soviet arms and continues to dodge efforts to reach a 
cease-fire and schedule free elections. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of continued Angolan aid argued that, in the words of one lawmaker, 
"now is not the time" to cut off aid, citing the ongoing Cuban withdrawal from 
Angola. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois Rep. Henry J. Hyde, who led Republicans opposing the amendment, said 
Soviet military aid to Angola remains substantial. Soviet assistance totaled 
$800 million last year and has topped $500 million so far this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dellums and California Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton), his amendment 
co-sponsor, focused on the civil war's human toll. About 341,000 people have 
died or been wounded, Dellums said, including 55,000 children. 
</P>
<P>
"Funding for the rebels is a Cold War anachronism," declared Dellums, who grew 
angry when he said he saw Republicans smiling at his pleas to "save the 
children." 
</P>
<P>
"This is no laughing matter," he chided. "Putting on my other hat as head of 
the (Congressional) Black Caucus, let me say that we would not tolerate this" 
if white children were dying. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally echoed this view. "If you are an Afro-American, you look around the 
world with (leaders) shuttling back and forth to bring peace to Europe, peace 
to Asia, peace to Latin America, but not to Africa, (although) thousands of 
Africans are dying and being maimed" in Angola, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another amendment that would halt aid to Angola if President Bush certifies 
that the Angolan government had made satisfactory progress toward a peaceful 
resolution was approved 213 to 200. 
</P>
<P>
The Angola debate came as the House considered a measure said to authorize $29 
billion for all intelligence activities in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. 
The bill's most controversial provisions involve Administration requests for 
$300 million in covert military aid for Afghanistan, $60 million for Angola and 
$12 million for Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate has approved a measure containing $200 million in covert funds for 
Afghanistan and none for Cambodia, while allowing the full $60 million for 
Angola.

CO-AUTHOR OF RADICAL SOVIET ECONOMIC PLAN QUITS IN PROTEST

The co-author of the radical "500-Day Plan" for a transition to a market 
economy in the Soviet Union resigned in protest Wednesday because President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev has decided to implement a more conservative plan. 
</P>
<P>
The official Soviet news agency Tass said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Grigory 
Yavlinsky announced his resignation to a joint session of the Russian 
Federation Parliament, saying it is unrealistic to expect the 500-day program 
to be implemented when Gorbachev and the central government do not support it. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who had earlier voiced support for the 500-Day Plan, submitted a 
compromise proposal to Soviet lawmakers Tuesday that maintains many of the 
conservative aspects and central controls contained in a rival plan favored by 
Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov. 
</P>
<P>
The 500-Day Plan is a blueprint for a quicker, more radical move to a market 
economy. It was drafted by a commission set up by Gorbachev and Russian 
Federation leader Boris N. Yeltsin, with economist Stanislav S. Shatalin and 
Yavlinsky its main co-authors. 
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federation Parliament has already approved the more radical plan, 
and many officials and economists have said it would be impossible to combine 
the two rival programs. Yeltsin compared the effort to "trying to mate a 
hedgehog with a snake." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, unrest in the Ukraine, the second-largest Soviet republic, forced 
the resignation of Prime Minister Vitaly A. Masol, signaling an upsurge in the 
separatist movement in the Soviet breadbasket. 
</P>
<P>
Street demonstrations, student hunger strikes and classroom boycotts also led 
the Ukrainian Parliament to embrace other radical demands, including the 
transfer of Communist Party property to the government and refusal to sign a 
new treaty of union with the Soviet central government, Tass reported. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of students in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev celebrated their 
victory by marching Wednesday evening through October Revolution Square, which 
they call Independence Square. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the few glimmers of good news for the Soviet economy in recent 
months, the government Wednesday reported a record grain crop. Officials put 
the just-completed harvest at 264 million tons, about 3 1/2 million tons more 
than the previous record in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The harvest was achieved despite bad weather and shortages of labor and 
transportation. Officials had called out students, factory workers and soldiers 
to help bring in the grain.

Fighting broke out between leftist guerrillas and government troops in San 
Salvador on Wednesday night and a series of explosions were heard in several 
sections of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Radio reports said leftist rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front were attacking the main Salvadoran air force base at Ilopango. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said a number of people were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters heard a number of loud explosions, apparently caused by bombs in the 
poor neighborhood of Soyapango on the city's east side, and in Delgado to the 
northeast. A Red Cross spokesman said in a telephone interview there was 
fighting in the city, including the southern part and that several people were 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he did not immediately know how many people were hurt, or have 
other details. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters touring the streets saw army helicopters dropping flares and firing 
with automatic weapons at suspected guerrilla positions near the air base, a 
few miles east of the capital, and at other points in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The armed forces press office said it had no immediate details. 
</P>
<P>
"We know there have been explosions, but we don't know where," a military 
spokesman, who also insisted on anonymity, said in a telephone interview.

U.N. LEADER SAYS WAR IS OPTION IN GULF;

DIPLOMACY: MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ WOULD BE 'PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE' IF 
SANCTIONS FAIL, PEREZ DE CUELLAR SAYS.

<P>
U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar said in an interview released 
Wednesday that military action against Iraq would be legitimate if economic 
sanctions do not work. 
</P>
<P>
The German weekly magazine Stern quoted him as saying that "the members of the 
U.N. Security Council will have to wait a little and see whether sanctions 
will, after all, show some effect." If they do not, military action "would be 
perfectly legitimate," should the Security Council so decide, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Perez de Cuellar added that if the world body manages to resolve the crisis, 
"we will then have to immediately make efforts concerning the Palestinian 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
The Security Council imposed a trade embargo Aug. 6 against Iraq, a few days 
after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein sent his troops into Kuwait and sent 
Kuwait's government into exile. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, it was reported Wednesday that the five permanent members of the 
Security Council were preparing to put more pressure on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the meetings told Reuters news service that a resolution was 
drafted that opens the door for nations and individuals damaged by Iraq's 
occupation of Kuwait to seek financial compensation. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which still has to be approved by the governments of the 
15-nation Security Council, would also call on Iraq to protect foreign 
nationals, including diplomats, and ensure they receive supplies of food, water 
and other basic services. 
</P>
<P>
Envoys from the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China met 
at France's U.N. mission for two days to work on the draft. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Hussein has cut off supplies to diplomatic compounds in Kuwait city. He 
contends that Kuwait is part of Iraq and therefore no longer entitled to have 
embassies. Only four Western nations are still believed to be operating 
embassies in Kuwait city: the United States, Britain, Canada and France. 
</P>
<P>
In Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, Western diplomatic sources reported Wednesday that 
three British men have escaped overland from Iraq to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said that to avoid cutting off the possible escape of others, 
they did not want to specify the lengthy route that the men took across the 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
The three arrived near the northern Saudi border town of Arar late Monday, the 
sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The men's identities were not disclosed, but the diplomats said two were 
hospital workers in Baghdad and the third a businessman and that all three left 
from the Iraqi capital. 
</P>
<P>
One diplomat said the three asked not to meet the media and would be flown back 
to Britain shortly. Three Britons and two Frenchmen escaped from Iraq by sea 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Westerners remain in occupied Kuwait and Iraq, either in hiding or 
detained by Hussein's government. Hundreds are being held as "human shields" at 
Iraqi military and other strategic installations to deter attack by the 
U.S.-led multinational force deployed against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, a German newspaper reported that an alleged spy, now 
under arrest, had given U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization secrets to 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The mass-circulation Bild Zeitung said Juergen Gietler provided Iraq with 
details of secret NATO consultations and analyses of the gulf situation, as 
well as reports by the U.S. ambassador to NATO, William Howard Taft IV. 
</P>
<P>
Gietler, 35, was arrested Aug. 28. The arrest was confirmed Oct. 3.

SUSPENDED NAVAJO LEADER, SON CONVICTED IN CORRUPTION CASE

Suspended Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald was convicted Wednesday on 41 counts 
of bribery and other crimes for taking money and favors from people doing 
business on the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
The same six-member tribal District Court jury convicted Peter (Rocky) 
MacDonald Jr., MacDonald's son and co-defendant, on 23 similar counts. 
</P>
<P>
The elder MacDonald could be sent to prison for as long as 21 1/2 years and be 
fined up to $21,500. The conviction bars him from holding tribal office for 
four years. His name is on the Nov. 6 ballot for tribe president, a post that 
replaced the office of chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution contended that MacDonald illegally asked for and accepted cash 
payments, loans, airplane rides and the use of an automobile from businessmen 
seeking to curry favor. The defense claimed in closing arguments that he 
received the gifts through friendship and that he neither threatened the 
business people nor promised them anything in return. 
</P>
<P>
This was the first of three trials that the suspended chairman faces in tribal 
court. MacDonald's and his son's second trial is scheduled to begin on Tuesday. 
They face conspiracy charges related to the tribe's purchase of a ranch for 
$33.4 million from a company that had paid $26.2 million for the property five 
minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The third trial, in which MacDonald faces 93 fraud counts related to the 
tribe's 1986 primary and general elections, is scheduled to begin Dec. 4. 
Suspended Vice Chairman Johnny R. Thompson is a co-defendant.

HOUSE OKS CIVIL RIGHTS BILL; VETO PLANNED; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: THE MEASURE IS DESIGNED TO FIGHT DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE. 
PRESIDENT BUSH SAYS THAT IT WOULD LEAD TO HIRING QUOTAS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The House on Wednesday approved a major civil rights bill designed to combat 
job discrimination and sent it to President Bush, who promised a veto on 
grounds that it would lead to hiring quotas. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that President Bush will reconsider the unwise and unjustified course 
he is on," Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said following House approval of 
the bill, 273 to 154. 
</P>
<P>
The margin was 12 votes short of the two-thirds needed to override a veto and 
pass the bill over the President's objections. Thirty-four Republicans and 239 
Democrats voted for the bill, while 15 Democrats and 139 Republicans were 
opposed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite months of efforts to forge a compromise, civil rights forces succeeded 
in gaining just one vote beyond their total on Aug. 3, when the House passed an 
earlier version, 272 to 154. 
</P>
<P>
"We're somewhat disappointed because we had hoped that the additional 
compromises that were made since the vote last time would have picked up some 
votes," said William Taylor, a longtime Washington civil rights advocate. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate on Tuesday approved the bill but also fell short of the support 
needed to override a veto. Somber civil rights forces planned a final campaign 
to persuade Bush to relent and sign the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"Give us these measly crumbs from the table," Rep. Craig Washington (D-Tex.) 
said as the House debated the measure, which had been nine months in the making 
and softened repeatedly in efforts to woo Bush's support. 
</P>
<P>
The bill represents the civil rights movement's top priority on Capitol Hill 
this year. It would overturn six decisions on job discrimination that created a 
furor when the Supreme Court handed them down last year. 
</P>
<P>
Provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the workplace to punitive 
damages in extreme discrimination cases. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest controversy, however, came over complex changes in rules on how 
job discrimination cases are decided. They would make it easier for minorities 
filing suit to win and harder for employers to defend themselves. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush said in a letter delivered to Capitol Hill on Tuesday that the 
changes would "have the effect of forcing businesses to adopt quotas in hiring 
and promotion." He said that if the bill reached his desk, he would "be 
compelled to veto it." 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday morning that Bush 
planned to veto the measure and send it back to lawmakers with an alternative 
version attached. Civil rights leaders, however, have been saying the chances 
of passing an alternative this year are virtually nil. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, they had been holding out hope that Bush would relent and 
sign the bill. After weighing Tuesday's missive from the President, however, 
civil rights leaders sharpened their rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
"His announced intention to veto the Civil Rights Act of 1990 shows that on 
issues of race and sex discrimination, George Bush is a Ronald Reagan in 
sheep's clothing," said Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership 
Conference on Civil Rights. 
</P>
<P>
"While his style and rhetoric may differ, his substantive civil rights policies 
are just as deadly to those who are victims of job discrimination," Neas said. 
"Indeed, with respect to key parts of the Civil Rights Act of 1990, President 
Bush's positions are even more extreme than Ronald Reagan's. 
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, President Bush has capitulated to the right wing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing in the bill that would require employers to hire by quota. In 
fact, the measure contains a disclaimer specifically saying that it would not 
"encourage" the use of quotas. 
</P>
<P>
Business groups and Bush Administration officials say, however, that the bill 
would make employers so vulnerable to discrimination suits that they would turn 
to quotas to provide themselves with a ready-made defense in case they were 
taken to court.

THREE SENATORS' KEATING TALKS HELD EXTENSIVE

Three senators under investigation for their ties to Charles H. Keating Jr., 
ex-owner of the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, had more extensive dealings 
with him than they acknowledged publicly, Senate documents show. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Ethics Committee documents detail efforts made by Democratic Sens. 
Alan Cranston of California, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Donald W. Riegle 
Jr. of Michigan on Keating's behalf. They also shed new light on some of 
Keating's fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's special counsel has recommended the probe of those three be 
intensified. He also proposed the investigation be dropped against Sens. John 
McCain (R-Ariz.) and John Glenn (D-Ohio), the other members of the so-called 
"Keating Five." 
</P>
<P>
The documents, obtained by the Associated Press, show: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Keating's fund-raising efforts for Riegle were far more extensive than 
previously known, and some information in the documents do not match Riegle's 
account in statements to the public and the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cranston, in a memo, thanked Keating for a $250,000 contribution solicited 
by the senator for a voter registration project and at the same time expressed 
his pleasure that Keating met with the top thrift regulator to air his 
complaints about an examination of his S&amp;L, Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of 
Irvine, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 -- DeConcini assisted Keating in his crusade to have former top thrift 
regulator Edwin J. Gray -- referred to by Lincoln's owner as a "mad dog turned 
loose" -- removed from the examination of Lincoln. After Gray left office, the 
senator wrote Keating, "Maybe things will change now that he is gone. I sure 
hope so." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A former top U.S. banking regulator, Roger F. Martin, said that just weeks 
before the government seized Lincoln, he received "highly unusual" calls from 
Cranston and DeConcini at his unlisted home number urging sale of Lincoln 
rather than seizure. Cranston's call came after 10 p.m. and DeConcini's at 5:30 
a.m. the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounded to me as if they were reading from the same script or memo," Martin 
told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
It was previously known that Keating and associates gave $1.3 million to the 
campaigns and favored causes of the five senators. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston spokesman Murray Flander said Wednesday night there was no connection 
between any money raised by Cranston and actions taken with regulators by the 
senator. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is trying to determine whether there was a connection between 
help the senators gave Keating as Lincoln headed toward collapse and the money 
he gave. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln was seized by the federal government in April, 1989, at a potential 
cost to taxpayers of more than $2 billion, but Keating insisted all along he 
was treated unfairly by U.S. regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Keating has been in jail in Los Angeles since his indictment Sept. 18 on state 
securities fraud charges.

Evans, 44, was put to death 3 1/2 hours after the U.S. Supreme Court denied a

APPEALS COURT REVERSES INSURANCE RULING

A state appellate court handed California homeowners a victory Wednesday by 
overturning a lower court order that barred a Concord couple from suing their 
insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
A lower court had said that Roger and Linda Stanley waited too long to sue Fire 
Insurance Exchange Co. after it denied their claim. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's homeowner policy had a clause that said a suit must be brought 
within one year of filing a claim, but the Stanleys waited nearly 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
The 1st District Court of Appeals, in a 3-0 published decision, reversed the 
ruling by a Contra Costa County Superior Court judge, saying it was unfair 
because the insurance company took more than two years to deny the couple's 
claim. That made it impossible to comply with the one-year time limit.

<P>
GAS TAX WOULD BE USED FOR RAIL SERVICE 
</P>

<P>
In a year when several initiatives would, if adopted, bring massive complicated 
changes in state laws, Proposition 125 is narrow in its effect and to the 
point: The measure would free up gasoline tax money to improve commuter rail 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in 1974 approved the use of gas taxes for building rail lines. Now 
voters are being asked whether the gas taxes also can be used to buy rail 
passenger cars and locomotives for intercity service. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation officials say a short supply of so-called rolling stock -- 
passenger cars and locomotives -- has been a major impediment to the lengthy 
and costly process of improving commuter rail service. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds totaling $3 billion have been approved this year to enhance rail service 
in the state. Commitments also have recently been made by state authorities to 
begin extensive commuter service in and out of Los Angeles and other urban 
centers by 1993. But proponents of the measure maintain that the needs are well 
beyond what has already been provided. 
</P>
<P>
The main question surrounding Proposition 125 is whether its passage would 
substantially reduce the amount of money available to build highways -- 
currently the most extensive use of gas tax money. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent communication to its members, the Automobile Club of Southern 
California, which opposes the measure, contended that it undermines commitments 
given to voters in the Proposition 111 campaign last spring that money raised 
by increasing the gas tax would go to relieve traffic congestion and to build 
and improve highways. 
</P>
<P>
"Even after passage of Proposition 111, gas tax funds remain inadequate to 
cover the current deficiencies in our road and highway system," the Auto Club 
statement said. "By increasing the demands on gas tax funds, Proposition 125 
will make the problem worse. To fund necessary highway projects, local 
jurisdictions may be forced to turn to toll roads, resulting in a double tax 
burden on motorists." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno), sponsor of the legislation that put 
Proposition 125 on the ballot, counters that the measure "does not affect 
highway funding in any way." 
</P>
<P>
"It does not increase nor decrease the amount of fuel tax funds allocated for 
transit capital purposes by the Legislature," he said recently. "It simply 
allows more flexibility on the part of local transit agencies in making 
decisions as to what rail capital expenditures are undertaken." Currently, he 
noted, all rail capital expenditures are authorized except for rolling stock. 
Allowing money to be spent for this purpose is the only change, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the rail allocation has been only a small share of the gas tax 
revenues, this year amounting to $64 million. If there were to be more 
political support for rail construction as opposed to highways, this could 
grow. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Costa, support for the measure is coming from Cindy McKim, head of 
the rail division at Caltrans, who views it as adding needed flexibility to 
rail funding. "The bonds are a one-time-only jump-start on our rail program," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Other backers include Gerald H. Meral, executive director of the Planning and 
Conservation League, the sponsor of one of the rail bond measures approved by 
the voters in the June primary; Kirk West, president of the California Chamber 
of Commerce, and William E. Leonard, chairman of the California Transportation 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents include the chairman and immediate past chairman of the Libertarian 
Party of California, Gail Lightfoot and John Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
No major campaign expenditures are expected from either proponents or opponents 
of the measure.

COUNTRY SINGER NAOMI JUDD TO RETIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Country singer Naomi Judd announced Wednesday in Nashville that she will retire 
early next year for health reasons. The announcement signals the end of the 
Judds, the mother and daughter team that has been one of country music's most 
successful attractions since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Judd, 44, who was found to have hepatitis 10 months ago, said the retirement 
will come at the end the duo's current "Love Can Build a Bridge" tour. Wynonna, 
her 26-year-old daughter, plans to continue in country music as a solo artist. 
</P>
<P>
The Judds, who have had more than a dozen No. 1 country hits, including "Why 
Not Me" and "Grandpa (Tell Me 'Bout the Good Old Days)," have been honored by 
the Country Music Assn. as the field's best vocal group/duo for the past six 
years.

U.S. PRISONS TO STRESS LITERACY PROGRAMS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: INMATES WILL BE REQUIRED TO READ AT 12TH-GRADE LEVEL. THOSE WHO 
REJECT TRAINING WILL BE DISCIPLINED OR LOSE BENEFITS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The federal prison system, moving to reduce illiteracy in its swelling 
population, is launching an aggressive effort to raise inmates' required 
reading ability from eighth to 12th grade. 
</P>
<P>
Prisoners who refuse to take reading classes when they test below the high 
school graduate level will lose benefits inside the institutions or face 
discipline under the program announced Wednesday by Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
But Thornburgh and federal Bureau of Prisons officials stressed positive 
aspects of the effort, contending that prison literacy programs have been well 
received by both staff and prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Inmates "have readily accepted our new approach," Thornburgh said in a speech 
to an international conference on literacy and corrections in Ottawa, Canada. 
"For most who cannot read, competing in the legitimate work world is 
impossible." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "We believe there is a straight-line relationship between literacy 
levels and an individual's likelihood of involvement in substance abuse." Basic 
literacy "not only helps the prisoner after release but, equally important, 
contributes to a better life while in prison and to a safer environment for 
both staff and inmates." 
</P>
<P>
Raising the literacy standard for the nation's 58,000 federal prisoners drew a 
mixed reaction from organizations active in the literacy field. 
</P>
<P>
"One does not mandate education and literacy for adults," said Mike Fox, 
director of Push Literacy Action Now, a Washington-based group that works in 
literacy training and advocacy. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope the program is incentive-based and not punitive," said Rene 
Woodward, an associate at Southport Institute, a Connecticut-based research 
organization that sponsors the Project on Adult Literacy. "I don't know if you 
can force even children to learn." 
</P>
<P>
About 20% of all federal inmates are illiterate, Thornburgh said, using the 
standard of eighth grade as a benchmark. 
</P>
<P>
Although this rate "mirrors closely the illiteracy level of the general 
population in the United States, we in the Justice Department are not content 
to allow men and women in our custody to leave prison only meeting the general 
norm," he said. "We are committed to giving prisoners the opportunity to better 
equip themselves for positive change, if they so desire." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general said that professionals in the corrections field no longer 
subscribe to the so-called "medical model," under which prison staff members 
prescribe programs expected to cure an inmate of criminality. 
</P>
<P>
But this does not remove the need for "effective motivational components . . . 
that induce inmates to participate in what we see are critically interconnected 
life-skill programs, such as literacy and work." 
</P>
<P>
Work assignments and literacy are the only two mandatory programs in the 
federal prison system, Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
The literacy program in the Bureau of Prisons began in the early 1980s with a 
sixth-grade literacy standard, which was later raised to eighth grade. The 
standard will be raised again "very shortly." 
</P>
<P>
Failure to work toward attaining literacy could be a negative factor in 
deciding a prisoner's eligibility for moving outside prison to a half-way house 
during the last six months of his term, Gregory Bogdan, a prison bureau 
spokesman, said. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, it could result in an inmate's drawing the lowest rate of pay -- 44 
cents an hour, instead of $1.05, the top hourly rate -- for work inside the 
institution, according to Bogdan. 
</P>
<P>
The number of teachers and educational administrators in the nation's 72 
federal institutions has increased from 286 in 1986 to 559 in fiscal 1990, 
Bogdan said. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh noted that last year 10,546 inmates completed eighth-grade literacy 
requirements; 3,100 earned high school equivalency diplomas, 7,356 completed 
post-secondary education courses and more than 11,000 finished occupational 
training programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are awarding (high school equivalency) diplomas to individuals who never 
before succeeded at anything they tried," Thornburgh said. "We are graduating 
some prisoners as college-level scholars who couldn't read or write when they 
came into the institution."

EL CAMINO REAL RALLIES TO BEAT CHATSWORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Camino Real High girls' volleyball Coach Lori Chandler likens senior 
Jennifer Dinaberg to a "quiet tidal wave waiting to happen." 
</P>
<P>
"She always seems to explode at the right moment," Chandler says. 
</P>
<P>
Dinaberg picked the right moment to go off Wednesday night as El Camino Real 
came from behind to beat Chatsworth, 15-4, 11-15, 10-15, 15-13, 15-5, in a 
Northwest Valley Conference match between previously unbeaten teams. 
</P>
<P>
Dinaberg, who had a match-high 18 kills, responded with seven kills in the 
pivotal fourth game to help the Conquistadores rally from a 13-10 deficit and 
force a fifth game. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real improved to 8-0 overall and 5-0 in conference play while 
Chatsworth, which had defeated the Conquistadores in the 1989 City Section 4-A 
Division semifinals, slipped to 8-1 and 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
The teams resume their rivalry Tuesday at El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year, Chatsworth is always the biggest competition," said Dinaberg, a 
first-team All-City selection as a junior and a second-team choice as a 
sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been playing so long together that we knew we could come back. We've 
been down before and we knew we had enough." 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth's Jody Paperno, who had seven kills in the match, suffered what may 
be a fractured ankle in the fourth game with her team leading, 4-1. That proved 
to be a turning point. 
</P>
<P>
"When Jody went down that really hurt us," Chatsworth Coach Steve Berk said. 
"We lost all our momentum. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to have to regroup and come back Tuesday. It's going to be 
hard because there is no way she is going to be back by then." 
</P>
<P>
Heather Gorman led Chatsworth with 11 kills. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real had not lost a game this season, winning 21 in a row, and 
Chatsworth had lost only three heading into the match. 
</P>
<P>
The Conquistadores broke a 4-4 tie and reeled off 11 unanswered points in the 
first game to extend their streak. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the best game we've played all year and I thought we were going to roll 
along," Chandler said. "We stopped executing and started to make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real jumped to a 7-0 lead in the second game, but Chatsworth rallied 
to tie the score, 11-11, and went on to win on Marsha Gekhtman's block. 
</P>
<P>
In the third game, Chatsworth broke a 4-4 deadlock to take an 11-4 advantage. 
El Camino Real closed to 13-10, but the comeback fell short when Hellen Hong's 
shot went wide on game point. 
</P>
<P>
The match originally was scheduled for Oct. 4, but was postponed by El Camino 
Real after the match was moved to the Chatsworth girls' gym because the main 
gym floor was being resurfaced.

SPOTLIGHT

<P>
In a game dominated by big offensive plays, Rodgers' 75-yard interception 
return might have been the most entertaining touchdown in the Marauders' 43-7 
Foothill Conference victory over East Los Angeles on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The play occurred late in the fourth quarter when Antelope Valley linebacker 
Lester Larry grabbed Oscar Tavera's jersey and spun the quarterback around in 
an effort to sack him. 
</P>
<P>
Tavera tried to dumped the ball off to a teammate but hit the unsuspecting 
Rodgers instead. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers has played an instrumental role in the Marauders' season -- at 5-0-1 
the team is off to its best start since 1954 -- anchoring a defense that has 
given up 52 points in six games. He has a team-leading 11 sacks and ranks third 
with 38 unassisted and assisted tackles.

CSUN VOLLEYBALL TEAM KEPT ON ITS TOES IN HAWAII 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THERESA MUNOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hawaiian paradise has turned out to be more than a few days at the beach for 
the Cal State Northridge women's volleyball team. The Matadors survived two 
unexpectedly tough matches against lower-division foes in the first half of 
their four-match trip to Oahu. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade fell in four games, 15-13, 13-15, 15-10, 15-8, late Monday and it 
took five games late Tuesday for CSUN to do away with Brigham Young (Hawaii) of 
the NAIA. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-16, 16-14, 13-15, 15-11, 15-5 win extended Northridge's winning streak 
to nine matches and improved CSUN's record to 18-5. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the difficult part begins. Northridge will take on 15-2 Hawaii, ranked 
third in the NCAA Division I coaches' poll, today at 10 p.m. (PDT) and Friday 
at 10 p.m. (PDT). 
</P>
<P>
It marks the first time the Matadors will play back-to-back games against the 
same team. 
</P>
<P>
"The first night we'll prepare the same way we do with every other team," CSUN 
Coach Walt Ker said. "The second night it'll be a little different. Everyone 
has a little more of the book on each other. Still, the bottom line is we gotta 
execute. Hawaii is such a great team. Physically, they have no weaknesses." 
</P>
<P>
A victory or two over a highly ranked team such as Hawaii would give CSUN what 
the NCAA considers to be a "significant win." 
</P>
<P>
In its quest to earn an at-large berth in the 32-team NCAA tournament, CSUN 
needs several significant wins and a minimum of significant losses, that is, 
losses against teams that the Matadors should beat. 
</P>
<P>
Two of CSUN's losses are against teams that currently are ranked in the top 20. 
Another loss, to USC, came when the Trojans were ranked. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we are 25-7 at the end of the season we may not get a bid," Ker said. 
"A win or two over Hawaii would look good in the NCAA's eyes. But the San Diego 
State and (Cal Poly) San Luis Obispo matches (Oct. 26 and Nov. 16, 
respectively) are just as significant. We can't lose to them because we are not 
supposed to. Although the winning streak is critical we weren't supposed to 
lose to any of those teams." 
</P>
<P>
Against BYU (Hawaii), Matador senior Kathleen Dixon played the best blocking 
match of her career, according to Ker. Along with nine solo blocks and three 
assists, she had 28 kills. Twin Marianne also played exceptionally well, adding 
25 kills and eight blocks. In an unusual move, Ker played Marianne in the back 
row for both matches and she responded well. 
</P>
<P>
Right-side hitter Shelly Swalec reinjured her hamstring in the match and will 
be replaced by Shana Wilson against Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ker is a taskmaster, the Matadors have combined business and pleasure. 
Along with snorkeling and shopping, they toured Waimea Bay on the North Shore 
of Oahu on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to enjoy ourselves in this rough setting over here," Ker said. 
"It's hard." 
</P>
<P>
So is riding around in three white Cadillacs, the mode of transportation 
provided for the Matadors when the rental company couldn't deliver the trio of 
minivans Ker had reserved.

CLU TRACK STAR BERNARD CHALLENGING DIFFERENT TYPE OF BARRIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Darren Bernard, a Cal Lutheran track standout, always has been good at getting 
out of the blocks quickly. Now he is trying to uncover the building blocks of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard is one of two students working closely with Dennis Revie, an assistant 
professor of biology, on a study of thermoplasma acidophila, a type of bacteria 
found in extremely hot and acidic environments. The bacteria is so primitive, 
it takes the researchers back in evolutionary time. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard, a senior biology major, spent the summer in the laboratory and still 
spends three to four hours a day there in the hope he will make a discovery 
that will lead to a publishable paper. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, maybe a couple of students a year here do this sort of thing," 
Revie said. "He's one of our best students." 
</P>
<P>
Bernard said he believes the Revie team is one of only a handful in the world 
studying this bacteria. Although Bernard hopes to produce a publishable work 
before he graduates, he also plans to run track in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
He finished fifth in the NAIA national championships in the 400 meters as a 
freshman and has qualified for the outdoor nationals three times. 
</P>
<P>
Arts and sciences: Bernard is not the only Cal Lutheran athlete who has opted 
not to restrict his talent to the playing field. 
</P>
<P>
The spring 1990 edition of Morning Glory, the school's literary magazine, 
includes a photo by sophomore defensive lineman Tom Pellegrino and a serigraph 
by former baseball and football player Darnell Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
Francine Byrne, a former member of the cross-country and track teams, was on 
the magazine's selection committee. 
</P>
<P>
Tackling teammates: The tackle that Moorpark defensive back John Corcoran made 
on a punt return last weekend against Bakersfield was not a touchdown-saver, 
but it might have been a lifesaver. 
</P>
<P>
Corcoran was the up man on Moorpark's punt-return team when deep man Johnel 
Turner called for a fair catch. However, Turner fumbled the ball, then simply 
stood still after picking it up, not realizing he was an eligible target for 
the wall of Bakersfield defenders bearing down on him. 
</P>
<P>
The quick-thinking Corcoran grabbed Turner and threw him to the ground before 
the great Johnel turned into the late Johnel. 
</P>
<P>
Statwatch: The Cal State Northridge football team has allowed only three 
first-quarter points while scoring 27 points in opening periods this season. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, ranked 13th in Division II, has a 5-1 record but has outscored 
opponents by only three points, 111-108, overall. CSUN has been outgained, 
1,797 yards to 1,688, but has forced 21 turnovers while committing only 14. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran's Jay Weber broke a school single-game record with 32 rushing 
attempts last week against Claremont-Mudd. The previous record of 30 was held 
by Joe Stouch (1969) and Gene Uebelhardt (1972). Weber finished with 126 yards, 
the most by a CLU back this season, but 57 yards short of the single-game mark. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Barrett of Santa Monica has thrown for more than 200 yards and at least 
two touchdowns in every game this season. Barrett, a 1988 graduate of Burroughs 
High, has completed 86 of 130 passes for 1,434 yards and 16 touchdowns for the 
Corsairs (4-1). He has been intercepted seven times. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Glendale tailback Bobby Webster has been the Vaqueros' workhorse in the past 
three games, gaining 499 yards in 97 carries and scoring eight touchdowns. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley cornerback John Johnson intercepted two passes against East L. 
A. on Saturday night to raise his season total to five and Antelope Valley's 
total to 12. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Nicholson rushed for 136 yards in 19 carries in his first start at 
fullback for Northridge. In the previous five games, Nicholson had carried only 
five times for five yards. He is now No. 2 on the CSUN rushing list behind 
Albert Fann, the Matadors' All-American tailback. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Consistent: Darcy Arreola has not won a cross-country race this season, but 
the Cal State Northridge senior has been consistent in four invitational 
appearances, finishing second, third (twice) and fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, the 1989 NCAA Division II cross-country champion, posted consecutive 
third-place finishes at the Stanford Invitational, Oct. 6, and the Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo Invitational on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Although Arreola finished 29 seconds behind winner Suzy Favor (16 minutes 27 
seconds) of Wisconsin in the 5,000-meter race at Stanford, her performance 
bodes well for a top-15 finish at next month's Division I championships in 
Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Favor, the Division I champion in the 1,500 meters from 1987-90, is regarded as 
one of the favorites for this year's cross-country title. 
</P>
<P>
Passing off: Darren Del'Andrae, a finalist a year ago for the Harlon Hill 
Trophy, symbolic of Division II football's top player, has been benched at 
Portland State. 
</P>
<P>
Del'Andrae's problems started three weeks ago when he was unable to play in 
Portland State's 41-24 win over Cal State Sacramento, only one week after he 
threw three interceptions in a loss to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
Don Bailey, Portland State's other quarterback, started against Sacramento and 
completed 16 of 24 passes for 296 yards and three touchdowns. The following 
week against Northridge, Del'Andrae returned to the lineup, again throwing 
three interceptions in another Portland State loss. 
</P>
<P>
So Del'Andrae, a senior from Calabasas High, was back on the sideline Saturday 
when Bailey completed 29 of 49 passes for 332 yards in a loss to Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
How is Del'Andrae taking the demotion? 
</P>
<P>
"He's not talking," said Larry Sellers, a school spokesman. "Pokey (Allen, 
Portland State coach) says he's taking it hard, but better than a lot of people 
would. He's staying ready." 
</P>
<P>
Del'Andrae passed for 3,500 yards last season and was first-team All-America. 
</P>
<P>
On the run: Jeff Gilkey, the No. 3 runner on last year's Northridge men's 
cross-country team, is competing for Cal Poly Pomona this season. 
</P>
<P>
Gilkey, who placed 38th for Northridge in last year's Division II cross-country 
championships, did not run track for the Matadors in 1990 after a falling out 
with Coach Don Strametz. 
</P>
<P>
He was Pomona's fourth runner at the Stanford Invitational on Oct. 6, finishing 
71st with a time of 25:43 over the five-mile course. 
</P>

RUMORS ABOUT HAMMER'S DEMISE AGAIN PROVE GREATLY EXAGGERATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD WOUTAT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Armand Hammer, 92, said Tuesday that he has escaped his latest brush with 
death, an encounter that took the form of another in the series of death-watch 
rumors that swirl around the financier and philanthropist. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing fine. 
</P>
<P>
I've just got a bad cold," reported Hammer, the chairman and chief executive of 
Occidental Petroleum Corp., the nation's 16th largest industrial corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer spoke by phone from his home near UCLA, where he says he has been holed 
up for several days with bronchial problems. Hammer said he expects to be back 
in the office soon. 
</P>
<P>
The latest rumor had Hammer gravely ill and his survival a "day-to-day" 
proposition. An inquiry of Occidental prompted a quick reply from Hammer, who 
said in his familiar gravelly voice, "I understand you heard I died." 
</P>
<P>
Though Hammer still maintains a remarkable pace, he is said to tire quickly. 
Observers say he can seem robust one day but frail the next. 
</P>
<P>
Oxy's stock seems unaffected by the rumor. In trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange, the stock closed at 20.75 Wednesday, up 75 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer guessed that the newest rumor began when he departed early from a party 
on Oct. 11. Aides said gossip might also have started when he canceled a trip 
to New York for a dinner in his honor tonight. "His doctors don't want him to 
travel," an official explained.

HOMEFED PROFIT SINKS; CITICORP PLANS BIG LAYOFF; 
</P>
<P>
BANKING: BESET BY A BAD REAL ESTATE MARKET AND A SLOWING ECONOMY, FINANCIAL 
INSTITUTIONS EVERYWHERE ARE HURTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HomeFed Corp. on Wednesday joined the ranks of large thrifts and banks 
reporting relatively poor third-quarter profits linked to worsening real estate 
markets and a slowdown in the national economy. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed Corp., the San Diego-based parent company of HomeFed Bank, reported 
that net income for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 fell 92%, to $1.9 million 
from $23.9 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Besides HomeFed, other major financial institutions reporting lower earnings on 
Wednesday included Glenfed, NCNB and Fleet/Norstar Financial Group. Separately, 
New York banking giant Citicorp warned in a meeting with securities analysts 
that it will lay off thousands and that the cost of the layoffs has yet to be 
taken. The analysts said the job cuts will likely total 5,000, at a cost of 
$100 million. 
</P>
<P>
This has been a terrible week for banks and thrifts as major institutions 
throughout the country have posted weak earnings or losses. Earlier this week, 
such major institutions as Great Western Financial in Beverly Hills, Security 
Pacific Corp. in Los Angeles and Citicorp reported sharp declines in earnings 
stemming from real estate-related problems and the softer economy. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed was hurt by having to set aside additional money for possible losses on 
loans and reduced income from real estate operations. While the thrift 
experienced continued weakness in its commercial real estate and apartment loan 
portfolios, HomeFed was also hampered by a statewide slowdown in single-family 
home construction, said Chief Executive Robert F. Adelizzi. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed stock closed down $.50 to $6.625 Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
While HomeFed continued to be plagued by its commercial real estate loan 
portfolio, its performance was "in line" with third-quarter reports by other 
major banks and savings and loans in California, said Gary Gordon, a 
PaineWebber analyst in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a case of misery loves company," Gordon said. "There's a clear problem, 
no question about it, in the commercial real estate market. It's been growing 
outside of California, and now it's a growing problem within California." 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed's non-performing assets increased over the quarter to $749 million, or 
3.92% of total assets on Sept. 30, up from $708 million, or 3.73% of total 
assets on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The company recorded $49.2 million in new provisions for losses, compared with 
a massive $234-million loan-loss provision the previous quarter, which led to a 
$108-million loss for the three months ended June 30. HomeFed set aside a 
$34-million loan-loss provision for its third quarter in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed now has adequate capital to meet a tougher, risk-based capital ratio 
that federal regulators will institute on Dec. 31. "If all things stay the same 
between now and Dec. 31st, we . . . (would meet) the requirements," Adelizzi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed reported that about 40% of its non-performing assets are in California, 
22% are in Florida and 8% are in Arizona. The remaining 30% are scattered 
across other states. 
</P>
<P>
"This (third-quarter report) is obviously a continuation of a slow real estate 
trend that we have seen over the last several months," Adelizzi said. "We're 
not pleased with the level of the (loan-loss) provisions, but all other 
elements of the report are meeting our expectations." 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed, which has laid off nearly 290 employees, or about 6% of its work force 
in recent months, has no plans for additional layoffs, Adelizzi said. "I would 
expect that constitutes the vast majority of any layoffs that will be 
experienced," Adelizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
Although down, earnings for Glenfed Inc., parent of Glendale Federal Bank, were 
better than most. Its profit fell 9.6% in the third quarter from a year 
earlier, when the thrift had substantial gains on the sale of fixed-rate loans 
a year earlier.

<P>
With gasoline prices less than a penny per gallon below the all-time record, 
consumers have responded by cutting back on their use of gasoline and switching 
to less-pricey grades. 
</P>
<P>
Driven by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait 11 weeks ago, the price of regular 
unleaded self-serve gasoline has risen on average more than 30 cents a gallon 
nationally since Aug. 1 to nearly $1.38 a gallon, the American Automobile Assn. 
reported this week. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the price for the same grade of gasoline climbed more than 23 
cents a gallon to about $1.34 as of Oct. 5, according to the latest figures 
from the Lundberg Survey. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, federal investigators are trying to nail down proof that oil 
companies colluded to raise prices. Earlier this month, they issued subpoenas 
to oil companies and refiners for internal documents. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators and consumer groups continue to accuse the industry of 
price-gouging and profiteering, because gasoline prices rose so quickly and so 
sharply after the Aug. 2 invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut and Massachusetts quickly enacted emergency anti-price gouging 
measures similar to one already in force in New York, and Sen. Joseph I. 
Lieberman (D-Conn.) is pushing a federal anti-gouging bill designed to prevent 
a future gasoline price shock. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, oil industry officials have steadfastly denied charges of 
price-fixing, arguing that the price hikes merely reflect the workings of the 
marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe (the investigations) will show, as they have in the past, that the 
market is working, and that there are just too many transactions involving too 
many people to engage in collusive activity," said Joe Lastelic, a spokesman 
for the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's main trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials added that gasoline price hikes have failed to keep pace 
with the rapid run-up in prices of crude oil, from which gasoline is made. 
Refiners and marketers of gasoline, they note, are now losing money. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the price of light, sweet crude oil for November delivery fell 
$2.17 a barrel to $36.72 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The 
sharp drop was only the latest move in a volatile market characterized recently 
by dramatic increases and declines almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein pulls out of Kuwait tomorrow and crude 
prices plummet, gasoline prices are expected to lag by weeks. That would give 
refiners time to recover losses incurred during the period of high crude 
prices, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"On the upside, everyone says that gasoline prices move up immediately, but on 
the downside, they move with a lag" behind crude oil prices, said John 
Lichtblau, president of the industry-funded Petroleum Industry Research 
Foundation in New York. "This time, they will follow with a considerable lag." 
</P>
<P>
The automobile association reported that the nationwide increase in gasoline 
prices has slowed. Still, the average national price of $1.379 a gallon is just 
a hair short of the record price of $1.388 a gallon reported the weekend before 
Easter, 1981, during the Iran-Iraq war. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, demand for gasoline is off. Demand last month was 1.5% lower than 
a year ago, a higher-than-usual drop attributable in part to the higher prices, 
the petroleum institute reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, drivers reportedly are switching in droves from higher-priced 
premium blends to regular gasolines, though there's no clear data on the trend. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are expected to continue rising to make up for the continuing run-up of 
crude oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the 30-cent-a-gallon hike in retail gasoline prices, the cash price 
of the benchmark U.S. grade of crude oil has risen more than 42 cents a gallon 
since Aug. 1. As the price of crude oil goes up, the cost of making gasoline 
goes up. If the price of gasoline does not follow, the profit margin for 
gasoline shrinks. 
</P>
<P>
Because the hike in gasoline prices has not kept pace with crude prices, 
international oil companies are expected to report that refining and marketing 
profits fell 52% in the third quarter, which included August and September, 
according to a report by Salomon Bros. 
</P>
<P>
That would more than offset the 50% increase expected in earnings from 
exploration and production operations, due to higher crude oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
Still, industry critics charge that the oil industry conspired to unfairly 
raise gasoline prices. Wholesale and retail gasoline prices jumped as much as 
10 cents a gallon within days of the invasion, even though that gasoline was 
refined from crude oil purchased weeks earlier at much lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
The industry argued at the time that such rapid increases were intended to 
cover the anticipated higher replacement costs of crude oil and to reflect the 
greater influence of spot and futures markets, where prices react almost 
instantaneously to world events. 
</P>
<P>
But such explanations didn't satisfy regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Justice launched an investigation into the price hikes on 
Aug. 6. After interviewing industry executives, the department took the further 
step of issuing subpoenas for company records. 
</P>
<P>
Several states have pressed similar investigations, though California deferred 
to the feds. "All of the prices were going up pretty much in unison, and the 
question arose: Was there a possible antitrust violation? Did they get together 
and raise their prices in a conspiracy?" said Joe Bizzaro, spokesman for 
Florida Atty. Gen. Bob Butterworth. Florida issued subpoenas to 16 major oil 
companies operating in that state. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts and industry observers doubt that the investigations would turn up 
evidence of an actual back room conspiracy. "They don't need to collude," said 
Ed Rothschild, director of energy policy for Citizen Action, a Washington-based 
consumer group. "Communication is so readily available, they are aware of the 
pricing decisions they and others make in the marketplace all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Short of finding conspiracy, there's little the federal government can do about 
the rapid price run-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberman is proposing a federal law that would regulate price hikes, similar 
to a law in New York that prevents retailers from raising prices faster than 
their costs increase. The industry opposes the measure. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the state attorney general's office is investigating whether 
petroleum refiners or marketers violated the price-gouging law, and subpoenas 
were issued to service station operators. 
</P>
<P>
But initial results of the investigations suggest the limits of such laws. 
Investigators found that retailers were merely passing on wholesale price 
hikes, said Edward Barbini, a spokesman for New York Atty. Gen. Robert Abrams. 
"We don't see a widespread pattern of (price-gouging) at this time," he said. 
The state's law does not extend to wholesale price hikes, said Edward Barbini, 
a spokesman for New York Atty. Gen. Robert Abrams.

HOMEFED PROFIT SINKS; CITICORP PLANS BIG LAYOFF; 
</P>
<P>
BANKING: BESET BY A BAD REAL ESTATE MARKET AND A SLOWING ECONOMY, FINANCIAL 
INSTITUTIONS EVERYWHERE ARE HURTING. 
</P>

<P>
HomeFed Corp. on Wednesday joined the ranks of large thrifts and banks 
reporting poor third-quarter profits linked to a worsening real estate market 
and an slowdown in the national economy. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed Corp., the San Diego-based parent of HomeFed Bank, the nation's 
sixth-largest thrift, reported that net income for the third quarter ended 
Sept. 30 fell 92% to $1.9 million from $23.9 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, UnionFed Financial Corp., a medium-sized thrift based in Brea, 
restated its earnings to reflect a loss of $30.9 million in its fourth quarter 
ended June 30. The thrift, parent of Union Federal Savings Bank, previously 
reported that it lost only $1.7 million in the quarter. Regulators forced the 
thrift to write off or lower the value of troubled commercial real estate 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
Besides HomeFed, other major financial institutions reporting lower earnings 
Wednesday included Glenfed Inc., NCNB Corp. and Fleet/Norstar Financial Group 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, New York banking giant Citicorp warned in a meeting with securities 
analysts that it will lay off thousands and that the cost of the layoffs has 
yet to be recognized in its earnings. The analysts said the job cuts in the 
continuing program will likely total 5,000, at a cost of $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
This has been a terrible week for banks and thrifts, as major institutions 
throughout the country posted weak earnings or losses. Earlier this week, such 
major institutions as Great Western Financial Corp. in Beverly Hills, Security 
Pacific Corp. in Los Angeles and Citicorp reported sharp declines in earnings 
stemming from real estate-related problems and the softer economy. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed was hurt by having to set aside additional money for possible losses on 
loans and reduced income from real estate operations. While the thrift 
experienced continued weakness in its commercial real estate and apartment loan 
portfolios, HomeFed was also hampered by a statewide slowdown in single-family 
home construction, Chief Executive Robert F. Adelizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
While HomeFed continued to be plagued by its commercial real estate loan 
portfolio, the San Diego-based S&amp;L's performance was "in line" with third 
quarter reports by other major banks and thrifts in California, said Gary 
Gordon, a Paine Webber Inc. analyst in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a case of misery loves company," Gordon said. "There's a clear problem, 
no question about it, in the commercial real estate market. It's been growing 
outside of California and now it's a growing problem within California." 
</P>
<P>
Although down, earnings for Glenfed, parent of Glendale Federal Bank, were 
better than most. Its profit fell 9.6% in the third quarter from a year 
earlier, when the thrift had substantial gains on the sale of fixed-rate loans 
a year earlier. The Glendale-based thrift said earnings in its basic business, 
which excludes the sale of loans and investments, rose from $9.9 million to 
$34.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere across the country, NCNB, the nation's seventh-largest bank holding 
company, said its third-quarter earnings fell nearly $87 million due to problem 
loans and deterioration in the economy. The bank reported net income for the 
quarter of $57 million, down from $143.6 million a year earlier. Fleet/Norstar 
Financial Group, based in Providence, R.I., reported earnings in the third 
quarter of $38 million, down from $96 million a year earlier.

Former Stock Exchange Chairman Convicted: Ronald Li, former chairman of the 
Hong Kong Stock Exchange, was convicted in Hong Kong on corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
A seven-member jury deliberated for more than 10 hours before convicting Li of 
accepting preferential offerings of shares in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. and 
Novel Enterprises Ltd. in 1986 and 1987 in exchange for helping to obtain 
listings on the market for the companies' shares. Li, 61, had pleaded innocent 
to the charges. The jury convicted Li by a margin of 5-2, sufficient in Hong 
Kong to find a defendant guilty. He faces a maximum penalty of seven years in 
prison and $64,000 in fines on each of two counts.

Paramount's Books to Be Examined: Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider said he 
expects to appoint a "special master" to examine Paramount Pictures' books 
before the court sets damages in Art Buchwald's suit over the film "Coming to 
America." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for both sides said they would accept Franklin Johnson, an 
entertainment expert with the Price Waterhouse accounting firm, as the court's 
independent expert. Schneider asked the attorneys to schedule a hearing with 
Johnson in coming weeks to agree on a "game plan" for the examination. 
Schneider has already ruled that the film, starring Eddie Murphy, was based on 
a story by Buchwald, despite Paramount's claims.

EASTERN IS COOL TO NEW ACQUISITION OFFER; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: NORTHWEST CHAIRMAN ALFRED A. CHECCHI HAS MADE A NON-CASH PROPOSAL FOR 
THE STRUGGLING CARRIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. DALLOS and DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Eastern Airlines' management is apparently unimpressed with an acquisition 
offer for the struggling carrier from Northwest Airlines Chairman Alfred A. 
Checchi. 
</P>
<P>
"It is still in the formative stages," said a source familiar with the 
situation. "It is not dramatically different from earlier proposals that were 
rejected." 
</P>
<P>
Checchi delivered a proposal to Eastern's creditors committee last week, but 
refused to disclose details. Checchi did say, however, that he doesn't intend 
to pay cash for Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
Checchi previously bid for 80 of Eastern's aircraft, its Atlanta hub, slots at 
New York's LaGuardia and Washington National airports and its Miami maintenance 
base. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's creditors committee met in New York Wednesday. Telephone calls to 
committee members for comment on Checchi's offer were unavailing. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't clear how Checchi would buy Eastern for no money down. One possibility 
is that he could issue Northwest stock to Eastern's creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility is that Northwest could form a joint venture that would 
acquire Eastern. The venture could pay Eastern's creditors with stock or notes. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Pettee, an airline analyst with the New York mutual fund firm Alliance 
Capital, doubted Eastern creditors would accept securities as payment. 
</P>
<P>
"They are looking to recoup whatever cash they can get," Pettee said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he understood that Delta Airlines has made an offer for Eastern's 
Atlanta gates, but that there are no other offers. "I am told that the 
creditors are seriously looking toward liquidating Eastern," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Guy Cook, chairman of Northwest's machinists union, said Checchi discussed a 
possible Eastern acquisition with him, and that he supported it. 
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that Northwest has to expand to survive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An Eastern acquisition would be tricky because its machinist union is on 
strike. Checchi would have to settle the strike, or risk a walkout by Northwest 
machinists, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
Checchi has indicated that he is interested not only in Eastern, but also in 
Pan Am and possibly Trans World Airlines. According to two well connected 
sources, Checchi looked into a TWA acquisition last year, but determined that 
its then $750-million price tag was too high. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Scott, head of TWA's pilots union, said he discussed an acquisition of the 
airline with Checchi several months ago. "He said it was an interesting 
situation, but that he didn't want to deal with Icahn," said Scott. TWA's 
owner, investor Carl Icahn, has a reputation for endless haggling on deals. 
</P>
<P>
Checchi didn't indicate whether he would buy all or just part of Pan Am, which 
is also for sale. It might be difficult for Checchi to acquire a part of Pan Am 
-- its Northeastern shuttle, for example -- without cash, because Pan Am needs 
the money to finance its other money-losing operations. 
</P>
<P>
Checchi's appetite for airlines comes as the industry's fortunes are sagging 
and as his own airline faces a large acquisition debt and the prospects of 
layoffs. The industry is expected to lose $1 billion in the fourth quarter, 
mostly due to high jet fuel costs. 
</P>
<P>
One sign of how the industry is faring came Wednesday, when American Airlines 
said its third-quarter earnings fell 52%, and that it could lose money for the 
entire year. 
</P>
<P>
Checchi is clearly concerned about losses at Northwest. As a precaution, he has 
arranged to borrow up to $1 billion -- half of it from aircraft suppliers -- if 
needed for operations. He said that money would not be used for acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the grim outlook, industry analysts said it made sense for Checchi to 
look for an acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's economic outlook is not necessarily tomorrow's outlook," said Rose Ann 
Tortora, an analyst with the County NatWest U.S.A. investment firm. "It makes 
sense for all airlines to be looking."

DOW EKES OUT GAIN OF 6.68 AS OIL PRICES FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services

<TEXT>
<P>
Tumbling oil prices boosted blue chips Wednesday, but worries over corporate 
profits, budget bickering and the Mideast stalemate kept most stocks under 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index closed up 6.68 points at 2,387.87, after earlier 
rising 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
But losing issues outnumbered gainers by 832 to 655 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Big Board volume came to 161.26 million. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices were the main influence on the Dow: crude for November delivery slid 
$2.17 on the New York Mercantile Exchange to $36.72. But the broader market was 
hurt by other news that sapped investor confidence. The Standard &amp; Poor's 
500 index slipped 0.16 point to 298.76. 
</P>
<P>
The only bright spot was a sharp rally in high-tech stocks that helped boost 
the NASDAQ over-the-counter composite index 1.34 to 326.78, a 0.4% rise. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, traders cited uneasiness over third-quarter earnings, the budget 
deadlock, the lingering stalemate in the Persian Gulf and rising fears of a 
deep recession. 
</P>
<P>
Traders were watching closely for developments on the budget. The Senate and 
the House have now produced separate proposals to cut the deficit, and the 
financial markets are hoping for a package that will allow credit to ease. 
</P>
<P>
But earnings disappointments -- and expectations of a long economic slide ahead 
-- could destroy any rally based on interest-rate hopes, many analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Citicorp, which reported a plunge in third-quarter earnings Tuesday, fell 1/4 
to 12 3/4, a 52-week low. Several brokerage firms cut ratings and estimates on 
the bank. The Midwest's Banc One fell 2 1/2 to 20 7/8 after Bear Stearns and 
Shearson Lehman cut their estimates on the firm after it reported 
lower-than-expected earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Some battered S&amp;Ls staged modest rallies after their earnings reports, 
however. Ahmanson gained 3/4 to 12 1/4 and Great Western inched up 3/8 to 9 
1/2. But Citadel Holding tumbled 2 1/2 to 30 1/2 and HomeFed lost 5/8 to 6 1/2 
on renewed credit worries. Volatile stock Coast Savings gained 3/8 to 2 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Tech stocks were broadly higher in what analysts said was a reaction to 
perceived bargain prices in many of the issues, and short covering by traders 
who had correctly forecast the stocks' recent plunge. Apple jumped 1 1/2 to 26 
1/2, Sun Microsystems rose 2 1/8 to 21 1/2, Intel added 1 to 32 and Conner 
Peripherals rose 1 to 17 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
AST Research jumped 1 1/2 to 16 1/2, Advanced Logic rose 1 1/4 to 6 1/4 and 
Quantum added 1 3/8 to 14 1/4, all on strong earnings news. 
</P>
<P>
* Caesars World rose 1 to 14 5/8, continuing to gain on takeover rumors. 
Competitor Showboat also advanced, up 1/2 to 3 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Pepsico lost 7/8 to 22 3/4. C. J. Lawrence and Salomon Bros. cut their 
ratings on the stock. Traders said Salomon also cut its rating on Coca-Cola, 
off 1/8 to 41 5/8, and Procter &amp; Gamble, down 7/8 to 74 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
* United Technologies, which reported a 7.5% rise in third quarter earnings, 
gained 1 3/8 to 46 5/8.

CREDIT: Bond Prices Close Little Changed 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices finished flat, influenced by mixed economic reports and plans for a 
record 2-year Treasury note auction. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year issue rose about $1 per $1,000 in face amount. Its 
yield, which falls when the price rises, eased to 8.88% from 8.89% late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said Commerce Department reports showing weakness in the housing 
industry but rising industrial production in September injected confusion into 
the market because they signaled recession and growth at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 6%, down from 7.938% late Tuesday. The drop was due to internal market 
factors and was not considered a sign of easing by the Federal Reserve.

CURRENCY: Dollar Sharply Lower Against Yen 
</P>
<P>
The dollar plunged anew against the Japanese yen and finished mixed against 
other major currencies in busy trading. 
</P>
<P>
Much attention focused on the yen, which rose significantly against the dollar. 
Traders said Japanese money managers are bringing their money home in an effort 
to support a weakening stock market and banks that have suffered declines in 
capital ratios. 
</P>
<P>
"People expect (Japan's) Ministry of Finance to keep yen interest rates fairly 
high," which attracts investors, said Bob Morrissey, trader at the Bank of 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell sharply in Tokyo, where the U.S. currency settled at 125.80 
Japanese yen, down from 128.05 yen on Tuesday. In New York, the dollar closed 
off its lows at 125.43 yen but still was down from 126.79 yen on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar also fell to an all-time low of 1.504 German marks in Europe 
Wednesday. The dollar later recovered to close at 1.512 marks, up from 1.511 
Tuesday.

COMMODITIES: Gold Prices Stage Minor Comeback 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures rebounded moderately after three days of steep losses on New 
York's Commodity Exchange. Analysts said the rally was an overdue correction. 
</P>
<P>
Gold for October rose $4.70 to $366.70 an ounce; October silver added 5.6 cents 
to $4.19. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, orange juice futures dropped to new four-year lows amid speculation 
that Brazilian processors will dump more frozen concentrate onto the U.S. 
market in a shakeout stemming from a large Florida crop forecast. 
</P>
<P>
All contracts for future deliveries of frozen concentrated orange juice plunged 
the permitted daily limit of 5 cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange 
except the November contract, which has an expanded limit and fell 5.85 cents 
to $1.12 a pound. The November close was the lowest for a near-month juice 
contract since 1986.

WELLS FARGO SHUTS FOUR CONSTRUCTION LOAN OFFICES 
</P>

In a further sign that real estate lending is softening, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. 
confirmed Wednesday that it closed four of its 18 construction lending offices 
last week and laid off about 10% of its workers in that area. 
</P>
<P>
The closed offices are in San Jose, Sacramento, Minneapolis and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Essary, spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based bank, said the layoffs 
affected about 75 people out of 750 in the unit. 
</P>
<P>
She added that some of the cities where Wells is closing offices can be served 
by other offices that are in Wells Fargo's Real Estate Group. "The volume in 
the market doesn't justify having that many offices," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Banks nationwide have slowed real estate lending activity sharply as markets 
have rapidly softened and the nation's economy has weakened. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo, one of the nation's largest real estate lenders, is generally 
credited by bankers and analysts with being astute in the field. However, its 
stock has been battered lately because of investor concerns over the health of 
its real estate and corporate buyout loans. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the bank released third-quarter earnings showing that its 
profit climbed 6%, to $162.6 million.

ASHTON-TATE HAS FIRST PROFIT IN 18 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Citing increasing sales of its flagship database management software program, 
Ashton-Tate Corp. on Wednesday reported third-quarter earnings of $1.1 million, 
its first quarterly profit in 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
The results surprised Wall Street analysts, who had widely estimated losses of 
up to $5 million at the faltering Torrance-based software publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the quarter totaled $60.4 million, up 12% from the $53.9 million a 
year ago when the company lost $19.3 million. For the first nine months of the 
year, the company lost $12.5 million, compared to $27.6 million in the year-ago 
period. Sales so far this year totaled $165.5 million, down 18.5% from the 
$203.2 million recorded a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ashton-Tate has been hard hit since releasing a flawed version of its 
market-leading dBase database management program in late 1988 and then 
recording as "sold" thousands of copies stockpiled on wholesalers' shelves. 
That resulted in losses of more than $50 million over the last 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
After working feverishly for months, the company released a corrected version 
of the program in late July, and executives have said sales are noticeably 
picking up. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased with the progress we've made," said company President 
William Lyons. "The product has been favorably reviewed . . . and our customers 
are confirming that it is stable and reliable."

FROM L.A. PARENT: A WORD OR TWO ON TEENS; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLICATIONS: THE EDITOR OF LOS ANGELES' POPULAR PARENTING GUIDE OFFERS A 
MONTHLY NEWSPAPER WITH TIPS ON 'URBAN SURVIVAL' FOR KIDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD, Appleford is a regular contributor to Valley View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These last 10 years as founding editor in chief of L.A. Parent might have been 
preparation enough for just about any new publishing venture Jack Bierman chose 
to undertake. But then, Bierman and his staff decided this year to launch the 
Noise, a colorful monthly newspaper geared toward local teen-agers, and found 
themselves confronted with a whole new set of constantly changing rules and 
customs. 
</P>
<P>
The paper addresses the often confounding mix of teen-age seriousness and 
frivolity with a lively collection of feature articles on entertainment, 
education, emerging sports heroes, fashion and social issues. They admit that 
it's been a difficult task appealing to a wildly scattered and deeply factioned 
age group that has some members more interested in rap than surfing, others 
preferring sports to sunbathing, or movies to fashion, and vice versa. And even 
if it's true that as many things stay the same as change with teen-agers, it's 
not always easy to tell which those are. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just now at the point where I think we're starting to get a feel for 
what kinds of things they're interested in," said Bierman, 47, sitting in a 
conference room with Noise editor Norbert Sparrow, both surrounded by stacks of 
L.A. Parent and Noise back issues. "That's one of the fun things about starting 
a publication. You have this period of experimentation. Then the publication 
actually starts speaking to you, defining itself." 
</P>
<P>
Subtitled "An urban survival guide for teens," the tabloid-sized Noise is 
distributed free throughout Los Angeles at record and clothing stores, sandwich 
shops, bowling alleys and some high schools, with a circulation that Bierman 
says is about 45,000. Its seventh issue hit the streets this month. 
</P>
<P>
A similar publication aimed specifically at students attending private schools 
exists in New York City, but Bierman and Sparrow agreed there are few other 
long-term success stories with teen newspapers across the country. Even if 
entertainment listings on the back pages of the Noise would seem a valuable 
guide for young adults looking for nighttime activities similar to those 
enjoyed by their older brothers and sisters, the Noise and other would-be teen 
papers suffer some inherent problems. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as teen-agers are concerned, as a group we're so self-conscious that if 
we pick up something labeled for us, immediately it's uncool," said 16-year-old 
Jackie Goldberg, a senior at the Buckley School in Sherman Oaks who has 
contributed entertainment reviews to the Noise. "That's just a fact of life. 
</P>
<P>
"But the Noise is good because it focuses in on what it knows is going on with 
teeny-bops." 
</P>
<P>
Some of those topics stretch far beyond the fascination with celebrities and 
enter into real problems now faced by young people. One recent issue recounted 
the pressures faced by a young mixed-race couple. Other articles, by 
professional writers, have dealt with AIDS, skinhead youths and a variety of 
pressing educational matters. 
</P>
<P>
"It may seem like they have it easier than we did superficially," Sparrow, 36, 
said. "I don't think they have it any easier. They have to deal with very 
important problems: AIDS, the will to succeed, coming out of college with a 
$40,000 debt." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the seriousness of contemporary teen-agers caught the Noise founders by 
surprise when they visited high school campuses to survey students and teachers 
about their concerns and needs. Most surprising, and gratifying, to them was 
the discovery that a large number of teen-agers are avid readers, absorbing 
publications as light as Bop magazine and as heavy as the Economist. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers as a group are heavy consumers, while surprisingly issue-oriented, 
Bierman said. Advertisers of movies, television and clothing have already 
attempted to reach that group through the Noise. And Bierman said he hopes 
colleges and insurance companies will soon purchase space for the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
The editor is also waiting to see what new products and services may emerge 
partly in response to the Noise, much as the local parenting industry that 
virtually sprung up around the untapped readership of L.A. Parent. When that 
localized parenting magazine was founded in 1979, Bierman said, it was the only 
one of its kind in the country. Since then, 60 have started publication. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be around a while before people are going to sink their money," 
Bierman said. "So that's the challenge. I'd like to say it's interesting, but 
since some of this money is mine, it's more than interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Bierman said starting up the Noise added "around 25%" to the annual costs of 
L.A. Parent, owned by Bierman and his younger brother, publisher Carey Bierman. 
The new expenses center around its new, larger printing bill, the addition of 
more office space and salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Sparrow said he has five teen-age writers contributing entertainment reviews to 
the paper. Most of them came in response to an advertisement in the Noise 
seeking young writers and photographers. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Goldberg had heard about the new publication from a friend during the 
summer and soon picked up a copy at a local clothing store. Her main interest 
then was in art and graphics, and she sent a letter to the Noise with some 
examples of her artwork. Sparrow called her back to say that the paper uses its 
professional staff for its MTV-inspired design, but invited her to write for 
the paper. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty exciting," she said. "People at my school, when they hear, they're 
impressed. But what I like about it is that it's a job I went and got for 
myself without anyone's help." 
</P>
<P>
The Noise still relies on its staff to create the longer, in-depth feature 
stories that are the paper's foundation. So the teen-age journalists are left 
to the reviews and news briefs inside and are paid a nominal fee of $15 for 
each story. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's not the point," said Kevin Taylor, who at 17 was the Noise's first 
teen-age writer. "I do it for the experience and because I love to write." 
</P>
<P>
It has also allowed the senior from Monroe High School in Sepulveda the 
opportunity to attend concerts and film screenings for the press, squeezing in 
between the same professional critics he's read or seen on television. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great ego trip." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg hasn't yet decided whether to focus her upcoming college education on 
art or study English literature as a way to continue with her new interest in 
journalism. Before the Noise, she had never seriously considered writing as a 
career. "This makes it more real," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Noise editors are now looking for young correspondents from every high 
school in the city, in an attempt to stay current with teen-age concerns. And 
as a result, the occasional teen-ager, whether in plain blue jeans or in 
post-punk, platinum-haired glory, has wandered into the otherwise quiet L.A. 
Parent-Noise offices. Bierman still seems a bit incredulous at some of the 
things he's seen and heard. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Don't boge my mode,' " he said, smiling. "Have you heard that?" 
</P>
<P>
Sparrow laughed. "Once we've heard about it, it's probably already passe."

WHEN FEELINGS RUN WILD; 
</P>
<P>
GROUPS: ABOUT 200 PEOPLE MEET TO DISCUSS THEIR LATEST TRIUMPHS AND TRAUMAS IN 
EMOTIONS ANONYMOUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donna tried to kill herself in 1981 by swallowing a bottle of tranquilizers. 
Four years ago, she fantasized about driving her Volkswagen "off of Topanga." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Donna drove herself to recovery. She read a newspaper announcement 
about a North Hollywood group that discussed emotional problems. "I went an 
hour early. I was shaking. It was a major effort to get out of the house." 
</P>
<P>
These days, Donna -- not her real name -- attends two meetings a week of 
Emotions Anonymous, a support group for people who can't control their 
feelings. Modeled after the 12-step program of Alcoholics Anonymous, about 10 
groups in the San Fernando Valley -- about 200 people -- assemble each week to 
run through their latest triumphs and traumas. 
</P>
<P>
These are not drug or alcohol addicts; in fact, the organization was 
established in St. Paul, Minn., in 1971 by veterans of other 12-step programs 
who felt their specific needs weren't being addressed in more narrowly focused 
groups, such as AA or Narcotics Anonymous. According to Marion, one of its 
Minnesota founders, Emotions Anonymous has evolved into more than 1,600 groups 
in 26 countries. 
</P>
<P>
"EA can help anyone," Marion said. "Just because we don't talk about drugs or 
drinking doesn't mean we don't have serious problems." 
</P>
<P>
Donna goes to meetings Wednesdays and Saturdays at the Medical Center of North 
Hollywood. On Wednesday nights, about two dozen people -- most are middle-aged 
-- gather for nearly two hours of sharing secrets kept hidden from even their 
closest companions. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a greater responsibility to the members of EA than the average person," 
Donna said. "The people in my life before EA aren't in it anymore. There's an 
incredible intimacy that's developed. You get to see inside the person's 
garbage." 
</P>
<P>
The garbage accumulates from anywhere: 
</P>
<P>
George can't deal with his sense of insecurity every time he fights with his 
wife. "I feel like I could scream." 
</P>
<P>
Harold fears he'll be kicked out of his apartment. "I just don't know what to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Warren never feels safe. "The only place I feel safe is in my dreams, where I 
want to be a little boy again." 
</P>
<P>
And Donna cringes every time she thinks about the sexy negligee her husband 
probably gave his new girlfriend. "All I can think about is the two of them 
together. It's ended my life as I had known it." 
</P>
<P>
After a while, members become familiar with everyone else's life, catching a 
mini-soap opera of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
The meetings are free. All the members introduce themselves by first name only 
-- they deeply cherish their privacy -- and the accompanying, "and I'm 
powerless over my emotions." Some say their name and add, "I have a neurotic 
ego." They shift control of their behavior to a "higher power" -- it can be God 
or another spiritual force -- to lessen the emotional burden on themselves. The 
higher power thus becomes their ally, guiding them to gradually lead happier 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
"The higher power will help me," Pam said. "You still have to do your part in 
your recovery, but you feel you are not alone." 
</P>
<P>
Though the name of God is invoked, Emotions Anonymous is not a religious 
organization. "When I came in, I had a terrible time with the God issue," Allan 
said. "But I learned that it's a spiritual program, and doesn't have to be tied 
to God." 
</P>
<P>
Pam often arrives at Wednesday meetings immediately after therapy. She finds 
the transition quite natural. "This gives me something therapy can't," said 
Pam, 39, who was chronically depressed for years before joining the group. She 
couldn't sleep and had constant headaches. "Here, you can connect to what other 
people are going through. Even if the therapist says, 'This is happening to 
other people,' do you believe him? No, you think you're the only one." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, psychologists support the group, even referring patients. 
But they caution about potential dangers. 
</P>
<P>
"I do recommend that those in 12-step programs get therapy too," said Dr. 
Garrett O'Connor, a Westchester psychiatrist. "They complement each other. But 
someone in a 12-step without also taking therapy might not get the help they 
need." 
</P>
<P>
Pam was worried about the stigma associated with therapy groups. "I had a 
feeling it might be a bunch of psychotics," she said, "but then I met a person 
in L.A. who was in EA and wasn't psychotic." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Pam confessed, Emotions Anonymous contains its share of offbeat 
members. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people I like hearing more than others, of course," she said, "and 
then there are some where I go, 'Oh, no, here he goes again!' " 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said Emotions Anonymous, like many 12-step programs, contains many 
people who will probably never improve. "There's nothing for a lot of these 
people anywhere else. They are taking medication, and this, at least, gives 
them a place to go for a few hours." 
</P>
<P>
Each member is allowed three minutes to speak. Not everyone does; at each 
meeting, at least half a dozen remain silent the whole time. Adam, 68, joined 
about a year ago to confront anger and depression that have lingered since most 
of his family died in the Holocaust. He said nothing the first few months. 
</P>
<P>
"I just sat there," he said, "and then, listening to others, I began to admire 
their courage and honesty. Here were people who were not ashamed to talk about 
suicide and molestation. I thought, 'Why don't I open up?' And I did." 
</P>
<P>
Members agree that the meetings are conducive to sharing problems and feelings 
when nobody challenges anyone's revelations. In the 12-step programs, unlike 
therapy, people are not supposed to respond verbally to another person's 
thoughts and feelings. They clap, nod their heads and offer words of 
encouragement, but if Donna wants to hate her husband, that's her life. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no one to say you're wrong," Donna said. "The therapist has a 
tremendous amount of authority and power. He has the answer, the fix. But for 
us in the group, we're self-centered, and part of being self-centered is 
needing to be right. For someone to tell you you're wrong is painful. 
</P>
<P>
"Later on, by ourselves, we'll see where we are wrong, and that's when we can 
really change. I never believed when someone told me I was wrong. I blamed my 
parents for everything, but I got honest, and realized that they did the best 
they could." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, though, members break the rule regarding comment. When Donna 
recently vented her growing frustration with her husband's extramarital affair, 
Betty felt compelled to respond: "I know this isn't going to sound real good to 
you, but the pain doesn't go away. It doesn't get any better." 
</P>
<P>
After the meetings, however, members feel free to offer advice. They greet each 
other with long, sustained hugs. They stay in touch through the week, often 
getting together socially. At one recent meeting, they even made plans to write 
a letter to a former group member who moved to Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, they are always a phone call away. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really depressed a few days ago," said Pam, "and I needed someone to 
talk to, and I couldn't wait for a meeting, so I called someone, and it really 
helped. And I've received calls in the middle of the night too." 
</P>
<P>
Most members attend two or three meetings a week; there is at least one meeting 
each night somewhere in the Valley. And they show no desire to end their 
association with Emotions Anonymous. Daniel, who has been attending meetings 
for 13 years and goes four times a week, said he'll be involved forever. The 
group, many say, has saved their lives, and there's no reason to get out now. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a crutch, no question," conceded Allan, "but it's a crutch I need, and 
that's OK."

Ignorance is not only bliss, it's probably fattening. 
</P>
<P>
And full of salt and cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
We all know that we should not eat anything that we like, and absolutely never 
anything that trickles grease down our arms. 
</P>
<P>
But when the dreaded Mac Attack hits, we are powerless over our weakness. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of Mrs. Gooch, three people in Arleta and a dwindling sect in Lancaster 
that doesn't believe in eating at all, most of us commit dietary sins of 
omission and commission with stunning regularity. 
</P>
<P>
Take nutritionally aware Nanette Rubio of Valencia, who is, for the most part, 
into bran and veggies.

Ask her what she likes about Don Cuco in Canyon Country or Newhall and it's the 
great globs of fattening yummies that they stuff into their designer tortillas.

No, no, Nanette, but don't despair. There's help on the horizon. The Institute 
of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences has recommended that 
restaurants should have nutrition information on menu items available for 
patrons on request, which should give some of us pause when we are about to dig 
in. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, however, is not being met with universal delight at local eateries. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to stay up nights thinking up this crazy stuff to harass us," said 
Betty Travis, co-owner of the Egg Plantation in Newhall, which boasts a menu of 
101 omelets. 
</P>
<P>
Travis said she couldn't even imagine how she would try to figure out the salt, 
fat and sugar content of her omelets. Particularly the cherry pie and cream 
cheese omelet. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, places that serve a lot of cold green or whole grain food will 
embrace this recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Even places like the Szechwan Inn in Canoga Park and the Woodland Hills 
Marriott Hotel's Parkside Restaurant won't be too upset since they are already 
offering fine fare for the finicky, according to Dr. David Cohen of Woodland 
Hills, a veteran of the Pritikin program and a fervent fat-fighter. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, 77, who will celebrate his 53rd wedding anniversary this month, says he 
doesn't have any trouble dining well and healthfully these days. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of restaurants that list nutritional information on the menu 
already," he said, "and others that make a point of cooking food in a healthy 
way that's good for you." 
</P>
<P>
The Fatburger is not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Neither is Angelina's Kitchen Table. 
</P>
<P>
"We have food that nourishes the soul, which is why it's called soul food," 
said Cordie Moss, who owns the Sherman Oaks restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Up at Pancake Heaven in San Fernando, owner John Lamprino, who has been in 
business 30 years, says he's not sure that people want to know all that 
nutritional stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wouldn't know how to come up with that kind of information, anyway," 
Lamprino said. "And once I did, I don't know what people who want to eat 
pancakes would do with it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

<P>
Since 1968, Martine Colette and her animal activists have provided a home and 
hospital care for abused, orphaned, abandoned and unwanted wild and/or exotic 
animals at the Wildlife Waystation in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the animal population reaches 800 and includes African lions, 
cougars, jaguars, black bears, raccoons, ocelots, timber wolves, coyotes, 
opossums, brown bears, foxes, bobcats, margays, owls, hawks, Siberian tigers, 
Bengal tigers, leopards, monkeys, apes and a variety of other beasts. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after 20 years of helping these animals in a quiet way, Colette is turning 
into a showoff. 
</P>
<P>
She and a group of her flying, fuzzy, furry and crawly friends -- including a 
California gray fox, a hawk, a black wolf, a civet cat, a chimp and a 12-foot 
python -- showed up at Tarzana Regional Medical Center recently to visit 
third-grade students from Wilbur Avenue School. 
</P>
<P>
The children and the animals looked at each other and communicated the way kids 
and animals seem able to do. And, according to Colette, the children learned 
why it is not appropriate to have wild or exotic animals for pets, which was 
the point of the exercise. 
</P>
<P>
The medical center, a benefactor of the organization, sponsored the 
get-together. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Arnold Zukow, chief of pediatric medicine, said Diana Hariton, a Wildlife 
Waystation volunteer and daughter of staff physician Theodore Hariton, told her 
father that the station needed medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, the center was closing Rancho Encino Hospital and had some 
supplies that it was willing to donate. 
</P>
<P>
"The timing was perfect and the center was really happy to enter into what has 
become an ongoing relationship," Zukow said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Back to the Past 
</P>
<P>
It seems to be the current fashion to build immodestly grand houses on 
modest-sized lots. 
</P>
<P>
New houses in the Santa Clarita, Simi and San Fernando valleys have started 
looking as if they were put on steroids after they were sized for their resting 
places. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot of all of this is that the green is going, something we will 
probably live to regret. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have warned us that the less greenery you have and the more 
people and buildings and cars there are inhabiting any given area, the worse 
the air is going to be and the higher the temperature is going to go. 
</P>
<P>
It can only follow that those of us who choose to live in cheek-by-jowl 
neighborhoods become so bummed out by the noise, heat, bad air quality and the 
"close-proximity blues" that we go in our great big houses, pull down the 
designer blinds and crank up the air. 
</P>
<P>
"Brown out," Mother Nature groans. 
</P>
<P>
There must be another way. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, there is, and the folks building houses in the early 1800s had it 
figured out. 
</P>
<P>
They got a piece of land in the middle of nowhere, coaxed up a few scrub oaks, 
some crops and water-saving plants, and built adobes with seven-foot-thick 
walls. You can forget the air conditioning. They didn't need it. 
</P>
<P>
On the next really hot 'n' smoggy one, you should bicycle over to the San 
Fernando Mission Church -- an exact replica of the 1804 structure that was 
destroyed in the 1971 Sylmar earthquake -- and sit in those buildings that 
never lose their cool. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dr. Carcare 
</P>
<P>
October is National Car Month, according to the Automobile Club of Southern 
California. And the club is doing a booming business with its handy Mobile 
Engine Diagnosis (MED), said Robert Blacketor, district manager of the Woodland 
Hills office. 
</P>
<P>
MED is a combination automotive electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram that 
checks a car's electrical and fuel systems. The diagnostic unit is housed in a 
special van that the Auto Club drives from office to office around Southern 
California. Card-carrying members can call the nearest office to make an 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
The van is at the Van Nuys office every week on either Monday or Wednesday, but 
there are no openings until Wednesday. The checkups are also available at the 
Northridge office Oct. 29, the Woodland Hills office Oct. 31 and the Burbank 
office Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
The checkup takes 30 minutes and costs $34. For that, you get a printout of the 
MED findings that you may then take to a mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
What happens after that is up to you, your mechanic and your banker.

BARGAINS: FREDDIE KRUEGER, BATMAN HOLD HALLOWEEN EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood continues to dominate the field in Halloween costumes, with Freddie 
Krueger and Batman characters as the top runners in this year's costume race. 
</P>
<P>
The entertainment industry almost has a total hold on the costume choices of 
children and grown-ups alike this year. 
</P>
<P>
Costume shop managers estimate that the biggest sellers for the younger set 
this season will be Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles. 
</P>
<P>
John Tolson of Magic World, the San Fernando Valley's largest source of weird 
and wild get-ups, has a solid inventory of Ninja Turtle outfits ranging from 
$9.95 for a single mask to $19.95 to $28.97 for a complete outfit. 
</P>
<P>
Magic World, 10122 Topanga Canyon Blvd., Chatsworth, (818-700-8100) is 
predicting that the cartoon Simpsons will run a close second. Bart, Homer and 
Marge latex heads cost $35, which may seem high, but since the costume is 
completed with everyday attire, the head is all that's needed to play the role. 
</P>
<P>
For adults, Magic World has a good quality Dick Tracy hat and coat, which rent 
for $45; if you want to add shoes, pants, tie, etc., the ensemble is $85. 
</P>
<P>
The gory look is always hot on Halloween night. Heads of Freddie Krueger -- 
from the "Nightmare on Elm Street" films -- are $12.95, and a new entry, a 
latex head of Michael Myers -- from the "Halloween" films -- is $39.95. 
</P>
<P>
Little girls still like to look pretty, and so the Little Mermaid costumes are 
expected to be big sellers this year. Magic World has one for $44.95, complete 
with fins and shells, on top of a leotard. Clever mothers can probably come up 
with a good facsimile. A wig is an extra $12.95. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's Beautilities in West Los Angeles has a wide range of costumes at 
good prices. The complete Little Mermaid costume here starts at $22.95, and the 
bright red wig sells for $12 to $25. The owner, Belle Fisher, says Batman is 
still in demand (at $14.50) and Superman (at $16.95) still captures the 
imaginations of the little ones. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's has the Dick Tracy outfits plus the latex heads of all the Tracy 
gang -- Mumbles, Pruneface, Flattop, etc. -- for $45. Robinson's Beautilities 
has a good supply of costume makeup on sale right now from 50 cents to $2.95. 
Robinson's is at 12320 Venice Blvd., West Los Angeles; (213) 398-5757. 
</P>
<P>
For grown-ups who are still in the Halloween swing, the Center Theatre Group 
Costume Shop offers rental costumes from productions staged at the Music Center 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
High on the list of requests certainly will be the Phantom of the Opera 
costumes. The masks are for sale at $6, and if your closet holds a cape and 
hat, you've got a deal. If not, you can rent the cape and hat for $50 and the 
whole suit for $75. Almost all the costumes from Shelley Duval's "Faerie Tale 
Theatre" productions are available for rent for that special party, for $40 to 
$150. Nothing for the small fry here, but what a place to get in the dress-up 
mood! The address is 3301 E. 14th St., Los Angeles; (213) 267-1230.

NEW 'MIKADO': PRETTY BUT TOOK NO CHANCES

COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last time we saw the D'Oyly Carte Opera, at the Greek Theatre back in 1976, 
the once illustrious purveyors of a noble British tradition had fallen upon 
hard times. Sorry their lot. 
</P>
<P>
The beloved inventions of Gilbert and Sullivan were becoming empty rituals. The 
</P>
<P>
productions looked threadbare. With amplification adding sonic insult to vocal 
injury, the music sounded raucous. 
</P>
<P>
The best singing actors had fled the poverty-stricken touring company. Their 
replacements seemed dutiful at best, somnolent at worst. 
</P>
<P>
The passing years weighed heavily. Everyone was saddened, but no one was 
surprised when, in 1982, the D'Oyly Carte curtain came down for what threatened 
to be the last time. 
</P>
<P>
Yet all was not lost. Six years later, a brighter, younger, more venturesome 
D'Oyly Carte rose like a cheery phoenix from the Savoyard ashes. Tuesday night, 
as part of the Festival of Britain at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 
the reconstituted troupe made its U.S. debut. 
</P>
<P>
Modified rapture. 
</P>
<P>
It may be worth noting that the first works mustered in England by the New 
D'Oyly Carte -- "Iolanthe" and "Yeomen of the Guard" -- were not selected from 
the Greatest Hit list. For festive Costa Mesa, however, the repertory choices 
-- "Mikado" and "Pirates of Penzance" -- turned out to be needlessly, 
embarrassingly conservative. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
Because, according to a high-ranking, seemingly misguided company spokesman, 
"the repertoire is better known on the East Coast than on the West Coast." 
</P>
<P>
"This area," he added, "has probably not got the same basic, intrinsic audience 
for the works. . . . Maybe if we'd gone to New York or the East Coast . . . we 
could be more adventurous." 
</P>
<P>
Our British benefactors evidently do not know that Sol Hurok used to bring the 
entire D'Oyly Carte repertory to Southern California, that the Music Center 
Opera imported Jonathan Miller's perversion of "Mikado" not too long ago, that 
the Joseph Papp smear of "Pirates" had a long and successful run here, that 
Richard Sheldon's enlightened Opera a la Carte plays up and down the state, and 
that high schools and summer camps even in deepest, darkest Orange County 
regularly stage their own "Mikados" and "Pirates." 
</P>
<P>
It would have been nice to get away from "Tit Willow" and the modern 
major-general for a change. Still, we must be grateful for familiar favors, so 
long as they are tasteful and charming. 
</P>
<P>
The new "Mikado" certainly deserved those adjectives. It took no chances, dared 
make no original statements, shifted no perspectives. It played down the 
comedy, banished the most predictable routines, and neglected most 
opportunities for dancing. But it did play up the music, and it did look 
pretty. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it did respect theatrical impulses that both the composer and the 
librettist might have recognized. Drastic updating was deemed inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 staging, now attributed to Christopher Webber, strikes cautious poses. 
It avoids superfluous movement and distrusts caricature. It lets the text tell 
most of the jokes, and, luckily, the jokes are still good. This is a valid, 
timidly effective approach. 
</P>
<P>
Eileen Diss' pastel sets depict neatly stylized mock-Japanese vistas. Jessica 
Gwynne's costumes second the muted scenic motions. 
</P>
<P>
John Pryce-Jones conducts with reasonable finesse. He favors brisk tempos for 
just about everything except the patter songs -- in which he obviously values 
intelligibility over frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
The cast is more notable for teamwork than for star turns. Eric Roberts, the 
spry but hardly elfin Ko-Ko, wears a funny hat, mugs endearingly, savors the 
text and sings -- really sings -- the music. John Ayldon, who succeeded the 
unforgettable Donald Adams as the Mikado during the final seasons of the old 
D'Oyly Carte, turns up here as a crisp, properly haughty if hardly overwhelming 
Pooh-Bah. 
</P>
<P>
The Mikado, in turn, becomes the property of a dour, booming-basso giant named 
Michael Ducarel. Incidentally, he eschews the usual blood-curdling laugh. Susan 
Gorton -- a real, British-oratorio contralto -- complements him as a generous, 
matronly Katisha capable of gallon-jug chest tones. 
</P>
<P>
The silly young lovers are nicely sketched, though not very sensuously sung. 
David Fieldsend plays a mildly impetuous Nanki-Poo to the moderately coy 
Yum-Yum of Sandra Dugdale. 
</P>
<P>
The supporting cast is deft. Paul Parfitt introduces a Pish-Tush who emulates 
Pooh-Bah (a bizarre program note informs us, by the way, that he also sings 
"Pere Germont in 'Rigoletto' "!). Thora Ker as Pitti-Sing and Yvonne Patrick 
(Peep-Bo) are bright not-so-little girls from school. 
</P>
<P>
Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
Words and music projected easily in the 2,994-seat house, even though the 
management turned off the microphones. If the acoustics are good enough for 
"Mikado," the acoustics must be good enough for "Fledermaus." 
</P>
<P>
In his catalogue aria, Ko-Ko griped about yuppies, car phones and various 
industrial imports from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
When Nanki-Poo went abroad, his reported destination turned out to be Balboa 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Lord High Executioner, the citizens of the town of Titipu 
share at least one problem with their hapless American counterparts: a 
so-called budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Encores are outlawed by the New D'Oyly Carte. The custom of interpolating 
topical references, however, lives on.

CYNICISM UNDERLIES ARTIST MARK HERESY'S HERESIES; 
</P>
<P>
ART: EXHIBITS IN LAGUNA BEACH AND HOLLYWOOD DISPLAY THE SATIRIC STYLE OF THE 
MAN WHO CALLS HIMSELF A CULTURAL SABOTEUR.

<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Heresy says he hates art. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, people call him an artist. His work is displayed in art galleries and 
museums, and much of it has been purchased by art connoisseurs. 
</P>
<P>
But Heresy sees himself as not so much an artist as a cultural saboteur. 
</P>
<P>
Although skilled and formally trained in the finer techniques of visual art, he 
has concentrated much of his creative effort on, for example, constructing 
donation boxes, such as the ones seen in the lobbies of offices seeking 
contributions for a charitable cause or to a Christmas party fund. 
</P>
<P>
Heresy's donation boxes hang from the walls of galleries instead of offices but 
serve a similar purpose. As typewritten signs above some of the boxes explain, 
Heresy is a young, struggling artist who needs money. And he's asking you, the 
art patron, to give generously. 
</P>
<P>
Heresy's devotees call these boxes revolutionary art. His critics call them 
sophomoric tripe. Whichever camp you choose to side with, Heresy welcomes -- 
and encourages -- your response. 
</P>
<P>
He has, in fact, fashioned yet another pair of boxes to elicit responses from 
gallery-hoppers: Those viewing his current exhibit at the Zero One Gallery here 
are asked to vote whether they think "Mark Heresy is God" or "Mark Heresy is an 
(adjective deleted)." 
</P>
<P>
And, while casting your ballot, you're advised that for "only $75" you may join 
either the Church of Mark Heresy or the Committee to Stop Mark Heresy Because 
He is an (adjective deleted). 
</P>
<P>
The way Heresy sees it, a vote to stop him is at least as valuable as one to 
elevate him to godhead. "If people are neutral to you as an artist, you're 
forgotten. But if you can get them to hate you a lot or love you a lot," you're 
OK, says the 25-year-old Los Angeles resident while looking over his Zero One 
installation, called "Can You Spare Any Change?" 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the boxes, like many of his works, are dripping with satire. But 
Heresy, as his pseudonym suggests, also aims to challenge and undermine 
conventional thinking. Even a cursory examination of his work reveals his 
attempts to rattle the foundation of traditional American values, politics, 
corporatism and symbolic patriotism. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate exhibit titled "Flags," now being shown at the Laguna Art Museum, 
he has created a series of American flag replicas from such materials as red, 
white and blue toilet paper, cut currency, beer cans, human hair and dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the pieces uses the nation's symbol of freedom to make a statement 
about the peculiar ways in which Heresy sees American freedom manifesting and 
contradicting itself, through militarism, consumerism and greed. 
</P>
<P>
(One of his flags -- "Freedom of the Press," made from porno magazine 
photographs -- was not taken by the museum for the exhibit. Heresy says the 
piece is an attempt to illustrate that America purports to stand for freedom 
yet institutionalizes censorship.) 
</P>
<P>
His intention with all the flags, he says, is to force the viewer to re-examine 
his or her conditioned response to the Stars and Stripes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so strange. People have this allegiance, this obedience to this flag. I 
think of all these tough Marines . . . being cowered into submission by a 
little strip of fabric. That's a lot of power for a fabric to have." 
</P>
<P>
To underscore his point, Heresy is working on a final addition to his series of 
flags, one constructed of whips, leather and other sado-masochistic 
paraphernalia. "There really is this S&amp;M dominance thing with the flag," he 
explains. "People are almost wanting to be dominated by a thing, and they 
choose to be dominated by an icon -- an icon which represents an ideology." 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the same sort of cynicism with which he attacks American 
conservatism, Heresy's flags, donation boxes and collages of pop-culture 
artifacts also seek to subvert established approaches to rebellion and art -- 
the very modes within which he works. 
</P>
<P>
He is not only laughing along with the artists and radicals at the hypocrisy 
they see in mainstream society. He is laughing at them -- and himself as well. 
</P>
<P>
For example, with his "assignment pieces," in which he requests that patrons 
buy him lunch or give him him new ideas for future works, Heresy says he is 
only half-kidding. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't come here expecting me to give something to you, as artists are 
traditionally supposed to do," he says. "I'm trying to destroy some of the 
meaning you're already carrying with you (into an art gallery). I try to absorb 
the audience, so a person can leave this space . . . with a little less 
baggage. Maybe you saw something here that upset you, but at least you left 
with a little less baggage." 
</P>
<P>
Although trained at Otis Parsons art school and the California Institute for 
the Arts, Heresy says he has little interest in revered artists throughout 
history. In fact, he has fashioned paintings that mock the canonization of such 
artists as Jasper Johns. 
</P>
<P>
"I like very few so-called artists," he says, almost boastfully. Among the few 
exceptions, he says, are Mike Kelly, Jeffrey Vallance, Robert Williams and Haim 
Steinbach -- his main artistic idol -- who skewed Andy Warhol's approach to 
pop-culture-as-art by creating art pieces comprised of shelves of common 
household items. 
</P>
<P>
But Heresy said his deeper influences lean more toward the late French 
philosopher Michel Foucault, Abbie Hoffman, Malcolm X, Mad Magazine and punk 
rock. He "grew up in the slam pits of L.A." and says that former Dead Kennedys 
singer Jello Biafra "is one of the first artists who really kicked me in the 
head." 
</P>
<P>
One of his chief concerns, he says, is art's economic structure. "There is very 
little support within an economic structure to develop new ways of thinking or 
perceiving. I can't take my paintings to a grocery store and say, hey, can I 
have food for a week? . . . There is no market (for new art) until you enter 
into another economic structure, which is the art market: the art schools, art 
galleries (and) art magazines that make up this art culture." 
</P>
<P>
Support from the National Endowment for the Arts is not a viable alternative, 
he says. Even before the stipulation was attached to grants that an artist will 
not produce work that the agency might consider obscene, Heresy said he would 
never consider accepting NEA funding. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like getting a check from mom. (Recipients) will start to cater no matter 
what." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps his most ardent disdain, however, is reserved for art critics. He says 
he pays no attention to critical assessment of his works, whether positive or 
negative. He says his work, and indeed "the character of Mark Heresy that I 
have created," are set up to alienate the art critic. 
</P>
<P>
"An art critic has an agenda, (based upon) the way he thinks," Heresy says. "He 
goes around and he tries to find someone to use as a springboard that supports 
his ideas. Whether he puts down your work or praises it, all he's doing is 
using this work to reinforce something he believes." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Heresy shows no sign of muzzling his beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
The working title for his next exhibit: "Tolerate This Because It's Art, and 
Patronize Me Because I'm an Artist."

Coming to Court: Eddie Murphy faces yet another plagiarism lawsuit in 
connection with Paramount Pictures' "Coming to America." 
</P>
<P>
Prince Johnny Osseni-Bello, a self-proclaimed Nigerian prince and 
actor-producer, is seeking $100 million in damages, charging that his 1983 
screenplay "Toto, the African Prince" (co-written with Shelby M. Gregory) was 
actually the inspiration for the Murphy movie. Last week, Murphy's attorney 
sought to dismiss the action but a Los Angeles Superior Court judge refused to 
dismiss it. Osseni-Bello said that he knows Murphy and in 1982 told him about 
his idea. Co-writer Gregory filed his own copyright lawsuit against Murphy in 
1988 seeking $10 million in damages. CLAUDIA PUIG

No More Mural for Cos: Bill Cosby has removed a colorful mural shown during the 
opening title credits of "The Cosby Show" in a dispute with a teacher whose 
Harlem students inspired the artwork. The snit involves a mural painted on a 
Harlem building by children at the Creative Arts Workshop for Homeless Children 
and a similar painting shown on the top-rated NBC series. 
</P>
<P>
Workshop director Brookie Maxwell said that the children who painted the 
original should get credit on the TV show and be paid if the idea is marketed. 
NBC spokeswoman Rosemary O'Brien said that two months of negotiations between 
the workshop and the show's producer, Carsey-Werner Co., failed when Maxwell 
"threatened" Cosby on Tuesday. Cosby released this statement on Wednesday: "I 
am deeply disappointed in that I had such high hopes for raising the spirits of 
the children with this mural. This would have been something that for another 
10 years they could have pointed to with pride in that this was something they 
inspired." Viewers tonight( will see revised opening credits with footage used 
last season. CLAUDIA PUIG

CONTRABAND ADDRESSES BORDERS THROUGH DANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The dictionary describes the word contraband as smuggled merchandise. Sara 
Shelton Mann had something similar in mind when she chose the name for the 
dance-performance group she founded in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, I was working on both sides of the border -- Canada and the 
United States -- and, every time I came across the border, I thought of the 
hidden nature of performance," Mann said in a telephone interview. "I was 
working with two Americans and two Canadians, and I kept thinking: What kind of 
creative contraband am I holding back when I cross those boundaries? Who do 
these ideas really belong to? Am I taking contraband from one country to the 
other?" 
</P>
<P>
Mann conceived Contraband as a collaborative "life-art laboratory." The work 
under scrutiny in this artistic experiment juxtaposes live theatrical forms of 
dance, music, and drama. Mann's laboratory has since moved from its home base 
in Canada to San Francisco, where she formed a new incarnation of Contraband in 
1980. According to Mann, the company's artistic focus remains constant to this 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still dealing with the question of crossing boundaries -- who we are, 
and who we think we are," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight through through Saturday, Contraband will perform at 8 p.m. at Sushi 
performance space downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Like "The (Invisible) War," -- the last Contraband offering to be seen in San 
Diego -- Mann's newest work, "Mira, Cycle I," is a full-length, multimedia 
production that combines elements of dance, music, poetry and narrative. 
However, "Mira" is much more complex in its storytelling, with two parallel 
tales. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the culmination of my history, and I feel like trying to erase my 
history," Mann said of this intensely personal, autobiographical work. "It's 
the beginning of the cycle. 'Mira II' will deal more directly with some of 
these issues. But, when I found a book of poems on the life of a 16th-Century 
Indian ecstatic poet named Mirabai (a devotee of the Indian god Krishna), I 
knew I had to work with them." 
</P>
<P>
The mythical evocations are intercut with shocking monologues from Mann's 
numbing experiences as a girl in Tennessee. Rape, abortions and emotional 
indifference are among the recurring themes in this unusual work. It's a 
multifaceted performance piece that Mann suggests "all bring us to the same 
place.' 
</P>
<P>
"Mira" has a funny side as well, Mann said. "I wish, I wish I could do a 
serious piece. But these people are just very funny, and very gregarious. 
There's definitely humor there." 
</P>
<P>
Contraband's soul-searching questions are sung and spoken by the performers, 
and expressed in body language, Mann said. They also are echoed in the musical 
accompaniment designed by Jules Beckman and Norman Rutherford. 
</P>
<P>
"We have fantastic instruments," she said. "The American culture has taken so 
much from India and Africa, and some of the instruments are strange. But you 
won't recognize this as Indian music or post-modern dance. We've moved away 
from abstractions and more toward meaning -- from loud to resonant." 
</P>
<P>
The harsh lighting treatment supplied by Jack Carpenter and Elaine Buckholtz 
may suffer somewhat in the bare-bones environment of Sushi's "white space." 
But, Mann said, "we try to cooperate with the space. The piece is built for a 
large theater, and we won't have as much set, but we'll have more intimacy at 
Sushi."

MIDEAST SETTING OBSCURES 'OTHELLO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There's been punk Shakespeare, cowboy Shakespeare, even extraterrestrial 
Shakespeare. Now, at Fullerton College, there's Persian Gulf Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
Director Tom Blank has taken "Othello," that wrenching epiphany of jealousy and 
vengeance, and tossed it into a militaristic Middle East framework. It's not 
Kuwait that's been invaded, but Cyprus, prompting an infusion of American 
soldiers to protect imperialist interests. 
</P>
<P>
The vain Othello is now a brigadier general; his wife, Desdemona, is the 
daughter of a Southern U.S. senator. Treacherous Iago deals drugs in every 
barrack with the help of cocaine-snorting Roderigo. Most of the men wear combat 
camouflage, except for Roderigo, who's partial to "Miami Vice" duds. 
</P>
<P>
In this age of conceptual Shakespeare, the trend is toward experimentation and 
license, which aren't such bad things. If the idea is grounded by Shakespeare's 
original intent and keeps faith with the characters, then why not? Modern ideas 
for modern times. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble with Blank's sweeping revision is the scale of the situation to 
which he turns for inspiration. By citing the Middle East, and with his barely 
disguised references to Iraq and Kuwait, Blank creates a backdrop so loaded 
with associations that the gist of "Othello" is obscured. 
</P>
<P>
The machinations of Iago and the succumbing of Othello wind up seeming like 
minor human folly. The concept threatens to swallow the characters. 
</P>
<P>
To Blank's credit, the production did seem to hold the primarily college-age 
audience at a recent performance. This "Othello" may not have included all the 
shading that a Shakespeare purist might like, but its bold imagery seemed to 
entertain, and the applause was loud at play's end. 
</P>
<P>
GIs dancing at a smoky disco with miniskirted hookers, contrasted with devout 
Muslims supplicating at sunset, helped create visual interest, even if it 
ultimately seemed gratuitous. Rex Heuschkel's abstractly pillared set and Bob 
Jensen's gauzy lighting are dramatically designed. 
</P>
<P>
So are the performances, but not always with the refinement found on the 
technical side. Shakespeare may be the toughest assignment even for the best 
students, and the toil of the challenge is clear throughout the cast. Paul 
Hagerty's Iago is interesting, though, mainly for the enthusiasm in his 
wild-eyed nastiness. 
</P>
<P>
Cress Williams also gets wild-eyed as Othello, especially when jealousy begins 
to reign in his house. But the portrayal doesn't go beyond the obvious, and 
Williams tends to overact. All his emotions are on the outside; it's difficult 
to connect with Othello's internal struggle. 
</P>
<P>
'OTHELLO' 
</P>
<P>
A Fullerton College production of William Shakespeare's tragedy. Directed by 
Tom Blank. With Paul Hagerty, Jeff Weeks, Barney Evans, Bradley A. Whitfield, 
Chris Molloy, Robert Nunez, Cress Williams, Karl Schott, Saadia Billman, Jose 
Amado Lavarreda, Lydia Dunn and Susana Garcia. Set by Rex Heuschkel. Lighting 
by Bob Jensen. Sound by Chris Molloy. Costumes by Charlotte Stratton. Plays 
Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. at the Campus Theatre, 321 
E. Chapman Ave., Fullerton. Tickets: $5 to $7. (714) 871-8101.

BELLSON LEADS ALL-STAR QUINTET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because most of Louie Bellson's Los Angeles appearances are made at the helm of 
a full orchestra, his six-day stand this week at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill in 
Hollywood is something special, with the virtuosic drummer leading an all-star 
quintet. 
</P>
<P>
For his front line he wisely chose Pete Christlieb, whose tenor saxophone has 
been a vocal point of the larger Bellson groups since 1967, and trumpeter Conte 
Candoli, who like Christlieb is moonlighting from the "Tonight Show." 
</P>
<P>
Their opener was the old Charlie Parker riff "Now's the Time," not the most 
demanding of themes, but a good enough point of departure for some brisk blues 
blowing by all hands. 
</P>
<P>
It was an opportunity to appreciate Bellson's rhythm section partners: Andy 
Simpkins, a bass player with phenomenal technique and ideas to spare, and Frank 
Strazzeri, one of the most dependable of the Southland's bop-based pianists. 
</P>
<P>
A muted Candoli tackled "Darn That Dream" with appropriate delicacy, after 
which all five men dealt with the demanding tempo of "Shaw Nuff," a tune that 
virtually launched the be-bop era. Christlieb and Candoli met the challenge of 
the speedway pace, limning the tricky melody as if joined at the chops. Bellson 
used this as his own showcase in a fiery finale to the set, which he dedicated 
to the memory of Art Blakey. LEONARD FEATHER

THEATER REVIEW 'BENT'; 
</P>
<P>
STARK SHOT; 
</P>
<P>
HARD-HITTING CONCENTRATION CAMP DRAMA DISPLAYS THE INTENSITY OF THE PLAZA 
PLAYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lust, sex and love figure strongly in Martin Sherman's "Bent," but trust, 
fidelity and betrayal combine to form the strongest images. First produced in 
1979 and a 1980 Tony nominee as best drama, the play is Plaza Players' current 
production. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a fine example of the kind of intense, dramatic theater that often 
distinguishes the Ventura-based company from other local community theater 
groups. Sherman has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, 
but the subject matter here would guarantee the author and director Michael 
Maynez places on Sen. Jesse Helms' hit list. 
</P>
<P>
The play opens in a Berlin apartment; it's 1934, and the terrors of the Third 
Reich are becoming increasingly apparent to members of the city's gay 
community, including a small-time operator named Max and his lover, Rudy. 
Homosexuals were one of the many groups singled out for persecution under 
Hitler, and Max and Rudy quickly find themselves among the victims on June 24, 
"The Night of the Long Knives." 
</P>
<P>
By the beginning of the second act, Max is a prisoner at Dachau, disguised as a 
Jew to avoid what he believes to be the even harsher treatment he'd receive if 
his sexual preference was discovered by prison officials. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever else its merits, "Bent" is not the feel-good hit of the fall season; 
the subject matter is unremittingly grim, and the climax is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a very good play; it's heavy-handed in its polemics and awkwardly 
crafted. The second act is virtually a two-man discourse, more reminiscent at 
times of "Who's on First?" than of Samuel Beckett as the author probably 
intended. And perhaps it depends too much on an audience that's already 
sympathetic -- Sherman's description of the sex act is graphic enough to be 
off-putting, though the most graphic scene of all is one of the play's most 
inspired moments. 
</P>
<P>
"Bent" is an important play, however; it's important in its serious treatment 
of a formerly taboo subject and as a pioneering effort to bring such subject 
matter to Broadway. Noble intentions were what probably earned it that Tony 
nomination; the more uplifting "Children of a Lesser God" won the award. 
</P>
<P>
The tragedy is not always deeply dramatic: The first act plays more like a 
farce until a pair of SS officers shows up to disturb the mood, and there's 
some ironic wit in the prison scenes as well -- humor that helps round out the 
characters and makes their fate even more disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh McManigal is impressive as Max, a role originated by Ian McKellen in 
London and developed by Richard Gere when the play moved to Broadway. As the 
effeminate dancer, Rudy, Larry Gund creates an amusing character who takes on 
deeper dimensions as the play progresses. James D. Thompson plays Horst, a 
prisoner who does not deny his homosexuality; and Alan Price plays Greta, a 
straight man who headlines a drag show in which Rudy occasionally dances. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the supporting characters are played with less distinction, though 
Sherman's stark dialogue doesn't really invite or encourage richly dramatic 
readings. Clipped delivery, on the other hand, sometimes sounds a bit 
ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
"Bent" plays at 8 p.m. Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays through Nov. 24 at the 
Plaza Players Theater, 34 N. Palm St. (in the Old Town Livery courtyard) in 
Ventura. Tickets are $6 on Wednesdays, $7.50 on Fridays and $8.50 on Saturdays.

Leo Downey (The Ketch, 514 State St., Santa Barbara, 564-3231) Tonight, Leo's 
band will be a trio, and find out why he has more female fans than anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Children's Day, Far Cry (The Pub, UCSB, Isla Vista) Is this what education is 
all about -- new music at the bar on campus? 
</P>
<P>
FRIDAY 
</P>
<P>
Urban Dread (Charlie's, 362 California St., Ventura, 648-6688) Industrial 
strength comes to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Cotton, Leo Downey (Ventura Theatre, 26 S. Chesnut St., Ventura, 648-1888) 
Cotton used to be in Poco; Downey is still from Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Mojo (Ojai Art Center, 113 S. Montgomery St., 646-0117) This is going to be 
some sort of rain dance. Who knows if that'll work, but the hardest-working 
blues band from Thousand Oaks will create plenty of their own moisture-sweaty 
dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer the Gardener (The Ketch) Santa Barbara pop rock at its finest -- also 
the evening's best party. If you're a first-timer, chances are excellent you'll 
buy both of Spencer's tapes. 
</P>
<P>
SATURDAY 
</P>
<P>
Leo Downey Band (The Ketch) Doesn't this guy ever stay home? 
</P>
<P>
Modern English (The Pub) English pop rockers still milking their first hit "I 
Melt With You." Nothing wrong with that. 
</P>
<P>
SUNDAY 
</P>
<P>
Urban Dread (Eric Ericcson's, Seward and the beach, Ventura, 643-4783) These 
reggae rockers are taking their act south, a couple of miles down the beach. 
</P>
<P>
MONDAY 
</P>
<P>
Leo Downey Band (Charlie's) Yup, it's him again. Buy his two CDs -- give this 
man a day off. 
</P>
<P>
The Pontiax (Alexander's, 1050 Schooner Drive, Ventura, 658-2000) Perhaps the 
best blues band on the West Coast provides the soundtrack for this Blue Monday 
presentation. 
</P>
<P>
TUESDAY 
</P>
<P>
Plato's Cat (Charlie's) Feeling philosophical? Like cats? Never mind, it's more 
Ventura pop rock. 
</P>
<P>
Oingo Boingo (Santa Barbara County Bowl, 1122 N. Milpas St., 966-2727) Oingo 
Boingo brings its quirky rhythms to the tree-lined bowl -- once again, no Tracy 
Chapman covers, just plenty of maniacs dancing as if their shoes were on fire. 
</P>
<P>
WEDNESDAY 
</P>
<P>
Michael On Fire (Hungry Hunter, 487 N. Moorpark Road, Thousand Oaks, 497-3925) 
Is it folk blues, folk rock or what? 
</P>
<P>
Spencer the Gardener, Nothing (Hornblower's, 1559 Spinnaker Drive, Ventura, 
658-2202) A new venue for local bands! Spencer and Brad Nack (the Something of 
Nothing) used to be partners in the ultimate Santa Barbara power-pop rock band, 
the Tan. So much for history lessons. BILL LOCEY

Los Angeles, New York, Austin, Minneapolis, London, Manchester are all cities 
with a vibrant, happening rock music scene. Maybe Ventura and Santa Barbara 
should be added to the list. There's plenty of good bands in the area -- Raging 
Arb &amp; the Redheads, the Mudheads, the I-Rails, Durango 95, the Lion I's, 
Something for Nothing, Expression, Spencer the Gardener, the Leo Downey Band, 
Toad the Wet Sprocket, and the like. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Toad, these bands have a grand total of zero videos on MTV, yet they 
deserve at least three-quarters of the money earned by all those shrieky, 
"foofoo-hair" bands. 
</P>
<P>
Rock 'n' roll, talent and justice have about as much in common as Frisbees and 
cats, and make about as much sense as changing the National Anthem to the 
"Peter Gunn Theme" then letting a polka band perform it. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, this week's happening local pop rock/folk rock/what- the-heck band is 
none other than those philosophical feline fanciers, Plato's Cat. Like the 
other local bands, the trio's first album is a tape, the recently released 
"Taking a Ride." And as far as bands with funny names go, Plato's Cat holds its 
own. "We stole the name off some comedy album," bass player and singer Dave 
Girtsman said. "I don't even know who it is, but we all laughed when we heard 
it."

For most local bands, the number of local venues is rather limited -- in 
Ventura, there's Charlie's, Charlie's, oh, and Charlie's, where the group plays 
Tuesdays. Recently, Hornblower's added a local night, but the Ventura Theatre 
remains a tough place to get into for locals. There's a few places in Santa 
Barbara, otherwise, it's the garage. "We like Ventura," Girtsman said, adding 
that Santa Barbara hasn't "a lot of venues up there for us." 
</P>
<P>
So, for the one-album, oops, one-tape rock band, it's not all gorgeous groupies 
or record companies giving away dump-truck loads of money. "People don't 
realize how long a band has to practice before you actually see them onstage," 
Girtsman said. 
</P>
<P>
"For every hour we play, we've probably practiced four hours. And there's 
nothing like playing until 2 a.m. then getting up at six to go to work -- or 
getting paid 10 bucks and having a 20-buck bar tab. Maybe we just do it for the 
endless supply of women we wish we had." 
</P>
<P>
Plato's Cat music is your basic pop rock featuring some swell harmonies by 
Girtsman and guitarist Brad Altavilla. Drummer Randy Cunningham is the third 
member. Altavilla and Cunningham, both from Santa Barbara, started the band, 
then recruited Girtsman, their Ventura connection. 
</P>
<P>
They were once a quartet, but for the past month have been a trio. It hasn't 
seemed to have hurt them much. Plato's Cat doesn't have as many hooks as hell 
raiser, but it's close. The title tune is the sort that lives on and on in your 
head. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say our music is diverse, sort of hard-edged; we're willing to do anything 
as long as it has a polka beat," Girtsman said, tongue firmly in cheek. "Hey, 
we're good, we're entertaining. And if you come to see us, we'll give you a 
dollar." 
</P>
<P>
Plato's Cat performs Tuesday nights at Charlie's during October, thus becoming 
the musical antidote for "Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
But do they want Bon Jovi's money or even the house he gave away on MTV? "We 
just want to play good music that's not cheesy," Girtsman said. "We're not in 
it for the money; that's out of the question. No one even knows who we are. 
Personally, I want to grow as a songwriter, and besides, you can't go wrong for 
two bucks. You can't even rent a movie for two bucks these days."

The following are capsule reviews of some of the better restaurants recently 
visited by our critics: 
</P>
<P>
The 24-page menu at Jack's Restaurant and Deli offers everything from Mexican 
and American to vegetarian food and deli. The beers alone come in 136 
varieties. Try the sweet, tangy baby-back pork ribs or the Mexican dishes, 
which are particularly good. Jack's is in Westlake Plaza Shopping Center, 
Westlake Village; 495-8181. Open every day for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
Monday-Thursday 7 a.m.-midnight; Friday 7 a.m.-1:30 a.m.; Saturday 7:30 
a.m.-1:30 a.m.; Sunday 7:30 a.m.-11:30 p.m. Dinner for two, food only, $19-$52. 
</P>
<P>
You can go to Santa Barbara's crown jewel, the Four Seasons Biltmore Hotel, for 
more than just the atmosphere or the Sunday brunch buffet. The kitchen is now 
among the best in town, turning out wonderful dishes from lobster sausages to a 
bittersweet chocolate souffle. Better at dinner than at lunch. Either the 
indoor La Marina or the sparkling outdoor Patio makes for romantic dining. The 
Four Seasons Biltmore is at 1260 Channel Drive, Santa Barbara; 969-2261. 
Serving in the Patio weekdays 6:30 a.m.-10 p.m., weekends 6:30 a.m.-11 p.m. 
Serving in La Marina weekdays 6-10 p.m., weekends 6-11 p.m. Lunch for two, food 
only, $30-$48. Dinner for two, food only, $50-$70. 
</P>
<P>
The pub at Victoria Pub and Restaurant is a lively gathering place for English 
expatriates and pub lovers alike. It stays open until everyone goes home, and 
the dart games never stop. The more subdued restaurant serves an English menu, 
complete with steak and kidney pie, fish and chips, and Cornish pasties. The 
soups, which change every day, are excellent, as is the lamb steak. And you 
don't have to be British to appreciate the desserts. The crumble of the day 
with hot fruit, sweet crumble and cream is particularly good. Victoria Pub and 
Restaurant is at 1413F S. Victoria Ave., Ventura; 650-0060. Lunch is served 
every day from 11 a.m.-3 p.m. Dinner is served from 5-9:30 p.m., and the pub is 
open until 2 a.m. Dinner for two, food only, $25-$60. 
</P>
<P>
The flowing hot springs at Wheeler have drawn people to their therapeutic 
ambience since the early 1800s. Today, you can enjoy them along with a massage 
and a fine dinner. The menu changes every week, and the vegetables and herbs 
come from the restaurant's own gardens. The restaurant at Wheeler Hot Springs 
is located at 16825 Maricopa Highway in Ojai; 646-8131. Dinner is served from 
Thursday-Sunday 5-9:30 p.m., and Sunday brunch is from 10 a.m.-2 p.m. Dinner 
for two, food only, runs $52-$68.

A COMMUNITY COLLEGE INSTRUCTOR GETS STUDENTS TO PUT PEN TO PAPER BY PUBLISHING 
A NEWSPAPER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gregory Marquez publishes a very different type of local newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
This one has a circulation of about 500 and is distributed only a few times 
each year. Depending on the reporter, page one may deal with Tien An Men 
Square, Dracula or a chilling first-person account of the civil war in El 
Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
These may seem like unconventional subjects for a tiny local paper put together 
with a personal computer and a duplicating machine. But the writers of the 
articles aren't reaching for the offbeat, they are describing the life they 
have known. All are immigrants and all are students -- not journalists. They 
write for EP News, the class newspaper in the advanced English proficiency 
course at Ventura Community College. 
</P>
<P>
A professional newspaper editor might go crazy trying to edit some of the 
stories, but the publisher, who is in fact the teacher, isn't looking for 
perfection. Surrounded by computer terminals and stacks of papers in his 
classroom at the north end of the campus, Marquez reflects on why he chose a 
newspaper as a vehicle for his students to learn English. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a means to an end," said the 53-year-old Chicago native. "Their 
writings tells various things about their personal lives. I want them to write 
for a purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Marquez understands the meaning of purpose; he's been all over the world 
looking for it. 
</P>
<P>
He was the second of eight children born to a mother of Polish descent and a 
Filipino father. His family moved from Illinois to the Philippines in 1940 at 
the behest of his grandfather, a rather bad move, Marquez said, considering 
that the Japanese invaded the country shortly afterward. He was 3 years old. 
</P>
<P>
The family was spared internment in a camp because Marquez's mother was thought 
to be a Swiss citizen. They were repatriated in 1945 and moved to Schenectady, 
N.Y. After high school, Marquez spent three years in the Marines and upon being 
discharged, went back to the Philippines to attend college. "How can you beat 
$60 a year tuition and relatives to stay with?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
But wanderlust continued to torment him. After he finished school, Marquez 
wound up in Malaysia, bought a motorcycle and pointed it north with a planned 
route through Thailand, Burma, East Pakistan -- now Bangladesh -- India and 
eventually Europe. He got as far as Burma only to find the border closed, 
returned to Thailand and took a job teaching English at a private school. 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, he was back in New York, enrolled in the University of New York at 
Albany and working on a degree in economics with a minor in philosophy. He 
celebrated his graduation by traveling, this time to Morocco for six months. 
</P>
<P>
Back in New York, he worked intermittently as a truck driver and a substitute 
teacher before heading to Mexico in 1968 to "teach English. I didn't make much 
money, just enough to live on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yo-yo-ing back to the United States, he promptly took off with a friend and 
headed for Peru, ostensibly never to return. Marquez got as far as Guatemala, 
"where there were beautiful birds, blue sky and carrots were 4 cents a pound." 
</P>
<P>
But the lure of his homeland was overpowering. In 1973 he returned, this time 
to California. Since then he has worked as a cook in a private school, taught 
English as a Second Language classes at various community colleges, bounced 
back to Mexico to work for that government, returned and joined the ESL 
department at Cal State Los Angeles, and finally, three years ago, applied for 
a job at Ventura Community College. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest kick is teaching," he said. "I don't know what I'd do if I didn't 
have students to recharge my batteries every day. You get more than you give 
out." 
</P>
<P>
And one of the things Marquez gets is a lot of extra work editing stories for 
the paper, which, he said, has proven to be an effective teaching aid. 
</P>
<P>
"The newspaper is their writing assignment because it's their weakest skill. 
Some are very verbal, very fluent, but they don't have writing skills," he said 
of the students. Most are in their mid-20s "so this is an attempt to get 
everyone writing." 
</P>
<P>
In return, Marquez finds that his students are determined to excel. "They're 
motivated and they want to learn," he said, adding that most come to EP classes 
so they can use their new English skills to find a job or get a better one. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Luis Garcia, 34, a native of Mexico, is typical. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to go back to the fields," he said of the work he has been doing 
for the last 15 years. "I want a better education. Here I can learn, work on 
computers and use the English language. He really helps you. He reminds me of 
Jaime Escalante, the teacher in the movie 'Stand and Deliver.' " 
</P>
<P>
Jaime Casillas, director of off-campus programs, also praises Marquez for the 
extra effort he takes with his class. 
</P>
<P>
"Greg is the type of a teacher who takes a personal interest in each student," 
Casillas said. "It's not uncommon to see him still working in his office at 10 
p.m. He combines creativity and enthusiasm with a lot of hard work." And a lot 
of that work goes into the EP News. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a labor of love. You don't do this type of class just because you want 
to be a teacher," Marquez said. "My general purpose is make them feel good 
about themselves. If I can give them that, I've accomplished what I want to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UP CLOSE GREGORY MARQUEZ 
</P>
<P>
Title: Ventura Community College teacher. 
</P>
<P>
First love: First and foremost, teaching. 
</P>
<P>
Most frustrating teaching job: "At an ESL department in a state college where 
the school was more money-oriented, rather than student-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
Biggest problem teaching English proficiency: Working with students whose 
language doesn't use articles. For example: Japanese. "I see car."

HELLE SCHARLING-TODD OF DENMARK SAYS THERE IS AN ARTISTIC DROUGHT IN THE 
COUNTY.

Artist Helle Scharling-Todd is on a mission of sorts -- to brighten up Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Her first move was to put in the large floor mosaic at the Port Hueneme 
Library. Now she's trying to do the same thing in Ventura. In May, 
Scharling-Todd received a $2,500 grant from the Ventura Arts Council to create 
something for the H.P. Wright Library. Unfortunately, she's been unable to 
match that figure through private sources, so she's only gotten as far as doing 
the sketches. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I wanted to build a sculpture with water, but the library thought it 
might be too dangerous," she said. "They suggested something in the patio. It's 
a very dark place. The library is very bland." 
</P>
<P>
Scharling-Todd, who was born in Denmark and came to the United States 10 years 
ago, said she decorated about 30 public buildings in her former homeland and 
has the same idea in mind for her current hometown of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"There are tons of places," to decorate, she said. "Ventura is literally 
untouched when it comes to art. There's been a drought here." 
</P>
<P>
How do you sell an ugly pumpkin? Give it a name like Scarface. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's the marketing tactic at the Somis Farm produce stand in Somis, 
where most of the Halloween fruits actually go by more flattering names like 
Kim, Estelle and Marsha. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter named them," said co-owner Gladys Kohatsu. "The kids love it. If 
they know some member of the family with the same name, they pick it up." 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the residing pumpkin family: 
</P>
<P>
Beth -- the fattest and, at $6, the most expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Penny -- the smallest and one of the cheapest, at $1.75. 
</P>
<P>
Sleepy -- the one in the reclining position.

Well, the Simi Valley Cajun band Gumbo La La is back from a successful 
engagement, playing on the sidewalk outside the Holiday Casino in Las Vegas. 
Performing just several hundred feet off the Strip, the group attracted about 
200 people by the third set. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the cabdrivers would pull over to the right, get out and stand there 
for 20 minutes," said bandleader Bobby Weiszmann. 
</P>
<P>
So what did Weiszmann do to relax during off hours in Sin City? 
</P>
<P>
"I went to a petting zoo," he said. "I watched the ducks and chickens." 
</P>
<P>
5:55-6 p.m., Tuesdays and Thursdays, just won't be the same. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month Chris Gordon and Marc Martinez, both seniors at Buena High 
School in Ventura, ended their yearlong stint as co-anchors of the evening news 
on Cable Channel 6. 
</P>
<P>
It was short but sweet. Gordon will be taking with him a lot of memories. 
</P>
<P>
"The San Francisco earthquake hit about 40 minutes before we went on the air," 
he said. "First, when it happened, we didn't know what was going on. We felt 
it. We were sitting in the studio and all the lights were shaking. We thought 
it might have been local." 
</P>
<P>
Does Gordon plan to make a career out of broadcasting? "Yes. I want to be an 
anchorman. I don't want to do sports or weather and have to talk about storms 
in Idaho." LEO SMITH

Forget oat bran. Dump the iron tablets. Learn to play bridge. That will put the 
snap back in your elastic. 
</P>
<P>
It's a universal truth -- in every family there's one bridge fanatic and one 
kid who failed the SAT test. Junior should wise up and take card lessons. 
Bridge is fun, and it can also be good for mental acuity and memory. 
</P>
<P>
Contract bridge ranks among the most popular games in card-playing circles. The 
American Contract Bridge League claims more than 180,000 members, including 
many who play at affiliated clubs in Ventura County and throughout Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Gary Small, professor of psychiatry at the UCLA 
Neuropsychiatric Institute, "the old saying 'use it or lose it,' can apply to 
mental activity as well." 
</P>
<P>
Mental stimulation, he said, is as beneficial as physical exercise to good 
health. "Activities like bridge are not only mentally challenging, but they 
help people to get out socially and that can be helpful in preventing 
depression," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bridge, in fact, is considered such a good way to get out and meet people that 
some companies, including IBM, pay for the lessons of employees facing 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, experts have long recognized the therapeutic role of card games in 
rehabilitating brain-injured and stroke patients. "Card games are good for 
socialization and fine motor coordination," said Wendy Nitsche, director of 
occupational therapy at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard. "Cards 
are also good for thinking skills, memory, sequencing and organizing." 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Kennell, director of occupational therapy at Los Robles Regional Medical 
Center in Thousand Oaks, agreed. "Bridge is a wonderful game because it works 
on so many cognitive skills, but," she said, "you are limited because you need 
four players. At the clinic, we teach solitaire to people who never played 
cards before and they become card monsters." 
</P>
<P>
Kennell said people can progress to two-person games such as gin rummy and 
later to bridge, conditions permitting. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Marjory Freyermuth, 73, suffered a stroke. She resumed bridge a 
year ago on her doctor's advice, and plays at the Dorrill B. Wright Cultural 
Center in Port Hueneme Recreation Center. "Since I've been playing bridge, I've 
noticed that it's a lot easier to remember other things, like names," 
Freyermuth said. 
</P>
<P>
Joann Truelsen, Freyermuth's caretaker, agreed. "She has a little better hand 
coordination since playing bridge. The stroke affected her right side and her 
arm was really bad. I'd say even her speech has improved a little," Truelsen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At 90, Pearl Wismer is the bridge demon of the Castle Hill Retirement Village 
in Thousand Oaks. She bemoans the fact that "so many people want to be 
entertained. They love bingo -- which I can't stand." 
</P>
<P>
You won't find John Leming of Port Hueneme in the bingo parlors, either. An 
insurance broker, Leming recently played bridge with 20,000 players, eight 
hours a day for 10 days to win the Stoddard trophy. The coveted prize is 
usually won by a professional bridge player. 
</P>
<P>
Leming had given up bridge 30 years ago after his wife's ultimatum. "It was 
either marriage or bridge," he said. Marriage won out -- for awhile. After his 
divorce six years ago, Leming, 52, resumed his hobby at the Bridge Academy II 
in Thousand Oaks, where Mayor Alex Fiore is a regular visitor. 'It kept me out 
of the bars," said Leming, who is ranked 104th out of the nation's top 500 
bridge players. 
</P>
<P>
"I play bridge primarily for the mental stimulation. It even appears to help in 
my day-to-day business life," said Leming. "My memory is a lot better than it 
used to be, especially for details and numbers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura Avenue Senior Center offers new beginners bridge classes every 
Wednesday at 10 a.m. (805) 648-3035. Nearly all the senior and recreation 
centers in the county offer lessons or have groups that play weekly. Bridge 
clubs in Ventura County are not exclusively for senior citizens. People may 
become members or visit on a pay-as-you-play basis: 
</P>

You can't call a spade a spade even if you want to. Fact is, you can't tell one 
from a club (though you could probably spot a heart or a diamond if push came 
to shove). You want to enjoy card games -- no, you want to be able to tolerate 
card games, and you live in fear of the day when Genevieve Bujold invites you 
to her place for a game of strip poker. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't play cards, ma cherie," you will have to tell her and spend the rest 
of your days in self-loathing. Your sense of inadequacy is only compounded by 
the knowledge that all great writers, at one time or another, have tasted the 
fruits of the deck in an all-night card-playing debauch. 
</P>
<P>
So you face the prospect of a bridge lesson with a deep sense of foreboding. So 
much hangs in the balance, more than your well-meaning editor could ever have 
known when she gave you this assignment. Still, maybe this time you will feel 
the magic. Maybe you will face the demon and emerge, bloodied but triumphant. 
</P>
<P>
But you're not taking any chances. No, you need all the help you can get. So 
you march straight to the video store and rent "Play Bridge With Omar Sharif." 
</P>
<P>
You take the tape home and, while quietly whistling "Lara's Theme," pop it into 
your new VCR. Old Omar, still dashing, sets the tone nicely. "I have played 
bridge with royalty and with cabinet ministers," he says, confiding how he used 
to play bridge on the set with Sophia Loren. He let her win, he says, because 
he knew she hated to lose. His eyes twinkle mischievously, and you begin to 
think that maybe you've waited too long to learn this game. 
</P>
<P>
You are wrong. You should have waited longer. "Now, through the electronic 
miracle of the videocassette," Sharif says, "you will be my partner in the 
world's most fascinating card game. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
You remember nothing from that moment on, save a few colorful terms, like 
trick, no-trump, slam and rubber. 
</P>
<P>
And so you arrive at the Hueneme Bay Bridge Club with your sense of foreboding 
intact. Will you get trumped here, among these 20 or so active seniors? Will 
you be forced to play a rubber or pick up tricks? Not if you can help it; a 
reporter can only be expected to go so far in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
Your instructor, Pat Perkins, tries to make you feel at home among her 
students, both beginners and intermediate players. She tells you that she grew 
up in Texas. "My father played cards, though some people thought he shouldn't 
have," she says. "The Southern Baptists called cards the 'pasteboards of the 
devil,' so we used to play with the shades drawn." 
</P>
<P>
Perkins stands before a chalkboard filled with strange symbols. "Tonight's 
lesson is on the response to an opening no-trump bid," she says, and you begin 
to wonder why seemingly nice people say such things. 
</P>
<P>
But it's time to play bridge. You've been placed at the beginners' table and, 
since four women are already there, you double up with one of them. All your 
table mates have been here a couple of times before, so they're only moderately 
green. 
</P>
<P>
They seem concerned about your comprehension of the game, and you don't want to 
disappoint them. Quickly you master the dual-pronged technique of: 
</P>
<P>
a) looking like you understand and, 
</P>
<P>
b) asking seemingly intelligent questions. 
</P>
<P>
For example, your partner says to you, "If you win a trick, you put your cards 
down vertically. If you lose, you lay them horizontally." You nod knowingly, 
rub your chin and ask, "Is that standard operating procedure in duplicate as 
well as in rubber bridge?" They're impressed. You're pretty sure they would 
have been less impressed had you asked the question that was really on your 
mind: What on earth is a trick? 
</P>
<P>
After a half-dozen or so brain-numbing hands, you decide to take an inventory 
of what you've learned so far about the world's most fascinating card game. You 
scribble the following in your notebook: 
</P>
<P>
1. The art is in the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
2. The dealer always opens. 
</P>
<P>
3. An ace is worth 4 points, a king is 3, a queen is 2 and a jack is 1. 
</P>
<P>
Thus assured that the evening has not been a total loss, you approach Perkins 
and ask her the question that has gnawed at you since your game with Omar 
Sharif. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do people play bridge?" 
</P>
<P>
Perkins says she plays for the intellectual stimulation and the challenge. 
"It's good for older people because it gives them something to do," she says. 
"When you start to lose more of your memory than you'd like to, it's good for 
you. It helps keep you alert." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe she's got something there, you say to yourself, and resolve to give the 
game another try -- in about 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PREMISE 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of things you have never tried. Fun things, dangerous things, 
character building things. The Reluctant Novice tries them for you and reports 
the results. This week's Reluctant Novice is free-lance writer Steve Keeva.

METZGER CROSS-EXAMINES SELF ON WITNESS STAND

<P>
White supremacist Tom Metzger, representing himself in a $10-million wrongful 
death case, cross-examined himself on the witness stand and answered questions 
from his son Wednesday, then grilled the police chief and district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual events came as the Fallbrook, Calif., TV repairman, former Ku Klux 
Klan grand dragon and chief of his own White Aryan Resistance group stayed on 
the witness stand a day after being questioned by Morris Dees, a southern civil 
rights attorney representing the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
Metzger, 52, and his son John, 22, claim they cannot afford attorneys for the 
lawsuit brought by two civil rights groups on behalf of the family of Mulugeta 
Seraw, 27, an Ethiopian student who was beaten to death by three "skinheads" in 
Portland in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claims the Metzgers sent three White Aryan Resistance associates to 
Portland to spread their teachings of hatred and violence against minorities 
and Jews. The suit claims the Metzgers should be held responsible for Seraw's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Also named in the suit are Kenneth Mieske and Kyle Brewster, two of Seraw's 
killers, who were members of the Portland skinhead group East Side White Pride. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with a list of questions he posed to himself, Metzger claimed to have had 
little experience with assault rifles and said he never trained anyone to use 
those weapons or others, including baseball bats like the one that cracked 
Seraw's skull. He also denied teaching skinheads or anyone else to hurt people. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you train anyone in weapons, knives or baseball-bat violence? And the 
answer is no," he said. "I don't train anybody because I don't know how to 
train them. I don't do it, and I don't authorize it." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Metzger, do you teach skinheads or anyone else to kill or hurt people? No, 
never have," he said, insisting he uses only "legitimate means" of persuasion, 
such as his WAR newspaper and TV program "Race and Reason." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of his self-cross-examination, Metzger said, "Mr. Metzger, I'm 
through with you." 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by his son, Metzger said he was never questioned by 
authorities about the Seraw killing or any of his legal activities, including 
his taped telephone "hot line" messages. 
</P>
<P>
Metzger has vowed to continue his white separatist work, whatever the verdict. 
But in a veiled threat to the government, he said that, if his avenues of free 
speech are taken away, "All bets are off, and I can't tell you what I might do 
then." 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs called Police Chief Richard Walker and Multnomah County Dist. 
Atty. Michael Schrunk to the stand. Both firmly denied Metzger's claims that 
the WAR agents sent to Portland were actually paid police informants and "agent 
provocateurs." Metzger made those claims in a $10-million countersuit. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Metzger, Schrunk said most of the perpetrators of racial 
intimidation have been white and most of the victims black and Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if laws against "hate" crimes open a "Pandora's Box" and clog the court 
dockets, Schrunk said that has not proven to be the case. 
</P>
<P>
Walker acknowledged that Portland police use paid informants, but said that, as 
far as he knows, none were used in the Seraw case.

2 CHILDREN PERISH IN BLAZE AT HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
TRAGEDY: THREE BOYS AND THEIR GRANDPARENTS ESCAPE THE FIRE IN INGLEWOOD. 
CHILDREN PLAYING WITH MATCHES MAY HAVE CAUSED THE DESTRUCTION. 
</P>

An Inglewood woman returned home from work Wednesday evening to discover that 
her two young daughters had perished in a fast-moving house fire moments before 
she arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"My babies! Where are my babies?" Vika Sitani shrieked at firefighters when she 
saw the burned-out remains of the small house she shared with another family in 
the 3700 block of West 111th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said three small boys and their grandparents survived by fleeing 
out the back door of the house, but Sitani's children, Nesi, 2, and 
15-month-old Peti, suffered massive burns. As a crowd of several hundred 
neighbors looked on, firefighters recovered the sisters from the blazing house 
and took them to Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital, where they were pronounced 
dead on arrival. 
</P>
<P>
"The front half of the house had flames coming out of the living room and front 
bedroom, where the girls were, when we arrived," Battalion Chief Rem Bowder 
said. "We did get word that there might be children inside, but we had to knock 
the fire down before we could make entry." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Sitani moved from Texas with her husband and daughters about a 
year ago to stay with a friend in Inglewood. Her husband was in Texas picking 
up a car Wednesday, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood Battalion Chief Kenneth Mays said the 4:30 p.m. blaze, which was 
"fully involved when we arrived," may have been started by children playing 
with matches. It appeared that the fire began near a living room couch and 
spread up the wall to the roof, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they were also checking the possibility that recent roofing 
work on the house may have been a contributing factor. Neighbors said workers 
who had spread tar on the roof had left the house about a half hour before the 
fire broke out. Bowder said preliminary evidence indicated that the roof work 
was "probably a coincidental thing." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities had difficulty piecing together details because the two adults in 
the home when the blaze broke out were from the South Pacific island of Tonga 
and spoke little English. Through a translator from a Tongan church in 
Lawndale, the grandmother said she did not know how the fire began. The woman, 
whose name was not released, told officials the children were playing when 
smoke filled the house. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors credited Chris Miller, 24, a deliveryman for a local freight company, 
with keeping the blaze from spreading to other properties. Miller, a former New 
York City firefighter, said he was making a delivery when he saw the smoke. 
When he pulled his van up to the house, he said he saw a woman spraying the 
house with a garden hose and several hundred other neighbors looking on.

RACE PROMOTERS HIT THE WALL IN DEL MAR, REROUTE MARATHON THROUGH OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lynn Flanagan is flabbergasted. Del Mar lets those oily, smelly, noisy race 
cars rampage within its city limits on their annual Grand Prix. But they give 
the boot to a bunch of runners who want to quietly lope through town. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't that amazing?" said Flanagan, director of In Motion, promoter of the San 
Diego International Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the City Council voted to deny permits sought by In Motion to stage 
part of the 26.2-mile foot race through Del Mar on its proposed course up the 
North County coast -- forcing Flanagan to reroute the 27-year-old event 
exclusively through Carlsbad and Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar city officials say the race just came at a bad time, and they responded 
to the will of residents who were solidly against playing host to the event. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan, however, says the race that benefits several local charities just 
became a victim of small-town politics. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no rhyme or reason to it," she said of Del Mar's decision. "They had 
some valid concerns that we spent two weeks addressing. But, when we came back 
to them with a full report, they wouldn't even look at it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just really shocked. We spent all this time spinning our wheels for 
nothing, for them just to dismiss us like that. Well, Del Mar can go ahead and 
build a wall around itself for all we care." 
</P>
<P>
The Dec. 9 race will go on as planned though, she said, starting and finishing 
at the Oceanside Pier. Half the course will still hug the ocean, running south 
to La Costa Avenue at the Encinitas city limits before turning east into 
Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
The course originally proposed would have taken runners along the entire North 
County coastline from La Jolla to Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, it'll be a good course," Flanagan said. "We'll be in two cities that 
really want us." 
</P>
<P>
The marathon ran into a battle of red tape earlier this month when three North 
County cities -- Del Mar, Encinitas and Solana Beach -- initially refused to 
grant promoters the necessary permits to stage the race within their 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
The three cities -- all of whom have a contract with the San Diego Sheriff's 
Department to provide police services -- had earlier received a letter from 
Sgt. Rich Hendrickson, the department's coordinator for special events, 
advising staff members against approving the race because of the manpower 
needed for security. 
</P>
<P>
"They were a key player, and unfortunately you had one officer who didn't want 
to see the race run in North County," Flanagan said. "And all the cities looked 
up to him as the authority. What are you going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, promoters appealed the matter to the city councils. On Monday 
night, Del Mar was the first city to officially reject being host of the event. 
Both Encinitas and Solana Beach have postponed making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all moot now," Flanagan said. "The race is coming soon. We just don't 
have time to wait around anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar Mayor Jan McMillan said the council's decision came after consulting 
city staff and the Sheriff's Department. "We were listening to the people who 
live here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Chris Helton said that, although some elements within the city want 
to see Del Mar used as a stage for special events, "the majority want to see it 
remain a small, quaint, residential village." 
</P>
<P>
McMillan added that the City Council has also voted against the staging of the 
annual Grand Prix road race, but it has been overruled by the state Coastal 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"If Lynn knew the history of our city, she'd know that we have opposed that 
race," the mayor said. "I'm sorry she feels this way." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Flanagan says, race plans continue on schedule up the road in 
Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Sanchez, director of the city's parks and recreation department, said the 
city is excited about being host of the race, which he called "one of the 
nation's premiere running events." 
</P>
<P>
"We believe we should have such a race run in Oceanside," Sanchez said. "It'll 
bring in 10,000 runners and their families, give them an opportunity to see 
what Oceanside has to offer." 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside, he said, has a special events office that actively solicits events 
such as concerts and running and bicycle races to be staged in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We've dealt with promoters, and we know the long-term economic and exposure 
benefits that come from these things," he said. "Apparently, Del Mar doesn't 
play such an active role in special event gathering. So maybe they don't know 
all the benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Thom Hunt, who won the marathon in 1986, said an inland course might dampen the 
enthusiasm of some runners. "Some are just looking for a fast course with fast 
conditions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's only a small percentage of the athletes. There's lots of marathons 
staged all over the world on a year-round basis. And many runners consider 
things like how scenic the route is when they choose their races." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Flanagan said this year's marathon planning has taught her a 
valuable lesson when dealing with suburban politics. 
</P>
<P>
"Stay away from it," she said.

MORE BOGUS CASH FOUND AT CSLB; PROBE NARROWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Two new counterfeit bills were discovered at Cal State Long Beach this week, 
putting the campus at the center of a federal investigation that began a month 
ago after university plumbers found $1 million worth of soggy bogus money 
clogging a sewer line. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the new find, Secret Service agents say they plan to visit the 
university in the next few days to examine campus printing presses as possible 
sources of the phony money. 
</P>
<P>
"This is more than playing around," said Wayne Presley, a special agent with 
the Los Angeles Secret Service office. "You put two and two together and you 
have to wonder whether something's going on." 
</P>
<P>
In mid-September, campus plumbers investigating a clogged sewer line climbed 
down in a manhole and found sopping wet $100 bills stuffed into a pipeline that 
runs beneath the campus. 
</P>
<P>
While investigators had dismissed the earlier find as the discarded work of 
amateurs, Presley said he expects this new batch of bills -- which is of much 
higher quality -- to begin appearing soon at area banks and commercial outlets. 
</P>
<P>
"There are bills of much less quality being passed out there right now," 
Presley said. "It's a good possibility that these are the same people, but that 
they've just gotten better." 
</P>
<P>
When the first batch of bills was found, authorities said they were looking 
into the possibility that the money was printed on campus. Now their 
investigation is zeroing in on the campus, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that some equipment capable of being used in the production 
of phony money does exist on campus, university officials maintain that it 
would be extremely difficult for anyone to use it for illegal purposes without 
being seen. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have to be a late-night operation and we walk foot patrols all 
night," said Ron Perron, field operations lieutenant for the campus police. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent discovery was made about 4 a.m. Monday when a campus custodian 
came upon two crumpled $20 bills on a sidewalk near the university's nursing 
department on the west side of campus. "Because we had the previous incident 
involving counterfeit bills he thought he would take a close look at them," 
Perron said. "It was obvious that they were counterfeit in that they both had 
the same serial number." 
</P>
<P>
Presley speculated that the new bills may have been accidentally lost by their 
maker. 
</P>
<P>
To add to the confusion, another counterfeit $20 bill -- apparently unrelated 
to the first two finds -- was discovered Wednesday morning when a seemingly 
unaware student tried to spend it at the campus bookstore. According to 
Presley, the bogus bill is part of an older batch that has been in circulation 
in the Los Angeles area for more than a year. "We really have no idea where it 
came from," he said of that bill, adding that he had not ruled out the 
possibility of a connection between the three finds. 
</P>
<P>
Campus officials, meanwhile, said they were distributing bulletins to area 
businesses warning them of the newer counterfeit bills, which bear serial 
numbers of A54782926E.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL PUTS HOLD ON THEATER CENTER FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has tentatively decided to withhold nearly $1 million that 
would enable the Los Angeles Theater Center to keep its doors open through 
January. 
</P>
<P>
After much discussion, the council voted 7 to 5 on Tuesday to withhold the 
funding until it sees a report by a commission charged with reviewing the 
theater's long-term financial future. 
</P>
<P>
The money -- $998,000 -- is necessary to keep the theater in downtown Los 
Angeles operating through its current fall/winter season. 
</P>
<P>
But Bill Bushnell, LATC artistic director, said the theater has been using 
reserve funds to cover expenses until funding is approved. 
</P>
<P>
The much-awaited report by a review panel named by Mayor Tom Bradley is 
expected to recommend some variation of a plan in which the city would acquire 
the LATC's Spring Street building, with the existing production company 
becoming the leading member of a larger group of performers.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : AUTOPSY SHOWS INFANT DIED OF HEAD INJURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's investigators believe the death last Sunday of a 3-month-old Rosemead 
boy was a homicide, but have not decided whether it was intentional, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Corey Kam Paschal was rushed Saturday evening to Greater El Monte Community 
Hospital after his parents called sheriff's deputies to report that the infant 
was not breathing, a sheriff's spokesman said. He was later placed on 
life-support systems at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, where he was 
pronounced dead Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy Wednesday indicated that the child died of head injuries, possibly 
due to shaking, but the investigation is continuing and further medical tests 
are planned, said sheriff's homicide investigator Melinda Hearne. 
</P>
<P>
No suspects were in custody.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : MALIBU CITYHOOD FACES DELAY TILL SPRING OF 
1992 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cityhood for Malibu, now set for March 28, could be delayed until the spring of 
1992 if Los Angeles County's effort to build a proposed $43-million sewer 
system is stalled by a recent decision of the California Coastal Commission, a 
county official has hinted. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the applicable statute (a further delay) of cityhood is an option," 
Assistant County Counsel Bill Pellman has said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's new position follows the Coastal Commission's decision to delay 
until at least December the county's request to speed construction of the 
sewer. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's staff said it needs more information before scheduling a 
hearing on the project. 
</P>
<P>
The delay came after the Mountain Recreation and Conservation Authority 
questioned county plans to dispose of up to 1.3 million gallons of effluent a 
day from a planned waste treatment facility near Pepperdine University into 
nearby Corral Creek.

Two men changing a tire on a pickup truck along the Harbor Freeway were shot 
and wounded Tuesday night by suspected gang members who pulled alongside and, 
after first offering to help, asked if the victims belonged to a Carson street 
gang, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The two motorists answered, "No, we're from San Pedro," and a passenger in the 
car opened fire, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, two men and a woman, fled southbound from the shooting scene, 
about a quarter-mile north of Channel Street in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Monet Williams, 24, and his cousin, Gerald Well, also 24, were taken to 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where both were in serious condition. Well was 
struck in the head and armpit, and Williams was hit in the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting was the third on Los Angeles freeways since last Friday.

TESTIMONY ON SCHOOL OFFICIAL ENDS; 
</P>
<P>
SUSPENSION: THE HEARING FOCUSED ON ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGES AGAINST HAWTHORNE 
HIGH'S SECURITY CHIEF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An administrative hearing over the suspension of Hawthorne High School Security 
Chief Jerome Brown concluded this week with testimony from McKinley Nash, the 
fired superintendent of the Centinela Valley Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
Nash, who is involved in litigation with the district over his contract, said 
the trustees' handling of the charges against Brown was "arbitrary and 
capricious" and that he did not believe the district could support any of the 
allegations against him. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees placed Brown, 33, on administrative leave with pay in March after he 
was briefly jailed by Hawthorne police for failing to appear in court four 
times since 1984 on traffic citations. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper accounts also reported around that time that Brown had been arrested 
for possession of crack cocaine in May, 1988, and had entered a 
court-supervised drug counseling program rather than fight the charge. Torrance 
Superior Court dismissed the charge after Brown completed the program. 
</P>
<P>
In support of the suspension, school officials later filed administrative 
charges accusing Brown of drug possession, bringing notoriety to the district, 
interfering with the arrest of a student and passing out protest flyers during 
student walkouts in early March. Six other allegations were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who denies all of the charges, insists he was simply a victim of 
harassment and racism. He is black. 
</P>
<P>
In August, after the administrative hearing had begun, the district suspended 
Brown without pay, accusing him of disobeying his superiors and threatening 
Assistant Supt. Robert Church during a confrontation at district headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, which took place on three days between August and last 
Tuesday, testimony was given by Brown, several security guards, administrators, 
two police officers and former Hawthorne High Principal Kenneth Crowe. 
</P>
<P>
Although Nash limited his comments at the hearing, he said in an interview 
Wednesday that he believes the way the district dealt with Brown was consistent 
with what he called a pattern of unfounded accusations lodged against blacks 
and others who support change in the district. Nash is also black. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether Jerome Brown should or should not have been an employee is a 
legitimate subject for board and superintendent review," Nash said. "But the 
way in which it was done was as a public expose to say, 'Hey, there's another 
criminal black over there.' " 
</P>
<P>
Brown is one of several black employees in the district who have filed 
complaints with the state Department of Fair Employment and Housing alleging 
that blacks are not treated fairly at Centinela Valley schools. 
</P>
<P>
A state report issued in August recommended that the board of trustees, which 
is predominantly Latino, develop programs to reduce racial conflicts in the 
district and appoint an ombudsman to investigate complaints. Once predominantly 
white, the student population today is 53.4% Latino, 18.4% black, 14.8% Anglo 
and 8.5% Asian. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was first employed in the district in 1984 as a teaching aide before he 
became a district security guard. In 1988, he was promoted to Hawthorne High 
security chief, a position in which he earned about $30,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Community activist Lionel Broussard, who acted as Brown's representative during 
the hearing, argued that labor codes prohibit the school board from taking 
action against Brown based on his arrest for drug possession, because he was 
never convicted of the charge. Broussard also argued that Brown was treated 
more harshly by the board than another security guard in similar circumstances 
because he is black. 
</P>
<P>
Nash did not directly raise the issue of race during his testimony on Brown's 
behalf, but he did say that he believed the board "has one standard for Brown 
and another standard for employees who had personalities different from that of 
Brown." 
</P>
<P>
Nash later clarified his remarks, saying, "Any individuals who were 
well-trained, assertive, and who threatened the jobs of existing people in the 
district (were) the subject of attack. That attack was easier to manipulate if 
the person was black." 
</P>
<P>
He also said he believed the attacks have been orchestrated by a small group of 
employees who felt threatened by his administration and "who wanted control of 
the district for themselves and to return back to the 1950s." 
</P>
<P>
But the district's attorney, James Baca, insisted Brown's race had nothing to 
do with the board's action. He also said the testimony of one of the police 
officers provided ample evidence to support the accusation that Brown was in 
possession of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a guy here who has no remorse, who made no request for rehabilitation 
and who proves to be a terrible role model and is involved in other misconduct 
as well," Baca said. "If the person had been white, Hispanic or green, I would 
have made the same recommendation to the board. These are very serious charges 
that certainly merit dismissal." 
</P>
<P>
Hearing officer Ronald Wenkart, an Orange County attorney appointed by the 
board to hear Brown's appeal, gave Baca and Broussard until Nov. 16 to send in 
their closing arguments. He said he would present the board with his 
recommendation regarding Brown's pending dismissal by the end of November. The 
district, however, is not bound to comply with his decision.

TORRANCE UPS SPEED LIMIT ON WESTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance City Council members Tuesday approved raising the speed limit on 
Western Avenue from 40 m.p.h. to 45 m.p.h. but asked the Traffic Commission to 
hold hearings on proposed speed limits for other major city streets. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed speed limits are based on a state law requiring cities that wish 
to conduct radar enforcement on their major streets -- generally those wider 
than 40 feet -- to survey them every five years to determine current traffic 
conditions and prevailing speeds. 
</P>
<P>
To allow radar enforcement, speed limits for those streets must be established 
within five miles per hour of the speed set by 85% of the drivers. 
</P>
<P>
City officials may set a lower speed limit only if a significant consideration, 
such as a blind curve or an adjacent school, warrants it. 
</P>
<P>
Council members, concerned that their most recent surveys called for increasing 
speed limits on most of the city's major arteries, decided to postpone action 
to allow public comment. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Torrance's radar surveys have expired, some as long as two years ago. 
As a result, police officers have been barred from using radar on most of the 
city's busiest streets. 
</P>
<P>
Although Torrance hired a consultant to conduct new surveys two years ago, city 
officials set them aside when they discovered that speed limits would have to 
be raised on a number of streets. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the council certified current speed limits on Madrona Avenue 
between Sepulveda Boulevard and Carson Street, on Prairie Avenue between 
Artesia and Redondo Beach boulevards and on Hawthorne Boulevard south of Newton 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials also asked the City Council to increase speed limits on 190th 
Street, Crenshaw Boulevard and Madrona, Prairie and Van Ness avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Council members refused. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Dee Hardison called it the start of "a vicious cycle. . . . Are 
you going to be back in five years asking for 50 miles an hour on some of these 
streets?" 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Dennis Frandsen, head of the Police Department's traffic division, said he 
did not believe that would happen. 
</P>
<P>
"The philosophy is to allow people to vote on what speed limits should be set 
by measuring how fast they are going now," he said. "They're currently ignoring 
the speed limits that are on these streets . . . and we can't use radar to 
enforce those limits." 
</P>
<P>
Increased speed limits to be considered at a later time would involve, among 
others, Anza and Arlington avenues, Calle Mayor, Carson Street, Pacific Coast 
Highway, and Palos Verdes, Sepulveda and Torrance boulevards -- many of which 
are lined by homes. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Bill Applegate and Dan Walker criticized their colleagues for 
failing to take the action necessary to let police use radar. 
</P>
<P>
"Sending it off to the traffic commission is not getting the job done," Walker 
said. "Nobody likes to have those speed limits raised, and no one wants to have 
them raised . . . but state law is preempting us from acting in a different 
manner. . . . I'd just as soon have the enforcement now and the conversation 
later." 
</P>
<P>
Among the proposed increases in speed limits sent back to the traffic 
commission were: 
</P>
<P>
* On 190th Street, from 35 m.p.h. west of Anza and 40 miles east of Anza to 45 
m.p.h. within city limits. 
</P>
<P>
* On Madrona Avenue, from 30 m.p.h. between Carson Street and Torrance 
Boulevard to 40 m.p.h., and to 45 m.p.h. between Torrance and Del Amo 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
* On Prairie Avenue, to 45 m.p.h. between Del Amo and Artesia boulevards. The 
limit would remain at 35 m.p.h. between Artesia and Redondo Beach boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
* On Van Ness Avenue, to 40 m.p.h. within city limits. 
</P>
<P>
* On Crenshaw Boulevard, to 45 m.p.h. north of Carson Street.

SAN DIEGO MEXFLY ERADICATION PROGRAM ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The effort to eradicate the Mexican fruit fly from San Diego County is 
scheduled to come to a formal end today as agriculture authorities discuss the 
results of the five-month program of aerial sprayings, sterile flies and 
quarantines. 
</P>
<P>
The eradication project has been deemed a success by the officials from the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture, California Department of Food and Agriculture, 
and the county Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
The quarantine of citrus in effect during the program ends today. Agriculture 
inspectors recorded a few minor violations of the quarantine but termed the 
overall project a success. 
</P>
<P>
Traps will continue to be placed in citrus trees to monitor the presence of 
pests, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Infestations were declared last spring in El Cajon and Compton with the 
trapping of several male and egg-bearing female Mexflies. 
</P>
<P>
Three aerial sprayings of malathion prompted public outcry and legal protests, 
but the sprayings continued until agriculture officials began the second phase 
of the eradication program, the release of about 360 million sterilized 
Mexflies designed to breed the citrus pest out of existence in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
No wild Mexflies have been trapped in El Cajon or Compton since July, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The threat of reinfestation is high because Mexflies can elude the "sterile-fly 
zone" along the U.S.-Mexican border and enter the Southland as eggs and larvae 
in citrus brought illegally into the country. 
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the eradication program was not available, but the figure is 
expected to exceed several million dollars.

MANHATTAN BEACH CALLS FOR MORE HEARINGS ON ZONING CODE CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with homeowners' concerns that a Manhattan Beach zoning code revision 
could unfairly restrict house sizes, the City Council on Tuesday postponed 
final approval of the code and called for new public hearings on proposed 
square-footage regulations on homes throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
Before the hearings, the Department of Community Development will hold 
information meetings at which property owners will be able to find out how the 
various square-footage formulas in the new code would affect their property. 
Those meetings will be held within the next month. 
</P>
<P>
Commonly called ZORP, for zoning code revision program, the voluminous document 
contains many proposals on zoning, development, parking and neighborhood 
preservation, as well as rules governing house sizes. 
</P>
<P>
The one restriction that has drawn significant complaints would roll back 
residential square footage throughout the city. It is a way to limit so-called 
"monster buildings" that have replaced older, smaller homes in recent years, 
blocking neighbors' views and sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
The revision was tentatively approved by the council Sept. 25, but a scheduled 
final approval this week was scuttled after some council members changed their 
minds about the square-footage regulations in the beach area. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 191 residents -- largely from beach neighborhoods -- flooded 
City Hall with clipped newspaper coupons asking how the rollback affects their 
properties. Coupons were contained in an ad run in the Beach Reporter, a 
Manhattan Beach newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy centers on about 600 30-by-90-foot beach area lots. Under 
current regulations, three-story structures may be built up to 5,670 square 
feet. The new code, which links square footage to lot size, would reduce 
dwellings to 4,180 square feet, including 400 square feet for a garage. A few 
smaller beach lots are guaranteed at least 2,500 square feet, including garage. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Steve Barnes and Councilman Bob Holmes on Sept. 25 tried unsuccessfully 
to make the revision less restrictive, though still tighter than the current 
zoning. In interviews, Councilwomen Pat Collins and Connie Sieber said they 
also believe the beach rollback would be too severe, and is out of proportion 
to the rest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt we were real tough on the 30-by-90s," said Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Though the beach area was in the spotlight Tuesday, the council voted to hold 
new hearings on a citywide basis because residents in other neighborhoods may 
be unhappy when they learn how the rollback would affect their property. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Dan Stern was the lone dissenter, arguing that the council should 
pass the code revision and then hold the information meetings and hearings. He 
said needed changes could be made later.

MAN MADE BOMBS FOR GANG'S USE, POLICE ALLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY and JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 19-year-old gang member arrested this week on suspicion of manufacturing and 
possessing explosive devices was believed to be making the bombs for a 
Glendale-based gang, and for possible use against a rival gang, authorities 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Arash Forouzanfar was arrested Tuesday in Glendale after an extensive 
investigation, said Glendale Police Sgt. Don Meredith. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives in Glendale and Los Angeles received information five months ago 
that a Glendale gang was attempting to add bombs to their arsenal, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said there were two bombings in vacant lots in Glendale in January and 
August and they are believed to be the work of Forouzanfar, or members of his 
gang. No one was injured in those blasts, which occurred in isolated areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe they were tests," Meredith said. "Our investigators believe any 
intended targets would have been that of a rival gang." 
</P>
<P>
Forouzanfar was described by police as being of Iranian descent, but was a 
member of a primarily Latino street gang active in Glendale and Northeast Los 
Angeles. Officers declined to name the gang or to speculate who the targets of 
any future bombings would have been. 
</P>
<P>
Police on Tuesday searched four locations frequented by Forouzanfar. In a house 
in the 1000 block of Harvard Road in Burbank, bomb squad officers found two 
complete explosive devices, chemicals and materials that could have made 
"several other bombs," Meredith said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Lt. Herb Seitz said the devices were "absolutely dangerous. 
We are not talking about Molotov cocktails." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe Tuesday's arrest dealt a fatal blow to plans by 
Forouzanfar's gang to use bombs against rival gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know we have recovered most, or all, of these devices," Meredith 
told United Press International. 
</P>
<P>
Forouzanfar will be arraigned today in Glendale Municipal Court. He remained in 
jail in lieu of $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Meredith said there could be more arrests in the case, but stressed that 
authorities believe Forouzanfar is the leader of the effort to add bombs to the 
gang's arsenal. The sergeant said Forouzanfar's gang was the only one suspected 
of manufacturing explosives.

DEMOCRAT MAKES ABORTION AN ISSUE IN THE 51ST DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wondering whether the abortion issue will affect the South Bay's state 
legislative races? 
</P>
<P>
Keep an eye on the 51st Assembly District, where Democrat Marilyn J. Landau of 
Torrance has made abortion rights the centerpiece of her campaign to unseat 
six-term incumbent Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro). 
</P>
<P>
Stretching from San Pedro to Manhattan Beach, the 51st District is hosting the 
closest thing to competition in this year's generally lackluster South Bay 
state Assembly and Senate contests. 
</P>
<P>
Landau, the best financed challenger in all seven of those races, considers the 
abortion issue key to winning broad-based support Nov. 6 on Felando's largely 
Republican political turf. 
</P>
<P>
"Women in this district want choice, and plenty of men support that position, 
too," said Landau, a counselor at Horace Mann Junior High School in Los 
Angeles. "If I can reach enough voters and let them know why I'm running, I 
think I can win." 
</P>
<P>
Felando, a consistent supporter of abortion restrictions, questions whether 
Landau's abortion strategy will work. Voters, he argues, are more concerned 
about other issues. 
</P>
<P>
"If in fact my opponent's No. 1 issue is abortion, I find that sad," said 
Felando. "We're surrounded by problems like drugs, crime and education." 
</P>
<P>
Felando, who has been battling a rare form of cancer, told The Times in August 
that, if reelected, he may step down in 1992. This week, however, he 
backtracked, saying he will "definitely" be on the 1992 ballot if voters return 
him to office this fall. 
</P>
<P>
He described his earlier comment as a mistake, saying: "I got my mouth engaged 
before I got my brain engaged." 
</P>
<P>
Abortion, to be sure, is not the only issue in this year's 51st District race, 
which also includes Libertarian William N. Gaillard of Redondo Beach, an 
equipment purchaser for a Long Beach engineering firm. 
</P>
<P>
Several points of contention concern the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Landau supports Proposition 128, the sweeping "Big Green" initiative that seeks 
to remove poisons from California's food, water and air. Felando opposes the 
measure, arguing it will hurt California industry and force consumers to pay 
more for food, gasoline and electricity. 
</P>
<P>
Landau also backs a ban on offshore oil drilling and an initiative on the fall 
ballot to preserve fish stocks and protect birds and mammals by outlawing 
gill-net fishing within three miles of shore. Felando opposes both proposals on 
economic grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The two candidates also disagree on state funding priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Landau says more money must be spent in key social areas, such as public 
education and health care. Opposed to tax increases on low and middle 
income-earners, she says she favors changing the state income tax system so 
rich people would pay at a higher rate. 
</P>
<P>
Felando, elected in 1978 on the coattails of Proposition 13, says he opposes 
tax increases of any kind. The state can solve its problems by making better 
use of existing revenues, he says -- proposing, among other things, that 
welfare funding be cut and diverted to prison construction. 
</P>
<P>
"We're treating these juveniles like little babies," Felando said. "They are 
mean, treacherous and dangerous. Let's build more prisons and let's stop 
coddling them." 
</P>
<P>
Gaillard, meanwhile, is running on a platform calling for the decriminalization 
of drugs, abolition of compulsory school attendance and an end to gun control 
and most land use restrictions, among other measures. 
</P>
<P>
But the abortion issue looms over others in the 51st District because it is key 
to the campaign strategy of Landau, the main challenger. The importance Landau 
places on the issue is evident in her campaign logo, which reads: "Elect 
Marilyn Landau. Your pro-choice candidate." 
</P>
<P>
Landau is gambling that significant numbers of voters in the district are 
frightened by last year's U.S. Supreme Court decision giving states greater 
latitude to legislate abortion restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
She says that, by tapping that concern, she can overcome the 52% to 37% GOP 
voter registration edge in the 51st District and Felando's superior fund 
raising, which in the first nine months of the year totaled $167,000 compared 
to Landau's $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
Said Landau: "If these people will get out and make their votes heard, they 
will turn this around." 
</P>
<P>
Landau says she opposes any effort to rein in abortion. She supports public 
funding for abortions and allowing minors to undergo the procedure without 
parental consent, saying she fears some teen-agers would risk an illegal 
abortion, rather than seek their parents' permission. 
</P>
<P>
Gaillard also says he is against government restrictions on abortion. But 
unlike Landau, he also opposes public funding of the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Felando, meanwhile, says he opposes abortion, except when the mother is the 
victim of rape or incest or could lose her life by carrying the pregnancy to 
term. 
</P>
<P>
Voting records show he has consistently backed the anti-abortion position by 
opposing public funding for abortions and the use of fetal tissue for medical 
research, as well as supporting parental consent for minors seeking abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how far he thinks California should go in restricting abortion, Felando 
declined to answer directly, saying he would have to study any measure 
affecting womens' ability to undergo the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would support an outright ban on abortion if this were allowed by 
the Supreme Court, he said: "I am not your maker. I am not your judge. I am 
your Assemblyman."

PORT SEEKS EXEMPTION TO PARKING TAX; 
</P>
<P>
HARBOR: COMPANIES THAT STORE AND PROCESS CARS AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL HERE WERE 
NEVER MEANT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE NEW LEVY, L.A. OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday tentatively agreed that the city's 
new parking tax should not apply to any of the huge lots in the harbor where 
about 250,000 cars each year are stored and processed for sale after their 
arrival at the port. 
</P>
<P>
The exemption is being sought by Port of Los Angeles officials who fear the tax 
might drive away the harbor's seven auto storage and processing companies. In 
all, the tax would cost the firms $250,000 to $500,000 each year. 
</P>
<P>
The city's new tax, devised by Mayor Tom Bradley, took effect in August and 
adds a 10% surcharge to parking in the city. The levy is expected to generate 
about $30 million annually, according to city budget analysts. 
</P>
<P>
If the council decides against the exemption and any companies decide to leave, 
their business will be welcome in other harbors like Port Hueneme and San 
Diego, said officials there. 
</P>
<P>
City lawmakers already have modified the tax once, to exclude apartment 
buildings. The council is now moving toward an exemption for the port 
businesses, arguing they were never meant to be included in the new levy. A 
final vote on the waiver is expected in several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The exemption, proposed Wednesday by Harbor-area Councilwoman Joan Milke 
Flores, would not affect the city's revenue estimates from the parking tax 
because the businesses were not specifically included in the original study of 
the tax, city officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, officials said, at least one of the companies that stores and 
processes new cars on 270 acres in the port recently received a tax assessment 
on parking from the Los Angeles City Clerk's Office. That surcharge led the 
Harbor Department and Flores to push for the exemption. 
</P>
<P>
In a motion that was approved without discussion Wednesday, Flores argued that 
the council had approved the new parking tax with the understanding that it 
would only apply to commercial parking lots, such as those in the city's many 
business districts. 
</P>
<P>
Applying the tax to the port businesses, Flores told her colleagues, was not 
only unintended but could lead the companies to leave the harbor, jeopardizing 
hundreds of jobs and "a significant part" of the port's annual income. 
</P>
<P>
The concern, port officials added, is that the tax could hurt the Harbor 
Department in its competition with other West Coast ports that vie for auto 
shipments -- a business that generates an estimated $6 million to $7 million 
annually for the Port of Los Angeles in land leases and wharfage fees. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Port of Los Angeles accounts for about 25% of all West Coast 
shipments of autos, port officials said the market has become increasingly 
competitive in recent years. That competition, they said, is evident from auto 
shipments to Port Hueneme and San Diego, which recently opened its first auto 
storage yard. And the competition extends to the Pacific Northwest, where at 
least one port has offered free land just to collect the wharfage fees on new 
autos passing through the port. 
</P>
<P>
"The tax would hurt us. It would be a problem," claimed Michael Lemke, property 
manager for the Port of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The specific exemption voted Wednesday would amend the city's parking tax law 
to exclude auto service companies preparing unregistered cars for sale or 
export. It would apply to Crown Auto Warehouse Co., Pasha Marine Terminal Inc, 
Fred N. Noonan Co., Import Dealers Service Corp., Distributors Auto Services 
Inc., Matson Terminals and TNT Auto Warehousing Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Before the proposed amendment returns for final action by the council and 
mayor, it is also expected to be reviewed by the city administrative office, 
where one analyst said Wednesday that the exemption for the auto storage 
companies is essentially a policy decision for the council. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear (the port companies) are not like other businesses that were to be 
affected by the ordinance. On the other hand, they are in the business of 
paying to park and store vehicles. . . . " said Rexford Olliff, an analyst in 
the administrative office. "It's a balancing act and one the council will have 
to decide." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at other ports saw Los Angeles' tax as a potential opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the parking tax discourages people from using Los Angeles," said Port 
Hueneme's Deputy Executive Director Bill Buenger. "I don't know that it has or 
that it will, but I hope it does." 
</P>
<P>
While his harbor now accommodates only two storage yards for new cars, Buenger 
said Port Hueneme has plenty of space for additional business if it comes. 
"We've got acres of farmland around here, and that land could easily be 
converted," he said.

2 COLLEAGUES ATTACK COUNCILMAN'S PLAN TO SEEK A 3RD TERM; 
</P>
<P>
REDONDO BEACH: BUT CITY ATTORNEY SAYS THE COUNCIL IS POWERLESS TO PREVENT RON 
CAWDREY FROM RUNNING, DESPITE THE CITY'S TWO-TERM LIMIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Redondo Beach Councilman Ron Cawdrey was confronted this week by two of his 
fellow council members, who told him during a council meeting that his decision 
to run for reelection in defiance of the city's two-term limit is illegal and a 
waste of taxpayer money. 
</P>
<P>
Cawdrey, whose second term expires in March, announced last month he will seek 
reelection next year despite a City Charter provision mandating that he retire 
from the council. Cawdrey has said the term limit is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
But at the council's regularly televised meeting Tuesday, at least two of his 
colleagues made it clear they don't agree. During a routine motion to set the 
date of the 1991 municipal election, Councilwoman Barbara Doerr asked the city 
attorney whether the council could stop Cawdrey's candidacy before his campaign 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
"Our esteemed colleague has announced his intention to run for a third term -- 
even though it's illegal," Doerr told the council crisply as Cawdrey leaned 
back, smiling determinedly, in his council seat. 
</P>
<P>
But City Atty. Gordon Phillips told her that the charter provision prevents 
Cawdrey only from serving a third term. There is no prohibition, he said, 
against running. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, then," said Mayor Brad Parton, laughing, "can we write down on the 
ballots under Ron's name, 'He's already served two terms?' " 
</P>
<P>
Phillips laughed, too, but told Parton that there is nothing the council can do 
under the terms of the charter to impede Cawdrey's candidacy. If Cawdrey wins, 
however, the city must refuse to swear him into office, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
Cawdrey would then have to take the city to court to test the two-term limit. 
City officials have predicted the litigation could go on for two years or more. 
</P>
<P>
Cawdrey remained silent throughout the ensuing discussion, though his firm 
smile never wavered. 
</P>
<P>
The council held to the city attorney's opinion and agreed to set the election 
date without amending it to ban Cawdrey's bid for a third term. The vote was 4 
to 1, with Doerr as the lone "no" vote. The councilwoman and former mayor said 
she would rather have forced Cawdrey to sue the city now, before the city 
spends money on an election that could be ruled invalid. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather see you challenge the city now, and waste your money," she told 
Cawdrey. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday, Cawdrey charged that Doerr "just wanted to make a 
political statement" and that Parton is nursing a grudge over Cawdrey's 
decision to challenge the charter in court rather than via a ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing in the charter says anything against my being a candidate for 50 terms 
if I so choose," he said in an interview Wednesday. "If I win -- and I will -- 
it will be up to whoever doesn't want me in office to try and take me on." 
</P>
<P>
Cawdrey has represented North Redondo Beach's 5th District since 1982, when he 
was appointed to fill the unexpired term of Gene King, who resigned. The 
following year, he was elected to a four-year term, and in 1985, he withstood a 
recall campaign led by community activists who opposed his backing of a plan to 
develop the defunct Aviation High School campus. He was reelected in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
According to the City Charter, Cawdrey must relinquish his council seat next 
year and cannot serve on the council again, except as mayor. In that position, 
too, the charter limits him to two terms. 
</P>
<P>
Cawdrey has been talking since early this year about challenging the two-term 
limit, saying that it deprives the city of experienced leadership. Initially, 
he had planned to overturn the limit with a new ballot measure this year, but 
that idea was dropped in August after the council decided -- with Cawdrey's 
approval -- not to hold a special election. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, Cawdrey indicated he might challenge the term limit in court, and 
his fellow council members said they were not surprised when he announced Sept. 
22 that he would run for council again. 
</P>
<P>
"It will give me an opportunity to test the system," he said, adding that it 
also would "give my constituents the opportunity to vote for whoever they 
want." 
</P>
<P>
Cawdrey -- like other opponents of term limitations -- says such restrictions 
are illegal because, under the California Constitution, the state holds 
jurisdiction over questions of eligibility to hold office. 
</P>
<P>
An appellate court in San Francisco used that reasoning last year to rule that 
General Law cities -- those without charters whose blueprint for governing is 
derived from laws passed by the legislature -- cannot impose term limits. But 
the ability of charter cities such as Redondo Beach to limit terms has never 
been determined by the appellate courts. A challenge to the limit in the 
charter city of Cerritos failed in Superior Court last year. It was not 
appealed.

CARSON REJECTS UTILITY TAX; 47 JOBS THREATENED; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: COUNCIL OKS 40% INCREASE IN BUSINESS LICENSE FEES, BUT THAT WILL NOT 
AVERT PROPOSED STAFF CUTBACKS. 
</P>

<P>
The Carson City Council, faced with potential budget cuts because revenues have 
not kept pace with expenditures, approved an increase in business license fees 
Tuesday but rejected a controversial proposal to levy a utility users tax that 
would have added up to $1.6 million in new revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The council is considering a $29-million spending package for 1990-91 that 
would require laying off 47 full-time and part-time employees. Carson officials 
estimate the city will receive $29 million in revenues and that the proposed 
budget would not require dipping into the city's $7 million in reserves. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed 1% tax could have been imposed on a variety of utilities, 
including telephone, electric, gas, water and cable television services. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Sylvia Muise, an outspoken proponent of a utility users fee, said 
a 1% tax on electricity alone might have saved up to 30 jobs scheduled to be 
cut under the most recent budget proposal. 
</P>
<P>
However, a majority of residents and business representatives in an overflow 
crowd at Tuesday's council meeting spoke against the tax. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Neil, president of the Carson Chamber of Commerce and a representative 
of Fletcher Oil Co., told the council that businesses in the city might be 
prompted to relocate if the tax were approved. Under the proposed 1% tax on 
electricity, Fletcher Oil Co. would have paid a $50,000 utility tax, Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
The council rejected the utility tax proposal 3 to 2, with Mayor Vera Robles 
DeWitt, Mayor Pro-Tem Kay Calas and Councilman Michael Mitoma voting against 
the measure. Councilwoman Juanita McDonald joined Muise in support of the tax. 
</P>
<P>
Muise on Wednesday said the council "can't have it both ways" in attempting to 
maintain the current level of city services without increasing revenue to 
balance the budget. The decision on the utility tax has left her frustrated and 
irritated, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The council unanimously approved a 40% increase in business license fees based 
on the change in the consumer price index since the fees were last raised in 
1983. The increase is expected to generate $386,000 in additional revenue. A 
$100 fee for processing new applications for business licenses is expected to 
bring in $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, the additional income is already figured into the city's most recent 
budget proposal and will not avert proposed cutbacks, City Administrator Jack 
Smith told the council. 
</P>
<P>
In light of widespread community opposition to proposed cutbacks, it is unclear 
when the council will vote on the spending plan for fiscal 1990-91 -- which 
began July 1 -- or whether council members are willing to follow through on 
pledges to adopt a balanced budget, according to council insiders. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think I know?" Muise asked Wednesday, reflecting on the current budget 
situation. "All I can say is that I won't approve a (deficit) budget." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the council passed a $34.8-million budget but spent only $29.9 
million after instituting a hiring freeze and cuts in capital purchases midway 
through the year to reduce an anticipated deficit. However, the city still 
spent $2.2 million from its reserves to balance the 1989-90 budget, which was 
adopted midway through the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The next workshop on the budget is scheduled for Oct. 30 at 9 a.m.

PRINCIPAL OF INGLEWOOD'S MORNINGSIDE HIGH DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mallory L. Matthews, who in February took over as acting principal of 
Inglewood's troubled Morningside High School, died Wednesday morning after a 
long illness. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews, 37, had been hospitalized since Sept. 4, when he collapsed during a 
parents' orientation meeting at Morningside. District officials said family 
members told them Matthews died of a heart attack at Daniel Freeman Memorial 
Hospital at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Family members could not be reached for comment, and hospital officials said 
the family had requested them not to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews was named acting principal of Morningside in February after the 
previous principal, Art Murray, was forced out of the job by district 
administrators, who held him responsible for problems during last year's fall 
semester. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, Morningside was disrupted by scheduling difficulties that kept 
hundreds of students out of class and by student walkouts to protest campus 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"Education has lost a coming star," said former Inglewood High School Principal 
Lawrence Freeman, who worked with Matthews for about five years. "Matthews 
cared a lot. He got along well with students. He was quite a kid." 
</P>
<P>
Maurice Wiley, the district's spokesman, called Matthews "a very positive force 
(who) improved the condition of our students." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews was an assistant principal under Freeman at Inglewood High from 1985 
until he was chosen by the school board to replace Murray in February. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, Matthews had been an assistant principal at Morningside from 1981 
to '85 and a coordinator of adult education and a summer principal there. He 
entered the district in 1979 as a social studies teacher at Inglewood High. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews was a graduate of Serra High School in Gardena and UCLA. He later 
earned a master's degree in education from Pepperdine University. 
</P>
<P>
District officials gave no word Wednesday on a replacement for Matthews at 
Morningside. Assistant Principal Ed Brownley has been filling in for Matthews 
since he entered the hospital; Brownley, however, has not been named acting 
principal.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING THE ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 175 to 249, the House rejected a conservative-sponsored crackdown 
on National Endowment for the Arts funding of sexually explicit artworks. The 
House later passed legislation (HR 4825) authorizing $175 million in fiscal 
1991 for the endowment. 
</P>
<P>
The billincreased federal scrutiny of artists receiving public money but left 
questions of obscenity to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
The rejected amendment sought, in part, to deny funding of projects that depict 
sexual conduct such as masturbation and sadomasochistic abuse or that tear down 
a religion. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach) said: "When it comes to federal tax 
dollars, we have a right to set a standard. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Peter H. Kostmayer (D-Pa.) said: "This amendment is brought to you by 
the book burners in the country and in the Congress." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to keep taxpayers' money from funding sexually explicit art. 
</P>
<P>
How They Voted 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bates (D): Nay 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Hunter (R): Yea 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Lowery (R): Nay 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Packard (R): Yea

<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Uphold Textile Veto 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 275 to 152, the House fell short of the two-thirds majority needed 
to overturn President Bush's veto of a bill limiting the growth of textile and 
apparel imports to 1% annually. The measure (HR 4328) also sought to freeze 
non-rubber footwear imports at 1989 levels. Canada and Israel would be exempted 
from the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters said the bill would protect jobs and factories against unfair 
foreign competition, while opponents said it would mask industry inefficiencies 
and raise retail prices. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to protect the domestic textile, apparel and non-rubber footwear 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
How They Voted

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aiming to make the city's housing-inspection program self-sufficient, the San 
Diego City Council has voted to increase permit fees for apartment owners an 
average of 20% next year. 
</P>
<P>
Besides those higher charges, which will generate an estimated $1.8 million 
more yearly, the council also voted Tuesday to establish, for the first time, 
an annual $18 permit fee for individuals who rent out single-family homes and 
duplexes. 
</P>
<P>
Another $1 per unit surcharge approved by the council will raise about $265,000 
annually to pay for expansion of the city's Drug Abatement Response Team 
program, which is intended to reduce drug dealing and related problems in 
rental properties. 
</P>
<P>
Under the council's action, average permit fees -- which pay for inspectors who 
investigate complaints of substandard housing -- will increase from slightly 
under $4 to about $4.65. The additional revenue produced through the higher 
fees will enable the city's housing-inspection program, which now requires 
about a $1.4-million annual subsidy, to pay for itself.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: TEMECULA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two New York men were taken into custody early Wednesday by Border Patrol 
agents when a search of their rented car netted 294 pounds of marijuana valued 
at $882,000. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Border Patrol report, agents working at the Temecula checkpoint 
on Interstate 15 became suspicious of the pair and ordered them to the 
secondary inspection station. 
</P>
<P>
A dog trained to sniff out drugs alerted agents to the presence of several 
pounds of marijuana in two suitcases. A more thorough search of the vehicle led 
to the seizure of a larger load of the drug from the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol officials said that Stuart Reinhardt of Staten Island and Michael 
Palumbo, Jr. of Brooklyn were taken into custody at 12:15 a.m. The two men, 
whose ages were not available, were transferred to the custody of officers from 
the North County Narcotics Task Force.

FISHING NOTES: WARM WATER HELPS KEEP THE FISHING HOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
October's ocean sportfishing has been the best in nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The bluefin tuna run at the outer banks continues, with a good showing of fish 
weighing 50 pounds or more. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers fishing on the three-quarter and half-day boats have been returning 
from horseshoe kelp with impressive catches of barracuda to eight pounds and 
yellowtail 15 pounds and up. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Sportfishing's Dan Armstrong reports the bonito moved from rocky point 
to deeper water and the fleet has been catching some fish heavier than 10 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Fish and Game biologists attribute the excellent fishing to 
unusually warm water temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of dedicated rock cod anglers, South Bay landings will soon be 
scheduling deep water trips. 
</P>
<P>
The Outerlimits from L.A. Harbor Sportfishing returned from Cortez Bank over

Won Kim of Redondo Beach hooked a big calico bass fishing aboard the Matt Walsh 
at horseshoe kelp. 
</P>
<P>
Kim was using a small sardine bait and catching legal size calico bass and 
barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
He made a cast from the stern of the boat where bass were boiling and he set 
the hook on what turned out to be a trophy-size calico bass. 
</P>
<P>
He was reeling the fish toward the surface, but as soon as the bass sighted the 
boat it peeled line and went down to the kelp. Captain Don McIntyer, standing 
by with a net, urged Kim to reel in slowly. McIntyer said if the fish was not 
lost, he would like to donate it alive to the Cabrillo Marine Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Kim agreed and after 15 minutes, the bass came out of the kelp and was reeled 
in. The hook was carefully removed and the fish was placed in a bait tank. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's tank truck met the Matt Walsh and transported the 9-pound, 3-ounce 
calico bass to the museum. Larry Fukuhara, museum director, said the fish is 
being placed in a display tank and is one of the largest calicoes they have had 
for viewing. 
</P>
<P>

OCCIDENTAL ADOPTS GUIDELINES FOR FUTURE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THE SMALL LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE'S SWEEPING PLAN IS DESIGNED TO 
ATTRACT WOMEN AND MINORITY STUDENTS TO THE SCHOOL AND STRENGTHEN ITS TIES TO 
EAGLE ROCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Trustees of Occidental College has adopted a sweeping set of 
proposals aimed at making the campus more culturally diverse and strengthening 
its ties to the Eagle Rock community and urban Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive plan, intended to guide the private, liberal arts college 
into the next century, includes measures such as conducting a 
multimillion-dollar fund-raising campaign, raising teachers' salaries, solving 
a burgeoning financial aid problem, and diversifying science programs by 
attracting more women and minority students. 
</P>
<P>
The plan emerged from a two-year planning process known as "Occidental 
Tomorrow." More than 200 administrators, teachers, students and alumni made 
scores of recommendations and presented them to trustees last week in a 61-page 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Now, school officials say, comes the hard part: implementing and paying for the 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest challenges are finances," said Occidental President John 
Slaughter, who initiated the long-term, strategic planning process shortly 
after he took office in 1988. "We're worried about doing all of this at a time 
when the economy is shaky . . . when the University of California is in an 
expansionist mode . . . when the demographics are such that fewer and fewer 
students are coming out of high school and looking for a college education. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not optimum in terms of time," Slaughter said. "But we've got a lot of 
ingredients to overcome a lot of the roadblocks that are out there." 
</P>
<P>
The trustees decided to finance the initiatives by setting aside 1.5% of the 
school's education and general expenditures budget -- about $500,000 -- each 
year, starting in 1991. The trustees also agreed to begin within five years a 
multimillion-dollar fund-raising campaign. A 13-year campaign that raised $100 
million ended just two years ago, but the school's $150-million endowment needs 
an additional $100 million to be competitive, Slaughter said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the trustees approved forming a Planning and Priorities Council to 
determine which of the plan's recommendations should be implemented first. 
Administrators, teachers and students now are being appointed by Slaughter and 
others to serve as council members, said Jeff Coons, student body president. 
</P>
<P>
The plan has two general themes: encouraging cultural diversity and 
strengthening the school's ties to the community. 
</P>
<P>
It recommends increasing the number of minority students and teachers, changing 
the curriculum to better address the interests of a varied student body and 
getting ethnic groups to work together in multicultural programs. 
</P>
<P>
Although 40% of this year's freshmen are minority students, Occidental must 
continue recruiting more minority students and teachers, particularly in the 
sciences, the report says. Minorities made up 23% of the school's about 1,600 
students last year, and about 20% of the teaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also recommends sending students as volunteers to local schools and 
parks, and establishing the campus as a center for the arts in an effort to 
develop stronger community and metropolitan ties. 
</P>
<P>
"No other liberal arts college with which Occidental compares itself is so 
severed from its surroundings," says the report, which proposes that school 
officials consider actions such as building near the campus a "college 
village," or small shopping center to be used by students and the community. 
The report also recommends that the school appoint an administrator to oversee 
community relations. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that strengthening ties to Los Angeles really begins with 
strengthening ties to Eagle Rock as a part of Los Angeles," Slaughter said. "I 
mean, we're a small school. We're not going to be able to have a significant 
impact throughout the city, nor should we ever assume that we could. But we can 
have an impact in a few miles' radius around this campus." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the plan's proposals include: 
</P>
<P>
* Reducing the proportion of the college's about $38-million annual budget that 
is spent on financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
* Hiring at least 15 instructors in the next six years, raising faculty 
salaries, and removing caps on the number of instructors who can be granted 
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
* Strengthening the school's science programs. This could include constructing 
a new building for geology and physics, offering summer institutes for students 
and attracting more minorities and women into such fields, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
* Creating new offerings, such as a Public and International Affairs Program, 
and imposing tougher general requirements, such as higher levels of competence 
in foreign languages. 
</P>
<P>
More than 65% of Occidental's students now receive financial aid, accounting 
for about 25% of the school's budget. That has significantly reduced funds 
available for faculty salaries and academic programs, school officials said. 
They want to reduce the amount spent on financial aid to 20% of the budget by 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter and other administrators said they do not intend to cut financial 
aid, but instead want to find new sources of money to fund scholarships and 
loans and revise the distribution of such aid to make sure it goes to those 
students most in need. 
</P>
<P>
Shifting the burden of financial aid to the state and federal governments may 
not be easy. Funds for financial aid have dwindled in recent years. Occidental, 
which charges about $14,000 per year, has the fifth highest tuition in the 
state. And its biggest competitor for students is the UC system, which charges 
about $1,600 in tuition for California residents, Slaughter said. 
</P>
<P>
To finance the hiring of additional instructors, the budget for academic 
programs would have to be increased by 1% each year for 10 years, according to 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
"In down-to-earth reality, we have to find the money," said David Axeen, dean 
of the faculty, who helped develop the plan. "We want to continue to improve 
salaries. They're very good now and we want them to be excellent. But there are 
going to be trade-offs when it comes time to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the ideas included in the plan were being discussed at Occidental 
before Slaughter arrived, administrators and teachers said. But Slaughter, who 
succeeded Richard Gilman as president, is largely credited with acting on those 
ideas by initiating the long-term plan. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, students had been fighting for a new campus center for at least 
10 years, Coons said. But it was Slaughter's planning process that triggered 
the formation this year of a committee to help design the center, he said. 
Building the facility is one of the recommendations of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"By no means should it be construed that a new way of thinking is sweeping 
across the campus," Slaughter said. "My method of managing has always been to 
help people set goals for themselves, work hard to give them the tools to 
achieve them, then get the heck out of the way."

SNAG STALLS LONG-AWAITED DEMOLITION OF ELKS LODGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than four years after their lodge was mysteriously destroyed by arson, 
leaders of the Glendale Elks came prepared Monday to toast the demolition of 
the remnants of their old building and the symbolic start of a new one. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going to have a celebration," said chapter Exalted Ruler Stanley 
Germain, who was among about 30 Elks who showed up at the demolition site 
Monday with magnums of champagne. "We put up a sign at the club: 'Big party and 
lunch to follow.' " 
</P>
<P>
But the bubbles burst before the ceremony began. 
</P>
<P>
Demolition of the burned-out Elks building, long an eyesore at 120 E. Colorado 
St., has been delayed a month or more because of a communications snafu between 
Glendale city officials and developers. 
</P>
<P>
The former lodge, built in 1917 and listed on the city's roster of historic 
places, was destroyed in a $2-million blaze in January, 1986. Only a 1940s-era 
addition at the rear of the property remains. Members have been meeting in 
temporary quarters in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
After almost two years of negotiations, the Elks and a local developer last 
month signed an agreement to build a five-story hotel and lodge on the site. 
Demolition of the old building was to begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But, because of the site's historic designation, Elks learned Monday that they 
must first obtain permission from the city's Historic Preservation Commission 
and the City Council before demolition can begin. The building is the first to 
be demolished since the city adopted historic preservation rules in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been begging us to tear that building down for four years," Germain 
said. "Now they tell us we can't get a permit without a special meeting. We 
went all the way to the city manager." 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long time for those poor guys to be without a home," said 
developer Mike Howard of the Howard-Platz Group of Glendale, which wants to 
build the hotel and lodge. "They thought they finally were going to see 
something physically happening." 
</P>
<P>
City officials blamed the delay on a misunderstanding by developers. Dana 
Ogdon, a city planner, said the project contractor, Roland Constructors of 
Phoenix, was notified in April of the need for a demolition hearing. "They 
understood they had to go through the process, that any alteration of the site 
has to go to the commission and the council," Ogdon said. "It was just a 
misunderstanding of what they had to do." 
</P>
<P>
The burned rubble of the historic part of the lodge was cleared away in 1988 
without a hearing before the preservation commission because city officials 
said the debris was a safety hazard. Demolition of the rest of the building, 
however, is considered a voluntary alteration of a historic site, Ogdon said. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said developers had hoped to get the demolition, which will take about 
four weeks, completed before the holiday shopping season. The site is just east 
of the Glendale Galleria. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest that the demolition proposal could be brought before the 
preservation commission is Nov. 5. It will then take another two weeks to bring 
the commission's recommendation to the City Council, which can permit 
demolition of a historic site if preservation is deemed infeasible. The city 
can also decide whether a historic marker should be placed on a site. 
</P>
<P>
However, the delay is expected to push the project back to about Thanksgiving, 
which could cause construction vehicles to snarl holiday shopping traffic, 
Howard said. As a result, the project may have to be postponed until after the 
first of the year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little frustrating to be held up by a technicality," Howard said. "But 
we'll just have to abide by it." 
</P>
<P>
Just a few months before the lodge burned, the Elks had sought to have the 
dilapidated building's historic designation removed so that the club could have 
the structure razed. Club officials complained that the building had become 
costly to maintain and was too large for the club's shrinking membership. 
Renovation would have cost more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council turned down the club's request, suggesting that the Elks 
follow rules that permit demolition in cases of undue hardship. The fire 
occurred before the request was filed.

HOSPITAL THRIFT SHOP IS NEXT TO NONE; 
</P>
<P>
BIRTHDAYS: NEXT-TO-NEW AND ITS VOLUNTEER STAFF CELEBRATE 30 YEARS OF BARGAINS. 
THE STORE HAS GENERATED ABOUT $1 MILLION FOR GLENDALE MEMORIAL. 
</P>

<P>
Thrift shops have always been known for having unusual merchandise at low 
prices, but this month, the Next-to-New Shop in Glendale is adding a new 
feature to its lore: longevity. 
</P>
<P>
The shop at 210 E. Broadway is turning 30. It was opened in 1960 by the 
Glendale Memorial Hospital Guild of Volunteers to generate income for hospital 
projects. In its 30 years, the shop has contributed about $1 million to the 
hospital, spokesman Bryan Bishop said. Last year, the store made about $38,000. 
</P>
<P>
Next-to-New has been managed over the years by many volunteers, most of them 
women. But today, it is the domain of Alex Arszno, serving his second one-year 
term as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Arszno, 76, is a Glendale resident and lives just a few blocks from the shop. 
He comes in every morning before it opens to arrange the merchandise and tidy 
up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He only works Saturdays but drops in every afternoon just to make sure all is 
going smoothly. Even on Sundays, when the shop is closed, Arszno comes in to 
check the inventory. 
</P>
<P>
The store sells clothing, shoes, appliances, costume jewelry and an assortment 
of knickknacks. Clothing is its biggest seller, but it has had its share of 
unusual items such as antiques and musical instruments, said Ila May Nyquist, a 
charter member of the guild. 
</P>
<P>
Nyquist has been with the shop since it opened and said that among the objects 
that have come through the store and brought in the most money are musical 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we had a violin. It wasn't a Stradivarius, but we got quite a bit of 
money for it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Arszno donated a Yugoslavian accordion, which he had kept since 
immigrating from Germany, where he was a prisoner during World War II. It went 
on sale for $75. 
</P>
<P>
"It stayed in my closet for a long time," he said. "I never play, so I gave it 
away." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, customers come from film studios and theater costume shops 
looking for older or unusual clothing to be used in their productions. 
</P>
<P>
More common are those who need to stretch their dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"We get young people that want to furnish an apartment," volunteer Dorothy 
Baillie said. "Fifty dollars buys lots of stuff here." 
</P>
<P>
Arszno said he occasionally lowers prices for those who cannot afford what they 
want. Everyone wins, he said, because the customer can take the merchandise, 
and the store has made a sale. 
</P>
<P>
Arszno exhorts the other volunteers, who number more than 30 and are mostly 
senior citizens, to enjoy their work as much as he does. 
</P>
<P>
"I say, 'Be happy. It is our last job. We go from here to Forest Lawn,' " 
Arszno said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
When he retired after 27 years of working, most recently in shipping and 
receiving, Arszno took ceramics classes but found he wanted more activity. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the hospital, and they say, 'Alex, we can keep you here,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
He became a volunteer with the guild in 1980, and they sent him to the thrift 
shop, where he has been ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Arszno has had to deal with shoplifters on occasion and has 
caught a few red-handed. But he handles problems with a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
Once he caught a young man trying to take a pair of pants by putting them over 
his own pants, Arszno said. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Next time you wear bigger pants and then put the others under yours,' 
" he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Arszno credits simple friendliness with the store's success. 
</P>
<P>
"When you like people, they notice. The face shows when you like them," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the hospital has used the proceeds from the Next-to-New Shop 
for improvements such as the purchase of a $90,000 mammography machine, 
spokesman Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's contribution went into the hospital's new Heart and Emergency 
Center, which is currently under construction, Bishop said. The guild has 
pledged to contribute $1 million over the next five years for the new facility. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the shop's 30th anniversary, the shop will have an open house today 
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and a reunion of past presidents of the guild. 
</P>
<P>
The Next-to-New Shop is open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

GIVENS GETS HEAD START IN CITY RACE; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL: WITH TWO SEATS UP FOR GRABS IN THE APRIL 2 ELECTION, THE CIVIC LEADER 
BECOMES THE FIRST TO WAGE A CAMPAIGN, WHICH WILL FOCUS ON 'WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT 
GLENDALE.' 
</P>

The 1991 Glendale City Council campaign got off to an early start Tuesday when 
Eileen Hadley Givens, a resident with a long record of community service and a 
low political profile, became the first candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Two seats are at stake in the April 2 election, but City Clerk Aileen Boyle 
said candidates cannot file their nomination papers until January. 
Nevertheless, Givens kicked off her campaign with a press conference outside 
City Hall, introducing her family and the two prominent business leaders who 
will co-chair her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Why keep it a secret?" Givens said. "I want to have plenty of time for the 
people of Glendale to get to know me better." 
</P>
<P>
The candidate acknowledged that she was not highly visible in Glendale during 
the past two years because of her responsibilities as president of the 
26,000-member California division of the American Assn. of University Women. 
</P>
<P>
But she said, "That doesn't mean I've lost track of what's going on in 
Glendale." 
</P>
<P>
Although it is more than five months away, the spring election is gaining wide 
community interest because of uncertainty over the plans of incumbent 
Councilmen Larry Zarian and Jerold F. Milner. 
</P>
<P>
Zarian said he will announce within two weeks whether he will seek reelection. 
Milner, who was out of town this week, has not said whether he will run again. 
Zarian and Milner are both completing their second four-year terms on the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, incumbent John F. Day's decision not to seek another term led to 
Glendale's most widely contested campaign in four decades, as 13 candidates 
competed for three seats. Many of the challengers criticized the city leaders 
for allowing excessive development, which resulted in traffic jams and crowded 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Voters returned incumbents Ginger Bremberg and Carl W. Raggio to office, along 
with businessman Richard Jutras, a former planning commissioner and 
past-president of the Glendale Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
As she touched off the 1991 campaign, Givens also appeared to have the backing 
of some mainstream Glendale interests. Her campaign is being co-chaired by Mary 
Hamilton, a downtown businesswoman who just finished a term as president of the 
Glendale Chamber of Commerce, and John Hedlund, a printing company president 
who served two terms on the Glendale Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
Givens' campaign treasurer is accountant James D. Cashion, who serves on the 
Glendale Parking Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Givens said she has support from other civic leaders but she said she has not 
obtained their consent to make the endorsements public. She declined to 
criticize any of the current elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not campaigning against anyone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last campaign, I was disturbed to see many candidates running on 
negative platforms, saying what's wrong with Glendale. My platform will be 
based on what's good about Glendale." 
</P>
<P>
The candidate said the pace of development remains the major issue. She said 
she favors "controlled, managed growth" but presented no specific strategies 
regarding development. 
</P>
<P>
Givens' community service has included eight years on the Glendale Civil 
Service Commission and stints on the board of the Glendale Chamber of Commerce, 
the Glendale Family YMCA, the Glendale Education Foundation and the League of 
Women Voters of Glendale-Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
She also served on Glendale Unified School District advisory committees and on 
the Glendale City Charter Revision Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Givens has lived in Glendale since 1969. Her grandfather was governor of Oregon 
and served as U.S. secretary of the Interior under President Dwight Eisenhower.

STATE GRANTS NEW LIQUOR LICENSE TO STORE MOVING 475 FEET DOWN STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the objections of residents, state officials have granted a new liquor 
license to a Colorado Street business that wants to relocate 475 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
The license will allow owners of Colorado Liquor, 412 1/2 W. Colorado St., to 
sell alcohol at their new location, 470 W. Colorado St. The store is to open in 
about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control granted the license to store owner 
Sang Jong Cheun on the recommendation of a state judge. 
</P>
<P>
Cheun decided last year to move after his lease was not renewed, business 
associates have said. 
</P>
<P>
In January, however, ABC officials denied his request for a license at the new 
location after objections from residents in the 400 block of West Colorado 
Street and from the principal of nearby Thomas Edison Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents submitted a petition to licensing authorities, signed by 35 
residents opposing the move. They complained about traffic and litter, and said 
that despite the short distance involved, the move would add another liquor 
store to a half-block cluster that already has two convenience stores, a 
market, a drugstore and a restaurant, all of which sell beer and wine. 
</P>
<P>
Cheun appealed. During a hearing in June before Administrative Law Judge Paul 
Hogan, a business associate of Cheun's testified that trash would be collected 
diligently at the new location. 
</P>
<P>
In a ruling June 28, Hogan recommended granting a new liquor license. He said 
potential traffic and litter problems were unlikely because the store was 
moving only a short distance, said Mary Ann Presswood, an attorney for the 
state liquor control agency. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its initial denial, the department decided to follow Hogan's 
recommendation and on Aug. 23 granted the license, Presswood said. Residents 
did not appeal the decision, she said.

Photo, Heartfelt Message to Troops in Gulf: Students put their thoughts, wishes 
and prayers down on paper, along with whimsical cartoon characters, drawings 
and signatures, in a huge greeting to American soldiers who are now stationed 
in Saudi Arabia. The 60-foot-long banner contains 250 to 300 signatures and 
messages from students and community members. It was created at Flintridge 
Preparatory School in La Canada Flintridge by members of the Key Club, a 
nonprofit service organization that is sponsored by the Kiwanis Club. The club 
has about 45 teen-age members. The banner was sent to New York this week before 
being forwarded to the overseas troops. The notes and signatures on the 
colorful banner surround the central, large message that the club wanted to 
stress to the members of the military: "You're in Our Hearts." RICARDO

DR. HARROWER'S GOOD DEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I always enjoy Around the Foothills, but never more than on Sept. 27 because of 
your mention of the origin of the brick building on East Broadway as the 
Harrower Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Henry R. Harrower and his wife were responsible for my mother coming from 
London to Glendale and, years later, for the saving of her life. The story goes 
like this: 
</P>
<P>
My mother, Florence Southey Munce, was the English nanny for Dr. and Mrs. 
Harrower's daughter, Verna Haining. When Verna was a little girl, the family 
moved from London to Glendale. As is often the case in England, a very close 
emotional tie develops between a nanny or governess and the child. Such was the 
case here. In fact, Verna missed my mother so much that Dr. and Mrs. Harrower 
asked if mother would consider coming to Glendale to resume her position and 
she accepted. 
</P>
<P>
While here, my mother met my father at the Glendale Seventh-day Adventist 
Church (which was also attended by Dr. and Mrs. Harrower) and they were 
married. Then along came me. 
</P>
<P>
When I was about 8 years old, my mother became very ill, and since she was 
hemorrhaging extensively she was told that she must have surgery within 10 
hours or she might die. Nevertheless, the hospital would not admit her without 
money. We were in the midst of a Depression, and while we had a small home that 
was debt-free, my mother would not mortgage it to get the money. She refused to 
do so -- very courageously -- because she felt if the surgery was not 
successful that she wanted me to at least have a home. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Harrower came to the rescue. He had developed a liver extract that he was 
sure would replace the strength that she was losing. It was not yet on the 
market, but he gave her enough of the product, delivering it to her each day 
personally, that it did get her through the illness. The other kindnesses shown 
were also impressive. 
</P>
<P>
I was about 7 years old at the time -- my mother was about 48 years of age. I 
was blessed by having her with me for almost 30 years longer, and there is no 
question in my mind -- or in the mind of the doctor who had recommended the 
surgery -- that Dr. Harrower's liver extract saved her life. 
</P>
<P>
It is interesting that the wonderful, caring vibes that were there under Dr. 
Harrower's ownership seem to have remained in the building and have been picked 
up by David Bandley in his caring for the soldiers in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Harrower would be happy to know that.

GLENDALE'S WEBSTER MAKES BIG IMPRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 5-foot-5, Bobby Webster presents an elusive target for tacklers intent on 
knocking the number "6" off the back of his head, where it is sculpted in hair. 
</P>
<P>
The 175-pound Glendale College running back has been barreling over or away 
from much larger opponents all season. 
</P>
<P>
But when Webster is stopped and attempts to emerge from beneath a pileup, he 
cannot escape the grabbing and pinching that almost every ballcarrier expects 
-- nor the greetings personalized for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't repeat it for you in their exact words but it's pretty much, 'You 
little this, you little that. You Smurf, you gremlin,' " Webster said. "I take 
it as one big joke." 
</P>
<P>
Webster, who has gained 667 yards and scored nine touchdowns, has helped 
Glendale to three consecutive victories after an 0-2 start. He is one of the 
main reasons Vaquero coaches and players are again smiling and thinking 
seriously about a Western State Conference championship. Glendale is 3-1 in 
conference play, tied with Moorpark for first in the WSC's Northern Division. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like we're starting to come together," Glendale Coach John Cicuto 
said. "It seems like we're just getting stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Not coincidentally, so is Webster. 
</P>
<P>
After gaining 91 and 77 yards in season-opening losses to Pasadena, then ranked 
fourth in the nation, and top-ranked Bakersfield, Webster has increased his 
workload each game. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
* Webster carried 30 times for 143 yards and scored two touchdowns in 
Glendale's 21-12 victory over Los Angeles Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
* He carried 33 times for 186 yards and scored four touchdowns in the Vaqueros' 
37-27 win over Valley. 
</P>
<P>
* Last week, in Glendale's 35-22 victory over Pierce, Webster carried 34 times 
for 170 yards and scored two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Cicuto likens Webster to another small runner -- former USC tailback and 
Heisman Trophy winner Mike Garrett. 
</P>
<P>
"Garrett would get in and out of trouble and you'd say to yourself, 'How did he 
do it?' " Cicuto said. "Bobby looks like he's stopped all the time, and then, 
boom, he's escaped." 
</P>
<P>
Webster seems to thrive on hits rather than be punished by them. Contact that 
stops most backs in their tracks appears to propel Webster forward for extra 
yardage. 
</P>
<P>
"He almost never is taken down on the first hit," said Jim Sartoris, who 
coaches the Glendale running backs. "He's built low to the ground and when he 
runs he's even lower. He takes a lot of hits off his shoulder pads and really 
bounces so they don't get to his legs very easily. 
</P>
<P>
"He makes a lot of yards after he is initially hit. Usually, you think of a big 
back doing that, not a small one, so toughness is probably his No. 1 
attribute." 
</P>
<P>
Webster's toughness was not readily apparent when he arrived at Glendale by way 
of Pasadena High and Pasadena City College last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Webster had played strong safety throughout high school and also was listed as 
a running back. 
</P>
<P>
"They had me there so I could have a second position," Webster recalled. 
"Everyone knew I wasn't going to play." 
</P>
<P>
Five games into his senior season, however, Webster took over for the injured 
starter and rushed for more than 1,024 yards and 10 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by his success as a runner, Webster tried out at tailback last season at 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"More people were going on (to higher levels) as short tailbacks than short 
defensive backs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Webster left Pasadena after the preseason scrimmage, he said, because he 
was buried on the depth chart behind freshmen with more impressive high school 
credentials that had been accumulated in full senior seasons. 
</P>
<P>
He enrolled at Glendale last spring and impressed the coaching staff with his 
work ethic in non-contact workouts. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there were doubts about his size. 
</P>
<P>
"With someone that small, you're never quite sure if they're going to be 
durable enough to take the pounding at this level," Sartoris said. 
</P>
<P>
Webster opened the season behind sophomores Max Garcia and Curly Kirkpatrick, 
but it was clear after two games that Webster was the best runner. 
</P>
<P>
Teaming with bullish fullback Wes Bender, Webster now provides the Vaqueros 
with one of the most potent backfields in the WSC. 
</P>
<P>
"He worked extremely hard to get the opportunity," Cicuto said. "And he's not 
the type of kid who is ever going to relinquish it." 
</P>
<P>
Cicuto is hoping that his team's collective attitude will mirror Webster's 
Saturday when the Vaqueros play winless Ventura (0-5) at Ventura High. 
</P>
<P>
"The 0-5 really scares you," Cicuto said, dead serious. "Traditionally, they 
have a real strong program up there. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw them against Southwest and said, 'God, I can't believe this team has not 
won a game.' There's always a chance a young team like ours will look at them 
and say, 'They must not be very good.' " 
</P>
<P>
Webster, who also is one of the Vaqueros' most prolific cheerleaders, said he 
isn't about to let that happen. 
</P>
<P>
Former UCLA standouts James McAlister and Kermit Johnson, former USC tailback 
Fred Crutchfield, current USC tailback Ricky Ervins and California tailback 
Anthony Wallace are some of the standout running backs from the Pasadena area 
who went on to successful careers at the Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
Webster hopes to join that group when his Glendale career is over. 
</P>

COUPLE IN THEFT CASE SAY IT WAS A MISSION; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: PROSECUTORS CHARGE THE PAIR STOLE THE LIFE SAVINGS OF A GLENDALE 
ACCOUNTANT. THEY ARE ALSO SUSPECTED OF KILLING THE MISSING MAN.

A couple accused of stealing the motor home and life savings of a missing 
Glendale accountant were on a mission as "vagabonds for Christ," a federal 
defense attorney told a jury in Las Vegas on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The religious mission was offered in opening arguments as the defense 
explanation for the behavior of Stanley Alan Hershey, 46, and his pregnant 
wife, Jan Vicki Fine, 38, who allegedly spent the accountant's savings on 
travel and $2,500 silk suits. 
</P>
<P>
The two former California schoolteachers with master's degrees face 20 counts 
of fraud and theft in connection with the disappearance a year ago of Gordon T. 
Johnson, 62. Johnson was a retired employee of a subsidiary of Glendale Federal 
Bank. Authorities suspect Johnson was killed by Hershey and Fine, who 
prosecutors believe were compelled by inner spiritual voices into committing 
criminal acts. 
</P>
<P>
Because Johnson's body has not been found, no murder charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
The jury trial began Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas, where 
Hershey and Fine have been held without bail since their arrests March 1. 
</P>
<P>
Hershey and Fine are accused of stealing Johnson's motor home, his 
four-wheel-drive Suzuki and more than $120,000 in savings. Defense attorneys 
said they will argue that Johnson supported the religious mission and 
generously turned over his possessions. The defense has not yet explained the 
nature of a religious mission that included trips to Tahiti and expenditures on 
Italian suits. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson disappeared on Oct. 15, 1989, while traveling with his dog in a motor 
home in Oregon. The FBI and authorities in several states say they believe that 
Johnson was slain and that his body may have been dumped in Shasta Lake in 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury indictment says Hershey and Fine stayed at two motor home 
parks -- in Minnesota and Oregon -- at the same time last fall as Johnson and 
left Oregon at the same time that Johnson disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charges that Hershey rented a boat at Shasta Lake on Oct. 16 and 
that Hershey and Fine began draining Johnson's bank account by using his checks 
and bank credit cards for luxury purchases and travel, including a trip to 
Tahiti. 
</P>
<P>
Hershey and Fine were arrested in Las Vegas by FBI agents after they were found 
driving a Suzuki owned by Johnson, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
A federal magistrate ordered the couple held without bail because he said the 
evidence "points a very strong finger of suspicion" at Fine and Hershey in the 
possible killing of Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys said the government has no proof that Hershey and Fine did 
not have permission from Johnson to use his credit cards, checking account or 
to drive and use his motor home and Suzuki. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors argued Wednesday that after law enforcement officers found the 
motor home in Arizona, the couple fled to Las Vegas, where they went on a wild 
spending spree before their arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have called the case one of the most bizarre they have 
encountered. They say the suspects apparently are disciples of the practice of 
"automatic writing," in which spirits are said to guide peoples' hands in 
spelling out their destiny. 
</P>
<P>
Hershey and Fine met in 1987 while teaching at a private school for troubled 
and learning disabled teen-agers in Santa Monica. They were married in 1988 in 
New Orleans where Fine worked as a teacher and Hershey had a private counseling 
business and gave motivational talks on television. 
</P>
<P>
Hershey's former wife, who declined to be identified, said Hershey's 
personality changed suddenly in 1986 when he said spirits told him to end their 
13-year marriage, change jobs and change his life. 
</P>
<P>
In her opening argument in defense of Fine, Federal Public Defender Franny 
Forsman portrayed Fine as an insecure, lonely woman who was unloved until she 
met Hershey. Forsman told the jury that Fine "believes that Hershey has a 
direct line to a spirit guide" and that she felt they had permission to do 
everything they did because the spirits told them so.

REFILLING HANSEN DAM LAKE GETS FLOOD OF SUPPORT; 
</P>
<P>
RECREATION: THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS HOPES TO RETURN THE AREA TO WHAT IT WAS 
BEFORE THE LATE 1970S -- ONE OF LOS ANGELES' LARGEST PARKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The waters of Holiday Lake at Hansen Dam Recreation Area were once so inviting 
that Teddy Treadwell and her family bought a boat, took up fishing and even 
moved to the east San Fernando Valley to be near their favorite park. 
</P>
<P>
But their lakeside lifestyle was ruined in the late 1970s when the 140-acre 
lake, the centerpiece of a thriving regional park, was choked by years of silt 
accumulation and neglect, reducing it to a muddy pond. When the water vanished, 
so did the throngs of visitors and the park degenerated into a homeless 
encampment. This week, however, East Valley residents expressed hope that the 
park can stage a comeback, voicing overwhelming support for a plan by the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers to build lakes and undertake a sweeping revitalization 
that would transform the area back into one of the largest parks in the city of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Along with a 10-acre lake that would be used exclusively for swimming, the plan 
calls for renovation of the sprawling 1,400-acre Lake View Terrace site with 
hiking and horseback riding trails, a wildlife preserve, playing fields and the 
eventual development of two 15- and 70-acre lakes connected by a stream. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been waiting for this park and lake to come back for years. It's been 
the most important issue for many of us up here," said Treadwell, 65, of Shadow 
Hills. "We are thrilled to get anything at this point. It was devastating for 
us when the lake was shut down." 
</P>
<P>
After years of clamoring from East Valley residents, who viewed the loss of the 
popular recreation site as a slap to the community, Rep. Howard Berman 
(D-Panorama City) pressured the Army two years ago to draft a long-term plan to 
revitalize the area. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, about $875,000 in state and federal money has been set aside 
to build the swimming lake, scheduled for completion in early 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Also, in Los Angeles County, Proposition B, a $816-million park bond measure, 
would allocate $15 million specifically for Hansen Dam renovation if voters 
approve the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Park proponents are also praying for rain. 
</P>
<P>
"If the drought continues, we have no idea where we will get the water to fill 
the lake," said Frank Catania, director of planning and development for the 
city Recreation and Parks Department. "We are hoping for a big rain in the next 
three years." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Army owns the site, built in the 1940s to control rain runoff and 
collect silt washed down from the San Gabriel Mountains, it leases the land to 
the city parks department. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Tatum, assistant general manager of the parks department, said the city 
is committed to maintaining the renovated park, which would be built in phases 
depending on the availability of local, state and federal money. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Recreation and Park Commissions and the Army are expected to 
complete and approve the Hansen Dam Master Plan within three months. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent the devastating silt buildup that choked the lake a decade ago, 
officials plan to relocate the new lake on higher ground and run a contract 
with a private company to continuously dredge the area. 
</P>
<P>
A series of brush fires and winter storms in the late 1970s clogged the lake 
with millions of tons of sand and debris. Dredging operators were brought in 
too late to save it. In 1982, all that remained of Holiday Lake was a swampy 
puddle. A protracted legal dispute between the Army and dredging operators 
prevented plans for restoration of the lake until recently. 
</P>
<P>
With the promised resurgence of the lake, residents hope the park will attract 
thousands of families again and represent a renaissance in the East Valley, 
which has been troubled by growing crime and gang problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's about time we start investing in this community," said Napoleon 
O'Neal, 74, who has lived in Pacoima for 40 years. "We don't have anything up 
here for all the new people that are moving in. We need that lake so the new 
kids can swim and fish like mine used to."

ELECTIONS / 22ND SENATE DISTRICT;

<P>
DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT COASTING TO 3RD TERM AS RACE ENTERS HOME STRETCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As the fall election campaign enters its final weeks, liberal Democratic state 
Sen. Herschel Rosenthal of Los Angeles appears to be coasting toward a third 
term in the Legislature's upper house. 
</P>
<P>
The 22nd Senate District he represents is pure Democratic turf. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats outnumber Republicans almost 2 to 1. Of the 341,826 registered 
voters, 200,364 are Democrats; 104,349 are Republicans; and 30,890 are 
independents. Only 6,223 belong to minor parties. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Rosenthal, 72, easily crushed a Democratic primary challenge from 
attorney William Graysen, and he now faces Republican businessman Michael 
Schrager of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the Senate Energy and Public Utilities Committee, Rosenthal has 
been voicing concern over what may happen to air quality in the proposed merger 
of Southern California Edison Co. and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
Long a reliable environmental vote, he authored two bills that would have given 
the California Coastal Commission greater power to crack down on illegal 
development. Both measures were vetoed last month by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal served for eight years as assemblyman in the 45th District before 
being elected to the Senate in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
He has been an active opponent of capital punishment and of attempts to limit 
free speech, and has supported increased state financing for education and 
programs for senior citizens and low-income people. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager, 35, describes himself as a Republican who is fiscally conservative 
but socially moderate. He opposes curbs on abortion and says improving public 
education through increased funding is a major theme of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The challenger said he is taking his first stab at public office out of 
frustration at Rosenthal's record of achievement. "Herschel seems to be a very 
non-active player in the Legislature," Schrager said. 
</P>
<P>
Peace and Freedom candidate Margery Hinds of Los Angeles will also be on the 
ballot. She is a medical assistant.

SENATE: 22ND DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Questionnaires were distributed to candidates this month. Answers have been 
edited to fit the available space. 
</P>
<P>
Family Sick Leave 
</P>
<P>
Q. Gov. Deukmejian recently vetoed legislation that would have granted workers 
as much as four months of unpaid leave every two years to care for sick 
children, spouses and other family members without fear of losing their jobs. 
Do you favor this type of legislation? 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager: No. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Salaries 
</P>
<P>
Q. The Legislature approved a 4.7% cost-of-living raise for school employees, 
and Gov. Deukmejian reduced it to 3%, placing the difference in an account for 
special education programs. Should this money be used for salaries? 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager: No. The account for special education programs should be just that -- 
special education. However, administration, materials, teaching assistants' and 
special educators' salaries may be included. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds: Yes. Teachers and teaching assistants are the most important and 
essential part of education. So, that education means money for salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Big Green 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 128, the so-called "Big Green" initiative on the November 
ballot, seeks to eliminate ozone-depleting chemicals by the year 2000, phase 
out pesticides known to cause cancer and require that trees be planted in all 
new developments. Do you support this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager: No. While the idea is good, and necessary, you cannot correct 200 
years of damage with the passing of a single initiative. I must ask why the 
Assembly and state Senate have turned down seven separate anti-pollution bills 
in the eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds: Yes. We need to stop greedy, corporate polluters. We need clean air for 
ourselves and our children. 
</P>
<P>
Tree-Cutting 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 130 on the November ballot would restrict clear-cutting of 
forests, allow the sale of $710 million in bonds to preserve ancient redwood 
forests and provide $32 million to retrain unemployed loggers. Do you support 
this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager: I have not read the text, but I do support a restriction of 
clear-cutting forests. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Limited Terms 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 131 on the November ballot, authored by Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp and Common Cause, would limit most statewide elected officials to eight 
consecutive years in office, and senators and Assembly members to 12 years. 
Proposition 140, sponsored by Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, is 
more stringent, limiting lifetime service to eight years in the Senate and six 
in the Assembly. Do you support limiting the number of terms state legislators 
can serve? If yes, how long should the limits be? 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: No. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager: Yes. Limiting the number of consecutive terms in a given office will 
cause an increase in government efficiency and responsiveness. I support 
Proposition 140. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds: No. Two terms for state Senate and three terms for Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Sales Tax 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 133 on the November ballot would raise state sales and use taxes 
by 0.5% for four years to raise $7.5 billion for drug enforcement and 
treatment, anti-drug education, and prison and jail construction and operation. 
Do you support this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager: No. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds: No. No more jails. No more regressive taxes on workers and the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Liquor Tax 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 134 on the November ballot would substantially raise taxes on 
beer, wine and liquor, and dedicate the revenue from the tax hike to programs 
for the treatment of drug and alcohol abuse. Do you support this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager: No. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Inmate Laborers 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 139 on the November ballot would allow private companies to hire 
state prison and county jail inmates as laborers. Do you support this 
initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: No. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds: No. 
</P>
<P>
Death Penalty 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support capital punishment? If so, do you think it should be imposed 
on those convicted of importing or selling drugs? 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: No. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager: Yes, I support the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds: No. Almost everyone on death row are blacks and Latinos and illiterates. 
No rich person receives the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Handgun Controls 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support additional limits on handgun purchase or possession in 
California? 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal: Yes. People purchasing handguns should be required to take a safety 
and proficiency course. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager: No. With proper registration, waiting period and background check, we 
should have enough restrictions. Getting handguns off the black market is 
another matter. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds: No. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion Rights 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support a woman's right to unrestricted abortions within the first 
three months of pregnancy? 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager: Yes, except for gender selection or as a method of birth control. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion Funding 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support government funding of abortions for women who cannot afford 
them? 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager: No. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Day-Care Services 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe the state should require private employers to subsidize 
day-care services for employees who request them? 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Yes. Access to day-care means more productive employees, less 
absenteeism and, most important, provides a safe environment for children who 
would otherwise be left unattended. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager: No. If left to business, they will provide this service as a perk. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds: Yes. We face a lack of child care for working parents, and corporations 
are in the best position to solve this immediate problem. 
</P>
<P>
War on Drugs 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe our present strategy of criminal prosecution, interdiction of 
supplies and imprisonment of users and dealers will ever significantly reduce 
the level of drug use in the United States? If no, what should be done? 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: No. We need more aggressive drug education programs in the schools 
and more community outreach and intervention programs in concert with the 
above. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager: No. We are dealing with a product whose supply seems to be endless. 
Education at all levels must increase. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds: No. We need to end the war economy in the United States and start a 
program of socialized medicine, mass public housing, more money for public 
education and more well-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Drug Decriminalization 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would you consider supporting the decriminalization of drug use? 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: No. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager: No. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Oil Exploration 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think the present Mideast crisis justifies opening up additional 
parts of the California coastline to oil exploration? 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: No. We must shift our focus from oil dependency to expanding the use 
of alternative, cleaner fuels. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager: Yes, for exploration. No, for drilling. We should always be aware of 
where our resources are. However, we have seen in Houston what dependence on 
oil development can do to the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds: No. Our beaches are the favorite recreation of poor and working people 
in California. We cannot take a chance of spoiling that with oil drilling. We 
need oil conservation, not drilling. 
</P>
<P>
Parkland Exchange 
</P>
<P>
Q. Should the National Park Service exchange 50 acres in Cheeseboro Canyon in 
southeastern Ventura County for about 1,100 acres of the neighboring Jordan 
Ranch owned by entertainer Bob Hope, permitting park agencies to buy another 
4,600 acres of Hope's land in the Santa Monica and Santa Susana mountains for 
$10 million? 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds: No answer. 
</P>
<P>
Mandatory Ride-Sharing 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you favor mandatory ride-sharing in an effort to meet government air 
pollution standards? 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: I can foresee a time in the future when such action could become 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager: No. For some offices, mandatory ride-sharing would work. However, a 
system of rewards as is in place in Los Angeles is better. The answer is to 
provide public transportation that works. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Political Funding 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support full or partial public funding of political campaigns? 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: No. Taxpayers would have no control over which candidate received 
their money. Extremists like members of the Ku Klux Klan would be eligible for 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager: No. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds: Yes, so candidates are not beholden to established economic interests, 
as we have now. 
</P>
<P>
Income Disclosure 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are you willing to publicly release your income tax returns and those of 
your spouse prior to the November election? 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager: Yes. In addition, when elected, I will release all Senate office 
expenses, votes and authored legislation text. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Porter Ranch 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support development of the massive Porter Ranch project in the hills 
north of Chatsworth as presently configured? 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal: No. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager: No. 
</P>
<P>
Hinds: No. Most residents in that area are opposed. We need to decrease 
pollution and congestion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

Johnny Reese, 44, of Palmdale, the driver of the tractor-trailer truck that was 
hauling pool chemicals, was treated for inhalation of fumes from the spilled 
chemical, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
He was not seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Officer A.J. Torres said only five gallons of the chemical spilled from the 
truck at 7:30 a.m. near the freeway's San Fernando Road on-ramp. CHP officers 
and a Los Angeles County Fire Department hazardous-materials unit blocked two 
of the four southbound lanes, Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the spill was cleaned up by 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
With motorists on the normally heavy southbound commute crowded into the two 
open lanes, traffic slowed to a bumper-to-bumper crawl and backed up more than 
a mile. The southbound on-ramp from San Fernando Road to the freeway was also 
closed during the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP said the spill apparently occurred when a pallet of muriatic acid 
containers shifted and several containers broke open.

'NINJA TURTLES' BARRELS UP RENTAL CHART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT , Arts and entertainment reports from The Times, national and 
international news services and the nation's press.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cowabunga! "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie" -- a live-action 
comedy/adventure -- is an instant rental chart smash. A new entry, it barreled 
up to No. 4 on the Billboard chart. 
</P>
<P>
This box-office blockbuster ($132.5 million) is priced low at $24.99 and geared 
to the sales market. But it's still a hot item in the rental market, possibly 
strong enough to bump "Glory" out of the top spot. "The Guardian," a fright 
flick that should be popular around Halloween, debuted at No. 29. "Henry: 
Portrait of a Serial Killer" isn't doing badly in the rental market, bounding 
up nine places to No. 21. 
</P>
<P>
* Snidely dubbed "Top Gun Jr.," "Fire Birds" did just OK at the box office: 
$14.7 million. Based on that figure, you'd think it would have a relatively 
short rental life, struggling up into the teens on the chart. But this military 
action drama is doing a surprisingly strong rental business, blasting up to No. 
9 in just two weeks. Possibly star Nicolas Cage is a bigger draw in the rental 
market than anyone realizes.

CRITIC AT LARGE: ROBERT RADNITZ NEVER FORGETS FAMILY AUDIENCE; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: AFTER A SIX-YEAR HIATUS, THE PRODUCER OF 'SOUNDER' IS READYING A TV 
DOCUDRAMA AND HAS A DEAL AT PARAMOUNT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former English teacher named Robert Radnitz has produced some of Hollywood's 
most distinguished family films, including "A Dog of Flanders" (his first), 
"Island of the Blue Dolphins," "Misty" and the much-honored "Sounder" in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Sex, violence and mayhem generally do not loom large in his output, even in his 
more mature-themed works such as "Birch Interval" and "Cross Creek," his 
adaptation of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' autobiographical stories. 
</P>
<P>
But this has not been a congenial era for films low in sex, violence or high in 
challenging themes. "Cross Creek," his last film, was six years ago. Until 
recently, Radnitz has been developing projects that studios insist they admire 
a lot but say they are bypassing for their lack of those essential ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
In Hollywood, however, nothing is forever, including the stranglehold of the 
heavy stuff. Barry Levinson's family chronicle, "Avalon," both sentimental and 
incisive, hints that things may change. Bob Radnitz himself has a new 
development deal at Paramount and is in post-production on a film for Turner 
Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
The new film for television, directed by Joseph Sargent and written by Ron 
Rubin, is called "Never Forget." It is a docudrama about Mel Mermelstein, an 
Auschwitz survivor now running a successful small business in Southern 
California, who took on an organization called the International Historical 
Research Society, which was offering $50,000 to anyone who could prove that the 
Holocaust actually took place. 
</P>
<P>
"At first nobody wanted to take on this outfit. 'Don't give them the attention' 
was the idea," Radnitz said the other day. "Even Mel's kids thought he was 
wrong. But he found a feisty lawyer -- a Texan and a Roman Catholic named Bill 
Cox -- who said, 'We're the good guys and they're the bad guys; let's go.' 
Eventually it led to the first formal judicial statement that the Holocaust was 
a fact." Leonard Nimoy stars as Mermelstein. It will air in April, the month 
for international Holocaust observances. 
</P>
<P>
The first Paramount project is one Radnitz, 65, has been nursing for years, a 
filming of "The Witch of Blackbird Pond," from a Newberry Prize novel by 
Elizabeth Spear that has sold more than 4 million copies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about a young girl -- I think of her as part Scarlett O'Hara and part 
Cathy of 'Wuthering Heights' -- in the Colonial period. Her father, the 
governor of the Barbados, dies and she goes to live with Puritans in 
Connecticut." There is a friendly witch and a romance with a sea captain. 
</P>
<P>
A second project at Paramount, on which Radnitz is working with David Ward 
("The Sting"), is the classic Robert Louis Stevenson adventure, "Black Arrow." 
"David and I discovered we both love the Scribner's editions of Stevenson with 
the J.C. Wyeth illustrations," Radnitz says. He is also working with Ward on an 
original called "The Perfect Specimen." 
</P>
<P>
Radnitz has purchased, from the manuscript, a novel called "Aurora 7," by 
Thomas Mallon, a teacher at Vassar, about the day (May 24, 1962) Scott 
Carpenter went up in Aurora 7. It is in particular about a 7-year-old space 
freak who runs away from home to get nearer the action. 
</P>
<P>
Radnitz is very excited about "Aurora 7," which will be published in January. 
"It looks at everybody on that day. A young American is leaving Russia to come 
back to the United States with his Russian wife -- Lee Harvey Oswald. John 
Kennedy is studying two announcements about the flight -- one for use if it's a 
success, one if it fails." 
</P>
<P>
Radnitz thinks that "the day of the blockbuster may be over. Hopefully pictures 
about people are coming back. I still see the need for the kind of films I set 
out to make: films that deal with this country then and now, films that 
families can see together, children and adults, each on their own level." 
</P>
<P>
What distributors don't fully understand, Radnitz adds, is that his kind of 
films, never blockbusters, nonetheless have a pleasant longevity. "I made 
'Island of the Blue Dolphins' in 1962 and just the other day I got another 
check, a very nice check, for royalties on it. There's always an audience." 
</P>
<P>
Radnitz has a notably tempting wish list of projects: James Fenimore Cooper's 
Leatherstocking Saga; a musical version of "Sounder"; Willa Cather's "O 
Pioneer," to which Radnitz recently won the film rights, and, for television, a 
miniseries based on Thomas Wolfe's "Look Homeward, Angel."

BRIEF FILED SUPPORTING LEWITZKY LAWSUIT

<P>
A coalition of more than 160 theaters, playwrights, directors, actors and 
theater figures has filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Los Angeles 
choreographer Bella Lewitzky in a lawsuit challenging an anti-obscenity 
certification imposed on grantees by the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The petition was filed in federal court in Los Angeles earlier this week after 
the judge in the case rejected a motion by government lawyers to dismiss 
Lewitzky's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
In the action, the choreographer, who turned down a $72,000 NEA grant earlier 
this year to protest the obscenity certification, seeks a ruling that the 
endowment requirement is unconstitutionally vague and interferes with First 
Amendment guarantees of freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
In filing the friend-of-the-court brief, the New York-based Theatre 
Communications Group, which organized the action, said that it will also 
attempt to enter a related case in New York in which the New School for Social 
Research has asked for an injunction against the NEA certification process on 
grounds it amounts to a loyalty oath. 
</P>
<P>
A judge is expected to rule almost any day in the New School case. The 
university is the institutional parent of the Otis/Parsons Art Institute in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Joining in the brief were actors Colleen Dewhurst, Stephen Collins. Stockard 
Channing, Kevin Kline, Olympia Dukakis, Christopher Reeve, Ron Silver and James 
Earl Jones, as well as authors Ariel Dorfman, Terrence McNally and Eduardo 
Machado. Drama centers ranging from the American Contemporary Theater in San 
Francisco and the California Shakespeare Festival in Berkeley to the Arena 
Stage in Washington and City Theatre Company in Pittsburgh also joined in.

BILL BRUFORD: MARCHING TO BEAT OF HIS OWN DRUM; 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ: THE VETERAN BELIEVES DRUMMERS SHOULD REACH BEYOND RHYTHM AND STRETCH INTO 
HARMONY AND MELODY AS WELL. HIS QUARTET PLAYS THE STRAND TONIGHT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Bruford doesn't have to worry about traveling to the beat of a different 
drummer: the evolutionary English percussionist's own approach to rhythm will 
do just fine. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always felt it was unnecessary to try and cover the work that other 
drummers are doing so brilliantly," Bruford, 40, said. "Maybe my time would be 
better spent trying to find something that other drummers don't do and see if 
that proves fruitful." 
</P>
<P>
Bruford, who brings his Earthworks band to the Strand in Redondo Beach tonight, 
has long espoused the philosophy that drummers should also reach beyond being 
mere rhythm players and stretch into the areas of harmony and melody as well. 
</P>
<P>
Putting his money on the line, Bruford -- known to pop fans for his work with 
Yes, King Crimson and, most recently ex-Yes men Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman and 
Howe -- plays the Simmons SDX. The SDX is a state-of-the-art electronic drum 
set that through a Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) can be linked to 
a multitude of other electronic instruments. This set-up allows access to 
sounds previously only heard in a drummer's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"I can play all kinds of exotic things from the sounds of Africa and Latin 
America to cowbells and gongs or notes and chords. It even sounds like drums 
sometimes, too," said the musician who led the fusion band Bruford, with 
guitarist Allan Holdsworth and bassist Jeff Berlin, from 1978-80. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of on the extreme edge of what a drummer does. I keep a kind of 
pulse, but it's very melodic as well. I come up with very intriguing percussion 
figures and chords that can be jumped on by the guys in the band." 
</P>
<P>
Bruford's melodies are usually played on a Yamaha DX-7 synthesizer, which is 
MIDI-ed to his drums. "The keyboards are triggered from the drum pads," he 
explained, "and by hitting the pads at varying velocities, and in different 
positions, you get a different sound." 
</P>
<P>
Reflective of Bruford's singular way of making music is Earthworks, a quartet 
with Iain Bellamy, saxes, Django Bates, E Flat tenor horn and keyboards and Tim 
Harries, bass. The band's most recent LP is "Dig?" (Editions EG) and has 
everything from avant-garde edgy numbers to serene ballads dappled with 
electronics. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of our music is unstructured, but it's definitely jazz," he said. "We 
actually play quite carefully, though in a sloppy kind of way, limiting 
ourselves to what we feel is effective rather than just wasting notes." 
</P>
<P>
The leader finds the blending of acoustic and electronic sounds appealing. 
"Electronics don't have to be harsh," he said. "We're looking for a warm sound, 
one that provides an entertaining and refreshing kind of jazz." 
</P>
<P>
Bruford, Bellamy and Bates have been together for almost five years; Harries 
joined in 1988. That length of time has provided a closeness and musical acuity 
that leads to exhilarating performances, Bruford said. "I'm still a believer in 
groups that don't change personnel often, because when you know each other, you 
can get spills, chills and cliff-hanging accidents. You have the opportunity to 
take risks and know that if you make a mess, somebody will be there to clear up 
the pieces," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bruford feels he's making some of the best music of his 20-year career, thanks 
in good part to his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"With these musicians, I can detach myself and thoroughly enjoy being at the 
gig of which I'm the drummer. I can also play less. I'm old enough now to 
realize you don't have to do the history of drumming in each tune." 
</P>
<P>
The native of Kent, England, began drumming as a preteen, playing a pair of 
brushes his sister gave him. As a teen-ager, he was enthralled by the swing and 
Dixieland drummers he saw on television but they were nothing compared to 
hearing saxophonist Graham Bond's R&amp;B/jazz band, with bassist Jack Bruce 
and guitarist John McLaughlin, in person. "That group absolutely branded me for 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Though jazz-influenced, Bruford first opted to play in rock bands. 
</P>
<P>
"Rock was the exciting place to be in London in 1968-69, much more exciting 
than jazz, which was asleep," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's exactly the opposite. Jazz, without all the rules and regulations 
with which it was once encumbered, is infinitely more interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his prominence in percussion circles, Bruford tends to look upon 
himself with a stern eye. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not terribly keen on myself as a musician," he said. "I have that classic 
British middle-class inability to pretend I'm any good at anything much. I feel 
that at any moment somebody might point a finger at me and say, "You're a 
charlatan." 
</P>
<P>
"Half the time I think anybody could do what I do, then I realize that anybody 
isn't doing it and I feel better again." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, music helps Bruford get a clearer view of who and what he is. 
</P>
<P>
"I see music as a mirror," he said. "I can look at myself performing and say 
that though I might not like what I see, at least that's what I am and I have 
an opportunity for changing myself at that point. That change can be both 
personal and with those around me."

CARL LEWIS UNDERGOES KNEE SURGERY, EXPECTED TO MISS INDOOR TRACK SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Carl Lewis underwent arthroscopic surgery Tuesday in Houston to remove damaged 
cartilage from his right knee, according to his manager, Joe Douglas of the 
Santa Monica Track Club. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas said the knee bothered Lewis for the entire track season, particularly 
after the Goodwill Games in July. 
</P>
<P>
"Carl didn't complain, but some people noticed that he didn't have any power in 
his first 30 meters," Douglas said. "He couldn't burst out of the blocks 
because it was painful. 
</P>
<P>
"Once he was running at full stride, it was OK. He was still the fastest in the 
last 70 meters, but he was usually much farther behind than he normally would 
have been." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas said Lewis expects to resume working out within four weeks, although he 
does not plan to compete in the indoor season. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, 29, was beaten several times at 100 meters this year. But he continued a 
winning streak in the long jump that began in 1981. RANDY HARVEY

BOWL REPRESENTATIVES FLOCK TO USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Even if USC lost twice in its last six games, it probably would be invited to a 
New Year's Day bowl game, Jim Brock, executive director of the Cotton Bowl, 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"USC's always been on our wish list," Brock said. 
</P>
<P>
"With three losses, I don't think they'd be out of our hunt. USC is definitely 
on our elite list. They're in the upper echelon. I'd be surprised if USC wasn't 
on everybody's list." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of eight bowl games -- the Cotton, Citrus, Holiday, Freedom, 
Sugar, Copper, Peach and John Hancock -- will be at the USC-Arizona game 
Saturday at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got a marquee player in the quarterback (Todd Marinovich)," Brock said 
of the Trojans. "They've got other players who are going to be future stars in 
the NFL. They've got tradition, a great record since (Coach) Larry Smith has 
been there. They're appealing. I could see a potential USC-Texas or USC-Texas 
A&amp;M matchup (in the Cotton Bowl) as being a really marquee football game. 
</P>
<P>
"USC's always going to be in the elite bowl-invitation group. Any New Year's 
Day bowl would love to have them." 
</P>
<P>
According to research by the Pacific 10 Conference and the NFL, USC had 38 
players on opening-day NFL rosters this season, more than any other school.

NOW OFFICIALS ARE THE ONES BEING FLAGGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A banner season for college game officials, it hasn't been. Upon further review 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 -- An obvious last-second pass interference infraction is seen by everyone 
except the dunderhead officiating crew in charge of monitoring such things at 
last Saturday's Michigan-Michigan State game. The no-call costs Michigan its 
No. 1 ranking and its chances of controlling its Rose Bowl destiny. 
</P>
<P>
As consolation, Dave Parry, Big Ten Conference supervisor of officials, phones 
Michigan Coach Gary Moeller and confirms that the officiating crew blew the 
crucial play. Big whoop. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A week earlier, a frozen-above-the-neck Big Eight Conference crew fails to 
notice that Colorado has mistakenly been granted a fifth down during the waning 
moments of a game against Missouri. The Buffaloes use the extra down to score a 
touchdown and defeat the stunned Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the offending crew is suspended indefinitely by the red-faced Big 
Eight. A footnote: Though no official announcement has been made, the crew 
members could return to action as early as this Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And a week before the Colorado-Missouri fiasco, Tennessee linebacker Darryl 
Hardy apparently intercepts an Auburn pass in the fourth quarter that could 
help seal the game for the Volunteers. Three referees converge on the play, two 
of them ruling the ball was caught by Hardy for an interception. A third 
official overrules them and declares the ball was dropped. Replays seem to 
indicate otherwise. Auburn goes on to tie the game. 
</P>
<P>
Big games. Bad calls. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, officiating is an inexact profession, and for the most part, officials 
make correct call after correct call. But how hard is it to count to four? 
Missouri Coach Bob Stull would have appreciated it. 
</P>
<P>
And how difficult is it to toss a flag when a receiver is being grabbed by the 
jersey and then tripped as he struggles to run a pass pattern on a two-point 
conversion attempt? After all, if the folks in Row ZZ can see it, the officials 
on the field ought to be able to notice the same thing. Or so Moeller thought. 
</P>
<P>
The answer seems obvious: instant replay. 
</P>
<P>
A replay probably would have prevented the fifth-down confusion at Missouri. It 
would have alleviated much of the indecision involving the would-be 
interception at Auburn. And if the NCAA altered the rules under which the NFL 
uses the video system, replay could have corrected the non-interference call at 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, don't hold your breath. Instant replay will make its collegiate 
debut about the same time Colorado Coach Bill (Good Sport) McCartney forfeits 
the victory over Missouri, which is to say never. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years ago, Art McNally, the NFL supervisor of officials, addressed 
the NCAA's football rules committee on the league's use of instant replay. The 
committee was intrigued, but nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it would be nice in a perfect world," said Mike Earle, the NCAA's 
director of publications, who attends the January rules committee meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of instant replay is the major problem. The NFL paid $500,000 for 
equipment alone. A replay official is paid $1,000 a game. A communicator, who 
is in radio contact with the on-field officials, is paid $200. Add travel 
expenses and the cost of updating the equipment and it's obvious why the NCAA 
has dismissed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the same football rules must apply to all NCAA members, including 
Division I, II and III programs. It's doubtful most of the powerful Division I 
schools could afford a scaled-down instant replay system. It's all but 
guaranteed that no Division III program could. 
</P>
<P>
Now that we've reached the halfway point of the season, some knee-jerk reaction 
seems in order. Submitted for approval are these observations: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Three teams we never expected to see with these losing records: Hawaii 
(1-3), Arkansas (2-3) and Missouri (2-4). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Three teams we never expected to see with these winning records: Georgia 
Tech (5-0), Indiana (4-0-1) and Texas Christian (5-1). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Best players you still haven't seen on network television: Wyoming 
defensive lineman Mitch Donahue and Northern Illinois quarterback Stacey 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Future game we never thought would determine the regular-season No. 1 
ranking: Nov. 3 -- Georgia Tech vs. Virginia at Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Most dominant team: none. 
</P>
<P>
Early bowl update: The Cotton Bowl is sending representatives to Arizona-USC, 
Miami-Notre Dame, Florida State-Auburn, Iowa-Michigan and Michigan 
State-Illinois. Now that Texas A&amp;M has lost a Southwest Conference game, 
the Cotton Bowl is probably hoping for Texas (3-1), winner over Oklahoma last 
Saturday, to somehow finish the season 10-1 and travel to Dallas on New Year's 
Day. Good luck. Texas still has to play, among others, Arkansas, Houston, Texas 
A&amp;M and surprising TCU. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Brock, executive vice president of the Cotton Bowl, said he doesn't expect 
to see more than two undefeated teams -- Virginia and Nebraska -- at regular 
season's end. In fact, Brock said the eight New Year's Day bowls will include 
their share of 9-2 and 8-3 teams, so balanced is the competition. 
</P>
<P>
The Fiesta Bowl will have representatives at Virginia-Wake Forest, 
Colorado-Kansas, Georgia Tech-North Carolina, Florida State-Auburn, 
Tennessee-Alabama, Oklahoma State-Nebraska, Penn State-Boston College and Notre 
Dame-Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Notice how the Fiesta's list doesn't include any Pacific 10 or Big Ten teams? 
Ever since the Rose Bowl switched networks, from NBC to ABC, and found itself 
in the same time slot as the Fiesta, the younger bowl has been off limits to 
the Pac-10 and the Big Ten. Until now. 
</P>
<P>
"Our theory is simply that the Rose Bowl is a tremendous property, has great 
management, great tradition, great teams," said John Junker, Fiesta Bowl 
executive director. "Because we happen to be in the same time period has 
nothing to do with the Rose Bowl's viability." 
</P>
<P>
Junker said unofficial discussions have taken place between the Fiesta and the 
Big Ten and the Pac-10. He added that there is "an outside chance" a team from 
one of those conferences would ignore the ban and accept a Fiesta invitation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just kind of hoping that the marketplace will determine that," Junker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wahoo-mania is spreading. Rich Murray, sports information director for No. 
1-ranked Virginia, expects to receive more than 100 media requests for the Nov. 
3 game against Georgia Tech. Unfortunately, the Scott Stadium press box can 
seat only 75 reporters. Even with alterations, Murray said the overflow media 
crowd might be switched to an end zone facility or, if all else fails, watch 
the game on big-screen television. Auxiliary seating in the stands is out of 
the question -- the game is a sellout. 
</P>
<P>
If Cal State Long Beach beats Fresno State Saturday, George Allen will get our 
vote for coach of the year -- that is, if we had a vote. . . . Most impressive 
statistic about San Diego State quarterback Dan McGwire: 240 attempts, 134 
completions, 1,921 yards, 17 touchdowns and two interceptions. His streak of 
178 consecutive passes without an interception was broken on the last play of 
the UCLA game. . . . Kansas has played No. 1 Virginia and No. 2 Miami, and will 
play No. 4 Nebraska on Nov. 10. So far, Kansas Coach Glen Mason rates Miami the 
best team the Jayhawks have faced. . . . Has anyone noticed that Louisville is 
quietly putting together a bowl-worthy season. Coach Howard Schnellenberger's 
Cardinals are 5-1-1. The real test will come Saturday when they travel to 
Pittsburgh. . . . Kentucky hasn't won more than six games in 11 of the last 12 
years. It doesn't look as if the Wildcats will break the streak this season, 
either. New Coach Bill Curry is 2-4, with LSU, Georgia, Vanderbilt, Florida and 
Tennessee remaining. Kentucky might be favored against Vandy. 
</P>
<P>
Our top 10: (1) Virginia, (2) Miami, (3) Tennessee, (4) Auburn, (5) Nebraska, 
(6) Notre Dame, (7) Washington, (8) USC, (9) Houston, (10) BYU. 
</P>
<P>
Our waiting list: Georgia Tech, Michigan, Florida State, Illinois and 
Mississippi.

ARIZONA'S MALAUULU IN HOSPITAL BRIEFLY

<TEXT>
<P>
Arizona quarterback George Malauulu was hospitalized for several hours Tuesday, 
only days after Billy Johnson, a running back, was on life support at a local 
hospital, Coach Dick Tomey said. 
</P>
<P>
Malauulu, a sophomore from Carson, collapsed in the dressing room after 
practice and was taken to the University of Arizona Medical Center, where his 
condition was diagnosed as dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
He was released. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a redshirt freshman from San Jose, collapsed Friday before the 
Wildcats left for a road trip to Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
He was hospitalized through the weekend for treatment of a case diagnosed as 
bronchitis. 
</P>
<P>
Tomey said Johnson's condition has improved but added that the back probably 
will miss the team's next five games. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona is 4-2 coming off a 35-21 loss to Oregon State last Saturday.

Larry Kelm, who resumed practicing last week after being out all season because 
of a knee injury, is expected to be activated off the injured-reserve list in 
the next few days and probably will start at inside linebacker Sunday against 
the Atlanta Falcons at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have cleared a roster spot by placing inside linebacker Fred 
Strickland, who broke a bone in his left leg Sunday night, on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
They are waiting to make sure Kelm doesn't aggravate the injury during workouts 
before activating him. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta quarterback Chris Miller, who left last Sunday's 45-35 loss to the San 
Francisco 49ers with a sprained right knee, was listed as questionable for 
Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect him to play, and that's no guarantee that he will," Falcon Coach 
Jerry Glanville said Wednesday. "He's got to get better than what he is today, 
but we're going to try to crank it up." 
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday afternoon, 9,500 tickets remained unsold for Sunday's game. If 
there is not a sellout by 1 p.m. today, it will be blacked out locally. TIM

Eric Dickerson was activated by the Indianapolis Colts for Sunday's game in 
Denver against the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson, who has missed the first five games of the season on the club's 
non-football injured list, is expected to start. 
</P>
<P>
He needs only 11 yards in that game to move past O.J. Simpson into sixth place 
on the NFL all-time rushing list. 
</P>

The Colts also signed veteran quarterback Joe Ferguson to a one-year contract.

Running back Greg Bell said he's not worried about Bo Jackson's arrival, even 
if it does figure to cut into his playing time. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason, people forget that I piled up a lot of yards over the last 
two years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"So why would I be concerned with that?" 
</P>
<P>
Bell is out with a right ankle sprain suffered in Sunday's 24-17 victory over 
the Seattle Seahawks. He is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against the 
San Diego Chargers. Raider Coach Art Shell said Bell may be placed on injured 
reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Howie Long and offensive tackle Bruce Wilkerson returned to 
practice. Long was on injured reserve since Week 2 with a broken right foot. 
Wilkerson has been out all season with a knee injury. Shell said he will wait a 
few days before making a decision whether Long will play against San Diego.

THE BOTTOM TEN: ARIZONA IS PRIDE OF THE SOUTHWEST;

The Land of the 'Zonies is experiencing a victory drought. Arizona State has 
dropped three in a row. Even Missouri and Cal have kicked desert sand into the 
Sun Devils' faces. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona suffered the embarrassment of ending Oregon State's nine-game losing 
streak. The Mildcats, who were 21-point favorites, won Comedown of the Week 
Honors by falling to the Bruisin' Beavers by 14, a 35-point turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the Phoenix Cardinals, who snapped their own losing string only 
because they had the good fortune to come up against the sad-sack Dallas 
Cowboys and Coach Jimmy (Now, Which Quarterback Was That I Traded?) Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the Southwest, Texas Tech (2-4) dropped out of the Bottom Ten with 
a 49-44 upset victory over Arkansas, but Tech Coach Spike Dykes admitted that 
money he pocketed may have played a part. Dykes said he was blessed with good 
fortune because he found a penny on the goal line. The NCAA is reserving 
comment.

THE PROS 
</P>
<P>
Enough negative talk about the Rams (1-4). Here are 10 reasons why Ram Coach 
John Robinson can smile: 
</P>
<P>
1. He doesn't have to run 47 Gap himself, as Eric Dickerson once pointed out; 
2. Dieter Brock isn't his quarterback; 3. No one's blaming him for the latest 
disastrous team draft; 
</P>
<P>
4. His team is very profitable, which is all his owner cares about; 5. The 
Raiders are diverting attention from the Rams; 6. "The John Robinson Show" 
isn't up against "The Simpsons"; 
</P>
<P>
7. His defense's ranking can't sink any lower than 28th; 8. He gets to play 
Dallas in five weeks; 9. He won't have to meet the 49ers in the playoffs; 10. 
The Rams are undefeated in Germany this year.

BAY MEADOWS JOCKEY HAD PAST WEIGHT TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ricky Frazier, the jockey whose incorrect postrace weight resulted in the 
disqualification of a horse finishing first in a $250,000 race last Sunday at 
Bay Meadows, has been fined by stewards on two previous occasions in the last 
13 months for violations related to weight. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1989, the stewards at Bay Meadows fined Frazier $100 because of 
two weight problems. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Novelli, clerk of scales at the track in San Mateo, Calif., reported to the 
stewards that Frazier attempted to be weighed before a race without holding all 
of the required riding equipment while on the scale. 
</P>
<P>
Later the same day, Frazier was weighed before another race and was more than 
two pounds over the weight assigned his horse. The trainer of the horse, who is 
entitled to change jockeys if a rider is more than two pounds over, did not 
consent to Frazier riding his horse. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview with Frazier, the stewards pointed out that he could have 
made the weight by using a smaller saddle. The weight a horse carries in a race 
consists of the jockey's weight, the weight of the equipment -- about four or 
five pounds -- and lead weights that can be added if the combined weight of the 
jockey and the equipment is less than the assigned weight. Weights for horses 
are either arbitrarily assigned by the racing secretary, in the case of a 
handicap, or by the conditions of a race, which can be related to past 
performances and the age and sex of the horses. 
</P>
<P>
In fining Frazier, the stewards warned him about future weight violations, and 
last May they fined him another $100 "for not doing (making) the reported 
weight." 
</P>
<P>
Frazier was using a larger saddle Sunday when he and Allijeba won the $250,000 
Final Fourteen Stakes by a nose over Tex's Zing. Allijeba was supposed to carry 
126 pounds, but after the race, Novelli reported that the jockey's weight was 
only 123 1/2. California rules say that after a race, a jockey and his 
equipment can't be more than one pound under what the horse was assigned. 
</P>
<P>
The stewards disqualified Allijeba from winning the $125,000 first-place purse, 
making Tex's Zing the winner, and ordered the mutuel department to refund all 
money bet on Allijeba. Robert Allensworth, the owner of Allijeba, has appealed 
the stewards' decision to the California Horse Racing Boad. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier, 27, told Larry Robideaux Jr., Allijeba's trainer, that he uses the 
larger saddle because the lead weights can be inserted into the top, near the 
horse's withers. The standard place for the lead weights is in saddle pads on 
both sides of the horse. Some jockeys think that carrying the weight at the 
withers is better for a horse because of the center of gravity. 
</P>
<P>
Robideaux said that, according to Frazier, the jockey has room for four pounds 
of lead underneath his saddle top, and he was carrying two pounds of lead in 
the Allijeba race. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Frazier nor Novelli could be reached for comment Wednesday. Bay Meadows 
stewards said the race is still under investigation.

HOLLYWOOD PARK HIT WITH $81-MILLION LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Western Standardbred Assn. has filed suit against Hollywood Park seeking 
$81 million in damages for the race track's alleged attempt to kill harness 
racing in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, which was filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court, said that 
Hollywood Park Operating Company and Hollywood Park Realty "were engaged in a 
wrongful plan and program to curtail the competitive opportunities for harness 
racing in Southern California and eliminate harness racing in Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
The suit outlined eight major points that were said to expedite a decline in, 
if not the elimination of harness racing. Hollywood Park is alleged to have: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Forced harness racing out of Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Limited harness racing to Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Refused to operate harness racing at Los Alamitos for the full amount of 
time allocated by the California Horse Racing Board. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Refused to allow other operators to lease either of the tracks for harness 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Failed to operate meetings properly at Los Alamitos and failed to promote, 
market or advertise harness racing in a reasonable fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Allowed Los Alamitos to fall into disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Deliberately jeopardized the vitality and viability of Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Started night thoroughbred racing at Hollywood Park in direct competition 
with Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Should the suit reach trial, Max Blecher, the attorney who represented the 
Coliseum Commission and the Raiders against the National Football League, would 
argue the case. 
</P>
<P>
Irving Reifman, an attorney for Western Standardbred, said Wednesday: "One of 
the main incidents was last year when Hollywood Park took away five weeks of 
harness racing at Los Alamitos and, secretly, by contract, gave it to the 
quarter horse industry." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Forgnone, the main attorney for Hollywood Park, said he hadn't yet reviewed 
the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Reifman added: "This was filed on the 'fast track,' which means that the judge 
could hear it within 12 to 24 months from now."

CLERKS, TRACKS AGREE TO SIGN TWO-YEAR-OLD CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The union that represents all pari-mutuel clerks in California and the 
organization that represents all of the race tracks have agreed in principle to 
sign a labor contract that has been unsigned for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Both Joe Stellino, president of Service Employees International Union Local 
280, and Richard Hughes, director of industrial relations for the Federation of 
California Racing Assns., said the contract will be signed in the next few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no problems; it's finally put together," said Hughes, who added that 
there never was a problem. However, Hughes opened the latest skirmish by 
sending a letter to Stellino saying he would request all tracks "to withhold 
pension payments to the Building Service Employees Pension Trust" if the 
contract was not signed by Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Stellino responded by letter: "If this action is taken by you, SEIU Local 280 
will have no choice but to 'strike' all racing associations and satellite 
facilities throughout . . . California." 
</P>
<P>
The contract was ratified in 1988 but has not been signed because of 
disagreements over the interpretation of specific language. The contract will 
expire in two years. 
</P>
<P>
A pari-mutuel clerk receives a base pay of $112 a day on-track after health and 
welfare, pension and vacation deductions. An off-track clerk receives a base 
pay of $90. There are about 2,400 union members in California. JOHN CHERWA

RIGHT TIMING, LOCATION ADD TO PLEASURE OF SUNSET WATCHING

<P>
There's no better time than fall and winter for great sunset watching in San 
Diego County. Picture yourself on a clear, late afternoon, perched atop one of 
the ocean bluffs or inland peaks, looking west. As you sit and watch, the sun, 
a battered, distorted orb, touches a sharply delineated horizon punctuated left 
and right by the low profiles of San Clemente and Santa Catalina islands. The 
sun sinks in two minutes, perhaps leaving behind for a moment a tinge of green 
as it disappears from view. The bowl of night advances slowly behind you, 
overtaking everything but a thin, orange band in the west that lingers for a 
while, then fades to blue-gray. 
</P>
<P>
Before I mention a few of the better spots around North County to witness this 
kind of spectacle, let's discuss timing. 
</P>
<P>
Starting about this time of year, wispy cirrus clouds drift across our skies 
with increased frequency. They can warn of an approaching storm, but quite 
often at this latitude, they simply indicate a disturbance that will pass clear 
of us. Cirrus and other high-altitude clouds may obscure the setting sun 
itself, but be patient: If you wait 5 to 20 minutes, these same clouds may 
cycle through an ever-changing palette of yellows, oranges and reds. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, Southern California is well into the season of Santa Ana winds. 
Inland San Diego County may get warm, dry air from the east as much as half the 
time. Stronger Santa Ana conditions can push clear, dry air out to the 
coastline or even to the islands offshore. During the first couple of days of a 
major Santa Ana episode, surrealistically transparent air overlies the county, 
and sunsets become bright and lucid. But when a Santa Ana decays (usually by 
the third or fourth day) L.A.-area smog can sneak down the coast and lie 
heavily along North County's coast for a while. The fiery-red setting sun then 
recalls apocalyptic visions of Hades. 
</P>
<P>
Optimum sunset-watching conditions sometimes occur after fast-moving Pacific 
storms pass. (This is most common December through February.) Cold, dry north 
winds often blow in the wake of these storms, sweeping all trace of polluted 
air from Southland skies. This is the best time to spot the prismatic effect 
called the "green flash." It appears to the naked eye as an emerald-green spot 
that lingers on the horizon during the last moment of the sun's demise. Clouds 
or haze can mask the phenomenon completely. 
</P>
<P>
With the resumption of Pacific Standard Time on Sunday, Oct. 28, sunsets will 
be occurring much earlier -- before 5 p.m. for most of November and December. 
That means there's lots of time to enjoy the whole sunset/twilight show well 
before your evening meal. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the best places for sunset-watching may be as close as the local beach 
or coastal bluffs. The bluffs at Encinitas and Leucadia are ideal. Several 
stairways and ramps lead from Neptune Avenue in Leucadia down to the narrow 
strip of sand below. The trails of Torrey Pines State Reserve are closed after 
sunset, but there's always access to the beach there and also at Del Mar. Low 
tides are best for strolling North County's beaches, which aren't known for 
their great width. Early next month, the tide level reaches an extraordinarily 
low level of -1.5 feet two days in a row -- Saturday, Nov. 3, at 3:40 p.m. and 
Sunday, Nov. 4, at 4:32 p.m. These times are perfect for a pre- or post-sunset 
beach walk. 
</P>
<P>
If you live inland, there's probably some high ridge or peak near you, perhaps 
with an ocean view, that is accessible by car or foot. Here are three North 
County peaks offering superb sunset and twilight panoramas: 
</P>
<P>
Black Mountain (elev. 1,552 feet) in Mira Mesa, part of which is a San Diego 
open-space park. It can be climbed by way of dirt roads or firebreaks on the 
north and south slopes. You can start from either Paseo Valdear on the south, 
or the dirt portion of Black Mountain Road north of the peak. All routes to the 
top are quite steep, rugged and difficult to follow, so you should become 
familiar with them before attempting any descent in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
Woodson Mountain (elev. 2,894 feet) outside Ramona. It can be climbed via a 
steep paved road (closed to autos) from California 67. Park on the spur road 
opposite the fire station three miles north of Poway Road. Walk past the 
station, then pick up the road going to the summit. It's an hour's hard climb 
to the top. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher Hill (elev. 5,438 feet) in Palomar Mountain State Park is a bit remote, 
but its commanding height overlooks the coastline from Orange County to Baja 
California, and half of San Diego County to boot. You can either hike to it 
from the entrance to the park or drive all the way. 
</P>
<P>
Don't forget to bring a jacket and flashlight if you'll be hiking after dark. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Saturday, Nov. 3, on your calendar. From any vantage point offering a 
clear view of the eastern horizon, you should be able to see (weather 
permitting) a big full moon, orange as a pumpkin, rising a few minutes after 
sunset.

NEIGHBORS SEEK END TO OVERCROWDING IN HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of some Thousand Oaks neighborhoods where homes are used as 
boardinghouses are drafting an ordinance aimed at banning overcrowding in 
single-family neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Residents such as Shannon Young call the houses that contain six or more 
tenants suburban "nightmares" that neighbors have tried to eradicate for nearly 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
Young, who lives on Calle Tulipan, complains of five homes in her neighborhood 
that are occupied by up to 20 people each, some living in campers and using 
back yards as bathrooms. But the overcrowded homes are spread throughout the 
city, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens on the 10-member committee will begin meeting next Tuesday in an 
effort to stiffen city code enforcement after the City Council last month was 
unable to enact a measure that would prevent single-family houses from being 
rented out to large numbers of people. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel like we're in the middle of this nightmare," said Young, 31, a mother 
of four. "We hope to come up with an ordinance that has enough teeth and bite 
to be able to close down some of these houses." 
</P>
<P>
Young was among a group of about 30 people who have asked the City Council to 
crack down on landlords and homeowners who allow houses to be used as hotels 
and boardinghouses. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors cite trash-filled yards, lack of parking and loud music as some of 
the main problems. 
</P>
<P>
"You feel like you're under siege," Young said. "My son ran into our house 
hysterically last week, because there was a group of men standing near our 
mailbox. He felt threatened." 
</P>
<P>
Since neighbors began complaining a month ago, some tenants of overcrowded 
homes have tried to clean up yards and hide campers that have been used as 
living quarters, said Ron Keesling, 42, a neighbor on Calle Tulipan. 
</P>
<P>
"They know people are upset at the way things have been going," Keesling said. 
</P>
<P>
Keesling said he has seen a house two doors down deteriorate steadily in the 
past four years. Other occupants have added rooms illegally, converted living 
rooms into bedrooms and used garages as bedrooms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Lawrence Horner, who helped draft the failed ordinance, said it was 
an attempt to resolve complaints by homeowners, real estate agents and 
landlords about lack of enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, neighbors took issue with the proposed ordinance, which tried to 
tackle overcrowding problems by limiting occupancy in a residence to six 
adults. But it did not limit the number of children. 
</P>
<P>
"With six adults, each adult could have two or three kids," Horner said. "That 
numbers game isn't going to be acceptable in the eyes of a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Mark G. Sellers has said the current ordinance is unconstitutional, 
because it limits occupancy to families and groups of no more than five people. 
The legal definition of families is unclear, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Horner, explaining opposition to the ordinance, said some homeowners protested 
attempts by local governments to regulate the use of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Some landlords rent out rooms to make mortgage payments, said Jerry Krantz, 
president of the Conejo Valley Board of Realtors. Krantz, who has also been 
appointed to the committee, predicted disagreement within the committee over an 
alternative to the city's draft. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be hard for those 10 people to agree on what constitutes a 
single-family residence -- how many unrelated people are going to be permitted 
to live in a home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Krantz acknowledged that some landlords flout the law, and neighbors have been 
unable to force the city to evict them. 
</P>
<P>
However, tenants of one allegedly overcrowded home on Calle Tulipan said it has 
been difficult finding housing they can afford. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Gonzalez lives in a house in the 600 block of Calle Tulipan with nine 
other tenants, including two children. Each adult pays about $100 a month to 
live there, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"What can I do?" said Gonzalez, 28. "I have nowhere to go." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Nazario, an ombudsman for the homeless with county Public Social 
Services, said there are about 3,000 homeless in the county, but about five 
times that many live in overcrowded conditions, because they are not able to 
find affordable housing in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"Places like Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks have been built as suburban, 
commuter communities, so there aren't a lot of older sections of town with 
small units in them. So people will tend to crowd up in houses," Nazario said. 
"Overcrowding is one of the only options poor people have."

D.A. LOOKS AT REPORT NAVY DUMPS WASTE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The district attorney's office said Wednesday it will investigate allegations 
that the Navy has illegally dumped toxic and radioactive waste from its base in 
Port Hueneme at an Oxnard landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations were raised in a letter sent last week to Sheriff John 
Gillespie by John Cobian, a professional court interpreter who is running for 
mayor in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
In the Oct. 11 letter, Cobian said he was told by Navy employees that yellow 
dump trucks from the base had taken radioactive soil from an Antarctica 
experiment to the Bailard Landfill on Gonzales Road. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my understanding that the placing of hazardous waste where it may 
eventually contaminate the underground water supply is a crime and comes under 
the jurisdiction of the Sheriff's Department," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, the Navy denied Cobian's allegations, saying it only 
transports "non-hazardous solid waste, such as cardboard, wood, plastic, empty 
food containers . . ." to the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
However, the statement said crushed rock from a reactor site in Antarctica had 
been used to pave an equipment storage area on the base. The rock contains 
"extremely low levels of radioactivity," according to the statement. 
</P>
<P>
A sheriff's spokesman said Cobian's allegations were turned over to the 
district attorney's office because the Sheriff's Department lacks the technical 
expertise to investigate such allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Greg Brose, a supervisor for the county Consumer and 
Environment Protection Division, said he will lead an investigation to 
determine if the allegations are accurate. HUGO MARTIN

2 PLEAD GUILTY TO 3 BANK ROBBERIES

<TEXT>
<P>
Two jobless Ventura men have pleaded guilty to federal bank-robbery charges in 
connection with three recent Ventura County bank heists, an FBI official said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Poynter, 31, and Julian Delgado, 29, entered guilty pleas Monday before 
U.S. District Judge James M. Ideman for their respective roles in robberies 
committed between July 26 and Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Poynter was indicted last month on charges of robbing seven banks in Ventura 
and Santa Barbara counties. Under a plea agreement with the U.S. attorney's 
office, he admitted robbing three of the banks in exchange for charges being 
dropped in the four other cases, said Gary Auer, head of the FBI's Ventura 
office. Delgado, his roommate, pleaded guilty to a single count. 
</P>
<P>
The two men were captured Aug. 22 after robbing a Santa Barbara Savings and 
Loan branch in Ventura. The FBI and Ventura police tailed the pair to the bank 
after staking out their Anacapa Street residence for four days. CHRISTOPHER

MAN, 27, CHARGED IN JULY SLAYING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 27-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of strangling a 62-year-old man 
during a July robbery, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Eugene Diaz, who lived in Oxnard when the slaying occurred, was being 
held in the Ventura County Jail on $515,000 bail on suspicion of murder and 
several probation violations, a jail spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Port Hueneme police, who have been pursuing Diaz for months, arrested Diaz 
Monday evening in San Pablo in Contra Costa County, where he was staying with 
his father, said Sgt. Dennis Fitzgerald of the Port Hueneme Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Diaz beat and strangled Bruce Eugene Pope, a self-employed 
free-lance business consultant, on July 3. 
</P>
<P>
Pope, who had no close relatives, was taking care of two condominiums owned by 
doctors in a guarded complex in the 900 block of Lighthouse Way in Port 
Hueneme, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
A renter who lived with Pope returned home about midnight and found that the 
condominium had been ransacked, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
A television, videocassette recorder, computer, camera and cash were missing. 
The man then went to summon security guards, and after their arrival at the 
residence the body was found, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
Pope was severely beaten with household objects and then strangled, Fitzgerald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that Pope and Diaz met each other by chance, and that Diaz was 
invited to Pope's condominium, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz apparently decided to rob Pope and a struggle ensued, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the initial motive was to kill," Fitzgerald said. "I just think 
he was going to rob the guy, and it got out of hand and he killed him." 
</P>
<P>
In August, police received a tip that helped officers identify Diaz and link 
him to evidence at the scene. The search took police to Arkansas and then to 
the Bay Area. CAROL WATSON

<P>
WATER-RATIONING PLAN IS ADOPTED

<P>
The Thousand Oaks City Council has unanimously adopted an emergency 
water-rationing plan that would force residents and businesses to cut back by 
up to 20% in the event of a continued drought. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would only be instituted if the Metropolitan Water District, which 
provides state water in the eastern part of Ventura County, decides that 
drought conditions warrant rationing, said Don Nelson, city utilities director. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say they expect 70% to 80% of the 12,800 customers in the city to 
comply with the rationing order. The city has recorded a 600-million gallon 
drop in projected water consumption since voluntary water rationing was imposed 
in May, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks' plan calls for rationing to be imposed in three phases. The 
first phase would be imposed if there is a 10% shortage in the state's water 
supplies. Residents would be warned to cut back on watering lawns and washing 
cars or face civil and criminal penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Shortages of 10% to 20% would involve more serious measures. Customers would 
have to reduce consumption by 10% or face penalties on their water bills. 
Penalties are calculated at $2 for every unit, or about 750 gallons, of water 
used. 
</P>
<P>
A family that used 25 units of water each month would have to cut back by 2.5 
units, or see a $5 penalty in its water bill. 
</P>
<P>
If the city's water shortage exceeds 20%, customers would have to cut back by 
20%. Excessive users could be forced to install flow-restricting devices on 
their faucets or face having their water shut off. PSYCHE PASCUAL

<P>
A used-oil recycling program in Thousand Oaks that has collected more than 
10,000 gallons in nine months will be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
Grahame Watts, the city's recycling coordinator, said the program, which since 
February has collected residual auto fluids free of charge on the third 
Saturday of each month, now will also accept the fluids on the first Thursday 
of each month. 
</P>
<P>
The program allows residents to bring used transmission, crankcase, gearbox and 
differential oil to the city's Municipal Service Center at 1851 De Havilland 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The next scheduled collection dates are Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and Nov. 
1 from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.

THE DROUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
14% OF WATER USERS EXCEED LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 14% of Ventura's 25,926 water customers violated the city's mandatory 
conservation ordinance in the bimonthly billing period that ended in August, 
according to city statistics released Wednesday. It was the first billing 
period since the penalty phase of the ordinance went into effect in June. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 3,587 water violators, 2,868 were residential customers and 707 were 
commercial customers. Also violating the ordinance were 11 churches and one 
school. 
</P>
<P>
City spokeswoman Carol Green said officials were pleased with the city's 86% 
compliance rate. "The City Council congratulates Venturans on their response 
and thanks them for their continued efforts," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Green said she was especially pleased because almost half of the violators had 
exceeded their allocations by less than 1,000 cubic feet. One thousand cubic 
feet equals 7,480 gallons. "This indicates a serious conservation effort on the 
part of Venturans," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the city ordinance, single-family houses are allowed 294 gallons a day 
and multifamily dwellings 196 gallons a day. Businesses must cut back water use 
by 15% compared with last year, and institutional customers, such as schools, 
churches and government offices, must reduce their use by 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Violators are charged four times the normal water rate for every gallon they 
use above their allocation, and up to 10 times the rate if they violate the 
ordinance on three bills in a row. 
</P>
<P>
But the ordinance stipulates that the penalty money be reimbursed if, after 12 
months, the violators have saved enough water to make up for their temporary 
excess use. 
</P>
<P>
Customers may receive extra allocations if they can prove that using less water 
would cause them undue hardships. 
</P>
<P>
Green said businesses and multifamily customers such as mobile home parks and 
apartment buildings have had the most trouble staying within their allocations, 
because the responsibility for wasting water is shared among several people. 
</P>
<P>
"I think large organizations run by groups have more trouble getting a handle 
on the situation than, say, single homes, where individuals make the decisions 
by themselves." 
</P>
<P>
A list of the 80 worst commercial violators released by the city included 
almost every type of business in town. There were motels such as Motel 6, the 
Toys R Us store, a Shell Oil gas station on Victoria Avenue, the 101 Theater 
Corp. and a Vons supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
Some merchants said it was impossible for them to reduce water use to the 
extent required by the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We run 20 trucks that we have to wash and I don't know how we're going to cut 
water use any further," said Frankie Ortiz of Ortiz Bros. Trucking, whose 
company was fined about $300. "We have to wash the inside of the trailers." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what we can do to cut down water use any further and still meet 
health and safety requirements," said Kevin Dillenburg, night manager at 
Carrow's Restaurant, which was also heavily fined. "Somehow, we have to get the 
cleaning done." 
</P>
<P>
Other businessmen, such as Harlan Fugate at Ventura Kawasaki, said the excess 
water use was caused by plumbing problems that have now been corrected. "If 
we're not OK this month, I'll kill somebody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the residents, some of the biggest violators were large property owners 
who refused to let their gardens die to stay within their allocations. 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Martin of Telegraph Road was told to cut back her average water use of 
2,000 gallons a day on her 1 1/2-acre estate by 80%. Since she cut back only to 
1,100 gallons a day, she received an $800 water bill. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been working on my garden for 10 years," said Martin, 56. "I have 
azaleas, roses and a Japanese tea tree valued at $30,000. I can't just let my 
garden die, because I'm too old to start a new one." 
</P>
<P>
Other residents were at a loss to explain why they were being penalized. "I 
didn't use that much water," protested 88-year-old Wilma Buckmaster of Lupine 
Way, whose water bill increased from $30 to $400. She said she has 20 fruit 
trees on her property but that she has stopped watering them since she received 
her bill. "I don't know what happened," she added.

WHITTIER TO BUY 5 'TROLLEYS' TO LURE BUS RIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday night to add style and cost to its 
transit system by purchasing five buses built to resemble old-time streetcars. 
</P>
<P>
The difference in cost between ordinary city buses and trolley-style coaches is 
about $30,000 per vehicle. In addition, the city will pay about $60,000 more in 
yearly maintenance, said Linda Creed, transit manager. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials say the specialty buses are worth it because they will 
increase ridership and provide a marketing tool for Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
The trolleys will replace van buses that have been provided by a private 
transit contractor. Whittier's two routes will remain unchanged as well as its 
hours of service: from 6:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. weekdays and 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. on 
Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
Council members had long been leaning toward buying the custom buses, which are 
called trolleys in the cities where they are used. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 8, representatives of Chance Coach Inc., based in Kansas, and Specialty 
Vehicle Manufacturing Corp., a Downey firm, had paraded their specialty buses 
before council members and interested residents. 
</P>
<P>
The Chance diesel was the better looker, most agreed, from its more ornate 
handrails and decorative sunshade to its brass and Philippine mahogany 
interior. The Chance also offered better visibility to riders. 
</P>
<P>
"That one looks like a real trolley," said Katie Rahder, 10, who came along for 
the ride with her mother, Councilwoman Helen McKenna-Rahder. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chance did not compare so well in terms of leg room and capacity. 
</P>
<P>
"How can two people sit in this seat?" asked Councilman Bob Henderson, during 
the tour of the Chance. 
</P>
<P>
"They can," a sales representative assured him. "They do it all the time." 
Indeed, Chance has sold 157 of the trolleys in 27 states, and customers must 
currently wait a year to receive their product. Bell Gardens, Bellflower and 
Chula Vista all have bought the Chance trolleys. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, however, Specialty Vehicle Manufacturing Corp. got the nod from 
Whittier on the basis of comfort and practicality. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chance is a more authentic-looking trolley, but the seating is more 
cumbersome," McKenna-Rahder had said during the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
The red and green Specialty diesel, although it looks less like a San Francisco 
cable car, is hardly a stepchild in appearance, with its brass and oak interior 
and contoured wooden benches. 
</P>
<P>
Neither vehicle will return Whittier to the streetcar era, which ended with the 
scrapping of the local Red Car line years ago. Whittier's new vehicles, with 
the bells and whistles removed, are buses. 
</P>
<P>
"The only difference is the thrill of driving something that looks like this 
and how people see you when you come down the road," said Robert Blanding, a 
bus-driver trainer whom Chance had asked to drive the simulated streetcar 
around the block for council members. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, officials in Whittier and other cities have decided that it is not 
just where you go, but how you get there. 
</P>
<P>
Lynwood will have a ribbon cutting later this month to usher a third trolley 
into its local transit service, which is free. Lynwood's vehicles are from 
other manufacturers. It is hard to imagine such red-carpet treatment for an 
ordinary bus, but as for trolley buses, "They are charming," said Lorry Torres, 
the city's administrative analyst. 
</P>
<P>
"It brings up the image of the city," said Billy Roberts, transportation 
supervisor for Bell Gardens. His city purchased two trolleys for its local 
fixed-route transit service, which began in August. "It's something about which 
the community can say, 'Look at what the city is doing.' " 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said ridership is running at about 40 persons an hour so far. 
Passengers, who pay a fare of 10 cents, include children going to and from 
school, senior citizens running errands, shoppers and even some local 
commuters. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a high population density," Roberts said. "That contributes a lot to 
our ridership. And most people are from a one-car family." 
</P>
<P>
Bell Gardens started its trolley service in part to ease the load on its 
pre-existing dial-a-ride system. Now, many people who had called for rides are 
taking the trolleys. 
</P>
<P>
But the trolley has attracted other riders as well, Roberts said. He called it 
"a new market share." 
</P>
<P>
"People who won't ride public transit for some reason will ride a trolley," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
That phenomenon justifies the trolley buses in Bellflower as well, said Mike 
Egan, assistant to the city administrator. "We need to get people off the 
roads," he said. The trolley puts us in a good position for advertising our 
service. It's a good recognition symbol." 
</P>
<P>
As for Whittier, city officials plan to do more with their trolley buses than 
market their 25-cents-a-ride transportation service. City leaders hope trolley 
buses will promote the city itself, particularly the downtown business 
district, which is called Uptown. 
</P>
<P>
The city center is still trying to recoup customers lost after the October, 
1987, Whittier earthquake, which destroyed 34 buildings, about half of the 
business district, and severly damaged 23 others. In voicing his support for 
trolleys, Mayor Thomas K. Sawyer stressed the importance both of bringing 
nearby residents downtown to shop and making the transportation itself 
something to remember. 
</P>
<P>
For that mission, the trolley bus is ideal, said Nancy Munoz, sales manager for 
Specialty Vehicle Manufacturing Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"In some cities back East, the attraction is absolutely the historical 
nostalgia," she said. "Most cities did have streetcars. (But) Some cities buy 
them because they're cute."

same conclusion.

POLICE UPSET AT DECISION ON NOISY PARTY;

SOUTH PASADENA: PROSECUTORS DECLINE TO CHARGE FOUR MEN, INCLUDING CITY 
MANAGER'S SON, OVER LATE-NIGHT BASH.

<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors have decided not to file charges in connection with a noisy 
drinking party that ended in the arrests of four young men, including the city 
manager's son, but the hangover from last month's bash throbs on. 
</P>
<P>
Although the late-night gathering of 30 to 40 young adults might have annoyed 
some residents of this small, well-to-do community, there was insufficient 
evidence to charge the suspects with disturbing the peace, head Deputy Dist. 
Atty. David R. Disco said this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Our focus is whether the conduct at that party was criminal . . . and in my 
judgment, we could not establish that in this case," Disco said. "We can't be 
the arbiters of what makes good neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
The South Pasadena Police Officers Assn., already upset that a private 
investigator has been hired by the City Council to look into allegations of 
police misconduct at the party, reacted angrily to the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a case of a bunch of spoiled brats with some connections who wanted 
to continue their party when the officers asked them not to," said Sylvia E. 
Kellison, the police association's attorney. "Unfortunately, I guess this means 
there's a different standard of justice for children of politicians than for 
the average citizen's kids." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the officers' anger spilled over into the 42nd State Assembly 
District race, in which South Pasadena Mayor Evelyn Fierro is challenging 
incumbent Richard Mountjoy. 
</P>
<P>
By hiring an outside investigator to probe police handling of the incident, 
Fierro "has become a symbol of defiance . . . for the youth of the community 
and, inadvertently, has become a champion of teen-age drinking rights," the 
association charged, throwing its endorsement to Mountjoy. 
</P>
<P>
Fierro fired back Tuesday, calling the officers' reaction "typical of 
police-state tactics." 
</P>
<P>
"I will not be threatened to ignore alleged violations of any citizen's civil 
and constitutional rights," she said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
None of the four South Pasadena men arrested Sept. 14 in the 1100 block of 
Stratford Avenue was available for comment on the district attorney's decision. 
They are John Bernardi Jr., 22, son of the city manager; Bryan Lee Prentiss, 
22, son of the former mayor; Thomas D. Ramos, 20, son of the former Chamber of 
Commerce president; and Scott D. Josephson, 21. 
</P>
<P>
All have been cleared in the incident except for Prentiss, who faces one count 
of destroying public property for allegedly kicking a telephone off the wall 
while being held in South Pasadena jail and stomping it into little pieces. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to dial 411," Prentiss explained to officers, according to a 
copy of the police report obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately after the party, Bernardi's son filed a citizen's complaint 
of police officers' excessive force; the City Council hired the $50-an-hour 
investigator; the police charged political meddling, and Police Chief William 
Reese announced his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, there were so many rumors, leaks and accusations that the South 
Pasadena Review declared in an Oct. 10 editorial: "Back in the days of World 
War II, there was a Navy poster of a sailor whispering, 'Loose Talk Sinks 
Ships.' . . . Today we need a poster that says, 'Loose Talk Can Sink Cities.' " 
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday evening, the talk was expected to continue. The police 
association was slated to appear before the City Council with complaints that 
nearly $20,000 in city time and money has been spent on what officers say is a 
senseless investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Although a final report has not yet been completed, the police association 
attorney contended that the nine officers interrogated in the course of the 
investigation have been cleared of any wrongdoing and that allegations by 
Bernardi's son of police misconduct have all been refuted. 
</P>
<P>
"In the five years that I've been an attorney for police officers, I have never 
seen such an insignificant incident generate so many hours of interrogation," 
said Kellison, who represents more than 100 police associations in Southern 
California. "There's been officer-involved shooting investigations that have 
taken less time than this." 
</P>
<P>
Officers were first called to the Ramos family's wood-and-stone home about 
10:15 p.m. by a retired couple living next-door, but a patrolman cruising by 
the house did not hear any disturbance and continued on his rounds, according 
to the 10-page police report. 
</P>
<P>
The couple called police again at 11:25 p.m., complaining of loud music and 
shouting coming from the party. This time, officers entered through a rear 
patio, where they found several dozen young adults, and many containers of beer 
and wine scattered about, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers say they asked Ramos to reduce the noise, but maintain that he ignored 
them and that the party continued unabated. 
</P>
<P>
"Ramos and Bernardi both challenged the right of the officers to be there and 
said the police had no authority to restrict their speech or freedom," the 
report said. "Bernardi threatened to call his father if we did not leave the 
premises. Despite further warnings that he would be arrested, Ramos went back 
into the house to continue the party." 
</P>
<P>
Officers followed Ramos into the kitchen and arrested him, sparking an outburst 
by other party-goers, who allegedly surrounded the officers and shouted that 
the police had no right to arrest their friend. 
</P>
<P>
The other three suspects were arrested after they allegedly ignored continued 
warnings from the police to leave the party and go home, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Disco, the head deputy district attorney, said no charges were filed primarily 
because "loud and unreasonable noise" is defined under state law as noise that 
incites violence or creates a clear and present danger, not merely a racket 
that keeps neighbors up at night. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean to endorse the specific party or gathering," he said, "but based 
upon the facts, we can't establish that the noise was such that it would create 
a clear and present danger."

City officials said they filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the state to stop a 
parole office from opening near the Civic Center in March. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court against two state agencies, 
the Corrections Department and the General Services Department, alleges the 
state arbitrarily and capriciously agreed to accept relocation money from the 
cities of Alhambra and Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
Both cities, which pledged $100,000 apiece, objected to a Garvey Avenue parole 
office that straddled the Alhambra-Monterey Park border. Another parole office 
is on Main Street in Alhambra, and state officials said 20% of the parolees 
served by the two offices live in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also claims that the state violated its own procedures by choosing 
to lease the Pasadena location at 333 E. Walnut St., a site previously judged 
unacceptable by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the suit claims the state failed to prepare an environmental study as 
required by the California Environmental Quality Act. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to sue was made in closed session Tuesday by the Pasadena Board of 
Directors, which has fought for the past two years against locating a parole 
office in Pasadena. VICKI TORRES

ENVIRONMENT: THE WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD WILL ORDER INSTALLATION OF WELLS 
TO MONITOR CONTAMINATION BENEATH AUTO CENTER.

Water quality officials said this week that they plan to order Signal Hill to 
install wells to monitor the quality of water beneath the city's Auto Center 
project, following a report that oil contamination "poses a significant threat 
to ground water." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Ross, a senior engineer with the state Regional Water Quality Control 
Board, said he will order installation of the wells at the 35-acre Auto Center, 
which is being built at Cherry Avenue and Spring Street. 
</P>
<P>
Although drinking water deposits are not immediately threatened by the 
pollution, water officials have said for months that they need the wells to 
track the source and spread of gasoline, diesel fuel and more volatile 
compounds. Health officials are concerned that the pollutants -- mostly oil 
from the city's past as an oil boom town -- could eventually seep into deep 
aquifers that Signal Hill and surrounding cities pump for drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
City officials could not be reached for comment, but they have previously said 
that investigating ground water contamination would be of little value. They 
said installation of the wells would be expensive and that water officials 
already are aware that underground deposits known as the Gage Aquifer are 
heavily polluted. 
</P>
<P>
The water board had previously requested, but did not order, more information 
on contamination beneath the Auto Center, which is designed to include six 
dealerships and to produce $2 million a year in sales taxes for the tiny city. 
</P>
<P>
Ross said he expected the city to conduct such water monitoring without being 
ordered to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they have been out of touch with the standard of the industry," Ross 
said. "Given what the data is here, we would have reasonably expected a ground 
water investigation." 
</P>
<P>
The presence of deep underground contamination was confirmed by the Los Angeles 
County Department of Health Services, which last week reported finding the 
"significant" ground water threat and asked the water board to assume review of 
the cleanup of the Auto Center properties. 
</P>
<P>
A county health official asked for the further study of ground water after 
reviewing four years of reports summarizing Signal Hill's efforts to clean up 
contamination left by oil-related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The county summary showed that such volatile compounds as benzene were found up 
to 135 feet underground, at the same depth as the Gage Aquifer. 
</P>
<P>
The call to test ground water is just the latest phase in the four-year 
assessment and cleanup of contamination at the Auto Center site. 
</P>
<P>
Initial estimates for the work were less than $1 million, but costs have 
climbed to more than $6 million. Meanwhile, auto dealers have been frustrated 
by construction delays. 
</P>
<P>
M.F. Salta Co. was scheduled to move two dealerships in August from Long Beach 
to eight acres at the corner of Cherry Avenue and 28th Street in Signal Hill. 
But extensive contamination of the site has delayed the move for Salta, a key 
Auto Center tenant. 
</P>
<P>
The city is negotiating with Salta in a bid to give the dealer the land sooner 
than the current December deadline. The City Council is expected to discuss the 
matter later this month.

WORST INTERSECTIONS NAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's five most dangerous intersections have been identified in a traffic 
safety report that names the corners of Central and Myrtle avenues and Live Oak 
Avenue and Peck Road as the spots with the most collisions during the past 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
Each intersection has had 22 traffic accidents between 1987 and 1990, according 
to the study. 
</P>
<P>
The other intersections with the highest accident rates since 1987 are: Duarte 
Road and Myrtle Avenue, with 21 collisions; California and Central avenues, 
with 16, and Myrtle and Pomona avenues, with 12. 
</P>
<P>
Public Works Director Robert K. Sandwick said work will be done to improve 
safety at those and other dangerous intersections. Monrovia has only one 
intersection, Myrtle Avenue and Huntington Drive, that generates enough traffic 
to be put in the Caltrans category of congested, Sandwick said.

INCREASE IN HOME SIZES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Property owners may now build larger two-story houses, the City Council decided 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The living area permitted in a two-story house may now equal 50% of the lot 
size, or 2,500 square feet, whichever is greater. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the ratio of living area to lot size was 35%, Community Development 
Director Robert Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
In a related action Tuesday, the council moved to reduce the bulky appearance 
of apartments and condominiums by approving three changes in the Zoning Code. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, second floors will be limited to 75% of the area of first 
floors; each condo or apartment unit must have at least 500 square feet of 
landscaped area, and all units facing streets must have a front rather than 
side appearance.

ANNEXATION HEARING SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A special meeting will be held tonight at 7 at Huntington Junior High School to 
hear comments from San Marino residents regarding the growing number of county 
residents outside the city's borders seeking annexation. 
</P>
<P>
Two groups have formally applied for annexation, and city officials expect a 
third to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Thanos Trezos, president of the Sunnyslope Land Owners Assn., said last week 
that an annexation petition is circulating among residents of his area. The 
petition must be signed by at least 5% of the registered voters who live in the 
area. The association represents people who live outside the city's eastern 
border but within its school district limits. 
</P>
<P>
Trezos contends that since children in his neighborhood already attend San 
Marino schools, the city's borders should be extended to include the area. 
</P>
<P>
The other two groups, made up of residents of the San Pasquale island, an 
unincorporated county area on the city's northern border, are not within the 
school district. Spokesmen for the groups said they have petitioned for 
annexation because they want their children to attend San Marino schools.

DEVELOPER FOR DOWNTOWN

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has chosen Hopkins Development Co. of Newport Beach to try to 
develop a retail center south of Buffums department store downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, this week designated Hopkins 
as the developer for a 22-acre site north of Mission Boulevard and east of 
Garey Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, another company, CSA Real Estate Development of Anaheim, tried 
without success to secure major tenants for the same site. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said Hopkins has proposed to build housing, either single-family 
homes or townhouses, on part of the site to improve the project's financial 
feasibility. City officials said they want to keep Buffums, either at its 
current site or in a new retail center downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement gives Hopkins 90 days to secure letters of interest from 
potential tenants and to prepare a development plan.

The Compton City Council adopted a resolution by a 3-1 vote Tuesday declaring a 
vacancy for the mayoral position, which has been empty since the death of Mayor 
Walter Tucker. The resolution was passed to comply with City Charter 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Council member Bernice Woods, who voted against the adoption, said the council 
will discuss how the position will be filled at the next scheduled meeting Oct 
23. Councilman Maxcy Filer, the mayor pro tem, is temporarily presiding over 
the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The council has 30 days after declaring the seat vacant to either appoint 
someone to fill the position or schedule a special election, City Clerk Charles 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
If a special election is held, the winner will have to run again in the April 
election to complete the remaining two years of Tucker's term, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker, 66, died of cancer on Oct. 1. He had been mayor for nine years.

COUNCILMAN PAYS PART OF FINE FOR LATE STATEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huntington Park Councilman Luis Hernandez on Tuesday paid $1,260 of the $2,110 
he was fined for turning in late campaign disclosure statements for last 
April's election, a city spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, 30, was fined by City Clerk Marilyn A. Boyette, who said the 
councilman will pay off the rest of the fine in monthly installments. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez turned in his statements as many as 117 days late. The campaign 
disclosure statements are required by law to enable voters to find out who is 
supporting a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The councilman spent $29,219, more money than any other candidate, to win one 
of the three seats being contested in last April's election. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said he waited until after the election to turn in the statements 
because he wanted to protect his contributors from retaliation by city 
officials. Mayor Thomas E. Jackson has called the assertion "nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
The state Fair Political Practices Commission also is investigating Hernandez's 
campaign.

14 BUILDINGS ADDED TO LIST THAT PROTECTS HISTORIC SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday night to add 14 buildings to its 
local register of historic resources. The decision more than quadruples the 
size of the local list from four to 18 structures. 
</P>
<P>
A wide variety of buildings was selected. Among them is the Standard Oil 
Building on Penn Street, an early 1900s example of a corporate office building. 
Also included are the Philadelphia street bank building in which former 
President Richard M. Nixon once practiced law, and homes dating back to the 
1880s. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier Cultural Arts Commission and the Planning Commission winnowed down 
the final nominees from a list of more than 75 buildings. The designation 
provides the structures protection from significant alteration and demolition. 
Major architectural changes must be approved by the city. And before a 
demolition permit can be issued, there must be a 180-day waiting period. During 
that six-month moratorium, the property owner and the city are supposed to 
explore options to save the building. 
</P>
<P>
Although the designation limits the property rights of an owner, it also 
entitles them to significant property-tax savings under state law, said Elvin 
Porter, the city's planning director.

For 17-year-old Cara Payton Rullman, trying out for the Tournament of Roses 
Royal Court was just a lark, something that she and about 35 of her San Marino 
girlfriends decided to do this year. 
</P>
<P>
For 18-year-old Dawn Christine Gray of Pasadena, the competition represents a 
third, determined try for the coveted title of Rose Queen. The Rose Court is 
the closest Gray has come yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's easier every year," she said of her previous attempts, "but 
everything that comes up now will be new." 
</P>
<P>
Despite different motives for entering the contest, both teen-agers ended up 
teary-eyed Monday after they were named to the seven-member court. More than 
700 young women competed this year at Tournament House in Pasadena in a 
three-week round of judging. The contest is open to residents of the Pasadena 
Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
The seven teen-agers compose an exotic-appearing court this year, reflecting 
the ethnic diversity of the San Gabriel Valley. Members include a young woman 
whose parents are from India, an African-American, a Japanese-American and a 
Chinese-American. 
</P>
<P>
Those named Monday were Tisha Mei-Lin Kong, 16, of San Marino, captain of the 
varsity tennis team at San Marino High School; Wendy Nicole Schnee, 17, of 
Pasadena, active on the student council at Westridge School; and Jessica Leigh 
Roegler, 17, of Altadena, principal violist in the John Muir High School 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Also named were Harini Reddy, 17, of Arcadia, a Westridge student who takes 
Indian music classes; and Andrea Sae Uyeda, 16, of Pasadena, a Polytechnic 
School student and member of Zendeko Taiko, a Japanese drum group. 
</P>
<P>
Gray, a Pasadena City College student active in the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People, and Rullman, a San Marino High School varsity 
cheering squad member, complete the court. 
</P>
<P>
One of the seven will be named the Rose Queen on Tuesday. She presides over the 
102nd Tournament of Roses Parade, Jan. 1 in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The parade, whose theme this year is "Fun 'n' Games," will be followed the same 
day by the 77th Rose Bowl game, featuring the Pacific 10 and Big Ten conference 
champions.

The return of students to Park Avenue Elementary School, 15 months after its 
petroleum-contaminated playground forced district officials to shut it down, is 
a welcome relief to more than just the students and staff of the school. 
</P>
<P>
The school's reopening this week also clears the way for school administrators 
to begin work on a new junior high school in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Park Avenue's 1,100 students had been bused to three schools, including 
Elizabeth Street Elementary, which occupies the future site of the junior high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
No sooner had Park Avenue students moved out of their temporary classrooms at 
Elizabeth Street school than Los Angeles Unified School District planners and 
their supervisors descended on the 80-year-old school to review plans to build 
a 20-acre junior high school on the site. 
</P>
<P>
School officials have been itching to begin the conversion, which will give 
Region B of the Los Angeles Unified School District a desperately needed junior 
high. Junior high students now attend three overcrowded schools in the region 
-- one in South Gate and two in Huntington Park. Officials plan to begin busing 
students from the schools to help ease overcrowding until the Elizabeth Street 
junior high is completed, said Gordon Wohlers, administrator of the district's 
priority housing program, which finds housing for students. 
</P>
<P>
The new Elizabeth Street junior high will house about 1,600 students, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our junior high schools are just bursting at the seams," Elizabeth Street 
Principal John Kershaw said. 
</P>
<P>
Kershaw said the Elizabeth Street conversion has been in the works for about 
three years. Construction had been scheduled to begin about six months ago, but 
there was no way to begin with the Park Avenue students on campus. 
</P>
<P>
The conversion will take years, he said, with students moving from one area of 
the campus to another as work progresses. Kershaw said the portable classrooms 
once occupied by the Park Avenue students will be moved so that the first phase 
of construction on the junior high can proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Kershaw said a science building will be built on the former site of the 
portable classes. Eventually the campus may include a swimming pool and a 
library that will be shared with Cudahy residents. 
</P>
<P>
Park Avenue reopened Monday after the entire playground was capped to prevent 
petroleum from rising to the surface. The project cost $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Extensive environmental testing after the school was shut down showed that the 
tarry sludge found on the playground was a complex mixture of petroleum waste 
that was not harmful to the children unless they had repeated, prolonged and 
direct contact with it. Studies also showed that no toxic fumes were being 
emitted by the substance. 
</P>
<P>
During the 15 months the school was closed, Park Avenue students were divided 
among Teresa Hughes Elementary School, Elizabeth Street school and Clara Street 
Primary Center. 
</P>
<P>
For 15 months, administration officials at Teresa Hughes and Elizabeth Street 
ran two schools in one -- with separate recesses, lunch breaks, even separate 
use of facilities for their students and Park Avenue students. 
</P>
<P>
Though the reopening of the school paves the way for the Elizabeth Street 
conversion, it has done nothing to alleviate general overcrowding in the 
region, Wohlers said. 
</P>
<P>
Wohlers said the Southeast Los Angeles County's elementary population is among 
the fastest growing in the district. Today, a third of the elementary schools 
in Bell, Cudahy, Huntington Park, Maywood and South Gate are at capacity and 
are busing students. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Street elementary students will eventually be moved to a new school 
being planned in Cudahy at the corner of Wilcox Avenue and Walnut Street, 
school Principal Kershaw said.

SPORTSCOPE: QUARTERBACKS HEAD THE CAST AS AZUSA PACIFIC FACES NO. 5 MENLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Azusa Pacific University football team will take on one of the top teams in 
NCAA Division III when it plays host to Menlo at 1:30 p.m. Saturday in Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
The Oaks, ranked No. 5 in Division III West Region last week, have a 4-1 record 
and caused problems for Azusa Pacific in the past. Menlo has a 3-1 lead in the 
series between the teams including a 40-28 victory over the Cougars last year. 
</P>
<P>
But Azusa Pacific is also out to a fast start. The Cougars, who did not play 
last week, are also 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
The game will feature two outstanding quarterbacks. Azusa has been sparked by 
the passing of Brian Hunt and Menlo by Greg Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt, a senior from Glendora High, has completed 110 of 207 passes for 1,373 
yards and nine touchdowns. He is closing in on former Cougar quarterback Greg 
Gano's single-season record of 1,918 yards passing and 2,003 yards in total 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who passed for 422 yards and three touchdowns against the Cougars last 
year, has thrown for 790 yards this season. He also has two outstanding passing 
targets in Chris Lupenui, who has 27 receptions, and Curtis Moseley, with 25. 
</P>
<P>
The Oaks have an excellent defense headed by linemen Micah Kane and Masa 
Miyashiro and linebacker Blake Fujii. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Pacific's defense has been stingy, especially against the run. The 
Cougars are ranked in the top 10 in the National Assn. of Intercollegiate 
Athletics in rushing defense, allowing an average of 83.2 yards a game. 
Overall, they are giving up an average of 236.4 yards. 
</P>
<P>
It will be a match-up of conference leaders when Pomona-Pitzer visits 
Occidental in a Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference 
football game at 7:30 p.m. Saturday in Eagle Rock. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams enter the game at 2-0 in SCIAC play. Pomona-Pitzer is 3-1 overall 
and Occidental 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona-Pitzer, off to its best start in recent years, has been paced on offense 
by junior quarterback Scott Hamburg and sophomore running back Chris Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Hamburg is the SCIAC leader in passing yardage and total offense. He has 
completed 59 of 129 passes for 916 yards and eight touchdowns and has averaged 
222.3 total offense. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is fourth in the conference in rushing with 291 yards and three 
touchdowns in 67 carries. He is also fifth in all-purpose yardage with an 
average of 111.5 yards and fourth in scoring with 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Sagehens, who have outscored their opponents 120-96, have been aided by 
punter Nate Kirtman with a conference-leading 41.6 average. He also ranks among 
the SCIAC leaders in pass interceptions with two. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental, defending conference champion, has been sparked by freshman running 
back Brian Madlangbayan with 449 yards rushing and two touchdowns in 87 
carries. The Tigers also have a freshman standout at quarterback in Derrick 
Williams, who has passed for 357 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
In another SCIAC game Saturday, Claremont-Mudd-Scripps (1-4) will visit 
Redlands (4-1) at 7:30 p.m. and La Verne (1-4) travels to Cal Lutheran (1-5) 
for a nonconference game at 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona women's soccer team, which extended its longest unbeaten 
streak of the season to four with a 1-1 tie with UC Irvine on Monday, will host 
Regis of Colorado in a nonconference game at 7:30 p.m. Saturday in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos will take a 6-6-2 record into the game. They are led by sophomore 
striker Shannon Payne, a former Muir High of Pasadena star, who entered the 
week with a team-leading 17 goals. Payne scored two goals in Pomona's 4-1 
victory over UC San Diego, an NCAA Division III power, last week.

CITIES COUNTING ON SAN FRANCISCO MAGIC TO CAST SPELL ON TRANSIT RIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD BLUME, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cities all over the country are buying buses that look like old-fashioned 
streetcars. 
</P>
<P>
Local customers include Whittier, Bellflower, Bell Gardens and Lynwood. The 
concept behind the trend is that people find simulated streetcars more 
attractive than ordinary buses, so more people will ride mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
The streetcar-style buses are generally based on the look of San Francisco's 
streetcars, which retain a turn-of-the-century appearance and technology that 
predate this century. Cities loosely refer to the customized buses based on 
this look as trolleys. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, however, what's called a trolley is something quite apart 
from a streetcar. The San Francisco trolleys resemble ordinary buses. They 
operate on rubber tires, on city streets, without tracks. Trolleys differ from 
buses only in the means of locomotion. Buses use gas or diesel engines. 
Trolleys are powered electrically through a pole attached to overhead wires. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the image being marketed is not that of the trolleys, but San 
Franciso's famed cable cars. 
</P>
<P>
Cable cars were developed in 1873, largely through the efforts of Andrew 
Hallidie, a manufacturer of wire rope, said Peter Strauss, the director of 
service planning for the San Francisco Municipal Railway. 
</P>
<P>
Cable cars are literally dragged along tracks up and down the bay city's hills 
by an ever-moving underground cable. When the driver wants the car to move, he 
uses a mechanical grip to latch onto this cable. When he wants to stop, he 
releases the moving cable and applies the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone else was running horse cars at the time" cable cars were invented, 
Strauss said. 
</P>
<P>
The city installed cable cars partly to save the lives of horses who slipped 
and fell on the steep hills. "It turned out the cable car was very cost 
effective, even in cities that didn't have hills," Strauss said. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the era of cable cars lasted but 10 years, until the electric 
streetcar was introduced. Cable cars persist only in San Francisco, where they 
remain "one of the more effective ways of going up and down steep grades," 
Strauss said. "We wouldn't run a conventional bus on one of those hills." 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco at least, the ridership theory behind using vehicles with an 
old-fashioned charm holds true. In the summer, about 50,000 customers per day 
ride the city's three cable car lines, with their 10.7 miles of tracks. A cable 
car ride costs tourists $2.50, compared with other city transport vehicles, 
which set riders back 85 cents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's called soaking the tourists," said one transit official, who asked not to 
be named. 
</P>
<P>
"Until five or six years ago, the fares were the same as everything else," 
Strauss admitted. "We were looking for revenue. It's generating revenue that 
matches what people are willing to pay." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, part of the attraction of riding cable cars is going up and down the 
steep hills and appreciating the city's world-class scenery. Other cities, 
without such ambience, hope the magic of the streetcar itself will draw people 
to their mass-transit systems. 
</P>
<P>
Cities such as Bell Gardens, with strapped city budgets, have bought trolley 
buses even though they cost about $30,000 more apiece than ordinary buses and 
cost thousands more per year to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
"The name of the game is what people will ride," Strauss said. 
</P>
<P>
One custom bus company, Downey's Specialty Vehicle Manufacturing Co., has sold 
more than 350 streetcar-style buses in the last eight years, said Nancy Munoz, 
the company's sales manager. 
</P>
<P>
Strauss is not convinced about the lasting appeal of such vehicles. "I don't 
think much of them myself," he said. "There are a lot of cities that run these 
phony, gussied-up minibuses. I don't like them. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone tried to use them everywhere, all over the place, they'd probably 
wear out their welcome pretty fast."

REFORMED D'OYLY CARTE AIMS TO DO RIGHT BY GILBERT AND SULLIVAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Chris Pasles covers music and dance for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1875, British theater impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte had dreams of 
establishing a school of English comic opera and so brought together the 
contentious librettist W. S. Gilbert and the queen's favorite composer, Arthur 
Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
They were asked to create a companion piece for Offenbach's "La Perichole," 
then playing at a theater D'Oyly Carte was managing, and their new one-act 
opera -- "Trial by Jury" -- proved a triumph. D'Oyly Carte had found his ideal 
team and worked hard over the next 20 years to keep the partnership together. 
By 1881, on the profits of the operas, Carte was able to build the Savoy 
Theatre to permanently house the company. (With profits still rising, he built 
the Savoy Hotel eight years later.) 
</P>
<P>
The duo's efforts came to epitomize comic opera, but when the copyright on the 
Gilbert and Sullivan works ran out in the 1960s, newfangled directors declared 
open season on the famous team. 
</P>
<P>
They created new productions -- some with jazzed-up scores and hyped-up jokes, 
and some even laden with the best of intentions. Suddenly, the tried and true 
productions of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company seemed tired and trite. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, after 107 years, the company devoted to G&amp;S shut its doors in 1982, 
victim of the new era. But after death came the resurrection. 
</P>
<P>
The new D'Oyly Carte, reconstituted in 1988, is marking its first engagement in 
the United States with productions of "The Mikado" today, , and "The Pirates of 
Penzance," Friday through Sunday, at the Orange County Performing Arts Center 
in Costa Mesa. The run is part of the Festival of Britain, an arts festival and 
retail promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the new company are understandably nervous. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the most important single engagement the company's had since 
it was re-formed," Michael Bishop, chairman of the new company, said while 
inspecting the center in August. Bishop is chairman of British Midland 
Airlines, which provided half the capital to re-establish the company. The 
artistic director of the company is Bramwell Tovey, previously with the 
Sadler's Wells Ballet (who did not accompany Bishop to Costa Mesa). 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite a challenge to come back to America. . . . I would say we were 
chased away last time. And there are good reasons why we shouldn't come back 
too soon." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Times Music Critic Martin Bernheimer -- writing of the company's demise 
in 1982 -- recalled its previous local tour: 
</P>
<P>
"In the summer of '76, the company already had fallen on hard times. It was, in 
fact, a thing of shreds and patches. A small, brave band of singers, generally 
more dedicated than talented, lumbered through ritualistic paces in the hostile 
confines of the Greek Theatre. The productions looked old and cheap and worn. 
Everyone -- well, almost everyone -- seemed tired. Inspiration was 
conspicuously absent." 
</P>
<P>
Bernheimer did allow, however, that "as always, there were flashes of 
excellence, even amid the artistic doldrums." 
</P>
<P>
What also tipped the scales against the old company was the refusal of the Arts 
Council of Great Britain to give it a grant, complaining that the productions 
were "tired and wooden." 
</P>
<P>
"The (old) company really got to the stage where it couldn't carry on because 
it got too mechanical," Bishop said. "Yes, it was a faithful interpreter of the 
words and the music, but the company would deliver it in a way which had become 
repetitive. It became obviously unsuitable to the pressures that had been 
building up by people who were bringing in new versions." 
</P>
<P>
He added that "superfluous gags, staging and jokes crept in over the years." 
</P>
<P>
"They had become very popular and, in fact, almost had become expectations. 
People had begun to imagine that they had been originally intended. And that's 
not the case." 
</P>
<P>
The new company, however, has trimmed those sails, cut what Bishop called "the 
institutionalized encores" and has acquired a leaner and younger look. 
</P>
<P>
"The approach of the company is a youthful approach," he said. "The average age 
of the company is now under 30. Some of the principals, of course, are older. 
But it doesn't betray any immaturity when you see the production in terms of 
the age of the people represented on stage. The actual balance is absolutely 
right. 
</P>
<P>
"The old company were permanent. They would have sung with them forever, for 
two or for 25 years. We are now a company that is re-formed every season. We've 
had people with us now for three seasons. But nonetheless they had stood down 
(re-auditioned) at the start of each season, and new people come into the 
company every year." 
</P>
<P>
The new company does not necessarily regard itself as the guardian of the 
authentic G&amp;S tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds very pompous to say that we are the 'guardians of tradition,' " 
Bishop said. "I don't really see ourselves in that way. I think you have to 
earn this accolade rather than say that this is what we are. 
</P>
<P>
"But we do hope that we will be that over a period of time. The public and the 
critics will judge whether we achieve what we set out to do." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Bishop appears to stress only half of the famous partnership. 
</P>
<P>
"What we set out to do is to be the definitive performers of the music, but not 
necessarily the drama," he said. "I don't think we are trying to throw any of 
Gilbert's intentions overboard. But we have felt . . . that we've actually been 
able to bring a considerable breath of fresh air to the way in which the 
productions have been staged. 
</P>
<P>
"But in no sense are we turning these productions into musicals," he cautioned. 
"We are only recruiting from people who have had a long term career in opera." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop describes the two productions to be seen in Costa Mesa as "strongly 
contrasting ones. They were both created in 1989." 
</P>
<P>
"The production of 'The Mikado' scenically is a very traditional production," 
he said. "Both set designer Eileen Diss and costume designer Jessica Gwynne 
decided to use a very limited palette of colors of dyes that were available 
from natural sources to the Japanese at around the time that it's fictionally 
set. And so that's a very traditional approach to 'The Mikado.' 
</P>
<P>
"The 'Pirates of Penzance' is somewhat more modern in its approach and utilizes 
some more modern production techniques, which I don't want to spoil for the 
audience. The set is not naturalistic. It's not set on a rocky promenade. It's 
a unit set that serves many purposes and is quite ingenious in its application. 
It's a set which becomes increasingly more interesting as the performance goes 
on." 
</P>
<P>
The company commissioned Keith Warner, a staff producer with the English 
National Opera, to direct "Pirates." 
</P>
<P>
Says Bishop: "I think he succeeded in getting the right blend of not moving 
away from the definitive interpretation of the score but nevertheless injecting 
into it, not quite as robust as say, Joe Papp's 'Pirates' -- that was a 
swashbuckling musical -- but he's gone a long way to actually livening up the 
musical interpretations of the words. I hope it's the right blend." 
</P>
<P>
The true Savoyard may be puzzled why the new company is bringing two very 
well-known works, as opposed to their new productions of "Iolanthe" or "The 
Yeomen of the Guard" (both date from 1988). 
</P>
<P>
"I think the repertoire is perhaps better known on the East Coast than on the 
West Coast," said Bishop, "and I think that we're coming to a new area, which 
perhaps has probably not got the same basic, intrinsic audience for the works. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe if we'd gone to New York or the East Coast, I think probably we could be 
more adventurous. But I think of coming here, that this is a building block for 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
Although the original company shut down in 1982, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust 
continued, according to Bishop. Further, before her death in 1985, Dame Bridget 
D'Oyly Carte, granddaughter of founder Richard D'Oyly Carte, left a bequest of 
about $2 million "specifically to restart the company," Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
"To that, which we got the interest from, my company, British Midland Airways, 
matched the income bequest. Together, between the two, we were able to get the 
capital to restart the company." 
</P>
<P>
The new D'Oyly Carte mounts two new productions a year and operates on an 
annual budget of $2 million. This year, the company created a new "H.M.S. 
Pinafore" and "Trial by Jury," bringing the total restagings now to six, almost 
midway through the canon. 
</P>
<P>
But if this is the beginning of one era, it's also the end of another, 
according to Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
"When we get back to England, we'll be getting ready to produce operas other 
than Gilbert and Sullivan," Bishop said. "The D'Oyly Carte is actually going to 
diversify. . . . I think there is a place in Britain for us to become the 
national light opera company." 
</P>
<P>
Further, the company will be leaving London and moving to a new home and 
permanent base in Birmingham beginning in January. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have much more resources because they are giving us 
accommodations for a front office and giving us a theater, which they're 
refurbishing for us, and in which we'll be playing in twice a year," Bishop 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"From the company point of view, we will have a lot more support behind us in 
the future than we've had in the past. It's been quite a difficult thing to run 
a company of this size without government aid or any other kind of aid. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've got very firm ground to build on for the future. But one of the 
most important things is to bring younger people back in to see the shows, 
because one of things that was happening was that the audience was getting 
ancient along with the productions. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to bring younger people back in. But we think we're doing all 
right."

Inside the Encina Power Plant in Carlsbad, bicycles are casually parked 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The bikes are essential for employees to get around the plant: It is a block 
wide and a block-and-a-half long. 
</P>
<P>
The whine of fans and churning turbines in the plant combine with the hum of 
electric monitoring equipment, heat blasting furnaces and clanging metal. Most 
workers are dressed casually, in blue jeans and running shoes. 
</P>
<P>
A few miles up the coast, at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, there 
are no bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
Concrete encased nuclear reactors are sited in an imposing jumble of hoses, 
ladders, security checkpoints, green-glass guard towers, barbed wire loops, 
catwalks and cranes. There are occasional glimpses of employees wearing 
protective jumpsuits and signs warning of radioactive material. 
</P>
<P>
Tremendous amounts of power are produced at the two North County power plants, 
each planted on the ocean's edge. One is fueled by the burning of natural gas 
and oil; the other by controlled nuclear reaction. 
</P>
<P>
The plants give North County what are probably its most dramatic man-made 
landmarks: the cherry-light topped domes at San Onofre and the box-shaped, 
steel-facaded plant and 380-foot-tall tower at Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
The Encina plant is owned by San Diego Gas &amp; Electric; the San Onofre plant 
is owned primarily by Southern California Edison, but in part by SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
Homer Simpson, the bumbling nuclear plant worker from the television show "The 
Simpsons" is not a popular figure among the 2,300 men and women who work at San 
Onofre. 
</P>
<P>
In one episode, set in a San Onofre-like plant, Homer drives a forklift into 
barrels of radioactive materials. 
</P>
<P>
"The writers for the Simpsons were here for a tour a couple of months back. . . 
.They came here for a general impression," said engineer Eugene Cramer. 
</P>
<P>
Cramer pointed to a nearby door and said in dismay, "They made it look as if 
the doors at the plant were rolled-up garage doors." The door in question 
appeared, in fact, to be a formidable combination of bank vault and submarine 
hatch. 
</P>
<P>
"What I would have liked is for them to have written in a serious way about the 
serious job people do here for a serious purpose," Cramer said. 
</P>
<P>
David Barron of Southern California Edison's corporate communications 
department wasn't amused by the portrayal in the Simpsons either. "You know, 
there's a poster of that guy hanging around here -- with a bar across it. It 
says 'No Homers Here.' " 
</P>
<P>
When nuclear power station workers aren't warding off questions like "Do you 
glow in the dark?" or "Do you get your tan indoors?" they battle other 
misperceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"People think of nuclear power as a mysterious, freaky, unusual thing," said 
Cramer. "Actually it uses appropriate technology, proven by time and physical 
principles as old as the hills." 
</P>
<P>
Although San Onofre does not have the ominous reputation associated with some 
nuclear power plants -- like Three Mile Island, Diablo Canyon, Seabrook or 
Shoreham -- it is not free of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a 15-year, $46 million study of the station's environmental impact 
was completed. It cited a 200-acre reduction in the size of the San Onofre kelp 
bed as among the adverse effects of the plant. After its release, the study was 
criticized by one of its three authors as inadequate. Biologist Rimmon Fay 
disagrees with the conclusion that nearby sea life is not being significantly 
harmed. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest recognized danger from a nuclear reactor is uncontrolled release of 
radioactive material. Nuclear power plants are layered with security and safety 
precautions designed to prevent that from happening. 
</P>
<P>
Once a year, a full-scale emergency drill is staged at San Onofre. About a 
dozen groups -- ranging from the county emergency preparedness office to the 
Red Cross -- participate in the drill. There is a 12-mile radius around the 
plant designated as an emergency planning zone. Some 900 Marine housing units 
fall within the zone. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the gas-fired Encina plant, the 10-story furnace and boiler can be 
glimpsed through small portholes. Violet and yellow flames seem to press 
against the medallion-shaped windows. The fire is burning at temperatures of 
2,500 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Those flames are fueled most of the time by natural gas from Oklahoma or Texas, 
said John Pruyn, an executive at San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. About 7% of the 
fuel is low-sulfur fuel oil from Indonesia or Alaska. Natural gas arrives at 
the plant via underground pipelines. The oil is delivered by tankers that 
anchor off Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
In the 36 years the plant has been operating, only the smallest spillage has 
occurred, according to Pruyn. 
</P>
<P>
Once a year, the plant stages an oil containment exercise to prepare it to deal 
with an oil spill, should one occur. 
</P>
<P>
A staff of about 125 -- engineers, mechanics, maintenance workers, and control 
room technicians -- keeps the Encina plant in operation 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
The power plant, switchyard and other property covers about 800 acres, 
including the adjacent lagoon. Encina uses water from the Agua Hedionda Lagoon 
to cool its interior pipes. 
</P>
<P>
Pruyn shouts above the roar of the plant as he explains how electricity is 
generated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a giant tea kettle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The tea kettle analogy works this way: The furnace heats purified water, the 
water turns to steam, the steam rises through pipes to the top of the boiler to 
a drum. The drum pipes the steam to a turbine. 
</P>
<P>
The steam, pressing at about 1,900 pounds of pressure per square inch, spins 
the blades of a turbine (there are five of them at Encina). 
</P>
<P>
The turbine operator shaft, spinning faster than the speed of sound, creates a 
magnetic field. Electricity is generated by rotating this magnetic field 
between thick coils of heavy wire. 
</P>
<P>
The electricity then rides through two-inch thick cables out the side of the 
building, through the switchyard and to neighboring substations and then to 
local transformers (there is about one on every block), and from there to 
houses and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Nestled between the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base and the Pacific, San 
Onofre's three nuclear reactors straddle 257 acres leased from the Department 
of the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
Two reactors are under concrete domes; the other is in an earlier-style, 
flat-roofed, cylinder-shaped building. 
</P>
<P>
The reactors are fueled by uranium pellets that arrive by truck. The fuel is 
mined, refined and purified by the federal government. The uranium reaches a 
high level of radioactivity only after it is in the reactor and the chain 
reaction begins. 
</P>
<P>
The tea kettle principle in use at the Carlsbad site is, in many ways, also the 
axiom in action at San Onofre. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is in how the water is brought to a boil. 
</P>
<P>
Nuclear heat within the reactor core is developed when atoms of uranium fuel 
are split apart. This fissioning process, as it is called, is limited by 
control rods. When control rods are inserted the chain reaction is stopped; 
when they are withdrawn, that reaction resumes again. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to producing huge amounts of electricity, the process produces 
radioactive waste. 
</P>
<P>
High-level radioactive waste is stored at the plant in fuel storage pools made 
of reinforced concrete and steel. 
</P>
<P>
Items such as jumpsuits, towels, gloves and shoe covers worn by workers become 
contaminated with low level radiation. The contamination typically occurs when 
maintenance, surveilance personnel, mechanics or craftsmen work with electrical 
components or piping inside the reactors. 
</P>
<P>
The protective garments are run through a washing machine equipped with a 
filter designed to collect radioactive particles. If the radioactivity cannot 
be washed out, the items join other low-level radioactive waste material that 
is packed in barrels and shipped to Beatty, Nev., where it is buried. 
</P>
<P>
"People flip that switch and they never realize the amount of expertise, fine 
tuning, and technology it takes to produce a watt," said Pruyn of SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
Utilities measure and bill consumers for electricity by kilowatt hours. 
</P>
<P>
One kilowatt hour, which costs about 9 cents, is equivalent to one 100 watt 
light bulb illuminated for 10 hours. A typical household uses about 500 
kilowatt hours a month. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the power it draws from San Onofre, Encina and a third plant in Chula 
Vista, SDG&amp;E must still import almost half its power. The utility serves 
900,000 households in San Diego County and about 50,000 in southern Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two years ago, a merger between SDG&amp;E and Southern California Edison 
was proposed. The merger, if approved, would create the nation's largest 
electric utility, with 4.8 million customers. State and federal regulators 
won't finish their reviews of that proposal for several months, but many 
observers believe that some version of the merger will eventually be approved. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, North County's two giant power plants continue to produce 
electricity for consumers in this area and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Encina and San Onofre combined produced 17.7 billion kilowatts. 
</P>
<P>
Which is enough to boil the water in a lot of tea kettles.

Comic Martha Jane has been described as a cross between Lily Tomlin and Bette 
Midler. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words," she says, "I'm intellectual but loud." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-tall, red-haired comedian, who plays the recurring role of Mrs. Luby 
on the TV series "Lenny," is appearing at the Laff Stop in Newport Beach on a 
bill headlined by comic Tim Jones through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston-born comic, whose comedy heroes include Tomlin, Jackie Gleason and 
Margaret Dumont (Groucho Marx's movie foil), has appeared on such syndicated TV 
shows as "Comedy Express," "Comic Strip Live" and "George Schlatter's Comedy 
Club." 
</P>
<P>
During an interview Jane once gave in Canada, a woman journalist noted that 
women today are looking for men with a sense of humor. Then she asked, "Do you 
think men are looking for a sense of humor in women?" 
</P>
<P>
Replied Jane: "I think men are looking for women who are naked. If they have a 
sense of humor, it's a bonus. But naked is the key word." 
</P>
<P>
Although she appears in comedy clubs around the country, Jane prefers to stay 
close to home in Los Angeles so she can be available for acting auditions. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years ago, she starred in a play written and directed by Sean Penn 
that ran in an experimental theater. Rehearsals were held at Penn's house while 
he was still married to Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
The play's title? "The Kindness of Women." Says Jane: "It's about a guy with 
marital problems." 
</P>
<P>
Who: Martha Jane. 
</P>
<P>
When: Thursday, Oct. 18, at 8:30 p.m.; Friday, Oct. 19, at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.; 
Saturday, Oct. 20, at 8, 10 and 11:45 p.m.; and Sunday, Oct. 21, at 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Where: The Laff Stop, 2122 S.E. Bristol St., Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Whereabouts: From the Corona del Mar Freeway, take the Irvine Boulevard/Campus 
Drive exit and go south one block to Bristol Street. 
</P>
<P>
Wherewithal: $7 to $10. 
</P>
<P>
Where to Call: (714) 852-8762.

BEST BET: FALLBROOK THEATER; 
</P>
<P>
'COCKTAIL HOUR' IS BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Fallbrook Players will perform A. R. Gurney's comedy "The Cocktail Hour" 
beginning Friday at the Mission Theatre in Fallbrook. The play will show on 
weekends through Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first time "The Cocktail Hour" has been performed in San Diego 
County since its premier at the Old Globe Theatre in the summer of 1988. The 
comedy is one of several plays making up the Fallbrook Players' 10th season. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cocktail Hour" deals with the conflicting goals and values of an 
upper-class father and his disruptive son, who has just arrived home with news 
he has written a play about them. The setting is a city in northern New York 
State. 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook resident Conrad J. Schuck portrays Bradley, the father, and Nancy 
Ebsen of Newport Beach portrays Ann, the mother. Oceanside's Vinny Ferrelli and 
Chris Wheeler play John and Nina, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The play is co-directed by Diane Boeke and Orolie Gubser. "The Cocktail Hour" 
reunites the talents of Schuck, Ebsen and Boeke, who last worked together two 
years ago on the Fallbrook stage in "The Dining Room," another Gurney play.

DAVID NELSON / ON RESTAURANTS: YOU CAN STILL COUNT ON ANTHONY'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Circular stickers have been affixed to the menus at Anthony's Rancho Bernardo 
and the other members of the locally owned chain of Anthony's seafood 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"Mama Ghio (restaurant founder and matriarch Catherine Ghio) is concerned about 
your health!" announce the stickers, which continue, "She removed 1/2 the salt, 
1/2 the calories, all the cholesterol but none of the flavor from her famous 
tartar sauce, coleslaw, Louie and house dressing." 
</P>
<P>
Any change is noteworthy at Anthony's, since the recipes were more or less 
engraved in stone some decades ago and have become an immutable part of dining 
out in San Diego County. In this chain's case, the reluctance to revise 
anything is healthy, as it gives Anthony's a reliability offered by few other 
places. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony's Rancho Bernardo falls into the chain's mid-range, which means that it 
takes an upscale tone compared to the Anthony's Grottoes but does not attempt 
the fancy tricks performed at the waterside Star of the Sea. The dining rooms 
at this sprawling restaurant are comfortable but far from formal, a comment 
which also describes the clientele. The seafood's the thing here, and in that 
department Anthony's continues to deliver a quality remarkably unchanged from 
years past. 
</P>
<P>
The cuisine makes little effort at "gourmet" niceties, although the daily 
specials list now mentions shrimp-flavored beurre blanc on the orange roughy 
and dilled beurre blanc with the salmon. What other ethnic overtones exist are 
Italian, a reflection of the Ghio heritage, but these, too, are few; they 
include pasta with clam sauce and a "fisherman's style" clam chowder flavored 
with tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
The main attractions remain the sheer length and diversity of the standing 
menu; the extensive, ever-changing selection of fresh fish and the unique 
"grill-broiling" process that treats fish to a light coating of bread crumbs 
and simultaneously grills them from below while broiling them from above. The 
process results in a moist, evenly cooked piece of fish, as was certainly the 
case with a filet of halibut that a guest recently gobbled down in record time. 
</P>
<P>
The local lobster season opened in early October, and Anthony's char-broiled a 
fine specimen in so careful a manner as to refute those who suggest that 
Eastern beasts are better than our own. The meat was exceptionally moist and 
sweet, and the lobster generously sized for the price. The accompaniments with 
this, as with other entrees, were simple but satisfactory and included a choice 
of chowder (the New England style is creamy and flavorful) or simple salad, and 
a second choice of decent french fried potatoes, pasta or San Diego's oddly 
beloved rice pilaf. 
</P>
<P>
The hot and cold appetizer lists concentrate on shellfish and include the 
luxuries of lobster cocktail, cracked Dungeness crab and a plate of lightly 
breaded, crisply fried crab claws; these last were beautifully cooked and 
plentifully portioned. The standing menu begins with fried items but branches 
out to frog's legs (few places offer this under-appreciated meat); sauteed 
scallops finished with a nicely pungent bordelaise sauce; creamed crab 
casserole; sole stuffed with assorted shellfish; abalone, and even grilled rib 
eye steak and a chicken breast done Cajun style. 
</P>
<P>
The fresh fish list ranges broadly and recently included a few items that other 
restaurants rarely serve, most notably rex sole. Other possibilities included 
tuna filet; boned, charbroiled fresh trout from Idaho; catfish in either the 
recommended grill-broiled style or the dubious Cajun rendition, and mahi mahi, 
again in beurre blanc, but on this occasion with chopped macadamia nuts stirred 
in for an Hawaiian accent. 
</P>
<P>
On the dessert list, the hot fudge sundae would seem indicated as the most 
suitable close to this menu, but the cake in zabaglione sauce makes a decent 
alternative, even though the cake has a less than winning texture.

PASTOR FREED AFTER DETOUR TO MEXICAN PRISON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Rev. Ronald Conway Shackelford was freed from a Mexican prison after four 
days and nights, he wasted no time in recrossing the border and heading home. 
</P>
<P>
The San Clemente minister, who was arrested after he allegedly passed a 
counterfeit $100 bill at a toll booth near Rosarito Beach, told Mexican 
authorities "muchas gracias," forgot his Bible in his cell, and headed north. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to cross over the border before I began to jump up and down," 
Shackelford said Wednesday during an interview at the San Clemente Presbyterian 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
Shackelford was released from prison Tuesday night after Mexican authorities 
determined the minister had unwittingly used the counterfeit U.S. bill to pay 
the toll booth operator. 
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old father of two said being thrown in jail was the last thing he 
expected when he and 20 other church members left San Clemente Saturday morning 
on a goodwill mission to the Welcome Home Orphanage near rural Colonia Guerrera 
Vicente, about 180 miles south of Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
But Shackelford found himself in trouble shortly after he tendered a $100 bill 
to pay a $3.50 charge on the Tijuana-Ensenada tollway. Mexican police stopped 
the pastor's 12-passenger van at the next stop and escorted him back to the 
first toll booth. 
</P>
<P>
There, they showed Shackelford the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that there was nothing wrong with it," he said. "But when I 
examined it closely, I noticed that both the paper and color were different. I 
thought, 'Well, this is going to be the beginning of a nightmare.' " 
</P>
<P>
Shackelford was taken to a downtown Tijuana prison where he was placed in a 
cramped cell with six Mexican men, he said. The toilet in the cell didn't flush 
and the blare of the stereos, VCRs and radios supplied by prisoners' relatives 
often awakened him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a game of charades," said Shackelford, who doesn't speak Spanish, 
about his attempts to communicate with his cellmates. "I didn't know why they 
were in there, and we had to communicate by sign language." 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Hodgkins, a founder of the orphanage who was with Shackelford when he 
was arrested, telephoned the San Clemente Presbyterian Church to alert them. 
Senior pastor James Farley then began making a series of moves to free 
Shackelford. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, authorities transferred Shackelford to a nearby federal prison after 
they determined that his alleged crime was a federal offense. There, 
Shackelford's cellmates included two teen-age car thieves, a dentist who was 
caught driving an unregistered vehicle and a man accused of possessing 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
The minister said he prayed constantly and began to preach to his cellmates. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt sorry for those guys . . . I thought about how (in the Bible) when 
Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers, how he adapted so well," 
Shackelford said. "I began to think about the hostages in Lebanon and how they 
must knock their heads against the wall everyday. God! I hope they get out." 
</P>
<P>
By Monday, the U.S. Consul in Tijuana, the office of Rep. Ron Packard 
(R-Carlsbad), Shackelford's Mexican lawyer and church officials in San Clemente 
and Mexico were all working for the pastor's release. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that the Mexican judicial system was moving too slowly, Farley used 
the church's prayer line on Tuesday to tell his parishioners about 
Shackelford's arrest, urging them to join in the campaign. Many of the 1,100 
church members bombarded the consulate and the congressman's office with 
appeals for the pastor's release. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, the Mexican district attorney told Shackelford that he did 
not find any criminal intent and was dropping the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Shackelford was hugged and kissed by church workers when he reported for work 
Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not a hero," the pastor later protested. "The people who are running the 
orphanage are the heroes. I hope all this publicity makes people aware that 
they need basic things like food and blankets." 
</P>
<P>
Shackelford said the experience will not prevent him from returning to Mexico 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
"But this time I'm going to take smaller bills," he said. "And I'm going to let 
someone else pay the tolls."

<P>
Since August, 7-year-old Sean Young has been in a decidedly less-than-desirable 
school environment. His "classroom" has no walls. Its floors are made of dirt 
and brush. Its ceiling is the sky. 
</P>
<P>
Like other homeless children, Sean has had to make do with picnic tables or 
cramped campers when Ann Robinson -- a county Department of Education teacher 
who travels to parks, motels and other areas frequented by the homeless -- 
comes around with his lessons. 
</P>
<P>
But thanks to a $300,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Education, Sean and 
his sister, Shana, 6, will soon have their phonics, math and penmanship lessons 
in a comfortable classroom on wheels. 
</P>
<P>
The county Department of Education plans to use the grant, funded under the 
federal Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, to purchase a motor home 
and stock it with books, computers and screening facilities to monitor the 
students' health. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fantastic," said Sean and Shana's father, Doc Young, 38, who has 
been living in Featherly Regional Park and other county campsites with his 
wife, Tracey, 26, and five children since August. "They'll have something 
that's more of a school atmosphere. On a rainy day, (the classes) won't have to 
crowd inside a camper or a tent or meet in a restaurant. It's much more 
conducive to studying." 
</P>
<P>
County Department of Education officials gathered reporters outside of Young's 
campsite in Featherly Park Wednesday to discuss plans for expanding Project 
HOPE -- Homeless Outreach Program for Education -- and to show off a mobile 
school being used in another county education program that is similar to the 
motor home to be purchased for Project HOPE. 
</P>
<P>
Red Balfour, principal of the county's Community Home Education Program, said 
the new mobile school should be ready in about six weeks. The federal grant 
also will enable the county to buy a van and hire another full-time teacher and 
add two more instructional aides to serve homeless youngsters. Ultimately, 
Project HOPE will have two mobile homes and two vans staffed by two teachers 
and three instructional aides, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About a third of Orange County's estimated 6,000 to 10,000 homeless people are 
children, according to a survey released in February by the Orange County 
Homeless Issues Task Force. Project HOPE -- believed to be the only mobile 
education program in the United States -- is the only program available that 
ensures at least some continuity in education for the homeless, Balfour said. 
The project keeps track of homeless families through an 800 number, which 
parents phone whenever they are about to move so that Robinson can visit them 
at their new locations, which she said includes parks, motels, warehouses and 
sometimes just a street corner. 
</P>
<P>
Balfour said Robinson is responsible for assessing the children's grade levels 
and putting together "a comprehensive educational program for them." The 
students are then grouped by age and grade level, and Robinson teaches 
appropriate lessons to each group. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the old one-room schoolhouse," Robinson said, adding that she tries 
to get to see each child two or three times a week. An instructional aide 
visits the students on other days to check on their work and provide tutoring 
if necessary, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping this will be a pilot for the rest of the state," Balfour said. He 
added that Orange County education officials are working with coordinators of 
homeless programs in Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties to 
launch similar programs to better serve homeless families who often move from 
one county to the other. 
</P>
<P>
The Youngs said that cooperation among the counties would be beneficial to 
their family because they have been shuttling between Riverside and Orange 
counties since they were evicted from their Corona apartment in June. 
</P>
<P>
Restricted to two-week stays on county campsites and in most motels, the Youngs 
began to fear that their children would never be allowed to enroll in school 
because of their lack of a permanent address. But shortly after moving into 
Featherly Park, they heard about Project HOPE, and, coincidentally, Robinson 
heard that there was a new family in residence with school-age children. 
</P>
<P>
"Ann was literally looking for us at the same time we were looking for her," 
said Doc Young, an unemployed truck driver who, ironically, said he was once a 
high school physics and algebra teacher in Massachusetts. "Ann is an incredible 
teacher. You can literally see tears in her eyes when children have done a good 
job." 
</P>
<P>
Project HOPE hit the road last December after nearly a year of planning, and 
since then Robinson has loaded her Chevrolet pickup each morning with boxes of 
books and supplies. She has been using whatever facilities are available -- 
picnic sites, libraries, and even restaurants -- to instruct the 31 youngsters 
in grades kindergarten through eight currently enrolled in the 
independent-study program. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being unable to carry around all of the materials needed for 
proper schooling, Robinson said the biggest problem has been that classes are 
at the mercy of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
The mobile school will also be valuable because, with tables that can be used 
as makeshift desks and bookshelves lining the vehicle, students will feel more 
like they are in a real classroom, easing the transition back into regular 
schools, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson has definitely had an impact on Sean and Shana Young. Shana said she 
prefers hunting tiny lizards to going to school but nevertheless looks forward 
to returning to an ordinary classroom. "But I still want my teacher," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And Sean, who sports a mane of shoulder-length blond hair, said he diligently 
does his homework assignments because he fears that Robinson will spend less 
time with him if he doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
"When I don't do my homework, I get freaked out," he said.

REHEARSAL FOR THE UNTHINKABLE AT SAN ONOFRE

SAN ONOFRE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in seven years, Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials 
watched Wednesday as an emergency test was conducted at the San Onofre Nuclear 
Generating Station, located just three miles south of San Clemente and 
thousands of South County residents. 
</P>
<P>
It was just a test, a simulated emergency that officials say is unlikely to 
occur. But for Harold Ray, a senior vice president with power plant owner 
Southern California Edison Co., it was an exercise in confronting the 
unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
Ray was huddled down, surrounded by nuclear engineers and technicians, trying 
to grasp the magnitude of the apocalyptic scenario before him: a major disaster 
at the San Onofre atomic plant that led to wide scale evacuations in Orange and 
San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
During the drill, orders came to evacuate 35,000 people in San Clemente and 
thousands of others in San Juan Capistrano and Dana Point who live in a 10-mile 
radius around the plant in what is called a nuclear emergency zone. This zone 
also includes portions of Camp Pendleton and San Onofre State Park. Local 
agencies were asked to map out what it would take to get tens of thousands of 
people out of those areas. 
</P>
<P>
The annual test was run from the San Onofre facility, located on a 257-acre 
site next to the Marine base and alongside Interstate 5. The San Onofre station 
is comprised of three nuclear units that at full power can produce enough 
electricity to meet the needs of nearly three million people. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency scenario involved a complicated script devised by Edison and NRC 
officials, who monitor the responses of those involved and score them later in 
a detailed report. Participants, including Ray and 20 NRC employees, did not 
know what to expect and were forced to deal with a series of emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Phelps, Edison's vice president of corporate communications, said the 
script was designed to strip the plant of several built-in layers of defense 
mechanisms against disaster. It also condensed a period of several days into a 
six-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
The mock countdown to disaster began with a coolant leak in one of San Onofre's 
three reactors, followed by a fiery propane tanker truck collision on the San 
Diego Freeway just north of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Next, two television helicopters trying to film the truck accident collided in 
the air and crashed into the power plant's electrical switchyard, causing a 
complete power loss to the plant and the surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there was a failure in a backup diesel-powered generator, which keeps the 
reactor's cooling system running in a power failure, causing a release of 
radiation into the air. The final blow came when a crack appeared in the 
protective shell covering the reactor, allowing radioactive material to escape. 
</P>
<P>
"We are practicing something that is highly unlikely to occur in the real 
world," Phelps said. "The odds of all these things happening are incalculably 
small. But we (theoretically) have to do that to lose the ability to put water 
in the coolers, and in order for people in the cities to participate." 
</P>
<P>
Edison officials had no figures of how many casualties might occur under such a 
scenario. 
</P>
<P>
Many Edison employees in the drill were matched with an NRC counterpart, said 
Russ Maribito, an NRC spokesman called in to assist from the agency's Chicago 
offices. And all were watched by a handful of NRC observers. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from handling technical problems and coordinating emergency responses, 
company officials also practiced relaying information to the media -- a crucial 
element in trying to handle such a dire emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Maribito said that getting accurate information to the public plays as 
important a role as stopping a radiation leak, a lesson officials learned 
during the Three Mile Island nuclear disaster. In that incident, considered the 
worst to date in the United States, radiation escaped from a malfunctioning 
nuclear reactor, and company officials were criticized for being too slow in 
getting accurate information out to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole emergency response scenario is an outgrowth of Three Mile Island," 
Maribito said. "If there is a lesson to be learned, it is that you have to be 
prepared in the unlikely event of an emergency, and that includes notifying the 
pubic. Three Mile Island was a public affairs disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Ray said that a report detailing how the NRC scored the emergency response test 
would be available to the public in about 30 days and that company employees 
would be briefed on preliminary results by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
During the drill, Ray and the plant's emergency coordinator quietly reviewed 
information from nuclear engineers, radiation specialists and emergency 
response teams. 
</P>
<P>
Around them, workers bustled in and out of cubicles, listening to two-way 
radios, keeping track of each move on a series of charts. 
</P>
<P>
The response to the mock accident was played out in a "fishbowl," a 
glass-partitioned office area in a radiation-proof building near the power 
plant. In a real emergency, this area would become the control center for 
Edison workers and NRC officials, Ray said. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest part is to keep in proper focus . . . to have an awareness of all 
the pieces of information necessary to make a decision," said Ray, who is 
responsible for emergency decisions at the San Onofre plant. 
</P>
<P>
Maribito, the NRC spokesman, said that Edison officials seemed to have handled 
the drill well but that if the NRC finds fault with their response, the federal 
government could suggest ways to improve Edison's emergency program.

In what may be an unprecedented action, the Orange City Council voted Wednesday 
to sue former Planning Commissioner Don Greek, who allegedly ignored 
conflict-of-interest warnings and allowed his engineering firms to accept at 
least $104,000 in city contracts while he was a public official. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office is now reviewing a criminal complaint against 
Greek, who resigned from the commission in August to run for City Council in 
the Nov. 6 election. On Wednesday, Greek said he "didn't know anything about" 
the council's action and declined to comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
However, Greek said the conflict-of-interest allegations are politically 
motivated and are intended to force him out of the council race. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, this won't be resolved until after the election, and by then it 
won't make any difference," Greek said. "It's an attempt to intimidate me not 
to run for office and an attempt to discredit me." 
</P>
<P>
The council's 5-0 vote, taken after two closed sessions Wednesday, calls for 
filing a civil lawsuit to recover funds paid to DGA Consultants Inc. and Don 
Greek &amp; Associates while Greek was a planning commissioner. Greek is a 
civil engineer and part owner of both firms. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Don E. Smith would say only that "after conferring with outside counsel, 
(the city attorney) finds that a cause of action exists to recover monies from 
Mr. Don Greek." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joanne Coontz, an opponent of Greek in the upcoming election, 
denied that the council action was based on a political vendetta and noted that 
the vote was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking action in line with our fiduciary responsibilities as council 
members," Coontz said. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of money to be sought through the suit is undetermined, Smith said. 
However, documents now being reviewed by the district attorney's office show 
that Greek's firms did at least $104,000 worth of business with the city 
between 1986 and 1990. Greek was appointed to the Planning Commission in 1983, 
but information about contracts issued between 1983 and 1986 has not been 
released by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Corrado, special counsel to the City Council, said his firm will search 
city files for those contracts and documents before filing the lawsuit next 
week. The City Council hired the Fullerton law firm of Corrado &amp; Newton to 
handle matters related to the Greek case. 
</P>
<P>
Local political activist Shirley Grindle, author of Orange County's 
conflict-of-interest law, said the case is the first of its kind in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never heard of any city or county taking action on this kind of 
violation where a former official has done business with the jurisdiction," 
said Grindle, whose complaint against Greek prompted the district attorney's 
office to review the matter. "I'm sure that this is a first." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, then-City Atty. Gene R. Minshew warned Greek in a letter that the 
payments to his engineering firms could be considered improper under a state 
conflict-of-interest code. The code says that state, county and city employees 
and officers "shall not be financially interested in any contract made by them 
in their official capacity or by any body or board of which they are members." 
</P>
<P>
"You and I have talked twice about this matter," Minshew wrote. "I have a 
feeling that you may not be giving the matter the attention it deserves." 
</P>
<P>
Greek has said he doesn't remember receiving the letter or discussing the 
matter with Minshew.

$20,000 REWARD URGED IN ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Gene Wisner has proposed that the city offer a $20,000 reward for 
information leading to the capture of a band of Asian youths who stormed into a 
home, bound and assaulted family members and fled with jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 14, members of a middle-class Chinese family were bound with duct tape 
while the teen-agers took their jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
The mother of the family was pistol-whipped, leaving her with facial cuts, a 
black eye and a broken hand. Brea officers, who patrol Yorba Linda, said that 
although the family is Chinese, the intrusion resembles home invasions that 
have plagued the county's Vietnamese community. 
</P>
<P>
Wisner, noting that Yorba Linda's crime rate was among the lowest in Orange 
County, said the reward would show criminals that the city is serious about 
cracking down on crime. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt now is the time to bring it to a screeching halt," Wisner told council 
members Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Wisner said he also would offer $1,000 of his own money for the reward. 
</P>
<P>
"For $20,000, those people are going to come forward and tell us something," 
Wisner said after Tuesday's City Council meeting. "We don't want to see 
something like this happening again." 
</P>
<P>
City Council members voted to take the proposal under study. TED JOHNSON

CAMPAIGN LITERATURE ORDINANCE REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council this week rejected an ordinance proposed by Councilman Orville 
Amburgey that would have required council candidates to file their campaign 
literature with the city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency ordinance -- so named because it would have taken effect 
immediately if approved by four of the five council members -- received only 
the support of its sponsor. Councilman Ed Glasgow was absent. 
</P>
<P>
"We basically discussed it and the council majority didn't feel it would 
accomplish what it was set out to do and that is to try to reduce negative 
campaign literature," said Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis. 
</P>
<P>
However, Amburgey, who is seeking his second four-year term on the council, 
said the ordinance would have given candidates an opportunity to respond to 
negative statements. 
</P>
<P>
"What was behind it was that I received information from reliable sources that 
some of the opposition will be passing out 'hit pieces' before the election and 
I feel that Costa Mesa doesn't need that," Amburgey said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hit pieces" contain negative information about opponents and are distributed 
shortly before an election. 
</P>
<P>
Amburgey has accused candidate Jay Humphrey of distributing negative campaign 
information, including copies of newspaper stories concerning Amburgey's 
conflict-of-interest battles over the last few months. Amburgey has been 
criticized for refusing to abstain from votes involving his son's construction 
company and others who have donated to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The failed ordinance, modeled after similar measures passed in Newport Beach 
and Stanton, would have required candidates to provide the city clerk with 10 
copies of any literature distributed within 14 days of an election. Mayor Peter 
F. Buffa, who is also seeking his second term on the council this year, said 
the ordinance is unnecessary because candidates find out immediately if someone 
is distributing information about them. 
</P>
<P>
He also questioned whether the city would be interfering with the First 
Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech -- an argument that has been raised 
in the cities that approved the campaign document ordinance. MARY ANNE PEREZ

DANCERS TO HOME IN ON HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Saint Joseph Ballet Company will be tackling a social issue that 
hits close to home when they perform their annual fall dance concert tonight at 
Rancho Santiago College. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe, whose members are mostly inner-city youngsters, will perform a 
piece titled "It Happens . . . ", which deals with police sweeps of the 
homeless. Director Beth Burns said the dance was largely inspired by the sweeps 
that recently took place in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"This piece tries to honor the dignity of the homeless people who suffer on our 
street corners," Burns said. "This is very challenging for our dancers to 
perform because they are reflecting very deeply on our social problems while 
they're dancing, and that's not easy." 
</P>
<P>
In order to connect a human face with this social problem, Burns arranged for 
the group to meet Mary Coe, a 23-year-old woman who was forced to live in the 
streets of Santa Ana for three months earlier this year when her husband lost 
his job. 
</P>
<P>
Coe, who is now working and living at Orange Coast Interfaith Shelter in Costa 
Mesa, attended a rehearsal last week and talked with the dancers about some of 
her experiences as a homeless person. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Coe has served as the troupe's inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we know what she went through," said dancer Flor de Liz Alzate, 14. "When 
I'm up there on stage, I try to experience what I think she must have gone 
through. I'm trying to let the audience know how much everyone ignored her and 
harassed her." 
</P>
<P>
Coe said "It Happens . . . " reflects some of her own experiences, including 
one part of the piece that depicts a group of rich women expressing shock and 
disgust at where the homeless live. The women persuade police to ask the 
homeless to move on. 
</P>
<P>
"I cried when I saw that because it reminded me of an incident that happened to 
me," Coe said. "I was standing in front of South Coast Plaza and a woman whose 
car was full of Nordstrom bags actually got out of her car and started yelling 
at me. She told me I was disgusting and called the police. 
</P>
<P>
"This show is something everyone needs to see. It might open their eyes, and 
maybe the next time they see a homeless person on the street, they will look at 
them differently and maybe remember that they are human beings." 
</P>
<P>
This isn't the first time the award-winning company has dealt with social 
issues in its performances. In previous shows, dancers have addressed gang 
violence and the difficulties of growing up in a big city. 
</P>
<P>
Burns founded the the company in 1983 to provide youngsters with an 
after-school haven from inner-city life. Scholarships cover the costs of ballet 
training for more than 90% of the students, who practice six days a week at a 
rehearsal studio in Fiesta Marketplace on 4th Street in downtown Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, the group was asked to perform for South African Archbishop 
Desmond Tutu during his visit to Santa Ana High School. 
</P>
<P>
"It Happens . . . " is one of three pieces scheduled to be performed at the 
concert. The others are "A Seed," which is performed to African rhythms, and 
"Mi Corazon Canta," which features live mariachi music. 
</P>
<P>
The performance of "It Happens . . ." will begin at 8 p.m. in the college's 
Phillips Hall Theater. Tickets are $15. For more information, call (714) 
541-8314. GREG HERNANDEZ

PLAN TO MOVE CIVIC CENTER ABANDONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has abandoned a proposal to move the civic center to a new 
site in a residential area, a plan that led to a contentious debate in this 
normally tranquil city. 
</P>
<P>
After a short public hearing Tuesday, the council voted 3 to 1 against moving 
the city offices to a new site at the corner of Center Drive and Villa Park 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
In opposing the move, council members cited the results of a citizens' advisory 
committee survey that showed 90% of 950 respondents were opposed. 
</P>
<P>
The move would have provided enough space to triple the size of the existing 
civic center, but many residents criticized the plan as an attempt to build a 
"Taj Mahal." 
</P>
<P>
Although Mayor John Frackelton said he accepted the advisory committee's 
recommendation, he added that he would vote to drop consideration of the new 
site "with a heavy heart." 
</P>
<P>
Only Councilman Harold H. Saldarini voted to save the proposal, saying 
afterward that he thought the council had "missed a golden opportunity" to move 
the offices and library to the only other viable site in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some residents are angry that consideration of the new site was not 
dropped earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"They've known for months that the citizens are not in favor of the massive 
things they're proposing. But they continued to prolong this agony," said 
resident Don Ebrite. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have said that some form of expansion is necessary to relieve 
crowding at the current offices and to add a conference room and library space. 
The council will now pursue plans to expand the city's offices in the Villa 
Park Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
Although most residents agree the civic center offices are too crowded, they 
are divided on how much additional space is enough. JON NALICK

PILOT MISSING IN MARINE JET CRASH;

<P>
SEARCH: TEAMS COMBED 480 SQUARE MILES OF OCEAN FOR A PILOT FROM EL TORO BASE 
WHO DISAPPEARED OFF SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND.

<P>
Search teams were looking for the pilot of a Marine Corps F/A-18A Hornet that 
crashed into the ocean Tuesday night while on a routine training exercise at 
San Clemente Island, military officials said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Navy and Coast Guard search and rescue teams on Wednesday combed more than 
480 square miles of ocean between San Clemente and Catalina islands for the 
single-seat jet aircraft and its pilot, Marine Lt. Mark J. Gelgean, 27, of 
Hanford. Marine authorities said that Gelgean and his wife live in the El Toro 
area but declined to identify her. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the widespread search, all that was turned up were a few floating 
fragments from the downed fighter-bomber and an abandoned life raft, military 
officials said. It is unclear if the life raft belonged to the McDonnell 
Douglas-made jet. 
</P>
<P>
"All we found was wreckage of the aircraft," Marine Lt. Gene Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
Gelgean, who was assigned to the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, was part of 
a training exercise in which fighter pilots were learning how to fly the sleek 
F/A-18A Hornet, identical to those used by the U.S. Navy Blue Angels, Browne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gelgean and other members of the Marine All Weather Fighter Attack Squadron 
121, part of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, were practicing tricky aircraft 
carrier landing techniques at night. 
</P>
<P>
The aviators were landing and taking off from a San Clemente Island airstrip 
that was modified to simulate an aircraft carrier deck, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
During the training exercise, the ground control crew on San Clemente Island 
suddenly lost voice and radar contact with Gelgean at 9:35 p.m. Browne said, 
and the Coast Guard was immediately notified. 
</P>
<P>
Browne said that it was not immediately known how the ground crew lost contact 
with Gelgean, who is an experienced flier of the Navy A-6 Intruder but was just 
learning the more powerful F/A-18A. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, rescue ships and aircraft searched unsuccessfully for 
Gelgean in the choppy waters near the islands. 
</P>
<P>
The life raft, which was damaged, was found Wednesday morning bobbing in the 
center of the channel that separates the two islands, Coast Guard Chief Warrant 
Officer Dan Dwell said. 
</P>
<P>
It was spotted by the crew of a Coast Guard helicopter flying in the overcast 
sky above, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounding the life raft was a large pool of bright green dye that was 
noticeable for miles, Coast Guard spokeswoman First Class Petty Officer Brenda 
Toledo said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see that stuff from way out in the sky," Toledo said. "It spreads out 
fairly quickly and instead of looking for a small person, you see a large 
splotch of green." 
</P>
<P>
After the Coast Guard helicopter reached the life raft, a rescue swimmer jumped 
into the ocean and searched the area for any life. No one was found, Dewell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dwell said that it was not yet confirmed whether the life raft belonged to the 
fighter but that it and the other pieces of debris found during the search 
"were consistent with that sort of aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
Naval investigators were expected to inspect the debris Wednesday night to 
determine if it belonged to the missing aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The lengthy search operation also involved a Coast Guard search jet, an 82-foot 
Coast Guard cutter, the Point Stuart, two Naval ships and a variety of other 
military aircraft, officials said.

PEOPLE: PARAPLEGIC IS RACING TOWARD HIS ATHLETIC GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Cornelsen, 38, is in the process of remaking and redefining himself. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, the well-conditioned Huntington Beach man wants to become a 
professional athlete even though he is a paraplegic, the result of a head-on 
automobile collision three years ago in Mexicali, Mexico, that disabled his 
legs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to make a living being a professional athlete who lectures on 
handicapped sports, at least for the short term," said the one-time USC 
sociology lecturer. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year in New York he competed in a 24-hour time-trial ride in his 
racing tricycle against 82 cyclists and finished 47th. 
</P>
<P>
He was the only handicapped contestant. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Cornelsen set a record by cycling his arm-powered tricycle 2,963 
miles from Costa Mesa to New York City in 18 days, 16 hours, 52 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The old record set by a handicapped bicyclist was 32 days, 11 hours. Regular 
cyclists can do it in eight days. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed a lot of sleep," was part of the reason offered by Cornelsen for his 
success. "I had to. I started out boasting I could do it in 21 days." 
</P>
<P>
His cross-country ride had more than one objective. 
</P>
<P>
Besides raising money and bringing more awareness to what people can do after a 
major disability, "I wanted to be taken seriously as an athlete," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He received pledges for the miles he traveled cross country and raised $20,000 
for the American Paralysis Assn., which is researching methods to heal spinal 
injuries like his. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare himself, the one-time program manager for the disabled at Long Beach 
Memorial Medical Centers began training in February by cycling 80 miles a day 
on his tricycle in Huntington Beach and on the Santa Ana River bicycle trail. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a lot of attention," said the Boston University graduate, who also has 
master's degrees from the University of Connecticut and Yale as well as a 
doctorate in social work from the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't often see a cyclist rowing his way down the street," he said. He 
explained that he pushes pedals back and forth at chest level in a rowing 
fashion to propel the arm-powered machine, steered by leaning one way or the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
He works the brakes with a finger lever. 
</P>
<P>
Cornelsen said he tape-recorded his adventurous but sometimes boring cycling 
trip and kept journals from his six-month hospital stay after his accident. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes to include the facts in a book he plans to write. 
</P>
<P>
"During the cross-country trip I talked about what I was experiencing, the 
highs and the lows, the boredom and the moment of ecstasy when I finished," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cornelsen said it stimulated his mind by talking to the recorder and it also 
helped to "recapture the moment at that time because I knew it would be hard to 
recall later." 
</P>
<P>
He also attracted a lot of CB (citizens band) attention from truckers. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I had (heard) some of the things they were saying about me while I was 
cycling down the highway," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Writing, however, is only one of his goals. 
</P>
<P>
"I've put a lot of things on hold since my injury," he said. That includes a 
career in teaching or in the human services administration field, both earlier 
goals he hoped to reach with his education. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, "I'm working very hard to strengthen my legs," he said, much of it 
on gym equipment in his home. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a possibility there might be some return to my legs. It's a slow 
process." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana resident Emily L. Sodicoff, 48, the mother of five grown children, 
was named Kiwanian of the Year, the first woman to win the honor in the 70-year 
history of the Santa Ana Kiwanis Club. 
</P>
<P>
"The message I get from this is that women not only can be part of a male club 
but can be respected and responded to in a positive way," said Sodicoff, an 
insurance agent. 
</P>
<P>
Club officials said she may also be the only woman in the world to get the 
award from any Kiwanis Club.

2 ANAHEIM CARE HOMES ACCUSED OF VIOLATIONS 
</P>

Two board-and-care homes providing shelter for former mental patients have been 
operating without state licenses and may have violated other state regulations 
concerning the handling of food and medicine, an official with the California 
Department of Social Services said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The operator of the facilities failed to meet a Saturday deadline to apply for 
a state license or cease operations, said Sergio Ramirez, supervisor of the 
department's Community Care Licensing program. He added that noncompliance 
could result in a $200-per-day fine for each facility. 
</P>
<P>
Warning notices were issued late last month after state inspectors made an 
unannounced visit to one facility at 722 Modena Ave. and discovered a 
board-and-care home for six clients. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez said the inspectors found one client who said he had not seen a doctor 
in about a year but "is being forced to take medication against his will." The 
label on one prescription tranquilizer, Thorazine, had been removed and another 
person's name written on it, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
Other alleged infractions included the failure to keep medicines locked up, and 
locking the doors at 10 p.m. when a curfew is imposed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The clients told investigators they pay $500 a month, including meals, Ramirez 
said, although the food is locked in a refrigerator -- another possible 
violation of the state regulations. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor's complaint about the Modena Avenue house prompted the state 
inspection, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Through their interviews with clients at the Modena Avenue house, investigators 
confirmed that the program's headquarters is in another house at 1604 E. Elm 
St. 
</P>
<P>
The state had already received complaints about the Elm Street board-and-care 
house from neighbor William Boyer, who acted as a spokesman for the 
neighborhood Tuesday evening when he asked the Anaheim City Council to 
investigate the operation. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement presented to the council, Boyer said he and his neighbors have 
observed "public urination, public vomiting, street brawls, thefts, 
patient-versus-patient assaults, peddling merchandise door-to-door and 
questionable behavior by patients with neighborhood children." 
</P>
<P>
Boyer said in an interview Wednesday that the proper licensing would force the 
facility to operate under strict regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"How would you feel if you had people fighting in the street, yelling that they 
are going to kill each other?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez said another unannounced visit is required before the state can begin 
issuing citations for alleged violations. 
</P>
<P>
The operator of the homes, David McCartney, works at Sparr Village, a 
transitional housing center for former patients. He was unavailable for comment 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
However, Rita Hughes, who claimed to be another facility manager, said five 
separate houses make up the program called the Brotherhood. 
</P>
<P>
She said that facility also was not licensed, "but we will be." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a complete support system where houses communicate with one another. You 
have to be a recovering mental patient and you must be able to function on your 
own," Hughes said. "We try to keep our clients out of the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
She said she often cooks for the residents at the facility she manages and 
other residents help clean the house.

<P>
A man wanted in connection with a bank robbery in Cleveland, Ohio, two months 
ago was arrested Wednesday at an apartment complex here, an FBI spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Terrance Gray, 24, was being held in Orange County Jail without bail pending an 
appearance before a U.S. magistrate today on suspicion of bank robbery, FBI 
spokesman Wylie B. Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Gray was identified as a suspect after a Cleveland TV station broadcast a 
photograph taken during the bank robbery in which $3,591 was taken, Cox said. A 
viewer recognized the photo and contacted the FBI, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove police investigators developed leads on Gray's location in Orange 
County, Cox said, declining to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents arrested Gray as he drove into the parking lot of a Fullerton 
apartment complex, Cox said.

VENICE MINI-MALL PLAN DEALT A SETBACK; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS VOTED TO REQUIRE ENVIRONMENTAL 
CLEARANCES FROM THE CITY. THE DEVELOPER HAD RECEIVED APPROVAL THROUGH A 
SELDOM-USED STATE LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Board of Zoning Appeals member cast a tie-breaking vote this week that forces 
a Venice developer, who had received approval for an Ocean Front Walk mini-mall 
project without going through normal permit processes, to obtain environmental 
clearances from the city. 
</P>
<P>
The vote by board member Daniel Lamaute, who was absent when the appeal was 
considered by the board two weeks ago, is another foray into uncharted waters 
for a case referred to by one attorney as a conundrum. 
</P>
<P>
The project at issue is a 21,269-square-foot, three-story mini-mall planned by 
developer Stephen Blanchard for the Venice Boardwalk at Sunset Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Venice residents had been vigilant about following the progress of the 
mini-mall, which is designed to contain up to 28 shops, including about a dozen 
restaurants and fast-food outlets, some of them serving alcohol. Opponents, 
contending that such a development would overwhelm the neighborhood with noise, 
congestion and other problems, sought to pare down its size and impacts. 
</P>
<P>
In mandating Tuesday that zoning administrators take back the case, board 
members acted against the counsel of the city's legal advisers, who had 
recommended that project permits be granted because the city took too long to 
consider the matter, a violation of the state Permit Streamlining Act. 
</P>
<P>
Under the little-used, 12-year-old law, a developer can demand that permits be 
issued if a city takes more than a year to decide on a project when a full 
environmental impact report is required, or six months when a modified 
environmental review is ordered. In the Blanchard project, the city missed both 
deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
The approvals "as a matter of law" were particularly upsetting to community 
members because they were shut out of the process and had no appeal rights. 
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday's vote, Zoning Administrator James Crisp wondered loud to the 
board whether their "nice action" had any legal weight. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining his action, Lamaute said that to vote otherwise would ignore the 
crucial third party in the matter -- the public. "We must put the well-being of 
our residents of our community above all else," Lamaute said. 
</P>
<P>
The board also received conflicting advice from the state attorney general's 
office. At the hearing two weeks ago, Deputy Atty. Gen. Gail Ruderman Feuer 
predicted "devastating results" statewide if the streamlining act could be used 
to avoid environmental regulations. Both the public and local government would 
lose control of the process, she argued. 
</P>
<P>
The intervention of the state attorney general before the Board of Zoning 
Appeals was unusual -- but so is this case. The city's decision to allow the 
project permits to go through without adhering to the normal permit process 
because of untoward delays is unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the project, acting as the Venice North Beach Coalition, have 
filed a lawsuit saying the state streamlining act was never intended to act as 
a loophole by which projects could avoid the full environmental reviews 
required under the California Environmental Quality Act. 
</P>
<P>
The decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals "shifts the legal burden on to 
someone other than the community," said coalition leader Steve Schlein, who 
lives next door to the proposed mall site. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the attorney for the developer is expected to sue to force the city to 
issue the permits. "The Board of Zoning Appeals is wrong," said Blanchard's 
attorney, Sherman Stacey. "Their own lawyer advised them (that) they had no 
jurisdiction." 
</P>
<P>
Stacey said he had been told he cannot appeal the board's ruling to the Los 
Angeles City Council. After getting an official opinion on that, he said, he 
will ask the Los Angeles Superior Court to order the city to issue the permits 
because of the violation of the state Permit Streamlining Act. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Stacey persuaded the California Coastal Commission to accept his 
application for a coastal permit, with a hearing scheduled for later this year. 
It is not clear how the Board of Zoning Appeals' decision will affect the bid 
for a coastal permit. Normally, the Coastal Commission does not act until a 
project has received local clearances. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Fisher, the attorney for the North Venice Beach Coalition, is seeking an 
opinion on whether the City Council can hear an appeal of the board's ruling. 
"I've never seen something so confusing and happening on so many different 
fronts," the land-use attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher also called on Venice area Councilwoman Ruth Galanter to take a strong 
leadership role in this matter, which he said has significant environmental 
ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jim Bickhart, Galanter planning deputy, the councilwoman is 
treating the case as a matter for the lawyers to iron out. 
</P>
<P>
But Fisher was critical of Galanter's decision to stay away from the issue by 
terming it a "legalistic" matter. "Every public official has to apply law to 
fact," he said.

RENT CONTROL PLAYS 2ND FIDDLE, WITH PLENTY OF DISCORD; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA: HOMELESSNESS AND DEVELOPMENT NOW OVERSHADOW THIS PERENNIAL 
ELECTION ISSUE, BUT 5 OF 10 BALLOT MEASURES DEAL WITH RENT CONTROL OR HOUSING. 
THIS TIME AROUND, LANDLORDS HAVE SOME LEVERAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After dominating Santa Monica politics for more than a decade, rent control has 
been eclipsed by homelessness and development as an issue in the Nov. 6 city 
election. 
</P>
<P>
But let's understand something: This is still Santa Monica, which means if 
there is a local election, then rent control is still a contentious subject. 
The tough rent-control laws that earned the city the nickname "the People's 
Republic of Santa Monica" are still in effect. And landlords still despise the 
laws and are still trying to bring the system down. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the 10 ballot measures before voters deal with rent control or housing 
issues. Supporters of rent control contend that a sixth measure -- one that 
would make the city attorney's office an elected position rather than one 
appointed -- is also related to rent control because it is essentially an 
attack on City Atty. Robert M. Myers, who authored the city's rent-control law. 
</P>
<P>
In this election, the rent-control fight primarily revolves around two 
competing ballot issues, one sponsored by landlords and the other by their 
longtime adversaries, Santa Monicans for Renters' Rights, the tenant political 
group commonly known by its acronym SMRR. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants make up 70% of the city's population, and in past elections they have 
given their overwhelming support to SMRR and its candidates. 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, the landlords have some leverage they have previously 
lacked, and their measure has been carefully crafted to appeal to the 
self-interest of existing tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition U, placed on the ballot after landlords collected nearly 12,000 
signatures on an initiative petition, would allow rents to increase to market 
levels on units voluntarily vacated. The fact that apartments remain subject to 
rent control even when voluntary vacancies occur is the primary reason that 
Santa Monica's rent-control system is regarded as one of the nation's toughest. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition W, which was placed on the ballot by the City Council at the urging 
of SMRR, would allow rents on voluntarily vacated units to increase, but would 
still keep the rents well below market levels. 
</P>
<P>
The prevailing view among those involved in the city election campaigns is that 
at least one of the two measures will probably pass, which means that new 
tenants moving to Santa Monica will be paying higher rents. If both measures 
are supported by a majority of voters, the one with the most affirmative votes 
would prevail. 
</P>
<P>
Although acknowledging that Proposition W was placed on the ballot to compete 
with Proposition U, tenant advocates say it was also done in recognition that 
after 11 years of rent control some changes were needed. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are promoting is a new way of dealing with rent control that is a 
little more cooperative in spirit," said Brad Jones, co-chairman of SMRR. "Rent 
control has been in effect now for 11 years, but after 11 years everything 
needs a certain amount of revision." 
</P>
<P>
But landlords say that Proposition W offers them too little, too late, and that 
the only way to maintain the city's rental housing stock is to give landlords 
the significant rent increases that would be achieved under so-called vacancy 
decontrol. 
</P>
<P>
"Voluntary vacancy does not occur often enough to accept half an increase that 
Prop. W provides," said Carl Lambert, an attorney and landlord. "Real increases 
are needed to provide incentives for landlords to stay in business." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition W would establish a system of "threshold rent" levels for vacated 
apartments throughout the city, based on the number of bedrooms and what is 
considered affordable to households whose income is 70% of the median for Los 
Angeles County. For a one-bedroom apartment, the threshold rent would be $511, 
for example, and for a two-bedroom it would be $613. 
</P>
<P>
The citywide average for all rent-controlled apartments is now about $500, 
according to rent-control officials. Although precise figures are not 
available, it is generally believed that rents on the majority of 
rent-controlled apartments in the city are below the threshold levels of 
Proposition W. 
</P>
<P>
If Proposition W passes, all apartments renting for less than the threshold 
level would be allowed to rise to the threshold level when a vacancy occurs. 
Apartments renting for more than the threshold level would be allowed 10% 
increases when a vacancy occurs, but only if they complied with a set of 
minimum maintenance standards. 
</P>
<P>
If Proposition U passes, rents on voluntarily vacated apartments could be 
expected to rise to the levels found nearby in West Los Angeles, where 
one-bedroom apartments generally go for $800 to $1,000 and two-bedroom units 
for $1,100 to $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
The landlords' principal weapon in their fight against rent control in Santa 
Monica is a 1986 state law called the Ellis Act, which allows landlords to 
evict tenants and go out of business, as long as they give adequate notice and 
pay relocation fees. Owners of more than 1,100 units have notified city 
officials that they intend to take their apartments off the market. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Proposition U say the landlord-sponsored measure is the only way 
to stop landlords from removing their apartments from the market under the 
Ellis Act. 
</P>
<P>
"The apartment income gap has grown so huge, and the turnover rate is so small 
that really significant reform is needed to encourage apartments owners to stay 
in business," said James Baker, who owns four buildings with 75 units. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords hope to draw a sizable number of tenant votes for Proposition U 
because they now have both a carrot and a stick for tenants that they have 
lacked in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The carrot is that if Proposition U passes, rent controls will remain in effect 
for existing tenants. Substantial rent increases will occur only when a unit is 
voluntarily vacated. Thus, Proposition U backers are essentially encouraging 
tenants to inflict big rent hikes on newcomers to preserve their own low rents. 
</P>
<P>
The stick is that if Proposition U does not pass, more landlords will resort to 
Ellis Act evictions. 
</P>
<P>
SMRR leaders acknowledge that the landlords have new leverage this time, and 
that the tenants group is less certain to prevail in this election. 
</P>
<P>
Both SMRR and landlords had raised more than $160,000 each as of Sept. 30, 
according to campaign financial statements filed with the city clerk. Landlords 
spent about $73,000 qualifying the initiative, whereas SMRR has spent most of 
its money on literature promoting its candidates and positions on the different 
ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords charge that SMRR, whose candidates control the majority on the City 
Council and the rent board, is only interested in saving its political future. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem that SMRR has is accepting the fact that maybe (vacancy 
decontrol) would work," said Bob Gabriel, a former City Council member who is 
listed on the ballot argument in favor of Proposition U. "Without rent control, 
SMRR's base of power would disappear." 
</P>
<P>
But rent-control advocates say that SMRR's opposition to vacancy decontrol is a 
continuation of its commitment to preserving affordable housing in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"We think vacancy decontrol is a disastrous housing policy," Jones said. "The 
free market does not apply to a good like housing. Government needs to have a 
policy that is going to maintain housing affordability." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Proposition W also argue that Proposition U would give landlords 
enough of a financial incentive to harass tenants into voluntarily giving up 
their apartments. 
</P>
<P>
"Tenants are wrong if they think a landlord won't try it," said Lisa Monk 
Borrino, a tenant attorney who is running for a seat on the Rent Control Board. 
"Landlords are going to want them out at all costs." 
</P>
<P>
Landlords counter that existing anti-harassment provisions sufficiently protect 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Jones acknowledged that landlords may not have always gotten a fair shake from 
the rent board, but said SMRR's current slate of four candidates for the board 
represents a new spirit of cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
"This group is strong on defending tenants' rights, but they have a new 
approach of attempting to work with people rather than beating them over the 
head," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
The other measures on the ballot related to rent control and housing are: 
</P>
<P>
* Proposition R, which would require that 30% of all new construction of 
multifamily housing each year be set aside for low- and moderate-income people. 
</P>
<P>
* Proposition V, which would amend the city's condominium conversion law to 
ensure that all conversions abide by the city's Tenant Ownership Rights Charter 
Amendment process. 
</P>
<P>
* Proposition X, which would exempt state-owned property from the city's 
rent-control laws. 
</P>
<P>
SMRR supports Proposition R as a way to preserve a diverse community by 
ensuring that new housing will include affordable units for people of all 
incomes. Opponents argue, however, that the provision will discourage 
development because construction costs will increase and fees normally paid by 
developers for the construction of affordable housing by the city will dry up. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition X is a narrowly written measure intended to resolve a dispute over 
whether cabanas and other living quarters on the site of the Sand and Sea Club 
fall under rent control. The club, on a parcel of state-owned beach, closed 
last month, but the individual cabanas remain open for their tenants. 
</P>
<P>
SMRR has not taken a formal position on Proposition X, but all four of its 
candidates for the rent control board oppose the measure because they say if 
rental units remain on the property they should fall under rent control. 
</P>
<P>
There is little or no opposition to Proposition V. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOUSING MEASURES ON BALLOT 
</P>
<P>
Among the 10 ballot measures that will go before Santa Monica voters Nov. 6 are 
these five dealing with housing issues. They are listed in order of appearance 
on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition R (affordable housing) -- Would require that 30% of all new 
residential multifamily units be set aside for low- and moderate-income 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Background -- Placed on the ballot by the City Council at the request of Santa 
Monicans for Renters' Rights, the city's big tenant organization. It represents 
an attempt to maintain affordable housing, particularly in the face of the 
growing number of rental units being lost as landlords go out of business. 
</P>
<P>
City Council candidates in favor -- Tony Vazquez, Kelly Olsen, Sharon L. 
Gilpin, Kathleen Schwallie. 
</P>
<P>
Against -- Jean Gebman, Christine E. Reed, Donna Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
No position -- Robert T. Holbrook, Larry Jon Hobbs. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition U (vacancy decontrol) -- Would allow rents on apartment units 
vacated voluntarily to rise to market rates. 
</P>
<P>
Background -- Placed on the ballot through initiative drive sponsored by 
landlords. Rent controls that remain in effect even when a unit is voluntarily 
vacated are what make Santa Monica's rent law one of the nation's toughest. 
Landlords say passage of this measure is the only way to make it worthwhile to 
stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates in favor -- Holbrook, Hobbs, Alvarez, Reed, Gebman. 
</P>
<P>
Against -- Vazquez, Olsen, Schwallie, Gilpin. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition V (condo conversions) -- Would amend the city's condominium 
conversion law. 
</P>
<P>
Background -- Placed on the ballot by the City Council as a way to ensure that 
all condominium conversions abide by the city's Tenant Ownership Rights Charter 
Amendment process. The city planning staff has been allowing owners who live in 
the property being considered for conversion to participate in the tenants' 
conversion vote. But the city attorney has issued a ruling that such landlords 
will no longer be allowed to vote unless this measure passes. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates in favor: Holbrook, Vazquez, Olsen, Reed, Gebman, Gilpin, Schwallie. 
</P>
<P>
No position -- Hobbs, Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition W (rent control) -- Would allow rents on units vacated voluntarily 
to be increased to specific higher levels based on number of bedrooms. Would 
also establish a set of minimum maintenance standards that landlords would have 
to meet to be eligible to collect the increased rents. 
</P>
<P>
Background -- Placed on the ballot by the City Council at the urging of Santa 
Monicans for Renters' Rights to compete with the landlord-sponsored Proposition 
U. Rents would be allowed to increase, but would remain significantly below 
free-market levels. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates in favor -- Vazquez, Olsen. 
</P>
<P>
Against -- Holbrook, Reed, Alvarez, Hobbs, Schwallie, Gebman. 
</P>
<P>
No position -- Gilpin. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition X (rent control exemption) -- Would exempt state-owned property 
from the city's rent-control law. 
</P>
<P>
Background -- Placed on the ballot by the City Council at the request of 
Councilwoman Reed. Designed to settle a question over whether cabanas and other 
living quarters on the site of the Sand and Sea Club fall under rent control. 
The club has been evicted from the site, so the measure is essentially moot 
unless the matter goes to court. 
</P>
<P>

LARGE HILLTOP HOUSE OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday approved a controversial proposal to build a 
7,000-square-foot house on a hilltop above the city despite objections from 
neighbors who complained that the structure was out of scale with the 
surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
The council's 3-2 vote overturned the Planning Commission's denial of the 
project at 1041 Summit Drive. 
</P>
<P>
During a three-hour public hearing, neighborhood representatives said they 
would not oppose the project if the applicant, Murray Ozer, agreed to move the 
house 10 feet back from the street. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ozer's representatives said moving the house would detract from the 
design of the project and argued that Ozer had already agreed to numerous 
compromises requested by the neighbors. Mayor Allan Alexander and Vice Mayor 
Vicki Reynolds voted against the project, saying the house would be too visible 
to neighboring hillside homeowners.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: OPTIONS OFFERED FOR THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two options for the proposed rehabilitation of the Culver Theater for use by 
theatrical production companies, as well as film screenings, will be available 
for public comment over the next three months. 
</P>
<P>
The plans are discussed in a feasibility study and a critique of that study, 
both of which the Redevelopment Agency voted on Tuesday to receive and file. 
</P>
<P>
The feasibility study, prepared by Thirtieth Street Architects, recommends that 
the theater be refurbished to accommodate live performances, such as small 
ensembles or dramas involving a limited number of actors without orchestra or 
complex scenery changes. This plan would entail a minimum of refurbishing of 
the existing building. 
</P>
<P>
The critique of the feasibility study, prepared by R. F. McCann &amp; Co., 
Theater Architects, proposes a more extensive rehabilitation to accommodate 
"road-house" theater companies, which would require a higher stage area to 
accommodate more elaborate scenery. The more extensive renovation would add 
$1.8 million to the cost of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Total cost for the renovation, which includes $1.5 million for asbestos 
removal, ranges from $3,838,493 to $5,638,493, depending on which option the 
agency chooses. 
</P>
<P>
Both studies, as well as the staff report, will be on file at the City Hall 
library, and the Redevelopment Agency will solicit public comment on the 
project for the next 90 days before making any further decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The theater, which closed in January, 1989, had operated as a three-screen 
movie house for 10 years. The Redevelopment Agency acquired the building in 
May, 1985, and attempted to sell it to Filmcorp Group Inc., but the two sides 
could not reach an agreement, and negotiations ended in June, 1987.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY; 
</P>
<P>
HEARING ON MARINA PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge has indicated that the environmental impact report on the Marina Place 
shopping mall fails to thoroughly discuss the impact on air quality, but the 
flaw is not fatal because mall opponents failed to raise the issue during the 
approval process by Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing Monday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski said the 
environmental report appears to lack an analysis of the cumulative impact of 
massive Westside development on air quality, as is required by the California 
Environmental Quality Act. But the mall developers had argued that the city of 
Los Angeles and the Venice Town Council had not voiced these problems to Culver 
City officials during hearings, and so the court has no jurisdiction to judge 
the adequacy of the report. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, however, did not issue a ruling, instead allowing all parties to 
file further legal arguments this week. He said he hopes to rule on the case 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles and the Venice community group seek to overturn Culver City's 
approval of the project, claiming that Culver City did not adequately assess 
the mall's impact on traffic and air quality, particularly in the Los Angeles 
neighborhoods that surround the project on three sides. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth B. Bley, attorney for Marina Place developers Prudential Insurance Co. 
and Melvin Simon &amp; Associates, urged the judge to stay -- but not overturn 
-- the development agreement between the city and the developer if Zebrowski 
finds errors in the environmental report that need correcting. The agreement 
was approved in March and was designed to shield Marina Place from any changes 
in city laws -- including the 56-foot height limit that was approved by Culver 
City voters the next month. 
</P>
<P>
The $160-million mall is to include structures as tall as 84 feet and two 
department stores, 140 other shops, restaurants and movie theaters.

GETTING PASSING GRADES AT SANTA MONICA; 
</P>
<P>
CORSAIRS ARE OFF TO A FAST START BEHIND QUARTERBACK JEFF BARRETT; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNITY COLLEGES: SOPHOMORE HAS ALREADY BROKEN SCHOOL RECORD FOR CAREER 
TOUCHDOWN PASSES. HE IS NEARING SEVERAL OTHER RECORDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most difficult passes that Santa Monica College quarterback Jeff Barrett 
has to complete are the ones he has to drive through on his long trips from his 
home in Burbank to school. 
</P>
<P>
"No one from the (San Fernando) Valley should play for Santa Monica College," 
Barrett said. "The drive is awful. I think I get more headaches from the drive 
than from football games." 
</P>
<P>
On the football field, the 5-foot-11, 185-pound sophomore from Burbank 
Burroughs High doesn't get headaches; he gives them to opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The Corsairs are 4-1 and off to their best start since the 1980 team finished 
11-0 and ranked first in the state. Barrett's accurate passing is a big reason 
why. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett, who didn't win the starting quarterback job until the middle of last 
season, has broken the school record for career touchdown passes with 29, 
including 16 this season. 
</P>
<P>
The old record of 25 was held by Craig Austin (1983-84) and John Erdhaus 
(1965-66). Erdhaus, who also holds the school's single-season record of 2,393 
passing yards, threw his 25 scoring passes in 1966, when SMC finished 8-0-1 and 
ranked first in the nation. Jim Powers, whose Corsair teams usually disdained 
running the ball and exalted the pass, was the SMC coach when Erdhaus was 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett is third in SMC history with 2,952 career passing yards, behind 
first-place Kevin Bray (3,319 yards in 1985-86) and Angelo Gasca (3,071 yards 
in 1978-79). In career total offense, Barrett trails Bray, who had 3,300 yards, 
and Gasca, who had 3,097. 
</P>
<P>
Through four games, Barrett was the state's top community college passer with 
an efficiency rating of 187. His nearest competitor, Richard Fanti of Rancho 
Santiago, had a 165.7 rating. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett was efficient last week, completing 21 of 27 passes (77.7%) for 284 
yards and two touchdowns as the Corsairs (3-1 in the Western State Conference) 
rolled to a 38-14 road victory against Santa Barbara City College. For the 
season, he has completed 87 of 131 passes (66.4%) for 1,442 yards and seven 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett has long been an excellent passer. In three years at Burbank Burroughs, 
he passed for 6,083 yards, fifth on the all-time CIF-Southern Section list for 
career yardage. The passers in first through fourth place are Todd Marinovich 
with 9,182 yards, Pat Haden with 7,633, Bret Johnson with 6,653 and Dan McGwire 
with 6,559. 
</P>
<P>
So Barrett has strong credentials -- strong enough, one would think, to have 
earned him a scholarship to a four-year school, as did the quarterbacks ahead 
of him on the career passing yardage list. He did receive a scholarship to 
Nevada Reno, but he spent his freshman season there as a redshirt, playing 
quarterback for the scout team that simulated the offenses of opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of got beat up every day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also tired of Reno's bucolic atmosphere and its snow. 
</P>
<P>
"I like snow, but I don't want to live in it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett might not have signed a national letter of intent with Nevada Reno, but 
he said he signed early (in the fall of his senior year) because he did not 
realize that there was a later deadline for letters of intent. If he had, he 
might have had more offers and gone to another college. 
</P>
<P>
During his freshman year at Nevada Reno, he decided to go to a community 
college back home and started checking out places such as Los Angeles Valley 
and Glendale colleges. Things didn't work out for him at those schools, so he 
took the advice of Todd Deeds, a Nevada Reno linebacker who had played at Santa 
Monica College, and visited the latter school. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett said he "didn't want to play junior college ball for more than one 
year, but I really liked Santa Monica College and Steve Butler," the SMC 
football team's offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he hasn't been surprised at his passing success at SMC. 
</P>
<P>
"You practice, practice and just execute," Barrett said. "Then good things 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
He said he has also been fortunate that he has had a host of good receivers. 
This year the wide receivers include Jason Lucky, Turhon O'Bannon, Napoleon 
Banks and Greg Hooks and tight ends Jeff Williamson and Jermaine O'Bannon, 
Turhon's brother. Lucky, who starred at St. Bernard High, leads the Corsairs 
with 23 catches for 458 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Gasca, the former SMC quarterback who also played at Venice High and Cal State 
Long Beach, has been coaching SMC quarterbacks for two years. He said that he 
has been fortunate in having Barrett for a pupil and that he will deem it an 
honor if Barrett passes him in the record book. 
</P>
<P>
He said the SMC players "tease me about my records' being broken, but it's good 
when a guy like Jeff has something to shoot for and surpasses it. It's an honor 
to be mentioned with him. He is really a good player. He is very smart, and he 
is tough and unselfish." 
</P>
<P>
Gasca, who had a tryout with the L.A. Express of the defunct United States 
Football League, said Barrett's "biggest strength is his understanding of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been around any quarterback who understands the game as well as he 
does," Gasca said. "I think his understanding gains the respect of his 
teammates and brings out the best in them." 
</P>
<P>
Gasca said Barrett also has "excellent receivers, who each could easily catch 
60 or 70 passes this season. But they won't because we spread the ball around 
so much. I think that if Jeff stays healthy, he will break every record they 
have here." 
</P>
<P>
Barrett said all the talk about records misses the point. "I'm not for setting 
records, but for winning games," he said. "I don't think that all a quarterback 
has to do is throw the ball. The quarterback who stands out is the guy who 
completes the pass. There's more to being a quarterback than having a great 
arm." 
</P>
<P>
There's more to Barrett than just wanting to play more football, at a four-year 
school and, perhaps, in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he plans to major in business and specialize in marketing or real 
estate and that he wants to go to a college "where a degree means something." 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take football as far as I can, but I have to think of my education 
first," Barrett said. "If it's possible for me to make it in pro football, that 
will be great. If not, I have to have something to fall back on."

HIT-AND-RUN ACCIDENT SIDELINES TITAN DEFENDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
FULLERTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton cornerback Nuygen Pendleton, victim of a hit-and-run 
accident in the parking lot of a Lakewood restaurant-nightclub last Saturday 
night, will miss the Titans' final five games because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton, a senior, was examined Wednesday by team physician Dr. Joseph 
Cummings, who determined that Pendleton had torn both medial collateral 
ligaments in his left knee. Surgery won't be required, but Pendleton will have 
to wear a brace for about five weeks and then rehabilitate his leg. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton said he had dinner with some friends Saturday at the Red Onion at 
5117 Lakewood Blvd., then remained at the club until about midnight for 
dancing. 
</P>
<P>
On his way out, he said, he met some more friends and was talking with them in 
the parking lot when a car struck his leg. Pendleton said he flipped on top of 
the hood and was thrown to the pavement as the driver sped off. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton said a friend, Vincent Williams, chased the driver in another car. 
According to Michael Fields, a Lakewood Police Department deputy, Williams 
detained the driver about two miles from the restaurant and held him until 
police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, identified as Jeffery Pete, 32, of Cerritos was charged with felony 
drunk driving and felony hit and run. Fields, who is investigating the 
accident, said Pete was driving 15 to 20 m.p.h. at the time of impact. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I got hit, I thought I'd never play football again," said 
Pendleton, the third Titan starter to sustain a season-ending injury and the 
12th to be sidelined for at least a game. "This is so frustrating. Everybody's 
getting injured, and nothing is going well for the team." 
</P>
<P>
There is some question as to what Pendleton was doing there in the first place. 
In the wake of a shooting outside a Fullerton nightclub that involved several 
football players last April, Titan Coach Gene Murphy made his players sign a 
code of conduct that placed nightclubs off-limits. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy wouldn't reveal specifics of the agreement, but Pendleton said it 
pertained only to Orange County nightclubs. Lakewood is in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys have gone to clubs outside the county, in Riverside or Los Angeles," 
Pendleton said. "The coach didn't seem to have a problem with that." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would take disciplinary action against Pendleton, Murphy, who as of 
Wednesday hadn't discussed the incident with him, said, "I don't even want to 
talk about that." 
</P>

Pendleton said he plans to file suit against the driver. He said Saturday night

<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: WITH 1-6 RECORD, PLAYERS ARE LOOKING TO '91. BUT THEY DON'T 
APPEAR TO HAVE LOST THEIR ESPRIT DE CORPS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Explanations for Cal State Fullerton's 1-6 record can easily be found in the 
litany of injuries, turnovers and mistakes that have plagued the Titans this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
But Fullerton defensive back Terry Tramble says that perhaps another factor is 
involved, one that must be attributed to a higher being. 
</P>
<P>
In 13 previous years of organized football, Tramble's teams lost just 17 games: 
three in seven years of Pop Warner, five at Dorsey High School in Los Angeles, 
five at Pasadena City College and four at Fullerton last season. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1990, Tramble already has lost six games, more than a third of his 
previous total. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just telling a friend that maybe from me winning all my life, I'd get to 
my last year and have to experience this," said Tramble, a senior. "Maybe God 
wanted me to feel what it's like to lose." 
</P>
<P>
But, Tramble must wonder, why rub it in? The season began with promise: 
Fullerton opened by beating Sonoma State and played well in losses to Auburn 
and Mississippi State of the mighty Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Then followed the blowout barrage: 48-17 to Akron, 38-3 to Fresno State, 29-10 
to Nevada Las Vegas and last weekend's 67-37 loss to Pacific. A preseason pick 
to finish fourth in the Big West Conference, the Titans (0-3) are last. 
</P>
<P>
And the schedule won't get any easier. Fullerton travels this weekend to 
Hawaii, where it has won once in 10 tries, and then must play improved Cal 
State Long Beach, conference favorite San Jose State, and Utah State, which 
tied Fresno State last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans, whose worst record was 2-9 in 1975, don't play perennial pushover 
New Mexico State (0-6) until the season finale. 
</P>
<P>
For many players from successful high school and community college programs, 
this is their first experience with a prolonged losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like guys don't know what hit them," Tramble said. "We've all 
been winners, and then you walk into something like this. It's hard to accept 
the reality of losing." 
</P>
<P>
As one might expect, team morale has taken a beating. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been here for two weeks, but when I got to practice (Monday) I saw a 
bunch of guys who were just down," said senior linebacker Clarence Siler, who 
is recovering from an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very disappointing. We're out of the (conference) race, and guys feel 
like they're playing for a lost cause. Now, it's more of a pride thing." 
</P>
<P>
Added junior running back Reggie Yarbrough: "You can't expect everyone to be 
smiling around here. The attitude has declined. The season has kind of slipped 
away, and it's aggravating, especially for the seniors." 
</P>
<P>
Offensive tackle Mike Simmons is a case in point. Simmons played for Arizona 
State in 1987 but missed the past two seasons because of a back injury. He 
transferred to Fullerton in August, hoping to salvage his career, but now finds 
himself trying instead to salvage what's left of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to make sense out of what's going on," Simmons said. "It's one of 
those things where you can either throw in the towel completely, count the 
periods until the season's over or try to salvage what we've got left. It's 
going to be interesting to find out how we react." 
</P>
<P>
About the only consolation for the Titans is that few students appear to be 
concerned with whether Fullerton wins or loses. Only 2,013 spectators showed up 
for last Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"Students, they pretty much don't know our team exists anyway," junior 
linebacker Stan Breland said. 
</P>
<P>
Although several players are disheartened, the Titans don't appear to have lost 
their esprit de corps. They say there has been no finger-pointing, no 
dissension. 
</P>
<P>
"We're 1-6, and a lot of guys are ticked off, but we're staying together," 
senior safety Bob Baiz said. "We all like each other. It's not like we're 
fighting each other." 
</P>
<P>
And there have been no sparring sessions with lockers, walls or blackboards, no 
extreme displays of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't torn anything up to anyone's knowledge," Titan Coach Gene Murphy 
said. "Maybe to mine I have. But I'm doing OK. If I didn't, it would be a 
snowball effect on the assistants and the players, so I'd better be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy is concerned with his team's mental health, but he might be even more 
concerned about the Titans who aren't suiting up for games this season -- the 
redshirt players. He hopes those who have seen home games and read 
less-than-glowing newspaper accounts of some road losses don't lose faith. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of season can hurt you in the future depending on the emotional 
stability of your young people," Murphy said. "Something like this can make you 
go belly up, or it can strengthen you." 
</P>
<P>
Several redshirt players said they have actually been fortified by the 
failures. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard anyone talk about quitting -- everyone is expecting big things 
next year," said Victor Prince, a junior from Santa Barbara City College. "This 
motivates me a lot more because everyone puts us down. They say our program is 
no good any more, but we're going to come back strong." 
</P>
<P>
Added Sheldon Butler, a freshman from Banning High: "I don't sense a bad 
attitude from the redshirt guys. We're not too concerned about this season. 
Most redshirt guys are looking forward to next year anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Breland and Siler have also thought about how this season might affect the 
younger players. Breland, who will return next year, is confident his new 
teammates will have a good attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked past the weight room (Monday) and saw a lot of young guys working 
hard, getting ready for next year," Breland said. "I feel everyone is still 
giving a good effort." 
</P>
<P>
Siler won't have another college season to make amends, but he did have some 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
"I've talked to the younger guys and said, 'You see this season? You don't want 
to ever feel like this again, so work real hard next year and don't let down,' 
" he said. "Sometimes it takes a season like this for young guys to come 
around."

COTO DE CAZA RESIDENTS ANGERED BY PLANS TO AUCTION OFF REMAINING HOMES

<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne and Diane Hauser are furious. 
</P>
<P>
It was just seven months ago that they paid $408,000 for their five-bedroom 
home in this gated community in South Orange County. On Sunday, the developer 
plans to auction similar models at a starting bid of about $225,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Hausers don't believe that's fair. Neither do Nina and Mark Peterson, the 
first couple to move into the development -- called Summerfield at Coto -- when 
it opened early this year. 
</P>
<P>
They say they will lose a huge chunk of equity if Summerfield developers -- 
Coast Construction Co. of Brea and Kajima Development Corp. of Monterey Park -- 
sell the remaining 26 homes in the 44-home development at what could be steeply 
reduced prices. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint comes at a time that the Southern California housing market is in 
a serious downdraft. More and more new home builders are turning to auctions as 
a quick way to move blocks of hard-to-sell homes quickly and efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
But such sales tactics carry a price tag. Typically, the developers lose a 
little -- selling at a slight discount to market price -- but recent home 
buyers take big paper losses. Suddenly the price they paid -- and continue to 
pay each month with their mortgage payment -- is above what even the builder 
says it is worth. 
</P>
<P>
While the Hausers and Petersons have good reason to complain, building industry 
specialists say they are victims of circumstance, not of design. The experts 
say the developers must bail themselves out to survive in a down market. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Kajima, the U.S. arm of one of Japan's largest home builders, 
said that the companies, caught by "a rapidly changing market" that resulted in 
a sales slowdown, "felt that an auction would allow us to sell . . . 
efficiently at current market values." The auction, she said, also should 
"produce savings for us" by moving all the homes at once and eliminating 
further carrying and marketing costs. 
</P>
<P>
Nat S. Harty, president of Coast, a Brea developer that specializes in upscale 
homes in Orange and Los Angeles counties, declined comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Selling homes at a steep discount from what the initial buyers paid is a 
developer's nightmare, said Penelope Eaton May, president of the Eaton Group, a 
Laguna Niguel real estate marketing firm. 
</P>
<P>
"But when it comes down to the wire, and they have no more room to play, when 
their lenders won't or can't change the construction loan to accommodate the 
builder, then often the only thing that can be done quickly is an auction," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And that is happening with greater frequency in Southern California as 
developers find traditional sales method simply don't work in a down market. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry is in a typical oversupply situation and auctions are one 
ramification of that," said Steve Johnson, vice president of the Meyers Group, 
a Chino real estate company. "Another is that in the absence of price controls 
there is no guarantee that property values will increase." 
</P>
<P>
The alternative often is to let the bank repossess the homes. "Then the 
existing residents are stuck in a neighborhood with empty homes with boarded-up 
windows and dead lawns, and that can have a more deflating impact on their 
property values than an auction," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hausers and other Summerfield residents say they wouldn't mind if Coast and 
Kajima offered new buyer incentives -- like trips to Europe or luxury cars or 
free landscaping -- to generate sales. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything, as long as they don't lower the prices," said Nina Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
But those kinds of incentives don't work well for homes in the Summerfield 
price range, where the problem is finding buyers with enough cash to make a 
sizable down payment so they can qualify for a $300,000 or larger mortgage 
loan. So lowering prices is often a developer's only out, May said. 
</P>
<P>
"And an auction is just a lot more public way of doing what's been going on for 
months. Builders are talking less money for their products. It's a slow 
market," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But an auction doesn't automatically mean lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not hired to get the minimum," said William Lange, owner of Lange 
Financial Corp. in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Lange, who has conducted real estate auctions throughout the country, said he 
recently got average prices more than double the minimum bids and 4% higher 
than the last posted retail prices on a group of homes in Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
Advertisements for the Summerfield auction say homes will be offered at minimum 
bids as low as $215,000 -- or about 44% of the last posted price for that 
particular model. 
</P>
<P>
Harty met with the 10 Summerfield families last week to try to explain his 
company's position, but the meeting failed to satisfy Nina Peterson and Diane 
Hauser. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said that when she and her husband selected their model, "way back in 
May, 1989, we'd never heard of Coast," Peterson said. "But the sales people 
assured us that with Kajima as a partner, they'd never have financial problems. 
Some developers already were starting to lower prices back then and we asked 
about that, but we were repeatedly assured that Coast would never cut prices. 
We were misled." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson and Hauser each said Harty acknowledged knowing in mid-1989 that the 
residential market was slowing and said they demanded to know why he did not 
lower prices for them at that time. 
</P>
<P>
"Harty didn't answer, but the answer is that back then there were still people 
like us, who were stupid enough to pay those prices," Peterson said.

N.Y. PUBLISHER WINS CONTROL OF GRADCO; STEWART RESIGNS 
</P>

<P>
After a bitterly contested proxy fight, a New York publisher has gained control 
of Gradco Systems Inc., prompting the resignation Wednesday of the office 
equipment company's controversial founder, Keith B. Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Led by its chairman, Martin E. Tash, Plenum Publishing Corp. successfully 
gained three of five seats on Gradco's board after launching a proxy fight that 
culminated in the victory at Gradco's annual meeting on Friday, company 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Bressler, Plenum's corporate secretary, said preliminary results show 
that Gradco shareholders cast 3.5 million shares in favor of Plenum's slate of 
directors, compared to 2.4 million shares voted for Gradco's directors. 
</P>
<P>
Failing to rally enough shareholder support at last week's raucous annual 
meeting, Stewart said he will step down as chairman and chief executive of the 
company he co-founded in 1972, took public in 1983 and built into the world's 
largest independent supplier of office-copier products. 
</P>
<P>
"The last seven years as CEO of a public company (were) rewarding, though under 
the watchful eyes of the shareholders who constantly demanded explanations and 
asked me to work miracles," Stewart said in a statement. "I think I am going to 
enjoy reversing the roles for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, Gradco's largest shareholder, said in an interview that he will remain 
in Orange County, but his future plans are uncertain. He said he will "observe" 
the company for a while and hinted that he may try to regain control of the 
board or acquire the company. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart's resignation followed Plenum's announcement earlier Wednesday that it 
planned to fire the Gradco chairman at a board meeting on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart will remain chairman of the company's Gradco Japan subsidiary, which 
has an independent board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Tash, Bressler and Harland Mischler, a Tash associate who owns a Florida 
investment company, will serve as Plenum's representatives on the Gradco board. 
</P>
<P>
David Harshman, corporate attorney for Gradco, confirmed that a preliminary 
vote count showed that Plenum had three seats on Gradco's board. A final tally 
is expected by today. Harshman said he did not know which Gradco officers would 
remain on the company's board. 
</P>
<P>
Tash, who owns 9.4% of Gradco stock, launched the proxy contest in August after 
filing a lawsuit against Stewart and the Gradco board. Stewart abruptly 
postponed the company's annual meeting on Aug. 31, rescheduling it for last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Tash's suit accused Gradco management of awarding its members warrants to 
purchase stock in the company's Gradco Japan subsidiary for below-market prices 
at the expense of Gradco's other shareholders. The suit alleged that Gradco 
management could have made a windfall of more than $12 million as a result of 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart denied the charges and accused Tash of fighting a "dirty campaign" that 
was costing the company money and endangered the company's plans to take its 
Gradco Japan subsidiary public. 
</P>
<P>
The showdown between Tash and Stewart came at the annual meeting. Both men gave 
speeches to a crowded room of shareholders, with Stewart likening the proxy 
battle to the "Marriott fight night," and Tash proclaiming that he would gain 
control of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not the slightest intent of continuing as CEO of this company if it's 
deemed to be at shareholder expense," Stewart said. "No one here has more to 
gain or lose than me. Your vote here today will ensure the continuation of 
management. . . . Otherwise, all of this can be translated into nothing more 
than a farewell speech." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it was a goodby speech for Stewart, 50, a tall, bearded man with a 
booming voice. A native of the United Kingdom raised in Zimbabwe, he co-founded 
Gradco in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a lawsuit filed in a divorce proceeding, Stewart's former wife 
accused him of failing to inform her of the company's true value shortly before 
it went public at $18 per share. After an Orange County Superior Court judge 
ruled that Stewart had defrauded his wife, she settled out of court for an 
undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
The company found its niche in manufacturing automatic sorters for copier 
machines, eventually winning nearly 70% of the worldwide market. Gradco started 
winning praises for its performance on Wall Street and attracting big-name 
investors such as the Pritzker family of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1989, Gradco reported record earnings of $5.6 million on revenue of 
$115.1 million. But in the past year, as Stewart has put it, the company went 
from "Utopia to the gutter." 
</P>
<P>
Gradco lost $28.1 million on revenue of $89.5 million for its fiscal year ended 
March 31. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart blamed the company's troubles on the loss of its largest customer, 
Xerox Corp., and the failure of a management-led buyout in December, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But angry shareholders expressed their frustration with Stewart's management, 
citing the company's purchase of a Rolls-Royce for Stewart's personal use and 
accusing Gradco of failing to adequately disclose the company's financial 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Stewart said he was leaving Gradco to allow the company to 
return to normal as quickly as possible, saying "it does not serve anybody's 
interest to operate a board which has to show up at board meetings with their 
respective lawyers because of the continuing litigation between the groups." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "The future of (Gradco) is now in the hands of others, but it is 
going to take a dedicated and cooperative effort to save this company and get 
it back on track. Now I can focus on only one major task, and that is to 
concentrate on building back the value of Gradco stock through Gradco Japan."

FUNDAMERICA SALARIES: WHAT PROMISED TO GO UP IS COMING DOWN

<P>
Some FundAmerica Inc. watchers have wondered why Mitchell Blumberg -- 
successful Texas developer and Harvard Business School graduate -- agreed to 
run the financially troubled company starting late this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Documents filed in federal bankruptcy court here this week contain a clue -- 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Blumberg signed an employment contract in August with the Irvine company to 
earn $20,833 a month -- about $250,000 a year. Should FundAmerica emerge from 
bankruptcy, Blumberg gets a $500,000 bonus and begins earning a 1% commission 
on gross sales. 
</P>
<P>
He may even get an 8% stake in FundAmerica if everything goes according to 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Is the compensation consistent with the challenge of this company? It's not 
nearly enough," Blumberg said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica has been charged in Florida with criminal offenses related to 
running a pyramid scheme and its founder, Robert T. Edwards, was arrested. The 
company and Edwards deny the charges. Blumberg joined the company a few weeks 
after Edwards' arrest. 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica, which maintains it is a legitimate multilevel marketing company, 
is currently prohibited from recruiting members. The company filed for Chapter 
11 bankruptcy protection from creditors two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Blumberg isn't the only new FundAmerica executive promised good pay and a 
possible bonus. 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica Chairman Peter Bradshaw is supposed to earn $16,667 a month and 
receive a $400,000 bonus if the company gets back on its feet, according to his 
employment contract. He could receive as much as a 5% stake in the company as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Both men have contracts to serve on the company's board, which entitles them to 
an additional $25,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
But so far, the employment contracts are worth about as much as the paper 
they're written on. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Trustee's office -- which must approve executive salaries for 
companies in bankruptcy -- reduced the monthly take home pay to $11,000 for 
Blumberg and $9,000 for Bradshaw. Worse yet, those salaries were only approved 
for a five-week period that ended Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Blumberg nor Bradshaw -- who refused to discuss his salary -- has 
received a penny since. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly deserve every bit of compensation," Blumberg said.

NEW SATURNS: SMALL CAR, SMALL GLIMPSE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County got its first glimpse of General Motors' much-ballyhooed new 
Saturn cars Wednesday. But they are small cars, and it was a very small 
glimpse. 
</P>
<P>
A truck carrying 11 of GM's American-made import-fighters dropped off just 
three of the cars at Saturn of Santa Ana before continuing its rounds. 
</P>
<P>
They were the first Saturns delivered anywhere in the state, said dealer John 
Campbell, whose lot is the only Saturn franchise in the county and one of just 
30 in the state that will open for business next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny delivery signaled an inauspicious start for the new line. Production 
problems are forcing GM to radically reduce the number of cars dealers will 
have on hand opening day. Campbell says he has been told he'll only get 25, 
down from his original target of 80. 
</P>
<P>
The Saturn line -- two four-door sedans and a coupe -- are priced in the $9,000 
to $13,000 range and are designed to compete with imports like Toyota's 
Corolla.

DEVELOPER SEEKS LENDERS FOR LOW-COST HOUSING PROJECTS

Hoping to fill a gap in construction lending as Southern California's real 
estate market slows, developer Donald H. Williams Jr. is trying to raise money 
to finance construction of low-cost homes. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, of Anaheim Hills, has filed a preliminary prospectus with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission seeking approval to sell 400,000 limited 
partnerships to raise up to $200 million under the name Hill Williams Secured 
Income Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Williams is especially interested in funding affordable homes -- in the range 
of $120,000 to $190,000 -- in San Bernardino and Riverside counties, said David 
Colton, president of Colton Financial Inc. of Newport Beach, whose firm is the 
lead underwriter for the offering. Williams may also invest in other parts of 
California, Colton said. 
</P>
<P>
With real estate prices in the dumps, now may not appear to be the right time 
to invest in home-building. But Colton said there is opportunity for home 
builders even in a slow market. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of developers who would normally be developing cannot finance their 
projects, but that's not because the projects don't make economic sense," 
Colton said. "It's the new regulations on financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The limited partnerships are projected to pay a 12% return on the investment, 
according to the prospectus. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Williams formed Hill Williams Development Corp., which has built 
homes, attached units, office buildings and shopping centers valued at $96 
million, all in California.

DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING FIRM CUTS GROWTH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
American Health Services Corp., a major national operator of medical diagnostic 
imaging centers, said Wednesday it is sharply scaling back its growth plans, 
resulting in a loss for the third quarter ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
E. Larry Atkins, who took over as the Newport Beach-based company's chief 
executive in August, said in a meeting with industry analysts that as a result 
of this move the company will take writedowns of $2.5 million leading to an 
unspecified third-quarter loss. 
</P>
<P>
The writedowns, he said, are related to severance arrangements and the 
termination of projects that no longer meet the company's strategic goals. 
</P>
<P>
Atkins said he wants to slow American Health Services' growth to about 20% a 
year. The company has more than doubled in size in the past 14 months, 
increasing the number of centers it operates to 37 from 18. 
</P>
<P>
Atkins said the company now plans to add eight to 10 new centers in 1991, in 
contrast to its former plan to add 20 centers. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to focus on (increasing) earnings," he explained. "Our after-tax 
earnings haven't been satisfactory to the management or the shareholders. We 
think we can do better if we focus more on operations and less on growth." 
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of 1990, the company had net earnings of $771,000 on 
revenue of $15.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Atkins, who previously was chief operating officer of American Health Services, 
assumed the top executive position Aug. 6 upon the resignation of S. Lewis 
Meyer, who had served six years as chief executive.

CLOTHIER SCRAPS $40-MILLION STOCK SALE; 
</P>
<P>
APPAREL: THE SUNLAND FASHION MANUFACTURER CITES WALL STREET'S SLIDE IN 
CANCELING THE SALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cherokee Inc., citing the stock market's severe slump, said it scrapped plans 
to go public with a $40-million-plus stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was not a surprise. Cherokee, a privately owned Sunland apparel 
maker that specializes in women's sports clothing, had said last month that 
unless the market enjoyed a quick rebound, the company would probably cancel 
its offering. 
</P>
<P>
Many companies, in fact, have been forced to withdraw or postpone initial 
public offerings because of the market's slide. Investors, especially 
institutional investors such as pension funds, are refusing to buy new untested 
issues at a time when even the market's blue chip stocks are taking a pounding. 
</P>
<P>
Cherokee was particularly vulnerable because of the inherent fickleness of the 
fashion business, and the checkered health of the apparel industry's customers, 
the retailers. However, some analysts have said Cherokee's primary customers, 
such as the Mervyn's department-store unit of Dayton Hudson Corp., are in 
relatively good shape. 
</P>
<P>
Some aspects of Cherokee's offering also might have put off some investors. 
Cherokee offered 4 million shares of Class B stock that it expected to sell for 
between $10 and $12 a share, raising between $40 million and $48 million. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Class B shares would have had only a 10th of a vote each, compared 
with the full vote accorded each of Cherokee's Class A shares, which are held 
by Cherokee's current owners and executives. In other words, buyers of the 
Class B stock would have contributed significant equity to Cherokee, but would 
have had very little impact on Cherokee's governance. 
</P>
<P>
Cherokee planned to use the offering's proceeds to whittle down its debt, which 
totaled $171.1 million as of June 2, when its fiscal year ended. (In fiscal 
1990, Cherokee lost $224,000 on sales of $208.6 million; the loss stemmed from 
$28.1 million in debt interest costs.) Now, the company will have to find other 
means of paring the debt. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the debt was incurred last year, when a group led by Cherokee 
executives and investment banker Jeffrey S. Deutschman bought the then-publicly 
held company from its stockholders in a $174-million leveraged buyout. In a 
leveraged buyout, the company is purchased with mostly borrowed money secured 
by the company's assets. 
</P>
<P>
Cherokee had stated in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that 
even without the offering, the company's operations generate enough cash to 
cover Cherokee's debt payments.

HALLOWEEN CREATES COSTUME DRAMA; 
</P>
<P>
FOR MANY ADULTS THE FUN DEPENDS ON SCARING UP THE RIGHT LOOK

Louise Schiffler only needed one more thing to make her Halloween costume 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
"If I don't find the log at Vons, I'll have to check out a lumber yard," 
Schiffler said. "But I'm not worried, there should be one log that fits what 
I'm looking for." 
</P>
<P>
Since June, after watching the offbeat television series "Twin Peaks," the 
32-year-old Garden Grove computer programmer knew exactly what she was going to 
be for Halloween. "The Log Lady is perfect," she said. "It's simple, funny and 
cheap." 
</P>
<P>
Schiffler, who also is busy preparing Halloween costumes for her two children, 
said she considers Halloween her favorite time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I was a kid I loved Halloween," she said. "I loved to dress up and be 
somebody else for a day. It's no different today. In fact, I think I appreciate 
it more than when I was a kid." 
</P>
<P>
While Halloween for the kiddies seems to have been overtaken by the realties of 
a changing world with many parents opting to keep their children at home during 
its celebration, for many adults, the spirit of Halloween is very much alive. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this: 
</P>
<P>
According to Hallmark Cards Inc.'s recent market survey, an estimated $400 
million will be spent by nearly 50 million Americans on Halloween costumes and 
party goods this year. Of that, adults will constitute about $100 million in 
sales. In addition, the survey found that for many adults, the right costume is 
the single most important key to enjoying Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last three years, we have found a definite increase of adults who dress 
up for Halloween," said Sherry Timbrook, spokeswoman for Kansas City-based 
Hallmark, noting that about one in four adults dress up for Halloween in 
America. "It's the second most popular celebration for adults. It's right 
behind New Year's Eve and ahead of Valentine's Day and St. Patrick's Day." 
</P>
<P>
At Gasoline Alley in Orange -- a small costume and clothing boutique that 
specializes in vintage clothes from the 1960s and 1970s -- owner Dawna Saucedo 
said costume sales and rentals started picking up in the late summer. "I really 
thought the economy would put a dent in business this year," Saucedo said. "So 
much for my worries. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that Halloween is becoming more popular for adults," 
Saucedo said. "With all the stresses and worries of today's world, more than 
ever, adults need a time to unwind and be someone else." 
</P>
<P>
Costume prices at Gasoline Alley run from a low of about $22 for a Peter Pan 
outfit to a high of $150 for a gorilla suit. In most cases, though, Saucedo 
said customers are not spending more than $50. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional costumes like clowns, flappers and vampires continue to remain 
popular among adults, but Saucedo said in the last few years, she has noticed 
that more and more people are willing to experiment with their costume designs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing a lot of Hippies this year," Saucedo said, adding that the 1970 
polyester look is also popular among the costume searchers who visit her store. 
"But we're also doing a lot of Bart Simpson ('The Simpsons'), Al Bundy 
('Married . . . With Children') and Dick Tracy." 
</P>
<P>
Halloween dates back 2,500 years to Druid festivals. Costume parties and 
trick-or-treating customs were brought to the United States by Irish settlers 
in the 1840s, according to Hallmark card researchers. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Gislason, a psychiatrist at UC Irvine, said Halloween can serve many 
functions for adults, including a healthy way of "cleansing the soul" from the 
day in and day out frustrations of everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, we all have multiple personalities," Gislason said. "Halloween 
offers an easy way for adults to become another personality for the day. At the 
same time it's affording a temporary escape from the realities of the everyday 
world." 
</P>
<P>
Halloween costumes can also serve as symbolic statements for some adults, 
Gislason said. For example, a law enforcement officer may dress up like a super 
hero. Or, a housewife or professional woman may dress like a dance hall girl. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a safe way to let loose," Gislason said. "People can either be good, bad 
or funny." 
</P>
<P>
During the year, Sherri Fraizer is an assistant corporate secretary at Pacific 
Mutual in Newport Beach. But on Halloween, the 27-year-old Long Beach resident 
throws her life out the window and turns into whatever she wants. 
</P>
<P>
"I love Halloween," said Fraizer, who is the mother of a 2-year-old girl and is 
expecting her second child in November. "I would never consider not dressing up 
for the occasion. I enjoy it and my husband enjoys it." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Mutual allows its 1,700 employees to come to work dressed in costume. 
"It's been a longstanding tradition with this company," said Andrew Morrison, 
senior vice president of the company. "Not everybody chooses to dress up, but 
we do get our fair share." 
</P>
<P>
Because of her pregnancy, Fraizer said, her options for a costume are minimal. 
Nevertheless, she plans to dress up as a bride. If that somehow doesn't work, 
she said she has two other costumes. 
</P>
<P>
"These days, our lives are so busy, we tend to forget to have fun. And that's 
what Halloween is all about -- fun," she added. "Besides, I believe we all get 
a chance to see the real side of some people." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Anaheim Hilton was built six years ago, it has had a Halloween party. 
This year, the hotel plans to celebrate the occasion in the hotel's nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
"I think as the economy slows down and the chances of a Middle East 
confrontation increase, Halloween becomes more important to adults," said 
Patrick Hines, director of public relations for the hotel. "When people dress 
up, they can escape for a while and have some fun." 
</P>
<P>
In the six years that the hotel has been staging Halloween parties, Hines said 
adults appear to enjoy the celebration more and more. 
</P>
<P>
"You can tell that people really get into the spirit of Halloween," Hines said. 
"When we first started doing this, most of the costumes seemed to be the same 
-- monsters and Playboy Bunnies. But in the last couple of years, people are 
getting more creative and witty with their costumes. And they seem to love to 
show them off." 
</P>
<P>
Unique Costumes in Fullerton has been renting and selling costumes for 30 
years. Since late September, the store has been open 11 hours a day, seven days 
a week. Laura VanRiper, part owner of the shop since 1978, said in the next two 
weeks, the shop will be like a zoo. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mostly adults that come in here," she said, noting that costumes 
depicting Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Roaring '20s and Arabs seem to be 
big this year. "Some know exactly what they want, others are not sure." 
</P>
<P>
However, no matter what state of preparedness customers are in, VanRiper said 
most of the people who come in all seem to have one thing in common. "They're 
excited about finding a costume. You can see how fun it is for them in their 
eyes." 
</P>
<P>
VanRiper said that during the last few days before Halloween -- when most of 
the store's items have been picked clean by customers -- store clerks have as 
much fun as the customers as they try to piece together costumes from the 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be pretty crazy around here toward the end of October," Van Riper said. 
"The clerks are running around, grabbing things. . . . Customers frantic for a 
costume. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Belson, 29, a truck driver for Roadway Express in Los Angeles, has been 
thinking about his Halloween costume since last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be Jim Morrison of the Doors," Belson said. "I've found almost 
everything I need. All that's missing is a wig." 
</P>
<P>
The Cypress truck driver doesn't care that his physique doesn't resemble the 
late singer's: "I know I don't look like Morrison. But hell, it'll be lots of 
fun. I'll be walking around with a mike in my hand singing, 'Light My Fire.' " 
</P>
<P>
Belson said he plans to attend Halloween parties between now and the end of the 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like going on stage," Belson said. "Once a week, sometimes twice a week, 
I get in costume and the show begins."

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: FICTION AS STRANGE AS TRUTH FROM A LOCAL EX-REPORTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All those years working as a newspaper reporter have paid off for Brea author 
Jackie Hyman. 
</P>
<P>
The heroine of Hyman's new Orange County-set suspense-thriller "Echoes" is 
Laura Bennett, a young reporter who, in investigating the sudden death of a 
U.S. senator, begins to uncover unexplained phenomena that link his death with 
other strange events. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some unusual and sinister things are happening in San Paradiso, Hyman's 
fictional Orange County town. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor was the last person to see three local women before each was brutally 
murdered. But he knows he didn't kill them -- at least he doesn't remember 
killing them. 
</P>
<P>
The senator's wife, a former B-movie actress, receives an anonymous package 
containing a photo of herself at an orgy she had fantasized about. But she 
knows it never really happened. 
</P>
<P>
And Bennett, who is haunted by childhood memories of her father's plunge into 
madness, discovers that her lover, a judge, is not acting like himself. 
</P>
<P>
Hyman's publisher, Morrow, is promoting "Echoes" as "a slam-bang supernatural 
thriller skillfully combining elements of 'The Omen' and 'Invasion of the Body 
Snatchers.' . . . What unfolds is a waking nightmare, as a plague of demonic 
duplicates turns Orange County red with blood in a tidal wave of murder, rape 
and blackmail." 
</P>
<P>
Hyman, who quit newspaper work in 1983 to devote full time to writing fiction, 
has written 23 romance novels under such various pen names as Jacqueline 
Diamond, Jacqueline Topaz and Jacqueline Jade. 
</P>
<P>
"Echoes" is her second thriller under her own name. (Her first was "The Eyes of 
a Stranger," also set in Orange County.) 
</P>
<P>
"I've enjoyed the romances, and I think I've done a good job on them," she 
said. "I'd never slight them, but I do like to be able to try different things 
and not hold back and restrict my thinking." 
</P>
<P>
In creating the young reporter in "Echoes," Hyman tapped into her six years as 
a reporter with the Orange Coast Daily Pilot in Costa Mesa and three years with 
the Associated Press in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I used my reporting experience both in the actual setting and the details of 
how the news is gathered, and also the feeling you get as a reporter on how the 
community functions," she said. "A reporter on a fairly small paper who has a 
small city as her beat has an incredible range (of experiences) and is an 
amazing resource person." 
</P>
<P>
As for newspaper work being good preparation for writing novels, Hyman said: "I 
think the writing (experience) is good. But it can handicap you in that your 
style may tend to be very terse. On the other hand, you get used to writing to 
deadline and not giving into writer's block." 
</P>
<P>
Although much of "Echoes" occurs in Newport Beach, Hyman chose to create a 
fictional town for the main action to avoid the potential of libeling someone 
or having to worry about the irrelevant details about how a town actually 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
She nevertheless wanted San Paradiso to be as realistically "normal" as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things I don't like about a lot of horror novels is they take place 
where you'd never actually go -- where the mayor looks like Burgess Meredith 
and the real estate agent looks like Boris Karloff -- and if you did go there 
you'd leave. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to write something really frightening. To me the most frightening 
thing would be to live in this perfectly normal place and these strange things 
start happening, and you realize there is no escape. 
</P>

HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: GROUP SEEKS TO COMBAT GAY SUICIDE

<P>
Blaming ultraconservatives for fostering an anti-gay climate that can 
contribute to suicide, Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays recently 
started a national education program to combat a newly acknowledged crisis of 
gay and lesbian youth suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Some studies estimate that gay youngsters are three times as likely as non-gays 
to attempt suicide and that they account for about 30% of the 5,000 youth 
suicides each year, according to Paulette Goodman, president of the 
Washington-based group, which held its annual convention last week at the Hyatt 
Regency Alicante in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"People who express themselves like (anti-gay minister) Lou Sheldon don't 
appreciate that children are killing themselves day after day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Sheldon, president of the Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition, and 
Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) prevailed upon Louis W. Sullivan, 
secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to repudiate a 
January, 1990, government report that contained the gay suicide statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman estimated that one family in four is touched by homosexuality. But 
often, she said, parents learn of their child's homosexual orientation only 
after a suicide attempt. Others may never reveal their sexual preferences out 
of shame and fear. 
</P>
<P>
The three-phase national project "Respect All Youth" will develop informational 
materials designed to: 
</P>
<P>
* Increase awareness of issues that may lead young people to suicide. 
</P>
<P>
* Provide a systematic outreach to leaders of national youth organizations, 
including Boy and Girl Scouts and the 4-H, as well as religious groups and 
other professionals. 
</P>
<P>
* Provide training for the 200 chapters of PFLAG to help them reach youth and 
teachers in the local community.

WHAT TO DO WHEN HEALTH INSURER WON'T PAY; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE: A FORMER INDUSTRY INSIDER SAYS THAT INCORRECT PAYMENT AND CLAIM 
DENIALS ARE BECOMING MORE COMMON AND ADVISES THE CLIENT TO CHALLENGE THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
You've seen plenty of newspaper headlines about skyrocketing medical costs. In 
1988, for example, the U.S. health-care bill was more than $500 billion. 
Federal, state and local governments paid $228 billion of that, and private 
insurance companies coughed up another $175 billion. 
</P>
<P>
However, this left $97 billion in health costs that were paid directly by you, 
the American consumer -- an average of about $500 per person, over and above 
insurance premium payments. 
</P>
<P>
Sound steep? The real significance of these numbers hits home when you've run 
up against a major medical expense and your insurance company refuses to pay. 
</P>
<P>
You may have thought your health insurance would cover your claim, only to find 
out that it didn't after you filed. Or maybe your insurer ruled that a test 
done when you were hospitalized was "medically unnecessary" and refused to 
reimburse you. 
</P>
<P>
As a former insurance-industry insider who has reviewed claims for both private 
insurers and Medicare, I'll let you in on a secret: Incorrect payments or claim 
denials are becoming increasingly common, and there's a good chance you're 
entitled to a bigger reimbursement. You have little to lose by questioning a 
benefit payment, and you can gain a lot. But don't waste time: Many policies 
have time limits on appeals -- often six to 12 months -- and the disputed 
amount must be over $100. 
</P>
<P>
Quite often, claims are denied or underpaid simply because somebody made a 
mistake. That's what happened to Henrietta Weber of Albuquerque, N.M., when she 
submitted a claim to Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
Weber's doctor told her she needed to have cysts removed from her jaw. The bill 
for the surgery came to about $500. Weber promptly filled out the insurance 
form, attached the surgeon's bill, sent it to Medicare and waited to be 
reimbursed. 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks later she received a check -- for $12. It came with a statement 
known as the Explanation of Benefits form, or EOB, which outlines the insurer's 
reimbursement. This form can often provide the tip-off that an error was made 
in processing your claim. 
</P>
<P>
After recovering from the shock of her $12 reimbursement, Weber read her EOB 
carefully. It justified the paltry payment by stating that Medicare doesn't 
cover treatment of teeth and gums. Weber realized that Medicare goofed: Jaw 
surgery is clearly different from teeth and gum treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Weber's experience points to an all-too-common problem: miscoding, either by 
the insurance company's data processors or the doctor and his staff. Every 
medical treatment has a corresponding numerical code, which is filled in by the 
doctor. The wrong codes translate into incorrect reimbursements. Unfortunately, 
the vast majority aren't detected unless people like Henrietta Weber complain. 
</P>
<P>
Once again the EOB can be your ally. Take a close look at the EOB's 
"description of service" column. Services you know were performed by your 
doctor may not have been included. Or complicated surgery may be listed as a 
minor procedure, which can then result in a skimpy reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
Errors are an obvious reason for appealing insurance reimbursements, but 
they're not the only one. You can also challenge your insurance company's 
judgment and fairness in deciding the allowable costs of medical services. Two 
common areas of contention are utilization review and doctors' fees. 
</P>
<P>
Utilization review (UR) is a benign-sounding cost-containment measure that 
disallows claims the insurance company deems medically unnecessary. Not 
surprisingly, the UR's main purpose is to save the insurer money, especially 
hospital costs. An insurance company's health-care professionals draw up 
guidelines that define "reasonable and customary" care for virtually every 
illness and injury. 
</P>
<P>
Don't hesitate to challenge an insurance company's UR decisions. A test or 
procedure the insurance company decides is unnecessary may well have been 
necessary in your particular case. 
</P>
<P>
You can also appeal decisions regarding your doctor's fees. Often, the amount 
the doctor charged is more than the amount the insurer will reimburse you. An 
insurance company calculates what's reasonable and customary based on what it 
generally pays for the same procedure in your geographic area. Here again, the 
company may have made an incorrect decision in your case, and you may stand to 
gain by appealing the reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
The first step in an insurance appeal is to notify the insurance company that 
you are dissatisfied with your reimbursement. You may also have other local 
options: Some community medical associations offer non-binding arbitration on 
insurance disputes over physicians' fees; and local Better Business Bureaus 
sometimes handle insurance complaints as well. If you have questions, call the 
National Insurance Consumer Hotline at (800) 942-4242. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, too, your documents are the keys to a successful appeal. Make copies 
of everything, including correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
When Weber realized Medicare had awarded her only $12 for jaw surgery, she 
gathered up her surgeon's bill and the EOB and made a personal visit to her 
local Medicare office. She explained the apparent error to a person in the 
customer-service department. Medicare agreed with her and sent her a check for 
an additional $325.

HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS ARE URGED TO GO FOR FLU SHOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The risk of influenza leading to a fatal case of pneumonia, especially among 
older people, can be significantly decreased by the flu vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
"Prevention is of utmost importance for people over 65, and those with lung 
disease and other illnesses," said Dr. Joseph Lowy, a lung specialist at New 
York University Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone in these high-risk groups should get a flu shot before peak flu 
season, which runs from October through March, he urged. 
</P>
<P>
"For young and healthy people, neither flu nor pneumonia are life-threatening," 
Lowy said. "For older, ill and immune-compromised people, pneumonia is a common 
and dangerous complication of flu." 
</P>
<P>
Pneumonia is the most common cause of death from infections and the 
sixth-leading cause of death in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 people died in each of the 19 flu epidemics from 1957 to 1986. 
In several, the number was as high as 40,000. Nearly 90% of those who died were 
over 65. 
</P>
<P>
The vaccine, made from killed virus, is reformulated every year to make it 
likelier to be effective against that year's prevailing viruses. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a vaccine against pneumococcus, the pneumonia-causing bacteria 
that commonly affect older people. One inoculation gives lifelong protection. 
</P>
<P>
Lowy explained that pneumonia is a general term to describe an infection of the 
lung caused by one of several agents, bacteria and viruses the most common. 
</P>
<P>
The influenza virus can cause viral pneumonia or it can lower a person's 
resistance to subsequent bacterial infection. 
</P>
<P>
Bacteria and viruses are introduced into the lungs constantly, but most people 
can usually fight them off. An older or ill person is less able to clear the 
lungs of microbes. 
</P>
<P>
Lowy recommends that medical attention be sought if these symptoms persist for 
more than a few days.

NPR JOURNALIST SIMON 'PARACHUTES IN' FOR SAN DIEGO STORY; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIA: THE POPULAR NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO FIGURE MAKES BRIEF SAN DIEGO STOP FOR 
A STORY ON THE BORDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Simon was handling the drudgery of a luncheon with the media rather well, 
considering he was operating on almost no sleep after a night along the border 
developing a story for "Weekend Edition," the Saturday morning program he hosts 
for National Public Radio. 
</P>
<P>
"The trick is not staying up all night -- black coffee can take care of that -- 
it is knowing what you're doing," said Simon, taking a gentle stab at himself 
for banging his knee against a highway divider during the previous night's 
adventures. 
</P>
<P>
Simon's literate, stylish features have given him "almost a cult following 
among the Saturday morning leisure set," according to the Christian Science 
Monitor. The weekly audience for the 5-year-old "Weekend Edition" has grown to 
more than a million, according to industry estimates. 
</P>
<P>
The Monday luncheon with four members of the local press, designed to promote 
the 30th anniversary of KPBS-FM (89.5), was part of a whirlwind tour of San 
Diego for the 38-year-old journalist. 
</P>
<P>
After lunch, it was off to the KPBS studios for an interview. Then he traded 
his wrinkled shirt for a double-breasted suit and acted as the guest of honor 
at a ceremony commemorating the anniversary of KPBS, the local public 
broadcasting affiliate. His duties included posing for pictures, shovel in 
hand, planting a tree and making small talk at a cocktail reception. 
</P>
<P>
After the handshaking session, it was back to the border to try to collect more 
material for his story -- "a look at the the extraordinary society that springs 
out of the countryside every night" -- before returning to Washington to help 
put together Saturday's program. 
</P>
<P>
Simon sounded almost embarrassed to, as he put it, "parachute in" to San Diego 
to report on a story that is well covered here. It is part of the job he 
regrets, the inability to spend time in an area, to really soak up the 
atmosphere. He is in a new part of the world almost every week. 
</P>
<P>
"When you parachute in, your own ignorance is a real factor, you do the best 
you can," he said between bites of salad. But there are advantages. "In many 
ways, journalism is most effective when you are a stranger, when you adopt that 
viewpoint." 
</P>
<P>
The border story has always intrigued Simon, who spent many years covering the 
turmoil in Central America. In the past, he has done reports from along the 
border in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an important story that raises questions about our national identity," 
Simon said, looking the person asking the question square in the eyes, while 
his hands played with the sugar dispenser on the table. 
</P>
<P>
As he often does, he was able to find "puckish" elements in the people seeking 
a new life across the border. Humor, irreverence and a general uplifting tone 
are common elements of his work, perhaps reflecting the influence of his 
parents, comedian Ernie Simon and actress Patricia Lyons. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't prepared for the extraordinary wit of some of the people" along the 
border, Simon said. "One man said he just wanted to see Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
But the trip to San Diego was dictated by the invitation to participate in the 
KPBS anniversary activities as much as any story ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Twice a year, Simon travels to public broadcasting affiliates, usually during 
fund-raising efforts. NPR is becoming more dependent on affiliates for 
financial input, which creates more of a symbiotic relationship between the 
network and the affiliates, which want to be more involved in the NPR decision 
making process. 
</P>
<P>
"Our dues are becoming very expensive, while there are more possibilities for 
programming available to the stations," Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't bother Simon as much as NPR's growing reliance on financing from 
corporations and foundations. It doesn't create anything as overt as influence 
on news stories, but the involvement of corporations does encourage a 
"blockbuster mentality," he said, a need to do big, exciting, high-profile 
stories so the sponsor feels it's getting something for it's money. 
</P>
<P>
"We had plenty of money to cover the unraveling of communism in Europe," Simon 
said. "But when we wanted to do something on health care in Harlem, there was 
no money available." 
</P>
<P>
If it wasn't for NPR, Simon says he wouldn't be in radio. 
</P>
<P>
"NPR is the kind of journalism I always wanted to do -- vivid, narrative and, 
when appropriate, stories with a literary bent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If he wasn't in radio, Simon believes he probably would be pursuing a religious 
vocation. As many of his listeners know, he's a Quaker, a "member of the 
Society of Friends," although he was raised Roman Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
His religious beliefs rarely intrude on his stories, he said. But there is no 
separating his roots, who he is, from his role as journalist. 
</P>
<P>
"My instinctive reaction to stories is as someone who grew up in Chicago. That 
stays," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His human side often emerges in his reporting. More than a reflection of his 
own beliefs, he feels it simply raises questions that all journalists should be 
asking on stories. 
</P>
<P>
The example that emerges is coverage of the current Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense reporters over there are infatuated with technology," Simon said. 
"They leave some of the important, intrinsic moral questions behind. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not enough skepticism. The question needs to be asked, how many 
civilians are they willing to kill?" 
</P>
<P>
Simon has covered wars in El Salvador, Grenada and the Middle East. He believes 
reporters have a duty to make their audience understand the realities of war. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people understand what conventional war is anymore," Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
Simon has been with NPR for 13 years, earning two prestigious George F. Peabody 
awards for his radio essays. As an interviewer, he is often compared to Ted 
Koppel, while his easy-going descriptive style, reflecting his mid-eastern 
roots, reminds some of Garrison Keilor. 
</P>
<P>
"Weekend Edition" has been on the air for five years, and, along with "All 
Things Considered" and "Morning Edition," it has become a staple of NPR's 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we understand . . . people respond to parable, the narrative 
technique," Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
Simon's topics for his radio essays range from the homey to the bizarre; his 
guests from the boy-next-door to world leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes there are hilarious swings in subjects," he said. His favorite was 
segueing from a dog that played the piano to an interview with Ariel Sharon. 
Killing time between the two segments, he thought he made an embarrassing 
mistake, telling Sharon he was following the piano-playing dog. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Sharon was amused. Simon imitated Sharon's reaction: "A dog played 
piano? I'd like to see this."

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Funding the Arts 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 175 to 249, the House rejected a conservative-sponsored crackdown 
on National Endowment for the Arts funding of sexually explicit artworks. The 
House later passed legislation (HR 4825) authorizing $175 million in fiscal 
1991 for the endowment. The bill increased federal scrutiny of artists 
receiving public money but left questions of obscenity to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
The rejected amendment sought, in part, to deny funding of projects that depict 
sexual conduct such as masturbation and sadomasochistic abuse or that tear down 
a religion. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach) said: "When it comes to federal tax 
dollars, we have a right to set a standard. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Peter H. Kostmayer (D-Pa.) said: "This amendment is brought to you by 
the book burners in the country and in the Congress." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to keep taxpayers' money from funding sexually explicit art.

To Uphold Textile Veto 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 275 to 152, the House fell short of the two-thirds majority needed 
to overturn President Bush's veto of a bill limiting the growth of textile and 
apparel imports to 1% annually. The measure (HR 4328) also sought to freeze 
non-rubber footwear imports at 1989 levels. Canada and Israel would be exempted 
from the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters said the bill would protect jobs and factories against unfair 
foreign competition, while opponents said it would mask industry inefficiencies 
and raise retail prices. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to protect the domestic textile, apparel and non-rubber footwear 
industries.

A shooting rampage in a fast-food restaurant, a nearby grocery store and a taxi 
left two people dead and two others seriously wounded, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney G. Marks, 34, of Berkeley was arrested about 12:30 a.m. today, hours 
after four people were shot in three separate incidents by apparently the same 
man, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Oakland police, a man walked into a Taco Bell restaurant Wednesday 
night and shot the cashier, who was reported in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, a man believed to be the same gunman entered the Gourmet 
Market about two blocks from the restaurant, where he shot two men, one of whom 
later died. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the shootings in Oakland, a Yellow Cab driver who had been shot 
in the face stopped at a fast-food restaurant in nearby Alameda, where 
employees called for help. He died half an hour later, police said. He picked 
up his last fare near the Oakland market.

SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS WILL RISE 5.4% IN 1991

<P>
The nation's 40 million Social Security recipients will see their benefit 
checks increase by 5.4% starting in January, the biggest advance in 8 1/2 
years, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
That increase will translate into an extra $31 per month for the average 
retired worker, whose monthly check will increase from $571 to $602. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum monthly benefit for a worker retiring in 1991 at age 65 will rise 
by $47, to $1,022. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1975, benefits have risen automatically each year, keeping pace with the 
annual inflation rate with the exception of six months in 1983 that were 
skipped to help bail the Social Security system out of a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The exact size of the 1991 increase became official today when the Labor 
Department announced September's 0.8% increase in the Consumer Price Index, the 
inflation measure used to determine cost-of-living increases for the Social 
Security program. 
</P>
<P>
The 5.4% increase, which will show up in the Jan. 3 benefit checks, followed a 
4.7% increase that took effect last January and a 4% increase in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
It was the largest increase since a 7.4% jump in July, 1982, when high 
inflation rates translated into bigger cost-of-living increases. 
</P>
<P>
The 5.4% increase in 1991 also applies to the nation's 4.5 million recipients 
of Supplemental Security Income, which provides a minimum income floor for poor 
people who are aged, blind or disabled. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum federal SSI payment will rise by $21, to $407 per month, for an 
individual and by $31, to $610, for a couple. 
</P>
<P>
The government also said today that the maximum wage subject to the payroll tax 
that finances Social Security benefits will climb from $51,300 to $53,400 next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
That change will boost taxes for about 10 million higher-income workers who 
earn above the current wage cap. 
</P>
<P>
The tax rate of 7.65%, which finances both the Social Security and Medicare 
programs, would remain unchanged next year.

<P>
A Newhall woman who was burning her husband's clothing in a barbecue after an 
argument set fire to herself and her house early today, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Sue Dittman, 32, was in critical condition at County-USC Medical Center 
after the 1:30 a.m. fire in the 24000 block of Chestnut Street, Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Sgt. Tom Davidheiser said. 
</P>
<P>
Damage to the house was estimated at $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
Dittman told county firefighters that she had argued with her husband, whom she 
is divorcing, and decided to burn his clothes, officials said. She took an 
armful of clothes to a front porch barbecue and used lighter fluid to ignite 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The fire flashed and Dittman ran out to the street, her clothing on fire. The 
fire from the barbecue ignited the porch overhang and nearby boxes and quickly 
spread to the house. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, whose name was not released, was not home at the time of the fire. 
A neighbor who saw Dittman in the street called the Fire Department. She was 
taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital and later transferred to the burn 
unit at County-USC Medical Center.

Roxanne Pulitzer, who parlayed her lurid 1982 divorce into a career as a 
novelist, apparently has landed in the middle of another breakup. 
</P>
<P>
This time, she has been accused of cavorting with a 27-year-old race car driver 
who two weeks ago filed for divorce from his wife of five years, the Palm Beach 
Post reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Pulitzer, 39, and the French-born driver, Jean de la Moussaye, who traces his 
lineage back to Louis XIV and calls himself "Count," won't say whether they had 
an affair. But they have made a business relationship public. 
</P>
<P>
De la Moussaye advertised Pulitzer's new novel, "Twins," on the front of his 
car last month in the Tampa Grand Prix. She promoted him on radio and 
television. 
</P>
<P>
"Business indeed," said De la Moussaye's wife, Francine. "Monkey business."

2 GORBACHEV AIDES FEAR SHOCK TO SOVIET ECONOMY

<P>
Two leading economic advisers to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned today 
that the Soviet leader's plan for introducing a market economy would cause 
severe inflation and unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
Abel Aganbegyan told Soviet lawmakers in a one-hour report that preliminary 
steps toward a market system have already created an "inflationary spiral," 
particularly for prices of meat and dairy products. 
</P>
<P>
He warned that hyper-inflation is likely despite measures in the Gorbachev plan 
designed to combat runaway prices, such as restricting the nation's money 
supply and retaining state price controls on some items. 
</P>
<P>
Aganbegyan and another economist, Oleg Bogomolov, spoke to a meeting of several 
committees of the Supreme Soviet legislature before a full legislative session 
Friday, when Gorbachev is to formally present and defend his plan. 
</P>
<P>
Bogomolov said the Gorbachev plan fails to identify potential victims of the 
transformation. He also said it should have established that no Soviet 
citizen's standard of living would be allowed to drop more than 25%. 
</P>
<P>
Bogomolov predicted that the reforms are likely to halve the value of the ruble 
and force people to dip into their savings. Soviets have an estimated 500 
billion rubles in savings because many necessities are subsidized by the state 
and few consumer goods are available. 
</P>
<P>
Both economists said the success of the Gorbachev plan hinged on cooperation 
from the 15 Soviet republics. The largest, Russia, has already rejected it and 
renewed threats to implement its own more radical program. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's main political rival, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, has 
called the plan a "catastrophe" and said it would fail within months. 
</P>
<P>
But Aganbegyan said during a question-and-answer session with lawmakers that 
Yeltsin was criticizing Gorbachev's politics rather than his economics. 
</P>
<P>
"He made a political speech and would have spoken this way regardless of what 
we had proposed," said Aganbegyan, who headed a 24-member commission that 
drafted one of the many economic reform plans considered by Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
The commission was appointed after the government's first proposals caused 
panic buying last spring and had to be scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
Aganbegyan also said Yeltsin's predictions could cause political instability 
resulting in millions of rubles of losses. 
</P>
<P>
He did not specify how that might happen. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has set no timetable for his reforms but states other countries have 
achieved similar economic reforms within 18 months to two years.

HOUSE HITS CHINA WITH NEW TARIFFS;

TRADE: MEMBERS VOTE TO PUNISH BEIJING FOR LAST YEAR'S CRACKDOWN ON DEMOCRACY,

<P>
The House voted today to punish China for crushing its pro-democracy movement 
last year by raising tariffs on Chinese clothing, toys and shoes by hundreds of 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Then, anticipating a certain veto from President Bush, the House also prepared 
to approve a backup, contradictory measure that would condition continuing open 
trade with China upon improvements in human rights. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, a former envoy to China, has indicated, however, that he is prepared to 
veto both, particularly if the milder version is amended later today to require 
the release of all protesters arrested after the military suppressed the 
student-led Tian An Men Square democracy movement in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed several sanctions against China for what the State 
Department estimates as "several hundred and possibly thousands" of deaths of 
students and others in the military crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush decided in May to continue for another year the lower tariffs that 
China has enjoyed as a "most-favored nation" since 1980. Raising them, he said, 
"would only hurt the Chinese people themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution disapproving Bush's continuation of the lower tariffs was 
approved on a vote of 247 to 174. It now goes to the Senate, where Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), has introduced a similar measure. 
</P>
<P>
Under a new trade law enacted in August, overturning Bush's decision requires a 
majority vote of both the House and Senate before Saturday.

<P>
President Frederik W. de Klerk today lifted the state of emergency in 
violence-torn Natal province, meeting a key demand that had slowed peace talks 
with the African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"The state of emergency has now been completely lifted," De Klerk told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"There is only one route to peace and reconciliation -- that is through 
peaceful negotiation." He said the door to negotiations "is now fully open and 
I am appealing to all leaders and all South Africans to accept the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
The ANC welcomed the move. It has long demanded the emergency be lifted as a 
condition for full-scale negotiations on black-white power sharing and ending 
apartheid. A power struggle there between the ANC and the conservative Inkatha 
movement has claimed 5,000 lives since 1986.

The "tabloid TV" notoriety of a former Playboy bunny waitress and policewoman 
convicted of murdering her former husband's ex-wife helped lead to her capture 
three months after she escaped from prison. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrencia (Bambi) Bembenek, 31, was arrested at an apartment in Thunder Bay, 
Ontario, on Wednesday on a tip from a California viewer of last week's episode 
of "America's Most Wanted" who said she had waited on him. 
</P>
<P>
Bembenek, who has steadfastly professed her innocence, was captured with her 
fiance, Dominic Gugliatto, 34. 
</P>
<P>
Her flight had thrilled supporters in Milwaukee -- prompting sales of T-shirts 
that read, "Run, Bambi, Run" -- and was covered on several TV shows, which 
played up the romantic elements of the escape. 
</P>
<P>
Bembenek supporters say she may have been the victim of a frame-up over her 
knowledge of questionable police activities.

A projection of a major earthquake in the Midwest in early December is about as 
reliable as a random guess, a group of scientists said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Such a projection, especially at the predicted 50-50 chance level, implies a 
level of detailed knowledge . . . that simply does not exist for the New Madrid 
or any other fault zone in the world," the group said in its report. 
</P>
<P>
The 11 scientists were brought together from universities and governmental 
agencies to evaluate the scientific validity of Iben Browning's projection of a 
50% chance of a big quake hitting the New Madrid Fault about Dec. 3.

IRAQ OFFERS CHEAP OIL IN BID TO WOO BUYERS

<P>
Its oil exports frozen by a U.N. embargo, Iraq today tried to woo customers by 
offering cheap oil and pledging not to touch the money until the Persian Gulf 
crisis is over. 
</P>
<P>
Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim Chalabi, in a statement carried by the official 
news agency INA, said Iraq would sell its oil to any buyer at $21 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq is fully prepared to sell its oil to states and companies who want to 
buy, including the United States . . . and the selling price will be on the 
basis of $21 in line with OPEC's decision," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But Chalabi said Iraq did not seek immediate access to the money. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement appeared to be a sign that Iraq was feeling the pinch of the 
U.N.-ordered embargo on trade, which is being enforced by a naval blockade, and 
seeking to entice nations into abandoning the alliance arrayed against it. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq already has offered to give oil free of charge to Third World countries, 
but there have been no reports of any takers. 
</P>
<P>
OPEC set the $21-a-barrel price at its last meeting before the Aug. 2 Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait. Since then oil prices have soared. 
</P>
<P>
Chalabi said President Saddam Hussein had ordered the offer of oil at $21 "in 
view of his appreciation of Iraq's humanitarian responsibility and role in all 
circumstances toward humanity and the international community." 
</P>
<P>
When the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last fixed its oil 
price, $21 represented a $3-a-barrel increase and the rise was seen as success 
for Iraqi efforts to drive up prices in a sluggish market. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the invasion of Kuwait has pushed oil prices to more than $40 a 
barrel at times, although the embargo has prevented Iraq from benefiting. 
</P>
<P>
"By this announcement, we want to participate in reducing the prices of oil to 
the consumer in the world and to expose the game of politicians colluding with 
monopolist oil companies and speculators," Chalabi said. "We also want to help 
in restraining the oil sheiks who have benefited from the crisis and set loose 
their lust for wealth."

World producers are replacing lost Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil faster than expected, 
with the shortfall projected to be less than 1% by December, the Energy 
Department says. 
</P>
<P>
"The loss of oil due to the Iraq occupation of Kuwait has been almost 
eliminated," the department's Energy Information Administration concluded 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said the average worldwide shortfall of crude is expected to be 1.1 
million barrels a day this month and will drop to 600,000 barrels a day in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
The agency projected a shortfall of 400,000 barrels day in December and 
January. The shortfall should be reduced to about half of that in February 
through March, said Calvin Kent, the agency's administrator.

AT&amp;T REPORTS PROFITS UP 2%, CITES LONG-DISTANCE SERVICE

<P>
AT&amp;T said today its profit rose 2% in the third quarter, reflecting 
strength in the company's long-distance service and increased sales of products 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
For the three months ended Sept. 30, AT&amp;T said it earned $712 million, or 
65 cents a share, compared to $699 million, or 65 cents a share, in the same 
quarter last year. Per-share earnings remained stable due to a higher number of 
outstanding shares in the most-recent quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue advanced 5% to $9.36 billion from $8.9 billion in the year-ago quarter. 
Operating income rose 11% to $1.25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Chairman Robert E. Allen called the results 
by the nation's largest long-distance phone company "solid in the face of a 
softening economy." 
</P>
<P>
The company said in a statement that higher-than-expected start-up costs for 
the AT&amp;T Universal Card, a combination credit and calling card introduced 
in March, prevented earnings from showing even stronger gains. Costs for the 
card were higher than expected because of greater demand than the company 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, AT&amp;T said, its earnings were hurt by higher income taxes 
resulting primarily from reduced tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
Product sales, including network telecommunications products, computers, 
microelectronic components and consumer products, jumped almost 13% during the 
quarter to $3.08 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Service revenues, which include long-distance service, installation and 
maintenance of equipment, and finance services, rose 3% to $5.72 billion. 
Long-distance revenue itself grew 1.5% as calling volume advanced 7%. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Nichols, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said the 7% 
increase in calling volume is good news and "shows that AT&amp;T has become 
more effective in stemming market-share erosion" to MCI Communications Corp. 
and U.S. Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols said he is pleased with the company's earnings growth and agreed that 
it is doing well in the light of the economic decline. He called the continued 
earnings drag from the Universal card "a short-term negative, long-term 
positive" since the card holds the potential of increasing earnings in the 
future.

British unemployment increased only 0.1% in September, but officials warned 
today that upcoming wage settlements will determine whether British industries 
-- and jobs -- survive in a unified European market.

Seasonally adjusted unemployment figures released by the Central Office of 
Statistics showed total unemployment at 1.6 million -- 5.8% of the British work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a reflection of the changing politics, owners of the historic Cammell 
Laird shipyard at Birkenhead on the River Mersey, 210 miles north of London, 
announced that defense cuts had forced them to try to sell the once-proud yard, 
builder of Britain's first aircraft carrier, the Ark Royal.

A'S TURN TO IMPROBABLE STOPPER MOORE TO KEEP THEIR HOPES ALIVE

<P>
Somehow, the Oakland Athletics didn't expect that Mike Moore would be their 
World Series stopper. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the A's didn't figure on going home down 2-0 to the Cincinnati 
Reds. 
</P>
<P>
All the signs suggest that the A's are in trouble. Some of those signs were 
even there before the Series started. 
</P>
<P>
The A's miss Walt Weiss' steady defense at shortstop, and despite a Game 2 home 
run, Jose Canseco is hurting. And Mark McGwire isn't hitting. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 1 the Reds destroyed Dave Stewart with a 7-0 rout, and on Wednesday 
they took care of relief ace Dennis Eckersley with a 5-4 victory in 10 innings. 
(Story, C1.) 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Billy Hatcher is 7-for-7 with five extra base hits, the bullpen is 
as nasty as ever, and the Reds are running wild on the bases. 
</P>
<P>
In six at-bats against the Reds' bullpen, Canseco and McGwire are 0-for-6 with 
four strikeouts. Against starters Jose Rijo and Danny Jackson, they are 3-for-8 
with a homer and two runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we won the division, this team felt it could win," Reds Manager Lou 
Piniella said. "I knew that once we got over the hump and won the division, 
we'd be competitive in postseason play." 
</P>
<P>
The A's swept the Boston Red Sox by hanging in there for six or seven innings 
and then wrecking the relievers. That strategy just won't work with Norm 
Charlton, Rob Dibble and Randy Myers waiting in the Cincinnati bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
No team has ever rallied from a 3-0 deficit, and it's up to Moore to make sure 
the A's don't have to try. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter what the situation is, tied or down two games to none," 
Moore said. "I just have to do my job. I'm not going to put any more pressure 
on me." 
</P>
<P>
At least Moore's postseason history suggests the A's are in good shape for Game 
3. The right-hander is 4-0 in the playoffs and World Series the last two 
seasons, including two wins against San Francisco last year. 
</P>
<P>
Moore was 19-11 for the A's in 1989 but dropped to 13-15 this season with a 
4.65 earned run average. At home, he was 7-10. 
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to face Cincinnati left-hander Tom Browning. 
</P>
<P>
Piniella skipped over Browning so Danny Jackson could work on five days' rest 
in Game 2. Browning's record at home might have had something to do with it 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Browning (15-9) was 8-8 with a 4.64 ERA at home and 7-1 with a 2.71 ERA on the 
road. He was 5-1 on grass, the surface at the Coliseum in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The A's will have designated hitter Harold Baines back in the lineup for Game 3 
with the Series moving to an American League park. His presence should help. 
</P>
<P>
The A's swaggered into Cincinnati with an air of invincibility about them, but 
they left shaking their heads. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it's destiny," Reds second baseman Ron Oester said. "We've 
still got to work hard at it. Those guys can get on a roll."

Cincinnati Reds pitcher Tom Browning, scheduled to start Game 3 of the World 
Series on Friday in Oakland, is the father of his third child, born half an 
hour after the Reds' Series victory Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Browning left Riverfront Stadium with his wife, Debbie, during the game. She 
gave birth at St. Elizabeth Medical Center South in Edgewood, Ky., at 12:27 
a.m. EDT to Tucker Thomas, a 6-pound, 10-ounce boy. Browning, 30, also has a 
daughter, Tiffany, 6, and son, Tanner, 3. 
</P>
<P>
Browning left the ballpark still wearing his Reds uniform. Clubhouse attendant 
Rick Stowe informed Browning that his wife was ready to leave the stadium for 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Lou Piniella said he and pitching Coach Stan Williams were surprised by 
Browning's sudden departure. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even know he was gone," Piniella said. "When I saw we were starting 
to eat up pitchers in the middle innings, I said, 'This game is close. Make 
sure Browning doesn't go anywhere.' And Stan said, 'He won't go anywhere.' 
About the eighth inning I said, 'Where is he? I don't see him.' " 
</P>
<P>
Stowe finally tracked Browning through the family's baby-sitter. By then, the 
game was nearly over. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Stan, 'Just know where the pitchers are from now on, please,' " 
Piniella said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Canseco started out Game 2 in fine fashion, but it's how he finished that 
has Oakland Manager Tony La Russa concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco hit an RBI grounder and a solo home run in his first two at-bats, but 
then struck out twice and grounded into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth inning, he let Billy Hatcher's drive to right field skip off his 
glove for a triple, setting up the tying run, and then made an off-line throw 
to the plate after catching a fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a play that if you want to win the game, you have to make," La Russa said 
of Hatcher's hit. "I don't think he got a very good jump." 
</P>
<P>
Canseco missed 31 games because of back problems this season. Recently, he 
jammed the middle finger of his index finger in a refrigerator. Both injuries 
have been bothering him. 
</P>
<P>
La Russa thought a lineup switch might help the offense, so he put National 
League batting champion Willie McGee on the bench and started Dave Henderson in 
center field. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, one of the most productive postseason players in history, again came 
through. He singled twice in four at-bats and walked. 
</P>
<P>
McGee is more accustomed to playing on artificial turf than Henderson because 
of all his years in St. Louis. La Russa has not said who will start when the 
Series moves to Oakland's grass field.

Bankruptcy Judge Lawrence Ollason signed an order Oct. 11 that an auction be 
held at 10 a.m. on Oct. 27 to sell the tickets belonging to David Randall 
Jenkins, a real estate syndicator and developer who filed for bankruptcy three 
years ago for himself, JNC Cos. and other partnerships and companies. 
</P>
<P>

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: CAREFUL CONSULTATION NEEDED IN PLANNING ONE'S OWN DEATH 
</P>

Question: A long time ago, you discussed managing one's own dying. What peace 
of mind I would have if I could plan for my own death, when the time comes that 
my cancer has progressed and I can no longer stand the pain or care for myself. 
Would you please print the address for the Hemlock Society again, so I can 
contact them? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The decision you contemplate is an intensely personal one. Needless to 
say, no one should take such an irrevocable step without careful consultation 
with a physician, clergyman or family member. 
</P>
<P>
Pain can be managed successfully at home or in the hospital with a number of 
effective analgesics. We also suggest you contact your local hospice 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
If you would like more information about the National Hemlock Society, you can 
contact it at P.O. Box 11830, Eugene, Ore., 97440-3900. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can allergy medicine cause insomnia? I thought antihistamines make you 
drowsy but ever since I started taking Sudafed, I have had trouble falling 
asleep. 
</P>
<P>
A: Although you are correct that over-the-counter antihistamines often cause 
sedation, Sudafed (pseudoephedrine) is not an antihistamine. This decongestant 
is capable of causing nervous system stimulation and insomnia. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid this problem, don't take such products in the late afternoon or 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can magnesium prevent kidney stones? I never want to experience that 
excruciating pain again. 
</P>
<P>
A: There is some evidence that magnesium (200 to 300 milligrams a day) may be 
beneficial in preventing calcium oxalate stones. 
</P>
<P>
Q: There is a history of breast cancer in my family so I am automatically at 
high risk. I am worried about osteoporosis, but I don't want to take estrogen 
hormones for fear of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
I've heard about a new medicine, but my doctor doesn't know what I'm talking 
about. Can you tell me where to go for more information? 
</P>
<P>
A: The medication you refer to is Didronel (etidronate). Have your doctor read 
an article in the New England Journal of Medicine by Dr. Nelson B. Watts (July 
12, 1990, Vol. 323, Pages 73-79).

GREAT AND PASSIONATE RIVALRY WILL END SATURDAY WITH MIAMI-NOTRE DAME GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
We'll still have the Celtics-Lakers, Bears-Packers and Simpsons-Cosbys. But 
another great rivalry will end Saturday when Miami plays at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
The teams have met in 19 of the last 20 seasons, and the winner of the last 
three games has gone on to the national championship. Second-ranked Miami and 
sixth-ranked Notre Dame, both 4-1, are in title contention again this year. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame officials have declined Miami's repeated requests to continue the 
series, and the schools are not scheduled to play again. 
</P>
<P>
"We hate to see the rivalry ending," Hurricanes Coach Dennis Erickson said. 
"The last one may be the best one." 
</P>
<P>
It could be a high-scoring send-off. Miami quarterback Craig Erickson will be 
looking at a Notre Dame pass defense that yielded 63 points to air-minded 
Stanford and Air Force the last two weeks. Miami shut out Kansas 34-0 last 
Saturday, but yielded at least 21 points in its four previous games. 
</P>
<P>
The series, labeled Catholics vs. Convicts by Notre Dame students, has strained 
relations between the schools. Coach Jimmy Johnson was widely accused of 
running up the score after Miami won 58-7 in 1985. A pregame fight between the 
teams two years ago increased tension, and Notre Dame players have complained 
about taunting by the Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
"I do think there has been a certain charge, a certain passion to the series," 
Notre Dame Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal said. "Perhaps a year or two off is 
not without its benefits." 
</P>
<P>
It's worth noting that Miami has won five of the last six meetings, outscoring 
the Fighting Irish 190-61. 
</P>
<P>
"Miami has a great team, and Notre Dame's history is to play great teams," 
Rosenthal said. "There's every prospect that the series will be renewed at some 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame's schedule is nearly complete through 2004, Rosenthal said. An 
opening recently developed in 1993 and 1994, but rather than approach Miami, 
the Fighting Irish added games with Florida State, one of the Hurricanes' top 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish they would've contacted us and told us they were doing it," Miami 
Athletic Director Sam Jankovich said. Jankovich said he has written several 
letters to Notre Dame about extending the series and received no response. 
</P>
<P>
Receiver Lamar Thomas is only a sophomore but has already discovered what 
Miami-Notre Dame means. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to keep playing them every year," Thomas said. "It's a game you look 
forward to. You know it's going to be on national TV. You get a chance to show 
your stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"But with the type of teams we have, we'll probably meet them in a bowl game 
somewhere down the line."

Actress Ann Jillian, who underwent a double mastectomy for breast cancer in 
1985, says humor is a great defense when battling a serious illness. 
</P>
<P>
"A sense of humor as well as faith in God and the support of the ones you love, 
that's what will get you through an experience like that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jillian will speak about her experience with cancer Saturday as part of an 
anniversary celebration of Highland Hospital's Breast Care Center. 
</P>
<P>
Jillian, a volunteer for the American Cancer Society, said she isn't shy about 
discussing cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"Cancer isn't a word that should be whispered. It isn't a subject that should 
be hushed up," she said.

RAP GROUP'S DEFENSE PROBES AREA STANDARDS; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: A DETECTIVE ACKNOWLEDGES IN THE 2 LIVE CREW CASE THAT THE FLORIDA SITE 
OF A CONTROVERSIAL CONCERT IS NEAR ADULT CLUBS AND BOOKSTORES.

Nude dance shows and adult bookstores are scattered throughout the county where 
the rap group 2 Live Crew gave its controversial performance, a police 
detective testified today at the band's obscenity trial. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Bruce Rogow cross-examined Broward County Sheriff's Vice 
Detective Eugene McCloud, the prosecution's first witness, in an attempt to 
show that the sexually explicit concert did not violate contemporary community 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
The standards issue is one of the yardsticks the jury must use to determine 
whether band leader Luther Campbell and band members Christopher Wongwon and 
Mark Ross are guilty of giving an obscene performance at Club Futura in 
Hollywood, Fla., on June 10, two days after a federal judge declared the 
group's album "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" obscene. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, each band member could be sentenced to up to one year in prison 
and fined $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
McCloud acknowledged that the concert was held in an area where there are adult 
nightclubs and bookstores, which are "all over Broward County." 
</P>
<P>
The detective, who taped the concert with a mini-cassette recorder while posing 
as a fan, also testified that he recorded only about 50 minutes of the 
performance and not the whole concert. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Judge June Johnson stopped the proceedings while the song "Me So 
Horny" was played from a tape recording of the concert to respond to a note 
from jurors asking if they could chuckle while they listened to the scratchy 
recording. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to know if they are allowed to laugh," Johnson told lawyers outside 
the jury's presence. "They don't want to cackle. Apparently, some of them are 
experiencing some pain. Occasionally, they had to suppress the need to laugh." 
</P>
<P>
She briefly discussed it with the lawyers, called jurors back and informed 
them, "You may laugh if you want to."
