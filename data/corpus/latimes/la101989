ENTERTAINERS INCENSED AT PARK BAN; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: OFFICIALS CALL KICKOFF OF SOVIET FESTIVAL A PRIVATE PARTY; BALBOA PARK 
STREET PERFORMERS CLAIM DISCRIMINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Silly Star, a weekend clown, has been going to Balboa Park for a decade.She 
considers herself a fixture, like the fountain, or the dozens of other street 
performers who show up and entertain only for tips. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't like a clown to be angry, she said, but she's furious. 
</P>
<P>
"You could call it fighting mad," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Barton (Silly Star's real name) said she and 15 to 25 other street 
performers are incensed that Mayor Maureen O'Connor, Balboa Park management and 
the organizers of the Soviet arts festival have joined forces to ban them from 
the park this weekend for Super Powers Sunday, which kicks off the 3 1/2-week 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
In place of the street performers who show up at the park every weekend, Barton 
said, entertainers from Sea World and Seaport Village are being brought in by 
the festival committee "to pretend to be" street performers. 
</P>
<P>
Penny Scott, district manager for Balboa Park, who grants the permits that 
allow street performers to juggle, mime, clown or dance -- but only for tips -- 
said no permits were being granted either Saturday or Sunday because Super 
Powers Sunday is considered a private party. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that we're denying permits," Scott said. "The city ordinance says 
public land cannot be used for private gain. The permits (for street 
performers) are administered by this department and at our discretion. Street 
performers enhance the park, but if we feel they pose a conflict for an already 
scheduled event, we have the right to take away their 
</P>
<P>
permits. We've chosen to exercise that right." 
</P>
<P>
Barton called the ban discriminatory and said the park's legion of street 
performers may stage a sit-in demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"I have some basic questions," said Cynthia Douglass, 29, of Del Mar, who plays 
the harp in the park. "If we who perform in the park on a regular basis are not 
being given the opportunity to play for our Soviet visitors, and others are, 
why, exactly, is that? How is it not discriminatory? 
</P>
<P>
Barton, 39, said she had been told by spokesmen in the park office that some of 
the street performers are "bums" or "panhandlers" and that the city "didn't 
want to be embarrassed" by having them seen by visiting dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
Scott denied that anyone in her office said that, but she did say that "some 
people in the public have complained about the street performers. "A lot of 
people don't like" performers seeking tips, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott said the no-permit policy for this weekend is not discriminatory. She 
also disputed the performers' contention that the city is embarrassed by them 
and is choosing to shut them out because their image is not what the mayor's 
office wants to convey. 
</P>
<P>
"That is just plain old not true," said Paul Downey, a spokesman for Mayor 
O'Connor, who conceived the festival. "We'll have 3,000 performers throughout 
the park representing all the different cultures of San Diego. We'll have 
Filipino groups, Mexican groups, Irish groups and Italian groups, the one 
caveat being that everyone donate their time. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Sea World and Seaport Village performers are being paid, they're not 
being paid by us. And the last I heard, Peg Nugent (hired by the festival to 
book entertainers for the park) still needed performers." 
</P>
<P>
Nugent and representatives of Sea World and Seaport Village were unavailable 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been coming here for 10 years," Barton said, "and I'm a quality 
entertainer. Most of the street performers I know are talented and dedicated. I 
know of one who was living in the park, but to lump us all together and 
stereotype us as though we were common vagrants only adds insult to injury." 
</P>
<P>
Barton said permits were also denied for last weekend's KidzArtz Fair for the 
same reason: "We weren't welcome at a private party." 
</P>
<P>
Scott said it was more a case, as it is this weekend, of the park being packed 
with events and performers and that the sponsors of each event -- the 
children's fair and Super Powers Sunday -- "went out of their way" to ask that 
street performers "not be there." 
</P>
<P>
"Each group said they'd just rather have their own people," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the San Diego Police Department has said that as many as 50,000 
people could show up for the six-hour event. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Phelps, 69, a Normal Heights retiree, who was in the park Wednesday 
watching Barton, harpist Douglass and other performers earlier in the day, said 
he is "mystified" by the city's objection. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of the atmosphere of a great park," Phelps said. "The street 
performers are part of what makes Balboa Park a fun place. Take them away -- 
take away the atmosphere, chip away at it a bit at a time -- and what have we 
got? I don't like the way this smells." 
</P>
<P>
"This ban, as it were, is really sad," said Deris Jeannette, 41, who said he 
had watched street performers in the park for years and considers them "one of 
its best aspects." 
</P>
<P>
"To forbid these people to do what it is they do -- and do well, for the 
pleasure of many -- just because they don't fit the image that San Diego wishes 
they would is really reprehensible," Jeannette said. 
</P>
<P>
Barton, wearing a rug-like multicolored wig, red sneakers and suspenders and 
blue stars painted on her chin and around her eyes, said the customary group of 
street performers who visit the park includes three clowns, two jugglers, a 
magician, a man and woman who read Tarot cards, six artists and an Indian who 
does traditional Native American dances. 
</P>
<P>
He, too, is banned, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we're ashamed of even our own country's heritage," she said.

HUNTER TESTIFIES TO HER LOVE FOR DOMINELLI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a long-awaited appearance, a teary-eyed Nancy Hoover Hunter took the stand 
in her own defense Wednesday and talked of love and her affair with J. David 
(Jerry) Dominelli, founder of the failed J. David &amp; Co. investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, who is charged with 197 counts of tax evasion and fraud, described how 
she and Dominelli met, how they fell in love in 1979 and how he wrote her 
letters in which he said he loved her "more than anything" and promised to live 
his life with her. 
</P>
<P>
Her testimony took so much time that court adjourned for the day before Hunter 
was able to describe her version of business at Dominelli's La Jolla investment 
firm and its collapse in 1984. About 1,200 investors lost about $80 million in 
the J. David affair, a giant fraud in which prosecutors allege Hunter played an 
active role and which led to Dominelli's conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's testimony was consistent with the theme her defense attorneys have 
been stressing since the lengthy trial began in March: that Hunter was blinded 
by her love for Dominelli and was unaware of his illegal 
</P>
<P>
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Dominelli pleaded guilty in 1985 to four counts of fraud and tax evasion in 
connection with the investment firm's Ponzi scheme and is serving a 20-year 
sentence in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
Clients were lured to J. David &amp; Co. by the use of phony investment records 
and the promise of fabulous returns on their money. In reality, J. David had a 
dismal investment record and old clients were paid with money from new 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1984, its checks began to bounce, and nervous investors forced the 
firm into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter described Wednesday how she first met Dominelli, in the late 1970s, when 
they were both married to other people and worked at the same La Jolla 
brokerage firm -- Bache, Halsey, Stuart, Shields -- where she had worked since 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
At first she disliked Dominelli, she said, thinking he was a male chauvinist. 
But, by the summer of 1979, she came to like him, then love him, as he told her 
stories about his poor background and his service in Vietnam. In fact, 
Dominelli had never been to Vietnam, Hunter's lawyers have said. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter said she confessed to her then-husband, George Hoover -- a former 
officer in the U.S. government's foreign service who later became a stockbroker 
and with whom Hunter had two children -- that she was in love with Dominelli. 
</P>
<P>
Dominelli, meanwhile, promised that one day Hunter and her children would live 
with him as a family, she said. And he wrote her letters in which he said "he 
loved me more than anything in the world" and promised to spend his life with 
her, Hunter said. She believed him and "read and reread the letters many 
times." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Hunter and Dominelli began living together and spent millions of 
dollars of investors' money on expensive homes, cars and furs. They spent more 
than $1.5 million to remodel office space in La Jolla, Chicago and San 
Francisco, prosecutors have said. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter and Dominelli eventually broke up, after J. David collapsed. She has 
since remarried and lives with her new husband, businessman Kenneth Hunter, 
near Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
On the stand Wednesday, Hunter had time to turn only to J. David's initial 
months. In 1979 and 1980, she said, she typed drafts of the brochures Dominelli 
used in luring investors. 
</P>
<P>
In line with the defense theory that Dominelli was in sole control of the 
company, down to even the smallest details, she said he wrote and made all 
revisions to the brochures. She simply typed them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the jurors were attentive to Hunter's every word and leaned forward in 
their seats to listen to her. She was expected to take the stand again today 
for what her lawyers estimated would be at least another two days of testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The defense is expected to rest its case by the end of next week.

D.C. HEARINGS SOUGHT ON BORDER VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three U.S. representatives from Southern California have called for 
congressional hearings in San Diego to explore ways of reducing what many see 
as an escalating pattern of violence along the U.S.-Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
Writing that the situation is "explosive," the three lawmakers -- Esteban 
Torres (D-Pico Rivera), Jim Bates (D-San Diego) and Mel Levine (D-Los Angeles) 
-- recited a series of recent violent confrontations near the border. 
</P>
<P>
Among the incidents mentioned: the shooting in August of a 15-year-old Mexican 
boy by a member of the U.S. Border Patrol and the death shortly before of a 
14-year-old who was run over and killed by a Border Patrol vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not feel we can sit back any longer and wait for yet another tragedy," 
the three representatives wrote in a letter, dated Oct. 12, to Rep. Gus Yatron, 
D-Pa., chairman of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee on human rights and 
international relations. "While we recognize that Border Patrol officers are 
often subject to harassment by unsavory elements . . . methods must be found to 
reduce the potential for violence at this international crossing." 
</P>
<P>
A subcommittee spokesman in Washington called the request for a hearing 
"legitimate" and indicated that a session could probably be arranged before the 
end of the year. However, because of budgetary restrictions, the foreign 
affairs panel is limited to holding hearings in Washington. That has prompted 
Torres, who spearheaded the move, to seek out a Judiciary Committee 
subcommittee that deals with immigration issues and would be able to travel. 
</P>
<P>
Among the possible actions aimed at reducing border violence, the lawmakers 
wrote, is an in-depth study of stress among U.S. border guards to determine 
whether there is a need for more manpower, improved training or even a 
restructuring of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
The Border Patrol, a uniformed enforcement arm of the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, has more than 700 officers based in the San Diego area, 
the largest such contingent in the nation. The region accounts for more than a 
third of all immigration arrests throughout the Southern frontier. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrant advocates and the INS said they would welcome the congressional 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that the problem along the border is finally being given the 
attention it merits," said Virginia Kice , a spokeswoman with the INS' regional 
office in Los Angeles, who noted that many Border Patrol officers have also 
been attacked. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Martinez, who co-chairs a San Diego human rights coalition, is among 
those who has pushed for the hearings. "The important point is that the 
violence is getting worse, not better," said Martinez, border representative 
for the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker group. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, border violence is likely to be a key topic among U.S. and Mexican 
officials who plan to confer in San Diego later this year on a range of border 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Oltyan, a Mexico desk officer at the State Department in Washington, 
said the session will involve a binational advisory group that examines issues 
of joint concern to the two nations. Previous meetings have taken place in 
Mexico City and Washington, he said, but officials have now decided to hold 
more of the talks in border cities where the issues are experienced directly. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from violence, some of the concerns to be addressed include arrest and 
detentions of Mexican citizens in the United States and of U.S. nationals in 
Mexico, the repatriation of minors from both nations, the use of material 
witnesses from the two countries in legal cases and the return of recovered 
vehicles that had been stolen and taken across the border. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to focus in on where we're having problems and determine where we 
can improve things," Oltyan said.

FAMILY BLAMES INMATE DEATH ON IGNORED ORDER; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: INSTEAD OF HOSPITALIZING HIM, DEPUTIES STRAPPED A MAN TO A JAIL COT 
WHERE HE DIED OF A BLOOD CLOT IN HIS LUNG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lawyer for the widow and children of a North Hollywood man who died in jail 
told a San Fernando Superior Court jury that Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
deputies ignored a court order to take him to a hospital for medical treatment 
and instead strapped him to a cot for 40 hours. 
</P>
<P>
A county lawyer responded that deputies did not know about the order because a 
court clerk had misplaced it. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Malinovitz, 38, died from a blood clot in his lung on Jan. 28, 1984, 
five days after he was arrested for elbowing an elderly woman to the ground in 
a shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
His wife and two children, now 14 and 10, are suing the county for unspecified 
damages. Opening arguments in the San Fernando Superior Court civil trial 
concluded Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Allan F. Grossman said Malinovitz's death could have been prevented by 
appropriate medical care in custody. During those five days, Grossman said, 
Malinovitz, a family man with no prior criminal record, displayed erratic 
behavior that should have alerted deputies that something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy County Counselor Philip S. Miller said Malinovitz would have died 
even if deputies had taken him to a hospital, because doctors there would not 
have properly diagnosed his disease. He argued that Malinovitz's strange 
behavior stemmed from mental illness and was not a symptom of the blood clot 
that killed him. 
</P>
<P>
"The examiner probably would not have found the clots, because Mr. Malinovitz 
could not describe any symptoms," Miller said. "Mr. Malinovitz died from a 
disease he did not even know he had. It is an asymptomatic, silent killer." 
</P>
<P>
However, Grossman said Malinovitz had a history of blood clots, which he said 
can cause confusion and erratic behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Two days before Malinovitz's death, San Fernando Municipal Court Commissioner 
Charles L. Peven postponed Malinovitz's scheduled arraignment and ordered 
sheriff's deputies to take him to County-USC Medical Center after deputies 
found him lying naked and dazed in the court's holding cell. 
</P>
<P>
But deputies returned him to the Men's Central Jail downtown, Grossman said, 
where they fastened him to an iron cot, strapping his wrists and ankles, for 40 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Leather restraints are a "therapeutic device" used to control and calm inmates 
with mental problems and a propensity to violence, Miller said. Deputies placed 
Malinovitz in restraints because he shoved another prisoner, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the jail administrators never received the order that Malinovitz go 
to the hospital, because a court clerk kept it on his desk instead of sending 
it to the jail. 
</P>
<P>
"'That court order did not leave here with Mr. Malinovitz," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, after Malinovitz's court appearance, Sue, his wife of 17 years, went 
to the hospital to await his arrival, Grossman said. From the hospital, she 
called the jail repeatedly, asking where her husband was and why the court 
order was ignored, Grossman said. Her calls went unheeded, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that he was in need of immediate medical care. The county 
was ordered to get it for him, and they didn't do it," Grossman said.

LANCASTER PAIR CHARGED IN MASSIVE GRAND THEFT SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Lancaster couple has been charged with grand theft, forgery and securities 
violations for allegedly bilking investors out of millions of dollars through 
two San Fernando Valley-based companies. 
</P>
<P>
A 117-count complaint filed Monday by the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office accuses David and Karen Missman of engineering elaborate 
schemes involving promissory notes and real estate loans to defraud 35 
investors, many of them schoolteachers who live in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
An audit by the state Department of Corporations indicates that close to $10 
million of investor money is unaccounted for in the records of the Missmans' 
now bankrupt companies, S.C.S. Co. and Missman Kaplan Associates Ltd., 
according to court papers. 
</P>
<P>
But officials said as much as $30 million, collected from up to 5,000 victims 
since 1979, may have been misappropriated. The complaint focuses on the cases 
in which they had the best evidence, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert M. 
Youngdahl. 
</P>
<P>
"We have people who have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars," Youngdahl 
said. "Some of them have been devastated." 
</P>
<P>
The Missmans have agreed to surrender Monday in Los Angeles Municipal Court, 
Youngdahl said. They face 10 years in prison if convicted. The Missmans and 
their attorney, Michael Nasatir of Santa Monica, could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Missmans allegedly targeted active and retired teachers because some of 
their company officers and salespeople were former teachers, investigators 
said. Among them was Henry Springer, a former president of the United 
Teachers-Los Angeles, who alleged in a sworn declaration that Missman and his 
family used investor funds for luxury cars, travel and houses. 
</P>
<P>
Some victims invested money in promissory notes secured by deeds of trust 
offered by the Missman companies, which purportedly brought together investors 
who acted as borrowers with homeowners seeking home improvement loans. The 
Missmans then allegedly bilked borrowers by forging their names in order to 
resell the deeds repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
The Missmans allegedly also ran a scheme in which new investors in a 
"factoring" program, involving the purchase of low-interest utility loans, were 
paid interest with the money of earlier investors. 
</P>
<P>
After the Department of Corporations ordered them to end such illegal practices 
in 1987, the Missmans continued to defraud investors through illicit 
partnerships set up through a Chicago firm, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
One alleged victim, a Woodland Hills resident who asked not to be identified, 
said the Missmans and their sales representatives had appeared to be "very 
pleasant" and "were not hard-sell type of people." 
</P>

The victim said his monthly payment checks on a deed of trust began bouncing in 
1987, about two years after his initial investment, and then abruptly stopped 
coming. Other victims lost more money, Youngdahl said, because they allowed the 
companies to purportedly make new investments with their earnings instead of 
receiving monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
"On paper it looked as if they were making a lot of money," Youngdahl said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim said he has attended meetings along with scores of other investors 
seeking a way to get their money back, but has been advised by lawyers that 
recovering anything will be extremely difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"The only type of satisfaction I can hope for now is if they're put in prison," 
he said. Youngdahl said a maximum of $300,000 of the couple's assets seized by 
authorities could be returned to investors. 
</P>

MKA and S.C.S. were forced into involuntary bankruptcy proceedings in February 
by three creditors. In March, investigators for the Department of Corporations 
and district attorney's office seized business records at those companies and 
at a $1.3-million Chatsworth home owned by Missman.

STUDENTS, FACULTY URGE PIERCE COLLEGE TO KEEP OPEN SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pierce College faculty members and students pleaded with college administrators 
Wednesday not to develop open space and farmland on the 420-acre campus. 
</P>
<P>
The comments came during a hearing headed by Pierce President Daniel Means and 
other officials gathering information for a planned land-use study of the 
school ordered by the Los Angeles Community College District board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
The study, which will not be started until next year, will help determine the 
future of the 41-year-old college. Testimony from the hearing Wednesday and one 
scheduled for next month will help identify the alternative land uses to be 
considered in the study. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 50 people who attended the meeting at the school's Campus Center 
said the open space, including 200 acres of farmland and all other open areas 
on campus, should be preserved and not sold to developers. The sentiments 
echoed the longstanding fears of San Fernando Valley residents, who fear that a 
golf course, apartments or an equestrian center will be put on the farmland. 
</P>
<P>
"Just looking at the open space is a comfort to all of us," said Louise Bianco, 
who works in the enrollment office. "We're pleading with you -- don't build on 
it, don't pave it over. There's so little greenbelt around here." 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Rodgers, 25, a history student at the college, said the vacant land 
"is the last open space in the West Valley. That's something you can't put a 
value on, even at $1 million an acre. We don't need a golf course or another 
shopping mall. Profit should not be the bottom line here." 
</P>
<P>
Many speakers recommended that the school's struggling agricultural program and 
farmland be preserved. Means had said last month that the program could be shut 
down in the spring of 1992 if enrollment does not improve. Enrollment fell this 
year by 200, to 1,300, continuing a long-term decline. 
</P>
<P>
"This school was originally set up as an agricultural school," said Michelle 
Bincus, 23, a computer science student. "It would be destroying the heritage of 
the school if you take that away." 
</P>
<P>
However, a few speakers told officials the open space was not needed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the primary goal of this school to be a pretty place," said Michael 
Ferry, 21, an anthropology student. "Our goal is to provide education -- not to 
be a pretty back-yard scene for Woodland Hills residents." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Baerwitz, a faculty member who helps recruit high school students, said 
selling some of the school's acreage would enable the college to finance "a 
much needed face lift. We have to have a place where students will want to go." 
</P>
<P>
The comments will be incorporated into a report by the school's planning 
advisory committee, which will advertise at the end of the year for a firm to 
conduct the land-use study. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the public were not allowed to speak at the meeting, but Means said 
they will have an opportunity to comment during a Nov. 17 hearing at the 
school.

TORTOISE KEEPER FEARS 'TANK' IS IN THE SOUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Sherman Tank," mascot of the San Fernando Valley chapter of the California 
Turtle and Tortoise Club, has been tortoise-napped, his caretaker says. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Gordon of Sylmar said Wednesday she worries that the unusually large 
California desert tortoise met his end in a soup pot or has been sacrificed in 
a satanic ritual. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon said he disappeared Sept. 22 and could not have escaped because a 
six-foot fence anchored in cement surrounds the yard. She has had no reply to 
flyers offering a $50 reward. 
</P>
<P>
Or he may have been sold, Gordon said. A prized tortoise like 50-year-old 
Sherman Tank -- an 18-pounder who stretches 19 inches from beak to tail -- 
fetches $1,000 to $2,000 on the reptilian black market, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a month now and I don't expect to see him again," said Gordon, who 
is in charge of the chapter's turtle adoption program. "Anybody could have 
taken him. They could have taken off in a car and gone God knows where." 
</P>
<P>
And he was charming (well, for a tortoise). 
</P>
<P>
"He would eat out of your hand," she said. "He'd rest his head on your foot, he 
would sniff you and follow you anywhere."

SAN DIEGANS ROLL UP SLEEVES TO HELP QUAKE VICTIMS

Within an hour of the earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay Area late 
Tuesday afternoon, the San Diego Blood Bank had packed 50 units of blood 
platelets onto a Greyhound bus headed north. 
</P>
<P>
By noon Wednesday, 100 people here had rolled up their sleeves and were 
donating fresh blood to the victims in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen a lot of first-time donors here today," said Lynn Stedd, a 
spokesperson for the local blood bank. "I've seen families. I've seen mothers 
and children, relatives coming in together. I've seen longtime volunteer 
donors, even a 25-gallon donor came down." 
</P>
<P>
But Stedd particularly remembered the elderly woman who stopped by. 
</P>
<P>
"She made her first blood donation," Stedd said. "She just felt like she was 
trying to contribute to the community." 
</P>
<P>
Blood donors, charitable organizations, utility workers and the military -- all 
types of San Diego people and groups began pitching in Wednesday to send 
manpower and supplies to help the recovery in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
By this morning, as many as 100 Navy Seabees and civilian employees from 
various San Diego bases are expected in the Bay Area to help with repairs on 
military installations, Mike Stuart, commander of naval base operations in San 
Diego, said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides manpower, San Diego's Navy bases are sending equipment and supplies. 
Those items are being transported by truck convoys and airlift. Additional 
Seabees and civilians could be sent later in the week, once officials learn how 
badly the Bay Area bases are damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Revier, communications director for the Salvation Army in San Diego, said 
his organization is sending vehicles filled with bottled water, blankets and 
emergency cots. 
</P>
<P>
Al Davis, a senior vice president at San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co., said the 
utility is dispatching as many as 30 employees to help repair the natural-gas 
distribution network in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got lines that are broken and customers who have turned off their gas," 
he said.

MAN SENTENCED TO 2 YEARS IN DRUNK-DRIVING DEATH IN 1979 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
A man who eluded the law for nearly a decade pleaded guilty to manslaughter 
Wednesday in the death of a Canyon Country teen-ager in a drunk-driving 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Wendlandt, 38, was sentenced to two years in prison for killing Mytina 
Lee Bailey, 18, in a traffic accident Feb. 17, 1979, a week before her wedding 
date. 
</P>
<P>
With credit for jail time served since his February arrest, Wendlandt probably 
will be out of prison in less than seven months, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Kenneth L. Barshop. 
</P>
<P>
Wendlandt could have received more jail time if he had been sentenced under a 
law enacted two years ago, Barshop said. Because of public outrage over 
drunk-driving accidents, the Legislature in 1987 stiffened the maximum sentence 
for vehicular manslaughter to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
But Wendlandt, by law, had to be sentenced under the statute that existed in 
1979, when the maximum for vehicular manslaughter was three years, Barshop 
said. To further complicate matters, Barshop said, there was no law against 
fleeing to avoid criminal charges in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Ronald S. Coen ruled that because Wendlandt had no prior felony 
convictions and pleaded guilty before a trial, he should not receive the 
maximum sentence now allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Wendlandt was arrested in Milwaukee on Feb. 10, after he was in a street fight, 
authorities there said. At the time of his arrest, he admitted that he had used 
several aliases, including Gerald Voigt, they said. The authorities ran the 
aliases through a computer and discovered that Voigt was wanted in California 
for manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Wendlandt agreed to return to California after extradition proceedings were 
started. His guilty plea came just hours before attorneys were to begin picking 
a jury for his trial. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at the intersection of Sierra Highway and Via Princessa 
at 2:45 a.m. Bailey, driving a pickup truck she had received as a birthday gift 
from her fiancee two weeks before, was waiting to make a left turn onto Via 
Princessa when Wendlandt's car hit her head-on, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Tests showed that Wendlandt's blood-alcohol level was 0.13, investigators said. 
The legal limit in California is 0.10. Bailey died 10 days after the accident 
from brain injuries suffered in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
After his arrest 10 years ago, Wendlandt posted $500 bail and disappeared.

'SELF-ESTEEM IS EARNED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am in agreement with Schmoker. "Groundless praise" may encourage complacency, 
but more importantly this form of patronizing behavior has no place in our 
educational system where it breeds contempt among its students. During the '60s 
this contempt was concerned with the "hypocrisy" reflected in middle-class 
values. It is disquieting to consider the ways in which our educators still 
encourage these same attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the onus of failure permeates middle-class values and teaches 
the young that "one can never do enough." The resulting stress leads many 
students to drop out, or to set lesser goals for themselves. Most parents want 
their children to go to college, and in particular those parents who never went 
to college themselves. These same people confuse what is "great about America" 
and what has been "good for Japan." 
</P>
<P>
The most unfair comparison to date concerns the test-score differences among 
Korean, and Japanese students, who score higher than American students in 
mathematics. The fact being many Far Eastern countries start winnowing out 
their lesser achievers in the lower grades. There is no room for the late 
bloomer, or the quirky genius to flower, for the term "self" as used in the 
Orient is something quite different from the "self" we refer to in Western 
culture. The fact that Korean students ranked themselves last in mathematics, 
when in fact they were first, demonstrates a lack of self-esteem by Western 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
What we call self-esteem is that quality which most often encourages a student 
to rebel, and it is the ideal behind the student movement for democracy in 
China. Self-esteem, in order to grow, must have self-expression. Yet many 
school administrators, well-schooled themselves in crisis management, have 
adopted a patronizing attitude which rewards mediocrity and breeds contempt. 
Yes, tougher standards apply, but fewer constraints as well, which seems to me 
to be the essence of the American experience.

BURBANK COUNCILWOMAN DROPS HUSBAND'S LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burbank City Councilwoman Mary Lou Howard, in a move aimed at ending 
accusations of conflict of interest, has dropped a lawsuit that her late 
husband filed against the city in a property dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"The case is over," Howard said. "I was never interested in pursuing this 
lawsuit. There were just some things that had to be worked through before it 
was dropped." 
</P>
<P>
Howard's announcement at Tuesday night's council meeting was met with applause 
by several people seated in the council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit stemmed from a 1984 dispute that arose when the city's 
Redevelopment Agency used its power of eminent domain to take over Jack 
Howard's law office building at Angeleno Avenue and 3rd Street. Although Howard 
was reimbursed for his property, the agency refused to relocate his law 
practice on a downtown redevelopment site because of his wife's position on the 
Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally did not have any interest in this case," Mary Lou Howard told the 
council. "It was filed because the agency refused to forward the same rights 
and benefits to Jack that other persons receive when they are relocated from a 
redevelopment project." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, however, was dismissed in March when Jack Howard committed 
suicide. It was refiled a short time later by Mary Lou Howard because, she 
said, she needed time to assess all of the legal issues involved before 
deciding what action to take. The suit had asked for $1 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to make any rash decisions," Howard said. "Jack is gone now, so 
it no longer makes any difference." 
</P>
<P>
For the past several months, Howard has come under harsh criticism from other 
City Council members and the public because of her pursuit of the legal action. 
Last week, the council members directed the city attorney to investigate 
whether Howard was in conflict of interest as a result of the litigation. 
</P>
<P>
After her announcement to drop the suit, Councilman Thomas E. Flavin told 
Howard that he appreciated her decision. He said he hoped there were no hard 
feelings between Howard and the council regarding the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"As council members, we have the responsibility of vigorously defending 
taxpayer money from any lawsuit that is filed against us, by anybody," Flavin 
told Howard. "I don't think there were any personal differences that motivated 
it. It was just that we saw it as our responsibility."

SAN FRANCISCO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I live high up on Potrero Hill. From my bedroom window I have a panoramic view 
of downtown San Francisco, the Berkeley Hills, Oakland and the Bay Bridge. Last 
night, I kept getting up every hour or two to look at the downtown skyline -- 
utterly dark except for the battery-powered emergency lights -- and on toward 
the carless bridge and the stretch of the Nimitz Freeway where a hundred, two 
hundred, who knows how many more people are still sitting in their automobiles, 
crushed to death. 
</P>
<P>
Instantaneous, pointless death is such a deep and atavistic fear that we bury 
it or joke about it until it walks in the door and flashes its death-mask grin. 
When a plane crashes and a couple of hundred people, who a few seconds earlier 
were chattering and drinking happily, become bits of incinerated flesh, we are 
rudely awakened for a few hours, a day or two, because we know they could have 
been us, and then we doze back into the somnolence of denial. Flying is still 
safer than driving, we say. It's probably safer than walking. Anyway, what can 
you do? 
</P>
<P>
What can you do. . . . The Ohlone Indians, who lived around San Francisco Bay 
for thousands of years, must have experienced earthquakes far more powerful 
than the World Series quake, or whatever it's going to be called. But to people 
living at that level of simplicity, earthquakes are just a terrifying 
curiosity. Their society is not utterly incapacitated by collapsing overpass 
pylons and falling bridge decks. They do not risk months without water when 
aqueducts break, or neighborhood conflagrations when water pressure disappears. 
</P>
<P>
"Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!" Obviously, we have learned nothing 
since Shelley introduced us to Ozymandias. As a species, we can't resist 
flaunting our profound ability to defy nature with our dams, skyscrapers, 
freeways, nuclear power plants. And the more spectacular this ability becomes, 
the more vulnerable we make ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
That is the oldest cliche in the world -- the higher you rise, the farther you 
fall -- but it seems we keep having to relearn it, and we never really learn 
from it. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose we had never built the Bay Bridge. We would go to work by ferry, or by 
driving around the bay rather than across it. That would be inconvenient, 
time-consuming, inefficient, all of those things a frenetic and gilt-edged 
society abhors. But the Bay Area would not be in a state of near-total 
paralysis today. We wouldn't be looking at billions and billions of dollars in 
lost productivity and months or years of chaos and worse gridlock than before, 
as bridges and elevated highways are repaired or torn down and rebuilt. I 
wouldn't be spending the night staring at unseen corpses out in the 
red-flashing dark. 
</P>
<P>
It's remarkable how intact our paralyzed city seems; it's unthinkable what kind 
of horror that 1906 earthquake, 30 times stronger than yesterday's, would have 
caused. 
</P>
<P>
Think hard about this, Los Angeles. Remember, you were supposed to have been 
hit before us. How many more people are you going to squeeze into your deadly 
little arid basin? What are you going to do when your aqueducts are destroyed? 
When your freeways come tumbling down? When the mobility you have so 
assiduously pursued bites you back, paralyzing you? 
</P>
<P>
Freeways, bridges, tunnels, aqueducts, dams and all the rest -- for this whole 
century we have been fascinated by such gargantuan wizardry, partly because it 
snubs nature (or what we used to call reality) so wondrously; but mainly, and 
quite simply, because we could build it. The atomic bomb, Robert Oppenheimer 
said, was "technically sweet"; it had to be built. Inventing computers was the 
same sort of brilliant feat, but a bizarre little "virus" hardly anyone 
understands seems capable of shutting down the nation's information network. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't to say we should dance our way back to the Bronze Age. But it is to 
wonder how many more layers of engineered and technocratic complexity we should 
add to this vulnerable invention we call modern society. 
</P>
<P>
From my window now I can see little ferries racing back and forth across the 
bay, rescued from ignominy (basically, we'd left them to the tourists) so they 
can help rescue us from this catastrophe. How do you tell a society like ours 
that wisdom lies in reaching backward for old ideas?

AND MALE PROSTITUTION OFF SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD.

<P>
Unhappy with recent efforts by law enforcement and city of West Hollywood 
officials to decrease the highly visible problems of drug dealing and male 
prostitution in the area around La Jolla Street off Santa Monica Boulevard, 
neighbors are turning up the heat with letters, complaints and even a threat to 
bring in the Guardian Angels, the self-styled crime fighters. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, who recently arranged for foot patrols by Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies and weekend barricades of parking areas frequented by 
out-of-town cruisers, are responding to the pressure with further attempts to 
make the area around Circus of Books bookstore inaccessible to drug dealers, 
prostitutes, and their customers. 
</P>
<P>
After a hastily called meeting with unhappy neighbors last week, Mayor Abbe 
Land directed city staff this week to put together a comprehensive program of 
traffic restrictions suggested by residents and designed to discourage 
cruising. Suggestions include barricading parking lots all night, making an 
alleyway into a one-way street, placing "no right turn" and "no left turn" 
signs at some intersections, and changing landscaping to eliminate shadowy 
trysting areas. 
</P>
<P>
But some neighbors, wary of previous city promises to reduce illegal activity 
in the area, are still holding out the possibility that the Guardian Angels may 
be called in to help. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be very embarrassing for this city to admit they can't handle a 
crime problem in such a small area. If changes aren't implemented soon, we (the 
neighbors) are going to have a show of force. I'll call the Guardian Angels 
down," said Jordan Berkove, who lives at the end of the parking lot on 
Havenhurst Street, where much of the nighttime vice takes place. 
</P>
<P>
Berkove contacted the Los Angeles chapter of the well-known youth patrol last 
week after becoming frustrated that sheriff's foot patrols had done little to 
discourage late-night drug and sex activity in the alleyway and parking lot 
behind Circus of Books. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Kirkman, leader of the Los Angeles Guardian Angels chapter, said the 
group agreed to help if residents organize a community orientation meeting. He 
said the group would come in and be what he called "a presence," carrying 
signs, following prostitutes and teaching residents how to take back the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Capt. Rachel Burgess of the West Hollywood unit said she "absolutely 
opposed" bringing in outside groups such as the Guardian Angels, and said such 
a move would probably cause more problems than it solved. 
</P>
<P>
Berkove and other neighbors have recently flooded West Hollywood city officials 
with complaints about highly visible drug deals, discarded syringes and people 
engaged in sex in their front yards. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Tom Larkin, who said previous city proposals to clean up the 
neighborhood were a "Band-Aid approach," developed the plan to alter traffic 
routes to work in conjunction with the closure of Circus of Books between 2 
a.m. and 6 a.m., as recently ordered by the city's Business License Commission.

RAISING THE ROOF;

<P>
PLAN TO EXTEND FREEWAY INTO OLD NEIGHBORHOOD CALLED CULTURAL SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

On his lush lawn bordered by beds of asparagus ferns and impatiens in shades of 
pink, purple, red and orange, Vern L. Bengtson surveyed the land around 
Prospect Circle, where eight lanes of the Long Beach Freeway may one day 
traverse South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that the whole neighborhood, this beautiful 1920s neighborhood, 
would be taken," Bengtson said. "To me, it's cultural suicide to destroy a 
glimpse into what represents the best of the architectural past in Southern 
California. To indiscriminately tear this down is sinful." 
</P>
<P>
Bengtson, 48, is the director of the Gerontology Research Institute at USC. 
Seven years ago, he and his wife bought their two-story Mediterranean Revival 
house, with its Italian influences of arched doorways, its columns, porch 
balustrades and red roof tiles. 
</P>
<P>
When Bengtson bought the house, it was not in the proposed 6.2-mile path of the 
freeway extension. Now it is -- along with 1,425 other houses in Pasadena, 
South Pasadena and the El Sereno section of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the architectural significance of Bengtson's neighborhood, it is 
eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
The National Trust for Historic Preservation, citing the freeway plans, 
recently designated South Pasadena as one of America's 11 "endangered places." 
Within the proposed route are dozens of historic houses. These include houses 
designed by internationally known architects Rudolf Schindler and Charles and 
Henry Greene. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the state Department of Transportation say they are sensitive to 
the impact the road would have on historical structures and to that end, they 
say, Caltrans has developed the least intrusive and best route. 
</P>
<P>
"We're proposing to move and restore all the architecturally distinctive houses 
in the path," said Jeffrey Bingham, Caltrans' chief of environmental planning 
for Los Angeles and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bingham said, although the department will negotiate with homeowners 
on whether an individual house meets that criterion, perhaps only a few dozen 
of the most architecturally and historically significant houses will be moved. 
</P>
<P>
Bengtson's house, with its unpainted concrete exterior and canvas awnings over 
the casement windows, is an unlikely candidate. 
</P>
<P>
By any standard, it is a wonderful house, although its designer and builder 
were not famous. To Bengtson, the 3,500-square-foot house is a treasure beyond 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Bengtson explained that the house was typical of upper-middle-class homes when 
it was built for $10,000 in 1927. Much of the design and construction, he said, 
incorporated elements of the Craftsman school. 
</P>
<P>
"The theme then was bringing the best of craftsmanship to everyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But that kind of craftsmanship is expensive today. A similar house on Linda 
Vista in Pasadena or in Sierra Madre would be worth at least $900,000, he said.

RIVER BOAT GAMBLERS; 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO ENTREPRENEUR WANTS TO TRY HIS LUCK ON IOWA RIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three years ago, 62-year-old San Diego entertainment entrepreneur Franklin 
Fried was looking for a new business to get into. 
</P>
<P>
So, Fried brainstormed for a product that would satisfy Americans' yearning to 
go back to a simpler time, for something with mystique that was romantic and 
perhaps a bit naughty, too. 
</P>
<P>
Something like . . . river boat gambling. 
</P>
<P>
Approached by Iowa officials eager to find new ways of boosting a state economy 
weakened by an agricultural recession, Fried offered to start an operation that 
would send paddle-wheel steamboats churning along the Mississippi and Missouri 
rivers that border the state. 
</P>
<P>
Fried saw river boats stocked with tourists eager to try their hands at 
blackjack or roulette as potentially a unique and lucrative new tourist 
attraction. Each boat could generate $15 million to $17 million in annual 
revenues, a portion of which would flow into the state's coffers. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, this scenario took one step closer to reality as Fried Schegan 
&amp; Associates of San Diego was selected by the Missouri River Historical 
Development Inc. to operate Iowa's first river boat gambling operation. The 
nonprofit organization is representing Sioux City and Woodbury County, both 
situated near the state's western border. 
</P>
<P>
Fried describes the river boat idea as "a small theme park on the river" 
combining reverence for history and an escape from modern-day complexity. "To 
that, we're adding the intrigue of gambling -- something slightly naughty that 
appeals to most everyone," Fried said. "Combine those factors, and I think I 
have a chance to hit a home run." 
</P>
<P>
No one will be cheering harder for Fried than Iowa tourism officials. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the decade, the Iowa economy was hit hard by the agricultural 
recession, said Dennis Guffey, deputy director of the Iowa Department of 
Economic Development, which oversees the state tourism industry. Subsequently, 
state officials have actively sought to diversify the state's economy, 
emphasizing tourism. 
</P>
<P>
According to Guffey, such efforts led to a record $2.1 billion in tourism 
dollars in 1988. Now, Iowa officials are betting on river boat gambling to add 
to their success. 
</P>
<P>
"We've supported this from the very start and think it has the potential to 
become a huge industry for the state," Guffey said. Tourism expenditures from 
river boat gambling could pump $50 million annually into Iowa's economy and 
create jobs. In addition, the state expects to receive $5 million a year in 
taxes from gambling revenues. 
</P>
<P>
"River boats can bring to life the rich lore of the Mississippi, the Mark Twain 
era," Guffey said, and attract "people from across the nation." 
</P>
<P>
But not everybody in Iowa has been so receptive to the new venture. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it has taken more than three years to persuade the Iowa legislature to 
approve a bill permitting gambling river boats to travel on the state's 
waterways. And, until Republican Gov. Terry E. Branstad signed a bill into law 
on April 27, opponents, concerned that their state would become another 
Atlantic City or Las Vegas, vociferously objected to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition from groups such as the Iowa Alliance Against Riverboat Gambling 
fueled considerable political debate and apparently caused legislators to 
waffle on the issue. The House and Senate both rejected proposed river boat 
gambling legislation at least once during the past three years before finally 
passing a bill this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Getting the law passed was a major accomplishment for Fried and his partner, 
John J. Schegan. But many obstacles remained in their path. The partnership had 
to wait for individual counties to approve river boat operations and then had 
to compete against a handful of other prospective operators to win individual 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Besides serving Sioux City, the partnership hopes to win contracts to establish 
operations in Dubuque County and a region of Southeastern Iowa that includes 
the cities of Burlington, Ft. Madison and Keokuk. Winning contracts for those 
locations would allow Fried and Schegan to run river boats along the 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership still needs to receive a gambling license from the Iowa Racing 
and Gaming Commission, which is expected to issue such documents in March. The 
state legislation allows operations to begin in April 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"The toughest thing to overcome was trying to introduce gambling, even on a 
limited basis, into a 'pure' state like Iowa," said Schegan, who, with Fried, 
spent most of the last year crisscrossing the state to present their proposals 
before anybody was willing to listen. 
</P>
<P>
"Iowans don't like change," Schegan said. "They wanted to know if we had 
honorable intentions and whether we would live up to them." 
</P>
<P>
And what did Schegan and Fried tell Iowans? "We are creating an entertainment 
entity that offers limited gambling, not a gambling entity that has little 
entertainment." Schegan and Fried plan to offer hearty Midwestern meals from 
100-year-old recipes, music from the era and live theater. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the river boat gambling bill, which was passed with built-in 
restrictions, enforces the partnership's promise. Gamblers, for example, will 
be permitted to wager no more than $5 a bet and can lose no more than $200 each 
trip. In addition, only 30% of the river boat can be used for gambling. 
</P>
<P>
Other states, including Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio and Louisiana, are 
now considering river boat gambling legislation as well. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Fried and Schegan have recruited 14 investors, including singer Harry 
Belafonte, to raise money for their venture. The partnership expects to 
complete a feasibility study, required by the racing and gaming commission, by 
the end of the month. Once a license is obtained, the partnership will be 
seeking additional investors. 
</P>
<P>
Fried and Schegan plan to spend about $12 million per river boat and initially 
plan to build three vessels. Each of the vessels will be about 200-feet long, 
60-feet wide, four stories high, and carry 750 to 1000 passengers. Each boat 
will employ 300 to 350 workers. 
</P>
<P>
Although Franklin says he now knows plenty about river boats, he concedes that 
he never pictured himself as a gambling river boat operator. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Chicago, Fried, began his career in the entertainment business when he 
became an unemployed welder. 
</P>
<P>
"I was friends with the late Al Grossman (who later became manager of singers 
Bob Dylan and Peter, Paul and Mary) when he was first starting out in the 
entertainment business. I had just been laid off and he needed a gofer. I took 
the job." 
</P>
<P>
After gaining some experience, Fried launched Triangle Productions, a 
Chicago-based concert promotion firm that attracted big-name performers such as 
the Beatles and Frank Sinatra to Chicago's stages. A decade ago, his first 
wife's medical problems brought the couple to the West Coast and he moved to 
San Diego four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Fried was first introduced to a river boat when a business associate asked him 
in 1983 to join the board of the Delta Queen Steamboat Co., a New Orleans-based 
operator of two, overnight, luxury steamboats. Shortly afterward, Fried was 
asked to become president of the company. 
</P>
<P>
And that's when Fried fell in love with the river boat. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to get hooked when the paddle wheels start turning . . . you feel 
like you're going back to the turn of the century," Fried said. "It's a 
tremendous feeling. That's the charm of river boats." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Boston-born Schegan, 31, knew little about river boats. But, upon 
arriving in New Orleans on a hitch-hiking trip across the United States at age 
19, Schegan felt the river boat's lure. 
</P>
<P>
"I was intrigued by New Orleans, its rich history . . . and of course, its 
restaurants and bars," said Schegan, who began working as a pot washer in a 
restaurant in the city's French Quarter. "I wanted to become a great 
restaurateur." 
</P>
<P>
For the next several years, Schegan became involved in several successful 
restaurant enterprises. Then came the opportunity to work for the Delta Queen 
Steamboat Co. and to manage the Mississippi Queen. That's where he also met 
Fried. 
</P>
<P>
For a year, Schegan lived aboard the Mississippi Queen and traveled along the 
Mississippi 
</P>
<P>
"I got to see all these old historical cities," Schegan said. "You can imagine 
what kind of impression it left on a kid from Boston. It gave me a chance to 
find out how diversified America is and explore its past. 
</P>
<P>
"I became a time traveler." Schegan said.

PADRES' VALUE PLACED IN $100-MILLION RANGE; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: THE FOR-SALE TEAM IS REPORTEDLY WORTH MORE THANKS TO TV CONTRACTS AND 
A GOOD YEAR ON THE FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The San Diego Padres baseball team should fetch $85 million to $100 million, or 
at least $20 million more than what the team nearly sold for in early 1987, 
according to a nationally prominent appraiser of professional sports teams. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Matt, manager of appraisals and valuations at the Arthur Andersen &amp; 
Co. office in Dallas, said the increase in the team's value over the past two 
years is mainly because of the television contracts signed by major league 
baseball and the CBS and ESPN networks earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The new pact calls for each major league owner to receive an average of $13 
million a year over four years for national broadcast rights, starting in 1990. 
The payments, which are twice what owners were getting, greatly enhanced the 
value of all baseball teams, Matt said. 
</P>
<P>
Padres owner Joan Kroc announced Tuesday that she plans to sell the team that 
her late husband, McDonald's mogul Ray Kroc, bought in 1974 for $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
Kroc's son-in-law and player agent Jerry Kapstein is representing her in talks 
with several potential buyers. Kapstein was unavailable to comment Wednesday on 
the identity of bidders or on what sort of price the team might fetch. 
</P>
<P>
In arriving at his estimate of the Padres' worth, Matt said he factored in 
tangible concerns -- such as cash flow, the team's farm system, attendance and 
player salaries -- as well as intangibles, such as future prospects and image. 
Ultimately, the Padres' sale price will probably be figured as the current 
value of annual cash flows expected in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
A definite selling point for Kroc is that the Padres made a strong second-place 
National League West division finish this season, an indication that the team 
is a good bet for making it to the lucrative World Series playoff games in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing San Diego has going for it is a good nucleus of players," Matt said. 
"Their performance (this year) demonstrated they are a contending team. It's 
one of the intangibles that can have a very tangible effect on the bottom line. 
A contending team means higher attendance and more money." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' attendance of 2,009,000 this year was "about average" among major 
league teams but impressive in light of the size of San Diego's area of 
dominant influence, or ADI, a measurement of the market area served by a team's 
radio and TV broadcasts. San Diego's ADI ranks 24th among the league's 26 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Yankees, for example, drew only slightly more attendance 
(2,170,000) than the Padres in 1989 in a market area with four times the 
population of metropolitan San Diego, Matt said. 
</P>
<P>
The prices paid for the three other major league baseball teams that changed 
hands this year also had a bearing on Matt's price estimate. The Seattle 
Mariners, for example, were sold last month for a reported $80 million. The 
Baltimore Orioles sold earlier this year for $70 million. The Texas Rangers 
sold for $85 million, but the price included the team's home stadium and real 
estate, Matt said. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners were sold by George Argyros, the Orange County developer who 
agreed to pay a reported $65 million for the Padres in 1987 before the deal 
collapsed. Argyros had planned to sell the Seattle team and buy the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the two franchises comparable, Matt said he expects the Padres to sell 
for a "premium" over what the Mariners sold for because of the Padres' better 
performance this year. But a price of more than $100 million is "getting 
aggressive," he said. The Mariners drew 1.3 million in 1989, or about 700,000 
fewer fans than San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The generally favorable terms of the Padres' lease agreement with the city for 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium that runs through the year 2000 is another 
selling point for the team. According to Assistant City Manager Jack McGrory, 
the Padres pay the city a flat 10% of ticket sales revenues, but the team 
controls all concession sales. The city gets all parking revenues. 
</P>
<P>
All told, the city receives about $3 million annually from the Padres, McGrory 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Virtually every city has to make big concessions to keep their ball clubs. The 
free rent and large amounts of money that Sacramento and Oakland are offering 
the Raiders typifies the situation," he said, referring to the football team 
now in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres lease "would be considered a good deal for the city considering the 
climate in which the lease was negotiated in," McGrory said. For its part, the 
city received a 13-year commitment from the Padres to stay in town with no 
reduction in lease revenue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor in appraising a team is how much revenue the sale of local 
broadcast rights to cable, local TV and radio stations is bringing in. Matt 
said most teams get $3 million to $6 million from the sale of those rights. An 
associate of Kapstein's declined to disclose the Padres' broadcast revenue.

MAGAZINES: RX FOR HEALTH COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that your car insurance worries are over (it's hopeless, why worry?), along 
comes Hippocrates Magazine to give you anxiety attacks over health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
In its November-December issue, Hippocrates (soon-to-become In Health) gives 
health insurance the sort of thorough examination that earned the magazine two 
National Magazine Awards in its first two years. The prognosis, according to 
reporter Constance Matthiessen, is not good. 
</P>
<P>
Already 37 million Americans don't have health insurance, and each year a 
million more find themselves "going bare" -- insurance company slang for the 
uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, more and more claims are denied or tied up in review, more 
health problems are written out of polices and premiums are doubled or tripled 
when people get sick. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we are covered but we are all dangerously close to going bare," 
Matthiessen writes. 
</P>
<P>
Among the cases Matthiessen details are that of a family in Illinois whose 
young son ran up $225,000 in cancer treatment bills. Eventually, the insurance 
company effectively pulled the plug on the group policy it had sold to the 
small school where the boy's father was employed. Other insurers were reluctant 
to take on the school for one reason only: the little boy needs continuing 
cancer treatment. 
</P>
<P>
When a company finally did offer the school insurance, other employees wound up 
paying more to cover the boy's bills. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine presents a balanced package on both sides of the dilemma, with 
accompanying stories on getting the most out of health insurance and possible 
national health insurance legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The underlying message is pessimistic, though. As the mother of the boy with 
cancer says: "There is no insurance! They ought to give it another name." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Getting-Even List 
</P>
<P>
While other magazines have been busy compiling lists about each and every 
aspect of the 1980s, investigative humorist P. J. O'Rourke has quietly put 
together a meaningful list: A hit list. An enemies list. A McCarthy-esque smear 
list for the era. 
</P>
<P>
O'Rourke launched his "Call for a New McCarthyism" back in the July issue of 
the conservative American Spectator. America, he argues, is experiencing many 
of the same pleasures and benefits of that "excellent decade" the 1950s: "a 
salubrious prudery, a sensible avariciousness, a healthy dose of social 
conformity, a much-needed narrowing of minds. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But there's one delightful and entertaining feature of the Eisenhower years 
which is wholly absent from the contemporary scene -- old fashioned 
red-baiting." 
</P>
<P>
Traditional blacklisting is no longer effective, he writes: "Put some 
Sandalista on your blacklist and you probably guarantee him a MacArthur Genius 
Grant and a seat on the ACLU national board of directors." And besides, in the 
minds of O'Rourke and cohorts, pinkos are no longer the primary thorns in the 
sides of politically correct conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, O'Rourke's list catalogues not only lefties, but also people, places 
and things he and his compatriots simply believe hold "silly opinions on 
matters about which he or she is largely or abysmally uninformed." 
</P>
<P>
O'Rourke got the list rolling in July, with several dozen of his own fairly 
predictable nominees, including Sting, Norman Lear, The Christic Institute, 
Common Cause, Berkeley and Donald Trump ("OK," O'Rourke writes, "So he's not a 
real pinko, but I don't like him. And if McCarthyism isn't good for settling 
grudges, what is it good for?"). 
</P>
<P>
Then he threw the list open to reader suggestions. The first batch appeared in 
the Spectator's October issue and many more appear in the November issue. The 
magazine's readers prove themselves every bit as rude and insensitive as 
O'Rourke himself. 
</P>
<P>
Among the anointed: Whoopi Goldberg; Robin "I wish I were Whoopi Goldberg" 
Williams; "The geek who does the 'SNL News' on Saturday Night Live";"Michael 
Jackson, the radio talk show host, not the singer"; MADD; "Feminists who insist 
upon ragging patriarchy by retaining, upon marriage, their daddies' names"; The 
California Condor; and "Anyone who refers to the handicapped as 'differently 
abled.' I suppose the dead are 'differently vital.' " 
</P>
<P>
Also: Bob Barker; "The ideologically correct pronunciation masters: Nicaragua, 
in English, is knicker-rog-wa. And what's this Chee-lay stuff? I wonder how 
these people pronounce France?"; folk singers; poets; mimes; "any organization 
that is a 'Friends of . . . ' "; "all bemoaners of 'insensitivity.' " 
</P>
<P>
USA Today and the New York Times made the list in toto, but the Los Angeles 
Times fared rather poorly, with only Times cartoonist Paul Conrad, 
investigative reporter Robert Scheer and Washington bureau chief Jack Nelson 
singled out for contempt. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, several magazines made the combined O'Rourke-readers' list, among 
them: The Progressive, Tikkun, Mother Jones, The Humanist, The Nation, The 
Village Voice, Sojourners, and National Geographic. (Yes, National Geographic). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reasoned Defense 
</P>
<P>
Magazines of late have been lining up to take shots at indicted junk bond king 
Michael Milken, with Spy and Savvy Woman reflecting the diversity of the most 
recent assault. 
</P>
<P>
Now the tide may be turning. Life's special Fall issue on the '80s applauds 
Milken as one of five "original thinkers" who "helped reshape the way we see 
our world . . ." and the Santa Monica-based Reason Foundation, which publishes 
Reason Magazine, will honor Milken Monday as a "special guest" at it's annual 
banquet. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about this decision, Virginia I. Postrel, who became editor of Reason 
last spring, said she hadn't been consulted by the foundation. But she fired up 
the fax machine and sent copies of two articles published in Reason last year 
to explain that Libertarian publication's position. 
</P>
<P>
The basic premise of the first article, "Witchhunt,' is that the Security and 
Exchange Commission's insider-trading laws are antiquated, misguided attempts 
to create an economic "level field" where none can or should exist. 
</P>
<P>
The second article, "Hustler or Hero?" is a review of Connie Bruck's book on 
Milken, "The Predator's Ball." There's no doubt which side of the question the 
writer comes down on. Nor the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"With securities laws, what is happening is that people are being tried in the 
public eye for the crime of being rich . . ." Postrel said. "All the 
pontification and self-righteousness (surrounding the case) has been based on 
the idea that there is something wrong with people making money, so there must 
have been a crime committed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm willing to let the courts decide," whether Milken is guilty of crimes he 
has been accused of, she said. "He is not being honored at the banquet for 
being indicted, obviously." Rather, he will be applauded for creating new types 
of capital in his junk bond trading and for "opening the capital market to 
people who hadn't had access before. . . . That is a very honorable, 
entrepreneurial thing." 
</P>
<P>
The foundation banquet, with economist Arthur Laffer as guest speaker, will 
celebrate "America's Revitalized Economy." It remains to be seen whether the 
stock market will underscore or inject irony into that title. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In the Fast Lane? 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the men and women in the white coats have our number, Angelenos. 
</P>
<P>
We're last. 
</P>
<P>
Dedicated as ever to learning how humans tick, the folks at Psychology Today 
set out to determine "the pace of life" in 36 cities across America. Southern 
Californians' internal clocks, it seems, are a few beats behind. 
</P>
<P>
Utilizing such rigorous research tools as a stopwatch and tape recorder, the 
scientists spread out far and wide, clocking how quickly pedestrians walked 
along a city street; how long bank clerks took to give change; and how fast a 
postal clerk could explain the difference between regular, certified and 
insured mail. They also noted how many people wore watches. 
</P>
<P>
Then, to add even more legitimacy to all this, they threw in some meaningful 
figures about coronary heart disease and Type A and Type B personalities. 
</P>
<P>
So, like, we really are, you know, laid back, and all. 
</P>
<P>
Boston is the fastest-paced. Buffalo, N.Y., came in second. Then New York City. 
</P>
<P>
If you're impatient with the somnambulant pace of life here, though, there are 
plenty of fast-lane options. You could always move to frenetic Salt Lake City, 
which came in No. 4 on the list. Or into the throbbing chaos of Bakersfield, 
which was much higher on the list than El Lay. As was Chattanooga, Tenn. And 
Oxnard.

JACK SMITH: CHRONICLING DOG OF A WEDDING IN VENTURA SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johanna Overby, president of the San Buenaventura Friends of the Library, has 
sent me a fascinating clipping from the Ventura Star-Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
It is, at first glance, a routine wedding story, the kind that appear in the 
society, family or life-style section of every newspaper. It is told in the 
immemorial manner of such stories, in a style as sacred as Scripture, noting 
that the couple "exchanged nuptial vows" on a certain day, "with Pastor Gordon 
Rasmusson officiating." 
</P>
<P>
As wedding stories invariably do, it lists the family connections of the bride 
and bridegroom, and notes that the bride, who was given in marriage by her 
father, wore "an off-white tea-length Victorian lace dress." 
</P>
<P>
Also duly named are the maid of honor (the bride's sister), who wore "a light 
pink tea-length dress with white lace," and the bridesmaid, another sister, 
whose attire is not described. (I do not like to criticize a fellow journalist, 
but that seems a rather critical oversight, considering the general 
thoroughness of the story.) 
</P>
<P>
There were two best men, both named and identified as to places of origin. But 
it is the next paragraph that lifts this story out of the ordinary and makes me 
wonder whether, indeed, a new element has been introduced into this ancient 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
It reads: "Flower dog was the bride's golden Labrador, Trinity Lakee, who wore 
a pink wildrose collar while carrying a white calla lily bone down the grass 
aisle." 
</P>
<P>
The story goes on to list the bride and bridegroom's academic credentials and 
their current occupations. There is no further mention of the flower dog. 
Evidently the readers are to assume that a flower dog is a routine member of a 
wedding party, and that no explanation is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
I have all kinds of questions. Was the aisle grass because the wedding was held 
out on a lawn? Or was an artificial grass turf laid down in the middle aisle 
especially for the dog? 
</P>
<P>
Did someone lead the dog? Or had it been trained to follow the bride down the 
aisle? Was the dog a male or female? The name Trinity Lakee is ambiguous as to 
sex. I suppose, on the other hand, that it doesn't matter. Let's not be sexist 
about the flower dog. 
</P>
<P>
And what is meant by "white calla lily bone?" Is it an artificial calla lily 
with a stalk like a bone? Or a real bone with a calla lily sticking out of its 
end? Was the dog trained to carry the calla lily in its mouth? 
</P>
<P>
There is a photograph of the bridal couple sipping wine out of silver chalices. 
But Overby understandably asks, "Where was the photographer?" Obviously she 
means where was the photographer when the flower dog was going down the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
I must say that the reporter who wrote the story, even though he or she 
neglected to describe the bridesmaid's dress, showed a great deal of aplomb in 
dealing with the flower dog. He or she gave the dog no more or less attention 
than was its due as a member of the wedding: Its name, its attire, its relation 
to the bride, and its function. 
</P>
<P>
I'm afraid that if I had been assigned to cover that wedding I might have given 
a disproportionate account of the dog's presence, perhaps forgetting that there 
is only one star at any wedding -- the bride. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I wonder what the dog's role will be in the marriage when the bride and 
bridegroom return from their honeymoon in the Cascade Mountains and take up 
residence in Santa Rosa. Being the bride's dog, will Trinity (I hope I am not 
being too familiar) live with the newlyweds? Does the bridegroom have a dog? If 
so, will the two be compatible? 
</P>
<P>
Of course we read of all kinds of eccentric weddings these days. People are 
married in balloons. Nudists are married in the nude. I believe a couple were 
married not long ago underwater in a diving bell. It seems to me I've heard of 
a couple being married on water skis. 
</P>
<P>
What strikes me as being outre about the flower dog, though, is that in every 
other way this wedding was traditional. One senses that the guests were not 
astonished by the dog. 
</P>
<P>
Have I missed something? Are flower dogs now de rigueur? 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, I hope the three of them will be very happy.

The truth and nothing but: Former Secretary of State George Shultz said he 
doesn't expect everyone who reads his memoirs to be happy. "I have to tell it 
the way I see it, as I felt it at the time," he said. Shultz has contracted 
with Charles Scribner's Sons for a reported $2 million to write two books: one 
a memoir and the other on the art of diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
* Foiled: The computer showed no one won the $28 million jackpot -- the largest 
in the history of the Massachusetts lottery. So when Ralph Brunner, 25, of 
Newton, allegedly added the winning numbers to his ticket with a dot-matrix 
printer and tried to claim the prize, he was arrested and charged with forging 
a lottery ticket. "I guess he figured he was going to walk away with the 
money," lottery spokesman David Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
*Exemplary: Axel Hanson of Chippewa Falls, Wis., capped a perfect 72-year 
driving career with what officials called a rare act: voluntarily giving up his 
driver's license at age 88. "I figured at my age I might make a wrong move 
sometime or other," Hanson said. "I thought it was a good idea to give up my 
license for my own safety and for other people, too." 
</P>
<P>
* Dog days: Rowena Russell of Chesterfield, Mass., has had enough. Twice in 14 
months, dogs left in the cab of pickup trucks while their owners dashed into 
the General Store, uphill from her house, have knocked the vehicles out of gear 
and sent them careening into her yard. Russell has asked selectmen in her town 
to put up a barrier to protect her house, and they're sympathetic. "(What she's 
gone through) is a bit much," said Police Chief Gary Wickland. 
</P>
<P>
* Send it to the round file: Atheist Rob Sherman asked the McHenry County Clerk 
in Illinois to eliminate references to God on complimentary marriage 
certificates her office gives couples who wed. Clerk Rosemary Azzaro declined, 
saying the paper had no legal value and "if anyone objects, they can throw it 
away."

ARCHITECTURE: BUILDING ON OLD IDEAS FOR NEW TRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Driving the streets of San Diego's newest tract neighborhoods, one gets a sense 
of something missing. 
</P>
<P>
Sidewalks seem barren without the tree-lined, grass median strips common to 
older neighborhoods. Most of the new homes don't have porches, lessening the 
sidewalks' once-integral role in the social scene. 
</P>
<P>
And stylistically, the Mediterranean look has been done to death. 
</P>
<P>
But David Minter wants to change that. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, the architect and developer moved here from Austin, Tex., and 
one of his first projects was a speculative house in La Jolla. He chose the 
predictably safe Mediterranean approach, and the home sold quickly. 
</P>
<P>
But, during his first months in San Diego, Minter developed a love of the 
city's older neighborhoods and wanted to save that look and feel. He chose the 
developing community of EastLake as his venue. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary concept is that the street is part of the neighborhood and part of 
the house," Minter said. "We didn't want to turn our backs on it." 
</P>
<P>
The idea was to create a warm, traditional streetscape, with a progression of 
inviting landscape elements between the curb and front door: grass medians 
planted with trees (in this case magnolias), sidewalks, large front lawns, 
prominent porches. 
</P>
<P>
When he bought eight lots in Chula Vista, he and executives at EastLake 
Development Co. decided to try to capture some of this traditional warmth in a 
small new development called Augusta Place. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than hiring one of San Diego's top tract architects to do a few standard 
designs, Minter commissioned five of San Diego's best young architects. 
</P>
<P>
Because Minter was relatively new to town, he asked San Diego Home/Garden 
Editor Peter Jensen to recommend a few architects. From that list, Minter chose 
Ralph Roesling, Lee Platt, Mark Christopher, Barry Bell and Marc Tarasuck. 
</P>
<P>
Initial designs were finished during the summer, and Minter hopes to have the 
first homes -- with an average price of $500,000 -- on the market by fall next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
What's innovative is the concerted effort to create a strong sense of place in 
a brand-new development. 
</P>
<P>
He asked the architects to try to capture some of the charm of older houses. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't after architectural masterpieces, but a series of compatible 
homes," Minter said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the resulting designs are all distinctive, they share a sense of '30s 
traditionalism. 
</P>
<P>
"We're calling our design a 'super bungalow,' " Roesling said. "There's a 
strong emphasis on the porch and the connection of rooms." 
</P>
<P>
Though original California bungalows were less than 1,000 square feet and 
Roesling's house is more than 3,000, certain design elements have been 
effectively re-interpreted. Gabled roofs will have prominent eaves and exposed 
rafter tails. Indoor spaces will be married to porches, patios and views 
through the sensitive placement of windows and French doors. 
</P>
<P>
Minter asked each architect to give his home a signature design feature on the 
second floor, and Roesling responded with a pair of wide, curved dormer windows 
-- windows placed vertically on a sloping roof and with a roof of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Platt said his house is more of a blend of Prairie and Mission influences. It 
has exaggerated eaves like those used by Prairie movement founder Frank Lloyd 
Wright and smooth, stucco walls with carefully placed, deep-set window openings 
which echo the forms of California's missions. 
</P>
<P>
Front porches were mandatory, but Platt's is minimal, serving as a dramatic 
entry. Roesling's is the largest, in the tradition of San Diego's great 
Craftsman bungalows. 
</P>
<P>
With this project, Minter has made a progressive step by bringing fresh talent 
to a spec-built project. 
</P>
<P>
Though Minter's project is a breakthrough, it is also a disappointment in the 
limitations imposed on the architects. What could happen if the limits of 
creativity were stretched even further? 
</P>
<P>
Jensen, the editor, said, "There's a side of me that wants to see things pushed 
a little, to accept a window that's way too small, but it looks real good. Or a 
roof that kind of reminds you of 50 years ago, but it's very different. That's 
what art in architecture is all about, to show us something we haven't seen 
before, or to re-interpret it. I'll be interested to see if that happens here." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fascinated by David's (Minter) approach," Platt said. "I could see more of 
this in the future as people want more character in new communities. But 
marketing is not conducive to creative work. It tends to repeat past designs 
which have sold well. 
</P>
<P>
"I've thought for years that there's an unfulfilled demand for merchant-built 
housing that's not so traditional and directed. But that won't come out of the 
retroactive thinking which is a response to past projects." 
</P>
<P>
Roesling agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I sort of wish we hadn't been working in such a traditional mode. I wish we 
had had more flexibility in the home's outward appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"What would happen if a developer said, 'I want you guys to do real nice 
prototype tract homes,' and left it at that? What if he just let us work with 
the execution of the forms and materials? Why couldn't there be a modern house 
amongst traditional ones?" 
</P>
<P>
Minter's homes are still only in the paper stage. He's been pairing designs 
with lots and deciding which homes should be built next to each other. 
</P>
<P>
Landscape architect David Reed was hired to design an entry gate and a small 
park at the end of this cul de sac. This should serve as the neighborhood's 
focal point, a place for casual social gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
The architects were hired to do preliminary designs. Minter and his staff will 
translate these to working drawings and supervise the construction. Some of the 
architects fear that the fine materials they have specified -- ceramic tile, 
wood windows, heavy wood beams, interesting wooden doors -- will be axed when 
hard budgets are set, or that design details will be altered. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the actual quality of the individual homes, the final form of the 
entire 40-lot development remains to be seen. Minter's initial eight homes will 
seed the project, and he has an option on eight more lots. He'd like to design 
several more houses himself. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a positive step if the other five architects could also do 
additional homes, and if the 24 lots not controlled by Minter don't receive the 
kind of poorly designed speculative homes that have characterized places such 
as Fairbanks Ranch in North County. 
</P>
<P>
Detailed design guidelines being developed by EastLake and Minter will assure a 
certain level of quality, but good designs come from good architects, not 
speculative builders who might arrive on the scene hoping to turn a quick 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
The community of EastLake will eventually have about 9,000 homes. EastLake 
Greens -- the third phase, which includes Augusta Place -- will be formally 
announced today. It will include 2,700 to 3,000 homes by about a dozen 
builders.

LEGAL VIEW: THE GRAVE CASE OF THE MISSING BODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It almost reads like an episode of "L.A. Law" -- a lawsuit over negligent 
mishandling of a corpse. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the popular NBC television series did have an episode last season in 
which a wife successfully sued a funeral home because her husband's corpse was 
dismembered and shipped to various hospitals for research. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a real-life California Court of Appeal has heard a similar case and 
decided that close family members can sue for emotional distress when a funeral 
home misplaces the corpse. 
</P>
<P>
The factual allegations in the suit are not pleasant. Lupe Quesada died on 
December 9, 1979. His body was taken to the Santa Clara County Recorder's 
office for an autopsy and was then to have been transferred to a funeral home 
for burial. Instead, another body was delivered to the mortuary. 
</P>
<P>
The widow, sister and niece of the deceased insisted that the body was that of 
a stranger. But despite their protests, the stranger's body was buried in 
Quesada's grave. Five days later, the mix-up was confirmed, the stranger's body 
was exhumed and the body of Quesada was put in its proper place. 
</P>
<P>
The funeral home settled the suit filed by the wife for an undisclosed amount 
but contended that it was not liable to the sister and niece. 
</P>
<P>
One of the critical questions for the court was who had the right to sue. Or as 
Justice J. Ardaiz put it in his majority opinion: "In that the body itself 
suffers no legally recognizable damage by virtue of a defendant's claimed 
negligence, the question becomes to whom is the duty owed to abstain from such 
negligent behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Whether a result is foreseeable is a key component in determining how far to 
allow a tort recovery of this type. And the court concluded that those who have 
custody of the remains of a deceased should know that surviving friends and 
family will be emotionally vulnerable and may develop severe mental trauma if 
they are shown another person's body instead of the proper one. 
</P>
<P>
"Concerns about the loss or misplacement of the deceased's body, the failure to 
provide religious or spiritual rites to the deceased and improper interment of 
another would understandably preoccupy those close to the deceased," Ardaiz 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
But there are public policy concerns besides the foreseeability of harm. The 
court needed to set limits on who could sue and how extensive the emotional 
distress might be to warrant recovery. The court was reluctant, for example, to 
let anyone who attended the funeral file a lawsuit, especially in light of 
recent California Supreme Court cases that have limited the expansion of 
emotional distress-type claims. 
</P>
<P>
In one recent significant case, the California Supreme Court limited emotional 
distress claims to someone who is closely related to the victim, is present at 
the scene of the injury-producing event and suffers distress beyond what would 
be anticipated in a disinterested witness. 
</P>
<P>
Using that analysis as a base, this appellate court ruled that only close 
family members, usually (but not necessarily only) those residing in the same 
household, or parents, siblings, children or grandparents, could sue for the 
negligent handling of a corpse. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that the Supreme Court does not clarify this unusual case, the 
existing ruling would seem to make it difficult for the niece to win her case, 
but the sister has a better chance.

YOUR WHEELS: CARE OF BATTERY IS A SENSITIVE ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have owned many cars through the years that had maintenance-free or 
sealed batteries. I currently have two Fords with such batteries. In every 
case, these batteries have caps that can be pried off carefully using a small 
screw driver. I find that they occasionally need distilled water. In this way, 
a few minutes of my time and a little water has saved me $60 or more for a new 
battery. -- H.W.K. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The procedure you describe is not recommended by battery manufacturers, 
who have tried to design and produce batteries that alleviate the chore of 
keeping the water level up in a battery. Of course, those sealed batteries in 
many cases do fail for the simple lack of water that careful maintenance could 
prevent. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all 12-volt automobile batteries are so-called lead acid batteries, 
in which plates of lead are immersed in sulfuric acid. The lead and acid create 
electricity through a chemical reaction, which can be reversed when the car's 
alternator or generator recharges the battery. Eventually, though, water that 
is generated in the chemical reaction is lost to evaporation, which causes the 
plates to be exposed to air and to lose their effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Your effort to pry off the caps of the sealed battery is something that some 
mechanics admit they do on their own batteries, even though for the average 
motorist it can be unsafe. Battery acid is quite caustic and can burn the skin, 
not to mention clothes and paint finishes. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, battery manufacturers have designed maintenance-free 
batteries with different electrodes or plates, which results in less gasing and 
less fluid loss. So a maintenance-free battery is not simply an open-cell 
battery that has a cap over it, and it should not require as much maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My question regards my 1983 Mercury Grand Marquis L.S., which is just shy of 
100,000 miles. Until I reached about 85,000 miles, my gas mileage was about 16 
m.p.g. in mostly city driving. Then, almost at once, it dropped to about 12 
m.p.g. and then at about 90,000 miles went down to 9 m.p.g. This car runs 
beautifully, except for a minor loss of acceleration. I spent more than $800 
for tuneups and testing to find the problem. I have been told it could be the 
timing chain or computer, but I don't want to spend the money to fix those 
items unless I am sure that they are causing the drop in mileage. Can you shed 
some light on the problem? -- G.C. 
</P>
<P>
A: The drop in fuel economy is drastic, so you have a definite problem. Since 
it occurred over a 10,000-mile period, it is something that degraded slowly, 
rather than catastrophically. Of course, any one of dozens of problems could be 
causing the drop in mileage. 
</P>
<P>
Your Mercury has an electronic diagnostics system that operates through a 
central command computer. A qualified dealer should be able to determine if the 
computer has identified the problem already or if the computer itself is at 
fault. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility is that you have a dirty oxygen sensor. If the computer 
determines that the oxygen sensor has stopped functioning properly, it will 
automatically revert to what is called a default mode. In this mode, the 
computer sets the fuel injection system to an overly rich mixture that results 
in a drop in fuel economy.

ERMA BOMBECK: WHAT DOES MARRIAGE MEAN TODAY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Erma Bombeck is on a book tour. This Best of Bombeck originally appeared Jan. 
19, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One of the hardest things in the world to explain is the difference between 
being married and living with someone. 
</P>
<P>
As an advocate of orange blossoms and long mortgages, I usually end up throwing 
around a couple of high-class words such as commitment and responsibility to 
offspring. When my opponent tosses back such phrases as "Love doesn't need a 
piece of paper" and "Look how many people get stuck in unhappy relationships," 
I crumble. I don't have a good answer. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow I can't seem to put my finger on that elusive bit of intimacy that 
makes marriage "different." In both relationships, one shares the same 
bathroom, feeds the collective dog, eats together, shops together, sleeps side 
by side, and yet. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In a recent TV show, the widowed father no longer wanted to continue his 
relationship with a contemporary without marriage. She couldn't understand it. 
They were doing just fine the way they were. He looked at her and said sadly, 
"But we don't worry about things together." 
</P>
<P>
You have to be married to understand that line. Anyone can play house, but a 
couple struggling to pay for one is something else. A philosopher once said, 
"Marriage is our last, our best chance to grow up." He could be right. 
Everything up until the time you walk down the aisle has been polite, guarded 
and a little superficial. Returning from the altar is a different feeling 
altogether. You have not contracted for a temporary position; this is a 
permanent career. 
</P>
<P>
But there is something else. You have legally agreed to share equally in 
belongings, debts, closets, fidelity and children. There are defined duties: to 
respect each other, tell the truth, listen, take care of each other and be 
sensitive to individual needs. This isn't dating anymore; this is the major 
league of relationships, with surprises around every corner. 
</P>
<P>
We've gone through 3 wars, 2 miscarriages, 5 houses, 3 children, 17 cars, 23 
funerals, 7 camping trips, 12 jobs, 19 banks and 3 credit unions. I stopped 
counting slammed doors after 3,009. What do I have to show for it? A feeling of 
pride and contentment for having done something that isn't easy. A realization 
that there is someone outside of myself without whom I do not feel whole. Maybe 
the difference between living together and being married is that the former is 
a spectator sport and the latter is playing the game by all the rules. 
</P>
<P>
Marriage has no guarantees. If that's what you're looking for, go live with a 
car battery. As for fear of making a mistake, another philosopher said it all: 
"God help the man who won't marry until he finds a perfect woman, and God help 
him still more if he finds her."

QUAKE: THE BREAKING STORY; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: SAN DIEGO'S THREE NETWORK STATIONS SCRAMBLED TO PROVIDE LIVE 
COVERAGE OF DISASTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 6:35 p.m., Tuesday, as the most dramatic news story of the year unfolded in 
the Bay Area, KNSD-TV (Channel 39) was showing "Jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the evening, the local television news operations had to make tough 
decisions about coverage of the Bay Area earthquake. Television is the first 
source for information on major breaking stories, but there was little 
information available early Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The three local stations were faced with a variety of problems, and each 
handled them in different ways. 
</P>
<P>
For Channel 39, an NBC affiliate, the first and foremost problem was finding 
video. 
</P>
<P>
The NBC affiliate in San Francisco, KRON, was knocked off the air by a power 
outage. NBC was, in effect, blind. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 39's new 6 p.m. newscast further complicated matters. While channels 8 
and 10 were in their network coverage of the quake, Channel 39 was, to a 
certain degree, stuck doing a regular news-weather-sports newscast. Most of the 
newscast was dedicated to the quake, but Channel 39 was talking sports while 
people were desperate for more information about the quake. 
</P>
<P>
Then, at 6:30 p.m., Channel 39 -- with the options of staying live with no NBC 
video or using old CNN feeds -- decided to go to "Jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have any video," Channel 39 News Director Don Shafer explained. "All 
we could do at that point was talk about (the quake)." 
</P>
<P>
About 15 minutes into "Jeopardy," KRON finally returned to the air and Channel 
39 switched to the NBC network feed. 
</P>
<P>
But Channel 39 was not the only station faced with tough decisions. 
</P>
<P>
KFMB-TV (Channel 8) did something almost sacrilegious -- it bumped Dan Rather 
from the air. As events unfolded, Channel 8 switched back and forth between the 
network feed, anchored by Rather, and the direct satellite transmission from 
the CBS affiliate in San Francisco, KPIX. 
</P>
<P>
When it became clear that KPIX was on top of the scene, Channel 8 stuck with 
the KPIX broadcast, providing the most-interesting and up-to-date coverage from 
a local affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
"They were where it was," said Channel 8's news director, Jim Holtzman. "It was 
a matter of putting on the most complete information." 
</P>
<P>
KGTV (Channel 10), the local ABC affiliate, was not prepared to do a newscast 
at 5 p.m. because of the World Series telecast. When the quake knocked the 
World Series off the air, the network first put up a graphic, then switched to 
a sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
About 5:10, Channel 10 came on the air with a special report, and by 5:30, ABC 
was back on the air with the most complete network coverage, thanks to the 
crews and blimp already on the scene for the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Channel 10, most newsroom personnel were in the studio having a 
pizza party to celebrate the completion of a special program, which made it 
easy to mobilize the staff. 
</P>
<P>
At 8 p.m., Channel 10 broke into the network coverage for a half-hour local 
newscast that had been scheduled to air after the World Series game had ended. 
It might have been better served sticking with the network reports. 
</P>
<P>
One of Channel 10's lead stories in this segment featured reporter Michael 
Finney interviewing his mother. Equally irrelevant were interviews with 
commuters at the airport -- the obligatory attempts to localize the story -- 
and Channel 10 sports anchor Larry Sacknoff with Padre Tony Gwynn, on hand for 
the World Series, discussing structural damage at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
At 8:30, Channel 10 switched back to network coverage, but switched to a rerun 
of "Magnum P.I." at 10 p.m., when the network ended coverage to the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
At 11 p.m. Channel 10 returned with full coverage during its regular news show. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the evening, while each newsroom was deciding how to cover the 
breaking events in the Bay Area, they also were trying to figure out ways to 
get reporters to the area, to add that extra local touch. 
</P>
<P>
Channels 39 and 10 chartered a plane together and flew crews into San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 8 flew four crews up on Padre owner Joan Kroc's private plane. The 
flight was arranged by Channel 8 sportscaster and Padre broadcaster Ted 
Leitner, Holtzman said. 
</P>
<P>
All three were doing phone reports by late in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
To supplement the coverage, channels 10 and 39 also had crews drive to the 
area. Channel 39 sent its satellite transmission truck, which is now supplying 
video for its sister Gillett Communications stations, NBC and CNN. 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday morning, Channel 39 had four crews in the area. Channel 10 had 
sent two up on Tuesday night and sent a third crew Wednesday. One of the 
Channel 10 crews was due to return Wednesday, but, like the Channel 39 team, 
the rest are there for an indefinite stay. 
</P>
<P>
Besides general coverage, each station will be seeking any San Diego ties to 
events. 
</P>
<P>
"We go cover the news," Channel 10 news director Paul Sands said. "We try to 
localize the news." 
</P>
<P>
Channel 8's four crews were due to return to San Diego today, but two more were 
being sent up to replace them. Channel 8 also will keep its crews on the scene 
for as long as Holtzman sees fit. 
</P>
<P>
"They can do specific stories on items we ask for," Holtzman said. "KPIX has 
its own agenda. Plus it gives us a local presence. There are concerns for the 
local audience that need to be addressed." 
</P>
<P>
On public television tonight, as something of a supplement to local news 
coverage, KPBS-TV (Channel 15) has decided to air "Surviving the Big One: How 
to Prepare for a Major Earthquake" at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's independent stations, unlike their counterparts in Los Angeles, 
lack news departments and continued with regular programming.

SOVIET DIRECTOR AIMS FOR THE HEART WITH REP PREMIERE OF 'SLINGSHOT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Yescho, yescho, yescho!" insists Soviet director Roman Viktyuk, spinning his 
arm as he stares intently at actor John David Bland spinning actor Jon Matthews 
around in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
"More, more more!" Susan Laron swiftly interprets at Viktyuk's side. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Viktyuk, who speaks only Russian, nor the American actors, who speak 
only English, ever look at the interpreter -- only each other -- during 
rehearsals of "Slingshot," Nicolai Kolyada's play about a crippled dock worker. 
The play will have its world premiere at the San Diego Repertory Theatre on 
Sunday in conjunction with the Soviet arts festival. 
</P>
<P>
The show marks his first directing job in the United States -- and in English 
-- but Viktyuk said during a rehearsal break that working with a different 
language is no problem at all. 
</P>
<P>
"The principle of my directing and my work is from heart to heart," Viktyuk 
said through yet another interpreter, Raia Rechaim. "If I feel the heartbeat of 
the actors, then the language means nothing to me. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of all the people we were choosing," he said, 
</P>
<P>
referring to the actors, "these people, their nervous systems are so clear and 
pure that we can see them as if they were an X-ray. It is as though I am 
holding their hearts in my hand and their hearts are beating as if they are 
birds in my hands. 
</P>
<P>
"They still do not know how to fly yet, and I am not letting them go. Their 
little legs must get stronger. That should happen any day now. Maybe tomorrow 
or the day after tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the only part about working in America he loathes is the Actor's Equity 
rule, which gives actors 15-minute breaks every hour and a half. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate breaks," said Viktyuk. "As soon as the heart starts beating, as soon as 
there is a correct taking of breath, as soon as the eyes start shining . . . 
the stage manager says it is time for a break, and we have to start all over. 
When there is surgery, no one takes a break. If the nurses and the surgeon and 
the machinery just shut down, the patient would die." 
</P>
<P>
The gambles he takes, the choices he makes, have given Viktyuk the brand of 
being one of the most risk-taking directors in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
He knows he could have made his first directing job in the United States a lot 
easier if he had gone for well-known actors or even a well-known playwright -- 
which Kolyada is not. 
</P>
<P>
The artistic team at the San Diego Rep told Viktyuk they wanted to present "the 
best contemporary Soviet play." They were so certain from previous 
conversations with the director that his choice would be "Smirnova's Birthday 
Party," by one of his favorite playwrights, Ludmilla Petrushevskaya, that the 
offering was printed in the arts festival brochure before Viktyuk arrived in 
San Diego on July 29. 
</P>
<P>
But, typical for him, Viktyuk came into town with a surprise. An actor living 
in Sverdlovsk in the Ural Mountains had sent him a new play about an embittered 
33-year-old Soviet dock worker named Ilya, crippled in a work-related accident, 
who learns to love again through a troubled, but growing friendship with Anton, 
a teen-age boy, and Ilya's neighbor, Larisa (to be played by Mary Forcade). 
</P>
<P>
Viktyuk read the play just two weeks before his flight to the United States 
and, even though the writer had never been produced in Moscow or Leningrad, he 
was convinced that, in Kolyada's "Slingshot," he had at last found "the best 
Soviet play." 
</P>
<P>
He read it -- in Russian -- to the Rep's artistic director, Doug Jacobs, to 
producing director Sam Woodhouse and managing director Adrian Stewart, with 
simultaneous translation by Rechaim, and convinced them all that this was the 
play they ought to present. (Larson made the final translation used in this 
production.) 
</P>
<P>
"I read it at night," Viktyuk said of the play, "and I called him (Kolyada) in 
the morning, and I told him who was calling. There was a long pause, and then 
he started yelling, 'It is a dream!' " 
</P>
<P>
Viktyuk smiled at the memory. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be easier to take a well-known play, a classic, well-known 
experienced actors, and maybe even take a play that I did before," Viktyuk 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
"And then we would know what is going to come out. But here we don't know the 
way. We don't have the transportation. We must find our way with our own hands 
and legs. I like that feeling because in this danger is the heartbeat of life. 
If the machinery which checks the EKG waves is only a straight line, that is 
death. We need to make the zigzag line. Then we know we are alive." 
</P>
<P>
If risk is something Viktyuk feels comfortable in courting, it's mainly because 
he's had plenty of training: Danger has never been a stranger from the moment 
his life as an artist began. 
</P>
<P>
For years before glasnost lifted censorship in Russia, he directed plays that 
were closed by Soviet officials because of the way they mocked modern life in 
the U.S.S.R. Fourteen years ago, during the Brezhnev period, when "there was 
censorship of everything," Viktyuk said, he directed a play by Petrushevskaya 
at a university theater because her works were banned in official Soviet 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
The actors were not paid; the troupe took care of all expenses themselves. The 
production, which dealt with how proletarians turn to "the malevolent aspect of 
life" when finding no other emotional outlet, had an impact on critics -- which 
was not enough to save the show. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though all the press said the play was wonderful, the bureaucrats from 
the party closed the show and they closed the theater," Viktyuk said. 
</P>
<P>
The director and crew took the props and stage designs and fled to another part 
of the city. For 10 years, he and his friends performed underground, keeping 
the work secret from government officials. 
</P>
<P>
Then, all restrictions came undone under the Mikhail Gorbachev policy of 
perestroika. Still, Viktyuk's memories of the pre-glasnost era are, like much 
of his work, unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
"As funny as it sounds, it was the happiest time of my life, because we knew 
why we were doing this," he said. "This was our resistance to the official view 
of the arts in the Soviet Union. I just wanted to yell out the truth." 
</P>
<P>
In "Slingshot," Viktyuk hopes again to yell out the truth about the 
contemporary Soviet challenge of coping with housing and food shortages, as 
well as changing roles and relationships. 
</P>
<P>
He also sees it as a great opportunity for bringing Russians and Americans 
closer together. This play, as he tells his actors during one of many 
impassioned speeches, "expresses the Russian soul." 
</P>
<P>
As the actors come closer to capturing that soul in rehearsal, Viktyuk 
expresses increasing determination to have the American cast perform in Moscow 
when he premieres the play there in the spring of 1990. No visas have been 
acquired, but he refers to it as accomplished fact, explaining that he wants 
the production to be the same, using longtime collaborators Vladimir Boyer, as 
set designer and Ury Butsko, who wrote original music for the work. 
</P>
<P>
"I would love to have these three actors come to cold, wintry, snowy Moscow and 
with their hearts they would melt the hearts of the Russian people," said 
Viktyuk, who, in rehearsal, often refers to the male actors by the affectionate 
Russian diminutive Johnochka, and to all three by one of the few English 
expressions he requested to learn from the translators, "lovely children." 
</P>
<P>
"We only need these three hearts, and they will conquer any borders," Viktyuk 
said. "I feel there is a tremendous need for art to be taken to the Soviet 
Union so people can see that the Americans care about problems in the Soviet 
Union. Then they will know the American hearts are just as open and tender as 
Russian hearts."

Some of the best hybrid music to come from an American jazz guitarist is the 
Brazilian-flavored work of Pat Metheny. So it's not too surprising that one of 
the finer new albums by a Brazilian musician with strong American ties can be 
found in "Moonstone" by Toninho Horta, a longtime friend of Metheny.

Unlike musicians who casually borrow a bossa nova rhythm or entire Brazilian 
song, guitarist-vocalist Horta makes music that captures the light, pure spirit 
evoked by his Brazilian mentors: Jorge Ben, Joao Gilberto, Milton Nascimento, 
Antonio Carlos Jobim. Horta also names American guitarists Wes Montgomery and 
Barney Kessel as major influences, along with an unlikely source of 
inspiration: Henry Mancini. 
</P>
<P>
Horta, who plays the Bacchanal Wednesday on his first U.S. tour, blends these 
ideas seamlessly into his own sound. A prodigious composer, he wrote all but 
one of the songs on the new album. On guitar, Horta can finger-pick light, 
Brazilian rhythms on a nylon-stringed acoustic instrument or conjure jazzier 
Metheny-ish flourishes from his electric. At times, when playing acoustic 
guitar and singing in a warm, melodic voice, Horta calls to mind those great 
'60s collaborations between Gilberto and saxophonist Stan Getz. 
</P>
<P>
"Moonstone" is only Horta's second U.S. album, but he's a seasoned musician. He 
first came to this country in the '70s to work with Brazilian percussionist 
Airto Moreira and vocalist Flora Purim. He made an impression on musicians, and 
eventually played with Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Joe Pass, Paquito 
D'Rivera and others. 
</P>
<P>
While Horta's new album benefits from an all-star cast including Metheny, Onaje 
Allan Gumbs, Randy Brecker and Russell Ferrante, his road band for the current 
tour reportedly has been less than perfect, at times overpowering Horta's 
delicate singing and playing. Perhaps by the time they hit San Diego, they'll 
have made the necessary adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
Only rarely do San Diegans have a chance to hear today's equivalent of what 
used to be called "avant-garde" or "Loft" jazz. Until recently, there was no 
local venue for music not classifiable as either mainstream or commercial jazz. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the small RUSE Performance Gallery (447 5th Ave.) has been 
making a name by presenting unusual music and performances. 
</P>
<P>
Now RUSE has put together Ruse Fest '89, showcasing the best of cutting-edge 
culture. It is funded in part by a grant from the San Diego Arts and Cultural 
Commission. The festival will run seven nights: Oct. 20, Oct. 27 and Nov. 10-11 
and 16-18. The first two nights will feature jazz at the San Diego City College 
Theater (C Street between 13th and 15th streets), with half the proceeds going 
to KSDS, co-sponsor of the concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Jazz pianist Glenn Horiuchi opens the series Friday night with an original new 
program composed for Ruse Fest, titled "Burning Embers." 
</P>
<P>
"Because of my style, I don't get asked to play clubs that much," said 
Horiuchi, who can swing in the best tradition of straight-ahead jazz but often 
departs into the more abstract territory occupied by players such as Cecil 
Taylor and Ornette Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
There aren't many Asian jazz musicians, and Horiuchi brings an unusual blend of 
influences to his music. His grandfather performed and wrote traditional 
Japanese music, and, in the world of jazz, Horiuchi said he looks up to Taylor, 
Horace Tapscott, Horace Silver, Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane. His music, 
mostly original, often combines jazz references with Japanese rhythms and 
tonalities. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Horiuchi a delight to both neophytes and nit-pickers is his 
technical excellence. Whether he's playing a far-out improvisation or something 
in a more familiar vein, he produces a consistently intriguing series of 
melodic and harmonic explorations. 
</P>
<P>
Adding texture to Horiuchi's live performance will be Leon Alexander on drums, 
Francis Wong on sax and flute and Taiji Miyagawa on bass. 
</P>
<P>
"Burning Embers," a performance of brand-new material, begins at 8 p.m. Friday. 
For ticket information, call 236-1347 or 234-1062. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Jazz vocalist Cath Eckert and bassist Chris Conner perform this Friday 
night at 8 at Words &amp; Music Bookstore, 3806 4th Ave., Hillcrest. . . . 
</P>
<P>
New from Elario's: The club has added a $5 cover charge on weekends. The 
additional money will be used to maintain a top-notch jazz calendar and, 
occasionally, to foot the bill for musicians to use their bands instead of a 
local rhythm section. . . . Blues singer Jimmy Witherspoon is appearing with 
his red-hot band through Sunday. Witherspoon's second week at Elario's is in 
lieu of violinist Papa John Creach, who is touring with the rock group The 
Dinosaurs. Guitarist Gene Edwards and organist Roy Alexander are helping 
Witherspoon turn out some mean blues. A quote included by this writer in a 
feature story about Witherspoon last week was taken out of context: Witherspoon 
is quite comfortable financially, and even sports a gold Baume &amp; Mercier 
watch on stage. If you can't pronounce it, you don't need to know the price. . 
. . San Diego-based sax giant Charles McPherson made his first Elario's 
appearance in several years when he filled in one night recently for 
saxophonist Lou Donaldson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Peter Sprague and vocalist Kevyn Lettau will play Diego's Loft in 
Pacific Beach this Friday and Saturday. Clarinetist Bobby Gordon and trumpeter 
John Best will appear at the Loft this Sunday afternoon from 2 to 5. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Singer Elliott Lawrence and "Lites Out Jazz" founder Art Good are teaming up to 
present a two-day jazz seminar Oct. 24-25 in conjunction with the Learning 
Annex. Call 544-9700 to register in advance. The cost is $46.50. . . .

HINTS FROM HELOISE: SOME RULES FOR SELECTING SUITABLE DISHES, UTENSILS FOR 
MICROWAVE USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I've just moved into my first apartment, and I have a microwave 
oven. I'm really anxious to learn how to use it but I have one problem. I don't 
know which dishes, bowls and so on to use. How can I tell? 
</P>
<P>
 -- TED, Seattle 
</P>
<P>
DEAR TED: The two main things you need to determine about the suitability of 
dishes for microwave use are whether or not they are safe for a microwave and 
whether or not their size and shape are good for this purpose. 
</P>
<P>
First, don't use anything with gold or silver trim or anything made of metal. 
Microwave-safe materials include glass, ceramics, pottery, special 
microwaveable plastics and paper. Most products on the market now are marked to 
indicate the suitability for microwaving. Older items and those you're not sure 
of should be checked by the following method. 
</P>
<P>
To find out if a dish is safe, place it in the microwave and next to it place a 
glass measuring cup with one cup of water. Heat on full power for one minute, 
then check the temperature of the dish. If the dish is cool and the water is 
very warm, the dish is safe. If the dish is slightly warm, it can still be 
used, but only for very short-term warming. If the dish is hot, though, it's 
not for the microwave. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the way a microwave oven cooks, certain sizes and shapes do a better 
job than others. Food takes longer to microwave in a deep container than in a 
shallow one and often requires stirring. A shallow container exposes more food 
surface to the microwaves, so more of the food cooks at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Round and oval casseroles give more even results than square or rectangular 
ones. More energy penetrates the corners, so the food there is apt to overcook, 
giving you dried-out corners and underdone centers. 
</P>
<P>
Straight-sided dishes and pans are preferable to those with slanted sides. The 
straight sides keep the food at a more uniform depth and this provides more 
even cooking. In sloped dishes, the food on the edges receives more energy 
because it's not as deep, so it cooks faster and can overcook before the center 
is done. 
</P>
<P>
Ring-shaped pans are best for foods such as cakes and muffins that can't be 
stirred during cooking. The open center allows the microwaves to contact the 
food from all sides as well as top and bottom for more uniform cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Before you spend a lot of money on new cookware, experiment with the dishes, 
casseroles and bowls you have to see which ones give you the results you want. 
More than likely those you already have will do fine. 
</P>
<P>
Microwave ovens are great. Once you get the hang of it, you'll ask yourself how 
you ever got along without one. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: On Halloween I give the little ghosts and goblins that come to my 
house a toy instead of candy. The children get enough candy as it is and I feel 
better knowing that I have given them something different. 
</P>
<P>
I fill a large bowl with party-favor yo-yos, packs of baseball cards, balls and 
other inexpensive items that can be found in most grocery stores with the 
birthday-party supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- LINDA, Montville, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I have both an automatic drip coffee maker and an individual 
one-cup cone to use for single cups of coffee. I've found two tricks that 
really help me. 
</P>
<P>
To make the filters separate easily, I turn each layer inside out. The filters 
come off one at a time without a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
When I need a filter for the one-cup cone, I just fold a regular filter in 
half, then in half again. Open one side of it and you have a cone. It's much 
less expensive than buying the special cone filters. 
</P>
<P>
 -- AUDREY, Diamond Bar, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Since I have three small children, we always have several 
different kinds of cereal open at one time. The inner bags in the cereal boxes 
never roll down and stay shut so the cereal didn't stay fresh. Now when I open 
a box of cereal I pour the contents into a gallon-size zip-closing bag. We have 
crisp cereal again, plus it's safer from ants, weevils and cockroaches. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JEANETTE, San Angelo, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: This past summer we were plagued by tiny ants in our yard. This 
was not only annoying to us but to our cat, which did not appreciate their 
intrusion upon his food dish. 
</P>
<P>
We solved the problem by partially filling a shallow dish with water and 
placing his food dish in the center of it. The mini-moat effectively thwarted 
the ants until the pests were eliminated from our yard by the exterminator. 
</P>
<P>
 -- DOUGLAS, Newington, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I often buy lemon juice in the small disposable lemon-shaped 
juice bottles. When they are empty, I rinse them well and give them to my 
children. They fill them with water and drink from them while outside playing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- CATHY, Garland, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I had a family dinner at my home, and since my family is rather 
large we divided up what each family would bring. On my list was a tossed 
salad. 
</P>
<P>
I needed to make a lot of salad but didn't have a large bowl or anything to mix 
the salad in. So I came up with a great idea. I washed the vegetable crisper 
from my refrigerator and mixed the salad in it. It worked fine and the dinner 
was an event to remember. 
</P>
<P>
 -- DEBBIE GIBSON, Casper, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I enjoy making homemade deep-dish pizza. One thing I didn't enjoy 
was ending up with a soggy crust. 
</P>
<P>
So now before I add the filling to the crust, I sprinkle on some cheese. 
</P>
<P>
The crust is delicious and crisp now. 
</P>
<P>
 -- BETTY ELIZA, Billings, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR READERS: Diane Hampton of Hartford, Conn., wrote in and shared her 
substitute for zucchini bread. 
</P>
<P>
She uses yellow squash in place of zucchini and adds currants and chopped nuts 
to the recipe. The texture is great and it has a new, delicious taste. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: When you skin chicken parts before cooking them, don't throw the 
skin away. Boil it in lightly salted water, covered, for about 20 to 25 
minutes. Remove the skin and discard it. 
</P>
<P>
Pour the broth into a bowl and set it in the refrigerator. When the fat has 
hardened on top, remove it by carefully skimming it off. You now have a tasty 
and low-fat chicken broth.

</P>

NAPA VALLEY: WINE MAKERS, OFTEN ASSUMED TO BE A NO-NONSENSE LOT, POKE FUN AT 
THEMSELVES AND THEIR PROFESSION WITH HUMOROUS NEWSLETTERS, LABELS AND SLOGANS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some years ago, Bruce Cakebread was finishing up the harvest at Cakebread 
Cellars in the Napa Valley and found he had a lot of Cabernet Sauvignon grape 
pumice piled on the ground near his crusher. So he called Stu Smith of 
Smith-Madrone Winery. 
</P>
<P>
Smith owns a dump truck, and he needed pumice to use as compost for vineyard 
areas where the soil is poor. So he hauled off a number of loads, ridding 
Cakebread of his pumice without having to pay anyone to haul it off. 
</P>
<P>
The next day in the mail, Smith got a bill from Cakebread, saying, "Due: $100 
for prime Napa Valley Cabernet pumice." 
</P>
<P>
One day later, Cakebread got a bill from Smith, saying, "Due: $101 for hauling 
services." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
River of Jocularity 
</P>
<P>
The matter remains unresolved except to show some of the humor that can invade 
the business of making wine. It is a small river of jocularity that runs 
through wine country regions, but it's needed to maintain sanity when the 
pressures of harvest and other trying times wear nerves thin. 
</P>
<P>
Humor often is an unseen side of the wine business, which usually appears to 
most outsiders as if it's peopled only by the stiff, formal, tuxedoed and 
egotistical. Those who take pinky-pointing lessons. But any wine maker who 
stands ramrod straight and doesn't smile usually ends up the butt of 
inside-the-industry jokes. 
</P>
<P>
When I called Randall Grahm last week to talk about a story I was doing on 
humor in the wine industry, the owner-wine maker at Bonny Doon replied, "Going 
to be a short article, eh?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legendary Rutherford Bench 
</P>
<P>
But there is a sense of fun that occasionally pervades the wine business, and 
it was recently seen in the controversy surrounding the location of the 
Rutherford Bench, a geographical benchland region of the Napa Valley that 
supposedly has special qualities when Cabernet is grown in its soil. The 
boundaries of the bench remain a controversy among wineries and growers. 
</P>
<P>
But Agustin Huneeus knows where the Rutherford Bench is. It's in front of his 
Franciscan winery in Rutherford. Because of the controversy surrounding the 
location of the bench, Huneeus, president of Franciscan, installed a huge 
redwood bench in front of his winery and on it is a plaque proclaiming it as 
the Rutherford Bench. 
</P>
<P>
Such unstuffy approaches to wine are refreshing in an industry often swallowed 
up in recitations of gold medals and whose Chardonnay was served to the "Prince 
of Jabalalalala" at a recent state visit. 
</P>
<P>
The first person I think of when it comes to humor is Grahm. Much has been 
written about this guru of Bonny Doon of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Usually 
what's said is that Grahm is a certifiable loon who has wild hair. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Literary Puns and Linguistic Tricks 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, Grahm is crazy as a fox. The former philosophy student at UC Santa 
Cruz is a brilliant thinker, intelligent beyond most folks' understanding of 
the term, and a genius as a wine maker and marketer. (One glance at his 
marvelous winery newsletter gives you an inkling.) 
</P>
<P>
His latest newsletter begins with a parody of Edgar Allen Poe's "The Raven" 
entitled "The Maven." It is filled with enough literary puns and linguistic 
tricks to tickle an English professor. (There's even a parodied line from 
"Treasure of the Sierre Madre" buried in this concoction.) 
</P>
<P>
Bonny Doon's wine labels also are hilarious, more testament to his quick wit 
and his (accurate) perception that you catch more flies with honey than 
vinegar, or that you sell more wine with wit than with statistics. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason Grahm named one of his wines Le Cigare Volant, which in French 
means "flying saucer," after he learned that a French community had passed a 
law outlawing UFOs from invading. His Clos du Gilroy is named because his 
winery is "close to Gilroy." But, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Another of Grahm's ideas was to place the label for one of his wines with the 
type facing inside the bottle. And, using a play on the French term for top 
quality, Grand Cru, he labeled other wines Grahm Crew. The label for them is a 
photo of Grahm and his staff in a boat seeking a spot to land. The wines, by 
the way, are superb. 
</P>
<P>
To get on Grahm's mailing list, drop him a note at Bonny Doon Vineyard, P.O. 
Box 8376, Santa Cruz, Calif. 95061.

Wine From the World's Garlic Capital 
</P>
<P>
I visited Tom Kruse the other day. I had never met the man, but I have admired 
his sense of fun for a decade, and it was after this visit last Sunday that the 
concept for this story materialized. 
</P>
<P>
Kruse is the owner-wine maker at Thomas Kruse Winery here in the garlic capital 
of the world, and over the last two decades this former home wine maker turned 
commercial vintner has put out a lot of good wine. There's little that you 
would rate as nirvana, but they are good, sound wines at fair prices. 
</P>
<P>
The attractions have been the labels. They are a scream. 
</P>
<P>
The labels always have a text, but there's no florid prose extolling the 
virtues of the prismatic luminescence in the bottle. They are hand-written by 
Kruse, reflecting his thoughts of the day. In some cases, there are recipes for 
dishes, on others he muses about wine snobs. One has the title, "Wine Writers 
or Pontificating Parasites?" about whom he writes: 
</P>
<P>
"Whence this gaggle of gustatory gurus whose gossip and grandiose gushings 
grace our newspapers and magazines? Who are these people who write things like 
. . . 'a somewhat earthy aroma is redolent of a forest after rain, with scents 
of damp leaves, mushrooms and spice'? " 
</P>
<P>
Once, in 1977, Kruse had the effrontery to make a wine from 100% Thompson 
Seedless grape, the table grape variety with no discernible aroma or taste. The 
wine had the proprietary name of Chutzpah, the Yiddish word for gall, and his 
label said the wine's aroma was "pleasantly innocuous and the flavor distinctly 
evanescent if present at all. This wine goes good with practically nothing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buy Six Bottles, Get Six Free 
</P>
<P>
In his 10x10-foot tasting room, Kruse sells olive oil and pasta besides wine. 
There is a sign with the prices of the wines, and underneath, "50% case 
discount." 
</P>
<P>
"That means," he said, as if someone couldn't figure it out, "that if you buy 
six bottles, you get another six free. You wouldn't believe how many people 
don't figure this out. Now, if someone has six bottles on the counter and I 
like the guy, I tell him, 'Hey, you can have six more bottles free.' 
</P>
<P>
"But if he's a jerk, well, I just write it up as six bottles and carry the wine 
to his car." 
</P>
<P>
Kruse, an English major at Northwestern University, moved after college to San 
Jose, a half hour north of here, and began making wine at home. He was a real 
estate broker and sold wine-making supplies before turning, in 1971, to Gilroy. 
</P>
<P>
He bought a small farm and built a winery. Today it's a veritable Fibber 
Magee's closet of disorganization, but it works efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
He buys almost all the grapes he makes into wine, his one acre of vineyard land 
bearing only three tons of French Colombard. Ninety-five percent of his 
4,000-case production is sold out of the tasting room. He will sell mail order 
too (4390 Hecker Pass Road, Gilroy, Calif. 95020; (408) 842-7016). 
</P>
<P>
Prices for his wines are fair, including attractive $10 Chardonnay, $10 
Cabernet and a fine $7 Riesling. His aptly named Insouciance (it means 
carefree) is a sparkling wine made from Pinot Noir. The flavors are excellent; 
the wine soft and faintly sweet. It's $12. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Start a Winery 
</P>
<P>
Some Kruse wines are not labeled with the vintage, even though they are 
entirely of the same year, because Kruse dislikes re-submitting labels to the 
federal government for approval each time one little thing is changed. 
</P>
<P>
On one label, Kruse gives advice on how to start a small winery: "Put the 
winery on a hill, difficult to get to; visits should be by appointment only; 
the wine maker should be aloof, haughty, arrogant and must never be observed 
exhibiting unrestrained mirth. The wines should be tannic, acidic, over-oaked 
and unpleasant. Grotesque caricatures of the variety. 
</P>
<P>
"Last and perhaps most important, price the wine obscenely -- somewhere around 
a dollar a sip. 
</P>
<P>
"Wait a minute. I think I went wrong somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Humor can be seen in artifacts of the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Frog's Leap Winery in the Napa Valley was named as a sort of takeoff on 
Stag's Leap, which had won international fame for its Cabernet Sauvignons. Wine 
maker John Williams at Frog's Leap uses corks imprinted with the word ribit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nearby, Folie a Deux winery was founded by Larry Dizmang, a psychiatrist, 
and his wife, Evie, a clinical social worker. The name of the winery is the 
medical term used to describe two people who share the same delusion. In this 
case, it's making fine wine. (But it's no delusion: the wines are excellent.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gundlach-Bundschu has put out numerous hilarious posters, one showing a 
vintage automobile stopped by a policeman, whose foot is on the running board. 
The caption is, "If you can't pronounce Gundlach-Bundschu Gewurztraminer, you 
shouldn't be driving." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Sure Cure for Snobbery 
</P>
<P>
 -- Weibel Vineyards' had an advertising campaign three years ago that said we 
should stamp out wine snobbery. At wine festivals, winery personnel showed up 
wearing doctor's smocks with signs that said, "We can cure you of wine 
snobbery." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rabbit Ridge Winery is not named for the rabbits on the property in western 
Sonoma County. Wine maker/owner Erich Russell, who is also the wine maker at 
nearby Belvedere, was a star cross country runner in high school, "and they 
called me Rabbit," said Russell. "When I enrolled at San Jose State, I was on 
the track team with Tommie Smith, John Carlos and Lee Evans -- basically the 
whole (1968) U.S. Olympic track team, and my nickname became the White Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
 -- David Bruce made an awful 1976 Cabernet from Monterey County grapes. The 
wine was recalled from store shelves when it grew worse in the bottle, and 
Bruce chose to sell it through his newsletter. At $12 a case. A flyer on the 
wine said it smelled like rotting weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Andy and Debra Cutter's Duxoup Wine Works in Healdsburg was named after the 
Marx Brothers' movie "Duck Soup." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Chateau La Feet of California' 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Houlihan, who markets the reasonably priced line of Barefoot Bynum 
wines, uses the slogan, "The Chateau La Feet of California." 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the mid 1970s, Monterey Peninsula Winery made some Zinfandel called 
Stomp, which was crushed by human feet. Authorities said such a practice is 
unhealthful (although it's been done that way for thousands of years), and they 
prohibited the winery from selling the wine. As wine. Instead, Monterey 
Peninsula relabeled the wine to read "Souvenir Value Only, Not For Human 
Consumption." (Some people actually risked their health by consuming it. It was 
excellent.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Saintsbury Winery produces Pinot Noirs that are like those of the Beaune 
region of Burgundy. So the owners of the winery, Dick Ward and David Graves, 
produced T-shirts that sports a Springsteenian line: "Beaune in the U.S.A." 
</P>
<P>
One of the funniest guys in the wine trade is Mike Lynch, wine merchant with 
Pacific Wine Co. in San Francisco. The text of his newsletter always ends with 
a slogan for the month, such as the following that have appeared in the last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Pacific Wine Co.: We took the 's' out of swine." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Just because we smell well doesn't mean we smell good." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Where ignorance really is bliss." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dream Was to Become a Soda Jerk 
</P>
<P>
The text of the Pacific Wine Co. newsletter is, charitably speaking, off the 
wall. An example: "As a child Dick Ward had modest ambitions. All he wanted in 
life was to become a soda jerk, and today half of that dream has come true." 
</P>
<P>
A recent item from Lynch: He wrote that while dining with some French friends 
in Beaune, he decided to order the wine in a French restaurant, "even though my 
command of the language was rudimentary at best." He placed an order, "and the 
waitress's face registered surprise. Then she placed her head on my shoulder 
and said, 'Kiss me, Eddie.' 
</P>
<P>
"She then verbally abused her chef while signing what appeared to be a false 
income tax return and then lay down in the center of the room perfectly still. 
</P>
<P>
"I was embarrassed, and then she explained that instead of ordering the wine I 
had actually asked her to do her impersonations of Topo Gigio, Leona Helmsley 
and Ferdinand Marcos." 
</P>
<P>

Co., 124 Spear St., San Francisco 94105.

<P>
Cutting Through the Wine Mystique 
</P>
<P>
Another wine crazy in the retail trade is Gerald Weisl of Weimax in Burlingame. 
"The wine business is too full of mystique and bull, so we try to cut through 
some of that," said Weisl. 
</P>
<P>
His pun-filled, cartoon-graced newsletter is a riot, as is the shop (one 
particularly buttery Chardonnay in his shop is displayed under a sign of a 
butter carton). The cover of the recent newsletter has a drawing of a guy 
holding a wine bottle for a bat and the caption is "a Leoville Slugger"). 
</P>
<P>
Weisl often does curious stuff, such as publishing a wine horoscope ("Virgo: 
Avoid subscribing to Portuguese investment letter called Dao Jones.") 
</P>
<P>
Weisl also suggests what the new names of wineries would be if they merged with 
other wineries, such as if Frog's Leap and Silver Oak merged, the new name 
could be Silver Croak; if Hallcrest and Montevina merged, the new name would be 
Monty Hall; if Amador Foothill and Clos du Val merged the new name would be 
Clos du Dor. 
</P>
<P>
"And if Raymond moved to Alaska, the winery would have to be renamed Raymond 
Burr," said Weisl. 
</P>
<P>
To get mailers from Weimax, send a note to 1178 Broadway, Burlingame, Calif. 
94010. 
</P>
<P>
Humor often is up front, on wine labels. Here are a few examples: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bill Wheeler, owner of William Wheeler Winery, put out a wine in 1987 
called a Nicely Balanced Little Chardonnay. The wine's cartoon-like label had a 
picture showing the vintage date, 1984, falling off a tightrope. A companion 
wine, a Full-Bodied Little Zinfandel, had a caricature of "a heavy-set woman 
sitting on one of those little ice cream parlor chairs. The original artwork 
must be worth millions today," said Wheeler, who says he drew the label designs 
and frankly doesn't know where the originals are. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The 1985 Nalle Zinfandel, produced by Doug Nalle, carried on its side label 
this homage to waiters at chi-chi restaurants who like to introduce themselves: 
"Hi, my name is Zinfandel, and I'll be your wine tonight. May I suggest our 
pasta special or perhaps the pepper steak or cassoulet?" 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Ed Masciana, national marketing director for HMR Ltd., created a 
second label wine, 1981 Santa Lucia Cellars Burgundy, that had a label designed 
to look like the wine label on wines of the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, "as 
close as we could get, anyway," said Masciana recently. Some people thought the 
wine, which was selling for $5 a bottle (a tenth the price of Romanee-Conti), 
was hilarious. But not the people at Romanee-Conti. They got a temporary 
restraining order halting the sale of the wine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discovering the Formula for 'Fresca' 
</P>
<P>
Some years ago, a San Joaquin Valley winery, intending to make Sangria by 
blending flavorings into a tank of red wine, accidentally blended the flavors 
into a tank of sweet Sauterne. The wine maker responsible said the result was a 
financial disaster, "But I think we accidentally discovered the formula for 
Fresca." 
</P>
<P>
And to conclude, the Napa Valley has its share of wild folk, such as Bo 
Barrett, wine maker at Chateau Montelena. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett's annual tradition to celebrate the crushing of the last load of grapes 
each harvest season took place a week ago Wednesday when the cellar crew and 
picking crews staged a giant water fight in front of the winery. Even folks 
working in the winery's offices and some surprised tourists got wet.

CHOOSING WISELY AMONG THE MANY COOKING OILS 
</P>

Shopping for a cooking oil can be confusing. Which is the most healthful to 
buy? Are monounsaturates better than polyunsaturates? What about cholesterol? 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of vegetable oils have created a state of cholesterol confusion," says 
Janet Helm, a contributor to the Environmental Nutrition newsletter. "All 
vegetable oils are cholesterol-free, since cholesterol is only found in animal 
foods." 
</P>
<P>
Even though vegetable oils don't contain cholesterol, some -- like coconut, 
palm and palm-kernel oil -- supply saturated fat "which boosts levels of 
cholesterol in the blood," says Helm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mixtures of Fatty Acids 
</P>
<P>
Oils are a mixture of three types of fatty acids: saturated, monounsaturated 
and polyunsaturated. 
</P>
<P>
When more than one-third of the fatty acids in an oil are saturated, the oil 
itself is considered to be a saturated oil. When less than one-third of the 
fatty acids are saturated, the oil is considered unsaturated. 
</P>
<P>
Unsaturated oils are classified into: 1) polyunsaturated oil, which includes 
safflower, sunflower, corn, soybean and cottonseed oils, and 2) monounsaturated 
oil, which includes olive, peanut and canola oils. 
</P>
<P>
The most important consideration when choosing a cooking oil is the amount of 
saturated fat the oil contains. Oils low in saturated fat are more healthful. 
For example, corn oil (mostly polyunsaturated fat) and olive oil (mostly 
monounsaturated fat) can be used for healthful cooking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recommended Levels 
</P>
<P>
The American Heart Assn. recommends that no more than 30% of the calories you 
eat come from fat. Of that 30%, less than 10% should be saturated fat, with the 
remainder divided between polyunsaturated fat and monounsaturated fat.

WINE NOTES: FRENCH-AMERICAN VINTAGES NEWEST ENTRY IN THE POP-PREMIUM CATEGORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the so-called pop-premium category of wines evolves into adolescence, a new 
level of these moderately priced wines is hitting store shelves: the 
French-American blended wine. 
</P>
<P>
Wines carrying the Clos Ste. Nicole label -- a Chardonnay, a Cabernet Sauvignon 
and a Merlot to be sold for $5 a bottle -- are now being shipped. 
</P>
<P>
The wines are all blends of French and American wines, the first such varietal 
wines to be made. (A previous French-American venture, the Christian Brothers' 
Montage Chardonnay and Montage red Bordeaux-Cabernet, were not varietally 
labeled.) 
</P>
<P>
The Clos Ste. Nicole wines, which technically are a second label of the 
successful Domaine St. George wines, are all well made and offer good quality 
for the money. The best of the three is the Cabernet Sauvignon, which is 75% 
French Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% "red wine of California." The aroma is 
typically Cabernet-like, with richness not often seen in wines selling for $5. 
</P>
<P>
The Chardonnay is an interesting wine, composed of 75% French Chardonnay and 
25% Semillon, a blend not unlike some of the better Australian wines imported 
to the United States in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
The Chardonnay is fragrantly apple-like in both aroma and taste; and though 
there's little finish in the wine, it is clean as a whistle and compares 
favorably with similarly priced wine now coming in from France and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The Merlot (95% from France with 5% California Cabernet) is pleasant but not as 
good a wine as the Cabernet. 
</P>
<P>
The French Chardonnay and Cabernet both came from the Aude district of France, 
one of the largest growing regions in that country, in the Midi. The Merlot 
comes from Languedoc-Rousillon. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Wells, a spokesman for Cannon Wines in San Francisco, which is marketing 
the Clos Ste. Nicole wines, said that getting label approval from the Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at BATF confirmed that it took months to work out the proper 
wording for the label. The legal statement at the bottom notes that the wine 
was "blended and bottled by" the winery in Healdsburg. 
</P>
<P>
The French wine was produced at Benoit Fortant Winery in Sete, which Wells said 
was a state of the art winery near Montpellier. The first shipment of Clos Ste. 
Nicole, about 22,000 cases, will be made up of about 13,000 cases of Chardonnay 
and the remainder split between the two red wines. 
</P>
<P>
The demand for varietally designated wines called Chardonnay, Cabernet and 
Merlot is growing, and in the last few months more and more such varietal wines 
are appearing from French firms that once shipped wines called by proprietary 
designations. That has produced the interesting phenomenon of companies that 
once shipped attractive wines here called Macon Blanc now shipping in wine 
called Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
The French Cabernet that I have seen coming in at the pop-premium price level 
($4 to $6 a bottle) is from the Midi or other non-prestige areas of France; 
some Bordeaux also are being seen at that price. 
</P>
<P>
Also, more and more Italian Chardonnay is coming in at pop-premium prices. 
However, much of the Cabernet from Italy is priced at $12 to $20. 
</P>
<P>
The 13th California Wine Patrons banquet, scheduled for Nov. 20 at the Regent 
Beverly Wilshire Hotel, is also being held this year to announce the formal 
opening of the California Wine Exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Science and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
The wine exhibit, more than a decade in the planning, should be open before the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The black-tie dinner is a fund-raising event for the exhibit, which pays honor 
to Hernando de Vos Courtright, wine collector and hotelier who died in 1986. 
Tickets to the banquet are $175 per person. For details, contact Carol Tanaka 
at (213) 744-7493. 
</P>
<P>
Wines and Vines Magazine has selected Bob Thompson to receive its award for 
Excellence in Wine Writing for 1989. Thompson, 54, is a Napa Valley resident 
who has written dozens of wine books and is a wine columnist for the San 
Francisco Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
Wines and Vines also announced that it has chosen Andre Tchelistcheff to 
receive its Wine Man of the Year Award for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The presentation will be made to the 88-year-old still-active enologist at a 
banquet during the Jan. 26-27 Wine Industry Technical Symposium, conducted by 
the magazine, at the Red Lion Inn in Rohnert Park in Sonoma County. 
</P>
<P>
The Robert Mondavi Wine and Food Center in Costa Mesa opened its doors two 
weeks ago with a series of luncheons and dinners. 
</P>
<P>
The facility, which will focus on functions for corporate groups, has a major 
kitchen for gourmet dinners that are matched with Mondavi wines. The kitchen 
also is to be used for cooking demonstrations. The building has tasting and 
meeting rooms as well. 
</P>
<P>
The 10,000-square-foot facility will be the site of concerts and art exhibits. 
The first of a series of rotating collections of art is that of Beniamino 
Bufano, the late San Francisco artist and sculptor. The work now at the center 
includes a wide selection of sculptures. Art exhibits will change four times a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The Mondavi winery technically is a tenant of the building that was constructed 
by the C. J. Segerstrom family, owners of the Gateway Center, and customized 
for Mondavi's use. A spokesman for the Mondavis said he wasn't certain of the 
term of the lease, "but we're here permanently," he said.

NOISE PLAN UNDER FIRE AT AIRPORT; 
</P>
<P>
REGULATIONS: THE LATEST CITY ATTEMPT TO REGULATE LONG BEACH AIRPORT -- BY 
LIMITING TOTAL AIRPLANE NOISE RATHER THAN THE NUMBER OF FLIGHTS -- IS ALREADY 
BUCKING HEAD WINDS OF OPPOSITION. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly one year after a federal judge struck down its airport noise control law 
as unconstitutional, the City Council has given tentative approval to a new 
ordinance that already has residents, businesses and airlines kicking. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed law would impose no limit on the number of flights that take off 
and land at Long Beach Airport, as has been the city's custom since 1981. 
Instead, it would restrict the average amount of aircraft noise generated in 
one year to 65 decibels -- the approximate equivalent of an office with a 
clacking typewriter and several telephones ringing. 
</P>
<P>
Experts said the proposed ordinance probably would hold total airport noise to 
its current standard of 65 decibels. 
</P>
<P>
But initial reviews were less than glowing from homeowners who are demanding 
strict flight quotas and from airlines that are resisting restrictions 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"Women with children and older men in Bixby Knolls alone are prepared to carry 
picket signs right down at the airport. We are prepared to generate a boycott 
of the airport," vowed Tom Housel of the Community Airport Council, a newly 
formed homeowners action group formed to fight for airport noise limits. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not consulted one iota, we wouldn't agree to it one iota and it is not 
going to stop any lawsuits," John J. Lyons, lead attorney for several airlines 
currently suing the city, warned at Tuesday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The already-controversial ordinance is the product of seven years of litigation 
started by Alaska Airlines and ended by a Nov. 18 ruling issued by U.S. 
District Judge Laughlin E. Waters in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Waters held that the City Council's limit of 32 flights a day was arbitrary, 
that it discriminated against airlines, burdened interstate commerce, violated 
federal laws and failed to consider new technology that makes airplanes 
quieter. 
</P>
<P>
The judge raised the daily flight quota to 40 and ordered the city to come up 
with a new ordinance that would control noise without limiting flights. 
</P>
<P>
The city is appealing the ruling in an attempt to reinstate the old flight 
limit. Meanwhile, however, it must present to the judge on Nov. 13 an ordinance 
that abides by his order. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless and until someone tells the district judge that his order is wrong, we 
have to live with it," said Lee Blackman, a private attorney who represents the 
city in the airlines' lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
After a year of research and more than 1,200 pages of data, the city attorney's 
office this week presented the council with two proposed ordinances: one that 
would limit the average yearly aircraft noise to 65 decibels and another that 
would allow more noise by insulating homes to make them sound-resistant. 
</P>
<P>
Council members flatly rejected any notion of soundproofed homes, which the 
judge had ordered them to consider. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't soundproof a back yard. You can't soundproof a playground," 
Councilman Jeff Kellogg sniffed. "The federal judge has put us in a box if you 
will. What we are trying to do is maneuver." 
</P>
<P>
But some officials say the proposed law probably would prevent any increase in 
noise because the airport is already held to the 65-decibel limit and 
occasionally exceeds it. It would mean, however, that the number of actual 
flights could exceed the current limit of 40 as long as they were quiet enough 
to stay within the yearly quota. 
</P>
<P>
"Presently the total noise is a little more than that," said Deputy City Atty. 
Roger P. Freeman, an author of the proposed ordinance. "The idea is that there 
not be any more noise." 
</P>
<P>
The 65-decibel limit is only an average. Daytime aircraft noise could rise to 
as high as 101.5 decibels, one decibel less than the current limit. Nighttime 
restrictions would be the same as those currently imposed -- 79 decibels 
between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The new law would allow a slightly higher limit of 85 decibels from 10 to 11 
p.m. and from 6 to 7 a.m., however, to allow pilots to ease into the night 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
If passed, the law would provide for fines of up to $1,000 after the fourth 
offense and would increase by $1,000 for every offense thereafter, a schedule 
some pilots complained could bankrupt a small plane owner while a major airline 
would scarcely feel the pinch. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed law is subject to revision and community comment before it goes 
back to the council Oct. 31 for more discussion and, possibly, a final vote. 
</P>
<P>
But tempers were flaring before it won even preliminary approval, suggesting 
that it will travel a turbulent course before it could become law. 
</P>
<P>
"We will never turn this city back into an Iowa cornfield," Lyons, the 
airlines' attorney, snapped. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't share, because this is in litigation, how offensive I find your 
remark," District 7 Councilman Ray Grabinski said. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance was tentatively approved by unanimous vote with District 9 
Councilman Warren Hardwood absent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHAT'S NEXT: 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance will come before the City Council again Oct. 31 for a 
second reading, giving concerned parties the opportunity to suggest revisions 
and to comment. If no revisions are made, the council will probably take a 
final vote. If passed, it is subject to review by U.S. District Judge Laughlin 
E. Waters on Nov. 13. If approved by the court, the measure would become law 30 
days after the council's final vote.

PARKS TAX PROPOSAL SHELVED BY COUNCIL 
</P>

<P>
A proposal to increase local property taxes to pay for expanded recreational 
programs in this city's parks was sent to committee for long-term storage after 
it became obvious that supporters lacked the City Council votes to put it on 
the ballot for a citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
While the council endorsed the idea of more recreational programs for youths 
and the elderly, even some of the proposal's proponents conceded the timing was 
wrong to ask city voters to approve a special levy. 
</P>
<P>
Back in committee, Councilman Clarence Smith said the measure could be 
"massaged" into something more acceptable, while advocates attempt to 
orchestrate support for it. 
</P>
<P>
The product of more than a year's work by the city Recreation Commission and 
the council's Quality of Life Committee, the proposal would have raised $8.2 
million a year in additional property taxes. Most of the money would have come 
from residential levies ranging from an extra $38 to $71 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The extra money was to pay for more free recreational programs at more than 80 
school and park sites citywide, more maintenance and more park security. 
</P>
<P>
During several hours of discussion, councilmen railed against higher property 
taxes, crime and one another. 
</P>
<P>
Vice Mayor Wallace Edgerton, saying he was wholly opposed to the measure, 
insisted that it was an end run around the state's tax-limiting Proposition 13. 
"This is not an issue of who's going to support the children. The issue is the 
property tax. It's the easiest thing for local politicians to go to. Increase 
the property tax, increase the property tax," he mimicked. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Councilman Ray Grabinski retorted, Edgerton advocates increasing the 
property tax to expand the police force. 
</P>
<P>
Talking at length about society's neglect of children, Grabinski argued that 
residents should be willing to pay for programs to help youngsters avoid drugs 
and crime. In years past, he said, "the city was fat, dumb and happy with oil 
money. That's all gone." 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody ought to take out their wallet and put it in front of them 
and determine if it's better to have their money in a house that's not safe," 
Grabinski said. 
</P>
<P>
After listening to opponents, Smith declared: "I'm tired of that 'but' stuff. 
'We love our children, but' . . . I wish someone who opposes this issue would 
come up with an alternative plan." 
</P>
<P>
One of the proposal's obstacles is potential competition from a possible ballot 
measure that would increase property taxes to hire additional police officers. 
Councilman Jeffrey A. Kellogg, for instance, said he would not support the 
recreation tax until money is found for more policemen.

ARTESIA REJECTS CHURCH THAT 'PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT'

<P>
Despite best wishes from the Queen of Denmark, $650,000 in pledges and 
contributions and a donation of 1.1 acres of land, a Danish congregation from 
Los Angeles recently was unable to persuade the Artesia City Council to allow 
construction of a church. 
</P>
<P>
"The people didn't want it. The council listens to the people," Councilman Jim 
Van Horn said in discussing why the council voted last week to reject a 
proposed 3,500-square-foot church and a 4,000-square-foot assembly hall. The 
council was being asked to issue a conditional-use permit that would have 
allowed the church to be built in a single-family residential zone. 
</P>
<P>
Three council members voted against the proposal. Councilman Ronald Oliver 
abstained because his home is next to the site at 11504 E. 178th St. Mayor 
Dennis Fellows was on vacation, but indicated this week that he agreed with the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It is rather simple in Artesia. If the people don't want it, they don't get 
it," Fellows said. 
</P>
<P>
The mostly residential community of 15,000 has little open space remaining in 
its 1.6 square miles, and residents generally disapprove of new developments 
that they believe will cause overcrowding, Fellows said. Last February, he 
said, the council rejected a proposal for a new five-story Holiday Inn after 
residents objected. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the hotel was a pretty good idea, but you can't forget why you are 
here. You have got to listen to (residents)," said Fellows, a 15-year member of 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
And many residents said the facility that the Danish Lutheran Church of Los 
Angeles proposed to build would only create more traffic congestion and noise. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not opposed to a church, but this is a residential area. Traffic would 
be tripled," said Willemina Feikema, who lives across the street from the site. 
Feikema helped gather 45 signatures of residents on a petition opposing the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"The church would only bring noise and more racket for us," said Celia Bailey, 
who signed the petition. 
</P>
<P>
Feikema and Bailey have lived in Artesia more than 30 years. They say enough 
traffic is already generated by Burbank Elementary School, across the street 
from the site, and the Artesia Christian Church, about a block away. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Danish Lutheran Church of Los Angeles collected 71 signatures 
supporting the church's construction. 
</P>
<P>
But an analysis showed that only 16 signers lived near the site, while the 
other 55 lived outside the immediate area or outside the city, according to a 
city staff report. 
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the church's relocation committee, Carlo Christensen, said 
parishioners probably would start searching for another site within the Los 
Angeles Basin. Christensen said the 110-member church wants to move from the 
Crenshaw area of Los Angeles, where it has been located since 1937, to escape 
rising gang violence and crime. 
</P>
<P>
During the past summer, he said, a television set, office equipment, a couple 
of computers, a loudspeaker and a number of cars have been stolen at the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
The church received a $500,000 pledge from the Tom and Valley Knudsen 
Foundation of Los Angeles, and a fund-raising campaign netted more than 
$150,000, which included "a generous donation" from Queen Margrethe II of 
Denmark, Christensen said. 
</P>
<P>
Church members June and Andy Andersen were prepared to donate land behind their 
Artesia home, where they have lived for more than 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Andersens once operated a nursery on the property, which has a gazebo, a 
garden and a small building that social clubs and individuals have used for 
gatherings such as wedding receptions, June Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my neighbors who is complaining (about the project) apparently has 
forgotten that her daughter had her wedding reception here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have lots of parties," Andersen added, "but we always stop the music at 10 
p.m." 
</P>
<P>
Andersen said that in a few months she may ask the City Council to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the city Planning Commission rejected the church's request on grounds 
that traffic in the area would increase and that concerts, dinners and wedding 
receptions at the church would create too much noise.

PANEL ASKS FOR REVISED PARKING PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
CONGESTION: AN UNPOPULAR PROPOSAL TO CHARGE RESIDENTS OF HIGH-DENSITY AREAS TO 
PARK IN FRONT OF THEIR HOMES GOES BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bowing to public opposition, the Glendale Parking Commission told the city's 
traffic engineer Monday to rewrite a proposal to charge residents of 
high-density areas for permits to park overnight in front of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
After its fourth public hearing on the unpopular proposal, the commission's 
members said that they hoped Traffic Engineer Tom Horne could add incentives 
that would pacify the more than 100 speakers who criticized the idea as 
elitist, unfair and unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, with no other business to attend to, called off its November 
and December meetings but will schedule an evening hearing in January to allow 
public comment on the revised proposal. 
</P>
<P>
To accommodate the expected large turnout, the meeting will be held in the 
Glendale Civic auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, first presented by Horne as a draft ordinance in March, was aimed 
at easing parking congestion in densely populated neighborhoods by forcing 
residents to park cars in their garages. It called for paid permits for 
residents parking on the streets between 2 and 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The fees would have ranged from $15 to $120, depending on the number of permits 
per household and the amount of available off-street parking. 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, Horne said that the new draft would probably include a 
restructuring of the fee scale. 
</P>
<P>
Commission and city staff members said the new proposal will also probably 
include fee exemptions for the handicapped, senior citizens and maybe for 
applicants requesting their first permit. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid the appearence of discrimination, the proposal would make the parking 
restrictions citywide, as opposed to neighborhoods zoned for apartments and 
condominiums, as was intended in the original draft, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
These officials hope that the added incentives, along with a stepped-up 
publicity campaign, will turn the tide in favor of the parking permit plan. 
Last week, at a planning retreat in Oxnard in Ventura County, Glendale City 
Council members instructed the city manager to negotiate with New Image, a 
Glendale public relations firm, a promotional package for the city proposal. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday a subdued audience of about 30 residents attended the commission 
hearing at the Glendale Public Library. Although the turnout was considerably 
smaller than at previous hearings on the matter, speakers were as adamant as 
ever in their opposition to the city plan. 
</P>
<P>
Two speakers voiced support for the proposal, but the others restated arguments 
heard throughout the hearing process: that there are no problems in their 
neighborhoods that merit a parking fee, that the proposal amounts to taxation 
of the poor and that the council is responsible for the parking crunch by 
allowing too much development and should therefore shoulder the cost of any 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
Kay McKenzie handed commissioners a petition with 40 signatures opposing the 
city proposal. She said after the meeting that her group, the newly formed 
Citizens Against Parking Permits, had already submitted 400 signatures to the 
commission and that thousands would be gathered throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
Four police officers stood guard at the auditorium entrance to prevent a repeat 
of the scuffle that took place Sept. 18, when a police patrol in riot gear was 
called in to control a vociferous, emotional, and at times unruly crowd of 300 
that packed City Hall to oppose the proposed parking restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's meeting began with a stern warning by commission Chairman James 
Cashion, who advised the audience that such behavior would no longer be 
tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
But the warning seemed unnecessary. In contrast to the constant clapping and 
yelling that characterized earlier hearings, Monday's audience applauded only 
once. 
</P>
<P>
That came in reaction to a statement by Bob Minahan, one of the speakers: "If 
anybody in this commission has any political aspirations he should make a 
motion right now to strike down the parking proposal. He will probably be 
elected mayor in the next election."

MARINA PROJECT IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Work has started on a marina project in Alamitos Bay in apparent violation of a 
federal permit. 
</P>
<P>
While the city of Long Beach has received approval from the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers to build a seawall at an Ocean Boulevard marina, it was not supposed 
to start the project until it had also begun an associated environmental 
project. It has not done that, and the director of the city Parks and 
Recreation Department says there is no particular timetable for doing the 
environmental work. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there was a misunderstanding," parks Director Ralph Cryder said, 
insisting that he was not aware of the permit stipulation that the 
environmental work be undertaken before, or simultaneously, with the marina 
project. Saying he would "look into it," Robert Burns of the Corps of Engineers 
regulatory office would not comment on whether the city has violated the 
conditions of its permit. 
</P>
<P>
The parks department also is planning to build a seawall in the Cerritos 
Channel area. Both projects will destroy habitat for marine life, so the city 
has agreed to create some sandy beaches in the Marine Stadium area as a 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a community group is fighting the plan to put in new beaches 
along Marine Stadium, a narrow, rock-lined waterway used by boaters and rowers. 
Although Cryder said swimming will not be permitted at the beaches, opponents 
fear swimming will be allowed, interfering with boating activities.

BOND RATING ON TROUBLED TRASH BURNER LOWERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The feud surrounding Long Beach's troubled trash-to-energy incinerator this 
week caught the attention of a prestigious New York financial institution which 
downgraded the $170-million bond that funded the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., which publishes financial data and rates bonds 
according to their investment risks, demoted the bond one step -- from an A 
rating to a BBB in its Oct. 16 publication. 
</P>
<P>
The new rating marks the bond as a slightly more risky investment. A Standard 
&amp; Poor's rating can substantially affect the value of a bond, investment 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The Terminal Island plant is embroiled in a controversy between its 
Pittsburgh-based builder, Dravo Corp., and the city of Long Beach. The builder 
contends that the facility is finished, but the city says it is full of flaws 
and has refused to sign it off as complete. The builder last month expressed 
his intention to sue the city as a result. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's cited the dispute as reason to believe the city is less 
likely to pay off the bond debt on the Southeast Resource Recovery Facility, 
known as SERRF. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials expect the problems to be resolved within 30 days without 
harm to the plant or the investors who funded its design and construction, said 
Bill Davis, solid waste bureau manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have things well in hand to fix the plant and get on with our 
lives," Davis said.

GLENDALE OFFICIALS' TEMPERS FLARE OVER LATE COMPUTER SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The otherwise congenial atmosphere at the Glendale City Council retreat in 
Oxnard was broken briefly by anger Friday when officials learned that a 
sophisticated computer program they were counting on to help plan development 
will be at least a year late in coming. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale officials had lauded a so-called "transportation modeling" system, 
which is expected to more accurately predict traffic congestion and other 
ramifications of future development, as the answer to planning the size and 
type of buildings that would be permitted citywide. 
</P>
<P>
When they awarded a $284,000 contract to a Pasadena consultant in January, 
council members said they were told that the system would be in operation by 
late this year. On Friday, city staff workers said the data needed for the 
system cannot be expected before June. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't understand why it's going to take another whole goddamned year," 
said Mayor Jerold Milner, who became flushed in the face and sat up straight in 
his swivel chair when told the news. "You said six to nine months. Now you're 
talking twice as long. That just isn't acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Milner called the computer program "the key to everything we're planning in the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Horne, city traffic and transportation manager, who broke the news, said 
the program has been delayed because the consultant, Barton-Aschman Associates, 
has been unable to obtain a database needed to implement the system from the 
Southern California Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Barton-Aschman denied Wednesday that the firm has failed to 
comply with the city's contract. Ray Rebeiro, project manager, blamed the 
problem on miscommunication between consultants and the council. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a classic case whereby the client doesn't fully understand what is 
being done or why," Rebeiro said. 
</P>
<P>
Without the system, the city has studied the impact of new development on 
traffic congestion on a case-by-case and street-by-street basis, with no 
accurate projection on the cumulative effects of all development. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale was planning to use the sophisticated transportation modeling system 
to track projections on growth in Southern California, provided by SCAG, to 
determine the individual impact of each project in Glendale on traffic 
congestion and the supply and demand for housing and employment. 
</P>
<P>
Similar systems have been used for years by dozens of the nation's largest 
cities, including Los Angeles, according to consultants. But Horne said 
Glendale has been unable to develop its own model because it lacks the regional 
data necessary and there is a shortage of traffic engineers capable of 
developing the system. 
</P>
<P>
"Bull," Milner snapped with uncharacteristic sternness. "I don't believe it. I 
want that model and I want it by the first of the year." 
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the city find another consultant, if necessary, to do the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Other council members shared Milner's anger. Councilman Larry Zarian, who has 
openly fretted about growing traffic congestion in Glendale, also suggested 
that the city look for a new traffic consultant. "I would rather deal with 
someone who is hungry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You aren't going to find anyone who is hungry," countered Horne, who said 
there is a dearth of trained traffic engineers qualified to deal with the 
problems of congestion-clogged California cities. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale officials said the computer program is essential for deciding what 
kind of development will be permitted. "We can't do anything without it," said 
Zarian, who questioned the reliability of traffic studies that have already 
been done for the proposed Red Lion hotel and Homart Development Co. office 
tower and plaza soon to get under way downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"There are decisions to be made and we don't have the information we need to 
make them," Zarian added. "I'm now more concerned than ever about what kind of 
traffic we will have in our downtown central corridor." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Carl Raggio said the city will have to develop its own database, 
without input from SCAG. "We don't have a model. We are going to have to go 
ahead without it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-minute confrontation ended when City Manager David Ramsay proposed that 
the council meet with the city's traffic consultant within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than shooting at us, we'll bring back Barton-Aschman," Ramsay said. 
"There is a lot of anger and frustration on modeling and I understand that." 
</P>
<P>
Rebeiro said Barton-Aschman is working on a two-phase project for Glendale, one 
part of which examines the traffic impact of all proposed new development in 
the downtown area, and another that will factor in development outside the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Rebeiro said preliminary results of the study on local development are expected 
to be presented to the council Nov. 6.

YOUTH CHOIR REVAMPED 2ND TIME IN 2 YEARS 
</P>

<DATELINE>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
International Children's Choir, a Long Beach institution for 32 years, is being 
reorganized for the second time since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Members say they are planning to change the name, possibly to the International 
Children's Choir of Long Beach, following the withdrawal of president Ann 
Livingston for personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Livingston's mother, Easter Beekly, founded the choir in 1957. Under her 
leadership, the musical group -- which features children ages 4 to 17 dressed 
in a variety of national folk costumes -- became an internationally acclaimed 
performance organization making appearances throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1987, Livingston -- who succeeded her mother as the choir's leader -- 
fired musical director Irene Bayless, claiming that Bayless had undermined the 
choir's original purpose by concentrating on polished high-profile performances 
rather than community-based public-interest appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Bayless responded by forming her own choir, the International Peace Choir, 
which ended up wooing away most of the original group's singers, thus causing 
it to recruit new ones. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Bayless' 60-member group is reported to be doing well. And organizers of 
the soon-to-be-named International Children's Choir of Long Beach say they 
expect to retain most of Livingston's 40 members, despite the former 
president's withdrawal.

OCON FAMILY MAKES MARK AT GLENDALE AND BEYOND; 
</P>
<P>
NICARAGUA: ONE SON'S SUCCESS AS A SWIMMER COULD HELP STRENGTHEN TIES BETWEEN 
HIS BASEBALL-LOVING FATHER AND THE FAMILY'S HOMELAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BAXTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As far as Max Ocon is concerned, there are only two kinds of athletes: baseball 
players and those who wish they were baseball players. Which is one reason it 
pains him to lug the family scrapbook out of the closet. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason that gives him pain is that the two-volume set is roughly the 
same size and weight as a Volkswagen Beetle. But included among the water polo, 
swimming, track and football clippings are scarce few accounts of heroics on 
the baseball field. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure I'm disappointed," Ocon says. "I wished they had stayed with baseball. 
Because they were really good." 
</P>
<P>
Ocon's five kids haven't exactly failed in the other sports they've tried. Two 
sons, Lawrence and Leo, are starting on their college water polo teams; eldest 
son Luis and daughter Lisette were track standouts in high school; and Luzmila, 
a drill-team member at Glendale High, holds a school record in swimming. 
</P>
<P>
But for Max, Lawrence's two Babe Ruth League no-hitters stand out more than his 
Glendale single-season record of 116 goals in water polo. And he remembers 
Leo's first game as a Little League second baseman, not as a freshman starter 
on UC Santa Cruz's fledgling water polo team. 
</P>
<P>
"He pushed us to play baseball," Lawrence says of his father. "Before high 
school, I didn't have an interest in any other sports." 
</P>
<P>
The elder Ocon's devotion to baseball was born in his homeland of Nicaragua, 
where the sport has a fervent following. But ironically, one son's success in 
swimming could draw Max closer to Nicaragua than a dozen youth-league 
no-hitters would have. 
</P>
<P>
During a trip to Managua last May, Lawrence was invited to work out with 
Nicaragua's national swim team. He so impressed the coaches that they asked him 
to represent Nicaragua in the Central American Games in Honduras in January. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence, who was born in the United States but can also represent Panama and 
Nicaragua internationally by virtue of his mother's and father's nationality, 
hasn't decided if he'll accept. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on how school is going," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Adds his father: "I don't want the fact that he's swimming in Honduras to cause 
him any problems with the NCAA and the government of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Such caution comes from experience. The current political and economic standoff 
between the U. S. government and Nicaragua's revolutionary leadership has 
frustrated Ocon's attempts to develop business ties in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Ocon owns a gas station in Rosemead and also runs a courier service, taking 
packages to and from Nicaragua. But he has plans to market concessions at 
Managua's national stadium and, toward that end, took an estimated $20,000 in 
baseball equipment to the country earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
"But I can't get started until after the embargo (is lifted) because I can't 
get the machinery," Ocon said. 
</P>
<P>
This month's delivery was not Ocon's first contact with the baseball community 
in Nicaragua. As co-director of the Hollywood-based group Baseball Diplomacy, 
Ocon was the point man for a U. S. team's visit to Nicaragua last summer. He 
also has helped to arrange a number of other baseball-related delegations, 
including one headed by Vera Clemente, the widow of Pittsburgh Pirate Hall of 
Famer Roberto Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
And baseball remains a frequent topic of conversation, if not participation, 
around the Ocon household. 
</P>
<P>
"I really miss it," Lawrence says. "But then, when I watch football on 
television, I really miss that too." 
</P>
<P>
What he doesn't miss is much time in the pool, putting in as many as six hours 
a day in the water. Such dedication is not unusual in the Ocon family, for 
which father Max sets the tone with frequent 16-hour work days. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of what a kid learns starts from the training they get at home," 
Glendale High Principal Sam Harvey said. "Not only are (the Ocons) good 
athletes, but they've all participated in school activities. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately for Glendale High, they've all done very well." 
</P>
<P>
Which has conspired to make the Ocon name a familiar one at the school. It's a 
familiar -- if perhaps infamous -- one in Nicaragua as well. Max's father, 
Luis, was a high-ranking National Guard officer and chief of police during the 
violent 37-year Somoza family dictatorship. When Max was 15 years old, his 
mother and father separated, and Max followed his mother to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to Nicaragua infrequently during the 1960s and '70s and rarely 
spoke with his father. But after stepping in to help a touring Nicaraguan 
baseball team find housing and transportation during a visit to Los Angeles 
four years ago, Ocon took a renewed interest in his birthplace. Now he owns a 
house and a small farm just outside the capital of Managua, visiting the 
country three to four times a year. 
</P>
<P>
And he hasn't limited his interest to sports and business. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the only one in my family that is pro-Sandinista," Ocon says of his 
affinity for the Nicaraguan rebels who overthrew his father's National Guard 10 
years ago. "I believe in the Sandinista government. The revolution, for me, has 
been one of the greatest things that has even happened to Nicaragua." 
</P>
<P>
Strong opinions -- on sports and politics -- are respected, if not always 
heeded, around Ocon's large home in the Chevy Chase Estates. 
</P>
<P>
"He tells us what he thinks," says Lawrence, "but he doesn't push his views." 
</P>
<P>
Which has certainly worked to Lawrence's advantage. The most talented athlete 
in the family, Lawrence gave up baseball -- against his father's wishes -- 
after an uneventful freshman season at Glendale High. He concentrated instead 
on swimming and water polo, scoring 196 goals in 40 games his last two years. 
</P>
<P>
A Pacific League MVP and two-time all-league selection, Ocon, 19, played for 
USC's junior varsity water polo team last year, then transferred to Valley 
College this fall and scored seven goals in his first match. But it is as a 
swimmer that he has drawn attention in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't in shape when we went down there; he hadn't worked out in a couple 
of months," Max said. "But they were interested in seeing him swim. The heat 
really bothered him, but he still beat all their top swimmers in the sprints. 
</P>
<P>
"Afterward, the coach showed him a schedule and said that if he followed the 
schedule, he could be on the team for the Central American Games." 
</P>
<P>
Small for a water polo player at 5-foot-10 and 150 pounds, Lawrence could help 
his dad become a big man in his homeland should he decide to compete in 
Honduras next year. And if Lawrence does compete, Max is sure he'll come back 
with memories more valuable than any medals. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time they go to Nicaragua, they come back thinking different," the elder 
Ocon says. "I can see it in their eyes."

'TEMBLOR' MAKES IMPACT ON GLENDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BAXTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just before Alberto Ocon was born, the earth shook. It should have been taken 
as a warning. 
</P>
<P>
Because now Ocon, a junior offensive lineman at Glendale High, leaves opponents 
quaking in their cleats. 
</P>
<P>
"He could have a big future in front of him," Glendale High football Coach Don 
Shoemaker says. 
</P>
<P>
His past is already memorable, stretching back three weeks before he was born. 
Ocon's parents lived in Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, at the time a 
mammoth earthquake leveled the city on Dec. 23, 1972. The quake killed more 
than 6,000 people and caused nearly $1 billion in damages -- and forever 
stamped Alberto with the nickname "temblor," the Spanish word for earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"The temblor" made an immediate impact on Glendale's football program, rumbling 
onto the team last year to earn All-Pacific League honors as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Ocon is the cousin of swimmer Lawrence Ocon, who set numerous water polo 
scoring records before graduating from Glendale two years ago (see related 
story). And he's not the first in his family to give football a try. Lawrence's 
older brother, Luis, was a wide receiver for the Dynamiters before teammate 
Duane Bickett, now with the NFL's Indianapolis Colts, ended his career with a 
jolting tackle in practice. Two of Alberto's uncles also played at Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
"The young people in both families have been very successful," Glendale 
Principal Sam Harvey says. 
</P>
<P>
Ocon's standout rookie season is adding to the family legend -- as well as 
helping to make up for the years he spent waiting to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I never really got a chance to try football until I got to high school. I was 
too heavy and too young for any of the local (youth) teams," says Ocon, 16, who 
stands 6-foot-2 and weighs 265 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Ocon plays either the strong tackle or guard on Glendale's offensive line, and 
younger brother Max, a sophomore, plays the quick, or "weak," tackle. (First 
cousins Alan Arellano and Iggy Guerra also play at times on the Glendale line.) 
And although Ocon sees some action on defense, Shoemaker maintains "his 
position is offense. That's where he'll play in college." 
</P>
<P>
For which college is a subject Shoemaker and Ocon will discuss in detail after 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the Oregon schools are interested in him and I know the Arizona schools 
are interested in him," Shoemaker says. "The schools . . . said that if he's a 
player, they'll take a look at him." 
</P>
<P>
They're likely to take a look at him in basketball and track as well. A forward 
on the junior varsity team last season, Ocon is a probable varsity 
letter-winner this winter. In track, he won the sophomore league title in the 
discus as a freshman but last year his season was cut short by injuries 
suffered in an auto accident. 
</P>
<P>
However, football is the sport that will get him to college. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach says if I get good grades and I play good football, then he thinks a 
Division I school should pick me up," says Ocon, a C-plus student. "If I have a 
much better year in league than I had last year, hopefully I'll get some kind 
of CIF recognition. 
</P>
<P>
"And hopefully I'll look good for some college that might want me." 
</P>

JANIE EICKHOFF LIKES SETTING ALL OF HER WHEELS SPINNING; 
</P>
<P>
CYCLING: CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS FRESHMAN JANIE EICKHOFF HOLDS THE UNOFFICIAL 
WORLD KILOMETER RECORD ON A BIKE. WHAT'S MORE, SHE MIGHT GET TO BE JUST AS GOOD 
AT SPEED SKATING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Janie Eickhoff is a 5-foot-2 college freshman who has legs that remind you of 
Bo Jackson, and a repertoire of accomplishments to match. 
</P>
<P>
Janie, who grew up in Long Beach, knows cycling. She became a track cyclist 
five years ago, after a knee injury in her freshman year ended her varsity 
soccer career at nearby Los Alamitos High School. After a year as a competitive 
cyclist, she was a junior national champion. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't decide I liked it until the junior nationals in '85," Eickhoff said. 
"I was convinced then that this was what I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, Eickhoff has climbed the ladder -- junior world championships, 
first-place finishes in senior national championship events. Since August, she 
has been on a remarkable run, setting an unofficial world kilometer record at 
the national championships and taking a bronze medal in the points race at the 
world championships at Lyon, France. Recently she won medals in six of her 
seven events at the NEC World Cycling Invitational in the Olympic Velodrome at 
Cal State Dominguez Hills and scored nearly half the six-member team's points 
as the United States won the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Eickhoff also knows speed skating. She took up the sport about three years ago 
after hearing other cyclists talk about it as they trained at velodromes. 
Others, such as Bonnie Blair and Connie Young, had begun their careers as 
skaters. Eickhoff saw it as a way to complement her riding, a training regimen 
that would enhance her leg strength and give her a break from the bike. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, she won the national senior women's short-track speed skating 
championship at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
And watch out, Eickhoff might get to know cross-country skiing this winter. 
</P>
<P>
What Eickhoff can't do is anybody's guess. At 19, she is at an age at which 
most people begin to discover that life's opportunity is not so boundless after 
all. 
</P>
<P>
But Eickhoff's opportunities just keep expanding. 
</P>
<P>
Off the track and the ice, Eickhoff is an unassuming, appealing young woman who 
occasionally worries that if she does not build her upper body she will "look 
like a dinosaur," -- tiny little arms at the top of a sturdy frame. 
</P>
<P>
Once on the track or the ice, she is a competitor so tough that she once came 
back to race less than an hour after she fell to the ice in a false start and 
split open her chin, requiring stitches. 
</P>
<P>
Off in the future, the Olympics await. Eickhoff would like to make it as a 
cyclist, and is considered one of the top U.S. prospects for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Making the Olympics in speed skating would be considerably tougher. 
</P>
<P>
Eickhoff's legs intimidate even the top skaters. Her coach, Barth Levy, says 
she is probably the strongest skater at almost every competition. But after 
only three years as a competitive skater, her technique is still raw. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm competing against other people who seem like their second pair of shoes 
was a pair of ice skates," Eickhoff said. "It's frustrating. You train so hard, 
but they're more effective and can be just as fast." 
</P>
<P>
Her success at the world cycling championships has Eickhoff thinking about 
whether she should focus solely on cycling. Besides the bronze medal she won in 
the points race, Eickhoff finished sixth in the match sprint, the classic track 
race that sets riders against each other in a tedious cat-and-mouse game 
followed by an all-out sprint to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
Her coaches -- Levy and cycling coach Pat McDonough, both of whom she spends 
hours with on the telephone getting long-distance training advice -- would each 
like to see her focus on one sport. If it had to be one, cycling would win. 
</P>
<P>
But with the start of staggered Olympic Games in 1994 -- winter and summer 
games will no longer be held the same year -- it will become more feasible for 
an athlete to train in two sports. The temptation will be there. 
</P>
<P>
Cycling experts marvel at what Eickhoff has been able to do with so little 
training and at such a young age. Eickhoff herself can't offer a satisfying 
explanation. "I always tried really hard," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But trying hard makes high-school champions, not world-class cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
"In cycling, I can't believe it, really," Eickhoff said. "I'm still not sure 
how far I can go. Maybe I'll go a few more years and see where I get to." 
</P>
<P>
The training is hard, and a little lonely. Eickhoff lived in Pennsylvania to 
train with McDonough this summer, and last year lived in Cleveland to train 
with Levy. 
</P>
<P>
But these days she is living at home in Los Alamitos and the routine is built 
around fall semester classes at Cal State Dominguez Hills, site of the Olympic 
Velodrome where Eickhoff works out twice a week. She trains for speed skating 
at Iceland skating rink in Paramount, and runs and cycles more on her own. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, George Eickhoff, accompanies her to the velodrome, changing wheels 
and timing her laps and sprints. But for coaching, Eickhoff relies on 
long-distance phone calls to McDonough. 
</P>
<P>
It was Eickhoff's father, "the hobby-aholic," Janie calls him, who encouraged 
her to try cycling after the soccer injury. Her father and brother, Rick, have 
both been on the U.S. pistol shooting team, and George also has raced cars. He 
took Janie to the velodrome to see if it would interest her. It did. 
</P>
<P>
And by the way, Janie knows pistol shooting, too. Her father says she is a 
natural. 
</P>
<P>
Janie Eickhoff's success in cycling and speed skating is because of her 
versatility. She also is a sprinter who has endurance and cunning. 
</P>
<P>
She does well in cycling events whose demands, according to one cycling 
promoter, are as varied as those of the 100 meters and the mile in track. 
</P>
<P>
Eickhoff delights in the strategy of racing, of outsmarting and then 
out-sprinting opponents on the banked slopes of a velodrome. 
</P>
<P>
"You might not be the fastest, but if you can get across the line first by 
drafting or suckering someone into doing something, you can win," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the match sprint, Eickhoff says, the more experience, the better. "That's 
the most important thing, to have a bigger bag of tricks." 
</P>
<P>
In the kilometer, tricks are not the issue. The race is an all-out, three-lap 
sprint considered by some to be the toughest event in cycling -- and worthy of 
the nickname "killer-meter." 
</P>
<P>
At the national championships in August at Redmond, Wash., Eickhoff finished 
first in the kilometer with a time of 1:13.81, .425 seconds faster than the 
world record held by Soviet Erika Salumiae. But the event was not 
internationally sanctioned, so the time was unofficial. 
</P>
<P>
Eickhoff's versatility helps her succeed in competitions, but it makes for a 
lot of luggage. Both she and her father drive vans equipped with racks, filled 
with all variety of wheels and frames. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I like skating," Eickhoff said. "You can fit everything into one 
bag. You don't have to carry suitcases and suitcases around. Maybe I should 
have gone into something like running. 
</P>
<P>
"No, that would have been much too simple." 
</P>

CONTROVERSIAL COUNCILMAN IN RANCHO P.V. RESIGNS ABRUPTLY; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: COLLEAGUES AT CITY HALL ARE STUNNED -- ESPECIALLY SINCE ROBERT E. 
RYAN IS LISTED AS A COUNCIL CANDIDATE IN THE NEXT ELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Longtime Rancho Palos Verdes Councilman Robert E. Ryan, who had bickered with 
council colleagues and is a candidate in the Nov. 7 election, resigned without 
warning in a one-sentence statement he left for the council at its meeting 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan did not attend the meeting and could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is to inform you that I am resigning as a member of the Rancho Palos 
Verdes City Council, effective 7:30 p.m. Oct. 17," Ryan wrote in the 
one-sentence resignation read by City Clerk Jo Purcell, who also is his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Council members and the audience of 30 were stunned. Ryan has been on the 
council since the city's incorporation in 1973, and served as both mayor and 
mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very surprised. It was a shock," said Mayor Jacki Bacharach during a 
recess. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's name appears on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"He can theoretically resign from this council and be elected to the next. . . 
. That certainly is possible," said City Manager Dennis McDuffie. 
</P>
<P>
Purcell said in an interview during a recess that her husband is not ill, 
adding she had little warning of his plan. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone call Wednesday, Purcell said: "I didn't know about it, and I 
have nothing else left to say." 
</P>
<P>
Bacharach, a contender in next month's election, said that despite Ryan missing 
the last couple of meetings, she had no idea that he would resign. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Ariel P. Calonne said Ryan's resignation is final. 
</P>
<P>
Robert E. McNulty, an attorney who is challenging Ryan in the election, 
speculated that Ryan's resignation might be due to illness because Ryan has not 
been seen in several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"My ego would like to think we were doing so well, and he'd rather resign than 
to face defeat," said McNulty outside the council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Ryan said this might be his last term on the council, though, he 
said, he could change his mind to combat development. 
</P>
<P>
Two Ryan allies, Councilman John McTaggart and businessman Alan Carlan, said 
they too were surprised by Ryan's resignation, adding that he appeared "fired 
up" at a homeowners association meeting last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave no hints he'd resign," said Carlan, who is running for a seat on the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Dennis McDuffie, with whom Ryan often butted heads, said he could 
not understand why Purcell did not tell the council of her husband's 
resignation earlier Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I find disturbing," McDuffie said. 
</P>
<P>
At a council meeting in August, Ryan had called McDuffie the worst city manager 
in the city's history. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a city councilman, and I am a city manager. However, in his case, it 
was not a mutual admiration society," McDuffie said Wednesday in describing his 
relationship with Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's name-calling caused low morale among some at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
In March, tension between Ryan and the council majority swelled when the 
council learned of Ryan's December, 1987, marriage to Purcell. Councilman Mel 
Hughes called it deceit. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Douglas Hinchliffe, who characterized his relationship with Ryan as 
adversarial, nevertheless praised Ryan for his 16 years of service to the city.

TORRANCE UPHOLDS DECISION TO FIRE OFFICER WHO SHOT DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance City Council members voted unanimously Tuesday to sustain the decision 
to fire a police officer who shot a man during a routine traffic stop and then 
allegedly lied about how the shooting took place. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Timothy Pappas and two colleagues were fired in December after a Police 
Department investigation into the shooting of construction worker Patrick 
Coyle, who was partially paralyzed as a result of the May 9, 1988, incident. 
</P>
<P>
Pappas had previously appealed his dismissal to the city's Civil Service 
Commission, which also voted unanimously to uphold the department's decision. 
If Pappas wishes to continue seeking reinstatement, City Atty. Kenneth Nelson 
said, he must pursue his case in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
The council hearing on Pappas' case, like each previous hearing on the matter, 
was held behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Daniel Cassidy, who represented the city, said Pappas' lawyer, Doug 
Otto, argued that the penalty for the apparently accidental shooting was too 
severe. 
</P>
<P>
Otto did not return a telephone call seeking comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
Pappas and Officer Mark Holden also face criminal charges for their part in an 
alleged cover-up of how Coyle was shot. Initial police reports said Pappas 
pulled the trigger after Coyle made a sudden grab toward a metal object in his 
pocket. 
</P>
<P>
A third officer at the scene, Timothy Thornton, later told his superiors that 
Coyle made no sudden moves before he was shot. Investigators said they believe 
Pappas pulled the trigger accidentally. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing for Pappas and Holden began in Los Angeles Municipal 
Court on Oct. 12, but will not resume until Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal charges were not filed against Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton is scheduled to appeal his dismissal to the City Council on Nov. 14, 
Civil Service Administrator William Ghio said. Holden's hearing before the 
Civil Service Commission is scheduled to begin Oct. 23, Ghio said.

REDONDO COUNCIL OKS SHOPPING CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a 4-1 vote, the Redondo Beach City Council approved the Redondo Shores 
Shopping Center, a 104,941-square-foot commercial and office complex planned 
for a site just north of City Hall on Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
The triangular, 5.9-acre site, bordered by Carnelian and Beryl streets and 
Elena Avenue, is vacant except for a drugstore. The developer, Redondo Shores 
Ltd. submitted plans for a one- and two-story, Cape Cod-style complex of stores 
on the site. The Mrs. Gooch's grocery store in Hermosa Beach will relocate to 
the new center, and other retail stores and a restaurant are envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
The project was approved with 72 conditions to lessen its impact on the area. 
The conditions include requiring offices and stores to participate in a 
recycling program where feasible, operating a security system for a proposed 
underground parking garage and prohibiting bars in the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Barbara J. Doerr, expressing concerns about security, traffic and 
how well the project would blend into the existing residential neighborhood, 
voted against the project.

REDONDO BLOCK LOSES FIRST TRY AT HISTORIC DESIGNATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Redondo Beach City Council decided Tuesday not to extend a building 
moratorium on the 500 block of Garnet Street after a group of residents failed 
to get enough support for an application to designate the block a historic 
district. 
</P>
<P>
But the group still has until Oct. 31, the deadline for the original moratorium 
on construction and demolition on the block, to try to garner support for the 
proposed historic designation, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Garnet Street is the last remaining intact block of old homes left in Redondo 
Beach, and some residents have argued that its historic significance should be 
protected. All 17 homes on the street were built before 1928. 
</P>
<P>
Under a historic preservation ordinance that took effect Sept. 1, 85% of the 
homeowners, or 15 of the 17, must support an application for historic 
designation. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Condon, a leader of a residents group lobbying for the proposal, said 
Tuesday he had the signatures from residents of five homes on a city-authorized 
petition. But 13 of the homeowners had supported a different petition favoring 
the proposal, proponents said. 
</P>
<P>
Condon said residents did not have sufficient time to solicit signatures for 
the city's petition, which he said they obtained less than two weeks ago. Two 
homeowners were out of the country, he said, and other homeowners were hesitant 
about signing because they did not understand what they might stand to gain or 
lose from historic designation. 
</P>
<P>
But some council members said the 90-day period the council originally alloted 
the residents group should have been enough time to get the signatures, if the 
support for the proposition was there. 
</P>
<P>
"It can't take 90 days to knock on 17 doors," said Councilman Stevan Colin. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy began earlier this year when Garnet Street resident Tony 
Ballejos sought a permit to demolish his 81-year-old house and build a bigger 
one. Several of his neighbors objected to his building plans and sought help 
from the Redondo Beach Historical Society to have the block designated a 
historic district. 
</P>
<P>
Other residents, however, were opposed to historic designation, arguing that it 
would restrict their freedom to alter their homes or demolish them and 
construct new ones.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE SAYS THE NHL IS BECOMING A BIT DRAFTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jeff Jacobs of the Hartford Courant on the National Hockey League's waiver 
draft: "It is designed to help weak teams. It is supposed to free young players 
trapped in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
"But the waiver draft actually is a used-car sale with only the lemons and aged 
gas-guzzlers available. For a while, it was a way for teams to stock up on 
goons at the last minute. Now that the NHL finally has taken steps to curb 
brawling, even that avenue has dried up. 
</P>
<P>
"Only about 10 players actually move each year. But if you are a veteran with a 
wife, a kid starting the first grade, and own a home in the city you play in, 
how would you feel? A player accepts the capriciousness of the trading game 
when he enters hockey, but systematically uprooting guys two days before the 
season to send them to Winnipeg often strikes one as inhumane. 
</P>
<P>
"What the draft does is give general managers until the last minute to play 
games with their rosters. It gives the media three days to write about how a 
team no longer wants a fading player with a big salary. And, then, only a few 
players actually move. It needlessly embarrasses professionals." 
</P>
<P>
Face in the crowd: Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post, in a story on the 
obscurity of the Capitals' lineup, conducted a random survey during which he 
asked respondents to name two players on the club's roster. 
</P>
<P>
Washington Redskin lineman Dexter Manley said he only knew two Capitals: "Rob 
Langway, and that guy they shipped out, the guy whose father is an actor, the 
guy who does Mazda commercials." James Garner? Manley nodded. You mean Mike 
Gartner? "Yeah," he said, "isn't his dad an actor?" 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What was the only National League team to win four consecutive 
pennants? 
</P>
<P>
Curtain call: Sandy Keenan of Newsday quotes Coach Lou Carnesecca of St. John's 
on the Big East's experiment with six personal fouls instead of five for all 
league basketball games this season: "Now we can keep them in until they get 
three (first-half) fouls. It's like an insurance policy for the better players, 
a luxury. Let's face it, we're in the entertainment business. People want to 
see the best players." 
</P>
<P>
Big Sky: After Idaho beat Northern Arizona, 41-31, on Oct. 7, the plane taking 
the Vandals back to Idaho was forced to make an emergency landing at San 
Francisco International Airport because of hydraulic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers braced for a crash landing, but the plane landed safely. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally get a game where I don't lose too much hair and then I lose a bunch 
on the flight home," Idaho Coach John Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Sole man: Said former Kentucky basketball coach Eddie Sutton, now working for 
Nike: "I've talked to other people and they say how nice it would be to take a 
year off from their regular job. That's basically what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
Sutton's job includes watching practices and games involving college teams that 
wear Nike shoes this season. But don't look for him at Kentucky; the Wildcats' 
new coach, Rick Pitino, switched the team to Converse shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The New York Giants, 1921 through 1924.

DAVE DISTEL: FINDING ANOTHER JOAN KROC WON'T BE EASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the owner of a professional franchise announces that the team is for sale, 
the reaction of the general public usually runs a narrow gamut, from ho-hum to 
good riddance. 
</P>
<P>
Owners, you see, are generally perceived as curmudgeonly fellows with fat 
stomachs, two or three chins, cigars in their mouths and their wallets sewn 
into the pockets of their three-piece suits. 
</P>
<P>
These are people who put on a show of worrying about Ws and Ls but really worry 
most about Ps and Ls. 
</P>
<P>
When the Chargers changed hands, and Alex Spanos replaced Eugene V. Klein as 
the owner, there was hardly a ripple of response from the populace. It was as 
if an owner is an owner is an owner, so what's the big deal exactly who that 
might be? 
</P>
<P>
It's different this time. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Kroc has announced that the Padres are for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The first person I ran into after work Tuesday night was my insurance agent. 
</P>
<P>
"Why," he asked, "would Joan want to sell the Padres?" 
</P>
<P>
I have heard the same question over and over. And it has always been Joan. 
Never Kroc. 
</P>
<P>
Why? And what will happen to the Padres without her? 
</P>
<P>
George Bush could learn a lot about kind and gentle stewardships from this 
woman. That was the way the fans (and players) perceived her. The word generous 
also comes into play, and not because she could afford to be. A lot of people 
can afford to be generous but aren't. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Kroc has always left the impression that she is a mere caretaker for San 
Diego's team, not much more or less important than just another fan. Most 
owners let ownership feed their egos, and fans pick up on that. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Kroc actually had fans and players who were loyal to her and 
trusted her. 
</P>
<P>
It is almost as if the fans perceive that this owner is a most indispensable 
person . . . perhaps the unseen (by most) and unsung Most Valuable Person. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a conscientious owner," she said Wednesday, "but not a great owner. 
I've been a sincere and honest owner. But no one's irreplaceable. The team goes 
on." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, and life goes on. 
</P>
<P>
This is where she is at now. Life. This is why she decided it is time to sell 
the baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the calendar," she said, "I'll be 62 next August. That's an age 
when a lot of people, not just me, start thinking about what they're going to 
do with their golden years." 
</P>
<P>
She laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"And I assure you, my hair will stay gold." 
</P>
<P>
A little aside. A little joke at her own expense. A little laughter. A little 
message that maybe it's time for the simpler, more basic things in life. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to take the family to the Greek Islands," she said. "In the summer." 
</P>
<P>
After all, summer does not have to belong to baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"The nature of baseball is sort of like life in that it's unpredictable," she 
said. "There are a lot of ups and downs, just like in life. I can cope with the 
ups and downs of life without having to cope with the ups and downs of 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
The "ups" of baseball told her this was the time. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had finished poorly, even a third-place finish," she said, "I certainly 
would not have sold the club. I wouldn't shirk my responsibility in getting the 
ship righted. But I feel very good about the future of this team." 
</P>
<P>
That was Joan Kroc, feeling it was her responsibility to make sure the team was 
in good shape. It was not her nature to abandon a ship anyone might have 
perceived was sinking. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, her last responsibility as owner will be to work with Jerry Kapstein, her 
son-in-law, to find a suitable successor. This will be as important as anything 
she has done with and for this team and its fans. 
</P>
<P>
"I assure you that the person buying this team will be a very financially 
healthy and prominent man or woman of integrity," she said. "There will never 
be another fiasco like there was in '86 with George Argyros." 
</P>
<P>
Argyros, of course, was the Newport Beach businessman who almost bought the 
club when Kroc had it on the market in the winter of 1986-87. The more she 
heard about him, the less she wanted to sell it to him until the deal 
financially dissolved, and she took the team off the market. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing like that will happen again," she said. "I'm going to look to Jerry to 
be very stringent in checking people out." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Kapstein's chore will be nothing like the scouting department has ever 
encountered. It is much easier to shop for a starting pitcher or a shortstop or 
a center fielder than it is to shop for a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, he knows all the qualities he is seeking. He need only sit down at 
the dining room table with his mother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important," he said, "that I find someone, be it a man or a woman, 
who can carry on what Joan has done so well." 
</P>
<P>
That's all he has to do. 
</P>
<P>
Just how many Joan Krocs are there?

TWAY SHOOTS 61 TO TIE BEST SCORE AND LEAD BY 4

<P>
Bob Tway broke three tournament records, tied another and equaled the best 
score on the PGA Tour this year with an 11-under-par 61 in Wednesday's first 
round of the Disney tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Tway made nine birdies and an eagle to take a four-shot lead. 
</P>
<P>
His score matched the tour's best effort this year by Jim Carter at the Centel 
tournament in Tallahassee, Fla., on Sept. 30. Tway tied the tournament record 
set by Mark Lye in 1984 and broke the first-round record of 62 set last year by 
Bob Lohr. 
</P>
<P>
He also broke by two shots the tournament record at Lake Buena Vista, one of 
three courses used in each of the first three rounds. Tway's four-stroke margin 
after one round was a record by two shots. 
</P>
<P>
Tied for second at 65 were Paul Azinger, Tim Simpson, Ted Schulz and Mike 
Donald.

THAT'S NAME OF THE GAME FOR LOYOLA BASKETBALL THIS SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Loyola Marymount opened basketball practice this week with big hopes, big 
names, a big-time schedule and an accelerated practice schedule that fits its 
hectic image. 
</P>
<P>
The season opens for the Lions on Nov. 15, a month after the start of practice. 
And the opener is a delicious matchup: Loyola's run-at-all-costs offense 
against highly ranked Nevada-Las Vegas' stern defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions began practice with a healthy complement and most of their 
record-setting offense intact. Four of last season's top scorers are returning, 
led by senior forward Hank Gathers, who topped the nation in scoring and 
rebounding as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
Other returning starters are senior guards Jeff Fryer and Bo Kimble and junior 
forward/center Per Stumer. Also returning are junior Tom Peabody and sophomore 
Terrell Lowery, who both saw considerable action at guard, and a handful of 
lettermen at forward and center: 6-foot-10 senior Marcellus Lee, 6-9 senior 
Jeff Roscoe, 6-8 junior Marcus Slater, 6-9 sophomore Chris Knight and 6-6 
sophomore John O'Connell. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Lions open so early, in the preseason National Invitation 
Tournament, they begin a series of refereed intra-squad scrimmages this week 
and play two public exhibitions next month: their annual public Crimson-Gray 
intra-squad game Nov. 2 and a game with a touring Australian team Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Before Christmas, they will have played UNLV, which appears to be the consensus 
preseason No. 1, UC Santa Barbara, Oregon State and Oklahoma. They start the 
new year with a long-awaited trip to Philadelphia to play St. Joseph's and 
LaSalle -- a homecoming for Gathers and Kimble as well as Westhead, who has not 
coached a college game there since leaving LaSalle in 1979 to become a Lakers 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
"Anticipation? Some," Westhead said before a practice this week. "I like our 
schedule. A month and we're into it." 
</P>
<P>
With four televised games starting after 8:30 p.m., the Lions may become some 
sports fans' favorite late-night entertainment. The LaSalle game is scheduled 
for 11:30 p.m. EST, a game that will start on Jan. 6 and end Jan. 7. "I don't 
care if we're losing Saturday, I just don't want to be losing on Sunday," 
Westhead quipped. 
</P>
<P>
No-shows this season are guard Terry Mister, who dropped out, and Steve Yoest, 
a walk-on last year who has decided to attend to studies. His absence means 
there won't be a Yoest on the varsity for the first time in five years. Mister, 
who didn't figure to play much, will be missed mostly for his services as 
unofficial team barber. And volunteer assistant coach Jim Ellis has moved on to 
a full-time coaching job with San Jose in the Continental Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
New faces are junior guard Tony Walker, a speedy transfer from Ventura College, 
6-9 freshman forward Chris Scott and 5-11 guard Greg Walker, a walk-on 
freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Another new face: Paul Westhead Jr., a recent Fordham University graduate, who 
is helping his father as a graduate assistant. 
</P>
<P>
One more new face will be seen frequently around Gersten Pavilion: Jung Myung 
Lim, a coach of the South Korean national team, who will observe the Lions all 
season at games and practices. His visit was arranged by U.S. coaching adviser 
Pete Newell. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions are expected to battle Pepperdine for the West Coast Conference title 
and are gunning for a third straight appearance in the NCAA Tournament. And 
gunning is the accurate word. With Gathers, who averaged 32.7 points, Fryer 
(22.9), Kimble (16.8 in an injury-riddled season) and Stumer (9.6), the Lions 
figure to score as much, if not more, than last season, when they broke nearly 
every NCAA game and season record in averaging 112.5 points. Gathers is on 
virtually every preseason All-America team, with Kimble and Fryer making the 
top seniors lists as well. 
</P>
<P>
The only real hurdle is getting some big-time play out of one (or more) of the 
big men. Gathers and Stumer, both 6-7, are the team's best rebounders and will 
see action in the post. But both are really forwards. "We'll see who evolves," 
Westhead said. "If we can get some play out of Chris Knight, maybe Marcy (Lee), 
we'll see." 
</P>
<P>
That's the big IF in what could be a big season for Loyola.

TORRANCE KEEPS DROPPING GAMES THEY COULD WIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance High football Coach Rich Busia didn't feel like talking Friday, but it 
didn't matter. The look of disappointment on his face said it all. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth straight week, Busia watched his team lose a game it could have 
won, perhaps should have won. Palos Verdes rallied from a 21-10 deficit in the 
last four minutes to pull out a 23-21 victory on a 28-yard touchdown pass with 
nine seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
It was the latest frustration for a team that has endured more than its share 
of hard luck this year. The Tartars are 2-4 overall and 0-3 in the Bay League, 
but they easily could be unbeaten. They have either squandered a sizable lead 
or failed to capitalize on a potential game-winning scoring opportunity in each 
of their four losses to West Torrance, Santa Monica, Hawthorne and Palos 
Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance's tales of woe: 
</P>
<P>
Despite dominating the statistics, the Tartars fell to West, 14-8, in their 
final non-league game Sept. 23 when the Warriors' Josh Moore intercepted a pass 
by quarterback Rich Camou in the end zone with 44 seconds left after Torrance 
had driven to the West 21. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance built a 15-0 lead in a Bay League opener Sept. 28 against Santa 
Monica, but was shut out in the second half as the Vikings rallied for a 20-15 
victory. "We played well enough to win," Busia said afterward. "That's the sad 
part." 
</P>
<P>
The Tartars scored two touchdowns in the final 1:48 to pull within one point of 
Hawthorne on Oct. 7. Busia tried for a two-point conversion, but Hawthorne's 
Kalvein Latu intercepted Antone Williamson's pass at the goal line with 11 
seconds left to preserve a 13-12 win. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance built a 21-10 lead with 4:28 left to play last week against Palos 
Verdes only to watch the Sea Kings score two touchdowns in the final two 
minutes and escape with an improbable victory. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes Coach Bill Judy expressed his sympathy to Torrance after his 
team's dramatic comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to feel for their coaches," he said. "They're good guys. It's tough 
to lose like that." 
</P>
<P>
But behind every cloud is a silver lining. In Torrance's case, it arrives 
Friday night in the form of Inglewood's football team. The Sentinels are 0-5 
and have been outscored 189-20. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes' come-from-behind victory in the closing seconds against Torrance 
was the latest in a series of miracle wins the Sea Kings have pulled off on 
their home field in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger Coach Steve Carnes, whose team visits Palos Verdes for a Bay League 
game Friday afternoon, is aware of the mystique. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the Olympians played at Palos Verdes, in 1986, Matt Seaburn 
returned a kickoff for a touchdown in the final minute to give the Sea Kings an 
18-13 victory. 
</P>
<P>
How is Leuzinger preparing for Friday's game? 
</P>
<P>
"We've sent a lot of our players to church this week," Carnes quipped. "We'll 
have the Hail Mary on our side." 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills senior Steve Clover, a 6-foot-4 guard and one of the South Bay's 
most heavily recruited basketball players, has narrowed his list of prospective 
colleges to Pepperdine, Loyola Marymount, USC and St. Mary's, according to 
Rolling Hills Coach Cliff Warren. 
</P>
<P>
Warren said Clover will most likely sign a letter of intent during the early 
one-week signing period beginning Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
In his third year as a varsity starter, Clover averaged 18 points a game last 
season in helping Rolling Hills capture its third consecutive Bay League title 
and reach the quarterfinals of the Southern Section 3-A playoffs. He is 
considered one of the area's top outside shooters, making him especially 
attractive to colleges that utilize the three-point shot. 
</P>
<P>
Warren said Clover is the most sought-after player he's had in five years at 
Rolling Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Former St. Bernard basketball standout David Whitmore hit the first basket of 
Tulane's midnight scrimmage Sunday, signaling the return of the sport at the 
New Orleans university. 
</P>
<P>
Tulane suspended its basketball program after the 1985 season because of 
point-shaving allegations and other improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
In that regard, it was somewhat fitting that Whitmore scored the opening 
basket. The 6-5 junior guard must sit out this season after transferring from 
Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES -- Carson's basketball team has been selected to play the Korean 
Junior Olympic Team in an exhibition Nov. 2 at Carson. The L.A. City Section is 
allowing the Colts to begin practice a few weeks early to prepare for the game, 
which will be played under high school rules instead of international rules . . 
. For the second consecutive week, four Bay League football teams are ranked in 
the Southern Section Division II poll. Hawthorne is ranked second behind 
Thousand Oaks, Leuzinger is third, Rolling Hills is eighth and Palos Verdes is 
ninth . . . Beverly Hills will forfeit all of its athletic contests, except in 
water polo, until the district's teachers strike is settled. The Normans, who 
are tied with Palos Verdes for third place in the Bay League football race, are 
scheduled to meet Santa Monica on Friday. A win will be awarded to Santa Monica 
if Beverly Hills does not show up . . . The Chadwick girls volleyball team, 
ranked second in the Southern Section Small School Division coaches poll, 
improved to 9-0 Tuesday in the Prep League with a 15-5, 15-2, 8-15, 15-4 win 
over Rio Hondo Prep. Shannon Davenport led the Dolphins with 19 kills.

GAMBRELL CASE CASTS A SHADOW OVER FOOTBALL TEAM AT MOORPARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was late afternoon and the sun danced across the Moorpark College athletic 
field as another football practice began. It was, as the long shadows plainly 
showed, nearly the end of another day. But for James Gambrell, this day, this 
very long day, was about to begin. 
</P>
<P>
Gambrell had loosened up with his teammates and was preparing to break off into 
his specialty group with the other receivers. But before the first pass was 
thrown, the field became smothered in silence. Two men in suits and ties were 
striding slowly but purposefully toward midfield. Toward Gambrell. 
</P>
<P>
In seconds, one of them brought out a pair of handcuffs and snapped them 
smartly onto Gambrell's wrists. Then, flanking the 19-year-old football player, 
they led him off the field as his teammates and coaches looked on in stunned 
silence. 
</P>
<P>
Gambrell, Moorpark's leading receiver, faces a felony charge of assault for his 
alleged role in the beating death of a fellow student earlier this year. His 
preliminary hearing is Nov. 17. If convicted, he faces as many as four years in 
prison and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
He is not the first Moorpark football player to be charged in the attack on 
John Flores, 19, who died from massive head injuries sustained during a brawl 
at a party in Thousand Oaks on Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Larnell Bush, a defensive back who starred for the Raiders last 
season and was expected back this year, was sentenced to 90 days in jail after 
being convicted of assault against Flores. He is due to be released from jail 
later this month after serving 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
The cloud hanging over the Moorpark team in the wake of Bush's felony 
conviction and the felony charges against Gambrell has apparently not affected 
the team's play, however. The Raiders are 4-1 this season, their lone defeat a 
one-point loss last week to Bakersfield, the junior college national champion 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
And Gambrell, a sophomore from Clovis, Calif., who was the team's top receiver 
last season, is having another outstanding season. He has 20 receptions for 263 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all learned how to leave our personal problems off the field," Moorpark 
receiver Pete Marine said. "We can hang up our problems in our lockers when 
it's time to play." 
</P>
<P>
The first repercussion -- Bush's arrest and conviction -- from that ill-fated 
party in January shocked Moorpark administrators, students and coaches during 
the winter and again in the summer. The second stark reminder swept down on 
Moorpark's campus with a heavy hand Oct. 5, the day of Gambrell's arrest on the 
practice field. 
</P>
<P>
"That was tough," Marine said. "When they took James off the field that day, it 
was a real shock." 
</P>
<P>
Mack Humphrey, a defensive back, said that the action left his teammates 
speechless. 
</P>
<P>
"We had heard about the trouble from the party," he said, "but we really didn't 
think much of it. We figured it was all over and done with. But then, when 
those two guys in suits walk across our practice field and handcuff your 
starting receiver and take him away, that was a real shock. I think a lot of us 
were stunned." 
</P>
<P>
Gambrell was released later that day on $5,000 bail and he returned to practice 
the next day. He played a fine game a day later against Pierce College, leading 
the team in receptions with three for 49 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Moorpark's coaching staff and administration have taken this 
simple approach to the problem: It is not a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no discussion of James Gambrell's situation among the 
administration," said Paul Dunham, Moorpark's athletic director. "I'm sure all 
of us have given it some thought, but we have never discussed any possible 
measures. There has never been any talk of suspending him. 
</P>
<P>
"But my thought is that a person is innocent until proven guilty. I don't know 
how anyone else at the school thinks about it, but that's what I think." 
</P>
<P>
The football coach, Jim Bittner, had similar thoughts when he spoke with a 
Times reporter five days after Gambrell's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, James is still on the team," he said. "Nothing will 
change unless he's brought to trial and convicted. Then, naturally, he won't be 
on the team. When you are only accused of something, that doesn't mean a lot to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Bittner has declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
"We have never faced this kind of situation before," Dunham said. "It is new 
territory for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Moorpark College, nestled in the grassy hills at the end of the Simi 
Valley Freeway and seemingly far from the frenetic life of Los Angeles or the 
San Fernando Valley, would appear to be an unlikely place for such an ugly 
drama to unfold. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Holmes, the scene at the Jan. 20 
party in nearby Thousand Oaks was ugly. There was a lot of drinking at the 
party, according to Holmes, and an argument broke out between Flores and Bush. 
After the two got into a second argument, they went outside to fight, Holmes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush was pushed aside by another party-goer, John Terry Yurek, 20, of 
Northridge, who is the brother of Moorpark football player Scott Yurek. John 
Yurek threw Flores to the sidewalk and began slamming Flores' head against the 
pavement, the prosecutor said. At that time, Holmes alleges, Bush and Gambrell 
waded through the crowd and began kicking the already-injured Flores in the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
Yurek was charged with manslaughter for his alleged role in the attack, but he 
was acquitted in September. During Yurek's trial, however, the jury heard 
testimony from a Chatsworth woman, Jaime Franco, that linked Gambrell to the 
beating. Franco, also a student at Moorpark College, testified that later that 
night, when she returned to an apartment shared by Gambrell and her boyfriend, 
Gambrell gave her a pair of heavy hiking boots and told her to dispose of them. 
She further testified that Gambrell told her that he had kicked Flores while 
wearing the boots. 
</P>
<P>
Gambrell was later called to the witness stand in the Yurek trial, but he 
refused to testify on the grounds that his testimony might be 
self-incriminating. 
</P>
<P>
"We have those hiking boots," Holmes said. "They are currently being analyzed 
for any further evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Gambrell has been silent. But even as his football success 
continues, teammates can see a change. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he's worried about it," Marine said. "I know that he thinks about it 
all the time. He somehow puts it aside when we play football, but I can tell 
that it's on his mind all the time."

AMR Corp.: The Ft. Worth-based parent of American Airlines said third-quarter 
earnings fell nearly 9% to $137 million. Chairman Robert L. Crandall said the 
fourth-quarter outlook also was "unhappy." Crandall attributed the poor 
showing, which had been expected, to an 11% jump in fuel costs and lower 
revenue per passenger mile. Revenue increased to $2.73 billion from $2.33 
billion in the same period last year.

Northrop Corp.: The Los Angeles-based defense contractor said its third-quarter 
profit fell 23% to $21.5 million, blaming the decline in part on less research 
and development work on such projects as the B-2 stealth bomber. The company, 
which lost $78.1 million in the second quarter, also noted that it had made 
fewer deliveries of its F-A-18 fighters. Revenue for the quarter ended Sept 30 
dipped 8% to 1.25 billion from $1.36 billion a year earlier.

FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
Northrop -- Northrop Corp.'s 23% drop in third-quarter earnings was primarily 
attributable to higher-than-anticipated costs on a number of fixed-price 
research and development contracts undertaken some years ago in the electronics 
business segment. In Thursday's Business section, the decline was attributed to 
less research and development work on such projects as the B-2 stealth bomber.

Mark Smith, 32, of Montrose, won a $15,000 Mazda Miata Wednesday morning on 
KIIS-FM's Rick Dees Show and promptly turned the prize over to the Red Cross 
earthquake fund to aid victims of Tuesday's Bay Area disaster. Smith won the 
prize for naming the right radio tune. The management of KIIS-FM decided to 
match Smith's $15,000 gift and awarded him another car -- demanding that he 
keep it. "I still don't know what I'm going to do," said Smith, senior program 
director of the Crescenta-Canada Family YMCA. "I may yet give this one up too. 
It's been a crazy day." ALEENE MacMINN

Talk-show host Geraldo Rivera is heading for San Francisco, where he will tape 
a show Monday focusing on the "heroes" of Tuesday's devastating earthquake and 
telling viewers what they can do to help victims of the disaster. The show will 
air later next week. Two weeks ago, Oprah Winfrey went to Charleston, S.C., to 
broadcast from the scene of the Hurricane Hugo devastation. Her program brought 
in more than $1 million in credit-card donations within the first 24 hours.

Seventy years later, Bob Shields, 49, aims to follow in Hartman's foamy 
footsteps. But his brewing operation might be shut even sooner; the "brewpub" 
that he and his wife Trudy hope to open by December is in a downtown Ventura 
building that is on a city hit list to be demolished within five years. 
</P>
<P>
Shields Brewing Co., at Santa Clara Street and Ventura Avenue, would join the 
ranks of about three dozen California restaurants that brew their own beer on 
the premises. Shields' offerings would include Channel Islands Ale, a dark, 
reddish-brown beer, high in hops with a malty flavor, and Gold Coast Beer, a 
light, amber beer with less hops taste than the ale. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to find it much more flavorful and tastier than anything that 
they're used to in a bottle," Shields said. Some time down the road, a stout 
would be added to the menu. 
</P>
<P>
But the road might dead end before too many glasses are hoisted. 
</P>
<P>
Shields' building, which he leases from Santa Clara Properties, sits smack in 
the middle of a three-block area designated by the city for redevelopment. This 
means that the city wants to tear down most of the businesses there to make way 
for four- to six-story office buildings, said Miriam Mack, Ventura's 
redevelopment administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment plans are still in the early stages, Mack said. But if they 
are approved, the brewpub, as well as a veterinarian's office, a sporting goods 
store, the Smart &amp; Final Iris Co., an auto body shop and other businesses 
might have to go. Mack said the brewpub building -- a gray, boxy, brick affair 
built 40 years ago as a welding shop -- has virtually no historic or 
architectural value. 
</P>
<P>
Shields, a former president of the Downtown Ventura Assn., disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"These buildings have a charm and should be saved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shields, who has sunk more than $300,000 into his project, said he intends to 
fight the city with petitions and thinks that he has a good chance of remaining 
at his location. He said he believes that Ventura residents will challenge the 
demolition. 
</P>
<P>
Shields owns and operates Curly's Upholstery in the same building next to the 
planned brewery. He said he leased the Strong Steel Building four years ago -- 
before the city hatched its redevelopment plans -- specifically to pursue his 
dream of opening a brewpub. 
</P>
<P>
The industrial characteristics of the building add to the planned atmosphere. 
The high, varnished, hardwood ceiling is crisscrossed with exposed pipes 
painted a dark reddish brown; stainless steel vats and beer tanks gleam behind 
glass walls; ceiling fans and warehouse lamps give the building the feel of a 
working environment. 
</P>
<P>
The long, whitewashed mahogany bar, accented with mint-green bar pads and 
stools, peach walls and the terra-cotta tile floor, give a Southern California 
accent. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing we're trying to do is to get people to feel they're in a hospitality 
room of a real working brewery," Shields said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the beer is to be brewed at the site, Shields said it will be fresh and 
distinctive in flavor, reminiscent of beer brewed at European pubs and taverns. 
He said the beer will come directly to the taps from 210-gallon tanks, through 
lines run under the floor. 
</P>
<P>
To ready his brewpub for opening, Shields said he has worked 10 to 12 hours a 
day seven days a week. He has done most of the building, plumbing and wiring 
himself, applying his 27 years of experience as an electrician and builder. 
</P>
<P>
Shields, broad-shouldered with graying brown, curly hair, said he first began 
brewing beer at home in Ojai as a child with his father, who would cook the 
grains in the kitchen and store the beer in glass water bottles. Shields took 
it up on his own about 10 years ago and was bitten by the brewpub bug on a 
vacation to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"We were driving through a little town up in British Columbia, and I was 
reading a local paper, and there was an article about a local pub that brewed 
its own beer," he said. "It was such a phenomenon in the tavern to brew beer 
and open it once a year and drink it." 
</P>
<P>
It has become less phenomenal in the United States in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, California passed a law allowing "microbreweries" to sell beer on the 
premises. Small manufacturers, who previously were only allowed to sell their 
products to distributors and then retailers, can now be manufacturers and 
retailers with one license. In 1987, the federal government also adopted 
regulations for microbreweries and brewpubs. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the businesses have boomed, with about 95 brewpubs in operation 
across the country, according to Jeff Mandel of the Assn. of Brewers, a trade 
group based in Boulder, Colo. In 1982, there were only six microbreweries, but 
now there are 160, he said.

VENTURA COUNTY PITCHES IN TO AID QUAKE AREA; 
</P>
<P>
DISASTER: SEABEES AND RED CROSS WORKERS HAVE BEEN DISPATCHED TO BOLSTER THE 
EFFORTS TO RESTORE UTILITIES AND HELP VICTIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Ventura County residents were quick Wednesday to join in the relief effort for 
victims of Tuesday's killer earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Two-hundred Seabees assigned to the Naval Construction Battalion Center in Port 
Hueneme were airlifted to the stricken area to help restore water and sewer 
service to military families in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty people were mobilized at the Channel Islands Air National Guard station 
at Point Mugu by leaders of the California Air National Guard, who sent four 
relief planes carrying medical supplies and police to the earthquake area. 
</P>
<P>
And a trio of Red Cross volunteers from Ventura were dispatched by truck to 
deliver cots, blankets and other supplies for use by Bay Area residents left 
homeless by the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Red Cross officials issued an appeal for donations of cash and 
blood and for extra volunteers willing to work in the quake-ravaged region in 
the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The Red Cross' national disaster fund was already depleted by Hurricane Hugo," 
said Lenore Gabel, a spokeswoman for the relief agency's Ventura chapter. "The 
best thing people can do now is continue to make contributions of cash." 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers Betty Jimenez of Oxnard and Larry Dawes and Robert Lefever of 
Ventura were dispatched with a vanload of supplies to Burlingame late Wednesday 
morning, Gabel said. 
</P>
<P>
Dawes and Lefever were advised that they would be asked to spend the remainder 
of the week shuttling emergency supplies around the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez -- who is a leader of the Red Cross disaster team in Oxnard -- was told 
to stay in the earthquake area for at least three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Gabel said that 300 other trained volunteers are available in Ventura County 
and that training sessions have been scheduled for next week to beef up that 
force. 
</P>
<P>
Methods of dealing with general emergency relief, damage assessment and 
emergency assistance for families will be taught Tuesday night and the weekend 
of Oct. 28-29 at locations to be determined later, she said. 
</P>
<P>
County residents willing to donate blood should contact United Blood Services 
at (805) 654-1600, she said. Blood types O positive, O negative and A negative 
are especially needed, although all blood types will be accepted, Gabel said. 
</P>
<P>
People willing to donate cash can do so at any Bank of A. Levy branch or by 
sending a check to the Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund at P.O. Box AR, Ventura 
93002, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's Bay Area temblor came as county Red Cross officials continued to 
solicit donations to help finance continuing relief work for victims of 
Hurricane Hugo, which devastated parts of the Caribbean and South Carolina last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday, county residents had contributed $28,000. Local Red Cross 
administrators had set a goal of $62,100 in donations. 
</P>
<P>
Two area volunteers -- Dale Carnathan of Ojai and Carol Holmes of Agoura -- 
have worked in St. Croix, Virgin Islands, since Hugo's 100-m.p.h. winds raked 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
The Port Hueneme Seabees were accompanied by forklifts, trenchers and other 
heavy equipment when they were ferried to the Bay Area on Wednesday by C-130 
Hercules cargo planes, said Connie Taylor, spokeswoman for the Naval 
Construction Battalion Center. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said about 2,000 families living on Navy bases in the San Francisco 
region were left without water or sewer service. She said construction experts 
from Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 3 were also being assigned to 
emergency runway repair duties at the Alameda Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
She said it was unknown whether the Seabees will also be asked to help with 
civilian rescue efforts that were under way Wednesday in San Francisco, where 
some apartment buildings were reported to have collapsed, or in Oakland, where 
a section of double-decked freeway fell atop hundreds of motorists. 
</P>
<P>
Some Port Hueneme-based Seabees who were completing a routine training session 
at Fort Hunter Liggett east of Monterey were rushed directly to the Bay Area, 
Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the same Seabees were also involved in relief efforts after Hurricane 
Hugo, she said. Eighty-five of them were sent to Charleston, S. C., and 200 
others were dispatched to Puerto Rico to help with cleanup work, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the California Air National Guard said three planeloads of medical 
supplies were rushed to Travis Air Force Base near San Francisco. A fourth 
plane carrying police officers for duty in the Santa Cruz area was sent at noon 
Wednesday to Watsonville, said Lt. Col. David Woolsey. 
</P>
<P>
About 60 guardsmen were mobilized to serve as flight and ground crews for the 
emergency airlift. Woolsey said the unit was waiting for instructions for 
additional flights from Guard officials in Sacramento.

CAMARILLO'S WEEKEND FIESTA TO MARK CITY'S 25TH BIRTHDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Camarillo will celebrate its 25 years as a city with dancing, races and 
entertainment in a celebration this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The city was incorporated by 2,402 voters on Sept. 29, 1964. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo's annual Fiesta will be off to a running start Saturday with a 5K and 
10K race and a 5K fitness walk. Runners will compete in 12 categories, with two 
divisions for men and women. The event begins at 8:30 a.m. at Adolfo Camarillo 
High School, 4660 Mission Oak Blvd. Entry fees are $15 for the race and $8 for 
the walk. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, Les Brown and his Band of Renown will bring ballroom music to 
the city for a fiesta-anniversary dance at the Bill Esty Community Center, 3701 
Las Posas Road. The dance begins at 8:30 p.m., and tickets are $20. 
</P>
<P>
"An Evening of Celebration and Remembrance," starting at 7 p.m. Sunday, will 
culminate the weeklong anniversary fete and will feature former council 
members' recollections of the city's early days. City artifacts and historical 
documents will be on display, and music will be provided by the 25th 
Anniversary Band, directed by John Herman. Pianist Robert Correll will perform 
a special composition written for the event: "Concerto de Camarillo." 
</P>
<P>
The Bill Esty Community Center, named after longtime Camarillo resident F. 
Burrows (Bill) Esty, will be officially dedicated at 6:30 p.m. Esty played a 
role in the Camarillo community for 13 years, including serving eight years on 
the Camarillo City Council, with two terms as mayor in 1983 and 1986, serving 
as director of the Camrosa Water Board and as president of the Leisure Village 
Homeowners' Association. 
</P>
<P>
Although the program is free, tickets are required for admission to Sunday's 
celebration because of limited seating. Tickets are available at Camarillo 
Community Bank, Camarillo Library and Camarillo City Hall. For more information 
on the race and dance, call the Pleasant Valley Recreation and Park District 
Office, 805-482-1996.

OXNARD COUNCIL OKS PACT GIVING WORKERS 3.9% RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than three months of negotiations, the Oxnard City Council this week 
ratified a contract with its employees union. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 clerical, technical and professional employees represented by the 
Public Employees Assn. of Ventura County have worked without a contract since 
July 8. 
</P>
<P>
The new contract provides a 3.9% salary increase in January, with an additional 
2.25% increase to some employees in June. 
</P>
<P>
A medical benefits increase of $50 per employee per month is retroactive to 
Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 3 to 0 to ratify the contract. Council members Geraldine Furr 
and Manuel Lopez were absent. 
</P>
<P>
While "it's not a bad adjustment," the contract still fails to compensate 
Oxnard employees as much as workers in cities of comparable size, said Barry 
Hammitt, union director. Oxnard employees earn about 30% less than their 
counterparts in comparable cities, he claimed. 
</P>
<P>
The ratification comes in the midst of serious budget problems in Oxnard. 
Struggling to complete this fiscal year without drawing from reserves, the city 
must chop expenses by about $750,000, City Manager David Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
The city in recent weeks has announced that it will eliminate its director of 
economic development, a position held by Mike Haviland, for a savings of 
$60,000. The Economic Development Department will be combined with the 
Redevelopment Department on Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council also eliminated a deputy city attorney's position, held by 
David Kennedy, who had started work Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
The city announced two weeks ago that its estimated 1988-89 revenue is about 
$1.7 million less than expected, while expenditures are about $850,000 more. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the council adopted a 1989-90 budget with service-level reductions of 
$1.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the council withdrew $805,000 from reserve funds, which it 
has been forced to do several times since the 1986-87 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard remains at an impasse with the its firefighters union. The 87 union 
members have repeatedly criticized the council for failure to meet their 
contract demands and for cutting fire services to save money.

VENTURA OFF TO BEST START EVER AFTER 5TH VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura College football team, ranked fourth in Southern California and 
seventh in the state in this week's JC Grid Wire poll, established a school 
record for consecutive wins to start a season (five) with its 24-14 win over L. 
A. Valley last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The next five games, however, are the most critical. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura (5-0 overall, 4-0 in the Western State Conference) plays five WSC 
Northern Division foes that have a combined record of 16-7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura begins the stretch run Saturday at 7:30 p.m. in its Homecoming game 
against Santa Barbara (4-1, 3-1). The match-up is the latest chapter of a 
25-year rivalry and The Big Game trophy, currently in Santa Barbara's 
possession, is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara quarterback Ted Robison leads the conference in total offense 
with 1,181 yards. He has thrown for 1,144 yards and Santa Barbara averages a 
conference-best 272 passing yards. 
</P>
<P>
Robison's most-common target has been Greg Borgquist, who has 32 receptions for 
491 yards to lead the conference in both categories. 
</P>
<P>
Punting: Ventura punter Tim Albrent is tied for second in the conference with a 
40.0-yard average. Jason Thompson of Southwest leads with a 40.2 average. 
</P>
<P>
Albrent, however, will have to kick to Santa Barbara's Byron Wade. Wade leads 
the conference with a 16.5 return average. 
</P>
<P>
Foot-brawl: Ventura's game with Valley was a physical contest that ended with a 
10-minute brawl on the field among fans and players from both schools. 
</P>
<P>
A pushing match between players began after the final horn and -- with only two 
security guards present and the game officials sprinting for the locker room -- 
it quickly escalated to numerous scuffles. 
</P>
<P>
Some were doused with alcoholic beverages and others left with bloody lips. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an unfortunate situation," Coach Phil Passno said. "It was a pretty 
emotional game. But at that point, it shouldn't have happened. The game was 
over." 
</P>
<P>
On the rebound: The vaunted Moorpark College defense, which had surrendered 
only 17 points in its first four games, nearly doubled its season total of 
points allowed in a 28-27 loss to Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
The defending state champion, Bakersfield has not lost in 16 games, but 
Saturday Moorpark (4-1) will play host to a team that wins about as frequently 
as Bakersfield loses. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor College finished last in the WSC last year with a 1-10 record and had 
won only three games in the past two years. This season, though, Harbor has a 
new coach, Don Weems, who has already doubled the win total from last season. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor (2-3) features what Weems calls a "vertical" passing offense, but the 
Moorpark defense has a bunch of guys who specialize in making opponents 
horizontal. Moorpark linebacker Tom Briggs had four sacks against Bakersfield, 
and Moorpark outgained Bakersfield, 445 yards to 329. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield won on a touchdown and two-point conversion with 5:05 remaining. 
Freddie Bradley rushed for 93 yards and Jayson Merrill passed for 324 yards to 
lead Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Lights ... action: Channel Islands High has a bye this week but the players are 
suiting up anyway Friday night. The school is trying out its new stadium 
lights. 
</P>
<P>
A barbecue at 5 p.m. and a ceremony will precede two scrimmages beginning at 7. 
The freshman will scrimmage the junior varsity, followed by a varsity 
intra-squad scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands, which still needs to add bleachers, will continue to play its 
games at Hueneme High until next season. 
</P>
<P>
Changing of the guard: Because Ventura High upset Buena, 11-8, last Thursday in 
a Channel League water polo match, Ventura Coach Dale Hahn expected the Cougars 
to move past Buena in the Southern Section 2-A poll. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Buena (14-6 overall, 3-2 in the league) was third and Ventura (11-3, 
4-1) was seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"We had better be ahead of them," Hahn said with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. The Cougars moved up to sixth this week and Buena dropped out of 
the top 10. Dos Pueblos, which defeated Buena on Tuesday, is ranked fourth. 
</P>
<P>
The final poll is all that's important because the top four teams are seeded in 
the Southern Section playoffs. "At this point, the only value of the poll is to 
get into that kind of position among the top four," Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
School record: Ventura set a school record with 25 steals in its 11-8 win over 
Buena. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-five steals is unheard of," Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
Circus Fun strikes: Circus Fun, the plastic toy figure of a devil's head that 
was adopted by Ventura High's water polo team as its mascot, made another 
appearance last week. 
</P>
<P>
The toy is jokingly handed to each player for inspiration during time outs and 
floats in the pool water "to energize it." 
</P>
<P>
Jamey Pierce -- a senior outside shooter who discovered the toy -- made a 
template of the figure. After Ventura beat Buena last Thursday, the players 
spray-painted the figure on the shed beside the school pool and sprayed it next 
to last year's scores that are already painted alongside the pool. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura also added Thursday's score to the graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Running from the pack: Ventura College cross-country runner Jaime Galindo ran 
an average of about 100 miles a week this summer, and now he is running away 
from Division I competition. 
</P>
<P>
Galindo, a sophomore from Oxnard High, finished fifth with a five-mile time of 
25 minutes, five seconds at the prestigious Stanford Invitational on Oct. 7. 
Ventura was the only junior college invited. 
</P>
<P>
Galindo will attempt to win his second WSC mini-meet title this season Friday 
at Arroyal Verde Park in Ventura. Galindo has won the Moorpark Invitational and 
was second both at the Bakersfield Invitational and Santa Barbara Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ventura Coach Tuck Mason, Galindo is being recruited by numerous 
Division I schools. 
</P>
<P>
Included in that group is Arizona, which is expected to challenge powerhouse 
Oregon in the Pac-10 Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Beltowski officially out: Oxnard College basketball player Andy Beltowski, who 
injured his back this summer and his playing status was questionable this 
season, has officially been scratched off the Condors' roster. 
</P>
<P>
Beltowski, a 6-foot-5 forward, averaged nine points and eight rebounds for last 
year's 20-12 team. He and all-WSC player Randy Carter were the only returning 
starters. But the loss of Beltowski has left Coach Remy McCarthy with an 
inexperienced group. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a devastating blow," McCarthy said. "There is no way to measure his 
value to this team." 
</P>
<P>
Cardinals flying: The Ventura County Cardinals' semi-pro football team is 
leading the High Desert League with a 6-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura beat the previously-unbeaten Riverside Rams, 51-29, last Sunday as 
34-year-old Oxnard High assistant coach Joe Davis was 17 of 20 passing for 323 
yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura (9-0 overall) plays the Los Angeles Mustangs in a league game Sunday at 
Crenshaw High.

CAMARILLO READIES FOR MT. SAC ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Camarillo High's powerhouse boys' cross-country team, second in the Mt. San 
Antonio College Invitational last year, will make another run at the event's 
team sweepstakes title Saturday at Mt. SAC in Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Scorpions, who were defeated by Christian Brothers Academy (N.J.), 
96-124, in the 1988 meet, will not have an easier task this year. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo, ranked No. 1 in the state after consecutive fourth-place finishes in 
the state Division I championships in 1987 and '88, must face the No. 2- 
through No. 5-ranked teams in Concord De La Salle, Canyon Country Canyon, 
Arroyo Grande and Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
Also in attendance will be Santa Ana Saddleback and Glendale Hoover, ranked 
fourth and fifth in the Southern Section 4-A Division; Hart, top ranked in the 
3-A; and L. A. Belmont, winner of seven consecutive City Section titles from 
1982 to '88. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of teams at Mt. SAC that scare me," Camarillo Coach Mike Smith 
said. "All the top teams are capable of beating each other." 
</P>
<P>
Smith's assessment is right on. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura, top ranked in the 2-A, upended Canyon, the No. 2 seeded in the 4-A, 
64-69, in the Kenny Staub Invitational Oct. 7. That same weekend, the Scorpions 
defeated Concord De La Salle, 49-95, for their second consecutive Stanford 
Invitational crown. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo, led by its senior foursome of Shawn Goetzinger (15:26 at Mt. SAC 
last year), Abe Valdez (15:31), Derek Kite (15:55) and Chad Malesich (15:59), 
unlike last year, isn't resting on its laurels just yet. 
</P>
<P>
"After last year, (my runners) think that Stanford beat us, not the state 
meet," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
After being ranked No. 1 in the 4-A through much of the 1988 season and having 
whipped a highly regarded Bend High (Ore.) squad at Stanford, Camarillo dropped 
a spine-tingler, 86-90, to Dana Hills, the eventual state Division I champion, 
in the 4-A final. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year after Stanford we continued to train hard and run well," Smith said, 
"but I think we thought it was going to come a little easier than it was going 
to." 
</P>
<P>
The boys' invitational sweepstakes race begins at 9:43 a.m. and the girls' team 
sweepstakes competition starts at 10:47. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' competition, Buena, second-ranked in the 4-A, and Channel Islands 
(sixth) will meet Agoura and Arroyo Grande, the Nos. 1 and 2 teams in the 2-A, 
in the team sweepstakes race. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs have won six Channel League titles in a row under Coach Steve 
Blum. Channel Islands, coached by Debbie Blum, Steve's wife, finished 12th in 
the 4-A championships last year. Agoura has been runner-up in the state 
Division I race the past two years.

CLASSIC '64 MODEL STILL RUNS STRONG; 
</P>
<P>
MIKE LARRABEE WON THE 400 METERS IN TOKYO OLYMPICS; NOW HE WALKS MOUNTAINS OF 
THE WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In many ways, the living room wall of Mike Larrabee's home in Santa Maria is 
identical to thousands of others across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Its wood panels are adorned with numerous photographs of family and friends. 
There are photos from weddings, graduations and vacations which chronicle 
events common to many families, but there are several photos which are unique. 
</P>
<P>
These photos are from the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo where Larrabee won gold 
medals in the 400-meter dash and the 1,600-meter relay. 
</P>
<P>
Larrabee's 400 victory in 45.1 seconds was 25 years ago today, and though it he 
didn't realize it at the time, he would later become the answer to two 
track-and-field trivia questions. 
</P>
<P>
He is the oldest man (30 years, 322 days) to win the 400 in the Olympics and he 
is the last white American to win an Olympic sprint event. 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, Ventura High renamed the football and track stadium after him. 
</P>
<P>
Larrabee's victory was noteworthy not only because it came in what was 
considered a young-man's event, and not only because it followed years of 
career-threatening injuries, but because he accomplished it in a bygone era of 
track and field. 
</P>
<P>
It was an era when American athletes were paid little, if any, money for their 
exploits, despite the fact that meets such as the UCLA-USC dual meet in the Los 
Angeles Coliseum annually drew 70,000-80,000 fans in the late 1950s and early 
'60s. 
</P>
<P>
It was an era when athletes held full-time jobs to support themselves and their 
families, and thus, few athletes competed past their mid-20s, let alone into 
their early 30s. 
</P>
<P>
It was an era when steroids were something that few athletes knew much about. 
</P>
<P>
"I never expected to run as long as I did," says Larrabee, who graduated from 
Ventura High in 1952 and from USC in '57. "It just kind of happened. I always 
took it meet by meet, and year by year. I never had any master plan. But anyone 
who knew me would tell you that I loved to play. I'm still playing. 
</P>
<P>
"Track was play to me. It was fun. It was a big part of my social life. I 
really enjoyed running for the (Southern California) Striders. They were one of 
the big clubs and I had a good time with them." 
</P>
<P>
Having a good time has always been a major requirement in Larrabee's life. And 
it is still. 
</P>
<P>
His current passion is hiking and Larrabee has roamed mountains all over the 
world, including Mt. Aconcagua in Argentina, at 23,035 feet, the highest peak 
in North or South America, the Breighthorn and Weisshorn in Switzerland, Mt. 
Blanc in France, Mt. Whitney in California and Mt. Raineer in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Larrabee has long been master of the outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Farlow, an undergraduate at USC from 1958-62 and a half-miler (best of 1 
minute, 49.2 seconds) on the track team, said that Larrabee was a legend on the 
Southern Cal campus. Not for his athletic achievements, but for his pranks and 
social life. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy was close to insane," says Farlow chuckling. "He was the original 
animal house character. He lived the college life to the fullest. He was a 
maniac. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when he got married (1956) and started raising kids, he was still crazy 
as could be." 
</P>
<P>
Farlow, the co-track coach at Kennedy High in Granada Hills since 1971, said he 
could tell Larrabee stories for hours, but recalled a few that were 
particularly humorous. 
</P>
<P>
The first occured in what was then the white middle-class neighborhood 
surrounding USC. Larrabee and some of his buddies rigged up a speaker system 
without anyone knowing about it, then blasted the neighborhood with 
sound-effects records at three o'clock in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
"They terrorized that neighborhood on and off for about a year," Farlow says. 
"It would be in the middle of the night, and suddenly, these people are 
startled awake by jungle noises in the middle of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Another incident involved Larrabee and John Bragg, a high school buddy and 
frequently one of his prank partners. 
</P>
<P>
Larrabee offered Bragg $20 if he would run naked down sorority row at USC. 
Bragg took the offer under the condition that he got to pick the day and time. 
After agreeing on the specifics -- 2 a.m. when no one was apt to be around -- 
Larrabee distributed flyers throughout school about Bragg's upcoming run for 
glory. 
</P>
<P>
So when time came for the big event, there were rows of cars parked on the 
lawns of the houses facing the street. And when Bragg made his mad dash, 
everyone turned on their headlights. 
</P>
<P>
The third story involved Larrabee and several of his buddies in a local movie 
theater. After many of the patrons told them to quiet down, Larrabee and Co. 
dosed the entire audience with the theater fire hose, forcing them out of the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
To make sure no one forgot about him, there were "Larrabee was here" 
inscriptions in newly poured cement all over the SC campus. 
</P>
<P>
"He was zany, but I always liked being around him because he was so up all the 
time," says Bill Toomey, the 1968 Olympic gold medalist in the decathlon and a 
former world-record holder. "He's also a people person. He really cares about 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Underneath all the craziness was a very competitive person, according to both 
Farlow and Toomey, a training partner of Larrabee's from 1965-68. 
</P>
<P>
"He was one of the hardest workers I've ever seen," says Farlow, who taught 
with Larrabee at Monroe High in Sepulveda from 1963-68. "He was very intense in 
workouts, but he always had a good time doing it. The guy could have been an 
exceptional half miler if he had wanted to." 
</P>
<P>
Toomey said that Larrabee helped him develop into a great 400 runner, a 
decathlete who ran 45.6 in that event. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a lot of street smarts about how to compete against others," Toomey 
says. "He taught me the intricacies of all-out 300s. He taught me that you 
couldn't run all-out in races if you never did in workouts." 
</P>
<P>
Larrabee's young-at-heart attitude, love for the sport and work ethic were the 
main reasons he competed as long as he did. 
</P>
<P>
For his rise to the top of the 400 world in 1964 was a long, bumpy, and often 
times, painful journey. 
</P>
<P>
After placing fifth in the 220-yard dash at the state high school championships 
as a senior, Larrabee went to USC on a scholarship with high school bests of 
21.5 in the 220 and 51.2 in the 440. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the scholarship for the 200 time," he said. "I thought anyone who ran 
the 400 seriously was crazy. That was a crazy man's event." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that's why he concentrated on it once he got to college. 
</P>
<P>
After running 49.0 as a freshman, he improved to 47.8 as a sophomore, 46.5 as a 
junior and 46.2 as a senior, placing eighth in the Olympic Trials. However, he 
never placed higher than fifth in the NCAA championships (1954). 
</P>
<P>
One of the favorites in both 1955 and '56, Larrabee twice false started in his 
semifinal and was disqualified as a junior, and was sick with the flu as a 
senior. 
</P>
<P>
Running for the Southern California Striders in 1957, Larrabee improved his 
time to 46.0 and was ranked second in the world in the 400, but he tore his 
right hamstring muscle during a 200 race in Salt Lake City midway through the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Kerlan examined Larrabee's leg and told him that his career was 
over, which didn't come as earth-shattering news to the patient. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought maybe it was time to start settling down," says Larrabee, 55. "After 
all, I was married and working towards my Master's degree." 
</P>
<P>
The injury improved dramatically by the end of the year, however, and Larrabee 
was running again in 1958 and ranked sixth in the world in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
Undefeated in the early part of the Olympic year of 1960, Larrabee ruptured his 
right Achilles' tendon in a workout a few days after winning the prestigious 
Compton Invitational in the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Though the injury did not end his career -- as Kerlan again told him it would 
-- Larrabee missed the rest of the season and thought about what might have 
been as the United States' Otis Davis -- third behind Larrabee at the Coliseum 
-- defeated Carl Kaufmann of West Germany in the 400 at the Olympics in Rome 
that September. 
</P>
<P>
"That injury was hard to deal with," Larrabee says. "That was, without a doubt, 
the greatest disappointment of my athletic career. I took me a long time to get 
over it." 
</P>
<P>
The Achilles' continued to hamper Larrabee for the next three seasons, but in 
the fall of 1963, it started to improve as he worked harder than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Farlow remembered 10-mile training runs with Larrabee around the Veterans 
Hospital near Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
"He had never done that before," Farlow says. "So when 1964 rolled around, he 
was strong as an ox." 
</P>
<P>
Larrabee need every bit of his strength to overcome a severe case of 
pancreatitis -- an inflamation of the pancreas -- in March and April of the 
Olympic year. 
</P>
<P>
There were two Olympic Trials in 1964, making it a unique year in American 
track. According to the U.S. Olympic Committee, both meets were equally 
important, but Larrabee said that wasn't so. 
</P>
<P>
"If you won the first race, but didn't finish in the top three in the second, 
you weren't going to be on the team," Larrabee says. "But if you finished in 
the top three in the second meet, you were going to Tokyo." 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, Larrabee -- running with a 102-degree temperature -- 
finished sixth (46.6) in the first meet in Randalls Island, New York, on July 
4, then tied the world record of 44.9 in winning the second meet at the 
Coliseum on September 12. 
</P>
<P>
Larrabee's performance was outstanding, not only for its quality, but for the 
way he ran it. 
</P>
<P>
In an event where most of the world's elite frequently came through the first 
200 meters in under 22 seconds and then slowed to 23 or 24 in the final 200, 
Larrabee ran an even pace. His splits at the trials were 22.5 and 22.4. 
</P>
<P>
"Until 1964, I used to scream out the first 200 just like everyone else," 
Larrabee says. "But my Achilles couldn't handle it any more. In order to run 
the first half of the race fast, you've got to smash the ground hard. You've 
got to drive and I couldn't drive. I was more like a locomotive that built up 
speed as it went along." 
</P>
<P>
Though he was the favorite heading into the Games, Larrabee told reporters that 
there were five other competitors -- U.S. teammates Ulis Williams and Ollan 
Cassell, Wendell Mottley of Trinidad and Tobago, Robbie Brightwell of Great 
Britain and Andrzej Badenski of Poland -- who were capable of winning the gold 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Cassell, who was eliminated in the semifinals, all of the medal 
contenders qualified for the final. 
</P>
<P>
After running just fast enough to win his heat (46.8), quarterfinal (46.5) and 
semifinal (46.0), Larrabee was very confident of his chances in the final. And 
when he was informed of the lane assignments -- he was in five, with Brightwell 
in six, Mottley in seven, Williams in eight and the fast-starting Badenski in 
the tight confines of the inside lane -- he figured he was in even better 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
"It was as if I had hand-picked the lanes myself," Larrabee says. "I couldn't 
have asked for a better lane draw." 
</P>
<P>
The race went exactly how Larrabee thought it would. Mottley , Badenski, 
Williams and Brightwell went out fast, Mottley leading at the 200 in 21.6, 
while Larrabee was sixth in 22.5. Fifth at the 300 mark, Larrabee proceeded to 
swoop past those in front of him in the final straight, passing Mottley with 10 
meters left to win in 45.1. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have been shocked if I hadn't won," he says. "First of all, Mottley 
had run 45.7, 45.8 and 45.7 in his preceding races, while I had run just fast 
enough to win. On top of that, Mottley had pulled a hamstring muscle during the 
indoor season and hadn't run much outdoors. . . . Plus I always figured at that 
time that if I was within 10 meters of the leaders coming off the turn, I would 
win." 
</P>
<P>
The win capped a No. 1-ranked season for Larrabee and was the pinnacle in a 
athletic career that would last another four years. 
</P>
<P>
"It meant a lot to me inside because of what happened in '56 -- when I had the 
flu -- and in '60 -- when I injured my Achilles," Larrabee says. "It was 
something that I had been shooting for for a long time. But I never did it for 
the glory. In fact I ditched a parade in Fillmore for me after the Games." 
</P>
<P>
Though he enjoyed teaching in the San Fernando Valley, Larrabee moved with his 
wife Margaret, daughters Tracie and Lisa, and son Mike Jr., to Santa Maria in 
1968 to take over his mother's beer distributorship with his brother Terry. 
</P>
<P>
"I miss teaching," he says. "But the financial rewards in the beer business 
were substantially greater." 
</P>
<P>
The business also allowed him more leisure time, much of which he spent hiking 
and backpacking. 
</P>
<P>
Always looking to get the maximum enjoyment out of any endeavor, Larrabee 
started raising Llamas -- he has 18 of them -- in 1985 to use as pack animals. 
</P>
<P>
"I was tired of making myself a beast of burden by hiking with a 50- or 
60-pound pack on my back," Larrabee says. "And Llamas are a much better pack 
animal than a horse or mule in the mountains. They're smaller and they're much 
more sure-footed." 
</P>
<P>
Larrabee took great pride in his ascent of Aconcagua with college chum Bragg, 
but he doesn't plan any more four-week long hiking excursions. 
</P>
<P>
"Aconcagua was a grind," he says. "There's too many fun 13,000 and 14,000-foot 
mountains around here that you can climb in a day or two." 
</P>
<P>
Always looking for a new thrill, Larrabee recently added rock climbing to his 
repertoire of outdoor activities. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure it will help me in hiking too," he says. "I've been in some pretty 
tricky spots where knowing how to climb rocks would have helped." 
</P>
<P>
As Toomey said, Larrabee has always lived life to the fullest. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, they make a lot of money in track," Toomey says. "They're rich in 
dollars, but back then, track was rich in character. And he was probably as 
Shakespearean as anyone in that cast."

PLANE AND FANCY; 
</P>
<P>
IN SANTA MONICA, ITS WORLD CAPITAL, A SWIFT ODD AIRCRAFT KEEPS ITS FANS' DREAMS 
ALOFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
At rest on the Tarmac at Santa Monica Airport, the Long-EZs look a bit like a 
flock of overfed sea gulls relaxing in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
They certainly don't look like normal airplanes. Their noses touch the ground. 
Where there should be a tail, there's a propeller. Where there should not be a 
tail -- out at the tip of each wing -- there is one. 
</P>
<P>
But earthbound appearances are beside the point; this tiny experimental craft 
is built to fly. And flying, say the fanatics that have made Santa Monica 
Airport the Long-EZ capital of the world, is something the plane does very 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"All the rest are like station wagons in the air," says flight instructor 
Gulshin Gilbert. "The Long-EZ is a Ferrari." 
</P>
<P>
Just 17 feet long and tipping the scales at 700 pounds, the Long-EZ holds world 
speed and distance records for its class of home-built plane. It can climb 
1,400 feet in a minute, fly as high as 14,000 feet, and fly 2,000 miles without 
refueling. Its top speed is 204 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Built primarily of Styrofoam, epoxy, Fiberglas and plastics, the Long-EZ is 
light, free from corrosion, fuel-efficient and nearly stall-proof. 
</P>
<P>
The plane was designed in 1979 by Burt Rutan, the maverick aircraft designer 
who also created Voyager, the plane that entered aviation history in December, 
1986, by circumnavigating the globe on a single tank of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
In 10 years, the Long-EZ has attracted a following of aviation enthusiasts 
around the world. But the biggest single concentration is in Santa Monica, 
where more than 50 people -- doctors, actors, flight instructors, lawyers and 
business owners are spending hours every day building the planes in their 
garages, tinkering with them in an airport hangar, showing them off at air 
shows, or simply flying them. 
</P>
<P>
The early Long-EZs were sold as kits by Rutan, but he has since quit the 
business. Newer ones are now made from scratch by builders who work with plans 
obtained from other owners. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a simple process -- those who work at it part-time can take two to 
four years to build the plane -- but it is relatively cheap. Whereas a 
conventional two-seater, such as a 9-year-old Cessna 152, might cost about 
$40,000, a Long-EZ runs about $20,000 -- plus labor, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is built by amateurs and hobbyists, the Long-EZ is classified by the 
Federal Aviation Administration as an experimental plane, and therefore cannot 
be used for any commercial purposes. Nevertheless, FAA inspector Lyle Alexander 
says he thinks it "is a great airplane" that "would pass all the tests" if it 
ever went into production. 
</P>
<P>
Though a varied bunch, the members of the Santa Monica Long-EZ contingent seem 
to have three things in common: They enjoy the process of construction, they 
love to fly, and they praise the "inventive genius" of Rutan. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first plane I fell in love with," says flight instructor Gilbert, who 
has flown a wide variety of Cessnas, Pipers, helicopters and sailplanes. "It 
has incredible visibility. The canopy is completely clear. The sound of the air 
flow is like that in a glider. It's very maneuverable. You think of a turn, and 
you will have turned. It's so light on the control." 
</P>
<P>
Each Long-EZ, however, is "only as good as the builder," Gilbert cautions. 
Almost all the problems that may arise can be traced either to faulty 
implementation of the construction plan or a pilot's error in judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Westside businessman Stan Shniderman, 56, says Rutan's genius is reflected in 
the manufacturing process. 
</P>
<P>
"Burt had laid the plans out as an education in itself," says Shniderman, who 
bought the blueprint for the plane and a list of the necessary materials from 
Rutan in 1985. "It was not one big job but 100,000 small jobs. Fixing the glass 
there, putting the epoxy here, cutting the template. And at the end I had made 
a remarkable plane." 
</P>
<P>
If Shniderman needed any confirmation, he got it in April when he and five 
others flew from Santa Monica to Lakeland, Fla., to participate in races 
organized by the Experimental Aircraft Assn. The team won five trophies and the 
Long-EZ bagged the first, second, third and fourth ranks in its category. 
</P>
<P>
Not merely speedy and maneuverable, the Long-EZ also has a remarkable range. A 
normally equipped model can routinely make a 2,000-mile trip. The record is 
3,970 nautical miles, or about statute 4,560 miles, set by Dick Rutan, the 
brother of the designer, who also was co-pilot of Voyager on its global 
circuit. Dick Rutan's 1981 flight, in a Long-EZ equipped with an auxiliary fuel 
tank, went from Anchorage, Alaska, to the Turk Islands in the West Indies in 
just over 30 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The Long-EZ is "probably the safest and the only modern airplane in the field," 
says lawyer David Orr, 43, a former Air Force pilot in Vietnam who finished 
building his Long-EZ a year and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It has one of the most forgiving designs and has the advantage that the pilot 
is uniquely knowledgeable about the mechanics of the airplane," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Orr is one of the founders and an active member of Squadron 2, a group of about 
35 Long-EZ owners or builders in Santa Monica. Group members meet frequently to 
share new ideas regarding design improvement and problems in construction. It 
also organizes guest lectures and seminars featuring professionals from the 
aircraft industry and related fields, and it welcomes aviation enthusiasts who 
are interested in building their own planes. 
</P>
<P>
But there has been a sharp fall in the design and production of homemade 
planes. Rutan stopped selling plans for Long-EZ and other experimental craft in 
1985 because of concerns about liability. 
</P>
<P>
Orr says Rutan's decision to pull out of the business is a symptom of a broader 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The aviation business is stuck," he says, "because developments are 
discouraged by litigation. Whenever a plane crashes, the mass media are all 
over them. . . . The same can't be said of a car crash." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Long-EZ contingent in Santa Monica suggest that the enthusiasm for 
home-built planes in general may also be on the ebb because busy people simply 
don't have the time. 
</P>
<P>
But if Stan Shniderman had any worries about the Long-EZ's future, he left them 
on the ground on the day last week when he took a visitor up for a spin. 
</P>
<P>
He soared quickly to 3,000 feet over the ocean. He gave the control stick a 
gentle jab, and the plane cut circles in the air. Then he executed some sharp 
turns and pirouettes. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Shniderman removed both hands from the controls and shouted into the 
microphone: "It's so easy!" 
</P>
<P>
From the rear seat, it certainly appeared so.

DEL REY RESIDENTS RALLY THEIR FORCES TO MARCH ON CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN YAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Del Rey resident Tom Meza on Saturday planted a 5-foot-wide sign in the front 
yard of an alleged drug dealer. Decorated with a fist and a pointing finger, 
the sign read: "We know who you are; you deal early in the morning and deal 
late at night. You're making big bucks, but it's a matter of time before you'll 
be making big time in jail." 
</P>
<P>
Meza's sign put into words the message to gang members and drug dealers that he 
and about 120 other people were sending as they marched from their Del Rey 
homes to a lot next to the Pacific Police Station on Culver Boulevard. The 
rally's organizer, the Del Rey Homeowners and Neighbors Assn., four weeks ago 
distributed 5,000 flyers to attract supporters for its campaigns against crime. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers hoped to rally support for the goals of the homeowners group, which 
include keeping an eye on judges' sentencing records and possibly targeting for 
defeat judges who hand down "lenient" sentences. 
</P>
<P>
The group also plans to lobby legislatures for laws tailored to deal with gangs 
and drug dealers. For example, the group wants a law requiring spray-paint cans 
to be sold from behind the counter to deter gang members from stealing paint 
for graffiti. They want to put the "bite and teeth" of federal penal laws into 
California laws, to decrease chances of the reoccurrence of a Sylmar situation, 
in which state authorities handed its case against major drug importers to 
federal agents because state laws were considered not tough enough for drug 
dealers. Los Angeles area police and federal agents recently confiscated about 
20 tons of cocaine in a Sylmar warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had guys arrested, and they're out the very next day doing the same 
thing they did the day before," said Charlotte De Meo, a member of the 
homeowners group and a 17-year resident of Del Rey. "I want those people 
arrested; I want them in jail. But our laws are not set up to handle the drug 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
De Meo, a Neighborhood Watch block captain, said her group will petition for 
law changes, write to legislators and use retired workers as a resource. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like," she said, "to get some of our senior citizens, who have more 
time, to go into some of our courts and just watch, see how many they let go in 
the period of a day." 
</P>
<P>
Del Rey residents already have asked attorneys how they can change laws and 
sent a letter to a judge who they believe unfairly dismissed a case against car 
burglars. A copy of the letter also was sent to Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the group sent letters to 25 apartment owners, requesting them to 
install lights in alleys, clean their properties and report crime.

BEVERLY HILLS TO REFINANCE LOAN ON NEW CIVIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with the unpleasant alternatives of raising taxes or cutting its budget, 
the Beverly Hills City Council has decided instead to refinance the debt on the 
city's imposing new Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Max Salter voted against the measure at Tuesday night's meeting, calling 
it "credit card living" that will amount to a tax on future generations. 
</P>
<P>
But the other four council members agreed with city staffers, who said that 
taking advantage of lower interest rates will save more than $600,000 in 
finance charges and bring in several million dollars to help complete the Civic 
Center and pay for new and existing programs. 
</P>
<P>
The debt, now due to expire in 15 years, will be extended until 2019, but 
Councilman Allan L. Alexander defended it as a prudent decision. 
</P>
<P>
"The life of the Civic Center will be significantly longer than the period 
we're talking about," he said. "And we're doing it at a time when interest 
rates are at the second lowest point that they have been in the last 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
The refinancing deal is expected to bring in an additional $30 million, raising 
the Civic Center debt to between $110 and $115 million at an interest rate 
slightly more than 7%, depending on the state of the market the day the deal 
goes through. 
</P>
<P>
The new money will go for "necessary expenditures," Alexander said. He said the 
biggest single expense will be the city's $8-million contribution to a proposed 
$50-million face lift for the downtown shopping district. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the money will go for other uses, including a redesign of traffic 
patterns in residential neighborhoods and the completion of several capital 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest capital project is the Civic Center, which is scheduled for 
completion in December or January. The $83-million estimated construction cost 
includes renovation of the 58-year-old City Hall, expansion of the library and 
construction of new police and fire headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason (for the refinancing) is to give us cash flow at the present time, 
which the city sorely needs," said Salter, who was the only member of the 
current council to vote to go ahead with the Civic Center renovation when it 
was approved in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"My contention is, as long as we add debt and do not assume responsibility, 
we'll have the same (deficit spending) that we have at the state and federal 
level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Salter said that the city should look for ways to cut its budget and seek to 
borrow funds that are set aside to develop parks, water supplies and parking 
lots. City staffers said they were not sure how practical or legal that would 
be. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that you guys never had to kite checks to cover a payroll like 
I had to," said Salter, who owns a statewide chain of clothing stores. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to prosecute cases like that," said Councilman Robert K. Tanenbaum, a 
former deputy district attorney in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Like other City Council members who voted for the refinancing, Tanenbaum also 
spoke in favor of seeking budget cuts. But, although he spoke out against going 
into debt to renovate the Civic Center during his 1986 election campaign, he 
said that refinancing now is "the only way to go." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going out to 30 years and spreading it (the debt) thinner, and all the 
people who committed us to it . . . will have to live with that," Tanenbaum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Don Oblander, the city's finance director, compared the deal to homeowners 
refinancing their mortgage to take advantage of lower interest rates and using 
some of their equity to pay for a renovation. 
</P>
<P>
City officials pride themselves on balancing their budgets and returning a 
surplus in the past 10 years, but Oblander said the demands for cash now 
threaten a deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"It must be understood that there is a serious and immediate cash shortfall in 
the city's capital accounts," he said in a report to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"Capital spending is running at a pace where it can scarcely be slowed. A 
deficit, tentatively estimated at $23 million, will occur if funding is not 
provided." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that a delay in taking advantage of a similar form of financing in 
1987 may have cost the city several million dollars when interest rates bounced 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"Although circumstances are significantly changed since then, the same risk 
does exist," he said.

WINNERS OF SPELLING BEE ARE LETTER-PERFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUZ VILLARREAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nina Throngwongsa and Thomas Majich, both 7, stood together on a raised stage 
in the middle of the crowded mall. The moment of truth had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The two youngsters had defeated 35 other first- and second-grade students from 
13 San Gabriel Valley elementary schools and now faced each other as finalists 
in the sixth annual Plaza Pasadena Spelling Bee. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first night of the three-day competition sponsored by Encyclopedia 
Britannica USA and Plaza Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight marks the last evening of the spelling bee, with fifth- and sixth-grade 
students competing for first- and second-place awards. Third- and 
fourth-graders competed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The word that brought Nina, a second-year spelling bee veteran, to the brink of 
victory was nightgown. After Thomas stumbled on the word, Nina gave the correct 
spelling and moved on to another trial. 
</P>
<P>
And then, Nina, a second-grader at Saint Felicitas and Perpetua School in San 
Marino, spelled snowflakes in a steady voice despite her outwardly nervous 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a plaid dress, white blouse and blue tennis shoes, Nina smiled shyly 
as she received her trophy, certificate and encyclopedia book set worth about 
$124. 
</P>
<P>
"She's the best speller in our class," said Stacy Randolph, one of the many 
schoolmates who encircled Nina as she walked off the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Nina placed third in the event. "It's fun. I'll be in it again next 
year," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who participated for the first time, wasn't quite so nonchalant. 
</P>
<P>
"The words kept getting harder," said Thomas, a student at Assumption of the 
Blessed Virgin Mary School in Pasadena. Coming so close to victory the first 
time out ensured one thing, though. "I know I'll be back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The competition "is real family oriented and very competitive," said Teresa 
McGowen, Plaza Pasadena marketing director. It is one of many sponsored 
throughout the year by by the encyclopedia company. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was fantastic," said Thomas' grandmother, Eva Majich. "I'm very 
proud. His mom was in school tonight. She'll be proud, too." 
</P>
<P>
For 7-year-old Stacy, the bee was a family affair. She and her younger brother 
participated on Tuesday evening and her older brother competed with the third- 
and fourth-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy, who participated last year, made sure she prepared for Tuesday's event 
by studying with her first-grade brother, Scotty. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun," she said. "People are here from my school trying it out." 
</P>
<P>
After being eliminated in her sixth round, Stacy smiled, put her hand to her 
chest and said, "I'm still nervous. My heart is beating fast. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just trying to do my best," she said. "I'll be back next year." 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Randolph, Stacy's mother, called the bee good exposure for the children. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives them confidence to at least try and make an effort," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Another competitor, Stephanie Choy of Pasadena, said: "It's kind of scary. I've 
never been on stage before. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun going on stage but not coming down. I don't like spelling words in 
front of everybody," said the second-grade Cambridge School student. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Subia Sr., father of Robert Subia Jr., said the spelling bee will keep 
his boy from becoming shy. 
</P>
<P>
"We encouraged him to participate," he said. "This will give him confidence in 
his learning ability and in speaking out in front of an audience." 
</P>
<P>
Almost 40 students participated Tuesday and more than 80 people attended the 
competition. McGowen said she expects over 200 students, from schools 
throughout the San Gabriel Valley, to participate in this year's event.

Photo, An Official Hand Helps the Holiday -- Tuesday, those observing the 
Jewish holiday of Sukkot gathered in the parking lot behind the West Wilshire 
Recreation Center on Gardner Street to take advantage of a secular favor: City 
workers who trimmed palm fronds as part of their routine maintenance of street 
trees made them available. (The fronds, known as s'chach, are used to roof the 
sukkah, a temporary hut built in remembrance of the ancient Hebrews' rough 
quarters after the Exodus.) Rachel Adler, after finding her husband had taken 
the car, arrived with a sign and quickly found two boys to get the job done.

EARLIER LETTER 'MADE ME LAUGH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The statement, "Politics for the sake of politics should take a back seat to 
the welfare of the people of Monterey Park" by (activist and former Councilman) 
Irv Gilman, in a recent letter to the L.A. Times (Oct. 5), made me laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Irv Gilman is one of our city's "good old boys" and a political godfather who 
seems to control the way council member Betty Couch and Mayor Pat Reichenberger 
vote to spend our money. 
</P>
<P>
I have known Irv Gilman as a "smoke-filled back room" political deal maker for 
over four years. 
</P>
<P>
He has always put politics before the welfare of the people of Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he castigates council members Hatch and Houseman for their "no" vote on a 
water rate increase and increased building in our city as no more than 
irresponsible "inflammatory rhetoric" for the sake of "scoring a few political 
points." 
</P>
<P>
While he's probably right, I would like to remind the reader that it was his 
political machine that installed these two politicians in office almost four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
I also think that Mayor Pat Reichenberger, who voted for this water rate 
increase, should be investigated to see if a conflict of interest exists. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
She is married to San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District Board of 
Directors Member Joseph Reichenberger. It is his board that will benefit from 
the increased taxes. 
</P>
<P>
He works as a vice president for Engineering Science, a Pasadena firm that 
advises business and government entities on the planning and design of water 
supply and water treatment facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Do they do business with Monterey Park? I don't know, but I do know that in 
Southern California, political power is traditionally tied to land with a 
supply of water, and money. 
</P>
<P>
Gilman (who was once a council member himself, but couldn't get reelected) rode 
the issue of slow growth -- as if he were whipping a dying horse to get him 
into battle before it died on him -- in order to get his people into power. 
</P>
<P>
Now that he has political control again, he has abandoned the slow-growth issue 
in favor of using tax money to help the developers. 
</P>
<P>
Politics for the sake of money or politics should take a back seat to the 
interests of the people of Monterey Park, but it won't, as long as political 
godfathers like Gilman and his puppets control how our taxes are spent.

PART-TIME SHERIFF'S OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department will increase its presence in 
Topanga by assigning two deputies to a part-time office there by Nov. 1, 
sheriff's officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned by what they say has been an influx of transient day laborers in the 
Santa Monica Mountains above Malibu, residents in recent months have renewed a 
request for an increased law-enforcement presence in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. Bill McSweeney said two deputies assigned to patrol the area from 
the Malibu Sheriff's Station will use the new office, in a shopping center near 
Topanga's post office, primarily as a place to write reports. He emphasized 
that the facility "will not be a regular sheriff's office, per se, with regular 
hours, at least not for the time being." 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the shopping center donated the space; the Topanga Town Council is 
paying to install a telephone, and a local resident even volunteered to make a 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
"We're excited about it and think it will help with the transient problem, and 
contribute generally to better law enforcement," said Barry Glaser, president 
of the Town Council.

PANEL TO WOO DEVELOPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A City Council subcommittee has been created to explore whether Century 
American developers, who in August turned to the county for approval of a 
119-home development in an unincorporated island north of Via Verde, can be 
persuaded to resume discussions with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Maria Tortorelli and Councilman Sandy McHenry were named to the 
subcommittee last week, when the council voted unanimously to go on record 
opposing the project, which is being processed by the county. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Hobbs, president of Century American, an Orange-based development firm, 
told the council he abandoned the city's review process after at least 16 
months of discussion with a city review panel only because he was uncertain of 
support from the council. He said the company would like a joint city-county 
project.

BOUQUET FOR LONGTIME POLICE CHIEF, LEAVING MONTEREY PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Capt. Joseph Santoro, (who was named Monrovia police chief, Times, Oct. 7), you 
may not have been the political choice, but you certainly were the people's 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
That's evident by your dedication and over 1,000 signatures presented to the 
City Council (they represent the people, so they claim). 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately you can't take that to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
But, Capt. Santoro, you can walk proud knowing the people of Monterey Park 
respect, trust and love you. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park's loss is Monrovia's win. 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the residents whom you have served so well for 22 years we thank 
you. Good luck, Chief.

COUNCIL CUTS UTILITY TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council by a 4-1 vote has approved an ordinance that will cut the 
city's utility tax by 1% a year until the rate is lowered to 5%. 
</P>
<P>
The first 1% reduction will occur in January, lowering the tax on telephone 
service to 10% and cutting the tax on bills for gas, water and electricity to 
9% for residents and 11% for commercial and industrial users. It affects all 
utility billings in the city; a customer whose monthly bills total $100, for 
example, would save $1 with each reduction. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Donna Smith voted against the decrease, saying that although the tax cut 
will be popular, the council should consider the financial impact on the city 
budget first. Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant said he is confident other 
increases in revenue will offset the tax cut. Councilman Tomas Ursua said the 
city should look more closely at spending. "What we're talking about is a 
no-growth policy for city government," he said.

<P>
METER PLAN ADVANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan to install 607 parking meters along major streets in the city's business 
area was tentatively approved by the Culver City Council on Monday pending 
public hearings on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The meters, planned for commercial and retail areas of Washington, Sepulveda, 
Culver, Venice, National and Robertson boulevards and Washington Place, are 
intended to raise money for the city and increase available parking for local 
businesses by making it easier to enforce one- and two-hour limits, according

</P>
<P>
If the meters are installed, the city can expect to earn about $220,000 from 
the meters and violations fines, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 1 to approve the plan. Councilman Jim Boulgarides, who 
favored an alternative plan that would install almost 1,400 meters, voted 
against the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Public hearings on the parking meter plan have not yet been scheduled.

Residents will again be able to use the city's Dial-a-Ride program for free 
this Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-cent one-way fare for the program, under which residents can call for 
door-to-door van service to locations around the city, was waived last December 
to encourage ridership during the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
The free service proved so popular that the City Council decided Tuesday to 
offer it again this year. The fee waiver is allowed under Los Angeles County

MAR VISTA GARDENS GIVEN $2 MILLION BY HUD; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: THE 601-UNIT PROJECT IS ONE OF SIX IN LOS ANGELES RECEIVING FEDERAL 
FUNDS TO MODERNIZE THEIR AGING FACILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As part of a major effort to modernize the city's aging housing projects, Mar 
Vista Gardens has been awarded about $2 million in federal funds to remodel 
kitchens and bathrooms, replace old electrical and plumbing fixtures, give each 
unit a fresh coat of paint and build a community center. 
</P>
<P>
Mar Vista, a 601-unit project that is home to more than 2,500 people, is one of 
eight Los Angeles housing projects sharing in a $14.5-million grant from the 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to refurbish low-income 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Mar Vista received the grant to complete renovations that were begun with an 
earlier $6-million grant. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to modernize the 35-year-old apartment complex for low-income 
families has not been easy. The contractor hired under the original grant was 
terminated this year for failing to complete the remodeling, leaving some 
apartments without linoleum floors and with exposed pipes. A new contractor 
will have to be hired. 
</P>
<P>
Work to complete remodeling should begin within the next month and be completed 
sometime next year, Housing Authority officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had some difficulty completing the work because a contractor wasn't 
performing in a timely manner, so we had to terminate the contract and ask that 
the work be completed under a bond," said Joseph Gelletich, assistant executive 
director of the Housing Authority. 
</P>
<P>
The delay has caused some concern among tenants, many of whom have been living 
for a year with their apartments in a half-completed state. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing modern about this work, it's primitive," said Odell Hadley, a 
longtime Mar Vista Gardens resident who has been active in the community. "The 
work has been shoddy, this is poor work. They don't care what kind of material 
they put in here." 
</P>
<P>
There was a black tar substance on the floor in Hadley's kitchen where the 
linoleum had been ripped up for replacement more than a year ago. "You can't 
walk on the floor in your bare feet, and if you wear socks, you'll never get 
them clean," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hadley also complained that some of the plates protecting the light switches 
were broken and that the cabinets installed in the kitchen were made of cheap 
plywood. 
</P>
<P>
Faustin Gonzales, who directs the Housing Authority's modernization effort, 
said Dalton Construction Co. of Compton was unable to complete its contract 
because of financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The contractor completed about 70% of the work and left the rest in random 
stages of development," he said. Dalton Construction could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales said the Housing Authority became aware of the company's financial 
difficulties as work on the project slowed to a trickle, vendors were 
complaining about not being paid for supplies and employees were not receiving 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
James Loving, project coordinator, said the contract was terminated at a point 
when it was felt tenants would suffer the least. 
</P>
<P>
"None of the tenants were left where they would suffer major inconvenience," 
Loving said. "Most of the units are substantially complete and the units are 
functional. We made sure that no units got demolished. Mostly everything was in 
finished stage and going through the cosmetic changes." 
</P>
<P>
In the future, he said, contract schedules will be monitored more closely and 
the Housing Authority plans to act sooner if contractors fail to live up to 
their obligations. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to fix-up projects, the Housing Authority plans to spend nearly 
$500,000 on the construction of a community center where the city's Community 
Development Department plans to provide job training and counseling services 
for children "at risk." 
</P>
<P>
"Within the center we plan to have all the services required by these children 
to help them put their lives together," Gonzales said. "It will be a 
partnership between the residents, the Housing Authority and the city's 
Community Development Department."

PICK OF THE WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Vista Docents hold free tours of the historic Vista Del Arroyo Hotel, now 
headquarters for the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, at 10 a.m. on the third 
Friday of the month. Tours of the hotel, 125 S. Grand Ave., Pasadena, last an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel was taken over by the Army during World War II and was later used for 
government offices. By 1978, it was in such disrepair that it was closed. 
</P>
<P>
When it was reopened as headquarters for the court in February, 1986, a group 
of lawyers' and judges' wives organized as the Vista Docents to conduct the 
tours. Renovation, which has cost $10 million, is continuing.

ANGLERS LOAD UP AS ALBACORE, TUNA ACTION CONTINUES TO COME CLOSER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dan Stanton 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anglers are loading their sacks as the terrific run of albacore and tuna is 
within a one-and two-day reach of South Bay sportfishers. 
</P>
<P>
The big outbreak of albacore started last month, prompting local sportfishers 
to schedule three-to-five day trips. 
</P>
<P>
Now the big bite is just 90 miles out and has surpassed last year's catch 
counts. 
</P>
<P>
The El Dorado from Long Beach Sportfishing found solid action south of San 
Clemente Island. Capt. Cookie Cook said he made 30 jig stops on the two-day run 
and anglers caught tuna up to 60-plus pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, 72, who has been on many tuna trips in the past 40 years, noted that he 
hadn't seen the abundance of tuna like this for many years. 
</P>
<P>
Every stop resulted in consistent hookups. The only puzzle he can't solve is 
the albacore average of only eight pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Yellow fin and blue fin tuna mixed with the albacore are heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
Leroy Januwc of San Pedro was a jackpot winner with his 65-pound yellow fin 
tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Villaionoz of Redondo Beach decked a 53-pound yellow fin tuna. John 
Meinich, also of Redondo Beach, decked a blue fin tuna weighing 44 pounds. The 
total catch was 200 albacore, 106 blue fin tuna and 72 yellow fin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Manhattan Beach angler Ted Mancki, fishing in the second annual Oceans Shootout 
in San Diego, took grand angler honors fishing aboard the Apollo with a 
110-pound bigeye tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Drulias of Rancho Palos Verdes just returned from Cabo San Lucas with a 
255-pound blue marlin. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Fleming of Wilmington, trolling aboard the Ghetto Queen for marlin at 
Avalon, had a marlin jumper hit his mackerel. It escaped as a school of sharks 
attacked the bait. Pulling his trolling line, Fleming brought aboard a 77 
1/4-pound mako shark. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabrillo Beach launch ramp has been closed until spring, 1990. Work is 
starting on new floats and dredging of sand that has built up at the ramp. 
</P>
<P>
An alternate ramp for South Bay small boat anglers is the Redondo Beach ramp 
site. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Jeff Kaye of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard the Freedom on 
a two-day tuna trip, caught the whopper of the week with his 100-pound bigeye 
tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Rico Curtis of Gardena, fishing aboard the Pacifica, won the jackpot with his 
28 1/2-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Perez of West Los Angeles won the jackpot fishing aboard the City of 
Redondo at Rocky Point with his 25-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports: Local action continues for bass and bonito. Some big bonito going 
up to eight pounds are being caught on half-day boats. 
</P>
<P>

barracuda and two halibut.

rock cod, one lingcod and one cow cod. 
</P>
<P>

200 bonito, 112 calico bass, eight barracuda and one lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
The City of Redondo on two half-day trips returned with 342 bonito, 105 bass 
and seven rockfish. 
</P>

bonito, 73 bass, 43 rockfish and two sheepshead. 
</P>
<P>

landing 2,120 plus 242 bonito and 45 assorted rockfish.

ART RAFFLE WILL BE HELD TO AID DAMAGED CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Original works by local artists will be raffled Saturday at an afternoon buffet 
to help the Westside Arts Center recover from a $75,000 fire and to provide 
programs for children. 
</P>
<P>
The event called "A Collector's Afternoon" will feature 21 prints completed 
especially for the center. The works are valued at a total of $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
A fire last August destroyed musical instruments, video equipment and art 
supplies at the Westside center, a nonprofit group that offers art programs for 
families. According to the event's sponsor, Diana Attias, the center also needs 
help to continue to offer its services. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a waiting list of schools wanting our low-cost art programs," she 
said. "Because of government cutbacks, many of the schools are currently unable 
to offer arts education for children. Increased community support will allow us 
to bring excellent art programs back into the schools." 
</P>
<P>
The prints are on exhibit at Michael's Restaurant, 1147 W. 3rd St., and will be 
raffled at the restaurant between 2 and 5 p.m. Raffle tickets are $10 each or 
15 tickets for $100. Lunch and 15 tickets are $125. For details, call Carlyn 
Clark, (213) 453-3966.

LAWN BOWLING LEGEND TO COMPETE

<P>
Neil McInnes rolled the draw, curved the yard then unleashed the drive. 
</P>
<P>
Having demonstrated, with ease and accuracy, the three basic shots that have 
made him an American legend in his sport, McInnes turned toward an onlooker at 
the Pasadena Lawn Bowling Club and grinned. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a mental game, it's all up here," said McInnes, pointing to his 
head. "If you can't handle it in your head, then you've got problems." 
</P>
<P>
McInnes has presented opponents with dilemmas on the greens since 1971, when he 
won the first of his 11 U.S. (American citizens only) and National (open) lawn 
bowling titles in singles, pairs and triples competitions. 
</P>
<P>
Next Monday, the 61-year-old Glendale resident is expected to contend for his 
first major title in five years when he takes part in the U.S. Championships in 
Roxbury Park, Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I rely a lot more on experience than anything else," says McInnes, who was 
born in Scotland and came to the United States in 1964. "I keep telling these 
young guys I'm not dead yet." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the 6-foot, 170 pound, McInnes is a live wire in an otherwise sedate 
sport in which most recreational players are senior citizens and top 
competitors are in their 40s and 50s. 
</P>
<P>
Employing the concentration of an archer, the patience of a hunter and the 
tenacity of a boxer, McInnes is wont to laugh and joyously shout as he stalks 
younger opponents on the green. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to say he's overtly aggressive," says 30-year-old Lloyd Kennedy of 
Santa Ana, who teamed with McInnes to win the doubles competition at the 
Southwest Open last spring. "His presence on the green is sometimes enough to 
really throw opponents off. 
</P>
<P>
"He's pretty cunning. He knows what to say to certain people to really rattle 
them." 
</P>
<P>
To the casual observer, lawn bowling appears anything but unsettling. 
</P>
<P>
The game, which dates to the time of Julius Caesar, is played on a 120-foot 
square green that can accommodate eight rinks. Ideally, the grass is a dried, 
greenish-brown color that gives the surface the consistency of a pool table's 
felt. 
</P>
<P>
Each player has four matching bowls, which can be as small as 4 3/4 inches in 
diameter and as large as 5 1/8. The bowls, manufactured in Australia, England 
and Scotland, are made of hard plastic and are weighted off-center to make them 
curve when rolled. 
</P>
<P>
Points are awarded for bunching the most bowls nearest the jack, a small white 
ball that serves as a target. Players, therefore, must become skilled at 
knocking an opponents' bowl away from the target since points are scored for 
each bowl inside an opponent's nearest bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Games are generally to 18 or 21 points and disputes are settled by tape 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
McInnes, who works as a carpenter, hones his skills by practicing four to five 
times a week. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be too mechanical or too stiff," McInnes says. "A lot of bowlers are 
very mechanical instead of letting the body flow. 
</P>
<P>
"You also have to be able to handle pressure. A lot of people are good bowlers, 
but they fold like a house of cards when they get into real competition." 
</P>
<P>
McInnes was 29 when he was introduced to competitive lawn bowling in Australia 
in 1958. He spent three years in Australia before returning to his native 
Scotland. He came to the U.S. in 1964 intent on earning enough money to return 
to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
McInnes, however, remained in California, obtained U.S. citizenship in 1969 and 
began his ascent to the top of the national lawn bowling scene. 
</P>
<P>
The sport has allowed McInnes to compete in such places as Australia, New 
Zealand, England and South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the best things about lawn bowling is the comradeship with the other 
players," McInnes said. "It's a sport where you form lifetime friendships with 
people from all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
If McInnes does well this weekend, he will almost assuredly be selected to the 
eight-man team that will represent the U.S. in the World Bowls, a quadrennial 
event that will be held next year in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many of the sport's observers who believe that the World Bowls will be 
his last hurrah, McInnes thinks some of his best lawn bowling days lay ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was young I could bowl all day and I could go dancing at night," 
McInnes says. "I can't do that anymore. I've got to pace myself. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'll be competitive as long as my legs last -- as long as I can bend and 
get that right knee down and so I don't dump the ball like the old people. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you can't get down, forget it."

JIM MURRAY: THEY FIND BETTER WAY BY THE BAY

<P>
Hey! Put away the flowers! Hold the blindfolds! Stop talking in hushed 
whispers! 
</P>
<P>
You might have lost your heart in San Francisco, but it hasn't lost its. 
</P>
<P>
The city that the late Doc Kearns would call a "good game town" is getting off 
the floor one more time. It is reaching for the bottom rope to pull itself up 
for one more go. The city by the bay is like a grizzled old club fighter who 
keeps getting to his feet and carrying the fight to his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
As knockdowns go, this one was a nine-count, too, but not nearly the wallop 
that the city took in 1906. The magnitude of that one was 100 times harder. 
</P>
<P>
It's small consolation to those who lost loved ones or homes or limbs, but this 
one was not the Big One. That is yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball was reluctant to resume its revels in the midst of the human misery 
that was the Bay Area this week. An event caked in human blood is scarcely the 
appropriate backdrop for hits, runs, errors and the sacrifice bunt -- how can 
you hook up lights for a mere ballgame in a city where some areas will be 
without power for 16 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The first notion was to move the classic as far from the devastation as 
possible. Any direction would do. 
</P>
<P>
But a good game town deserves a good game commissioner. "Carmen" was announced, 
"Carmen" will be sung -- as the notice on the opera house on the occasion of 
the original earthquake in nought-six. 
</P>
<P>
The World Series will be played in its original venue, the Giants' home park, 
in that historical edifice, which last seen was swaying in the air like a fat 
lady doing a hula. 
</P>
<P>
It's going to be like the boy pilot in "Lafayette Escadrille" going right back 
up to duel the Red Baron. 
</P>
<P>
The city that won't quit, the Comeback Kid of American municipalities, is going 
to put the gloves back on. No towel comes floating over the ring ropes from San 
Francisco's corner. 
</P>
<P>
The realities of the earthquake of naught-six were dearly learned. This time, 
the city did not fall down in total ruin. The death toll, in fact, was almost 
exclusively restricted to a section of the bridge, and a one-mile stretch of a 
double-decked freeway. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases the top section collapsed on the lower like the devil's 
compactor. Which would seem to suggest that two-level engineering is 
inadvisable on any geography traversed by the San Andreas Fault. But apart from 
the catastrophe of split-level engineering, something less than 20 people were 
lost to ordinary structural failure. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake of 1989 was tragic but not cataclysmic. As an engineer at City 
Hall was to note, "I do not need to minimize but, coming into the city, you 
would be hard put to find the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
It seemed to be the notion of the rest of the world these past 48 hours, 
judging by incoming calls, that San Francisco was a former city, a municipal 
relic disappearing under martial law and a toppling skyline desperately holding 
on to keep from sliding into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
It has been rocked $2-billion worth, its mayor acknowledged, but that's only 
money. 
</P>
<P>
It is not about to see its first World Series in 27 years, and only its second 
in history, go by default to some other lesser city that has never had to climb 
back into a ring in its life. San Francisco is a resilient city. It doesn't 
quit in its corner. 
</P>
<P>
The unpredictability of earthquakes is a major annoyance and source of 
embarrassment to American science. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists can chart a hurricane, a flood, or even a tornado. They cannot chart 
an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Earthquakes are diabolical. They come in their own good time. They come in your 
sleep. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake had seemed to rob San Francisco's Giants of their last real hope 
for parity in this World Series. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants had hoped to wheel their real cleanup hitter into place -- 
Candlestick Park. Candlestick Park wins more games for them than Will Clark and 
Kevin Mitchell put together. It is the most valuable Giant since Willie Mays. 
</P>
<P>
The team is 56-28 in games played at the 'Stick. It is their 30-game pitcher, 
their .400 hitter, their stopper, their ace in the hole. For the rest of the 
league it is Dracula's castle, a scream in the night, a place where the 
portrait's eyes seem to move and where fly balls disappear in the dreaded winds 
with its banshee howl. 
</P>
<P>
It was supposed that Candlestick was as out of commission as the city in which 
it's in. 
</P>
<P>
Not so. They both make their comeback next Tuesday. Open your Golden Gate. The 
city of the 49ers' (the miners, not the football team), is not through yet.

SURVIVORS TOO SHAKEN FOR BASEBALL

<P>
The home of the World Series-leading Oakland Athletics was pretty and peaceful 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Three groundskeepers at Oakland Coliseum were watering and mowing the lush 
green field. Frank Loza was limping where a large chest fell on his leg during 
Tuesday's earthquake, but he was feeling better already. 
</P>
<P>
"Normal day, here." Loza said. "Like nothing ever happened." 
</P>
<P>
Six miles north on Interstate 880, a 10-minute drive in normal traffic, it was 
a different story. 
</P>
<P>
Reginald Walker stood within a block of the Cypress Avenue exit, where Tuesday 
at 5:05 p.m., two miles of the freeway's upper level had collapsed upon the 
lower level. It had created the earthquake's most devastating scene, a concrete 
sandwich that killed what officials believe could be as many as 250 people. 
</P>
<P>
As Walker spoke, most of the bodies remained trapped, including perhaps an aunt 
he had spent 10 hours searching for. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody around here was saying, 'Where are the A's going to play now?' and I 
said, 'The hell with the A's,' " Walker said. "Who cares about A's when you 
still have people up there? 
</P>
<P>
"Who cares about the A's when you can still smell death? Just smell how close 
it is. You smell it? I can." 
</P>
<P>
The home of the San Francisco Giants was quiet and stately Wednesday. There 
were wrappers and bags swirling through Candlestick Park's parking lot, but its 
structure remained unmoved, unmarked, and structural engineer John Clinton 
climbed into his van with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
"What we saw today looks fine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Three blocks up the hill, in the Bayview neighborhood, most of the aging wooden 
houses remained solid, but their owner's memories still shook. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the problems from this earthquake are going to be the aftereffects," 
said Ruth Callan, who was so upset Wednesday she drove her car into the side of 
her front-yard retaining wall while trying to pull into the driveway. "All of 
us are scared. We're all nervous. I mean, I have never, in all my years, even 
come close to hitting that wall." 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the World Series, she interrupted the question with: "I'm glad 
they aren't talking about bringing that World Series right back here. I think 
it has to give us time to heal. We all need time." 
</P>
<P>
The playing sites are in good shape. The surrounding sights are not. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland's Coliseum was in working order as soon as four hours after the quake. 
Visiting clubhouse attendant Steve Vucinich rushed from Candlestick Park after 
hearing that the Coliseum scoreboard had collapsed, only to find the place just 
as he had left it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was amazing," Vucinich said Wednesday outside his clubhouse. "When I got 
back we had power, phones, everything. We could play a game here tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
He paused. 
</P>
<P>
"But I wouldn't want to do that. Would you want to play a World Series with all 
those crushed bodies just six miles up the road?" 
</P>
<P>
That was the question they were asking at the site of the pancaked freeway. 
About 100 people from the surrounding neighborhood stood and stared at the 
disaster, transfixed by what looked like two giant jaws, clamped together with 
debris hanging from their teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Reynolds, who owns an automotive service shop one block from the 
freeway, said he saw the incident while hanging for his life from a telephone 
pole. He said the most incredible sound was, there was no sound. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hanging from the bottom of the pole yelling, 'Holy God, what are you 
doing?!' " Reynolds recalled. "I see the expressway wriggle one way, then the 
other way, and then -- poof -- down it came. 
</P>
<P>
"And not a sound. Just a cloud of dust. Nobody's voice. Nothing crashing. I 
knew then, hardly any of those people made it alive." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said he was so frightened, he climbed the telephone pole to see if the 
Bay Bridge was still there. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew if I didn't see the two spires of the bridge, then the world had come 
to an end," he said. "Thank God they were there. I shouted to everybody, 'The 
Bridge is still standing!' " 
</P>
<P>
Now that he's back to earth, Reynolds says the difficult part is just 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an avid A's fan, but I'll be damned if I can get into it now," he said. 
"People are dead and not buried. Every day I've got to come to work and look at 
that awful highway. We love baseball, but we're human beings, man." 
</P>
<P>
Other local businessmen felt the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty amazing that of all the people that are still up there, dead," 
said Spike Cryderman, owner of a poster company one block from the highway. 
"I'd like for the World Series to start again, it's good for the community . . 
. but you've got to let people bury their dead." 
</P>
<P>
Said Greg Robinson, owner of a local hot dog stand: "What we're thinking is 
that it could have been any of us on that road. That takes time to go away." 
</P>
<P>
Across the bay -- a difficult trip from Oakland Wednesday during sporadic 
bridge closings -- there was serenity at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing wrong or unusual here," guard Gary Sourifman said. 
</P>
<P>
Clinton, an owner of an architecture and structural engineering firm contracted 
by the city to inspect the stadium said that because the stadium was 
refurbished in 1982, he was not jittery about it even as Tuesday's earthquake 
struck. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wasn't worried then, and I'm not worried now," he said. "We just did 
a walk-down (tour) of the stadium, and it looks good." 
</P>
<P>
He was asked, if everything is safe, what about those chunks of concrete that 
fans were carrying away Tuesday night? 
</P>
<P>
"Cosmetic concrete," he said. "Happens all the time with concrete buildings. It 
has nothing to do with the structure." 
</P>
<P>
A few blocks away, a few didn't want to have anything to do with Candlestick, 
or anything outside their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Jasvire Singe, an ice cream vendor, said his wife did not even want him to 
leave the house Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"As I was leaving my house, she screamed at me, 'Don't go, I feel another 
tremor,' " he said. "I told her, 'I must go, We must go on.' 
</P>
<P>
"It will be slow, but we must go on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CANDLESTICK PARK 
</P>
<P>
About 30 minutes before Tuesday's Game 3 of the World Series, an earthquake of 
a magnitude 6.9, rocked the almost full San Francisco stadium. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earthquake damage: Section 53 of the upper stand in right field separated by 
about six inches; several cracks ran down the concrete aisle. People were hit 
by falling debris, no one was injured seriously.

BASEBALL: SAYING BOTH CANDLESTICK PARK AND OAKLAND COLISEUM WERE NOT 
EXTENSIVELY DAMAGED BY EARTHQUAKE, COMMISSIONER SETS TENTATIVE DATE FOR GAME 3.

<P>
The room was packed with hundreds of reporters and illuminated only by candles. 
</P>
<P>
With electricity still out in the downtown area Wednesday, the somber setting 
seemed appropriate in the aftermath of the 6.9 magnitude earthquake that 
brought death and destruction to Northern California Tuesday and prompted 
postponement of Game 3 of the World Series at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of the Bay Area's sense of grief and priorities, yet hopeful that 
baseball can eventually help the healing process, Commissioner Fay Vincent said 
Wednesday that the World Series will not resume before Tuesday in Candlestick 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
"It has become very clear to everyone in major league baseball that our issue 
is very modest compared to the disaster that has hit this community," Vincent 
said as TV floodlights lifted the darkened hotel room out of the eerie shadows. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent sat in front of a bank of microphones after a daylong series of 
meetings and said there was never serious thought given to canceling or moving 
the Series to another location. 
</P>
<P>
"To cancel the World Series was a major step we were not prepared to do," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are decent and alternative steps we can take. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not play baseball during the first stages of recovery and (as) the 
search for victims goes on. We feel it's far better to wait and play at a more 
appropriate time." 
</P>
<P>
Said Oakland Athletic General Manager Sandy Alderson, who sat in on the 
decision process: 
</P>
<P>
"Once the community returns to a sense of normalcy I think it will expect to 
see the World Series and would be disappointed if it didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we all feel it can be part of the healing process, but only at the 
appropriate time." 
</P>
<P>
If the Series resumes Tuesday, there will have been nine days between games and 
a week since the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent stressed that the plan to resume play Tuesday is not a certainty, "but 
I do believe it's a reasonable hypothesis." 
</P>
<P>
He said that certain cleanup and repair work is expected to be done at 
Candlestick Park by Tuesday and that he is hopeful the city and police will be 
able to free up the required security force by then. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said that city and police authorities advised him Wednesday that if he 
attempted to play before Tuesday they could not delegate the amount of security 
and traffic personnel that a crowd of 63,000 requires. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand completely why baseball shouldn't get a higher calling and 
priority," said Vincent, adding that he hopes to have a definitive word by 
Friday on the police and stadium situations. 
</P>
<P>
He announced that a significant contribution to the area's earthquake relief 
fund will be made by major league baseball, both the Giants and A's, ABC TV, 
and the Major League Players Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's meetings were attended by representatives of all those groups, as 
well as: 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Brown and Bill White, the American and National league presidents; 
Candlestick Park and Oakland Coliseum officials, and representatives of the 
city and police. 
</P>
<P>
ABC, despite its large financial investment, apparently had little input in the 
final decision, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos may have, however. 
</P>
<P>
He is said to have urged Vincent to keep the Series in the Bay Area as a 
demonstration that life goes on, an alternative to the bleak news and long 
recovery ahead. 
</P>
<P>
There were rumors Wednesday that if the Series resumed in the Bay Area it would 
return to the Oakland Coliseum, the site of Games 1 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum was inspected by architects and structural engineers Wednesday and 
found to have undergone virtually no damage in the earthquake, Alderson said, 
except for a crack under a ramp connecting it to a Bay Area Rapid Transit 
station. 
</P>
<P>
However, any thought given to using Oakland for the remaining games was removed 
when Candlestick received almost a similar bill of health from the two 
architects and 17 structural engineers who inspected it Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some other areas we want to explore to ensure safety," John Lind, 
the stadium manager for the city's Department of Parks and Recreation said, 
"but there was no major damage." 
</P>
<P>
Opened in 1960 and refurbished in 1982, Candlestick was shaken violently by the 
earthquake, forcing postponement of Game 3 with a crowd of about 63,000 on 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Many left holding souvenir pieces of concrete that had fallen from the upper 
decks, but Lind said there were no serious cracks, that the fallen concrete was 
cosmetic covering for the expansion joints that expand and retract in an 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"It's designed to break away," he said of the concrete, "and that's what it 
did. The stadium responded just the way it was designed to. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a construction company on site repairing wind baffles at the top 
of the stadium, and they'll do the cleanup and repair work brought on by the 
earthquake. I would expect it to be done by Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants are expected to work out at Candlestick today. The A's will work out 
at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Does Alderson think some will be leery and have trouble readjusting? 
</P>
<P>
"I think they were upset, like everyone else," Alderson said. "But like the 
community as a whole, they'll return to normal. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was perfectly happy with the commissioner's decision." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the plan to play Game 3 Tuesday night at Candlestick, Games 4 
and 5 (if needed) would be played there Wednesday and Thursday, with Games 6 
and 7 (if needed) in Oakland Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The A's, who lead the best-of-seven series, two games to none, would almost 
certainly start Dave Stewart and Mike Moore, the winning pitchers in Games 1 
and 2, in Games 3 and 4, meaning there is the unique possibility they could 
close out the Series having employed just the two starters.

GAULT SO DEEP HE HAS DISAPPEARED; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS: RECEIVER WAS SUPPOSED TO BRING BACK THE TEAM'S FAMED LONG PASSING 
GAME. BUT HE HAS COME UP A BIT SHORT.

Anyone seen Willie Gault? 
</P>
<P>
About 6-1, 180? World-class speed, movie-star looks? No. 83 in your Raider 
program, and almost that far down on the pass reception list? 
</P>
<P>
He was supposed to be a prime threat for the Chicago Bears, who drafted him No. 
1 out of Tennessee, but that never quite happened. 
</P>
<P>
He was supposed to be a prime threat for the Raiders, who traded Nos. 1 and 3 
picks for him, but that didn't happen with Mike Shanahan as coach. 
</P>
<P>
He was really supposed to be a prime threat under new Coach Art Shell, whose 
tenure began amid veritable chants of "We're going deep to Willie Gault." 
</P>
<P>
And it still hasn't happened. 
</P>
<P>
In Shell's two games, Gault has caught three passes for 47 yards, and it's not 
because he can't beat defensive backs, either. Every week, there he goes, 
zipping past them, running free. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the bittersweet saga of Willie Gault, who has gone so deep, no one 
can find him. 
</P>
<P>
What has happened recently is no mystery. Opposing defensive backs have backed 
up into the next county to prevent the long strike. Not everyone is so 
cowardly, however. The Raiders are headed for Philadelphia, where the macho 
Buddy Ryan blitzes, plays man-to-man defense and dares you to beat him. 
</P>
<P>
Gault's Raider career is 18 games old and he has 25 receptions. For a 
$750,000-a-year gamebreaker, that's a little light. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't get tied up into feeling selfish as far as the team goes," Gault 
said Wednesday. "I think my role on this team is more than catching footballs, 
but unfortunately that's what I'm looked at as. I want to catch the ball, but I 
think my role has been -- I'm blocking a lot the last few weeks. I've opened it 
up for Mervyn Fernandez, who had a great span of five weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, his role is to wind up his motor and catch footballs deep. The 
mastermind who made the Bear trade was Al Davis, who has doted on few Raiders 
in recent seasons as he does on "Will." 
</P>
<P>
Davis didn't go to all this trouble for a decoy, so if they're having a little 
trouble making contact with their man way out there, stay tuned. They're still 
looking for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been so close but so far all year," Gault said. "I've had guys beat by 
four-five yards. Sometimes the ball was overthrown, sometimes the ball was 
underthrown. Last Monday night, I had the touchdown basically, but the ball 
soared out of bounds, and I went too far to get it and I had one foot in and 
one foot out." 
</P>
<P>
One foot in and one foot out. . . . indeed. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, he also danced with the civic ballet, went out for the Winter 
Olympics and came to be regarded as an opportunist. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Gault, and he'll say he wasn't following any pack. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, controversial might be the word for it, but it wouldn't be the word I'd 
use," Gault said. "I think I'm intelligent. I have something to say. I'm not a 
person that's a follower. I'm a leader. There might have been some uproar 
because I didn't go with the flow. When someone told me to jump, I didn't say, 
'How high?' I said, 'Why do you want me to jump?' " 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, produced strains in his relationships with two men. 
</P>
<P>
One was Coach Mike Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our times, but Mike and I got along fine," Gault said. "When he had his 
heart attack last year, I called him. I sent him cards." 
</P>
<P>
The other was Jim McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon once accused him of saving it up for national TV and noted, "He's on 
his way to Hollywood, or so he hopes. He's just stopping off in Chicago and 
playing his role as a football player." 
</P>
<P>
Gault and McMahon had problems going back to 1983, Gault's rookie season. He 
says he and the punky quarterback worked things out but admits to a shorter 
correspondence with McMahon than with Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at all those things he said," Gault said. "People are going to be 
people. No one's perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't do any more than anyone else. You look on TV, and Jim McMahon had 
every commercial available. So did William Perry, so did Walter (Payton), so 
did Dan Hampton, so did Mike Ditka. Why was what I was doing so outrageous? I 
was out for myself? I didn't see any of the guys doing the commercials 
splitting it with the guys. I thought that was just the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't really bother me, what anybody said. I don't have an identity 
problem. I know who I am, I know where I come from, I know how to get back 
there. I'm a fighter. I give it 150%. I want to be the best football player I 
can be and I want to help the Raiders win a championship." 
</P>
<P>
Where is he going? 
</P>
<P>
He is taking acting lessons in the off-season and does hope to crash show biz. 
</P>
<P>
Where is he going? 
</P>
<P>
Straight down the sideline, and it's not just to open up the underneath routes. 
This role as a deep threat is getting old; Will needs the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Coach Art Shell said strong safety Russell Carter, the starter last season, 
will be reactivated, and Derrick Crudup will be waived once more. . . . The 
Raider bid for cornerback Tim McKyer of the San Francisco 49ers ended up short. 
"We tried and just didn't get it done," Shell said. With Terry McDaniel and 
Lionel Washington playing well and the mouthy McKyer on the 49ers' suspended 
list, Raider owner Al Davis was probably loath to give up the No. 2 pick that 
San Francisco was asking.

NEWSWIRE: OFFICIAL SUSPENDED: SLOW RESPONSE ON FUMBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Football League has suspended, at least through this weekend, the 
instant-replay official whose failure to act quickly on Jerry Rice's fumble 
Oct. 8 gave San Francisco an unwarranted touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Gaylord Bryan made what the league called a "procedural error" in not 
determining whether to study the play "in a timely fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Pete Rozelle will review Bryan's situation and decide whether any 
further action should be taken. Bill Barron, the communicator in the booth 
responsible for contact with the field officials, was not disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
"They miss calls every day," said Eddie DeBartolo Jr., the 49ers' owner. 
"Everybody's entitled to a mistake. If everybody's perfect, it wouldn't be any 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
Bryan was in the replay booth when Rice appeared to fumble at the New Orleans 
one-yard line. The 49er receiver appeared ready to spike the ball, which fell 
out of his hand and went out of the end zone. According to NFL rules, the ball 
should have been awarded to the Saints at the point of the fumble. Before Bryan 
called for a review, however, the 49ers kicked the extra point, and Bryan and 
Barron let the touchdown stand.

The NCAA Council will recommend year-round drug testing for college athletes 
and stiffer penalties for those who test positive, especially for such banned 
substances as steroids. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA Council, which includes 22 representatives from the NCAA's Division I 
schools and 11 each from Divisions II and III, ended three days of closed-door 
meetings Wednesday. The meetings set the agenda of proposals it will sponsor at 
the full NCAA convention at Dallas Jan. 7-10. 
</P>
<P>
NCAA President Albert Witte, a law professor at the University of Arkansas, 
said the council unanimously endorsed the concept of a year-round drug testing 
program, although no details of the plan or how it would be implemented have 
been formulated. The NCAA now tests only before its championship events and 
football bowl games, but many schools conduct in-season testing for athletes.

Primo Nebiolo, who was ousted as president of the Italian track and field 
federation amid a business scandal, was reelected president of the Assn. of 
Summer Olympic Federations. 
</P>
<P>
Several delegates said a key factor in Nebiolo's unopposed reelection was 
adoption of new rules that will prevent future presidents from serving more 
than one four-year term and provide for a membership change on the governing

General Manager Tom Flores and owner Ken Behring of the Seattle Seahawks have 
been served with subpoenas in connection with the California murder charge 
against former team official Mike Blatt. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of surprised (about the subpoena) because of the fact that the only 
time I ever talked to him (Blatt) was for about a two-hour period way back in 
February," said Flores, who was interviewed by investigators about two months 
ago during training camp.

Behring couldn't be reached for comment.

UNION: EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR DONALD FEHR SUPPORTS VINCENT'S DECISION TO RESUME THE 
WORLD SERIES.

<P>
Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent's decision to resume the World Series next 
Tuesday at Candlestick Park drew the support of the Major League Baseball 
Players Assn., which is noteworthy in that no World Series can be played 
without players. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly seems like the thing to do," said Donald Fehr, executive director 
of the players association. "Nobody wants to pull (the World Series) down 
unless it's absolutely necessary. Once the appropriate research was done and 
the appropriate evaluations made, this is the most logical course to take." 
</P>
<P>
Fehr sat in on Vincent's final meeting before Wednesday's announcement was 
made, discussing options with officials from the San Francisco Giants, Oakland 
Athletics and both leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Fehr apparently did little more in the meeting than nod in approval of the 
commissioner's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a situation where people are going to have a lot of different 
opinions," Fehr said. "The lead was going to taken by the commissioner's 
office. We didn't play a role, if that's your choice of words. 
</P>
<P>
"It's appropriate, at this stage, to make every effort to cooperate with the 
commissioner. . . . Given the circumstances, I think this result absolutely 
compels itself." 
</P>
<P>
At no time during the meeting was the subject of moving the World Series out of 
the Bay Area broached, according to Fehr. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are circumstances you don't want to consider unless there are no other 
alternatives," he said. "We're far from there yet. 
</P>
<P>
"After listening to a series of reporters, it appears we'll be able to finish 
it here -- hopefully, beginning on Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
But should it be finished here? The damage and loss of life caused by Tuesday's 
earthquake has been staggering, but Fehr said he believes the World Series 
deserves to go on, saying baseball can serve as a salve to the stricken Bay 
Area community. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody wants to see how fast we can recover," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, with winning player shares expected to exceed $90,000 a man should a 
complete best-of-seven series be played, there are more considerations here. 
</P>
<P>
Fehr said he had only "indirect" contact with the Oakland and San Francisco 
player representatives, Carney Lansford of the A's and Brett Butler of the 
Giants, partly because of the limited phone access within the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
"It was harder to talk to people locally than it usually is by long distance," 
Fehr said. "(But) my office was in contact with both player representatives." 
</P>
<P>
And their input? 
</P>
<P>
"They essentially had the same questions we all had," Fehr said. "They wanted 
to make sure it would be safe and appropriate to play again by next Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
Fehr also said the players' association, in accordance with the A's and Giants 
and ABC television, is planning to make a donation to aid in the relief of the 
Bay Area, although he declined to mention a specific figure. 
</P>
<P>
The A's and Giants are both expected to resume workouts today, preparing for a 
third World Series game that will be held nine days after the second. 
</P>
<P>
Fehr was asked about the interest level in such a game -- for both players and 
fans -- considering the events that have transpired in the interim. "I would 
think it will be high," he replied. "People here want to return to normalcy as 
soon as we can."

IT WAS A DAY, AND NIGHT, TO REMEMBER

<P>
We all take the normal comforts of life for granted. Even the slightest 
inconveniences are irritating. 
</P>
<P>
When you arrive at a hotel, you expect the room to be ready and everything in 
order. 
</P>
<P>
But after Tuesday's earthquake, Bay Area travelers were lucky if they had a 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Forget amenities. There were no bellmen service, no room service, no maid 
service -- no elevators or lights, either. 
</P>
<P>
I flew to San Francisco Monday to do a story on the Bay Area media's handling 
of the World Series and also write a couple of columns on the television 
coverage of Games 3 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
I was in an ABC trailer watching the start of the Series telecast when the 
quake hit, and like other sportswriters at Candlestick Park, suddenly became a 
news reporter. 
</P>
<P>
I went into the stands on the lower level to talk to fans, who, for the most 
part, seemed fairly calm about it all. 
</P>
<P>
I then went back outside toward to ABC trailers to see if any of the telephones 
inside that working. 
</P>
<P>
But on the way I spotted a worker climbing down from one of the 100-foot high 
light pools that surround the stadium and had swayed tremendously during the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
I ran over to where the workman, who identified himself as Benjamin Young of 
San Francisco, was descending. 
</P>
<P>
He was ashen write. "I've never been so scared in my life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Young, who works for a stage hand's union, volunteered to go up and unhook a 
decorative wind sock that caught in the lights. He reached the catwalk at the 
top just as the quake it. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to my knees and hung on for dear life," he said. "I thought I was dead. 
I was so scared I (was sick)." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the phones in the ABC trailers weren't working, but I was found one 
that was. I phoned in Young's quotes and some others to Elliott Almond on the 
sports desk for The Times' early edition. 
</P>
<P>
Later, inside a pitch-black trailer, I wrote a story for the later editions as 
a young volunteer, Alyssa Dubin of Piedmont, Calif., held her father's 
flashlight so I could see to type on my battery-operating portable computer. 
</P>
<P>
By the time I finished dictating and was ready to leave, it was about 10 p.m. 
and the traffic jam at Candlestick had subsided. Getting back to my hotel, the 
Hyatt Regency in Burlingame south the San Francisco Airport, was no problem. 
</P>
<P>
I noticed as I drove down 101 that the off-ramps to the airport were blocked by 
police barricades. 
</P>
<P>
As I approached my hotel, I was stopped by another police barricade. The hotel 
across the street from the Hyatt Regency, the Amfac, suffered major damage in 
the quake -- an entire wall came down -- and the street was closed. 
</P>
<P>
I parked on the street and walked, stopping to ask a policeman about injuries. 
He said, luckily, only about a dozen people were hurt and none seriously. 
</P>
<P>
At my hotel, people were lying on blankets on the front lawn and in the lobby. 
Explaining I had just arrived, a couple of the patrons told me they were 
waiting for word on whether they would be allowed to return to their rooms or 
not. 
</P>
<P>
There was no electricity, except for what the hotel's generators produced. And 
there was some visible structural damage -- cracked concrete pillars and a huge 
hole in one of the stairwells being the most obvious. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel set up four telephone lines for guests to call families and friends 
-- at the hotel's expense. I waited in line, and called home for the first time 
about 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel also set up tables with complimentary food and soft drinks. All that 
was left by the time I got to it was packaged chips. 
</P>
<P>
Back outside, where most of the patrons were milling about, they all had their 
own stories to tell about where they were when the quake hit, and the stories 
varied as greatly as the reactions. 
</P>
<P>
Some were terribly frightened by the quake, others seemed to take it in strike. 
</P>
<P>
Celia Maddox of Apple Valley, who was at the hotel for a convention of church 
youth leaders, said she was in a meeting room when the quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
"Five of us, four men and myself, immediately ran out a doorway," she said. "I 
was looking right at the Amfac Hotel when the wall collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"I screamed. It was so scary. I'm still terrified. I'm a Christian and 
Christians aren't supposed to be afraid of death, but we're all human beings 
and have human emotions. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I did was pray for the people in that hotel. I thought surely 
there were a number of deaths." 
</P>
<P>
As I was talking to Celia Maddox, a news photographer from the Palo Alto Times, 
there to get photos of people camped out on the front lawn, took our picture 
and took down our names. Apparently, even reporters makes news during a major 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after midnight, most of the Hyatt Regency patrons were allowed to 
return to their rooms via stairways, a long, slow process. 
</P>
<P>
Not all rooms were deemed safe, but most were. Guests staying in rooms presumed 
safe were told they could stay in them if they wished, or they could get their 
luggage and additional bedding -- hotel employees earlier passed out blankets 
and pillows -- and return to the lobby or front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
A good number chose the front lawn. It helped that it was an unusually warm 
night. Most chose to stay in their rooms, even though there were no lights. 
</P>
<P>
However, the hotel generator supplied some lighting in the hallways. 
</P>
<P>
After a few restless hours of sleep, I was awakened when the intercom came on 
loudly at 6 a.m. A woman's voice asked all of us to please wake up, pack our 
belonging and leave as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The woman said the hotel would be closing in two hours for inspection. She said 
the hotel would assist anyone who wanted to stay elsewhere. The good news was 
that the area airports were open. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors the night before were that the San Francisco Airport would be closed for 
72 hours or more. 
</P>
<P>
After getting dressed and packing in the dark, I went down to the lobby, where 
there were complimentary rolls and coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Again I stood in line to use the phone. A young man was talking to United 
Airlines, and the man in front me said, "Don't hang up, I want to talk to 
United, too." 
</P>
<P>
And, just like another airline commercial in which serviceman all line up 
outside a pay phone, I said, "I also want to talk to United." 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, I got an 11:30 a.m. flight to Burbank. What would happen later would 
be even more amazing. Quite by accident, and through a stroke of luck, I got on 
an earlier flight. More on that later. 
</P>
<P>
When I got to my rental car, I noticed I had accidentally parked in a "no 
parking" zone, but I guess police were too busy elsewhere to worry about 
parking violations. 
</P>
<P>
I drove to the airport and dropped off the car just like it was an ordinary 
day. But it wasn't an ordinary day inside the United terminal. 
</P>
<P>
A ticket agent by the name of Francie Nash was doing her best to help the 
people in line. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this an unusual day?" she was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're talking about chaos, yes, it's about 120,000 times more chaotic," 
she said. "But we're no busier than normal. It's just that the flight schedules 
are all off. We're just trying to do the best we can." 
</P>
<P>
I stood in line, got my ticket changed to the 11:30 flight and was told to hang 
onto my bag until it got closer to my departure time. It was now only about 
8:45. Things were changing quickly, I was told. 
</P>
<P>
I was not given a gate assignment, so I was just wandering around wasting time. 
There were no newspapers available since the gift shop, somewhat damaged, was 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
I noticed a Burbank sign at one of the gates. I went up to the receptionist and 
asked if this would also be the gate for the 11:30 flight to Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to get on this flight?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, of course," I said. 
</P>
<P>
She grabbed me and we ran down the ramp, my bags in hand, and made it just as 
the door was being closed. "Don't forget to get his ticket," said the 
receptionist. 
</P>
<P>
Things seem to be a lot less formal during times like this. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, incredibly, was only half full. 
</P>
<P>
I was on my way back to Los Angeles a lot sooner than I thought. But not soon 
enough.

Officials of the San Francisco 49ers will meet today with structural engineers 
to determine if their National Football League game Sunday against the New 
England Patriots can be played at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
John McVay, 49er vice president, said Candlestick is the first choice for the 
game Sunday, but Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto is the second choice and a third 
alternative is to switch the game to Sullivan Stadium in Foxboro, Mass., the 
Patriots' home field. 
</P>
<P>
It was announced Wednesday night that an inspection by 17 structural engineers 
and two architects determined that Candlestick did not sustained any major 
structural damage and needs only minor repairs and a cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers already switched a home date this season because of baseball. A game 
with the New Orleans Saints was moved to the Louisiana Superdome because the 
Giants needed the field for the National League playoffs.

SAM WHO SETS A STAKES RECORD IN 4-LENGTH VICTORY AT OAK TREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sam Who sped to a four-length victory over Sunny Blossom on Wednesday in the 
$75,000 Ancient Title Handicap at Santa Anita's Oak Tree meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Who overtook early pacesetter Sunny Blossom in the stretch and ran the rest 
of the distance unchallenged. Don's Irish Melody finished 3 1/2 lengths behind 
Sunny Blossom. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Who, carrying high weight of 120 pounds, ran 1:08 over the six-furlong 
distance to set a stakes record. The previous mark of 1:08 1/5 was set by 
Groovy in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-year-old winner was ridden by Laffit Pincay and earned $46,050 for the 
victory before a crowd of 15,622. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Who, the favorite, returned $4.20, $2.60 and $2.20. Sunny Blossom, ridden 
by Eddie Delahoussaye, paid $2.60 and $2.40. Don's Irish Melody, with Alex 
Solis, paid $2.60.

NHL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
YZERMAN, DETROIT HAND MINNESOTA FIRST DEFEAT, 4-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Yzerman is considered by many as the third-best player in the National 
Hockey League. But the two top players, Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux, get so 
much publicity, the star of the Detroit Red Wings is comparatively unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Yzerman, who led the Red Wings to the title in the Norris Division last season, 
made sure Wednesday night at Detroit that there are no more unbeaten teams in 
the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
Yzerman, who had 65 goals last season, contributed two goals and an assist to 
lead the Red Wings to a 4-3 victory that ended the Minnesota North Stars' 
unbeaten streak at six games. 
</P>
<P>
The North Stars, who opened last season with just one victory in their first 10 
games, fell to 5-1-1, but lead the Norris Division by four points. Last season 
they didn't win their fifth game until they played their 23rd. 
</P>
<P>
Yzerman set up the first goal before the game was five minutes old. He fed 
Gerard Gallant, just back from a five-game suspension, and Detroit led the rest 
of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Both Yzerman goals were in the second period to help the Red Wings build a 4-1 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care where I'm ranked," Yzerman said, "I just want to help win games." 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 2, Calgary 1 -- The Canadiens wish that talented rookie Stephan Lebeau 
had been around last spring for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Lebeau scored early in the final period at Montreal to give the Canadiens the 
victory in the first meeting this season between the Stanley Cup finalists. It 
was just the second loss in eight games for the Stanley Cup champions. 
</P>
<P>
Lebeau has scored four goals while helping the Canadiens post a 5-3-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 9, Pittsburgh 3 -- In their first meeting last season at Pittsburgh, 
the Blues were humiliated. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Lemieux had eight points and led the Penguins to a 9-2 romp. 
</P>
<P>
This was a time for revenge. Brett Hull scored three goals and assisted on two 
others. Linemate Sergio Momesso had two goals and four assists in the one-sided 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
To make the night complete for the Blues, they held Lemieux scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 5, Philadelphia 3 -- Soviet star Viacheslav Fetisov scored his first 
NHL goal in an early outburst at East Rutherford, N.J., to lead the Devils to 
their second victory over the struggling Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
Fetisov's 35-foot blast was the opening score in a three-goal run in 2:01 that 
gave New Jersey a commanding lead. The Devils scored four times on Pete Peeters 
on their first seven shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers, without their No. 1 goalie, Ron Hextall, who is sitting out a 
12-game suspension, are 1-5-1 and in last place in the Patrick Division. They 
lost to the Devils in the season opener at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 4, Vancouver 3 -- The Maple Leafs are willing to take anything they can 
get. They gladly accepted a fluke goal by Ed Olczyk at Toronto to end a 
four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Olczyk, from a poor angle, slid the puck across the ice and it hit goaltender 
Steve Weeks' skate, and caromed into the net to break a 3-3 tie early in the 
last period. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 2, Buffalo 1 -- It was a meeting between two of the best defensive 
teams in the league at Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Whaler goaltender Mike Liut stopped 24 shots to lower his league-leading 
goals-against average to 1.67. He has allowed only five goals in 179 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Sylvain Cote scored out of a goal-mouth scramble with just 3:11 left 
in regulation to give the Whalers the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 7, Winnipeg 2 -- Jari Kurri had two goals and an assist at Edmonton to 
lead the Oilers to an easy victory over the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved the Oilers to within a point of the second-place Kings in the 
Smythe Division and dropped the Jets deeper into the cellar. DAN HAFNER

ROLLING HILLS GETS GIFT FROM TEXAS; 
</P>
<P>
PREPS: TWO WEEKS BEFORE ROLLING HILLS PLAYED ITS FIRST GAME, ROBERT COULTER 
ASKED FOR A TRYOUT. TWO MONTHS LATER, HE'S THE SOUTH BAY'S LEADING RUSHER WITH 
L,102 YARDS IN SIX GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In all his years of coaching high school football, Gary Kimbrell has never 
received a gift quite like the one that arrived at Rolling Hills in August. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Robert Coulter, a junior from Paris, Tex., unexpectedly showed up 
and asked for a tryout two weeks before the Titans' first game. 
</P>
<P>
"We stuck him right in there, on the scout offensive team running against the 
first-team defense," Kimbrell said. "We wanted to find out what kind of talent 
he had." 
</P>
<P>
And? 
</P>
<P>
"No one said much, but we knew." 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrell knew he had found another running back. Two months later, Coulter has 
proved to be that and much more. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-11, 178-pound transfer not only leads Rolling Hills in rushing, but 
the entire South Bay. He has gained 1,102 yards on 119 carries, nearly a first 
down-per-carry average of 9.26 yards, and he has surpassed 100 yards in all but 
one of the Titans' six games. 
</P>
<P>
Coulter enjoyed his finest outing last Friday in a 44-8 Bay League victory over 
Inglewood by rushing for 283 yards on 36 carries, marking the third time in the 
last four games he has gone over the 200-yard mark. He also scored five 
touchdowns to raise his season total to 12. 
</P>
<P>
No longer are teams asking, "Who is that guy?" Now the question is, "How do we 
stop that guy?" 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne, boasting one of the area's top defenses, draws the assignment of 
trying to shut down Coulter and Rolling Hills' explosive option attack at 7:30 
Friday night in a key Bay League game at Hawthorne. The Titans (4-1-1 overall, 
1-1-1 in league play) trail first-place Hawthorne (6-0, 3-0) by a 1 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
So far, teams have had little success slowing down the transplanted Texan, 
whose slashing, cut-back style of running has become his trademark. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Coulter gained 252 yards on 17 carries in a 16-16 tie with 
Leuzinger. The Olympians rarely give up that many total yards in a game. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not a whole lot of guys who get that kind of yardage against us," 
Leuzinger Coach Steve Carnes said. Coulter "ran well. When he's out in the 
open, he's very tough. I was impressed with him." 
</P>
<P>
Coulter didn't think it would be this easy. Although he was a starting wide 
receiver as a sophomore last year for North Lamar High in Paris, Tex., Coulter 
expected the caliber of football to be much higher in California. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured it would be really tough for me to play," he said. "I thought it 
would be the hardest thing in the world." 
</P>
<P>
However, once Coulter demonstrated his determination and began breaking off 
long runs in practice, Kimbrell knew there was a place for his newest player. 
</P>
<P>
"He really has been a tremendous asset to our team," he said. "We knew he was 
talented in our first scrimmage. He proved himself and gained people's respect 
right away." 
</P>
<P>
Although he didn't start, Coulter gained 103 yards on 13 carries and scored two 
touchdowns in the Titans' 35-10 season-opening win over Redondo. The next week 
he gained 171 yards on 18 carries and scored two TDs in a 26-14 win over Mira 
Costa. In the third game, he finally earned a starting spot and responded with 
a 203-yard, two-touchdown effort in a 36-0 win over North Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrell, who coached several All-CIF running backs during a 10-year stint at 
Miraleste, rates Coulter the best in terms of raw ability. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely the most talented back I've coached," he said. "We had some 
good backs (at Miraleste) like Mike Silane, Chris Ridout and Andrew Dunn. But 
Robert definitely is the most talented." 
</P>
<P>
Coulter was set to be the starting quarterback for North Lamar High School when 
his stepfather, Lance Anderson, decided to move his jewelry business and family 
to Southern California this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Moving from rural Texas to the Los Angeles area has taken some getting used to, 
Coulter said. 
</P>
<P>
"In Texas, it's like the country," he said. "There are a lot of cowboys. It's 
really different here. But people are basically the same wherever you go. 
You've got the good ones and the bad ones. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has been going pretty well. People are starting to get to know me. 
At first, I was just by myself. It was tough." 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrell says Coulter has been a model player. 
</P>
<P>
"He's well-liked by everybody," he said. "He's a very hard worker on the 
football field. And it helps to have him in practice. He gives our defense a 
chance to look at someone who can move and run. He gives our defense a little 
preview of some of the quick backs we face in the Bay League." 
</P>
<P>
The week before Rolling Hills met Leuzinger, Coulter played quarterback in 
practice so he could simulate the moves of Olympian quarterback Zac Odom, a 
dangerous runner. It was during one of these practice sessions that starting 
quarterback Bill DeMucci, who was playing running back, suffered a sprained 
ankle. 
</P>
<P>
That forced Kimbrell to put backup tailback Greg Schwartz at quarterback, a 
move that has paid dividends in the Titans' last two games. With Schwartz, the 
team's fastest player, calling signals and Coulter playing tailback, Rolling 
Hills now possesses two breakaway threats. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes us a better football team," said Kimbrell, who intends to keep 
Schwartz at quarterback even though DeMucci has recovered from his injury. 
</P>
<P>
The coach considered Coulter too valuable to move to quarterback, although he 
has proved capable of playing the position in practice. 
</P>
<P>
"To have a good option attack," Kimbrell said, "you have to have someone you 
can pitch the ball to." 
</P>
<P>
Coulter, who can play any of the three positions in Rolling Hills' option 
backfield (quarterback, fullback or tailback), says wherever Kimbrell decides 
to put him is fine. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I'm playing back where the ball is, I'm all right."

MIRA COSTA GIRL SPIKERS ARE NO. 1 AND 'GETTING TO FEEL AND PLAY LIKE IT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
South Torrance High was tied, 2-2, in the second game of a girls volleyball 
match Tuesday against host Mira Costa. 
</P>
<P>
Cheers of encouragement came from the South bench. South was given hope by the 
fact it had taken Mira Costa to a 16-14 game in their first meeting this year. 
</P>
<P>
But the hope was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa's Jennifer Streatfield served for eight consecutive points, 
including three aces, and the Mustangs went on to win the game, 15-4, and the 
match in three games. The other scores were 15-5 and 15-3. 
</P>
<P>
Although South is considered one of the better teams in the Ocean League, the 
Spartans were merely another tuneup for Mira Costa, which improved to 14-0 
overall and 9-0 in league matches. The Mustangs are ranked No. 1 in the 
CIF-Southern Section 5-A Division, No. 1 in the state by Cal-Hi Sports and No. 
1 in the nation by Volleyball Monthly and USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting to feel and play like we're No. 1," Coach Dae Lea Aldrich said. 
"I think we're deserving of the ranking. We've played some awfully tough teams 
and won." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago Mira Costa won the prestigious San Marcos Invitational in Santa 
Barbara, beating Corona Del Mar in the final, 15-11. Corona Del Mar is ranked 
No. 3 in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich said the tournament gave her team valuable experience playing under 
pressure. Teams played each match to one game, instead of the usual best of 
five. The Mustangs defeated Santa Barbara, rated No. 3 in the 5-A Division, in 
the semifinals in an emotional 16-14 game. During one rally, the ball cleared 
the net 22 times before Mira Costa lost a side-out. 
</P>
<P>
That type of competition is essential to Mira Costa, Aldrich said, because the 
Mustangs rarely play close matches in the Ocean League. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to work extra hard in practice," she said. "Our league situation makes 
practice very important for us." 
</P>
<P>
The competition in the Ocean league is not as rigorous as in the Sea View or 
South Coast leagues. Corona Del Mar and Newport Harbor of the Sea View are 
ranked in the 5-A top 10, as are Capistrano Valley and Irvine of the South 
Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
Because Southern Section rules allow a team to play in only two tournaments, 
Mira Costa uses its practices to stay sharp during league play. 
</P>
<P>
"We get our competition from practice," senior setter and captain Piper Hahn 
said. "Our motivation to practice hard is our goal -- to win the CIF and state 
championship." 
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's match, Hahn set 20 kills, accounting for almost half of Mira 
Costa's points. 
</P>
<P>
Middle blocker Kristal Attwood has returned from an injury to a tendon in her 
right ankle. But while Attwood was out for eight matches, junior Jennifer Smith 
filled in ably. 
</P>
<P>
Outside hitter-middle blocker Heidi Eick, who leads the team in kills, added to 
her total Tuesday with 11 against South. Corie Davis and Streatfield lead Mira 
Costa in digs. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa's league season ends Nov. 2 against Redondo. Then the Mustangs get 
down to serious business. The following week they'll open the 5-A playoffs 
where Corona Del Mar and Santa Barbara loom, looking for revenge. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, without a senior, Mira Costa lost in the 5-A finals to Irvine and in 
the state Division I quarterfinals to 4-A champion Gahr. Those losses were the 
only blemishes on a 24-2 season. 
</P>
<P>
This year Mira Costa is looking for perfection.

THE LETTER THAT'S SHAKING HOLLYWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: A MILLION-DOLLAR SCREENWRITER TAKES ON POWERFUL TALENT AGENT MICHAEL 
OVITZ. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, former clients and agents of Creative Artists Agency, considered the 
most powerful talent agency in Hollywood, have privately complained that agency 
president Michael Ovitz and his underlings have threatened to damage the 
careers of those who defect. 
</P>
<P>
Now one of Hollywood's top screenwriters, Joe Eszterhas, has documented his own 
allegations in a four-page letter to Ovitz, a copy of which was obtained by The 
Times this week. 
</P>
<P>
"What you were threatening me with was a twisted new version of the 
old-fashioned blacklist," Eszterhas wrote to Ovitz in the Oct. 3 letter 
detailing comments Ovitz allegedly made in late September after the writer 
announced that he was leaving CAA. "Plain and simple, cutting out all the 
smiles and friendliness, it's blackmail. You are agents. Your role is to help 
and encourage my career and creativity. . . . Your role is not to threaten my 
family's livelihood if I don't do your bidding." 
</P>
<P>
Copies of the letter have circulated throughout Hollywood and created a stir in 
the movie industry. Eszterhas, who can command $1.25 million a script, has 
written such hit films as "Flashdance" and "Jagged Edge." 
</P>
<P>
CAA, which usually goes to great lengths to avoid allowing the public a glimpse 
at internal matters, issued a statement to the press and released copies of a 
letter Ovitz wrote to Eszterhas denying the writer's version of their meeting.

"When I received your letter this morning, I was totally shocked, since my 
recollection of our conversation bore no relationship to your recollection," 
Ovitz wrote to Eszterhas. "I want to make it eminently clear that in no way 
will I . . . or anyone else in this agency, stand in the way of your pursuing 
your career." 
</P>
<P>
Ovitz declined further comment on Eszterhas' charges. But CAA agent Ray 
Kurtzman issued this statement on behalf of the firm: "Joe is a very talented 
writer. He left CAA and had every legal right to do so. At no time has anyone 
at CAA threatened him about his career. There is no lawsuit pending regarding 
his leaving CAA to go to another agency. Assuming Mr. Eszterhas honors his 
commitment to CAA to pay all commissions due, we fully expect there will be no 
lawsuit. " 
</P>
<P>
According to his letter, Eszterhas told the CAA president at their September 
meeting that he was leaving the agency to join his longtime friend and 
colleague Guy McElwaine at rival International Creative Management. 
</P>
<P>
Ovitz, according to Eszterhas' account of the conversation, was furious, 
threatening to sue the screenwriter and implying that he would damage 
Eszterhas' relationships with influential Hollywood figures. As Eszterhas left, 
Ovitz said, according to the screenwriter's letter: "My foot soldiers who go up 
and down Wilshire Boulevard each day will blow your brains out." 
</P>
<P>
The letter again raises questions about CAA's use of power in Hollywood: Are 
alleged threats like these made idly in a fit of fury? Or does CAA actually use 
its influence with major stars and studios to hurt the careers of its enemies, 
particularly those who have left the agency? 
</P>
<P>
"They are very gracious when they want clients to leave," said one former CAA 
insider. "They'll actually orchestrate (dhe departure). But when they want to 
keep someone, they can be very unfriendly." 
</P>
<P>
As reported earlier this year, Ovitz last year fired a friend and colleague of 
two young agents who left CAA to form a competing firm, InterTalent. The CAA 
president also has used his influence to try to stop film projects: His 
attorney threatened to sue the producer of a film he didn't want to see made, 
"Wired," which chronicles the life and drug-overdose death of comedian and 
former CAA client John Belushi. Last spring, a small production company set to 
release "Wired" dropped the film, reportedly because of pressure from CAA. The 
film had a limited release this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry sources argue that because of all the star actors and directors 
on CAA's roster, its agents can hurt the career of someone like Eszterhas by 
making sure their top clients never see his scripts, or by encouraging studios 
to boycott his work. 
</P>
<P>
Others are more skeptical about CAA's ability to influence the career of 
someone of Eszterhas' stature. "The most precious commodity in this town is a 
good script," noted one producer. In fact, Columbia is currently negotiating 
with CAA client Sidney Poitier to direct Eszterhas' new script, "Beat the 
Eagle," about a Cleveland bar owner who takes on the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
Eszterhas could not be reached for comment. But a source close to him recalls 
that the screenwriter was seriously shaken up by his conversation with Ovitz 
and concerned about the impact his defection would have on his career. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Eszterhas wrote that he took Ovitz's alleged threats "very 
seriously indeed. . . . After three years of searching we bought a bigger and 
much more expensive house recently. We have decided, because of your threats 
and the uncertainty they cast on my future, to put the new house up for sale 
and stay in our old one." (In a second letter, Eszterhas -- clearly furious at 
Ovitz's written response to his first letter -- reportedly wrote that he and 
his family would move into the new house after all.) 
</P>
<P>
The screenwriter's first letter describes in detail Eszterhas' version of 
conversations with Ovitz, his principal agent at the firm, and agent Rand 
Holston, who was brought onto the Eszterhas account less than a year ago, after 
CAA agent Rosalie Swedlin and Eszterhas parted ways. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if I win or lose," Ovitz said, according to Eszterhas' Oct. 3 
letter, "but I'm going to tie you up with depositions and court dates so that 
you won't be able to spend any time at your typewriter. . . . I don't care if 
everybody in town knows. I want them to know. I'm not worried about the press. 
All those guys want to write screenplays for Robert Redford." 
</P>
<P>
According to Eszterhas' letter, Ovitz talked in a "friendly, avuncular way" 
while mixing praise with threats. "If somebody came into the building and took 
my Lichtenstein off the wall, I'd go after them. I'm going after you the same 
way. You're one of the agency's biggest assets," the letter quoted Ovitz as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
That same night at Jimmy's restaurant, Eszterhas wrote, Holston told Eszterhas 
that if he left CAA, Ovitz would "put you into the . . . ground." No stars 
would play in his scripts, Holston allegedly said, and no CAA director would 
direct his scripts. 
</P>
<P>
Holston also claimed, wrote Eszterhas, that Ovitz would go out of his way to 
tell studio executives that Eszterhas was difficult to work with. Once studio 
executives knew that Eszterhas was on the agency's bad side, Holston allegedly 
said, they would avoid him "like the plague." 
</P>
<P>
Making Ovitz's threats of litigation more specific, Holston allegedly said that 
United Artists could sue him because his latest script was turned in late, 
leaving him technically in breach of his contract with the studio. 
</P>
<P>
Through CAA agent Kurtzman, Holston declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that he has chosen to live in Marin County, away from the political 
entanglements of Hollywood, Eszterhas wrote on Oct. 3: "Now I felt, as I told 
my wife when I came home to think all this over, like an infant who wakes up in 
his crib with a 1,000-pound gorilla screeching in his face."

MORNING REPORT: 'RAIN MAN' STILL REIGNS 
</P>

"Rain Man" is certainly raining on "Beaches." If it weren't for "Rain Man," 
which continues its reign as the most popular rental on the Billboard chart, 
"Beaches" -- a perennial No. 2 -- probably would have been No. 1 by now. But 
"Beaches" may not reach No. 1 and may be washed out of the Top Five by the new 
wave of hot rentals released in the last two weeks. Two films with Top Five 
potential entered the chart this week: "Major League" (No. 12) -- the baseball 
movie starring Tom Berenger -- and the Michael Keaton comedy "The Dream Team" 
(No. 19). "Lean on Me," starring Morgan Freeman as tough New Jersey high school 
principal Joe Clark, moved up to No. 21 in its second chart week. Look for this 
drama, which grossed a hefty $30 million, to wind up in the Top 10. "The Wizard 
of Oz" is still tops on the sales chart but will soon be replaced by "Bambi" 
(No. 3). 
</P>
<P>
* "Working Girl," the Cinderella tale of a secretary (Melanie Griffith) who 
makes a big splash on Wall Street, is a feel-good romantic comedy, co-starring 
Harrison Ford and Sigourney Weaver, that packed 'em in at the box office 
(gross: a whopping $62.1 million). "Working Girl," which debuted at No. 10, 
just might work its way up to No. 1 in the next few weeks.

ETHERIDGE RINGS RAFTERS AT ROXY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Near the end of "You Used to Love to Dance," the second song Melissa Etheridge 
performed Tuesday at the Roxy, the raspy-voiced singer did a little sha-la-la . 
. . oh-oh-oh thing that was pure Ronnie Spector via Bruce Springsteen. That's 
how big her voice is. 
</P>
<P>
And that's how big the emotions of hurt, loss, anger and longing are in her 
songs. And that's how on Tuesday -- the first show of a five-night stand -- she 
confirmed last year's predictions that she's a bona fide star, in it for the 
long haul. 
</P>
<P>
With her second album, "Brave and Crazy," about to pass the 500,000-sales mark 
after just a month in release, Etheridge and her versatile, power-packed 
three-piece band were opening to a crowd that included many who had been 
following her since she started playing in out-of-the-way Southland bars. As 
those long-timers know, it's on stage where Etheridge is at her best. Now she's 
grown to the point that her stage command and charisma are ready for the big 
halls, but still intimate enough to work in the cozy Roxy. 
</P>
<P>
There's plenty of room for growth. Etheridge's songs still cover a limited 
emotional range, she sometimes relies on cliches and homilies in her lyrics and 
the ballads tend to get overwrought. But her smart and sexy choice of Marvin 
Gaye's "Let's Get It On" to sandwich between the big, how-could-you-betray-me 
closing set of "Similar Features" and "Like I Do" showed that she's thinking in 
the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
The second-billed Subdudes, a New Orleans-originated, Denver-based quartet, 
plays appealing, stripped-down '70s rock, drawing heavily on the Band and the 
Doobie Brothers. But they could use more of the brittle distinction of the 
former and less of the bar-band professionalism of the latter. STEVE HOCHMAN

STAGE WATCH: THEATRE LA AWARDS LOOKING FOR A NAME; PUBLIC INVITED TO FREE TAPER 
LAB REHEARSALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many Los Angeles theater practitioners suffer from Tony envy. 
</P>
<P>
The public perception of New York as the theatrical capital is due, in part, to 
the national attention given the Tony Awards each year. 
</P>
<P>
The latest attempt to honor Los Angeles theater with the same sort of gloss 
that the Tonys apply to Broadway will be Nov. 20, when Theatre LA presents its 
first Governors Awards, at the Pasadena Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Tonys, these won't be competitive awards presented for individual 
achievement during the last year. There are more shows produced in Los Angeles 
than on Broadway, and they're dispersed over a wider area. It would be 
difficult for a panel of judges to see them all. 
</P>
<P>
If Theatre LA were to attempt Tony-like awards, "all of our judges would have 
no life apart from going to the theater," said Franklin Levy, who is producing 
the Governors Awards show. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Governors Awards are modeled after the Kennedy Center Honors. They 
will be presented for lifetime achievement, and the initial 15 recipients were 
announced several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
At the black-tie ceremony, the recipients will receive bronze statuettes 
designed by Robert Graham of "Olympic Gateway" fame. The 13-inch-tall 
statuettes feature "a dark patina finish with gold leaf accents," according to 
a Theatre LA statement. Near the top, on a convex plate, is "a primitive 
representation of the classical tragedy and comedy masks." 
</P>
<P>
No, the statuette doesn't light up, although it does resemble a lamp in 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
The award doesn't yet have a name, like Tony or Oscar or Emmy, said Theatre LA 
executive director Karen Rushfield. "We'd love to get (a name) before the 
ceremony, but we don't want one that's associated with one theater or 
individual." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with bright ideas for a name is welcome to write to Stage Watch. 
</P>
<P>
Levy plans lavish tributes to three of the musically oriented recipients: 
satirical songwriter Billy Barnes, Los Angeles Civic Light Opera founder Edwin 
Lester and musical comedy star Mary Martin. The other recipients -- Marla 
Gibbs, Charlton Heston, Jack Lemmon, Lu Leonard, Dick Lochte, Mako, Luis 
Valdez, Joel Wachs and (in memoriam) John Allison, Gilmor Brown and Henry Fonda 
-- will receive spoken encomiums from a star-studded list of presenters. John 
Larroquette will be the master of ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the creative talent behind the event -- the stars, Levy, director David 
Galligan, sculptor Graham and set designers Dorian Vernacchio and Deborah 
Raymond -- are donating their efforts, and the Pasadena Playhouse is donating 
the space, but the event still has a $75,000 budget. 
</P>
<P>
Expenses include the services of the party planning firm Events Unlimited, 
musicians and dancers, set and award construction, travel expenses for some of 
the presenters and recipients, printing and mailing of invitations and 
publicity, and the champagne reception that will follow the event. Tickets cost 
$30 or $50 for Theatre LA members and $150 or $500 for others. 
</P>
<P>
Information: (213) 614-0556. 
</P>
<P>
TAPER LAB: The public is welcome to attend free rehearsals and readings of the 
19 plays in progress that are part of the Mark Taper Forum's Taper Lab '89 New 
Work Festival, at the 99-seat Taper, Too, Oct. 30-Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Among the writers represented in this year's festival are Paul Linke, Ron 
Hutchinson, John Steppling, Kelly Stuart, George C. Wolfe, Philip Kan Gotanda, 
Murray Mednick and many others. 
</P>
<P>
The most notable product of last year's festival was Bill Cain's "Stand-Up 
Tragedy," which went on to full productions at Taper, Too and the Taper main 
stage and is now moving on to Hartford Stage Company and Arena Stage in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven workshops will be held on Mondays and Tuesdays, beginning with Linke's 
"Further Conversations/Life After Time" on Oct. 30, and eight readings will be 
presented on Wednesdays, beginning Nov. 8 with "Water Play," by Sally Nemeth. 
</P>
<P>
Reservations are necessary: (213) 972-7373. 
</P>
<P>
MORE PLAYS IN PROGRESS: Joseph Scott Kierland's Los Angeles Playwrights Group 
has moved to the Pasadena Playhouse. Previously housed at Los Angeles Actors'

MOST BAY-AREA BASED SERIES WILL GO ON

Although there may be production delays, none of the major TV networks' San 
Francisco-based series sustained serious damage in Tuesday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The cast and crew of CBS' "Wolf" were shooting interior scenes when the set 
began to rumble Tuesday night, sending lights and equipment tumbling onto crew 
members, who suffered cuts and bruises. The production team broke for dinner 
and then tried to resume shooting, but were thwarted by the power outage. 
Production resumed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's San Francisco-based "Midnight Caller" is revamping its production 
schedule, which called for outside scenes to be shot in Oakland this week. 
Executive Producer Bob Singer said the cast and crew were not hurt and that the 
sets were not damaged. But the devasting effects of the earthquake are "going 
to slow us down considerably," he said. "We'll have to get together with the 
network to discuss scheduling." Singer said the next episode scheduled for 
production calls for extensive exterior shooting "so we may have to move on to 
something else. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's upcoming Jacqueline Smith series "Christine Cromwell," which is set in 
San Francisco had finished shooting scenes in the Bay Area last week. A 
production company spokesperson said she did not know when the series, part of 
the "ABC Mystery Movie" would return to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
NBC was scheduled to broadcast the "Nightly News" with Tom Brokaw from San 
Francisco on Wednesday night. "The Today Show's" Jane Pauley and Bryant Gumbel 
will anchor their morning program from San Francisco on Thursday and Friday.

UNIVERSAL SHUTS EARTHQUAKE ATTRACTION FOR TWO DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MATHEWS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visitors to Universal Studios Tour arrived Wednesday morning to find that the 
heavily promoted Earthquake attraction had been canceled because of the real 
quake that struck the Bay Area on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We are closing the attraction for 48 hours out of respect and as a sympathetic 
gesture," said Joan Bullard, vice president of public relations for the tour. 
"We will continue to operate all other attractions as usual." 
</P>
<P>
The last customers on the tour Tuesday had already been through Earthquake when 
the 6.9 temblor struck at 5:04 p.m. The two-minute ride simulates an 8.3 quake 
-- the size of the one that devastated San Francisco in 1906 -- and is 
designed, according to Bullard, as "a generic subway tunnel set in a bay area." 
</P>
<P>
She said that the attraction will resume its regular schedule on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Universal Studios Tour is on the lot of Universal Studios, and the 
Earthquake attraction is a spin-off of Universal's 1974 movie "Earthquake." 
That film, which starred Charlton Heston and Ava Gardner, was set in Los 
Angeles, where a quake unleashes the waters of the Hollywood Reservoir onto a 
city already crumbled and ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
Bullard said that the ride has been immensely popular since it was added to the 
tour on March 18 and credits it with increasing attendance that may push the 
1989 total to a record 5 million. She said that nothing has been done to cancel 
advertising for the attraction but that it is unlikely the TV promo will air 
during the two-day shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
Natural disasters have provided Hollywood with dramatic material from the 
earliest days, but the film community, perhaps because it was situated on the 
San Andreas Fault and didn't want to tempt fate, resisted using earthquakes as 
subject matter for decades. 
</P>
<P>
The first major film with an earthquake theme was the 1936 "San Francisco," an 
extravagant production that used the real 1906 Bay Area temblor as the setting 
for a romantic drama starring Clark Gable, Jeanette MacDonald and Spencer 
Tracy. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake scenes in the 1940 caveman soap opera "One Million B.C.," which 
starred Victor Mature and Carole Landis, were remarkable effects for the time 
and became stock footage for numerous later films. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until special effects matured technologically in the '70s that 
Hollywood got serious about dramatically re-creating earthquakes, and there 
have been some eerie simulations since. Images of the collapsed span of the San 
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge on Tuesday night looked like film clips from the 
1978 feature "Superman." 
</P>
<P>
In that film, perennial Superman nemesis Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) concocted a 
scheme to detonate the San Andreas Fault to trigger an earthquake that would 
split California down the middle and turn Luthor's desert property into ocean 
frontage. Among the devastation that Superman eventually reversed was the 
collapsing of a section of the Golden Gate Bridge. Richard Donner, who directed 
"Superman," said that the images on his TV set Tuesday night looked like 
miniatures -- small-scale models used by film makers -- to him. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really chilling, that (news image) of the car going over the edge" on 
the Bay Bridge, said Donner in a telephone interview Wednesday. "I don't think 
I'll ever make a movie like that again." 
</P>
<P>
Donner, the director of the recent action hit "Lethal Weapon 2," said none of 
the earthquake scenes in "Superman" was based on actual scientific speculation. 
He said he might have chosen the Bay Bridge if that were the case; he used the 
Golden Gate Bridge simply because it was the better visual. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, when the quake hit Tuesday evening, Donner's sister was on a 
plane landing at San Francisco International Airport. Hers was the last plane 
allowed to land before the runways were closed. 
</P>
<P>
Donner said he has become very earthquake conscious in recent years and has an 
"earthquake room" at his Hollywood Hills home where he keeps two months' worth 
of supplies for his family and their pets. 
</P>
<P>
"Last night, when I was out walking the dogs, I opened the room and checked it 
out," he said. "We tend to take it for granted (that we won't get hit that hard 
here)."

NETWORKS TURNED TO AFFILIATES AFTER QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the earthquake struck San Francisco, the major TV networks scrambled to 
air dramatic video of the disaster, relying to an unusual degree on the 
reporting of local stations to get out the first pictures from an area that 
lost phone lines, power and light. 
</P>
<P>
At times during the networks' many hours of coverage, they "cut in" to their 
San Francisco affiliates' local newscasts, giving national viewers an unedited 
look at the San Francisco news. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unusual to cut in to the local newscasts as much as we did," Ted 
Koppel, who anchored nearly five hours of coverage throughout the night for 
ABC, said Wednesday. "We were flying on their power to a large extent." 
</P>
<P>
Power literally was the problem for NBC. While ABC, CBS and CNN were able to 
begin lengthy coverage of the earthquake shortly after the quake hit at 5:04 
p.m. PDT, NBC lagged behind because the network's affiliate, KRON, had lost 
power on its generator and didn't have a backup at hand. 
</P>
<P>
After announcing the quake at 5:31 p.m., NBC went on the air at 5:58 p.m. with 
the first of a series of reports anchored by Mary Alice Williams. The updates, 
which ran several minutes each, continued until 6:43 p.m., when Tom Brokaw 
began continuous coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning reports, we stayed on as long as we could with the 
information and material we could get," said Don Browne, executive news 
director of NBC News. "Your affiliate is your link, and we literally couldn't 
reach them at first because of their technical problems." 
</P>
<P>
Once KRON was able to get video and reporting out to NBC, said Browne, "NBC was 
able to make a strong stretch run." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Cable News Network was able to get footage from KRON before NBC 
did. CNN was able to pick up the local broadcast of KRON, a CNN affiliate, and 
send it via satellite to CNN's headquarters in Atlanta. CNN broadcast video 
from KRON at 6:42 p.m. PDT 
</P>
<P>
NBC confirmed Wednesday that CNN had been able to get on the air with the 
footage sooner. 
</P>
<P>
"CNN did have KRON's material sooner because KRON was beaming up on the 
satellite," said NBC News spokesman Catherine McQuay. "NBC got the signal 
through an uplink through KCRA, the NBC affiliate in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
ABC -- which was beginning its broadcast of the World Series game from San 
Francisco when the earthquake struck -- had the competitive advantage in its 
coverage. Koppel, who went on the air from Washington D.C. at 5:23 p.m. 
following a brief announcement at 5:10 p.m., interviewed ABC sportcaster Al 
Michaels live from Candlestick Park and was able to show aerial shots from the 
Goodyear blimp, in addition to footage throughout the night from KGO-TV, the 
network's San Francisco affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
At CBS, Dan Rather went on the air with a bulletin that the earthquake had hit 
at 5:21 p.m. With pictures from CBS affiliate KPIX, the network began 
continuous coverage at 5:55 p.m.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

Abortion 
</P>
<P>
The House adopted, 216 to 206, an amendment to broaden federal abortion policy 
by permitting Medicaid funding of the medical procedure when the pregnancy 
results from rape or incest. The language was attached to a fiscal 1990 
appropriations bill (HR 2990). Medicaid now covers only those abortions 
necessary to save the mother's life. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.) said, "Congress cannot and must not turn its 
back on the poorest victims of rape and incest who become pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) said: "Rape and incest are tragedies. . . . But 
why visit on the second victim, the unborn child that is the product of (the) 
criminal act, capital punishment?" 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported Medicaid funding of abortion if the pregnancy is 
by reason of rape or incest.

The Flag 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 371 to 43, the House sent to President Bush a bill (HR 2978) 
making it a federal crime to physically damage the American flag. Also due for 
congressional votes this year are proposals backed by conservatives to protect 
the flag by constitutional amendment. The legislative activity is in response 
to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling this year that flag desecration is political 
expression protected by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Don Edwards (D-San Jose), said it is better "to protect the flag by a 
simple statute than to go through the mammoth and dangerous procedure of 
weakening for the first time in our history the free speech provisions of the 
Bill of Rights." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) said, "If you really want to protect the 
flag, if you really want to do something more than make a gesture, then given 
the court's decision you have to support our bipartisan constitutional 
amendment to save the flag." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to protect the flag by statute.

<P>
Still rocking from what probably will be the second deadliest American 
earthquake ever, the Bay Area slowly began Wednesday to dig out its dead and 
repair the damage left in a swath of carnage 100 miles long. 
</P>
<P>
At least 35 people have been confirmed dead, and officials expect the toll to 
reach well over 200 when victims are dug from beneath the collapsed double-deck 
levels of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland. Several hundred people may have been 
crushed under tons of concrete, but it will be days before the bodies can be 
recovered and an actual count taken. 
</P>
<P>
State officials had estimated Wednesday morning that the toll could reach 273 
dead, but later said that it was too early to know for sure. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay Area Rapid Transit District tube beneath San Francisco Bay was briefly 
closed Wednesday night after a BART train operator "reported some water 
seepage," said Kay Springer, manager of passenger services. But the tube was 
reopened without incident after the damage was pronounced minor. 
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, an eight-block area of the well-to-do Marina District near 
Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco was hurriedly evacuated because of fears of 
gas explosions and falling debris from damaged buildings. The area suffered the 
greatest damage in the city, although it was more than 50 miles from the 
earthquake's epicenter near Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
Police barricades were erected at every key intersection, and Red Cross workers 
went door-to-door and down the middle of streets with bullhorns to ask 
residents to leave quickly. Residents who had left to go out to dinner were 
stopped and turned back on their return. 
</P>
<P>
State disaster authorities have counted at least 1,390 injuries from the quake 
in five counties, and scores of buildings have fallen in a swath reaching from 
San Francisco south to Hollister. Thousands of homes suffered damage ranging 
from items knocked off shelves to shattered windows and toppled chimneys. 
Damage could easily mount into the billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
While rescue crews and the California National Guard continued searching for 
survivors and bodies, President Bush on Wednesday signed a disaster-relief 
declaration and said the federal government "will take every step and make 
every effort" to help. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian arrived at the scene of the Nimitz Freeway collapse 
after hurrying back from a trade trip to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said the damage looked worse than he expected. "It is just a 
horrible sight," he said. "It's something that you cannot fully appreciate by 
looking at the television screen. . . . I have to say I am greatly displeased 
and disappointed because I had been under the impression that all of the 
structures that had been built" after earlier earthquakes were seismically 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
Struck at Game Time 
</P>
<P>
The 6.9-magnitude jolt struck Tuesday afternoon at 5:04, just before the start 
of Game 3 of the World Series at Candlestick Park in San Francisco. The entire 
Bay Area had been basking in the glow of national attention for having its two 
baseball teams in the Series. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the whole nation was sharply reminded of the Bay Area's vulnerability 
to quakes. Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent said in a candle-lit press 
conference at the St. Francis Hotel, however, that the San Francisco Giants and 
Oakland Athletics would try to resume play next Tuesday at Candlestick. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Lionel Wilson of Oakland, which was supposed to host two games this 
weekend, said he did not want any games played before then. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that at this time I felt it would be inappropriate to play 
baseball in our city while there are still bodies still resting under the 
concrete of the overpass," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 14 bodies have been retrieved from the debris left when about a mile of 
the upper deck of the Nimitz Freeway -- a portion of Interstate 880 near the 
entrance to the Bay Bridge -- collapsed on rush-hour commuters on the lower 
level. 
</P>
<P>
In some places rescuers were left with a crawl space of only one or two feet 
between the two decks. But in some spots the two decks meet in a tight fit, 
leaving no hope for any motorists caught underneath. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a huge concrete sandwich with people in between," said Alameda 
County Sheriff Charles C. Plummer, who added it could take five days to dig out 
the victims. "It's total devastation." 
</P>
<P>
Kyle Nelson, public information officer with Caltrans, said 150 to 250 vehicles 
-- including some buses -- may lie crushed between the decks. 
</P>
<P>
It may take days to recover all the bodies, officials said. "It's going to be 
real slow, painstakingly slow," said Marty Boyer, spokeswoman for Alameda 
County. "It's very grim out there." 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers shined lights and probed metal rods into the crawl space in the 
darkness Tuesday night, but they moved cautiously. Sections of pavement 
weighing 500 tons were piled at odd angles. 
</P>
<P>
"They are afraid it is going to collapse with the slightest aftershock," said 
Nelson, the Caltrans spokesman. "Sound, movement -- anything could make it go." 
</P>
<P>
Said Craig Kocian, acting city manager of Oakland: "It is possible that if a 
piece of concrete is moved, the rest will come down like dominoes." 
</P>
<P>
Powerful aftershocks as strong as magnitude 4.5 were felt through the day 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The confirmed death toll of 35 is lower than state officials had reported in 
the first frantic hours after the earthquake before sunset on Tuesday. The 
state Office of Emergency Services, which relies on local officials for its 
numbers, also has dropped its widely reported estimate that the death toll 
would reach at least 273. 
</P>
<P>
But the death toll could ultimately climb even higher unless officials are 
wrong about the number of vehicles trapped on the crushed section of freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Potter, a spokesman for the state office, said the agency decided late 
Wednesday to be more conservative. 
</P>
<P>
At least 10 deaths have been confirmed in San Francisco, where thousands of 
residents and suburban commuters stranded by damage to the Bay Bridge and the 
shutdown of Bay Area Rapid Transit trains spent Tuesday night out of doors or 
in hotel lobbies. 
</P>
<P>
Five other deaths have been reported in Santa Cruz County, five in Santa Clara 
County and one in San Mateo County, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation in the Bay Area gradually improved through the day Wednesday, 
thanks in large part to residents who heeded advice to stay at home. What 
traffic there was moved freely. The toll on the San Francisco-bound lanes of 
the Golden Gate Bridge was suspended in the morning to help traffic flow 
smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
But little progress was made on reopening the vital San Francisco-Oakland Bay 
Bridge, closed when 30 feet of the upper roadway snapped and fell onto traffic 
lanes on the lower deck. A decision on whether to reopen the bridge with 
temporary repairs will not be made until an inspection is completed. 
</P>
<P>
A crane en route to the bridge will be used to lift the fallen section of 
pavement so that Caltrans engineers can inspect the bottom span. "What it 
basically boils down to is that they have to pull that section up and look 
under it," said Anita Yoder, a Caltrans spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco International Airport and Oakland Airport reopened Wednesday 
morning. The Golden Gate and Richmond-San Rafael bridges had remained open, but 
the San Mateo Bridge was closed for inspection. The Pacific Stock Exchange in 
San Francisco was open, but volume was light as traders worked by candlelight, 
flashlight and light filtering through skylights. 
</P>
<P>
The San Jose Mercury News and Oakland Tribune published as usual Wednesday. In 
San Francisco, The Chronicle reportedly hit the streets with a scaled-down 
edition at 7 a.m. and an abbreviated edition of the Examiner appeared about 
three hours later. 
</P>
<P>
UC Berkeley opened for classes Wednesday, but other area campuses canceled 
classes for the day. At UC Santa Cruz, about 10 minor injuries were reported, 
including some students hit by falling books in the library. Several thousand 
students camped outdoors Tuesday night until most dormitories were declared 
safe around midnight, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Some San Francisco city schools and Stanford University planned to hold regular 
classes today. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1 million people lost electricity, said a spokesman for Pacific Gas 
&amp; Electric Co., and about 400,000 customers remained without power through 
at least part of Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all of downtown San Francisco's high-rises began the day without 
electricity. "Service is being restored slowly downtown, and the reason is 
apprehension about possible leaking gas in buildings. We have to work building 
to building," PG&amp;E spokesman Chuck Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Most attention throughout the day Wednesday remained riveted on the Nimitz 
Freeway and surrounding sections of Oakland, where crowds gathered to watch the 
search and cleanup efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison Brown, 29, had been driving his express delivery truck south on the 
upper level of the freeway when the quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine you're driving down the freeway at a normal pace and, all of a sudden, 
the road in front of you just drops. The freeway starts rocking and then there 
is no more freeway," he said. "Then all around you these people are screaming 
and hollering." 
</P>
<P>
This stretch of the Nimitz was built between 1955-57 and may have been 
reinforced after the 1971 Sylmar earthquake, the 6.5 magnitude temblor that 
killed 58 people in the northern San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Nimitz would meet today's quake standards, even after the 
reinforcement, Caltrans' Nelson said, "No, it would not meet code today." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley), who came to the scene Wednesday and 
said he was born "just a few blocks from where we are standing," called for a 
state and federal investigation of the freeway failure. 
</P>
<P>
"We are confronted with (questions about) the integrity of the bridge and 
freeway system in the Bay Area," Dellums said. "We have a moral and human 
obligation to return that integrity, whatever the dollar figure. We've got to 
find out what happened to make sure it never happens again." 
</P>
<P>
Oakland School District Police Officer Dave Drury said dispatches on his police 
radio indicated that some people apparently had climbed onto sections of the 
broken freeway after Tuesday's collapse and stole wallets. 
</P>
<P>
"Vultures don't do that. Vultures don't steal wallets," he said with disgust. 
</P>
<P>
Police said there was sporadic looting in downtown Oakland after the quake 
knocked out power to most of the Bay Area, but no arrests were made. Brick 
walls and smokestacks were down on several Oakland streets. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Roberts, Oakland's director of public works, said the walls of City Hall 
West, an auxiliary building across the street from City Hall, had separated and 
the building would not be usable for up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers said Oakland-Alameda County Stadium, where the Athletics play, was 
structurally sound but that the neighboring arena where the Golden State 
Warriors of the NBA play basketball had suffered significant damage inside. 
</P>
<P>
Alameda County officials said that the county courthouse had also suffered 
extensive interior damage and would remain closed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 10 San Francisco deaths, there also were three murders that 
Police Chief Frank Jordan said were not related to the quake. About 209 people 
were treated for injuries, 25 of them critical. 
</P>
<P>
Among the dead were a man and a woman on the second floor of a collapsed 
four-story, 30-unit apartment complex at the corner of Cervantes and Fillmore, 
also in the Marina District. They were heard alive about 7 p.m. Tuesday, buried 
in debris and pleading for help. 
</P>
<P>
"All we could see were their hands sticking out of the rubble," said an 
emergency medical technician at the scene Wednesday. "They were screaming that 
they were suffocating." Firefighters tried to feed them oxygen, but the 
paramedic said: "When I went in at 10 p.m., they were dead." 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters, National Guardsmen and Red Cross workers -- aided by a 
Caterpillar tractor -- finally removed the bodies Wednesday night. "It looked 
like they had interlocked arms beneath a door frame, which is what they were 
supposed to do," said Fire Chief Michael Moran. But the couple apparently 
suffocated. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Dorrance, co-owner of the building, said a third person believed to have 
been residing on a lower floor at the time of the earthquake was also missing. 
</P>
<P>
Dogs were probing the remains of more than a dozen other collapsed and heavily 
damaged buildings in the Marina District for survivors and bodies. "We have 
completed searching through six collapsed buildings as best we could," said 
Fire Department Capt. John Rebholtz. "At least five more buildings will have to 
be razed by heavy equipment." 
</P>
<P>
Searchers were also checking a block of burned-out apartments in the Marina 
District that lit the skies over San Francisco Tuesday night. "There have got 
to be people in there -- unless we got real lucky," said Joseph Surdyka, the 
city's administrative coroner. 
</P>
<P>
The damage in the newer Marina area came as a surprise to city officials, who 
expected to find most problems in the older, rundown Tenderloin section or in 
Chinatown. But streets in the Marina area buckled and many buildings there will 
have to be condemned, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not as big as it could have been, but we have all (the damage) we could 
handle," said Carl B. Koon, head of the city's office of emergency services. 
"Overall, we came out OK." Deputy Fire Chief Michael Farrell said he saw "three 
or four buildings that used to be four stories high and now they are one story 
high." 
</P>
<P>
Presbyterian Church officials said Wednesday that the Seventh Avenue 
Presbyterian Church in San Francisco was "severely damaged." 
</P>
<P>
Teams of inspectors from the city and from Bechtel Co. went building by 
building looking for structural damage through the financial district. 
</P>
<P>
"The high-rises did extremely well," said Nicholas Duchon, a structural 
engineer from Bechtel. However, Duchon and city engineer Jim Buker -- pointing 
to damage to several brick buildings up the block -- noted that older 
structures did not fare so well. 
</P>
<P>
The city was dark through the night Tuesday, allowing thousands of residents 
and stranded workers who spent the hours outside an unusual glimpse of stars. 
Headlights and an occasional building running on emergency generators were the 
only bright lights. Among the landmarks that remained lit were San Francisco 
General Hospital and the glass-front Davies Symphony Hall downtown, but the 
usually well-lit Bay Bridge was dark except for the flashing lights of 
emergency crews. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Art Agnos, tieless and weary, gave periodic briefings throughout the day 
Wednesday. After a tour of the Marina area, Agnos said, "I was dumbstruck by 
the enormity of the earthquake damage. . . . It was very scary, very tragic." 
</P>
<P>
He praised the "heroic performances" of the people of San Francisco, whom he 
credited with aiding their neighbors and acting calmly in the face of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said Wednesday that police made 50 felony 
arrests for looting, burglary and assaults Tuesday night, mainly along Market 
Street, a shopping district where broken windows left merchandise exposed. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Cruz County, the epicenter of the quake, five bodies have been found 
so far, but officials said there could be others. 
</P>
<P>
Two died when buildings collapsed in the Pacific Garden Mall, a pedestrian mall 
in downtown Santa Cruz. One died when a bakery collapsed in Watsonville, 
another in a nursing home and another in a traffic crash following the quake. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 40 buildings collapsed in Santa Cruz and Watsonville, where damage was 
estimated at $350 million, Santa Cruz County emergency services coordinator 
Dinah Phillips said. Hospitals remain open, but California 17, the main link to 
San Jose, was blocked by landslides and fissures. The highway crosses the San 
Andreas Fault near the quake's epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
A wildfire in the area had consumed 650 acres, while 25 buildings had also been 
burned by small fires. Officials were advising residents to boil all water 
because of concerns about broken water and sewer lines. 
</P>
<P>
"People should stay home. They should boil their water. They should clean up 
and prepare for a long haul," said Phillips, public information officer for the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
The small city of Los Gatos, in Santa Clara County, suffered some of the 
heaviest damage in the Bay Area. Pavement was buckled on streets in the center 
of town, natural gas and water lines were ruptured, and several dozen Victorian 
homes were shifted off their foundations. Many chimneys had crumbled and some 
homes had simply collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
On Main Street downtown, brick rubble from building facades was piled three 
feet high in some areas. No one was killed but Los Gatos police reported 214 
people treated for injuries at local hospitals. Forty people stayed at an 
outdoor shelter set up at Los Gatos High School's football field Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Officers stood guard in the downtown area through the night to ward off 
looters. They were joined by wary shopkeepers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just out to keep an eye on things," said Loren Johnson, who family owns a 
building on Main Street. "A lot of people are sleeping outside their buildings 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
'Bad, Really Bad' 
</P>
<P>
A day-care operator in Santa Clara, who had nine children and three parents in 
her home when the quake hit, said she huddled in the door frame with the 
toddlers and infants, who were terrified but remained quiet. 
</P>
<P>
"It was bad, really bad. We really shook," said Celia Moreno, whose husband, 
Armando, survived the Managua earthquake of 1971. 
</P>
<P>
At City Hall, San Jose spokeswoman Callie Gregory said the city had weathered 
the jolt quite well, largely because redevelopment has replaced many of the 
city's old buildings with new ones in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"San Jose got off real easy on this one," Gregory said. "We're just trying to 
help our neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
Five commercial buildings in San Jose suffered "major structural damage," 
including two downtown office buildings and a department store. 
</P>
<P>
Further south in Hollister, a city located along the San Andreas Fault, a 
"couple hundred" homes were damaged and the city was left without water, power 
or telephones, San Benito County clerk John Hodges said. There were 49 minor 
injuries but no deaths. 
</P>
<P>
"San Benito County was real, real fortunate," Hodges said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the entire downtown of Hollister was closed off and buildings carried 
signs warning that they were unsafe for entry until further notice. 
</P>
<P>
"Water is a major problem right now," said County Administrative Officer David 
Edge. 
</P>

based on staff reports from the Bay Area.

TRAUMA: ACROSS OAKLAND AND SAN FRANCISCO, THE DEVASTATION WAS A SHARED 
EXPERIENCE.

<P>
It was just another workday rush-hour for the golden Bay Area, its cultivated 
image polished finer still this Tuesday evening by the national attention of a 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Stewart, a computer designer, bolted from her San Francisco office en 
route to the East Bay, skipping out of town on the lower level of the Nimitz 
Freeway in Oakland. She eased through it just before 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Across San Francisco Bay to the southwest, tens of thousands of desperately 
optimistic San Francisco Giants fans, their distaste for the Oakland Athletics 
almost palpable, streamed into Candlestick Park for the series' third game. 
Festivities reigned in the sun-splashed stadium. 
</P>
<P>
And then the carnage began. 
</P>
<P>
Within seconds of its 5:04 p.m. onset, a devastating earthquake would link the 
rival cities in a clutch of fear and suffering. Few, across the broad expanse 
of the Bay Area, would escape untouched. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison Brown, 29, was driving his delivery truck south on the upper level of 
the Nimitz at 5:04, talking on a two-way radio to a friend in San Jose. The 
friend felt the earthquake first, and spit the news out over the radio. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was joking -- but the next thing I knew . . . the freeway just 
started rustling," Brown said. His truck flipped over. It crushed three cars 
and temporarily pinned their occupants. Around him, cars flew off the freeway 
into midair. 
</P>
<P>
"They went right off the top -- killed," said Oakland Police Lt. Ron Zien. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Kato of Alameda was puttering placidly along the lower level until, 
suddenly, the cars in front of her simply vanished into rubble. "I could see 
people alive and screaming," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Another trucker, George Donovan of Berkeley, was driving his tractor-trailer 
rig on the upper deck of the Nimitz when nature took the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
"The pavement started to move," he said. "I had waves of asphalt come up over 
my windshield . . . it was undulating all around me. It was like a Disney 
ride." 
</P>
<P>
If the horror was not immediately obvious to him, it was to those who live and 
work near the double-decked roadway. The screams of the injured rose alongside 
clouds of dust. 
</P>
<P>
"You could hear it crunching down," said Leroy Fitzgerald, who works at an auto 
parts store near the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"But you couldn't see anything. It was just a big white cloud. You could hear 
people screaming for help." 
</P>
<P>
The pleas of the wounded went unheard at Candlestick Park, where nearly 60,000 
raucous fans had gathered for the start of the series' third game -- Bay's 
Ball, as the contest between the cross-bay rival San Francisco Giants and 
Oakland Athletics had come to be known. 
</P>
<P>
A band played on the outfield grass. Hundreds of balloons were set for release. 
Nervous players milled around near the dugouts. Unwelcome and unsuspected, the 
tremor built. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Tower Swaying 
</P>
<P>
Security guard Mark Dandridge looked up and saw a stadium tower sway. "And then 
I looked down to the luxury boxes and I saw all that starting to shake. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Oh, God help us!' " he cried aloud. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 60,000, a solitary thought stunned Marsha Blanche: "Who'd raise my 
kids?" 
</P>
<P>
Another road, and yet more horror. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Kelly and his wife, Debbie, on vacation from Ringwood, Okla., were 
traveling across the bay on the lower deck of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay 
Bridge when the quake hit. At Treasure Island, part way across the bay, 
Caltrans workers ordered them off the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
But once off, they were ordered to get back on to the upper deck -- and head 
toward Oakland. They had little idea what awaited them. 
</P>
<P>
"We had heard on the radio that a section had actually collapsed, but you 
couldn't see anything like that," said Thomas Kelly. "There were about 100 
cars, all driving along about 50, 60 miles an hour. People were waving us down, 
warning us not to keep going. Others were waving like it was all right. It was 
mass confusion." 
</P>
<P>
Then Kelly spotted the break. Frantic, he turned his camper around and stopped, 
facing the oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a long break between us and the (next) car," he said. "We had the 
video camera with us because we were on vacation, and as I was waving from the 
front, she (Debbie) was filming from the back." 
</P>
<P>
The car zoomed past. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Kelly captured the scene on tape: The car plunged into the chasm and 
then propelled itself back up, catching precariously on the opposite lip. 
Gasoline ran down its side. 
</P>
<P>
"The driver wasn't moving," Thomas Kelly said. "The passenger was pretty aware 
and wanted pretty desperately to get out." 
</P>
<P>
Across the Bay Area, catastrophe reigned. Water gushed from the second floor of 
the city's health department building, just across from City Hall. Windows in 
the I. Magnin department store exploded onto Union Square. In the Marina 
District between Golden Gate Park and San Francisco Bay, a fire raged across a 
city block of apartments. Plumes of smoke likewise rose from San Francisco's 
Embarcadero and from Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
At the grand old Mark Hopkins Hotel, chandeliers swung so violently that they 
touched the ceiling, as if, one guest said, they were pendulums gone berserk. 
Doors slammed open and shut, and the cries of frightened people echoed in the 
halls. 
</P>
<P>
At San Francisco International Airport, windows shattered and ceiling panels 
rained down on air traffic controllers. A computer terminal flew through a 
window and fell nine stories to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
In Sausalito, Zelda Tiffany Low, who as a young child watched San Francisco 
burn after its last great quake, once again watched smoke rise from the city. 
</P>
<P>
Heading toward the East Bay on a surface street just past the Nimitz, Judy 
Stewart did not believe what she was feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"My car started shaking and going crazy and I thought, 'I just got a front-end 
alignment and those (garage) guys must have screwed it up really bad!' " 
</P>
<P>
Heroes proliferated. In Los Gatos, a worker at the Velomeister bicycle shop was 
struck in the head with a brick. Then Bill Lansen, still bleeding, saved a 
young girl's life. He hauled her to safety as she ran before a wall of falling 
bricks. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Cruz, security guard James Campos pulled a woman out of the rubble of 
the historic Pacific Garden Mall. "The dust was like a fog," he said. The 
renovated historic area, replete with gardens and bricked walkways, was 
smashed. Twisted mannequins lay in the street. 
</P>
<P>
Stunned and fearful, people nonetheless rushed to help. At the Nimitz Freeway, 
workers from nearby shops carried tall ladders toward the crumpled concrete, 
dragging burrowing equipment behind them. One man drove a forklift from a 
warehouse through a fence to open the site to volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Darius Brewer, a 26-year-old cook, crawled into the mangled wreckage to search 
for survivors. Using a crowbar, he and some friends pried open one car, and 
used ropes to lower an elderly man 20 feet to safety. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we went to the top of the second deck and just mostly got everyone down 
that we could," Brewer said. "People were yelling, 'I'm hurt! I'm hurt!' " The 
trapped who could not speak honked their horns in futility. 
</P>
<P>
Bodies crushed and bloodied were tugged from the wreckage. Television news 
crews took to the skies overhead, their helicopters sending back to viewing 
audiences the initial glimpses of the destruction. 
</P>
<P>
William McElroy, who lives two blocks from the ruptured freeway, ran to the 
site and crept up a ladder to the lower deck. Inside the pancaked structure, he 
found victims -- silent, stunned, and alive. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't saying anything. They were in shock," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers like Brewer and McElroy crept on their bellies through tons of askew 
concrete, shouting: "Is anyone hurt? Is anyone alive?" Occasionally, a victim 
crawled out. 
</P>
<P>
Enormous steel girders and reinforcing bars wound surreally through the broken 
concrete like giant strands of spaghetti. Officials issued stern warnings that 
the wreckage could collapse at any moment. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking for his brethren, construction worker Dwain Tolbert, 32, snapped his 
response. 
</P>
<P>
"We are volunteering. If we get killed, it's our own thing." 
</P>
<P>
Slow too was the impact sensed at Candlestick. Entire sections of fans, 
fearless or brazen, shouted rhythmically: "Let's play ball! Let's play ball!" 
</P>
<P>
To the north in the Marina District, reality was already intruding. Police 
begged, then ordered, residents milling about to go home. Firefighters, 
hampered by low water pressure, fought blazes with water brought in from San 
Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Power outages darkened the dusk and the smell of escaping gas gagged residents. 
They began gathering outside, the only sure place of safety in an area where 
houses had bounced off their foundations and freeways off their stanchions. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of commuters were stranded in traffic jams. Houses fell and fires 
sparked across the breadth of the Bay Area. Airplane passengers who took off 
from San Jose saw miles and miles of drivers stranded in traffic, their lights 
merging into red and white ribbons. Bricks and plaster showered the financial 
district. One Yuppie, not to be deterred, sauntered through the mess with a 
glass of white wine in her hand. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos hastened to the airwaves. "Be calm!" he implored. 
"Things are in good shape as far as we can tell." But the truth was far from 
that. 
</P>
<P>
On the sundered Bay Bridge, it took "hours and hours" for help to arrive, said 
vacationer Thomas Kelly. The fate of the driver whose car flew off the bridge's 
edge was uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
The Kellys themselves drove back along the upper deck toward San Francisco, 
picking up along the way several stranded reporters who had abandoned their 
cars at the base of the bridge and walked up to survey the scene. 
</P>
<P>
From the vantage point of the bridge, high above the bay, "you could see the 
smoke from the big fire," Thomas Kelly said. "You could see sections of the 
city in darkness. You could see Coast Guard choppers and a blimp come over, 
trying to help people in the water. You could see something massive happened 
over on the highway in Oakland. You could see fire engines." 
</P>
<P>
Something massive had indeed happened. The burrowing volunteers were soon 
replaced by professionals, who found that their training was grossly 
insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
As dusk turned to night, the whine of sirens and the dull thump of helicopters 
filled the ears. A smattering of stars appeared in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
At the Nimitz Freeway, paramedics hastily dispatched the wounded to hospitals 
and the dead to a temporary morgue at Ralph Bunche High School. And amid the 
bravery of the volunteers came a more sinister desire. According to Oakland 
Police Officer Dave Drury, some people apparently climbed into the freeway 
wreckage and stole the wallets of the dead. 
</P>
<P>
"Vultures don't do that," a disgusted Drury said. "Vultures don't steal 
wallets." 
</P>
<P>
On his belly in a 2-foot-high section of the wreckage, Dr. James Betts crawled 
toward a smashed two-door sedan. Betts, the director of trauma services at 
Children's Hospital in Oakland, found two women crushed in the front seat. 
</P>
<P>
From the back seat, an 8-year-old girl had already been extricated. Her 
6-year-old brother remained trapped, his legs pinned in jumbled concrete, his 
torso covered by the body of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
A paramedic sprawled on the hood, and two firefighters carrying the Jaws of 
Life tried to cut the boy out. When they could not, they sedated the boy and 
cut his mother's body away to free the child. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed to do whatever was needed to save the kid's life," said Betts. "We 
had no choice." 
</P>
<P>
But the boy was still trapped. He was freed only when Betts amputated his right 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
By 11 p.m., when exhausted rescuer William McElroy left for home, there was one 
sound that cut through the din of rescue vehicles and the drone of generators 
that lit the night sky. It was the sound of the wounded, still "moaning and 
groaning," McElroy said. 
</P>
<P>
Across the bay, their only light the three-quarter moon that hung mournfully in 
the sky, scores of San Franciscans inexplicably gathered at 950-foot Twin 
Peaks, normally a refuge only for lovers. 
</P>
<P>
As the city lights returned, slowly, section by section, cheers rose from the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
With dawn came a surge of renewal. National Guard troops were activated to help 
out, and volunteers from charitable organizations began streaming into the 
city. At 6 a.m., San Francisco's airport resumed limited operations, and 
California formally requested emergency federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, approving the request, praised the relief workers. The 
government, he said, "will take every step and make every effort" to assist the 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
But in California, Wednesday's dawn also brought a sobering accounting. Shortly 
before daybreak, a hook-and-ladder truck moved alongside the Nimitz, stopping 
periodically to let firefighters shine lights into the crevices. Police dogs 
scoured the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
And more volunteers poured into the site, seeking to help. "We're the guys who 
build these things . . . we know there are people alive in there," said 
carpenter Scott Connor. 
</P>
<P>
If Connor had hope, trauma surgeon Betts had none, not when he confronted the 
father of the little boy named Julio whom he had rescued from the wreckage. He 
told the man about the rescue, about having to cut away the body of the man's 
wife to save his child. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I'm never involved in something like this ever again," the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco as well, search dogs probed the wreckage of flattened 
buildings in the Marina district. Two bodies were found in a collapsed 
four-story, 30-unit apartment complex. They died awaiting aid. 
</P>
<P>
"All we could see were their hands sticking out of the rubble," an emergency 
medical technician at the scene said Wednesday. "They were screaming that they 
were suffocating." 
</P>
<P>
And more were expected to be found. According to the Fire Department, the 
search there will take another three days. Of pressing interest were not only 
the scores of collapsed buildings but also those that burned Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"There have got to be people in there -- unless we got real lucky," said 
administrative coroner Joseph Surdyka. 
</P>
<P>
Many who had no wreckage to clean nor memories to mourn simply left town. The 
Kellys took their videotape to KCBS in San Francisco, which was first to air 
the footage, and then to KGO, the ABC affiliate. They parked their camper in 
the KGO lot overnight, and then, after a short appearance on "Good Morning, 
America," headed for Reno. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's time to cut this part of the vacation short," Thomas Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
For the victims came the inevitable questioning, as they traded tales of 
unfathomable luck and unspeakable horror, of fright and bravery, of heroism and 
hooliganism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Die in His Arms 
</P>
<P>
From Robert Majors, who lives a block from the Nimitz: "Two women died in my 
arms. There was a man who died with all of us watching. There was nothing we 
could do. He was stuck under the concrete. . . . There was nothing we could 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Judy Stewart, who blithely traveled across the lower level of the Nimitz 
Freeway just moments before it tumbled askew, found torment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I had my purse ready to go and I left work on the dot, because I was heading 
to a Stevie Nicks concert," she said. "If I had taken any time getting out of 
the building, talking to my friends, I would have been in that bottom layer 
when the sections fell down and left those cars 6 inches tall. 
</P>
<P>
"I just keep thinking about and thinking about that." 
</P>
<P>
Aftershocks rumbled through the Bay Area on Wednesday, reminding the survivors 
that they could not forget the Earth's tumult, even if they wished. And from 
David Russ of the U.S. Geological Survey came a thought even more chilling for 
those who had salved their jangled nerves with the hope that maybe this was the 
quake that California has awaited. 
</P>
<P>
"No," he said, "this was not the Big One."

DOUBLE-DECK ROAD SAFETY STIRS DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD and WILLIAM TROMBLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seismic experts and California transportation officials were sharply divided 
Wednesday over whether the state possessed the know-how to bolster the Nimitz 
Freeway in Oakland against an earthquake of the magnitude that caused a 
double-decked section of the roadway to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Several seismic engineers argued that studies of structure failure after the 
1971 Sylmar earthquake provided the insight for the state to make necessary 
improvements on older highways like the Nimitz. 
</P>
<P>
"The technology does exist. It's simply a matter of money," said John Kariotis, 
a structural engineer based in South Pasadena who is known around the country 
for his work on seismic safety. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy centers on the multiple columns that supported the freeway and 
which gave way during the earthquake. Kariotis and others contend that older 
freeways like the Nimitz, which was built in the early 1950s, can be 
substantially strengthened by wrapping the vertical columns with extra steel 
and then jacketing them with an extra layer of concrete. 
</P>
<P>
The problem in Oakland was exacerbated by the landfill on which the roadway is 
built, he said. The similar double-decked Embarcadero Freeway on the San 
Francisco side of the bay appeared to have weathered the quake without a 
collapse because it is on more solid ground, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1971 earthquake centered in Sylmar taught the California Department of 
Transportation the need for reinforcing the connections between elevated spans 
of roadway, according to Kariotis. Subsequent quake experience and research 
should have alerted officials to the possible weakness of the columns under 
elevated roads and bridges, he said. Yet the state did not do enough on that, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
But William E. Schaefer, chief engineer for Caltrans, said that wrapping the 
columns was not a technique proven effective on freeways with the column 
configuration of the Nimitz. 
</P>
<P>
"We really don't have the expertise to know what to do to fix these," Schaefer 
said. He added, "We don't have the technical knowledge, nor does it exist 
anywhere in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer said that research is under way at UC San Diego on the best way to 
retrofit an elevated freeway like the portion of the Nimitz that collapsed, but 
it will take at least a year to find a solution. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Schaefer said that the lessons learned from Sylmar were applied to 
the Nimitz. He said that the portion that collapsed had been "retrofitted." But 
he said the work that was done only solved the problem of the kind of lateral 
movement that caused freeway decks to slip off their supports, as they did in 
the 1971 quake. 
</P>
<P>
About $110 million in federal money has been spent in California in the last 15 
years or so as part of a project to seismically strengthen the state's bridges 
and highways, according to David W. Frederickson, a spokesman for the U.S. 
Department of Transportation in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Frederickson said another $64 million has been earmarked for a second phase, 
and that phase will involve wrapping the bases of elevated freeways that are 
supported by single columns, according to Schaefer. He described the Nimitz as 
a multicolumn freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Among a number of structural engineers, the collapse of the Nimitz along with 
partial failure of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and the severe damage 
to buildings in San Francisco's Marina District have aroused more indignation 
than surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no real surprises . . . no new lessons there, not from this 
earthquake, none at all." said Peter Yanev, chairman of EQE Engineering Inc. of 
San Francisco, a large earthquake engineering consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Yanev and others interviewed Wednesday said that state transportation officials 
have known for years that roads and bridges such as the Nimitz Freeway and the 
Bay Bridge built before the 1971 Sylmar quake were not as strong as they should 
be. 
</P>
<P>
"That we have known these things for years and had no concerted push to do 
something is tragic," Yanev said after viewing much of the devastation in the 
Bay Area on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Baron, a retired professor of civil engineering at UC Berkeley, where he 
taught for 29 years, said that the number of studies on structural failure 
after the Sylmar quake gave officials the ability to make necessary repairs on 
older highways and bridges in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"They (state officials) have had sufficient knowledge from the studies to do 
the remedial retrofitting to ensure that severe damage did not occur," Baron 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The lesson that (Sylmar) taught us was very important. We were not giving 
enough strength to the piers (columns) of certain freeways, nor sufficient 
support to the decks," said Vitelmo Bertero, director of the Earthquake 
Engineering Research Center at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Bertero is heading a team of structural engineers assigned to survey damage and 
prepare a report for the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute in El 
Cerrito. 
</P>
<P>
After examining the Nimitz Freeway Wednesday, Bertero said it was clear that 
the piers lacked crucial lateral reinforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"There are probably no new lessons to be learned from this earthquake. It just 
re-emphasizes the old lessons that we haven't paid attention to," Bertero said. 
</P>
<P>
As for San Francisco's Marina District, a well-to-do neighborhood built on soft 
soil, Bertero said: "I have been preaching for a long time against building on 
filled land. If it (the area) is rebuilt, it should be done only on special 
foundations that are very expensive." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Tobin, a spokesman for the California Seismic Safety Commission, said it is 
going to take at least five years to replace the overpass section of the Nimitz 
that collapsed. This will be "a major, major disruption in traffic patterns and 
highway infrastructure. There will be a fairly significant number of lawsuits 
in terms of culpability. I'm not trying to paint it too bleak; I'm taking a 
realistic look at everything. This is another grim reminder of the lessons we 
should have learned from Mexico City and Whittier. This only confirms what 
we've already known." 
</P>
<P>
After surveying the damage in San Francisco, Tobin said, "When I see this, it's 
terribly sad. I stood on a street corner in Armenia during the quake at a 
school site where 600 kids died and all you could have done was cried. I get 
very angry when I see the damage in San Francisco. The government and engineers 
just have not done what needs to be done. What does it have to take? California 
has got to face this earthquake problem." 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the state Transportation Commission in Sacramento on Wednesday, 
Commissioner Stanley W. Hullett predicted the Bay Area's "economy is going to 
come to a standstill" because of the highway problems triggered by the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"It's well known we have no money left in the pot with which to build highways, 
much less fix these highways," Hullett said. "We're going to be in difficult 
straits in order to be able to find the money." 
</P>
<P>
The Nimitz disaster has struck a blow to plans in Los Angeles to double-deck 
much of the area freeway system. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn on Wednesday called for a halt to 
the double-decking now under way on the Harbor Freeway that runs through 
downtown Los Angeles. Assemblyman Richard Katz, a Sylmar Democrat and chairman 
of the Assembly Transportation Committee, said that the Nimitz collapse "raises 
legitimate questions about double-decking of freeways." 
</P>
<P>
However, structural engineer Kariotis stressed that there is nothing inherently 
dangerous with the concept of double-decked roads, like the one proposed over 
portions of the Harbor Freeway, if they are built to new standards. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Larry Gordon in Los Angeles, Doug Frantz and Sam Fulwood 
III in Washington, Ed Iwata in San Francisco and Mark Gladstone in Sacramento

SHUTTLE ALOFT, SENDS GALILEO ON 6-YEAR VOYAGE TO JUPITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The shuttle Atlantis roared into space Wednesday on the first leg of the most 
ambitious planetary mission to date. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo, the most sophisticated unmanned spacecraft ever built, was released 
from the shuttle's cargo bay six hours after the 9:53 a.m. PDT launching and is 
finally on its way to Jupiter. It was a launching that some scientists were 
beginning to think they might never see. 
</P>
<P>
The spectacular liftoff, which had been delayed several times, marked both a 
beginning and an end. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the end of years of frustration for scientists and engineers who 
built the Galileo and then watched it narrowly escape the scrap heap several 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely a special day for them," launch director Robert Sieck said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was worth the wait," said Richard Young of NASA's Ames Research Center in 
Mountain View, Calif., one of the principal scientists on the project. "It was 
fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
Atlantis commander Donald E. Williams, 47, could not have agreed more. "We're 
happy to be here," he said as the shuttle orbited 184 miles above Earth. 
</P>
<P>
And the launching signaled the beginning of what promises to be a spectacular 
journey through space. It will take six years for Galileo to reach Jupiter, the 
largest planet in the solar system; but, along the way, the spacecraft will 
tour the inner solar system and its camera will even offer humans their first 
view of Earth as it would be seen by visitors from outer space. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, NASA officials considered scrapping the $1.4-billion project as 
the space agency struggled to rebuild after the Challenger explosion. 
Scientists who had invested much of their careers in the project held their 
breaths as NASA reevaluated the mission. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo had been designed to be put into low Earth orbit by the shuttle and 
then use a liquid-fueled engine to blast itself on to Jupiter. But, because of 
concerns about safety after the Challenger disaster, NASA decided to prohibit 
liquid fuel in the shuttle's cargo bay, leaving Galileo with a great itinerary 
but no way to travel. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo was saved when engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory came up with 
a way of getting the spacecraft to Jupiter without using liquid fuel. It could 
be done, they concluded, by using a safer solid rocket motor to push Galileo 
beyond Earth's grasp. 
</P>
<P>
The solid rocket is not powerful enough to give Galileo the speed it will need 
to reach the outer solar system, so Galileo will have to take the scenic back 
roads to Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
After Galileo was released from the shuttle's cargo bay, it used its rocket to 
slow itself down as it sped around Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The reduced speed left Galileo falling toward the sun. But, in February, 
Galileo will pass close enough to Venus to use that planet's gravity to change 
its course. Venus will swing Galileo around and throw it back toward Earth. 
</P>
<P>
In December of 1990, Galileo will come within 600 miles of Earth, whipping 
around its home base for the first time and using Earth's gravity to slingshot 
itself through the asteroid belt outside of Earth's orbit. Ten months later, 
Galileo is to pass within about 600 miles of the asteroid Gaspra for the first 
encounter with an asteroid, snapping pictures and studying this remnant of the 
early solar system. 
</P>
<P>
In December of 1992, Galileo will make a daringly close approach to Earth, 
passing within about 185 miles and using the planet's gravity to boost its 
speed by 8,000 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, that should give Galileo the speed it will need to reach 
Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second encounter with Earth that most worries anti-nuclear 
protesters, who tried to block the launching. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo carries about 48 pounds of toxic plutonium 238, which it uses to 
generate electricity to run its many instruments. The protesters, who had also 
feared a launching disaster, worry that, if Galileo accidentally plunges down 
into Earth's atmosphere during that close flyby, the plutonium -- which is in a 
solid, ceramic form and packaged in steel canisters -- could somehow be 
vaporized and spread around the world. 
</P>
<P>
That would require multiple failures, which NASA judged to be highly unlikely. 
In the end, the courts ruled for NASA, and protesters did not try to physically 
disrupt Wednesday's launching. 
</P>
<P>
Although Galileo will send data back to Earth during its entire journey, the 
most important payday will occur when the three-ton spacecraft, carrying a 
total of 16 scientific instruments, encounters Jupiter. Galileo will loop 
around Jupiter and its moons for two years, capturing close-up pictures of the 
planet and its moons with a high-resolution camera that will make the images 
from the Voyager spacecraft look like snapshots. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 days before Galileo reaches Jupiter, the spacecraft will release a 
probe designed to plunge into the gaseous planet's heart, sending back data 
until it is crushed by the dense layers of gas. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantis is scheduled to land at Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California 
on Monday at 12:39 p.m. The shuttle's pilot is Navy Cmdr. Michael J. McCulley. 
Other members of the crew are Shannon W. Lucid, Franklin Chang-Diaz and Ellen 
S. Baker. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RETURN TO JUPITER 
</P>
<P>
After a flight lasting six years, the Galileo probe will separate into two 
parts as it approaches Jupiter. The orbiter section will circle the planet for 
at least 22 months. The probe capsule will descend into the planet's atmosphere 
and make direct measurements until it is destroyed by the high-pressure gases 
there. 
</P>
<P>
GALILEO'S FLIGHT PATH 
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft was originally designed to make a 2 1/2-year direct flight to 
Jupiter. Changes after the Challenger disaster resulted in a six-year flight 
path using flybys of the planets Venus and Earth to build up enough speed to 
reach Jupiter.

Photo, At Long Last, Liftoff!In a spectacular launch, the shuttle Atlantis 
roared into space Wednesday on the first leg of the most ambitious planetary

BAY AREA QUAKE; 
</P>
<P>
U.S., STATE AGENCIES RUSH AID TO DISASTER AREAS 
</P>

Federal and state officials moved quickly Wednesday to help earthquake-stricken 
Northern California dig itself out and begin to rebuild freeways, bridges, 
businesses and homes damaged or destroyed by what was probably the nation's 
deadliest quake since 1906. 
</P>
<P>
Promising to "take every step and make every effort" to help the Bay Area, 
President Bush declared the region a disaster area and authorized what could 
total hundreds of millions of dollars in federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"The machinery is working," Bush said, hoping to shake off criticism of the 
federal response to two other disasters -- the Exxon oil spill and Hurricane 
Hugo. "We've made it very clear we want to be as responsive as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The Deukmejian Administration, meanwhile, unleashed an army of rescue workers 
and prepared to tap into state budget reserves to fund the restoration effort. 
Legislative leaders discussed the possibility of levying a special tax 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, who was on a trade mission in Europe, flew nonstop from 
Frankfurt to San Francisco aboard a commercial flight, not taking the Air Force 
plane that Bush had offered. He toured the quake-damaged area by helicopter and 
then held a press conference at the Alameda Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said he was upset and puzzled by the collapse of the Nimitz 
Freeway and a section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, which he thought 
were designed to withstand an earthquake as strong as this one. He said he 
would order a full inquiry of the freeway collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to say I am greatly displeased and disappointed because I had been 
under the impression that all of the structures that had been built" after 
earlier earthquakes were seismically safe, he said. "Even for a 
non-professional like myself to observe them, you can tell that obviously 
something went wrong and those support columns either did not have enough 
reinforcement or they weren't constructed according to the standards at that 
time. We don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Although he had seen pictures of the destruction on television, Deukmejian said 
the damage looked much worse in person. "It is just a horrible sight," he said. 
"It's something that you cannot fully appreciate by looking at the television 
screen." 
</P>
<P>
Legislative leaders urged members of the state Senate and Assembly to stay 
close to home in case Deukmejian decides that a special session is needed to 
respond to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
But Deukmejian said that, while he will confer with legislative leaders over 
the next few days, a special session probably will not be needed. Under recent 
legislation, the governor has legal powers to authorize state agencies to take 
whatever actions are necessary to provide assistance. He said the state's 
$1-billion reserve should be sufficient to fund the relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove), chairman of the Senate Revenue and 
Taxation Committee, said lawmakers may have to consider a special temporary 
increase in the state gasoline tax to pay for needed repairs. Deukmejian, 
however, branded such talk "premature." 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) also had reservations 
about a possible tax increase. "We certainly should exhaust all the resources 
we have before we call on that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The deployment of workers and equipment to help the ravaged area dig out was 
among the most ambitious ever undertaken by state government. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a major mobilization of state resources," said Tom Mullins, a spokesman 
for the State Office of Emergency Services. "We're very pleased with the way 
all state agencies have responded. They've responded according to plan." 
</P>
<P>
The state police, the Highway Patrol and a company of military police from the 
California National Guard were sent to maintain security. The California 
Conservation Corps went to help move rubble. The Department of Water Resources 
checked dams in the area and found none damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The state fire marshal sent crews to check hospitals and put inspectors in the 
field to look for leaks in pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
Mental health counselors were dispatched to work with trauma-stricken rescue 
workers, and the Health Department monitored the medical response, checked the 
water supply and searched for leaks of toxic materials. 
</P>
<P>
Even prisoners chipped in: inmates from state prison camps were dispatched to 
Santa Cruz, Hollister and Gilroy to fight fires and help in other recovery 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
In all, more than 1,700 people were sent by the state to lend assistance. 
</P>
<P>
On the federal side, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater announced 
that $273 million in federal assistance was available for immediate use in 
California for such things as highway repair, temporary housing and low-cost 
loans to cover uninsured property. 
</P>
<P>
The money had to be shifted from a $1.1-billion appropriation for the Hurricane 
Hugo cleanup in the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, South Carolina and North 
Carolina. The earthquake recovery is expected to cost more than the Hugo 
effort, and the Administration eventually will have to ask Congress for 
additional funds to cover both, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush indicated that special attention would be paid to highway reconstruction, 
particularly to such crucial transportation links as the San Francisco-Oakland 
Bay Bridge and the Nimitz Freeway -- both of which are part of the federal 
interstate highway system. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento) said at least $300 million in new funds would be 
needed. Damage to California highways will exceed $500 million, he said, and 
Congress will need to remove a $100-million cap on road funds to a single 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Federal military assistance so far has included the provision of food and water 
by the Naval Station at Treasure Island to motorists who were stranded when a 
section of the Bay Bridge collapsed. And Seabees stationed at Alameda Naval Air 
Station provided heavy equipment to help lift a collapsed Oakland freeway off 
of crushed cars. 
</P>
<P>
Military hospitals, in an unusual move, threw open their doors to civilians. By 
late afternoon, Letterman Army Medical Center on the Army's historic Presidio 
had treated 24 civilians. An Army field hospital set up shop on Travis Air 
Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
Ft. Ord provided blood supplies and Naval Station Alameda sent hundreds of 
bottles of water to the city of Oakland. The warship Gridley, in port in San 
Francisco harbor, began to desalinize water for the city's use. And some of the 
Navy's heavy-lift helicopters moved backhoes and trucks to stricken areas. 
</P>
<P>
Within the next several days, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 
will set up "disaster application centers" at 17 sites within the disaster area 
declared by Bush -- the city of San Francisco and the counties of Alameda, 
Monterey, San Benito, San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
Other counties may be designated for aid after a damage assessment is 
completed, FEMA acting director Robert H. Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
The Internal Revenue Service announced it will waive certain penalties if a 
taxpayer is unable to file a required return or to make a required payment 
because of earthquake devastation. 
</P>
<P>
An IRS official also said people hit with uninsured property losses may obtain 
a speeded-up casualty deduction by immediately filing an amended 1988 income 
tax return rather than waiting to file a 1989 return. The official recommended 
that such claims be accompanied by a photograph showing damage. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said it would make 
available to the homeless in the San Francisco area more than 100 homes that 
HUD has repossessed. 
</P>
<P>
Further, HUD Secretary Jack Kemp has directed that additional vouchers and 
certificates be designated for California for rental payments and other relief 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Kemp said certain loans may be available for owners of single-family 
homes and small apartment buildings. Finally, HUD community development block 
grants can be used for repairing water, sewer, electrical and telephone 
facilities, the secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Small Business Administration is preparing to make loans and 
grants to businesses, homeowners and renters in the quake-stricken area. 
</P>
<P>
SBA spokesman Ben Jarrett suggested that the first loan checks will be issued 
within two weeks of the opening of FEMA disaster application centers. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I've been able to determine, quite a few number of applications and 
funds will be needed," Jarrett said. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials said Bush might make a quick visit to the ravaged region 
Friday or Saturday. The President dispatched Vice President Dan Quayle, 
Quayle's wife, Marilyn, and Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner to the area 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The White House is consulting with California state officials and members of 
the California congressional delegation to arrange a trip by Bush. But White 
House Chief of Staff John Sununu said Bush realizes a presidential trip could 
pose problems for the disaster area and would not make the trip until persuaded 
that "he won't be a burden to those who have obligations in the aftermath of 
the earthquake."

BUSINESSES ESCAPE WITH RELATIVELY MINOR DAMAGE; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: MOST FIRMS WERE CLOSED FOR THE DAY, BUT OFFICIALS BELIEVE THE 
LONG-TERM COMMERCIAL LOSS MAY BE SLIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Bay Area was closed for business Wednesday as most workers stayed home and 
their employers used skeleton crews to clean up and assess the damage after 
Tuesday's disastrous earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
But most businesses reported that, despite widespread shattered windows, 
toppled furniture and broken equipment, damage to commercial structures was 
relatively slight. Telephone service was restored within hours at most 
businesses, allowing them to make contact with and reassure their employees and 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
Many factories, offices and hotels throughout the region were still without 
electricity or were operating on emergency power systems Wednesday, however, 
and that -- coupled with damaged roads and bridges -- prompted government and 
law enforcement officials to urge people to stay home from work for the day. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the lack of structural damage to most skyscrapers and industrial 
facilities -- many of which were built under strict earthquake codes -- most 
Bay Area employers contacted Wednesday were optimistic that they could reopen 
as soon as today, if electricity is restored and roads are passable. 
</P>
<P>
A quick resumption of business could prove important for the state as a whole. 
The Bay Area represents about 25% of the state's economy, measured in terms of 
personal income, according to an estimate by First Interstate Bank. A lengthy 
disruption of that large a segment could negatively affect the economy of the 
rest of California and the nation, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman declined to estimate how much the quake-induced shutdown will cost in 
terms of lost business, but most heaved a sigh of relief that the damage and 
economic loss wasn't much greater, given the magnitude of the temblor and the 
loss of life. 
</P>
<P>
Most companies cited emergency preparedness plans they have put in place over 
the past decade for the relative lack of impact on business. Many companies 
have backup power systems to keep computers running and emergency notification 
plans to keep customers and employees informed. On Wednesday, as scheduled 
under most of the emergency plans, many companies called on structural 
engineers to assess damage to buildings so they could quickly make decisions 
about when to reopen. 
</P>
<P>
Other than cleanup and damage assessment, a major order of the day for large 
companies Wednesday was to provide reassurance to those outside the area, 
including sales and field offices, European divisions and financial analysts in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
By early afternoon, Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. in Oakland had sent 
facsimile messages to all of the company's locations and sales offices outside 
the Bay Area notifying them that as far as it knew, its employees and offices 
had all survived the quake in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
But some business officials fretted that the quake will take a significant toll 
on the Bay Area's economy, at least in the short term. There was evidence to 
support that notion Wednesday, as travel agents reported cancellations by 
travelers who had made earlier reservations to visit San Francisco, and several 
conventions that were meeting in the city adjourned early and attempted to get 
their visitors home. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody I had going to San Francisco canceled or switched to Los Angeles," 
said Jane Bliss, owner of Travel As You Like It, a travel agency in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Businessman Bob Linsmayer of St. Paul, Minn., stood outside the venerable St. 
Francis Hotel on Wednesday afternoon attempting to get transportation to Reno. 
His convention, the Chief Executives Forum, had decided to switch cities after 
one day because the St. Francis still had no power and convention meetings had 
to be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we can't even assess the amount of damage (to tourism and 
convention business)," said Flo Snyder, director of the state Office of 
Tourism. "Of course, there is some immediate impact, but California has come 
out of these things before. I don't think there will be a long-term effect." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco's two largest convention facilities, the Civic Auditorium, built 
in 1915, and the Moscone Convention Center, built in the 1970s, were inspected 
and pronounced safe Wednesday. But a supercomputing trade show scheduled for 
the auditorium was delayed and a water pollution control convention at the 
Moscone Center, which had drawn an estimated 15,000 people to the city, was 
closed early so that the center could be used as a shelter for those displaced 
by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
The ports in San Francisco and Oakland were open on Wednesday, the Coast Guard 
reported, but activity was slow. Few trucks made cargo deliveries to the port 
area, and many shipping companies had instructed their employees to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard said there was little serious damage at either port, but that 
minor damage was extensive. One shipping operation, American President 
Companies of Oakland, said it was bothered by sporadic power outages throughout 
the day that disrupted its computerized cargo tracking system. As a result, 
cargo had to be catalogued the old-fashioned way -- by hand. 
</P>
<P>
Grocery and convenience stores scrambled to sweep up literally tons of broken 
glass, return undamaged products to shelves and find replacements for destroyed 
or fast-selling items. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-hour chains, such as 7-Eleven stores and Lucky supermarkets, stayed open 
if possible during the cleanups. Many stores that closed after the quake 
reopened on Wednesday, with the help of scores of executives, managers and even 
suppliers and vendors who commonly pitch in during such emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
Lucky Stores said it expected its six markets in the hard-hit 
Monterey-Salinas-Watsonville area to remain closed perhaps until Friday. Two of 
its stores that sustained severe losses of goods remained closed through late 
Wednesday. One store, on 18th Street in Oakland, was structurally damaged in 
the quake, so its reopening is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Most grocery chains said their warehouses held enough perishable products to 
restock most of their stores -- perhaps once. A major problem for some of the 
stores, however, was simply getting new supplies from warehouses to the stores. 
</P>
<P>
It took most of the day Wednesday and close cooperation with the Highway Patrol 
for the Great Bay Area division of Southland Corp., parent company of the 
7-Eleven franchise chain, to get its first semi-truck from its division 
headquarters in Pleasanton, in the East Bay, over the Santa Cruz mountains to 
the 30 or so of the hardest hit of its 309 stores in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Business officials were hopeful that after the initial shock wears off, any 
negative effects of the quake on the Bay Area's economy will disappear. Jack 
Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, noted that 
Southern California suffered an unexpected downturn in tourism in 1988, after 
the Whittier earthquake. But tourism so far this year has rebounded somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was concern that the quake's impact on the economy could be longer 
lasting than some hopeful officials now predict. 
</P>
<P>
For executives from across the country, already showing reluctance to move to 
California because of high housing costs and congestion, the quake may have 
clinched decisions to stay put or move elsewhere, executive recruiters said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as we have the Rose Bowl game here on New Year's Day, and it's bright and 
sunny and it has a tremendous impact on people in Chicago, this has a 
tremendous impact, unfortunately a negative one," said John S. Peterson, an 
executive director in the Los Angeles office of Russell Reynolds Associates, a 
search firm. 
</P>
<P>
Recruiters in Southern California told of candidates from Chicago, Dallas and 
Oklahoma who had cited concerns about earthquakes in withdrawing their names 
Wednesday from consideration for top corporate posts locally. Search firms were 
pleading with other executives to keep an open mind, noting that there is a 
risk of facing nature's wrath wherever one lives. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Kaplan, who heads a Pasadena search firm, predicted that recruiters would 
find California a tough sale for some time. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until 10 years ago, when we weren't dealing with other problems -- the cost 
of housing, smog, congestion, gridlock -- you could really much more 
effectively sell around earthquakes," Kaplan said. "But we are becoming less 
and less of a desireable area to recruit to."

BAY AREA QUAKE;

<P>
INSURERS FACE MASSIVE QUAKE LIABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL and PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Insurance companies could be held liable for as much as $3 billion to $4 
billion in losses from Tuesday's earthquake that rocked the San Francisco Bay 
Area, Richard J. Roth Jr., assistant state insurance commissioner, said 
Wednesday. The total does not include the cost of repairing roads, bridges and 
other uninsured structures. 
</P>
<P>
While it will take insurance companies 10 days to two weeks to complete a 
comprehensive assessment, some experts estimated that insured losses could 
approach Hurricane Hugo's record $4 billion. "It's the Western version of 
Hugo," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Tuesday's quake, 1989 had become by far the worst year ever for 
catastrophes. With 2 1/2 months remaining, the year's insured losses total 
$5.64 billion, double the previous record of $2.82 billion in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, insurers paid about $350 million in claims as a result of the 
Whittier quake two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, insurance stocks were among gainers in Wednesday's trading on Wall 
Street. Investors, according to some market observers, evidently bet that the 
year's heavy insured losses will provide insurance companies with a golden 
opportunity to raise premiums and fatten profits, a theory the industry 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Roth said he figures that insured losses to buildings and other structures from 
actual shaking by the Bay Area quake will total about $1 billion. Additional 
losses will be covered by insurance against fire, wrecked vehicles, medical 
costs and death -- not to mention public liability lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Roth's estimate did not include such major public works as the damaged San 
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, the collapsed portion of the Nimitz Freeway in 
Oakland or repairs to the Oakland and San Francisco airports. Taxpayers will 
pick up those bills. Indeed, a Caltrans spokesman said the department is 
seeking an emergency appropriation to begin immediate public rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
As for residential damages, only about 20% of homeowners pay the extra premium 
required for earthquake coverage, the industry estimates. Although California 
law requires all insurers doing business in the state to offer earthquake 
insurance, customers are not obliged to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, insurers rushed "catastrophe teams" of claims adjusters to the 
stricken area. Los Angeles-based Farmers Group Insurance Cos. flew a team of 50 
adjusters to Pleasanton in Alameda County to set up an emergency processing 
center to handle its customers' earthquake damage claims. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers spokesman Jeffrey C. Beyer said the company insures about 250,000 
homeowners and 450,0000 motorists in the Bay Area. About two-thirds of its 
automobile policyholders buy "comprehensive" coverage, which covers personal 
injury and damage to the vehicle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fireman's Fund, based in the Marin County town of Novato, was among major 
insurers putting out a call for independent claims adjusters to help reach all 
customers within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners and businesses without earthquake insurance but covered for other 
property damages would probably not be covered for collapse from shaking but 
might collect for damage by water and fire, said Ed O'Hare, spokesman for the 
industry-supported Insurance Information Institute. 
</P>
<P>
The coincidence of multibillion-dollar national disasters happening in 
consecutive months generated shock waves among state insurance regulators, some 
of whom were meeting in Washington to discuss, among other topics, the adequacy 
of insurers' reserves for catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
"What troubles us is the combination of Hugo and the earthquake coming back to 
back," said Robin Campaniano, Hawaii's insurance commissioner and head of the 
earthquake panel of the National Assn. of Insurance Commissioners. "It may have 
a significant impact on insurers." 
</P>
<P>
But in California, Roth said insurance companies should be able to handle the 
expected Bay Area losses easily -- "even if it runs as high as Hurricane Hugo."

BAY AREA QUAKE;

<P>
WORLD SERIES TO RESUME TUESDAY AT CANDLESTICK, VINCENT DECIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Play ball, said baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent late Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Bay Area recovering from its worst earthquake since 1906, the World 
Series between the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics will resume at 
Candlestick Park next Tuesday night, Vincent decided. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made at a news conference in a room at the St. Francis 
Hotel lit by candles and remote television camera lights. The St. Francis, like 
most of the Bay Area, is still without full power. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Candlestick nor the Oakland Coliseum is ready yet, but Vincent said he 
expects the ballparks to be prepared next week. 
</P>
<P>
Games 3, 4 and, if necessary, 5 will be played in San Francisco, as scheduled 
before Tuesday night's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the longest gap during a World Series since 1911 when there was a 
week delay because of rain-outs in the meeting between the New York Giants and 
the Philadelphia Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"It is becoming very clear to all of us in major league baseball that our issue 
is really a modest one in light of the great tragedy," Vincent said. "It is 
also clear that we are not going to be able to play baseball at either park in 
this area until next Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
The Bay Bridge Series was postponed Wednesday for the second straight day. The 
earthquake struck Tuesday just 30 minutes before game time. 
</P>
<P>
"We had 17 structural engineers and two architects totally examining the 
stadium for the impact. We feel there is no structural damage," said John Lind, 
Candlestick's manager. "There are some minor repairs and some cleanup. There 
are areas where we would like to explore in the next few days, to make sure 
beyond a shadow of a doubt." 
</P>
<P>
Said Vincent: "The alternative of waiting a few days seems to be better than 
canceling the World Series, but this is said in light of understanding the 
difficulty this area is having. We will not be playing while this community is 
in the early stages of its recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe Tuesday is a very good working hypothesis, but it is not definite 
yet. I think our preferred course is to play at Candlestick." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants have been told to report to Candlestick Park Thursday afternoon for 
a 1 p.m. workout. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson said he talked to Oakland A's officials Wednesday 
morning. He told a Times reporter: "I told them that at this time I felt it 
would be inappropriate to play baseball in our city while there are still 
bodies resting under the concrete of the (Nimitz Freeway) overpass."

DOCTORS AND NURSES WAITED FOR CRUNCH THAT NEVER CAME

<P>
Doctors, nurses and hospital technicians marveled here Wednesday at how well 
their emergency medical system worked in the face of probably the deadliest 
earthquake in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
Although they had to work long stretches over more than 24 hours at times 
without telephones or electricity, occasionally even having to pump air into 
patients' lungs manually, medical personnel said the emergency response was 
carried off largely without hitch. 
</P>
<P>
Off-duty medical personnel came to work. Backup power generators began 
operating. Patients not in critical condition were sent home, as hospital beds 
were readied for an onslaught of thousands of earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
But the crush of patients never came. Doctors and nurses in emergency rooms 
throughout San Francisco, Alameda and neighboring counties found themselves 
tending to a lot of bruises and broken bones but relatively few serious 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Such efficiency, they acknowledged, came at a terrible cost. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more of (a case) for the coroner than for the medical community," Dr. 
David Kears said of Tuesday's quake. 
</P>
<P>
"The real tragedy was at the site," said Kears, interim chief of Oakland's 
Highland General Hospital, one of Oakland's largest hospitals and a county 
trauma center, located near the stretch of Interstate 880, called the Nimitz 
Freeway, that collapsed in Tuesday's quake, killing dozens of commuters and 
other highway travelers. 
</P>
<P>
"No amount of medical preparedness can address the problem of collapsed 
concrete," Kears said. 
</P>
<P>
Most people either walked away from the Nimitz unscathed or were killed by it, 
explained Pat Connell, acting chief of Highland's emergency room, who was 
working the day after the quake, his 40th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Like many physicians and nurses throughout the Bay Area, Connell came to work 
voluntarily on his day off. Wearing street clothes -- flip-flop sandals, khaki 
pants, a leather vest and an Army fatigue hat -- Connell said he visited the 
site of the highway collapse Tuesday evening and found many ambulances, many 
people who wanted to help, but very few people who needed help. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a case of the quick and the dead. You either walked away or you were 
dead," Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
Some hospital administrators were almost embarrassed at how little there was 
for them to do during the emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Only two youngsters were referred Tuesday night to Children's Hospital Medical 
Center of Northern California in Oakland. There weren't even "the usual bumps 
and bruises" that the hospital emergency room normally sees, commented a 
hospital spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Alta Bates Hospital, one of the area's best hospitals in Berkeley 
only five miles from the freeway collapse, saw 37 patients and admitted only 
three of them. 
</P>
<P>
In all, according to estimates by the Hospital Council of Northern and Central 
California, 2,750 people have been treated at 112 Bay Area hospitals, but only 
250 remain hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the disaster, most hospitals in the area have remained "fully 
operational" and no patients or workers were injured at any hospital in the 
region, although some facilities sustained damage, said C. Duane Dauner, 
president of the California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems. 
</P>
<P>
The association, which is monitoring and assessing the situation, said the 
latest status report on the hospitals in the area showed that only five 
appeared to have sustained enough damage sufficient to affect operations. 
</P>
<P>
The most severely damaged hospitals are Watsonville Community Hospital and 
Peralta Hospital in Oakland, both of which were closed down, and Herrick 
Hospital in Oakland, which closed its upper three stories. 
</P>
<P>
Even though they had far fewer victims than they anticipated and even though 
emergency systems seemed to run smoothly, hospital workers said they had to 
work through the night under some dicey conditions. 
</P>
<P>
At Highland General, Judy Ricci, assistant director of nursing, described the 
hospital's brief power failure as the "longest 30 seconds" of her life. Suction 
machines, life support systems -- everything -- failed for a moment. Medical 
personnel had to manually pump air into patients who were on resuscitation 
devices. Even though lifesaving equipment almost instantly resumed operation, 
lights did not come back on for many hours. 
</P>
<P>
Nurses and doctors found themselves working with patients by flashlight, if 
they could find one. "Who keeps 200 flashlights handy?" Ricci quipped. For a 
while, there was no phone, no radio. It was impossible to communicate with 
ambulances to know the magnitude of what was happening, Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
But the period of crisis has not entirely passed. According to studies of 
earthquakes in other parts of the world, there tend to be a higher than normal 
incidence of heart attacks and an unusually large number of births in the 48 to 
72 hours after a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, a team of mental health workers is being organized at Alta Bates 
to accept calls. 
</P>
<P>
At Eaden Hospital Medical Center in Castro Valley, a series of two-hour 
sessions with social workers and psychologists is being organized to allow 
people to talk through their earthquake fears.

32 MILLION LIVE IN POVERTY, CENSUS BUREAU REPORTS 
</P>

<P>
Nearly 32 million Americans lived in poverty in 1988, the Census Bureau 
reported Wednesday, marking the second straight year in which the nation made 
no significant inroads against poverty despite a continuing economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like this is as low as it's going to get for a while, and it isn't 
very low," said Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy 
Priorities, a private research group. "It is disturbing that, despite a sixth 
year of economic recovery, both the nation's poverty rate and the income of a 
typical household showed no significant improvement." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Census Bureau found some cause for encouragement in the report, 
pointing to a 1.7% increase in per-capita personal income last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a year basically in which most groups stayed the same or improved," said 
William Butz, the agency's associate director for demographics. 
</P>
<P>
The poverty rate fell from 13.4% in 1987 to 13.1% last year, and the number of 
impoverished people dropped from 32.3 million to 31.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Whites, blacks and Latinos made no significant gains in 1988, leaving wide gaps 
between the three groups' poverty rates: 10.1% for whites, 31.6% for blacks and 
26.8% for Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Both the number of poor people and the poverty rate have been inching down 
since 1983, but each still exceeds the recent low points, set in 1978, when the 
poverty rate was 11.4% and 24.5 million people were impoverished. 
</P>
<P>
The poverty line last year was $12,092 for a family of four. 
</P>
<P>
Greenstein said that there has been a lack of progress against poverty recently 
because the benefits of the economic expansion are flowing disproportionately 
to the wealthiest Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The poorest fifth of the population received 4.6% of total national family 
income in 1988, the lowest percentage since 1954, but the richest fifth 
received 44%, the highest ever recorded, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau reported also a jump in real per-capita income last year, to 
a new high of $13,120. Blacks made bigger gains than whites but still lagged 
far behind. 
</P>
<P>
Income of whites rose 1.5% to $13,900; income of blacks increased 3.9% to 
$8,270. Per-capita income of Latinos was virtually unchanged at $7,960. 
</P>
<P>
There were notable income gains in certain parts of the country. Median 
household income shot up 3.7% to $30,430 in the Northeast and rose 2.6% in the 
Midwest to $27,540. Household income dropped 1.4% in the South to $24,610 and 
0.6% in the West to $28,840, but neither decrease was considered significant.

ETHICS PANEL GIVES REP. BATES LIGHT PENALTY IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASE; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: WOMAN WHO BROUGHT CHARGES AGAINST SAN DIEGO LAWMAKER IS 'DISGUSTED.' 
</P>

<P>
In its first decision involving sexual harassment, the House Ethics Committee 
on Wednesday rebuked Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) for improper conduct toward 
two women on his office staff and warned him that future misconduct would bring 
stronger discipline. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, acting in the first of four cases involving alleged sexual 
misbehavior by members of the House, imposed the lightest possible punishment 
on Bates for violation of House standards. Also, it directed him to send 
personal written apologies to the women who filed complaints against him. 
</P>
<P>
Bates, 48, said he was pleased that the 12-member panel had issued its ruling 
after considering the case for one year, adding: "I accept the committee's 
action and hope I can put this behind me." 
</P>
<P>
However, one of the women involved said that she was "disgusted" by the 
outcome, contending that the committee was too lenient and that the fourth-term 
lawmaker should have resigned his seat. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it sends a very bad message to the women on (Capitol) Hill," said 
Dorena Bertussi, one of the complainants, who now works for another member of 
the House. "It's outrageous. I don't think the committee did a thorough job at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Bertussi said she is considering filing a lawsuit against Bates for his conduct 
toward her when she worked in his congressional office for six months in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"He took my leg between his in full view of the staff and did a bump and grind 
on my leg," she said. "There were lots of comments on my breasts. I knew after 
working there for two weeks I would have to leave, but I stayed six months so I 
could get another job." 
</P>
<P>
The other complainant, Karen Dryden, no longer works on Capitol Hill and could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the panel, joined with Rep. 
John T. Myers (R-Ind.), its ranking GOP member, in writing the formal "letter 
of reproval." 
</P>
<P>
"Your improper conduct and concurrent violations of relevant standards deserve 
reproval," they wrote, in what Myers termed a "very strong letter." In addition 
to the sex harassment charges, the panel found that Bates had broken House 
rules by conducting impermissible campaign activity from his Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon and Myers said that Bates' expressions of regret for his actions and his 
adoption of a written office policy forbidding sexual harassment were factors 
weighed by the committee in deciding to mete out the least possible punishment. 
</P>
<P>
"The committee recognizes and has taken into consideration not only your 
acknowledgment of errors, but also those steps you have taken to avoid any 
perception that you interact with staff in an untoward manner," the letter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bates said he had hired a consulting firm to develop sensitivity training for 
him and others in the office concerning attitudes toward women employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Sexual harassment is defined as anything that's offensive to another person," 
Bates told a reporter. "By that standard, I'm guilty, regardless of whether I 
intended it that way or not . . . . I think I was insensitive in the past. 
Hopefully, this will be a learning experience that I can benefit from." 
</P>
<P>
Bates, who won his 1988 reelection race with 60% of the vote, despite the 
allegations of sexual misconduct and charges that he had assigned his staff to 
do political work on government time, originally blamed Republican opponents 
for bringing the charges. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if the committee's ruling would affect him at the polls, Bates 
replied: "I don't know -- I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the House facing investigations by the Ethics Committee on 
charges of sexual misconduct are Donald E. (Buz) Lukens (R-Ohio), who has been 
convicted of having sex with a 16-year-old girl; Barney Frank (D-Mass.), who 
has admitted having sex with a male prostitute who later ran a sex-for-hire 
business out of Frank's apartment, and Gus Savage (D-Ill.), who was accused of 
fondling a Peace Corps volunteer during a trip to Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The House established its Ethics Committee -- officially the Committee on 
Standards of Official Conduct -- in 1967 as it was punishing Rep. Adam Clayton 
Powell (D-N.Y.), who had been indicted for tax evasion, sued for libel and 
charged with keeping his non-working wife on the payroll of his office. The 
committee enforces the House's Code of Official Conduct, which was toughened in 
1978 in the post-Watergate era. Unlike most committees, which are dominated by 
Democrats, the Ethics Committee's 12 members are evenly divided between the 
parties.

GORBACHEV OUT TO GET HIM, YELTSIN SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: OTHER RADICALS FEAR THEY ARE BEING SILENCED IN A RETURN TO 
CONSERVATISM.

<P>
In a bitter attack on President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, radical populist Boris N. 
Yeltsin accused the Soviet leader Wednesday of trying to drive him from 
politics in order to prepare for a sharp swing back to conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, a member of the Supreme Soviet, the national legislature, said his 
popularity and his leadership of a new opposition group within the Supreme 
Soviet has "aroused fierce antagonism" among conservatives in the Communist 
Party and government bureaucracy and that they are now working to purge him. 
</P>
<P>
Suggesting that Gorbachev fears him because of his grass-roots support, Yeltsin 
charged the party leader with orchestrating a campaign of media attacks and 
malicious rumors to discredit him. 
</P>
<P>
The latest attempt, Yeltsin said, was a "political farce." He said this took 
place when the Supreme Soviet, at Gorbachev's initiative, this week discussed 
allegations -- "a mixture of truth and lies" -- that Yeltsin had faked an 
assassination attempt. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Yeltsin's behavior has become a matter of intense speculation, 
fueled by articles in the official press and footage shown on television. He 
has been accused of being drunk almost throughout his recent tour of the United 
States, of brawling with opponents and, most recently, of being the victim of 
the assassination attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"All these are links in one and the same chain of actions to destroy me, and 
they are being carried out under the leadership of Comrade M. S. Gorbachev," 
Yeltsin said in a formal statement given to correspondents at the Supreme 
Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
Other radicals complained Wednesday of what they see as new moves against them 
by Gorbachev and the party leadership and expressed fears that they are being 
silenced as part of a conservative retrenchment. 
</P>
<P>
"We are facing an attempt at revenge by conservative forces for their defeat in 
last spring's elections," political analyst Yevgeny Ambarsumov said Wednesday 
in the weekly Moscow News, warning with other radicals of a coordinated 
conservative counterattack on them and, they believe, on the overall reform 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five members of the Congress of People's Deputies, the broad-based 
assembly, sent a formal question to Gorbachev on Wednesday demanding an 
explanation for his harsh criticism of a prominent radical deputy, historian 
Yuri N. Afanasyev, and of the editor of the country's most popular newspaper, 
the weekly Arguments and Facts. 
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for the group was refused permission to address the Supreme 
Soviet on Wednesday when Anatoly I. Lukyanov, the Soviet first vice president, 
ruled that the matter was a Communist Party affair and out of order. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, speaking to a group of senior newspaper editors last Friday, had 
accused much of the Soviet press of carrying too many critical reports on the 
country's problems without making constructive suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
He reportedly compared the political situation to a lake of gasoline that one 
match could set alight. 
</P>
<P>
According to widely circulated reports of the meeting, Gorbachev accused 
Arguments and Facts, which has a circulation of more than 26 million, of 
virtually seeking his ouster with its reports. He suggested that its editor, 
Vladislav A. Starkov, resign. 
</P>
<P>
But a number of editors, including several of those criticized, told their 
staffs later not to be too concerned. Gorbachev has routinely called them 
together over the last three years for similar sessions in order to "curb our 
lust for criticism and debate," as one journalist said.

A former Mexico City police chief was sentenced to 11 years and 11 months in 
prison on charges of carrying out an extensive extortion campaign against his 
enemies, including a dozen police officers. After a prosecution that came to 
symbolize the corruption cleanup campaign by former President Miguel de la 
Madrid, Arturo Durazo was also fined about $17,000 to repair damage he did to 
the public treasury, and he must repay his victims, the official news agency 
Notimex said. Last month, Durazo was also sentenced to six years on charges of 
illegal arms possession.

U.S. HOPES OUSTER WILL LEAD TO REFORM; 
</P>
<P>
EAST GERMANY: ERICH HONECKER'S RESIGNATION MAY LEAD TO DRAMATIC CHANGES IN WHAT 
HAS BEEN A REPRESSIVE REGIME. 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bush Administration policy-makers said Wednesday that the generational change 
at the top of East Germany's Communist Party could signal dramatic reform in 
what has been one of Eastern Europe's most rigid and repressive regimes. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Washington is ready for 
substantially better relations with East Berlin if the regime begins to respond 
to "the hopes and aspirations of its people." 
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. enthusiasm for the shift in East Germany was tempered by doubts 
that Egon Krenz, chosen to succeed the ousted Erich Honecker, is inclined by 
nature or experience to lead the country away from its Stalinist past. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Krenz has been very much in accord with the policies of Honecker," 
President Bush said at the start of a White House meeting with Republican 
congressional leaders. "Whether this step is a step toward more openness or 
not, I think it's way too early to say, and there's nothing in the record that 
would indicate that it is." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the President added: "There is dynamic change taking place in 
Eastern Europe and, it now appears, in (East Germany)." 
</P>
<P>
In the recent past, East Germany has been far more resistant to change than 
either Poland or Hungary, and U.S. officials do not really expect the wave of 
reform from those two nations to blow through East Berlin to the same extent. 
But they believe that any concessions would be extremely significant because 
the country is such infertile ground. 
</P>
<P>
Reading from a prepared statement, Fitzwater said: "The United States is 
prepared . . . to develop stronger and more constructive relations with (East 
Germany). It is up to the new leadership there to demonstrate through its deeds 
that it is ready to move in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
Although Fitzwater did not spell out the sort of deeds Washington is looking 
for, other officials said the United States will respond positively if the 
regime relaxes its grip on political activity, liberalizes its emigration 
policies and ends police repression. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. response is expected to strike a careful balance with any reforms, 
possibly starting with increased academic exchanges and advancing to more 
liberal trade if East Germany shows evidence of significant change. 
</P>
<P>
The optimism in Washington over the Krenz-Honecker reshuffle is based primarily 
on a belief that Krenz ultimately will decide that the only way to preserve 
Communist control is to ease the regime's repressive policies. 
</P>
<P>
In this view, Krenz first would wait to see if the increasingly restive 
population is satisfied with the change in personnel. If it is not, the party 
leader would change policy reluctantly. 
</P>
<P>
No one in the Administration believes Krenz will prove to be a German copy of 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a leader now viewed in the West as a 
genuine reformer. But some officials hope that Krenz will come to resemble 
former Soviet President Yuri V. Andropov, an unbending Communist who 
nevertheless tried to alter policies that had become outmoded and ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
Former Deputy CIA Director George Carver endorsed the comparison with Andropov, 
but he said that there is no reason to be encouraged by it. 
</P>
<P>
"Andropov's reform was designed to make the system more efficient," Carver 
said. "Under Andropov there was no reduction in repression of dissidents. It is 
very likely that Krenz is in the mold of Andropov. 
</P>
<P>
"Krenz is no closet liberal," Carver added. "He is basically a younger, more 
efficient, healthier version of Erich Honecker. He may realize that they have 
to open up a few safety valves. He may be more astute." 
</P>
<P>
Helmut Sonnenfeldt, a former State Department and National Security Council 
expert on Eastern Europe, said Krenz has a "well-deserved reputation as a 
hard-liner." 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the change is significant "because Honecker is a symbol of 
'stand-patism' and rigidity. This guy doesn't yet embody that." 
</P>
<P>
Krenz has long been considered Honecker's heir apparent. But he was not the 
only possible candidate for the top job. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials believe it is significant that Krenz, 52, is the 
youngest member of the Politburo. They believe that he can -- if he chooses -- 
show a flexibility that would be difficult for older leaders. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the Administration plans no major changes in its policy 
toward East Germany. It will continue to urge reform in its public statements, 
but it will wait until the character of the new regime becomes clearer before 
deciding on concrete action. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater's statement illustrated the Administration's policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The change of leadership in the German Democratic Republic (the formal name 
for East Germany) was obviously a response to the mass exodus of tens of 
thousands of Germans in the German Democratic Republic who have sought freedom 
and a better life in the West, as well as to rising pressures within the GDR 
for reform and democratic change," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States hopes the change "signals movement by the GDR 
leadership toward reforms that respond to the hopes and aspirations of its 
people, who have clearly demonstrated their commitment to peaceful democratic 
change." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said Bush has no plans at this time to contact Krenz.

HUNGARY'S PARLIAMENT: YES TO DEMOCRACY;

BUDAPEST, Hungary 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the glare of TV lights, Parliament on Wednesday adopted a series of 
constitutional amendments declaring Hungary a republic and marking the nation's 
dramatic return to a multi-party democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies in a nationally televised session voted 333 to 5, with eight 
abstentions, to accept nearly 100 modifications to the 1949 constitution drawn 
up after the Communist takeover. 
</P>
<P>
The vote formally ends one-party domination in the East Bloc nation, which was 
officially renamed the Republic of Hungary. Like other East Bloc nations, it 
had defined itself as a people's republic in which all power belonged to the 
workers and the Communist Party was the leading force. 
</P>
<P>
Under the modified constitution, Hungary will become an independent, democratic 
and constitutional republic asserting "the values of both bourgeois democracy 
and democratic socialism," according to Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the changes, affecting 90% of the old constitution, could be seen 
as creating a "transitional constitution" to change Hungary's political system. 
</P>
<P>
The new constitution not only sets the constitutional basis for the multi-party 
system but also codifies human and civil rights and separates the judiciary, 
executive and legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary's first multi-party parliamentary elections since 1947 are due to take 
place by the middle of next year. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 94 modifications were amendments eliminating all references to the 
leading role of the recently dissolved Hungarian Socialist Workers' (Communist) 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
"Political parties may be freely established and may freely function," the 
amendment declared. 
</P>
<P>
An entirely new constitution is to be drawn up and adopted by the new 
Parliament after the national elections, but Justice Minister Kulcsar has said 
the amendments are necessary to make next year's elections legal. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they abolish the 21-member collective presidential council headed 
by Bruno Straub, nominally head of state, which had broad powers, including 
acting for Parliament when it was not sitting, as well as overruling 
parliamentary decisions. In its place, a new post of president of the republic 
has been created. This role will be filled by Speaker of Parliament Matyas 
Szuros until a presidential election takes place, tentatively scheduled for 
Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Szuros proclaimed Wednesday a historic day for Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
"A parliamentary democracy and a legal state is being built in Hungary on the 
ruins of a dictatorship of sorts," he told the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new amendments, the new president will be the commander in chief of 
the armed forces, is authorized to call national and regional elections, may 
initiate a referendum but may not be a leader of any political party. 
</P>
<P>
The president may dissolve Parliament if it fails to approve a new government 
or votes for no-confidence in the government four times in one year. 
</P>
<P>
A completely new constitution will be drafted by Parliament after the 
multi-party elections, which the must be held by next summer according to the 
amendments adopted Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
However, the chamber stalled on one key move toward democracy, postponing a 
decision on opposition calls for a referendum on when to elect the head of 
state. Government leaders want the election next month, but opposition leaders 
say it's too soon. 
</P>
<P>
The voting came on the heels of another landmark decision -- the dissolution of 
the Communist Party and its replacement by the Hungarian Socialist Party, which 
has vowed commitment to a democratic system. 
</P>
<P>
Before the key votes, Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth called an emergency Cabinet 
meeting to discuss an opposition petition to postpone the election to the new 
state presidency until after next year's parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
Some opposition parties say they have no time or resources to organize against 
Socialist Party candidate Imre Pozsgay. Banking on an overall opposition 
majority after next year's elections, they want the president to be appointed 
by the new Parliament.

HOUSE PROSECUTORS URGE SENATE TO CONVICT JUDGE IN BRIBERY CASE 
</P>

<P>
The House urged the Senate on Wednesday to remove U.S. District Judge Alcee L. 
Hastings from office, arguing that Hastings betrayed his office by conspiring 
to take a bribe from a defendant in his court. 
</P>
<P>
But Hastings, in an impassioned appeal to keep his lifetime position, continued 
to maintain his innocence. "I am not guilty of having committed any crime and 
that is my defense," Hastings told a crowded Senate chamber to applause from 
the visitor's gallery filled with his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings is facing removal from office on 17 articles of impeachment passed by 
the House 413 to 3 in August, 1988. The articles accuse the 53-year-old judge 
of engaging in the bribery conspiracy and then lying about it and manufacturing 
evidence at his trial. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings was acquitted of the charges in a 1983 criminal trial, but his alleged 
bagman, disbarred Washington lawyer William A. Borders Jr., was convicted of 
the same crimes at a separate trial. A panel of federal judges, following their 
own three-year investigation, concluded that Hastings was guilty of the crimes 
and recommended impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted by the Senate and removed from office, Hastings would be only the 
sixth federal judge to lose his lifetime job and the only one removed from 
office on the same charges he was acquitted of at a jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing the issue of whether impeachment proceedings following acquittal 
would constitute a form of double jeopardy, Rep. John Bryant (D-Tex.), the lead 
House prosecutor, said: 
</P>
<P>
"What if a federal judge participates in a conspiracy to obtain a bribe, but by 
the use of false testimony and fabricated evidence is able to obtain an 
acquittal? What if all the facts indicate the judge's guilt? Are we in that 
unusual circumstance to look away . . . and allow the judge to continue to 
serve? Certainly the answer for us and for you must be no." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) said he was "saddened to come before you today 
to urge the removal of one of the handful of black judges who presently occupy 
the federal bench." But, he said, "We did not wage the civil rights struggle in 
order to substitute one form of judicial corruption for another." 
</P>
<P>
Hastings "has betrayed his office and is no longer fit to wield the power and 
authority that has been bestowed upon him," Conyers said. "There have been a 
lot of cases in our judicial system in which race has been involved. This is 
not one of those or I would be the first to tell you so."

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed opening the forests around 
Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks to controlled hunting of grizzly 
bears that menace people or livestock. The huge bears are protected under the 
federal Endangered Species Act, although limited hunting is allowed in 
northwestern Montana and Alaska. The plan, which is open to public comment for 
60 days, would allow hunters to take "nuisance" grizzlies in more than 10 
million acres of southwestern Montana, northwestern Wyoming and eastern Idaho.

The Senate gave final congressional approval Wednesday to a bill granting the 
country's four living former presidents several hundred thousand dollars each 
in pensions and for office and travel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
With just four senators in the chamber, the Senate on a voice vote approved an 
$18.4-billion measure for the Treasury and other agencies that contained $1.8 
million for the ex-presidents. There was no debate. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush is expected to sign the measure, the fourth of the 13 annual 
spending bills for the new fiscal year that Congress has sent him. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation provides $559,500 for Ronald Reagan, $387,800 for Jimmy Carter, 
$426,800 for Gerald R. Ford, $426,700 for Richard M. Nixon and $22,200 for Lady 
Bird Johnson, the widow of Lyndon B. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
A 31-year-old law entitles each former President to a $99,500 annual pension, 
plus federal financing for their office space, furnishings, equipment, staffs, 
telephone, mail and travel. Mrs. Johnson receives a $20,000 yearly pension plus 
$2,200 for postage. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation also provides: 
</P>
<P>
 -- $497 million for the Postal Service, $5.6 billion for the Internal Revenue 
Service, and $200,000 to renovate rooms in the vice president's formal 
residence to accommodate the three children of Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 3.6% pay raise for federal civilian employees except for members of 
Congress, federal judges and top executive branch officials. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A prohibition against the use of federal employee health benefits to pay 
for abortions unless the woman's life is endangered by the pregnancy.

CRIME: A FEDERAL PLAN TO PROVIDE CITIES WITH EMERGENCY AID TO BATTLE COCAINE 
DEALERS APPEARS MIRED IN BUREAUCRACY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One Thursday afternoon last month, a group of District of Columbia anti-drug 
officials marched into the offices of William J. Bennett, the Administration's 
top drug war official, with a plea for federal help. 
</P>
<P>
What they wanted was jail space: permission to transfer 250 local prisoners to 
federal facilities to make room for a planned round-up of cocaine dealers on 
the streets of the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
Their optimistic expectations grew out of a partnership established six months 
ago, when the Bush Administration declared the city to be a "test case" for a 
plan to offer aid to the nation's most vicious drug-trafficking areas. With a 
promised $80 million in "emergency" assistance, the district became the envy of 
drug-blighted cities across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But the Thursday afternoon meeting collapsed in an acrid exchange, with federal 
officials openly skeptical of the local proposal and district officials angry 
at the slow pace of promised prison construction. The anti-drug sweep was 
called off. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was illustrative of broader problems that have left the Bennett 
plan unable to put a lasting mark on a city bloodied by an undiminished spree 
of drug-related crime. Far from a panacea, federal power ran hard into 
bureaucratic realities. Officials unaccustomed to cooperating often did not. 
Elevated expectations gave way to frustration. 
</P>
<P>
The deadline for extending the project to other cities is rapidly approaching 
and the shortcomings in the district have raised deep concerns about whether 
expansion is wise. Not only is drug trafficking in cities like Los Angeles far 
worse than in Washington, Bennett aides say, but current budgets would allocate 
only about $5 million to each jurisdiction chosen for the accelerated efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"That's peanuts," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the lack of progress in Washington has been so apparent that Bennett's 
office may postpone aid to the soon-to-be designated "high-intensity drug 
trafficking areas" until officials can agree how to resolve the problems that 
have stymied the effort here. 
</P>
<P>
Six months after the district anti-drug effort went into effect, "it's very 
difficult to say to what extent there have been any positive results," 
acknowledged Reggie Walton, a top Bennett deputy and former federal judge here. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday, Walton said that any future assistance will be 
preceded by extensive "prenegotiation and planning" to ensure that the effort 
can succeed. "It doesn't make much sense to come up with a plan if you don't 
have the resources to make it work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett and Sterling Tucker, the top district anti-drug official, are scheduled 
to issue the first formal progress report on the district plan at a news 
conference today. Aides to Bennett said the report will point out the 
achievements of a 119-member federal law enforcement task force, which has 
arrested 116 drug dealers and seized $2.2 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the officials plan to call attention to a pair of street-level 
crackdowns by the U.S. Marshals Service that rounded up 456 fugitives and shut 
down 209 crack houses. 
</P>
<P>
But critics argue that such mounting arrests serve only to accentuate the 
failure of the Administration plan to relieve pressure on overcrowded prisons. 
Bennett pointed to the district's failure to provide more prisons as an example 
of its "irresponsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the District jail population has jumped from 8,600 to 9,500 since the 
plan was unveiled, forcing the city to release some prisoners early under an 
emergency order and to seek court permission to shut its jails to further 
inmates. 
</P>
<P>
The short-term solution Bennett proposed -- to "immediately" transfer 250 D.C. 
prisoners to federal institutions elsewhere -- took shape only slowly, moving 
15 to 20 prisoners a week until its completion last month. 
</P>
<P>
The promised construction of a $50-million, 700-bed federal prison in the 
Washington area was canceled after local officials voiced outraged opposition. 
Although the Administration pledged to build a 500-bed pretrial detention 
center within a year, the clock has been running for six months and a suitable 
site has not been found. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need anyone to tell us how to lock the dealers up," a senior D.C. 
police official said. "The only way you can arrest your way out of it is if 
you've got prison space." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett aides blame the slow progress on what Walton called "bureaucratic 
impediments." At the same time, they insist their assistance package never 
promised more than a measured contribution. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to remember that we did not jump up and down and say that this 
is the be-all and end-all of the drug war," said Bennett's deputy chief of 
staff, David Tell. 
</P>
<P>
But Administration officials nevertheless concede that the gap between the 
rhetoric of April and the grim reality of October teaches new lessons about the 
obstacles to progress in the drug war, even when mounted at the highest levels 
of government. 
</P>
<P>
And because the Administration hailed the crackdown in Washington as a 
laboratory for the new sweeping anti-drug strategy unveiled by President Bush 
last month, its critics contend that the preliminary results offer a telling 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
"Record numbers of arrests and prosecutions have just led to a bureaucratic 
nightmare," said Kevin Zeese, counsel to the Drug Policy Foundation, which is 
outspoken in its criticism of Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
"When you throw the federal government on top of existing bottlenecks, it just 
adds one more level of bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
Those who were parties to the squabble over prison beds last month, while 
disagreeing on who was at fault, agreed that the experience called attention to 
the potential pitfalls in such a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Aides to Bennett say the request for the prisoner transfer came just an hour 
before the anti-drug sweep was to begin, making it impossible for federal 
officials to determine whether the plan was sensible. 
</P>
<P>
But local officials said they needed to maintain autonomy even as recipients of 
the federal aid. "We want to coordinate with the federal government but we're 
not responsible for reporting to them," a senior district official said. 
</P>
<P>
Another example offered by local police officers and law enforcement experts 
suggests that the actual effect of overlapping efforts can be less than it 
appears. 
</P>
<P>
When the federal marshals conducted their highly publicized raids on crack 
houses last May, the critics say, their operation amounted to little more than 
"hit and run." With little coordination and scant follow-up, the operation 
exacted only a glancing blow on some drug operations when a knockout was within 
reach, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the idea was disruption, they did that just fine," a senior D.C. police 
official said. "But in terms of knocking these guys out of business, it didn't 
do the job." 
</P>
<P>
"There have been some disappointments," Bennett aide Tell acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Scrapping of the $50-million prison plan and adjustments to other spending 
plans have made accounting so chaotic that Bennett's office was unable 
Wednesday to provide an official estimate of how much of the initial 
$80-million proposal had actually been devoted to the district. One aide, 
however, said the total was about $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
Yet such problems have done nothing to quell the zeal of local officials from 
other jurisdictions eager to win christening as "high-intensity 
drug-trafficking areas" and to reap the federal aid it brings. 
</P>
<P>
Under a congressional mandate, Bennett must decide by early next year which 
cities deserve priority in the effort. Los Angeles, Miami, Houston and New York 
remain the leading candidates, but dozens of other cities have requested 
federal aid from Bennett's office. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, Administration officials said that lessons gleaned in the 
district had done nothing to undermine their belief that federal law 
enforcement assistance to drug-plagued cities could provide a vital tool in the 
anti-drug effort. 
</P>
<P>
Blaming much of the disorganization on mismanagement by Mayor Marion Barry and 
other district officials, they also expressed confidence that relationships 
between federal and local authorities would operate more smoothly elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
But they also made clear that the criticism about the district effort would 
make them wary of any ill-organized or under-financed effort. They voiced 
strong doubts that a one-fifth share of the $25 million budgeted for 
high-intensity trafficking areas next year would be sufficient to make progress 
in a city like Los Angeles, when the district had received far more money with 
little effect. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in a signal likely to spark concern among California officials, Walton 
made clear that assistance might not be forthcoming until the next budget year 
begins in October, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the experience in the district, he asserted: "I'm not sure that 
these efforts would or could be made part of this year's budget."

A teary Nancy Hoover Hunter testified that she initially did not like J. David 
Dominelli but fell in love with him after hearing about his impoverished 
childhood and time in Vietnam. Hunter is charged with 197 counts of fraud and 
tax evasion in connection with her work at Dominelli's J. David &amp; Co., the 
heart of Dominelli's fraudulent investment empire. Dominelli is serving a 
20-year prison term after admitting he bilked investors out of $80 million. The 
company was forced into bankruptcy by disgruntled investors in 1984.

A panel of experts for the National Research Council said the option of a 
master drain to the ocean to carry away selenium-laced agricultural drainage 
water in the western San Joaquin Valley should be reconsidered. The master 
drain concept, which would have funneled the farm waste waters through San 
Francisco Bay to the Pacific Ocean, was shelved in the wake of the bird 
mutations at Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge in the mid-1980s. The council's 
Jan Van Schilfgaarde said he personally supported the concept of a master drain 
but stressed that his group's report was only asking a state-federal study team 
to revive consideration. In 1985, a U.S. Bureau of Reclamation official 
estimated the cost of completing a drainage canal to the ocean at from $1 
billion to $13 billion.

S.F.'S MYSTIQUE IS STILL A STRONG ATTRACTION;

THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

New Yorker William F. Noonan was a candidate for a San Francisco-based position 
with his public relations firm earlier this year. He didn't get it. "But if I 
was offered it tomorrow I'd still go," he said Wednesday -- with the memory of 
Tuesday's earthquake still fresh. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't go there next week," said Detroit attorney Michael Sharpe. "But 
after this situation has blown over, I wouldn't hesitate." 
</P>
<P>
And Michael Cowners, a Chicago arbitrageur who was reared in San Francisco and 
owns land there said he was "stunned," but does not plan to sell his Bay Area 
real estate. 
</P>
<P>
For San Francisco's image in America -- sophisticated and romantic, saucy and 
free thinking, beautiful and proud -- the worst of times may not be so bad. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's earthquake clearly left a mark on the nation's collective psyche just 
as it left the City by the Bay battered, bent and mourning its dead and 
injured. Millions watching television in anticipation of the third World Series 
game Tuesday lost their pictures as a frantic announcer said "I think we're 
having an earth. . . . " Tens of millions more sat up late into the night as 
networks abandoned their programing to focus on the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
While the damage extended far beyond San Francisco, the focus was on the City 
by the Bay with a national mystique as unique as its rip-roaring history. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't it ironic that this happened after all the talk about the great 
publicity something like the World Series would generate for the Bay Area," 
said George Walters, of Baltimore. "It's disheartening to see such scenic 
surroundings obliterated in a few seconds." 
</P>
<P>
For the city, for its $2.5-billion-a-year tourist industry, Tuesday's quake was 
clearly a negative. 
</P>
<P>
"This is such a dramatic event that people are going to have a reaction to," 
said Eric Plaut, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at 
Northwestern University in Chicago, "and associate it with some very dramatic 
pictures that they saw on television. 
</P>
<P>
"These kinds of reactions are to the emotional impact of the event before 
(them)," said Plaut. "Most people don't have long (term) impacts. Everybody 
knows about the 1906 earthquake and . . . still the population has grown 
tremendously. The impact wears off." 
</P>
<P>
"Tourists will gather themselves and discover this is the type of rare tragedy 
that occurs in all places," said Leonard Pearlstein, president of 
keye/donna/pearlstein, the advertising firm that has the state of California 
tourism and economic development account. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a natural tragedy (memories) don't linger in a negative sense 
because you can't assess blame," said John F. Budd Jr., vice chairman of Carl 
Byoir and Associates, a national public relations firm that is often called in 
to help companies with image problems in times of crises. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see that anybody wouldn't visit Alaska because we had an earthquake in 
1964," said Marion (Scottie) Leight, a longtime Anchorage resident. "If you 
were to try to do that, you'd have a heck of a time traveling." 
</P>
<P>
That feeling, of course, is not universal. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never consider going out West and that's the main reason why, the 
chance of an earthquake," said Clinton Makel, who works for a Manhattan textile 
importing firm. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to my cabbie this morning, 'I'm glad I'm not living in San Francisco,' 
and he said 'That's what people say about New York,' " said Margaret Scott, a 
Manhattan mortgage broker. "New York has its dangers but we're all accustomed 
to the advantages and disadvantages of where we live." 
</P>
<P>
"I've enjoyed it both for business and personal reasons and up till (Tuesday) 
night I would have considered living there," said Dean Schmidt, who left the 
Bay Area for his Houston home less than two hours before the quake. "But no 
more. It's too risky." 
</P>
<P>
And as for William Noonan, president of International Burson-Marsteller Inc., a 
public relations firm, he's moving to Tokyo "which is even more vulnerable."

AID OFFERED FROM AROUND THE WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Word of the massive Northern California earthquake hit Manila just as the 
Wednesday morning news programs went on the air. Almost instantly, the 
telephone began ringing at the Washington home of Filipino Ambassador Emmanuel 
Pelaez. 
</P>
<P>
Halfway around the world, reporters for the Polish television network received 
word of the quake in the middle of the night and began calling their Washington 
embassy for information on casualties. 
</P>
<P>
Disaster had struck San Francisco, that most cosmopolitan of cities, and 
suddenly it seemed that nowhere in the world was too far away to be worried. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an umbilical cord between the Philippines and that area," embassy 
spokesman Adolfo Q. Paglinawan said of the Bay Area, home to thousands of 
Filipinos, as well as hundreds of thousands of Chinese, Japanese, Italians, 
Poles, Irishmen and immigrants from virtually every sector of the globe. 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday morning, offers of aid, most of them of little use but all well 
meant, were flooding into the State Department and the White House from around 
the globe. Greece, a nation with a long history of earthquakes, offered a team 
of 25 experts on seismology. Israel offered to help on rescue efforts. The 
Soviet Union, which has never before offered to aid the United States in a 
disaster, offered unspecified help. Pope John Paul II offered prayer. 
</P>
<P>
And along with those offers came messages of condolence. 
</P>
<P>
Some were expressed in the deep formality of diplomatic exchange. "I hasten to 
express to your excellency and to the bereaved families my heartfelt sympathy 
and condolences," wrote Japan's Emperor Akihito in a cable addressed to "His 
Excellency the President of the United States of America." 
</P>
<P>
Others took a more familiar tone. "Dear George," British Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher cabled from a Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in 
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, "please let me know if there's anything at all we can 
do to help." 
</P>
<P>
But all expressed the same reality -- in the age of instant communications, few 
events grab the attention of the world so quickly as the sight of an earthquake 
striking at the heart of a great city. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible," said Greek Embassy spokesman Achilles Paparsenos, "we've gone 
through it before. I, too, grew up in an earthquake area, Yolos, and I remember 
the shocks. You feel helpless. It's terrible." 
</P>
<P>
About 40,000 Greek-Americans live in the Bay Area, including San Francisco 
Mayor Art Agnos. The Greek government was one of the first to offer aid, 
sending its foreign minister to the U.S. Embassy in Athens with a list of 
experts who could travel to the United States if their services were needed. 
</P>
<P>
In Greece and elsewhere around the world, foreign ministry officials were 
flooded with calls asking for information and reassurance about the fate of 
aunts, uncles, children and friends. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to deal, as best as possible, with it, but like everyone else, 
we're having trouble getting through to people because of the telephone lines," 
said Daniel L. Labrosse, first secretary at the French Embassy here. "We have a 
lot of French tourists in the area," he said. "There have been a lot of calls." 
</P>
<P>
Nor were relatives the only ones calling. The size of the earthquake and the 
prominence of San Francisco made the disaster a leading story for journalists 
around the globe, who deluged their embassies with requests for information 
about just what had happened.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 4 ARRESTED IN EXTORTION; ASIAN GANG TIES 
ALLEGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four men thought to be members of an Asian organized crime network, the United 
Bamboo Gang, were arrested Wednesday on suspicion of trying to extort $200,000 
from a Paramount businessman, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests came after sheriff's deputies used search warrants to enter five 
San Gabriel Valley locations, Deputy Dean Scoville said. 
</P>
<P>
At four residences and one nightclub, deputies seized handguns, assault rifles 
and one "Street Sweeper" semiautomatic shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies and Los Angeles and Monterey Park police began investigating 
reports of attempted extortion about a week ago, Scoville said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies did not release the name of the victim or how he was being extorted. 
</P>
<P>
The four men arrested were identified as Khu Ca Ha, 47, of Rosemead; Hsiu Chun 
Huang, 35, of Hacienda Heights; Huy Cham Tran, 24, of Houston, and Billy Chi 
Kang Yang, 40, of Alhambra.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MCMARTIN DEFENSE CASTS DOUBT ON MEDICAL DATA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The attorney for the chief defendant in the record-breaking McMartin Pre-School 
molestation trial told jurors during closing arguments Wednesday in Los Angeles 
Superior Court that the prosecution's medical evidence is unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really bothered by the medical evidence and if you think I'm bothered by 
it because it affects my client's fate, you're right," said attorney Danny 
Davis, who represents former teacher Raymond Buckey, 31. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors at the trial had presented doctors who testified that they detected 
signs of molestation in the alleged victims -- children who attended the 
pre-school. The defense contends the medical evidence is unreliable and 
inexact. 
</P>
<P>
The defense presented its own medical expert, who testified that he could not 
detect signs of molestation in most of the alleged victims. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you get when you corroborate a crime that didn't happen?," Davis asked 
the jury in reference to the prosecution's medical evidence. "I'm bothered 
deeply by the medical evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62 -- both former teachers at the 
now-closed Virginia McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach -- are on trial for 
one count of conspiracy and 64 counts of child molestation for allegedly 
sexually abusing 11 of their pupils from 1978 until 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Their trial, now in its third year, is the longest criminal trial in U.S. 
history. It is also the most expensive, having so far cost county taxpayers 
more than $15 million since charges were filed more than five years ago.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE DELIVER BABY AFTER CHILD CALLS 911 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A child in El Monte telephoned the 911 emergency line Wednesday to summon help 
for a woman who had gone into labor. Moments later a police officer arrived and 
helped the woman deliver a baby girl, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police got a frantic phone call from a child at a home on Humbert Avenue at 
4:34 a.m. reporting that a woman was having a baby, police spokesman Tom Hunt 
said. There were several children in the home at the time and it was not 
immediately known which child had summoned help or what the relationship was 
between the caller and the woman. 
</P>
<P>
Officers Gary Antonitis, 31, and Rob McClung Jr., 28, were in the area and 
arrived within one minute, Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
"Officer Antonitis, who has assisted in the birth of his own three children, 
and Officer McClung . . . assisted the mother in giving birth to a healthy baby 
girl," Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
The mother and her new daughter were taken to Greater El Monte Community 
Hospital in good condition, he said.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: USC TEACHER CONVICTED IN CHILD PORNO CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The principal bass player for the Los Angeles Philharmonic was convicted of a 
misdemeanor charge Wednesday in a child pornography case that City Atty. James 
K. Hahn called a "classic glimpse into the shadowy world of pedophilia." 
</P>
<P>
After 1 1/2 days of deliberations, a Los Angeles Municipal Court jury convicted 
Dennis M. Trembly of exhibiting material depicting a child engaging in sexual 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Trembly, 41, of Los Angeles, who performs with the Philharmonic in addition to 
serving as a music professor at USC, gave an undercover officer a copy of a 
magazine featuring child pornography, Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators, armed with a search warrant, also found an untitled 8mm film 
featuring child pornography in Trembly's home, according to a spokesman for the 
city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"This case is a classic glimpse into the shadowy world of pedophilia and 
(shows) how pedophiles operated," Hahn said when the charge was filed in June. 
</P>
<P>
Police became aware of Trembly when U.S. Customs Service agents seized a child 
pornography magazine addressed to him, said Deputy City Atty. Tracy Webb. 
</P>
<P>
An undercover detective, feigning interest in child pornography, contacted 
Trembly and began corresponding with him, the prosecutor said. After exchanging 
several letters and phone calls, Trembly mailed the officer a copy of 
"Lollitots," which featured young girls in sexually explicit poses, Hahn said.

Confined to living on life-support systems, a 59-year-old immigrant from Iran 
realized a dream Wednesday when federal officials came to his Glendale home to 
swear him in as a U.S. citizen. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a wish that I had, and I did it," Hratch Petrossian said, speaking 
with difficulty over the noise of his respirator. "I came here for the freedom. 
Some emigres, they come to have a better life. That's not a crime. But for me, 
freedom is more important." 
</P>
<P>
Petrossian developed a degenerative nerve disease in 1981, one year after 
coming to the United States. The affliction kept him from seeing much of this 
country, but not from becoming a citizen. 
</P>
<P>
Petrossian, an Armenian, is confined to a wheelchair -- paralyzed from the neck 
down. He is hooked up to a respirator that does the work his atrophied 
diaphragm cannot. 
</P>
<P>
But Petrossian's mind works just fine, and he is a voracious reader who has 
long been fascinated with the American system of government, his wife and 
family said. He had applied to the Immigration and Naturalization Service in 
vain for citizenship for more than two years. INS officials, unaware of his 
disability, had repeatedly told him he had to come into the INS office to take 
a citizenship exam. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, when Petrossian's doctor wrote to the INS that his patient 
could not leave his home, INS officials responded immediately. They came over 
to Petrossian's apartment on Oct. 2 to administer the citizenship exam. With no 
formal preparation, Petrossian answered every question correctly. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Los Angeles Federal Court Judge William P. Gray came to Petrossian's 
home to swear him in and present him with a certificate showing he had passed 
the citizenship exam. 
</P>
<P>
With family gathered around him, drinking champagne and sharing Armenian 
pastries and a cake decorated with the image of an American flag, Petrossian 
smiled and kissed his wife and said he couldn't be happier. 
</P>
<P>
"I have enjoyed every second of my life, because I believe that one has to be 
positive," Petrossian said. 
</P>

STONES ROLL ON -- ROSE ACTS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rolling Stones and Guns N' Roses squared off Wednesday in a battle of rock 
'n' roll generations that proved to be explosive and surprising. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the Stones, but I kind of figure Guns N' Roses will take it," said 
Johnny Perale, 20, of East Los Angeles. "They are newer and more hip. The 
Stones are the legend, but Guns N' Roses are the legend in the making." 
</P>
<P>
By the time the Stones took the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum stage just before 
10 p.m., many in the audience of 72,000 had been wowed -- and perhaps stunned 
-- by some of the comments and antics of Guns N' Roses lead singer Axel Rose. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Los Angeles-based quintet struck a note, Rose -- who has been 
accused of racism and bigotry over the lyrics of one of his songs -- grabbed 
the microphone to heatedly defend himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sick and tired of all this publicity," said Rose, referring to recurring 
media debates over his use of certain offensive racial terms and insulting 
slang references to homosexuality in the group's song "One in a Million." 
</P>
<P>
After the band's first number, Rose again took the microphone and seemed to 
warn that internal friction might cause the band's demise. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless certain people in this band start getting their act together, this is 
going to be the last Guns N' Roses show," he said. "I'm sick and tired of too 
many people in this organization dancing with Mr. Brownstone," a reference to 
an anti-drug song on the group's hit album "Appetite for Destruction." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the quixotic commentary, the audience responded enthusiastically to the 
band's 80-minute show. Before and during the show, the audience browsed through 
stands selling souvenirs that ranged from the normal concert tour T-shirts to 
$190 Rolling Stones flight jackets and $450 leather jackets that seemed aimed 
at the older, and more affluent, Stones fans rather than the younger Guns N' 
Roses fans. 
</P>
<P>
Fireworks were set off when Stones' lead singer Mick Jagger leaped on stage at 
9:45 p.m. wearing a flashy blue and aqua waistcoat and singing the group's 
trademark song, "Start Me Up." 
</P>
<P>
Not even an earthquake could stop 50-year-old Norm Swenson from flying in from 
San Francisco to see the Stones. "I'm slowin' down, but I still go to the big 
ones," he said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 280,000 fans are expected to see the four concerts featuring the 
Stones that began Wednesday. The concerts are part of a 3 1/2-month tour 
expected to earn $90 million and to draw 3 million fans.

QUAKE EXPECTED TO JOLT REAL ESTATE MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM FURLONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The earthquake that rocked the San Francisco Bay Area on Tuesday afternoon is 
likely to cause severe short-term upheavals in the region's residential and 
commercial real estate markets while analysts sort out the depth of the 
building damage. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate experts said Wednesday that ripple effects from the devastating 
quake could range from canceled sales and leases on homes and office buildings 
to lowered property values and a pause in new investment. 
</P>
<P>
At a minimum, pending transactions are likely to drag on much longer than 
expected as buyers reevaluate their offers and property owners seek out and 
repair the damage, real estate specialists believe. 
</P>
<P>
The quake's devastation was especially severe in an elegant residential area in 
San Francisco known as the Marina, near Fisherman's Wharf, which was ravaged by 
fire and structural damage. But buildings throughout the Bay Area are now 
suspect, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"Property values will definitely go down, especially in the Marina," said David 
F. Ravetti, a real estate broker for Red Carpet. "I never thought that would 
happen in San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Woo, a real estate investor in San Francisco, said the quake was a 
major reason he has shelved plans to sell several residential properties even 
though they sustained only minimal damage. He now plans to rent the properties 
until the market settles down. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the situation is similar to the stock market," Woo said. "In the short 
run, real estate values are going to drop 5% to 10% before they rebound again 
next spring." 
</P>
<P>
The quake's devastation could give prospective Bay Area home buyers -- 
particularly out-of-staters especially sensitive to earthquake dangers -- 
second thoughts about moving to California. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you're going to have a short-term buyers-regret syndrome," said 
Kenneth Leventhal, an owner of a Los Angeles real estate consulting firm that 
bears his name. "It's like a disease that will get cured in 60 days." 
</P>
<P>
And if history repeats itself, the quake will be the last straw for others. "In 
every quake, you get people who leave California and go back to Oklahoma, 
saying: 'This is my last earthquake,' " Leventhal said. "I don't know if that's 
going to be two people, 200 or 2,000." 
</P>
<P>
The impact on commercial real estate is likely to be less traumatic, 
particularly in downtown San Francisco, where office high-rises withstood the 
quake without major visible damage. 
</P>
<P>
But older office buildings, as well as those near damaged freeways and bridges, 
may not be in such good shape, analysts say. "This may force down the rents on 
older buildings and raise them on newer ones," said Robert Gardner, partner in 
Robert Charles Lesser &amp; Co., a real estate consulting firm in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I would guess that of 200 leasing deals under way, maybe two or three or four 
would fall out of bed because of this," said Kirk Usher, a real estate broker 
for Cushman &amp; Wakefield in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the quake is expected to place at least a temporary hold on 
commercial investment as the dust settles and damage is assessed. "There is 
going to be some pause in the appetite for commercial investment," said Hugh E. 
Reams, vice president of LaSalle Partners, a Chicago-based real estate 
investment firm.

INNOVATION: THERE'S A LOT MORE R&amp;D GOING ON THAN FIGURES INDICATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like Chicken Littles of global competitiveness, technology pundits are running 
around the country shrieking, "The R&amp;D budget is falling! The R&amp;D 
budget is falling!" Japan now spends more of its gross national product on 
commercial research and development than we do, these gurus whine, and that 
means America is losing its innovation edge. 
</P>
<P>
While it's true that the R&amp;D numbers have long served as a surrogate index 
for innovation, that only confirms Mark Twain's nasty little epigram that there 
are lies, damned lies and statistics. America's R&amp;D stats hit a very large 
nail not quite on the head. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, industrial giants such as General Motors, IBM, DuPont and Merck spend 
billions of dollars annually on R&amp;D (with wildly varying results). But what 
about our post-industrial giants such as Citicorp, Federal Express, Goldman 
Sachs and American Express? What does research and development mean when you're 
in a service industry? 
</P>
<P>
* Federal Express is "a very R&amp;D-intensive company," says Ed Clark, who 
handles investor relations for the innovative shipping firm whose annual 
revenue is approaching $6 billion. "We are so oriented towards developing 
state-of-the-art technological solutions, that maybe we should consider 
capturing that expense." In other words, Federal Express has no R&amp;D budget. 
</P>
<P>
* Citicorp, America's biggest bank, spends hundreds of millions of dollars each 
year developing and modifying its state-of-the-art telecommunications networks 
and computer software to provide a host of innovative services for its 
institutional and retail customers. The bank has consistently been a pioneer in 
the application of technology to financial services. 
</P>
<P>
* Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of the Wall Street Journal and a top provider 
of data services, spent more than $5 million to buy two Connection Machines -- 
state-of-the-art supercomputers -- as platforms for a next generation of 
on-line information. 
</P>
<P>
* Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. hires physicists and mathematicians to dream up new 
financial instruments and build the software to implement them. 
</P>
<P>
* American Express and its Shearson Lehman Hutton unit have pioneered voice 
recognition technology on the trading room floor. 
</P>
<P>
None of these market leaders have R&amp;D budgets. In post-industrial fact, 
there are numerous examples of multibillion-dollar service sectors -- ranging 
from publishing to movies to restaurants -- where research and development are 
definitely taking place but in forms invisible to the statisticians. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe a McDonald's McCaviar wouldn't be what most electrical engineers would 
call a technological innovation, but it would certainly be a competitive 
innovation in the right marketplace. The challenge is measuring it in a 
meaningful way. 
</P>
<P>
This new reality didn't completely escape the National Science Foundation and 
the U.S. Census Bureau, the government agencies that track R&amp;D spending. 
"We clearly weren't doing a good job" of tracking service sector spending, 
acknowledges Melissa Pollak, a science resources analyst at the NSF. "So, we 
increased the coverage of that group. It caused a flurry of phone calls from 
those companies to the Census Bureau last year. They said, 'Why are you 
surveying us? We're not industrial companies.' " 
</P>
<P>
Of the 470 non-manufacturing companies surveyed, only 14 had R&amp;D data. 
"Basically, their response was, 'We don't do R&amp;D,' " Pollak says. 
</P>
<P>
Now this may be accurate, but it's also meaningless. Of course more than 3% of 
these companies do R&amp;D, it's just that it may not be research and 
development in the way the NSF traditionally thinks of research and 
development. Clearly, crafting new software, whether it is an expert system or 
a process simulation algorithm, involves both research and development. It also 
costs money and manpower. But where do you draw the line? What qualifies as 
innovation? New software? New packaging? New designs? New networks? 
</P>
<P>
These numbers conceal more than they reveal. The latest NSF figures say that 
there was $64.9 billion of research and development spending in the U.S. in 
1987. The four largest companies accounted for 19% of all R&amp;D spending, and 
the top 25 companies accounted for 40% of the total. Yes, the top 25 are 
virtually all industrial companies. 
</P>
<P>
NSF's Pollak notes that where non-manufacturing companies once accounted for 
3.4% of R&amp;D spending in 1981, they now account for 9%. But "most of that's 
reported by the emerging software companies," such as Lotus Development and 
Microsoft. The software companies, like their industrial cousins, do have 
formal R&amp;D budgets. That makes them easy to measure. 
</P>
<P>
The point isn't to pick on the NSF and Census Bureau for taking the easy way 
out. On the contrary, the NSF approaches the challenge of measuring R&amp;D 
spending from a completely understandable science-and-technology-based 
perspective. It makes sense for people who still view global markets in the 
context of technologically flavored industrial goods. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, while these R&amp;D numbers may work for traditional science and 
technology investments, do they adequately capture what's going on in some of 
the most critical segments of America's economy? If we're really concerned 
about research and development, if we really believe that innovation is key to 
global competitiveness, we have to redefine what those words mean. We have to 
recalibrate the tools we use to measure them. 
</P>
<P>
I don't want to diminish the importance of the more traditional industrial 
R&amp;D in any way. But it's time that policy-makers understand that innovation 
can be made of more than microchips and restriction enzymes. It's also time for 
people who work in service sector companies to recognize that, whether their 
budgets formally measure it or not, they also do research and development. 
Managing that R&amp;D well will be key to their success in global markets.

Nordstrom Wrongfully Fired Clerk: A superior court jury in Seattle awarded 
$180,000 to a former Nordstrom Inc. sales clerk who claimed she was wrongfully 
dismissed by the clothing retailer following a smear campaign mounted by 
co-workers jealous of her success. The lawyer for Cynthia Nelson, 26, of 
Kirkland, Wash., said the jury's decision vindicated his client and was a 
warning to Nordstrom about its treatment of employees. Nelson was fired in 
September, 1986, when company officials confronted her with five anonymous 
letters accusing her of stealing from other employees and wrongly crediting 
herself with commissions earned by other clerks.

Japan's Central Bank Warns Bankers: The head of the Japanese central bank 
warned the country's cash-rich commercial bankers to be careful about financing 
highly leveraged corporate buyouts abroad. "The decision to participate in LBOs 
should basically be made by each individual bank, but they have to be careful 
about the possible risks involved in such deals abroad," Bank of Japan governor 
Satoshi Sumita said. He warned that LBO deals could run into difficulties in 
paying off the huge loans if interest rates rose and economic conditions 
worsened.

BOND PRICES LITTLE CHANGED; DOLLAR DROPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bond prices finished little changed Wednesday in more subdued dealings as the 
stock market stabilized, the dollar fell and attention focused on an impending 
supply of new issues. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond finished with a gain of 1/32 point, or 
about 30 cents for every $1,000 in face amount. Its yield held at 8.03%, 
unchanged from late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said bond prices rose as much as $5 for every $1,000 in face value 
early in the session because of worries that the potential economic 
consequences of the California earthquake would send stock prices sharply 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks opened lower but quickly recovered, and the Dow Jones industrial average 
finished with a gain of nearly 5 points on the day. 
</P>
<P>
As stocks recovered, bond prices relinquished some of their gains. 
</P>
<P>
"The bond market is still taking its cues from stock market fluctuations, and I 
expect that will continue for awhile," said Mickey Levy, chief economist for 
First Fidelity Bancorporation of Lawrenceville, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
He said bond traders feel that if stocks fall sharply, the Federal Reserve is 
likely to encourage lower interest rates, a positive development for bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended weaker against key foreign currencies after a mixed 
performance overseas, with the Bay Area earthquake registering only a slight 
influence on foreign exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said the dollar sank in overnight trading on news of the 
earthquake, but it regained some ground on the strength of the U.S. stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Ryan, senior currency trader for the Bank of New York, said an 
unconfirmed report that the Federal Reserve moved to buy dollars early in 
trading also helped support the dollar. However, most dealers dismissed the 
rumor. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the market was awaiting today's release of consumer price index 
figures for September, hoping they would shed more light on the direction of 
the economy and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
fell to a closing 142.10 Japanese yen from 142.25 yen Tuesday. It traded at 
141.40 yen in London and New York, compared to 142.70 in New York on Tuesday. 
The dollar was lower against the British pound. Sterling bought $1.5880 in 
London, up from $1.5835 late Tuesday. In New York, the pound was worth $1.5922, 
up from $1.57575. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures prices slipped to their lowest point this month on New York's 
Commodity Exchange, and some experts said the market's four-month rally may be 
weakening. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, precious metals advanced, energy futures retreated, 
grains and soybeans were mixed, livestock and meat futures were mixed and 
stock-index futures rose. 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures settled 0.40 cent to 2.85 cents lower, with the contract for 
December delivery at $1.2645 a pound, its lowest close since Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Some technical analysts interpreted the break below $1.27 as an indicator of 
further losses to come, while fundamental analysts cited significant changes in 
supply-and-demand factors. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among them was a report that the Mexican government is nearing agreements 
with labor on terms for reopening the Cananea copper mining and processing 
center, which closed Aug. 21 due to alleged financial mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
The mine is capable of producing 160,000 tons of copper annually, about 3% of 
the world's total copper output. 
</P>
<P>
In precious metals trading on the Comex, gold settled $1.30 higher across the 
board, with October at $368.70 an ounce; silver was 0.2 to 0.4 cent higher, 
with December at $5.16 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Energy futures ended lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange in technically 
inspired selling after gaining initially on supply fears linked to the 
California earthquake. 
</P>

HOUSING STARTS DECLINE 5.2% TO 7-YEAR LOW 
</P>

<P>
New home construction fell by a surprising 5.2% in September to the lowest 
level since the depths of the 1982 recession, the Commerce Department said 
Wednesday, heightening concern about the health of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted September drop left housing starts at an annual rate of 
1.26 million units, the lowest since the October, 1982, rate of 1.17 million 
units. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I think it's scary. The number gave me a bit of a chill when I saw 
it," said economist Dave Seiders of the National Assn. of Home Builders. 
</P>
<P>
The department also increased its estimate of August's decline to show a 6.2% 
drop instead of the previously reported 5% decline. 
</P>
<P>
"Home building is getting down to recessionary levels," said economist Richard 
Peach of the Mortgage Bankers Assn. "But we remain confident that later this 
year and in 1990, we will see a modest recovery." 
</P>
<P>
The weak housing starts figure, a barometer of residential building in the 
United States, was the second piece of poor economic data this week. The 
government reported Tuesday that the nation's trade deficit rose by 31% to 
$10.8 billion in August to a peak for the year. 
</P>
<P>
Economists are now beginning to question the health of the current expansion, 
since industrial production has declined, construction has weakened and factory 
unemployment has risen, while exports have stalled. 
</P>
<P>
"Housing has traditionally been a part a leading indicator for the economy, 
weakening before the rest of the economy," Seiders said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Fed (Federal Reserve) now has room to ease interest rates," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The September decline left housing starts far below expectations by Wall Street 
economists, who projected a 2.2% rise to 1.38 million units. 
</P>
<P>
In a disturbing sign for future construction, building permits issued in 
September also fell by 2.4% in September, reversing a 3.7% August gain. 
</P>
<P>
Housing starts have been weak since last spring because of high interest rates, 
but they showed signs of strength in June and July. The summer gains then 
dwindled in August, and the decline accelerated in September. 
</P>
<P>
Long-term mortgage rates are now about 9.95%, compared to a high of 10.22% at 
the beginning of September, and that has spurred some home buyers to enter the 
real estate market. But interest rates have not fallen enough to renew building 
activity.

NO LIE -- JOE ISUZU'S CREATOR SOLD TO FRENCH; 
</P>
<P>
ADVERTISING: EUROCOM SA BECOMES NATION'S FIRST MULTINATIONAL PLAYER IN AGENCY 
TAKEOVER GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Don't look for Joe Isuzu to be fibbing in French any time soon. But a big chunk 
of the British-owned ad agency whose U.S. division created one of the ad 
world's best-known liars was purchased Wednesday by a giant French advertising 
conglomerate for $68.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Eurocom SA, one of the biggest advertising agencies in France, purchased a 40% 
interest in WCRS Group's worldwide advertising network. It previously owned 20% 
of WCRS, bringing its majority ownership of the company to a total of 60%. The 
agreement also gives Eurocom the right to buy the remaining 40% after six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The newly formed holding company, previously called WCRS Advertising Ltd., will 
be renamed Eurocom WCRS Della Femina Ball. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives us an investor to fund the growth we need in Europe," said Louise 
McNamee, president and chief operating officer of Della Femina, McNamee WCRS, 
the U.S. division of the company. Jerry Della Femina, the outspoken chairman of 
the U.S. ad agency, takes on the additional title of joint chairman of the 
European ad group along with Robin Wight, who is currently chairman. Della 
Femina was unavailable for comment Wednesday. At the same time, WCRS, which 
already owns a 50% interest in one of Europe's leading media buying companies, 
Carat Holding SA, purchased the remaining 50% of that company for about $319 
million. Analysts say this will greatly expand WCRS' fast-growing media buying 
presence in Europe, while at the same time decreasing its slower-growing 
business there as a creator of advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts are watching with keen interest as many of the largest acquisitions in 
the advertising world have recently had European roots. Over the past several 
years, British-based WPP Group purchased two of America's largest and 
best-known ad agencies, J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, it's another country heard from," said Alan Gottesman, analyst at the New 
York investment firm Paine Webber Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Gottesman said, "France has been one of the few countries with a 
developed and sophisticated advertising industry, but which has not produced a 
major, multinational player. 
</P>
<P>
"This doesn't make Eurocom the next Saatchi," said Gottesman, in reference to 
the rapid growth by acquisition of the giant British ad agency, Saatchi &amp; 
Saatchi, "but this sure makes them big." 
</P>
<P>
And as for WCRS, "It makes sense for them to be at the top in media buying 
rather than second in advertising," said Andrew Wallach, an analyst with the 
New York investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Media buying, especially the purchase of TV broadcast advertising, is a 
fast-growing business in Europe because of the recent deregulation of the TV 
industry in some European countries. Said Wallach, "Foreign entrepreneurs are 
showing some U.S. companies how to run advertising agencies."

NIXON FLAG? Even during Richard Nixon's darkest hours, Yorba Linda never 
forsook its most famous native son. . . . Now, the city that has honored the 
former president over the years with a library, park, highway, school and 
holiday is considering redesigning the city flag to picture the Nixon Library 
and birthplace (B3). . . . Says resident Mark Rhodes: "You've got to forgive 
the guy for being a crook. He's still intelligent."

DAMAGE: What about local freeways in a big quake? . . . A 7.3 temblor on the 
Newport-Inglewood fault would hit the San Diego Freeway hardest, geologists 
say, closing parts of it indefinitely. . . . Other heavy damage would be on 
MacArthur Boulevard, Pacific Coast Highway and the Costa Mesa and Garden Grove 
freeways (A11). But Anaheim Stadium should get by, officials believe. . . . Ten 
years ago, special bearings manufactured by Fluorocarbon Co. of Laguna Niguel 
were inserted at expansion joints between the Big A's sections, allowing 
movement without breakage. . . . Still, said a city official, "it's almost 
impossible to build an earthquake-proof building. You build them to be 
earthquake resistant."

HELPLESS: Beth and Dick Lundin of Newport Beach were having cocktails in the 
lobby of San Francisco's Hyatt Regency when the quake struck. "It just kept 
going," Dick Lundin said. "You thought it was going to stop, then it got 
worse." Not until 10 p.m. could guests re-enter the hotel, but they slept that 
night on the floor of the Grand Ballroom, using tablecloths as blankets. . . . 
"You are so helpless," Beth Lundin said. "It was the scariest thing in my 
life."

BAY AREA QUAKE; 
</P>
<P>
TIPS ON SURVIVAL -- DURING AND AFTER THE TREMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here are some frequently asked questions about earthquakes, and some answers 
provided by Times Staff Writer Mark Landsbaum. 
</P>
<P>
Question: What should you do if an earthquake hits while you are at home, work 
or school? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: As in all circumstances, remain calm. Get away from windows, mirrors 
and light fixtures, tall bookcases or China cases that may topple. Stand in a 
doorway or under a table or crouch against a solid wall. Get into a 
duck-and-cover position using sofa cushions or pillows to protect your head. Do 
not run outside. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What if a quake hits while you are in a car? 
</P>
<P>
A. Pull to the side of the road if possible and stop the car. Do not park under 
trees, light posts, signs, bridges or overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What should you do if you are outdoors? 
</P>
<P>
A. Get into the open, away from buildings, power lines and other sources of 
falling debris. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What should be done once the shaking stops? 
</P>
<P>
A. Check for injuries. If necessary, administer first aid. Do not move 
seriously injured persons unless they are in immediate danger. Keep the injured 
warm with blankets. Check utility lines and appliances for damage. Even the 
smallest sparks can cause explosions, so do not operate electrical switches or 
even a telephone if you smell gas. Do not eat or drink from open containers 
near broken glass. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Where can you find safe water to drink if service is cut off? 
</P>
<P>
A. Emergency water supplies can be found in water heaters, toilet tanks, melted 
ice cubes and canned vegetables. Water can be disinfected by first draining it 
through a clean cloth to remove solids, then by using a 5.25% household bleach 
solution. Use one drop to one quart for clear water and four drops to a quart 
for cloudy water. Water also can be purified by boiling. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What should you do if you smell gas after an earthquake? 
</P>
<P>
A. Know where your gas meter is and have an adjustable wrench for turning off 
the valve. Southern California Gas Co. advises that gas should be turned off 
only when there is an odor at the meter or at a connection, such as at the 
water heater. Never try to test for escaping gas with a lighter or flame 
because of a possible explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What plans can members of your household make? 
</P>
<P>
A. Everyone should know the safest places in the house, away from large panes 
of glass, heavy furniture, appliances or veneers such as fireplaces. Know the 
location of gas, electric and water main shut-off valves. Have a plan to 
reunite the family if members become separated. Know the location of the 
nearest fire station. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What can you do about structural flaws in your home? 
</P>
<P>
A. Check your foundation for cracks larger than 1/8-inch that indicate 
potential weakness. Check to see that your house is attached with sill bolts to 
the foundation. Make sure children's play areas are away from walls that lack 
sheathing and from walls of brick or masonry veneer without steel 
reinforcement. Seek the advice of an architect, engineer or local building 
official on needed repairs or strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What supplies should you have stored in your home for such an emergency? 
</P>
<P>
A. Items that should be stored in a barrel or trash can: Flashlight, portable 
radio, extra batteries, first-aid kit and handbook, two quarts of water for 
each family member; enough canned, powdered, freeze-dried or dehydrated foods 
to last one week; toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, towel, razor, any needed 
prescriptions, antiseptic cream, adhesive tape, alcohol, aspirin, bandages, 
gauze, gloves, plastic trash bags, aluminum foil, household bleach, tissues, 
pocketknife and can opener, mini-barbecue grill, matches, candles, Sterno 
canned heat, screwdriver, wrench and crowbar, sleeping bags, blankets, pencil 
and paper. Keep important papers and cash close by. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What supplies should you store in your car? 
</P>
<P>
A. Store these in a nylon, metal or plastic container in the trunk: first aid 
kit, 2 quarts of water, toothbrush, comb, soap, towel, razor, any needed 
prescriptions, antiseptic cream, aspirin, pocket knife, leather gloves, bottle 
opener, matches, flashlight with extra batteries, blanket, dehydrated or canned 
food, jumper cables, screwdriver and crowbar, plastic trash bags, pencil and 
paper and Sterno. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Any final suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
A. Cooperate with public safety efforts. Use telephones only to report 
emergency situations. Don't wander the streets or go in to danger areas unless 
your assistance is needed.

HOTEL'S 4TH FLOOR PROVIDED VIEW OF CHAOS, ASSISTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Anaheim Republican state Sen. John Seymour was dressing for a political 
function Tuesday afternoon in his room at San Francisco's El Drisco Hotel when 
the 6.9-magnitude temblor struck. The furniture began to move. Something 
crashed from a table. 
</P>
<P>
"The immediate thought was, 'My God, this is the heavy one,' " said Seymour, 
who was in the Bay Area city with his wife, Judy, for a fund-raiser for U.S. 
Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) " 'We're on the fourth floor and we've got to get 
out of here.' " 
</P>
<P>
But the couple discovered that the hotel was not only a safe spot, but also 
provided a view of both chaos and cooperation following the 5:04 p.m. temblor. 
From his vantage point in the hills of the Pacific Heights neighborhood, 
Seymour said the flames of the Marina district fire lit the sky. 
</P>
<P>
"It was eerie as darkness fell because (the rest of the city) was totally 
black. The only light you could see was the light of vehicles, the sirens 
going." 
</P>
<P>
Outside, people were scurrying. "I recall one woman running through the streets 
hollering, 'Papa! Papa!' I don't know if she ever found her father," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that history apparently was with him Tuesday because the night before, 
a taxi driver told him of El Drisco: " 'You should know that it is one of the 
few hotels that withstood the 1906 quake.' " RALPH FRAMMOLINO

ORANGE COUNTY FREEWAYS CALLED RELATIVELY SAFE; 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN: EXPERTS FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT THE SAFETY OF ELEVATED HIGHWAYS. BUT 
WITHOUT MODIFICATIONS, PILLARS AND COLUMNS APPEAR TO BE THE SYSTEM'S WEAK LINK.

<P>
Unlike in the Bay Area, where a double-deck freeway became a single tier in 
Tuesday's massive temblor, there are few places in Orange County where ribbons 
of concrete overlap and leave the roads vulnerable to collapse during a major 
earthquake, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But while most of Orange County's older freeway overpasses and other elevated 
structures have been retrofitted to minimize possible earthquake damage, the 
modifications will not be complete for about three more years, state highway 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Weidler, Caltrans deputy director for construction, operations and 
permits in Orange County, said the work remaining to be done involves 
reinforcement of the pillars or columns that support the concrete spans. 
</P>
<P>
It is that part of the structure -- the support pillars -- that appeared to 
have failed in the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway -- I-880 -- in Oakland, where 
more than 200 people are believed to have been crushed. The mile-long section 
of the Nimitz Freeway that collapsed was double-decked and the upper level fell 
onto the cars traveling on the lower level. 
</P>
<P>
"On balance, I feel fairly comfortable" about the safety of elevated freeway 
structures in Orange County, Weidler said. "I feel pretty good about what we 
have down here. . . . We have no viaducts, no double-decked structures -- 
nothing where there's a roadway up for a prolonged length." 
</P>
<P>
Weidler said, however, there are 488 bridges and overpasses in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have some freeway-to-freeway overpasses and connectors," he said. But he 
added that the modifications "are moving forward." 
</P>
<P>
Weidler said the county's largest interchange is between the cities of Santa 
Ana and Orange where three freeways come together -- the Santa Ana, the Orange 
and the Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than a dozen ramps connecting the three freeways, many winding 
like spaghetti under, over and around the others. 
</P>
<P>
The other major interchanges Weidler identified were the San Diego Freeway 
connections to the Santa Ana Freeway near El Toro and to the Newport Freeway 
near Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
Since the San Francisco and Bay Area earthquake, county officials also said 
Wednesday that they will be reviewing the earthquake protection built into 
several street bridges that pass over the Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Zaun, the county's director of public works, said there are 11 older 
bridges in particular that will be reinspected to be certain they are properly 
supported. 
</P>
<P>
He said the county has built 21 bridges over the river in the last 40 years, 16 
of which were done before more stringent earthquake construction standards were 
required in 1971.

Five of the 16 older bridges have since been retrofitted with additional 
support for earthquakes. He said he was uncertain whether the others lacked the 
support or did not require it, but he added that those bridges would be 
reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
He said he could not identify which 11 are to be reinspected. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans' Weidler said almost all of the county's freeways were built before 
the standards changed in 1971 and so most had to be retrofitted. He said the 
first phase -- which required the spans to be fitted more securely to the 
pillars -- has been completed. 
</P>
<P>
The second phase involves reinforcing the pillars. 
</P>
<P>
The other considerations for damage to freeways in an earthquake include the 
type of soil in which the structure is anchored and the location of the nearest 
fault. 
</P>
<P>
In a study prepared by local authorities about the effects of a major 
earthquake on the Newport-Inglewood fault that extends through Orange County, 
officials concluded that the greatest damage would be done to the freeways 
nearest the coast -- the Pacific Coast and Coast highways and the San Diego 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana Freeway, it said, should "provide an alternative north-south 
corridor east of the zone of high-intensity shaking." It also said there should 
be "numerous alternative surface streets which can be used to bypass damaged 
portions of freeways."

<P>
Granting 3% salary raises to nearly all city employees, the City Council on 
Tuesday adopted changes in job qualifications for about 100 positions in city 
hall and in the Capistrano Valley Water District. 
</P>
<P>
The changes in most cases resulted in upgrading job requirements, with a 
corresponding increase in salary level that did not cause any employees to lose 
pay, Assistant City Manager George Scarborough explained. 
</P>
<P>
City job descriptions are reviewed every five years for accuracy and are 
updated to incorporate additional duties and responsibilities performed by the 
employee, Scarborough said. 
</P>
<P>
The first version of revised job descriptions was presented to city employees 
three months ago and 33 descriptions were challenged in an appeal process. The 
contested positions were amended according to the employees' testimony, 
Scarborough said. 
</P>
<P>
The city employs 80 people and the water district, whose board of directors is 
the City Council, employs 23 people.

JAIL FOES TO SUBMIT WRITTEN OBJECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Laguna Niguel Community Council, which has spoken out for several weeks 
against the possible construction of a county jail branch in the area, is about 
to issue its objections officially in writing. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Wilson, president of the council, said Wednesday that a committee of the 
council is drafting arguments against a jail being situated at the South County 
Civic Center, Alicia Parkway at Crown Valley Parkway. The formal objections 
will be mailed to county government next week, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental impact report prepared for county government and dated Sept. 
15 listed the South County Civic Center in Laguna Niguel as one of 10 possible 
sites for a jail branch expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the county must receive comments for or against that EIR before an 
Oct. 31 county Planning Commission meeting. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have said that the EIR is only an updated version of a 
year-old report listing all possible county-owned land that might be used for a 
jail branch. Laguna Niguel was rejected as a site more than a year ago, and 
nothing has changed since then, according to county planning officials. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, however, said Laguna Niguel residents are less than reassured by the 
county denials. "For one thing, even though our council is the advisory arm to 
county government, we didn't learn about Laguna Niguel being listed as a jail 
site until we read about it in the newspaper," said Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
The residents of Laguna Niguel, an unincorporated area of about 40,000, will 
vote Nov. 7 on whether they want to become a city. Pro-cityhood leaders have 
said the jail site issue is another reason residents should vote for 
incorporation because a city would be able to fight off a county proposal 
better than an unincorporated area. The anti-cityhood forces have not addressed 
the issue. BILL BILLITER

ORGANIZER CANCELS BETTE DAVIS SERVICE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The organizer of a beachside memorial service for Bette Davis has canceled the 
event, saying that mourners of the late actress should send money to help 
victims of the San Francisco earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Laguna Beach resident Harry Moon said Wednesday that he decided to 
cancel the scheduled Friday memorial service as he watched television accounts 
of the 6.9 temblor that killed scores in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Moon had organized an informal service to be held on the shore, in the shadow 
of the bluff where Davis once lived. Davis, a one-time Laguna Beach resident, 
died at 81 on Oct. 6 in a French hospital. She had been suffering from breast 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Moon had initially asked residents and fans of the two-time Academy Award 
winner to send flowers in honor of Davis, who once starred in the Laguna Beach 
Pageant of the Masters summer festival. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that the donations to the Red Cross (for aid to earthquake victims) 
would be more in keeping with the spirit of Bette Davis," Moon said. "She was 
quite generous and giving to the poor and needy. I feel that her films at this 
time are a fitting legacy." JIM GOMEZ

EAST CITY'S GROWTH TO BE HEARING TOPIC 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Planning Commission will hold a public hearing tonight on the future 
development of the fast-growing east Orange area. 
</P>
<P>
The area in question, mostly vacant hillsides now but the possible future home 
of residential tracts, is bounded by Loma Ridge to the south, Irvine Park and a 
residential development to the north and west, and unincorporated land to the 
north and east. Irvine Lake sits in the middle of the area. 
</P>
<P>
If the area is annexed to the city, the population of Orange would increase by 
one-third. 
</P>
<P>
City planners and the Irvine Co. have been working on the East Orange General 
Plan for the last 3 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for development over the next 20 years of 7,110 acres of Irvine 
Co.-owned property. The planned community would include 12,350 housing units, 
along with businesses, schools, parks and a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing, set for 7 p.m., will be held in the community room at the main 
library branch at 101 N. Center St. Another hearing will be held Oct. 30 in the 
City Council chambers at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
After the Planning Commission hears public comment, it will make a 
recommendation to the City Council, which will consider the development plan in 
late November or early December, according to Vernon Jones, administrator of 
the city's community development division. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said construction will probably not begin for about two years. SHANNON

PANELISTS TO DEVELOP CHILD-CARE STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of community organizations and local businesses will be getting 
together in the next few months to talk about ways that child-care services can 
be improved in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted this week to hire a consultant to coordinate a "child 
care consortium" charged with developing a child-care strategy for Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The consultant, National Pediatric Support Services Inc., will organize 
consortium meetings, develop an informational booklet on child-care options, 
help employers with child-care assessments and write the consortium's 
child-care plan. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is scheduled to be completed in about four months. A $20,600 grant 
from the state Department of Education is paying for the program.

<P>
HE'S TOPS ON SKATEBOARD -- ; 
</P>
<P>
NO MEAN TRICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Listening to the calm, distinctly British speech of Don Brown, you might not 
believe that this mild-mannered 23-year-old is the same guy whose spectacular 
skateboard tricks won him the title of 1989 World Freestyle Champion. 
</P>
<P>
But seeing him perform a few of his flips, handstands and other tricks will 
quickly clear up any doubts. 
</P>
<P>
"I really just enjoy skateboarding," said Brown, a lanky, spiky-haired 
Huntington Beach resident who has been competing all over the world for nearly 
five years and who likes to do just about any kind of maneuver. "Variety 
helps," he said, "but I really don't mind what type it is. You just skate 
whatever comes in front of you." 
</P>
<P>
His tale is something of an American success story. Five years ago, the 
Brighton, England, native and a few friends crossed the Atlantic to get a 
vacationer's glimpse of America. Brown, who had sidewalk surfed since age 15, 
soon discovered the Huntington Beach skateboarding scene. And Vision Street 
Wear, his sponsor, found him soon after. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the good thing about America," said Brown: "You can do anything." 
</P>
<P>
That, for Brown, according to Vision spokeswoman Danna Black, means receiving 
royalties for the skateboard named after him, entering competitions under the 
company's sponsorship, and showing off his prowess at promotional public 
appearances such the one this month at Cal State Dominguez Hills for a new 
video game system. 
</P>
<P>
The world championship title, Brown's first, was earned at an international 
meet this summer in Munster, Germany, sponsored by American and European 
skateboarding associations. He competed against 30 others for the title in an 
event that participants say is the only one of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
Brown attributes some of his success to being in the right place at the right 
time -- that is, at a time when skateboarding had lost some of its trendiness 
and sponsors were looking for new talent. 
</P>
<P>
Skateboarding is not taken as seriously as some other sports, Brown said, 
because it does not require much formal training or organization. 
</P>
<P>
However, that's one of the things about it that Brown finds appealing. "It's 
not like a team sport. You can go do what you want, whenever you want," he 
said. Still, "that's the part where people don't take it like a real sport. . . 
. I think that if there was a lot of money in it, people would take it more 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Brown himself clearly takes it seriously enough. "He's a professional; this is 
his job," said Brad Fanshaw, promotions director at Vision Street Wear. 
</P>
<P>
And a job it is. He practices on his board every day, for up to seven hours. He 
will skate virtually any time and anywhere, with the focuses usually on 
developing new styles. New moves are easy to make, he says, requiring only a 
new board or body angle. "You pretty much just play around with your board or 
body motions, and it just works out." 
</P>
<P>
His contract with Vision Street Wear, which allows him to stay in the United 
States with a work visa, is renewed on an annual basis, so there is some 
pressure on him to stay on the cutting edge. 
</P>
<P>
Says Brown, whose career provides him with "just about enough" to pay his 
bills, "being your job, it sometimes takes the fun out of skateboarding. But I 
can't complain too much. It's a good life I'm having." 
</P>
<P>
In a sport whose dangers are all too apparent, Brown has been remarkably 
fortunate, having had only one serious accident, which required knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
But neither the prospect of injury nor his future in a sport usually associated 
with teen-agers worries him. 
</P>
<P>
"There're so many things one can do, it seems pointless to put everything into 
one goal," he said about his post-skating plans. "I'll just take it as it 
comes." LISA MASCARO

CONTESTED PLAN FOR 111 HOMES DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents concerned about increased traffic on Placentia Avenue and a new 
subdivision near their homes got a reprieve from the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The council rejected a proposal to build 111 homes on the northwest corner of 
Placentia Avenue and Rolling Hills Drive. The plan also called for Placentia 
Avenue to be extended north to Imperial Highway, which area residents feared 
would bring more commuter traffic past their homes. 
</P>
<P>
The council majority said the subdivision proposed by Unocal Land &amp; 
Development Co. would not fit into the city's plan to develop the area into a 
"greenbelt." 
</P>
<P>
"We're extremely pleased," said John McNaughton, 47, a resident who helped lead 
a group of about 150 neighbors in lobbying against the proposal. "It says they 
have to abide by the . . . rules of the city." 
</P>
<P>
The council vote was 4 to 1, with Councilman Richard C. Ackerman dissenting. 
The 111 homes are not that many more than would be allowed with the greenbelt 
plan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
That plan allows Unocal to build up to 90 units on the 31 acres, said Paul 
Dudley, Fullerton's director of development services. 
</P>
<P>
The residents' victory Wednesday may be temporary. Council members also 
indicated that they might still allow Placentia Avenue to link with Imperial 
Highway once a project is approved for the land. That extension probably will 
be part of any future project submitted by Unocal, Dudley said. 
</P>
<P>
The road extension has been on the city's master plan of roads since 1961. It 
also would help ease traffic for residents living along neighboring Kraemer 
Boulevard and Associated Road, Councilman Don Bankhead said. 
</P>
<P>
If the road must be built, McNaughton said, it should wind through the future 
residential development to discourage its use as a thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal hasn't decided yet how it will react to the council's rejection of its 
111-home project, company spokesman Barry Lane said. TOM McQUEENEY

Two brush fires blackened at least 250 acres of Camp Pendleton Wednesday, a 
Marine Corps spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The first fire was reported at 11:15 a.m. in San Mateo Canyon just south of 
Orange County and burned 200 acres in the northern part of the base and a 
portion of the Cleveland National Forest, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The second fire broke out at about 4:30 p.m. and had burned about 50 acres near 
the Camp Horno area of Camp Pendleton close to San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in either blaze, and officials don't know how the fires were 
started. A Marine Coprs spokesman said late Wednesday night that firefighters 
were still battling both blazes.

DRUG NAMES

<TEXT>
<P>
I love it! Finally an honest name for a drug -- Croak ("Potent Form of Speed 
Could Be Drug of '90s," Oct. 8). I lost a lot of friends many years ago through 
drug use. I used to wonder why people give drugs cutesy names, like Blue Cheer 
and Orange Sunshine for LSD. And what's so cheerful about being in the psych 
ward at Metropolitan State Mental Hospital? Sunshine is something you don't see 
much of behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
Let's dump these cute names.

JERUE PLANS TO CULMINATE COMEBACK AGAINST SAINTS 
</P>

<P>
Mark Jerue's football obituary was written long ago, yet he refused to let it 
go to publication. 
</P>
<P>
Jerue has had a nice six-year career with the Rams. He was a starter, at times, 
at inside linebacker and made 109 tackles in 1986. He could have let it go at 
that, but didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, Dr. Clarence Shields opened Jerue's left knee for the third time 
in two years, and what he did inside with his scalpel was meant to get Jerue 
walking again, not playing again. 
</P>
<P>
There were four holes the size of quarters, where cartilage had worn through to 
the bone. 
</P>
<P>
Explained Jerue: "They drill little holes into the bone and hope that the bone 
marrow comes back up and fills in like putty." 
</P>
<P>
Shields told Jerue his chances of playing again were less than 50-50. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Jerue still couldn't run 10 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, the Rams moved Jerue to the active roster, and he's expected to play 
Sunday against the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
Some feel what happened in between defies medical reason and can best be 
described as a rehabilitation for the ages. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," Coach John Robinson said, "they don't play music. It's not 
uplifting like it is in the movies. It's hard, it's dirty, it's ugly and it's 
slow. This guy's a little bit of a nut -- I don't say that critically at all. 
It's very complimentary to how hard he's willing to work for it." 
</P>
<P>
Jerue, working closely with Ram strength trainer Garrett Giemont, set out last 
spring to confound the experts. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him from the start of this rehab that he will come back and play," 
Giemont said, "that we are not going to be denied. I told him there will come a 
day when he will look at me and say, 'I'm tired of this, I'm ready to play.' 
Basically, he did exactly that a couple of weeks ago on the football field, and 
that was a nice day." 
</P>
<P>
Jerue, who could play for as many as 20 snaps against the Saints, joins a 
depleted Ram linebacking unit that has indefinitely lost Fred Strickland to a 
severe ankle sprain. 
</P>
<P>
Jerue, a workout warrior in healthy times, even doubted whether a comeback was 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I never really knew if I'd make it or not, but I never thought about giving 
up," he said. "I wasn't going to quit. I've just got to thank Gie(mont) again 
for telling me that it can be done." 
</P>
<P>
Giemont said Jerue's work ethic was the difference between playing again and 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep attendance records in the off-seasons, and Mark is always right there," 
Giemont said. "As a matter of fact, if I had to break it down, Mark Jerue in 
the past five years has had the greatest attendance in the off-season, of just 
work, period." 
</P>
<P>
No doubt, it has paid off. 
</P>
<P>
"The story's not complete until I can put a few games together," Jerue 
cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, he went through Wednesday's practice with no pain. Defensive coordinator 
Fritz Shurmur says Jerue has lost none of his quickness. 
</P>
<P>
"It's miraculous that he's back and doing what he's doing, no question about 
that," Shurmur said. "I think that's a tribute to him, Giemont and a couple of 
guys saying the odds are long . . . but we're going to beat it. And they did." 
</P>
<P>
Jerue was more encouraged by Wednesday's full-contact workout. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd take today for the rest of the year if I could keep going like that," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
How has the shock of Monday night's last-minute loss to Buffalo affected the 
Rams' younger players? Was it as tough to swallow as, say, UCLA losing to USC? 
</P>
<P>
No way, a former Bruin said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a heart-breaking feeling, one of those end-of-the year feelings," 
cornerback Darryl Henley said of losing to the Trojans last season. "This loss 
hurts, and it was a long plane ride, but we still got 10 games left. You almost 
have to automatically rebound right away." 
</P>
<P>
Henley said the young Rams have responded well. 
</P>
<P>
"You just wanna kind of follow the older guys," he said. "And you usually 
respond with the same mood, the same tone as they respond. And they've been 
pretty good about it." 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Pete Holohan is one who's trying to lead by example, though he admits 
it hasn't been easy. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of leaves a sick feeling in your stomach the whole way home," Holohan 
said of the loss. "You feel rotten. I'm sure it's dramatic for the young guys 
in the sense that it just goes to show in this league, one minute you're ahead 
and the next minute you're not, so you'd better not take anything for granted. 
You'd just better go out there and play." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
To make room for Mark Jerue on the roster, the team placed rookie cornerback 
Alfred Jackson on injured reserve with a groin injury. The Rams also exercised 
their option on rookie linebacker Brian Smith, who has been on injured reserve 
with a wrist injury. Under new rules, Smith had to be either activated, waived 
or returned to practice this week. Smith, the second-round pick from Auburn, 
will remain on IR and resume practicing, forcing the team to cut one member of 
its developmental squad. . . . Flipper Anderson is averaging 32.8 yards per 
reception, 10 more yards per catch than league runner-up Mervyn Fernandez of 
the Raiders. How remarkable is the statistic? "Thirty-two yards per catch?" 
Coach John Robinson said. "That's further than our net punting is." He's right. 
Punter Dale Hatcher is averaging 31.4 net yards per punt. In fact, Anderson's 
average is better than 10 net punting averages around the league. . . . As of 
Wednesday evening, about 5,000 tickets remained for Sunday's game against New 
Orleans at Anaheim Stadium. In order for the local television blackout to be 
lifted, the game must sell out by 1 p.m. today. . . . More on Jerue: He's had 
three operations on the left knee, two during the 1987 season. He started the 
first 12 games at inside linebacker last season before the pain finally forced 
him out of the lineup. . . . Further X-rays of Fred Strickland's left ankle 
showed no break, though he was walking on crutches Wednesday.

TONIGHT'S FOOTBALL GAMES;

<P>
SADDLEBACK ON TOP OF ITS GAME AFTER TOUGH NONLEAGUE SCHEDULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Finding teams to play hasn't been hard for Saddleback High School football 
Coach Jerry Witte. Finding teams that don't play hard, well, that's another 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1984 and '87, the Roadrunners rolled up an impressive 42-8-1 record. 
The result was one Central Conference championship and a virtual boycott by 
some of the lesser programs in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Which is why the Roadrunners' 3-3 record going into their second Sea View 
League game may be a little deceiving. Saddleback (1-0 in league play) plays 
Corona del Mar (4-2, 0-1) at 7:30 tonight at Newport Harbor High School. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past we were able to get a couple teams that were struggling, but after 
the success we had it was tougher to schedule games," said Witte, whose team is 
coming off a 14-7 victory over Tustin in its league opener. "So we've ended up 
playing better schools, some of which are out of Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Already this season, Saddleback has played Ocean View, Santa Ana, El Rancho and 
Serra. All four appear playoff-bound. In fact, the combined record of the 
Roadrunners' nonleague opponents is 21-8-1. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Corona del Mar and Estancia -- Sea View League favorites -- 
were beating up on lesser competition. The Sea Kings and Eagles each played 
only one team during their nonleague seasons that has a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
They also met each other last Friday night, with Estancia defeating Corona del 
Mar, 16-3. 
</P>
<P>
"The main reason you don't want to play a tough schedule is because you don't 
want to get beat up before league (play)," Witte said. "But you do benefit from 
it, if you can survive physically." 
</P>
<P>
The Roadrunners have remained healthy and have improved each week. After losing 
to Ocean View (24-7) and Santa Ana (21-0), they have won three of their past 
four. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback has allowed only 29 points in its past four games, including a 22-7 
loss to undefeated Serra. 
</P>
<P>
The experience of playing better competition has benefited the young 
Roadrunners, who returned only four starters this season. Saddleback starts six 
juniors, who were part of a 9-1 sophomore team last season, including 
quarterback Paul Delgado. 
</P>
<P>
The Roadrunners' offense has scored only 59 points in six games, but Witte says 
it has improved in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, Paul would make a good read, but the receiver would run the wrong 
route or drop the ball," Witte said. "And the running game wasn't going 
anywhere because we only had one starter back on the offensive line. Now 
everyone is in sync." 
</P>
<P>
Defense has been the strong point, as safety David Morris and defensive lineman 
Kelly Jackson have helped the younger players develop. Both were starters last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been a stabilizing influence," Witte said. "And everything seems to be 
stabilizing now." 
</P>
<P>
The same thing happened last season, when the Roadrunners played a nonleague 
schedule that included three eventual league champions and another team that 
reached the playoffs. They played three teams from outside the county, 
Dominguez, Serra and Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Saddleback finished with a 2-2-1 league record and tied for second with 
Estancia. The Roadrunners defeated La Habra in the first round of the Division 
VI playoffs, then lost to Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we snuck up on some people in league," Witte said. "Especially since 
we played so many teams from out of the area. Other coaches didn't know how to 
evaluate those games. They didn't get a true line on us." 
</P>
<P>
Witte hopes the same is true this season. He said his team has been preparing 
for three seasons -- nonleague, Corona del Mar and Estancia. 
</P>
<P>
Nonleague is over and the Sea Kings are tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"They're probably scared because we won last week, and I know we're scared 
because they lost," Witte said. "But our kids have been getting ready for this 
one all season." 
</P>
<P>
In other games tonight: 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park vs. Santa Ana at Santa Ana Stadium, Cypress vs. Los Alamitos at 
Veterans Stadium, Garden Grove vs. Pacifica at Bolsa Grande High, Santiago vs. 
Kennedy at Western High, Savanna at Valencia, Costa Mesa vs. Laguna Hills at 
Mission Viejo High.

O.C. BUSINESSES ASSESS EFFECTS OF BAY AREA QUAKE 
</P>

Although Orange County did not physically experience the catastrophic 
earthquake that shook the San Francisco area Tuesday, the temblor has made 
itself felt in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
A number of Orange County businesses have facilities and employees in the Bay 
Area and others have clients in the stricken communities. 
</P>
<P>
While communications with their offices in the affected areas were spotty at 
best Wednesday, officials at a variety of Orange County firms said that their 
Bay Area operations appear to have escaped serious damage and that there were 
no reports of employee injuries. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time the firms worked the phones to assess the impact, they also 
launched efforts to assist with the rescue and recovery work. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach-based Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. introduced a streamlined 
policy loan program that will enable clients in the Bay Area to borrow against 
their life insurance policies and receive the money within 24 hours instead of 
waiting the usual four-day period, company spokesman Andrew Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor Daniel, the international engineering and construction firm based in 
Irvine, sent five structural engineers to San Francisco Wednesday morning to 
assist in determining whether homes, office buildings and other structures are 
safe. They are among 30 Southern California engineers participating in a 
volunteer program of the Structural Engineering Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
Company spokeswoman Deborah Land said Fluor Daniel has about 300 employees in a 
regional office in Redwood City, just south of San Francisco. She said that 
there were no reported injuries but that the building was closed Wednesday 
because of minor damage. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other engineering and heavy construction firms, Fluor saw its stock 
price rise Wednesday as investors bet that the major California construction 
companies will benefit from the billions of dollars that will be spent on 
repairing the damage caused by the 6.9 quake. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor's stock rose 75 cents a share to $33.38. 
</P>
<P>
While Fluor was the only Orange County company whose stock was affected by the 
earthquake, it wasn't the only one to feel a direct impact. 
</P>
<P>
Two fast-food chains based in Orange County -- Carl's Jr. and Taco Bell -- 
reported that several of their restaurants in the Bay Area were damaged or 
forced to close because of power outages. Both companies said they were working 
with the American Red Cross to provide food to shelters and rescue workers. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton-based Beckman Instruments said a scientific instruments plant in Palo 
Alto and a medical diagnostic kit manufacturing facility in San Jose were shut 
down Wednesday as a result of the quake, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Bergen Brunswig, the Orange-based pharmaceuticals distributor, operates a major 
distribution center that serves hospitals and clinics throughout the Bay Area. 
Bob Dominguez, regional vice president, said the center sustained only minimal 
damage and was "getting orders out on time." 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problems we are having is that there is a telephone gridlock and 
it is difficult to get around because a lot of streets are closed and normal 
delivery routes are damaged," Dominguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, two Orange County-based residential builders with sizable operations 
in the Bay Area said they escaped significant damage. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Foell, president of Standard Pacific, a Costa Mesa residential 
construction firm, said none of the 450 homes his company is developing in the 
quake area were damaged, including homes in a subdivision in Scotts Valley, 
just two miles from the epicenter. "We lost some roof tiles, but that was all," 
Foell said. 
</P>
<P>
And Dick Randall, president of the William Lyon Co. in Newport Beach, said that 
several of the company's Bay Area projects sustained minor cosmetic damage but 
that no structural problems have been discovered.

IRAQ GAINS NEW CLOUT WITH SAUDI ARABIA OIL TERMINAL; 
</P>
<P>
MIDEAST: ADDITIONAL CAPACITY WOULD ALLOW COUNTRY TO FLOOD THE MARKET AND SEIZE 
CUSTOMERS FROM ITS NEIGHBORS, BUT OFFICIALS SAY THEY WON'T DO THAT.

MOAAJEZ, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein, already a formidable military 
power after eight years of war with Iran, took a significant stride this week 
toward developing a new oil weapon with the opening of a crude-oil terminal on 
Saudi Arabia's Red Sea coast. 
</P>
<P>
The terminal here puts Iraq in a position to triple its current crude-oil 
exports through Saudi Arabia, a route chosen during the Persian Gulf war years 
after Iranian planes and artillery in 1980 bombed and burned Iraqi ports, oil 
tanks and loading terminals all along the southern frontier that joins the 
longtime belligerents. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the size of Iraq's oil reserves and its production and export 
capabilities, oil industry officials, Western diplomats and other Arab 
governments have privately expressed concern that Iraq now has the ability to 
wield considerable power in world oil markets, giving it economic and political 
leverage in the region and a role that only Saudi Arabia claimed in the past. 
</P>
<P>
While many oil-producing countries are struggling to maintain oil production at 
levels that support their national budgets, Iraq not only is sitting on a huge 
pool of oil -- and more is being found each year -- but its ability to pump it 
out of the ground and get it to market also has grown dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
The increase of Iraq's oil power raises the question of how it will use it, 
according to oil industry executives in the region. Will it turn up its 
production and seek to take away customers, or market share, from other 
countries by offering discounted prices? 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials say no, but there is little trust these days in the oil 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
The sprawling Iraqi Petroleum Co. terminal and tank farm here loom out of the 
desert haze 150 miles north of Jeddah on an unmarked stretch of shoreline. 
There are no signs or national flags fluttering in the stiff westerly wind that 
whips through the security barriers of chain-link and barbed-wire fences 
stretched over floodlighted concrete pillars. 
</P>
<P>
The terminal is fed by an oil pipeline that crosses 900 miles of Arabian desert 
from well fields near Basra and Zubair in southern Iraq. The first tanker to 
call here, the Al-Qadassiyeh, finished loading Monday and was to depart for 
customers in Europe and the United States this week. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Iraqi technicians and foreign construction companies are working at 
breakneck speed to repair Iraq's offshore oil-loading terminals at the northern 
end of the gulf. By 1990, Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim Chalabi 
predicted recently, Iraq could be pumping up to 6 million barrels a day of 
crude oil onto the world markets, more than double its current volume. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Iraq's crude-oil shipments to the Red Sea have traveled through the 
Saudi pipeline system to a terminal at Yanbu. The previous output of 500,000 
barrels a day through the Saudi line will jump to 1.65 million barrels a day 
through the new Iraqi system. 
</P>
<P>
The view of Iraq as a country seeking to strengthen all of its regional 
alliances in anticipation of future competition with Iran provides what one oil 
company executive described as "the ultimate deterrent" against Iraqi 
belligerency in OPEC or in bilateral relations with the Arab neighbors who were 
critical allies during the war. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq is not trying to make enemies in the Arab world, quite the contrary," 
noted a Western ambassador in the region. 
</P>
<P>
As Iraq has toed the line on production, some of the smaller sheikdoms along 
the gulf, such as Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, have been pumping all 
out, totally disregarding the OPEC quotas assigned to them. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the world's demand for oil has soaked up this excess production. But it 
has only raised the prospect that other OPEC members might abandon the quota 
system too in the quest for new customers and revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq has demonstrated -- in part with the opening of the terminal here -- that 
it would be able to flood the market to seize more customers from its 
neighbors, but Iraqi officials say they harbor nothing but good intentions. 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to hold to the quota, and we will press the others to hold to 
their quotas also," Oil Minister Chalabi told reporters in Baghdad.

Orange National Bancorp, the parent company of Orange National Bank in Orange, 
posted net income of $300,187 for the third quarter, down 19% from last year's 
third-quarter earnings of $372,274. Quarterly revenue rose 20% to $4.2 million 
this year from $3.5 million last year. For the first nine months, the company 
reported record net income of $1 million, a 14% increase over $881,000 in 
earnings for the same period last year. Revenue for the period rose 27% to 
$12.2 million this year from $9.6 million last year. Orange National's assets 
at the end of September grew 10% to $160 million from $146 million a year 
earlier. Wayne F. Miller, the company's president, attributed the lower 
quarterly earnings to the bank's decision to add $225,000 to its loan loss 
reserve, primarily to cover possible future losses in its business leasing 
operation.

TEMBLOR LEADS TO LOOK AT O.C. ARTS CENTERS; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: OFFICIALS OF SOME ARTS ORGANIZATIONS SAY THEIR CONTINGENCY PLANS ARE 
HOLDING UP, BUT OTHERS SAY THEIR POLICIES MAY BE EVALUATED.

The San Francisco Ballet, which made its local debut Tuesday night at Orange 
County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa less than three hours after the Bay 
Area's 6.9 temblor, anticipates no change in casting or programming for the 
remainder of its engagement, company officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course the company has been concerned," said Helgi Tomasson, artistic 
director of the 65-member troupe, in a prepared statement. "But throughout last 
evening and this morning, we have been able to make contact with friends and 
family and we are reassured. Like the city itself, we will go on -- and we will 
dance." 
</P>
<P>
The troupe's local seven-performance run ends Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
According to general manager Joyce Moffatt, the company's downtown San 
Francisco headquarters -- which house its school, administrative -- suffered no 
structural damage in the quake. The facility was built six years ago to 
"exacting earthquake specifications," said Moffatt, who traveled here with the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen young dance-school students spent Tuesday night at the facility, 
company officials said. A neighborhood hotel fed them dinner, and the students 
left for home this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco War Memorial Opera House, where the company performs its 
resident seasons, is a city facility, company officials said, and it has been 
closed until city engineers can determine whether or how much damage it 
sustained. 
</P>
<P>
The company is "grateful to audience members and the community for the 
outpouring of concern and support," the statement says, and it requests that 
Orange County residents who want to help direct their inquiries to the American 
Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
As for the safety of buildings in the Orange County arts community, Performing 
Arts Center President Thomas R. Kendrick said in a prepared statement that the 
Center "is new and was specifically designed to incorporate the latest research 
and technology for earthquake resistance." A 5.0 quake centered off Malibu 
struck last Jan. 18 in the midst of an opera performance, but the Center 
reported no damage. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of other county arts venues reported various degrees of preparedness 
for a quake of the magnitude that struck San Francisco, which was many times 
stronger than quakes felt in Orange County earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of those two temblors -- a 4.6 shaker centered in Newport in 
April and the quake off Malibu -- some arts facilities stepped up their plans 
for responding to earthquakes or other natural disasters, while others were 
less specific about their natural-disaster procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, situated near the Newport-Inglewood 
fault, have taken several steps since the April shaker, although, museum 
spokeswoman Maxine Gaiber said, not a single artwork was lost to that "sharp 
jolt." 
</P>
<P>
The museum was built in 1977 and satisfied the current earthquake-safety 
standards, Gaiber said. 
</P>
<P>
A 1989 grant of about $5,000 from the National Endowment for the Arts was 
recently used to improve storage facilities where the museum keeps most of its 
1,800-piece collection of sculpture, paintings, photographs and other works, 
Gaiber said. Most of the grant went for work to anchor all containers and 
cabinets to the walls, to buy protective netting to drape over racks where 
sculpture is stored, and to line shelving units with soft materials, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The museum staff also makes periodic reviews of its emergency procedures, she 
said, and associate director Jane Piasecki is active in the community Newport 
Beach Emergency Disaster Program, which is concerned with all types of 
disasters. 
</P>
<P>
She added that artworks on display at the museum are always secured by bolts or 
cables to protect them -- not just in the event of an earthquakes, but from the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
"We are confident we've done all we can do" to be prepared for a major quake, 
Gaiber said. 
</P>
<P>
The 71-year-old Laguna Art Museum, which has suffered no quake damage so far, 
was brought up to current building codes for earthquake safety when it 
underwent a $2.2-million renovation in the mid '80s, spokeswoman Nancy Coop 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The museum also recently installed a new storage system designed to protect its 
3,000-piece collection from general wear and tear, she said. There is an 
emergency plan for staff and visitors, Coop said, but she added: "I'm not 
familiar with it." 
</P>
<P>
As for the artworks on display in galleries, Coop said that if the structure is 
protected by earthquake building codes, all works inside should be. But "if 
there was a sculpture on a pedestal, for example," she said, "that could be in 
jeopardy. The entire pedestal could topple." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for each of the county's three largest theater troupes said Wednesday 
that their buildings comply with earthquake-safety construction codes. 
</P>
<P>
"If a quake happens during a performance, our house and stage managers also 
have a detailed evacuation plan," said Cristofer Gross of South Coast Repertory 
in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The SCR building, which opened in 1978, includes the 507-seat Mainstage 
auditorium and the 161-seat Second Stage. Gross said the plant has a backup 
power generator, that the maintenance department has a plan to shut off water 
should pipes burst, and that there is no gas outlet in the building. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport quake in April happened during a special matinee performance (of 
Shaw's "You Never Can Tell"), he said, and the safety systems were not needed 
then. There was no damage to the building, Gross said, although the housings of 
several overhead lights were shaken loose during the performance. Safety chains 
prevented the lights' falling into the audience, Gross said. The lead actor, 
Tom Harrison, told the audience not to panic, and the show resumed a few 
minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Playhouse business manager Jody Davidson said that the 418-seat Moulton 
Theatre, which opened in Laguna Beach in 1968, meets all building-code 
requirements and that its battery-operated emergency lights are inspected every 
two weeks. She said that there has never been a quake during a performance but 
that should there be such an event, the staff would direct the audience to 
evacuate the building through well-marked exits. 
</P>
<P>
The Moulton sustained no damage from the Newport quake, Davidson said, but the 
5.9 Whittier quake in October, 1987, shook some plaster loose. 
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't believe this building was safe, I wouldn't be working here," she 
said. "You're talking to someone who is so terrified of earthquakes that I 
drive around with three days' (worth) of earthquake-emergency supplies in her 
car." 
</P>
<P>
The Grove Shakespeare Festival, which operates two city-owned theaters in 
Garden Grove, has "an evacuation plan provided by the city but nothing 
specifically formulated beyond that," artistic director Thomas F. Bradac said. 
</P>
<P>
The 512-seat outdoor amphitheater and the 178-seat indoor Gem Theatre both meet 
code regulations, Bradac said. The Gem, originally built in the late '20s, 
survived the 6.3 Long Beach earthquake of 1933 with no damage, he said. The Gem 
underwent a major renovation in 1979. The amphitheater was built in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
As far as how an earthquake might be handled at the county's major rock and pop 
concert facilities go, "I was thinking about that last night as I was watching 
the news," said Matt Curto, director of operations for the Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre. "We have an emergency generator which would pop on and help with 
lighting." 
</P>
<P>
Curto said that the house lights -- there are 27 1,000-watt lights -- would 
come on with emergency power. "In conjunction with Staff Pro," the security 
company contracted for the amphitheater, "and their expertise, I'm confident 
they would get the people out in an orderly manner." Curto said that his main 
concern would be whether the stage scaffolding would stand up. He said he would 
have to consult with Joe Berry, the amphitheater stage manager, on matters 
relating to the supports and to any precautions specifically for earthquakes.

BAY AREA QUAKE: THE BREAKING STORY; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: NBC BROADCASTS WERE LIMITED BY A LOSS OF POWER AND THE LACK OF A 
BACKUP GENERATOR AT ITS AFFILIATE STATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
NBC, the TV network that brought the nation some of its first dramatic coverage 
of the Whittier earthquake two years ago, came in last with the least during 
Tuesday's devastating San Francisco temblor because its Bay Area affiliate had 
no power source and no backup generator. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting atop Cathedral Hill, about five blocks from San Francisco City Hall, 
KRON-TV was unable to get pictures of the 6.9 killer quake on the air until 7 
p.m., nearly two hours after it struck. As a direct result, the San Francisco 
NBC affiliate was also unable to feed the nation's top-rated network, leaving 
Tom Brokaw and other NBC affiliates, including KNBC-TV Channel 4 in Los 
Angeles, at the mercy of secondary sources. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost all power," KRON news director Al Goldstein, a three-year veteran of 
Bay Area broadcast news, said Wednesday. "We couldn't transmit and we could not 
receive anything from any remote unit." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Tom Capra, KNBC news director, said that KRON's computer system was 
down for about an hour and the station was even cut off from routine news wire 
services, such as Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
"We were FAXing them wire stories about the quake," Capra said. 
</P>
<P>
During and immediately after the 5:04 p.m. shaker, ABC and its 
owned-and-operated San Francisco outlet, KGO-TV, took advantage of their 
position as the World Series network by flashing helicopter and Goodyear blimp 
shots of the devastation to their TV audiences. In Los Angeles, KABC-TV Channel 
7 took full advantage of the feeds, making "Eyewitness News" live up to the 
full implications of its name. 
</P>
<P>
CBS affiliate KPIX-TV had its own visuals and commentary within 30 minutes. 
Though the transmission cracked and flashed on and off, KCBS-TV Channel 2 in 
Los Angeles filled much of its airtime following the first two hours after the 
quake with KPIX video feeds. 
</P>
<P>
But KRON and its sister station in Los Angeles, KNBC, failed to get in on any 
of the early action. 
</P>
<P>
"We got killed by KABC because they had pictures first," KNBC's Capra said 
Wednesday. "Our affiliate was off the air and that was a bad break for us." 
</P>
<P>
Some KRON footage began to appear on CNN and other NBC stations at about 6:42 
p.m. -- but only because the San Francisco office of NBC's Sacramento 
affiliate, KCRA-TV, picked up KRON's then-weak signal and, unbeknownst to KRON 
officials, put it up on a satellite feed. 
</P>
<P>
KRON's problems could have been greatly reduced, if not prevented, a former 
employee charged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them, 'When the big one comes, we're going to need an emergency 
generator and we're not going to have it,' " former KRON news director Mike 
Ferring said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferring, who left the station nearly two years ago and is now news director at 
the ABC affiliate in Sacramento, KOVR-TV, told The Times that he and other news 
executives had warned KRON's owner, Chronicle Broadcasting of San Francisco, 
Inc., of the need for a backup power supply for its four-story building on Van 
Ness Ave. year after year. 
</P>
<P>
"They did not have emergency power and never have had it," he said. "Every year 
it went into the proposed budget and every year it went out because they said 
we were supplied with power from two trunk towers and there was no need for a 
backup." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the other two network affiliates, which are located in free-standing 
buildings near the Embarcadero center in San Francisco's financial district, 
KRON is located further inland in an area that, ironically, did not receive 
much of the brunt of the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
"What we did was start ferrying tapes in right away," KRON's Goldstein said. 
"We stayed very competitive once we hit the air." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, that wasn't until after 7 p.m., after nightfall. KRON ran into 
its second big headache at that point: no light for pictures. 
</P>
<P>
"Where there were fires and headlights . . . and there were lots of headlights 
. . . we could show (the devastation)," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
But the helicopters used by KRON, as well as the other Bay Area stations, are 
not equipped for extensive night time video coverage, according to former Bay 
Area newsman Tom Vacar. 
</P>
<P>
"None of their helicopters are equipped with the million candlepower lights 
that we have down in Los Angeles," said Vacar, who is now a reporter for KNX-AM 
(1070). "One of the great advantages of working at a station in Southern 
California is that the stations do have lighting, so you can shoot after dark." 
</P>
<P>
Vacar, who maintains an apartment in the devastated Marina area of San 
Francisco, was dispatched to the Bay Area along with KNX helicopter pilot Bob 
Terr less than five minutes after the quake, according to KNX news director Bob 
Simms. Terr, who also had a video camera crew on board, flew up along the 
Interstate 5 freeway, landing at Crissy Field in the center of the San 
Francisco just before 9 p.m. Ironically, L.A.-based Vacar was able to deliver 
on-the-spot radio reports to his KNX audience 500 miles to the south before 
KRON could go on the air with its first videotape. 
</P>
<P>
KOVR's Ferring said that KRON did not have an earthquake contingency plan while 
he worked there and he didn't believe they had developed one since he left. 
KRON's Goldstein said the station did have one but was unable to put it into 
effect. As of 3 p.m. Wednesday, KRON's studios were still on emergency power 
supplied by a portable generator. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a feeling there isn't a helluva lot you can do to prepare for it, no 
matter how many contingencies you've got," Ferring aid. "At one point, in the 
mid-'80s, there was an attempt to get Bay Area broadcasters to get together and 
come up with a plan to handle this kind of major disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Like the backup generator that Ferring had consistently fought for at KRON, the 
quake coverage master plan never came into being. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a foolish competition that goes on (in broadcast journalism)," Vacar 
said. "There's always been talk about pool reporting during a disaster, but 
that's all it's ever been: talk. When there's a bona fide disaster, people are 
far more interested in the breadth and the depth of the the thing than who got 
it first." 
</P>
<P>
Vacar worked as an on-camera reporter for three years at KCBS-TV in Los Angeles 
as well as six years at KGO-TV in San Francisco before switching to KNX two 
years ago. There is a different between the two media, he said. "Egos are out 
of the way in radio. All they want is the news. On television, there's a 
self-defeating competitiveness where everything depends on how it looks. That's 
something that you just don't find in radio."

'THINGS IMPOSSIBLE': DARING, DIFFERENT KIND OF LECTURE; 
</P>
<P>
PERFORMANCE ART: THE FCC MIGHT NOT APPROVE OF WHAT JULIE LAZAR WILL SHOW AS ART 
CREATED FOR TELEVISION AND RADIO TONIGHT AT IRVINE FINE ARTS CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who shows up at the Irvine Fine Arts Center tonight expecting a 
slide-lecture on the past and present state of performance art is in for a 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
So is the Federal Communications Commission, perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, I was asked to talk about what's going on in performance art and 
what's new and what's good," said guest lecturer Julie Lazar, who has something 
else in mind for the 7 p.m. event. 
</P>
<P>
While performance art can mean almost anything these days, her presentation 
will focus less on what is "known as performance art per se," and more on what 
she currently finds most interesting and innovative: art created for television 
and radio, some of which can be so controversial as to risk censorship by the 
FCC, Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
"Because the media of TV and radio are relatively so young, these artists are 
charting new territory," said Lazar, curator of media and performing arts at 
the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh How I Dreamt of Things Impossible," the title of the presentation named 
after a drawing by William Blake, aptly describes a key point Lazar said she 
will attempt to illustrate with the aid of audio and video tapes. 
</P>
<P>
"Things impossible" are works created for electronic media that could never be 
made without the airwaves, said the 38-year-old Detroit native. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be looking mostly at work made specifically for TV and radio that exist 
solely for those media and wouldn't work so well if transferred to the stage. 
Which isn't to invalidate live stage work at all, but simply to convey how, 
when someone successfully uses these media, they can accomplish things they 
can't in stage." 
</P>
<P>
Works by Laurie Anderson, a name synonymous with performance art, will figure 
into the evening. But Lazar, who in her post at MOCA deals constantly with 
intermingling and crossover of distinct art forms, will feature work by artists 
usually identified with other disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
Several pieces written and directed specifically for TV by playwright Samuel 
Beckett are among the video excerpts she'll show, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's a guy who is mostly known for theater, but he's worked in radio and TV, 
and he really takes advantage of them and has really made some incredible 
works," Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
For comparison's sake, she'll juxtapose Beckett's "He Joe," a 1966 TV piece, 
with "Killer," a 1986 work by German video artist Gusztav Hamos. 
</P>
<P>
"Beckett's performance is so simple. It's basically a man sitting on a couch 
with (the sound) of a woman's voice whispering at him. You can't imagine it on 
TV. The camera lens just comes slowly up toward the actor and he never speaks. 
Whereas in 'Killer,' all the actors speak . . . and Hamos depicts very 
convincingly through three actors the profound complexity of a murder's 
passion." 
</P>
<P>
Using video technology, Hamos covers over the actors' eyes with thick black 
bands like those used to protect criminals' anonymity on news shows, Lazar 
said. Projected over the bands are scenes of John F. Kennedy's assassination, 
producing an effect available only to video makers. 
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate how the combination of video and dance can make possible "things 
impossible" for choreographers confined to the stage, video works by Merce 
Cunningham and other contemporary dance makers also will be shown. 
</P>
<P>
In "Imaginary Dances," choreographer Remy Charlip uses dance for radio, 
"inviting audiences to see dance in their mind's eye," said Lazar, who produced 
"The Territory of Art," a series of pieces commissioned for radio now being 
broadcast on non-commercial stations KUSC-FM (91.5) and KCRW-FM (89.9). 
</P>
<P>
"I'm also presenting works which I think could make very good use of the public 
(TV or radio) media but would have a hard time being there," said Lazar, 
referring to two controversial radio works produced for the series that have 
not been aired and that she thinks could be subject to FCC censorship. 
</P>
<P>
One contains adult themes and graphic language that the FCC discourages, she 
said, "but is a work of very strong artistic merit." 
</P>
<P>
"Almost Asleep," by Julie Hebert, a playwright and director living in the Bay 
Area, is based on a woman's struggle to cope with the "anger and fear she's 
been forced to live with as a result of being raped by two men." 
</P>
<P>
But it's also about how present-day society forces many people to deal with 
"any overpowering situation in one's physical, psychic or emotional territory," 
Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all forced to try to live with and negotiate with anger and fear. This 
is trying to call people out, to wake them up out of a sleep and into a 
consciousness that says they have to get beyond that anger and fear to 
negotiate life (with) courage. It's an example of a work that would mean our 
loss if subject to censorship."

ARCHITECTS RELEASE BOWERS MUSEUM RENOVATION PLAN

Bissell Architects of Newport Beach has released preliminary drawings for a 
$6-million addition to the 53-year-old Bowers Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The design -- which adds 51,672 square feet to the museum, increasing its size 
threefold -- retains the historic facade of the museum. The additions will be 
tucked into the rear of the site and finished with the same stucco and tile 
materials as the original building. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to preserve the old museum as a Santa Ana landmark," project architect 
John Jones said. "The new structure will basically be a backdrop for the old 
building." 
</P>
<P>
A new west wing will house collection storage and second-floor administrative 
offices. A north wing will contain an interior "street" or galleria linking the 
enlarged galleries with the enlarged multipurpose room, enlarged museum shop 
and new restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
This walkway will be paved with the same materials to be used in the renovated 
courtyard -- stone or tile, or scored concrete if the budget won't permit the 
costlier materials. 
</P>
<P>
The project also involves demolition of the 1974 addition to the building and 
restoration of the second floor of the original building, which will become 
additional gallery space. 
</P>
<P>
The new 11,522-square-foot gallery will double existing exhibition space. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the interior "street" was meant to echo a similar feature in Renzo 
Piano's design for Newport Harbor Art Museum's new building, Jones demurred, 
calling the idea simply a "buzzword" in museum architecture circles. 
</P>
<P>
Museum board of governors president Arthur V. Strock called the expansion "a 
delicate mixing of the old and the new" and "an attempt to be fiscally 
responsible, making good use of land resources and land dollars." 
</P>
<P>
He said he believed the design will result in "an efficient museum that is not, 
in and of itself, the most prominent part of its collection," but rather "a 
supportive container" for the museum's 80,000 objects. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana City Council approved the Newport Beach firm's design on Monday, 
three months after the city's Redevelopment Agency awarded the contract to 
Bissell. Site-plan review by various city departments begins next week. 
Ground-breaking is scheduled for spring 1990, and the renovated museum is due 
to reopen in spring 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The design replaces an earlier, more sprawling scheme commissioned two years 
ago from Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates of New York. It was scrapped when 
the museum's board of governors proposed building a mixed-use structure on the 
site to generate income for the museum. The current plan allows for 
preservation of one acre of the site for possible future development.

The environmental health division of Orange County's Health Care Agency 
performs routine unannounced inspections of the county's more than 6,000 
restaurants, markets and other food establishments. When conditions violate 
state law or applicable county and municipal codes, inspectors can issue 
notices of violation. If inspectors find during an announced recheck that 
conditions cited in the notice have not been rectified, they can effectively 
close the business by suspending its health permit. Inspectors can also issue a 
summary health permit suspension during a routine inspection if they find an 
immediate health threat. In all cases, health permits are reinstated as soon as 
the situation is rectified.

Its name and proximity to UC Irvine are the most obvious indicators that 
University Park is an education-oriented neighborhood, but the selection of 
used books for sale at the local library illustrates the point best. 
</P>
<P>
The small, one-room annex, called Friends' Bookstore, at University Park 
Library, is crammed with local residents' discarded reading material. Large 
volumes on history, medicine, art, law, physics, and philosophy far outnumber 
the paperbacks and romance novels. The small shop is staffed by volunteers and 
was established to financially supplement the library through sales of donated 
books. The shop receives a steady supply of donations from UCI faculty and 
students who live in the area. 
</P>
<P>
University Park was Irvine's first residential development, which is south of 
the San Diego Freeway and bordered on the west by Culver Drive. University 
Drive winds around, forming what are more or less the southern and eastern 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
Built through the mid- to late-1960s, the assortment of homes, town homes, 
condominiums and apartments was unusual at the time. Miles of greenbelts and 
walkways wind through the neighborhood, which is bordered by thousands of 
trees, including mature Brazilian pepper, California sycamore, coral and 
eucalyptus. The area lacks the flatness and uniformity of other parts of 
Irvine. The terrain slopes gently, and there is more variety in the colors and 
styles of houses, contrasted with the more recently built Westpark area located 
across the freeway and just up Culver. 
</P>
<P>
A focal point in the neighborhood is University Community Park, where 
University Park Library is. A tour of the library reveals the multicultural 
aspect of University Park, where nine different languages are spoken in the 
local middle school. The library has the largest Chinese-language book 
collection in Orange County and also has books and videos for adults and 
children available in Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, Farsi and Spanish. On 
Saturday afternoons, about 20 children gather at the library for instruction in 
Farsi (the Persian language spoken by Iranians) sponsored by the Iranian 
Cultural Center of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The after-school and weekend academic rigors taking place at the library and 
nearby schools is balanced by unstructured outdoor activities offered at the 
park. Just outside the library is Adventure Park, an area described by Park 
Supervisor Dave Sutor as "a 2 1/2-acre dirt pit with a drain in the bottom." 
After completing a safety course, children are turned loose to play in the mud, 
climb on rope ladders and romp on old truck tires, "just the way most of us who 
grew up in Orange County played before so much of it was developed," says 
Sutor. 
</P>
<P>
Children can build forts using lumber and tools provided by the park, but even 
the kids can't escape Irvine's strict rules governing what gets built. Five or 
more children can form a group and get a leased building site that allows them 
to occupy the space indefinitely, as long as they continue to add to the 
structure. The fort is inspected each day by park employees and a written 
notice posted if it does not meet established fort-building codes. 
</P>
<P>
Adventure Park also has a gardening area where children can learn horticulture. 
A pet area is inhabited by turtles, rabbits and guinea pigs. 
</P>
<P>
Just outside Adventure Park are 16 more acres of space devoted to multipurpose 
centers, tennis courts, racquetball, volleyball, roller-skating and playing 
fields for Irvine neighborhood sports leagues. 
</P>
<P>
One of Irvine's two year-round schools is in University Park. Vista Verde 
serves 570 students in kindergarten through eighth grade on a cycle of nine 
weeks in session followed by a three-week break, including time off for 
holidays and a four- to five-week break in the summer. "I think it's fun having 
vacation while other kids are in school," said Joanna Thomas, a fifth-grader at 
the school. "I like the computer classes that the PTA teaches after school 
too." 
</P>
<P>
The relative safety of University Park is best sensed around Vista Verde, which 
is not enclosed by a fence. Even younger children in the neighborhood ride 
their bikes to and from school. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Cunningham, principal of Rancho San Joaquin School in University Park, 
said utilizing student interns from nearby UCI adds to the innovative 
atmosphere for the faculty and its 740 seventh- and eighth-graders. Students 
are rewarded and evaluated not only through grades, but also by a work 
habits/effort honor roll program. "We want students to leave here with the 
proper tools to succeed in whatever it is that they are good at," says 
Cunningham. "Ability and knowledge must be supplemented with essential 
attitudes and habits." 
</P>
<P>
University Park has Lutheran and Methodist churches and an orthodox synagogue, 
Chabad of Irvine. The synagogue was founded in 1982 by a group of mostly South 
African Jews and now includes many Iranians and Israelis. About 300 families 
attend the synagogue, which operates its own school for preschool pupils 
through 6 years of age. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually we will expand the school, but right now we have mostly families 
with very young children. As the synagogue grows and matures, we will, of 
course, be teaching older children," says Controller Anne Otis. "There are many 
elements of Irvine and University Park that appeal to Jews. One can have a 
solid sense of community here, which Jews like. And we also have a strong 
education ethic, which, of course, causes us to gravitate towards areas close 
to universities. We have many UCI faculty members in our congregation, and they 
are also very active in the Hebrew school." 
</P>
<P>
Although not everyone who lives in University Park is directly affiliated with 
education, one could not escape its pervasive influence after living there for 
even a short time. The pursuit of creativity and mastery provides the 
underlying pulse of the neighborhood.

ICE CAPADES SKATER THRILLS AT 1ST SHOW ON HOME TURF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

It had to have been difficult for Angelique Gandy-Doud to realize, at age 8, 
that the hard, frigid substance she kept collapsing on -- the stuff that was 
responsible for sending her home soaking wet -- would one day be a source of 
income, fame and a husband. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember falling down and getting wet a lot," said Gandy-Doud of her first 
trip to Anaheim's Glacier Falls ice rink. "But I liked it. I had a great time. 
I started taking group lessons right after that." 
</P>
<P>
Now, 17 years later, she is about to come home for her first show in Orange 
County as a cast member of the Ice Capades. 
</P>
<P>
She will appear with the show Oct. 24-26 at the Bren Events Center in Irvine, 
her first performance here in nearly seven years with the Ice Capades. 
</P>
<P>
Gandy-Doud, from Garden Grove, joined the troupe at age 19 after spending years 
ascending the ranks of amateur skaters. She began by taking group lessons 
immediately after her dampened first effort on the ice, and finally attained 
the U.S. Figure Skating Assn.'s gold test level, the highest level to which an 
amateur can aspire and which all Olympic-class skaters must pass to qualify for 
competition in the Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was about 12," she said, "I decided I was going to stick with it and 
finish all my levels. I aspired to the Olympics, but I guess I didn't have what 
it took at the time to compete. And injuries got in the way. I had a back and 
ankle injury. They weren't serious, but they're the kinds of things that haunt 
you once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
But, she found, she was good enough to earn a spot in the Ice Capades. And, as 
a result, a spot in the heart of comic skater Brad Doud, to whom she has been 
married for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
The pair met and fell in love while the company was touring and Gandy-Doud was 
appearing as part of her husband-to-be's act. 
</P>
<P>
"The performance director picked four people to assist Brad in the act and one 
of the ones he picked was me," Gandy-Doud said. "Brad wears a tuxedo and isn't 
like a clown, and the act comes off at first like a regular act, but then 
things start to happen." 
</P>
<P>
The act simply unravels, she said, with each of the four female performers 
forced to leave the ice because of some catastrophe. Gandy-Doud is the last one 
off. 
</P>
<P>
"I end up running away from him, yelling at him to get away, and I dive under 
the curtain to make my exit," she said. "That's when he asked me to marry him. 
He had to yell it three or four times before I finally heard him, but I never 
got the chance to answer him." 
</P>
<P>
Olympic gold medalist Scott Hamilton, who was starring in the show at the time, 
was scheduled to go on next, and carried Gandy-Doud's answer out on the ice 
with him and told Brad Doud as they passed. 
</P>
<P>
"Brad had the ring out there and everything," said Gandy-Doud. "Everyone knew 
about it but me." 
</P>
<P>
Since their marriage, she said, the couple has been on the road for nine months 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
"You have your good days and your bad (on the road)," she said. "I always hate 
packing my suitcase. But we're buying a house in Las Vegas, and we'll probably 
settle down there." 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, however, Gandy-Doud said she was excited to be coming home 
as a performer for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, very," she said. "The show used to go to Anaheim before I joined it, and 
since I've been with it we've always gone to L.A. And my parents often fly out 
to see the opening or closing shows of the season, so they've seen their fair 
share of me. But coming to Irvine, in Orange County, this is my real home."

PROMISING NEW DRUGS DESERVE FASTER APPROVAL; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: THE FDA IS DETERMINED NOT TO PERMIT DRUGS THAT DON'T MERIT APPROVAL. 
BUT BLOCKING EFFECTIVE ONES MAY BE A WORSE SIN.

The United States seems to have a neurotic relationship with its 
drug-regulatory agency. The Food and Drug Administration is held in high esteem 
for protecting the public; at the same time, the agency is raked over the coals 
for serving the public poorly, mostly through bureaucratic foot-dragging. Even 
the harmonious paean of praise for the FDA's speedy approval of generic drugs 
has soured in the face of disclosures of bribes to agency personnel for 
approving one firm's drugs more speedily than another's. 
</P>
<P>
What is wrong with the FDA? Compared to the drug regulatory agencies of other 
countries, it is huge. Yet it is said to be small for its innumerable 
responsibilities. Its headquarters in Maryland is cheerless and inadequate in 
space, wiring and temperature control. These conditions and low pay scales 
discourage top-notch applicants for staff positions, and many senior posts are 
unfilled. 
</P>
<P>
Congress maintains relentless oversight of the FDA, with many distracting, 
often worthless, hearings for which agency leaders must prepare. Hearings used 
to be about drugs that Congress (in retrospect) believed should not have been 
approved; of late, the questions have been in the opposite direction: Why is 
the FDA so slow in making available promising drugs for AIDS? 
</P>
<P>
A key point of the "foot-dragging" controversy is the matter of how much data 
is enough and who should make that value judgment, which is never a simple 
mathematical exercise. The FDA believes that its people are the experts, 
although this is clearly not what Congress had in mind in 1962 when it gave the 
FDA new controls over the pharmaceutical industry. 
</P>
<P>
One hears repeatedly the disingenuous statement that the FDA is "only carrying 
out the law." A comparison between the 1962 statute and its legislative history 
on the one hand and FDA's operational behavior on the other shows some striking 
discrepancies. Consider, for instance, that Congress required only "substantial 
evidence" for approval -- that is, evidence that a few qualified investigators 
believed a drug to be safe and effective "even though there may be preponderant 
evidence to the contrary." Contrast that position with the failure (until 
recently) to approve ganciclovir for an AIDS-related infection that leads to 
blindness, despite the verdict by the only two ophthalmologists on a 12-person 
panel that the drug worked. (The other 10 were not convinced.) 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the trouble is the lack of a speedy, impartial appeals mechanism 
for judging who is right and who is wrong when a sponsor and the FDA are at 
loggerheads. American drug companies rarely fight even outrageous FDA demands, 
fearing retribution in future filings and anticipating inevitable refusal, 
whatever the merits of their case. 
</P>
<P>
On average, year in and year out, it takes new chemical entities about 2 1/2 
years from filing the application to obtaining FDA approval. (This is on top of 
six to seven years of human study before filing.) Meanwhile, the patent clock 
is ticking, with loss of income and partial loss of exclusivity time for the 
sponsoring firm. This is not a trivial consideration when one realizes that to 
bring a new chemical entity to market in this country requires about $100 
million just for the clinical phase costs, exclusive of "discovery" costs 
(taking account of the failures as well as the successes). 
</P>
<P>
There was little comfort in the record for new drugs taken to FDA advisory 
committees for votes from 1983 through 1987. For those products approved by the 
advisory committees without qualification, a mean of 19.7 months elapsed before 
full agency approval was granted. (A prominent FDA official asserts that this 
is no longer true, and that approval is now granted "in a matter of weeks" 
after advisory committee approval. I hope so.) 
</P>
<P>
The agency generally acts as if the worst sin it can commit is to approve a 
drug that does not merit approval. But for serious diseases where no good 
remedies exist, surely a sin at least as grievous is to refuse (or even delay) 
approval for a drug that is effective.

THE LESSONS OF SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earthquakes happen when you least expect them. In the San Francisco Bay Area 
Tuesday evening, the world went topsy-turvy. Without warning, and in just 15 
seconds, a region of 4.5 million people was shaken violently and then left 
stunned and bewildered. Even for veteran Californians, there is no terror quite 
like it. 
</P>
<P>
But the Earth has been through several billions of years of grinding and 
scraping and is not about to rest for anything, much less a baseball game. 
Southern Californians grieve for the deaths, injuries and damage suffered by 
our Northern California neighbors. There are ways that we can help (see below). 
We also can use the event to advantage, to do everything we can to prepare for 
such a disaster of our own. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows when the next one will come in Southern California, but it will. 
And when the quake comes, it could well be the feared big one, a shaker of 
about 8.0 magnitude, or 10 times as bad as Tuesday evening's Bay Area rocker. 
Imagine: 10 times as bad, or 100 times as severe as the Whittier quake of two 
years ago. Picture the pancaked freeway and the squashed buildings of the 
Marina District and multiply by 10. Imagine freeway bridges collapsed 
throughout Southern California. Thousands dead. Fires raging. Electric power 
and natural gas out for several days or more. Hundreds of thousands separated 
from loved ones. Life at a shocked standstill. It could happen today or 
tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, state and local agencies were well-prepared for the San Francisco 
quake. Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, who was in charge as acting governor, said the 
response was betterthan in previous disasters, improved to a great degree by 
preparation and training instituted after the Sylmar quake, centered in the 
upper San Fernando Valley, in 1971. There are always glitches and unexpected 
happenings, of course. McCarthy wondered who would have imagined that the 
sturdy old Bay Bridge would be the one to suffer such damage? The Nimitz 
Freeway, scene of the majority of deaths, was built before earthquake standards 
were adopted in the wake of the Sylmar quake. Highway authorities said 
conventional methods of reinforcement undertaken in the 1970s could not be 
readily adapted to the Nimitz to prevent its collapse. An investigation is in 
order to find out why not, or what could have been done. 
</P>
<P>
Officials remarked on the public-spirited reaction of the people of the Bay 
Area. After the first seconds of shock and the immediate tendency to panic, 
they pitched in to help one another, reponded to authorities' requests and, on 
occasion, performed heroics. There is enormous human confusion in such a 
disaster, McCarthy said, but he added, "Some very marvelous things were done by 
individual citizens that were not in response to any emergency plans." 
Motorists helped direct traffic in the absence of traffic signals. Others 
joined firemen in carrying hoses. Some participated in rescues, heedless of 
their own safety. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, another area's adversity offers Southern California an opportunity 
to examine its own ability to deal with an earthquake disaster. Southern 
Californians must keep practicing and improving both individual and collective 
disaster plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Human Element 
</P>
<P>
The human element in an earthquake disaster is critical. There may be no more 
helpless a feeling than experiencing violent ground movement, but Southern 
Californians need not feel defenseless even in the event of a giant quake. The 
one certainty is that individuals and families will be largely on their own for 
hours or days, until transportation, communications and utilities can be 
restored. Every family should have an emergency earthquake kit on hand at home, 
at the office and in the car. 
</P>
<P>
The primary home kit should contain several days' supplies of food and water, a 
portable radio with spare batteries, flashlights and batteries, matches, a 
source of heat such as acamp stove, extra clothing and an emergency supply of 
cash, since banking facilities probably will be interrupted. There should be a 
first-aid kit that includes spare medical prescriptions and eyeglasses or 
contact lenses. Paper plates and plastic utensils help conserve water. A wrench 
is necessary for shutting off natural gas supplies, but residents first have to 
know where the cutoff valve is, and how to turn it. The California Highway 
Patrol says emergency kits should be carried in auto trunks since motorists 
could be stranded on freeways for hours. Prepackaged kits are available in many 
surplus outlets and other stores ranging in price from $30 to $210. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government Preparation 
</P>
<P>
Generally, Southern California authorities believe the region now is 
well-prepared to deal with an earthquake disaster. Still, the city and state 
have failed to get substandard buildings up to earthquake codes, often because 
it is difficult or impossible to get financing, but also because some landlords 
simply refuse to do it. State legislation to provide assistance was vetoed this 
year. In Los Angeles, City Councilman Hal Bernson has proposed a special tax 
assessment and a revenue bond issue to provide reconstruction assistance for 
the 4,000 buildings in Los Angeles, housing more than 100,000 people, that do 
not meet standards. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Whittier quake, about 2,800 volunteers in the city of Los Angeles 
have beentrained to provide assistance in neighborhoods during an earthquake 
disaster, much like air raid wardens of World War II. This forward-thinking and 
economical program should be expanded throughout the region and rehearsed over 
and over again. 
</P>
<P>
Some local officials are disturbed, however, about the problem of regional 
coordination of services after the initial emergency period of 72 hours or so 
has ended. The Southern California Earthquake Preparedness Project has 
discussed a regional joint-powers agreement that would establish such an 
authority, but no such plan has been developed yet. This should be a priority 
for local and county governments, with state assistance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transportation 
</P>
<P>
Regional transportation leaders claim that the freeway system could sustain a 
quake like the San Francisco one without a Nimitz Freeway-style disaster. But 
the network is not built to withstand a giant earthquake. Both Caltrans and the 
California Highway Patrol say that motorists can expect most of the freeways to 
be shut down in such an event. Those ramps and bridges that do not collapse 
will be inspected as soon as possible for structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
Only now is the Los Angeles area moving to double-decked freeways like the 
Nimitz, with work starting on a deck over part of the Harbor Freeway and 
proposals for double-decking theVentura Freeway. Caltrans officials say modern 
freeway structures, such as those being built on the Century route, "are the 
strongest things we have." There would be no comparison between these modern 
structures and the aged Nimitz, but double-decking now is going to be a 
political issue. Caltrans will have to demonstrate the security of such a 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Airports are critical in such disasters and local and federal aviation 
authorities claim they are well prepared. Los Angeles International Airport 
conducted a drill simulating an 8.0 earthquake in 1987. Plans provide for LAX 
not only to serve as a transit point, but also as a focus for emergency medical 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Utilities 
</P>
<P>
The Sylmar quake also has been the benchmark for utilities improvements in 
recent years, but one company executive says there is no way to guard against 
major damage when vital facilities are located near the epicenter of a giant 
quake. For telephone companies, a major problem, even when service is 
available, is lines jammed by people trying to call in to friends and 
relatives. In San Francisco, incoming calls were blocked to give priority to 
those trying to call out from the damaged area. Pacific Bell conducts routine 
earthquake drills. 
</P>
<P>
The major water systems serving Southern California are designed to withstand a 
major quake, but even if the California Aqueduct were ruptured, the region 
should have a six-months' supply on hand, provided there is strict 
conservation. The major problem would be small distribution systems. In 1971, 
the disabled San Fernando system was tied into that of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Electric power systems are probably the most difficult to cushion against 
earthquake shock, but there also have been improvements since 1971. Natural gas 
lines also are less likely to break than in the past with the use of modern, 
more pliable materials. But, as with electricity, gas service could be out 
days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Help Northern California 
</P>
<P>
While now is the time to renew preparations for a possible Southern California 
disaster, it is also appropriate to consider the hardship that Northern 
Californians will suffer for weeks and months to come. Many families have lost 
their homes and possessions. State and federal disaster assistance will be 
forthcoming, but slowly. The Red Cross is seeking contributions of both money 
and blood. In this disaster there is only one California. Blood donors can 
contact local Red Cross chapters and those who want to make monetary 
contributions can call the Red Cross at 1-800-453-9000.

SOME FIRMS TO GET WINDFALL FROM QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The devastating earthquake that struck Tuesday in San Francisco is providing 
multimillion-dollar business opportunities for scores of companies, including 
construction firms, companies that preserve computer data and those that supply 
temporary office space. 
</P>
<P>
Only hours after the quake, for example, at least five San Francisco insurance 
and financial institutions paid as much as $25,000 each to Sungard Data Systems 
Inc., a Wayne, Pa.-based company that provides "disaster recovery" services for 
businesses that depend on computers. 
</P>
<P>
The five companies sent back-up data tapes by plane to Sungard's Philadelphia's 
office to preserve valuable computer programs designed to operate automated 
teller machines and other critical operations, said Susan Hetzel, Sungard's 
marketing manager. 
</P>
<P>
The potential market for such services in the wake of Tuesday's earthquake is 
difficult to pin down because many experts are reluctant to discuss the profits 
that could flow from repairing and preventing further damage from the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not profiteers," said Hetzel. "Most of our clients contracted with us 
long before this earthquake. It's just that we are in the sort of business 
where it helps to be prepared. Companies can go under in 48 hours if they are 
not ready for events like this." 
</P>
<P>
What's more, some companies that expected huge demand for their products or 
services complained that overburdened phone lines on Tuesday kept sales calls 
from getting through. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten some calls but we were expecting a lot more," said Scott 
Alexander, an assistant branch manager for San Lorenzo-based McGrath Rentcorp, 
which had $35 million in sales last year from leasing and selling modular 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander said the structures -- which rent for $150 to $9,000 a month -- are 
usually used by school systems and building contractors. But he said he expects 
that Bay Area companies in heavily damaged buildings may move part of their 
operations into modular office space until the damage could be assessed and 
repaired. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say the damage is sure to approach the $4 billion in insurance policy 
claims caused by another recent disaster a month ago -- Hurricane Hugo. 
Companies involved in the first step of the rebuilding process immediately went 
into action. 
</P>
<P>
"We volunteered five of our structural engineers to assess the damage," said 
Deborah Land, a spokeswoman for Fluor Corp. in Irvine. "They were dispatched 
this morning (Wednesday) on military aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
Once the engineers complete their analysis, "the demand is likely to be 
substantial for heavy construction work," predicts Jess Hawley, a spokesman for 
Boise, Ida.-based Morrison Knudsen, which has a 400-person office in San 
Francisco and has done construction work on the Bay Area Rapid Transit system. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, stocks of building materials producers advanced in trading on the 
nation's stock exchanges Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INVESTING IN REBUILDING 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Even as the rubble of the Marina district of San Francisco was smoldering, 
above, investors saw opportunities to take part in what will be a monumental 
rebuilding effort. Companies involved in building products, insurance, and 
computer recovery saw strong gains in their stock price.

<P>
A suspected chemical leak at McDonnell Douglas Space Systems in Huntington 
Beach sent four people to the hospital for tests today and prompted an 
evacuation of about 100 workers from one of the company buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The evacuation of Building 28 at the 250-acre plant began at 7:30 a.m. when 
workers reported a strange odor. Four people who complained of dizziness were 
treated at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center and released 
after tests showed that their blood gas levels were normal. 
</P>
<P>
Hazardous materials teams from Westminster, Huntington Beach and Newport Beach 
fire departments spent nearly three hours examining the building, but could 
find no sign of a spill or a leak, said Birgit Davis, a Fire Department 
spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Williams, a McDonnell Douglas spokesman, said gallium arsenide 
microchips, a highly advanced semiconductor used for research, are made in 
Building 28. He said he did not know what kinds of chemicals in the plant could 
cause problems if they leaked.

<P>
BankAmerica Corp., the nation's third-largest bank, said today that its 
third-quarter profits jumped 33.7% due in part to strong growth in consumer and 
residential mortgage loans and more effective control of expenses. 
</P>
<P>
As many analysts expected, the San Francisco-based bank did not make a large 
addition to its reserve to cover loan losses to Third World countries, which a 
number of other large banks have done in the third quarter, leading to large 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
BankAmerica said profits in the third quarter were $254 million, contrasted 
with $190 million in the corresponding year-earlier period. Per-share profits 
rose 19.6% to $1.16 a share from 97 cents in the 1988 third quarter, the bank 
said.

AMENDMENT OUTLAWING FLAG DESECRATION KILLED 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate, in a dramatic showdown today with President Bush, decisively 
rejected a proposed constitutional amendment to outlaw desecration of the 
American flag. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment, which would have been the 27th, was once considered almost 
certain of passage. But grass-roots passions cooled, senators feared tinkering 
with the 200-year-old Bill of Rights and Republican co-sponsors defected. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was 51 to 48 in favor of the amendment, 15 short of the two-thirds 
majority voting that was required for passage. A vote breakdown showed 33 
Republicans and 18 Democrats voting for the amendment, and 37 Democrats and 11 
Republicans against. 
</P>
<P>
"In my view, the flag should be at half-mast after this vote," said Senate GOP 
leader Bob Dole of Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union hailed the Senate vote, saying: "Senators 
demonstrated today that they understand that the right of dissent is a 
fundamental principle of our society. A majority, no matter how large or 
impassioned, cannot censor others or dictate how they express their political 
views." 
</P>
<P>
Congress, in response to a Supreme Court decision invalidating a Texas law that 
banned flag burning, has already passed a bill making it a federal crime to 
physically desecrate the flag. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who had sounded the call for a constitutional amendment, said that he 
will allow that bill to become law without his signature and that the statute 
is certain to be tested in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy White House Press Secretary Alixe Glen said Bush was "disappointed" by 
today's vote and emphasized that Administration lawyers had said from the start 
that the statutory approach chosen by Congress will not withstand a court test. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Democratic leader George J. Mitchell of Maine, a former federal judge 
who led the fight against the amendment, said the nation has never tampered 
with the Bill of Rights in 200 years "despite the worst that fate has hurled at 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said, "Principles which have stood the test of time should not be 
lightly discarded. Liberties that have seen us through civil wars and world 
wars should not be tampered with." 
</P>
<P>
But Dole, a wounded combat veteran of World War II, stood behind cartons of 
petitions for the amendment and charged that the Senate was giving Americans 
the "cold shoulder" by "too many lawyers who still think they're on the high 
school debate team." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
insisted that there never was more than a "scant majority" for the amendment 
and added: "We saved the flag, and we preserved the Constitution."

A dozen tall cranes began lifting flattened cars containing bodies out of the 
tangled rubble of the Nimitz Freeway today, while the Bay Area sought to regain 
its calm after a strong, damaging early morning aftershock brought the terror 
of Tuesday's big quake back to life. 
</P>
<P>
Work crews on the Nimitz used jackhammers to punch holes in the top layer of 
concrete debris so cars could be found and extracted. A human arm was seen in 
one Acura that emerged, crushed beyond any recognition as a vehicle except for 
the steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
There was no sign of survivors. Fourteen victims had been pulled from the 
mile-and-a-quarter long stretch of collapsed freeway and identified before this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
There was some optimism, however, that earlier estimates of more than 250 dead 
in the freeway rubble were too high. Alameda County officials said they have 
only 75 people still unaccounted for. However, some victims may not have been 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The magnitude 5.0 aftershock today was centered near Watsonville, an 
agricultural town in Santa Cruz County about 85 miles south of San Francisco. 
It struck at 3:15 a.m., waking thousands of people trying to enjoy their first 
night's sleep since the main 6.9 magnitude quake shook the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
The aftershock and two others that measured 4.5 collapsed a church steeple in 
Watsonville, forced closure of a bridge and started a fire that destroyed a 
mobile home. The new damage there added to the fears of relief agencies over 
residents in Santa Cruz County, where the main quake was also centered. 
</P>
<P>
Three airlifts were taking medical supplies and provisions into Santa Cruz. A 
plane from Santa Barbara left this morning to ferry medical supplies to three 
Santa Cruz-area hospitals. The Air National Guard plans to dispatch two 
helicopters from Mather Air Force Base to bring supplies into Santa Cruz and 
nurses to Watsonville. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvation Army sent 9,500 gallons of water into Santa Cruz County Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Cruz County is partially isolated . . . ," said Tom Mullins of the state 
Emergency Medical Services Authority. "An estimated 5,000 to 6,000 residents 
are using trucked-in water and large numbers are also without power." 
</P>
<P>
At least 201 homes and apartment buildings and 72 commercial structures in the 
county have received serious damage. Emergency shelter is needed because rain 
-- predicted to fall in the next few days -- would make camping out more 
difficult for displaced families. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Cruz police also resumed their search this morning for Robin Ortiz, 23, 
whose friends insist she is buried in the rubble of the Santa Cruz Coffee 
Roasting Co., which collapsed on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Five friends were arrested Wednesday night after they objected to police 
halting the rescue efforts at nightfall. About 20 people marched in protest 
outside the fallen shop in the downtown Pacific Garden Mall after her backpack 
was sighted in the rubble and her car was spotted nearby, unmoved since the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all but 13 of San Francisco's 165 public schools reopened today. 
Nearly 100,000 people in the Bay Area remained without electricity this 
morning, but power was restored in San Francisco's Financial District, causing 
thousands of alarms to start ringing.

staff reports in the Bay Area.

EARLY SNOWFALL CLOSES SCHOOLS, CUTS OFF POWER

<TEXT>
<P>
Heavy, wet snow falling over the Midwest caused widespread power outages in 
Ohio and Indiana today, with Cincinnati, Indianapolis and St. Louis among the 
cities setting records for the earliest measurable snowfall. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of homes and businesses in Ohio and hundreds in the 
Indianapolis area and southern Indiana were blacked out when snow caused 
branches to snap onto power lines. Some schools were closed. 
</P>
<P>
Three to 5 inches of snow fell overnight in Cincinnati, Dayton and other areas 
of southwestern Ohio. It was the earliest snowfall in Dayton since 1912. 
</P>
<P>
The snow followed a drop in temperatures from the upper 70s and low 80s Monday 
and Tuesday into the upper 20s and low 30s early today. 
</P>
<P>
Two Cincinnati radio stations were knocked off the air temporarily by the power 
outages, which affected an estimated 100,000 customers in the area. Up to 3 
inches of wet snow that melted quickly was reported in other areas of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
The snow was caused by a low-pressure system over the southeastern United 
States, combined with a high-level system over Missouri that pumped arctic air 
into the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
The snowfall was the deepest on record in Indianapolis since the weather 
service began keeping records in 1885, said meteorologist John Curran. The 
previous record of 1.4 inches had stood since 1925. 
</P>
<P>
Today's snowfall broke a record for the earliest measurable snow set Oct. 20, 
1916, in Indianapolis and in St. Louis, which had early morning snow flurries.

A federal magistrate today ordered a former Marine and Air Force communications 
officer held without bail on charges that he passed classified material to the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Magistrate W. Curtis Sewell said he found "a preponderance of evidence" against 
Frank Nesbitt, 44, to send the case to a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Nesbitt was arrested last week at a hotel in McLean, Va., by the FBI and was 
charged with delivering and attempting to deliver unauthorized information to 
agents of the Soviet government. 
</P>
<P>
At today's hearing, FBI Special Agent Lizzie Cassell said Nesbitt left his home 
near Memphis last June and began an odyssey that took him from Central and 
South America to the Soviet Union and back to Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
She said Nesbitt gave classified communications intelligence information to the 
Soviets during his 10-day stay in Moscow and provided Soviet agents with 
diagrams and charts.

Vice President Dan Quayle, who visited earthquake-torn San Francisco without 
talking to its mayor, today rejected the mayor's characterization of his tour 
as a "publicity stunt." 
</P>
<P>
During an appearance on NBC's "Today" show, Quayle was told San Francisco Mayor 
Art Agnos said that if the vice president visited the city without talking to 
him, "maybe it was a publicity stunt." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle disagreed about the reason for his visit. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's very unfortunate to take that kind of a shot at a very 
difficult time," Quayle said. "I was there to help people." 
</P>
<P>
Agnos said Wednesday he was "ticked off" that Quayle "flies around in a 
helicopter, makes a bunch of television spots" but did not meet with him. The 
mayor had said before Quayle's visit that he planned to meet with Quayle to 
urge immediate federal help. 
</P>
<P>
The White House today accused Agnos of deciding "not to cooperate." Asked why 
Quayle and Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner did not meet with Agnos, 
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Agnos was not only invited but refused an 
offer of a helicopter to transport him.

Sources said Afanasyev's replacement will be Ivan T. Frolov, a philosopher and 
former editor of the journal Kommunist who has been an adviser to Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
One well-placed Soviet source said the move would give Gorbachev and his 
reformist allies control of Pravda, whose circulation is dropping as it lags 
behind other newspapers championing franker coverage of national affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper recently suffered an embarrassment when it published an Italian 
newspaper's article claiming the popular Communist maverick Boris N. Yeltsin 
boozed and shopped his way through the United States during a recent speaking 
tour. A few days later, Pravda apologized to readers, saying the story was 
based on hearsay and could not be substantiated. 
</P>
<P>
The replacement of Afanasyev, 66, follows a special party meeting on the press 
that appeared to be aimed at reformists rather than conservatives such as the 
editor of Pravda. Soviet journalists said that at the closed-door session 
Friday, Gorbachev tore into some of the stars of the glasnost-era media. 
</P>
<P>
He reportedly called specifically for the resignation of the editor of the 
country's most popular newspaper, the weekly Arguments and Facts, for acting 
against the party and seeking his political downfall. The demand triggered a 
move in the Supreme Soviet legislature and among the newspaper's workers to 
defend the editor. 
</P>
<P>
The source characterized the attack on the outspoken practitioners of glasnost 
as a gesture to party conservatives while his real goal was to gain control of 
Pravda.

BILL INTRODUCED TO CUT CAPITAL GAINS TAXES, EXPAND IRAS

Two Republican senators, claiming support from the Bush Administration and more 
than half the Senate, introduced a bill today to cut capital gains taxes and 
expand tax-deferred Individual Retirement Accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"This plan provides opportunities and incentives for all Americans," Sen. 
William V. Roth Jr. (R-Del.) told a news conference. "It's good for both savers 
and investors. And it's good for America." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush campaigned last year on a pledge to cut capital gains taxes. 
Over objections of Democratic leaders, the House in September approved a 
reduction endorsed by the Administration. That legislation did not address 
IRAs. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), co-sponsor of the bill, claimed to have between 55 
and 58 votes for it in the 100-member Senate.

Merchants across the country are handling personal checks and credit card 
transactions in ways that may lead to fraud and invasion of privacy, a consumer 
group said today. 
</P>
<P>
The organization, Bankcard Holders of America, assailed the practice of many 
merchants requiring customers who pay for purchases with personal checks to 
provide a major credit card number and expiration date, plus a telephone 
number. This information is then written on the check. 
</P>
<P>
"Store clerks often pressure consumers into writing their bank card numbers on 
personal checks, but these consumers don't realize the potential danger in 
doing so," the group's director, Elgie Holstein, told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
He contended that "mail order fraud and application fraud are increasingly 
popular crimes, and placing this information (a card's number and expiration 
date) on a personal check enables a thief to make purchases or apply for credit 
in the customer's name." 
</P>
<P>
"Requiring customers to present a major credit card as identification, or even 
noting on the check that the consumer holds a Visa or MasterCard, can be an 
appropriate merchant practice," Holstein said.

The government today agreed to repay a large chunk of its foreign debt, 
disappointing anti-apartheid campaigners who had hoped to use the debt issue to 
speed political reform, but heavy debt repayments will still take a toll on the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Under a new pact with 330 international bankers, South Africa will repay about 
$1.5 billion of its $20-billion short-term debt within three years. That debt 
was originally scheduled to be repaid next June. 
</P>
<P>
But South Africa will also have to make big payments on medium- and long-term 
debt. Economists said this could squeeze the nation's gold and foreign exchange 
reserves, which have dwindled to a level to cover only six weeks' of imports. 
</P>
<P>
"All South Africans must realize that the country faces tough times in the next 
four years," Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said.

CONSUMER PRICES UP MODEST .2% FOR SEPT.;

ECONOMY: CLOTHES PRICES RISE SHARPLY, BUT ENERGY COSTS FALL FOR THE FOURTH 
CONSECUTIVE MONTH.

<P>
Consumer prices in September rose an unexpectedly modest 0.2%, with most prices 
virtually unchanged except for a sharp rise in clothing costs, the government 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Energy prices, which had climbed sharply at the wholesale level, raising the 
expectation of an increase on the retail level, fell for the fourth consecutive 
month in September, the Labor Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Jittery stock and bond markets rallied on the news, taking the favorable 
inflation number as a sign the Federal Reserve Board has leeway to nudge 
interest rates lower. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the report triggered an announcement that the nation's 38.9 million 
Social Security recipients will get a 4.7% benefit increase in January to 
offset the effects of inflation over the last year. (Story, P1) 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a separate report, the department said Americans' average weekly 
earnings, after adjusting for inflation, rose 0.3% in September following a 
0.7% decline in August. 
</P>
<P>
Average weekly earnings in September were $338.67, up 3.5% from a year earlier. 
But, when inflation is taken into account, real weekly earnings were down. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices rose at a high annual rate of 6.7% for the first five months of 
the year, driven up by rising gasoline prices. 
</P>
<P>
However, the index has risen only 0.2% or remained flat in each of the last 
four months, bringing the annual rate down to 4.4% for the first three 
quarters, the same as the rate for all of 1988 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows clearly that inflation is under control. . . . Under these 
circumstances, there is no question that interest rates will fall," said 
economist William K. MacReynolds of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
But economist Robert Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago said the 
September report overstates the decline in inflation and warned of higher 
energy prices ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been an abatement, but it hasn't been to the degree this number 
would suggest. We're likely to have some less attractive numbers in the fourth 
quarter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices, down 2.2% in September, have declined 9.3% in the last four 
months after increasing 21.2% in the first five months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Food prices, which were surging earlier in the year, rose a moderate 0.2% last 
month, in part because of a 1.1% decline for fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Clothing prices, after falling in the three previous months, rose 1.7% in 
September. Apparel for women and girls, reflecting the introduction of new fall 
and winter fashions, were up 3.6%.

An overwhelming 99% of BAT Industries PLC's shareholders today approved a major 
defensive restructuring planned by the British conglomerate, including the sale 
of all its U.S. retailing operations. 
</P>
<P>
BAT's plan is aimed at increasing shareholder value in an attempt to thwart a 
hostile all-paper $21-billion bid from an investor group led by Sir James 
Goldsmith. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase would be the world's second largest takeover after the $25-billion 
acquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc. completed earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
BAT is the world's biggest tobacco company and has substantial operations in 
retailing -- including the Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field chains in the 
United States -- paper and financial services.

Out-of-work managers over age 50 found jobs faster than their younger 
colleagues in the job market last summer, according to a survey released today 
by Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"The results represent the first time in 15 years of tracking job searches that 
the 50-and-over age group has surpassed its younger counterparts in the length 
of time it takes to find a new job," said James E. Challenger, president and 
founder of the job-search consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's survey of third-quarter employment patterns showed the median time 
needed for an out-of-work manager age 50 or over to find new work was 3.23 
months. Unemployed managers in all other age groups required a median time of 
3.26 months.

His victory Down Under came in the Moe Cup, a race held annually in a small 
Australian bush town. Shoemaker, visiting for the first time as part of a 
farewell tour, rode 8-1 shot Cosign to victory, which offered total prize money 
of only $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker's visit captivated the small coal mining town of Moe, west of 
Melbourne.

"This has made my visit to Australia one of my best moments in racing," 
Shoemaker, 58, said after riding Cosign to a 1 3/4-lengths win over Ima Red 
Man. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been going to come to Australia many times over the past 20 years only to 
be disappointed through home commitments, and I did not want to go back to 
America without a winner," he said.

Ronald Agenor of Haiti continued his mastery over American Andre Agassi today, 
knocking the No. 2 seed out of the Seiko Super Tennis Tournament with a 6-0, 
6-2 victory in 52 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why I couldn't get a point," Agassi, ranked No. 5 in the world, 
said of his third loss in three meetings with Agenor, ranked No. 39. 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland was another upset victim, losing 4-6, 
7-6 (9-7), 6-4 to American qualifier Rick Leach. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Stefan Edberg of Sweden trounced Australian John Fitzgerald 6-2, 
6-3, avenging his loss to Fitzgerald in this tournament's semifinals last year. 
</P>
<P>
Agenor kept Agassi on the run with accurate placements on the artificial court 
in the Yoyogi National Stadium. Agassi committed 39 unforced errors to Agenor's 
27. 
</P>
<P>
"He played his best game against me. I have met him three times but won only 10 
games," Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
Leach, who teamed with American Jim Pugh for the Australian doubles 
championship in 1988 and 1989 but is ranked 340th in singles, needed two hours, 
13 minutes to beat Hlasek, ranked No. 12. 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's quarterfinals, Edberg is to meet Henry Leconte of France, who beat 
Eric Jelen of West Germany 4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4 today. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian Grant Connell, blasting 13 aces, beat sixth-seeded Andres Gomez of 
Eduador 2-6, 6-1, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Australian Darren Cahill defeated Dan Goldie of the United States, the No. 8 
seed, 7-6 (7-2), 6-4. Goldie led 4-1 in the second set but Cahill took the next 
five games. 
</P>
<P>
American Aaron Krickstein, the No. 4 seed, fought back with powerful ground 
strokes for a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 triumph in two hours over Australian qualifier 
Broderick Dyke, who led 3-1 in the final set. 
</P>
<P>
The singles winner will earn $100,000 from the $627,500 purse.
