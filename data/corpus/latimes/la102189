MASON'S STEREOTYPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As if there wasn't already enough trouble between ethnic groups, between racial 
groups, between religious groups, etc., along comes Jackie Mason to set 
whatever progress has been made back at least 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
His vicious stereotyping of his own people in the name of comedy on his 
television series "Chicken Soup" has taken a new turn. He is now allowing his 
bigotry toward other groups to become obvious. 
</P>
<P>
The man is no longer just an embarrassment to the Jewish people; he is an 
embarrassment to the human race.

BROWN SHIRT LEADERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Arnold T. Schwab's Oct. 7 letter attacking Rep. William Dannemeyer: It is 
incorrect to assert that the Nazis "were heterosexuals" who "ended toleration 
of homosexuals." In fact, the leadership of the brutal Brown Shirts -- the 
Sturmabteilung, or S.A. -- were homosexuals. They were instrumental in creating 
the climate of terror and intimidation that enabled Hitler to come to power. He 
in turn double-crossed them and they were eliminated in a purge.

the Third Reich."

ART AND AIDS EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Art potentially educates. Art has played an invaluable role in the ongoing 
battle to fight AIDS. Now the National Endowment for the Arts "will be forced 
to establish internal standards to red-flag those grant applications whose 
contents may be controversial" ("Paranoia, Confusion Left in Wake of Arts 
Debate," Oct. 10). 
</P>
<P>
This red-flagging will undoubtedly encompass all artistic endeavors that 
explore the drama of AIDS. Once again, opportunities to educate the American 
public about AIDS have been squelched because of insidious homophobia. 
</P>
<P>
Art potentially saves lives. Censorship is a killer.

BETTE DAVIS' BIOGRAPHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following the death of Bette Davis earlier this month, still another Hollywood 
legend was taken from us. Only days later, her biographer and friend, Whitney 
Stine, passed away at his home in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Stine was a walking encyclopedia on Hollywood and was always willing to share 
his time and knowledge with anyone who was intrigued enough to pull up a chair. 
Fortunately, I was one of those individuals. Listening to him talk about Bette, 
Lauren Bacall, Joan Crawford and Tallulah Bankhead, I began to feel I knew them 
myself. 
</P>
<P>
His books on Hollywood ("Mother Godamn," "Stars and Star Handlers") and romance 
("Liberty," "Jewel of the Klondike") are richly instilled with both his 
adulation and his respect for the film industry.

SIR ANTHONY QUAYLE, 76; ACTOR WON DISTINCTION IN THEATER, FILM, TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sir Anthony Quayle, who in a career that reached through six decades earned a 
reputation as one of the English-speaking world's most distinguished actors, 
died Friday at his home in London. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, who was 76, had been suffering from cancer for several weeks, his 
agent, Laurence Evans, told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
An authoritative, forceful character on stage and in television and films, the 
burly actor was credited with bringing Stratford-on-Avon (the Royal Shakespeare 
Company) into the forefront of British theater, encouraging such dramatic 
giants as Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud to work there for minimum 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Although attracted to acting as a youth as an escape from a middle-class 
existence that he once described as "being shut in a box," he was in the 
theater nearly 40 years before reaching star status with "Sleuth" in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
His performances in London and New York as a middle-aged detective-story writer 
seeking revenge on his wife's young lover were lauded by Clive Barnes as 
"pleasantly grim, slightly paranoid." 
</P>
<P>
The play won a Tony award, a prize Quayle himself had quietly won in 1956 with 
his performance as the bloody Oriental tyrant in Christopher Marlowe's 
"Tamburlaine the Great." 
</P>
<P>
Although "Tamburlaine" was an artistic triumph, it failed to make a star of 
Quayle, who continued to be forced "to do all sorts of crap," as he referred to 
his film and TV assignments. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of it was "crap," despite his modest protestations. 
</P>
<P>
His better-known, widely heralded film portrayals included characters in Alfred 
Hitchcock's "The Wrong Man," "The Guns of Navarone," "Lawrence of Arabia," "The 
Eagle Has Landed" and "Anne of a Thousand Days," which brought him an Academy 
Award nomination for his role as Cardinal Wolsey. 
</P>
<P>
On TV, he won an Emmy in 1974 as best supporting actor in a dramatic special 
for "QB VII, Parts 1 and 2." He also appeared in the miniseries "Masada." 
</P>
<P>
John Anthony Quayle came from a family of druggists in Lancashire and until his 
teens had thought that he would enter the family business. 
</P>
<P>
But a lack of interest in chemistry and physics coupled with a fascination he 
found in the "pretty girls" in the theater sent him to the stage. 
</P>
<P>
He attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts for a year and then got a job as 
straight man to a comedian. He made his first appearance on the London stage in 
1931, and was a stalwart of the Old Vic company for several seasons, making his 
American debut in 1936 in "The Country Wife," which starred Ruth Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
He first became a director in 1946 in a London production of "Crime and 
Punishment," starring Gielgud, Peter Ustinov and Edith Evans. 
</P>
<P>
He became director of the Stratford theater in 1948, appearing that first 
season as Petruchio in "The Taming of the Shrew." He played Falstaff in both 
parts of "Henry IV" in 1951 and was in "The Merry Wives of Windsor" in 1955. He 
also recruited such young actors as Richard Burton and Laurence Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to his ability to attract such established stars as Olivier, Gielgud 
and Ralph Richardson, he said, "You have to set an example -- a merry example, 
I hope." 
</P>
<P>
Yet as a manager or director, Quayle admitted, he sometimes believed that he 
had been "pouring creativity into others at the expense of my own," he told the 
newspaper The Independent earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Sleuth" became his first taste of box-office success. 
</P>
<P>
Other Broadway appearances included roles in Bertolt Brecht's "Galileo," 
Ustinov's "Up the Tree" in 1967, and "Tamburlaine," a role in which Quayle 
"combined a chilling and almost lunatic savagery with a kind of barbaric 
splendor," critic Wolcott Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, Quayle had served in the Royal Artillery and then gave up 
a desk job in Gibraltar to help organize partisan guerrilla forces behind 
German lines in Albania. 
</P>
<P>
"If life doesn't have that little bit of danger about it, you'd better create 
it. If life hands you that danger, accept it gratefully," he once told an 
interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
He met such wartime giants as Winston Churchill, Dwight D. Eisenhower and 
Charles de Gaulle and afterward wrote of those adventures in two books, "Eight 
Hours From England" and "On Such a Night." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Quayle joined the distinguished company of actor-knights that has 
included Olivier, Alec Guinness, Gielgud, Richardson, John Mills and, most 
recently, Rex Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
Morton Gottlieb, one of the producers of "Sleuth," which ran for 1,222 
performances in New York, recalled Quayle as "a wonderful actor." 
</P>
<P>
"There are some actors who have a certain personality and no matter what the 
role is, that personality takes over the stage," Gottlieb said. "But Tony 
Quayle would fit into whatever the role and characterization was rather than 
imposing a certain persona on the play and the audience. Sometimes with big 
stars that doesn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his second wife, Dorothy, an American actress he married in 
1947, two daughters and a son. His first marriage ended in divorce.

MORNING BRIEFING: IF IT HAPPENED TO YOU ONCE, YOU DON'T WANT IT TO SEE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

When a football player at Pacific University, a nonscholarship school near 
Portland, Ore., left the sideline to tackle an opposing player from archrival 
Linfield who was heading for a touchdown recently, Dicky Maegle knew it was 
happening again. 
</P>
<P>
"You do something like that and you get an awful lot of attention," Maegle said 
after watching replays of the incident on an ABC "Monday Night Football" 
telecast. 
</P>
<P>
The 1954 Cotton Bowl was the scene of one of the most unusual moments in 
sports. Maegle was running down the sideline for a Rice touchdown when Tommy 
Lewis of Alabama bolted from the sideline and onto the field to tackle Maegle. 
The Owls were awarded a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"What it is, I guess it's like committing a murder, except you don't kill the 
guy and you get away with it," said Maegle, who is in the hotel business in 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a very good way of being recognized," he said. "But then again, 
people don't get recognized for something like this unless it's real stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Add tackle: Lewis is an insurance salesman in Huntsville, Ala., and is still 
questioned about that New Year's Day on the floor of the Cotton Bowl in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people made a hero out of Tommy Lewis," Maegle said. "Hell, he wasn't 
no hero. He wasn't any star. The star of that team was Bart Starr. Not Tommy 
Lewis. But after that game, a lot of people knew who he was." 
</P>
<P>
Last add tackle: Lewis' current counterpart, Joe Schmelzer of Palo Alto, a 
6-foot, 200-pound junior linebacker, was suspended by Pacific for leaving the 
sideline to tackle Tony Chiu of Linfield. Said Bob Bonn, Pacific's athletic 
director: "We don't teach those kind of values." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Oct. 21, 1973, a Ram became the first and only National 
Football League player to record two safeties, in a 24-7 victory over the Green 
Bay Packers. Who was it? 
</P>
<P>
It's all in the approach: NBC-TV, trying to get the Raiders' Bo Jackson to do 
an interview with O. J. Simpson on its "NFL Live" show Sunday, was getting the 
run-around from Jackson's agent, Richard Woods. 
</P>
<P>
So Simpson called his good friend Marcus Allen of the Raiders for help. Allen 
relayed the request to Jackson, who gladly agreed to the interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time Marcus wants a job as a booking agent, we'll find a spot for him," 
said Dick Ebersol, president of NBC sports. 
</P>
<P>
Call it coincidence: Oakland's Bob Welch was scheduled to pitch against the San 
Francisco Giants Tuesday, the day Game 3 of the World Series was postponed 
because of the Bay Area earthquake. The last time Welch pitched against the 
Giants was for the Dodgers Oct. 1, 1987, the day of the Whittier earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Fred Dryer.

VALENZUELA'S NEGOTIATIONS HAVE A SHAKY BEGINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers' negotiations with potential free-agent pitcher Fernando Valenzuela 
have gotten off to a worrisome start. 
</P>
<P>
In last Tuesday's initial meeting between the two parties, the Dodgers' offer 
fell far short of Valenzuela's demand, according to Valenzuela's agent Tony 
DeMarco. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they are close to where we're at," DeMarco said Friday, quickly 
adding, "But we make no secret that Fernando wants to play here. We still think 
we can get things settled." 
</P>
<P>
Although neither party would disclose figures, the dividing issue appears to be 
a pay cut. Valenzuela, who made $1.85 million last season, will not accept 
less. He is thought to be seeking a three-year deal worth about $6 million, 
something other teams, including the New York Yankees, might be willing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers are reportedly offering closer to $1 million a year. They 
reportedly will pursue Montreal pitcher Mark Langston if he becomes a free 
agent, and may also feel that rookies John Wetteland and Ramon Martinez have 
reduced Valenzuela's importance to the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela's advisers point to the left-hander's comeback from shoulder 
problems. Over his last 76 2/3 innings, Valenzuela had a 2.70 earned-run 
average. He finished the season with a 10-13 record and 3.43 ERA. However, he 
did not win a game for nearly a year because of his shoulder injury, and he has 
gone 15-21 over the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' loyalty to Valenzuela, who has been with the team for 11 years, no 
longer appears to be a major issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize Fernando's importance to the community, but we have to do what we 
feel is best for us," Claire said at season's end. 
</P>
<P>
Said DeMarco: "They have the right of first refusal, always. But we also know 
that there will be other important teams that are interested in him, teams that 
would welcome him." 
</P>
<P>
No other team can officially express interest unless Valenzuela declares 
himself a free agent, which must be done within 15 days after the end of the 
World Series. DeMarco, however, is confident of that interest. 
</P>
<P>
"We know teams are there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
DeMarco said he will meet with Dodger officials after the Series. 
</P>
<P>
In other news, Claire said Friday he was feeling upbeat about phone 
conversations with outfielders Kirk Gibson and Kal Daniels, both of whom are at 
their winter homes recovering from knee surgeries.

A SPECIAL TRIBUTE TO RON COPELAND AND SON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I once saw Ron Copeland run the 400 meters in a track meet at Pierce College. 
He was a tall, well-built man with none of the starved, bony look of the 
typical track star. What struck me that day and has stayed with me since was 
the beauty of his stride. It had a machine-like quality because of its 
precision, but no machine ever moved so gracefully. Everything was in perfect 
syncopation with everything else. 
</P>
<P>
Last year in search of that vanished beauty, I drove the 200-mile round trip 
from my home in Ventura to Dorsey High to see Ron Copeland's son, Kevin, play 
football. As soon as I saw Kevin run out on the field, I knew the trip was 
worth it because there was the same grace and power again -- the acceleration 
without the strain. 
</P>
<P>
The beauty of sports has always meant more to me than what the damn score was. 
I mourn for the beauty of Ron Copeland's stride reborn in his son Kevin and 
silenced again for reasons God only knows.

RULE INTERPRETATION FUMBLED BY WIRE STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Associated Press story on the 49ers-Saints game (Oct. 9) described Jerry 
Rice's apparent fumble before reaching the goal line, and the fact that the 
ball rolled through and out of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The article says that "if that had been the ruling, the 49ers would have had 
the ball where Rice fumbled." 
</P>
<P>
While that statement might mollify a reader who felt that the outcome was 
determined by a bad call, the statement is incorrect. Under those 
circumstances, the ball would have been turned over to the Saints at the point 
of the fumble (the prior rule would have given the ball to the Saints at the 20 
as a touchback), but in any case, it is turnover. The game's outcome was 
determined by a bad call. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the officials declared that the next play (the extra point) was 
run before there was a chance to call for an instant replay review, precluding 
such a review. But football rules designate that the extra point is part of the 
touchdown play (not an additional play). So the officials blew it twice and 
cost the Saints a game. 
</P>
<P>
STEPHEN D. MOSES, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Editor's note: According to NFL rules, "A fumble that goes forward and out of 
bounds will return to the fumbling team at the spot of the fumble unless the 
ball goes out of bounds in the opponent's end zone. In this case, the defensive 
team is to take possession at the spot of the fumble." By the way, the NFL has 
suspended, at least through this weekend, that instant-replay official.

BRUIN-BASHERS HAVE THEIR SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For all its supposedly great recruiting and national glory, the UCLA football 
program has taken a giant step backward this year. The Bruins' performance 
against Arizona was not just pathetic and embarrassing. It was inexcusable. 
</P>

To say the Bruins quit is giving them too much credit. They weren't trying to 
begin with.

Bravo for the two-page spread on hockey's Great One, Wayne Gretzky, becoming 
the game's all-time scoring leader. The Times has finally given hockey the 
recognition it deserves (including making it the main headline story over Game 
2 of the Bay Area World Series.)

I don't recall Kareem Abdul-Jabbar receiving this kind of coverage when he

VUKOTA'S SPREE LEADS ISLANDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mick Vukota is getting a chance to play because he gives the New York Islanders 
considerable toughness up front. He is 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 195. 
</P>
<P>
The drawback is that the 21-year-old right wing has not been proficient at 
putting the puck into the net. In his first 71 games for the Islanders, Vukota 
accumulated 345 penalty minutes, but only four goals. 
</P>
<P>
For a time in the first period Friday night at Landover, Md., the Washington 
Capitals must have thought Vukota was Mario Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
Vukota scored a hat trick in five minutes to lead the Islanders to a 5-3 
victory in a fight-marred game. 
</P>
<P>
For a brief span, Vukota was a sharpshooter. At 10:08, he took a pass at the 
left side of the net and, with a quick flick of the wrist, made it 1-0 
Islanders. A little later, he knocked in a rebound. He completed his first hat 
trick since junior hockey when he slipped the puck behind goalie Don Beaupre at 
15:08 to give New York a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After his offensive burst, Vukota reverted to his routine in the second period, 
picking up a major penalty for fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 3, New Jersey 2 -- Rich Sutter, one of seven brothers to play in the 
NHL, provided the goals for the Canucks at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Sutter scored in each period for his first hat trick. The 25-year-old wing is 
probably the least known of the brothers, four of whom are still playing. 
</P>
<P>
Rich's twin brother, Ron, plays with Philadelphia, Brent with the New York 
Islanders and Duane with the Chicago Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 6, Montreal 2 -- Veteran center Dave Andreychuk had two goals and an 
assist at Buffalo to lead the Sabres to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Andreychuk's second goal, his sixth of the season, tied the score, 2-2, in the 
second period. 
</P>
<P>
He triggered a four-goal third-period burst when he set up Pierre Turgeon for 
the tie-breaking score at 4:21. Christian Ruttu assisted on the next three 
goals as the Sabres turned the game into a romp. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 3, Edmonton 0 -- It was an enjoyable return to Edmonton for Bruins' 
goaltender Andy Moog. 
</P>
<P>
Moog, who helped the Oilers win a Stanley Cup a few years ago, stopped shots to 
produce a shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, Winnipeg 2 -- Dirk Graham's short-handed goal in the third period 
thwarted the Jets' comeback at Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Smail scored early in the final period to cut the Blackhawk lead to 3-2. 
When Wayne Presley went off for hooking, the Jets made a bid to tie. But when 
defenseman Fredrik Olausson fanned on a pass, Graham grabbed the puck and 
scored quickly. DAN HAFNER

JAPAN FORCES U.S. TO FIVE SETS BEFORE LOSING IN VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After winning almost every volleyball championship imaginable in the last five 
years, the U.S. men's national team has struggled to rebuild after losing four 
starters in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
And things didn't get any easier against the Japanese national team Friday 
night at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans, two-time defending Olympic champions and ranked No. 1 in the 
world, held on for a tough 15-13, 15-6, 9-15, 7-15, 15-12 win before a crowd of 
2,876. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the Americans' third in four matches against Japan on an 
eight-stop tour through Japan and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The teams were tied, 8-8, in the final game, but two ace blocks by Bryan Ivie 
and an ace serve by Adam Johnson sparked a 7-4 run by the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Japan capitalized on several errors by the Americans, who lost 
starters Karch Kiraly, Steve Timmons, Craig Buck and Doug Partie to the pro 
beach and Italian leagues since the 1988 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team also played without two of its best players, Bob Ctvrtlik of Long 
Beach and Scott Fortune of Laguna Beach. Ctvrtlik was attending a wedding, and 
Fortune was nursing an ankle injury. Ctvrtlik and setter Jeff Stork, the only 
remaining starters from the 1988 team, plan to leave after the World Cup 
championships in November to play professionally in Italy.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Lakers, finally home after nearly three weeks on the road, will play host 
to a two-night exhibition tournament featuring the Cleveland Cavaliers, Golden 
State Warriors and Philadelphia 76ers tonight and Sunday at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Today's games match the Cavaliers against the Warriors at 4:30, followed by the 
Lakers and 76ers at 7:30. On Sunday, the first-game losers will play at 4:30; 
the winners at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
Winners of their six exhibition games this season, the Lakers will be without 
forward Orlando Woolridge, out for at least three weeks after arthroscopic 
surgery to remove bone fragments from his right knee. Also, reserve center Mark 
McNamara was given permission to miss practice Friday so he could return to 
Santa Cruz and assess the earthquake damage to his off-season home. It is not 
known when McNamara will rejoin the team. SAM McMANIS

DONNIE HAMMOND SHOOTS A 65 TO TIE TIM SIMPSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donnie Hammond, seeking his second consecutive victory, overcame blustery 
weather Friday to shoot a 65 and tie Tim Simpson for the lead after three 
rounds of the Disney tournament at Lake Buena Vista, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond, who had the low round of the day by two strokes, and Simpson, the 
second-round leader, are at 14-under-par 202. Simpson, who had a two-stroke 
lead when the round began, shot a 70. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Couples and Bob Gilder were tied for third at 204 after shooting 69s. Four 
more players were at 206. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond won the PGA's most recent tour stop, the Texas Open, two weeks ago. His 
second consecutive 65 came on a sunny but windy day with temperatures in the 
50s. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Hendrickson and Charles Coody shot five-under-par 67s to share the 
first-round lead in the $400,000 Transamerica seniors tournament at Napa, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Hill, Billy Casper and Bruce Devlin were tied for third at 69. Seven 
golfers were two strokes behind the leaders at 70, including Arnold Palmer.

Harding, 18, of Portland, Ore., was third at the American championships last 
February, behind Trenary and Kristi Yamaguchi. But Harding won both the 
original program and free skate in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Trenary, of Colorado Springs, Colo., finished second, with Simone Lang of East 
Germany third. 
</P>
<P>
Viktor Petrenko of the Soviet Union, the 1988 Olympic bronze medalist, won the

champion Kurt Browning of Canada and U.S. champion Chris Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
Natalia Mishkutenok and Arthur Dmitriev of the Soviet Union won the pairs, 
taking the short and long programs. American champions Kristi Yamaguchi and

Cal State Fullerton will take on Fresno State and the Bulldogs' 13-game winning 
streak in a Big West Conference game at 7 tonight in Fresno's Bulldog Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State (6-0 overall, 3-0 in the conference) began its streak with a 
victory over Fullerton last Oct. 8 and would set a school record for 
consecutive victories if it wins tonight. The Bulldogs' streak is the second 
longest in the nation in Division I-A to Notre Dame's 18. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno's offense, led by running backs Aaron Craver and Myron Jones, is 
averaging 42 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (3-3-1, 2-1) hasn't beaten Fresno State since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton running back Mike Pringle, who leads the nation in all-purpose 
running, needs 133 yards to become only the fourth Titan to rush for 1,000

<P>
PRESENT VALUE TO SHOW WHAT HE'S WORTH IN GOODWOOD TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Present Value, a 5-year-old bargain who cost his owners $160,000 nine months 
ago, has gone through the year proving to bettors that he's worth their 
support. And now, six stakes wins later, he will be asked to prove himself 
again against Rahy, a horse he beat two weeks ago, in today's $200,000 Goodwood 
Handicap at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Present Value has been favored in only two of his victories, which have come at 
six different tracks, and although he'll be coupled with two other horses 
because of an ownership overlap, he won't be the favorite again today. Rahy 
will still be the public's choice in the Goodwood -- just as he was, at 9-10, 
in the Ramser Handicap on Oct 7. 
</P>
<P>
Before the current Oak Tree season began, Neil Drysdale, who trains Rahy, 
thought that he'd need two races at Santa Anita to prepare the 4-year-old 
English import properly for the Breeders' Cup at Gulfstream Park two weeks from 
today. In the Ramser, which was Rahy's first start in almost three months, 
Drysdale's horse battled On the Line through brisk early fractions, then lost a 
stretch battle to Present Value, who was a half-length better at the wire. 
</P>
<P>
The Ramser was only the fifth start this year for Rahy, but two of the races 
were overpowering performances at a mile during the Hollywood Park meeting. He 
won them by a total of 15 lengths, in superb times of 1:33 4/5 and 1:33. The 
Goodwood is 1 1/8 miles, which is a sixteenth of a mile farther than the 
Ramser, and it will be the farthest Rahy has run on dirt in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Rahy carried four more pounds than Present Value the last time and he's two 
pounds heavier today. Present Value paid $15.20 in winning the Ramser, a nice 
mutuel but bagatelle compared to the $100.60 he returned while winning the 
Michigan Mile and One-Eighth in July. In the 40 years of that Detroit Race 
Course stake, only one winner has paid more. 
</P>
<P>
Present Value's other victories have come at Portland Meadows, Sportsman's 
Park, Arlington International and Canterbury Downs. The Canadian-bred son of 
Halo has earned almost $600,000 since he was purchased for his owners by 
trainer Jerry Fanning, who liked the looks of the horse when he was stabled in 
a barn next to his at Santa Anita last winter. 
</P>
<P>
Present Value won seven of 13 starts as a 3-year-old but last year he slipped 
to only one victory in eight tries. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye has picked up the mount on Present Value after Bill 
Shoemaker and Frank Olivares won with him earlier this year. Olivares is on 
crutches, the result of a spill at Fairplex Park last month, and Shoemaker is 
in Australia, plugging away at his marathon retirement tour. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens will be riding Rahy for the first time since they clicked off 
those two impressive victories at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron, who rode Rahy last time, was handed a five-day suspension by 
the stewards Friday, the result of a winning horse being disqualified for 
interference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
That suspension won't start until Wednesday, however, so McCarron will be able 
to ride On the Line and Winning Colors today at Aqueduct, and heavily favored 
Claire Marine, one of the best females he's ever ridden, in the $150,000 Las 
Palmas Handicap Sunday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Pat Valenzuela, who hasn't ridden since a week ago Friday when he called in 
sick with the flu, met with the Oak Tree stewards Friday and agreed to a 
drug-rehabilitation program. Valenzuela also submitted to a drug test, which 
takes 48 hours to analyze. He is expected to be tested again for drugs and, if 
the test isn't positive, could resume riding by late next week. A track 
official said that Chris McCarron might ride Sunday Silence in the $3-million 
Breeders' Cup Classic two weeks from today if trainer Charlie Whittingham 
doesn't stick with Valenzuela, who won both the Kentucky Derby and the 
Preakness with the colt. 
</P>
<P>
Steinlen, who won the Arlington Million in his last start, is running today in 
the 1 1/8-mile Keeneland Breeders' Cup on the grass. . . . Santa Anita will 
take bets today on the telecast of the Tanforan Handicap from Bay Meadows in 
San Mateo, Calif. The high weights are Delegant and Variety Road at 116 pounds 
apiece. . . . Three Santa Anita jockeys will be at Laurel Sunday for the 
Budweiser International: Gary Stevens will ride Fair Judgment, Fernando Toro

STUCK PUTS AUDI ON POLE TO KEEP TITLE CHANCES ALIVE

<P>
Hans Stuck, still nursing a slim hope of winning the GTO championship of the 
International Motor Sports Assn., will start on the pole in today's one-hour 
race for GTO and GTU cars at the Del Mar Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Stuck, a West German driver who has won seven of the 12 races he has entered, 
qualified his Audi 90 Quattro Friday at a record 83.878 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Stuck's problem is that he missed two endurance races, Daytona and Sebring, so 
he trails two Mercury Cougar drivers, Pete Halsmer and Wally Dallenbach Jr. by 
18 and nine points, respectively. Today's winner will collect 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
Dallenbach qualified second at 83.610 and Halsmer fourth at 82.961. 
</P>
<P>
"Having the pole is half of winning the race," Stuck said. "There will be 
strategy tomorrow. The car is great." 
</P>
<P>
Stuck has won the last four GTO races and five of the last six. 
</P>
<P>
The old GTO record around the 11-turn, 1.6-mile temporary circuit was 82.603 by 
Jack Baldwin in a Chevy Camaro in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
South African Wayne Taylor surprised his fellow GTP drivers by posting the 
quickest practice lap for the big prototypes. Taylor, 29, a former South Africa 
national champion, drove his Pontiac-powered Spice at 88.889 m.p.h. in the 
second of two 45-minute sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The GTP cars will qualify today for Sunday's two-hour Camel Grand Prix of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I love these street courses," Taylor said. "This is a very difficult course, 
very bumpy, but good to drive. This is only my second street race and third 
time in IMSA. I like it very much. I would like to drive the full IMSA season 
next year." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who left South Africa two years ago to live in England, finished fourth 
at LeMans in 1987 in a Porsche and last year drove in the European Group C 
competition with Costas Los. This season he drove for the Spice factory team in 
the world sports-prototype series. 
</P>
<P>
Chip Robinson, who leads the GTP standings, was second fastest at 88.466, and 
his Nissan teammate, defending GTP champion Geoff Brabham, was sixth at 87.460.

EL TORO SCORES EARLY, OFTEN IN VICTORY OVER DANA HILLS

<P>
Quarterback Steve Stenstrom passed for 271 yards and two touchdowns in the 
first half to lead El Toro High School to a 41-21 South Coast League victory 
over Dana Hills Friday at Mission Viejo High School. 
</P>
<P>
Stenstrom completed 11 of 15 passes in the first half, including a 57-yard 
touchdown pass to Reggie Watkins with 54 seconds left to give El Toro (7-0, 
2-0) a 28-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro Coach Bob Johnson removed Stenstrom early in the third quarter after 
the Chargers made it 34-0 lead on Jerome Oakman's 1-yard run. Stenstrom 
finished with 13 completions in 18 attempts for 277 yards. He was intercepted 
once. 
</P>
<P>
"I've said all along (that) Steve's the best quarterback in Orange County, and 
he shows it every week," Johnson said. "He gets better each game." 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills (5-2, 0-2) tried to slow El Toro's passing game by double-covering 
receiver Rob Johnson, Stenstrom's favorite target. That strategy left Rowe with 
single coverage, which he beat for five receptions totaling 107 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Kevin's a great receiver," Stenstrom said. "When teams double-team Rob, Kevin 
makes me look good because he always gets open." 
</P>
<P>
El Toro finished with 461 yards in total offense, including 101 rushing yards 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills quarterback Grant Taylor connected with Chris Morgan on a pair of 
24-yard touchdown passes in the second half. Taylor, who had only 14 yards 
passing at halftime, finished with 265 yards on 15-of-20 passing with one 
interception.

Trailing 16-0 at halftime, Troy High School quarterback Greg Windle threw three 
touchdown passes, including a 33-yard game-winner to Steve Friedrich with 1 
minute 33 seconds remaining, to give the Warriors a 20-16 Freeway League 
victory over Fullerton at Fullerton District Stadium Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Windle completed eight of 10 passes in the second half for 133 yards. Friedrich 
had two touchdown catches in the second half and finished with four receptions 
for 76 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (5-2, 1-1) scored first. With 7:30 remaining in the first quarter, 
quarterback Rene Arias hooked up with John Bailey on a 53-yard touchdown pass 
play. Arias, who completed 14 of 20 passes for 202 yards without an 
interception on the night, connected with Bailey again five minutes later for a 
17-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey capped Fullerton's scoring with a 39-yard field goal with 21 seconds 
remaining in the first half. The Indians went into halftime with the 16-0 lead 
after holding Troy to just 49 yards and two first downs in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
It reversed in the second half for Troy (4-3, 1-1) as the Warriors limited 
Fullerton to 34 yards and three first downs. 
</P>
<P>
Windle completed his first touchdown pass to Friedrich for 21 yards with 2:39 
left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of a personal foul penalty against Fullerton, Windle used just 
two plays to get Troy back in the end zone. He found tight end Chad Hartford 
for a 15-yard touchdown pass with 5:10 left in the game.

Buena Park High School accomplished something Friday night it hadn't done in 
six years: It won a Freeway League football game. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park (2-4 overall and 1-1 in league play) rallied for 21 second-half 
points to defeat Sonora, 21-13, at La Habra Stadium, ending Orange County's 
longest league losing streak at 28 games. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 7-0, in the third quarter, John Finohui tied the game for Buena Park 
on a one-yard touchdown run on the Coyotes' first possession of the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
After Sonora ran three plays and punted, Buena Park took its first lead when 
Chris Medina capped a 51-yard drive with a three-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Sonora (2-5, 0-2) cut the deficit to 14-13 on quarterback David Stack's 25-yard 
touchdown pass to Scott Sanders with 6:30 remaining in the game. But Lu Tasi 
blocked Ryan Lewis' extra point attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park put together a near-perfect 10-play, 69-yard drive that was 
culminated by Finohui's 26-yard touchdown run. RICH GUIREMAND

COLLINS' 149 YARDS, THREE TOUCHDOWNS HELP LOARA BURY KATELLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The past two seasons, Coy Collins, Loara High School running back, has watched 
Katella beat his team and prevent it from going to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, when Collins was a sophomore, he muttered to himself about 
paying back the debt, but as a junior he couldn't make good on his words 
because he was sidelined with an injured ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Collins finally got his chance Friday night at Glover Stadium, making the the 
most of it as he rushed for 149 yards, scored three touchdowns -- one on an 
80-yard punt return -- and led Loara to a 27-0 Empire League victory over 
Katella. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could have won only one game all year, I wanted it to be this game," 
Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
And he did just about everything on Loara's first drive to ensure just that. 
Starting on their own 41, the Saxons (6-0-1, 2-0) drove to the Katella 25 with 
Collins rushing three times for 25 yards. With a fourth-and-one, Collins got 
the ball and went left, broke through the Katella line, faked two defensive 
backs to the ground and dashed into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Collins would rush for 85 yards in 10 carries in the first half, but missed 
part of the second quarter with a sprained wrist. With him out, the Loara 
offense didn't go anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The Katella offense wasn't exactly standing still. It managed to get into Loara 
territory twice in its five first-half possessions, but each time Katella got 
close, the drive stalled. 
</P>
<P>
The first half ended with Loara leading, 7-0. The Saxons got the ball to begin 
the second half and started on another scoring drive. This one started from 
their own 35, and once again Collins, now wearing a protective pad on his left 
wrist, was the driving force. 
</P>
<P>
With Loara on the Katella 15, Collins, who rushed for 48 yards on the drive, 
once again went to his left. This time there was no need for fakes, the Loara 
offense virtually sealed up the entire Katella defense, and all that was left 
for Collins was to simply sprint the 15 yards for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Katella (0-2, 2-4-1) was forced to punt after the ensuing kickoff. Collins took 
the punt at his own 20, was hit, twirled, cut to the sideline, then back into 
the middle of the field and proceeded to run past every defender on his way to 
an 80-yard touchdown return. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest concern was not getting caught from behind," Collins said. "It was 
basically a run for life." 
</P>
<P>
Which sounds desperate. But Collins' play appeared anything but. He seemed able 
to break a play every time he got the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Things went well today," said Collins, who has rushed for 1,227 yards in seven 
games this season. "I'm satisfied. I'm very satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
Loara scored its last touchdown when Brett Banta caught a 14-yard scoring pass 
from Sean Conner in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Loara defense took care of everything else. Katella never got into Loara 
territory in the second half, being limited to only 31 yards over the last two 
quarters.

Western High School scored on five of its six first-half possessions to defeat 
Magnolia, 41-20, in an Orange League game Friday at Handel Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Western allowed Magnolia (0-2, 0-7) only eight yards total offense in the first 
half, holding the Sentinels scoreless until the final 3 minutes 17 seconds of 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"These kind of games are no fun; it is hard to keep things in perspective," 
Western Coach Jim Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
Halfback Barry Howell led Western to its sixth victory in seven games. The 
Pioneers are 2-0 in league play. Howell scored two touchdowns and gained 119 of 
Western's 324 total yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Magnolia running back Ariel Courvetier scored on runs of 35 and 44 yards. He 
gained 83 of the Sentinels' 105 yards rushing. BOB BORSUM

HERNANDEZ DOES IT ALL AS BREA-OLINDA RIPS ANAHEIM

Marco Hernandez is a scoring threat just about every time his foot or hands 
touch the football for Brea-Olinda High School. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, a sophomore kicker and tailback, who also triples as a defensive 
back, scored the Wildcats' first touchdown and kicked three extra points in a 
27-7 Orange League victory over Anaheim Friday night in front of 2,7000 at 
Brea. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez carried the ball only two times for 28 yards, including a 11-yard 
touchdown run with 7:57 remaining in the first half to give Brea-Olinda a 7-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week, we decided we had to start him (even though senior tailback Ed 
Stewart, a 1,000-yard rusher, was healthy)," Brea-Olinda Coach John Looney 
said. "(Hernandez) just makes things happen." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez also accounted for one of four interceptions thrown by Anaheim's Chad 
Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart led Brea-Olinda with 77 yards rushing and a touchdown early in the 
third quarter to give the Wildcats a 21-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda senior quarterback Chad Marlow passed for touchdowns of 43 and 23 
yards. The first went to tight end Jon Kobz and the second to wide receiver 
Ryan Nicholson, his fifth touchdown of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The victory evens the Wildcats league record at 1-1, and comes on the heels of 
their first defeat of the season to Western last week. Brea-Olinda is 6-1 
overall. Anaheim is 2-5 overall and 0-2 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
"We were 5-0, fat and happy," Looney said. "Western was 4-1 and hungry. (This 
week) we wanted to show what the kids were made of."

TUSTIN STANDS ITS GROUND, TOPS NEWPORT HARBOR

All that stood between Newport Harbor High School and the lead was about one 
foot. But with the score tied, 7-7, the ball inside Tustin's one-yard line and 
three downs to go before the end of the first half, Newport Harbor came away 
with nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin's goal-line defense held and Jason Rasmussen's 25-yard fourth-quarter 
field goal gave the Tillers a 10-7 victory in front of 550 at Newport Harbor's 
Davidson Field. 
</P>
<P>
"That goal line stance was the key part of the football game," Tustin Coach 
Marijon Ancich said. "Our defense bent a little bit, but when it came time, 
they played real good." 
</P>
<P>
Tustin (4-3, 1-1) drove 64 yards in 16 plays for the first score of the game, a 
four-yard pass from Andy Borza to Marion Hall late in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Newport quarterback Stephen Scheck then went to work. He drove the Sailors 66 
yards in 10 plays, completing four passes for 49 yards, to tie the score, 7-7, 
on Todd Farley's three-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin then fumbled the ball. Newport (5-2, 1-1) recovered on its 48 to set up 
the drive that fell short. Scheck completed three passes and, with the help of 
a pass interference call, advanced Newport to the three with less than a minute 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
On first and goal, Farley ran the ball to the one. He carried again for no 
gain. Then, on third down, Scheck tried a quarterback sneak but fumbled the 
ball. Newport recovered. Farley then attempted to run it up the middle, but the 
Tustin defense stacked him up with 30 seconds remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor Coach Jeff Brinkley said he never thought of going for a field 
goal. "You hope to God you can get a foot when you're down there," he said. . 
</P>
<P>
The Tiller defense allowed Newport a touchdown and 135 yards, most of it 
passing, in the first half, but in the second half it bore down, limiting 
Newport to 21 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin sacked Scheck four times for 32 yards. Three of those sacks came in the 
second half, two by junior Josh Beldon. Beldon, who usually plays special 
teams, was filling in for injured teammate Nick Cantu, who pulled a hamstring 
in practice this week. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin gained plenty of ground but couldn't get into the end zone. "We got 
ourselves down there, but then we short-circuited," Ancich said. After the 
goal-line stance, Tustin drove from its 16 to the Sailor 21 but, Rasmussen's 
39-yard field goal attempt fell short. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin quarterback Andy Borza completed nine of 13 passes for 109 yards and one 
touchdown. Scheck completed 16 of 22 passes for 157 yards and one interception.

BISHOP AMAT DOMINATES MATER DEI IN VICTORY

<P>
Bishop Amat High School showed its power in every aspect of the game Friday 
night with a 34-18 victory over Mater Dei in an Angelus League game in front of 
an estimated 7,000 at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers (3-3, 1-1) especially dominated on the ground, with fine 
performances from Motu Ili (103 yards and 2 touchdowns in 21 carries), Jess 
Holguin (73 yards in 7 carries) and Jason Patterson (49 yards, 6 carries). 
</P>
<P>
And although Mater Dei quarterback Danny O'Neil completed 21 of 32 passes for 
316 yards -- 252 in the second half -- it was good enough for just one 
touchdown, albeit a doozy, on a 62-yard play to Tino Chavez midway through the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
That play sparked the start of a rally for Mater Dei (3-4 overall, 1-1 in 
league play), but Bishop Amat's relentless defense fizzled the Monarchs' hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat took a 14-0 lead in the first quarter by simply outsmarting the 
Mater Dei defense. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat quarterback Zack Zertuche hit Jason Green on a 16-yard touchdown 
pass, and Ili scored on a one-yard run. Eric White's 27-yard field goal helped 
Bishop Amat to a 17-0 lead going into halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Zertuche completed 9 of 14 passes for 118 yards and 2 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei finally scored when O'Neil dove one yard in the third quarter. The 
Monarchs also scored in the fourth quarter on a one-yard run by Kealii 
Clifford. 
</P>
<P>
"This football team (Bishop Amat) is a good, good football team," Mater Dei 
Coach Bruce Rollinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't change anything I did tonight. I have to look back at the films. 
Basically, we just got hammered by a good football team. We were out of sync 
after they got up, 14-0." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei had the most difficulty stopping Ili, who continually frustrated the 
Monarch defense with spins off tackle for extra yardage. Ili, who went out in 
the second quarter with an ankle injury, returned in the third and immediately 
scored on a four-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat receiver Jeremy Smith, who caught five passes for 56 yards, also 
seemed to dazzle Mater Dei defenders. 
</P>
<P>
The game was delayed 25 minutes late in the fourth quarter when Bishop Amat 
defensive lineman Gerard Smith suffered an apparent head injury. He was taken 
to Western Medical Center in Santa Ana by paramedics.

Foothill High School won its second consecutive Century League game Friday 
night with a 19-14 victory over Canyon in front of 1,200 at Tustin High School. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon (2-5, 0-2) scored first after George Garcia wrested the ball from 
Foothill kickoff returner Ricky Robinson on the Foothill 30-yard line and 
returned it 22 yards to the 8. Three plays later, quarterback Chuck Nickerson 
scored from the one. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill (4-3, 2-0) tied the score with 4:13 left in the quarter when 
quarterback John Shanahan passed 10 yards to tight end Roman Slobodynskyj and 
Kent Donnelly kicked the extra point. 
</P>
<P>
Donnelly kicked two field goals in the second quarter, of 27 and then 43 yards, 
to make it 13-7 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill scored again with 7:26 left in the third quarter when Shanahan hit 
wide receiver Greg Clark with a three-yard pass for a 19-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon made it close with 3:30 remaining when Nickerson hit Lee Torres with a 
10-yard touchdown pass. VINCE AGUL

<P>
Regard led every step of the way, winning the Pocahontas Handicap by three 
quarters of a length Friday night at Los Alamitos Race Course. Cameron Aubin's 
bay filly by Moon Lark won her second stakes in a row and sixth of seven starts 
since returning to Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew she had to steal the lead going 400 yards," trainer Blane Schvaneveldt 
said. "I haven't run her 400 yards in a while. She's older now and she's 
developed and maybe her heart is bigger now." 
</P>
<P>
Regard defeated the favorite, Aqua Treasure, by three-quarters of a length, who 
was a half in front of 17-1 longshot Lil Bit Rusty. 
</P>
<P>
Regard paid $8.40 to win, $3.60 to place and $3 to show. Aqua Treasure paid 
$3.40 and $2.60. Lil Bit Rusty paid $4.80 to show.

RIVERSIDE VS. RANCHO SANTIAGO: BATTLE OF UNBEATENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A couple of impressive rankings and undefeated records are on the line tonight 
when Rancho Santiago College travels to Riverside for a Mission Conference 
Central Division game at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago (5-0 overall and 4-0 in conference play) is ranked second in 
Southland Poll and fifth in the J.C. Grid-Wire national poll. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside (5-0, 4-0) is third in the Southland Poll and eighth in the J.C. 
Grid-Wire national poll. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams come in with powerful offenses, but slightly different methods. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago is the state's best offensive team, averaging 459 yards and 
39.8 points a game. But the Dons have the sort of balance coaches always want 
but seldom get. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago is averaging 221.2 yards rushing, and 237.8 yards passing. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside is averaging 401.6 yards and 28.4 points a game, but there is little 
question the Tigers prefer the run. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside averages 244.4 yards rushing and only 157.2 yards passing. 
</P>
<P>
In tonight's other Mission Conference Central Division games: 
</P>
<P>
Golden West (3-2, 3-1) at Fullerton (3-2, 2-2), 7 p.m. -- Fullerton has a 13-3 
record against Golden West and hasn't lost to the Rustlers since the 1977 
Avocado Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West has been improving its rushing game each week thanks to better 
blocking and the work of sophomore running back Sean Cheatham. Cheatham has 470 
yards, and has rushed for more than 100 yards three times this season. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, running against Fullerton will be a challenge. Fullerton has the 
top-ranked rushing defense in the 16-team conference. Fullerton is allowing 
61.8 yards a game. Fullerton is second in the conference in total defense, 
allowing 245 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast (4-1, 3-1) at Saddleback (1-4, 1-3), 7 p.m. -- Orange Coast has 
been getting better each week thanks in part to the improvement of freshman 
quarterback Greg Angelovic. He doubled his touchdown total for the season with 
three last week in a 34-7 victory over San Diego Mesa. Angelovic has only one 
interception this season. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback has been searching for a consistent quarterback, with John Barnes 
and Jeff Bailey alternating. But Bailey was impressive in relief of Barnes 
against Pasadena last week and will get the start tonight.

NEW PBS CHIEF TO TARGET A NEW AUDIENCE; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: JENNIFER LAWSON WILL BE THE FIRST BLACK TO HOLD THE TOP PROGRAMMING 
SPOT AT A MAJOR NETWORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jennifer Lawson, the new programming chief of the Public Broadcasting Service, 
said Friday that she aims "to rethink public television for a new generation of 
viewers" and provide programs that more accurately reflect the multicultural 
diversity of the country. 
</P>
<P>
When she takes over as PBS' executive vice president for national programming 
and promotion services at the end of November, Lawson, 43, will oversee all the 
program and promotion services of PBS, becoming the first black to hold the top 
programming position at a major network. In a phone interview Friday, Lawson 
said it is time "to bring a new generation into public broadcasting, both as 
viewers and as members." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson, who has worked for the past nine years at the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting, applauded "Sesame Street" and other PBS children's programming 
for continuing to surprise viewers with their emphasis on bilingualism and 
cultural variety, and said she would like to see the rest of PBS' programming 
to be as striking, as educational and as entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
Though she could not give specific examples, she said she was also looking to 
update "the look and style" of PBS programs and would encourage producers to be 
more inventive with the television form. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no intention of turning public television into MTV," she said, "but I 
look forward to working with producers to examine how people use television and 
how they get their information. Usually PBS offers information in the 
documentary form. Now we might consider something quite different and offer 
viewers a greater variety of formats." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson, currently the director of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting's 
Television Program Fund, was named Thursday to succeed Suzanne Weil, who 
resigned last fall to take a position with Robert Redford's Sundance Institute 
in Utah. But Lawson was given a new title that embraces promotion, reflecting 
her contention that telling people what is available on public television is as 
important as the programs themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many people are unaware of what we're doing," she said. "There is a large 
potential audience out there for us to tap, but in the past, people haven't 
watched because they didn't know what was on." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson is moving from the Corporation of Public Broadcasting to PBS just as 
Congress, the corporation and PBS are trying to resolve a dispute over which 
organization should be in charge of spending the more than $200 million in 
federal funds that are allocated to public television each year. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, CPB, which initially receives the entire federal allocation for 
public broadcasting funds, has allocated much of it to the more than 300 
individual public-television stations nationwide, which in turn channel some of 
that to PBS for the production of national programming. CPB, whose board is 
appointed by the President, has also kept millions itself to fund certain 
programs directly. 
</P>
<P>
After complaints from independent producers and minority groups, Congress last 
year re-examined this process and the Senate recommended cutting CPB out of 
programming entirely. Eventually, Congress compromised and asked PBS, CPB and 
the PBS lobbying group, the National Association of Public Television Stations, 
to work out an agreement on who will get to spend the programming funds. No 
decision has been finalized, but it is expected that PBS will wind up with the 
bulk of the money. Lawson said that talks are progressing "quite amicably" 
between all the parties. 
</P>
<P>
"I do think that we are at a point where there is a desire for more centralized 
programming leadership," Lawson said of the expected windfall for PBS. "There 
is an interest in putting public broadcasting in the position to make faster, 
easier decisions about programming so that we can end up with the look that we 
want. I hope that my experience in knowing CPB will be useful in helping to 
provide a bridge and greater coordination in our programing." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson has worked in the CPB's Television Program Fund, which supports major 
series and specials, since 1980. Before that, she was executive director of the 
Film Fund, a New York City foundation that funded independent films and videos 
on social issues. Lawson said that her work with this foundation makes her feel 
comfortable with the rough-and-tumble politics she might have to face at PBS, 
which, as with the recent documentary "Days of Rage," often comes under fire 
for the presentation of controversial programs. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson has also taught film production at Brookly College in New York City. Her 
husband, Anthony Gittens, is the executive director of the Washington 
International Film Festival.

POP BEAT: GUNS N' ROSES SHOWS SOME METTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Axl made the gig. Clapton joined the Stones. "Angie" entered the repertoire. 
Living Colour jumped into the Great Guns N' Roses bigotry debate. 
</P>
<P>
Those were the main twists on Thursday, the second night of the Rolling 
Stones-Guns N' Roses-Living Colour four-show stand at the Los Angeles Memorial 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The question on most people's minds going in wasn't what color Mick Jagger's 
jacket would be, but whether Guns N' Roses would play at all, after singer Axl 
Rose's declaration during the previous night's show that he was through with 
the band because of some members' excessive drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, when GNR hit the stage on Thursday, Rose wasn't up there with the 
four musicians. What was up? Was the group trying to carry on without its 
charismatic leader? Before the music even started, lead guitarist Slash asked 
for the crowd's attention and launched into an extended discourse on the perils 
of drugs, admitting the group's transgressions but concluding, "Guns N' Roses 
is not gonna be a band that falls apart because of it." 
</P>
<P>
With that, Rose strode from the rear of the stage into the spotlight, to be 
greeted by a welcoming roar from the approximately 72,000 people on hand. After 
thanking Slash -- who was wearing a Betty Ford Clinic T-shirt -- for his 
statement, Rose the singer said, "I'd like to apologize for my actions and 
comments last night. I just didn't want to see my friends slip away." 
</P>
<P>
In the fiery set that followed, Rose and company were on their best behavior. 
He didn't fall off the stage, as he did Wednesday; he didn't dig himself deeper 
into racial controversy, as he did Wednesday, and he even thanked the Rolling 
Stones for having them on the show. 
</P>
<P>
You've got to hand it to a band that not only throws its tantrums in front of 
the multitudes, but turns them into high psychodrama and squeezes every 
possible drop of ink from them. (A source close to the band strenuously denied 
that the "breakup" was a publicity ploy. "There has been real tension in the 
band," the source said Friday. "The only thing that surprised me was that Axl 
went public with it. It might have been the pressure of the big engagement.") 
</P>
<P>
The Stones wrote the book on that kind of thing in their early days, but now 
that they're an entertainment institution, no such scenarios are likely to be 
played out in their well-oiled "Steel Wheels" show. If you wanted spontaneity 
Thursday, you had to be thankful for small favors, like a brief microphone 
failure at the start of "Mixed Emotions" that proved that all the players up 
there were awake. 
</P>
<P>
Things were a millimeter looser Thursday, as Jagger did more bouncing off the 
other musicians, at one point wrapping the stoic bassist Bill Wyman in a 
makeshift wrestling hold. Set-list archivists note: "Angie" replaced "Play With 
Fire" in the show's slow-song segment, and Keith Richards inserted "Before They 
Make Me Run" before "Happy" in his spotlight turn. 
</P>
<P>
The clear highlight for the audience came during the opening bars of Willie 
Dixon's "Little Red Rooster," the slide-guitar slow blues they recorded in 
1964. The video screens above the stage suddenly showed a close-up of 
un-introduced guest guitarist and fellow graybeard Eric Clapton, eliciting a 
mighty roar of recognition from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The Thursday concert began with another installment in the Issue That Won't Go 
Away: Guns N' Roses alleged bigotry. The band has been under serious fire for 
the racial and sexual epithets in the song "One in a Million," which they 
haven't been performing at the Coliseum. At the start of Wednesday's show, Rose 
tried to justify their use as social realism and deny that he is a racist, but 
once again revealed a profound obliviousness to the inflammatory nature of the 
language. Rose's Thursday apology didn't appear to cover those comments. 
</P>
<P>
Living Colour, the black, New York-based hard-rock band that has been at the 
forefront of attacking racism in rock, didn't have anything to say on the 
matter Wednesday, but on Thursday guitarist Vernon Reid stepped to his 
microphone and said, "It's been cool on this tour opening for the Stones, but 
some things were said on this stage last night that I have a problem with. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't have a problem with gay people, don't call them (epithet). If you 
don't have a problem with black people, don't call them (epithet). I haven't 
met a (epithet) in my life." 
</P>
<P>
The Stones and their supporting sideshow play the Coliseum today and Sunday at 
5 p.m. The headliners sing "It's only rock 'n' roll," but it's obviously more 
than that. 
</P>
<P>
LIVE ACTION: Expose and Young M.C. are set for the Universal Amphitheatre on 
Nov. 10. Tickets on sale Sunday. . . . Also on sale Sunday for the Universal 
are Squeeze (Dec. 11), Joan Baez (Dec. 16) and second nights for both the

will be at the Santa Monica Civic on Nov. 25. On sale Sunday. . . . L.A. Guns 
heads a bill at the Hollywood Palladium on Nov. 24.

'1789': A REVOLUTION ON A SMALL SCALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If an American director who admired Peter Brook's work set out to do his own 
version of Brook's production of "The Mahabharata" at a small Los Angeles 
theater, one would wish him good luck, while entertaining some doubts about the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The same doubts attend Paul Verdier's English-language premiere of Ariane 
Mnouchkine's "1789" at the Las Palmas Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Verdier's intentions are utterly honorable, and his production, within its 
limits, is not a disgrace. Moreover, the project has the blessing of Mnouchkine 
and her Theatre du Soleil. (Some of the original costumes are used.) There is 
no question of a rip-off here. This is a labor of love, if ever Los Angeles 
theater has seen one. 
</P>
<P>
And it does give some sense of what the original 1970 production may have been 
like -- particularly if the viewer can piece out his ignorance with memories of 
the Theatre du Soleil's Shakespeare performances at the Olympic Arts Festival 
in 1984. The players putting on their whiteface makeup, the percussionists to 
the side, the combination of commedia dell'arte movement and stentorian 
language, the delicately worked costumes -- we remember all that. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from its value as a theatrical reconstruction, this "1789" does address a 
subject that almost no American theater (let alone Los Angeles theater) has had 
anything to say about during this bicentennial year: the French Revolution. And 
it says something interesting about it. "The people" lost the Revolution almost 
immediately to the people with money. Where most chronicles argue that the 
Revolution went too far, the suggestion here is that it didn't go far enough: 
that there remains work to do. 
</P>
<P>
All that admitted, "1789" is not comfortably sited at the Las Palmas Theatre, a 
small house made even smaller by the addition of playing spaces scattered 
around the theater. If there is anything clear about the performance style of 
the piece, it is that it was designed to project -- to conquer a large space, 
such as the Theatre du Soleil's theater on the outskirts of Paris, a converted 
bullet factory. 
</P>
<P>
In a large space, the production's physicality -- the tumbling, the puppet 
shows, the booths, the processions, the long entrances and exits -- was 
presumably thrilling, conveying both the majesty (and mock majesty) of royalty 
and the force of the mob. 
</P>
<P>
Under a low ceiling, it makes for a cramped, in-your-face kind of evening -- 
rather like trying to cram the Rose Parade onto the aisle of a bus. Verdier had 
originally conceived this as an outdoor production. It might have been wise to 
stick to that plan, even if the show did get rained out once or twice. 
</P>
<P>
There is also the awareness that, deft as some of Verdier's actors are (the 
production is bravely spoken and not clumsy on its feet), we are watching an 
imitation of a production designed for another time and place. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't to say the material examined here is irrelevant to America in '89. 
Anything but. Take a walk down Hollywood Boulevard after the show and see the 
beggars. Verdier also splices in a telling image from the recent student 
uprisings in China, another example of a revolution devouring its young. 
</P>
<P>
Stylistically, however, this "1789" has nothing to do with us. All the worse 
for us, perhaps. But mock commedia has no roots in the American experience. At 
the Las Palmas, we are watching a slide show from another culture, and not a 
very authoritative one. Verdier himself doesn't know how "1789" worked with a 
live audience: He has only seen the film version. 
</P>
<P>
The result has energy and intelligence, but it is apprentice-work next to the 
thing it is emulating. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and this 
production is a painfully sincere homage to a great theater company. But in 
theater, perhaps it's better that people do their own work. 
</P>
<P>
One actor in the company finds a way to make the play his business. His name is 
Hawthorne James. He reads the speeches of Marat with the bitterness of a 
revolutionary who once had pity for the privileged, but has drilled himself out 
of it. He would have graced the original company of "1789" -- and even more, of 
its sequel, "1793." 
</P>
<P>
Plays at 1642 N. Las Palmas Ave., Hollywood, through Nov. 12. Performances 
Wednesdays-Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 7 p.m., with Saturday matinees at 2 
p.m. Tickets $20-$24; (213) 465-1010.

TOUGH-TALKING COMEDIAN TURNS OUT TO BE A PUSSYCAT

NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first blush, comedian Joe Yannetty comes across as one of those 
tough-talking Italian guys -- sufficiently long on street-wise attitude that 
push might come to a lot more than shove, pal. 
</P>
<P>
But eventually it becomes clear that beneath the brusque exterior is a 
gen-u-ine sweetheart, the proverbial pussycat. Those conflicting traits make 
Yannetty an enormously engaging storyteller -- but also prevented him from 
having as good a set as he deserved Thursday at the Laff Stop in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the show, he occasionally interspersed his tales with brief greetings 
or questions to members of the crowd; later, some in the crowd took this as a 
sign that they should feel free to indiscriminately holler lame comments, break 
into small discussion groups, or jump on stage and scoot past Yannetty into a 
newly vacated seat in the front row. 
</P>
<P>
True story. 
</P>
<P>
Even allowing for the very real possibility that there were some bona fide 
goofballs in the house, the duality of Yannetty's persona may have encouraged 
this behavior. The more his nice-guy side surfaced -- the more apparent it 
became that the rude and/or odd folks were going to be handled with kid gloves 
and bemused charm -- the more control of the show he relinquished. 
</P>
<P>
The situation demanded that Yannetty assert himself early on: a little earnest 
tough talk, a few razor-sharp phrases to squelch the Chatty Contingent might 
have reminded the audience that he was in charge, that he was running the show. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, his authority slipped so far away that the black-clad woman who 
bounded across the stage later felt comfortable initiating a dialogue with her 
former party (and we do mean party) across the room -- which she then decided 
to rejoin by clomping across the stage again. 
</P>
<P>
True story II -- -- every Fellini-esque detail. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of stories, Yannetty sort of compounded these unfortunate 
circumstances by launching into additional long ones, pushing the set length 
beyond an hour. It's probably not a good idea to prolong an increasingly 
hellish show. The prudent thing might have been for Yannetty to utter his 
pithiest joke and depart at the 45-minute mark (assuming the Galloping Gal 
wouldn't mind his traveling across her stage.) 
</P>
<P>
Still, even though he blew the call by trying to carry on with a show that 
clearly had gotten away from him and was hurtling into the Twilight Zone, you 
could understand why he tried spinning more yarns: Under the right 
circumstances, he's quite good at it. 
</P>
<P>
He telegraphed this from the get-go Thursday. One of his first anecdotes dealt 
with flying -- perhaps the most over-explored topic in stand-up -- and it 
turned out to be fresh and clever. At one point, he recounted being told by a 
stewardess that he was prohibited from wearing his Walkman headphones during 
takeoff and landing. When he asked her why, she replied "In case of an 
emergency you have to be able to hear us over the loudspeaker." 
</P>
<P>
Yannetty didn't quite buy this. "What could possibly go wrong on an airplane 
that I would not be able to surmise there was a problem, because I had 
headphones on? If I see the guy in front of me get sucked out the roof, I 
pretty much don't want to listen to that tune anymore. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
From there, he segued into a bit that not only offered the same kind of 
innovative execution but involved a more unusual topic: the tribulations of 
planning a wedding. For instance, in selecting an invitation and the 
accompanying envelopes, "they bring you a book the size of the first draft of 
the Bible." 
</P>
<P>
Fiancee: "Do you like this one?" 
</P>
<P>
Yannetty: "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
Fiancee: "Do you like that one?" 
</P>
<P>
Yannetty: "It's beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Fiancee: "(How about) that one?" 
</P>
<P>
Yannetty: "I love it." 
</P>
<P>
Fiancee: "You're just saying you like every one." 
</P>
<P>
Yannetty: "Exactly." 
</P>
<P>
"Like someone's going to come up to you in the receiving line at the wedding, 
going 'Joe, this place is great. The food was fantastic. The band is 
phenomenal. But those envelopes (stink!) How could you pick a stupid color like 
that?' No, people open it up, they go 'Hey, look, it's pink inside -- throw 
that away.' " 
</P>
<P>
Yannetty also bemoaned the staggering expense of getting married, which 
required him and wife to take out a loan. "My wedding cost the equivalent of a 
27-foot sportfishing boat. I got this," he complained, pointing to his rather 
simple wedding band. "Oh, (my wife) got a nice ring. She's got the first 22 
feet of that boat. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
There were plenty more gripes about the whole knot-tying process -- though, 
again, we'd wager that this matrimonial curmudgeon is actually an absolute doll 
to his wife -- just as there were plenty more stories about various members of 
his family; about the Volvo 760 Turbo Wagon (which supposedly "goes 160 m.p.h. 
. . . Who needs a station wagon that does 160? Who is this for -- women who are 
always late getting the kids to school?"), and about recently visiting a 
petting zoo that had alligators. 
</P>
<P>
Distinctive, witty and entertaining as most of his stories are, some don't have 
the payoff to merit their length. Still, Yannetty is a refreshing monologuist 
with tremendous promise. If he creates more tales equal to his strongest ones, 
trims the weaker ones -- and develops a more effective way of dealing with rude 
patrons and weird circumstances -- there's no question he will become a 
standout stand-up. 
</P>
<P>

Newport Beach. Showtimes: 8, 10 and 11:45 p.m. Saturday, 8:30 p.m. Sunday.

ANOTHER KEY PLAYER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Randy Lewis' feature on Dodger Stadium organist Nancy Hefley ("Career Takes Her 
Out to Ballgame a Lot," Calendar, Sept. 24) was a welcome piece of light 
reading. It was almost as relentlessly upbeat as the cheerful lady in the 
Dodgers' music chair, but one piece of history must be corrected: Ms. Hefley is 
the fifth person to hold the key position since the Dodgers moved west, after 
Bob Mitchell, Chauncey Haines, Don Beamsley and Helen (the Iron Woman) Dell, 
who is without question the Lou Gehrig of ballpark organists.

TULIS MCCALL TELLS THE STORY OF WOMANKIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those who wonder what makes people leave their houses and pay money to sit in a 
room with an actor are advised to go to the West Coast Ensemble, where Tulis 
McCall is performing her own script, "What Everywoman Knows." For actors, 
McCall's show will be a clinic in the art. For the rest of the audience, it 
will be little short of a communion. 
</P>
<P>
When everything else is stripped away, it is communion -- between actor and 
audience, actor and text -- that we want from the live event. As McCall's play 
continually reminds us, this is a very ancient desire, almost instinctual. 
</P>
<P>
It's as old as the clan huddled around a fire at night, listening to the 
storyteller in the group. McCall's character, Everywoman, in a pretty peasant 
dress and shawl, is updated to a timeless American rural context with nothing 
more than a cane and rocking chair as props. But she presents herself as 
nothing more than a storyteller, telling nothing less than the story of 
womankind. 
</P>
<P>
A big task, but this is a smart, clever woman. She is smart enough to keep her 
stories short and to a minimum -- the Adam and Eve tale, of course, plus 
portraits of four extraordinary 19th-Century American women: presidential 
candidate Victoria Woodhull, birth control advocate Margaret Sanger, Jane 
Canary Hickok (a.k.a. Calamity Jane) and former slave and suffragette Sojourner 
Truth. She is clever enough to know that she doesn't have to sell herself to 
us. "I was born talkin', and I believe that if you do somethin' well, you 
should do it a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Few characters talk as well as Everywoman. The intriguing twist is that, as a 
part of her universal identity, she vocally blends all the American dialects 
together. At first, your ear senses either an odd speech impediment or a 
foreign accent. Then you're amazed at McCall's technical chops. Then you just 
sit back and listen. 
</P>
<P>
If this wasn't done so well, it would be just a gimmick for an actress to play 
some historical figures. And it isn't as if we need to know more about some of 
them (the superb "Wes and Jane Show" at the Itchey Foot provides a rich precis 
on Calamity). What McCall and director Joanna Kerns have managed is a show that 
suggests women in a cosmic firmament, revealed to us by a very earthy time 
traveler. 
</P>
<P>
The link between these women is their need to buck the trend. Woodhull thought 
she was good enough to run for the White House, so she did. Sanger saw no 
reason why women had to resort to coat hangers, pinhooks and alleyways to 
prevent unwanted children, so she assisted them. Jane liked horses and guns and 
adventure, so she found it. Sojourner freed herself from slavery, so she 
thought women should stop talking and free themselves too. 
</P>
<P>
The portraits and presentation have the directness and austere yet approachable 
simplicity of a Whistler painting. The difference here is that these images 
talk back to you, and when it's over, you don't want to leave the room. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6240 Hollywood Blvd., on Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 3 
p.m. Runs indefinitely. Tickets: $12-$15; (213) 466-1767.

WATANABE: POINT MAN FOR JAPAN'S FUSION FORAY IN U.S.; 
</P>
<P>
POP: THE GUITARIST IS A TECHNICAL MARVEL WHO IS HAVING AN IMPACT ON YOUNG 
PLAYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Japanese are coming! The Japanese are coming! 
</P>
<P>
What's that? A little late, you say? They're already here? 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe when it comes to cars and videos and cameras and computers, but 
jazz fusion? Can it be that the celebrated Japanese capacity to create copies 
that are better than the original also applies to contemporary improvisation? 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Kazumi Watanabe thinks the answer is yes. And he's got the earlier 
track record of such performers as Toshiko Akiyoshi, Sadao Watanabe (no 
relation), Tiger Okoshi and Sleepy Matsumoto, as well as the prospective 
emergence of a host of new young players to prove his point. 
</P>
<P>
Watanabe, who performs at At My Place in Santa Monica tonight with his trio, is 
a technical marvel, the kind of high-voltage performer who draws crowds of 
young guitarists to all his gigs. 
</P>
<P>
"He's already a major influence," said Jim Snowden, president of Mesa/Blue Moon 
Records, the company that releases Watanabe's Gramavision recordings. "He may 
not be well known yet to the larger pop audience, but you can bet he's having 
an impact on a bunch of young players." 
</P>
<P>
Watanabe, himself, is a bit more modest about his expectations, despite having 
been chosen Guitarist of the Year nine times by Japan's "Swing Journal." 
</P>
<P>
"Audiences in Tokyo and Osaka are about the same as audiences in the United 
States," he said last week. "They want to hear good music with a lot of 
improvisation. My kind of playing has more followers in Japan than here, but 
it's not a big as Michael Jackson. For me, the size of the audience doesn't 
matter. The important thing is just to be able to play my music, anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Tokyo in 1953, Watanabe started out on piano at the age of 12, but soon 
switched instruments. "I was around 14" he said, "when I heard a friend of mine 
playing guitar. As soon as I heard it I said to myself, 'This is it! This is 
for me!' " 
</P>
<P>
By the time he was 17, Watanabe's skills, already remarkable, were displayed on 
his first recording. A host of releases followed, and by the early '80s, he was 
recording with the likes of Marcus Miller, Omar Hakim, David Sanborn and 
Michael Brecker. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really a musician's musician," said Snowden. "But the thing that makes 
him so special is that, even with all the power he generates from his guitar, 
he's a beautiful melodic player, as well." 
</P>
<P>
It's taken Watanabe a while to reach the maturity of tempering his electronic 
wizardry with the more subtle powers of his native tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started to play rock and jazz," he said, "I thought only about Western 
music. I didn't listen to Japanese music at all. But now, for the last couple 
of years, I've been thinking about where I come from, about the music of my 
country. Japanese music has a very large range, and now I try to bring some of 
that to my playing." 
</P>
<P>
Other Japanese musicians have followed a similar path. Many of Toshiko 
Akiyoshi's best compositions, for example, blend Eastern scales with Western 
rhythms. Keiko Matsui, a younger keyboardist-composer, has managed to find a 
surprisingly convincing linkage between rhythm &amp; blues, rock and jazz 
improvisation, while the group Hiroshima (from Hawaii) has long included a koto 
as part of its basic sound patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Becker, an American composer who lived in Japan for nearly fifteen years, 
feels that this process of cultural transformation is common to Japanese 
artists as they interface with Western influences. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything that comes into Japan," he said, "jazz, rock, contemporary classical, 
whatever, first gets lost in murkiness and then is accepted into the culture. 
Then, slowly, it finally comes out as something Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just bring something in and have it be accepted as it is. It must 
first come in, go through a metamorphosis and then emerge as something 
Japanese. They kind of reinvent the thing and in the process make it their own. 
I mean, it's the same thing they've done with cars and stereos." 
</P>
<P>
Is it really too far-fetched, then, to expect a wave of improvisational 
performers such as Watanabe to come pouring across the Pacific in the '90s? 
Probably so. Making music, after all, is not quite the same as producing an 
efficient turbocharged engine. 
</P>
<P>
But if the playing of Watanabe is any indication, Japan will certainly be 
providing a healthy share of the music that closes out the century. Because, 
like all artists, the essence of his work transcends its cultural source. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my goals," Watanabe said, "is to find a key that will open the box of 
the mysteries of the world. You know, music has many different chambers and 
places. I think that the answers to all the questions -- like 'Why are we 
here?' and 'What is life about?' -- can be found in music. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, music isn't just an empty diversion. To me, it's the key to the 
universe."

<P>
POP: THOMAS MAPFUMO'S CHIMURENGA MUSIC INSPIRED THE INDEPENDENCE WAR IN 
ZIMBABWE. HE HASN'T SLOWED UP. 
</P>

<P>
Creating outlaw music that affects the social and political order is a romantic 
notion that's fueled many an activist pop performer. But for Zimbabwe's Thomas 
Mapfumo, that rock dream was reality. 
</P>
<P>
Mapfumo, who makes his local debut today at the Music Machine, pioneered the 
chimurenga style that was credited with inspiring the guerrilla forces during 
their battle against Prime Minister Ian Smith's white government. The armed 
struggle in the nation -- then known as Rhodesia -- began in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
About 1974, Mapfumo began releasing singles in Zimbabwe that used traditional 
proverbs and doubled-edged lyrics to push the rebel cause. After his "Hokoyo" 
album was released in 1976, authorities viewed Mapfumo as such a threat that 
they banned the album and slapped him in detention for three months without 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
"My music, the militant lyrics in it, started driving the people away from the 
Western sound," said Mapfumo in a recent phone interview from Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to be themselves and be called Zimbabweans, so they were rallying 
behind my music. That's what got me into problems with the Smith government. 
They kept sending people from the special police branch asking questions about 
my music. I kept saying the music was the traditional music of the people of 
Zimbabwe. It was part and parcel of my culture, and I would not do away with 
this type of music, because it was my culture." 
</P>
<P>
Mapfumo was released and had to weather repeated efforts by the government to 
sabotage his credibility. But he didn't back off from the chimurenga sound, and 
after Zimbabwe achieved independence in 1980, he was acknowledged as the father 
of the nation's modern music and the chief influence on groups like the Bhundu 
Boys, which have gained exposure in Europe and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Cultural identity had been a longstanding concern for Mapfumo, 41, whose music 
adapts the mbira style of the Shona people to electric instruments. 
</P>
<P>
"Time was running out on me because I was growing but without my own thing," 
said the singer, who began his chimurenga experiments in 1973. "I kept saying 
to myself, 'Why am I chasing after these foreign sounds? Haven't I got 
something of my own, something that can be called Zimbabwean?' " 
</P>
<P>
The mbira music that is the traditional cornerstone of Mapfumo's style is 
played at religious rituals summoning ancestral spirits. Its central 
instrument, a thumb piano, is also called the mbira. Mapfumo's hybrid is a 
rough yet lulling sound built on choppy, interlocking guitar parts and loping 
rhythms punctuated by bright horn lines. 
</P>
<P>
"Mbira music is what we call the sacred music of the Shona people," Mapfumo 
said. "The music has been modernized so it's not the raw mbira sound you hear 
from the real instrument. 
</P>
<P>
The release of "The Chimurenga Singles," a compilation of his late-'70s 
singles, by Britain's Earthworks label in 1983, established Mapfumo on the 
international scene. Several more albums for Earthworks and Rough Trade and 
some critically acclaimed European tours with his Blacks Unlimited band 
cemented his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"Corruption," scheduled for release by Island Records next week, will be 
Mapfumo's first album for a major label. The end of his homeland's liberation 
struggle didn't lessen the militant tenor of his lyrics nor his commitment to a 
one-world vision reminiscent of the late Bob Marley. 
</P>
<P>
"We still call the music chimurenga because our music today is the voice of the 
poor back home," he said. "There are a lot of people suffering, so we, as 
musicians all over the world, must be united. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be rock 'n' roll, or chimurenga music, juju music or music from Fela 
Kuti, but we all have to unite and sing about one thing -- peace, love, justice 
and equality."

BURRELL, BRADFORD AT INDIGO CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Indigo Jazz Club at the Compton Lazben Hotel is now presenting -- surprise! 
-- jazz. With guitarist Kenny Burrell and singer Clea Bradford sharing the 
bill, the show is doubly delectable. It's a needed change of pace after last 
week's false start with Charmaine Neville. 
</P>
<P>
Burrell has long been the epitome of fluency and taste. Whether stringing out 
imaginative lines on "Secret Love" or indulging in rich chordal sequences on 
"Autumn Leaves," he reflects many influences while remaining his own man. 
</P>
<P>
His sound is clean and clear, though when he switched to acoustic guitar for 
"My Ship" there were problems with the sound equipment. For those sitting close 
enough to ignore the mike, this graceful Kurt Weill melody took on a 
rejuvenated luster. 
</P>
<P>
"Mood Indigo" was a particularly apt choice in view of the club's name and 
Burrell's decade-long tenure as teacher of Duke Ellington's music at UCLA. 
During the second chorus Clea Bradford joined him in a happy collaboration that 
continued through the set. 
</P>
<P>
A tall, commanding presence, long absent from these parts -- she now lives in 
Washington -- Bradford moved seamlessly from smoky contralto tones to 
unexpected high-note finales. Her phrasing and use of dynamic contrasts are 
exceptional. She is, in effect, a human volume control. 
</P>
<P>
The Burrell-Bradford partnership continues through Sunday. LEONARD FEATHER

CBS AIRS MOVIE ON CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE

<P>
A parent in "Do You Know the Muffin Man?," a CBS movie about mass molestation 
at the Tiny Tots preschool, can't compute all the danger signs of sexual abuse: 
"There's gotta be a reasonable explanation." 
</P>
<P>
There's an explanation, as we learn, but the concept of "reasonable" doesn't 
stretch far enough to make sense for reasonable people. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that our community is absorbed by the events, or non-events, at our 
own McMartin Pre-School and its legendary trial (now plodding toward an end) 
makes this concocted drama all the more curious for us. It airs Sunday at 9 
p.m. on Channels 2 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
"Muffin Man" writer and co-producer Daniel Freudenberger borrows heavily from 
the McMartin transcript -- an evolving sense among parents that something's 
wrong, very probable physical evidence, many parents "in denial," supposed 
mutilated animals and odd rituals, uneasy testimony by tots, anguished parents 
taking their traumatized children out of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
This production is well acted (Pam Dawber and John Shea as the folks and a 
winning young boy, Brian Bonsall, playing their son); it's well-enough directed 
by Gil Cates (except for some heavy-handed characterizations, like Tony Geary's 
oozing defense attorney); the scenes are nicely lit and neatly photographed. 
But this is faint praise. 
</P>
<P>
While "Muffin Man" may not scream like exploitation, it tries so hard to define 
the evil that it all comes out too easy in black and white -- some might say 
dangerously easy. Plots are contrived. Kids don't talk like that. Courtrooms 
don't happen like that. 
</P>
<P>
The producers try to cover too much of this tricky territory. Even giving all 
hands the benefit of doubts, the subject demands more careful handling. No 
cigar. 
</P>
<P>
(For viewers "in crisis," the network will display the national child abuse hot 
line number -- (800) 4 A CHILD -- from Child Help. The National Center for 
Missing and Exploited Children, (800) 843-5678, also will take calls for people 
wanting a pamphlet on "How to Choose Day Care." It was produced for an upcoming 
ABC film, "Unspeakable Acts," which details a grim, true-life preschool scandal 
in Country Walk, Fla.) IRV LETOFSKY

RENOVATED 'ADAM-12' ON CABLE LAYS DOWN THE LAW

<TEXT>
<P>
Has it been that long? The "old" "Adam-12" ran from 1968-75, and now coppers 
Martin Milner and Kent McCord are together again, this time promoted to civvies 
and moved to Nashville, Tenn., with brand new identities but the old business. 
</P>
<P>
"Nashville Beat," a Nashville-shot movie that unashamedly begs for series 
status, premiers tonight at 6 on cable's Nashville Network. This would be TNN's 
first creation of a dramatic series. 
</P>
<P>
The "boys" were old LAPD partners. Brian (Milner) now is a captain on the 
Nashville force, teamed with ever-suffering cop-wife Kate (Rosemary Forsyth), 
and Mike (McCord) is an L.A. detective who tracks a drug gang to Nashville, 
where it aims to open a franchise. 
</P>
<P>
McCord, who is a co-executive producer, has taken most of the interesting 
shtick and "smart" lines for his Mike, who does sit-ups and eats California 
Flakey, to the amusement of new friends. 
</P>
<P>
The story is incredibly routine and flat, which, if memory serves, was usually 
the problem with "Adam-12," even though the collaboration worked. The boys 
still look terrific, with some great new "character" wrinkles, and balance each 
other nicely. 
</P>
<P>
A series? Well, Mike has his eye on Nashville, with an especially hot eye on a 
blond barkeep. She has hot eyes back. Hmmm. 
</P>
<P>
(As for "Adam-12," a new version -- with new stars -- debuts Monday at 7 p.m. 
on KTTV Channel 11.) IRV LETOFSKY

WHEN EAGER PROMOTERS SET OUT TO IMITATE DISNEY IN FRANCE, THEY TOOK JUST ABOUT 
EVERYTHING INTO ACCOUNT. EVERYTHING, THAT IS, EXCEPT FOR THE FRENCH.

<TEXT>
<P>
A French television journalist called it "The War of the Theme Parks." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it is more like a massacre. An overweight giant, a barbarian wild 
boar hunter, a colony of blue elves and a clown all ganged up against a mouse. 
So far, the mouse is winning, without even striking a blow. 
</P>
<P>
When Walt Disney Co. announced plans to build its new $2.5-billion Euro 
Disneyland outside Paris for opening in 1992, it sparked a wild scramble of 
imitators all over France. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by French and Arab investors, eager theme park promoters hired American 
consultants and sent executives on furtive tours of Disney parks in the United 
States. One group even enrolled an agent in a Disney personnel training seminar 
in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, two years before the first shovel touched earth at the Euro Disneyland 
site at Marne-la-Vallee, 20 miles east of Paris, three French theme parks -- 
Mirapolis, Futuroscope and Zygofolis -- had already opened for business. Two 
more, Asterix and something called Big Bang Schtroumpf, opened this spring. 
Total construction cost for the Disney clones: nearly $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
But so far at least, the French theme park explosion has been a huge financial 
flop and something of a cultural disaster. The struggling parcs d'attraction 
have suffered everything from violent sabotage raids by carnival operators to 
food boycotts by picky French eaters. 
</P>
<P>
Mainly, the park builders failed to take into account the sociological 
peculiarities of France, which unlike most of the rest of the developed world, 
has had little previous exposure to theme parks. The French insistence on 
eating lunch at exactly 12:30, for example, cut into the concession sales and 
caused enormous, hostile, midday bottlenecks outside the park restaurants. To 
their dismay, park operators discovered that most French do not snack. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the French aversion to meeting strangers with buoyant smiles and 
lighthearted greetings took the shine off the welcome by the park staff, a 
factor considered key to the Disney success. Conversely, visitors to one of the 
French parks, paying up to $20 for a single entry, were often treated as though 
they were buying subway coupons. Many French staffers openly defied orders to 
stop smoking, chewing gum and conversing with their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Most parks also suffered from the French "only on Sunday" syndrome in which the 
French often dedicate Sunday, and Sunday only, as the day for family outings. 
</P>
<P>
The French park failings do not seem to have fazed Disney executives here. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to say without sounding arrogant," commented Euro Disney 
president Robert Fitzpatrick, "but there is really no comparison." His proof: A 
recent $1-billion public stock offering by Euro Disney was gobbled up by 
European investors in just a few days. 
</P>
<P>
However, Disney officials admit that there are some cultural lessons to be 
learned from the travails of the hastily built French parks. And some of the 
battered French developers warn Disney not to get too haughty. 
</P>
<P>
"Disney is like Mike Tyson and we are like flyweights," said Marc Tombez, 
director general of the Mirapolis Park, 22 miles outside Paris near Pontoise. 
"They are like a symphony orchestra and we are like a jazz quartet. But they 
are dealing with an undisciplined French public that doesn't like to wait in 
line. I wish them well, but they could have troubles if they put too much 
America in their management." 
</P>
<P>
In total, the five separately owned French parks had operating losses of more 
than $43 million in the season just ended. The hardest hit, Mirapolis, is 
undergoing the French equivalent of reorganization under bankruptcy, with 
creditors and bankers meeting weekly in an attempt to restructure its debt. 
</P>
<P>
"I give us a 70-30 chance to survive," said Tombez in a recent interview, 
conducted as bank officials conducted an inventory of his office furniture. 
</P>
<P>
Rudely awakened from financial fantasyland, facing a bleak tomorrowland, the 
French theme park promoters learned some painful lessons about the magic 
kingdom biz. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Mirapolis designers discovered that a theme park built around the 
image of a grotesquely fat, belching giant has little appeal to the 
diet-conscious French man and woman of today. An impressive 110-foot-tall 
statue showing a squatting Gargantua, the character created by 16th-Century 
author Francois Rabelais, swilling a goblet of wine in one hand and eating a 
whole cow impaled on a giant fork in the other, looms hungrily over the 
Mirapolis grounds. A restaurant built into his bulging thighs serves roast 
chicken and platters of French fries. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to forget about Gargantua," lamented Tombez. "First of all, Rabelais 
is only read by about 5% of the French people. Gargantua is well known but only 
for eating and drinking too much. But this is a time of fitness and form. The 
trend is to be light." 
</P>
<P>
A $100-million park financed by Saudi Arabian investors and the French 
government Caisse des Depots, Mirapolis was hurt in its early days by violent 
attacks from traditional carnival workers who feared that the new theme park 
craze would put their old roving shows of rides and amusement booths out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
On at least two occasions, marauding thugs smashed machinery, put detergent in 
the fountains, poured sand in the gears of thrill rides and generally terrified 
park customers. On another occasion they spread tacks on the parking lot to 
puncture tires. 
</P>
<P>
Asterix Park, a $150-million rival, is located about 50 miles away in another 
corner of the Paris metropolitan area, near Charles De Gaulle Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the immensely popular characters of the Asterix comic books created by 
Albert Uderzo and Rene Goscinny, which have sold more than 180 million copies 
in 29 languages, Asterix Park has a much more palatable theme. French opinion 
surveys show that more French know of Asterix, a feisty little wild boar hunter 
from Gaul who outfoxes the invading Romans at the time of Julius Caesar's 
Gallic campaign around 58 BC, than they do Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. 
</P>
<P>
In this respect, Asterix Park hopes to capitalize on French nationalism as it 
battles the Disney giant, which will be about a 40-minute drive away when it 
opens in three years. 
</P>
<P>
"Asterix is the story of a little Gaul village that resists the domination of 
powerful invaders," recounted Asterix spokesman Didier Bailleux during a recent 
stroll through the deserted park grounds. "The Gauls have the secret of a magic 
potion -- a drink that makes them supernaturally powerful and helps them 
against the Romans. In fact, we at Asterix also are resisting the pressure of 
invaders -- you know who. Our secret potion is patriotism." 
</P>
<P>
The theme park that provided the blue elves who sought to preempt Disney's 
Mickey Mouse is Big Bang Schtroumpf, with a popular theme based on the little 
cartoon and toy characters from Belgium, called "Smurfs" in English. But 
Zygofolis, a Lebanese-financed theme park in Nice, bombed when it attempted to 
base its theme on a clown character invented exclusively for the park. 
</P>
<P>
Futuroscope, a high-tech amusement park near Poitiers, has no central character 
but is the only one of the French parks to actually exceed its estimates for 
visitors, 750,000 instead of the projected 500,000 during the summer season. 
But the park, financed by the French department (state) of La Vienne, runs the 
risk of becoming "anachro-land," as one Disney official put it, unless it 
constantly updates its technological displays. It is for the same reason that 
Disney discarded the idea of a Tomorrowland at its new Euro park. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Futuroscope, the compact Asterix Park follows the Disney formula more 
closely. As with Disney, the management asks employees to wear badges bearing 
only their first names, a very informal and un-French way of doing business. 
Unlike Mirapolis, which is near industrial buildings and has high-tension 
electric power lines cut across the property, the Asterix promoters have kept 
the real world isolated from their park. Even the parking lots are hidden 
behind earthen berms to keep vehicles out of the sight of park goers. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the staff, like Bailleux, 29, are young and about as bubbly and 
friendly as anyone raised in the reserved, guarded French culture can be. As 
Bailleux strolled the grounds he occasionally stooped to pocket stray litter. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Disney specialists give Asterix Park the best chance for survival 
after the big battle begins in 1992. But the new park fell far short of its 
goal of 1.8 million visitors last summer. 
</P>
<P>
When the park closed for the season earlier this month, only 1.3 million 
customers had paid their 120 francs ($20) to enter its gates. Park officials 
blamed the shortfall on their sociological misunderstandings. 
</P>
<P>
In projecting their potential attendance, the Asterix marketers forgot about 
the French preference for reserving Sundays for family outings. As a result, 
they were horribly overcrowded on Sundays -- on 10 occasions, all Sundays, they 
were forced to turn people away because the park was full -- and nearly empty 
the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike neighboring West Germany and Belgium, which have a 20-year history of 
large amusement parks, the French theme park experience began only in 1987. 
Suddenly, the French had the theme parks but didn't know what to do with them. 
</P>
<P>
"We had suddenly-from-nothing mentality," said Tombez, a Club Med travel 
executive on loan to Mirapolis. "In 1980, Disney began to say it is possible we 
are coming to Paris. Overnight, all the investors and bankers in France began 
to say, 'Quickly, quickly let's go into the park business.' Everyone rushed out 
and bought the best American consultants. They gave us figures based on the 
American market. The only problem was that the Frenchman didn't know the 
product. He didn't even understand why he had to pay to get in. 'I have to 
pay,' he said, 'to do what?' " 
</P>
<P>
Tombez cites what the expensive American consultants told the French theme park 
developers about eating habits. "They said in theme parks, 70% of the people 
eat -- 50% fast food and 20% in restaurants. But they forgot a big thing. 
American people will eat at any time. French people all eat lunch at 12:30. 
They cannot imagine anyone eating at 11 a.m. or 3 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
The result, experienced by all the French theme parks: Gargantuan overcrowding 
and long lines at 12:30 p.m. and little business any other time of day. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, Euro Disney officials appear unruffled. They are hoping for 11 
million visitors in the first year of operation in 1992, timed to coincide with 
the unification of the economic markets of the 12 member nations of the 
European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Said Euro Disney President Fitzpatrick: "At the most, they are investing $150 
million in their parks. We are investing $2.5 billion. We are not just building 
a couple of thrill attractions." 
</P>
<P>
But Fitzpatrick and Disney chief executive Michael Eisner have toured all of 
their European competitors looking for cultural idiosyncrasies that could 
affect business. 
</P>
<P>
At the sprawling Marne-la-Vallee site, for example, they plan to install a 
luxury, hotel-style kennel for dogs to ease the pain of French visitors not 
accustomed to abandoning their animals, which will be banned inside Euro 
Disneyland although they are permitted inside most French resorts and even 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
To deal with the famous French impatience, they will install specially covered 
waiting areas with entertainment to distract those in line. To avoid some of 
the nationalistic pitfalls, they will emphasize the European roots of some of 
the fairy tales used in the park, including Sleeping Beauty (La Belle au Bois 
Dormant). In the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, several of the bad guys will 
speak French. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to have polyglot pirates," quipped Fitzpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the poor showing of the other French theme parks who had hoped to cash 
in on the Disney magic, the European investment community demonstrated its 
confidence in the Disney project during the company's first European stock 
offering in October. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Paris Stock Exchange, the Bourse, Fitzpatrick and Eisner were 
pelted with tomatoes and eggs by members of the Young Communist League, 
protesting the construction of the park. But inside, investors were buying up 
the stock at a rate unrivaled since former French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac 
privatized several important state industries. 
</P>
<P>
Three days after the 83 million shares were put on the market, there was demand 
for 10 times that number in the several European markets where the offering was 
made. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great success," Disney vice president and treasurer John Forsgren 
said of the offering. "I think that people recognized that Disney is a 
different scale than these other places."

FREEWAY'S FALL POSSIBLY AVOIDABLE, EXPERT SAYS; 
</P>

SAFETY: CONTRADICTING HIS BOSS, A STATE ENGINEER SAYS THE KNOW-HOW HAS BEEN 
AVAILABLE FOR TWO DECADES.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A top State Department of Transportation engineer told The Times Friday that 
technology exists -- and has existed for nearly 20 years -- that might have 
prevented the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland, where at least 32 
people were killed during Tuesday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The engineer, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, 
contradicted Caltrans chief engineer William E. Schaefer, who has repeatedly 
claimed that no such technology exists. 
</P>
<P>
The engineer, a high-ranking seismic expert familiar with the Nimitz Freeway, 
is the first such expert within the transportation department to confirm claims 
made by private structural engineers that state highway officials failed to 
take adequate steps to strengthen roadway overpasses after the 1971 Sylmar 
quake, which collapsed freeway bridges in the San Fernando Valley and took 58 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
"The technology has been around since San Fernando," said the engineer, who 
said the freeway columns were not strengthened because of "budget limitations" 
and "priority" considerations. 
</P>
<P>
"There is only so much money," said the engineer. "You just get caught in 
trying to spread the money to where it is best used." 
</P>
<P>
The engineer estimated that it would cost $100,000 a column to strengthen the 
Nimitz Freeway. The roadway has more than 100 columns. 
</P>
<P>
Although the columns supporting the collapsed section of the Nimitz Freeway 
gave way during Tuesday's quake, it is not clear whether the columns themselves 
were the weak link. At least one seismic expert said it is possible that some 
other aspect of the structure, such as the joints that link the roadway to the 
columns, failed first. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans is planning to bolster newer single-column freeway supports by 
wrapping the uprights with steel reinforcement bars, but Schaefer maintains it 
is not known whether this method will work for the older multiple column 
supports -- such as those used on the double-deck Cypress Viaduct of the Nimitz 
Freeway that collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the technical knowledge, nor does it exist anywhere in the 
world," Schaefer said earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Schaefer said the state has developed a steel jacket that can be 
wrapped around concrete columns to provide earthquake resistance for newer 
freeways. But that technique works only on those highways that are supported by 
rows of single columns, not roadways, such as the Nimitz, that rest upon 
multiple columns, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we understood how to put those same steel jackets on the multiple-column 
structures, that probably would have worked," Schaefer said. "We don't know how 
to do that yet." 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer acknowledged that the problem of reinforcing multiple columns could 
have been solved by now -- probably preventing the collapse on the Nimitz -- if 
the department had made that dilemma its top priority after the Sylmar quake. 
</P>
<P>
But with limited funds, giving first priority to structures such as the Nimitz 
would have meant delaying another project aimed at ensuring that roadbed 
sections on other elevated highways did not separate during quakes. That 
project, recently completed, prevented the collapse of an untold number of 
freeways during the 1987 Whittier earthquake, said James Roberts, chief of 
Caltrans' structures division. 
</P>
<P>
This roadbed project, costing $53.6 million, was envisioned as the first phase 
of a larger program to strengthen highway overpasses. It entailed tying roadbed 
sections of bridges together with steel cables. Caltrans said that roadbed work 
included the Nimitz. 
</P>
<P>
A second phase, which is just beginning, called for strengthening single-column 
supports of freeway spans. Overpasses supported by multiple-column supports 
were to be done later. 
</P>
<P>
But even as the first phase of the plan neared completion in 1985, and long 
before the second phase began, Caltrans assured the public that California's 
bridges were safe.

concrete for Caltrans, said in an Aug. 8, 1985, Associated Press story: "We 
feel all the bridges will go through an event (earthquake) without collapsing." 
Zelinski went on to say, according to the article, that even older bridges 
would withstand a catastrophic 8.3 earthquake -- more than 30 times stronger 
than Tuesday's temblor. 
</P>
<P>
"I made the quote and I don't deny it," Zelinsky said Friday. "I felt very 
confident at the time." He said that he had been instructed by superiors and 
attorneys not to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian expressed anger when he learned of the collapse of the 
Nimitz Freeway and his spokesman said the governor was assured by Caltrans that 
the freeways would withstand an earthquake of Tuesday's magnitude. On Friday, 
Deukmejian's chief of staff said the governor would have ordered the structure 
closed if he had known of the danger. 
</P>
<P>
"But we were never told that," Michael R. Frost said. "There was no indication 
ever that something like this would occur. Something obviously went very, very 
wrong and we're determined to find out what it is, so we can prevent it from 
happening again." 
</P>
<P>
But the Professional Engineers in California Government said Friday in a 
scathing news release that if Deukmejian is looking for someone to blame, "he 
needn't look any further than his own bathroom mirror." 
</P>
<P>
"Year after year, Caltrans requested funding to hire the staff needed to do its 
work," said the organization, which represents state government engineers in 
salary negotiations. "Instead, the governor imposed hiring freezes and budget 
cutbacks . . . . No wonder that now, 18 years after the Sylmar quake, a . . . 
project to strengthen these bridges is only one-third complete." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Associated Press reported Friday that a 1982 report by the state 
Department of Mines and Geology had warned that the soil beneath the freeway 
section that collapsed could liquefy in a much bigger quake, that with a 
magnitude of 8.3. Tuesday's quake was magnitude 6.9. 
</P>
<P>
"The hydraulic fills used to construct miles of freeway along the east shore of 
the (San Francisco Bay) in Alameda County may liquefy during heavy shaking, 
with long sections becoming totally impassable," said the report to the 
Governor's Emergency Task Force on Earthquake Preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if our people ever saw that particular report," chief 
transportation spokesman Jim Drago said. "One thing I can tell you is we're 
assembling all soil studies and everything else that might help us understand 
what happened."

<P>
In normal times, people here probably wouldn't pay much attention to Donald 
Munakata. He'd be just another guy with a clipboard and a breast pocket full of 
pens who works somewhere in the Public Works Department at a job that's kind of 
technical, one that not many people understand much about. 
</P>
<P>
These are not normal times, however, so to many people in this 
earthquake-ravaged city these days, a guy like Donald Munakata can seem like 
God. 
</P>
<P>
Munakata is a city building inspector, one of hundreds of technicians from the 
city and private industry deputized to make assessments of the safety of 
battered houses and apartments in the upscale but badly shaken Marina District. 
The fate of thousands of damaged buildings as well as their occupants may hinge 
on swift judgments made by men like Munakata. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, he walked quickly through a large apartment building on Cervantes 
Street, poking his flashlight into the basement and then into a series of 
darkened bathrooms, bedrooms and kitchens before ending up in the lobby, which 
was covered with fallen plaster. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, despite the dust, he pronounced the building safe and slapped a white, 
mimeographed sticker on the front door. "Inspected," it read in big print. "No 
restrictions on use and occupancy." 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety-nine percent of what we do is visual," explained Pat Nurisso, another 
city inspector. "That's all we can do." 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors have conducted more than 1,000 such walk-throughs in the Marina area 
since Tuesday's earthquake. Their evaluations are funnelled down to a disaster 
command post at the Marina Middle School and are used to determine not only the 
fate of structures but also who should get access to them. 
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, Mayor Art Agnos told reporters that it appeared that as many as 20 
buildings in the area may eventually have to be razed. Other officials said at 
least four buildings at the intersection of Divisadero and Jefferson streets 
are listing at a sharp angle and are in imminent danger of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the inspector reports, officials at the school have devised a 
color-coded pass system to determine which residents should be allowed back in 
their homes and for how long. People who live in structures that are deemed 
safe are issued green colored slips of paper that allow them to pass through 
police lines and reinhabit their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Yellow slips, issued to those whose homes have been damaged but not beyond 
repair, authorize entry for brief periods in the presence of a building 
inspector to remove possessions. Red slips, on the other hand, indicate that 
the structure is severely damaged and is considered a candidate for demolition. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, authorities have allowed bearers of red slips to return home and 
retrieve possessions, but required them to sign liability waivers before 
entering their buildings. So far, at least 47 buildings have been tagged red, 
but city officials have promised that no building will be torn down before 
owners have the opportunity to have independent safety experts evaluate their 
conditions. Ultimately, however, the decision whether to demolish is up to the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
By 8 a.m. Friday, several hundred anxious Marina residents were already lined 
up in the school parking lot to obtain their access cards and discover the fate 
of their homes. Waiting patiently well back in the pack was baseball Hall of 
Famer Joe DiMaggio, who has lived in the same Marina-area home since 1937. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just like anybody else; I'm just waiting in line," said DiMaggio, who 
later was handed a yellow tag and then chauffeured to his home by a high-level 
building department official. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the school, technicians pored over inspection reports, mental health 
counselors dispensed advice to those left homeless, and red- and 
yellow-ticketed residents waited in the auditorium for appointments with 
inspectors who would escort them to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Every once in a while, an official would step to the front of the stage and 
announce a list of buildings that had been reevaluated and upgraded from a 
yellow to green status. "101 Cervantes," he said once, evoking squeals from the 
back of the room. "2121 Bay," he added, bringing applause from the back of the 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Out in the streets, the scene resembled a giant a swap meet. Residents poured 
into the area with shopping carts, plastic bags, boxes and even children's 
wagons to carry away what possessions they could from damaged homes. Streets 
and intersections were littered with bureaus, chairs, stereos, televisions and 
other paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
A procession of furniture vans, pickups and station wagons lined Chestnut 
Street just outside the police cordon. 
</P>
<P>
As inspectors watched, residents raced through their apartments, tossing 
clothing out windows to the ground and handing larger, bulkier items out 
lower-story windows to others on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Madeline Foss and Pat Duff, both accountants, were concentrating on rescuing 
their big-ticket possessions, including a pair of windsurf boards, a microwave 
oven and stereo. "It was Yuppie town down here, but now it's all destroyed," 
she said. "The money items get taken first." 
</P>
<P>
Police said they had set up a special cordon around a block of red-tagged homes 
that were leaning precariously. They said some residents were ignoring the 
danger and sneaking in to retrieve belongings. 
</P>
<P>
At one of those buildings in danger of tipping over, an officer said he found a 
man lugging a wide-screen TV set onto a balcony. Said another policeman: "I saw 
a guy crawl through the rubble of one building and come out grabbing with a 
Bruce Springsteen poster. There is nothing except maybe my son that would get 
me in that building." 
</P>
<P>
Liz Burrie, 37, just wanted to get back in her home to find Kona Kittie, her 
cat. But with the help of a building inspector and a policeman, she also 
managed to haul her cookbooks, lawn chairs, a butcher block table and other 
possessions down to the street. "It's rather embarrassing," she said. "My whole 
life is on the street for everybody to see." 
</P>
<P>
The cat, who was still in the house when Burrie arrived, was frightened by all 
the moving activity and fled out a window. 
</P>
<P>
One woman, helping her daughter remove belongings from a red-tagged building at 
Beach and Divisadero, paused briefly to pick up a small child's eraser that she 
found on the ground. "I wish we could take this and just erase all these 
problems out of our minds," she said wistfully.

EARTHQUAKE: COLD AND THE THREAT OF RAIN DAMPEN SPIRITS AS A GRIM PRESIDENT 
PROMISES QUICK FEDERAL AID.

<P>
Bay Area quake victims, including more than 6,500 still displaced from their 
homes, were beset by new miseries Friday in the form of falling temperatures, 
the threat of rain and mounting damages, but they were promised quick federal 
relief by a grim President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Any relief will be welcomed as more careful study of the area struck by 
Tuesday's 6.9-magnitude quake -- and more than 1,500 aftershocks -- pushed 
conservative damage estimates to more than $4.2 billion. "On paper, the city is 
broke," said San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos. 
</P>
<P>
The official death toll rose to 53 Friday as more bodies were pulled from the 
debris of the collapsed Nimitz Freeway in Oakland. The toll includes 32 in 
Alameda County, where the double-decked freeway is located, 10 in San 
Francisco, five each in Santa Cruz and Santa Clara counties, and one in 
Monterey County. 
</P>
<P>
A San Francisco coroner's office spokesman, who asked not to be identified, 
said five people are also missing and presumed dead in the rubble of the city's 
Marina District buildings. 
</P>
<P>
At least 3,011 injuries were reported, the state Office of Emergency Services 
said, and a hospital association said that 250 people were still being treated 
in hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Weather conditions turned less favorable Friday, with cool blustery winds 
pushing out the Indian summer that had made the first two days after the 
devastating quake at least bearable. But rain was forecast for much of the 
region on Saturday, and temperatures were expected to drop into the 40s in the 
Santa Cruz mountains, where many residents are camping in their yards. 
</P>
<P>
Bush flew into the Bay Area from Washington on Friday morning and made 
inspection stops at the site of the crumbled Nimitz Freeway in Oakland and in 
downtown Santa Cruz, where several buildings in a pedestrian mall had 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Bush appeared stunned as he arrived Friday morning at the scene of the crumbled 
freeway in west Oakland. "Jesus," he muttered aloud. "I'm deeply moved by this, 
deeply moved," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush named Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner to keep federal relief 
flowing smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
Agnos said he talked with the President for about 45 minutes Friday and was 
pleased with the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied that we had a chance to get our points across. We had plenty of 
time to talk to him," Agnos said. "He was disturbed by what he saw and I was 
impressed by the sincerity of his reaction." 
</P>
<P>
At the scene of the Nimitz Freeway disaster, Oakland police said 32 bodies had 
been recovered and about 85 possible other victims are listed as missing. About 
40 vehicles have been pulled out, half of them without occupants. Police Capt. 
James Hahn said at least 52 cars remain stuck in the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
Work was suspended at 7 p.m. Friday after workers using a jackhammer to break 
up concrete debris felt "some shifting and shaking of the entire structure," 
said Kyle Nelson, spokesman for Caltrans, the state transportation authority. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said he anticipates rescue work resuming by daybreak after the collapsed 
double-decked freeway is shored up with steel, wood and "tons and tons of 
dirt." 
</P>
<P>
The vehicles being pulled empty from the rubble apparently were abandoned in 
the seconds during and after the main quake, Caltrans spokesman Greg Bayol 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"People must have stopped their cars and got out when they realized (the upper 
deck) was beginning to fall," Bayol said. "I know one person's body was found 
on the freeway; we think that person stopped the car, got out and got hit by 
another car." 
</P>
<P>
Some cars may also have been parked in a lot beneath the lower deck of the 1 
1/4-mile stretch of Interstate 880 freeway that fell. 
</P>
<P>
The state Office of Emergency Services said it knew of 6,569 people believed to 
be displaced from their homes. Most of them were forced to seek the aid of 
friends, check into hotels or motels, spend the nights at evacuation centers or 
camp out in parks and front yards. As many as 500 victims have been spending 
the night on blankets at Callaghan Park in Watsonville. 
</P>
<P>
But in Santa Cruz County, the area with the most residences destroyed by the 
quake, officials said the number of people facing the weekend -- and perhaps 
far longer -- out of their homes is much higher. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Gordon, Santa Cruz County emergency services coordinator, estimated that 
between 8,000 and 10,000 county residents are in that situation. "They are not 
necessarily homeless," she said. "Some are just afraid of aftershocks." 
</P>
<P>
Small towns along the mountain ridges that isolate Santa Cruz from the Bay Area 
took the worst hit, with hundreds of houses and other buildings destroyed or 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
In the city of Santa Cruz, about 50 houses were judged uninhabitable. But Mayor 
Mardi Wormhoudt said six to eight buildings along the open-air Pacific Garden 
Mall, the heart of the city's historic downtown, will have to be demolished and 
that another six or so may face a similar fate. In all, 250 businesses that 
employ 2,000 people were damaged on the mall. Most of the buildings date from 
1880 to 1910 and were of unreinforced brick construction. 
</P>
<P>
At least three people died when a department store and a coffee emporium on the 
mall collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Cruz's popular beachside amusement area suffered some damage. The ground 
buckled near the Ferris wheel and log ride, which will remain closed until 
spring, but the 65-year-old Big Dipper roller coaster and other rides will 
reopen in two weeks, said Marq Lipton, marketing director of the boardwalk 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
Long lines were reported at Santa Cruz markets and gasoline stations Friday. 
And some people complained of price gouging. 
</P>
<P>
Employees of a local Long's drugstore filled two vans with water bottles, 
batteries, baby formula, diapers and other items, and gave the products away to 
customers and social service agencies. The prescription pharmacy was run out of 
a side door by flashlight even though "literally 65%" of the store's stock lay 
on the floor, dumped there by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
Charleston, S.C., hit hard by the recent Hurricane Hugo, sent five police 
officers and 7,000 gallons of fresh water to help Santa Cruz, as a way of 
thanking California for its aid. "We thought we'd return the favor," said 
Charleston Patrolman Frederick Pasley, 25, who was standing guard along the 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans estimates that California 17, the major highway into Santa Cruz from 
the north, will be closed for four to six weeks. Raw sewage from the Santa Cruz 
area continued to flow into Monterey Bay Friday from breaks in two major sewer 
lines. "It's pretty significant," said Diane Evans of the county Department of 
Environmental Health, adding that beaches in the area were closed. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Patton, chairman of the Santa Cruz Board of Supervisors, said he was 
pleased that Bush came to Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
"He understands that we've got to get people out of the shelters, and he said, 
'We will do as a nation whatever is necessary,' " Patton said. "We're going to 
hold him to it." 
</P>
<P>
Others in the Santa Cruz area said they hoped that the devastation in their 
less-traveled county would not be forgotten as the media attention focuses on 
San Francisco and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we don't get forgotten. We are smaller but proportionately we were hit 
very hard," said Karen McNally, geophysics professor at UC Santa Cruz and 
director of the Charles F. Richter Seismology Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
In Watsonville, which sometimes calls itself the frozen-food capital of the 
country, processing plants were finding it hard to get workers to help with 
clean-up efforts and work in fields. 
</P>
<P>
The town's center took heavy damage from the Tuesday quake, and several hundred 
families have stayed huddled outside of their damaged homes since a major 
aftershock Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"Our house is in terrible shape, and we have nowhere to leave the children," 
said Armando Ortiz, warming his hands over a barrel fire on a high school 
football field. "They are still very frightened, and I don't want to leave my 
family alone." 
</P>
<P>
In Salinas, in Monterey County, the City Council ignored pleas by the Salinas 
Historical Society that they were "throwing away the most historically 
significant buildings in Salinas," and ordered demolition of six badly damaged 
old structures on Main Street. Among the buildings the society had tried to 
save were the Cominos and Franklin hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The Cominos, which used to be the largest hotel in Salinas, was built in 1874 
and was immortalized by John Steinbeck in "East of Eden." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, geologists said Friday they had found evidence of slippage along the 
San Andreas Fault in a 30-mile section between Lexington Reservoir and the town 
of San Juan Bautista. 
</P>
<P>
James Diederich, a spokesman for the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, said 
the slippage was found in a laser survey of landmarks in the area. Preliminary 
evidence showed a right lateral "strike-slip" along the San Andreas, but does 
not conclusively prove that the notorious fault was involved in Tuesday's 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, the biggest crowd of displaced victims -- about 1,000 people, 
most of whom were homeless before the quake -- have spent the nights at the 
Moscone Center convention hall. Bob Prentice, the mayor's coordinator of 
homeless programs, said that as many as 1,000 city-financed hotel rooms used to 
shelter the homeless had been lost to the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, San Francisco city inspectors continued their evaluation of 2,000 
Marina District buildings that were damaged in the quake. Laurence M. 
Kornfield, the chief building inspector, said the job should be finished today. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, emergency officials had to coax reluctant residents out of 
their earthquake-damaged homes. 
</P>
<P>
"At 11 o'clock last night we got a 93-year-old man out of one house and we had 
18 people who we had to get food and water for because they wouldn't come out 
of their homes," said Mayor Agnos, who had been on the scene. The residents 
were afraid that once they left, they would not be allowed to return, Agnos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred residents lined up Friday morning at Marina Middle School, the 
local center for disaster planning, to get the coveted colored passes that 
identified them as tenants and property owners so they would be allowed in to 
visit their homes. A green card bestowed permission to return home. A yellow 
one allowed a brief visit to remove possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Red barred entry except with a city inspector, and only then after the tenant 
signed a waiver of liability for the city. 
</P>
<P>
But enforcement was spotty. Getting through official barricades often depended 
on who was checking passes. 
</P>
<P>
Joe DiMaggio, the baseball legend, waited in line with the less famous. "I'm 
just like anybody else," said DiMaggio, who added that he has lived in the 
Marina District since 1937. Later a top-level building inspector took him in 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Liz Burrie finally got to her apartment building at North Point and Divisadero 
at 6 a.m. Friday. The entire four-story structure had collapsed. She picked her 
way over the rubble, accompanied by an inspector and a police officer, and 
climbed into what used to be her top-floor bay window. She spent an hour 
hauling out what she could find. 
</P>
<P>
She found her cat alive, but the animal skittered away in the debris. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unbelievable how much survived," Burrie said. 
</P>
<P>
Urgency built among the anxious residents, those without shelter and those just 
wishing to collect their possessions, as the changing weather brought blustery 
winds and the threat of a cold rain. 
</P>
<P>
Residents cast out of their homes by the earthquake or the worried building 
inspectors continued to stream into shelters around the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
"They keep condemning buildings and we get more and more people," said Charlton 
Horne, volunteer coordinator at the American Red Cross shelter at Martin Luther 
King Elementary School in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
James Roberts, chief of the structures division for Caltrans, said in 
Sacramento that the Embarcadero Freeway in downtown San Francisco will remain 
closed, possibly until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said the Embarcadero, which is elevated above the San Francisco 
waterfront and ends in North Beach, will not be reopened until its concrete 
pillars are reinforced with steel to ensure that they will not give way and 
collapse in the next major quake. This work cannot even be designed until an 
investigation of the Nimitz collapse is completed in three or four months. 
</P>
<P>
A moderate aftershock Friday evening briefly closed three lanes of U.S. 101 in 
Marin County, but Caltrans said the damage was minor. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Japanese Consulate in Los Angeles Friday announced a list of 19 
Japanese corporations that had donated almost $4 million to the earthquake 
relief effort. A $1-million contribution from Sony Corp. was the largest. 
</P>
<P>

Myrna Oliver from staff reports in the Bay Area and Santa Cruz County.

<P>
Major California banks and thrifts on Friday moved to provide emergency loans 
and to ease the financial pressure on earthquake victims by giving them breaks 
on mortgage and other loan payments. 
</P>
<P>
Policies vary at each financial institution, although in general they include 
such things as allowing victims to skip mortgage and credit-card payments 
temporarily, make lower payments or allow borrowers more time to pay off their 
mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
Two major buyers of mortgages from lenders also said they will provide similar 
breaks for homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. -- called Freddie Mac -- said it is 
devising a mortgage-relief plan and that it will suspend until Jan. 1 
foreclosure procedures on property in the earthquake area. The Federal National 
Mortgage Assn. -- Fannie Mae -- said it plans to offer a similar program. Both 
agencies advised homeowners to check first with the companies that service 
their mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, private lenders began organizing programs to provide homeowners and 
businesses money for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
A consortium of 46 banks in the state that normally provides money for 
low-income housing may also pool money to make disaster-relief loans, said Hugh 
D. Loftus, first vice president of Security Pacific National Bank. He said 
members of the Burbank-based group, called the California Community 
Reinvestment Co., plan to meet next week to work on plans. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the state's major financial institutions announced their own loan 
programs for victims or said they will do so next seek. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of America, the state's largest bank, said it is offering emergency, 
low-interest, 90-day loans without fees to homeowners who suffered damage. They 
will carry an interest rate equal to what the bank is paying for money, which 
now is 8%. Unsecured disaster-relief loans for up to 48 months are being 
offered at 12%. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo Bank, also in San Francisco, is expected to announce a program 
Monday to provide loans at 9% to renters and homeowners whose residences were 
damaged by the earthquake. The Wells Fargo loans will be offered only to the 
bank's current customers. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo also is setting up a $75-million pool of money for low-interest 
loans for small business customers with sales from $250,000 to $5 million a 
year. Those loans will have an interest rate 1.5% below the prime rate, now at 
10.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Union Bank, another San Francisco bank, said it will provide unsecured 
disaster-relief loans of up to $25,000 to quake victims. The 90-day loans carry 
an interest rate equal to the rate Union is paying for money, now at 8% to 9%. 
</P>
<P>
Union Bank also will provide loans to people whose cars were damaged in the 
quake, with no payment for 90 days, and will waive penalties on early 
withdrawals of money in certificates of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners also may seek low-interest loans through the U.S. Small Business 
Administration, the federal agency that administers disaster-relief loans. The 
agency makes available up to $100,000 to repair damage to homes and up to 
$20,000 for personal property damage, which includes cars and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners pay either 4% or 8% interest, depending on whether they have credit 
elsewhere, and may take as long as 30 years to pay off the loans, depending on 
their ability to repay the money. Bernard Kulik, an SBA deputy assistant 
administrator, said loans may not be used to upgrade a home, unless it means 
bringing the house up to code. 
</P>
<P>
For businesses, Kulik said, the SBA has two basic loans available. 
</P>
<P>
The first is a "physical disaster loan" of up to $500,000 for repairs or to 
replace such things as damaged inventory. The interest rate is either 4% or 8%, 
depending on the financial health of the business, and businesses may take as 
long as 30 years to repay the loans. Large businesses may be eligible for more 
than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
The second type of loan is an "economic injury loan" that provides a cash 
infusion to a business so it can continue to pay its bills while recovering. 
</P>
<P>
The rate is 4% for up to 30 years and applies to small businesses -- with fewer 
than 500 employees -- that do not have credit elsewhere. A business may borrow 
a combined total of $500,000 under the physical-disaster and economic-injury 
loan programs. 
</P>
<P>
The toll-free number for information on the SBA loans is 1-800-462-9029. 
</P>
<P>
If loans to individuals are insufficient to cover needs, they may be eligible 
for grants of up to $10,000 through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
That money may be used for a wide variety of needs, including medicine, health 
care costs or funeral expenses. In addition, the agency makes rent money 
available to those who cannot live in their homes because they are unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
Information on the FEMA programs also may be obtained by calling 
1-800-462-9029.

STANFORD REPORTS IT HAS $160 MILLION IN DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Stanford University on Friday reported at least $160 million in earthquake 
damage as college campuses in the Bay Area attempted to find places for 
hundreds of students evacuated from unsafe dormitories. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said 26 of the 240 buildings on the Palo Alto campus, including 11 
small dormitories that house about 420 students, are closed and access to 36 
more is restricted. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford President Donald Kennedy estimated that the school sustained at least 
$160 million in structural damage. Damage to contents in the school buildings 
is also expected to be heavy. 
</P>
<P>
"Various academic buildings are closed and cannot be safely reoccupied until 
structural repairs are made," Kennedy said. "Others will need to be replaced 
completely." 
</P>
<P>
At the San Francisco State and San Jose State campuses, the damage from 
Tuesday's earthquake was more extensive than first reported, officials said. In 
addition, the California State University system's $8-million marine research 
laboratory at Moss Landing, north of Monterey, was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The two campuses and the lab will require about $45 million in repairs, 
according to Cal State spokesman Stephen MacCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
The library at San Francisco State appears to have significant damage, and 
inspectors are trying to determine the safety of a 700-bed dormitory and a 
parking garage. At San Jose State, the library and a large classroom building, 
among other structures, were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The two campuses originally planned to reopen Monday but that may be delayed, 
MacCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
At UC Santa Cruz, classes will resume Monday. Campus spokeswoman Stephanie Hauk 
said only a science building will remain closed for further damage inspection. 
However, she said the school sustained a "tremendous amount of content damage 
-- books, shelving, chemical spills, water lines." The losses in laboratory 
equipment probably total more than $1 million, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some students whose off-campus residences were badly damaged are being 
sheltered on campus in dormitory lounges. "The students are just fine. We have 
plenty of water and food for them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At Stanford, about half the scheduled classes were held Thursday and Friday, 
and the university is planning to return to a full teaching load as alternative 
classroom sites are found, spokeswoman Kathy O'Toole said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Stanford buildings heavily damaged and closed are the landmark 
Memorial Church and Leland Stanford Jr. Museum, both 100 years old and 
survivors of the great quake of 1906. 
</P>
<P>
"They are original campus buildings," said spokeswoman Eileen Walsh. "The 
church is the centerpiece of the campus. The steeple was knocked off in the 
1906 quake, but it was rebuilt." 
</P>
<P>
Although the chapel's expensive stained-glass windows -- which were being 
restored -- escaped damage, chunks of mosaic tile crashed from walls and the 
ceiling, splintering pews below. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford has been self-insured against earthquakes since 1985, when the 
school's insurance carriers canceled its policy, according to Robert Beth, 
director of risk management. Since then the school has accrued only $3.4 
million in its earthquake reserve and $3.6 million in a property reserve to 
respond to such events as fires or floods, Beth said. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, insurance companies offered to provide the university with 
earthquake coverage for $5 million a year and later reduced that figure to $3 
million. But because of a $100-million deductible and a $125-million maximum 
payment above that figure, the university declined the coverage. 
</P>
<P>
University Provost James Rosse said the school may seek loans or federal funds 
or use part of its endowment, estimated at $2 billion, to make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"We never used our borrowing capacity up to the limit because we knew there was 
a high probability that we would have to rebuild dorms, laboratories and 
classrooms after an earthquake," he said.

QUAKE DEALT COSTLY BLOW TO MAJOR AGRICULTURAL REGION 
</P>

Mountains of cans and drums filled with 400,000 tons of the summer tomato 
harvest came tumbling down when Tuesday's quake struck Hollister in San Benito 
County, knocking out the corrugated steel walls of many of the town's 14 
warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
In Watsonville, the frozen food processing capital of the country, an ammonia 
leak at the Green Giant plant could cause $20 million in losses to frozen 
Brussels sprouts, broccoli and other vegetables; six other processing plants 
there were also damaged. 
</P>
<P>
And in the tiny town of Freedom, just north of Watsonville, the earth's sudden 
quiver Tuesday knocked down thousands of pounds of apples stacked in bins, 
burying a partner in the H. A. Rider &amp; Sons cider processing company. Tom 
Rider remains hospitalized from his injuries and the company rehired about 40 
laid-off workers to help with the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
These are but some examples of the still mounting losses to homes, farms and 
livelihoods that were still being tallied Friday in the aftermath of the 
devastating quake, the epicenter of which was just to the north of the rich 
agricultural area of Monterey, San Benito, Santa Cruz and southern Santa Clara 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers and food processors ship billions of dollars of fruit and vegetables, 
providing much of the area's employment. At the height of the growing season, 
the countryside looks like an uninterrupted carpet of green all the way to the 
horizon. Monterey County farmers last year, for example, earned about $1.1 
billion, making it the fourth-richest agricultural county in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Winter-harvested vegetables still in the fields suffered little damage in the 
quake, farmers and processors said, even though power failures caused an 
interruption in irrigation in some areas and temperatures soared Thursday to 
unseasonable levels. Damage to large food processors, such as Green Giant, and 
blocked roads could delay getting vegetables to market and cause as-yet unknown 
losses. One estimate for Santa Cruz County put the loss at between $5 million 
and $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The main losses were to fruits and vegetables stored in warehouses that were 
damaged, although apples knocked from trees by the quake could also result in 
losses. Also hit were many of the inexpensive houses occupied by the area's 
5,000 field workers. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is a lot of them lost their homes, and they haven't reported back 
to work," said Ronald Tyler, director of the UC Agricultural Extension Service 
for Santa Cruz County. 
</P>
<P>
Workers whose homes were damaged or destroyed have been camping out in their 
front yards, on the high school football fields and elsewhere around 
Watsonville and the prospects for rebuilding the housing seems bleak, observers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have low-income housing in Watsonville," said Jose Villasana, a Santa 
Cruz County mental health worker. "And now the problem is going to get worse. 
We're just waiting for word on what to tell people. But even if the city wanted 
to help, the bottom line is there is no low-income housing." 
</P>
<P>
P. J. Mecozzi, president of Del Mar Foods, a medium-size food processor in 
Watsonville, said many of his 400 workers have spent the past few days at 
shelters and parks and other open places. "We've had a hard time getting our 
crews back to work because they have been displaced from their homes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar Foods resumed operations Thursday after electric power was restored. 
The stored food was undamaged because it stayed cool despite the disruption, 
but the cleanup and the lack of workers could delay frozen food deliveries 
across the country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About $1 million worth of food was lost when cases of food tumbled to the floor 
from stacked pallets and broke open. He said his losses -- representing about 
10% of what he had stored -- were about average for warehouses in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Processors from Santa Cruz to Salinas said they suffered minor losses as a 
result of the disruption in electricity on Wednesday. Some areas remained 
without power on Friday. Damage was reported as far south as the southern 
Monterey County town of Gonzales, where the quake ruptured tanks at the 
Monterey Vineyard and 20,000 gallons of wine leaked out. 
</P>
<P>
"The loss will be in the millions," said Steve Arnoldy, 39, director of 
operations for San Benito Foods, which owns six tomato warehouses in Hollister. 
"Some of our buildings we can't even get into. It's a miracle there was no one 
in the warehouses." 
</P>
<P>
In Castroville, which last year harvested 34,200 tons of artichokes and 
considers itself the artichoke center of the world, the quake resulted in few 
losses, although power failures forced growers to suspend the current harvest 
for a day, Monterey County agriculture officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing problems with power supplies prompted the local utility to ask 
Artichoke Industries Inc., the nation's main cannery and processor of 
artichokes, to scale back its use of power. 
</P>
<P>
"We've cut back just about as far as we can go without quitting," said John 
Podio, the plant manager. Lights, unused conveyors and motors, and even the 
office copier have been shut off, he said. "They asked us twice yesterday, and 
we just shut down. Today, we've got a minimum crew, but it looks like we're 
going to make it," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Cheers went up for the President. But some were Bronx cheers. 
</P>
<P>
Small civil disturbances erupted. Reporters fought excitedly and shamelessly 
for position and camera angle. 
</P>
<P>
The lordly and venerable Mark Hopkins Hotel put out a call for 20 Coleman camp 
stoves, please. 
</P>
<P>
The 80-degree Indian summer weather disappeared. Skies turned gloomy and damp; 
the wind began to bite. 
</P>
<P>
Advertisements returned to newspapers and radio. Shoppers returned to the city 
center. Football and the World Series returned to conversations. Restaurants 
returned to saying they are booked, too bad. 
</P>
<P>
And so the San Francisco Bay Area passed another long, strange, difficult and 
uneasy day this Friday, Day 3, on the road to recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still bodies in there! And families waiting to find out if their 
husbands, wives and children are dead! Now it's all political," said a bitter 
Stan Miller. 
</P>
<P>
The pipe cutter and rescue worker stopped his weary hours of labor at the 
collapsed Oakland freeway. He and the others stood by while Bush made a 
high-profile inspection. 
</P>
<P>
"Big deal," scowled cabbie Robert Vitcha, when Bush next touched down for 15 
minutes at the San Francisco Presidio. 
</P>
<P>
Here, Bush chose not to tour the disfigured Marina District nearby where 
workers also remained wearily preoccupied. "I'm not surprised, that's about 
what you expect from a politician," Vitcha said. 
</P>
<P>
Driven by intense news media coverage, the President, his squadron of 
helicopters, his motorcades, his retainers, and his accompaniment of sundry 
lesser politicians -- all of them -- dominated the day like no one thing since 
the 15 enduring seconds of Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Regional officials understood the importance of the presidential visit. Santa 
Cruz Mayor Mardi Wormhoudt said Bush needed to "see the plaster dust . . . to 
develop the emotional commitment to this problem that we need." 
</P>
<P>
This was particularly important to places like Santa Cruz, last stop on the 
presidential tour. 
</P>
<P>
Devastation was great there. But, as usual, even in their suffering, cities big 
and small here have had to suffer in the shadow of San Francisco. History had 
already recorded this as San Francisco's earthquake. This is where the 
television news shows set up their stages. Here was the newspaper dateline. And 
the city's sage chronicler for the last half-century, Herb Caen, gave the quake 
its name: The Little Big One. 
</P>
<P>
There was probably no chance Bush could emerge unblemished from this day in 
this city. 
</P>
<P>
For sure, he would have been damned had he not come. His standoffish response 
to two preceding disasters, the Exxon Valdez and Hurricane Hugo, got him 
nothing but grief. Better, it seems, to come and suffer some damnation for 
getting in the way. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the press seemed eager for the President to come see what was staring 
the Bay Area in the face. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are getting real crazy here," said KCBS radio reporter George Harris, 
broadcasting live and breathless as Bush hit Oakland. The shouting and shoving 
of the media mob was broadcast live throughout the morning and into the 
afternoon. One reporter described it as being in a "a hockey game." 
</P>
<P>
There was another worry looming in the background of Day 3. 
</P>
<P>
San Franciscans started complaining that outsiders were forming impressions of 
death and destruction which exceeded the facts. Likely, this was more the 
result of repetition of news than of exaggeration. But locals grew edgy 
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
"Will you please write that some of us are alive out here?" asked one Avis 
rental car clerk as a fresh batch of journalistic replacements arrived at the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
Almost everyone had a story of a long-lost relative calling and expressing 
surprised relief. How did you live through it? 
</P>
<P>
The ripple effect of the worry could be measured in phone calls. General 
Telephone said volume went up 50% in Southern California in the aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents were a little sheepish. Columnist Caen wrote: "Without 
minimizing the death and destruction, the quake for most of us is an 
inconvenience." 
</P>
<P>
Which is not, however, to minimize the inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
"We need underwear -- men's, women's, children's. Clean!" an Oakland Red Cross 
worker pleaded. "We have people here with nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Across the bay at the San Francisco Salvation Army shelter, the needy got what 
was available, possible needs notwithstanding. Relief packets sadly contained a 
pair of white shoe laces, a bar of soap and a penny. 
</P>
<P>
As millions endured these persistent and many disruptions of their lives, they 
found themselves freshly annoyed and wondering Friday. What suddenly happened 
to the high-spirited, civic-mindedness that pulled them together in a 
split-second Tuesday? Why did people choose today to start leaning on their 
infernal car horns? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it seemed as if the shock was wearing off fast. 
</P>
<P>
Other big California earthquakes, such as the Sylmar shake of 1971, resulted in 
widespread stories of people vowing to leave a place where the earth can ruin 
your life in an instant. Such stories were rare here. People prided themselves 
that they were psyched for it. They knew it was coming. 
</P>
<P>
At the Armed Forces Center, not a single would-be recruit looked for a fast 
ticket out of town. "We're waiting for another tremor. Then maybe we'll get 
some business," joked a Marine gunnery sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown, taxi driver Elwyn Peckham was among the many who kept telling 
themselves, "Remember, this wasn't the big one that we've been waiting for." 
</P>
<P>
Peckham was typical. Had The Little Big One made him more confident or more 
apprehensive in facing the prospects of a giant quake? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just fatalistic. I'm going to have to deal with it when it comes. It's 
part of the choice I made when I decided to live in earthquake country."

A Soviet Ilyushin 76 transport plane slammed into a mountain in the southern 
republic of Armenia on Friday, killing all 17 people aboard, in the second 
crash in three days involving that type of aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet television said the aircraft was carrying building materials from the 
Volga city of Ulyanovsk to Leninakan, Armenia's second largest city, which was 
devastated by last December's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed just 12 miles short of the airport. The government newspaper 
Izvestia said seven crew members, three trainee crew members and seven 
passengers died. 
</P>
<P>
No reason was given for the accident and a government commission was set up to 
investigate. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, an Ilyushin 76 carrying troops in the republic of Azerbaijan 
plunged into the Caspian Sea, killing all 57 people on board. 
</P>
<P>
Troops have been sent in increasing numbers to the neighboring republics of 
Armenia and Azerbaijan to deal with increased violence over the disputed 
territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. At least 120 people have died in 20 months of 
unrest in the region.

U.S. HAILS NEW E. BLOC ARMS MONITORING PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
VERIFICATION: NATO INSPECTORS WOULD GET UNPRECEDENTED ACCESS TO WARSAW PACT AIR 
BASES.

Bush Administration officials responded warmly Friday to a new Warsaw Pact 
proposal for monitoring cuts in conventional arms, saying that it appears to 
"parallel" the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's position and could help 
produce a formal agreement in six months to a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The East proposals on verification appear to be based on the concepts that 
NATO presented . . ., " said State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, 
adding: "We are pleased." 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney also described the plan as a positive step. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is encouraging in that it shows a willingness on their part to very 
seriously engage in this question of conventional arms reductions in Europe," 
Cheney said in a wire service interview. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet plan was presented Thursday in Vienna, where talks will resume Nov. 
9 on reaching military parity between NATO and the Warsaw Pact on conventional 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
The East Bloc's proposal would provide Western inspection teams with 
unprecedented access to Warsaw Pact air bases, according to Administration 
officials. The Warsaw Pact could not refuse an inspection team's request to 
enter specific bases. Once there, inspectors would have free access to the 
base, "to the point of climbing into the cockpits," one observer noted. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Soviets proposed that aircraft subject to limits would be 
rolled out of their hangars upon request. In addition, all aircraft would be 
electronically "marked" with identification codes to facilitate each side's 
counting of opposing aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviets are clearly interested today in getting results in Vienna by next 
summer," a senior West German official said in response to the latest 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
In May, President Bush sought to accelerate the conventional arms talks by 
calling for NATO negotiators to come forth with detailed proposals by this fall 
and a completed agreement by next summer. Since then, the alliances have 
briskly traded proposals designed to limit aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent concession, the Warsaw Pact broadened its definition of Warsaw Pact 
aircraft that should be covered by the negotiations and proposed a lower limit 
on warplanes -- 4,700 aircraft -- than NATO had advanced. 
</P>
<P>
But not all elements of Moscow's package were greeted with satisfaction. The 
proposal would prohibit countries on either side from establishing new air 
bases or expanding existing ones within another country. Officials fear that 
the provision would bar the United States from shifting its aircraft in the 
face of changing war plans or demands by its allies. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, for instance, is seeking a new NATO home for its 401st 
fighter wing, which Spain ejected from Torrejon Air Base last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets offered the concessions in hopes that NATO would drop its 
opposition to counting rules that could leave the Warsaw Pact with an advantage 
in aircraft, officials believe. The Warsaw Pact, pointing to the threat posed 
by U.S. carrier-based aircraft as well as by long-range bombers, has insisted 
that the negotiated limits exempt its air defense interceptors as well as jet 
trainers. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, NATO has insisted that all aircraft capable of shooting and based 
between the Atlantic and the Ural Mountains should be subject to the negotiated 
limits.

This country's military leaders announced measures Friday that could bar Aung 
San Suu Kyi and other detained opposition leaders from running in next year's 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ruling military council in Myanmar, formerly Burma, told a 
news conference that anyone in detention would not be eligible for candidate 
nomination, which will take place in December. 
</P>
<P>
"Aung San Suu Kyi and others who are detained or arrested cannot stand for 
nomination and election if they are not released at the times of nomination and 
elections," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
He did not say whether the army would release Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of 
the largest opposition party, the League for Democracy, and its vice chairman 
Tin Oo, who were placed under house arrest July 20 for up to one year. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the more than 200 parties registered with the Elections 
Commission must nominate candidates in December. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats have said hundreds of politicians have been arrested since a renewed 
crackdown against opposition parties in July and said they doubted elections 
held under such conditions would be free and fair.

ALL-STAR CAST PAYS HOMAGE TO OLIVIER

It was Laurence Olivier's last production, and it was played at noon Friday by 
an all-star cast in a grand setting -- the stately Westminster Abbey, where the 
ashes of the late king of the British theater will be buried next year near a 
bust of Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of England's best-known performers gathered for a memorial service for 
Olivier, who died three months ago at age 82. They were led by John Gielgud and 
Alec Guinness, the only surviving actors of Olivier's generation whose talent 
and reputations approach his own. 
</P>
<P>
A procession of actors carried mementos of Olivier's life and career to the 
altar. They were led by Douglas Fairbanks Jr., who carried the insignia of the 
Order of Merit given Olivier by Queen Elizabeth II in 1981. He was followed by 
Michael Caine cradling the special Oscar awarded Olivier in 1979 for lifetime 
achievement. Paul Scofield, Maggie Smith, Peter O'Toole, Derek Jacobi and Frank 
Finley followed with other personal treasures. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Plowright, Olivier's third wife, and their three children sat alongside 
the altar, as did Jill Esmond, his first wife. His second wife, actress Vivien 
Leigh, died in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
As was usually the case during his life, Olivier had the last word -- a spoken 
excerpt from his film "Henry V" in which the king addresses his troops before 
the battle of Agincourt. In a few months, the great actor's ashes will reside 
several dozen yards from the spot where the king he played so perfectly is 
buried.

City lawmakers in the Chinese capital have called for jails to be built to 
house prostitutes and urged severe punishment, including the death sentence, 
for anyone who induces or coerces women into prostitution, the official New 
China News Agency said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The municipal government was discussing a draft bill to give the capital its 
first anti-prostitution statutes, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
China has national laws against prostitution, but penalties are generally 
light. According to a 1986 law, women caught selling sexual favors are detained 
for less than 15 days or, in more serious cases, sent to labor reform camps.

U.S., BRITAIN REBUFF BID TO RESERVE ANTARCTICA FOR WILDLIFE

Britain and the United States have kept their hopes of issuing mining licenses 
in the Antarctic alive by refusing to accept proposals to turn the continent 
into a wildlife reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve days of talks here among the 39 Antarctic Treaty nations, discussions 
dominated by the mining issue, broke up Friday night with a wide division 
between the pro- and anti-mining nations. 
</P>
<P>
Australia and France had proposed that Antarctica be turned into a wilderness 
park and that the Minerals Convention of 1988, which took six years to 
negotiate, be scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
Britain and the United States refused to discuss this proposal and insisted 
that the conference should talk about implementing the convention and discuss 
clauses that would apportion liability in the case of mining pollution. The 
Minerals Convention creates a framework for mining under strict environmental 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the conference, it was decided to hold another two meetings in 
Chile next year. One would discuss comprehensive environmental issues for the 
Antarctic and the second would talk about accident liability clauses for 
minerals. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides refused to compromise but were aware that walking out of the meeting 
would have destroyed the Antarctic Treaty system that has controlled the region 
for 30 years, prevented armed conflict and promoted scientific cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
John Heap, head of Britain's delegation, said London is not prepared to discuss 
the wilderness park idea if it excludes all mining. 
</P>
<P>
"The last great wilderness is the size of the United States and Europe put 
together," Heap said. "Is it inevitable that a mine site somewhere in 
Antarctica would despoil all Antarctica? I don't believe it is." 
</P>
<P>
Chief U.S. representative Tucker Scully said that the meeting had agreed on 
other urgent practical steps to protect the environment, including tighter 
rules on marine pollution and waste disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Litter from the 9,000 scientists stationed on the icecap during the summer, 
plus an estimated 3,000 tourists each year, has already started to pollute the 
coasts where both people and wildlife cluster. 
</P>
<P>
French officials said the conference had been a failure because Britain and the 
United States had refused to discuss their proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Barnes, from the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition, representing 300 
environmental organizations, said that the wilderness park proposals were still 
on the table, something he said "gives us more time to push our case." 
</P>
<P>
"The tide is running our way," Barnes said. "We believe the minerals regime 
will never be implemented now, although it may take a long time to kill."

HUNGARY TO BE PROCLAIMED REPUBLIC ON REVOLT ANNIVERSARY

<P>
Parliament overwhelmingly passed legislation Friday providing for Hungary's 
first free elections in 42 years and agreed to proclaim Hungary a republic on 
Monday -- the anniversary of the 1956 revolution crushed by Soviet tanks. 
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic climax to a week in which numerous measures were adopted to 
transform Hungary from a one-party Communist state to a Western-style 
democracy, the Parliament voted to declare Oct. 23 a national day of 
commemoration. 
</P>
<P>
It also accepted the recommendation of Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth that 
Speaker Matyas Szuros declare Hungary a republic from the balcony of Parliament 
at noon Monday -- precisely 33 years after the first mass demonstrations for 
political reforms that were put down by the Soviet army. 
</P>
<P>
The vote on the electoral law was 286-to-20 with 24 abstentions after extensive 
debate on how many candidates should be elected on individual merit and how 
many as members of political parties. 
</P>
<P>
In propelling Hungary toward Western-style democracy, the lawmakers also 
declared a rehabilitation for all who were declared guilty of political crimes 
and interned "in an unlawful manner" between 1945 and 1963. 
</P>
<P>
The legislators asked the government to provide a proposal on paying damages to 
those who suffered for their political views. It is estimated that between 1949 
and 1953 alone, 1 million people -- more than 10% of the population -- suffered 
in some manner because of their political beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers also voted overwhelmingly Friday to disband the dreaded Workers 
Militia. The 60,000-strong volunteer armed police force was created after the 
1956 uprising by the now-defunct Hungarian Socialist Workers Party, or 
Communist Party. Communist reformists dissolved the Socialist Workers Party 
earlier this month and created the new Hungarian Socialist Party. 
</P>
<P>
The upcoming elections will be the first free elections since 1947, when the 
various political parties were allowed to run candidates.

A 25-year-old Polish sailor who jumped ship in Alaska has been denied asylum in 
the United States by a judge who said recent political changes in Poland make 
it safe for him to return. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration Judge Jesse Sellers said Roman Marczak has nothing to fear from a 
recently formed government in Poland that includes representation from the 
Solidarity movement. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the applicant has failed to prove a well-founded fear of persecution 
by the present government of Poland," Sellers said after an eight-hour hearing 
Thursday. "Prior to those recent changes, I think he would have had a 
well-founded fear." 
</P>
<P>
"I am surprised," Marczak said through an interpreter. "I will be persecuted. I 
will be jailed. I might lose my life if I am returned to Poland because the 
media there know that I have asked for asylum." 
</P>
<P>
Marczak disagreed with the judge's contention that political conditions in his 
homeland would tolerate his application for asylum in the United States. "The 
police and the army are still under the communists," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He is assured of remaining in the United States for up to another four months 
as his case is appealed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bad decision based on an erroneous legal standard," said Dan Kowalski, 
Marczak's lawyer. "I'm very pessimistic about the other cases. If this case 
can't win, I'm dubious that any of the other cases will win. This was one of 
the stronger cases." 
</P>
<P>
Marczak was one of nine fishermen who defected in Anchorage in mid-August. All 
are being held here in the Immigration and Naturalization Service's detention 
unit.

DINKINS TELLS WHY HE CUT VALUE OF STOCK BEFORE SELLING IT TO SON 
</P>

<P>
Democratic mayoral candidate David N. Dinkins, conceding that his campaign had 
become "an accounting morass," sought Friday to explain why he had valued 
shares of stock differently on forms he filed with New York City and New York 
state. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Dinkins listed the value of the stock he held in the Inner City 
Broadcasting Co. at more than $1 million in a state background questionnaire he 
filed because he was a candidate for a seat on the board of the New York State 
Urban Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the same year, he valued the stock at $20,000 to $60,000 in a public 
financial disclosure form he filed with the city. In January, 1986, he 
transferred the stock to his son for a $58,000 promissory note due by 1991, 
with interest. 
</P>
<P>
With an accountant at his side, the Manhattan borough president told a packed 
news conference that he had placed the $1-million-plus figure on the stock 
after consulting with Percy E. Sutton, Inner City Broadcasting's chairman, who 
is a longtime friend and political mentor. The company is not publicly traded. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the price he charged his son for the stock was consistent with the 
price that Inner City had offered to redeem the securities for -- $94 a share 
-- during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing I value more than my integrity," Dinkins said. " . . . I'm 
here to answer every question and to make as full a disclosure as I possibly 
can." 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins said he had viewed Sutton's valuation of the company with a touch of 
skepticism because it was applying for cable television franchises in four or 
five cities, and, "if those deals fell apart . . . it might have been less." 
</P>
<P>
But, over the years, Inner City has prospered. Some financial analysts have 
placed the value of the company's radio stations at as much as $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not sell it (the stock) to my son at a below-market price," the 
candidate said. "I'm selling it to my son. I'm not out to make a profit. I just 
wanted to make a reasonable transfer." 
</P>
<P>
When stock sales are reported, capital gains taxes are paid on the difference 
between the purchase price of shares and the market value when the securities 
are sold. This computation is relatively simple with publicly traded companies. 
But, when a company is not traded in the securities markets, valuations become 
more complex. Accountants study such items as earnings and the balance sheet to 
fix a sales price. 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins will not have to pay capital gains taxes until his son pays him for the 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he has a substantial lead in the polls over former U.S. Atty. 
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican who is also running as the Liberal Party 
candidate in the Nov. 7 election, the question of Dinkins' finances is 
sensitive to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Two decades ago, Dinkins did not pay his income taxes for four years in a row 
-- a fact Giuliani has stressed in commercials. Because of his tax problem, 
Dinkins had to step down as the choice of then-Mayor Abraham D. Beame to become 
a deputy mayor. Dinkins later paid the taxes, including penalties, and has 
repeatedly apologized for his actions.

ASTRONAUTS SEE BRILLIANT SOUTHERN LIGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
SPACE: THE DISPLAY IS CAUSED BY RADIATION FROM A SOLAR STORM. THE SHUTTLE CREW 
IS NOT IMPERILED.

<P>
The fickle Earth, which shook Northern California to its knees Tuesday, put on 
one of its prettiest faces Friday for five astronauts orbiting the planet. 
</P>
<P>
A brilliant display of the southern lights blazed across the sky as the space 
shuttle Atlantis sped over Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really spectacular," Atlantis commander Donald E. Williams told 
Mission Control at the Johnson Space Center here. 
</P>
<P>
The lights exploded across the entire horizon, dancing and flashing in an 
exhibition of nature as the ultimate artist. 
</P>
<P>
"It started out mostly green . . . and now it has some oranges and reds and 
violets," Williams said. "It almost looks like rain coming down from the 
universe onto the atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
The lights are of more than aesthetic interest to the astronauts. They are 
caused by high energy particles from the sun striking molecules in Earth's 
upper atmosphere, and they are most dramatic when the sun erupts in enormous 
storms, as it has been for the last few days. 
</P>
<P>
Those solar storms can also knock out communications and affect satellites and 
spacecraft. But officials at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
said Thursday that they had evaluated the burst of energy and determined that 
the astronauts aboard Atlantis are not in danger. 
</P>
<P>
Solar storms can cause unstable satellites to tumble from the sky. The shuttle 
is in a stable orbit, 184 miles above Earth, and the dramatic show posed no 
threat to the Atlantis or its crew. 
</P>
<P>
NASA officials closely monitor all solar storms to be sure they do not cause 
any problems for the shuttle. An unusually intense storm, for example, could 
expose the crew to potentially harmful levels of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
Some recent solar storms have reduced NASA's chances of rescuing a research 
satellite the size of a school bus that is threatening to tumble from orbit and 
crash on Earth. The Long Duration Exposure Facility, as the satellite is known, 
was to have been retrieved from orbit several years ago, but the explosion of 
the shuttle Challenger delayed the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
NASA plans to retrieve the satellite by the end of the year, but time is 
running out, and solar storms reduce the time even further. The storms cause 
Earth's lower atmosphere to expand, pushing air molecules to higher elevations, 
causing a slight drag on the satellite. 
</P>
<P>
By February, NASA scientists believe, the orbit of the Long Duration Exposure 
Facility will have degraded to the point that it will no longer be safe for the 
shuttle to come up beneath the satellite, as required for the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle is scheduled to land Monday at 12:38 p.m. at Edwards Air Force 
Base, but several options are being considered because marginal weather 
conditions have been forecast for the Southern California facility. The winds 
could be a little higher than NASA prefers, so officials are considering 
extending the flight a day or two if the weather could be expected to improve. 
</P>
<P>
Alternative landing fields also are being considered. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Williams, the shuttle's crew includes Michael J. McCulley, the 
pilot, Shannon W. Lucid, Franklin R. Chang-Diaz and Ellen S. Baker.

FAA GROUNDS PILOT WHO PASSED OUT AND CRASHED IN ATLANTIC OCEAN

The head of the Federal Aviation Administration has grounded Thomas Root, the 
pilot who was rescued from the Atlantic Ocean after passing out at the controls 
of his plane three months ago, the agency announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Root, a Washington communications lawyer, said that he will comply with the 
suspension of his medical certificate by FAA Administrator James B. Busey. 
</P>
<P>
But he said: "I don't need the FAA to tell me it would be dumb to fly." Root 
said he does not know what caused him to lapse into unconsciousness on July 13 
while his plane flew on autopilot for 800 miles until it ran out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Busey took the action because Root has refused to supply all relevant medical 
documents, including psychiatric records from his treatment in Hollywood, Fla., 
after his flight, the FAA said. 
</P>
<P>
Root suffered from a gunshot wound that he said must have occurred when a 
pistol he kept in the cockpit discharged, apparently as the plane hit the water 
off Bermuda. However, the gun's manufacturer has said it is not possible that 
the gun could have discharged in that manner. 
</P>
<P>
Root said that he no longer owns a plane and has not flown since the incident, 
which occurred during a business flight from Washington, D.C., to Rocky Mount, 
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a very foolhardy thing for me to do to go flying without knowing 
what caused the blackout," Root said. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated Wednesday, FAA counsel Donald P. Byrne ordered Root to 
surrender his pilot's medical certificate, which is required, along with a 
pilot's certificate, in order to fly. 
</P>
<P>
Root's pilot's certificate was not suspended, and he said that, if allowed, he 
would try to keep it current by flying with an instructor. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne told Root that the administrator had ordered the suspension as an 
emergency measure and that "safety in air transportation or air commerce 
requires the immediate effectiveness of this order." 
</P>
<P>
The letter said that Root had 10 days to appeal to the National Transportation 
Safety Board, which is investigating the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Root has challenged in court the board's effort to obtain his psychiatric 
records, contending that Florida law protects their confidentiality. He said 
that turning them over to the FAA probably would waive his right to deny their 
use to the safety board, because both are government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Root's attorney, Gene Propper, said that the hospital had refused to release 
the psychiatric records but had inadvertently sent them to the safety board, 
along with other medical documents. 
</P>
<P>
Propper said that the records cover a mandatory interview Root had with a 
psychiatrist before he was released from the hospital.

Japan, the world's largest consumer of ivory, agreed to abide by an 
international ban on ivory imports, a move seen as vital to the effort to save 
the African elephant from extinction. The announcement came on the last day of 
a two-week conference in Lausanne, Switzerland, of CITES, the French acronym 
for the International Convention on Trade in Endangered Species. A ban could 
never be effective without Japan, a CITES spokesman said, since that country 
"accounts for around 40% of world imports of ivory." Some conservationists 
estimate that the number of African elephants has been halved in the past 
decade, plunging from around 1.3 million to the 625,000 mark.

A tour bus filled with vacationers crashed into a truck 320 miles north of 
Sydney, killing at least 20 people, including seven members of one family, 
police said. Both drivers were among the dead in the head-on collision in 
Australia's worst road accident. Police said sleeping passengers were tossed on 
the road on a notorious two-lane stretch of the Pacific Highway between Sydney 
and Brisbane. Colin Ormsesher, an advertising executive on a New South Wales 
newspaper, survived the crash, but the dead included his wife, their two 
teen-age children, his brother, sister-in-law and their two children.

U.S. military experts left Bangkok, Thailand, for the eighth joint field 
investigation to resolve the fates of American soldiers missing in action from 
the Vietnam War, a U.S. Embassy official said. For about 15 days, the two U.S. 
teams will join Vietnamese authorities in investigating areas in Song Be 
province and Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam and Ha Bac province near 
Hanoi, the official said. About 2,340 Americans are listed as missing in action 
in the war, which also involved fighting in Cambodia and Laos. Vietnam returned 
what it said were believed to be the remains of three missing Americans on 
Sept. 11.

Eskimos, Indians and Aleuts declared war against a disease ravaging their 
people: alcoholism. A blue ribbon commission of native leaders stood before the 
1,000 delegates to the Alaska Federation of Natives convention and before many 
more watching on statewide television in some 200 villages and begged Alaska's 
aboriginal people to give up liquor. Alcohol is linked to nearly all violence, 
injuries and suicides involving Alaska natives, who make up 15% of the state's 
population. "You are a strong people," Gov. Steve Cowper told the delegates. " 
. . . I urge you to use that strength here again."

FIRE: THREE DAYS AFTER THE BAY-AREA EARTHQUAKE SHUT DOWN THEIR SAN FRANCISCO 
BRANCHES, STATE JUSTICE WORKERS HAVE BEEN FORCED FROM THEIR MID-WILSHIRE 
QUARTERS. 
</P>

<P>
Only three days after the Bay-Area earthquake shut down their San Francisco 
branches, the state attorney general's office and the California appellate and 
Supreme courts were forced out of their quarters in Los Angeles on Friday by a 
fire in a Mid-Wilshire high-rise. 
</P>
<P>
The 12:30 a.m. blaze, which engulfed a top-floor corner of the western 
structure of twin-tower Paramount Plaza, damaged court records and idled 
hundreds of state employees indefinitely, attorney general's spokesman Duane 
Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt in the fire, which caused an estimated $2 million in damage to 
the 21-story tower at 3580 Wilshire Blvd., according to Los Angeles Fire 
Department spokesman Alan Barrios. Eleven floors of the building sustained 
smoke and water damage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire is still under investigation, Barrios said. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said the state offices store records on the top floor of the building, 
but only documents from the 2nd District Court of Appeal suffered damage. There 
has not been a full inspection to determine how many documents were lost, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Holton, a spokeswoman for the state Supreme Court, said the fire would 
inconvenience the public rather than the Supreme Court because the high court's 
Los Angeles office is used only for the filing of cases. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire doesn't really affect court operations," she said from the court's 
Sacramento offices. "But it'll be a problem for people who need to file 
documents because they'll have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not think that's a substantial problem . . . if the building is closed 
for one day. But if it's closed for a long time, it could be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court justices will hear cases at another location in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Court of Appeal, which does hear arguments in the Los Angeles 
building, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident that no ongoing trials will be hampered," Peterson said. "But 
for longer-term appeals, it remains to be seen what will happen." 
</P>
<P>
After the fire, Peterson said, about 100 of the 450 employees in his office 
were able to work out of offices in the adjoining tower. But he was unsure how 
long the small team could handle the mounting workload. 
</P>
<P>
"If the dislocation is just a few days," he said, "we won't feel the effects 
much at all. . . . If it's permanently closed and we have to relocate 350 
people, that may pose a problem." 
</P>
<P>
But the Los Angeles employees were less concerned for themselves than for their 
colleagues in the Bay Area, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a burden to recover from the fire, but we can make do," 
Peterson said. "Compared to what happened in San Francisco, the Los Angeles 
employees know that . . . our loss was negligible." 
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's devastating quake, the San Francisco building that houses the 
courts and the attorney general's office suffered structural damage. Engineers 
are determining whether it can ever be safely used. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said employees from the San Francisco branch of the state Supreme 
Court had been expected to move into the Los Angeles office Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, they can't use the offices here, either," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount Plaza officials posted signs saying the damaged building will remain 
closed at least until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But inspectors from the Department of Building and Safety, who condemned the 
21st floor of the tower, said the building could be closed much longer because 
of dangerous levels of asbestos within the structure. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very serious concern to the department and to the tenants," said Robert 
Picott, deputy superintendent of the department. "Our inspection people were 
asked to leave because of the asbestos problem in the air." 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors will not go back into the building until "there is certification 
that the air level is safe to breathe," he said.

COURT AFFIRMS BAN ON TINTING CAR WINDOWS; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: IN A CASE STEMMING FROM AN EL CAJON TRAFFIC STOP, TINTING WAS HELD TO 
OBSTRUCT VISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Drivers cannot legally apply tinting on the windshields and front-side windows 
of their vehicles, a state appeal court has affirmed. 
</P>
<P>
It is all right, under certain conditions, to tint rear-side windows not needed 
for driver visibility, but it is illegal to tint the windshield and front-side 
windows because drivers may not be able to see out well enough, according to 
the 4th District Court of Appeal in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The three-judge panel also ruled that drivers can be convicted of violating the 
California law regulating windshield and front-window tinting based solely on a 
police officer's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The opinion, which resulted from an El Cajon traffic stop, marked the first 
time a California appellate court has upheld that such tinting is not 
permissible, said Joel M. Geller, the El Cajon lawyer who represented the 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the decision reflects the best interests of the people of the 
state of California, who need protection from the sun's rays in their cars," 
Geller said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people are putting 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 miles a year on their car," he 
said. "They have no recourse from the sun unless they are in an economic 
position to buy a new car or have factory-installed windows." 
</P>
<P>
Geller's client, Robert Niebauer, was stopped Feb. 27, 1988, by California 
Highway Patrol officer Kenneth Wood, who cited him for driving his 1987 Ford 
truck with dark tinting material on the side windows and told him to have the 
material removed. 
</P>
<P>
Niebauer, however, challenged the ticket in court, where El Cajon Municipal 
Judge Larrie R. Brainard found him guilty June 6, 1988, of violating the law. 
Brainard sentenced Niebauer to one year's probation plus a fine and fee 
totaling $40. 
</P>
<P>
Niebauer turned to the appellate division of the San Diego Superior Court but 
lost again. Niebauer then appealed one more time, to the 4th District, 
contending that the law is unconstitutional because it interferes with 
interstate commerce. 
</P>
<P>
A 1985 case from the appellate division of the San Bernardino County Superior 
Court had held that the law does, in fact, illegally burden interstate commerce 
and is unconstitutional, Niebauer argued. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Richard Huffman, however, said that case was not binding because it was a 
Superior Court, not appeal court, decision. In addition, it could not be relied 
upon because the driver in that case, who was stopped in California, was from 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Further, an expert witness who had testified in the San Bernardino case had 
said that Arizona allowed tinting that permitted only 34% of the light to pass. 
The California rule, based on the federal stand 
</P>
<P>
ard, calls for 70% of the light to pass through the window, Huffman said. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman also rejected Niebauer's contention that Wood, the CHP officer, should 
have had to use a light meter or similar tool to measure just how much light 
could pass through his windows. The Legislature wanted a "common-sense" 
approach to enforcement, Huffman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't call upon the officers to be scientists or carry around and use 
burdensome equipment to measure light transmittance, nor do we expect them to 
discuss the sufficiency or insufficiency of the light transmittance as if they 
were an expert witness on the subject," Huffman said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, an officer's testimony that windows were darker than normal, 
assuming the officer formed that opinion after a "common-sense examination" of 
a vehicle, can be enough by itself for a conviction -- as long as the judge 
believes the officer, Huffman said. 
</P>
<P>
Judges Howard Wiener and Daniel Kremer joined the opinion, which was filed 
Wednesday.

Since Oct. 12, when the zoo abruptly fired Trunk &amp; Hump, the elephant and 
camel ride company, it has not allowed the elephants, Katie and Gypsy, to play 
in its recreation areas, according to their keeper, Steve Whitebread. When 
Whitebread let them exercise in the smaller ride area, he said, zoo officials 
told him to stop because they were ruining the foliage. Whitebread disobeyed. 
</P>
<P>
"I just decided there's no way we'd leave them chained up all day," he said. 
"The zoo cut us off. Their attitude is, 'Just keep (the elephants) quiet, don't 
let anybody see them, and get them out of here as soon as possible.' " 
</P>
<P>
The zoo's eagerness to hide the elephants was evident Friday morning, when 
employees put up four 8-foot wooden barriers to hide Katie and Gypsy from 
public view. Georgeanne Irvine, a zoo spokeswoman, said the blinds were erected 
after a keeper saw a family climb the low fence and begin petting the animals. 
"It was a potential safety hazard," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine acknowledged that the elephants have not used zoo recreation areas all 
week, but attributed that to a series of misunderstandings. Whoever told 
Whitebread that the areas were off-limits was mistaken, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize they need to exercise," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Whitebread's criticism comes at a time when the zoo is particularly sensitive 
about its treatment of elephants because of news stories last year about Dunda, 
an elephant that was beaten by its keepers after being moved from the zoo to 
the San Diego Wild Animal Park. 
</P>
<P>
Whitebread said zoo officials have told him that, because they expect national 
news attention to focus on the Soviet arts festival, which kicks off Sunday, 
they want the Trunk &amp; Hump animals out by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Whitebread said that is impossible. His 
</P>
<P>
employer, Trunk &amp; Hump owner Marty Dinnes, has a ranch in Saugus, north of 
Los Angeles, where he can put the two camels, Doc and Walter, still living at 
the zoo. But the elephants will be harder to house. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't give him any notice, so he's not sure what to do with them," 
Whitebread said. Dinnes was in New York on Friday and could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, zoo officials said they had canceled the contract with Dinnes 
because of space constraints. Jeff Jouett, a zoo spokesman, said animals from 
the zoo's Chit Chat Show will be moved into the area until a $5.5-million 
renovation of their home, Wegeforth Bowl, is complete. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine said the zoo's contract with Dinnes specifies that each party would give 
30 days' notice before canceling the rides, but she said that last week both 
had agreed to end the rides immediately and that the zoo would pay Dinnes for 
30 more days, about $14,000. 
</P>
<P>
From Oct. 12 until Friday, the two Asian elephants had spent most of their time 
in the camel barns, with chains around one front and one hind leg. Because of 
the configuration of the open-air barns, the animals cannot be together. 
Because of poor drainage, they often stand for hours in their own urine. 
Whitebread, who feeds the elephants and cleans their cages twice a day, said 
they have sorely missed what used to be a thrice-weekly ritual: their visits to 
the zoo's elephant recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
"They hate being chained," said Whitebread, a part-time San Diego State 
University student who has worked with Katie and Gypsy since they arrived at 
the zoo six years ago. "They used to love playing and swimming in that yard." 
</P>
<P>
As Whitebread spoke with a reporter and photographer Friday, Tom Hall, the 
zoo's operations manager, appeared. "Have you heard?" he asked Whitebread. "You 
can use our recreation area any time you want." 
</P>
<P>
Whitebread thanked him, but later said: "Of course I hadn't heard. He hadn't 
told me. They've never let us use the yard any time we want. Never." 
</P>
<P>
Whitebread says that for years he has asked the zoo to make changes in the 
camel barns that would improve the elephants' living conditions. He asked for 
the wall between the two barns to be torn down so the elephants could huddle 
together. He asked for grooves to be cut into the concrete floors of the barns 
to provide drainage. In the winter, when the open-air barns left the animals 
exposed to the cold, he asked for some kind of wind barrier. 
</P>
<P>
"Marty Dinnes said he'd pay for half of anything they did, that he wanted the 
best, but they wouldn't do it," Whitebread said, turning to look at the 
barriers the zoo had installed Friday. "When I asked, they couldn't do it. But 
when they want it done, it happens overnight." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine said: "We've made some improvements, but there haven't been a lot. 
Sometimes things move slowly around here." She said recent estimates showed 
that it would cost $30,000 to $50,000 to provide the improvements Whitebread 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
Whitebread said he is worried about what will happen to the elephants once they 
leave the zoo. Katie, a 23-year-old, rambunctious animal who stands nearly 10 
feet tall, will fare best, he said. During her time at the zoo, she has 
occasionally traveled to other locations to work on movies or magazine photo 
assignments, he said. "She can adjust to anything." 
</P>
<P>
But Gypsy is older and more set in her ways. Records put her age at 38 years, 
but elephant keepers believe that the wrinkled, 8-foot-tall animal may be as 
old as 60. "It's hard to say, because every time an elephant is sold, they 
knock a few years off to get a better price," Whitebread said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time Katie went away, Gypsy would just cower without her," said Steve 
Friedlund, a keeper who works with the zoo's elephants. "She's just a 
frightened old lady elephant. She's worn out." 
</P>
<P>
Friedlund said he believes Whitebread has done a good job with the elephants, 
given the limited resources available to him. "But wherever Marty Dinnes takes 
these elephants next and whatever yahoo help he hires -- who knows what these 
elephants will suffer." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Humane Society of San Diego, Larry Boersma, said it has 
been two weeks since the society received any complaints about Gypsy and Katie. 
The society investigated those complaints, which alleged that the animals were 
not being well cared for, but found no basis for intervention, he said.

TALES OF COWBOY BOOTS AND BOOT CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As military receptions go, it was an eclectic gathering. A millionaireland 
baron, old ranch managers, a teacher-turned-author, retired Marines and, uh, Yo 
Yo Oliveras. 
</P>
<P>
The common thread: They have worked at, lived on -- or owned -- what is now the 
Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base between Oceanside and San Clemente. And 
Wednesday night they got together to swap old stories of an earlier time, when 
cattle -- not infantrymen -- were run on these rolling hills. 
</P>
<P>
That gets us to Yo Yo, who came dressed for the party in the 160-year-old ranch 
house in his vaquero duds and Stetson hat. A mischievous grin stretched across 
his dark, weathered face, and he started to giggle when, after some urging, he 
agreed to tell his story. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the 1930s. Oliveras was one of the ranch hands at what was then known 
as Rancho Santa Margarita, where tens of thousands of cattle were being 
fattened for market on the ranch's tall coastal grasses. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese cooks would go into Oceanside on Saturday nights to drink, play 
pool and play poker," Oliveras remembered. "They'd throw a bunch of cold 
sandwiches at us for dinner before they left." 
</P>
<P>
But the vaqueros had something else in mind for their Saturday supper, and one 
night decided to get even. 
</P>
<P>
"We tied their Model Ts to the palm trees with chains," he said, his smile 
touching his ears. "We said that, for $100, we'd tell them which one of us did 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the cooks took the tires off their cars, slipped the chains off the 
axles and went into town, delayed but determined. 
</P>
<P>
And the vaqueros stewed in their sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
Life on the rancho. 
</P>
<P>
The old ranch house -- built in 1828 by Pio Pico, the last Mexican governor of 
California -- is now impeccably restored and reserved as the home of Camp 
Pendleton's commander. These days the occupants are Brig. Gen. Richard Huckaby 
and his wife, Jan. 
</P>
<P>
The Huckabys played host to Wednesday's reception to honor Jerome W. 
Baumgartner, a descendant of one of the rancho's early families and the author 
of "Rancho Santa Margarita Remembered," an account -- based largely on taped 
interviews with his own father -- of the history of the ranch-turned-military 
base. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Jerome Baumgartner, 87, spent his first seven years on the old ranch 
-- from 1903 to 1910 -- before the 
</P>
<P>
family moved to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"This old house is just about the same as I remembered it," he said, sipping a 
beer. "But the Marines seem to have taken better care of it than anyone else. I 
wonder what this place is worth now." 
</P>
<P>
The younger Baumgartner, who lives in Santa Barbara, had his fair share of 
attention at the reception, signing copies of his book for the docents who lead 
tours of the ranch house, where presidents have stayed. 
</P>
<P>
But the Baumgartners at times played second fiddle to others at the reception 
-- including descendants of three families who owned the ranch in succession in 
the 1800s and who used Wednesday night's get-together to compare notes and 
rekindle memories that have been passed down through the generations. 
</P>
<P>
Among those in attendance was Albert Pico, great-great-grandson of Pio Pico, 
the Mexican politician who, with brother Andres, built the ranch house. Albert 
Pico on Wednesday gave the base museum a letter written by Pio Pico to his son 
while living at the rancho. 
</P>
<P>
Richard O'Neill, whose grandfather of the same name bought half-ownership in 
the 230,000-acre ranch after the turn of the century, was also there. When the 
Marines purchased the San Diego County portion of the ranch in 1942, the 
O'Neill family kept control of the northern third -- including property that 
eventually was developed as Mission Viejo in southern Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Contemporary cattleman O'Neill has used much of his wealth, estimated by Forbes 
magazine now at upward of $200 million, to bankroll Democratic Party causes in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Also attending were descendants of John Forster, who married Pio Pico's sister 
and who, in 1864, purchased Rancho Santa Margarita from Pico, who needed the 
money to clear massive gambling debts. 
</P>
<P>
But, when Forster died in 1882, the rancho was not passed on to his heirs but 
instead taken over by banker James Flood, leaving the Forster children with no 
claim to the land that would one day be worth millions. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Forster's descendants were good-naturedly sensitive to that fact at 
Wednesday's reception, and teased about how one family -- the Forsters -- lost 
title to the land to another family -- the O'Neills, who eventually cashed in 
on part of the ranch with the development of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how rich or famous someone is, like the O'Neills, they can't really 
pull rank on us Forsters because we were here first," laughed Pat Forster, a 
great-great-grandson of John Forster who today lives in San Juan Capistrano, 
not far from the mission that the Forster family itself once owned in the early 
1800s. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, I don't want to say anything bad because I'll be taken off a lot of 
party invitation lists." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Richard O'Neill said he ended up the victor when the rancho was 
divided into thirds in 1940 and his father, Jerome O'Neill, got the northern 
70,000 or so acres that spilled into southern Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my father picked the northern third as our share because the taxes 
were less in Orange County at the time -- if you can believe that -- and he 
figured I had the $19,000 to pay them," O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
He did just fine with his share of the rancho; even though it had no 
beachfront, 11,000 acres of the property -- which was renamed Rancho Mission 
Viejo -- was sold in 1972 to the Phillip Morris Co. for more than $50 million 
for the development of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill said he tried to buy back the rest of the old rancho from the Marine 
Corps in the 1950s, "and they told me they'd give up Quantico and Perris Island 
before they gave up this place." 
</P>
<P>
Milt Taylor was invited to Huckaby's reunion because he was a corporal in 1942 
and was assigned by the base's first commanding officer, Gen. Joseph Fegan, to 
move into the ranch house and take care of things while construction around him 
started up. Taylor was the first military person to live in the old house. 
</P>
<P>
"It scared the hell out of me, being up there in that house," Taylor said 
Wednesday night. "The old house was dark and dreary, but I was so glad to get 
out of the barracks." 
</P>
<P>
The house had fallen into disrepair, and Taylor tended to chores as the 
general's orderly. 
</P>
<P>
"There would be evenings when he was going to entertain some friends at the Del 
Mar Hotel, so I'd go out into the grass and throw a rock to scare up and shoot 
some quail. They'd be on the general's dinner table that night." 
</P>
<P>
After six months at the house, "I was lying in the hammock one day and said to 
one of the guys that I kind of wish I was back in my old outfit," Taylor said. 
"I didn't know the general was there in the house, and he heard me. He said, 'I 
know where your heart is -- in combat.' Three hours later I was out doing 
physical training with my unit. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom figured I had it made, being assigned to the general's house. The next 
thing she got was a letter from me saying I was overseas. I was headed for 
Guadalcanal." 
</P>
<P>
About 20 years later, Jerome Baumgartner, great-grandson of Richard O'Neill, 
the rancho's first manager, found himself back on base. He wasn't an honored 
guest, but rather a Marine reserve hiking the backcountry with other privates 
first class. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember my grandmother suggesting that I go up, knock on the door and ask, 
'Can I look around your house? My father grew up here.' She didn't realize that 
I was still only a Pfc, and I was deathly afraid of generals," Baumgartner 
said. "She had no real sense for military decorum."

STUDENT SUES STADIUM GUARDS, FIRM OVER SCUFFLE AT SDSU GAME; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: $2 MILLION SOUGHT BY FRATERNITY MEMBER WHO CLAIMS HIS NECK WAS BROKEN 
DURING EVICTION. 
</P>

<P>
A college student who allegedly suffered a broken neck during a scuffle with 
security guards at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium filed a $2-million lawsuit 
Friday against the guards and their employer. 
</P>
<P>
John Kellogg, a San Diego State University student, alleged that security guard 
Robert Babauta kicked him, repeatedly threw him to the concrete floor, and 
picked him up by the hair while he was handcuffed after he stopped to buy a 
chocolate chip cookie while he was being kicked out of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg, 21, was among a group of about 18 Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity members 
who were being evicted for alleged rowdiness during the UCLA-SDSU football game 
on Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others Named 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Babauta, the lawsuit names the company, Pro-Tect Professional 
Service, owner Peter Hayes, guard Ralph Bruck and 100 John Does as defendants. 
The complaint charges the company, Hayes and the guards with negligence, 
assault and battery, and false imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuit filed in Superior Court, Kellogg suffered a broken 
neck and injury to his nervous system which "will result in some permanent 
disability." The suit also alleges that Pro-Tect attempted to cover up the 
incident by filing false reports with SDSU officials and state and local 
agencies that regulate security firms. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was witnessed by Lyle Van Gessel, owner of a printed-circuit 
design company. In an interview Friday, Gessel, 46, said he was at the 
concession stand, waiting to buy beer, when Kellogg and the other fraternity 
members were being escorted out of the stadium by a group of guards. 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg and another fraternity member attempted to buy chocolate chip cookies 
at the stand, when one or both of them were shoved by guards, who told the 
pair, "It isn't lunch time," Gessel said. At that point, Kellogg apparently 
attempted a getaway by dashing toward a nearby elevator, Gessel said. 
</P>
<P>
"I got my beers and went and looked in the elevator. . . . One security guy 
came out holding onto the back of (Kellogg's) collar, flinging him around. The 
fellow went to the ground. He was handcuffed, so he couldn't break his fall. He 
(Babauta) picked him up and threw him to the ground four times. The guy was 
handcuffed the entire time. I started screaming at (Babauta) and yelled, 'You 
Gestapo son of a bitch, leave him alone,' " Gessel said. 
</P>
<P>
One of Kellogg's fraternity brothers came along and began yelling at Babauta to 
leave Kellogg alone, Gessel added. Babauta then dropped Kellogg to the floor, 
and took off after the unknown student. As he ran after the student, Babauta 
yelled, "You want some of the same?" Gessel said. 
</P>
<P>
By this time Kellogg, who is 5-foot-5 and weighs 130 pounds, was crying and in 
hysterics, Gessel said. 
</P>
<P>
"(Kellogg) was bawling his head off. He was screaming, 'Leave me alone!' The 
kid's handcuffed and they're beating . . . him. I don't know what went on in 
the elevator, but the kid was 100% subdued when he came out of the elevator. He 
was not resisting," Gessel said. 
</P>
<P>
As the incident unfolded, Gessel said, he kept asking other security guards to 
take his name, because he had witnessed the alleged beating. However, nobody 
responded until a supervisor came by and encouraged him to file a complaint, 
Gessel said. 
</P>
<P>
"The supervisor told me, 'Please go file a complaint. We need to stop this sort 
of thing,' " Gessel said. 
</P>
<P>
When he filed the complaint against Babauta that night at the stadium, Gessel 
said, other guards refused to give him Babauta's badge number until another 
supervisor interceded and told him that Babauta's badge number was 165. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see any other security guards do anything out of line. Some of them 
were rather flippant in their responses, but others were extremely helpful. . . 
. I think that criminal charges should be filed against (Babauta)," Gessel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kellogg refused to talk to police after the incident, defense 
investigator Manny Lopez said a complaint will be filed against Babauta and the 
security company next week with San Diego police. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-Tect owner Hayes declined to comment on the lawsuit because he had not seen 
a copy of it. 
</P>
<P>
"But standard operating procedure is to forward it to the insurance company. 
Several years later I'll hear from the attorneys what happened in the case," 
said Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Employed 
</P>
<P>
He added that Babauta and Bruck, who could not be reached for comment on 
Friday, are still employed by his firm. Hayes said that one of the two men was 
not present on the night of the incident, but he declined to identify him. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview two weeks after the incident, Hayes said that Kellogg was in a 
rowdy student group that had been walking around the stadium "kicking trash 
cans and intimidating women in restroom lines."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WORKER, POLICE OFFICER HURT IN PET HOSPITAL 
FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fire broke out early Friday on the roof of a pet hospital near Culver City, 
injuring a construction worker and a police officer and forcing the evacuation 
of at least 80 dogs, cats and birds. 
</P>
<P>
The worker sustained minor burns to his hands and face when he tried to shut 
off the flow of propane gas used to heat tar for roof construction at Center 
Sinai Animal Hospital, fire spokesman Alan Barrios said. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City Police Officer Michael Roth suffered minor smoke inhalation while 
trying to evacuate animals from the hospital in the 10700 block of Venice 
Boulevard. Both men were taken to Brotman Memorial Medical Center, Barrios 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The animals were rushed from the building after the smoky fire ignited at 8:45 
a.m., Barrios said. None of the pets were injured in the fire, which was 
extinguished shortly after 9 a.m. No damage estimate was available. 
</P>
<P>
Flames ignited when hot tar used by workers putting a new roof on the building 
melted a hose filed with propane gas, Barrios said. The animals were returned 
to their quarters after the smoke cleared.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BALLOT FOR QUAKE-SAFE, LOW-RENT HOMES ASKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and state Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti 
(D-Los Angeles) on Friday called for a $90-million bond measure on the next 
city ballot to bring low-income rental housing up to seismic safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
A similar measure -- Proposition 3 -- to raise funds for restoration of 
pre-1933 unreinforced masonry buildings, failed by two percentage points of 
winning a required two-thirds approval from voters in April. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Bradley and the City Council, Roberti said the Northern 
California earthquake "dramatically reminded us all in Los Angeles of our own 
vulnerability and our need to be fully prepared for our own inevitable 
disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he wanted to "give voters one more chance to make the financing 
available so that all of our buildings can become earthquake safe." 
</P>
<P>
The bond measure would allow the city to make loans to strengthen low-income 
rental housing properties which are not earthquake-safe and for nonprofit 
organizations to buy and improve rental housing that is not earthquake-safe.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOTORIST SENTENCED FOR BRANDISHING HANDGUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A motorist who pointed a handgun at another driver who turned out to be a judge 
was sentenced Friday to 240 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
George H. Schaab, 45, of Culver City, also was placed on three years' probation 
by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner. Schaab was given 120 days 
credit for time already spent in custody and good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Schaab pleaded guilty Sept. 15 to one count each of brandishing a firearm and 
being a convict in possession of a concealed weapon. He had been convicted in 
1988 of possessing marijuana for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Christine Gosney said Schaab was arrested Aug. 2 shortly 
after he pointed a gun at Santa Monica Superior Court Judge Leslie Light.

Authorities said Light was stopped at 2nd and Main streets in Santa Monica, 
when a motorist in a pickup truck behind him started blowing his horn. 
</P>
<P>
Light gestured that he could not move because of a car in front of him. The 
other motorist, later identified as Schaab, then pointed a handgun at him. 
</P>
<P>
Light wrote down Schaab's license plate number and reported it to police, who 
then arrested Schaab. Police found the handgun, which was unloaded, and bullets 
in the pickup.

OFFICIALS, HOMELESS CELEBRATE REOPENING OF SKID ROW HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE MC MILLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Mayor Tom Bradley arrived at the Ellis Hotel for its ceremonial reopening 
Friday as a Skid Row hotel for senior citizens, Pat Nowlin sat right in front. 
</P>
<P>
Nowlin, 63, had been homeless for nine months until two days ago, when she 
moved into the three-story Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
"I was living on the street," said the small, thin woman, who for the special 
occasion had worn a nicely fitted white suit and black shoes she had gotten -- 
used -- from a social service. "I'd ride the bus all night. You'd be surprised 
how many elderly ladies ride the bus all night." 
</P>
<P>
Nowlin will now pay $170 of her monthly Los Angeles County relief stipend of 
$312 to reside at the Ellis. It was people like Nowlin city officials had in 
mind when they started a Skid Row hotel renovation program in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The Ellis Hotel, with 58 rooms, was renovated by the SRO Housing Corp., a 
private, nonprofit arm of the city's Community Redevelopment Agency that 
upgrades single-room-occupancy hotels on Skid Row. The ceremony Friday marked 
the reopening of both the Ellis and, across East 6th Street, the 70-unit Regal. 
</P>
<P>
SRO has now, counting the Ellis and Regal, renovated seven hotels, and Bradley 
declared the ceremony celebrating the reopenings "a joyous occasion." 
</P>
<P>
About 12% of the estimated 15,000 people living in the 50-block area of Skid 
Row east of downtown are elderly, said Faye Washington, general manager of the 
city's Department of Aging, but the Ellis will be the first hotel geared 
entirely to their needs. Washington's department contributed $55,695 to the 
hotel's renovation to install a kitchen, she added, so that meals for residents 
can be prepared there. 
</P>
<P>
Single-room-occupancy hotels, which charge about $240 a month for a 
10-by-14-foot room with bathing and toilet facilities down the hall, are the 
last line of defense for low-income people. Nowlin, for example, lost her room 
in such a place before she became homeless. "I worked since I was 11," she 
said, but in recent years found fewer and fewer people would hire her. "I don't 
know," she said, "maybe being older, that had something to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
About 200 single-room-occupancy hotels have been demolished over the last 
decade, city officials say, leaving 273 citywide. Of those, an estimated 65 are 
located on Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, the City Council voted to extend a moratorium against the 
demolition of the hotels for five years on Skid Row and three years citywide. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a milestone occasion for us," SRO Director Andy Raubeson said at the 
ceremony. "Something less than five years ago, SRO acquired its first hotel. We 
now have 11, with 1,080 units, seven of which are completely renovated."

TALK WITH RAIDERS, PANEL TOLD; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: THE LOS ANGELES COLISEUM COMMISSION IS BEING EXHORTED BY SUPERVISOR 
KENNETH HAHN TO RESTART NEGOTIATIONS TO KEEP THE TEAM FROM LEAVING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn called Friday for a restart of stalled negotiations 
between the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission and the Raiders, saying the city 
loves its football team and doesn't want to lose it. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn appeared at a press conference with a cross section of community leaders 
who voiced their wish that the Raiders stay in Los Angeles. "We worked very 
hard to get them here," Hahn said. "We would be very foolish to lose them to 
some city up north." 
</P>
<P>
Al Davis, the managing general partner for the National Football League team, 
has expressed a desire to move the team to another city. The Raiders' contract 
to play at the Coliseum runs through 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The team is being wooed by both Sacramento and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Talks between the Raiders and the Coliseum Commission broke down in June and 
snagged on a legal point. The commission filed a $57-million breach of contract 
suit against the Raiders in 1987 and have asked, as a requirement of further 
discussion, that Davis sign an agreement that would prohibit the Raiders from 
using any discussions in the negotiations as fodder in a lawsuit. Davis has 
refused to sign such an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent attempt to placate Davis and resume negotiations, Coliseum 
Commission President Richard Riordan said he would be willing to drop that 
requirement. It was unclear, though, if he meant the requirement might 
resurface in another form. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we will drop that agreement and try to get something that will satisfy 
Davis," Riordan said. "Simply, what we would like to do is to have some sort of 
an agreement that would satisfy Mr. Davis and his lawyers to the effect that 
any discussions in negotiations would not be used in any lawsuit between the 
two of us. It's that simple. 
</P>
<P>
"My argument is that it doesn't hurt Mr. Davis and it doesn't hurt us. My 
dealings with Al Davis (is) that he's tough but he's reasonable. I think we can 
come to some meeting of the minds on that." 
</P>
<P>
Davis could not be reached for comment.

BUCKEY LAWYER LIKENS MCMARTIN CASE TO WITCH TRIALS OF 1600S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Comparing the McMartin Pre-School molestation case to the Salem witch trials, 
the McCarthy hearings and the Vietnam War, a defense lawyer urged jurors Friday 
not to make Ray Buckey a scapegoat of the current "American child movement." 
</P>
<P>
"You and I are a chunk of history," he said during the second of an estimated 
four days of final arguments. "You are a part of a great social change." 
</P>
<P>
Danny Davis cautioned the jury not to get caught up in a popular notion, but to 
think for themselves and follow the law. Finding Buckey guilty, he said, would 
be tantamount to "burning a scapegoat." 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, are charged with 65 
counts of molestation and conspiracy involving 11 youngsters who attended their 
family owned Manhattan Beach nursery school in the late 1970s and early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
In his wide-ranging commentary on various epochs in American history, Davis 
appeared to be saying that decisions often reflect public opinion rather than 
truth. In the 1600s, for example, innocent people were burned as witches; in 
the 1950s, innocent people were branded and blacklisted as communists. 
</P>
<P>
Today, in a time when society has become aware of widespread child abuse and 
concerned about children's rights, innocent people may be convicted of 
molestation. Pacing in front of the jury box and looking at the individual 
panelists, Davis argued that: 
</P>
<P>
* Ray Buckey was not at the school when the older children -- whom he labeled 
"the fraudulent four" -- attended. 
</P>
<P>
* Prosecutors had failed to prove that the alleged acts happened within the 
six-year statute of limitations. 
</P>
<P>
* Two of the alleged victims refused to testify. 
</P>
<P>
* Those nine children who did testify related horrible crimes without emotion, 
in flat tones and "almost indifference to these people" they were accusing. 
</P>
<P>
* There were material changes in the children's testimony throughout the 
lengthy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
* A letter about the investigation sent to parents by the Manhattan Beach 
Police Department triggered alarm about whether or not "he (Buckey) got to my 
child." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said Manhattan Beach families were "drawn into the ambitions of a handful 
of carpetbaggers" -- a reference to interviewers at Children's Institute 
International, where hundreds of children were diagnosed as molestation 
victims, and to politically motivated prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Parents not only had to face the possibility that their children had been 
molested, he said, but to deal with guilt feelings about having sent them off 
to the nursery school while the parents went off to play tennis at the country 
club or to meetings of a local social group called the Sandpipers. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents were caught in a dramatic dilemma: 'Either my child was molested . . . 
or I bought the biggest sham in the 1980s in Los Angeles County.' " 
</P>
<P>
Once persuaded by viewing portions of videotaped interviews with their children 
and learning the results of their medical exams, parents have had to "hold 
onto" their belief, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're over the edge . . . you cannot now say, 'Maybe it didn't happen,' " he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After closing arguments by Deputy Dist. Atty. Lael Rubin next week, Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge William Pounders will give lengthy instructions to the 
jury. Deliberations could start as early as Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
Many observers said that the jury -- whose members often look bored -- appears 
to have already made up its mind and should reach a quick verdict: guilty if 
its members believe the children; not guilty if they believe the teachers. If, 
however, they sift through all the evidences, Pounders has said a verdict might 
take several months.

SLAYING SUSPECT SOUGHT DEAL IN CAMARENA CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man arrested last week for allegedly taking part in the 1985 murder of two 
American tourists in Mexico had been negotiating to supply information to 
investigators probing the murder of a federal drug agent that same year, it was 
disclosed in federal court in Los Angeles Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Special Agent Abel Reynoso of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 
testified that Javier Vasquez-Velasco "wanted to work out a deal" to trade his 
help in the investigation of the murder of DEA agent Enrique Camarena for 
leniency on state charges of running a counterfeit audio tape ring. 
</P>
<P>
Reynoso said Vasquez-Velasco, 38, his four brothers and a sister were arrested 
on the state charges in July. Reynoso said he talked to Vasquez-Velasco several 
times about the Camarena case and helped him gain a bail reduction on the state 
charges. But, he said, no deal was made and he obtained no useful information. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Gregory Nicolaysen, representing Vasquez-Velasco at the Friday hearing 
seeking his release on bail on the charge of participating in the murders of 
the tourists, argued that his client had cooperated fully in the Camarena 
investigation. He said Vasquez-Velasco "has given the government so much, but 
he has gotten nothing in return." However, John L. Carlton, assistant U.S. 
attorney, said Vasquez-Velasco "never did cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Magistrate Volney Brown Jr. concluded that there was a serious risk that 
Vasquez-Velasco might flee to Mexico. Although he had been living in South Gate 
with his wife and children, Vasquez-Velasco is a native of Mexico, has 
relatives there and possessed false identification when arrested, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez-Velasco was arrested last week after a federal grand jury returned an 
indictment in the murders of John Walker of Minneapolis and Alberto Radelat of 
Ft. Worth, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Reynoso testified at Friday's hearing that Walker, 38, and Radelat, 32, walked 
into a restaurant in Guadalajara on Jan. 30, 1985, while members of two drug 
cartels "were more or less having a party." 
</P>
<P>
Reynoso said the drug traffickers apparently believed that Walker, who was 
working on a book on the Mexican Mafia, and Radelat, a college student, "were 
somehow related to the Drug Enforcement Administration and they captured them, 
beat them up and eventually murdered them." He said Vasquez-Velasco was 
identified as one of 10 to 15 people who beat each man. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve people, including two drug ring leaders now in prison in Mexico, have 
been indicted in the slayings of Walker and Radelat and the murder a month 
later of Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala-Avelar. Vasquez-Velasco was 
accused only in the Walker and Radelat murders.

PASTOR TAKES DUAL ROLE AS SPIRITUAL LEADER, ACTIVIST; 
</P>
<P>
CHANGE: BALDWIN PARK PARISH REFLECTS EFFORTS TO KEEP CHURCH GROWING AND 
RELEVANT, IMPROVING LIVES AND COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Msgr. Peter D. Nugent, pastor of St. John the Baptist Roman Catholic Church in 
Baldwin Park, recently played the hero role in a melodramatic skit staged by a 
church-based community organization. 
</P>
<P>
The priest ripped the blindfolds off the Environmental Protection Agency's 
"watchdogs" so they could see and chase away the villains contaminating the 
ground water in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Nugent plays a similar role in real life as spiritual leader of one of the 
largest parishes in the sprawling three-county Roman Catholic Archdiocese of 
Los Angeles: He helps St. John's 7,000 families, the vast majority of whom are 
Latinos and Filipinos, see opportunities to improve their lives and community. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people here are ready to respond and develop and get into things . . 
. if you give them half a chance," Nugent said during an interview. "My prime 
goal is leadership development." 
</P>
<P>
During the eight years the slightly built, 53-year-old priest has been in 
charge at St. John the Baptist, nothing has influenced his focus more 
dramatically than Baldwin Park's shifting population. Once a semi-agricultural 
small town, it's now a rapidly growing semi-urban area with pockets of deep 
poverty and crime, gang and drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
Nugent's successful service to his burgeoning and variegated flock is an 
example that church analysts say other pastors in the 55-million-member U.S. 
Roman Catholic Church could copy if the faith is to continue its growth and 
relevance. 
</P>
<P>
Within the next 10 years, "immigration is going to turn the church upside 
down," predicted Father Gene Hemrick, research director for the National 
Conference of Catholic Bishops. 
</P>
<P>
While many parishes will tend to bog down in internal problems, "the way we 
respond to that bigger picture is the way we're going to go," Hemrick said, 
adding that present estimates of the U.S. Latino Catholic population are in the 
20-million range, and that by 1995, half of all U.S. Catholics will be Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin Park's population of 63,000 is about 77% Latino, 15% Filipino, 8% 
Anglo, and a smattering of other racial backgrounds. The average annual income 
for individuals is about $16,000. 
</P>
<P>
The ethnic diversity, generally low family incomes and attendant social 
problems confound traditional patterns of parish leadership as well as worship. 
</P>
<P>
"Incorporating the various ethnic groups into one parish is a challenging job," 
said St. John's music director, Tom Ratto. "We have a tremendous amount of 
turnover. It's a fast-moving place; it jumps." 
</P>
<P>
St. John the Baptist Parish is only one of many in Southern California, of 
course, to experience growth and a rapidly changing population in the past few 
years. For example, virtually every parish west and southwest of downtown Los 
Angeles is experiencing what archdiocese communications director Bill Rivera 
calls "the Hispanic wave." 
</P>
<P>
But St. John is a premier pioneer, according to Auxiliary Bishop Juan Arzube, 
who oversees parishes in the San Gabriel Valley. The "contemporary mentality" 
of its priests, its innovative programs and Nugent's ability to "get things 
done" in the community combine to make St. John an attractive role model, 
Arzube said. 
</P>
<P>
The pastoral staff is indeed cosmopolitan: Nugent, a French Canadian, learned 
to speak Spanish when he was a classmate of Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. 
Mahony at St. John's Seminary in Camarillo. Associate Pastor Nick Ricalde is 
Filipino, and associate Guillermo Rodriguez is Salvadoran. The swirling mix of 
languages and cultures is evident in everything at St. John from people to 
programs to paint. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the eight weekend Masses are said in Spanish; a fourth will be added 
soon. On a recent Sunday, the 11 a.m. Spanish Mass included music from a choir, 
organ, guitars and an accordion. At the 1 p.m. Mass, a choir sang in Filipino 
and in English. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Tapia, 27, who grew up in the parish and now teaches English as a 
Second Language at the church, remembers when the 800-seat sanctuary had lots 
of marble and crucifixes. During extensive remodeling in 1984, the interior was 
done over in gold and coral pink. 
</P>
<P>
"Many here have become acculturated," said Tapia, adding that St. John "really 
wants to serve all the needs of the people -- all the cultures and 
perspectives." 
</P>
<P>
Some changes have not been easy for the dwindling remnant of Anglos who 
originally formed the parish and built the church and its school. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Stein, who has been coming to St. John ever since the parish was 
established in 1946, feels a little left out. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the minority now," she sighed. "But when I go to church I go to pray to 
God, not to notice who's there. Things are going to have to change (more) and 
we're just going to go along with it." 
</P>
<P>
Nugent, who often wears a Mexican-style shirt called a guayabera, was 13 when 
his family moved to East Los Angeles from Canada. Ordained a priest in 1962, he 
holds a master's degree in music from USC, and he taught music at St. John's 
Seminary for 14 years. After serving for two years as associate pastor at St. 
Pius X Parish in Santa Fe Springs, he came to St. John the Baptist in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken, energetic Nugent belongs to a health club and likes music, 
reading, skiing, hiking and the beach. He draws the standard salary for 
monsignors: $450 a month plus a car, meals and lodging at the rectory adjoining 
the church. 
</P>
<P>
It's time, he said, for the parish to move into new strategies for the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been a service church -- baptisms, worship, weddings, education," he 
declared, noting that there had been 153 marriages, 412 baptisms and between 
200 and 300 confirmations during the past year. About 1,000 children and young 
adults are currently enrolled in the church's catechism (religious instruction) 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"But I see the kids as they are growing up and they don't have the allegiances 
we had," he continued. "They are very free. Some don't necessarily believe (in 
the faith). And that's not just the 'black sheep.' It's a way of growing up in 
modern America. Young adults, too. The church has to reach out." 
</P>
<P>
Nugent's efforts to reach out have included involving up to 500 people in 
six-week home Bible study and prayer meetings. And he plans more "friendly 
encounters" with neighbors: home rosaries and occasional home Masses. 
</P>
<P>
"Our parish is the neighborhood; whoever is here is us," he said, spreading his 
hands in an open gesture. "That's in our tradition." 
</P>
<P>
A growing tradition at St. John is a major youth emphasis, sparked by full-time 
youth minister Lucy Boutte. She specializes in training high school young 
people to lead their own weekend retreats. 
</P>
<P>
"These are often turning points. They encounter themselves, their parents, 
pain, each other, God and Jesus," said Boutte, a former insurance underwriter. 
</P>
<P>
Estrangement between teens and their parents is the most frequent obstacle, so 
parents join in on the final night of the retreat, bringing "love letters" they 
have just written to their children. The young people respond by writing their 
parents. A family "reconciliation service" concludes the evening as the parents 
lay hands on their children in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't address the conflicts within families, they get passed on for 
generations and we get more broken relationships," Boutte explained. 
</P>
<P>
St. John tries to reach children early: Its school serves some 500 pupils from 
first through eighth grades. Students score an average of 2 1/2 to three years 
above the national achievement norms, according to Sister Assumpta Martinez, a 
teacher and principal at St. John's for 16 years. About 95% go on to Catholic 
high schools and half to college, she said proudly. 
</P>
<P>
The monthly tuition at St. John's School is probably the lowest of any private 
school in the San Gabriel Valley: $92 per student for working parents, and $75 
for non-working parents, who are expected to help with school supervision. 
Proceeds from weekly parish bingo games help keep fees down, Nugent said. 
</P>
<P>
Although most children speak Spanish, only English is used at the school, in 
line with Sister Assumpta's conviction that bilingual classes hinder education 
in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
Adding that the school has no problems with drugs, alcohol or tobacco, Sister 
Assumpta credits good discipline: "We cherish freedom . . . based on 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
But Sister Joan Keltus, who supervises Christian social service programs at St. 
John, sees another side of the parish and community. 
</P>
<P>
There is counseling for troubled marriages, assistance for battered women, 
groceries for 1,000 families given each month through an ecumenical food 
center, and guidance for immigrants navigating a maze of red tape and paper 
work in order to obtain food stamps, medical benefits and employment. And 
before the registration deadline, Sister Joan helped 5,000 area families sign 
up for the immigration amnesty program. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of poverty and unemployment in this area," says the nun, a 
member of the Sisters of Social Service. She sees irony in the fact that she's 
pledged to poverty but her monthly stipend of $500 plus a car and apartment 
total more than what many in the parish make -- half earn only the minimum wage 
of $4.25 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"Rents here are outrageous," huffed Sister Joan, pointing to an ill-kept 
housing development down the block where two or more families often share 
two-bedroom units at $560 a month. 
</P>
<P>
She calls her ministry no more than "Band-Aiding -- meeting immediate needs." 
And, she says, with the government cutting back on social services and 
counseling, "the church has to do more and more of this." 
</P>
<P>
Nugent and his staff are working, however, to give the people a stronger voice 
in their own destinies. For example, St. John member Margarita Vargas, a leader 
in the powerful church-based East Valleys Organization, targeted 4,748

them empowerment and self-esteem. It does a very good job of reaching the

NO-CONTEST PLEAS ENTERED IN RACIAL INCIDENT AT SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Three former football players from St. Genevieve High School in Panorama City 
pleaded no contest Friday to charges of painting racial slurs on the office 
door of a black coach and causing $10,000 in other damage at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Renteria, Paul Zamora and Carlos Gonzalez each pleaded no contest to one 
count of felony vandalism and one count of misdemeanor terrorism. They entered 
the pleas as a preliminary hearing was about to begin in Van Nuys Municipal 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for their pleas, prosecutors promised to seek no more than one-year 
prison sentences against the three 18-year-olds who graduated from the school 
this year, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Dver. 
</P>
<P>
Dver told the three that Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Michael J. Farrell, who 
will sentence them, has agreed to terms of three years probation, $3,500 
restitution and 90 days working on a Caltrans highway crew. 
</P>
<P>
The charges carry a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a $5,000 
fine. However, prosecutors agreed to lesser terms because the three had good 
backgrounds, expressed remorse and entered pleas before their preliminary 
hearing, saving the time and expense of a trial, Dver said. 
</P>
<P>
Two other students, both juveniles, are facing proceedings in Juvenile Court, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The five students surrendered to police June 14 in connection with the June 12 
incident in which racial slurs were painted on the door of Jimmy Chambers, an 
assistant football coach. Authorities also found smashed drinking fountains, 
broken glass and other damage. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Municipal Judge Aviva K. Bobb scheduled sentencing Dec. 1.

2 TONS OF MARIJUANA, $1.5 MILLION IN CASH SEIZED; 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THAT WITH THE RAID IN PALMDALE, THEY BROKE THE BACK 
OF A NEW DRUG RING THAT HAD IMPORTED ITS FIRST LOAD OF PHILIPPINE- GROWN 
MARIJUANA.

Federal drug agents and local authorities have seized two tons of 
Philippine-grown marijuana and $1.5 million in cash, halting the test run for a 
major Manila-to-Los Angeles drug smuggling operation that had been under way 
for less than a month, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The marijuana, seized Thursday at a warehouse in Palmdale, was purchased in 
Manila for about $40,000 and could have been sold on U. S. streets for an 
estimated $14 million, said Ralph B. Lochridge, spokesman for the federal Drug 
Enforcement Administration in Los Angeles. The cash, apparently obtained from 
marijuana sales earlier in the week, was seized in a room at the Dufy Hotel in 
West Hollywood, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested Thursday at the warehouse were three men who were arraigned Friday in 
federal District Court on charges of possession of marijuana with intent to 
distribute, Lochridge said. They were ordered held without bail until a hearing 
Tuesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a significant bust," Lochridge said. "It appeared to be a well-oiled, 
well-run, sophisticated operation." 
</P>
<P>
The marijuana was carefully sealed in heavy-duty plastic bags wrapped in 
aluminum foil in an effort to throw off drug-sniffing dogs, Lochridge said. It 
was packed in 23 crates hidden among 164 pieces of rattan furniture that one of 
the suspects intended to sell through a legitimate business, Beverly 
Hills-based Budji Corp., Lochridge said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what we believe to be a first attempt," he said. "It was a two-ton 
sample to test out the market." 
</P>
<P>
The DEA began investigating the operation after learning that a ship loaded 
with the marijuana was scheduled to leave Manila for Los Angeles on Oct. 6, 
Lochridge said. When the ship arrived at Long Beach Harbor on Oct. 16, DEA 
agents and investigators from the Los Angeles and Orange County sheriff's 
departments, the Compton Police Department and the U. S. Customs Service 
tracked the suspects until they were arrested about 3:30 p.m. Thursday, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The men allegedly used a rented truck to take the marijuana from a storage area 
in South Gate to Palmdale, he said. They apparently planned to set up a network 
of warehouses from which they would distribute the drug to middlemen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested were Jay William Rosser, 34, of Mission Hills; Virgilio Cancio Layug, 
38, a Manila-born Los Angeles man who told authorities that he is a U. S. 
citizen, and John Laperal Nassr, 39, a Philippine citizen living in Manila, 
Lochridge said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were looking for a fourth suspect, Ptol Estrada, whose age and 
citizenship had not been determined, officials said. He is believed to be 
hiding in the United States, Lochridge said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN BURGLED MOTHER'S HOUSE, JURY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 27-year-old Lancaster man with a history of drug use was convicted Friday of 
residential burglary for breaking into his mother's house and stealing 
valuables while she was on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
John Kuykendall faces a maximum sentence of 16 years in state prison because he 
has three prior felony convictions, including a burglary, a robbery and grand 
theft, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert B. Foltz Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Foltz said Kuykendall turned to crime to support his drug habit. 
</P>
<P>
During the four-day jury trial in San Fernando Superior Court, Kuykendall's 
mother, Joyce Zimmerman, testified that when she returned from a weekend trip 
to visit her daughter, she found her house ransacked. Such valuables as two 
entertainment centers, a Cabbage Patch doll collection, clocks, radios, 
silverware, jewelry and money were gone. 
</P>
<P>
In the house, she found a pair of thongs belonging to her son and an old pair 
of his shoes were gone, Foltz said. 
</P>
<P>
Two young boys who live across the street from Zimmerman testified that they 
watched Kuykendall take items out of the house and put them in the back of a 
truck, Foltz said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the stolen items have been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Kuykendall, who had been released from state prison only a month before the 
burglary, did not present a defense. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing is scheduled Nov. 15.

'GAY-BASHING' AS AN ART FORM; 
</P>
<P>
ART: THE MAPPLETHORPE AFFAIR REVEALS A LINKAGE OF QUIRKY CONSERVATIVE IMPULSES 
IN ART, ECONOMICS AND POLITICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN SEKULA, Allan Sekula is a photographer and critic and the director of 
the photography program at the California Institute of the Arts. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conservatives have cooked up a grimly Malthusian policy for the arts, motivated 
partly by free-market economic dogma, partly by an ideological (and 
public-relations) need to indulge in conspicuous displays of moral outrage. 
Press accounts have concentrated on the fulminations of Jesse Helms, giving 
scant attention to the real strategists of this cultural battle, the brave 
lieutenants of the intellectual right. 
</P>
<P>
I'm thinking here of Hilton Kramer, former art critic for the New York Times 
and currently editor of the New Criterion, and Samuel Lipman, publisher of that 
journal of conservative cultural opinion. The cultural traditionalism they've 
been refining over the years is now having its day in the limelight, in the 
controversy over "obscene" art underwritten by tax dollars through the National 
Endowment for the Arts. The flash point was a scheduled exhibition, partly 
funded by the NEA, of the late Robert Mapplethorpe's work, photographs commonly 
described as "homoerotic" in content. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer and Lipman have been seeking to restrict the funding of the arts 
endowment since the very beginning of the Reagan presidency. Ideologically, 
they are committed to a vision of late-modernist culture derived from the 
earlier modernism of T. S. Eliot. They seek to erect a stable, authoritative 
canon of great works of the past, and to defend practitioners of contemporary 
art who have an intelligent and polite dialogue with that canon. Artists with 
an impolite, aggressive or debunking attitude to the art of the past don't rank 
very high with Lipman and Kramer; for example, they don't like the Dadaists. 
</P>
<P>
Lipman in particular would like to see the NEA become a ministry of dead art, 
funding only the historical endeavors of museums. This makes sense in 
conservative terms, since recent tax-law changes have removed incentives for 
private collectors to donate art to museums, and escalating art prices have 
made it difficult for museums to compete with these same private collectors. A 
real institutional crisis is brewing, precisely because of the speculative 
hypertrophy of the free market. You might say that Lipman favors a modest 
museum bail-out program based on shifting money from living art to dead art. 
</P>
<P>
These people make a lot of noise about allowing contemporary art to succeed or 
fail in the marketplace. Kramer has no problem, he claims, with a private 
culture of homosexual eroticism. What bothers Kramer is the implied moral 
imprimatur of government funding for public art exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
Liberals are suffering from a failure of nerve in this regard, allowing the 
right wing to hold the moral and the economic high ground. We should be 
aggressive in exposing both the homophobia and the economic inconsistencies of 
the conservative argument. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer is happy as long as homosexual culture remains in the closet, and he's 
even willing to accept a small homosexual aristocracy of taste within the art 
world. How generous. 
</P>
<P>
What terrifies conservatives like him and Lipman is a truly popular, open 
homosexual culture, a culture capable of forging alliances and bonds with 
dissident and mainstream groups in this society. They worry about the sort of 
politicized gay and lesbian culture that has emerged since the Stonewall 
Rebellion of 1969 and is gathering strength now in response to the AIDS crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Mapplethorpe and gays in general are being stigmatized for taking 
seriously one of the utopian promises of the capitalist consumer economy: the 
promise of liberated desire. According to conservatives, gays and lesbians are 
suspect because they don't reproduce "normal" family life. They supposedly 
don't have children, and they often work in "frivolous" fields on the fringe of 
the GNP. In other words, conservatives project their own fears of both 
unfettered desire and an impotent economy onto gay and lesbian people, who are 
easily scapegoated in a society obsessed with productivity. 
</P>
<P>
Liberals in government are stigmatized for their willingness to support a 
"hedonistic" and "bohemian" culture. Lipman chastises the very modestly funded 
NEA for its "profligacy." Another conservative intellectual, Gertrude 
Himmelfarb, recently suggested a connection between the (supposed) spendthrift 
shortsightedness of Keynesian economics and John Maynard Keynes' personal life 
as a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
These are strange accusations that beg for both economic and psychological 
analysis. Sigmund Freud understood the phenomenon of the "reaction formation," 
the attempt to control a repressed wish. The parsimonious effort to control the 
orifices of government spending may well be a cover for the spendthrift 
impulses of conservatives themselves. Maybe conservatives are all closet 
Keynesians, secret believers in government deficit spending, notably of the 
military variety. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel Lipman's New Criterion is handsomely funded by the ultraconservative 
John M. Olin Foundation. Olin money comes not from some abstract patronage pool 
in the sky, but from the Olin Corp., a major chemical and munitions 
manufacturer. And where would Jesse Helms be without his two causes -- tobacco 
subsidies and military aid to brutal Central American rightists? As threats to 
public health, Robert Mapplethorpe's deadpan late-1970s pictures of unwittingly 
unsafe sex between consenting adult men hardly compare. 
</P>
<P>
It has been too easy for the "art world' -- a label that suggests both 
cosmopolitanism and parochialism -- to see itself as a unified body under 
attack by philistines. The art world is perfectly capable of dividing against 
itself under pressure from without. Some arts administrators have stated their 
willingness to "live with" a congressional funding compromise that stigmatizes 
"homoerotic" expression. This will create a zone of moral quarantine. Why 
should gay and lesbian artists have to live and work under this shadow? Why 
should any artist who wishes to speak about the complicated vicissitudes of 
sexuality have to endure the special scrutiny of the government? And why should 
any other artist accept this stigmatization of his or her colleagues? 
</P>
<P>
A large and distinguished assemblage of artists is boycotting the Corcoran 
Gallery of Art, the Washington institution that volunteered to serve as the 
laboratory for conservative cultural policy by canceling a scheduled 
Mapplethorpe exhibition. The boycott is an appropriate and justified response, 
a kind of strike. The issue now is to develop common ground with other groups 
seeking to defend civil rights and liberties in an increasingly authoritarian 
society.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 4 ROB TARZANA STORE OF $300,000 IN JEWELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four men stole an estimated $300,000 worth of jewels Friday in an armed robbery 
of a jewelry store on Ventura Boulevard in Tarzana, Los Angeles police 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers, two of them carrying handguns, burst into the Selected Merchandise 
store about 10:30 a.m., Detective Bud Mehringer said. They smashed a display 
case, grabbed the jewels and fled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The four were seen leaving in a black Cherokee Jeep, which was found abandoned 
several blocks from the store, Mehringer said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known how many employees or customers were in the store, he said. No 
shots were fired, and no one was hurt, he said.

PRAVDA OR CONSEQUENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Why," asked Vladimir Lenin, "should freedom of speech and freedom of press be 
allowed? Why should a government which is doing what it believes to be right 
allow itself to be criticized? Ideas are more fatal things than guns. Why 
should any man be allowed to buy a printing press and disseminate pernicious 
opinions calculated to embarrass the government?" 
</P>
<P>
Why indeed? By the time Soviet Union's first leader posed these questions in 
1920, the Communist Party was well on its way to suppressing all political 
opposition, and those who held power intuitively understood the necessity for 
proscribing press freedom. Control what people are permitted to know and you 
control a lot of what they might think. 
</P>
<P>
Only recently, as Mikhail S. Gorbachev tries in fits and starts to steer the 
Soviet Union toward the 21st Century, is the idea starting to break down that 
state interests demand a rigidly controlled press. There are some in the Soviet 
hierarchy who think this change is coming too fast. Gorbachev himself sometimes 
sounds like one of them. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Gorbachev castigated the country's leading journalists for being 
too free in their reporting and in their commentary, even calling on Vladislav 
A. Starkov, editor of the Soviet Union's top-selling newspaper Argumenty I 
Facty, to resign. Starkov, strongly supported by the staff of the 26-million 
circulation weekly, has so far refused. Defiance or no, Gorbachev's criticisms 
nonetheless have been seen as sending a chill through proponents of a freer 
press. 
</P>
<P>
One editor who presumably felt no need to button up his ideological overcoat 
was Viktor G. Afanasyev, the conservative and comfortably entrenched editor of 
Pravda, the party's official paper. Entrenched, that is, until two days ago, 
when he was suddenly relieved of his job and replaced by a close Gorbachev 
crony. Berate the radicals, but move against the conservatives: If nothing 
else, Gorbachev knows how to keep people guessing. 
</P>
<P>
There's good reason to think that Gorbachev in fact is genuinely upset over 
some of the criticism that has appeared in the more liberated press; his 
complaints, in this view, were not just a smoke screen for getting control of 
Pravda. There's also good reason to think that Gorbachev's timing had 
everything to do with next week's scheduled debate in the Supreme Soviet on a 
new law covering press freedom. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union isn't likely to soon see its own version of the First 
Amendment, though it could see an effort to explicitly guarantee a freer -- 
which is not the same thing as a free -- press. That would be an important 
advance, but one not without some risks. Right now, liberals in the press may 
constantly test the boundaries of what is allowable. Codifying those boundaries 
could provide certain legal protections, but the act of definition also imposes 
limits. The scheduled debate promises to be an interesting test of political 
strength in the Supreme Soviet, and no doubt a test of political prudence as 
well.

FALLOUT FROM TEACHERS' STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I feel it is worthwhile -- and necessary -- to clarify for the public at least 
a few examples of incorrect information which appeared recently in two articles 
on the editorial pages ("Sour Fallout From L.A. Teachers' Bonanza," Sept. 15, 
written by Supt. Ted Kimbrough and attorney Melanie Lomax from the Compton 
Unified School District, and a subsequent letter on the same subject, Sept. 30, 
written by United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson). 
</P>
<P>
First, the Kimbrough/Lomax article suggested that teachers have "traditionally" 
received limited salary increases which equal the state COLA (cost of living) 
percentage, with the inference, perhaps, that teachers should continue to be 
satisfied with that during a time of tight finances. Though it cost the Los 
Angeles Unified School District nearly $50 million in very distressing budget 
reductions for the current year alone to afford the raise we offered to our 
teachers and other employees, we are pleased that the recent contract agreement 
makes them among the highest paid in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, for a number of years the "tradition" in Los Angeles has been to offer 
higher-than-COLA increases. For the four years prior to the start of the 
current three-year contract, the state COLA was 20%. In that same period, our 
teachers and other employees averaged 30%. For the past six years including the 
present year, the COLA totals 29%, while our district's increases have totaled 
46%. Regretfully, it was inevitable that a certain number of teachers in other 
local districts would opt for the higher salaries -- and a greater sense of 
their own worth to the community -- offered in the Los Angeles district. It 
would have been surprising had that not been one of the fallout effects. 
</P>
<P>
We want to assure Compton Unified and other local districts that we will 
continue to be very supportive of any efforts to seek supplemental salary funds 
from the state to help raise the professional status of their teachers and all 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Second, despite our new contract with UTLA, which we had hoped would signify a 
lessening of the union's gratuitous public diatribes of the past year, it is 
very frustrating for us to have to rebut union President Wayne Johnson's 
continuing, unabashed misstatements to his union members, parents and the 
general public about the district's budget, vehicle fleet and administrative 
costs. He apparently believes that merely prefacing an incorrect statement with 
"The fact is . . ." will guide the public to his side of an issue, but we feel 
an obligation to correct and clarify those misstatements with real facts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Budget reductions were needed (close to $50 million this year), and were 
made by the Board of Education during three months of public hearings. 
Furthermore, it is a virtual certainty that more cuts will be needed for next 
year's budget, unless the state COLA grows to more than 8% from this year's 
4.64%. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Over 40 district officials have turned in their district cars at the 
direction of the Board of Education; they now drive their own cars for district 
business to and from work. Others who still retain the use of a district 
vehicle for district business -- by board approval -- will get "new cars" only 
when it no longer becomes cost effective to maintain their present used cars. 
Officials car-pool to required meetings whenever possible, either in their own 
cars, in assigned cars or in fleet pool vehicles. I would appreciate it if 
Johnson could provide a list of the 50 administrators he claims "are provided 
chauffeurs' services, some full time." In truth, a small number of district 
personnel use -- on an infrequent basis -- the services of a district driver. 
Even the superintendent gave up the full-time services of a driver/bodyguard 
and now uses a rotating group of school district police on an as-needed basis. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The administrative staff that Johnson calls "outrageous, bloated and 
overpaid" is the same central office and region office administrative staff 
that comprises only 4.4% of the district's overall budget, one of the lowest 
percentages for administrative costs of any school district in Los Angeles 
County or anywhere in California. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than having to spend time answering allegations and fallacious 
statements, it would be better for all if we could spend our limited time 
resolving the actual and critical problems and issues facing all of us.

DRIVE-BY SHOOTING SUIT DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state appeal court has thrown out a lawsuit filed against the owner of a 
Linda Vista skating rink by a youth left paralyzed in 1984 after a drive-by 
shooting outside the building. 
</P>
<P>
The 4th District Court of Appeal in San Diego dismissed the suit by Tuan Hoang 
Thai, saying rink owner Gray Stang had no duty to protect Thai from an 
unforeseeable shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Thai was standing outside the entrance of Skateworld Roller Rink on Oct. 6, 
1984, when the occupants of a passing car sprayed the building with fire from 
an automatic rifle. Thai, who was 15 at the time, was not the intended victim, 
but he was struck in the spinal cord and paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
An 18-year-old, Ly Gong Vo, whom prosecutors believed to be the driver of the 
car when the passengers -- all juveniles -- opened fire, pleaded guilty in 
April, 1985, to assault with a deadly weapon and was sentenced to a year in 
County Jail. The juveniles served time with the California Youth Authority 
after being convicted of assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai sued Stang, alleging he had maintained his business negligently 
and claiming Stang knew of numerous incidents of violence in the parking lot 
and failed to provide adequate security for customers. Stang denied those 
allegations and said there had never been a shooting on the premises while he 
ran the rink. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Vincent Di Figlia dismissed Thai's suit Oct. 14, 
1987. Thai appealed, but, in a decision issued Wednesday, the 4th District 
Court affirmed Di Figlia's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the random nature of drive-by shootings, which makes them difficult to 
police against, we do not discern how Stang could have prevented Thai's 
injuries," Judge William L. Todd Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
Judges Daniel Kremer and Charles Froehlich joined in the opinion.

MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE JOLTS BAY AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the aftermath of the devastating Bay Area earthquake a miracle is born. The 
public and, of all people, Gov. George Deukmejian and President George Bush 
have discovered the homeless and are rushing to distribute food, clothes and 
money. However, providing aid depends on where the "fault" lies so this 
excludes those made shelterless before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
Both Georges and most Americans have ignored the plight of the thousands of 
people made homeless in the Bay Area and elsewhere long before the temblor. 
"It's their own fault," some say. Yet those without shelter now are to be 
viewed more compassionately because their condition was due to a different 
fault, the San Andreas. 
</P>
<P>
This observation should not be construed as being insensitive. Yet, doesn't a 
transient family on Market Street deserve the same compassion and consideration 
as one made homeless in the Marina district? Both situations were brought about 
by circumstances beyond their control. The former due to an unnatural disaster: 
the action (or inaction) of the Reagan/Bush administrations and HUD. The latter 
due to a natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Having worked as a teacher for the homeless in Los Angeles this year I don't 
see a difference when people are shelterless. Either way, the victims are 
powerless and dependent, regardless of whose fault it is.

MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE JOLTS BAY AREA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Even before the shaking stopped ham radio operators were establishing 
communication links with the San Francisco area. Hundreds of volunteers, many 
staying up all night, pinpointed and communicated information about need for 
emergency services, damage reports, and handled health and welfare inquiries to 
and from the area. 
</P>
<P>
The major ham radio FM communication link between Northern and Southern 
California is the Condor system of several linked repeaters (relay stations). 
This system, built entirely by hams at their own expense, is very reliable 
because it is not hampered by changes in atmospheric conditions. It handled 
continuous high-quality emergency communications throughout the nights and days 
following the San Francisco earthquake. It did the same after the Whittier 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
Condor uses the lower end of the 220-megahertz ham band to connect its 
repeaters. Under very suspicious and unusual circumstances the Federal 
Communications Commission recently ruled that the use of this spectrum of 
frequency will be taken away from the hams and made available to commercial 
business interests. The loss will be a major one to the brilliant and dedicated 
hobbyist who built the system but it will be an even greater loss to the 
citizens of California when the next disaster strikes.

I find the quick response of the Bush Administration to the San Francisco area 
earthquake interesting compared to the Administration virtually ignoring the 
Alaska oil spill, and its sluggish and inadequate response to Hurricane Hugo's 
devastation. 
</P>
<P>
How many electoral college votes does California have in comparison with both 
Alaska and South Carolina? Surely federal disaster response is humanitarian -- 
or is it another calculated political move?

MAN ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL IN RELATIVES' SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old man was ordered Friday to stand trial in the killings of his 
grandmother and mother, allegedly committed during a dispute over high 
credit-card charges. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Newsome of San Diego is charged with strangling his grandmother Mamie 
Newsome, 67, in her home Sept. 5 after being confronted about his use of her 
credit card, on which he charged a television set and a videocassette recorder. 
</P>
<P>
That same day, his mother, Marsha Newsome, 49, was stabbed to death in the same 
home on Sychar Road. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge Nicholas Kasimatis ordered an arraignment and 
trial-setting appearance in Superior Court for Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
A key witness in the case, Steven Johnson, 18, testified several weeks ago that 
he heard a woman screaming the day the women were killed. He was standing 
outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said Newsome let him inside but that he became frightened and left to 
call police. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Pettine said Friday that his office was still weighing 
the possibility of charging Newsome with special-circumstances allegations, 
which could bring the death penalty if he were convicted of multiple murders. 
</P>
<P>
Newsome, who remains in County Jail in lieu of $2-million bail, had worked as a 
security guard. He surrendered to police 15 hours after the slayings.

Friends, I just got through reading today's (Oct. 11) Times, which I have 
subscribed to for about 25 years. I was thoroughly disappointed with your new 
concept of publication. 
</P>
<P>
Why a really great newspaper like The Times would want to mimic a publication 
like USA Today is beyond my sense of belief. 
</P>
<P>
Your second page Top of Today's News will only discourage many people from 
reading your paper in depth. I will never buy another USA Today and if The 
Times continues to fall to that level I will certainly discontinue my 
subscription to The Times.

In between emergency responses from our fire station, I watched the heroic 
efforts of our brother and sister firefighters in San Francisco as they 
attempted to suppress the fires and rescue people trapped in structures. The 
mayor had put out a call for all off-duty fire fighting personnel to 
immediately report to their fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
While watching the coverage, my mind kept drifting back to an obscure article I 
had read earlier in the day. This article described how San Francisco Mayor Art 
Agnos had reduced the San Francisco Fire Department staffing by 76 positions 
four months earlier. I kept waiting for someone to ask Agnos about these 
reductions, but no questions were forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that the remaining personnel of the San Francisco Fire 
Department would give their all during this major disaster, but when the dust 
is settled, I am sure they will ask Agnos if he still feels the same way about 
his cuts in the fire department -- and I can't wait to hear his answer!

any useful purpose would be served by calling on Mayor Art Agnos!

Congratulations on the new format. The little boxed background are especially 
helpful in recalling material once digested but since misplaced. This comes 
close to fulfilling an old dream of mine -- a newspaper so presented that the 
reader can see the relationship among stories printed from all parts of the 
world, including home. And while I usually "study" my morning newspaper, those 
days do come along when one has to glance and run. 
</P>
<P>
One problem (isn't there always?) the bright orange flier announcing the "Good 
News" was slicker than a banana peel. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks for all the good thought that went into these changes.

Having been a subscriber for almost 20 years, I'm more impressed than ever

DRUG BARRICADE TACTIC RESEMBLES EFFORT IN N.Y. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LIEBERMAN and JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The problem drugs were heroin and powder cocaine in January, 1984, when the New 
York Police Department tried a new tactic in an area of Manhattan's Lower East 
Side that was considered the city's worst narcotics "supermarket." 
</P>
<P>
In what was dubbed "Operation Pressure Point," a four-block by eight-block area 
was saturated with more than 200 officers, some working undercover but most 
still in uniform -- enough to station an officer at virtually every corner. 
"They made car stops, strictly enforced traffic laws and conducted 'stop and 
frisks' where appropriate," Sgt. Peter Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
And they stayed for eight months. 
</P>
<P>
The New York crackdown is the closest thing to a precedent for a law 
enforcement campaign begun Thursday in Los Angeles, the "Neighborhood Rescue 
Operation" in which police took the extra step of erecting barricades at 
entrances to a square-mile area near MacArthur Park. Police Chief Daryl F. 
Gates said 60 officers would patrol the area indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back at Operation Pressure Point, New York police view it as a 
long-term success on the Lower East Side, but of far lesser value in other 
neighborhoods where it was later tried. The key factor in long-term success, 
they said, went beyond police work -- it was the ability of a community to 
transform itself. 
</P>
<P>
In the Lower East Side, Inspector Alfred James recalled, "the area was ripe for 
gentrification. There was a lot of money to rebuild." 
</P>
<P>
A year after the police influx began, business rents had doubled, artists had 
discovered the area and real estate brokers were interested in once worthless 
properties -- a dilapidated 16-story building formerly used as a "shooting 
gallery" by addicts sold for $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
But police hardly pretended that they had eliminated drug dealing. Although 
there were more than 2,000 arrests the first month of Operation Pressure Point, 
many dealers had simply moved elsewhere, gone indoors or developed new tactics 
to avoid detection. Police did claim more success, through arrests and car 
seizures, in deterring suburbanites from driving to the area to buy drugs -- a 
problem Los Angeles officials say is severe near MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
"People would drive in from Queens, (New) Jersey," James said. "We gave out a 
message to those people." 
</P>
<P>
But the conditions were different, he said, in an area of Harlem where 
Operation Pressure Point II was conducted from March, 1984, through April 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"We made 12,000 arrests up there, but we didn't have the same impact," James 
said, explaining that the drug buyers tended to be local and could walk two 
blocks outside the police zone to find their drugs. In addition, there was no 
gentrification to displace the "bad elements" once the massive police presence 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the strategy of flooding an area with uniformed officers ended 
when the nature of the drug problem changed in 1986 with the arrival of 
low-priced "crack" cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Police decided to put their drug-fighting resources instead into "T.N.T.," 
Tactical Narcotics Teams, which are essentially undercover operations to make 
buys from, and arrest, pushers in selected violence-plagued neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Allatore said officials here are under no 
illusion that police saturation can do much more than give a hard-hit community 
temporary relief. 
</P>
<P>
"It will work for as long as they're out there," Allatore said, predicting that 
young drug "entrepreneurs" will "go underground or move their business 
elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Allatore also noted that the use of barricades is not new for Los Angeles 
police. Two years ago, he sponsored an ordinance that allowed police to 
barricade streets to cut down on a somewhat less serious problem -- the heavy 
"cruising" of cars through certain neighborhoods.

CHARGERS: DAN HENNING AND BILL PARCELLS WILL BE ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE FIELD 
SUNDAY, BUT FRIENDS WILL ALWAYS BE FRIENDS.

<P>
Dan Henning looks at it this way: "You never like to coach against a good 
friend." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Parcells agrees, saying, "It's not all that much fun, but it's something 
you have to do." 
</P>
<P>
These words demonstrate how uncomfortable the opposing coaches are about 
sending their teams against each other in Sunday's game between the Chargers 
and New York Giants at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It's a lot easier for coaches such as Mike Ditka and Buddy Ryan, whose mutual 
disrespect is probably tops in the National Football League. When Ditka's 
Chicago Bears meet Ryan's Philadelphia Eagles, venom drips from every pore of 
both coaches. 
</P>
<P>
For Henning and Parcells, the best part of the weekend will be ignoring the 
business at hand long enough to get together tonight. As close friends of 19 
years, they will have plenty to talk about without touching upon the X's and 
O's that dominate their lives from July to December. 
</P>
<P>
Back in 1970, Henning coached the quarterbacks and receivers and Parcells 
coached the linebackers on Bill Peterson's staff at Florida State University. 
They weren't together long, but they established a friendship that has grown 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Even this week, when each was trying to devise means of outwitting the other, 
the two old buddies conversed twice by telephone before the Giants flew into 
town. 
</P>
<P>
There were the plans for tonight, of course, and, as Parcell pointed out in a 
conference call from New York, at least one other pressing matter. 
</P>
<P>
Said Parcells: "I was trying to find out what kind of tile Sandy (Henning's 
wife) picked for their house in San Diego (La Mesa). Dan said she had picked 
taupe and white, and I said I was more into mauve." 
</P>
<P>
Told of this, Henning smiled and said, "Our families are very close. We've 
taken vacations together and gone to the shore together. We lived around the 
corner from each other in Florida, and that's when our families established a 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"I have great respect for Bill as a coach and a friend. Even though I've 
coached mainly on offense and he's been on defense, we think alike." 
</P>
<P>
Henning is 47, Parcells 48; both grew up in the New York area. Henning is from 
the Bronx and Parcells from Englewood, N.J. Henning has a degree from William 
and Mary, Parcells from Wichita State. 
</P>
<P>
"We had very similar upbringings from a family standpoint," Parcells said. "We 
were raised quite a bit the same way, and maybe that's why we've always hit it 
off real well." 
</P>
<P>
Both Henning and Parcells became head coaches in the NFL in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Henning got his big break -- if it can be called that -- with the Atlanta 
Falcons. He lasted four seasons with a club that was woefully lacking in 
talent. His record was 22-41-1, including 7-8-1 in his last year. 
</P>
<P>
Parcells, who had been the Giants' defensive coordinator, took over a 
downtrodden team and produced a Super Bowl champion the year Henning drew his 
release from the Falcons. Despite the disparity in their records, Parcells 
feels that Henning got a bad deal in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the business," Parcells said. "We know that. It was a tough thing that 
happened to Dan, and he didn't deserve it. Another friend of mine, John 
Mackovic (now coach at the University of Illinois), took Kansas City to the 
playoffs and got fired. That's the business. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been very fortunate in New York. We have a good, stable situation, and it 
wasn't always that way here. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it's the same with all of us. If you win, you get to stay. If you 
don't, you don't stay. You've just got to win as soon as possible, and once you 
do that, your personnel department gets on the same page with you. Then you 
have a chance to keep on winning." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's game will mark only the third meeting of Henning and Parcells as head 
coaches. The two games in which Henning's Falcons played Parcells' Giants were 
both won by the Giants, 16-13 in overtime in 1983 and 19-7 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, the two opposed each other when both were assistants, Henning with 
the Miami Dolphins and Parcells with the New England Patriots in 1980 and 
Henning with the Washington Redskins and Parcells with the Giants in 1981 and 
1982. Each time, it was Henning's passing game against Parcells' defense. 
</P>
<P>
After his stint in Atlanta, Henning returned to the Redskins and handled their 
quarterbacks and receivers again in 1987 and 1988 before getting the Charger 
job. 
</P>
<P>
"Dan's passing offense always gave us trouble," Parcells said. "He's an 
outstanding coach, and you see evidence of that in what he's trying to do with 
his team in San Diego. I think they'll play well." 
</P>
<P>
Henning recalled the time the Redskins met the Giants during the player strike 
in 1987. The Giants had started out 0-3 after their Super Bowl victory, 
including one replacement game, and the Redskins dealt them a 38-12 drubbing. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the toughest I've seen it from Bill's standpoint," Henning said. 
"They weren't as well organized as we were during the strike. 
</P>
<P>
"But he's a great coach and an excellent administrator. He makes a formidable 
appearance and he's tough to beat year in and year out." 
</P>
<P>
Both Henning and Parcells look back fondly upon their experience under Peterson 
at Florida State. Henning in particular regards Peterson as his mentor, since 
Peterson gave him both his first college job and his first pro job. 
</P>
<P>
After a pro career that consisted of one game on the bench as a quarterback 
with the Chargers in 1966 and one season (1967) as an assistant high school 
coach in Newport News, Va., Henning was hired by Peterson in 1968. He stayed 
through 1970, and two years later worked under Peterson again with the Houston 
Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete created something at FSU that was good for all of us who were coaches at 
the time," Henning said. "Bill had been at West Point, and I went there with 
the recommendation of Sid Gillman (the Chargers' first head coach and a Hall of 
Famer). 
</P>
<P>
"We on the staff were all in our 20s, and Pete created an atmosphere of 
competitive learning. We appreciated getting a chance to coach and being given 
responsibility. Many guys went on from FSU to become head coaches. It was a 
great time in our lives." 
</P>
<P>
Other proteges of Peterson who are head coaches today include Joe Gibbs of the 
Redskins, Don James of the University of Washington and Bobby Bowden of Florida 
State. 
</P>
<P>
Now 69, Peterson has retired from coaching but still works part-time for 
Florida State as a development officer in the economic education department. 
</P>
<P>
Of Henning and Parcells, Peterson said, "Both of them were already outstanding 
coaches when they were here. I didn't really have coordinators, but you could 
say they took the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Parcells was a sharp guy. He was really tough on the players, but he got along 
with them well. They respected him. Henning had been a pro quarterback and had 
a great knowledge of the passing game. He called most of the plays for us. The 
kids believed in him." 
</P>
<P>
And Henning's future with the Chargers? 
</P>
<P>
"He's a smart young man," Peterson said. "If they give him a chance, he'll make 
it go. He's a worker, and that's probably the biggest key to it." 
</P>
<P>
The teams' records being what they are -- New York 5-1 and San Diego 2-4 -- 
Henning is understandably concerned about Sunday's matchup. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather play a team like that in the playoffs and Super Bowl," Henning 
said. "We're going through the throes of development, while Bill's program is 
in full swing, so the game will be quite a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Then, again, there is the matter of Henning's coaching against one of his 
closest friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill and I play golf, tennis and racquetball against each other," Henning 
said. "But this is business, and it's tough for both of us."

RICHTER MAKES SUDDEN IMPACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM SMITH, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For as long as he lives, goalie Mike Richter will remember he denied a penalty 
shot in his first regular-season National Hockey League start and won the game. 
</P>
<P>
He might not remember the score or who took the shot. But he will remember the 
emotion. For the record, the shooter was Kevin Dineen; Richter and the New York 
Rangers beat the Hartford Whalers, 7-3, at Madison Square Garden Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers are 5-1-1, 3-0-1 at home and have three goalies with wins. John 
Vanbiesbrouck is 3-1-1. Bob Froese and Richter each are 1-0. "It's really 
exciting to get that first win over," said Richter, 23, a member of the 1988 
U.S. Olympic team. "You try not to think about it while the game's going on. 
But all of a sudden it's over, you're happy, you're relieved and you want to 
savor it." 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers were ahead, 4-2, with 4:30 left in the second period when 
defenseman David Shaw tripped Dineen on a breakaway, and referee Bill McCreary 
called for a penalty shot. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an exciting moment," Richter said. "The crowd was great. They got on 
their feet and cheered. That can't make it easy for him." Richter said before 
he skated to center ice that Dineen "asked me where I was weak. I just clammed 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Dineen skated down the slot. Richter came out about 20 feet and backed up as 
Dineen took a forehand wrist shot that missed high and outside the right post. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what he was going to do," Dineen said. "I just was thinking shot 
before I went. He did come out so far I should have deked him. Instead, he gave 
me a little top corner ... so I decided to shoot." 
</P>
<P>
Richter said, "He went upstairs. Fortunately, there wasn't an awful lot there. 
He just missed." 
</P>
<P>
As often happens after a missed penalty shot, the Whalers sagged and the 
Rangers surged. Ulf Dahlen got his second goal of the game and sixth of the 
season at 17:37 to make it 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford's Ron Francis scored 45 seconds into the third, but Rangers rookie 
Troy Mallette got his first Garden goal at 2:07, and Tomas Sandstrom scored at 
9:20 to make it 7-3. Talking about the penalty shot, Rangers defenseman Brian 
Leetch said, "It was a big part of the turning point." 
</P>
<P>
Richter had not played since a Sept. 30 preseason game and said he was nervous 
all day. "I was excited and looking forward to it," he said. "I really wanted 
the game to get going." 
</P>
<P>
He yielded a goal to Pat Verbeek on a rebound 3:50 into the game. But the 
Rangers got successive first-period goals by John Ogrodnick, Darren Turcotte, 
Dahlen and Kelly Kisio to pull ahead, 4-1. The Whalers' Sylvain Cote scored at 
18:03 on a shot that caromed in off the stick of defenseman Randy Moller. 
</P>
<P>
"I came in after the period and said, 'Sorry about that,' " Moller said. "I'm 
glad it wasn't the third period." 
</P>
<P>
At 4:30 of the second, Rangers defenseman Ron Greschner made a glove save on a 
backhand flip shot by Hartford's Jody Hull with Richter out of position. "I 
came over and thanked him," Richter said of Greschner. "He's an old guy, but 
he's still got a good glove hand." 
</P>
<P>
Richter got another favor at the end of the game when Chris Nilan gave him the 
souvenir puck. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers' line of Carey Wilson, Dahlen and Sandstrom combined for three 
goals, five assists. Wilson extended his goal-less streak to seven games but 
had an assist, six shots and a plus-3 rating. "Sooner or later," Sandstrom 
said, "he's going to get one." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Roger Neilson said he will decide Friday on his goalie for Saturday's 
game in Philadelphia. Talking about Richter, he said, "I think the team was 
really happy for him. He's really an eager kid, great in practice. He's always 
challenging guys. I think everybody wanted him to play well ... He did a real 
good job."

POINT LOMA BEATS MIRA MESA AGAIN AND AGAIN

<P>
He had been waiting a year for another opportunity and he finally got it. Then, 
quick as you can say, "Throw the yellow flag," it was taken away. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time Point Loma kicker Bob Simoneau had a chance to think about it, 
his teammate, quarterback Danny White, was crashing through a stubborn 
defensive line from the one-yard line to give visiting Point Loma (4-3, 2-0) a 
27-23 Eastern League victory Friday night over eighth-ranked Mira Mesa (5-2, 
1-1). 
</P>
<P>
So all is fine for Simoneau. 
</P>
<P>
You see, Simoneau had kicked what appeared to be the winning field goal with 
1:15 remaining, but Mira Mesa was penalized for roughing the kicker. Point Loma 
Coach Bennie Edens elected to erase the points and take a first and goal inside 
the one. White scored six seconds later. Point Loma's two-point conversion 
attempt failed. 
</P>
<P>
This takes us back to last year's Point Loma-Helix game, when Simoneau also had 
a chance to kick a game-winning field goal. The kick was blocked. Once again 
Friday, his chance to be the hero slipped away. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been waiting for an opportunity like that," Simoneau said. "But we ended 
up scoring anyway. I figure as long as the team wins we'll be all right." 
</P>
<P>
Things started out strangely for second-ranked Point Loma. In fact, the game's 
beginning was awfully strange. In the first four minutes of the first quarter, 
three touchdowns were scored in a span of 42 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
First, Mira Mesa quarterback J.J. Rowlett threw a shuffle pass to running back 
Don Elder, who found a lot of space through the right side of the Point Loma 
line and scurried 69 yards down the sideline before being driven out at the 
one. Running back Wayne Pittman (11 carries, 98 yards) scored two plays later. 
</P>
<P>
Then, White (15-22, 234 yards) gave everybody an example of Point Loma's 
inimitable passing attack, throwing a line drive to J.J. Stokes on the Pointers 
first play from scrimmage. Eighty yards. Touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, it was Pittman's turn. He went 56 yards for a touchdown and 
Mira Mesa led, 12-7. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa increased its lead to 23-13 by halftime, but Eden's defense steadied 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that with our kind of offense we can come back like that," White said. 
"We really wanted Mira Mesa. They've said stuff about our program. They say 
that Coach Edens recruits." 
</P>
<P>
Does he? 
</P>
<P>
"I live in Point Loma," White said. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma pulled to 23-21 with 2:07 remaining in the third quarter, following 
a three play, 49-yard drive. Point Loma running back Marlin Manasa, who rushed 
22 times for 112 yards, was headed for the end zone but fumbled on the two. 
Guard Memo Alcoser pounced on it for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The winning drive covered 82 yards in 16 plays. It almost stalled with 4:02 
remaining, but White hooked up with tight end Pedro Torices over the middle for 
19 yards on fourth and eight from the Mira Mesa 28. Four plays later White 
scored the game-winner.

GRANADA HILLS HAS ALL THE HEROES

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Down through the years, it seemed that there was always someone to carry the 
Canoga Park High football team. 
</P>
<P>
In the '60s, it was running back Bob Adams who led the Hunters to their last 
City Section championship in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
In the '70s, Canoga Park had All-City tailback Mark Terranova. 
</P>
<P>
In the '80s, it was all-league running back Mike Conover. 
</P>
<P>
But as they approach the '90s, the Hunters have become the hunted. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills, the Valley-area's top-ranked team, showed Canoga Park no mercy 
Friday night, stalking the Hunters and dropping them, 44-6, in a Northwest 
Valley Conference game at Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing the woeful Hunters (0-6, 0-3 in conference play) had in 
common with the Highlanders was their green-and-white school colors. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills running back Brett Washington led the way, rushing for 165 yards 
and two touchdowns -- his seventh and eighth of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills scored on its first three possessions and was driving again when 
the half mercifully ended for Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders went 54 yards on their first scoring march, Washington running 
seven yards for the touchdown with 7:01 remaining in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Glasgow capped a 56-yard drive with a 13-yard touchdown burst late in the 
second period. Andy Petroski added the kick, putting Granada Hills ahead, 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
It was Washington again in the second quarter, rambling untouched 17 yards on a 
draw play to score his second touchdown. Petroski's kick made it 21-0 
Highlanders with 8:51 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills held Canoga Park to three yards rushing in the first half and 123 
yards overall. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders, led by Washington's 123 yards, had 221 yards in offense in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills (6-0, 3-0) led, 21-0, at intermission, then tacked on 16 
third-quarter points to turn the game into a runaway. 
</P>
<P>
Even backup quarterback Chris Gadomski got into the act, tossing a 75-yard 
touchdown pass to Glasgow in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter quarterback David Erhardt was about all Canoga Park had going for it. 
</P>
<P>
Erhardt completed 15 of 31 passes for 200 yards and one touchdown. He threw one 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
Erhardt's 39-yard touchdown pass to David Payne with 2:07 left broke a two-game 
streak during which the Highlander defense had not given up an offensive 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills has allowed only 40 points in six games.

ALEMANY PUTS CRESPI TURNOVERS TO GOOD USE IN 28-21 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The inability to cling to the football has left Crespi High grasping -- and 
gasping -- for its life. 
</P>
<P>
The Celts fumbled four times and Alemany converted two of the turnovers into 14 
points en route to a 28-21 Del Rey League upset on Friday night at Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped the Celts to 4-3 overall, 0-2 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
"We just can't afford to turn the ball over like this every week and expect to 
win ballgames," Crespi Coach Tim Lins said. "The way we're playing right now, 
we'd be lucky to slip in (to the playoffs)." 
</P>
<P>
The Indians, on the other hand, are in fine shape. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a massive win," Alemany Coach Pat Blackburn said. "This is the finest 
win I've ever had as a coach." 
</P>
<P>
And he can thank quarterback Joey Rosselli and tailback Terry Barnum. 
</P>
<P>
The tandem starred in the first half as Alemany (4-3, 1-0) built a 21-7 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Any thoughts of a Crespi rout similar to the 49-0 victory of last season were 
quickly put to rest. 
</P>
<P>
Rosselli connected with Frank Winton for a 52-yard touchdown on the fifth play 
of the game, and Alemany was off and running. 
</P>
<P>
Rosselli finished 10 of 18 for 189 yards and three touchdowns. And when he 
wasn't passing, Barnum was finding the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Barnum, a sophomore, caught a 49-yard touchdown pass from Rosselli in the first 
quarter, then added a 78-yard scoring run after a Crespi fumble in the second 
quarter. Barnum darted for 135 yards in 19 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Leonice Brown, who gained 148 yards in 21 carries for Crespi, also fumbled 
twice. Three times, including Brown's miscue that set up Barnum's run, the 
Celts turned the ball over in Indian territory. 
</P>
<P>
Brown scored on a 30-yard run to tie the score, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Celts took the second-half kickoff and ate up more than seven minutes 
before quarterback Bill Canalez connected with tight end Christian Fauria for a 
three-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
However, a Canalez fumble late in the third quarter cost the Celts dearly. 
</P>
<P>
Rosselli converted it into an 18-yard touchdown pass to Scott Goldsmith. 
</P>
<P>
Another Canalez-to-Fauria touchdown pass made it interesting, but it wasn't 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians' big-play capability was evident throughout the first half. Alemany 
gained 230 yards before intermission, and 179 of them came on scoring plays. 
</P>
<P>
Rosselli had 115 yards passing after his third attempt.

FIRST INTERSTATE TO REPORT LOSS; 
</P>
<P>
BANKING: THE FIRM SAYS $174 MILLION OF RED INK FROM ITS ARIZONA UNIT'S SHAKY 
REAL ESTATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
First Interstate Bancorp said Friday that it will report a $16-million 
quarterly loss next week because of continuing problems in Arizona, further 
evidence that lenders there face growing troubles stemming from the state's 
severe real estate recession. 
</P>
<P>
The third-quarter loss for the Los Angeles banking company comes in the wake of 
pressure by the U.S. comptroller of the currency on First Interstate to boost 
reserves against its problem loans in Arizona. Regulators reviewed First 
Interstate's Arizona unit in September and October, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate said its Arizona unit will show a $174-million loss when its 
results are released on Wednesday. First Interstate said the Arizona unit is 
taking a huge, $350-million provision for loan losses in the quarter stemming 
from problems with real estate construction loans and commercial mortgage 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
Losses for the parent company will only be $16 million because the Arizona 
losses are offset by profits at healthy units, especially First Interstate's 
banks in California, Washington, Oregon and Nevada. In the third quarter of 
last year, First Interstate Bancorp posted a $214-million loss, largely because 
of provisions for loan losses in Texas. Next week's earnings report is expected 
to show improvement in the Texas operation. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate's announcement is a clear sign that economic problems in 
Arizona are continuing with few signs of letting up, leading some to dub the 
state "the next Texas." 
</P>
<P>
Just three years ago, Arizona was booming. Now the state is suffering through a 
severe real estate recession, brought on largely by overbuilding and a slowdown 
in the number of people moving into the state. 
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday, Valley National Corp., Arizona's biggest financial institution, 
posted a $72.2-million loss. Other banks, including Security Pacific Corp., 
Chase Manhattan Corp., Citicorp and Great American also reported varying 
degrees of problems with their real estate loans in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
For all banks in Arizona, non-performing loans -- those that are 90 days past 
due or those in which banks are not earning interest -- total $1.5 billion, up 
28% since the first of the year, according to Sheshunoff Information Services, 
a banking research firm in Austin, Tex. The bulk of the non-performing loans 
are those related to real estate, which have soared 37% to $1.2 billion since 
the start of the year. 
</P>
<P>
More important, the non-performing loans in Arizona total 7.7% of all 
outstanding loans made by banks in the state, according to Sheshunoff, the 
highest percentage of any state in the nation and more than twice the 
percentage for both the nation and for California. Arizona's non-performing 
real estate loans total 14% of all real estate loans there, also the highest 
percentage of any state. 
</P>
<P>
Non-performing loans at First Interstate's Arizona bank totaled $335 million at 
the end of the quarter. The bank's non-performing assets, which also includes 
foreclosed property, totaled $416 million. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, First Interstate Chief Executive Joseph J. Pinola acknowledged 
that regulators wanted the bank to provide a bigger cushion to protect against 
losses from its Arizona loans. Banking executives say regulators are putting 
increasing pressure on banks to set aside money for problem loans as a result 
of the nation's massive thrift bailout, which demonstrated the need for larger 
cushions against real estate losses. 
</P>
<P>
Pinola said he believes that Arizona's economic problems are much different 
from those of Texas and Oklahoma, which were hit hard by both overbuilding and 
a severe recession in the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
John F. Kooken, vice chairman and chief financial officer of Security Pacific 
Corp., parent of Security Pacific National Bank, said there has been some 
improvement in real estate sales in Arizona in recent weeks, but added that it 
is difficult to tell if the state's economy is improving. 
</P>
<P>
"There continue to be bad problems, and it's not 100% clear how fast it will 
change," Kooken said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Williams, a securities analyst for Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco, said 
that although First Interstate's problems in Arizona are well known, the size 
of the loss there was unexpectedly high. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate's stock hardly reacted to the news, closing at $57.625, down 
25 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

BANK PROBLEMS IN ARIZONA 
</P>
<P>
Bank problems in Arizona reported this month: 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate Bancorp, Los Angeles: Arizona unit's losses in third quarter 
will total $174 million, representing a $16-million loss for parent company. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific Corp., Los Angeles: Net credit losses for the third quarter 
rose 33%, to $109 million, largely because of Arizona problems. 
</P>
<P>
Chase Manhattan Corp., New York: Takes $85-million after-tax charge, related to 
Arizona problems. 
</P>
<P>
Valley National Corp., Phoenix: State's largest financial institution posts

REGULATOR CONFIRMS HE MET WITH OWNER OF LINCOLN S&amp;L;

<P>
THRIFTS: M. DANNY WALL SAYS THE PRIVATE SESSIONS DIDN'T INFLUENCE HIS AGENCY'S 
DECISION TO SPARE THE COMPANY FROM SEIZURE.

<P>
M. Danny Wall, the chief federal regulator of the thrift industry, acknowledged 
Friday that he had met privately with the owner of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan 
shortly before his agency rejected a recommendation from its San Francisco 
office in 1987 to seize the failing Irvine institution. 
</P>
<P>
Wall, who now heads the Office of Thrift Supervision, the successor agency to 
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said in an interview that he had three 
meetings and one telephone conversation with Charles H. Keating Jr., Lincoln's 
operator, while he was FHLBB chief. 
</P>
<P>
He was responding to charges by House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs 
Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) that Keating's personal pleas had 
persuaded the bank board not to seize Lincoln in 1987. Federal regulators took 
over Lincoln nearly two years later, and the delay cost taxpayers an estimated 
$2 billion and deprived many unsuspecting investors of their life savings. 
</P>
<P>
Wall, who has been subpoenaed to testify about the Lincoln affair before the 
House committee Nov. 7, said he and Keating had been personal acquaintances 
before their meetings at the bank board office. 
</P>
<P>
But he said Keating had no special access, that he requested nothing improper 
and that the meetings did not affect the board's decision not to seize Lincoln 
at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, who has been charged with milking Lincoln's assets and thus 
precipitating the worst savings and loan disaster in the nation's history, had 
been introduced to Wall several years earlier in the office of Sen. Jake Garn 
(R-Utah). Before heading the bank board, Wall was an adviser to Garn. 
</P>
<P>
Wall said he had always known Keating as a man prone to "pontificating . . . 
someone who thought very much of his own opinion, who wanted to talk and not 
listen." But when Keating met with him at the bank board in 1987 and 
subsequently, Wall recalled, "his self-confidence over his being in a regulated 
business was eroding." 
</P>
<P>
He said the freewheeling businessman was temperamentally "not cut out" for the 
management of a business under federal and state regulation. 
</P>
<P>
After Lincoln was bought in 1986 by Keating's company, American Continental 
Corp. of Phoenix, it shifted its investments into junk bonds, undeveloped real 
estate and other risky ventures. It is estimated that the failure of Lincoln, 
which was seized by the government last April, led to a $2-billion federal 
payout to insured depositors. 
</P>
<P>
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which has 
taken control of Lincoln's assets, testified before the Gonzalez committee 
earlier this week that he thought it was improper for Wall to have met with 
Keating at the time the bank board was reviewing a recommendation from its San 
Francisco office about action against Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
"I am of a different view," Wall declared in the interview. He said he has 
always been willing to meet with disgruntled savings and loan officials. "I 
have been in public service for 28 years. I will meet and talk to anyone. Of 
course, there are times when, legally, I can't. I certainly do it whenever time 
permits." 
</P>
<P>
Wall said Keating first came to see him at the bank board on Sept. 24, 1987, 
about four months after the San Francisco regulators found cause to recommend 
supervisory action against Lincoln. Wall said he had not read the report from 
San Francisco at the time of the meeting but that Keating's visit brought it to 
his attention. 
</P>
<P>
He said Keating called on him to bring the matter, which had been the subject 
of a 16-month investigation, to a speedy conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other thrift officers who came to see him, Wall said, Keating often 
complained about how he was being treated by officials in the San Francisco 
office. But Wall said he dismissed those complaints as nothing he had not heard 
before in other cases. 
</P>
<P>
"They always say, 'They are out to get me -- they don't like me,' " he said. 
"What else would you expect someone to say?" 
</P>
<P>
After the first meeting with Keating, Wall ordered an independent review of the 
matter by senior staff in the Washington headquarters. The office in San 
Francisco was prohibited from performing supervisory and examination activity. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Hoyle, a spokesman for Wall, said Friday that an independent review was 
necessary because the earlier audit was no longer valid. He said Lincoln's 
financial picture had improved and, by December, the thrift had hired a new 
chief executive who had the confidence of the bank board. 
</P>
<P>
The second review led to a decision not to take supervisory action against 
Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Keating again came to see the bank board chairman Jan. 28, 1988, complaining 
about press "leaks" regarding the board's dealings with Lincoln, which he 
alleged were coming from the San Francisco office, Wall said. He said his 
reaction to Keating's complaint was that "you know full well there is nothing I 
can do about that." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, on Jan. 17, 1989, Keating paid his last visit to Wall's FHLBB office, 
Wall said. He came at a time when the board was closing in on Lincoln for 
suspected violations of a number of regulations. Wall said Keating told him, 
"I've had enough, I want to get out," and declared his intention to sell 
Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Wall later received a follow-up call on that visit from Keating after he had 
located a potential buyer. Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and Dennis DeConcini 
(D-Ariz.) also telephoned Wall at the time and asked him to approve the sale, 
which was rejected by FHLBB. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wall knew Keating before he went to work for FHLBB, he denied charges 
leveled by Gonzalez that as a Garn aide he had solicited donations from Keating 
for the Garn Institute of Finance at the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Both Lincoln and American Continental made contributions to the institute in 
1986, according to Elaine Weiss, an official of the fund. The donations 
reportedly amounted to more than $25,000. A Keating spokesman and fund 
officials supported Wall's contention that he never raised funds for the Garn 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Wall said he had attended two institute board meetings on behalf of the senator 
before becoming FHLBB chief. Weiss said Wall also has served as a program 
speaker for the institute from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of Lincoln's parent firm, American Continental 
Corp., and M. Danny Wall, head of the Office of Thrift Supervision, are 
scheduled to testify at House Banking Committee hearings Nov. 7.

PARENT FIRM TO GO ON WITH PLAN FOR DANA POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S. executive with Qintex Australia Ltd. said Friday that the company's plan 
to build a luxurious resort in Dana Point is still on track, despite the 
bankruptcy of a subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
The subsidiary, Qintex Entertainment, filed for protection from creditors this 
week after missing a $5.9-million payment to MCA Inc. that it owed under a film 
distribution agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy was one more sign of trouble at Qintex Australia Ltd., the 
parent company, which owns 43% of Qintex Entertainment's stock. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, Qintex Australia Ltd. saw its $1.5-billion purchase of the 
MGM/UA film studios fall through when Qintex was unable to scrape together what 
was essentially a $50-million down payment. 
</P>
<P>
"The companies are completely separate entities," said the executive, who asked 
not to be identified. "As of today, there's no indication there'll be any 
impact at all on the resort." But local officials worried Friday that Qintex 
might back out of the resort project. 
</P>
<P>
"We're anxiously waiting to hear something definite on this," said Dana Point 
Mayor Eileen Krause. The resort hotel could bring a big increase in tax revenue 
to the small, newly incorporated city. 
</P>
<P>
At least one local company wasn't worried, however. Stein-Brief Group said its 
deal to sell Qintex 232 acres in Dana Point for the resort has already been 
closed. Sources said most of the $132-million price of the land had already 
been paid in cash to Stein-Brief and its partner, Hawaiian hotel developer 
Hemmeter Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Not yet closed, sources said, is the sale of a further 115 acres in Dana Point, 
owned by Chandler-Sherman Corp., to Qintex for $115 million. Chandler-Sherman 
said it does not talk to the media and refused to comment on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
An Australian stock analyst, Bryan Madden of Prudential-Bache in Melbourne, 
said Qintex had made only a deposit on the Chandler-Sherman property and was 
deferring payment of most of the $115 million until 1991.

QINTEX ENTERTAINMENT FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Qintex Entertainment Inc., whose Australian affiliate's deal to buy MGM/UA 
Communications Co. collapsed nearly two weeks ago amid financing problems, has 
filed for bankruptcy law protection after it failed to make a debt payment, the 
company announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, David Evans resigned as president, chief executive and a director, 
but he will remain as a consultant until a successor is appointed, Qintex said. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy filing raises new questions about just how cash-strapped is 
Qintex Australia, the Brisbane-based broadcasting and resorts empire founded by 
investor Christopher C. Skase. That company owns 43% of Qintex Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills-based television production firm, best known for co-producing 
the hit "Lonesome Dove" miniseries, filed late Thursday for protection from its 
creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Under Chapter 11, a 
company continues operating while it works out a plan to pay its debts. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex's two subsidiaries, Hal Roach Studios and Qintex Productions, were 
included in the bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
In over-the-counter trading Friday, Qintex stock plunged $2.63 a share to close 
at $1.50, with more than 1.43 million shares changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex Entertainment filed for bankruptcy because it and Qintex Australia were 
unable to arrange financing to pay $5.95 million due to MCA Inc. as part of a 
distribution agreement, said Qintex Entertainment Executive Vice President 
Jonathan Lloyd. The company relies primarily on Qintex Australia to provide 
working capital. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a grave disappointment that they were unable or unwilling to fund that 
obligation," Lloyd said. Qintex Entertainment officials feared that failure to 
make the MCA payment might trigger acceleration clauses in its other debt, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"This company . . . has grown at a very rapid rate. That kind of growth in a 
production company requires a lot of capital and deficit financing," Lloyd 
said. "It was always understood (that Qintex Australia) . . . would be there to 
fund the growth of the company." 
</P>
<P>
Evans, an Australian who was closely associated with Qintex Australia, resigned 
for "personal reasons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A Qintex Australia spokesman said the company had "re-evaluated its position as 
a significant shareholder and substantial creditor" of the U.S. company and 
decided to "minimize the degree of further loans" to the affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex Australia is not having financial problems, the spokesman said. "Nothing 
should be read into this concerning the viability of Qintex Australia. This is 
Qintex Entertainment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex Entertainment maintained that the bankruptcy filing was unrelated to 
Qintex Australia's shredded deal with MGM/UA. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.5-billion sale of MGM/UA fell apart Oct. 10 after Qintex Australia 
failed to deliver a $50-million letter of credit. MGM/UA responded by filing 
suit against Qintex Australia alleging breach of contract, fraud and negligent 
misrepresentation that resulted in damages of more than $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd said Qintex currently has enough cash on hand to pay its bills. "We do 
think the business is viable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine months ended April 30, Qintex Entertainment reported operating 
revenue of $76.8 million and income before an extraordinary credit of $2.3 
million. Qintex reported losses in the previous two fiscal years. On April 30, 
the company had assets of $220 million and net worth of $63 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Management didn't make the decision lightly," Lloyd said. "We feel very 
distressed about the effect on the stock price and our shareholders."

PERSONAL FINANCE: WHO SHOULD PURCHASE EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You're concerned about a Bay Area-style temblor rocking Southern California. 
But is earthquake insurance too expensive or a rip-off? What else can you do to 
minimize the potential damage to your home in a quake? 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, quake insurance is expensive, and unnecessary and unfairly priced for 
some homeowners. But some property owners, nonetheless, should seriously 
consider getting it. 
</P>
<P>
The typical premium is around $2 for each $1,000 of coverage, with a 10% 
deductible applied separately to the structure and internal contents. So, for a 
$200,000 home, the premium would average $400, with a whopping $20,000 
deductible. (So far there are no widespread reports of premium increases 
following the Bay Area quake, but some are expected.) 
</P>
<P>
Premiums are higher for high-risk structures, such as unreinforced masonry (a 
rarity among single-family homes in Southern California), split-level and 
two-story homes, or homes with unusual, non-box-like designs. 
</P>
<P>
Premiums also are higher for homes in high-risk areas, such as those near fault 
lines, in coastal areas, on hillsides, or on sandy soils or landfills such as 
in the Marina area of San Francisco, where many homes were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
There are several good arguments not to get quake coverage: 
</P>
<P>
* Conventional wood frame or stucco homes -- typical in Southern California -- 
hold up well if they are built on firm ground. Most homes built since the 1950s 
also are bolted to their foundations to prevent slipping. 
</P>
<P>
* Most homeowner policies will cover damage that might accompany a quake, such 
as from fire, water or broken windows. 
</P>
<P>
* Earthquake policies typically exclude chimneys, brick facades, concrete walls 
-- things most likely to be damaged. 
</P>
<P>
* If the Big One hits, the government will provide relief anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these arguments are valid. Still, you might want to get a quake policy 
anyway. First, federal relief may be limited. Early indications from Northern 
California and previous experience indicates that some earthquake victims may 
not get enough aid to cover the cost of their homes. And if they receive loans, 
those presumably will have to be paid back. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the purpose of insurance is to protect yourself against catastrophes, not 
nuisances. If you have no other major assets except your home, quake insurance 
may be worth it for added peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
"People who need it are those who have their whole life savings invested in 
their home," says Joe Annotti, spokesman for the Independent Insurance Agents 
and Brokers of California. 
</P>
<P>
If you are among the one in five Southern California residents that already has 
earthquake insurance, the Bay Area experience has yielded some key tips for how 
to respond if a temblor hits. Take pictures of broken contents and other 
damage, Annotti suggests. That way you can clean up and get on with living, and 
still prove your claim. Also, if you have any doubt about structural damage, 
call your agent and have the insurance company inspect the property just in 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not you have insurance, there are many other things you can do. 
</P>
<P>
First, inspect your home to see that it is attached to the foundation with sill 
bolts or some other reinforcement. This can be done by simply going into the 
crawl space of your house because such supports are easily visible, says David 
Breiholz, a civil engineer and chairman of the hazardous buildings committee of 
the Structural Engineers Assn. of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't trust your judgment or want a more comprehensive checkup, call a 
competent home builder, contractor or experienced handyman. You can also call 
the Structural Engineers Assn. of Southern California at (213) 385-4424. They 
will send you a list of structural engineers in your area, if you live in Los 
Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura or Santa Barbara counties. 
In San Diego County, call the Structural Engineers Assn. of San Diego at (619) 
223-9955. 
</P>
<P>
However, these professionals can be expensive; many charge as much as $100 an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
If you find your home needs reinforcement, doing it yourself may cost you less 
than $100 for materials, Breiholz says. 
</P>
<P>
Having a professional do the work may cost between $500 and $1,000, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Other common steps you should take: brace your water heater to the wall with 
galvanized plumber's tape to prevent it from falling; brace shelves, display 
cases and other fixtures to walls; and make sure household chemicals, flammable 
materials and other dangerous items are stored safely.

APPLE COMPUTER'S PROFIT RISES 49% IN FOURTH QUARTER

Apple Computer Inc.'s earnings rose 49% in the latest quarter, mainly because 
of a gain from selling its stock in Adobe Systems Inc., the company said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Operating income before the Adobe gain and taxes and interest rose by a 
narrower 2%. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman John Sculley said the company was recovering from a squeeze on profit 
margins caused by high component costs. Apple was faulted for buying large 
quantities of computer chips at unusually high prices during a temporary 
shortage last year. 
</P>
<P>
Apple's fourth-quarter earnings, including an after-tax gain of $48 million 
from the Adobe sale, were $161.1 million, up from $107.9 million a year 
earlier. Revenue rose to $1.38 billion from $1.17 billion.

Beverly Enterprises: The Pasadena long-term health-care company said it had a 
$929,000 profit in the third quarter, contrasted with an $11-million loss a 
year earlier due to restructuring charges. Revenue grew 3% to $533 million. The 
latest results were attributed to the sale of some facilities.

DOW INCREASE PUSHES WEEK TO RECORD GAIN

<P>
Wall Street stocks closed mixed Friday after blue chips gained in a late surge 
of buying, ending one of the most volatile weeks in the market's history on a 
calm note. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 5.94 to 2,689.14, stretching its 
gain for the week to a record 119.88 points. The previous largest weekly point 
gain for the average was 114.86, in the week ended June 3, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In five days' time, the Dow has recovered more than half its Friday the 13th 
loss of 190.58 points. 
</P>
<P>
Declines outnumbered advances by about 6 to 5 in the daily tally of New York 
Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 662 up, 829 down and 478 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Many longtime market watchers breathed easier after the session. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are happy to have this week over," said one trader, who said he 
and others had worked through the weekend following the market's Friday the 
13th tumble. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers also noted that traders were proceeding cautiously as they waited for 
the passing of another monthly "witching hour" involving the last trading of 
expiring stock options and stock index futures contracts. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the occasion seemed to work in the market's favor by 
producing some buying of blue chips near the close. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some observers said the market was still feeling the positive 
effects of the government report Thursday that the consumer price index rose 
just 0.2% in September. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said optimism about the takeover outlook, after slowly reviving in 
recent days, suffered a new setback when British Airways said it wouldn't take 
part in any effort to revive a buyout deal for UAL Corp. 
</P>
<P>
UAL shares, which traded as high as 294 before buyout plans for the company ran 
into trouble, tumbled 21 5/8 to 168 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
However, in contrast to a week earlier when the deal first went sour, the 
action in UAL was no longer dragging the rest of the market down with it. 
</P>
<P>
Other airlines that fell included AMR Corp., off 2 1/2 to 70 7/8, Delta Air 
Lines,, down 1 to 69, and Southwest Airlines, off 3/8 to 25. 
</P>
<P>
USAir Group was the sole gainer in the group, rising 1 3/4 to 43 1/4 after a 
published report said investor Marvin Davis had acquired a small block of 
stock. Davis declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph rose 1/4 
to 43 5/8; Exxon gained 3/8 to 46 1/8; Coca-Cola added 3/8 to 70 3/4, and 
International Business Machines was up 1/8 at 104 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Hercules Inc., which reported a third-quarter earnings gain that evidently fell 
short of investors' hopes, fell 3 1/4 to 44 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 164.83 million shares, down from 198.12 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the key Nikkei average of 225-shares, which jumped 
266.66 points Thursday, added 112.16 points to end the week at 35,486.38. 
</P>
<P>
In London, share prices closed moderately lower after a thinly traded session 
influenced largely by declines on Wall Street and weakness in the British 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times 100-share index ended 10.2 points lower at 2,179.1. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
In the credit markets, government bond prices finished lower in sluggish 
trading, weighed down by concerns about a heavy supply of new issues.

The 30-year Treasury bond lost 1/4 point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 in face 
amount, after being up as much as $3.75 earlier in the day. Its yield rose to 
7.98% from 7.96% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market's early rise was an extension of Thursday's rally, 
which saw 30-year bond prices rise by about $8 for every $1,000 in face value 
due to a report of a smaller-than-expected rise in consumer prices last month. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.688%, the same as Thursday's late rate. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended higher in quiet trading following a mixed performance 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Currency traders attributed the rise largely to internal market influences in 
the absence of any new market-moving news. They said the market was awaiting 
the release of the September durable goods report on Tuesday and the 
preliminary report on the third-quarter gross national product on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
However, Earl I. Johnson, a trader with Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago, said 
prospects for increased demand for dollars by the Japanese were giving some 
support to the currency. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
closed at 141.35 yen, down 0.20 yen from Thursday's close. It was quoted at 
142.30 yen in London, and at 142.425 yen in New York, up from 142.00. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was higher against the British pound. Sterling sold for $1.5885 in 
London, down from $1.5940 late Thursday. In New York, each pound bought 
$1.5885, down from $1.5975.

BRING ON THE CHAIN SAWS FOR A SICKLY 'SOLID OAK' 
</P>

<P>
"Solid Oak," the newest play in town, is, to put it kindly, dead wood. 
</P>
<P>
Bring on the chain saws. 
</P>
<P>
The only question about Robert Mearns' play at the Gaslamp Quarter's newly 
named Elizabeth North Theatre is whether this world premiere is ready for 
burial, or if it might exhibit some signs of life pruned back to one-act size 
-- the length of all of Mearns' previous plays. 
</P>
<P>
But even this question is strictly academic -- a mere detail for the coroner's 
report. There's no life stirring here now. 
</P>
<P>
The story, ostensibly, is about an old man who wants to give a solid oak table 
to two brothers as a keepsake, to remind them of his message that "God is 
within." One brother, Darryl, says thanks. The other, Sonny, says thanks, but 
no thanks -- he'd rather sell the table in his antique store. 
</P>
<P>
Then they argue about giving, keeping and selling the table, reiterating the 
same arguments over and over for a numbing 90 minutes, during which audience 
gazes have a way of surreptitiously stealing to the exit doors. 
</P>
<P>
It's not even as if you can expect any great revelations at the end. This is a 
lot like waiting in a line at Disneyland only to find that, just when it's your 
turn, they've canceled the ride. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of the play has less to do with the production values -- always 
professional at the Gaslamp's two beautifully appointed theaters -- than the 
choice of script. It's the latest in a bewildering battery of bombs that have 
betrayed a curious predilection for plotless, talky tales all year. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the Gaslamp should have continued extending its one hit this year, "I'm 
Not Rappaport," and canceled the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it has provided months of watching professionals try to play 
professionally with amateur equipment. It can't be done. 
</P>
<P>
Could James A. Strait have directed "Solid Oak" any differently? Well, as with 
the Gaslamp's "The Melody Sisters," which he also directed, he could have 
hurried us through it. If you're not going to provide anesthetic when you pull 
teeth, at least you can cut the duration of the pain. 
</P>
<P>
David Whitney Johnson, a talented actor, throws his all into Sonny, pulling out 
every stop as the angry, sharp-talking salesman who wants something better than 
his father had. If the play could be resuscitated, he'd be the man to do it. 
But it can't be, and he can't. 
</P>
<P>
Providing earnest support are Kenneth Enright, a veteran of the Chula Vista 
Free Shakespeare Festival, amiable enough as the simple-minded brother, Darryl, 
and Gordon Benson, who exudes benevolent dignity as the old man, Sam. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Earl's set is elegantly simple, from the sumptuous oak table, supported 
by four carved wooden dragons at center, to the curving oak tree, providing 
shade behind a spare door frame. Matthew Cubitto's lighting suggests the 
delicate shadow of leaves. Only Jeanne Reith's costume choices are puzzling. 
Why is Sonny wearing a mechanic's jumpsuit with his name on it if he runs an 
antique store? 
</P>
<P>
Next up at the Gaslamp is "Hay Fever" at the Hahn Cosmopolitan, and talky as 
Noel Coward is, the difference is that Coward provides well-written, witty talk 
and artistic director Will Simpson is a master at 
</P>
<P>
directing such fare. 
</P>
<P>
Next season, too, looks more promising with Alan Ayckbourn, Terrence McNally, 
Christopher Durang and Hugh Whitemore on the 10th anniversary bill. The Gaslamp 
needs something meaty to revive the confidence of its audiences in the 
theater's ability to deliver good work. One can only hope that these choices 
will mark a turning point. 
</P>
<P>
Knock on wood.

ART NOTES: 'PAINT-IN' TO PROTEST CANYON DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A group of artists has scheduled a "paint-in" next Friday and Saturday on the 
Laguna Canyon hillside in the vicinity of "The Tell," the 600-foot photomural 
alongside Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
According to organizer Karen Blume of Laguna Hills, the purpose will be to 
"protest the extensive (planned) commercial and residential development of the 
property around Laguna Canyon Road" and to document the last remaining elements 
of the natural environment. From dawn to dusk, the artists will be working in 
various media -- including painting, drawing, photography and sculpture -- to 
portray the natural life of the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Blume estimates that between 25 and 50 artists will be involved, including 
members of DAB, a group of artist graduates of Cal State Fullerton. Other 
artists are welcome to join. Information: (714) 831-3015. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Art Museum will hold its annual art auction Nov. 4 at 7:30 p.m. Works 
for "The Best of the Eighties," as it is being called, have been donated by 140 
California artists including Joe Goode, Ed Ruscha, Kim Abeles, Frederick 
Eversley, Jo Ann Callis, Craig Stecyk, Joyce Treiman, Daryl Curran, Michael 
Davis, and Helen and Newton Harrison. Prospective bidders can view the works at 
the museum beginning Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets to the auction are $60 per person. The event, sponsored by the museum's 
Junior Council, will include a buffet with complimentary wine, and there will 
be a drawing for other works of art, being donated by local galleries. All 
proceeds will benefit museum education programs for Orange County 
schoolchildren. Information: (714) 494-8971. 
</P>
<P>
Also Nov. 4, the Art Institute of Southern California will hold an open house 
from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Tours of the campus will be offered, along with 
workshops in portrait and life drawing, photography, graphic design, 
illustration, computer art, ceramics and other subjects. Refreshments will be 
available. The school, a four-year college of art and design, is at 2222 Laguna 
Canyon Road in Laguna Beach. Guests are asked to call before visiting: (714) 
497-3309. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor Art Museum will hold its third annual children's holiday party 
Nov. 30. Co-sponsored by the museum's Sales and Rental Council and Family Arts 
Council, the event will feature a "holiday store" where children can buy 
low-priced gifts and have them wrapped. Included in the $12-per-person 
admission price: a children's dinner, a magician's performance, a visit and 
photo with Santa, face painting and Christmas caroling. 
</P>
<P>
Children ages 5 to 8 are invited to attend between 4 and 6 p.m.; 9- to 
12-year-olds are invited between 7 and 9 p.m. The museum is at 850 San Clemente 
Drive in Newport Beach. To register, or for more information, call the museum

'DANGEROUS GAMES' RIPPED BY N.Y. CRITICS; 
</P>
<P>
BROADWAY: AN EARLY CLOSE IS PREDICTED FOR GRACIELA DANIELE'S PLAY, ORIGINALLY 
CO-PRODUCED BY THE LA JOLLA PLAYHOUSE.

"Dangerous Games," the Graciela Daniele play originally co-produced by the La 
Jolla Playhouse with Spoleto Festival, USA and the American Music Theater 
Festival in Philadelphia, opened to bad reviews at the Nederlander Theater on 
Broadway Thursday and will likely meet with an early close. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from scattered praise for the music by Astor Piazzolla and the skill of 
the dancers, the pans were universal and extreme. Critics tore mercilessly into 
Daniele's choreography, William Finn's lyrics and the very concept of the show 
that depicts, in two tango pieces, the links between machismo, eroticism and 
violence in an unnamed Latin American country. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Rich of the New York Times put down the production as "a hypocritical 
exploitation of the machismo it purports to condemn." Linda Winer of New York 
Newsday condemned it as "a twisted show, more muddled and inept than scary or 
controversial." Howard Kissel of the New York Daily News described it as "not 
very satisfying," and Clive Barnes of the New York Post said that "its spurious 
theatrics were awful," and "its gratuitous violence . . . ran close to 
pornography." 
</P>
<P>
As a co-producer, the financially strapped La Jolla Playhouse would share in 
any profits but is not risking any money in the Broadway production. A source 
in New York who asked not to be named said the show will probably close this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The kindest words any of the New York critics had came from Michael Kuchwara of 
the Associated Press, who said the show was "not as interesting as it sounds" 
and "the dancing is a tad pretentious and silly." 
</P>
<P>
When the show opened locally, it gathered negative to mixed reviews from Sylvie 
Drake of the Los Angeles Times and Welton Jones of the San Diego Union, with a 
sole rave from Bill Hagen of the Tribune, who called the show "unusual and 
exciting . . . pretty close to flammable theater." 
</P>
<P>
Drake praised the "stunning visuals," but said the show "loses most of its edge 
when it opens its mouth. Silence in this case would have been, if not golden, 
ever so much more eloquent." 
</P>
<P>
Jones said, "There's no denying that 'Dangerous Games' packs a wallop," but 
added, "To be charitable, one can say that 'Dangerous Games' fails to make any 
significant comment on the somber issues it raises." 
</P>
<P>
From the New York Times' Rich: "If theater people want to make a spectacle of 
themselves on a Broadway stage, that is their inalienable right, but whatever 
happened to the poor audience's right to enjoy a few laughs in the face of such 
disaster? 'Dangerous Games' . . . extinguishes all opportunities for fun by 
shrouding its inanities in stern sermonettes on sexual politics, dour images 
from Greek mythology and real-life South American state terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
From Newsday's Winer: "Perhaps Broadway has seen uglier, clumsier, more 
repugnant shows than 'Dangerous Games.' In the bad-taste theatrical 
sweepstakes, however, this one is a world-class contender." 
</P>
<P>
From the Daily News' Kissel: "Daniele's imagination seldom goes beyond the 
adolescent in her depiction of the earthiness and sensuality of the brothel or 
the repressiveness of the generals." 
</P>
<P>
And from the Post's Barnes: "The sad thing is that the dancers do their level 
best to raise this grisly corpse of an evening into some semblance of life -- 
as if they were literally flogging a dead horse."

HALLOWEEN: A FESTIVAL OF DUDS, DECOR AND DOINGS

<P>
Halloween used to mean witches, jack-o'-lanterns and a safe trick or treat 
around the block. And it lasted one night. 
</P>
<P>
Lately it has turned into a major holiday rivaling the Fourth of July. Note the 
costume counters at every turn, the party goods galore. A trip to the local 
pumpkin patch seems as de rigueur as a sit-down on Santa's lap. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are the events. Halloween has turned into an extravaganza of 
expensive costumes, lavish decorations and several days and nights of parties 
and festivals. 
</P>
<P>
The most ambitious event of the season is the Dragonwood Faire Autumn Festival, 
in its new location in Castaic Lake Recreation Area. A five-day celebration of 
medieval Halloween traditions, it's sort of a Renaissance Faire with witches. 
Strolling musicians, the Danse Macabre, Gypsies, scary storytelling and more 
keep the action going at every turn. Graveyards, guillotine, stocks and pillory 
stand serve as stage sets for theatrical vignettes. There will be pumpkin 
carving contests, wrapped candies for youngsters who trick or treat at the many 
craft booths, a dunk tank, maze and pony rides -- all with a medieval twist to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The costume contest (open to all fair-goers) has been divided into five 
categories: best nobility, most authentic, best fantasy, most bizarre and best 
Halloween. Proceeds benefit the Adolescent Treatment and Education Alliance, 
which deals with AIDS among teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
To reach Dragonwood, take Interstate 5 north, four miles past Magic Mountain, 
to the Lake Hughes Road exit. Drive east on Ridge Route Road and follow signs. 
Admission is $8.95 for adults, $6.95 for students and seniors with ID, and 
$2.50 for children ages 5 to 12; a five-day Faire pass is $37.50. Dates are 
Oct. 27-29 and Nov. 4-5. Hours are 10 a.m. to dusk Saturdays and Sundays, noon 
to dusk Friday. Information: (213) 395-0063. 
</P>
<P>
DAY OF THE DEAD 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the history of a different culture, two events will mark the 
Mexican Day of the Dead. Jewelry, sculpture and plates will be among the 
artifacts on display in the Olvera Street Gallery, Friday through Nov. 5. The 
collection titled "Vive tu Recuerdo" ("Your Memory Is Living") is on loan from 
UCLA. Combining Aztec and Christian traditions, the Day of the Dead celebrates 
the transition from this life into the next. 
</P>
<P>
Also on display will be works by local Mexican-American artists. Workshops 
during the week will teach traditional crafts associated with the Day of the 
Dead, which is celebrated Nov. 2 in Mexico. The gallery, E-1 Olvera St., is 
open daily 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Information: (213) 628-4349. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Children's Museum will offer its own celebration of "Dia de los 
Muertos" next Saturday and Sunday with activities throughout the museum. A 
slide presentation will show a celebration in Oaxaca, and visitors can build an 
altar. Children can make offerings out of clay, taste traditional bread, sing 
songs and make puppets. 
</P>
<P>
Museum hours will be 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $4; children under 2, free. 
Taped information: (213) 687-8000. The museum is at 310 N. Main St., Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
HAUNTED HOUSES 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere around the Southland, dozens of haunted houses will come to life (or 
death) on Halloween with a series of rooms and tableaux depicting ghoulish 
horrors. Although they can be a diverting alternative for parents who would 
rather skip trick or treating, most of the houses are too scary for 
preschoolers (and some impressionable elementary schoolers too). The best 
audience here is older children, teen-agers and adults. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department will have more than 20 haunted 
houses around the city. Many parks will also hold carnivals, stunt shows, 
costume parades or trick-or-treat villages as well. Most haunted houses are 
open only on Halloween for a few hours and cost $1 to tour. A few have extended 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Haunted houses are scheduled in these park recreation centers: Chevy Chase, 
Hollywood, Carlin G. Smith, Cypress, Elysian Valley, Montecito Heights, 
Yosemite, Central, Ardmore, Normandie, Branford, Victory-Vineland, Granada 
Hills, Mason, Winnetka, Encino, Peck Park, Rancho San Pedro, Wilmington, 
Penmar, St. Andrews, Baldwin Hills, Jim Gilliam and Palms. Call or visit the 
nearest park for details. 
</P>
<P>
In Culver City, the municipal plunge will be transformed into a "Chamber of 
Blood" with different rooms depicting scenes from Stephen King novels such as 
"Pet Semetary" and "The Shining." Tickets are on sale for the Oct. 28-31

for children 11 and under. Hours are 7-11 p.m. or sellout of 500 tickets. The 
house is at 4117 Overland Ave. Wear clothes you don't mind crawling around in. 
And the faint of heart are warned away. Information weekdays: (213) 202-5689 or 
today (213) 202-5700. 
</P>
<P>
Eagle Rock's haunted house will go up at the Eagle Rock City Hall, 2035 
Colorado Blvd., and open Friday and next Saturday, 6-9 p.m. Tickets are $3.

LUGINBILL ORDERS SDSU TO SNAP TO ATTENTION; 
</P>
<P>
MIDSEASON REPORT: SLOPPY, UNINSPIRED PLAY DURING THE SEASON'S FIRST HALF FORCES 
COACH TO MAKE DISCIPLINE A PART OF THE AZTECS' DAILY DIET.

<TEXT>
<P>
Halfway through his first season as San Diego State football coach, Al 
Luginbill says he is perplexed. He wonders why the same Aztec team that played 
UCLA to a virtual draw one week played Cal State Fullerton to a literal draw 
the next. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by his players' inconsistent play, Luginbill turned this week to the 
one method left at his disposal. 
</P>
<P>
He cracked down. 
</P>
<P>
He closed the players' lounge. He made players run extra wind sprints. He 
announced a new code of discipline: If one guy makes a mistake, everyone pays 
the penalty. He turned what had been a tough practice regimen into a tougher 
one. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to be a nice guy anymore," Luginbill said. "Those days are 
over." 
</P>
<P>
The first test of that new policy comes tonight at 7:05 when the Aztecs (2-3-1) 
play Pacific (1-6) in a nonconference homecoming game at San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific is the kind of team SDSU should beat handily. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers have not had a winning season since 1977. Injuries have knocked out 
their top two running backs. A former tight end is their leading rusher. Their 
only victory was over Cal State Long Beach (26-25), a team the Aztecs defeated 
last week, 30-26. And the Tigers earned the victory with the help of three 
missed extra points by the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, Luginbill says, is that the less threatening the opponent, the 
less inspired his team has played. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time we handily beat a team we're supposed to beat," Luginbill said. 
"This group just plays to the level of the competition." 
</P>
<P>
Overcoming this tendency, Luginbill said, has been the most frustrating task he 
has faced in his first six games as SDSU coach. Luginbill said that attitude is 
the root of most of what is wrong with his team. He considers his sterner 
approach a last effort to turn the Aztecs in the direction he has set. 
</P>
<P>
"If this doesn't work, we are in serious trouble until I can (recruit) 25 more 
athletes into this program to go along with the 25 we brought in this year," 
Luginbill said. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill is frustrated with his inability to turn the Aztecs around quickly. 
Yet for all of his disappointments, there are signs of improvement. 
</P>
<P>
By almost every statistical measure, the Aztecs are a better team than they 
were last year. The record is improved, the offense is scoring more points and 
the defense is allowing fewer. Outside of a 52-36 opening-game loss at Air 
Force, they have avoided the kind of lopsided defeats that hastened the end of 
Denny Stolz's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the credit for the improvement should go to junior quarterback Dan 
McGwire, freshman running back Darrin Wagner and senior wide receiver Robert 
Claiborne. All three redshirted last year. This year, they are causing trouble 
for the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire has 2,082 passing yards and is on pace to break the school season 
record of 3,932 yards set by Todd Santos in 1987. Wagner is second on the team 
in rushing yards (424) and leads in touchdowns (10) despite being suspended 
from last week's game against Long Beach for disciplinary reasons. And 
Claiborne is second on the team in receptions with 31 for 532 yards and three 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"Never in my wildest dreams would I figure we would be averaging 500-plus yards 
offensively," Luginbill said."And the scary part is we can get much better." 
</P>
<P>
But while the improvement on offense has been dramatic, the defense continues 
to struggle. It did not benefit from the same kind of infusion of ready-to-play 
talent. The new player who was expected to help the most, cornerback Marlon 
Andrews, has been slowed by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The defense continues to have problems stopping teams late. Only once -- 
against Air Force in a game in which the Falcons did not need to score -- has 
an opponent failed to score in the final 2:39. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA beat the Aztecs, 28-25, with a touchdown with 2:39 remaining. Fullerton 
tied them, 41-41, the next week with a field goal on the last play. Hawaii 
defeated them, 31-24, two weeks later on a touchdown with 29 seconds left. Utah 
and Long Beach also scored touchdowns in the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like that," Luginbill said. "Our defense has got to understand that 
whether we are up or down, that shouldn't happen. " 
</P>
<P>
But there is some reason for optimism. The Aztecs' three losses have been by an 
average of 8.7 points, compared with an average of 25 points in the five losses 
in their first six games last year. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as effort and playing hard, we have improved drastically in our 
defense," Luginbill said. "You look at our last three ballgames -- Utah, Hawaii 
and Long Beach -- and our defense has kept us in the football game until the 
offense got going." 
</P>
<P>
But statistics without context can be misleading. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs have faced a much softer schedule this year. Last year's first six 
opponents had a combined record of 13-2 when they played the Aztecs. This year, 
opponents are 9-12 at the time they played the Aztecs and only one team, Hawaii 
(4-1 two weeks ago), had a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
There have been other areas of concern. 
</P>
<P>
Special teams have disappointed Luginbill, especially because he said they 
would be a priority. 
</P>
<P>
The field goal kicking of freshman Andy Trakas has been inconsistent. Trakas 
missed six of his first 10 attempts before making his last three against Long 
Beach last week, including a career-best 49-yarder. Kickoff coverage has been 
spotty. Long snapping has had problems. A bad snap against Long Beach prevented 
the Aztecs from getting a punt off deep in their own territory and another 
against Hawaii cost them an extra point. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said he will put his secondary on the kickoff coverage team tonight 
in hopes of improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"We're making it a challenge to them," Luginbill said. "We've worked hard, but 
we have to work harder." 
</P>
<P>
That philosophy is a big part of Luginbill's coaching style. He has exacting 
requirements and demanding practices. That has not suited everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Since he took over as coach last November, 21 scholarship players have left the 
team. Most quit, one had a career-ending injury, and others were removed by 
Luginbill for disciplinary or academic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the players who left were expected to see little playing time. 
Luginbill does not mourn their departure. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have to start all over again, so be it," Luginbill said. "If we don't 
have the type of football players who care about their teammates, who care 
about being the best they can possibly be, then I don't think we can win 
football games." 
</P>
<P>
While Luginbill, 42, tries to instill in the Aztecs a winner's personality, his 
own game-day style has been evident. 
</P>
<P>
He waves his arms. He shouts. He greets players on the bench. Once, at Utah, he 
was slapped with an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after walking on the field 
to argue an official's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't try to be a circus out there," Luginbill said. "I am an enthusiastic 
guy. I do the same thing in practice. I get after our guys in a positive way. I 
have always been that way. That's the only way I know how to coach. I'm not 
(Brigham Young's) LaVell Edwards. I'm not going to stand there with my arms 
folded. That's not me. That never will be me." 
</P>
<P>
Also, he has developed a reputation as a gambler. If it is fourth-and-short, 
expect Luginbill to go for the first down, no matter the field position, the 
score, or the time remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Results have been mixed. Some of his gambles have worked, such as a fake punt 
that went for a touchdown against UCLA. Others have failed, leaving opponents 
with good field position. Regardless, Luginbill says he will continue to take 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
But he said his plans for improvement hinge on inspiring his players to 
eliminate selfishness. 
</P>
<P>
To make his point, Luginbill cited an example from last Saturday's game against 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a player come off the field the other night who had just caught a nice 
18-yard out route," Luginbill said. "Before he goes back to the coach he is 
supposed to be with, he sits around the 50-yard line and watches the instant 
replay (on the stadium scoreboard). That is what I am talking about. If I catch 
any of them watching instant replay, they can walk off the field, through the 
gate and out the door because I'm not putting up with that. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what creates it, but I know good football teams don't have it. If 
I inherited it, then so be it. But that doesn't mean it has to stay that way. 
The way you correct it is they either do it your way or you get someone who 
does it your way. I know that sounds harsh. But that is also reality." 
</P>
<P>
Halfway through his first season, that is life for Luginbill and the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State tight end Mitch Burton (lower abdominal strain) will be 
available but likely will not play, Coach Al Luginbill said. Freshman 
linebacker Eric Thompson, who made his first start last week against Cal State 
Long Beach, should play despite a bruised shoulder. . . . Holiday Bowl 
officials will scout six teams today. The bowl will look at Washington State 
(6-1), Arizona (4-2), Michigan State (2-3), Illinois (4-1), Ohio State (3-2) 
and West Virginia (4-1-1).

O.C. QUAKE PLAN MONEY MOSTLY UNSPENT

<P>
The Board of Supervisors in 1987 adopted a $3-million plan to improve Orange 
County's "woefully inadequate" earthquake preparedness, but most of the money 
was never spent. On Friday, two supervisors charged that county administrators 
had failed to comply with a direct order. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the earthquake Tuesday in Northern California, Board Chairman 
Thomas F. Riley and Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said, they have learned that 
the emergency plan they approved and had assumed was in place had actually -- 
for the most part -- been shelved. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, they said, they are concerned about the county's ability to 
respond to such an emergency, and they said they will examine the emergency 
plan again with an eye to its funding. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you take an action, you assume that action is going to be taken unless 
somebody comes in and says there has been a change," Riley said. "I assumed 
everything was being done." 
</P>
<P>
The complaints were directed mainly at County Administrative Officer Larry 
Parrish, but Riley said the board shares some of the blame. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish said Friday that the county was in a budget crunch in 1987 and that he 
assumed -- despite the board's voting 4 to 0 for the plan -- that the 
supervisors understood that the county could not afford to spend the $3 million 
on earthquake preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
The plan approved that February directed county agencies to absorb the 
$3-million cost in their normal operating budgets. If the agencies could not, 
Parrish was to return to the board during the July budget hearings. Parrish 
said the cost was not absorbed, adding, however, that he did not raise the 
issue at the budget hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it might have been presumptuous on Larry's part to think that" the 
board did not want to reconsider the earthquake plan, Wieder said Friday. 
"That's an assumption on Larry's part that was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to come back to this," she added. "We're fortunate that no 
(earthquake) has happened." 
</P>
<P>
The board's 1987 decision was in response to a study concluding that the 
county's emergency "preparations are woefully inadequate to cope with the 
damage and casualties from a catastrophic earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
The report was prepared by the Southern California Earthquake Preparedness 
Project, a committee of top county officials. It contained 39 recommendations 
for improvements whose cost was estimated at $12 million, according to county 
officials. In February, 1987, the board voted to spend $3 million on the "first 
phase" of implementing the report's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
About half the $3 million was to go for emergency equipment -- such as electric 
generators and lights -- for key government buildings, which the county does 
not have. Another $125,000 was to go for chain saws that could cut through 
steel and concrete, and for portable generators, sandbags and air filtration 
masks. 
</P>
<P>
Another recommendation called for a study of the ways in which a major 
earthquake would affect important highways, bridges, airports, railroads, and 
sanitation and utility stations. The report suggested that the county either 
fortify those facilities found to be vulnerable or identify alternatives to 
those facilities 
</P>
<P>
James W. Williams, director of the county Environmental Management Agency 
public works design division, said his office was responsible for implementing 
that recommendation but that he has been unable to follow through on it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're waiting for funding," he said. "It may be we're responsible, but we 
don't have any funding." 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors, however, had voted to spend $140,000 for that particular study 
in their 1987 decision. 
</P>
<P>
One of the recommendations that the county did implement was to do a survey of 
the structural integrity of all of the government's buildings. The survey, 
which cost $220,000, was required by state law, and it is included in a study 
to be released soon. 
</P>
<P>
This survey identifies possibly catastrophic problems that could occur in a 
major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
It says that five Orange County fire stations probably would not survive a 
serious earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
It also concludes that the county's emergency communications center on The City 
Drive in Orange is on ground likely to liquefy in a major earthquake. County 
officials plan to move the communications center by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The communications center is the central radio link among all agencies during 
emergencies. Should it fail, rescue response and coordination would be 
"extremely difficult," said Marcia Thompson, chief of support services in the 
General Services Agency communications division. Hugh Wood, head of the county 
Fire Department Emergency Management Division, says that the county is better 
prepared now for an earthquake than it was in 1986, but, he said, "we're 
talking in degrees." 
</P>
<P>
"Could we be more prepared? Yes. (But) it's as much preparation as we can 
afford," he said. "Obviously, you're always vulnerable; you're never without 
risk." 
</P>
<P>
Although the preparedness plan was to be coordinated by the Emergency 
Management Division, Wood, the division chief, could not identify which of the 
39 recommendations had been implemented and which had not. He said that it was 
up to individual departments to follow through on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"That may or may not have happened," he said. "We're not going out and making 
sure they've done it. We can't do their job. I can't say they have or have not 
put those things in effect. I just don't have that kind of certainty." 
</P>
<P>
Christine Boyd, a county disaster response planner who handles earthquake 
preparedness for Wood, also said that each county department is responsible for 
its own part in implementing the preparedness-report recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in some of those county departments, however, referred questions back 
to Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd also said that the county is better prepared to respond to an earthquake 
than in 1986. 
</P>

"Drilling is one of the most important things a county can do, and this county 
drills," she said. "There are a lot of little fronts that we're advancing on 
that add up to a far-improved picture of disaster preparedness than the one we 
had in 1986." 
</P>
<P>
In not funding the preparedness plan's recommendations, Parrish stressed that 
the county had to balance its limited resources against other more immediate 
needs, such as health care for the poor, new roads and jails. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not critical of any elements of this (earthquake preparedness) plan," said 
Parrish, who recently resigned from his position and is scheduled to leave the 
county next month. "But what we continue to have to do is balance known needs 
and known obligations against that sort of defensive measure. 
</P>
<P>
"If you think I'm going to say that if we get that earthquake that we are as 
ready as we'll ever be, I won't say that," he said. "If a week from today we 
were in the situation that the people in Santa Cruz are in tonight, there would 
be a lot of criticism that we hadn't spent it." 
</P>
<P>
The minutes of the 1987 supervisors' meeting on the earthquake plan show that 
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton urged that it be implemented despite the county's 
budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
"(Former) Chairman Stanton noted that although agencies/departments have 
limited resources, the county must continue its efforts in this area," the 
minutes read. Stanton was not available for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But Parrish said he met with the supervisors informally before the July budget 
hearings and "assumed" that the supervisors were aware that the earthquake plan 
would not be funded because of the county's difficult financial situation. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have any money," he said. "They knew we didn't have enough money."

Twenty-eight percent of British Muslims support Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's 
death sentence on writer Salman Rushdie, accused of blaspheming Islam, 
according to a Harris poll released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A big majority favor some form of personal action against Rushdie for writing 
"The Satanic Verses," and nearly two-thirds want his novel publicly burned. 
</P>
<P>
Home Office Minister John Patten described as "appalling" the apparent support 
for the death threat against Rushdie, who is still in hiding and under police 
protection. The death threat was issued in February by Iranian leader Khomeini, 
who died in June.

RIGHT LOOKS WIN VOTES, STUDY SHOWS

<P>
Americans choose their elected leaders, in part, the same way they buy 
vegetables -- by appearance. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine political science professor Shawn W. Rosenberg, who asked hundreds of 
subjects in the past year to rate -- using only photographs -- real and phony 
politicians on such characteristics as competence, trustworthiness, leadership 
ability and political demeanor, found that the best-looking, best-dressed 
candidates got much higher marks. 
</P>
<P>
By manipulating appearances -- changing hair styles, clothing and makeup -- of 
six test candidates, Rosenberg found that he could push positive ratings up or 
down 20 
</P>
<P>
percentage points. In a real election, the right looks could add 5% to 8% to a 
candidate's vote total, enough to swing a close race, concluded Rosenberg and 
his research partner, Boston University economics professor Shulamit Kahn. 
</P>
<P>
The manipulation study revealed that smiling, conservatively dressed 
politicians project a positive image. Rosenberg also uncovered a few quirks 
that he is at a loss to explain, such as a strong preference for one eye shape: 
a rounded upper eyelid with a straight lower lid, in contrast with eyes that do 
not curve on top or that curve equally on top and bottom. 
</P>
<P>
And while baldness is bad politically, a widow's peak hairline is regarded as a 
sign of competence, the study showed. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg, who calls himself a political psychologist, set out to explore how 
Americans make sense of politics. He found that for most people, politics does 
not make sense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Surprised 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disturbed, yes, but surprised? No," Rosenberg said. "The amount of 
attention we pay to politicians is really minimal, even during an election 
period, and the overall understanding of issues is quite rudimentary. As a 
result, we rely on often-superficial cues or pieces of information to direct 
our judgment of candidates and events. 
</P>
<P>
"What people are doing is saying, 'I don't really understand politics, so let 
me look at this person and decide if this person is trustworthy and competent.' 
But how you look is not necessarily who you are, because that can be 
manipulated so readily." 
</P>
<P>
The study focusing on manipulation of features and dress is the latest in a 
series of candidate-preference works by Rosenberg since 1984. It is expected to 
be published next year in the scholarly journal Political Psychology. 
</P>
<P>
The appearance studies have drawn attention -- and mixed reviews -- from 
politicians and the strategists who often play a role in shaping the 
candidates' public images. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we haven't spent a lot of taxpayer money on these surveys," said 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who acted as a consultant in Christian F. 
(Rick) Thierbach's unsuccessful Assembly race against Republican Curt Pringle 
of Garden Grove last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Study Discounted 
</P>
<P>
Katz discounted the study, in part, because the mock candidates used by 
Rosenberg were unknown and presented without the context of a normal political 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Appearance plays a role in political success, just as dressing appropriately 
for a job interview can help determine who gets a position, Katz agreed. And 
although he said that Thierbach's strait-laced demeanor and perceived 
standoffishness hurt the campaign, he said that issues and party affiliation, 
particularly in Orange County, have more to do with winning votes than looks. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to take (appearance) into account, but you can't let it be the 
determining factor," Katz said. "There is some truth to the notion that people 
get impressions based on how you hold your head, your body language, your 
dress. But I believe voters pay attention to the message. 
</P>
<P>
"I tend to give voters a lot of credit," Katz said, noting the myriad ballot 
measures that voters waded through last fall to overwhelmingly select one 
insurance reform measure over several others. 
</P>
<P>
"People who live in ivory towers don't understand voters." 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), who was host for a cable TV talk 
show for seven years before entering politics, said good looks and professional 
attire are keys to political success. 
</P>
<P>
"All things being equal, the candidate with the neatly combed or well-coiffed 
hair, the conservative dress and the professional demeanor will get elected," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peculiar Dress 
</P>
<P>
"Some congressmen get away with wearing some peculiar forms of dress -- you 
look at them and think, 'Maybe it was the issues there, maybe he's a good old 
boy who fits his district.' " 
</P>
<P>
Cowboy boots and avant-garde clothes would not go over well in Orange County or 
before national TV audiences, Dornan said: "I do so much television that I 
dress so I'm always ready. I wear dark suits, rep ties and light-blue Oxford 
shirts. It's almost a uniform for me. The public expects people who handle 
money -- people who are bankers, accountants, lawyers and elected officials -- 
to dress in a way that conveys trust." 
</P>
<P>
Dornan, who often wears a beard when not on the campaign stump, said he has had 
the "fortitude" to sport whiskers just once -- in 1986 -- while running for 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Englander, a Newport Beach political consultant who has directed 
campaigns for both Democrats and Republicans during a 21-year career, said he 
has used Rosenberg's findings and common sense to make over some of his 
candidates to enhance their election chances. But he does not consider such 
packaging a manipulation of voters. 
</P>
<P>
"I've changed a candidate's hair style, glasses and gone shopping with the 
candidate for new suits and ties," he said. "My clients have a message to 
impart, and we want to create an atmosphere where that message is heard. I 
don't think the public will follow the message if they don't feel comfortable 
with the messenger." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Too Good-Looking 
</P>
<P>
Light-colored shirts and dark suits work well for TV but may not appeal to less 
formal voters in a rural district, Englander said. He also believes that 
candidates cannot be too good-looking. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard that the average elected legislator is more attractive than the 
average person," he said. "I don't know if that's true. But I do know voters 
don't go for people who are too slick -- a George Hamilton look is not good for 
a candidate. There are no absolutes." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg, who has turned down offers to act as a paid image consultant to 
political candidates (whom he declines to name), said the emergence of TV has 
forever changed the face of politics. 
</P>
<P>
Appearances have always played a role, but since the Kennedy-Nixon debate in 
1960, looks have been highlighted. Sen. John F. Kennedy, who wore a dark suit 
and used theatrical makeup, was a dramatic visual contrast to his presidential 
campaign foe, Vice President Richard M. Nixon, who refused makeup to cover his 
5 o'clock shadow, perspired profusely and looked gaunt and pale in a 
light-colored suit. 
</P>
<P>
"Before television, the key to election was manipulating the political party 
structure," Rosenberg said. "What you knew and who you knew and family 
connections were also important. With the advent of television politics, the 
content of what you have to say is much less important. The party machinery is 
less important. 
</P>
<P>
"Visual impressions and image are far more important." 
</P>
<P>
To find out whether a candidate's appearance projects an image of fitness for 
office and to what extent image affects voter preference, Rosenberg drew on 
family connections in the California film industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use of Makeup Artist 
</P>
<P>
"We used a makeup artist and a studio photographer," he said. "We found out we 
could manipulate most of the things we're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Using six women, ages 19 to 65, Rosenberg rearranged hair, dress and background 
settings. Makeup made broad faces appear narrower, long faces broader and 
changed hairlines to add a widow's peak or blur a natural peaked hairline. 
</P>
<P>
Positive and negative photographs of the six candidates were then presented in 
phony campaign flyers as Republican and Democratic party nominees. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of party affiliation or issue positions, the candidates who rated 
highest on 29 appearance characteristics also consistently won the highest 
voter ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Photographs of male candidates, including dozens of real congressmen and 
senators, were rated in a previous study, with similar results. Mature age -- 
perhaps associated with wisdom by voters -- was a plus for both men and women. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his findings, Rosenberg would not advise a radical make-over or 
cosmetic surgery for political hopefuls. If the only object is winning, U.S. 
political life is diminished, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had plenty of successful politicians who would not conform to my notions 
of the best-looking," he said. Senate Majority Whip Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) 
has overcome the potential negatives of his bald pate and thin build, Rosenberg 
said, and Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) has turned his unfashionable bow ties into a 
trademark. 
</P>
<P>
"Political skills and ideas still count for a lot," Rosenberg said. "And half 
of the game is just getting to the point where the voting population can assess 
you. First you have to be a party nominee." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TURNING THE BEST POLITICAL CHEEK 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine political science professor Shawn W. Rosenberg found that by changing 
hair styles, clothing and makeup of test candidates in certain ways, it was 
possible to affect ratings by 20 percentage points. In a real election, 
Rosenberg contends, the right looks could add 5% to '% to a candidate's vote 
total, enough to swing a close race.

ANAHEIM GETS ITS ARENA SITE; 
</P>
<P>
CITY GOVERNMENT: THE MAYOR SAYS THE SPORTS FACILITY COULD BE BUILT IN TIME FOR 
THE 1991 NBA SEASON, KEEPING PACE WITH SANTA ANA IN THE RACE FOR A PROFESSIONAL 
BASKETBALL OR HOCKEY FRANCHISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The city of Anaheim Friday approved the purchase of a seven-acre site near 
Anaheim Stadium for its proposed $85-million indoor sports arena that Mayor 
Fred Hunter said could be built in time for the 1991 professional basketball 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, involving a complicated three-way land swap, appears to have 
pulled Anaheim at least even with -- and perhaps ahead of -- nearby Santa Ana 
in the race to build an indoor arena, which is needed if either city hopes to 
attract a professional hockey or basketball franchise. 
</P>
<P>
"This afternoon is the beginning of the Anaheim Arena," Mayor Fred Hunter said. 
"We're going to try to begin construction -- tell Santa Ana -- about the middle 
of January." 
</P>
<P>
With Friday's agreement, Anaheim and Santa Ana each appear to have suitable 
land for their proposed, nearly identical 20,000-seat arenas. 
</P>
<P>
Construction cannot begin on either the Anaheim or Santa Ana arenas until 
environmental impact reports are compiled. Officials in both cities estimate 
that the reports could be ready for public review by January. 
</P>
<P>
However, neither city's project has attracted a professional hockey or 
basketball franchise, which some observers see as essential if either arena is 
to be profitable. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim land swap approved Friday involves the city's purchase of a 
14.5-acre vacant parcel for $5.9 million from the private firm of Sanderson, 
J.-Ray Development of Irvine. The city in turn agrees to sell a different 
14.5-acre vacant parcel for $3 million to the same company. 
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you, the city's getting a good deal (and) the developers are not 
walking away with any gift-wrapped package," said Al McCord, the city's 
economic development manager. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and company spokesmen said the $3-million parcel sold to 
Sanderson, J.-Ray Development requires costly improvements before it can be 
developed, making it of comparable value to the $5.9-million site. However, 
more than seven acres of the $5.9-million site is under high-voltage power 
lines, limiting its development, Assistant City Manager James Ruth conceded. 
</P>
<P>
The $3-million parcel "requires an immense amount of engineering work," said 
James (Walky) Ray, one of the partners of Sanderson, J.-Ray Development. "I 
think it's a good deal for the city as well as us, and for the Phoenix Club." 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson, J.-Ray Development last May contributed $1,000 to Hunter's campaign 
war chest, which Hunter said Friday is at least $40,000 in debt. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Ray, a partner in the firm, also made a $100 campaign contribution to 
Councilman Thomas Daly in September, 1988, according to city records. Ray also 
is a director of the Democratic Foundation, whose political action committee 
gave Daly $1,000 and Councilman Irv Pickler $500 in October, 1988, the records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they've given us all about $1,000," said Councilman William D. Ehrle, 
who said he, too, has received contributions from the firm or its principals. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Foundation Chairman John Hanna said the organization contributed 
relatively large sums to Daly and Pickler because they are Democrats in a city 
where campaigning is expensive. He said it was not Michael Ray's idea to make 
the contributions. 
</P>
<P>
There is no state law prohibiting city council members from voting on matters 
concerning campaign contributors, a spokesman for the state Fair Political 
Practices Commission said. 
</P>
<P>
Ehrle, Hunter and Pickler said the contributions had no effect on their votes. 
Daly was out of town Friday and did not vote on the land swap, which passed 4 
to 0. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Ray was vacationing out of state and could not be reached for comment. 
His brother, James, and their partner, Chase Sanderson, said Friday that their 
firm's $1,000 contribution to Hunter was made because "he's a great mayor." 
They said they are sure the contribution did not affect Hunter's vote. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim's actions Friday were hailed by council members. "It's a major 
milestone," Ehrle said. "The only thing we're waiting on is the environmental 
impact report, which is due in December. We have one or two public hearings on 
that and boom! we're in the ground. We're not concerned about Santa Ana." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim's land purchases will be financed by a sale of bonds, which will be 
underwritten by an increase in the city's bed tax on motels and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
"This tax falls upon the visitors to our city and not upon Anaheim residents 
and taxpayers," Ruth said. "Therefore, the arena land acquisition will be of no 
cost to Anaheim residents and businesses." 
</P>
<P>
Although Anaheim had been working on its arena plans for months before Santa 
Ana entered the race earlier this year, Santa Ana appeared to have an advantage 
because it did not need to acquire land for its facility. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, Santa Ana's $70-million arena would be privately owned and 
operated and built on 17 acres of vacant private land at Edinger Avenue and 
Lyon Street. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim paved the way Friday for its city-owned arena on city land by approving 
the $8-million purchase of 7.6 acres of industrially zoned land on Douglass 
Street near Katella Avenue from the Phoenix Club, a German-American social 
group. The Anaheim arena would be operated under a lease agreement with private 
firms, with the operators and city splitting profits. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase of the Phoenix property hinged on the two related land deals. 
</P>
<P>
The city agreed to pay $5.9 million to Sanderson, J.-Ray Development for the 
14.5 acres zoned for industrial use near Ball Road and the Orange Freeway. In 
turn, the city will sell about 8.5 acres of that property to the Phoenix Club 
for $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The club, which has 3,500 family memberships representing about 10,000 persons, 
plans to build a new, 25,000-square-foot meeting facility at the Ball Road 
location. 
</P>
<P>
As a condition of buying Sanderson, J.-Ray Development's Ball Road property for 
$5.9 million, the city agreed to sell the firm the 14.5 acres of vacant, 
commercially zoned property at Weir Canyon Road and La Palma Avenue for $3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The less-expensive Weir Canyon Road property is "not at street grade" and 
requires expensive improvements before it can be developed, city and company 
spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
After considering the costs of such improvements, the two parcels "become 
almost equal" in value, the city's McCord said. "There's a lot of property 
improvement that has to be done. It is not exactly prime commercial" property. 
</P>
<P>
When he learned of Anaheim's land deals, Santa Ana Mayor Dan Young said: "We've 
had our land deal arranged from day one. 
</P>
<P>
"Both sides are probably going to be making substantial progress over the next 
three to four months," Young said. "I'm really not sure how it's all going to 
turn out." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Anaheim's bid for an NBA basketball expansion franchise was never 
seriously considered because it had no suitable facility, an NBA spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles attorney Neal Papiano, who is handling Anaheim's negotiations 
with the NBA and NHL, said he is encouraged by Friday's land deals. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everything has fallen in place," Papiano said. "I think it's just full

FATHER HELD AS MURDER SUSPECT IN BEATING DEATH OF 3-YEAR-OLD

A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the 
beating death of his 3-year-old son, sheriff's officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that around 8:15 a.m. Thursday, Joaquin Figueroa Ayala, who is 
believed to be a Santa Ana resident, had driven his son to the Mission Viejo 
house where his wife works as a maid. 
</P>
<P>
There, Sheriff's Lt. Bob Rivas said, "he told his wife that the child was not 
feeling good." 
</P>
<P>
"She saw that something was wrong," Rivas said, "and called the paramedics 
because it appeared that the child was not breathing." 
</P>
<P>
The boy was taken to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, 
where he was pronounced dead at 8:51 a.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary findings from an autopsy completed Friday indicate that the child, 
whom coroner's officials identified as Francisco Trujillo, died from 
blunt-force trauma to the head and body, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala was arrested shortly before 9 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's investigators could not confirm where the alleged beating would have 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Rivas said that investigators had determined from an interview with Ayala in 
the hospital that Francisco had been with his father before arriving at the 
house in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala is being held in Orange County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's death comes at a time when reports of child abuse in Orange County 
have reached an all-time high. According to data compiled by the Orange County 
Child Abuse Registry, reported cases of abuse for a one-year period ending in 
July rose 8% over the previous 12-month period, and they were nearly 25% higher 
than they were for the year before that.

FOG SLOWS 9,400-ACRE BLAZE; 
</P>
<P>
THREE-COUNTY FIRE 60% CONTAINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A thick layer of fog rolled to the aid of firefighters Friday, helping them get 
an upper hand on a blaze that has ravaged 9,400 acres of brushland in Orange, 
San Diego and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
By nightfall, firefighters had contained 60% of the blaze. Full containment was 
not expected until early Monday, a fire official said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was real slow this morning," U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Delores 
Fremter said of the fire. "The fog came in and it didn't do much. The wind 
kicked in about noon and the fog lifted and it started to be more active." 
</P>
<P>
Until Friday, the fire had burned largely unchecked. It was accidently started 
Wednesday during a military exercise at the Camp Pendleton Marine base in San 
Diego County. It raced through the remote canyons and hills of southern Orange 
County before turning northeast and heading into Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
While belching smoke and ash that has dusted cars and homes in much of Orange 
County, the fire had not destroyed any structures. The Riverside County town of 
Rancho Carrillo was briefly threatened Thursday, but the fire stayed away and 
more than 50 fire engines pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
Bulldozers cut a mile-long, 35-foot-wide fire break around the village Friday, 
which some residents said they had sought for years. 
</P>
<P>
While the fog turned the flames to smoldering embers, it also grounded six air 
tankers and four water-dropping helicopters until mid-morning. They were needed 
to assist the more than 1,000 firefighters manning the lines. 
</P>
<P>
Fremter said that despite quelling the fire on its southern and western flanks, 
it was driving northeast into the inaccessible San Mateo Canyon Wilderness of 
Cleveland National Forest. Late Friday it was headed toward the remote 
Fisherman's Camp area.

PLAN WOULD COUNT ILLEGALS IN '90 CENSUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The director of the county Social Services Agency wants all Orange County 
residents, including illegal aliens, to be counted in the 1990 Census, and he 
will ask the Board of Supervisors to support his position. 
</P>
<P>
A resolution doing just that will be introduced at the supervisors' meeting 
Tuesday. Agency officials said that if illegal aliens were to be excluded from 
the count, it would mean that, on paper, the county had 200,000 fewer residents 
than the county's actual population. That lower figure would result in the loss 
of an estimated $56 million a year in federal revenue, they said. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the supervisors, Larry Leaman, director of the agency, urged the 
board to adopt the resolution supporting a complete count of all county 
residents and opposing "all attempts to systematically exclude any groups from 
the census." 
</P>
<P>
Such exclusions, the letter said, could result in the county losing 
representatives in Congress because districts are determined by population. 
</P>
<P>
Just Thursday, efforts to include illegal aliens in the Census received a major 
boost when negotiators from the U.S. Senate and House agreed on the issue. 
Before Thursday's action, the Senate had voted to bar the Census Bureau from 
counting illegal aliens, although the House had twice rejected efforts to 
exclude aliens. The agreement worked out Thursday at the House-Senate 
conference will go back to each body before it is sent to President Bush, but 
it is considered likely to be approved. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials contend that much is at stake in whether aliens are 
included in the count. In 1985, before the Federal Immigration Reform Act, the 
number of illegal aliens in the county was estimated at 300,000. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, home to 44.5% of the county's Latinos, city officials worried 
about the ramifications of undercounting its residents. They figured that in 
the 1980 Census, the city was shortchanged by at least 50,000 people. If those 
residents had been included, it could have meant another $2.2 million in state 
and federal revenue, according to city officials. GEORGE FRANK

Posters must be submitted on 12-by-18 white drawing paper, and must be drawn 
vertically on the page. Pencil, chalk, charcoal, paint or any medium may be 
used. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
The contest is sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce Education Committee. Prizes 
include a $100 U.S. Savings Bond for first place and eight $50 savings bonds 
for second-place finishers. Entries will be displayed in March, during the

FORUM TO GIVE DATA ON CITYHOOD'S EFFECT

<TEXT>
<P>
Information about how cityhood would affect this community will be given Sunday 
night at a forum held in the gymnasium at the Crown Valley Regional Park on 
Crown Valley Parkway. The forum will start at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The event is free and open to the public. The sponsor is Citizens for Cityhood, 
an organization that supports incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Laguna Niguel will vote on cityhood in the Nov. 7 election. They 
will also vote for candidates for a five-member City Council that would assume 
office if cityhood receives a majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
"This session on Sunday will have information from the new feasibility study," 
said Denny Harris, a member of the executive committee of Citizens for 
Cityhood. He was referring to a newly released professional study of how Laguna 
Niguel would fare financially if it became Orange County's 29th city. The 
study's overall conclusion is that the community would operate very comfortably 
in the black, with a hefty surplus. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said all 23 candidates for the Laguna Niguel City Council have been 
invited to the Sunday forum. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the candidates would answer questions and explain their positions 
on various issues. BILL BILLITER

WORKERS BURNED IN POWER LINE ACCIDENT

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Firefighters rescued two workers who were injured by a jolt of electricity from 
a power line while working on the roof of a one-story Buena Park building 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The workers were painting on the roof of the KDI Composite Technology building 
in the 6000 block of 8th Street when an extension pole they were holding struck 
the 440-volt incoming power line, a Buena Park fire spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"The surge (of current) through the pole burned the palms of their hands and 
their fingers and knocked at least one of them to the ground," said Buena Park 
Battalion Chief Donald Tully. 
</P>
<P>
Norberto Angiano, 35, and Miguel Contraras, 38, suffered second- and 
third-degree burns on their hands, Tully said. Contraras also suffered burns on 
his side and abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
KDI employees who heard the men's screams for help called the Buena Park Fire 
Department about 9.30 a.m. Firefighters used an aerial platform and a hydraulic 
basket to lower the injured men from the roof. The men were then taken to the 
UCI Medical Center burn unit. Tully described their condition as satisfactory.

JEWELRY BANDITS GO TO EXTREMES IN LOOT

<TEXT>
<P>
For detectives in La Habra and Newport Beach trying to sort out two jewelry 
heists Friday, it was a study in extremes. 
</P>
<P>
Only hours after a posh Newport Beach jewelry store was robbed of $2-million 
worth of merchandise Thursday, bandits struck at a Bullock's La Habra jewelry 
counter and got away with only a $200 watch, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the bandits used hammers to try to smash a Bullock's display case that 
wouldn't break -- it was made of break-resistant plastic. And when they opened 
the display case, all the jewelry automatically fell into a lower vault 
compartment out of their reach. The theft protections left the holdup men with 
only the watch, which failed to drop with the rest of the items. 
</P>
<P>
The four were gone within minutes of their entry into Bullock's and never 
confronted any employees. One store worker who saw them trying to smash the 
display case ducked out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
In the Newport Beach incident, detectives were looking for a gold-colored Ford 
Taurus and a maroon Mercedes-Benz that were used as the getaway cars by four 
bandits after they abandoned a gray Buick in a parking lot shortly after the 
robbery at Carol Klein Fine Jewelry in Newport Center. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the men burst through a locked door shortly after 10 a.m., put the 
entire contents of the closet-sized safe into a plastic trash can and tied up 
the lone employee and customer before escaping. CHRIS WOODYARD

ALUMNI PUT THEIR MARK ON HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Huntington Beach High School activities director Darrell Stillwagon was 
hired as a teacher in July, 1963, he had a little trouble finding his new 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I drove right by the school," Stillwagon said. "I thought it was a church or a 
monastery, it was so beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
But, as school Principal Gary Ernst said, "there's nothing in front that tells 
anybody the name of the school, or even that it is a school." 
</P>
<P>
All that changed Friday with the unveiling of a 4-by-4-foot granite marker in 
front of the campus. The sign, visible to Main Street motorists, reads: 
"Huntington Beach High School -- Home of the Oilers." 
</P>
<P>
The marker was made possible by a group of septuagenarian and octogenarian 
graduates from the 1920s. About 50 members of the group, which calls itself the 
Roaring '20s, attended Friday morning's unveiling with about 350 current 
students. 
</P>
<P>
The former students feel strongly attached to the school and wanted to do 
something for it, said Harl Crockett of the class of '27. 
</P>
<P>
The Roaring '20s raised $2,500 for the sign after getting the idea last year to 
show the school's identity to people passing by it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got our marker out there -- instead of at Forest Lawn," said Crockett, 
81, chairman of the alumni organization. 
</P>
<P>
The group has been returning to the campus for homecoming the last four years. 
But Friday's marker installation may be the last hurrah for the aging group of 
graduates. 
</P>
<P>
It's getting difficult to bring the Roaring '20s group back each year, Crockett 
said, because some live as far away as Florida. 
</P>
<P>
After the alumni group raised the money for the sign, the current students 
chipped in $2,000 to have it installed, Ernst said. The sign will be lighted at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Besides listing the school's name, the sign notes that it was donated by the 
Roaring '20s. 
</P>
<P>
Having the school's name on a granite marker will help extend the pride the 
2,200 students feel for the school, Ernst said. Because the sign notes that it 
was donated by the Roaring '20s, it also helps link the school to its past. 
</P>
<P>
"I have students here that are fifth-generation students," Ernst said. "I've 
got teachers who graduated from the school and whose parents graduated from the 
school."

AISSA WAYNE'S EX-MATE CAN'T GET FAIR TRIAL IN COUNTY, LAWYER SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: SURGEON ACCUSED OF ARRANGING ATTACK ON JOHN WAYNE'S DAUGHTER SEEKS 
CHANGE OF VENUE.

A surgeon accused of arranging a two-man attack on his ex-wife cannot possibly 
receive a fair trial in Orange County because the legend of the victim's film 
star father, John Wayne, has won her widespread sympathy, his lawyer argued 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Insisting that Dr. Thomas Gionis doesn't stand a chance in "John Wayne 
country," attorney Catherine A. Vincent asked Superior Court Judge Leonard H. 
McBride to move the the assault trial to another county. McBride said he would 
hear more arguments on the request next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis, 35, of Pomona faces trial Oct. 31 on charges that he paid private 
detective O. Daniel Gal, 32, of Beverly Hills to assault Aissa Wayne and her 
financier boyfriend, Roger Luby. Gionis and Wayne were embroiled in a bitter 
custody dispute over their young daughter at the time. Gal, prosecutors allege, 
sent Jerrel Lee Hintergardt, 37, of Burbank and Jeffrey Bouey, 35, of Simi 
Valley to do the job. Gal and Bouey are cooperating with prosecutors. 
Hintergardt faces trial with Gionis. 
</P>
<P>
The court hearing Friday involved a clash of public-opinion experts who sharply 
disagreed over the validity of a defense-commissioned survey showing that 40% 
of Orange County residents believe that Gionis was responsible for the attack. 
The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher Evans, opposed the motion. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent also said Friday that she intends to seek a court order forcing the 
Newport Beach police to turn over information that allegedly indicates Luby had 
narcotics connections. She said she hopes to raise the possibility that the 
attack might have been a "drug-related hit" on Luby. 
</P>
<P>
But Newport Beach Police Sgt. Richard Long, who is heading the investigation 
into the attack, said the inquiry has not uncovered any evidence of narcotics 
activity by Luby. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing for a change of venue, Vincent contended in court papers that there is 
"only very weak circumstantial evidence that might possibly link" Gionis to the 
Oct. 3, 1988, attack at Luby's gated, Newport Beach home. 
</P>
<P>
But nonetheless, Vincent argued, Orange County residents are hopelessly biased 
against Gionis because the news media, fueled by prejudicial statements by the 
prosecutor and judges on the case, have gone "literally crazy" with the story. 
</P>
<P>
"This has literally been a real-life soap opera and the interest of Orange 
County readers has intentionally been kept at a peak by the press with active 
and abusive dissemination of prejudicial evidence via the district attorney and 
the local judiciary," Vincent charged in court papers. 
</P>
<P>
Local people are also biased against Gionis, Vincent said, because they are 
surrounded with reminders of the "Wayne mystique." Not only is the airport 
named after him, but it boasts a bronze statue of John Wayne, she said. The 
Sheriff's Department paid tribute to Wayne by naming two surveillance 
helicopters Duke I and Duke II. Then there's the bar at The Newporter Resort 
called Duke's, the John Wayne Tennis Club, and harbor cruises that point out 
his former yacht and home. 
</P>
<P>
To buttress her plea for a change of venue, Vincent introduced a telephone 
survey of 200 Orange County residents that was conducted by an Iowa research 
firm in June. Among its findings: 
</P>
<P>
* 40% believe that Gionis is responsible for the attack. Of those people, 52% 
said the reason they think so is because the newspapers or other media have 
said that Gionis did it. 
</P>
<P>
* 60% said they think Aissa Wayne has good reason to fear that Gionis would try 
to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
* 50% think Gionis can get a fair trial in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
* 75% had heard of the assault. Of those people, 21% had read or heard that 
Gionis committed the crime or was suspected of having committed it. 
</P>
<P>
* When asked what news event they associated with John Wayne, 44% immediately 
volunteered information about Aissa Wayne and the attack on her. 
</P>
<P>
Mara Swanson, who helped design the survey for Starr &amp; Associates of Des 
Moines, testified that the results show Gionis cannot receive a fair trial in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
To counter that claim, prosecutors put pollster Steven Teichner on the stand. 
Teichner, president of Teichner Associates Inc., said the survey is unreliable 
because it has a high margin of error -- 6.9% in either direction -- and its 
sampling methods did not produce a true cross-section of the opinions of Orange 
County residents who might qualify as jurors in the case.

It was only a month ago that BMW's top U.S. marketing executive predicted that 
new luxury cars from Toyota and Nissan would not hurt his business much for at 
least a couple of years, until they establish reputations. 
</P>
<P>
But in its first month on the market, Toyota's Lexus is already outselling BMW 
in the United States. Toyota officials said an early survey of buyers showed 
that 15% were trading in BMWs. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Flesher, BMW of North America's vice president for marketing, told 
reporters in September he expected most early buyers of Lexus and Nissan 
Infiniti cars to trade domestic luxury models, especially Cadillacs and 
Lincolns. As the new cars build images for luxury and quality, he said, more 
BMW and Mercedes-Benz owners would be tempted to switch. 
</P>
<P>
Flesher contended that it is much too soon to measure the market impact of the 
Japanese models. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need six months to see how this is going to gel," he said.

SOLAR-CAR FANS WORK ON AUTO OF FUTURE TODAY

HAMBURG, West Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the land of broad-beamed Mercedes, 12-cylinder BMWs and the high-speed 
autobahn, a small group of tinkerers and enthusiasts are working on a car of 
the future that follows a completely different line of development: 
solar-powered city cars, small and light, with battery-charged top speeds of 
around 45 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"Where we are now is one second after the birth of this idea, says Ike 
Clef-Prahm, a Hamburg advertising executive and solar-car fan. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to ask ourselves, 'What will individual transportation look like in 
the next century?' " he says. Besides the problems of pollution, noise and 
crowded streets, oil-industry projections say world petroleum reserves will run 
out by around the year 2030. 
</P>
<P>
To suggest some answers, Clef-Prahm and friends organized West Germany's first 
major road rally for solar vehicles, the Hansa Solarmobile Cup from Luebeck to 
Hamburg, inspired by Switzerland's annual Tour de Sol. 
</P>
<P>
Some 80 solar-powered cars, motorcycles and mopeds from West Germany, Denmark, 
Switzerland and the Netherlands converged on northern Germany for the 115-mile 
run in September. 
</P>
<P>
According to solar enthusiasts, the car of the future will not simply be 
electric. It must be energy efficient -- meaning light -- at best perhaps less 
than 1,000 pounds and no more than about 10 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
Solar-mobiles built in small series in Switzerland and Denmark have sleek hulls 
of strong, lightweight synthetic materials with highly energy efficient engines 
and extremely low wind resistence values. 
</P>
<P>
Solar-mobiles convert 70% of their energy input into motion, contrasted with 
20% at best and as little as 5% in the city for regular cars. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a new concept of traffic behind these autos," says Clef-Prahm. It is 
based on statistics: West German studies show that the average urban car trip 
takes one or two people some 12 miles and that drivers cover an average 25 
miles a day. 
</P>
<P>
Hence the solar city car, with one or two seats and able to carry 40 to 50% of 
its own weight, with a top speed around 45 m.p.h. and a range of 40 or 50 miles 
on a single battery charge. 
</P>
<P>
Recharging is done overnight or during workday parking from electricity 
produced by photovoltaic cells at home or at "solar stations" -- such as three 
that have been set up in the West German town of Kassel. 
</P>
<P>
The solar city mobile is for driving to the subway or commuter train station, 
shopping and running errands in town, and picking up a child or two from 
school. 
</P>
<P>
That is the vision. For now, solar-mobiles remain rare in West Germany, 
contrasted with neighboring Switzerland, where up to 300 cruise the streets, or 
Denmark, where some 1,500 Danish-produced vehicles have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
Far less than 100 solar-mobiles have been licensed for West German roads. Solar 
auto construction in the country is a field dominated by hobbyists and workshop 
tinkerers, such as Hans-Juergen Benecke, a Hamburg secondary-school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Benecke and 12 students turned a small Italian car body into a 1,000-pound 
solar auto that can do 40 m.p.h. for 45 miles. Its home power base is a set of 
solar cells on the school roof. The next project is to build five with updated 
technology for a top speed of 50 m.p.h. and range of 60 miles.

CREDIT UNIONS INCREASING THEIR MORTGAGE BUSINESS; 
</P>
<P>
LOANS: THE LARGER INSTITUTIONS ARE MOVING MORE AND MORE INTO THE BUSINESS OF 
MAKING HOME LOANS TO MEMBERS.

Mortgage lending might not come to mind when you think of credit unions, but 
these institutions, long a stronghold of low-interest-rate auto loans and other 
consumer loans, have been increasing their mortgage business in the past few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Some credit unions have been offering mortgage loans since 1978, when federally 
chartered institutions were permitted to offer 30-year mortgages. Many expanded 
and many more decided to enter the mortgage market, beginning in 1986, to take 
advantage of the red-hot housing market, according to Niel Moser, senior vice 
president of CUNA Mortgage Corp., a subsidiary of the Credit Union National 
Assn., a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
That expansion was further spurred by the fierce competition beginning in 1987 
from auto-finance companies and banks in marketing low-rate auto loans and 
other consumer loans, Moser said. The credit unions found themselves with an 
eroding market share and surplus funds because they were making fewer consumer 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
The rise in mortgage loans has been significant in the past few years. Since 
1986, the mortgage share of credit unions' total loan portfolios, measured by 
dollar volume, has risen almost 50% -- from 21.3% of all loans outstanding to 
31.4% as of June 1989 -- according to Charles H. Bradford, chief economist for 
the National Credit Union Administration in Washington, which regulates 
federally chartered credit unions. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the growth occurred during the booming housing market of the past few 
years. It is likely to slow during the current downturn. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, 30% of the nation's credit unions offered first mortgages, according 
to Jerry Karbon, public information manager at the Credit Union National Assn., 
based in Madison, Wis. That compared with 29% in 1987, and 26% in 1986. The 
association said that 35% of credit unions make second-mortgage loans, and 21% 
offer home-equity lines of credit. 
</P>
<P>
Bradford points out that while the growth of credit unions' assets and deposits 
in the past year has been the slowest since 1979, credit-union loans grew a 
"solid" 12.3% from June, 1988, to June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Credit unions' mortgage business is still a drop in the bucket of total 
mortgage lending. Bradford says that credit unions account for just 2% of 
residential mortgage loans made in the United States. In 1988, credit unions 
made $7.5 billion in first mortgage loans. Moser does not believe that 
mortgages will ever dominate credit unions' loan portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
"Mortgage lending is not, nor will it ever be, a major part of credit unions," 
he said. "Their mission is not housing." 
</P>
<P>
About 99% of credit unions' mortgage loans are for residential properties, 
Bradford said. 
</P>
<P>
Most loans are made by the larger credit unions, he said -- those with assets 
of at least $10 million. But a lot of the growth of recent years has come from 
smaller credit unions that are starting to make mortgage loans. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has 15,266 credit unions with 60.4 million members, Karbon 
said.

UAL'S SHARES DECLINE WITH HOPES FOR BUYOUT; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: UNITED AIRLINES' PILOTS, MANAGERS AND FLIGHT ATTENDANTS FACE BIG 
OBSTACLES IN PACKAGING A NEW OFFER FOR UAL CORP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
UAL Corp. shares dropped more than $21 Friday, one day after British Airways 
said it would not support a revised bid for the parent of United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
UAL closed at $168.50 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange as Wall Street 
grew pessimistic about a potential buyout. The airline's stock price has fallen 
$116.50 a share since financing of the $6.75-billion plan for an 
employee-management buyout collapsed a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a depressing situation," said one trader whose firm invested in UAL 
shares. "It can make you feel like crying." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of United's pilots, flight attendants and top managers met with 
their advisers in New York on Friday in an effort to restructure the deal. The 
group, led by United Chief Executive Stephen M. Wolf, needs to find a partner 
with deep pockets to replace British Air. The British carrier had agreed to 
contribute $750 million to help buy the airline but withdrew its offer after 
banks declared the deal too risky and refused to lend money to finance it. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolf group was expected to meet with the advisers through the weekend. In a 
statement, the pilots union said it would present UAL's board with a proposal 
at "the earliest possible time." People familiar with the situation said it was 
doubtful that the Wolf group would have a solid new offer ready by the time 
UAL's board meets on Monday, although it was possible that a preliminary plan 
would be delivered. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear what action the board would take. It could continue to study 
its options or it could say that the company is no longer for sale. Some 
sources in the financial community said the board, embarrassed by the failed 
takeover, might feel pressure to fire Wolf or UAL's chief financial officer, 
John C. Pope, who led the buyout group's unsuccessful effort to finance the 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
None of UAL's directors could be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Traders, stock analysts and bankers who followed developments surrounding the 
transaction said it might be difficult for the Wolf group to find a new partner 
quickly. Two employee groups, the machinists union and an organization that 
represents United's non-union workers, have opposed a buyout and called for 
Wolf's resignation. The division among United's workers might make a potential 
partner hesitate about financing a Wolf-led buyout, informed observers said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, any partner willing to finance a takeover would probably want control 
of the airline, a condition not likely to go over well with United's pilots and 
managers, who would have owned 85% of the airline under the failed proposal. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, it was considered unlikely that Los Angeles billionaire Marvin 
Davis would help the Wolf group finance an employee buyout. Davis, who in 
August set in motion the events that led to the buyout proposal with a 
$240-a-share bid, has said that he might give employees a stake in UAL but that 
he wants control. He said this week that he is still interested in the airline. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Davis was exploring whether financing would be available for a UAL 
transaction in the wake of the failed bid. Davis and the Wolf group use the 
same lead bank, Citicorp. 
</P>
<P>
Besides dealing with tricky financing problems, Davis would have to bring 
together United's fractured labor unions. The machinists, United's largest 
labor group, have tried to derail a buyout and cheered British Air's 
withdrawal. "I'm surprised it took them this long to see the folly of their 
ways," said Brian Freeman, an adviser to the machinists. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said the machinists would continue to oppose a debt-financed employee 
buyout, a position that could hurt the Wolf group's chances. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese bankers especially have been leery about backing a buyout not endorsed 
by all United's unions, and that attitude isn't likely to change.

Art Davis is not only a respected string bass player who's worked with John 
Coltrane, Bob Dylan, Judy Garland and a number of symphonies. The man also has 
a doctorate in psychology and teaches at a couple of Orange County colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, 54-year-old Davis is a chef who has garnered accolades from New York 
gourmet Craig Claiborne. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, this is one musician who really cooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who has lived in Orange County since 1986, will be performing tonight 
at the Fine Arts Recital Hall on the Orange Coast College campus in Costa Mesa. 
With him will be Charles Owens on reeds, John Beasley on piano and Mike Baker 
on drums. It's a rare chance to see the bassist in a concert situation; most of 
his playing these days is done on weekends at Oysters, a Corona del Mar 
restaurant that features a couple of his recipes. 
</P>
<P>
So, how did he end up in Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
 "I had come out here (from New York) to do several clinics and master classes 
and I got an offer to teach at Orange Coast," he said this week. "I liked the 
weather and I liked the people. My wife, who's a psychiatric nurse, was offered 
a job in Long Beach. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Back East, he'd been "working as a psychologist and it limited my playing. In 
fact, I couldn't find the time to play." He'd tried to juggle two careers, 
psychologist and jazz musician, while living in a rural part of Westchester 
County where he and his wife, Gladys, raised two sons. The realization that it 
was all too much came in 1984, while he was playing with saxophonist David 
Murray. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd finish at Sweet Basil (a club in New York's Greenwich Village) around 4 
a.m. and by the time I got home it was time to go back to the medical college 
where I worked," he related. "I tried renting a hotel room and staying in town, 
but it was still too much and eventually I had to quit." 
</P>
<P>
He'd come a long way from his youth in Harrisburg, Pa. "You know that Red Foxx 
line, 'We were poor, poor, poor' and he just goes on and on? I can identify 
with that. My father had a fourth-grade education and my mother didn't have any 
education at all." Davis, who started out on piano at age 5 before switching to 
tuba and finally settling on the bass, saw his musical ability as a way out. At 
16, he was playing with the Harrisburg Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
During the late '50s and early '60s, he gained experience with Max Roach, Dizzy 
Gillespie and Lena Horne and recorded with Oliver Nelson and Quincy Jones. His 
most important association, though, was with the legendary saxophonist John 
Coltrane. "I was a confidant of John's for about a 10-year period," Davis said. 
"I was the first musician he asked to join him when he left Miles and was 
forming his own group. The two of us used to practice together and we got very 
close. Somehow, I didn't have the foresight to record those things. I've always 
thought if I could bring that time back, that's the one thing that I would do." 
</P>
<P>
Davis can be heard on Coltrane's "Ole" and "Africa/Brass" recordings and is on 
some unreleased material from "A Love Supreme." But his most important work 
with the saxophonist is "Ascension," an album-long piece that pushed the limits 
of improvisational music when it was recorded in 1965. For the historic 
session, Coltrane put aside his usual quartet format and invited nearly a dozen 
of the day's most forward-thinking musicians to Rudy Van Gelder's studio in New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the call from John who said, 'I want you to be on this date. I think 
it's going to be a most important one.' Now John, like my oldest son, was a 
champion of understatement, and for him to say something like that, well, I 
thought this is going to be mind-boggling. I went to the date and there were a 
lot of cars outside and I thought maybe a lot of people had come to watch us 
record. I had no idea. I walked inside and saw all these musicians and said, 
'What?' " 
</P>
<P>
"I think it turned out to be the most important date that John did," he 
continued, "because it was completely different. It had all the elements -- and 
I can give lectures on this -- of collectivism. It went back into the early 
traditional music where everybody was playing, there wasn't one soloist out 
front. Even today it sounds modern." 
</P>
<P>
Coltrane's death in 1967 marked a turning point in Davis' life. He gave up on 
recording jazz and doing other studio work to chase another of his dreams. "I 
started thinking, now's my opportunity to do what I really wanted to do. I had 
the gift of giving advice to musicians -- Eric Dolphy, Jim Hall -- people would 
just come to me. So I went back to pursue psychology and medicine. I was lucky 
enough to have the brains to do it. Being a musician is a one-way street. So 
many top musicians, that's all they can do. I've been lucky." 
</P>
<P>
After gaining master's degrees in music and psychology, Davis was awarded his 
doctorate in 1981 from New York University. His dissertation involved music and 
its effect on time estimation. Subjects for the study included trumpeter Lester 
Bowie and saxophonist Arthur Blythe. The work was dedicated to his parents. 
</P>
<P>
And he was getting back into performing and recording. "I met Dizzy Reece in 
1979 when I was with Dizzy Gillespie in Europe. He said if he ever got an 
album, he was going to call me. Turns out he did and that was the first jazz 
date that I had recorded since Coltrane's death." 
</P>
<P>
Davis worked as a psychologist and taught in the early '80s while doing the 
occasional jazz date. He says that he's played more since he's been in Orange 
County, but his main gig has been teaching. He fronts classes in music at 
Orange Coast (where he also anchors the bass section of the symphony) as well 
as instructing a class in cultural diversity at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The bassist has been involved with almost every type of music imaginable. He 
can be heard on some early Bob Dylan recordings and for a while in the '60s he 
was the first-call bass for a number of folk singers, including Peter, Paul and 
Mary. He was a member of the New York Philharmonic in the early '70s and has 
recorded Greek music with Manos Hadjidakis, the composer who won an Emmy for 
his "Never On Sunday" score. Davis has even backed Minnie Pearl. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fortunate because I like all kinds of music, not just one or two 
particular types. It's very stimulating to me. I think there should be a lot of 
diversity." 
</P>
<P>
 The Art Davis Quartet plays tonight at 8 in the Fine Arts Recital Hall at 
Orange Coast College, 2701 Fairview Road, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $7.50 to $9. 
Information: (714) 432-5880.

ARTS CENTER'S BUDGET GROWTH TO ALLOW MORE PROGRAMMING; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCES: THANKS TO A SERIES OF SUMMER SELLOUTS, THE FACILITY IS $400,000 AHEAD 
OF ITS PROJECTED SPENDING PLAN, MEANING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CAN ADD SOME 
SHOWS IN 1990.

<P>
Confident of ending the year in the black after a series of sold-out summer 
programs, the Orange County Performing Arts Center has adopted an operating 
budget of $16.5 million for 1990 -- $1.5 million larger than this year's. The 
money would support a slight increase in programming, according to Center 
President Thomas R. Kendrick. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Center has asked its original architect, theater designer and 
general contractor to prepare a "specific needs study" for an proposed new 
concert hall, said Kendrick, who made the announcements Thursday after a 
quarterly meeting of the Center's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
The Center is $400,000 ahead of its current projected $15-million budget 
because of its "extraordinarily successful summer," Kendrick said. "We had 25 
sellouts in a row within four weeks of (performances by) the Kirov Ballet, 
'Fiddler on the Roof' and 'Cats.' " 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 budget increase is attributable principally to plans for "slightly 
more programming." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, there were 210 presentations in the building, sponsored by regional 
groups and by the Center itself. Revenue, generated mostly through ticket 
sales, are projected to increase by $1.5 million in 1990, Kendrick said. The 
prediction is based on increased attendance, he added, not higher ticket 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
Overall attendance so far this year is up 5% and subscription renewals for both 
the Center's ballet and Broadway series -- which alone gained 1,300 new 
subscribers this year -- have been strong, Kendrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales have been far above the national average since the Center opened 
in 1986, Kendrick continued. Last year, box office receipts contributed 83% of 
earned revenue, compared to the national average of about 65%. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the ticket sales, the Center expects a budget deficit of $5.73 
million before charitable donations for the 1990 budget, Kendrick said. But 
fund-raising efforts and other sources of support are expected to deliver $5.74 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the 1990 budget is $100,000 for the needs study, to be conducted by 
CRSS (called Caudill Rowlett Scott when the firm designed the center), 
Peck-Jones General Contractors, and John von Szeliski, who designed technical 
elements of the Center's interior. 
</P>
<P>
The study is intended to help staff members determine "exactly what kind of 
(new) structure would be built," Kendrick said. Size and overall purpose would 
be addressed, along with questions regarding specific facilities. Construction 
costs can then be estimated and final plans drawn, Kendrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Henry T. Segerstrom, the Center's chairman and chief operating officer, said a 
site for the proposed Orange County hall also would not be discussed until the 
needs study is complete. Segerstrom's family donated the land on which the 
current Center building sits. 
</P>
<P>
An earlier marketing feasibility study called for a new concert hall and a 
smaller theater within the next decade. The proposed hall, to be used chiefly 
by the Pacific Symphony and the Orange County Philharmonic Society, could cost 
from $60 million to $80 million and seat 2,300 to 2,500, the study estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Center officials expect the new study to "refine" these estimates. They also 
hope it will avert problems in evidence at Los Angeles' Walt Disney Concert 
Hall, now under construction. Projected costs for that hall (for which 
Peck-Jones also is contractor) have risen dramatically above initial 
projections, Segerstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
The Center board on Thursday also nominated two new members for three-year 
terms: Reed L. Royalty, Pacific Bell's vice president for Orange, Riverside, 
San Bernardino and Inyo counties; and Michael B.A. Nobbs, vice president and 
managing director of Citicorp Real Estate Western Region. 
</P>
<P>
The Center also signed a new three-year contract with the International 
Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, the stagehands' union, which remains 
virtually unchanged in its primary terms, Kendrick said.

QUILTS ARE BACK IN STYLE -- AND IT'S NOT SO CRAZY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, Kathryn Bold is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When she moved to California from New England 11 years ago, professional quilt 
maker Karen Turgeon worried she'd soon be out of a job. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know how quilts would work out here with all these modern homes," she 
says. "But when I started looking at the architecture with all the soaring 
ceilings, high walls and long hallways, I realized quilts would work very 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Turgeon, many interior designers and home decorators realized 
the same thing and have gone crazy over quilts. Not only do they show them off 
on beds, they hang them on walls and drape them over furniture. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of decorators say to use them for dining room tablecloths, but I can't 
see a circle of red wine on a beautiful quilt," Turgeon says. She had no such 
qualms, however, about making a quilt to cover a grand piano. 
</P>
<P>
More than a bedspread, the quilt has achieved the status of fine art. American 
pioneers who first fashioned quilts out of material scraps to keep warm in 
winter would pop their stitches if they could see how decorators now hang 
quilts in living rooms under studio lighting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like bringing a painting into your room," Turgeon says. "A quilt can pull 
together all your colors." 
</P>
<P>
Turgeon finds no shortage of buyers for her custom quilts, which she stitches 
by hand out of her home in Laguna Hills under the name Peaceable Kingdom 
Quilts. 
</P>
<P>
She's even found her Orange County clients to be more picky about their quilts 
than the folks back in New England. 
</P>
<P>
"Color is very big here," she says. "Everyone wants everything to be 
color-coordinated. Back East if your grandmother gave you an ugly quilt and the 
colors were wrong, you used it anyway. Out here, you fold it up and stuff it in 
the closet." 
</P>
<P>
For home decorators, not just any old quilt will do. They want one tailor-made 
to blend in with their decor. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll show me a wall and say, 'It has to fit this space and color.' Quilts 
are wonderful for that. They can be any size or design," Turgeon says. 
</P>
<P>
Quilts can adapt to everything from a country to a contemporary look. 
Traditional patterns such as the log cabin, schoolhouse and grandmother's 
flower garden go well in country homes, but the old patterns can also brighten 
modern rooms if one substitutes solid-colored fabrics for quaint pastel prints. 
</P>
<P>
"Not all quilts are ruffly and cute," Turgeon says. "Some work well with modern 
furniture, especially those with geometric patterns. 
</P>
<P>
"I work in Amish quilts a lot. They're very graphic and made with mostly solid, 
dark colors. They look great with our white walls." 
</P>
<P>
While many consider quilts to be timeless, they do follow trends. When mauve 
and slate blue began turning up on everything from carpeting to Tupperware, 
quilt makers picked up on the colors as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have to keep up with what's in fashion," says Martha Faghani, manager of 
The Gazebo of New York in Costa Mesa's South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Faghani, who helps design the handmade quilts carried by Gazebo, has noticed 
that an increasing number of them feature dark colors. One, for example, has a 
sunburst in shades of solid blue against a plain white background. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of elegant, sophisticated quilts that have a lot of white 
space. They go well in modern homes," Faghani says. 
</P>
<P>
At Piecemakers Country Store in Costa Mesa, quilt makers constantly design new 
patterns to keep up with the times. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago you never saw a coyote on a quilt," says Janet McDonald, who 
makes hand-stitched quilts for Piecemakers. 
</P>
<P>
"We noticed a lot of things going Southwest in decorating, so we started using 
that (theme) in the quilts." 
</P>
<P>
One Southwest-style quilt has an appliqued panel of Indian pottery and feathers 
done in hues of purple and peach. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike store-bought comforters, custom quilts can reflect the tastes and 
personality of their owners. 
</P>
<P>
One woman approached Piecemakers with a postcard that showed a quilt dating 
from the 1880s. The quilt had an intricate pattern of appliqued bows and 
flowers, and the customer wanted an identical one for her home. The quilt 
makers obliged, enlarging the photograph so they could copy the pattern to 
perfection. 
</P>
<P>
Another customer brought in all the T-shirts he'd won in marathons to have them 
sewn up in a quilt. 
</P>
<P>
Custom quilts cost $500 to $1,500, depending on their size and the intricacy of 
the hand-stitching. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a big investment," Turgeon says. "When (customers) decide they want a 
quilt, it's got to be special." 
</P>
<P>
Quilt makers usually sew the pieces of fabric together by machine, then sew all 
the tiny top stitches or quilting by hand -- a time-consuming task. Turgeon 
might spend four to six months on a single king-size quilt. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband will ask me, 'How much money do you think you're making on that 
quilt an hour?' I tell him I don't do it for the money, I do it for the joy of 
making something beautiful and useful." She does make money on her simpler 
bedspreads and pillows. 
</P>
<P>
Many others have also discovered the joy of quilting. The Orange County 
Quilters Guild has seen its ranks multiply with people wanting to learn how to 
make quilts. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a limit of 400 members, and there's a waiting list of people to get 
in," says Thayone Jones of Brea, second vice president of the guild. 
</P>
<P>
Many people want quilts but don't have the time to make their own. Neighborhood 
quilting bees have all but disappeared, replaced by custom quilt manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Piecemakers farms out its quilting to people who sew out of their homes, and 
the Gazebo has its quilts assembled and stitched in Haiti. Quilt makers say 
their customers pay for the labor because they appreciate the craftsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
"Quilts are both a visual and tactile treat," Faghani says. "They're pretty, 
they have interesting patterns and they feel good." 
</P>
<P>
Some attribute the rising popularity of quilts to a longing for the simpler 
things like home and hearth. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something about a handmade quilt that turns a house into a home," says 
Marie Kolasinski of Piecemakers. "They just warm up the place. There's nothing 
cold or sterile about them. It's much different than if you buy something from 
a factory." 
</P>
<P>
Turgeon, too, says people want things that have not been churned out by 
machine, things that take time to make and don't fall out of fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"Our society is very fast," Turgeon says. "It's built on planned obsolescence. 
Quilts are built to last." 
</P>
<P>
For many of her clients, quilts represent a return to their roots. 
</P>
<P>
"I had one great big construction worker come into my former shop in Laguna 
Beach. His grandmother made a quilt with a double wedding ring (pattern) that 
was lost, and he wanted one just like it. He must have come back eight or 10 
times to make sure it was exactly like his grandmother's." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the growing designer status quilts have attained, they're still used as 
grandmother intended. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing to match a quilt for coziness," Turgeon says. "Quilts bring 
warmth. You can cuddle up with them on a crummy night." 
</P>
<P>
But first, you'll have to take them off the wall. 
</P>

MARBLE; 
</P>
<P>
AFFORDABILITY OPENS DOOR FOR REGAL DECOR IN O.C. HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When Karen and Dennis Galloway decided to sell their "average" tract house in 
Laguna Niguel and build their dream home in a nearby gated community, there was 
one custom design feature they insisted on having: marble. 
</P>
<P>
Built a year ago, the Galloways' 4,600-square-foot two-story 
Mediterranean-style house boasts a marble entryway, five marble-faced 
fireplaces and -- the piece de resistance -- a spectacular gray and white 
marble bathroom complete with its own marble fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'When I build the house, I'm going to have (marble) throughout,' " 
said Karen Galloway. "I love it. Certainly, I wasn't exposed to marble when I 
was growing up, but when you've traveled and seen beautiful homes and things, 
it's just expected." 
</P>
<P>
She rhapsodized: "Marble is like a jewel, and it sets the room off. I always 
considered it like a quality accessory. A woman has a beautiful black dress on, 
but she accessorizes it with jewels. That, to me, is what marble does to my 
living room." 
</P>
<P>
Stone formed as many as 2 billion years ago when heat and pressure in the 
earth's crust caused limestone to undergo changes in its makeup and texture, 
marble is the stuff that multimillion-dollar dream homes are made of. 
</P>
<P>
Hearst Castle, William Randolph Hearst's baronial estate on a hill above San 
Simeon, just wouldn't be the same without its oval-shaped Neptune Pool lined 
with slabs of white and verd-antique marble laid in an intricate pattern. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, New York hotel queen Leona Helmsley and husband Harry paid a 
cool $1 million for an all-marble dance floor in their 28-room Greenwich 
mansion, which has been dubbed a "Connecticut Taj Mahal." 
</P>
<P>
But while marble is still associated with the life styles of the rich and 
famous, it has become much more democratic in recent years because of lower 
prices and increased availability. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, as in other parts of the country, marble has become the 
upscale decorator item of choice for entry halls, living rooms and bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
And it's just as likely to be found in a tract house in Mission Viejo as a 
waterfront home in Newport Beach. (One Garden Grove woman is having 2,000 
square feet of marble put in her 6,000-square-foot home -- and that doesn't 
include the marble-faced waterfall in the entry.) 
</P>
<P>
"We use a tremendous amount of marble," said Carol McMahon of Veldhuis-McMahon 
Interior Design in Dana Point. "It used to be strictly in custom homes, but as 
tract homes in Orange County get more and more expensive, tract home builders 
just want to show that they can compete with custom homes and use some of the 
same products, and that would include marble." 
</P>
<P>
Added McMahon, who designs interiors for many custom homes in South Orange 
County and traces the dramatic increase in demand for marble over the past five 
years: "I think people are getting back to timeless beauty and elegance in 
their homes, and marble gives you that. It's nothing trendy. It's like using 
silk in fabric. It's a natural product. It's beautiful. It's timeless. It's 
God-made." 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say keeping up with the Joneses is not also a factor in the 
growing popularity of marble in home decor. 
</P>
<P>
"Marble carries an image," said Fullerton designer Jason Titus. "It's the same 
image that fosters the BMW and Mercedes-Benz. It's the image of: 'I have made 
it. I can afford it.' I'm sure that's primarily why people like it because it 
carries that image too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mixed bag: It's an image of history and affluence or wealth. We can 
substitute 'tradition' for history too." 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Colarusso, a sales representative for Globe Marble and Tile Inc. in 
Anaheim, said the market for marble "has increased about a thousandfold -- I'm 
not even exaggerating -- in the past year and a half." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Colarusso said, "People thought marble was much too expensive. 
Granted, it used to be simply because the quarries were still hand-cutting. 
They still are, to an extent, but technology has picked up (where) they're now 
using diamond-cut blades with a high-pressure water-jet system, which cuts like 
a laser and gives a much cleaner cut." Experiments with cutting marble with 
lasers also are being made, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The result: Retail marble prices as low as $7 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
"An average homeowner can now afford to put that in their entry," said 
Colarusso, adding that, depending on its rarity, the top end is about $40 per 
square foot. One of the most expensive, "sky blue" marble, which is mined only 
in Brazil, costs $42 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
(Marble slabs, used to fabricate furniture and showers, range from $25 to $70 
per square foot for material and fabrication.) 
</P>
<P>
While many people think only of white statues when marble comes to mind, 
Colarusso said, the color variations of marble "are just as big as nature" -- 
everything from jade green to Italian rose. Globe Marble and Tile, which claims 
to be the largest importer of marble and granite in the nation, carries 136 
different kinds of marble and about the same amount of granite, which sells for 
$12 to $80 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
It is the natural beauty of marble's streaked or mottled look that appeals to 
homeowners, according to Colarusso. (Marble, she said, is always 20 degrees 
colder than the air around it: "That's how you can tell fake from real: You 
touch it, it's cold.") 
</P>
<P>
Marble is most commonly installed in entryways, living rooms and bathrooms and 
around fireplaces, but designers say it can be misused. Titus, for one, does 
not recommend using marble in the kitchen -- either on the floor or on 
countertops. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're asking for trouble," he said, explaining that the acid in 
vinegar, lemon juice, wine and tomato juice "will just eat marble." He said one 
of his clients, who put marble on the kitchen floor "over my objection," 
spilled a bottle of vinegar, and the vinegar etched the surface off the floor. 
</P>
<P>
While protective finishes are available, Titus said acidic liquids also will 
eat away the finish. And if the finish is on a countertop surface that gets 
daily use, "just the normal wear and tear of wiping it" will wear it off, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Granite, which is harder than marble and will not stain, has become 
increasingly popular for kitchen countertops and bar tops. 
</P>
<P>
"The nice thing about granite is granite can look contemporary for a 
contemporary kitchen or traditional for traditional kitchen," Titus said. "It 
depends on the color and also the way the edges are handled." 
</P>
<P>
Although many homeowners mix varieties of marble, doing so risks becoming what 
designer McMahon calls "a hodgepodge." 
</P>
<P>
"You really have to blend them well," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's done well, it can be effective," Titus agreed. "There are floors in 
Italy or France that have 10 or 12 different colors of marble in them. It's 
like anything: If an amateur does it, it might not come off because they don't 
know what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Marble sets a tone, Titus said, that "can be as dressy as the marble is or as 
casual as the marble is. It has to do with the graining of it or the color 
tone. A pink marble or white marble is always going to be dressy because it has 
a feminine quality and a very French quality. It has an elegant look. A 
brownish color tends to be more masculine and less dressy." 
</P>
<P>
And despite its upscale image, marble is not too grand for even a simple tract 
house, Titus said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can use it effectively; it doesn't have to be grand," he said. "And in 
Europe, of course, in certain areas in certain times, it was a common material. 
In a sense, marble was as common when it was used then as vinyl tile is today. 
I mean it carries that ordinariness about it. It's not so expensive a material 
that it isn't in the reach of anyone in the middle-income area. And it's 
appropriate in many cases. I mean there's nothing nicer than a marble entryway. 
</P>
<P>
"It's timeless." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Costa Mesa interior designer Karen Myers Ziccardi of Interior Design 
Development, who is currently designing five custom residences -- all with 
marble entryways and granite countertops -- sees the current marble mania as 
more than just another trend. 
</P>
<P>
"There are trends," she said. "However, some trends are classics. The use of 
marble goes back to the early Greeks and Romans. When you think about it 
historically, these timeless materials may go through trends in how they're 
used or what kind of colorization becomes inspiring at the moment, but the 
material itself is a classic, and anything that is a classic never really is a 
trend."

In November, days will become shorter and cooler, but don't be fooled. It can 
be very dry during this time of the year, and regular watering remains a very 
important part of any gardening schedule, especially when Santa Ana winds 
appear. 
</P>
<P>
Keep those fall and winter annuals you have planted -- such as Iceland poppies, 
pansies and primroses -- healthy by feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer 
every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
As the cool months of winter are approaching, the ideal growing season for 
cyclamen begins. A member of the primrose family, cyclamen flower colors 
include white, pink, rose, red and purple. To dress up a patio or garden entry, 
plant several small potted cyclamens, four to six inches in size, into a larger 
bowl or container for a very effective splash of color. When transplanting use 
a rich, well-drained soil, but take care not to cover the crown of the tuber as 
this will cause the leaf and flower shoots to rot. 
</P>
<P>
Cyclamens develop a tuber much like the tuberous begonia, and they prefer a 
cool, bright filtered-light location. Once these plants are well established, 
feed every two to three weeks with a balanced fertilizer.

<P>
. . . AND GENERAL NOVEMBER CARE TIPS 
</P>
<P>
Stop feeding garden roses now since they're getting ready for their dormant 
winter period. 
</P>
<P>
Left to decay on your lawn or flower bed, fallen leaves are a haven for all 
sorts of pests and diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Don't forget to plant Dutch iris this month for a show of spring flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Plant Iceland poppies now to bring colorful blooms to the winter garden or as 
cut flowers indoors. 
</P>
<P>
Cut back or eliminate fertilizer for your houseplants and give them a rest for 
the winter. As active growth slows, take care not to overwater. 
</P>
<P>
If your bulb plants are turning yellow, cut them back and dig them for storage 
or be sure they are mulched well enough to keep them from freezing or being 
drowned -- assuming, of course, we have rain again. 
</P>
<P>
Now is an excellent time to plant new trees, shrubs and lawns. Lawns that 
should be overseeded can be worked now or, with an added feeding, you might be 
able to maintain the lawn longer. 
</P>
<P>
It's even the right time of year to seed the wildflowers in the areas where you 
want a show of spring color. Check with your local professional garden center 
and find out more about wild flowers that can naturalize. 
</P>
<P>
Take care with chrysanthemums -- dust for pests, stake for support, discontinue 
pinching out the tips, but start to disbud to get larger flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Consider raising flower beds to provide better drainage for your plants this 
winter. Use materials such as railroad ties and brick and add three or four 
inches of soil. 
</P>
<P>
There's still time to plant a berried shrub or two; choose from Christmas 
berry, holly and various pyracanthas. 
</P>
<P>
Houseplants need less water as the days get shorter and skies grow dimmer, 
especially those in plastic pots (which don't "breathe" like clay pots); keep 
an eye on those nearest the fireplace or heater.

DO-IT-YOURSELF: LET CERTIFIED EXPERTS JUGGLE ASBESTOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This column is called "Do-It-Yourself," but this time it is about something you 
shouldn't try on your own: removal of asbestos from the home. 
</P>
<P>
Exposure to the one-time miracle mineral, used for lightweight fireproofing and 
insulation, is now known to cause serious health problems. 
</P>
<P>
And if you live in a home built before 1978 -- when asbestos was prohibited -- 
it's likely that asbestos-containing materials are present. 
</P>
<P>
That does not mean you should tear your house down, or even that you are being 
exposed to anything harmful. In many cases, the asbestos-containing products 
are perfectly safe and should be left alone. They create problems only if 
damaged or disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
But because Orange County homeowners are great remodelers, you should know just 
where asbestos is likely to be found -- and what the rules are regarding its 
safe handling. 
</P>
<P>
Knocking down walls, removing ceilings, ripping up linoleum or asbestos tile 
flooring and extending heating ducts all can create asbestos-exposure dangers. 
</P>
<P>
Material containing asbestos is most dangerous when in a friable state -- a 
broken, crumbled or pulverized condition in which asbestos-laden dust is 
released. 
</P>
<P>
No one is now legally responsible for checking for the presence of asbestos 
before a project begins. But as of Jan. 1, a new South Coast Air Quality 
Management District rule will require professional contractors to test for the 
presence of asbestos before starting demolition or remodeling work and to 
ensure that workers and others are not exposed to asbestos during the project. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Reum of Enkay Engineering, a Santa Ana-based, asbestos-removal contractor 
-- one of fewer than 200 statewide that have been licensed by Cal-OSHA -- 
emphasizes that handling the material -- whether to remove it or seal it off -- 
is best and most safely left to professionals. Do not do it yourself. 
</P>
<P>
The material is dangerous because it is made up of tiny, microscopic fibers 
that can easily be inhaled and become lodged in the lungs, causing asbestosis 
-- a debilitating respiratory ailment -- and several types of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
While there is a definite link between these diseases and workers who have had 
a high lifetime exposure to asbestos, little is known about the low-level 
effects of the material. Still, state and federal law operates on the principle 
that even very little is way too much. 
</P>
<P>
For the typical county resident, the most immediate problem might be in your 
fireplace. Asbestos was widely used in cement logs for gas fireplaces and, 
worse, was the principal ingredient in the false ashes that were spread beneath 
the logs to make the display look realistic. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a pre-1978 fireplace log set, have it tested for asbestos and, if 
it is present, hire an asbestos removal firm to clean out the fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos can be found in more than a dozen applications in the home. It was 
widely used to insulate heating ducts and in sprayed-on acoustic ceilings until 
barred in 1978 and was a popular ingredient in linoleum and vinyl floor tile, 
in wallboard joint compounds and patching plasters, in the tape used to seal 
the joints between heating ducts and heat registers, in roofing felt and tar, 
and in the gaskets of some stoves and furnaces. 
</P>
<P>
In older homes, asbestos was also a commonly used material in the cloth-covered 
insulation on electrical wiring. It was used to insulate hot-water pipes and as 
a lining for wooden electrical fuse boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, relatively few homes in the county have old-fashioned steam or 
oil-fired basement heating systems, eliminating one common source of asbestos 
exposure: decaying gaskets in furnace doors and damaged insulation around pipes 
and boilers. 
</P>
<P>
But asbestos was also commonly used to insulate overhead heating ducts. 
"Removing damaged duct insulation is the most common residential job we do," 
Reum said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 1950s, most heating ducts were insulated with an asbestos-lined 
paper. From the '50s through the early 1970s, air-cell insulation was almost 
universal in the heating industry -- and most of it contained asbestos. In the 
mid-70s a new product, Alumasbestos, came into use. 
</P>
<P>
In all of its forms, asbestos duct insulation can become friable, either 
through deterioration or from damage that rips the paper, plastic or aluminum 
outer coatings and exposes asbestos to the air. 
</P>
<P>
Another common use for asbestos in the home was in ubiquitous spray-on 
acoustic, or "cottage cheese," ceilings. In most cases, those ceilings are safe 
-- as long as the homeowner uses a little common sense. 
</P>
<P>
Do not sweep or dust or paint them with devices that will knock the material 
loose, and do not vacuum up particles that fall down. Reum recommends using a 
moistened paper towel to pick up loose particles, which then should be sealed 
in a plastic bag for disposal. He said that an airless spray gun is the safest 
tool to use in painting such a ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
If your acoustic ceiling is damaged, or if you are remodeling and need to 
remove it, have samples tested from several areas of the ceiling in each room 
in which it appears to determine whether asbestos is present. 
</P>
<P>
"You should take several samples," Reum said, "because sometimes, depending on 
how the stuff was mixed, one area can be asbestos-free while another will have 
a high concentration." 
</P>
<P>
Inspections for asbestos can be done by Cal-OSHA approved asbestos abatement 
and removal contractors and by industrial hygienists. All will involve testing 
of material, Reum said, "because no matter how long you've been in this 
business, you can't tell just by looking at something whether it has asbestos 
or not." 
</P>
<P>
A few rules of thumb to follow if you contract an inspection: 
</P>
<P>
Do not deal with an outfit that tries to frighten you into having work done. 
High-pressure tactics, in asbestos removal as in most any other field, 
generally signal a shoddy operation. 
</P>
<P>
Get several estimates before you hire a firm for removal or abatement work. A 
recent job involving removal of about 300 square feet of sprayed-on acoustic 
ceiling material in two rooms brought bids of $950, $1,000 and $2,400 from 
three Orange County-based asbestos contractors. And the high bidder on that job 
was the low bidder, by a factor of 50%, on a job calling for removal of 
exterior wall shingles. 
</P>
<P>
Do not assume that just because a material has asbestos, it must be removed. 
Many asbestos-laden materials are safe. Linoleum and vinyl-asbestos floor tile, 
for example, is dangerous only if you are ripping it up or for some reason want 
to sand it. And undamaged acoustic ceilings are usually best left alone. 
</P>
<P>
Floors and ceilings containing asbestos can also be covered over, on floors 
with plywood and new flooring and on ceilings with dry-wall gypsum board and 
new plaster or paint. Ceilings can also be encapsulated by spraying a chemical 
agent that bonds with the asbestos fibers and seals them in plastic coating. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos consultants, asbestos removal and abatement contractors and industrial 
hygienists are all listed in the Yellow Pages. 
</P>
<P>
Are you handy? Do you install your own skylights, French doors and electric 
lighting, or build your own bookshelves, gazebos, brick walls or wine cellars? 
If you have completed -- or are in the midst of -- special projects around your 
house, share them and your expertise. Write: Do-It-Yourself, Orange County

LIBRARY FOR THE CURIOUS STARTS WITH DICTIONARY, ALMANAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's 4 a.m. and you're lying awake, saucer-eyed and jittery because your mind 
refuses to shut down for the night and you've got to, got to, got to find out 
what slag is. 
</P>
<P>
It's killing you. You shut your eyes and see a slag heap, but each time it 
appears it's made out of something different. Dirt, charcoal briquettes, old 
tires. 
</P>
<P>
"So what's it a heap of?" you mutter, staring at the alarm clock and realizing 
that there is no one you know, anywhere, at 4 a.m. who can tell you what slag 
is. 
</P>
<P>
At a time like that, a good home reference library is worth at least a good 
night's sleep. And $75 or so doesn't seem such a high price to pay for a copy 
of the "Materials Handbook" (McGraw-Hill), which will tell you exactly, 
precisely, in detail what slag is. 
</P>
<P>
For writers, researchers and other people who tend to be insatiably curious 
about the world they live in, a good home reference library can be a kind of 
safe haven where you can count on finding answers. 
</P>
<P>
For an outlay of money that can be either modest or stupendous, depending on 
your needs, it's possible to put books on your home shelves that can tell you 
how to spell accommodate, what Johannes Kepler is famous for, what the GNP of 
Namibia was last year and, yes, even what slag is, said Laura Masoner, the 
senior reference librarian at the Orange County Public Library's Garden Grove 
Regional Branch. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a couple of things you really can't live without," Masoner said. "An 
unabridged dictionary and an almanac. With an unabridged dictionary, you can 
pick up so much more information than just how to spell a word. And a good 
dictionary will pretty much take care of (the role of) a thesaurus." 
</P>
<P>
The best unabridged dictionaries on bookstore shelves today are published by 
Webster's, Random House (which emphasizes American English usage and slang) and 
American Heritage, Masoner said. Each is priced under $100. 
</P>
<P>
Any good almanac will do, according to Masoner. They can provide esoteric 
knowledge that sometimes surprises first-time users, "like when Easter is going 
to be in the year 2000," she noted. 
</P>
<P>
However, history, biography, literature, science, the arts and many other 
subjects cannot be covered thoroughly in just two books. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, of course, you need a good, basic encyclopedia," Masoner said. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of multivolume sets can range from $500 for a basic high school-level 
encyclopedia, such as the World Book, to around $2,000 for the Encyclopaedia 
Brittanica. 
</P>
<P>
"The Brittanica's considered more scholarly," Masoner said. "The others, like 
the World Book, are good for ready reference, and they have very good pictures 
and illustrations." 
</P>
<P>
Encyclopedia shopping can be confusing, but local libraries often have the 
answer: a reference volume entitled the "Encyclopedia Buying Guide," which 
lists the scope and features of all encyclopedias on the market. 
</P>
<P>
How about finding your way around? An atlas fills that bill, and there are 
several types and prices, depending on scope and detail. 
</P>
<P>
Rand McNally's Commercial Atlas and Marketing Guide is, according to Masoner, 
"the Rolls-Royce of atlases. Limited to the United States, the atlas lists 
train lines, airports, shipping lanes and other commercial routes. It also 
contains information on regional buying power, local tax bases and other 
elements of commerce. It is priced at $215. 
</P>
<P>
Masoner also recommended the London Times Atlas of the World and atlases 
produced by the National Geographic Society. 
</P>
<P>
Not satisfied with knowing your way around the land? Atlases of the sea are 
available -- and there even are atlases on the geography of space. 
</P>
<P>
"Atlases can be kind of a big ticket," Masoner said. "You can spend $100 easily 
and go up to about $800. You can get really fancy." 
</P>
<P>
A type of quasi-atlas is Webster's Geographical Dictionary, which features 
basic maps and descriptions of world locations. It costs about $15. 
</P>
<P>
"It's where you would go if someone said, 'Where the heck is Belgium?' " 
Masoner said. 
</P>
<P>
One step beyond the basics is the Statistical Abstract of the United States, 
published by the United States government and available in many large 
bookstores. It is, simply, a comprehensive list of statistics used by the 
government, from the number of snake bites reported in the country each year to 
the number of registered Democrats in Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything to do with statistics, it's there," Masoner said. 
</P>
<P>
Another extra for the basic home library is a compendium of famous quotations. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people recommend Bartlett's (Familiar Quotations) as a basic, but it 
really depends on what kinds of things you're doing at home as to whether 
you'll use it a lot," Masoner said. 
</P>
<P>
For the more specialized home librarian -- or the incurably curious -- several 
reference books are available. 
</P>
<P>
Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia, which sells for about $35, is a must for the 
bibliophile, Masoner said. It lists "about everything you want to know about 
literature: poets, playwrights, novelists, legends, prize winners, historical 
data, characters in a play, synopses. I like to give copies as Christmas 
presents." 
</P>
<P>
Medical matters -- such as anatomy, diseases, symptoms and treatments -- are 
covered thoroughly by the Merck Manual, published by Merck and priced at around 
$20. However, Masoner said, "people read it and call the library (for 
clarification) because it's written in medical-ese. If you get that book, you 
almost need a medical dictionary." 
</P>
<P>
The best of the medical reference books is Dorland's Medical Dictionary, priced 
at about $50, she said. 
</P>
<P>
For the scientifically inclined, Van Nostrand's Scientific Encyclopedia is "a 
very, very good single volume," Masoner said. It details almost everything 
having to do with scientific discoveries -- literally the way the world works. 
Its thickness attests in part to its completeness; it is about five inches from 
cover to cover. A drawback: It costs nearly $200. 
</P>
<P>
People in business who work at home part or full time may benefit from the 
Management Handbook, published by the American Management Assn., Masoner said. 
"It's the one basic business reference book I would recommend people have at 
home. It's a one-volume encyclopedia for people who want to know anything about 
business. For instance, if your boss asks you to do a marketing report and you 
don't know what a marketing report is, this will tell you." It retails for 
around $70. 
</P>
<P>
The Materials Handbook is "another favorite I like to push," Masoner said. "If 
you want to know what anything is made of, it'll tell you. You'd be surprised 
at how many calls we get from people asking questions like, 'What's the stuff 
in red pepper that burns my tongue?' If you turn to the Materials Handbook, you 
can find out that it's called capsicum." 
</P>
<P>
For those who get hot under the collar not from pepper but from wrangling with 
government bureaucracy, Masoner recommended the United States Government 
Manual, available for $5 at government bookstores. It is published yearly and 
lists all major U.S. government offices, who are in charge and their phone 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, if you want to just forget the whole thing and watch a little TV, 
there are two paperback volumes that can help you pick out your favorite 
movies. The Movie Guide (Ballantine, $6.50) lists all videos currently 
available in retail stores and rental outlets, and critic Leonard Maltin's TV 
Movies and Video Guide (Signet, $5.95) lists "every movie that's ever been on 
TV," Masoner said. 
</P>
<P>
And if all of the above items aren't enough, there is one more option for the 
truly dedicated information junkie: facts by computer. 
</P>
<P>
Many services, such as Datatimes and CompuServe Information Service, offer 
access to their databases, which include such information as news services, 
electronic mail, Dow Jones information, full newspaper texts, stock quotes and 
various reference sources such as dictionaries and encyclopedias. 
</P>
<P>
Required for access to these services are a personal computer and a modem to 
connect the computer with the databases by phone. Fees vary widely and are 
generally based on the number of minutes the subscriber uses to tap into the 
database. 
</P>
<P>
"You can set up just about any kind of information you want," Masoner said. 
"There are hundreds of options. I would consider something like that top-end." 
</P>
<P>
And, she said, database shoppers need look no further than -- again -- the 
local library to find out which is best for their purposes. All data services 
are listed in a library volume entitled Directory of Online Databases. 
</P>
<P>
There is even one more step to take, for those who don't want to pay a use fee 
for a database. It is now possible, she said, to encode reference books onto 
compact disks -- the same sorts of disks currently popular in audio systems. 
These disks are read by a special disk drive that must be purchased separately 
and connected to the computer. These drives can cost as little as $850 or as 
much as $2,000, Masoner said. 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft Corp. offers a disk called "The Bookshelf," which includes the World 
Almanac, the Chicago Manual of Style, a national ZIP Code directory, the 
American Heritage Dictionary and Bartlett's Familiar Quotations. The disk 
retails for $295. 
</P>
<P>
The disks' capacities are huge, she added. The 22-volume Oxford English 
Dictionary can be contained on one disk. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the growth market in business communication," Masoner said. 
</P>
<P>
However, she added, the best deal of all in reference works -- facts for free 
-- can be had at the local library. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of people think the library is a place you can take the kids to read a 
book or a quiet place to pick up the latest best seller. They don't realize we 
have all this, too," said Masoner, gesturing at the long rows of reference 
volumes in the Garden Grove branch of the Orange County Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
And, she added, many of the volumes that are periodically replaced are sold at 
branch libraries at large discounts. 
</P>
<P>
One final note for those who are studying to go on "Jeopardy" or who want to 
get to sleep tonight: Slag is the fused refuse or dross separated from a metal 
in the process of smelting. 
</P>
<P>
You could look it up.

Photo, Reference librarian Laura Masoner suggests starting with an unabridged 
dictionary. An almanac and encyclopedia complete the basic reference library, 
she says. Then you can go on to specialized books, such as an atlas, book of 
quotes and medical guides in completing a home reference library. ROD BOREN

POINTERS ON HOW TO CREATE DISTINCT PERSONALITY IN A TRACT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the would-be home decorator, the empty rooms of a new house can be as 
unsettling as a blank sheet of paper poking out of a writer's typewriter. Each 
is a tabula rasa, and anything that goes on or in them carries an indelible, 
individual creative mark. It can be enough to produce a fair case of the 
jitters. 
</P>
<P>
Those walls and empty rooms can be particularly formidable because, unlike the 
writer who can wad up his mistakes, throw them away and begin again, homeowners 
must live with their rooms day after day. And if they happen to live in a tract 
home, with several houses with identical floor plans in the same neighborhood, 
the creative task can be magnified. How do you create a distinctively decorated 
room that carries your personal mark when the room you're working with has 
exactly the same dimensions as three or four others on your block? 
</P>
<P>
The Times asked three owners of homes with identical floor plans in the new 
Normandale Heights tract in El Toro how they solved the problem with their 
living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The results of their decorating labors were three highly singular and personal 
rooms in three distinct styles, reflecting an eye for the colorful, the unusual 
and the harmonious, and encompassing furniture from contemporary to solidly 
traditional. 
</P>
<P>
John and Kathy Shoffeitt 
</P>
<P>
An insurance agent who said that she always has had an eye for interior design, 
Kathy Shoffeitt was the prime mover behind the bright, highly colorful and 
contrasting furnishings in her living room, an inviting mixture of traditional 
and understated modern pieces. She said she was inspired after studying the 
furnishings of similar model homes in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"They were decorated kind of in the way I'd envisioned, and that helped me," 
she said. "A lot of times you get into a model, and it looks absolutely 
fabulous, and then you go into the actual house -- actually move in -- and 
there are these white walls. But the decorator (of the Orange models) had the 
same feel I was looking for: a real bright, fresh look, but homey and 
comfortable. I wanted real dark woods and real light, bright fabrics, since the 
room lends itself to this. It has a lot of windows and a lot of light." 
</P>
<P>
Her first task, she said, was to decide on basic colors, and she provided 
herself with plenty of latitude. She picked a sofa with multicolored floral 
fabric covering. 
</P>
<P>
"This sofa set the tone for everything in the house," she said. "Also, I'd 
never used purples before, and it's fun using a totally different color like 
that." That color is incorporated in the sofa as well as in cloth table 
coverings in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
With such a varied pallet to work from, Shoffeitt filled the room with bursting 
colors: cushioned armchairs and an ottoman in light green-and-white companion 
fabric, a round fabric-covered lamp table, floor-standing green plants and a 
sea-foam green carpet. A square glass-topped Queen Anne coffee table is the 
centerpiece of the room, and a tall secretary in the same style anchors one 
wall. Another round lamp table also provides dark wood for contrast. 
</P>
<P>
A mirror above the couch provides depth and framed rose prints provide more 
color, along with drapes made from the same material as the couch. 
</P>
<P>
A happy plus: Shoffeitt said she found many of the items in the room at cut 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
"We went all over, and we were able to really shop the sales," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard and Helen Wilson 
</P>
<P>
The Wilsons have managed to acquire, over the years, an eclectic mix of 
furnishings with a combination of usefulness, beauty and sentimental value that 
make for a harmonious living room. There's no trick to it, Helen Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just gone with what looks good to us" -- without an attempt to have a 
homogenous style, she said. "If I find something I like, I just get it. Also, a 
lot of the pieces here have meaning for us. I think it's important to use 
things that have meaning and value." 
</P>
<P>
An antique tea cart and table in the dining room, for instance, belonged to her 
grandmother, Wilson said, and crystal pieces on the glass-topped country French 
coffee table once belonged to her great-grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 15-year-old coffee table, she noted, "that got me started on country 
French style and traditional furniture. I just like curves in the pieces and 
furniture that's fun to look at." 
</P>
<P>
But not only country French, she said. Nearly any style is fair game if it 
looks good in the room. The chess set on the coffee table, for instance, is 
African, a gift from her husband's sister. 
</P>
<P>
The brightest pieces in the room are a matching sofa and love seat covered in 
apricot fabric with a bright floral pattern. Two wing chairs in apricot sit on 
opposite sides of the room. Color is also added through use of a green-plaid 
tablecloth covering a round occasional table near the stairway. 
</P>
<P>
And there is a second tea cart next to the love seat. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I just like tea carts," Wilson said. "I feel pieces need to be 
functional." 
</P>
<P>
Several surfaces are used to display silk plants: a wall shelf above the couch, 
the tea cart, a piano, end tables and a plant shelf built into the wall halfway 
up the stairway. Two dolls also sit on that shelf, one made by her husband's 
aunt and one belonging to her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"She thinks it's important that her doll is on display," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Framed country landscapes hang above the couch, as does a dark wood regulator 
clock and an antique-style lantern. 
</P>
<P>
The room is brightened considerably by the transparent drapes and the apricot 
carpet. 
</P>
<P>
"We had hunter green carpet in our last house," Wilson said. "Here, we decided 
to lighten it up a bit. People tell me that my house looks like a grandmother's 
house, but I don't see that. I think it's homey and personal." 
</P>
<P>
John and Peggy Udink 
</P>
<P>
There is no mistaking the style of the Udinks' living room, and they make no 
bones about it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally Victorian," Peggy Udink said. 
</P>
<P>
The room revolves around two facing love seats and a pair of facing chairs that 
surround a wooden, marble-topped coffee table. The mahogany frames of each of 
the pieces are original -- they are between 125 and 130 years old -- and the 
love seats have been re-covered in a patterned, bright-gold-and-lavender fabric 
and the chairs in maroon velvet. 
</P>
<P>
All come from Alabama and were inherited from John's mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if a lot of people would like to have this kind of furniture," he 
said, "but to us they're heirlooms. I was one of four boys, and I was the one 
who was always fond of the furniture. When I was growing up, the girls I 
brought home would always goggle at my mom's furniture." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the Victorian elegance are matching glass shaded lamps sitting on 
marble-topped tables that match the coffee table. Tall, thin glass display 
cases in the Victorian style contain many of the collectibles the Udinks have 
acquired over the years. These pieces are antique reproductions, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Our theory," John Udink said, "is that you can mix and match woods and get 
away with it. Our objective is to keep the house open, even though we may not 
be totally consistent on the era (of the furnishings). Everything tends to 
blend, though. That's what we've tried to do." 
</P>
<P>
He points to an Art Deco vase against one wall as an example. Still, most of 
the accessories, such as the framed prints over one of the love seats, are 
strictly Victorian. 
</P>
<P>
Also, like the Shoffeitts and the Wilsons, the Udinks have made liberal use of 
silk plants. 
</P>
<P>
White curtains and an Oriental area rug add to the formality of the room, but 
the sea-foam green carpet keeps the overall feeling inviting. Which, Udink 
said, is the whole idea, even with such imposing furniture. 
</P>
<P>
"It's parlor-room furniture," he said, "and it's definitely not something you'd 
sit in every day. People come over, say, for drinks before we go out, and 
they'll be hesitant about sitting in it. But we'll say, 'Go on. Sit down.' 
</P>
<P>
"I imagine these things will stay in the family for years." 
</P>

CHILDREN CAN PLAY A ROLE AT THE PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN MORRIS, Karen Morris is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scene at the Childs' household in El Toro was casual bordering on chaotic. 
As public relations account executive Tracy Childs recalled a recent dinner 
with guests, he described an adult conversation punctuated with frequent 
admonitions to his sons, 3-year-old Aaron and 15-month-old Timothy: 
</P>
<P>
"Aaron, don't stand on the table." 
</P>
<P>
"Aaron, don't throw food on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
"Timothy, don't eat the food Aaron threw on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Entertaining with children requires certain adjustments, Childs pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
That has always been true. But those adjustments may be a greater challenge in 
a world where both parents work, where many first-time parents are older, where 
time is at a premium and so are baby-sitters. It's easy enough to forgo pressed 
linens and polished silver and to limit the menu to one or two courses that can 
be managed without help. But the tough question remains -- what shall we do 
with the children? 
</P>
<P>
For an increasing number of Orange County couples, the answer is, "Bring them 
along." 
</P>
<P>
Children almost always are included when Childs and his wife, Susan, get 
together with friends. While it may take some extra organizing to work around 
toddlers' prodigious energy and early bedtime, entertaining often seems simpler 
this way. 
</P>
<P>
Their preferred style always has been informal, he noted. But now, "our 
entertaining is more family-oriented -- and it starts much earlier," he said 
with a laugh. "By 7 o'clock, we're winding down." 
</P>
<P>
When childless friends are invited, they arrange to begin the evening at the 
end of the children's day, just before their 7:30 bedtime. But that doesn't 
happen often. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a whole lot of childless friends over anymore," Childs said. 
"It's hard -- they can't relate to our life style." 
</P>
<P>
It's a life style that is often out of sync with that of single friends and 
co-workers. Weekends are for families, not football games. Couples who have 
been away from their children all day are reluctant to leave them with a sitter 
(if they could find one) in the evenings. And the urban custom of waiting out 
the evening traffic jam at "happy hour" doesn't work for working parents. 
Instead of hanging around for two-for-one cocktails and free bean dip, they 
head straight home for cranberry juice and Ritz crackers with the kids. 
</P>
<P>
A Tustin pharmaceutical sales representative, however, has found a way to share 
that after-hours camaraderie with her family. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I work, I always look forward to happy hour, so usually I have it at 
my house," said Cathy Paolini. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew, 3 1/2, and Lauren, 2, enjoy the appetizers and the company almost as 
much as she does, Cathy said. 
</P>
<P>
"They love it! When I tell them company's coming, they get excited, and keep 
asking, 'Are they here yet?' " 
</P>
<P>
Paolini and her husband, Frank, service manager for an automotive services 
company in Long Beach, frequently entertain "just for fun." 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy cooking and getting people together, usually in groups of eight or 10, 
including children," she said. "Everyone raves about what I can do in a short 
amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
Typically, the Paolinis' hospitality revolves around a barbecue in the back 
yard, where the children play croquet and roast marshmallows in the fire pit 
after dinner. Occupying the little ones is easier when older children help 
entertain them, Paolini said. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably the most formal entertaining we do is with a monthly dinner group," 
she noted. 
</P>
<P>
Several couples regularly take turns hosting a formal dinner party, she 
explained. A baby-sitting pool is formed by four families who hire two sitters 
to watch all their children at one house. Videos are rented or treats are 
provided for them. Usually they are fed ahead of time, but sometimes they are 
given a meal together. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fairly inexpensive," Paolini said. "They get something special and we get 
something special." 
</P>
<P>
Something special for the children is the key to making the occasion enjoyable 
for everyone, according to Donna Alexander of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We try as much as possible to invite someone who has children when we 
entertain," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It's more fun for 3 1/2-year-old Kristen that way. And after waiting 19 years 
for their first child, Donna and her husband, Richard, aren't about to exclude 
her from gatherings with friends. 
</P>
<P>
Often the excitement of guests her own age is sufficient to keep Kristen 
entertained while her parents visit. Sometimes, however, the excitement is too 
much. 
</P>
<P>
All children misbehave before guests at times, Alexander pointed out. "It's as 
if they're thinking, 'If I'm going to be naughty, this is the time to do it.' " 
Toddlers aren't always "party people," she noted, and may not be at their best 
in a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is possible to avoid unpleasant scenes with an overstimulated child 
without giving up your social life. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing we've done is to send Kristen to manners class," Alexander 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides learning to say "please" and "thank you," she now helps serve the 
guests and performs introductions with ease. To encourage growing social skills 
within a preschooler's limits, her parents also have changed their style of 
entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
They no longer serve buffet-style at large parties as they did before Kristen 
was born. Instead, the Alexander family opts for smaller, more intimate 
sit-down dinners with one or two other families. The children sometimes eat at 
a separate table, but they have the same menu -- there is almost never any 
reason to vary the food just for children, Alexander contends. And if the 
children become restive before their parents' conversation is over, that's a 
good time to bring out dessert, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Alexander also has a backup system -- a "prize bag.". 
</P>
<P>
When there are no children to play with or Kristen begins to tire of the 
activity, "I bring out something she's absolutely never seen before. We try to 
keep new videotapes on hand, too," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander tries not to intrude on the children's fun when they are playing in 
the family room. Allowing them the freedom to wreak a little havoc there while 
adults visit in the living room "usually give us enough time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've been alone as many years as we were, a child changes your life, 
probably more than getting married did," Alexander mused. 
</P>
<P>
Her friends understand that. Many of them also waited a number of years to 
start a family and are happy to make the adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
As Alexander remarked wryly: "Friends never balk at including Kristen. I'm the 
one who gets up-tight."
