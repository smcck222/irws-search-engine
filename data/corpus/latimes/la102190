The Searchers (TBS Monday at 5 p.m.). One of the most beautiful epic Westerns 
and one of the most influential films of all time, this 1956 John Ford film is 
the classic trek movie in which John Wayne embarks on a long odyssey in search 
of his niece (Natalie Wood) captured by Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Woman of the Year (Channel 5 Wednesday at 2 a.m.) This 1942 hit, written by 
Ring Lardner Jr. and Michael Kanin and directed by George Stevens, marked the 
first teaming of Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy; Hepburn is a major 
political columnist -- her character is patterned after Dorothy Thompson -- and 
Tracy is the sportswriter who cuts her down to size. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic City (Channel 13 Wednesday at 10 a.m.) Director Louis Malle and writer 
John Guare tell the stories of dreamers that the resort of Atlantic City 
attracts as if they were fairy tales; the amusing, enchanting result is one of 
the key films of the '80s. Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon star. 
</P>
<P>
The Narrow Margin (TNT Thursday at 9 p.m.) Ingenious 1952 film noir thriller, 
directed crisply by Richard Fleischer, starring Charles McGraw as the decent, 
reflective cop assigned to escort hard-as-nails Marie Windsor on the train from 
Chicago to Los Angeles.

No one understands comedy and television better than Carol Burnett. There's 
certainly no better person to keep NBC on the top. Making sure that her "Carol 
&amp; Company" series is a consistent winner and promoting the show each week 
should be a priority for the network.

I watched with growing dismay the CBS movie debut of "E.A.R.T.H. Force" (not 
presently on CBS' schedule). 
</P>
<P>
Plutonium bandits? Assault rifles? Paramilitary operations? The producers of 
this farce are clueless to the meaning and practice of "environmentalism." 
</P>
<P>
If the hours of Environmental Impact Statement reading, public hearings and 
conferences supportive to a legitimate program of "Ecodefense" are insufficient 
to enrapture television viewers nationwide, so be it. Should the program 
survive I propose a name change to "G.R.E.E.N. Scam" -- a term applied to the 
prostitution of "environmentalism" for personal or political gain.

GARIEL GARCIA MARQUEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Gabo Talks" quotes Garcia Marquez as saying: "Rome labored in a gloom for 20 
centuries, until an Etruscan king anchored it in history." Rome was founded in 
756 BC; about a century later, Lucius Tarquinius, a Roman citizen of 
Graeco-Etruscan origin, was elected; his last descendant, Tarquinius Superbus, 
was deposed in 508 BC, and Rome became a republic. 
</P>
<P>
Rome assimilated peoples and cultures and drew from the knowledge and 
technology of older Mediterranean civilizations to reach its greatness. The 
United States did it by absorbing various cultures and catalyzing them into a 
new and stronger one. 
</P>
<P>
This is what Latin America has been unable to do. It has failed to build onto 
its great indigenous civilizations and the cultures of its conquerors. Five 
centuries after the European conquest, Latin America is still Third World. How 
long does it take to recover from a brutal invasion? Through his character 
Marquez whines, "Let us have our Middle Ages in peace." Despite devastating, 
recurring bouts of Black Death, the European Middle Ages was a period teeming 
with vitality: Men built soaring cathedrals and great walled cities, stimulated 
commerce, developed industrial innovations and above all produced great 
leaders. If this is indeed Latin America's Middle Ages, it is one of 
corruption, bankruptcy and social injustice. 
</P>
<P>
Marquez latest book shatters the myth of Simon Bolivar. But despite his newly 
discovered flatulence and pedophilia, Bolivar was a man of vision and action. 
Where are Latin America's great leaders of today? Castro? 
</P>
<P>
Men and nations cannot hope to improve their lot until they recognize their own 
shortcomings. Latin America will never achieve its potentials as long as it 
continues to blame the United States for all its ills.

PRIVATE LIVES: OFF THE INSIDE TRACK; 
</P>
<P>
IF YOU HAVE TO ASK WHETHER YOU'RE IN THE LOOP, YOU CAN BE SURE YOU'RE OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WHERE DOES THIS loop everyone keeps talking about come from? It reminds me of 
those mysterious circles from outer space that television stations short of 
news are now finding in cornfields. "They form at night when nobody is 
looking," an investigative reporter recently explained solemnly on camera. 
</P>
<P>
Why not? Every morning, I read the newspaper and learn the latest high-level 
loop scoop. James Baker is in the loop. Gen. Dugan got kicked out of the loop 
for leaking loop poop. President Bush is always in the loop except when the 
loop is doing something unfortunate, like writing blank checks to S &amp; L 
operators, at which point he is temporarily unlooped. 
</P>
<P>
As for me, my answering machine just has messages from my dry cleaner, copy 
editor and grandmother, none of whom were seeking my opinion about a major 
offensive in Saudi Arabia. The cleaner did want to know if I'd assume 
responsibility for laundering an embroidered white blouse. Does that make me a 
player? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the loop is a lot bigger than the power circle in Washington. It's 
bigger than the power circles in every major city combined. The loop has to be 
at least the size of the Equator. Because almost everybody wants to be in it. 
</P>
<P>
"I worship the loop," says my sister, Laurie, a publicist who eats, sleeps and 
breathes inside information. "The loop is power. It's knowing what's going to 
be on the front page of the New York Times two days before it happens. It's 
getting a jump on things." She puts me on hold for the 14th time in our phone 
conversation. "This might be a call that puts me even further into the loop," 
she explains. 
</P>
<P>
Gosh, and last night I had yet another humiliating out-of-loop experience. I 
was at a screening, the film was late in starting and a woman behind me was 
getting frantic. "If this doesn't begin soon, I'll miss the Steven Wright 
special," she complained. 
</P>
<P>
Forgive me, Steven Wright, but I didn't know who you were. I go to bed early, 
so I'm out of talk-show loops. I'm not hooked up, so I'm out of the cable loop. 
I actually had to utter "Steven Who?" -- a cardinal sin in the Age of 
Information. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to be in the loop when you're a free-lancer," Laurie says smugly. 
"You're like the little house on the prairie." 
</P>
<P>
I think it's better that way. Many people spend an awful lot of energy playing 
a cutthroat version of "Here We Go Loop de Loo" -- getting in the loop, staying 
in the loop, bumping another person out of the loop. Sure, the rewards can be 
amazing. But no matter how good you get at the game, there's always someone 
more on top of it than you. 
</P>
<P>
"The loop is a circular argument that keeps what goes around from coming back 
around," my friend David says. 
</P>
<P>
"Wondering if you're out of the loop is a big pastime in corporate America," 
says Doug, who did hard time in an advertising agency. He tells me an 
"absolutely true story" about a Paranoid Group Head (P. G. H.) who became 
loop-obsessed. 
</P>
<P>
"The president of the agency sends out a memo to a bunch of people," he 
recalls. "And in the distribution list some people have asterisks next to their 
name. At the bottom it says '* group head.' Only P. G. H. doesn't have an 
asterisk. And he panics. He's sure he's falling down on the job. He walks 
around the office asking everyone what we think having no asterisk means. We 
say it's probably nothing, but if he really has a problem he should ask the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally the paranoia is too much for him. So he asks. And the president plays 
it perfectly. He says, 'It's just a mistake.' Now P. G. H. knows he's out of 
the loop. If you have to ask, you are." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the loop is like a computer virus that keeps making copies of itself 
until it fills up the whole memory. There must be zillions of loops: the 
Literary Loop, the Ex-Hippie Loop, the Society Loop, the Industry Loop, the 
Hairdresser Loop, the Fitness Loop, the Art Loop -- all the way down to the 
In-Law Loop. Pretty soon we're going to run out of loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're trying to be in the loop, you suffer anxiety all the time," says 
Marjorie, who is super-connected. "Anything I see that leaves me out seems to 
be worth penetrating." Well, almost anything. She does admit that the Private 
School Loop seems to be more of a noose. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a lot of time to devote to working for my son's school," Marjorie 
says. "All the parents participate in certain activities. And if you're not in 
the loop, you go there and drift around doing odd jobs and see that everyone is 
friends except you. It's like re-creating your own school years. Still, if I 
went to all the meetings that would get me in that loop, I'd never have time to 
see my kid." 
</P>
<P>
Where does the loop come from? 
</P>
<P>
Why should I tell you?

THE COWBOY AND THE GOOD OL' GIRL; 
</P>
<P>
IN AN ERA OF BLAND POLITICS, CLAYTIE WILLIAMS AND ANN RICHARDS ARE BRAWLING, 
DOWN AND DIRTY, IN TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, J. Michael Kennedy is the Houston bureau chief of The 
Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CLAYTON WILLIAMS JR., in a pricey gray business suit and straw summer cowboy 
hat, strides toward the several hundred people gathered at the Circle R Ranch 
in Flower Mound, a bedroom community north of Dallas. He flashes his 
face-splitting grin and begins his meeting-and-greeting, running-for-governor 
routine, part of which is kissing just about every woman who comes within arm's 
reach and having his picture taken with the ladies, always with his thumb 
pointed toward the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
His voice sounds like heavy-duty sandpaper against rough wood as he makes his 
way to the head table: "How're you? Glad to see you. Thanks for coming by." 
</P>
<P>
Once seated, he flips his tie back, licks his fingers and digs into a plate of 
barbecue with a plastic knife and fork. His hat rests on the table in front of 
him, and a growing bald spot at the back of his head is revealed. True, 
Williams is the star attraction, but there are other matters to be discussed 
before he takes the speaker's stand, namely, the upcoming Western Week 
celebration in neighboring Lewisville. 
</P>
<P>
A young blond woman holds forth for an eternity, introducing the Western Week 
grand marshal and other dignitaries and gushes about the booths, dance groups, 
gunfight shows and chalk art being prepared for the big event. When Williams 
finally gets behind the microphone, he begins the speech that marks his every 
stop. "Hold on to your seats," he tells the crowd. "I'm liable to be your 
governor." 
</P>
<P>
Then, predictably, comes the yarn of Williams' early years in Fort Stockton, 
the largest dot on the map between San Antonio and El Paso, of how he played 
halfback for the Fort Stockton Panthers. Williams pauses at this point because 
he knows he's going to get them with this one. 
</P>
<P>
"They were small and, boy, they were slow," he says of his team, anticipating 
with relish the punch line that has become a permanent fixture in his 
repertoire. "We had a 5-5 record -- " Long pause. "We lost five on the road and 
we lost five at home." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd laughs appreciatively, as it always does. He ticks off his spiel 
about how -- without any new taxes -- he plans to mount a war on drugs like no 
one has ever seen: beefing up law enforcement, doubling prison space and 
sending first offenders to boot camp for rigorous, military-style training. All 
of which is the setup for the line that put Clayton Williams here, delivered in 
his most sincere voice: "Gov. Clayton Williams is going to introduce them to 
the joys of bustin' rocks!" 
</P>
<P>
The crowd really goes for that one, applauding and whooping it up. Those words, 
first spoken in one of his television commercials, are the ones that propelled 
Williams out of political obscurity, turning him from just one of many 
millionaires in the dusty West Texas city of Midland to the odds-on favorite in 
the Texas gubernatorial race. He has gotten this far solely on the strength of 
images, of television commercials and crowd-pleasing speeches. For the 
59-year-old Republican, the governorship is the ultimate trophy to hunt down 
and add to his collection; the heads of the many big-game animals he has shot 
crowd his office walls. He is going after it with all of his trademark zest. 
Now all he has to do is beat Ann Richards. 
</P>
<P>
IT'S A TAKE-YOUR-COAT-OFF DAY, A SCORCHER, THE WAY IT always is just before 
summer turns to autumn in Fort Worth. Texas State Treasurer Ann Richards is 
standing in front of a gate at the General Dynamics plant, where, inside the 
cavernous hangars, an army of workers builds F-16 fighter jets. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that one of the prerequisites for the job of governor is having to 
stand on the edge of the broiling parking lot at the 3:30 p.m. shift change. 
Richards, in a pink-and-white checked skirt, her swirled white hair absolutely 
immovable as always, braces herself as she is almost trampled underfoot by the 
wave of workers who crash through the gate, racing for their cars. 
</P>
<P>
"Good to see you," says Richards, handing a campaign brochure to a plant 
worker. "I'm Ann Richards, and I'm running for governor." The woman accepts the 
brochure with no hint of recognition. But there are others who recognize 
Richards at once, like the man wearing "Another Man for Ann" T-shirt and Brenda 
Brimer, a procurement analyst at the plant and a member of the Texas Democratic 
Party Executive Committee. The two women hug; they have known each other for 
years. Brimer once gave Richards a coffee cup inscribed: "Behind every 
successful woman is a surprised man." 
</P>
<P>
From early morning, Richards, 57, has been pressing the flesh, first in San 
Antonio, then in Fort Worth. Dallas is on the evening calendar. She has been at 
full tilt since late August, when most politicians were working the 
fund-raising circuit and resting up for the grueling campaign stretch. She has 
good reason. The most-recent polls showed her to be more than 10 percentage 
points behind Williams. 
</P>
<P>
The man is an absolute political neophyte. She has been a successful public 
servant for 14 years. Yet she is the underdog. But this is the quintessential 
down-and-dirty media campaign, and experience has little to do with anything. 
</P>
<P>
Although still battle-weary from a primary in which her opponents accused her 
of, among other things, having a history of mental illness and cocaine use, she 
has no intention of losing the governorship to a quasi-cowboy who has built 
himself almost entirely out of TV commercials and canned speeches. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to have more than pretty pictures and catchy slogans on 
television," she tells a cheering crowd. "We won't be solving many of our 
problems in 30 seconds of prime time." 
</P>
<P>
WILLIAMS IS AN OILMAN and ranch owner who arrived on the political scene last 
year with a pumped-up wallet and some of the slickest TV commercials ever seen 
in the state. His detractors often refer to him as the "Donald Trump of Texas" 
because he's such an unabashed self-promoter; his friends call him Claytie. He 
doesn't own a pair of shoes -- only cowboy boots -- and he once rode a horse up 
the steps of the state capitol as a publicity stunt for a telephone company he 
once owned. 
</P>
<P>
Give Williams a couple of beers and he'll croon some of his Spanish favorites 
-- or get in a fistfight. During the primary he was accused of playing to the 
"Bubba vote." Williams replied without missing a beat: "I am Bubba." 
</P>
<P>
Running against Bubba is, of all things, a woman. Richards was catapulted into 
the national spotlight with her keynote address at the 1988 Democratic National 
Convention -- the one with the wicked line about George Bush's being "born with 
a silver foot in his mouth." Richards is a member in good standing of what 
Williams derisively calls "that Austin crowd," which over the years has 
included some of the state's best-known writers, musicians and left-leaning 
thinkers. She has survived alcoholism and a failed marriage to become one of 
the state's most popular politicians, much of it on the strength of her 
considerable wit and skill as an orator. 
</P>
<P>
Richards and Williams are a formidable duo even by Texas' larger-than-life 
standards, and theirs is unquestionably the most colorful race of the year; the 
California race between Pete Wilson and Dianne Feinstein has been positively 
genteel in contrast. The verbal sparrings between Williams and Richards are 
frequent and fierce, with no apology from either side -- at one point, Williams 
said he was going to tie up Richards like a calf and "drag her through the 
dirt." The Williams people are doing their best to portray Richards as some 
kind of pointy-headed liberal, a gay-lesbian sympathizer with questionable 
patriotism who, among other things, committed the sin of accepting money from 
Jane Fonda. He has attempted to paint her as part of the Hollywood crowd and an 
accomplice in the savings and loan scandal, and claims she is weak on crime and 
supported by Death Row inmates. 
</P>
<P>
The Richards people, meanwhile, are trying to put chinks in Williams' 
son-of-the-earth routine, calling him a junk bond peddler and a polluter, a man 
who's as ignorant as a box of rocks when it comes to state government. In a 
recent speech, Richards derided Williams as "some media cowboy who rides off 
into the sunset and kisses the horse instead of the girl." Her camp has 
depicted Williams as a businessman with serious financial problems, including 
failure to pay his employees, and has accused him of fraud and price-fixing. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most shameless groaners of the race came in late September. Shortly 
after a Houston Chronicle poll showed Richards losing by 15 percentage points, 
her camp claimed that she was only six points behind. "I hope she didn't go 
back to drinking again," Williams said to reporters in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Later, by way of clarification, Claytie-style, he added, "Well, she's running 
for governor of Texas, not mayor of San Francisco." He refused to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
A Richards spokesman countered by calling Williams a "fraudulent, honking 
goose." 
</P>
<P>
It has been a campaign of symbols -- the rugged cowboy and the spunky lady 
duking it out. This, after all, is Texas, where politics is blood sport, where 
down-and-dirty tactics are a tradition, where Lyndon Johnson won a 1948 Senate 
race by withholding a ballot box until he could be sure he had the votes to 
win. But despite its entertainment value, there is a growing sentiment that 
this year's contest is a low-road comedy that has turned the state into a 
political laughingstock. Following on the heels of a horrendous and 
well-publicized mudslinging primary, the Williams-Richards race seems 
anachronistic to many Texans who want a different image of their state: that of 
a forward-thinking place suitable for high-tech investment. 
</P>
<P>
A popular joke goes like this: Clayton Williams and Ann Richards are on a life 
raft that's sinking. Who will be saved? Answer: The people of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
There is more than a little bitterness behind the humor. In this battle of 
personalities, the issues have become secondary. And in a state with more than 
its share of major problems, that is no laughing matter. In a recent editorial, 
the Dallas Morning News chided both candidates for "trading 30-second lies and 
half-truths over the airwaves" when they should be "doing more to describe 
their vision of Texas' future." And Jack Loftis, editor of the Houston 
Chronicle, the largest paper in the state, is so disappointed with both 
candidates that the paper may not endorse either one. 
</P>
<P>
Williams and Richards have squared off in a bid to replace Gov. Bill Clements, 
a Republican who, like Williams, made his fortune in the oil business. He took 
office for a second term four years ago and then practically disappeared after 
his role in the Southern Methodist University football scandal was revealed. 
Clements knew about players being paid when he was president of the SMU board 
of governors, but opted not to report it. 
</P>
<P>
During those four years, Texas fought to recover from the fiscal flogging it 
suffered during the oil bust. The recent dramatic rise in the price of oil has 
helped some sectors of the economy but is by no means a panacea. The state 
finds itself with a tenuous economy, bulging prisons, a school system under 
court order to reorganize its funding distribution, and two candidates who 
swear there will be no new taxes, no matter what. Williams has made the war on 
drugs the central theme of his campaign, is against abortion except to save the 
life of the mother and has vowed to trim bureaucracy to the bone. Richards, who 
supports the legal right to abortion, has taken a number of positions, from 
rekindling the economy to insurance reform. She has, in fact, been criticized 
for tackling too many issues instead of choosing a few key points and hammering 
on them. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Richards is a woman affects the campaign, but not as much as one 
would think; Texas, despite its macho image, is not loathe to hand women the 
reins of power. Thestate's five largest cities have had women mayors recently; 
four are still in office. But analysts expect the gender gap will make a 
difference on Election Day. Currently, Williams holds a 10- to 15-point lead in 
public statewide polls (although about one-third of the voters strongly oppose 
him). He is running as much as 30 points ahead among men, while among women 
voters, he and Richards are about even. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes are high. A Republican win will show once and for all that the state 
is no longer a Democratic cornerstone. For generations, Texas politics was 
mostly decided at the Democratic primary; the Republican Party was almost 
non-existent. But as the state grew by more than 6 million people during the 
past 20 years, Republicans made great strides. Texas voters do not have to 
register by party, but primary voting figuresindicate things have changed. In 
the 1978 primary, 158,403 Republicans voted versus 1.8 million Democrats. In 
the 1990 primary, 852,121 Republicans voted, as contrasted with 1.4 million 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Texas now is a genuine two-party state, and the Republicans are hoping to show 
that traditional Democratic claims -- that Democrats were the party o the 
working class and that Republicans are fat-cat elitists -- are no longer true. 
And the political party of the governor probably will fare better in the 
redistricting sweepstakes next year when Texas should get at least three new 
members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
For Ann Richards, the race has one more prize -- she would like to prove that a 
woman can be governor of a state that rather likes its image as a place where 
cowboys ride into the sunset. A Richards win would help fulfill widespread 
predictions that 1990 would be the year of women in politics. 
</P>
<P>
Winning in Texas is a Herculean task, given the state's size and diversity -- 
its population is expected to surpass New York's by 1992. It takes a candidate 
with a serious chunk of cash -- and the stamina of a lumberjack -- to put the 
message out from El Paso to Texarkana. But Williams finds himself in the 
enviable position of being a bona fide political phenomenon. He has spent 
almost twice as much money as Richard has, including $6 million of his own 
considerable fortune. So far, it's been one of the best investments he's ever 
made. 
</P>
<P>
ONE THING ABOUT CLAYtie, he'll try to make good use of most anything, even 
something that looks like it should work against him. As he was talking to the 
Flower Mound crowd, a cuss word was on the end of his tongue when he reeled it 
back in. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm working on my language," he said slyly to the crowd. "And I'm not going to 
be talking any more about the women." 
</P>
<P>
Williams' comments about women -- more specifically, the subjects of rape and 
whorehouses -- have gotten him in trouble before. During a branding session at 
a cow camp in the aftermath of his primary victory, Williams jokingly said that 
the drizzly weather was like rape -- "If it's inevitable, just relax and enjoy 
it." A few days later he admitted to a Houston Post reporter that, as a 
teen-ager, he had gone to Mexican border towns to be "serviced" by hookers. 
</P>
<P>
When these Texas-sized gaffes hit the media, all hell broke loose. Twice. The 
calls and letters to the editor came flooding in, and Williams ended up 
apologizing for each. But, in fact, the two remarks were in character with the 
way Williams talks and acts. He probably wouldn't have given either quip a 
second thought, except for the fact that he was caught in the glare of the 
campaign trail with reporters standing nearby instead of just a bunch of ranch 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
From that moment on, Williams' campaign changed, even though polls showed the 
gaffes had not registered much on the Texas outrage meter. He became a man who 
no longer wanders too far from the script, whose discussions with the press are 
restricted to a few minutes of questions and answers after a speech before he 
is hustled off by his handlers. He almost never gives any lengthy interviews, 
not like the days of the primary when the prevailing attitude was to just let 
Claytie be Claytie. 
</P>
<P>
Williams never has behaved quite like most folks. Take, for instance, his 
devotion to his alma mater, Texas A &amp; M University. Texas has a fair number 
of Aggie zealots, but Williams carries it to the extreme. The swimming pool at 
one of his 12 ranches is in the shape of the knee-high boot worn by the 
military cadets of A &amp; M, and beside the pool is the Aggie logo that once 
adorned the 50-yard line of the university's Kyle Field. And the alumni 
building at the university is named for Williams, on the strength of his 
$2.5-million donation to the school. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was born in the West Texas town of Alpine and grew up in nearby (by 
Texas standards) Fort Stockton. Despite Williams' homespun mannerisms, he comes 
from a well-educated background. His grandfather graduated from Harvard. His 
father was a farmer and a county commissioner who owned the biggest house in 
town. But Clayton Sr. was most famous perhaps for pumping Fort Stockton's 
Commanche Springs bone dry to irrigate his land, much to the detriment of other 
farmers downstream. 
</P>
<P>
When Williams finished college with a degree in animal husbandry and did his 
stint in the army, he became an insurance salesman. That was a passing fancy on 
his way to the oil and gas business. His first well didn't come in until 1959, 
and not until 1975 did he really hit pay dirt with a well in Loving County that 
produced $50,000 worth of natural gas a day. Along the way, he married, 
fathered two daughters, then divorced in 1964. He met his second wife, Modesta, 
a year later at one of his favorite Midland watering holes; they have a 
daughter and two adopted sons. 
</P>
<P>
After almost three decades in the energy business, Williams very nearly went 
belly up in the oil bust of the '80s. His fortune has suffered considerably, 
but most estimates put it around $150 million. He operates 12 ranches and a 
farm -- 481,750 acres in all -- in Texas and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
Williams has a penchant for grand gestures. This is a man who used to give a 
party each year with 8,000 guests to auction off his prized Brangus cattle. In 
1984, each cow was adorned with a $6,000 string of pearls while it was paraded 
before the guests. When toddler Jessica McClure fell down a Midland well in 
1987, Williams sent his jet to Colorado to fly in the best engineers to dig her 
out. But Williams didn't really earn statewide attention until 1988, when he 
starred in a series of television commercials for his telephone company, 
ClayDesta Communications. Suddenly, Clayton Williams, riding a horse and 
wearing a weathered cowboy hat, was in living rooms across Texas. Looking like 
a cross between his hero, John Wayne, and the Marlboro Man, he peered into the 
camera and said: "Picking the best long distance for your money is like picking 
a good cow. Breed her with your best bull, and you've got quality." 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, veteran political consultant and lobbyist George Christian was 
surprised by a call from Williams. He asked Christian his views on Williams 
entering the primary. 
</P>
<P>
"For lack of anything better to say, I told him, 'I guess you'd be a wild 
card,' " Christian says. "And he said, 'I like that. I like being the wild 
card.' Frankly, I didn't think he had a chance." 
</P>
<P>
And then came the announcement for governor and, with it, more polished ads, 
including the now-famous "bustin' rocks" commercial. Williams caught everyone 
off guard by walloping the primary opponents -- all of whom were experienced, 
credible candidates -- with 61% of the vote. His brilliant media strategies 
blew everyone else out of the water. In a campaign focused on each candidates' 
level of enthusiasm for exercising the death penalty, image won resoundingly 
over substance. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got the nerve of a daylight bank robber," says his friend of 20 years, 
oilman Ted Collins. "He's not afraid of the devil." 
</P>
<P>
As Williams finishes his Flower Mound speech, he tells the folks that he once 
was admonished during a political debate that he couldn't ride a horse into the 
21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you can, too, if you ride a good horse," he says. Then he declares that 
he intends to "put my foot in the stirrup, pull out my rope and lasso that 
bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
Williams steps away from the platform and is about to sit down when something 
occurs to him. He steps back up to the mike. 
</P>
<P>
"And one more thing, folks. To be a good governor, you've got to be a good 
salesman, and I once sold life insurance. If you can talk a fella into taking 
his beer money and putting it into a life insurance premium so when he dies his 
wife can live happily ever after with another man -- I'm telling you, I'm a 
pretty good salesman." 
</P>
<P>
ANN RICHARDS is nearing the end of another long day in East Texas, once a land 
of "yellow dog Democrats" -- people who would rather vote for a yellow dog than 
a Republican -- now considered swing-vote country. 
</P>
<P>
She started with a group of supporters at Sam Houston State University in 
Huntsville, moved on to a reception at the Conroe Rotary, slept for an hour on 
the drive, visited with supporters at the Dayton Library and ended up in 
Liberty, the county seat. 
</P>
<P>
Here, she works the courthouse halls, shaking hands with one old codger who had 
no idea who the gubernatorial candidates are. Working the courthouse has been a 
part of Texas politics for generations, as is the perfunctory picture-taking 
with the county judge. 
</P>
<P>
Richards then delivers a little speech to the dozen or so supporters who sit on 
the court benches, telling them to go out and tell the teachers of the county 
that she is their only hope. It is short, succinct and personal. Unlike 
Williams, whose road managers delight in reeling off his next line before he 
does, Richards tailors her speeches to the audience. In Huntsville, the central 
theme is education. In Conroe, it's business opportunities for the state. She 
tells the people of Dayton she would oppose a proposal to inject hazardous 
waste in nearby salt domes. 
</P>
<P>
At each speech, it is as if she flicks a switch and the words come out just so. 
After the primary, Richards was tired and her speeches were flat, but that has 
changed. On many occasions, she chastises Williams for inexplicably declining 
to be on the same stage with her, much less debate her. The closest thing to a 
direct confrontation was in Victoria, where Richards berated Williams for 
running a radio commercial she later described as a string of "mean-spirited 
and unfair" accusations. Williams backpedaled and aw-shucked his way out of the 
jam. 
</P>
<P>
At the Liberty Whataburger, where she sips a cup of coffee, Richards is asked 
whether the political arena is worth the brutality. Her opponent in the primary 
runoff, Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox -- a mean campaigner even by Texas standards -- 
steered a course that political pollster George Shipley described as "the outer 
edge of nuclear politics." Mattox tried to label Richards not only as a 
recovering alcoholic -- which she readily admits -- but also as someone who had 
been a drug abuser -- possibly of cocaine. Richards had stonily refused to 
answer the charge. That episode had been followed by a spate of negative ads 
from the Williams camp that kept her on the defensive. Only recently has her 
campaign evolved a more positive approach. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I like it? No. Do I want to participate? No. Do I want to govern? Yes. This 
is what I have to do to pay my dues." she says, visibly weary despite protests 
to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
And what did she think of Mattox? "I think Mattox did everything he could to 
win the race. It wasn't personal." 
</P>
<P>
That there has been some wear and tear is obvious. At one point in the 
campaign, Richards became so testy with the media that her irritability became 
the object of articles and columns in the state's newspapers. It was the first 
time she ever received bad press. Some of those who voiced the criticism had 
known Richards for years and considered her more than an acquaintance. They 
couldn't understand the change, though the reason seems simple: This is the 
first time Richards has been a decided underdog. 
</P>
<P>
Funny how things worked out. She wouldn't even have run for governor had not 
two of her best friends in politics -- Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby and former San 
Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros -- decided not to run. Instead, 1990 would have 
been the year she ran for lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
Then came her nationally televised speech at the Democratic Convention. 
Suddenly, Richards was the darling of the Democratic Party. Her ability to 
raise money increased dramatically. "When I looked over the field, I knew that 
running for governor made much more sense," she says. (Williams, 
characteristically, uses even that famous speech to his advantage, frequently 
chastising her for being disloyal to a fellow Texan.) 
</P>
<P>
Richards also stresses her country roots. She says "that dog won't hunt" 
(referring to something that won't work) enough to make it a candidate for 
cliche of the year. Her 1989 autobiography, "Straight from the Heart," is 
written in a folksy way that drips with syrup. 
</P>
<P>
Richards grew up in Lakeview, a small town just outside Waco in Central Texas, 
the daughter of a pharmaceuticals salesman; Dorothy Ann Willis was what she was 
called then. "If my Mama and Daddy didn't put a lot of stock in scholarship, 
they greatly valued personality," she wrote in her book. "I was always 
encouraged to perform. . . . I learned early on that people liked you if you 
told stories, if you made them laugh." 
</P>
<P>
When it was time for Dorothy Ann to go to high school, the family decided to 
move to Waco so that she could get a proper education. On the first day of 
class, she dropped the Dorothy. And she went around and introduced herself to 
every person in her class. 
</P>
<P>
From high school, it was across town to Baylor, the largest Southern Baptist 
university in the world, known throughout Texas as "Jerusalem-on-the-Brazos." 
Richards won a debating scholarship. One year after two male members of the 
debating team had been sent to a tournament at Notre Dame, Richards walked into 
the office of coach Glenn Capp. How come, she asked, you only send male 
students out of town? Richards and another woman debater got the next 
out-of-town trip, Capp recalls, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
At 19, Ann Willis married David Richards, whom she had dated since high school. 
For the next 20 years or so, Ann Richards was a devoted wife and mother of 
four, teaching high school to put David through law school. 
</P>
<P>
David became a prominent labor lawyer. Their homes, first in Dallas and later 
in Austin, were hothouses of liberal politics, a rare thing in Texas in those 
days. Ann was the envelope stuffer, David was the star. But Ann became involved 
in the campaigns of women making their first bids for political office in 
Austin. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1975, a group asked David to run for county commissioner. David was 
not interested. Ann was. She won the election with ease in 1976 and has 
remained in public office since. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Richards' life took a dramatic new direction -- as she became more 
independent, she and David went through a long and painful period of growing 
apart. They divorced in 1984, after almost 30 years of marriage. There was 
another problem as well: Richards' drinking was getting out of hand. Her friend 
Bill Kugle, an East Texas lawyer, remembers when he, Richards and a group of 
friends drove a Winnebago to Georgia to go canoeing. Everyone else drank beer. 
Richards was drinking straight vodka all the way. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't notice that much, though, because everyone else was drinking at the 
time," Kugle says. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, the drinking only added to Richards' boisterous reputation -- with 
a couple in her she was likely to err on the side of the outrageous. Molly 
Ivins, now a columnist with the Dallas Times Herald and no shrinking violet 
herself, recalls an incident in the mid-1970s at a huge political to-do at 
Scholtz Beer Garten in Austin. The cast included Ivins, Richards, state 
Comptroller Bob Bullock -- all white -- and Charlie Miles, then Bullock's 
director of personnel, who is black. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us got the tired feet," Ivins says. "We were leaning our butts up 
against the table like birds in a row. Well, up comes this ol' racist East 
Texas judge to Bullock, and they commence to slapping backs and meetin' and 
greetin' and Bullock says, 'Judge, I want you to meet some of my friends. This 
is Molly Ivins of the Texas Observer.' 
</P>
<P>
"And the judge said, 'How yew, little lady?' And then Bullock introduced 
Charlie Miles. That judge just looked at him as if he had just stepped into a 
fresh cow pie. After a long while, the judge stuck out his hand so it touched 
Charlie's for about a fraction of a second. Then he said, 'How yew, boy?' 
</P>
<P>
"And then the judge turned to Ann, the pretty, blond, blue-eyed woman standing 
next to Miles. 'And who is this lovely lady?' the judge asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Ann just beamed and said, 'I am Mrs. Miles.' " 
</P>
<P>
One afternoon in 1980, Richards was invited to the house of a friend. When she 
stepped inside, unsuspecting, she looked around to see David and many of her 
best friends. They confronted her about her drinking. And in the end she 
checked into St. Mary's Hospital in Minneapolis for a monthlong treatment 
program for alcoholism. She has been dry, she says, ever since. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Richards again was drafted to run for office, this time for the post 
of state treasurer. She won easily, becoming the first woman to hold a 
statewide office in 50 years. Her most notable achievement was bringing the 
state treasury from the dark ages of accounting to the era of computers. Her 
reelection four years later was even more resounding. 
</P>
<P>
BUT THIS YEAR is a different story. Even Richards' most ardent supporters admit 
that she might not win the race. Garry Mauro, the Democratic state lands 
commissioner and an astute observer of the Texas political scene, says the only 
way Richards can win is to perform brilliantly in the last two weeks of the 
campaign, particularly in the quality of her television advertising. "It will 
come down to whose TV is best," he says simply. 
</P>
<P>
Although Williams has the lead, he has not escaped unscathed. Some of the 
rugged-cowboy image has deteriorated as the weeks have turned into months. 
Thanks in part to pollster George Shipley's office, retained by the Richards 
campaign to dig up dirt on Williams, questions have been raised about Williams' 
business past. 
</P>
<P>
While ClayDesta Communications may have made Williams a star, it is hardly a 
venture that he can point to as an example of his business savvy. When he sold 
the company last year, he did so at a loss of $15 million. Shipley's 88-page 
document, "Meet the Real Clayton Williams," also reveals that Williams has been 
sued dozens of times (almost all the suits were settled before the campaign 
began), including one by a plaintiff who claimed that it was his idea to start 
the long-distance telephone company. That version is a far cry from the one 
Williams has been telling for years in which -- with typical, can-do spirit -- 
he started the company when angered by the fact that a new tenant in his 
ClayDesta Plaza business park could not get his telephones installed for 
several months. The suit was settled last year for an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Williams just keeps moving along, the Teflon cowboy. Several days after 
his visit to Flower Mound, Williams and his entourage are walking across the 
square at predominantly black Texas Southern University in Houston. He has 
seized the opportunity to visit the campus after Hobby, the lieutenant 
governor, suggested that the school be closed. The scene is an odd one. Here is 
a conservative Republican coming in to act as savior after the liberal 
lieutenant governor has criticized the school for offering substandard 
education. In a conference room upstairs, microphones have been set up. 
Williams walks in and glances at the sparse crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"Howdy, gang," he hollers. 
</P>
<P>
From the back of the room comes a small but firm female voice: "We are not a 
gang," a student says testily. 
</P>
<P>
After a short speech offering the school his support, Williams fields 
questions. One student raises his hand and makes an impassioned plea for the 
survival of his school. In passing, the young man also mentions that he's on 
the football team. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' eyes light up. Here is his chance. "I was an athlete, a fullback," he 
says, breaking into his crescent moon of a grin. "We went 5-5 -- five losses on 
the road, five at home."

<P>
ROOTED IN CALIFORNIA'S RUSTIC PAST, THIS STYLE OF FURNITURE HAS A BRIGHT FUTURE 
IN THE COLLECTIBLES MARKET 
</P>

<P>
When baby boomers were kids, a well-decorated, middle-class ranch house in 
Southern California wasn't complete without a touch of the Wild West: a 
wagon-wheel sofa or maybe bunk beds with cowboy-and-Indian-patterned spreads. 
</P>
<P>
This faux cowboy chic has long been considered kitsch. But now collectors and 
historians are re-evaluating the style and -- hold on to your hat, Roy Rogers 
-- ranking a few California Rancho pieces with Craftsman collectibles. The 
rustically romantic style began with the furniture for the adobe ranchos of the 
area's earliest Spanish and Mexican settlers. Then, in 1915, a Spanish Colonial 
architectural theme was selected for the Panama-California International 
Exposition in San Diego. Fueled by an infatuation with the Hollywood Western as 
well as the need to furnish thousands of newly built Craftsman and Spanish 
bungalows, the style flourished. 
</P>
<P>
Barker Bros. introduced California Rancho furniture in 1929. The designer, 
George Mason, created the 120-piece Monterey line based on a photo of a settee 
from the movie "Old Arizona," plus a few inspirational visits to the California 
missions. This furniture, produced until the early '40s, is recognizable -- and 
highly collectible today -- because early pieces were branded just like cattle. 
</P>
<P>
Other furniture lines followed: Coronado by Angelus Furniture Co. (Barker 
Bros.' biggest rival), Montecito, Forest, Ranch-o and La Fiesta. All the 
furniture was sturdy, with roughed-up finishes to make pieces appear as though 
they had been dragged overland. Some pieces were hand-painted and sported rope 
seats and wrought-iron straps; many were branded or stenciled with designs 
including horseshoes and palm trees. In 1988, the style gained legitimacy with 
the Santa Monica Heritage Museum exhibition "Monterey: California Rancho 
Furniture, Pottery and Art." 
</P>
<P>
For a generation seeking both comfort and a sense of tradition, California 
Rancho fills not only a nostalgic void: The furniture bears aesthetic 
similarities to now-out-of-reach Craftsman pieces, and prices are rock bottom 
in comparison -- say, $2,500 to $5,000 for a Monterey cabinet versus the 
$363,000 Barbra Streisand paid for a Stickley sideboard in 1988. To appreciate 
California Rancho, however, one must accept that it's not a pure vision but a 
hybrid form. Fans such as collector Robert Smith don't mind. "If cowboys had 
had furniture," he says, "this is what it would have looked like." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cowboy Chic 
</P>
<P>
The island of cactus in the front yard of this unassuming 1947 tract house is a 
hint: A superb collection of California Rancho lies within. Since their 
childhoods, both Paul and Nancy Aguilar -- he's an electrician and she's a 
nurse -- have collected Western memorabilia, and after moving into this 
Whittier house seven years ago, they have continued to add to their bounty. 
</P>
<P>
Quaint and colorful, the Aguilars' many collectibles are reminders of the 
rugged frontier: Paul's hats (a Mexican sombrero, a Tom Mix Stetson and two 
old, children's cowboy hats) rest easy but ready for action on the armoire in 
the living room. A variety of playthings -- complete sets of Johnny West dolls 
and Legends of the West dolls, a toy guitar, a Davy Crockett tray and a toy 
fort with Cavalry-men figures -- decorate the solarium. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, videotapes of vintage cowboy movies, including "The Big Sombrero," 
starring Gene Autry, and "Lights of Old Santa Fe," featuring Roy Rogers, line 
the shelves. A collection of William S. Hart books and an assortment of 
dogeared 1930s and '40s magazines such as "Old Arizona Highway," "The Homes of 
the West" and "Deserts" continue the Western theme. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in an era when everything was Western," says Paul, whose favorite TV 
shows were "Wagon Train" and "Rawhide." "On the weekend, my family would go for 
a ride and picnic at Will Rogers' ranch. I remember running around and falling 
in love with it. Here I am, 30 years later, with the same kind of furniture." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rustic Renaissance 
</P>
<P>
Before Joel Shukovsky and Diane English, the Emmy-winning executive producers 
of "Murphy Brown," moved into their early California Rancho Revival house six 
years ago, it was decorated with avocado-green and harvest-gold carpeting and 
unappealing grass-cloth wallpaper. What sold the couple and ended their long 
real estate search (they had looked at 75 houses) were the fabulous "bones" of 
the 1963 structure and its secluded location in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
"I'm not a fan of big houses. I like houses that are sympathetic to the land," 
says Shukovsky of the rancho, which was built low to the ground and retains its 
dark, earthy adobe color. "Whitewashing would have been too interruptive," he 
explains. 
</P>
<P>
Although Shukovsky and English initially decorated the house with modern 
Italian and Bauhaus-style furniture, they began buying Mexican and 
Western-style accessories. They were first attracted to Craftsman pieces, then 
shifted to Monterey furniture because of its regional character and 
appropriateness for the house. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not my style at first," English acknowledges. "I'm much more a fan of a 
neoclassic or eclectic-country look, but the more the house began to evolve 
into an early California feeling, the more I began to warm up to it." 
</P>
<P>
The house is now full of classic examples of trademark horseshoe-branded 
Monterey furniture and serious California plein-air artwork such as Edgar 
Payne's "Desert Clouds," which hangs over the fireplace. The handsome landscape 
paintings are a polished counterpoint to the rustic furnishings -- a 
sophisticated marriage of Old California and the West. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rancho Roundup 
</P>
<P>
Robert Smith, a professor of art at Cal State Northridge, and Tobi Smith, 
director of the Santa Monica Heritage Museum, originally intended to fill their 
pedigree Craftsman house (designed in 1909 by Myron Hunt of Huntington Library 
and Rose Bowl fame) with furniture from the Craftsman period. That is, until 
celebrity collectors such as Steven Spielberg and Barbra Streisand entered the 
market and pushed prices beyond reach. As Robert writes in the Santa Monica 
Heritage Museum's catalogue: "Many of the people now buying Monterey might have 
purchased Roycroft and Stickley had the price stayed within their budgets. 
There are a lot of people interested in buying old furniture that fits in 
Mediterranean- and Craftsman-style houses. When Mission furniture left this 
eager market, the market found Monterey." 
</P>
<P>
Though cost was a consideration, the Smiths found they actually preferred the 
look of California Rancho furniture to that of Craftsman for their Ojai home. 
The hand-hewn furniture, with its painted flowers and antique finish, better 
suited the Western presence of their Craftsman interior, and it blended well 
with the beams and front door, which had been painted in an Indian motif by La 
Jolla architects Frank Mead and Richard Requa. 
</P>
<P>
The Smiths bought their first Monterey pieces at the Old California Store in 
Ventura; they also discovered La Fiesta furniture, perfect for the informality 
of their enclosed sun porch. "It's a cheap substitute for Monterey," Robert 
explains. Where Monterey pieces were painted by Mexican artisans and branded 
with a horseshoe, La Fiesta furniture was merely stenciled and stamped with a 
wagon drawn by a donkey.

plein-air paintings; Bauer, Catalina and Pacific tile and pottery; wrought-iron

Sierra Madre in 1986. "They were covered with dust, smelled like hay and 
horses, and wore more than a few bird droppings," says Nancy. But the price was 
right -- $50. American Indian rugs and a small bronze of Will Rogers on his 
horse, Soap Suds, lend additional Western flavor, as do the cowboy andirons 
that Paul designed for the fireplace. ; Photo, COLOR, Far right, top: A

By DAVID BRENNER, Comedian Brenner is the author of If God Wanted Us to Travel 
. . . (Pocket Books; $16.95).

<TEXT>
<P>
Once in a while, like most people, I like to get away from it all. However, 
unlike some people, part of the all from which I want to get away is most 
people. To truly relax, I need to go somewhere where no one will recognize me 
and no one will ask for my autograph. 
</P>
<P>
Now, don't get me wrong. I deeply appreciate my career and am dedicated to all 
my fans who helped me realize my childhood dreams. And because of all the 
wonderment that has exploded into my and my loved ones' lives, I accept fame 
gladly. 
</P>
<P>
Autographs are part of the package and I have never turned down anyone's 
request for one. My only rule, which came after years of not being able to eat 
until my food turned cold, is to ask the autograph seeker to please return 
after I've finished my meal. I don't think that is unreasonable, and I do make 
exceptions for children and veterans of the Spanish American War. 
</P>
<P>
But when it's vacation time, I want to leave the career and the fame at home. I 
want to escape to places I once dreamed about while lying next to my big 
brother in our unheated and barely furnished closet/bedroom in our row house in 
Philadelphia. I especially want to escape from David Brenner, the comedian, and 
all the baggage that goes with him, including -- and I repeat that I appreciate 
and love them -- the fans. Far, far away to places where the only time I write 
my name is on a traveler's check. Ahhhh, free at last. Or am I? 
</P>
<P>
I am standing silently on a cliff at the border between Israel and Lebanon. I 
am lost in thought about the profound history of the place, from biblical days 
to bitter armored battles of recent years. The warm winds of the hamseen seem 
to carry with them the voices of the men and women who have lived and died on 
this hallowed ground. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, my thoughts are broken by a voice -- a grating, whiny voice, a 
distinct call native to the Bensonhurst region of Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatcha doin' here, David?" 
</P>
<P>
"I live here. I only go to America to do TV." 
</P>
<P>
"Dat's nice." 
</P>
<P>
I sign her kibbutz cap and seriously consider driving my Jeep deep into the 
Negev desert, never to return. "Salaam, Bedouin Brenner." 
</P>
<P>
On another visit to the Middle East, I approach the registration counter of a 
Cairo hotel. The clerk looks at me, widens her eyes, opens her mouth and 
screams. My first thought is that the Camp David peace accord has been revoked 
and she is signaling the arrival of a Jew. It turns out she once lived in 
Washington, D.C., where she became a die-hard Johnny Carson fan. As requested, 
I fill the entire page of the guest book with my signature. 
</P>
<P>
In a small, remote Arab town, I am walking through the marketplace, where Arab 
men and women sit in front of cubbyhole- sized shops and hawk their wares. I 
file the sights, sounds and smells into my memory bank. Then . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The Philly Kid!" 
</P>
<P>
I can't believe my ears. Someone with a thick Arabic accent calling out the 
name of my birthplace? 
</P>
<P>
Impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"The Philly Kid!" the voice repeats, louder. 
</P>
<P>
I turn to see a dark-skinned face smiling from inside his Arab headdress. The 
man is squatting in front of a small stall containing thousands of brass items. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, you are he. You are the Philly Kid. I lived in your hometown for two 
years with my brother who is going to the University of Pennsylvania and my 
sister who is married to a policeman." 
</P>
<P>
Then, without taking a breath, he adds: "Would you like to buy a pot?" 
</P>
<P>
He settled for my name written with black marker on the side of a large brass 
kettle, which I'm sure he's since sold to another Philly Kid. 
</P>
<P>
Some years ago, my older brother and I left Dublin and drove to a desolate spot 
far up along the Irish coast. We got out and strolled along the water's edge, 
tossing stones into the sunlit sea and ideas into the air. After we had walked 
about half an hour, a young couple appeared atop an embankment 30 yards or so 
ahead of us. They climbed down and started walking towards us. Obviously young 
Irish lovers walking hand in hand, whispering intimate expressions of love, I 
thought. Now they were directly in front of us. 
</P>
<P>
"Excuse me, David, we are students from Michigan State. We saw you in concert 
two years ago and would love your autograph." 
</P>
<P>
"What a wild coincidence that we should meet here," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, actually, we followed you from Dublin. I hope you're not angry." 
</P>
<P>
How could I be? I have often wondered if those young lovers ever married, and 
if they did, if they still have the flat stone from the Irish coast that has my 
name written on it. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the place I dreamed most about seeing was the Great Wall of China. 
From the moment in grade school when I saw a picture of it and read of its 
history, I wanted to stand at the top of one of its towers. I wanted to let my 
mind race back through 5,000 years of time. I was wildly jealous when I once 
called my father on board the Queen Elizabeth II during one of his world 
cruises and was told that my brother wasn't on the ship because he had gone to 
see the Great Wall. 
</P>
<P>
A few years later, my day in China finally came. Most people's hearts pound 
from the exertion of climbing the wall. Mine nearly exploded from the mere 
first sight of it. I ran to purchase my ticket and began a climb that I had 
climbed so often in my mind. 
</P>
<P>
I had gone only a few steps when a woman spun me around violently, screaming at 
the top of her lungs. 
</P>
<P>
"Harry! Harry! Look who's here. David Brenner! Can you believe it? Look 
everyone -- David Brenner!" 
</P>
<P>
Everyone? Of course. Why limit this discovery to just Harry? Let the whole tour 
group share in it. 
</P>
<P>
"David, I swear to God. I should drop dead, if this isn't the truth -- and who 
wants to die in this God-forsaken Communist country -- if I didn't say to Harry 
when we were watching 'The Tonight Show' and you told Johnny you were going to 
China, as God is my witness, on the lives of my three children and four 
grandchildren, God bless their hearts, if I didn't say to Harry, 'Harry, 
wouldn't it be something if as soon as we go to that wall place, we bump into 
David Brenner?' And here you are!" 
</P>
<P>
Harry pumped my hand. The tour group surrounded me. I could no longer see the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
My identifier cried out, "Don't worry everyone, I've got enough autograph paper 
for everyone!" 
</P>
<P>
And she did. And everyone used it. Everyone except the Chinese, thanks to the 
same God she was thanking, because there are more than 1 billion of them and I 
had only two hours to see the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever the private me goes, the public me goes. I cannot escape from myself. 
When I stepped off the ship's gangplank in Costa Rica, a local camera crew ran 
up to interview me; the TV newsman covering the ship's arrival had lived in New 
Jersey for a year. He translated my jokes into Spanish. As soon as I came off 
the plane in Rhodes, the TV news crew doing a documentary charged after me; the 
producer had spent a summer in Boston. A Turkish family in Bodrum recognized 
me; they had once stopped in Las Vegas during their vacation in America. The 
hot-air balloon landing on an estate outside Siena, Italy, was owned by a woman 
who knew me from the month she had spent in Los Angeles. In Marbella, Spain, my 
waiter had been a waiter in Manhattan. Stopping at a lodge to pick up bottled 
water during a safari in the Masai Mara Animal Reserve in Kenya, a woman at the 
counter remembered me from TV when she had visited the United States to explore 
the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Was there no escaping? An idea: As a sailor, I know that about the one place on 
this earth that can provide me with the few days of privacy is the deck of a 
sailboat. 
</P>
<P>
Free from fame at last in the Caribbean. I sailed from St. Maarten into 
Gustavia in St. Barts and tied up at the dock. It was time for a glass of 
Champagne and a sunset. As I sat on deck watching the sun dip into the sea, I 
heard a very familiar voice. Mine. My voice was coming from the sailboat next 
to me. Twilight Zone time. A young man came up on the deck of my neighboring 
sailboat, looked at me and screamed "I don't believe it. We taped you on the 
Howard Stern radio show and brought it with us and we're listening to it right 
now and here you are. Unbelievable!" It certainly was. 
</P>
<P>
Our 61-foot Swan settled into the small harbor off the most magical island I've 
ever seen -- Santorini, in the Aegean Sea off Greece. It is an island steeped 
in mystical history, and steep in mountain. The only means of getting up the 
sheer cliff etched out during violent volcanic eruptions are by tram or donkey. 
My friends and I chose the four-footed mode over the mechanical one, but this 
turned out to be more adventurous than I anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
My donkey, named Marco Polo, was insane. He refused to tolerate any of his 
brethren beating him to the top. In Marco's insatiable, maniacal need to be No. 
1, he repeatedly slammed me against the cliff wall. Whenever he would pass 
another donkey, he would announce his triumph by braying loudly and depositing 
a few donkey droppings. 
</P>
<P>
As we passed our 10th or 12th donkey (I lost count) and were rounding a bend, a 
group of about 20 tourists on as many donkeys was descending. Upon seeing my 
mad ass charging right at her, the first tourist screamed. Tourist No. 2 
screeched, "Oh, my God, everyone, look -- it's David Brenner." Tourists No. 3 
through 20 waved and yelled terms of endearment as I whipped by them at Indy 
500 speed, slowing down only when my body crashed into a wall. To those who 
called out requests for autographs, I replied that I would wait for them at the 
top. 
</P>
<P>
Another solution hit me: Never get off the sailboat, never touch land. Fish 
don't watch TV, and even if they did, they wouldn't ask for autographs. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere off the coast of France, I had been at sea for little more than a 
week when -- on the horizon -- I spotted a gorgeous schooner under full sail. A 
magnificent sight. She had to be 160 feet. I decided to try to catch up to her. 
</P>
<P>
It took about three hours before I was able to pull alongside. Up close she was 
even more gorgeous, perhaps the most beautiful boat I had ever seen. "Ahoy, 
Captain," I called when I was close off her starboard side. 
</P>
<P>
"Ahoy," waved her salty master. 
</P>
<P>
"You are the queen of the seven seas, Captain," I yelled, as I turned in closer 
to the schooner. 
</P>
<P>
The captain smiled proudly, knowing that it was true. As he waved his thank 
you, a head popped up from the deck. It was a woman's head, complete with 
large, gold-hoop earrings and lots of makeup. Who wears jewelry and makeup on a 
sailing vessel? I wondered. As a possible answer gripped me with fear, the 
sunglasses came off the face, and the red mouth parted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's David Brenner! It's David Brenner!" 
</P>
<P>
Heads, male and female, began popping up from all over the deck. 
</P>
<P>
"Quick, George, get the camera!" 
</P>
<P>
Before you could yell "Fans Ahoy," dozens of people were now lined up along the 
railing. Camera shutters were clicking. Soon friends at home would be seeing 
pictures of the celebrity they spotted while enjoying a day sail during the 
free vacation they had won for being the top salespeople in their company. My 
luck, a floating convention. 
</P>
<P>
Since that glorious day in the 1970s when my career catapulted me into the 
public eye, I have had a vision of the future. In it, I cast aside my life 
onstage, which I have so deeply loved and appreciated, and I cast off in my 
sailboat to cruise the world. After a couple of years, I settle down in what 
will be my private nirvana. I see myself, barefoot and bare-chested, in cutoff 
jeans, walking lackadaisically on a sun-drenched, white-sand beach, stopping 
only to inspect a uniquely beautiful seashell, or to gaze admiringly at another 
painted sky, bidding goodby to another tranquil day. I see a young couple 
approaching. They stare at me and one of them asks timidly, "Didn't you used to 
be David Brenner?" And I smile warmly and answer, "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
The only question unanswered in my dream is whether they will ask me for an 
autograph and, should they not, whether I shall be disappointed.

OUTTAKES: REMODELED 'PALACE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pat H. Broeske 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fans of "White Palace," the novel, may be surprised by "White Palace," the 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Luis Mandoki for Universal Pictures, it stars James Spader as an 
upscale advertising exec who falls for slatternly waitress -- and older woman 
-- Susan Sarandon. 
</P>
<P>
What was a fairly gritty, realistic story about two people from different 
worlds and classes falling in love appears to have been largely homogenized 
into a Hollywood fairy tale that omits or softens many of the book's 
potentially offensive details. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Robinson, who co-produced the film with Griffin Dunne and Mark Robinson, 
disagrees with that assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"We set out to tell a story -- not to make a slavish translation of a book," 
she says. "I believe the movie captures the feeling, sentiment, milieu and the 
story of the book." Among the notable changes: The book's "pear-shaped" 
waitress (with small breasts and a "monumental rear end") has become the slim 
but curvaceous Sarandon. Spader's character is now less snobbish, Sarandon's 
considerably less coarse -- gone are her racist and anti-Semitic attitudes, for 
instance. Her heavy alcohol use -- a subject of his concern in the book -- now 
seems almost romantic. And so on. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson acknowledges that the film went through extensive re-editing -- 
including a decision to re-shoot the ending. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people were involved" regarding the changes, she adds, including motion 
picture group chairman Tom Pollock and other Universal executives. 
</P>
<P>
Some alterations were made so recently that publicity materials distributed for 
the film -- now being reprinted -- list cast members who didn't make the final 
cut, and even an actress who was recast. 
</P>
<P>
"White Palace" author Glenn Savan tells us he had nothing to do with the 
screenplay, which was written by Ted Tally and Alvin Sargent. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no real input," Savan says. "I feel what's on the screen reflects 
someone else's artistic endeavor. I don't feel comfortable in commenting on 
it." Pat H. Broeske

OUTTAKES: SUPER DAVE, THE MOVIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Daniel Cerone 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Super Dave Osborne, the daredevil stunt man who always fails so dramatically -- 
and comically -- has vaulted from NBC's "Van Dyke and Company" (1974) to 
Showtime's "Bizarre" (1979-1984) to his current variety show, "Super Dave," on 
the cable network. Just last week, he turned up in new Nike network spots aired 
during the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
And to prove that you can't keep an inept daredevil down, the deadpan Super 
Dave -- actually, Emmy Award-winning writer-performer Bob Einstein -- will now 
attempt a leap to the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a deal with Columbia to do a Super Dave movie," reveals Einstein, 
brother of actor-director Albert Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
Likely premise: a movie-within-a-movie that has serious-minded Super Dave 
turning down a fictitious studio's offer for him to make a wild, 
action-aventure -- but then stumbling into a real-life one anyway. 
</P>
<P>
In his Showtime series, with new episodes due in January, Einstein spends half 
the program meticulously setting up a daredevil stunt that inevitably 
backfires, crushing or mangling the "Super One." The feature film will exploit 
the same running gag. 
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations are finished," says Alan Blye, Einstein's writing partner and 
executive producer. "It's now a matter of sitting down and doing it, finding 
the time between the television show and other responsibilities." Daniel Cerone

He's currently co-starring in Columbia's "Boys in the 'Hood," which began 
shooting Oct. 1, playing a drug-dealing gang member in the coming-of-age drama 
that explores the dilemmas inner-city teen-agers face as they try to remain 
unscathed in a gang- and drug-ridden environment.

OUTTAKES: PLAYING IT STRAIGHT 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Downey is known for his movies' offbeat subject matter, but with his 
latest dark comedy -- "Too Much Sun" -- he admits: "I've learned a lot from 
this one." 
</P>
<P>
Currently on the festival circuit, the CineTel Films production has the late 
Howard Duff as a dying millionaire whose gay son (played by Eric Idle) and 
lesbian daughter (Andrea Martin) will inherit a fortune only if they produce 
heirs within a year of Dad's death. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that both have grown kids (Robert Downey Jr., Ralph Macchio) from 
one-night stands during their heterosexual pasts, whom a less-than-saintly 
priest hopes to keep under wraps so his church will inherit the money. 
</P>
<P>
The writer-director feels it won't offend: "We played straight -- in a way." 
</P>
<P>
Scenes involving Idle, Martin and their lovers (Leo Rossi, co-writer Laura 
Ernst), Downey says, show "lots of tender stuff between them. We don't treat 
them any differently than other couples, heterosexual or otherwise. We don't 
put them down at all." 
</P>
<P>
Some insensitive material was eliminated, he adds, and the AIDS issue is dealt 
with directly. In one sexual situation, gay characters display medical cards 
indicating their HIV-negative status. 
</P>
<P>
"(The AIDS issue) was uncomfortable," Downey admits. "But you had to deal with 
it, or the film wouldn't have worked." John M. Wilson

*** EMILY REMLER "THIS IS ME" JUSTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Admirers of the guitarist will be surprised and perhaps confused by "This Is 
Me," completed shortly before her death. Both the music and the claims made for 
it are debatable: she was "encumbered" by her reputation as a straight-ahead 
player? That was no encumberance, it was an honor. 
</P>
<P>
As for her alleged "undiscovered songwriting ability," one of her earlier 
albums consisted entirely of originals; others were scattered through her 
various Concord LPs. 
</P>
<P>
In this fusion-Latin-pop-Brazilian collection, one wonders how much of its 
character was shaped by her arrangers or co-writers (David Benoit, Russ Freeman 
et al) and whether she really felt this was her finest hour. For what it tries 
to be, it is well crafted, with the best tracks mostly toward the end: 
"Carenia," a samba in which she stretches out, and "Second Childhood," which is 
almost unaccompanied. A far cry from the Remler her fans knew, this must be 
judged by other values. LEONARD FEATHER

*** ART BLAKEY AND THE JAZZ MESSENGERS "I GET A KICK OUT OF BU" SOUL NOTE 
</P>

Ironic it is that the vaunted drummer's first domestic release in a couple of 
years arrives within a week or two of his demise on Oct. 16. Sadly, this band, 
captured in Milan in November, 1988, is not one of his best. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it embodies a timeless Blakey aspect: He always allowed -- no, 
encouraged -- his players to use the bandstand as a school to learn how to 
play. That process is in action here, particularly via the performances of 
trumpeter Philip Harper and saxman Javon Jackson, who consistently scuffle on 
both medium tunes like "Yang" and the flag-waver, "I Get a Kick Out of You." 
Trombonist Robin Eubanks seems more relaxed on his feature on "Lover Man" but, 
for maturity, we turn to pianist Benny Green, who delivers one sizzling, 
blues-drenched solo after another. When he plays, one shakes one's head in 
agreement, rather than disappointment. ZAN STEWART

POP EYE: VENTURESOME INDIE LABEL SUB POP GOES HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
L.A. has tons of singles clubs, but none as hip as the one at Sub Pop Records. 
</P>
<P>
The Seattle-based record company, which has emerged as the nation's most 
adventuresome independent label, has earned much of its stellar reputation 
through a unique subscription-only singles club. 
</P>
<P>
Each month, Sub Pop sends subscribers a new seven-inch, brightly colored vinyl 
single featuring new songs by a variety of top cult-rock artists, most of whom 
officially record for other labels. In recent years, the club has offered 
singles by such raucous underground faves as Soundgarden, Mud Honey, Sonic 
Youth, Nirvana, Flaming Lips, Henry Rollins and Pussy Galore. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were starting the label, we got the idea of putting out these 
limited-edition singles, but people would call and yell at us because we'd run 
out of copies so fast," says Sub Pop co-owner Bruce Pavitt. "So we decided that 
if people wanted the records so badly, then they could pay for 'em in advance. 
</P>
<P>
"The club was really an outgrowth of our focus on regional rock scenes. Every 
band in the singles club has been from a different city because virtually every 
scene out there has at least one great band -- and we wanted to plug into 
that." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the singles club has more than 2,500 subscribers, who pay $35 a year 
for 12 singles. The new October/November edition features two singles, one by 
Poison Idea from Portland, Ore., and one by the Chicago-based group the Poster 
Children. 
</P>
<P>
According to Pavitt, 20% of the club's membership resides outside the United 
States. "We've got people everywhere," Pavitt says. "Japan, Finland and Germany 
are the biggest fan areas, but we even got a subscription in yesterday from 
Sudan." 
</P>
<P>
But here's a true sign of Sub Pop's influence. Last year A&amp;M Records signed 
Soundgarden, one of Sub Pop's most commercial bands. But to make sure the group 
doesn't lose its hard-core following, A&amp;M has helped finance a "bonus" 
singles-club issue, with a pair of new Soundgarden tunes. 
</P>
<P>
"To lots of kids, there's nothing more credible than a Sub Pop single," 
explains Jeff Weiss, the A&amp;M exec who works with Soundgarden. "It conveys a 
special kind of underground aesthetic -- an image of quality -- that fans 
everywhere know about." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many indy labels, Sub Pop is also a shrewd business enterprise -- 
starting with the singles club. "By having fans subscribe in advance, we get 12 
months to play with their money," Pavitt says. "And instead of waiting 90 days 
to get payment on our regular album sales, we sell the majority of our records 
to record stores C.O.D. 
</P>
<P>
"Our cash flow is probably better than CBS'. It isn't as much, of course, but 
it's probably quicker." 
</P>
<P>
Pavitt admits he can only take Sub Pop's indy network so far. In fact, Sub Pop 
is completing a distribution agreement with Hollywood Records, which would give 
Hollywood first crack at distributing Sub Pop's biggest acts. "We'd still own 
the company," says Pavitt. "But if an artist really busts open, then they'd 
become more financially involved in the act. 
</P>
<P>
"Either way, we stand to gain. We'll have Hollywood's resources behind us if we 
need them, but we'll maintain our old system of distribution as a safety net. 
If we have to go back to selling records out of our cars, we'll do it -- we 
know how to survive."

LIVING LARGE: Speaking of dwarfs, Tin Pan Apple Records (who brought us the Fat 
Boys) has put together a group of all-dwarf rappers. (Would we lie? See photo 
on Page 78.) 
</P>
<P>
The first single by the trio Little Posse (Giz-Mo-C, B-Ill and M.C. Science) 
will be a rap version of Spencer Davis' "Gimme Some Lovin'." . . . Rap's 
leading lady, Queen Latifah, is in the spotlight these days. She did a guest 
spot on the fall premiere of "In Living Color," plays a waitress named LaShawn 
in Spike Lee's upcoming movie "Jungle Fever," and is performing on Motown's 
upcoming 30th anniversary TV special (she even has an offer to do a TV pilot of 
her own). . . . And H.W.A., female rap's answer to N.W.A. (the initials stand 
for 'Hos With Attitude), make their cable-TV debut Nov. 8 on 2 Live Crew's 
upcoming pay-per-view TV special. The Chicago-based group's new album, "Living 
in a 'Ho House," features such raunchy songs as "Nasty," "1-900-Bitches" and 
others far too explicit to be mentioned here. . . . Meanwhile, you have to 
wonder how Frank Sinatra will handle the news that a new Scottish pop band, 
whose album is titled "Cake," go by the moniker of . . . the Trash Can 
Sinatras.

FROG MAN

<TEXT>
<P>
My fellow local herpetologists and I have noted the decline of frogs, but we 
did not know that it was part of a larger syndrome. In Southern California, it 
is easy to blame everything on development and habitat destruction. 
</P>
<P>
This, apparently, is not the case worldwide. I do know that places I went for 
frogs when I was a student in the early '60s no longer support any semblance of 
the frog populations extant at that time. 
</P>
<P>
If Jennings and Mark Hayes and other herpetologists concerned with the decline 
in amphibians are correct in their theories about why these animals are 
disappearing, I think we have a lot to think about -- but we better do it 
quickly before this decline spreads irretrievably to the rest of the biome, 
including us.

I can remember squirming with disgust when an unsuspecting frog lost his way 
into our kitchen. I fluttered about the house agonizing over how I was going to 
get the slimy intruder outside without making physical contact. 
</P>
<P>
That was years ago, and, I must admit, time only intensified my aversion to 
frogs. But after reading of their imminent extinction, I suddenly felt ashamed; 
my animosity toward this helpless amphibian was not only unwarranted, it was 
blatantly ignorant. Will this be yet another casualty in the name of modern 
living? I sincerely hope not. Imagine how feeble our childhood fairy tales 
would be without the frog. 
</P>
<P>
I'm afraid the California red-legged is leaping on borrowed time. I only hope 
Mark Jennings' census will lead to a solution before the frog is gone forever. 
</P>
<P>
Jennings is right; they are just plain cute.

ART WORLD: DAY OF THE DEAD ENLIVENS PHOTO CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

THE SCENE 
</P>
<P>
The annual Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) festivities, in which Latinos 
honor their deceased loved ones through artworks and altars, begins in several 
locations this week. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest Day of the Dead show is at the L.A. Photography Center. 
Nearly 75 artists -- including Gilbert Lujan, Dolores Guerrero-Cruz, Frank 
Romero, Robert Gil de Montes, Wayne Healy, Willie Herron and Linda Vallejo -- 
will present works on the Day of the Dead theme from Tuesday through Nov. 3. 
The show is dedicated to the late artist Carlos Almaraz, and will include 
personal tributes by artists including Almaraz's wife, Elsa Flores. 
</P>
<P>
"Carlos was one of the pioneers of the (Chicano art) movement," said the show's 
co-curator, Consuelo F. Norte. "So this is a very nice way for the community of 
artists that he left behind to be able to say goodby to him." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the works dedicated to Almaraz, a special piece by Yreina 
Cervantez will pay tribute to photographer Cyndi Honesto, who died of cancer in 
January. Ironically, Honesto's last show was a 1989 Day of the Dead show at 
Self-Help Graphics. 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the show, numerous festivities have been scheduled at the 
photo center on Nov. 3 from 3-9 p.m. Many of the artists will attend the event, 
which will include live performances and a candlelight procession. 
</P>
<P>
Other Day of the Dead shows planned include those at Self-Help Graphics ("La 
Muerte Picante" featuring 19 emerging Latin American artists, from Nov. 2-28), 
the Woman's Building (works by Laura Aguilar, Diane Gamboa, Barbara Carrasco 
and Rose Portillo, through Nov. 24, with a reception and special festivities 
being held Friday from 6-9 p.m.), Occidental College's Weingart Center 
(paintings and drawings by Jesus Perez through Nov. 9), La Luz de Jesus Gallery 
("Art on Death's Theme From Both Sides of the Border," through Nov. 4, with a 
Day of the Dead Fiesta starting at 6 p.m. on Nov. 2), Cal State San Bernardino 
group show of altars, Monday through Nov. 9) and the Art Works Gallery in 
Riverside (small works in diverse media by 16 artists including Janice DeLoof, 
Cindy Evans, Sandra Rowe and Dan Callis, through Nov. 3). 
</P>
<P>
A Day of the Dead symposium will be held at Riverside's California Museum of 
Photography on Nov. 3, from noon-5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
DEBUTS 
</P>
<P>
Latvian emigre painter Simon Shegelman, now based in Montreal, Canada, opens 
his first Los Angeles show this week at La Cienega Boulevard's Sherberg 
Gallery. The show will be up until Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Shegelman, 57, whose 1975 show in his native Riga was shut down by Soviet 
officials because it was "too modern," was invited home earlier this month for 
a major retrospective. 
</P>
<P>
The artist will talk about his experiences during his opening reception at the 
gallery, on Thursday at 8 p.m. Information: (213) 652-0814. 
</P>
<P>
HAPPENING 
</P>
<P>
On Monday artist Christo will discuss his upcoming work "The Umbrellas: Joint 
Project for Japan and USA," in which 1,340 blue umbrellas will be installed in 
Ibaraki, Japan, and 1,760 yellow umbrellas will be placed along Interstate 5 in 
the Tejon Pass, 60 miles north of Los Angeles. The talk will begin at 8 p.m. in 
USC's Bovard Auditorium, and at 7 p.m. the film, "Running Fence," focusing on 
Christo's 1972-76 California art project of the same name, will be screened. 
Information: (213) 743-0639.

BOB BURNS RESTAURANT THRIVES BY PRESERVING THE PAST, ACCOMMODATING THE PRESENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By COLMAN ANDREWS

<TEXT>
<P>
What becomes of old-fashioned restaurants when the years -- and their former 
customers -- start passing them by? Some simply slip out of business, giving up 
the ghost more or less gracefully, as have Scandia, the Cock n' Bull, Carl 
Andersen's Chatham and the Tail o' the Cock in recent years. Others just keep 
limping along somehow, probably losing money, probably blaming restaurant 
critics and a fickle public and almost everybody but themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Other old-fashioned restaurants remake themselves in a contemporary image in an 
attempt to find new life, new credibility. When this remake consists of little 
more than a fresh paint job in the dining room and the promiscuous appendage of 
goat cheese, sun-dried tomatoes and Hawaiian tuna to the menu, it doesn't 
usually work for long. But when it is integral and intelligent -- when the food 
is genuinely improved in quality -- it can be wonderfully successful. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Burns in Santa Monica is one of these successes. Opened in 1960 (there are 
two other, newer Bob Burnses in Newport Beach and Woodland Hills, and the same 
family owns the unabashedly up-to-date Brentwood Bar &amp; Grill in Brentwood), 
it is a living, thriving restaurant today, better than it has ever been, and 
well-prepared to compete in the contemporary restaurant environment. Yet the 
updating it has obviously done is hard to spot. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, Bob Burns probably looks exactly the same as it did the day it 
opened. The decor is Scottish-themed (you know, Robbie Burns: "Scots, wha hae," 
and all that), and undeniably corny with old prints on the walls of notable 
Scots in kilts, bright plaid carpeting, and a combination of Caledonian brown 
leatherette booths and rather ugly high-backed chairs upholstered in red. But 
the place still somehow feels good: It's crowded, the customers are chattering 
and laughing happily, and you can't help noticing the huge, succulent portions 
of food being served. 
</P>
<P>
There are admittedly some stabs at modernization on the menu: ahi sashimi; 
salad of bufala mozzarella, basil, and tomato; Cajun chicken. But apart from a 
few such regular items and an occasional overly ambitious or just plain silly 
daily special (e.g., that perfectly good ribeye steak served one evening with 
Madeira sauce and walnuts -- why?), the catalogue of dishes offered here is 
mostly a pure joy for lovers of old-time American/continental food to read. 
</P>
<P>
Here, for instance, are oysters Rockefeller, crab Louis, rainbow trout 
"almondine," roast duckling with Grand Marniere sauce, veal Oscar, Colorado 
double-cut lamb chops, steaks galore. And though the skill of the kitchen in 
preparing these culinary glories of a bygone day is variable, the raw materials 
used are fresh and of very good quality, and the food in general is just fine. 
</P>
<P>
One night a group of us chowed down happily in a big, plush corner booth on 
baskets of Parmesan garlic bread and (not on the menu, but always available) an 
unusual pesto and creamed spinach bread, both chewy and damp and very garlicky 
but quite addictive; large and entirely credible Caesar salads; house-cured 
gravlax of Norwegian king salmon, attractively formed into a crown shape, 
surrounded by paper-thin slices of cucumber and an excellent dill sauce; a 
beautiful hunk of culotte steak, charred and rare as ordered, in a light 
green-peppercorn sauce; a "royal steak-o-bob" (talk about corny) of skewered 
filet mignon, mushrooms, and green peppers, served over herb-infused rice with 
both bordelaise and bearnaise sauces on the side (all of this surprisingly 
tasty); a rather bland but moist and tender venison special cloaked in a 
well-made black currant port sauce and a serving of the restaurant's "famous" 
double-thick Colorado lamb chops, which were slightly gamy (a character I 
happen to like) but perfectly cooked. 
</P>
<P>
With the main dishes came a choice of middling French fries, goofy but 
strangely enjoyable cheddar-stuffed potato halves or textbook baked potatoes, 
and a veritable cornucopia of fresh vegetables, including a couple of spears of 
al dente asparagus, a little mound of genuine corn, some neatly-turned carrots 
and turnips, and a scattering of snow peas. (Entree prices also include soup or 
salad. ) I have had worse food than this in many restaurants with far more 
exalted reputations. 
</P>
<P>
To be fair, I must add that I was less taken with a special of fresh abalone on 
another occasion -- indeed fresh enough, but obscured with a soggy, puffy egg 
batter. And I'm not terribly fond of the various seafood salads that are always 
offered as specials here: lobster, shrimp and scallops with assorted greens and 
Maui onions, spinach leaves and assorted shellfish in lemon-butter dressing, 
salmon filet with grilled vegetables, and such. They tend to be heavy with 
butter and/or cream, and entirely too busy with lettuces and herbs and other 
little accents. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, even some of the self-consciously contemporary stuff on the 
menu works pretty well. The aforementioned ahi sashimi, its peculiar garnish of 
a thin-sliced, fanned-out strawberry aside, consists of three thin slabs of 
beautiful tuna in light soy dressing, garnished with marinated ginger and an 
oyster shell filled with liquefied wasabi. Not bad at all. And the crab and 
lobster cakes offered as a special one evening were as good as any crab cakes 
in the city, perfect in consistency, full of flavor, with pleasant dill and 
Chardonnay-cream sauces (shades of nearby Michael's!) on the side. 
</P>
<P>
At lunchtime, the appetizers and salads at Bob Burns are mostly priced the same 
as they are at dinner and in a few cases are actually higher (for instance, the 
spinach salad with bay shrimp, $13.50 at night and $13.95 for lunch). 
</P>
<P>
But smaller portions of many of the regular dinner entrees are available at 
lower prices, including the steak-o-bob and a good hunk of Pacific swordfish 
with bearnaise, and there is a mouth-watering array of classic sandwiches, from 
the club to the Reuben to the tuna melt to molasses-barbecued pork (shades of 
Michael's yet again!). 
</P>
<P>
Though the wine list here doesn't begin to approach that at the Brentwood Bar 
&amp; Grill, the California selection is strong, and there are some bargains 
lurking here and there if anybody cares to seek them out. For instance, '89 
Trimbach Gewurztraminer for $18, '89 Edna Valley Chardonnay for $26, and 1979 
Chateau Talbot for $38. 
</P>
<P>
One other nice thing about Bob Burns is the service, which tends to be 
professional, solicitous and good-humored. When we asked one night if our quite 
agreeable desserts -- some good, old-style, no-frills coconut cake and a 
buttery apricot crumble with Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream -- were homemade, 
our waitress replied merrily, "No, but we buy them from somebody who knows how 
to make them better than we could."

Howard Spector turned up at a recent Manhattan Beach Coordinating Council 
luncheon armed with a stack of printed handouts and a carousel full of slide 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
He was there to talk about quality of life, intellectual and aesthetic 
challenge and other good things that the arts do for cities -- in this case, 
the Public Arts Program in the seaside city of Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Spector's presentation was warmly received, although one woman in the audience 
suggested that the public art on display in the city doesn't have anything to 
do with "our little beach town." 
</P>
<P>
As administrator of the arts program, Spector expects to be making several 
appearances before civic and business groups in the next few months, and he 
hopes to spark a public dialogue about the program. 
</P>
<P>
"A major education process has to take place here," said Spector, who began his 
$35,000-a-year job in February, six months after the program's first 
administrator abruptly left the job. 
</P>
<P>
Spector's challenge is to revitalize the arts program, which was launched with 
strong city support two years ago but whose initial public art displays have 
stirred widespread criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Spector sees Manhattan Beach residents as educated, affluent people oriented 
more toward sports and the beach than a program that installs art in public 
places and sponsors arts lectures and performances. "Nothing like this was 
offered to them" before the arts program was started, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the 1990-91 fiscal year is critical to the program's survival in light 
of a mandate from the City Council to develop public support for the venture 
and raise money so it can be self-supporting. 
</P>
<P>
If the public really supports the program, Spector said, it needs to 
demonstrate that support. 
</P>
<P>
Created by the council two years ago as a pilot program, the public arts 
project was given a $100,000 annual budget. Although its art lectures drew 
sizable audiences, and art festivals at Polliwog Park were big successes, the 
contemporary art pieces loaned to the city by artists for two years drew the 
lion's share of comment. For the most part, that comment was negative. 
</P>
<P>
The chief target was a pictorial puzzle in which the word Man-hat-tan is 
depicted in sequence along Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It seemed to leave more 
people confused than amused. Other brickbats were thrown at an artist's 
rendition of dumbbells -- which were attached to a bench along the Strand -- 
that gained notoriety when they were stolen, returned and then stolen again. 
They're still missing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see the particular need of appropriating the citizens' funds on those 
kinds of things," Councilman Dan Stern said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the council voted to continue the arts program after the pilot 
period expired July 1, but with a curtailed budget. The council appropriated 
$50,000 for administrative costs and pledged to match up to $50,000 in funds 
raised by the program. 
</P>
<P>
According to Spector, funds carried over from the earlier budget will cover 
stipends to artists for a new set of works being selected for temporary public 
display. That money also will pay for the city's first permanent artwork, which 
will be installed next year in the Manhattan Beach Parkway between Valley Drive 
and Ardmore Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
But he said future activities depend on funds from local businesses, 
corporations, individuals and grant-giving agencies. Manhattan Friends of the 
Arts, a nonprofit group that supports art programs in the city, already has 
donated $3,000 to co-sponsor an arts lecture program that begins in January. 
</P>
<P>
Spector said he is scheduling more appearances before community organizations 
and service groups, as well as preparing a video on the arts program. He also 
is developing a nonprofit foundation that will provide more opportunities for 
raising money from public sources. 
</P>
<P>
Most council members are supportive of the arts program, although they believe 
it harmed itself by displaying art that residents weren't prepared to accept. 
</P>
<P>
"The community was not buying into the art in public places," said Councilwoman 
Pat Collins. "I felt we needed a little more education. Possibly we needed to 
start with some more traditional art . . . to begin educating the community." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Connie Sieber emphasized involvement with the schools. "If kids 
are brought up . . . being taught how to appreciate art, those will be the real 
staunch supporters," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Lane, a businessman, art collector and chairman of the Cultural Arts 
Commission, which recommends art selections to the council, faults the original 
commission for some of the program's problems. Lane said the commission was 
dominated by artists "who were so far out in front of the people. . . . (They) 
were far more interested in putting forth this cutting-edge art statement." 
</P>
<P>
But Paula Benard, a teacher who was on the original commission, said the 
selection process was complicated and defies a simplistic explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of effort to include community input," she said, "but I don't 
know if we went far enough to reach enough people. . . . There was a public 
hearing, but hardly anyone attended." 
</P>
<P>
The commission was reduced from nine to five members this year and has only one 
artist member. Lane said that in evaluating new artwork, the commission 
considered "what might be the reaction of people" as well as artistic merit. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important that the community be involved in the dialogue, that we 
understand some of their views," Spector said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Spector -- a longtime photographer and painter who makes a 
striking appearance in a ponytail and broad-brimmed hat -- said controversy is 
inherent in public art. "It's brought to the people and put in public spaces. . 
. . People may or may not be ready to see it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said one measure of the program's success so far is that it "has gotten 
people commenting. Art is a waker-upper, an alarm, and it has been for as long 
as it's been around. People need to start understanding and getting out of 
their own isolated little areas. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In what Spector hopes will lead to involving the arts program in the school 
system, the city and the South Bay Union High School District will dedicate a 
mural Saturday in the boys gym at Mira Costa High School. The work, by 
Manhattan Beach artist Steve Kelso, depicts sports programs at the school. 
</P>
<P>
The mural was paid for by the city and the Manhattan Beach Kiwanis Club, which 
donated labor and materials to prepare the gym wall for the mural. The 
invitational dedication will be from 5 to 7 p.m., and a public open house will 
be held Oct. 28 from noon to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say the arts program expects to take an important step forward next 
summer with the installation of its first permanent project, the "Mariposa 
Pathway," in a 250-foot-long portion of the Valley-Ardmore parkway. 
</P>
<P>
Seven totems depicting monarch butterflies will be installed along the jogging 
trail and sandstone path for viewing by joggers and walkers. 
</P>
<P>
Lane contributed $25,000 for the pathway, which was matched by the city. The 
gesture was in memory of Lane's wife, Julie, who used to run down the parkway. 
</P>
<P>
"She would have enjoyed the butterflies," he said.

RED CROSS FEELS HEAT FOR LETTING CANDIDATE PUT NAME ON FLYER; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN: CITY COUNCIL HOPEFUL RON MAXWELL SAYS HE GOT PERMISSION TO PUT A 
POLITICAL MESSAGE ON AN EARTHQUAKE SAFETY HANDBILL. THE RED CROSS SAYS IT WAS 
ALL A MISUNDERSTANDING. 
</P>

The American Red Cross helps victims of earthquakes, floods and fires, but the 
group has found itself in the middle of a political firestorm after allowing a 
Lawndale City Council candidate to put his name on an earthquake survival 
flyer. 
</P>
<P>
The handbill has the Red Cross' popular public service announcement, "27 things 
to help you survive an earthquake," on the back of a political statement by 
candidate Ron Maxwell. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that he printed a disclaimer on the announcement stating that the Red 
Cross does not support political candidates, Maxwell, 27, says he is bewildered 
by the attention the flyer has received. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do it as a public service . . . for the benefit of the community," 
Maxwell said. "I was surprised, if not a little shocked, that my opponents 
would be against my informing people how to better prepare themselves for an 
earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
Red Cross spokeswoman Peggy McGinley said Maxwell received permission to hand 
out copies of the earthquake announcement under the words "Distributed as a 
public service by Ron Maxwell, for City Council." But she said Red Cross 
officials did not know he was planning to put the message on the back of a 
campaign flyer until they received calls about the matter from angry council 
candidates and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
They also didn't know the group's logo would appear on the flyer in black 
rather than red, in violation of the copyright, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell, who spent $400 to print 15,000 copies of the flyer, has agreed to Red 
Cross officials' request that he stop distributing it and has retrieved several 
bundles of flyers from campaign volunteers who were helping him pass them out. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had nothing but cooperation from Ron Maxwell," McGinley said. "It simply 
seems to be a misunderstanding or miscommunication." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy nevertheless comes at a sensitive time for Maxwell, who is 
considered an underdog candidate in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell is one of four candidates vying for a council seat that was left open 
when former Councilman Harold Hoffman was elected mayor in April. Also running 
for the seat are Bob Cerny, Norm Lagerquist and Gary McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt at control damage, Maxwell has spent extra time walking precincts 
to explain his case to the voters, a tactic he said has brought good results. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilwoman Carol Norman, who has endorsed Lagerquist in the race and is 
among those who complained about the flyer, remains skeptical about Maxwell's 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
"He's either extremely dumb or he (did) it intentionally," Norman said. "I 
don't think politically it was the smartest thing for him to do because it 
shows him to be less than honorable in his campaigning." 
</P>
<P>
Norman also said the flyer controversy echoes an incident last year in which 
Maxwell sent out a mailer urging people to vote and using his title as a parks 
and recreation commissioner. Although Maxwell maintained that he did nothing 
wrong in sending out that mailer, the City Council nevertheless voted 3 to 2 to 
remove him from the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell has made earthquake preparedness a key issue in his campaign for the 
council seat. In his campaign literature, he contends that the city lacks its 
own emergency plan in case of an earthquake and that the county's disaster plan 
is inadequate to address Lawndale's needs. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Charles Thompson acknowledged that the city does not have "any 
elaborate organization" and that it would be "largely dependent on county 
police, fire and public works" in the aftermath of an earthquake. But he said 
the city does have an emergency plan that describes the chain of command and 
procedures city officials should follow to set in motion state and federal 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell said he decided to distribute the earthquake instructions only after a 
campaign volunteer received authorization to do so from Peggy Brutsche, 
director of emergency services planning and training for the Los Angeles 
chapter of the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign worker, Bill Foss, said he gave Brutsche two copies of the 
two-sided flyer three weeks ago, before any were passed out, and that Brutsche 
told him it would be OK to use it. 
</P>
<P>
"I put it in her hand and specifically pointed to the disclaimer, and she saw 
the other side had a political message on it," Foss said. "I really, honestly, 
feel that we covered our bases as best we could. We really tried to do the 
right thing." 
</P>
<P>
Both Maxwell and Foss said they were shocked later to learn that Red Cross 
officials were upset about the flyer. Both said Brutsche must have been unaware 
of the organization's policies when she gave Foss permission to pass them out. 
</P>
<P>
Brutsche was out of town. But McGinley, who said she spoke to Brutsche on 
Friday about the incident, insisted that Brutsche did not know the announcement 
was going to be distributed on the back of a political statement. 
</P>
<P>
McGinley also disputed the contention that Brutsche was unaware of the 
organization's policies and said Maxwell simply misunderstood the rules. 
</P>
<P>
Brutsche "is our expert on the guidelines," McGinley said. "She deals with 
these kinds of requests very routinely. . . . She was very familiar and very 
well qualified to make these decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Ilion, the South Bay district spokesman for the Red Cross, said he 
received several angry calls about the flyers before he asked Maxwell to stop 
distributing them. 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "We're trying to downplay the incident because it sounded like a 
misunderstanding on Mr. Maxwell's part, and we know it's election time and 
didn't want this to be a negative reflection on him."

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: CAPTURING MEMORIES OF A BYGONE LOMITA ON VIDEOTAPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Julia Marie Steigh remembers a Lomita without a sheriff's station, park, 
library or even a city charter. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, adding those elements to Lomita changed the small South Bay 
city, the 74-year-old resident said. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that bothers me about all the changes is we have so much 
traffic," she said. "But my husband and I love Lomita and hope to stay here 
always." 
</P>
<P>
Steigh recounted 67 years of life in Lomita at a recent meeting of the Lomita 
Historical Society. Her testimony was captured on videotape and will become 
part of an oral history of Lomita as seen through the eyes of its longtime 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Historical Society President Cindy Beiro said she plans to edit several 
interviews together into one videotape when she gets enough material for a 
two-hour tape. She also plans to get footage of historical sites in Lomita, 
putting together a presentation that is easy to watch and accessible to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
"We are capturing history for the future of our town," she said. "When people 
look at these tapes 50 years from now, it's going to blow their minds." 
</P>
<P>
Beiro got the idea while watching 50-year-old footage of the building of 
Kiwanis Hall in Lomita. The film was incorporated into a video presentation on 
the history of the Lomita-Harbor City Kiwanis Club and showed men in plaid 
shirts and baggy overalls building the hall by hand, against a backdrop of open 
lots and streets lined with with old Fords. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked at this video of how it was 50 years ago, and I thought it was 
unbelievably intriguing. It lives when it's videotaped. People might not take 
the time to read about history. But with video, you might have a better 
attention span." 
</P>
<P>
Although gathering oral histories is nothing new to historical societies, the 
use of videotape is just now becoming established, according to Terri 
Schorzman, program manager of a video history project at the Smithsonian 
Institution in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just starting to look at how we can use videotape as historical 
documentation," she said. "I think it's a great way to capture a community and 
how it developed. You can reach out to a lot of people, because people are so 
tuned in to visual media anyway." 
</P>
<P>
City historians in Torrance, Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach have embarked on 
oral history projects using audiotape and are planning to make use of videotape 
in the future. The city of Carson, Harbor College and UCLA also have 
collections of oral histories on audiotape. 
</P>
<P>
But videotapes are far more expensive to produce than audiotapes, Schorzman 
said. There is practically no limit to how much a city can invest in equipment 
and staff to produce archival or broadcast-quality images. 
</P>
<P>
Beiro is offsetting the cost by using talented volunteers to film and produce 
the videotapes. The city of Hermosa Beach is trying to line up journalism and 
film students to record its oral history. 
</P>
<P>
Steigh was the fourth person to be interviewed by the society. Two former 
mayors and a community leader were also videotaped. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Cole, a former mayor and journalist, recalled his days at Narbonne High 
School before it was relocated to Harbor City. The building at the Lomita site 
became Alexander Fleming Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
One of his most vivid memories is of a day during World War II when a P-38 
fighter circled the school and crashed a block away. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first time war was brought to Lomita," he said. "It crashed in a 
victory garden right between two houses. We all ran over there." 
</P>
<P>
He also recounted how Lomita was once a sprawling unincorporated community, 
stretching west to the sea, and south over the Palos Verdes Peninsula to where 
Marineland used to be. Neighboring cities began annexing portions of the 
community and finally drove the city to incorporate in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
"We want details that were never presented in writing," Beiro said. "We have 
the fact that it snowed in Lomita one year, and when boats floated down the 
streets" during a flood. 
</P>
<P>
Cole addressed that 1948 snowstorm. "Our greatest thrill was throwing snowballs 
at the teachers as they rode to school," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
According to Beiro, Steigh was so nervous about the interview that she asked 
that members not be notified of the meeting. Beiro decided to videotape the 
interview herself, so her cameraman would not fluster Steigh with directions. 
</P>
<P>
"The women are so shy," Beiro said. "The men will get up there and just go on 
and on." 
</P>
<P>
The ordeal over, Steigh let out a sigh of relief and accepted congratulations, 
along with a slice of cake. She told society members how the first mayor of 
Lomita rode to high school on a horse. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always afraid of horses," she said. "And he used to chase me up and down 
the street with that darn horse." BERNICE HIRABAYASHI

The Redondo Beach of old -- with its Victorian turrets, gables and wide 
verandas -- will be on view today from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. during a historical 
and architectural home tour sponsored by the Redondo Beach Historical Society 
and the Dolphins Junior Women's Club. Eleven historic homes will be opened to 
visitors, and the tour also will include some "drive by" examples of period 
architecture in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a chance to see a variety of historical homes that are the best of 
what Redondo has to offer," tour coordinator Kathleen Ackley said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the gems are a 1923 Mission Revival triplex, which still has its original 
moldings and built-in dining room cabinet, a Victorian beach cottage from the 
1880s with a spiral staircase and an 1890-era Queen Anne cottage that is 
undergoing complete restoration. The two cottages were once near the harbor and 
were moved to their present sites by mule team in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets may be purchased during tour hours at Redondo Beach City Hall, Pacific 
Coast Highway at Diamond Street, or at the street fair taking place outside 
City Hall. The cost is $15, $12 for seniors and students with identification. 
The annual tour was started eight years ago to raise funds for historic 
preservation. Because so many old homes are lost each year to development, 
Ackley said, "we work very hard to preserve the ones we can." GERALD FARIS

Scott Sisson kicked a 27-yard field goal with 61 seconds left, and unbeaten and 
11th-ranked Georgia Tech settled for a 13-13 tie with North Carolina on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The tie ended a nine-game winning streak by Georgia Tech, 5-0-1 overall and 
3-0-1 in the Atlantic Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Tar Heels (4-2-1, 1-1-1) twice stopped Georgia Tech inside the 10-yard line 
in the fourth quarter. The second time prompted Sisson's kick. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech had four turnovers, the biggest coming when Willie Clay fumbled 
Scott McAllister's punt and Reggie Clark recovered for North Carolina at the 
Yellow Jacket six. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later, Natrone Means scored on a five-yard run with 13:18 left, and 
the Tar Heels led, 13-10. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech then drove from its 14 in 16 plays over nearly eight minutes 
before being held on four plays from the North Carolina four. 
</P>
<P>
A 38-yard pass play from Shawn Jones to Tom Covington later took Georgia Tech 
to the North Carolina eight. The Tar Heel defense held again, setting up 
Sisson's tying kick.

After a "fumblerooskie" play backfired on Florida State and helped Auburn tie 
the score, Jim Von Wyl kicked a 38-yard field goal with two seconds remaining, 
moving the fifth-ranked Tigers into the thick of the national championship race 
with a 20-17 victory over the seventh-ranked Seminoles Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Stan White helped set up the winning kick with a fourth-down, 
21-yard completion to Herbert Casey. After letting the clock run down to six 
seconds, Von Wyl came on to kick his second game-winner of the year. Two weeks 
ago, his 30-yarder beat Louisiana Tech, 16-14. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy Danley tied the score, 17-17, diving over from the two with 3:47 
remaining to cap a 57-yard drive that started after the blown "fumblerooskie." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Casey Weldon put the ball on the ground for a lineman to pick up, 
but it was Auburn's Walter Tate who covered it. 
</P>
<P>
After Danley's touchdown, Weldon, who came off the bench to pass for 244 yards, 
led the Seminoles back to the Auburn 37. But on fourth and five, Weldon was 
grabbed by Ricky Sutton, stumbled backwards while trying to keep his balance 
and finally fell for a 22-yard loss with 1:04 to play. 
</P>
<P>
That led to Von Wyl's kick. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn (5-0-1), which came back from a 17-7 halftime deficit, won on a Saturday 
when two higher-ranked teams, No. 2 Miami and No. 3 Tennessee, were beaten. 
Tennessee's 9-6 loss to Alabama was particularly important to Auburn, moving 
the Tigers into sole possession of first place in the Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State (4-2) had its national championship hopes dashed as Auburn 
snapped a three-game losing streak in the series.

<P>
Weldon, who had passed for only 223 yards in Florida State's first five games, 
entered the game late in the first quarter in place of starter Brad Johnson and 
sparked the Seminoles to 17 second-quarter points. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama 9, No. 3 Tennessee 6 -- Alabama came up with an unorthodox way to 
generate some offense in the midst of a defensive struggle, and Philip Doyle 
made it pay off. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a 9-6 upset of No. 3 Tennessee Saturday at Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The offense came in the form of a blocked field-goal attempt with 1:35 left. 
The ball bounced hard off the chest of the Crimson Tide's Stacy Harrison and 
bounced 23 yards downfield to the Tennessee 37. 
</P>
<P>
Four plays later, Doyle won it with a 47-yard field goal, his third of the 
game, as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
It was a big victory for Alabama Coach Gene Stallings, whose team improved to 
3-3, 2-2 in the Southeastern Conference. Tennessee fell to 4-1-2 and 2-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
The blocked field goal "worked out great for us," Stallings said. "It gave us 
30 or 40 yards when we needed offense. It was great to get that. We hadn't made 
that much in a while." 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee had a nation-leading, 12-game unbeaten streak halted. 
</P>
<P>
No. 17 Florida 59, Akron 0 -- The Gators (6-1), coming off a 45-3 loss to 
Tennessee, bounced back with an easy victory over outmanned Akron at 
Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Shane Matthews paced an offense that produced 595 yards, completing 
20 of 32 passes for 283 yards and three touchdowns. Willie McClendon rushed for 
105 yards and one score. 
</P>
<P>
Akron (3-4-1) gained only 87 yards and didn't make a first down in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia 39, Vanderbilt 28 -- Garrison Hearst rushed for 127 yards and two 
touchdowns and Joe Dupree and Andre Hastings connected on a 68-yard touchdown 
pass play for the Bulldogs in an SEC game at Athens, Ga. The Bulldogs (4-3, 
2-2) also got a 58-yard touchdown run from Larry Ware and John Kasay kicked 
field goals of 38 and 48 yards. It was the 21st consecutive SEC road loss for 
the Commodores (1-5, 1-3). 
</P>
<P>
LSU 30, Kentucky 20 -- Harvey Williams rushed for a career-high 213 yards in 28 
carries, scored on a 60-yard run, and caught a four-yard touchdown pass to lead 
Louisiana State (4-2, 2-2) over the Wildcats (2-5, 1-2) at Baton Rogue, La. 
</P>
<P>
No. 18 Mississippi 42, Arkansas State 13 -- Randy Baldwin scored four 
touchdowns in the first 19 minutes as Ole Miss (6-1) routed the Division I-AA 
Indians at Oxford, Miss. The Rebels rolled up 495 yards, one shy of their 
season high. They also ensured a second consecutive winning season, the first 
time Ole Miss has accomplished that since 1970-71.

DIVISION I-AA CITADEL USES WISHBONE TO KNOCK OFF SOUTH CAROLINA, 38-35 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Quarterback Jack Douglas scored from the one on fourth down with 22 seconds 
left to give The Citadel a 38-35 victory over South Carolina Saturday at 
Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Division I-AA Bulldogs' first victory over South Carolina since 1950 
and first in Columbia since 1919. It was also the Gamecocks' first loss to a 
I-AA opponent since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas rushed for 104 yards and completed seven of nine passes for 125 yards 
in directing the Bulldogs' wishbone attack. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time South Carolina had seen the wishbone since 1977 -- and it 
showed. The Citadel moved the ball at will, gaining 396 yards against the 
fourth-ranked defense in the nation, which had been giving up only 232 yards a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs (4-3) scored 10 points in the final 3:11 to earn the victory 
before a crowd of 63,000 at Williams-Brice Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
After The Citadel made it 35-31 on Howard Barnard's 37-yard field goal, 
Torrence Forney recovered the ensuing onside kick for the Bulldogs at the South 
Carolina 41-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas hooked up with Terrance Young on a 24-yard pass to the 16. Douglas 
fumbled on the next play, but the Bulldogs recovered at the 10. Douglas scored 
four plays later. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina Coach Sparky Woods said the Gamecocks (4-2) weren't looking past 
the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
"This game was a heartbreaker," he said. "They're a tough football team." 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina had enough yards (480) on offense to win, just not enough 
points. 
</P>
<P>
No. 22 Clemson 24, North Carolina State 17 -- The Tigers needed every advantage 
their nationally- ranked defense could provide to escape with an Atlantic Coast 
Conference victory over the Wolfpack at Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
The struggle between Clemson, ranked second in total defense, and the Wolfpack, 
ranked seventh, featured seven fumbles -- four by N.C. State. The third fumble 
set up fullback Howard Hall's one-yard touchdown with 3:02 left that gave the 
Tigers the victory. The fourth came on the ensuing kickoff, with Clemson's 
David Joy recovering. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson, 6-2, 3-2 in the ACC, and N.C. State (4-4, 2-4) were tied, 17-17, after 
three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson's Ronald Williams fumbled inside the Wolfpack 20 with 5:05 left, but 
N.C. State quarterback Terry Jordan returned the favor three plays later to 
give the Tigers the ball at the 11. Hall scored two plays later. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State rolled up 328 yards against a defense that has been 
allowing an average of 202 a game. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson quarterback DeChane Cameron completed 14 of 26 passes for 182 yards and 
Williams rushed for 95 yards in 26 carries, 87 yards coming in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland 23, Duke 20 -- Dan DeArmas kicked three field goals in the second 
half, including the game-winning 20-yarder with 50 seconds left, as the 
Terrapins (3-4, 0-3) held off the Blue Devils (3-4, 0-3) in an ACC game at 
Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Devil quarterback Billy Ray had thrown a 27-yard touchdown pass to Walter 
Jones with 12 minutes left to tie the score, 20-20. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Mississippi 23, Memphis State 7 -- Brett Favre's passing set up two 
touchdowns and Jim Taylor kicked three field goals to lead the Golden Eagles 
(6-2) over the Tigers (3-3-1) at Hattiesburg, Miss. Southern Mississippi held 
Memphis State to 191 yards and 11 first downs.

TOREROS SHUT DOWN WHITTIER; 
</P>
<P>
USD: PRESSURE FROM DEFENSIVE FRONT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN 16-3 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WHITTIER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With six sacks, three interceptions, two recovered fumbles and a blocked punt, 
the University of San Diego's big-play defense made the biggest difference 
Saturday night as the Toreros defeated Whittier, 16-3, for the fifth 
consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
USD, which improved to 5-2 with two road games remaining, has now outscored the 
Poets, 104-25, the past five years. Whittier fell to 0-6 and has not won in its 
past seven games dating to last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure from the defensive front was the difference. They were 
impressive," said defensive back Darryl Jackson, who intercepted his third pass 
of the season with 7:18 left. "They helped us a lot. It made it a lot easier to 
cover their receivers." 
</P>
<P>
After trailing, 3-0, in the first quarter, USD tied the score on Dave 
Bergmann's first of three field goals. The Toreros then scored a touchdown in 
the second quarter and two field goals in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
While USD's offense was so-so and typically conservative -- it had 265 total 
yards, including 153 rushing -- the defense was typically impressive. 
</P>
<P>
USD allowed only 137 yards, 56 in the second half. Whittier, which has been 
struggling on offense all season and had fumbled 19 times in five games, 
managed only 76 yards rushing and 61 passing, completing nine of 24 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Senior linebacker Lenny Territo had three sacks and Christian Sirek, John 
Gillis and Bobby Tubbs each had one. Gillis, a senior and the Toreros' punter, 
was starting for only the second time in his career. Tubbs is a freshman, Sirek 
a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive coordinator Kevin McGarry was pleased with his unit's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"We got some nice pressure without even blitzing very much," said McGarry, who 
noted that he called for only five blitzes, all in the first half. "After that, 
we just held back. We were getting good pressure even without it." 
</P>
<P>
Whittier scored first. After a 41-yard drive stalled at the USD 15, Michael 
Westmoreland kicked a 32-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
USD tied the score on a 24-yard field goal 1:24 into the second quarter. The 
kick followed a nine-play, 62-yard drive that stalled when USD failed to score 
after gaining a first and goal at the five. 
</P>
<P>
Neither team moved the ball much the rest of the first half, but USD got a huge 
break when Darby Barrett partially blocked Richard Bernard's punt with 1:30 
remaining and the Toreros took over at the Poet 18. 
</P>
<P>
Six plays later with 19 seconds left, quarterback Brendan Murphy found running 
back John Eck in the end zone for a two-yard touchdown. On the previous play, 
Whittier defensive back Chad Crites was called for pass interference, having 
jumped on Eck's back on a similar play, and USD was given an automatic first 
down. 
</P>
<P>
USD's Scott Sporrer just missed getting his second 100-yard game of the season, 
finishing with 97 yards in 19 carries.

A THOUGHTFUL WAY TO MATURE; 
</P>
<P>
THE PLATO SOCIETY KEEPS RETIREES ALIVE, ALERT AND STIMULATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY ABRAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Francis Meyers, retired businessman and active musician, believes that people 
die fromthe top down. Let the mind rot and the body goes to pot; keep the brain 
clicking and theheart will go on ticking. 
</P>
<P>
And by his calculations, the shortest distance between retirement and the 
cemetery runsstraight through Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers made his discovery not long after he sold his jewelry-manufacturing 
business and began making the rounds of retirement clubs. Too often, he found 
that activities were limited to card-playing in the clubhouse, spiced with 
trips to the Nevada gambling city. 
</P>
<P>
Then, 10 years ago, when things were looking as bleak as the Arabian desert, 
Meyers stumbled across a green and sparkling oasis. He saw a newspaper story 
about a group being formed by UCLA Extension which promised to turn dubious 
leisure into mental reinvigoration. 
</P>
<P>
The Plato Society, he learned, was designed for people like him, people who 
remained curious about the world, who wanted to explore topics they hadn't had 
time for while careers and families consumed their waking hours. 
</P>
<P>
The society -- its name is an acronym for Perpetual Learning and Teaching 
Organization, not the ancient Greek philosopher -- proposed that its retired 
and semi-retired members would be "students, teachers, staff, volunteers and 
alumni" in a self-supporting, cooperative learning venture. Its chief 
enterprise would be study-discussion groups exploring subjects chosen by its 
members. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a beeline for the phone that day and I've been here ever since," says 
Meyers, recalling events at the society's headquarters in Westwood. "I was 
interested in everything. I didn't care what the subject was, I was going to 
learn something." 
</P>
<P>
A decade later, Meyers' prescription for a fruitful life includes studying 
plate tectonics, the philosophy of science and, currently, the legacy of 
Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. 
</P>
<P>
But Meyers' belief that the society has been a lifesaver is more than 
theoretical. He credits his involvement in the group with helping him survive a 
heart bypass operation in 1984, the year he was the society's president. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Meyers sums up his philosophy of life this way: "An active mind and an 
active interest and a desire that you've got to find out something -- you 
haven't got time to die." 
</P>
<P>
Granted, Meyers may be somewhat atypical. A professional musician before World 
War II, he still plays violin once a week with a chamber music group and 
indulges his passion for books, finding particular joy in haunting secondhand 
bookstores. He also has thrown himself into helping develop education programs 
for older people throughout the Western states. 
</P>
<P>
But his story is only one example of the positive effects Plato has had on the 
lives of its members according to Adriane Lorin, the society's staff 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
After a series of bouts with cancer, one member in his 80s told Lorin that he 
had about given up on life. At this crucial juncture, he continued, "I 
remembered Plato and I knew that I had to come back." Adds Lorin, "And by God 
he is." 
</P>
<P>
While increasing longevity is not the purpose of Plato -- or a scientifically 
proved fact about the group -- it may show why the society evokes fierce 
loyalty among its members who are celebrating its 10th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
Even without this possible added benefit, Plato's students clearly relish the 
stimulation of their courses. 
</P>
<P>
Take that class on Freud. At 10 o'clock on a gray morning, the members gathered 
in a windowless room in a nondescript building in Westwood, armed with books, 
paper, pens, experience and enthusiasm. The cheerfulness of the group belied 
its purpose, exploring the recesses of the mind, following the trails of 
explorers who first visited the dark places where emotions rise to overwhelm 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
This day, it was Sam Rowe's turn to lead the class -- as each member does 
sooner or later. His subject was Alfred Adler, Freud's onetime disciple who 
split from his mentor to propound his own theories. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe, 75 and a retired professor from USC, apologized for being somewhat 
under-prepared. But that said, he launched into a brief history of Adler's life 
and thought. An hour into the discussion, class members were thumbing through 
books or delving into their own memories to come up with comments on the 
psychiatrist's views of childhood and how it shapes adults. 
</P>
<P>
The society itself is continually being reshaped by its members. Initially 
limited to 100 members, the current limit is 375, a number that still causes 
some debate. The society is supposed to remain small enough to be cozy but also 
must collect enough in fees to pay for its activities. 
</P>
<P>
Members pay $375 annually for the society's classes, special lectures, field 
trips and other functions, including extracurricular study groups that meet in 
members' homes. Members must be at least 50 years old and have at least 20 
years experience in the working world. 
</P>
<P>
Topics for seminars are chosen by group members who vote on a list of 
suggestions compiled by a committee. Topics have ranged from "The Mayan Age of 
Splendor" to energy options. Current classes include the novels of Jane Austen 
and the history of the American Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Well before interest in the Civil War was renewed by the recent PBS television 
series, the Plato Society had fought the War Between the States several times, 
Lorin notes. 
</P>
<P>
As its membership has expanded, the group's ambitions also have broadened, says 
President William Carter, 66, a former development and investment banker who 
has been a member for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Carter expects that Plato Society branches will be founded 
in Los Angeles County in the next decade. One such spinoff already exists at 
Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, whose principal interests are European history and World War II, says 
that groups like Plato are part of the "gray wave of the future" that will be 
created to meet the needs of an aging but active population in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Plato's core, however, continues to be its seminars, lasting from seven to 14 
weeks with each class meeting two hours a week. Class size generally is limited 
to 15 people with one person serving as coordinator. Each participant is 
expected to study and deliver a lecture on an aspect of the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Lorin concedes that this doesn't turn out to be everyone's cup of tea. Although 
all potential members are interviewed by other members to determine their 
interests, she says this informal screening doesn't always work. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people who have gotten into Plato who should never have gotten into 
Plato," she says, adding that most of them quit. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the occasional bad match, the society stresses a kind of 
egalitarianism. New members aren't asked what they did or how much education 
they have. Rather the emphasis is on what new members want to learn. 
</P>
<P>
"What we like to tell people who are joining Plato is take a study group in 
something about which you know nothing because you can learn the most that 
way," Lorin said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Meyers seems to relish most the thoroughly unpragmatic nature of Plato. 
"What we're having here is the purest form of education, learning for the sake 
of learning," he says. "No exams, no grades, no degrees. None of that. Just 
sheer interest in the subject."

ALICE KAHN: GOING DOWN MEMORY LANE IN HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICE KAHN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Weird to be in high school again after all these years. Some things are the 
same; some things are different. The French have an expression for this, but I 
don't know what it is because I took Spanish. I heard it was easier. 
</P>
<P>
One thing you immediately notice that is different is that everyone in class 
seems to be over 40. It's Back to School Night at my daughter's high school, 
and for one evening I must live through a condensed version of what she lives 
through every day. 
</P>
<P>
Our classes are 10 minutes instead of 50, which is about as long as I could 
ever sit still in a high school class. When the bell rings, we must figure out 
the difficult task: how to get from the top of H Building to the bottom of C 
Building in five minutes. Even aerobically correct mothers come panting in 
late, saying, "This is impossible." 
</P>
<P>
That five-minute fix of hall time is still my favorite part of high school. I 
walk through the halls as I did then, my eyes scanning for Whom I Know. 
</P>
<P>
There are three kinds of parents I see at Back to School Night. There are 
people who look familiar and I can't place. These are the people I'll pass and 
then suddenly stop dead and scream down the hall of G Building, "Hey, you're my 
gynecologist!" 
</P>
<P>
There are the parents I don't know. We sit in class together and share grins of 
solidarity as the teacher says, "Of course, your student has told you that the 
essay is due tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the parents I know from various past lives: political groups, 
support groups, Lamaze class, our kids' nursery school, grade school, camp, 
Brownies, as well as old friends from the days when we had time for a social 
life. Sometimes we look at each other as if we are mirror images of Dorian 
Gray. 
</P>
<P>
"Alice, is that you?" says some old lady. I realize with horror that she's my 
age! 
</P>
<P>
I say "Hi" in C Hall to Bob and Roxanne. (Still together, I note.) Their 
daughter is a senior. "Where's Leah going to college?" I ask them. 
</P>
<P>
"As close to the beach as possible," is the reply. 
</P>
<P>
Bob -- Butcher Bob, as I knew him when his long black hair was restrained with 
a macrame headband -- is right on target. His beard is graying. But his wife 
Roxanne is a traitor. Her blond hair isn't even turning dishwater brown. 
There's not a wrinkle in her face. "Throw her in the sun," I say as I dash off 
to Trig. 
</P>
<P>
We pass a guy named Steve who was there for the baby boy he had in 1974, the 
year he shaved his head. The son he had named Moonlight is currently going by 
the name of Dan. 
</P>
<P>
Steve and his now ex-wife sat side by side in class, each holding a baby from 
their latest marriages. All very friendly. And Steve has no need to shave his 
head anymore. One more year and time will accomplish the job. 
</P>
<P>
As we go through the classes, I realize how the scene changes, depending on 
what role you're playing. When I was a student, I thought that all that the 
teachers cared about was coming up with irrational and boring assignments. I 
viewed it as my role then to assert creative control of the classroom through a 
constant volley of wisecracks. Through my cleverness, I spent a lot of time 
writing "I Will Not" statements and managed to keep my grade-point average 
down. 
</P>
<P>
In the late '60s, when it was my turn to serve on the other side of the desk, 
as a young high school teacher, I saw the obstacles to creative teaching. It 
wasn't just the pay, it was the politics. 
</P>
<P>
Once, when I explained my course at a Back to School Night, a dad suddenly 
stood up, waved the book I had assigned and screamed, "You are blaspheming 
God's name!" 
</P>
<P>
The book was Ray Bradbury's "The Martian Chronicles." 
</P>
<P>
In class tonight, I see the teachers struggling to juggle the various political 
dumbbells that might smack them in the head. 
</P>
<P>
The journalism teacher explains that the students are critiquing humor columns 
that have appeared recently in the school paper to see if they are racist or 
sexist. (I really need to hear about offensive humor columns when I'm off 
duty!) 
</P>
<P>
The biology teacher answers a parent by saying that no, she did not, intend to 
kill frogs. "We have computer programs to dissect frogs now," she says. The 
approving nod from the parent tells the teacher she has passed. 
</P>
<P>
The English teacher explains that they are reading Arthur Miller's "The 
Crucible." A father raises his hand. "Are you linking that to McCarthyism and 
the Communist witch hunts?" 
</P>
<P>
Of course, she tells him, that's the whole point. He says, "Good! Good!" 
</P>
<P>
"Are you linking it to the Salem witch hunts?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
She stares at me uncertainly. Dumb parents are not in her contract. 
</P>
<P>
Now, why do I still do things like that? 
</P>
<P>
One more smart-alecky question from you, Alice, and you'll have to write 100 
times: "I will act like a grown-up on parents' night."

Blaise Mercadante likes to wear his lucky cap for his boys. 
</P>
<P>
It's a beaut of a cap, a symphony in blue-and-white flannel stitched in honor 
of the Dodgers so long ago it has a "B" on it. For their old haunt, Brooklyn. 
Or for Blaise, depending on how you look at it. Even more serendipitous, once 
the cap fell into Mercadante's hands, it took on a strange and wonderful 
dimension: 
</P>
<P>
It started bringing luck to Blaise's boys. 
</P>
<P>
Mercadante noticed the cap's unusual powers soon after he bought it at Baseball 
City in May. He would wear it to his son Kegan's Westlake Village all-star 
games, and the team would win. When he didn't wear it, they would lose. 
</P>
<P>
Then came a game Mercadante was forced to miss because he had a meeting at the 
ad agency Batten, Barton, Durstine &amp; Osborn Inc., where he's a senior vice 
president. But when Mercadante woke up Kegan the day of the game, the 
8-year-old looked him full in the face and said: "You're going to wear the cap, 
aren't you?" 
</P>
<P>
What's a father to do? 
</P>
<P>
"The game started at 5 o'clock," says Mercadante, 37. "So, at 5 o'clock, I put 
the cap on. The game usually lasts two hours, so I wore it until 7, and when I 
got home, sure enough, they'd won." 
</P>
<P>
Mercadante, the father of four, is rather proud that he's considered the 
"designated breeder" of his agency, a player in a high-powered field known for 
its preponderance of single people. He certainly isn't the only successful man 
who's trying to juggle home and work hats in the '90s, but he may be one of the 
more resourceful ones. 
</P>
<P>
These days, men who streak to the top at work don't fit the old stereotype of 
the absentee dad whose biggest rewards were on the job. At the same time, 
they're probably not the forward-looking Daddy trackers who put more time into 
their families, even if it bruises their careers. 
</P>
<P>
These men are a cross between the two. Like dads of yore, they're heading full 
force toward stardom in their fields. But they're also taking on more 
responsibility at home -- picking up the groceries and the kids (even if 
couples may still clash on whether he's doing enough). Sometimes virtuosity at 
balancing the home-work scales is a must, because often the successful man has 
thrown in his lot with the successful woman. And she's working, too. 
</P>
<P>
So don't be fooled by men who set their career sights high -- which often means 
worshiping at the altar of their job, a particularly jealous mistress. Studies 
show they are still, typically, extremely concerned with their families. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, when Men's Life magazine surveyed 815 men for its debut issue this 
fall, five of every eight picked marriage as their top priority -- above money, 
sex, fame and career. A survey conducted for the Los Angeles Times in July 
found that 80% of the Southern California men who responded considered their 
families to be very important; slightly fewer, 76%, said they valued their 
careers as highly. 
</P>
<P>
What all this means is that women aren't the only gender to suffer from the 
double trouble that comes from juggling a job and family, even though they have 
been getting much of the ink lately. Men are singing the work-versus-home 
blues, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Men have a tendency to imagine that they're the only ones who have this 
work-family conflict," says Robert Weiss, research professor at the University 
of Massachusetts in Boston. "They kind of feel torn and feel that they're not 
doing right by their kids, and they want to do right by their kids, yet how can 
they if they're going to hold down a job and hold down their end of things at 
home?" 
</P>
<P>
In his new book, "Staying the Course: The Emotional and Social Lives of Men Who 
Do Well at Work," Weiss talks about the different -- and much misunderstood -- 
way men resolve the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"I think men resolve it by saying, 'I'm working for my family, so in a way, I'm 
contributing to my family by knocking myself out at work, by running to get the 
plane and stuff like that.' " Weiss said. "But at the same time, I think about 
a third of our sample expressed some remorse over not having been more 
available while their kids were growing up." 
</P>
<P>
Weiss' conclusions put a different spin on family surveys that paint men as 
career-aholics; in The Times' poll, slightly more than half the men who 
responded said their parenting had suffered because of their demanding jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"They give a lot of energy to work," says Weiss, an avuncular academic who also 
lectures in the psychiatry department at Harvard Medical School's Massachusetts 
Mental Health Center. "You might even say they give more energy to work than 
they do directly to family. But that's because work is so fundamental to 
everything else. It isn't because they care more for work than family. It's 
that work makes it possible for them to be the kind of person for their family 
they feel they ought to be." 
</P>
<P>
Weiss' conclusions stem from a five-year study in the 1980s of 80 successful 
men ages 35 to 55, two-thirds of whom have wives who work at least part time. 
What he found was that even as gender roles inch toward the future, the family 
lives of men established in their careers are still largely traditional. 
</P>
<P>
Dad still spends long hours at the office and Mom is still in charge of the 
home, whether or not she also works outside it. That arrangement has gotten 
women's dander up, a source of domestic heat that has scorched recent polls by 
the Roper Organization. Women, the polls show, have been getting angrier and 
angrier over the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
But men, it seems, see lopsided home duties as an even trade because working 
wives earn only 40% of the family income, according to 1989 figures supplied by 
the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"Men have some intuitive sense of what statistics bear out," says Warren 
Farrell, the San Diego-based author of "Why Men Are the Way They Are." 
</P>
<P>
"The man senses that when there are children, the woman retains three options: 
Option one is to be full-time involved with the kids. Option two is to be 
full-time involved with work. And option three is to do some combination of 
both. 
</P>
<P>
"The man sees his life as having three slightly different options: Option one 
is to work full time. Option two is to work full time. And option three is to 
work two jobs or to intensify his commitment to work. 
</P>
<P>
"So what he sees is an obligation to prepare himself to take jobs he likes 
less, that produce (more) of the income. What happens is that he fears that if 
he spends time with the children or spends time doing housework, he's taking 
away from his ability to keep ahead enough at work to get the kind of 
promotions to be able to produce income at that level." 
</P>
<P>
John Lorelli, 44, finds his job as the manager of the bookstore at Santa 
Barbara City College to be extremely demanding -- and stressful. And that's 
precisely what he likes about it. 
</P>
<P>
"From the morning of the fourth of September through the afternoon of the 
seventh of September, we had 7,500 customers go through our store," he says. 
"It's a tremendous challenge. You're responsible for moving tons of books from 
one end of the country and getting them into your store and having it all ready 
and having enough of them, and you have to deal with all the faculty and all 
the students. It's very challenging." 
</P>
<P>
Lorelli figures he probably worked 60 hours that week. In a typical week, he'll 
clock in a hefty 50 hours. He and his wife, Amy Madsen, also are parents of a 
6-month-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, Lorelli misses him. "He's the most beautiful baby in 
the entire world," Lorelli swoons. "He has the most gorgeous smile." There are 
times, though, when Lorelli doesn't see that smile very often. On Thursdays, 
tiny Andrew stays with his grandmother while his mother works toward her 
master's degree in English and his father teaches a course on the Vietnam War 
at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
"The only time he sees his parents is briefly in the morning," Lorelli says. 
"He sees me briefly in the late afternoon and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
And forget the first week of school. "I saw him in the morning. I hated it. 
Because he's just so much fun. He's a happy, bouncy kid. I don't like it, but 
the demands of the job have to be met. And the way it gets done is you have to 
devote attention to it. It doesn't run on automatic pilot." 
</P>
<P>
Lorelli's love for his son -- despite the long hours he logs away from home -- 
is not unusual. "I think women have a very faulty understanding of the 
intensity of men's investment in their children," says Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
"That shows up especially when a marriage ends and the guy fights the woman for 
custody or demands liberal visitation, and the woman says something like, 'When 
you were at home, you weren't that involved with the kids. You'd come home late 
and you'd hide behind the television set and you'd tell the kids to go play, 
and weekends you'd spend playing tennis, yourself, or watching television. And 
now the marriage is over, and you're suddenly a devoted father. I don't believe 
it.' 
</P>
<P>
"And the thing that they (women) miss is that by working hard, the guys felt 
themselves contributing to their kids. Now you can't be a father simply by 
being a presence in the house, because you're not in the house at all," Weiss 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Pulido, a happily married marketing vice president for Pizza Hut's western 
division, makes sure his three children have scheduled chunks of his busy week. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday evenings, which are always reserved for family, the Pulidos go 
bowling en masse or make ice cream runs. On Sunday evenings, the Pulidos hold 
"family councils," where everyone talks about what's coming up that week. After 
the group talk, Tim Pulido will have individual heart-to-hearts with his boys 
in their rooms; he calls the chats "one on ones." 
</P>
<P>
"Those three things form a lot of the family glue that helps us go through the 
pressures of everyday life," says Pulido, 35. "I really feel that the family is 
the most important thing. And I have an enormous impact on my children. If I'm 
not there, I don't have the opportunity to really build and shape their value 
system, I'm not there to build a sense of responsibility for them when they're 
growing up and helping them find their interests and talents. That's the major 
role of a parent." 
</P>
<P>
And having a family makes all that hard work on the job worthwhile, lending 
meaning to those grueling 60-hour weeks. Weiss found that of the 80 successful 
men he studied, only five were personally adrift, suggesting that a family life 
goes hand-in-hand with a dynamic work life. 
</P>
<P>
"That, in a way, is what it's all for," says Weiss. "They have their wives' 
pictures on their desks sometimes, or their kids' pictures on their desks. You 
say, 'Yeah, they've got their family's pictures on the desk. They see more of 
the pictures than they do of their families, they spend so much time at work.' 
</P>
<P>
"Well, they're working partly because that's what they do for their families. 
Their work helps them be the kind of people they want to be for their families, 
namely capable people who have self-respect and the respect of others." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Cauer, father of newborn Alexandra, works a merciless six-day week at 
his violin-making business in Hollywood, sometimes until the early morning. "If 
you would give me a choice, and say for 30% less money, you now have free from 
5 o'clock on, I'd grab it immediately," says Cauer, 43. "But there's something 
else which forces me to sit here. One is responsibility to my customers. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a little bit like a heroin addict. If you ask a heroin addict, 'Would 
you like to stop?' they would say, 'Yes.' And half an hour later, they take 
some again. Yes, I would love to work 40 hours a week. But, in a business, 
there's always something to do, and in the evening, there's a choice. Do I go 
home or do I do one more job, which I need to get done? And very often work 
wins out." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, ironically, men may be more hard-driving at work because of their need 
for love, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"The man looks at the world, and he says, 'If I decide to become a secretary, 
there's no way, shape or form that any woman will marry me that I'm attracted 
to,' " Farrell says. " 'She's going to feel awkward about bringing me home at 
Thanksgiving and saying, "Guess what? I'm marrying Johnny. He's sensitive and 
he's a secretary, but he's going to take care of the kids and I'm going to 
support him.' Suddenly, her parents are giving her heart-to-heart advice. 
</P>
<P>
"So the distinction between the male and female choices of jobs is that men are 
trained from an early age to make their primary framework the jobs that earn 
the most, so that we still have, going to college, 85% or 90% of engineering 
students are males and over 90% of art history majors are females. And everyone 
knows art history majors with a BA will make a lot less than engineers with a 
BA. 
</P>
<P>
"For men, a business book is his relationship book because he knows that until 
he's reasonably successful, there will be no relationship," Farrell continued. 
"Fewer than 1% of women marry men who earn less, unless they believe they have 
potential. There will be no love for him unless he has a source of income. And 
if he puts time into child care and housework, he will undermine his ability to 
do what he must do, which is provide income for the family." 
</P>
<P>
The result, even among forward-looking couples, is that the man usually remains 
the primary breadwinner. That becomes even clearer when children enter the 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
"When children enter the house," says Weiss, "then everybody loses freedom. 
Women lose freedom to work to the same extent they would have liked to or would 
have been able to before. Men lose freedom not to work. 
</P>
<P>
"The advent of children makes men's work critical to the family. You can say it 
doesn't have to be that way. Men can stay home and take care of the kids, and 
to an extent that's so," he adds. "But it goes a little against the grain, that 
when the children are born mother produces them and Dad watches it happen. And 
that's a very different role. You can say, 'OK, why doesn't Dad then pick it 
up, and from now on it's shared.' And you can do that. It's just that you have 
to put some energy into that. If you do what comes naturally, the kid stays 
with Mom, for a while, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Viktor Budnik, a Venice-based food photographer, gets to see plenty of his 
family, thanks to a flexible arrangement that sends him out the door to work 
only two or three days a week. The rest of the week, he works at home. His 
wife, Janie Hewson, also works at home, where she's starting a business 
designing children's furniture while she rears 9-month-old Kimberly. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I could lead a total traditional life," says Budnik. 
</P>
<P>
Still, their marriage has its traditional side: Budnik brings home most of the 
bacon, at least for now. Having their own family has been very important to 
them, partly because both were adopted. Still, a decision to have another child 
will be determined by Budnik's income. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the main breadwinner," says Budnik, 41. 
</P>
<P>
And when small children come into the picture, housework usually becomes part 
of Mom's bailiwick. 
</P>
<P>
John Lorelli and his wife, Amy, split the housework evenly until Andrew 
arrived. "We had a really serious division, but honestly, she's doing most of 
it now," he says. "She's home more and she has really taken over control of 
running the household." 
</P>
<P>
"When they're very small, she's in charge of the kids," Weiss says of such 
marriages. "And she's in charge of the kids' milieu, and the milieu is the 
home. She's there. The household remains the woman's domain. She remains the 
person in charge. And if a guy doesn't vacuum as well as she thinks he ought 
to, she says, 'Gee, you missed a place.' " 
</P>
<P>
And if he's missing too many places, or if he's not home to brandish that 
vacuum in the first place, then that can mean trouble on the home front. 
Couples are most likely to clash if the wife also works outside the home, but 
there are skirmishes over housework when the wife stays home with the kids -- 
and finds herself in her work milieu every waking hour. 
</P>
<P>
There are other pitfalls. Couples dealing with home-work conflicts tend to 
become "adversaries" or accommodators" -- two of the "four A's" that Los 
Angeles organizational psychologist Jerome Adams has identified as roles people 
take on. Less popular are "allies," couples who split the responsibilities, and 
"acrobats," people who try to do everything full force. 
</P>
<P>
Adversaries compete for career opportunities. And with high-achieving 
accommodators, "one partner's career takes dominance and the other takes on an 
accommodating role to support the home life," he says. "Unfortunately, far too 
often the accommodating role has fallen on the female spouse. There's envy that 
begins to build in a relationship because the one that is really supporting the 
home life is watching the other spouse grow professionally over time." 
</P>
<P>
Healthiest, says Adams, are allies. When his children were small, ally Adams, 
45, carried his share of the parenting weight. "We didn't have a live-in, but 
we were able to make sure they were supervised. Actually, I made the commitment 
to take time off whenever the kids were sick. You make those trade-offs." 
</P>
<P>
If that isn't possible -- or desirable, from either spouse's perspective -- 
experts have another suggestion: Hire a housekeeper, if you can afford it. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost every woman I've had this discussion with, I say, 'Do you earn more 
than it costs to hire someone to work around the house?" says Farrell. "The 
answer is usually, 'Yes.' " 
</P>
<P>
Household help has been a godsend for John Phillips, 47, chairman of California 
Common Cause and a partner in a thriving public-interest law practice, and his 
wife, Linda Douglass, 42, the political reporter for KNBC-TV. Because they have 
a part-time nanny and a live-in housekeeper, they can spend all the time they 
are at home with Katie, their 7-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes all the difference in the world, no question," says Phillips. "To 
come home and do the shopping and cook the food, it would take all my 
discretionary time at home. That's one of the advantages of having children 
later in life. You may have less energy because when you're older you slow 
down, but you have that support base that gives you quality time when you're 
home." 
</P>
<P>
Successful men who do make a point of putting scarce time or money into their 
families say it is a worthwhile investment. 
</P>
<P>
Says Blaise Mercadante: "There is a depth of understanding or a stability or a 
centeredness that I feel that I have and people with strong families tend to 
have. I'm not just defined by my job but by my relationship with (my wife) Jan 
and by my family. In Westlake, a lot of our relationships with friends are 
through the church or people we know through the kids, through soccer and Boy 
Scouts. I walk around Westlake and I know everybody. It's an amazing richness."

The glorious galas: The Philharmonic Ball; Vista Del Mar Associates' theater 
gala surrounding "Jerome Robbins' Broadway"; the Jewel Gala for the USC School 
of Fine Arts; the Westside Guild of Childrens Hospital's Deck the Halls dinner 
and dance; the Hollywood Salute to Dennis Weaver. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, 550 of the city's elite dined and danced on stage at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion. White chrysanthemums rose from silver Champagne buckets on 
silver stilts. Vodka accompanied the cold caviar soup. Dessert came as white 
chocolate grand pianos filled with berries. John Williams conducted the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic in music ranging from waltzes to Glenn Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone loved it, giving president Liz Sobelle and co-chairs Joan MacLaughlin 
and Susan Rhoades high marks. The night was a special tribute to Philharmonic 
Executive Vice President and Managing Director Ernest Fleischmann. Kudos were 
heady -- from Stanley Beyer, Michael Connell, Fred Nicholas, Esther Wachtell 
and Gordon Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
The locally and internationally prominent were there: Priscilla and Curt 
Tamkin, Rocco (Eisenhower's personnel adviser) and Marion Siciliano (her art 
tribute was titled "Music in Ernest"), Donn and Peggy Miller, Francine Bardo, 
Glenn and Martha Mitchell, Dorie and Joe Pinola (off to the Taj Mahal), Keith 
and Bill Kieschnick (down from Napa), Count and Countess Frederic Chandon (who 
supplied the Moet &amp; Chandon Champagne), Budd Calisch, Ferrucio and Massimo 
Ferragamo (opening the new Ferragamo shop on Rodeo Drive), Bob and Connie 
Abell, David and Ginger Ludwick. 
</P>
<P>
The Vista Del Mar gala drew more than 1,000 guests to dinner at the Century 
Plaza and to the Shubert Theatre for "Jerome Robbins' Broadway." Good news: the 
party grossed $500,000 for family mental health services. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy and Betty Sigoloff hosted five tables of guests, including Joy and Josh 
Lipman and Sondra and Sy Strasberg. Paramount were Vista's president, George 
Konheim, and his wife, Eve, co-chairs Pam Schuman and Sylvia Mathes, and Vista 
Associates President Jean Leserman. 
</P>
<P>
At the Jewel Ball chaired by Frances Franklin and June MacMurray, Ed McMahon 
received the Lifetime Achievement Award. His fiancee, Joanna Ford, threw him a 
kiss when he revealed plans for a January wedding. 
</P>
<P>
Jewels from the Diamond Information Center, Faith Porter's whimsies, and 
fashions from Fred Hayman, David Hayes and Nolan Miler were among the 
highlights at show time. Later, Rudy Varon and His Orchestra played for 
dancers. Dean Lynn R. Matteson, who heads the beneficiary, the USC School of 
Fine Arts, said the scholarship fund from the Jewel galas now has an endowment 
of more than $1 million. Matteson also noted proudly that USC quarterback Todd 
Marinovich is an art major. Big donors Eric and Mattie Stanieck were in the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas decorating ideas were rampant at the Westside Guild's benefit in 
Brentwood. On preview night, members and their husbands made high bids on 
silent auction items. Holiday greens were everywhere in rooms decorated by Polo 
Ralph Lauren, Williams-Sonoma, Neiman Marcus, Gumps, Terra Cotta, Silver 
Birches, Foster-Ingersoll and Geary's. Giorgio Beverly Hills staged a fashion 
show on the pool diving board. 
</P>
<P>
Prepping for the holidays were Sandy and Turner Smith, Dayle and Kenneth Roath 
(Roath, CEO of Health Care Property Investors, is listed in the new Business 
Week as one of the top 1,000 corporate elite), Charles and Jessie Cale, Barbara 
and Lee Danielson, Marianne and Norman Sprague, Jim and Nancy Birdwell, Dennis 
and Brooks Holt, Liz and Dick Sobelle, Terry and Connie Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
Roast master Stephen J. Cannell, helped by an all-star cast including John 
Denver and Dorian Harewood, popped the goodwill barbs to Dennis Weaver. 
Nine-hundred joined in a Hollywood Salute to Weaver's 40th Year in television

SPORTS COVERAGE NEEDS LEVEL PLAYING FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ribaldry, vulgarity or even obscenity in the locker room? Horrors! Nudity, 
also? Shocking. How long have these shameful things been going on? 
</P>
<P>
Recently two columns, one in Sports and one in View, have asked some pertinent 
questions on who should be in the locker room. Mike Downey and Betty Cuniberti 
suggest that perhaps only team personnel should be admitted. That sounds good. 
Athletes come into the locker room after a game tired, sweaty and dirty. They 
want a shower and a change of clothing, and they want it without a delay for 
inane questions. 
</P>
<P>
How many insightful questions are asked? How many enlightening answers given? 
"Why did you throw that pitch that Canseco hit out of the park?" "It was a 
tough fight, ma, but I won." Most of the athletes perform better on the field 
than they do in interviews. Also, closing locker rooms might spare us the 
spectacle of overgrown boys spraying champagne over everyone, a ritual followed 
more for television than as a spontaneous reaction. 
</P>
<P>
I would challenge some of Cuniberti's generalizations. When can you make an 
accurate statement that all men are this way or all women are that way? 
</P>
<P>
Let me ask her, "If women are not interested in looking at male bodies, why are 
clubs such as Chippendale's successful? Why are male strippers in demand for 
some all-female entertainment? Do all males go to places where food and/or 
drink are served by women with exposed breasts? Do you think all males are 
titillated and all women bored by exposure to the opposite sex?" 
</P>
<P>
Overall, cheers to Cuniberti for focusing on the real problem: If locker rooms 
are to be open, let them be open to all reporters doing their jobs. And let's 
have a cessation of people accusing the females of prurient curiosity when 
simply carrying out their jobs. But please don't make a federal case out of 
locker room actions and comments.

PLACING THE BLAME FOR A LACK OF MORAL FIBER

I agree wholeheartedly with Josephson. But he forgot to mention one other 
reason (for young people's lack of ethics) besides parents, teachers and 
employers: television. 
</P>
<P>
I blame TV for lots of things, including crime and murder. Children see all 
these shows with killings and shootings, and they become desensitized and think 
it's no big deal to shoot somebody.

ROGER SIMON: TAXING THOSE EXPENSIVE DINNERS WOULD SEEM TO BE JUST DESSERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is now clear that Congress intends to wipe out the federal deficit by taking 
rich people's money away, stripping them down to their underwear and making 
them ride in cages through the streets. 
</P>
<P>
This is only fair. The American dream has always been to be as successful as 
you can be. A child born in poverty could work his way into wealth. This was 
the American way. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, members of Congress have decided that nobody in America should be 
wealthier than they are. 
</P>
<P>
Still, how do we define wealthy? By how much you earn? How much you have 
invested? How much you have inherited? 
</P>
<P>
And do we subtract how much you owe? Or whether you have to give half of it to 
Ivana Trump? 
</P>
<P>
It gets very complicated. To a person living in utter poverty in Appalachia, 
anyone who earns $50,000 a year would be a very rich person. 
</P>
<P>
But to Johnny Carson, anyone who earns $50,000 a year would be his pool boy. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, a new standard for defining wealth must be found. And I think I have 
it. 
</P>
<P>
From now on, anyone in America who eats in a restaurant more than once a week 
is rich and deserves to be taxed until he no longer has any money. 
</P>
<P>
What's that? You eat in a restaurant more than once a week and you're not rich? 
</P>
<P>
Of course you're not. That's because all your money goes for restaurant meals. 
</P>
<P>
I read an Associated Press story just the other day about a restaurant in New 
York that was responding to the new reality of American hard times. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the joint is Huberts, and I'm betting it's one of those places 
where a guy in the washroom expects a buck when he hands you a towel. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the story said: "Huberts used to sell caviar and truffles. Its 
tables were set with fish forks and fish spoons. Waiters wore designer 
uniforms. And ties and jackets were required of the customers. A dinner for two 
cost $165." 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, times have changed. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, there is no caviar, and the fish forks are stored away." 
</P>
<P>
(The story makes no mention of what happened to those fish spoons, however. 
This troubles me for two reasons: One, I worry that they may have been dumped 
into landfills where they won't biodegrade for 2,000 years, and, two, I have no 
idea what a fish spoon is.) 
</P>
<P>
Back to Huberts and hard times: "Waiters wear their own slacks and shirts. 
There are more tables pushed closer together." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the punch line. The prices at Huberts have plummeted to reflect the new 
lack of buying power of the American consumer: "The price for two is about 
$100. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Sort of makes you want to run right over there and grab a bite, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
But, wait, the chef-owner of Huberts has an explanation for his drastic price 
drop. "I felt we were in a vastly changing world and that I needed to keep up," 
said Len Allison. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the world is vastly changing. And it may change some more. Because under 
my new deficit reduction plan, anyone who pays $100 for two in a restaurant 
would be declared rich. All his money would be confiscated and all his credit 
cards would be seized. And anybody passing outside the restaurant would be 
allowed to run inside and slap him upside his head for five or six minutes 
until he regained his senses. 
</P>
<P>
I think Americans would respond to my plan. In fact, they are already 
responding. Americans are eating out less and less. Surveys have been done and 
they suggest -- amazingly -- that some people are getting tired of paying $30 
for a piece of chicken. 
</P>
<P>
I distinctly remember my first $30 piece of chicken. I saw it on the menu and 
asked the waiter if, for that price, it came with a set of tires. 
</P>
<P>
"How tres amusant," he said. "How tres, tres droll." 
</P>
<P>
"OK, so how is this $30 chicken prepared?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very lightly cooked in safflower oil and arrayed on a bed of radicchio," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Fried chicken," I said. "You're saying this is a piece of fried chicken?" 
</P>
<P>
"I should point out," he pointed out, "that this is free-range chicken." 
</P>
<P>
"What does that mean? It was allowed to drive the family car on weekends?" 
</P>
<P>
"It means it was not cruelly cooped up in a chicken house but allowed to roam 
freely and humanely," the waiter said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right up until they cut its head off," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we are a Gloomy Gus, aren't we?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
So I had the 30-buck fried chicken. And I'm glad I did. Because today it would 
cost 50 bucks. And anyone who can afford to spend that on chicken deserves to 
be taxed until it hurts. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sorry, but that's the way I feel. The average price for dinner for one in 
New York for a three-course meal, one drink and tip in a popular restaurant is 
$61. In Los Angeles, the second most expensive restaurant city in America, it 
is $43. 
</P>
<P>
But as more and more of our money has to go into our gas tanks rather than into 
our gullets, how many of us can still afford those kinds of prices? 
</P>
<P>
George Rice, a spokesman for Consumer Reports on Eating Share Trends, which 
tracks restaurant industry data, put the downward spiral of American eating 
trends this way: "It's Chez Paul's to Bennigan's and Bennigan's to Denny's and 
then Denny's to McDonald's. That's been going on for a few years and it will 
accelerate." 
</P>
<P>
And soon, government tax collectors will be stationed at restaurants all over 
America, keeping track of who is eating what for what prices. 
</P>
<P>
So next time you go out to eat, be careful: Make it a small order of fries.

PRESTIGIOUS PHILLIPS ACADEMY PREPS STUDENT BODY FOR SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ANDOVER, Mass. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phillips Academy, in this northeastern Massachusetts town, was the first 
boarding school to be incorporated in the United States. The year was 1778 and 
the Revolutionary War was still being fought. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 212 years, the prestigious prep school has graduated some of the 
most prominent Americans in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Wendell Holmes went to high school here, as did Samuel F.B. Morse, 
inventor of the telegraph and Morse Code, and George Herbert Walker Bush, 
President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Artist and famous equestrian Paul Revere created the school's seal. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the hallmarks of Phillips Academy is excellence," said Bush during a 
visit last November to the 500-acre campus. The President planted a Zelkova elm 
from the White House on the school's Great Lawn to commemorate the 200th 
anniversary of an official visit to Phillips Academy by another President on 
Nov. 5, 1789 -- President George Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Washington had been President of the new republic less than a year when he 
visited the 23 students of the academy. Washington had no children but his 
nephew and six grand-nephews went to school here. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush graduated from the school in 1942. Historian Garry Wills, in a 
1988 Time magazine essay, wrote: "His parents, Phillips Andover Academy and the 
war made George Bush what he is." 
</P>
<P>
Bush was senior class president, president of the Greeks, captain of the soccer 
team, captain and manager of the baseball team. "I loved those years," Bush 
said during his visit. He was a member of the school's board of trustees from 
1967 to 1979. Three of his sons are also Phillips alumni. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips Academy has 1,200 students -- 633 boys, 567 girls -- from 47 states, 
the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and 36 foreign 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Its students have come from China, Taiwan, the Soviet Union, nearly all the 
European countries, Japan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Kuwait, the United Arab 
Emirates, Botswana, Zambia and many other nations. 
</P>
<P>
"At most high schools, kids are from one town or the immediate area. Here they 
come from all over America, from all over the world. A typical high school will 
have some bright kids. Here they are all bright, the cream of the crop. That's 
very exciting," said John Richards II, who has taught at the academy for 32 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Young people here understand that it is OK to be smart . . . black or white, 
rich or poor . . . (and have) academic talents," said Donald W. McNemar, 46, 
the school's 13th headmaster. 
</P>
<P>
He described Phillips Andover, as the academy is known, as a high school that 
"brings together talented young people from across the country and around the 
world and challenges them to use that talent and to share it with others. We 
have students representing 60 nationalities, many races, many religions forming 
this unique community. We are fortunate to have a scholarship program that 
allows us to invite talented kids regardless of family finances." 
</P>
<P>
The school has 107 black students, 53 Latinos and 120 Asians. 
</P>
<P>
Tuition is steep, $14,600 a year. But the school uses $4.7 million in annual 
scholarship funds to search out students from diverse ethnic, socioeconomic and 
geographic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Jeannie Dissette, dean of admissions, described the recruitment as an effort 
"to find bright kids who don't know about Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a notion that this is a school only for the most affluent," Dissette 
said. "True, it is an elitist's school, but elitist from an academic 
standpoint. Here, 37% of the students receive scholarships that pay for part or 
all of their tuition, room, board and even air fare to and from home and the 
campus. Financial aid is based, of course, on need." 
</P>
<P>
Students, who must take three years of both math and languages, carry a heavy 
workload; at least two hours every night are devoted to study. They can select 
from 285 courses, including Russian, Chinese, Latin and Greek, as well as 
ethics, philosophy, logic and comparative religions. The history and social 
science department offers Urban Studies, American Race Relations, Men, Women 
and American Culture, and Nuclear Weapons: Proliferation and Responses. 
</P>
<P>
There are 160 buildings on campus, a blend of Colonial, Federal, neo-Georgian 
and modern architecture. Students study the War of 1812 in a building 
constructed before it took place. Samuel Smith wrote "My Country, 'tis of Thee" 
in 1832 in a dormitory still in use. Many former faculty members are buried in 
the campus cemetery, as is Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" 
and wife of an academy teacher. 
</P>
<P>
The Oliver Wendell Holmes Library, named in honor of the 1825 graduate, has 
more than 102,000 volumes, making it the largest secondary school library in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
After classes, there are sports, weekly student concerts and plays. Actor Jack 
Lemmon, Class of 1943, heads a major fund-raising campaign for the school. As a 
student, Lemmon wrote, starred in and directed his senior class play. Kevin 
Heelan, head of the theater department, is a playwright and actor. He wrote 
"Heartland," the Broadway production starring Sean Penn. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Phillips Andover became the first high school to have an exchange 
program with a Soviet high school, in addition to its programs in China, Spain, 
France, Mexico and Senegal. 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the 226-member faculty, which includes a priest, rabbi and 
minister, hold advanced degrees and 31 are published authors. 
</P>
<P>
Students say they come to the school expecting to excel. Most have their goals 
in place. William Tong, 17, senior class president from Glastonbury, Conn., 
plans to be a U.S. senator. Kristan Kane, 15, a sophomore from San Diego wants 
to be a brain surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to Phillips Andover because this is the best school I could find," said 
Jamie Sun, 17, a senior from Irvine. Julia Bloch, 16, a senior from Davis, 
enrolled because "Phillips offers a lot of theater. I have written eight 
one-act plays. Four have been produced on campus. What other high school could 
I go to and have this kind of opportunity?" 
</P>
<P>
In a Chinese-language class taught by Xiaomin Ni, an exchange teacher from 
China, Katy Breen, 17, a senior from San Francisco, explained why she is in the 
class: "I hear Chinese people speaking on the cable cars and streets of San 
Francisco all the time. Now I will know what they're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Many students such as Rebecca Howland, 16, a junior from Williamstown, Mass., 
are from families who have attended the school for generations. "My father, 
grandfather and great-grandfather, all the way back to the school's beginning, 
have gone to Phillips Andover," she said. "But I am the first girl." 
</P>
<P>
The school became co-ed in 1973 when it merged with Abbot Academy, an adjacent 
girl's boarding school established in 1829. 
</P>
<P>
"Many think it's a little rich school, but it's not," said Otis Chandler, Class 
of 1946. "It has a cross-section of America and a wonderful composition of 
students from all over the world," said the former Los Angeles Times publisher, 
now chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of Times 
Mirror Co. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler said it was at Phillips that he first became personally acquainted 
with minorities, "where I developed my liberal outlook in race relations. I 
roomed with a black student whose father was a janitor in a Chicago nightclub. 
He was there on scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"Phillips Andover is a great school. For a Californian, it's hard to believe a 
high school can be over 200 years old." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, Jack Lemmon, and Otis Chandler are typical of Phillips 
graduates who maintain a lifelong commitment to the school that played a key 
role in shaping their intellectual pursuits and moral values, faculty and 
alumni say.

JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York's Times Square is coming alive with new hotels, but few as inexpensive 
as Ian Schrager's refurbished Paramount on West 46th Street. This is the 
theater district, and who can argue with the prices: 40% of the Paramount's 610 
rooms cost $100 or less. (Doubles up to $170.) 
</P>
<P>
Schrager spent a bundle spiffing up this old (circa 1927) hotel. Writer William 
Norwich called the Paramount a "high-tech inn for the hip un-rich." No 
argument. It's chic. Guest rooms are described as whimsical, but you'd best 
like white and checker-board-patterned carpets. Even the beds are white. French 
designer Philippe Starck used blowups of Vermeer's 17th-Century "Lacemaker" for 
headboards. Starck did French President Mitterrand's bedroom at the Elysee 
Palace, so who's to argue? 
</P>
<P>
Baths feature conical-shaped wash basins with live red roses. Other flowers are 
strewn throughout the hotel. Schrager weeps. Says his floral bill figures to 
run $250,000 a year. Still, business is rosy. Open only a few weeks, the 
Paramount is boasting 90% occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
Staffers in the lobby dress tuxedo-casual with T-shirts, substituting for 
formal shirts. Schrager describes the lobby as resembling "a big living room -- 
a stage" where guests seated on the mezzanine study other guests in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
In breaking with tradition, Schrager installed a playroom for youngsters. This 
along with a $1 movie theater with popcorn and penny candy. Coming up next: a 
supper club in Billy Rose's old Diamond Horseshoe nightclub. Says Schrager: "We 
give our guests dreams. We give them magic." His hero? Walt Disney.

NEWS AND BRIEFS: PLAYING NAME GAMES ON THE STREETS OF BERLIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Compiled from Times staff and wire service reports. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reunification of Berlin, which makes it the largest city between Paris and 
Moscow (pop. just over 5 million), also has resulted in a debate over which of 
East Berlin's streets should be renamed to remove any memory of their Communist 
associations. 
</P>
<P>
Among the streets likely to be rechristened are, for example, Karl-Marx-Allee, 
Lenin-Allee and Ho-Chi-Minh-Strasse. 
</P>
<P>
But Germans are being cautious about the changes, pointing out that there is a 
difference between naming streets and squares after corrupt officials and 
honoring writers or philosophers, no matter what their politics. All agree that 
the former should be changed, but some argue that the latter should stay. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 160 name changes have been proposed, meaning that map makers will be 
kept busy with updates for some time to come, as will visitors trying to find 
their way. 
</P>
<P>
Quick Fact: A record 3.2 million Americans visited Europe during the 1989-90 
fall-winter season, according to figures from the U.S. Department of 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Rating the Hotels: A Consumer Reports survey of more than 100,000 readers rated 
42 hotel chains based on the level of satisfaction they experienced during 
their visits. 
</P>
<P>
Hampton Inn scored highest among economy hotels, Best Western among the 
moderate hotels, Residence Inn in the high-priced category and Four Seasons 
among luxury hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Biggest complaint overall was about the quality of hotel food (47% of those 
surveyed said they were less than "very satisfied"), followed by climate 
control (35%). 
</P>
<P>
The category of economy hotels included those whose rates were up to $40 a 
night; moderate, $40-$56; high-priced, $63-$94, and luxury $91-$139. 
</P>
<P>
Travel Quiz: Which is larger, Lake Baikal in the Soviet Union or the Bahamas? 
</P>
<P>
Sand Trap: Morris Dweck is not feeling too kindly toward the Iraqis these days, 
not since their Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Dweck had a better idea. At least he thought he did. This summer, he decided 
that his North Myrtle Beach, S.C., miniature golf course needed a new image, 
something that would help attract tourists and the folks from the nearby Air 
Force Base in Myrtle Beach. 
</P>
<P>
So Dweck went out and bought himself a roadside genie, then came up with a new 
name for his course -- Treasures of Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, well, back to the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Newcomer: The 440-room Hotel Nikko Atlanta opened this month at the 
intersection of Peachtree and Piedmont streets in Atlanta's Buckhead section. 
In keeping with its name, the 25-story hotel features a Japanese garden and a 
collection of Japanese art. 
</P>
<P>
Quick Fact: There are 1 billion more Chinese in the world than there are 
Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
Sweet Dreams: A new museum that should appeal to chocaholics has opened in 
Birmingham, England. The Cadbury World Chocolate Experience features a 
permanent exhibit at the chocolate factory, with wax models and videos on the 
history of chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors can sample a chocolate drink made according to an ancient Aztec recipe 
and see chocolate being made. They can sample more chocolate at an on-site 
restaurant, ice cream parlor and souvenir shop. 
</P>
<P>
Mediterranean Crossing: A new ferry service for passengers and freight has been 
established linking Turkey, Greece and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Minoan Lines of Crete operates the ferry, the Ariadne, which calls at Kusadasi 
in Turkey, Samos, Paros, Piraeus and Cephalonia in Greece, and Ancona in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Don't Lighten Up: After a six-month trial run that showed a 90% favorable 
reaction, Lufthansa will ban smoking on all of its domestic flights starting 
next Sunday. Smoking already is banned on all buses and trains in Germany. 
</P>

Quiz Answer: The Bahamas could fit twice into the 12,200-square-mile lake and 
still leave plenty of room for swimmers.

ADVENTURE TRAVEL: THE EYES WILL HAVE IT IN BRAZIL'S LUSH PANTANAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SCOTT DOGGETT, Doggett is an editor for the Los Angeles Times-Washington 
Post News Service and an adventure traveler. 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PORTO JOFRE, Brazil 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the blackness that made the brilliant eyes so captivating. At the end of 
my flashlight beam, like glowing embers on a sea of black velvet, the 
fire-orange eyes of a thousand caimans reflected back at me. 
</P>
<P>
Under a starry sky, the field stretching out before me seemed to practically 
grow caimans -- enormous toothy reptiles that are often mistaken for 
alligators. Every sweep of the flashlight lit up scores of eyes, some not 20 
yards from the raised dirt road where I stood. 
</P>
<P>
The eerie sight of the caimans was just one of many unforgettable sights that 
greeted me at seemingly every turn in the 150,000-square-mile wetlands at the 
center of South America, an area called the Pantanal. 
</P>
<P>
Although lacking the fame of the Amazon, the Pantanal is home to at least 1,100 
species of butterflies, 400 species of fish, 650 species of birds and 80 
species of mammals. According to the World Wildlife Fund, only East Africa's 
savannas offer more in natural richness, both of flora and fauna. 
</P>
<P>
Pantano means "swamp" in Portuguese, but in fact the Pantanal is not a swamp at 
all. Rather, it is the world's largest wetland -- a single, low-lying ecosystem 
formed by the dozens of rivers that flow into the mighty Paraguay River. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the season, the Pantanal is either flooded or drying out. During 
the dry season, from May to November, vast expanses of savannas are exposed. 
During the rainy season, from December to April, the rivers swell and deep mud 
and washed-out bridges often halt traffic on the Transpantaneira. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling across the Pantanal is like having pages of the National Geographic 
come to life around you. 
</P>
<P>
Exotic birds dart from spindly trees. Caimans plunge into waters that are milk 
chocolate in color. Giant anteaters lasso termites with their footlong tongues. 
Fishermen under broad straw hats sweep rivers in dugout canoes, catching 
20-pound catfish and filling baskets with piranha. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of its fantastic beauty, the Pantanal has been a great unknown until 
recent years. Lack of roads kept the Pantanal's wildlife-rich inner delta, an 
area about the size of Britain in central-west Brazil, out of reach to all but 
the most zealous explorers. 
</P>
<P>
It was in 1974 that an elevated dirt road -- the Transpantaneira -- was 
completed, linking the Pantanal's interior with its northern boundary at the 
town of Pocone. Still, it wasn't until just three years ago that tourists 
outnumbered scientists visiting the area. 
</P>
<P>
I flew to the nearest city -- Cuiaba -- in late June during the dry season, 
when wildlife in the Pantanal can best be seen. With a bottle of local rum, 
three cameras and a guide, Luiz Roberto, who could identify what seemed like a 
million animals, I set out for a weeklong adventure into the New World's 
largest breeding grounds. 
</P>
<P>
After an hour's drive past 10-home villages and miles of parched, rugged 
country, we arrived in dusty Pocone and loaded up on soft drinks -- ammo 
against 95-degree days. 
</P>
<P>
Just outside Pocone, a carved sign hung over the road announcing the beginning 
of the Transpantaneira, and it might well have included the message: "Where 
city dwellers become nature lovers." 
</P>
<P>
No sooner had we begun our journey into the heart of lightness than we slowed 
to cross one of the 123 wooden bridges on the Transpantaneira, which stretches 
90 miles from Pocone to Porto Jofre. 
</P>
<P>
From our Land Cruiser we peered into ponds on both sides of the bridge, and to 
my pleasant astonishment, we spied the first of hundreds of caimans we would 
see in coming days. 
</P>
<P>
By day, literally millions of Pantanal caimans take sun beside waterways and 
marshy pools. At dusk, they submerge to feast on piranha and an occasional land 
animal ambushed while drinking at water's edge. Whether seen by day or by 
night, the toothy reptiles, some up to 10 feet long, are an impressive sight. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes past the bridge we came upon a towering tree that wore its leaves 
like crowns on its highest branches. About two-thirds of the way up the tree, 
where the trunk finally flared off into branches, two jabiru storks -- white 
birds measuring a full four feet tall with scarlet collars, black hoods and 
six-foot wingspans -- had built a nest the width of a desk. 
</P>
<P>
On a nearby branch, a crested quero-quero -- a hawklike bird named after its 
sound -- "I want, I want" -- eyed the nest's eggs. Should the storks, who mate 
for life, abandon their nest even for a minute, it would spell certain death 
for their offspring, Luiz said. 
</P>
<P>
In the miles that followed, we came upon kingfishers, yellow-beaked toucans, 
roseate spoonbills, American wood storks, tiger herons, spectacled owls and 
more than a few macaws. 
</P>
<P>
Without even leaving the truck, we also spotted marsh deer, two giant anteaters 
and dozens of capybaras -- web-footed rodents the size of wart hogs with 
guinea-pig faces and bearlike coats. There were other animals, but simply to 
list them does not do justice to the pleasing emotions they evoke when seen in 
sweeping savannah unspoiled by man's often-destructive touch. 
</P>
<P>
We spent our first night at the Hotel Pixaim, a 10-room lodge with bath, good 
food and a friendly staff. Typical of the Pantanal's hotels, this one was clean 
and comfortable though lacking in luxury. 
</P>
<P>
Built on stilts at a bend in the River Pixaim, the hotel rises above a marshy 
area popular with caimans. At night, amid the sounds of crickets, bullfrogs, 
owls and monkeys, I could sometimes hear the rustle of caimans beneath me. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, like most of my mornings in the Pantanal, began with Luiz and 
me racing out to a vantage point he knew to watch a breathtaking sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
Before the sun broke, the siren of a million crickets would be joined by a 
cacophony of birdcalls. Monkeys entered the ruckus with howls that reached a 
crescendo. It was like a movie soundtrack played at full volume, quieting as 
sunlight swept the plain. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the day would be spent cruising the Transpantaneira or paddling 
around in a canoe, which took us down narrow waterways far from the road and 
into lowland rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
Gliding quietly in a canoe allowed us to slip unnoticed beneath leaning trees 
bustling with howler monkeys and common iguanas. In front of the canoe, dorados 
and pacus -- fish often weighing 20 pounds or more -- heaved themselves out of 
the muddy water to announce their presence, while scores of birds, many with 
long, elegant wings, flew an arm's length above the river. 
</P>
<P>
One day, Luiz and I took a canoe out with an old Pantaneiro who could spot 
monkeys in trees before I could see them with my 200-millimeter lens. He 
pointed out a clearing where a jaguar had been, and once we paddled to within 
20 feet of a family of capybaras before the giant rodents ran off. 
</P>
<P>
Often I'd see what appeared to be the head of a snake poking out of the water, 
only to be told it was a snake bird -- a semi-aquatic bird whose head resembles 
a bushmaster when the bird comes up for air. 
</P>
<P>
On occasion, with Luiz translating, we'd stop and chat with locals. One, a 
young biologist, was most anxious to criticize sport fishermen for depleting 
the rivers' stocks; most ignore fishing limits, he said, leaving the area with 
hundreds of animals caught in a single weekend. 
</P>
<P>
On our last night in the Pantanal, Luiz and I drove back to Pocone, then headed 
east about 30 miles to the tiny village of Porto Cercado, where we climbed into 
a motorized canoe that would take us upriver to Cabanas do Pantanal, an 18-room 
lodge accessible only by boat. 
</P>
<P>
In the blackness of the moonless night, our canoe shot across piranha-filled 
water ringed by caiman. Our boatman flicked on a flashlight every so often 
during the 20-minute ride to warn other boatmen of our presence. 
</P>
<P>
On the shores, dusk had turned the ivy-covered trees into menacing silhouettes, 
and fireflies flitted off and on like grandma's white Christmas lights. It was 
Disneyland's "Pirates of the Caribbean" minus the pirates, at a wind-whipped 30 
knots. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel would have met Hemingway's approval. Its ceiling sagged, and the 
walls were boards of bright wood decorated with colorful maps of the Pantanal 
and photos of the area's wildlife, including jaguars, ocelots, anacondas and, 
of course, caimans. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the bar were jars containing cachaca -- clear and punchy Brazilian rum. 
Each jar also contained an oddity such as a root or piece of bark, stuff that 
when aged in cachaca is said to produce a concoction that will increase 
potency, produce arms of steel and so on. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel's bedrooms were nothing special, but there was a gorgeous lime-green 
tree frog clinging to my shower wall and, perched on a ledge near the ceiling, 
a small snake giving the frog a good look. 
</P>
<P>
That night, like most we spent in the Pantanal, we drank cachaca in a fire's 
glow and recounted the day's exotic sightings 
</P>
<P>
Monkeys playing . . . fish leaping . . . exotic birds in flight . . . scenes as 
memorable as the field of caimans that peered into my flashlight a few light 
years from civilization.

AT HALLOWEEN, NEW ORLEANS CITIZENS INVOKE OLD-FASHIONED CIVIC SPIRITS

NEW ORLEANS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I suspected something was up the minute we stepped off the plane at New Orleans 
International. There, above a ticket counter, a hanging banner read: "The Witch 
Queens of New Orleens and Their Love Slaves." 
</P>
<P>
The young airline employees behind the desk, decked out in appropriate witch 
and slave attire, were cheerfully passing out handfuls of candy corn with every 
ticket to smiling customers. And there were still five days to go before 
Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
Mardi Gras in New Orleans is a wonderful sight, but the tourist crowds are 
enormous, you can't drive down the streets for the people, and you can never 
get the hotel reservation you want. 
</P>
<P>
Even better than Mardi Gras, I found, is Halloween in the Big Easy, where 
perhaps more than anywhere else in America, it is a truly spirited prelude to 
All Saints' Day. 
</P>
<P>
The "real" New Orleans, the one that surfaces at Halloween, is a city of masks 
and drama, of high life and low living, a city that attacks the senses and 
quickens the pulse. 
</P>
<P>
A languid, sweet smell of decaying elegance almost oozes from every 
cobblestoned street in the French Quarter, ensuring that writers such as 
Tennessee Williams, Lillian Hellman and Anne Rice -- their prose so evocative 
of the city -- will stay in print forever. 
</P>
<P>
That section of the city comes alive with a street party that begins the 
weekend before Halloween and lasts until the first rays of sunlight on Nov. 1, 
when all good vampires are sent scuttling back to their coffins to rest before 
rising again next year. 
</P>
<P>
We arrived on that weekend last year and immediately took to the streets for a 
taste of the theatrical outrageousness that has made New Orleans famous. 
</P>
<P>
One of my companions likened the scene on Bourbon Street to the infamous 
"Artist and Model" balls that were once held in the uninhibited Latin Quarter 
of Paris in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
All along Bourbon and Royal, the gorgeous held court with the ghastly. A Viking 
shared a drink with the Phantom of the Opera, while nearby, a ravishing 
skeleton poured Dixie beer for Satan, red horns and all. A pregnant male bride 
partied with an 11-foot, green-faced Frankenstein-on-stilts and a princess with 
a mustache joked with his two-faced pal. 
</P>
<P>
Near the doorway of Napoleon House at 500 Chartres St., a moody old mansion 
dating from 1791 that survives as one the city most popular bars, I saw a woman 
dressed as the Wicked Witch of the West sharing a meaty po' boy sandwich with 
her companion, the scarecrow from "The Wizard of Oz." 
</P>
<P>
The place seemed to attract all types. It was included in Esquire magazine's 
"top 100 bars in America and serves extraordinary Italian sandwiches called 
muffulettas and other light meals, enhanced by classical music. Prices are 
under $5 for lunch or dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Looking around, I could have sworn the whole city was dressed for All Hallow's 
Eve, from the graceful homes along oak-lined St. Charles Avenue to the 
gingerbread wrought-iron balconies of the French Quarter. Pumpkins, both real 
and cardboard, displayed their grins from across cool, fountained courtyards. 
In the Touche Bar near Jackson Square, skeletons and cobwebs danced from the 
dusty old chandelier. 
</P>
<P>
"New Orleans is the most haunted city in America," proclaimed Rice, who has 
written such celebrated New Orleans-inspired novels as "Interview With the 
Vampire," "The Vampire Lestat" and "The Queen of the Damned." 
</P>
<P>
She believes that her early years in the city formed the roots of superstition 
and legend that are at the core of her works. Rice's latest book, "The Witching 
Hour," due out in November, is set in her own New Orleans home, itself reputed 
to be haunted. 
</P>
<P>
"As a child, I was very aware of the layers of legend surrounding the city, 
which I know inspires my writing now so much," Rice said. "I spent every 
Halloween in New Orleans up until I was 16 years old. We used to go 
trick-or-treating in the Garden District, where there are so many big, spooky 
haunted houses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a spirit trap," Rice continued. "One of my theories is that they 
gravitate here because they respond to the ornamentation of our lovely 
architecture -- the houses, the churches, the cemeteries, the French Quarter 
buildings. Why are the spirits always said to haunt castles? Same reason -- 
they love the beauty. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a school of thought that says ghosts are like records with grooves, 
just waiting for the right 'needle' -- person, that is -- to set them off, so 
they can tell their stories again and again. I know New Orleans has quite a lot 
of those grooves, just waiting to be heard." 
</P>
<P>
Another great reason to visit the city at this time of year is the climate. 
Gone is the unrelenting humidity. New Orleans may also well be the only place 
left where grown-ups can still act like kids on Halloween and not feel 
embarrassed about it. 
</P>
<P>
Take the annual "Search for the Loup Garou," sponsored by the Louisiana Nature 
and Science Center. Named for the legendary creature-man who changes into a 
wolf at twilight on Halloween, this traditional event includes a specially 
produced laser show at the Planetarium, with ghouls and goblins dancing on the 
dome in time to frightful tunes. For more information, call (504) 246-5672. 
</P>
<P>
Or the popular "Ghostly Galavant Through the French Quarter." Led by a group 
called The Friends of the Cabildo, who help preserve the city's Spanish 
heritage, participants are taken on a tour to some of the Quarter's most 
haunted buildings and told tales of its famous phantoms. 
</P>
<P>
The city's astonishing number of cemeteries -- 31 at last count -- attests to 
the fact that the dead are literally all around you. There were times in New 
Orleans' history when the gravediggers could barely keep pace with the corpses. 
Plagues such as "Bronze John," better known as yellow fever, devastated the 
city in the mid-19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Most of New Orleans' cemeteries now lie in uneasy decay, but they are still 
fascinating places to visit. Jumbled, tumbling mazes of elegantly ornate marble 
angels and imposing mausoleums depict a form of folk art found nowhere else in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
So decrepit and rundown are many of the cemeteries that a local group, Save Our 
Cemeteries, has joined forces with the Catholic archdiocese to help invoke a 
1974 law that pressures living descendants to restore their ancestors' final 
resting places. 
</P>
<P>
Many Orleanians still remember All Saints' Day as a time to visit and actually 
talk to a deceased loved one. Celebrating Halloween, then, becomes the obvious 
prelude to just such an outing. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the best parties to scare yourself at are held at Tipitina's, 501 
Napoleon Ave. (504) 895-8477. The well-known nightspot features great live 
Zydeco, blues, Cajun and rock music. The costumes here are truly incredible. 
</P>
<P>
Another spooky spot is The Dungeon, a late-night hangout in the French Quarter 
where ugliness is the order of the evening. Why not ask the bartender for a 
"Dead on Arrival" daiquiri? 
</P>
<P>
While you're wandering, look for the Vampire Bar, said to exist somewhere in 
the Quarter. I've been looking for its exact location for years, supposedly a 
darkened doorway with a drawbridge beyond. 
</P>
<P>
One store in the Quarter is devoted entirely to the preservation of voodoo, 
spirit worship and the black arts. Traces of The Other Side leer down from the 
walls -- masks of traditional devils, horned Satans and sharp African faces in 
carved wood, with only slits for eyes. 
</P>
<P>
I noticed a jewel-encrusted human skull rested in a glass case next to the head 
of a jackal. I listened, amused, as the skinny shopkeeper explained some of the 
bizarre rituals to a shy-looking Midwestern couple. 
</P>
<P>
By 7 a.m. on All Saints' Day, the Cafe du Monde in the French Market (800 
Decatur St., 504-525-4544; open 24 hours) was filled with bleary-eyed 
party-goers eager for their first cafe au lait and warm, sugary beignets. 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans is host to all sorts of celebrations year-round, from the sacred to 
the profane. But the two never blend quite so innocently as at Halloween, when 
the city becomes a ritual dance of life.

HOW TO VISIT THE PANTANAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S.D. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Getting there: Varig Brazilian Airlines flies from Los Angeles to Rio de 
Janeiro four times weekly, and from Rio to Cuiaba twice daily, telephone (800) 
468-2744. Round trip to Cuiaba costs about $1,675. 
</P>
<P>
When to go: Best time to visit the Pantanal is during the dry season, May to 
mid-November, when few tourists can be found and millions of migrant birds 
return to nest. 
</P>
<P>
Tours: For my trip, I used F&amp;H Travel Consulting, 4545 Baseline Ave., Santa 
Ynez, Calif. 93460, (800) 544-5503. Run by two Brazilians, F&amp;H handled all 
of my travel arrangements, and I paid hundreds of dollars less than if I had 
attempted to do it myself. The cost is about $2,000 for five nights in the 
Pantanal, including round-trip air fare, lodging, guide, ground transportation 
and breakfasts. 
</P>
<P>
Where to stay: Cabanas do Pantanal, MTConfiance Turismo Ltda., Rua Candido 
Mariano 434, Cuiaba, Brazil, 011-55-65-321-4142 or 322-1353. Approximately $55 
per person per night. Price includes land rides, fishing and a boat ride to and 
from the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Pixaim, Porto Jofre, Brazil, 011-55-65-322-8961. Approximately $35 per 
night for two. Breakfast included. 
</P>
<P>

NEW YORK RESTAURANTS NEED NOT BE EXPENSIVE 
</P>

NEW YORK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Feeling the impact of a post-market-crash economy, New Yorkers are hunting for 
-- and finding -- great places to dine out for less than $15 per person, 
according to an industry survey. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no need to eat badly in any price level," said Punch In 
International, an electronic information service that surveys the travel, wine 
and restaurant industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that the quality of food has improved -- thanks to a 
health-conscious generation and the nouvelle movement." 
</P>
<P>
"An economy turned sour, a generation of out-of-work yuppies and the current 
influx of hot money from abroad have brought back the sorrily missed breed of 
wonderful ethnic spots, music and jazz haunts and bistros-cum-trattorias," 
Punch In International said. 
</P>
<P>
Italian cuisine is leading the ethnic pack, with the East Side's Belladona 
proposing pasta dishes for only $6, with a bring-your-own-bottle policy surely 
helping to slash the check. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a charming sidewalk cafe, BYOB policy and $6 pastas that can rival and 
even surpass the $20 variety offered by its competitors," the survey said. "A 
three-course meal can be devoured for under $15." 
</P>
<P>
Arlecchino Ristorante Italiano, in the Village, is another Italian restaurant 
combining genuine atmosphere (though the chef is from Ecuador) and fine 
traditional cuisine, realistically priced. 
</P>
<P>
New contenders on the New York ethnic scene are a string of Middle Eastern 
restaurants offering a variety of "sensuous, theatrical and appealing" cuisine, 
Punch In said. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the Village is Lofti's Couscous, named after the traditional North 
African dish made of grain served with lamb, chicken and vegetables in a spicy 
sauce, and described as simply "the best Moroccan restaurant to ever open in 
New York." 
</P>
<P>
Also getting high marks for good Middle Eastern cuisine combined with low 
prices is the East Side's Sido Abu Salim, which rates rave reviews for its 
eggplant puree and tabbouleh salad. 
</P>
<P>
When it seemed that nothing new could emerge on the crowded Chinese restaurant 
scene, Triple Eight, dubbed a "Chinatown extravaganza," promises to deliver a 
spectacular traditional tea-lunch, delivering cart after cart of dumplings and 
appetizers for less than $15 per person. 
</P>
<P>
Also from the Far East, and flourishing on the West Side, are numerous Korean 
barbecue houses, specializing in thinly sliced beef wrapped in spices and 
lettuce leaves. Ny Kom Tang Bul House is a name worth remembering, while its 
West 32nd Street rivals also deserve a visit, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
For true bargain-hunters and spice-lovers, the India Pavillion is the place to 
go on East 54th Street, with the check totaling not more than $10 per person. 
</P>
<P>
And for low-calorie, low-budget diners, the Little White House brings Turkish 
delights such as grilled fish and meat -- "New York's best buy in a steak 
dinner for under $15" -- although it is advisable for weight-watchers to forgo 
the extra-sweet deserts. 
</P>
<P>
Good deals at French restaurants are hard to find anywhere in the world -- 
including Paris. Punch In praised Les Sans-Culottes, on the East Side, with its 
distinct wallpaper depicting leading characters of the French Revolution, and 
hard-to-pronounce Pierre's Les Douceurs de Paris, in the Village. 
</P>
<P>
Often crowded is midtown's Kennedy's where a traditional Irish meat pie and a 
beer cost about $10. A few blocks away is Kavkazian, a Georgian restaurant 
which "may have some of the worst service in town," but "the best fried chicken 
in town" and great Russian music. 
</P>
<P>

THE TIMES SHOPPER: ANCIENT CRAFT PROVIDES BURST OF FRESH AIR WITH VARIETY OF 
FANS IN TRADITIONAL KYOTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

KYOTO, Japan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The residents of Kyoto, one of Japan's loveliest and most tradition-conscious 
cities, know the importance of maintaining their old shops and preserving the 
crafts associated with them. One of the city's most treasured gems is Miyawaki 
Baisen'an, famous for its fans. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, fans have been an important part of culture from ancient times to the 
present. For shoppers, fans are affordable, useful, appealing souvenirs, and 
there is no place better to learn about them than at Miyawaki Baisen'an. 
</P>
<P>
The shop displays dozens of varieties of fans, each intended for a different 
function. Traditionally, fans in Japan have been used to express or hide 
emotions -- as symbols of authority (samurai carried fans made of peacock 
feathers); as weapons in combat (battle fans, known as gunsen or tensen, were 
made of iron); as love tokens to be exchanged by betrothed couples; in 
religious rites, tea ceremonies and funerals, and as elegant accessories for 
kimono-clad men or women. Sumo wrestlers and geishas each have their own style 
of fans. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, fans are also used for what most Westerners associate them 
with: to simply create a breath of fresh air on a hot day. Special fans have 
been designed so that they can be dipped in water for a cooling effect. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently designed with themes reflecting nature or the seasons, there are two 
basic types of Japanese fan. Stiff, flat, round fans known as uchiwa were 
introduced to Japan from China by way of Korea in the 6th Century BC. These 
fans are made by attaching cardboard to ribs cut from a single piece of bamboo, 
supposedly the most effective design for moving the air. Uchiwa have often been 
used as mini-advertising billboards: Decorated with a shop or product's logo, 
they are given to loyal patrons as premiums. 
</P>
<P>
Folding fans, known as ogi or sensu, were invented by the Japanese. As the 
legend goes, a beautiful young widow entering a nunnery folded paper to make a 
fan to ease the fever of the abbot of the temple. The invention might date back 
to the reign of Emperor Tenji (AD 661 to 672), but the oldest folding fan in 
existence is a cypress fan dated 877. 
</P>
<P>
Ogi fans are made with three to 25 ribs cut from bamboo, ivory or precious 
wood, which may be elaborately carved. Those of sandalwood or other perfumed 
wood are often perforated to enhance their scent as the fan is moved through 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
Miyawaki Baisen'an (the name roughly translates to "fan-seller's hermitage") 
was established in 1823 by the Miyawaki family, who came to Kyoto from central 
Japan. The store, located at Tomino-koji Nishi-iru, Rokkaku-dori, Nakagyo-ku 
(telephone 075-221-0181), is now the only fan shop to be found in this Kyoto 
neighborhood, once a fan-making center. 
</P>
<P>
Miyawaki Baisen'an's original building was burned in a fire that destroyed much 
of Kyoto in 1864. The present shop, with its deep eaves and slatted 
second-story windows, is a masterpiece of the old style. 
</P>
<P>
The Miyawakis have maintained their century-old building with great care. 
Outside, the batari shogi bench folds down each day when the shop opens for 
business to give customers a place to rest. It folds back up at day's end to 
become part of the storm shutters that protect the interior from the elements. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the shop's decor dates from a 1902 "modernization." The later addition 
of electric lights and air conditioning did not alter the interior's integrity 
and elegance. 
</P>
<P>
When you approach Miyawaki Baisen'an, the shop has an almost mysterious air. 
Gleaming silver, gold and brightly multicolored fan sheaves are obscured and 
protected from the sun's damaging rays by the flowing curtains that bear the 
shop's name. 
</P>
<P>
Within the main showroom, hundreds of exquisite fans of all varieties decorate 
the walls and are beautifully displayed in glass cases. The ceiling of a 
smaller room to the left is covered with fan-shaped original paintings, each 
created by a famous Tokyo artist of the period, including the extraordinary 
"tiger fan" by Takeuchi and the "orchid and rock fan" by Tessai. 
</P>
<P>
Behind that room is a Western-style lounge, furnished with carpets and 
armchairs and decorated with wooden fan panels on the walls. The ceiling is 
covered with another set of fan paintings, these by famous Kyoto artists of the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
These are not for sale, but included among the items that may be purchased 
(priced from about $4 to $2,500) are palm-sized miniature uchiwa (about $25) 
hand-painted with elegant single motifs, such as a maple leaf or crane. 
Delicate ladies' fans in a wide variety of colors and motifs, intended for 
everyday use, are priced from about $8. 
</P>
<P>
Men's everyday fans, usually heavier and in more austere colors, are from $12. 
Large, deep-brown waterproof fans made of paper soaked in persimmon juice cost 
about $30. Baisen'an's traditional dance fans (from $150) are large, 
elaborately decorated works of art with fine paintings of bamboo, leaves and 
other natural motifs displayed against a field of gleaming gold. Sweet-scented 
sandalwood fans with beautifully carved ribs are available in men's and women's 
sizes for $250 to $450. 
</P>
<P>
If you aren't traveling to Kyoto, don't think beautiful fans are beyond your 
reach. Although none has quite the same aura of tradition as Miyawaki 
Baisen'an, several worthy traditional fan shops in Tokyo offer a wide variety 
of beautiful fans: Bunsendo (1-20-2 Asakusa, Taito-ku, telephone 841-0088) has 
fans priced from about $10 to $300. Hosendo Kyuami (1-19-6 Asakusa, Taito-ku, 
845-5021) specializes in traditional dance fans, priced from $5 to $350. 
Kyosendo (2-4-3 Ningyocho, Nihombashi, Chuo-ku, 666-7255) has a wide variety 
priced from $4 to $1,025. 
</P>
<P>
Wan'ya Shoten (3-9 Jimbocho, Kanda, Chiyoda-ku, 263-6771) sells fans for Noh 
drama, priced from $16 to $430. In addition, you'll find fans priced from about 
$5 to $70 at kiosks near temples and other frequently visited spots around 
town, but these rarely have the quality of the fans sold in the traditional 
shops.

POLITICAL FORECAST; 
</P>
<P>
TERM LIMITS: WHAT WOULD BE CHANGED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Xandra Kayden, Forecast interviews were conducted by Xandra Kayden, visiting 
scholar, Center for Politics and Policy, Claremont Graduate School, and the 
author of Surviving Power (Free Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two propositions on California's Nov. 6 ballot would, among other things, limit 
the terms of statewide officeholders and state legislators. Proposition 131 
would limit statewide elected officials to two consecutive four-year terms, 
state legislators to 12 consecutive years in office; Proposition 140 would hold 
Assembly members to six years in office, state senators and statewide elected 
officials to eight. 
</P>
<P>
 If either passes, or both do, what would state government be like by 1996 and 
thereafter? Would passage of such measures be likely to spur similar 
legislation in other states, or at the federal level? The Times asked six 
legislators and legislative specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Richard L. Mountjoy, member of the state Assembly (R-Monrovia), first elected 
in 1978, a former general contractor who has served as mayor and city 
councilman of Monrovia (1968-76): 
</P>
<P>
By 1996, there would be all new faces. The argument that the lobbyists would 
take advantage of them, I believe, is not valid. 
</P>
<P>
Term limits would give the people of California more control over the 
Legislature, and the Legislature would be less prone to special interests, 
because legislators would know they are going to be there for six years and 
they're out. 
</P>
<P>
(Term limits) would stop (politics) from being a professional occupation. For 
many members, that's all they've ever done -- be in the Legislature, 
legislative staff. I think it will return the Legislature to more of a 
citizen-type legislator. The Legislature, right now, is controlled by those 
people who have a vested interest in legislation. 
</P>
<P>
I came to the Legislature after eight years on the (Monrovia) City Council. I 
knew the system there pretty well. I knew how to get things done. I think that 
the legislative committee hearings are nothing more than City Council meetings 
on different subject matters. I think that what would happen in the Legislature 
is more expertise coming out of the citizenry. 
</P>
<P>
I think there would be people from all walks of life. I think the age bracket 
would creep up a little more. Get people who have been in business. Folks who 
want to do it as a public service. At least it would not be dominated by 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Presley, state senator (D-Riverside) since 1974, formerly a member of 
the Riverside County Sheriff's Department for 24 years, 12 of them as 
undersheriff: 
</P>
<P>
My guess is that in about 20 years, there would be another initiative to change 
(term limits) because we will have found that (they) didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
The lobbyists are there for a very long time, and they become very expert in 
their fields . . . and will be even more influential, more powerful. They are 
not really accountable to anyone except their employers. 
</P>
<P>
It would become clear rather quickly that you have a bunch of elected amateurs 
trying to run a very complex, complicated system of state government. We are 
not a little backwater state, anymore. We have a population of about 30 million 
people. We are growing at the rate of three-quarters of a million people a 
year, and that, alone, is hard for people to comprehend. 
</P>
<P>
It is not just the numbers. It is the ethnic mix, the cultural diversity -- all 
of those things have to be cranked in. So, governing the state of California . 
. . is not as easy and simple as a lot of people would think. And the other 
thing a lot of people seem to think is that you the governor -- or you the 
legislator -- can get up there and solve these problems tomorrow. Well, there 
are some of them that are almost not solvable. You have to keep trying. 
</P>
<P>
Karl T. Kurtz, director of state services, National Conference of State 
Legislatures: 
</P>
<P>
The most negative and pernicious impact of term limitations will be on the 
leadership of the Legislature . . . They need leaders who have a great deal of 
experience, skill and ability to lead and to get things done, so that they 
avoid the kind of stalemate we have had in Congress in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
But legislatures also need strong committee chairmen, and term limits mean that 
relatively inexperienced people are going to be in leadership and that they are 
-- by definition -- lame ducks from the very beginning. That is probably the 
most negative impact. 
</P>
<P>
There has been a national movement that started in California, 25 years ago, to 
really strengthen the role of legislatures and to make them co-equal branches 
of government; things like term limitations, which would restrict the power and 
authority of legislatures, are a step backward in that movement. It would mean 
that, in relative terms, the legislatures would cede more power and authority 
to the executive branch, to lobbyists and to legislative staff. 
</P>
<P>
Mark P. Petracca, assistant professor of politics and society, UC Irvine: 
</P>
<P>
The national effect would be very impressive because, unlike Oklahoma (where 
voters recently approved a 12-year-limit on legislators), which does not have a 
reputation for being in the vanguard of political change in America, California 
does. Because it is the largest political state in the country, a success for 
either proposition here is likely to have spinoff moves around the country. . . 
. Since states do have the power to amend the Constitution on their own, 
although it is much harder to do it that way, it could very well be that the 
groundswell of support for (this) movement in some key industrial states would 
lead to, not only initiatives in those states to restrict their own state 
legislative terms, but also . . . a demand for a constitutional amendment to do 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
As to what are the implications of term limitations in the state of California, 
a lot of people think that this is a partisan issue. I have tried to make the 
argument that it is not really partisan at all. 
</P>
<P>
The parties could be helped by this . . . people would have to become more 
dependent on the party for funding and for guidance, and less dependent on the 
special interests. 
</P>
<P>
The big problem is that nationally -- or locally -- we do not have a culture 
that encourages and rewards public service for short periods of time. Democracy 
requires that, and yet we do not have it. That is why we created what, in 
effect, is a professional elite to govern us. Representation does not occur 
well then. 
</P>
<P>
Antonia Hernandez, president of the Mexican-American Legal Defense Fund: 
</P>
<P>
The Schabarum initiative (Proposition 140, backed by Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Pete Schabarum), with a six-year limit (for Assembly members), would 
have an adverse effect on the Latino community. We have begun to look at 
whether it would violate the Voting Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
Running for election is a very expensive proposition. For minorities who do not 
have a financial base, it is usually extremely hard to raise the money . . . 
well-financed, well-organized candidates who are supported by other communities 
will have a much better chance. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that as we (Latinos) begin to make entries into the political process, 
the rules are beginning to change. Elected officials are supposed to represent 
the people who elect them. If there are constant changes, the impact of term 
limits would be to empower the bureaucracy -- the people who are not elected -- 
and (they) would definitely empower the special interests who have the finances 
and the ability to assist the bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
Being an elected official takes experience. The first two years you are just 
finding your way around; the second two you are just hitting your stride, and 
in the third two years, you are on your way out (if 40 passed). It just doesn't 
make sense. 
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of problems with our political process, but this is not the 
solution. There is some merit to term limits, but they have to be done in a way 
that doesn't unduly strengthen the bureaucracy and others who are not elected. 
We should throw the rotten apples out, but not the whole system with it. 
</P>
<P>
Gary C. Jacobson, fellow, Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, 
Stanford University; professor of political science, UC San Diego: 
</P>
<P>
The standard argument is that the legislative branch would be weakened. 
Information will be held by bureaucrats, staff, special interests. I think that 
is true, but what we are overlooking are the perverse incentives we set up. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of worrying about what their constituents think, as it gets toward the 
end of their term, legislators are going to be worried about what their next 
employer thinks, possibly in the private sector, or in their next constituency, 
which will not necessarily share the same interests as the one that elected 
them. 
</P>
<P>
So what it will do is reverse the incentive. If you give someone a job, for 
instance, and tell them that no matter how well they do it, they will be fired, 
the incentive to do that job well is not there.

AN UNLIKELY PROTECTOR OF A MUCH-ACCLAIMED SANDINISTA LEGACY; 
</P>
<P>
NICARAGUA: EVERYONE EXPECTED NEW PRESIDENT CHAMORRO TO DISMANTLE THE COUNTRY'S 
HEALTH SYSTEM. NOW SHE STRIVES TO SAVE IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Harry Nelson and Gita Wheelis Nelson, Harry Nelson, a former Times reporter, 
writes on international health issues. Gita Wheelis Nelson is a health 
administrator in Santa Monica.

<TEXT>
<P>
When Violeta Barrios de Chamorro defeated Sandinista President Daniel Ortega in 
Nicaragua's elections last February, many expected her administration to waste 
little time in revamping one of the most celebrated of Sandinista legacies -- 
the country's health system. The new president's party platform had even called 
for abolishing it. 
</P>
<P>
But Chamorro's new health minister says he has no intention of dismantling the 
system built after the ouster of dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1978. The system 
is based on the principle that health is a right of all 3.7 million Nicaraguans 
and the responsibility of the government to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
The minister, Dr. Ernesto Salmeron, is a rotund 47-year-old pediatrician who 
has become perhaps the most controversial member of Chamorro's Cabinet because 
of his determination to preserve what is regarded as one of the most 
revolutionary Sandinista reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing to change in the health system except its efficiency," 
Salmeron declared in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro's support for Salmeron has angered the conservative elements of her 
coalition party, the National Opposition Union (UNO), as well as physicians who 
want to privatize the national health system. Her decision has also created 
special problems for the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID). For 
most of the '80s, the United States backed the Contra forces fighting the 
Sandinistas; during the elections, it embraced UNO's reform platform. 
</P>
<P>
After having no presence in Nicaragua for the past eight years, the agency is 
now responsible for dispensing the $300 million in economic aid to Nicaragua 
that Congress appropriated after Chamorro's victory. According to Janet 
Ballentyne, mission director in Managua, $225 million has been spent on 
emergency economic recovery and repatriating the Contras and refugees, with 
about $11.6 million going to health. The remaining $75 million will be divided 
up among education, health, nutrition, agriculture and similar development 
enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
For health care, the agency must now grapple with the politics of deciding what 
kind of health care to support and to which groups in Nicaragua to give the 
money. "The minister of health probably has the most difficult job in a country 
full of people with difficult jobs," Ballantyne said. 
</P>
<P>
During its early years, the health system acquired an international reputation 
for its achievements in lowering the infant mortality rate, conducting 
vaccination programs and promoting prevention services. Assistance came from 
dozens of U.S.-based private agencies, which sent manpower, money and medical 
resources to Nicaragua. The aid helped prevent a total collapse of the system. 
</P>
<P>
But after eight years of war and an economic blockade, Nicaragua's health 
system faces mounting epidemics, hospitals in disrepair, a scarcity of drugs 
and supplies, and a ruined economy. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the health ministry is drawing up a five-year plan, in which AID 
will participate, to prioritize the nation's health needs. A major fight is 
over whether primary health care -- immunization, nutrition, sanitation and so 
on -- or more complex and expensive hospital care -- open-heart surgery and 
nuclear medicine -- should receive top priority. 
</P>
<P>
Many physicians, particularly the specialists whose skills require 
high-technology surroundings, are pressuring the government to devote a higher 
percentage of the health budget to upgrading hospitals and spending more on 
curative medicine. Salmeron flatly opposes spending money on exotic hospital 
care at the expense of primary care. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I remain minister of health, that will not happen," he said. "We 
have a people with a low cultural level, with no good housing, no water 
supplies and electrification. We must provide potable water, good housing, 
electrification and education on how to prevent disease. Then we can start with 
something better." 
</P>
<P>
To date, nearly all the $11.6 million that AID has awarded for health has been 
allocated to private, voluntary organizations uninvolved in Nicaragua during 
the Sandinista reign. Only $100,000 -- for an immunization program -- has gone 
to the ministry of health for primary care. Nearly $4 million has been given to 
private organizations for hospital services. 
</P>
<P>
But Ballantyne predicted that when the five-year plan is ready, it will 
emphasize primary care. In that case, AID will support it with "a great deal of 
technical and financial expertise." 
</P>
<P>
Ballantyne's promise assumes that Salmeron will be successful at carrying out 
his crusade for primary care. Whether he will last long enough to achieve his 
goal is uncertain. In the beginning, Salmeron recalled, he was concerned about 
his future; now, he feels secure. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the February election, conservative medical leaders of UNO said 
they would replace the unified national health system with one similar to the 
shamefully inadequate system under Somoza, which favored the wealthy and middle 
class. 
</P>
<P>
Salmeron said he thrice turned down Chamorro's offer to become health minister 
before accepting it. A deeply religious person, he believes it is his mission 
to do "what is best for the poor." Salmeron quit a $4,000-a-month position with 
the Pan American Development Foundation to take the $350-a-month ministerial 
post. 
</P>
<P>
The health minister appears not to have strong political beliefs. "(T)he 
radical group in UNO thinks I am a Sandinista and the radical group among 
Sandinistas think I am some kind of counterrevolutionary." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the privatizers in UNO, Salmeron's opponents include conservatives in 
the State Department, which consistently has been unsupportive of governments 
that rely on public agencies to solve the problems of the poor. When in the 
United States to learn more about our health system, Salmeron was 
cold-shouldered in Washington by officials of various government agencies from 
which he was seeking assistance to revive Nicaragua's health services. 
</P>
<P>
On a visit to Miami, Salmeron said he tried to persuade the hundreds of 
Nicaraguan physicians who emigrated there during the 1980s to return home. To 
his knowledge, none have done so. "They are taking their time to see how things 
are going." 
</P>
<P>
Salmeron also believes that most of the doctors left Nicaragua not because they 
disliked the Sandinistas but because they were afraid their children would have 
to serve in the military and because "they like money."

THE MEDIA HAVE GOT IT WRONG -- MILITARY SAFETY PERFORMANCE IN GULF IS 
EXEMPLARY; 
</P>
<P>
IRAQ: ALTHOUGH 31 AMERICANS HAVE DIED, THE CASUALTY RATE IS FAR BELOW WHAT CAN 
BE EXPECTED WHEN 200,000 SOLDIERS ASSEMBLE IN A HARSH ENVIRONMENT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
So far, 31 American soldiers have been killed in accidents during Operation 
Desert Shield in the Persian Gulf. Is this too many? How should the accidental 
injury and fatality rates be interpreted? The media, faced with a lull in 
military action, has mistakenly transformed the gulf rates into an issue. 
</P>
<P>
In August, a number of Army soldiers were seriously injured when their 
Jeep-like High-Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle overturned in the desert 
sands. In September, a Marine Corps CH-53 Super Stallion helicopter suffered a 
mechanical failure while idling on the runway, causing it to overturn and burn. 
A number of accidents have involved low-level flying, some at night. All 
services have had their share of misfortune: Air Force, 6 incidents; Army, 2; 
Marine Corps, 2, and Navy, 1. 
</P>
<P>
Still, is the accident rate in the gulf excessive, as the media seem to be 
suggesting? And what about the design, engineering and production of the 
equipment in use in the gulf? Is it seriously flawed and thus the cause of the 
accidents, as some in the media have argued? 
</P>
<P>
In light of past experience, the U.S. military's performance is well within the 
bounds of expectation, considering the tempo of required combat training in a 
particularly harsh environment. And there is no evidence to tie the equipment 
deployed in the gulf to the reported accidents. Although equipment failure is 
frequently the cause of accidents, other factors include poor maintenance, 
operator error, physical fatigue and failure to follow proper procedures. In 
most investigations of accidents, it is not easy to isolate the cause. 
</P>
<P>
Using military historian Trevor Dupuy's calculations of the average rate of 
non-combat casualties, the 200,000-strong Middle East force should have 
sustained about 400 casualties by now. This rate has been relatively constant 
for all military forces of all nations since the 19th Century. The American 
experience regarding non-combat accidents during World War II, Korea and 
Vietnam, according to Dupuy, was not much different. 
</P>
<P>
While any death or injury is regrettable, the U.S. Central Command's record in 
the gulf so far is thus exemplary. Compare a similarly large military exercise 
in Europe in 1986 that involved 200,000 American soldiers for about a month. In 
the operation, accident, fatality and injury rates were closer to Dupuy's 
estimates than to those in Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
But historical comparisons are useful only up to a point, and important 
questions have been raised about the Persian Gulf accidents. Some armchair 
strategists, for example, have challenged the prudence of flying aircraft low 
and fast at night. This argument, however, begs the question of how to train 
helicopter and fighter crews to contend with the conditions under which they 
will actually fly combat missions. 
</P>
<P>
The alternative of flying exclusively in broad daylight, at altitudes and 
speeds easily targetable by enemy anti-aircraft weapons and even small-arms 
fire, is obviously unacceptable. The responsibility of the gulf military 
commanders is to exploit every advantage they can from their superior 
technology -- and, right now, U.S. forces own the night. Many lives will be 
saved by maintaining the required level of preparedness to strike Iraqi forces 
in darkness. It should be recalled that all hits by enemy fire on U.S. 
helicopters in Panama occurred during daylight. 
</P>
<P>
In an important sense, every accident is avoidable. Military commanders bear 
the sole burden of responsibility and accountability not only for accomplishing 
their mission, but also for the safety, health and welfare of the U.S. citizens 
entrusted to their command. For every mishap that occurs in their units, 
military leaders must identify, if possible, the act or omission that caused 
the accident and take firm action to ensure that those conditions do not recur. 
</P>
<P>
There is an unwritten understanding among that very small circle of officers 
selected for command that "good leaders have low accident rates." This means 
that if you want to keep your command when you have a spate of accidents, you 
had better do something to get your rate down. This is apparently what happened 
in 1989 when the U.S. Navy's response to a spate of accidents at sea was to 
shut down all fleet operations for 48 hours in order to review safety 
procedures. The recent 12-hour suspension of operations by U.S. air forces in 
the Persian Gulf was similarly motivated. 
</P>
<P>
All leaders have to confront the consequences of safety conditions in their 
units. The most difficult piece of correspondence I have had to write is the 
letter of notification to next of kin that a member of my command had lost his 
life because of a training accident. There is no adequate consolation for 
bereaved parents and loved ones that their son died "in the line of duty." It 
is a responsibility that weighs heavily on all good commanders; whenever a 
military leader is found lacking in such care and concern, he or she is 
unworthy of the authority entrusted to them and should be relieved. 
</P>
<P>
But military leaders also know that war is risky beyond anticipation. Only the 
commander has the responsibility to ensure that those who must fight in the 
field, on the bridge or in the cockpit are fully prepared to cope with the 
rigors of combat. And only he or she best knows the state of a unit's 
readiness, acclimation to the environment and how it stacks up against the 
mission to be performed. As a result, commanding officers endure the tension 
imposed by the requirement to direct the physical and mental preparations for 
combat in the most realistic manner possible, while at the same time not 
risking unduly the lives of their people while training. 
</P>
<P>
Such tension is healthy since both objectives -- realism in training and 
proficiency in combat -- are necessary. The trade-off in risks is well 
understood by those who have commanded in combat and afterward evaluated their 
preparation for real battle. 
</P>
<P>
When combat is imminent, as it appears it may be in the Persian Gulf, the 
commanders preparing the forces will correctly enhance their chances for 
success in battle by accepting some measure of risk in preparatory training. 
This means that soldiers must fire live ammunition in close proximity to their 
colleagues, that commanders and staffs must coordinate long-range artillery 
fire, close air support and naval gunfire. It also means that everyone in the 
gulf -- especially supporting personnel at locations likely to be targeted by 
Iraq -- must regularly be exposed to nonlethal doses of chemical weapons while 
working in their protective gear. During such exercises, some people are going 
to be hurt, but unless the accident rate rises beyond the level anticipated in 
combat, even if the rise is dramatic, we should not look for or create an issue 
where there is none. 
</P>
<P>
Military commanders in the gulf already have their hands full leading their 
organizations, conducting realistic and strenuous training, promoting high 
morale and, sadly, writing those few -- so far -- next-of-kin notification 
letters. They will not need to be further burdened by responding to uninformed 
criticism.

WALTER DURANTY: REPORTER IN MOSCOW COULD HAVE OPENED THE WORLD'S EYES; 
</P>
<P>
BOOK MARK: DRIVEN BY AMBITION, CORRESPONDENT WALTER DURANTY REPORTED HISTORY IN 
THE MAKING FROM THE SOVIET UNION FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS. BUT, SAYS AUTHOR S.J. 
TAYLOR, DURANTY'S AMBITION LET HIM BE SEDUCED BY PROXIMITY TO POWER, AND HE 
HELPED COVER UP SOME OF HISTORY'S BIGGEST LIES AS WELL. AN EXCERPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S.J. Taylor, S.J. Taylor is the author of Stalin's Apologist Walter Duranty: 
The New York Times's Man in Moscow. She lives in London. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1933, the watershed year, when Stalin finally achieved U.S. recognition, 
rumors had begun to surface about a famine in the grain-growing districts of 
the Ukraine, the Northern Caucasus and across the nomadic cattle country of 
Kazakhstan: a calamity of incalculable dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
For later generations, as the magnitude of that event emerged, questions would 
arise as to why the American public hadn't been told. How did Stalin manage to 
conceal the greatest man-made disaster in modern history, when perhaps as many 
as 10 million men, women, and children were allowed to die by slow starvation 
as a result of their refusal to conform to Stalin's plan to collectivize 
agriculture? 
</P>
<P>
Had this been a deliberate act of genocide or, as Walter Duranty (of the New 
York Times) characterized it, an example of anti-communist propaganda 
promulgated in "an eleventh-hour attempt to avert American recognition by 
picturing the Soviet Union as a land of ruin and despair"? . . . 
</P>
<P>
In mid-November 1932, Duranty paid a visit to William Strang, counselor at the 
British Embassy in Moscow. By this time, the British Foreign Office was 
formulating a general assessment of Duranty's character that was less than 
flattering. Duranty was described as "a somewhat shady individual, who has been 
accused (though not on convincing evidence, as far as I can tell) of being in 
the pay of the Soviet Government . . . " It was felt to be out of the question, 
however, that any of Duranty's opinions favoring the regime sprang "from 
genuine conviction," as was the case with other correspondents who held 
pro-Soviet views. 
</P>
<P>
On this occasion, Duranty attributed what he called "the present breakdown in 
agriculture" to the shortage of labor and of draft power. The peasants' 
slaughter of livestock in 1930 and its continuation "by fits and starts" since 
then, plus a serious shortage of fodder, meant that the livestock population of 
the country had shrunk to "only about 40% of the population in 1929." Current 
grain collections, Duranty continued, were "going badly." 
</P>
<P>
Less than a month later, Duranty again visited the Embassy, this time as a 
result of a dispatch he had written which paralleled his earlier conversation 
with Strang. The Soviets had viewed the report as being unfavorable, and 
shortly after its publication Duranty was visited by government emissaries who 
reproached him with his unfaithfulness. 
</P>
<P>
Duranty had planned a trip to Paris, but now postponed it, Strang wrote, 
worried that he wouldn't be allowed back into the country. Other Western 
correspondents documented the methods of coercion exercised by Soviet 
authorities over foreign newsmen, chiefly the ominous threat of losing their 
visas. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, a curt announcement of the execution of 35 agricultural 
officials for "wrecking" appeared in the Moscow papers. Forty others had been 
given long prison sentences. Duranty was to attribute much of the mismanagement 
of collectivization to this "quite efficient conspiracy," persisting with a 
version of events that ignored all the outward signs of a major catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a young man named Gareth Jones, who in early 1933 had taken a 
three-week walking trip through the famine-stricken area, reported that he had 
seen mass starvation. He announced this first in a press conference in Berlin, 
then at a lecture in London and at last in a story written for the Manchester 
Guardian, published only two days after Malcolm Muggeridge, who had been a 
stringer for the Guardian in Moscow, had published a number of similar 
dispatches. 
</P>
<P>
According to another correspondent in Moscow, Jones' report, coming hard on the 
heels of Muggeridge's eyewitness accounts, put the Soviet Press Office into a 
terrible state. Knowing that the Western correspondents were desperate to cover 
the Metro-Vickers trial (an industrial espionage trial of six Englishmen and a 
number of Russians), a Soviet official indicated that the reporters would be 
denied credentials if Jones' report were not repudiated. The reporters came to 
the conclusion that "compelling professional necessity" required them to go 
along with the request. 
</P>
<P>
Duranty himself took the lead in disputing Jones' account. In an important 
dispatch on March 31, 1933, one that worked out his rationale for 
collectivization, Duranty agreed that it was "all too true that the novelty and 
mismanagement of collective farming," plus a conspiracy in the agricultural 
sector by "wreckers" and "spoilers," had "made a mess of Soviet food 
production. 
</P>
<P>
"But -- to put it brutally -- you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs, 
and the Bolshevik leaders are just as indifferent to the casualties that may be 
involved in their drive toward socialism as any general during the World War 
who ordered a costly attack. . . . In fact, the Bolsheviki are more indifferent 
because they are animated by fanatical conviction." 
</P>
<P>
He was ready to agree that there had been "serious food shortages." But on the 
question of starvation, "there is no actual starvation or deaths from 
starvation but there is widespread mortality from disease due to malnutrition . 
. . " It was cutting semantic distinction pretty slim, and it remains the most 
outrageous equivocation of the period. 
</P>
<P>
Jones didn't hesitate in striking back. He wrote to the New York Times, 
(saying) he had visited some 20 villages where he saw incredible suffering, and 
talked personally with peasants and officials who told him that indeed the 
peasantry was starving to death. It was an uncompromising statement, but Jones 
was up against an Establishment larger than Duranty. The newspapers in the West 
were for the moment more interested in the Metro-Vickers trial than in any 
reports of famine. 
</P>
<P>
At long last, in September, 1933, Duranty headed south to report the famine. 
</P>
<P>
His first three stories from Rostov-on-Don, the heart of the famine district, 
consisted mostly of praise for the procedures used on the communal farms. He 
spoke of happy workers and plentiful harvests. Any talk of famine, he said, was 
"a sheer absurdity." 
</P>
<P>
Once he reached Kharkov, new evidence forced him to change his tack 
dramatically. "Early last year, under the pressure of the war danger in the Far 
East," he reluctantly admitted, the authorities took too much grain from the 
Ukraine. Meanwhile, a large number of peasants thought they could change the 
Communist Party's collectivization policy by refusing to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
The only clue he offered to the devastation was a comparison of the famine to 
the Battle of Verdun. But even this symbol of ultimate carnage fell short of 
the mark. As scholar Marco Carynyk has pointed out, during World War I, people 
were dying at the rate of 6,000 a day; in the Ukraine, peasants had died at the 
rate of 25,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian Famine of 1932-33 remains the greatest man-made disaster ever 
recorded, exceeding in scale even the Jewish Holocaust of the next decade. It 
was Duranty's destiny to become, in effect, the symbol for the West's failure 
to recognize and understand it at the time. 
</P>
<P>
When all is said and done, he alone, of all the witnesses to the terrible 
events, had sufficient prestige to exert an influence. Had he, a Pulitzer 
Prize-winner at the peak of his celebrity, spoken out in the pages of the New 
York Times, the world could not have ignored him, as it did Muggeridge and 
Jones, and events might have taken a different turn. If Duranty had taken a 
stand, he might now be accounted one of the century's great, uncompromising 
reporters. But he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
When it came to discretion and expediency, the Western Establishment that feted 
him, no less so than the Kremlin, had found their man.

Hurray, hurray, viva.

Finally the decision to curtail and control the sale of beer at football games 
and other events is catching up. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed it is a great relief toward the enjoyment of sports and entertainment, 
rather than fights and violence, and it lessens the impact of alcohol on the 
physical and psychological lives of the drinkers and victims of alcohol-related 
problems.

Regarding the article on the one-time beer ban at a Raiders game (Part B,Oct. 
12): 
</P>
<P>
I found it interesting that officials at the Coliseum said they were not 
engaging the issue of alcoholism, but the fan violence. 
</P>
<P>
Do these people think that fan violence would be at this dangerous level if 
there was no alcohol being sold? This is mass and classical denial of alcohol 
abuse. Alcohol is a drug that changes your behavior and not for the better. 
</P>
<P>
Let's quit denying what the reality is and face this problem regardless of how 
much money is involved.

Now let me see if I have this correct. One drunk fan is attacked by another 
drunk fan -- a serious incident, no argument. 
</P>
<P>
Then Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky and Supervisor Mike Antonovich, being the 
self-righteous politicians they are, voice their outrage concerning ugly, 
brutal Raiders fans! All 50,000 of us. Yes, we Raiders fans are fanatical about 
our team, but criminals? Be serious! 
</P>
<P>
How interesting life is when every day people die in the inner city from 
drive-by shootings. Where are Yaroslavsky and Antonovich then? Where is the 
dramatic action then? Could it be these two politicians are just trying to 
divert public attention away from their own miserable failings in dealing with 
real social and economic problems? 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that Raiders fans refrain from buying any food and drink from 
Coliseum concessionaires, then let these two hatchet men explain the loss of 
revenue to the people of Los Angeles.

So Joe Wilson, "Bush's Man in Baghdad" (World Report, Oct. 16), has "Old World" 
diplomatic skills. Since this is not defined in the article, I'll have to 
presume that the "skills" Wilson possesses are the ones mentioned in the 
article. 
</P>
<P>
They include Wilson's dreaming of being a diplomat in a war, coming from an 
"established" Northern California family, taking his scheduled autumn vacation 
on the French Riviera, collecting all that extra "danger pay" since Aug. 11, 
and just enjoying the sun from his deck chair by his swimming pool in his 
"Malibu-style" Baghdad home -- all this while wearing a festive Hawaiian shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Is it any wonder that America gets involved in foreign wars when our own 
diplomats freely admit that they "dream of war" and are "fascinated" to be in 
the middle of it? 
</P>
<P>
When I think of the 200,000 American troops risking their lives and living 
uncomfortably in Saudi Arabia, Wilson's comments are insulting at best. 
Diplomats are supposed to be there to prevent wars. Wilson appears to be 
enjoying the whole experience.

Collaboration of the U.S. and Arab allies to isolate Saddam Hussein is fragile

I first supported the aid and deployment of American troops to Saudi Arabia. I 
felt the U.S. was supported by the United Nations, and President Bush was 
indeed on the verge of creating a "new world order." 
</P>
<P>
However, as the crisis has fallen from the front pages of the American press 
and diplomatic efforts fall upon deaf ears, the news has taken on an ominous 
tone. 
</P>
<P>
The news which is now generated from the Persian Gulf includes stories of 
expensive but ineffective hardware. Planes, helicopters, missiles and troops do 
not function as planned or tested. The ability of the Apache helicopter to 
function only 2 1/2 hours in combat is one example. 
</P>
<P>
The initial deployment to the gulf has been replaced with news of downed 
aircraft and presumed-dead stories. It's time to bug out.

The frequency with which our military equipment is falling apart in Saudi 
Arabia and the increasing number of accidents give Saddam Hussein much hope. 
</P>
<P>
In a year's time, the mighty American military machine will have gradually 
self-destructed because of hasty design and workmanship. No need for gas and 
germ wars. The greed and corruption of American military contractors are doing 
the job for him. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if we can only get Hussein interested in buying the stuff, then we'll know 
for sure that his bark is worse than his bite. His arsenal would look 
impressive and intimidating, but the model glue holding the parts together will 
melt minutes after the engines are fired up.

<P>
THE CHICANOS' POLITICAL 'GREAT SIESTA' IS OVER. THE 'SLEEPING GIANT' IS 
RESOLVING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE 1990S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By XAVIER HERMOSILLO, Xavier Hermosillo, a West Covina public-relations 
consultant, has been a Republican Party activist in Southern California's 
Latino community. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Californians will elect a new governor on Nov. 6, launching an era of change in 
state politics and giving rise to weeks of political analysis: How did women, 
minorities, environmentalists and the Simpsons vote, and what does it mean, if 
anything? 
</P>
<P>
Analysts may also find the subtle emergence of a new trend in Mexican-American 
politics. Born of a strange marriage of sophistication and frustration, the 
Latino body politic in 1990 sports a much different look than its predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, there are some new ground rules. Chicano and Mexican-American are 
in, Hispanic is out as the term describing the majority of "Latinos." Being 
lumped together with Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Central and South Americans has 
weakened everyone's cultural identity and retarded progress for the 
fastest-growing segments of our society. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the Democratic Party isn't the only "in" party any longer, and the 
Republican Party isn't totally "out" with Chicanos. Liberal attitudes about 
government money solving all problems are out. There is a new eye toward 
business, especially home-grown Chicano business, in planning for a brighter 
future. Education is still very much in, but quiet, passive wait-and-see 
patience is out. A new militancy is definitely in. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Pete Wilson or Dianne Feinstein wins, the next chief executive of 
California faces some hard scrutiny from the Chicano community. The realization 
that the last 20 years has seen very little progress or change from either 
political party dictates a new strategy for the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
It is too early to redirect some of the legions of hard-core Democrat voters 
away from the old politics-as-usual way of voting. My parents still espouse the 
"I vote Democrat, right or wrong" philosophy, eschewing change in favor of the 
more comfortable status quo. Yet many Mexican-American community leaders who 
previously shared my parents' sentiments are exploring new territories. We're 
finally beginning to realize that neither party has done our community any 
favors. Furthermore, East Los Angeles and its elected representatives no longer 
have a corner on Chicano politics. The San Gabriel and San Fernando valleys, as 
well as the Inland Empire, have Latino populations rivaling the East L.A. 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
From San Pedro to San Bernardino, from Carson to Corona and throughout the rest 
of California and the Southwest, brown faces are increasing by record numbers. 
So are the frustrations of diminished opportunities, inferior education, 
limited access to political and economic empowerment and increasing incidents 
of hate crimes and an anti-ethnic attitude by some in the palaces of power. 
</P>
<P>
The gubernatorial election isn't exciting many people in the state, let alone 
the Chicano commuity. This shouldn't be surprising, since political pundits and 
pollsters have been telling us that neither Pete Wilson nor Dianne Feinstein 
has taken the state by storm. 
</P>
<P>
When Mexican-Americans weigh the two candidates' records, they can examine the 
Wilson and Feinstein histories when they governed as mayors of San Diego and 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Neither city has been a hotbed of Latino growth and progress. The Feinstein 
campaign touts her appointment of San Francisco County Supervisor Jim Gonzalez; 
Wilson points to his border city's tremendous growth, the state's first 
mass-transit rail project and continued close working relations with Tijuana 
and Mexico. Yet San Diego still lacks Latino representation on either the City 
Council or county Board of Supervisors. In fact, it is now embroiled in its own 
version of Los Angeles County's struggle to redraw district lines to ensure 
Latino access to political power. 
</P>
<P>
While it is clear that both candidates have enjoyed cozy relationships with 
past Hispanic constituencies, today's Chicano community in California and the 
Southwest has a new agenda. 
</P>
<P>
The two candidates owe the people of California a meaningful dialogue with a 
broad cross-section of the Chicano community -- before Election Day and beyond. 
Anyone who claims to have the Chicano vote in the bag, or any politician who 
promises that today, is a fool. 
</P>
<P>
The perceived "great siesta" is over. The "sleeping giant," as the Chicano 
community has been called, has its feet firmly planted in today's California 
realities. It is resolving to make a difference in the 1990s, to flex its 
political and economic muscle from rural Northern California to the Mexican 
border. 
</P>
<P>
We will see a fierce new brand of Chicano politics: Power is in; the unassuming 
Senor Nice Guy is definitely out.

There was a bus. 
</P>
<P>
You were either on the bus or off the bus. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1964, Ken Kesey and some friends boarded a 1939 International 
Harvester school bus named Furthur or Further (the spelling varied). The sides 
screamed with swirls of bright paint, a style soon to be called psychedelic; 
the back sported a deck and motorcycle, and a turret punched through the roof. 
The vehicle was armed with endless supplies of movie film, an intricate sound 
system that could broadcast and record whatever interesting decibels happened 
by, and a larder of LSD and marijuana. At the wheel was Neal Cassady, a.k.a. 
Dean Moriarty, the phantom helmsman of a generation dreaming of going on the 
road after reading Jack Kerouac's novel. Probably no one on Earth had seen such 
a sight before. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was to travel to the New York World's Fair, do some dope, have some 
experiences and make a movie at the same time. Tom Wolfe based a best seller 
(more than 30 printings), "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test," on Kesey, the bus, 
and his band of Merry Pranksters. Furthur had the face that launched a thousand 
hippie school buses. Now, a quarter century after the ride, two new books try 
to figure out what happened on the bus. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Perry and Ken Babbs' "On the Bus" is a scrapbook (with 100 black-and-white 
and 16 color photos) that mixes simple narrative with observations by various 
Merry Pranksters, transcripts of tapes made at the time, and comments by 
observers like Hunter S. Thompson, Gordon Lish, Jerry Garcia and others. The 
book gives a handy history of LSD, and a chronicle of Kesey and the Pranksters 
after the bus ride -- the acid tests, the busts, and the eventual descent of 
the band into relatively ordinary lives. 
</P>
<P>
For Furtherologists, it constitutes a treasure trove of material and will fuel 
many dissertations in pop culture or deviant behavior. For anyone seeking solid 
ground in the stoned information system of Merry Pranksterdom, the book has 
real dates, a map of the route and many other hard little kernels of fact to 
cling to in the afterflashes of an acid trip. The various visits by Hunter 
Thompson to the text function as ice picks in the brain. The inventor of gonzo 
here functions as the sane person who has wandered into a madhouse -- for 
example, his chilling account of a gang rape at a Prankster-Hell's Angels 
party. 
</P>
<P>
Kesey's book, "The Further Inquiry," originally written as a script, imagines 
the trial of the ghost of Neal Cassady by the authorities. It is confusing at 
first, laid out in an unconventional manner (there is a flip book of Cassady 
photos that makes him whirl and shout), always bizarre, and above all, alive. 
</P>
<P>
Kesey has one of the battered reputations in American letters -- the young 
hotshot who cranked out a best seller, "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," and 
then wrote the big book, "Sometimes a Great Notion," a novel that most critics 
did not like, and that has been largely dismissed by all but a cult following 
since its publication. 
</P>
<P>
"On the Bus" has Kesey saying: "Unless you get up very near that precipice 
where you're likely to make a fool of yourself, you're not showing much of how 
you feel. You're playing it safe -- the way Hemingway did most of the time." 
After finishing "Sometimes a Great Notion," he got on the bus, stepped off the 
precipice, and stopped writing novels. At one level, both these accounts 
describe how Ken Kesey tried to detox from modern American fiction. 
</P>
<P>
The two books overlap but do not compete. Perry and Babbs nail down the record, 
Kesey wrestles with the meaning. And both volumes are dominated by one dead 
man, Neal Cassady, a creation who successfully blows Kesey to the edge of the 
page. 
</P>
<P>
Cassady was the street kid from Denver who stole 600 cars before he was 16, the 
sojourner in reform schools and prisons, the pal of the Beats such as Kerouac, 
Allan Ginsberg and William Burroughs, the man who made a living changing tires, 
the nonstop talker who never really got around to writing but whom everyone 
else wrote about. He showed up at Kesey's house three days before the bus left, 
signed on as a tire expert, and quickly took over the action. 
</P>
<P>
One of the key moments in the trip occurred when the bus got stuck in the mud 
at Wikieup, Ariz., and a tractor came and pulled it out. During the wait, the 
passengers swallowed a lot of LSD and wandered along a desert stream, stoned 
out of their minds. When the bus is finally freed, in Kesey's screenplay, Ken 
Babbs shouts, "We've done it. We've done it! . . . We've won!" Kesey chimes in 
with, "We've conquered! Conquered! . . . Some the worse for wear, perhaps, but 
conquered nevertheless." A few pages later, Cassady puts a different spin on 
the hours doing acid in the desert. "That's the whole thing we've been talking 
about," he explains. "It is. Can't you freaks see it?" 
</P>
<P>
See what? The bus trip by and large was full of humdrum events, or failed 
meetings. At Larry McMurtry's in Houston, one Prankster wanders off stoned and 
naked to be nabbed by cops and left behind. In New Orleans, the crew decides to 
take a swim, stumbles onto a beach for blacks only and leaves in time. A New 
York meeting with Kerouac fails when he scorns their hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
They descend on Millbrook, Richard Alpert and Timothy Leary's acid-research 
center in New York State, a huge mansion where spiritual inquiries are made 
into the meaning of the drug experience. Kesey, Cassady and band arrive with 
smoke grenades, a desire to boogie, and when West meets East it just doesn't 
work. One of the joys of "On the Bus" is Alpert's (now Ram Dass) explanations 
of why he failed to sense that this visitation of modern Vandals mattered at 
all. So why are we recalling a botched bus ride on paved interstate highways 25 
years after the event? 
</P>
<P>
Because something happened back then, something that we've chosen to see as 
perhaps beginning with a ride in a 1939 International Harvester school bus. 
Something that can be scented in the manic raps by Cassady that both books 
record, the incoherent chatter that makes a kind of sense. 
</P>
<P>
Here is Cassady at the wheel, stoned with a joint in his hand, driving a bus 
with essentially no brakes down the Jersey Turnpike toward the bowels of New 
York, and riffing: "All right, I'll bring it down. Bring it down gently. Gotta 
bring it down. . . . I think the elementals are getting through! They get 
through in a continuing pattern. In other words: In every force, in every 
world, in every stream, in every structure -- like, say a road -- its weakest 
link, the road is no better than its weakest link, you see? Now the weak spot 
is always attacked by the highest of the next lower forces. Like a second 
dimensional, third dimensional, fourth dimensional . . . worlds separate, but 
worlds that still touch . . . . We are actually fourth-dimensional beings in a 
third-dimensional body inhabiting a second-dimensional world!" 
</P>
<P>
For several years now, there has been a cottage industry of '60s nostalgia. And 
a counter-industry of denunciations -- Just Say No -- of whatever bonfires the 
'60s lit. These two books are about something else: genesis. They contain a lot 
of what those years looked like and sounded like, some of what they meant, and 
much more important, a few moments of feeling that capture why their memory 
won't seem to go away. There is a stoned Hunter Thompson racing his motorcycle 
in pursuit of mysterious red lights only to find after an hour or so that he is 
four feet from the taillights of a terrorized family in a sedan. There is Neal 
Cassady's ghost being tried by the authorities for poisoning American life. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict is still out. Read these books if you are interested in who dunnit.

Whenever Larry McMurtry sits down at the campfire of modern fiction, a wild 
cast of characters soon amble in from the shadows, and their compelling yarns 
quickly edge any weighty issues into the background. So it is in this tale of 
Martha Jane Canary, better known as Calamity Jane, as she and her companeros 
ramble across their old stompin' grounds, from the great plains of the Dakotas 
to the mountains of Montana and Wyoming, aimlessly seeking some vague goal that 
they all sense can no longer be found. 
</P>
<P>
The Indian wars are over, the buffalo gone, and the romance of the West withers 
even as the legends it spawned blossom. The challenges of the old West took a 
physical toll, but this transitional era leaves folks without purpose. While 
the only violence in this novel happens "off stage," there is plenty of pain to 
go around. Now it is the characters' souls that get a sound whomping. 
</P>
<P>
In her younger days, Jane loved to "drink and sing and hoorah" with the 
cowboys. As "Buffalo Girls" unfolds, though, her carousing has become a form of 
self-administered anesthesia, rather than a celebration of the West's huge 
freedom. None of this is lost on the friends who wander in and out of Jane's 
life, including mountain men Bartle Bones and Jim Ragg, an old Ogalala Sioux 
named No Ears and Jane's best friend Dora DuFran, who runs a Miles City saloon 
and whorehouse named Hotel Hope. 
</P>
<P>
The central irony of the story is that the only hope of salvation for these 
characters arrives in an offer from their old friend Buffalo Bill, who 
convinces them that they might recapture their past glories -- real or imagined 
-- by joining his Wild West Show for a performance before Queen Victoria in 
London. In their hearts, Jane and her friends see the paradox. As Bartle says: 
"If Billy Cody can make a poster of it, then there ain't no Wild West." But 
Jane understands how desperately people can cling to foolish hopes. Eventually, 
she and her friends join Cody, Annie Oakley, Sitting Bull and other characters 
from the history books and McMurtry's imagination to condense the shoot-'em-up 
history and myth of the West into a sort of live-action miniseries, there in 
the heart of the civilization their forebears abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
It is fruitless to try and figure out how closely McMurtry sticks to facts 
here, because so many of the figures in this novel, as in "Anything for Billy" 
before it, were mired in legend long before McMurtry plucked them from their 
graves. 
</P>
<P>
But the mythologizing of history is only part of what "Buffalo Girls" is about. 
Both the characters and their country are struggling with middle age and the 
possibility that "the fun is over," and this discussion of loss and maturity 
also drives the book. 
</P>
<P>
Because "the fun" often was so excessive, for instance, the characters are left 
to face regrets. The West, Bartle concedes wistfully, has been "used up." 
</P>
<P>
" 'I blame it on the Indians,' he says. 'They gave up too soon.' " But he knows 
where the real blame lies: "What a monstrous mistake it had been to popularize 
buffalo hunting. Millions of them had roamed the plains -- it still seemed 
hardly credible to men who had seen the great herds in their glory that so many 
animals could be killed in only three years. But it had occurred: It weakened 
the Indians, armies had marched, brave men had died, and now they were to down 
to expositions." 
</P>
<P>
In one of the more poignant scenes in a book full of them, Jim Ragg, who has 
been inconsolable since he faced the realization that the beaver had gone the 
way of the buffalo, finds an exhibit of live American beaver at the London zoo. 
</P>
<P>
For days, he sits and watches the animals he spent his life trapping, his faith 
in the world renewed. 
</P>
<P>
In another wonderful scene, No Ears, perhaps the most engaging character in the 
book, seems to foresee the continued destruction of the world's resources. As 
he sits on the boat that is taking the show to England, enthralled by the 
ocean, the vast "herds" of fish flashing beneath the waves remind him of the 
buffalo charging in seemingly endless profusion over the plains. 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry tells his story in part through letters supposedly written by Jane to 
her daughter Janey, whom she has sent away to live with a well-to-do city 
couple. Recently, several male writers -- Jay McInerney, Reynolds Price and Jim 
Harrison among them -- have attempted to write from a woman's viewpoint, with 
mixed results. Some feminist critics even have chastised them for their 
arrogance. The real Jane did write letters to a supposed daughter, but with 
McMurtry's grip on Calamity's pen, these letters take some unusual twists, and 
the gender issue in "Buffalo Girls" is complicated by the fact that Jane is an 
unusually well-balanced mix of masculine and feminine traits. Even the delicate 
issue of Jane's suspect womanhood, however, becomes almost insignificant in the 
sprawling context of the West -- where, as McMurtry portrays things, tolerance 
is as important a survival technique as knowing how to crawl into the 
still-warm belly of a slaughtered buffalo in a blizzard. 
</P>
<P>
Wisely, McMurtry keeps the epistolary tactic reined in. Jane's voice is merely 
an intriguing subtext to his own much richer narrative voice. It is McMurtry's 
description and dialogue and character, after all, that make readers plunge 
into the author's books the way some people fall into soap operas, wanting to 
spend as much time with his imagined people as possible, even though the 
characters are often thoroughly disagreeable. 
</P>
<P>
In this sense, "Buffalo Girls" is "Lonesome Dove" writ small. The book rolls 
along on anexistential current of melancholy, in contrast to which the moments 
of joy and hilarity are especially vivid. The good old days are gone, and most 
of these people will have no part in what follows. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to the West from England, No Ears finds his people demoralized, 
lacking even the survival instinct to listen to the old man's spiritual wisdom. 
Jane and her companeros have grown lazy and confused, unwilling to embrace the 
myths they are becoming, yet living in their own self-embellished pasts. As 
Jane writes: "Now all I do is piddle around in my memories. You've seen 
children make mud pies? That's what I do with my memories, I pat them into the 
shape I want them to take." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is something about these people and their passion for life that 
makes you want to be with them. You want to sit in the dirt and share that old 
prairie dog that Jim Ragg has just cooked over a barely flickering fire, even 
though he suspects it may be diseased. Why? Because set against the 
overwhelming vastness of the West, and of life, tolerable companionship looks 
awfully good. Despite the mundane sadness and glorious tragedy that stalks 
them, McMurtry's characters seem to understand that life is, as one cowboy put 
it, "a sturdy business." 
</P>
<P>
How the West was won (or lost) doesn't make all that much difference here. 
History happened, and that's that. What matters is that the world was kept from 
flying apart by something as simple as friendship.

A SHRINE TO THE SPIRIT OF NOTHINGNESS; 
</P>
<P>
THE MUSIC OF CHANCE BY PAUL AUSTER (VIKING: $18.95; 217 PP.; 0-670-83535-8)

<P>
There is an imaginative richness to Paul Auster's sixth novel which offers many 
levels to enjoy in this short, deceptively simple book. 
</P>
<P>
First, it is the compelling narrative of Jim Nashe, a man cut loose from his 
roots who finds himself in the company of a gambler and bets his future on the 
turn of a card. It is also a deeply American fable of the modern age in which 
the demons of loneliness and meaninglessness are confronted by existential acts 
of trust, responsibility, and faith. 
</P>
<P>
Given Auster's impressive intellectual background, it is not surprising that 
this story is a maze of literary mind games -- metaphors and references that 
ricochet playfully from page to page, symbolic touches that alter your 
understandings of this escapade while it is in motion. At yet another level, in 
"The Music of Chance" (as in all satisfying serious fiction), there are 
profound philosophical issues with which Auster's characters grapple. 
</P>
<P>
Let us begin, as Auster does, with a straightforward exposition of the plot. As 
you will see, the more complex levels of this novel insinuate themselves gently 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Nashe, a Boston fireman, inherits nearly $200,000 from his father, whom he 
has not seen in more than 30 years. The money comes too late to save his 
shattered marriage, so he heads for Minnesota, where his sister is bringing up 
his only child, Juliette. 
</P>
<P>
It becomes quickly apparent to Nashe that his daughter is better off staying in 
the happy family surroundings she has come to regard as her real home. He 
establishes a trust fund for her future with half the money, pays off the 
$32,000 he owes the Florida nursing home for convalescent care of his mother 
before her death, quits his job and gets rid of the contents of his apartment. 
Then, in a brand-new red two-door Saab 900, Nashe hits the open road with a 
vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
Speeding aimlessly from state to state like a Joan Didion heroine in extremis 
or a Jack Kerouac character in the Age of Freeways, Nashe experiences a 
peculiar contemporary dissociation of sensibility: "Nothing around him lasted 
for more than a moment, and as one moment followed another, it was as though he 
alone continued to exist. He was a fixed point in a whirl of changes, a body 
poised in utter stillness as the world rushed through him and disappeared. The 
car became a sanctum of invulnerability, a refuge in which nothing could hurt 
him any more. As long as he was driving, he carried no burdens, was 
unencumbered by even the slightest particle of his former life." 
</P>
<P>
He drives alone like this, 16 or 17 hours a day, for more than a year. Then, 
one morning on a country road in Dutchess County, N.Y., he picks up a stranger, 
and his life changes. The stranger is Jack Pozzi, a man in his early 20s who 
earns his living playing poker. As they drive into New York City, he tells 
Nashe that he needs a $10,000 stake for a poker game he has set up with two 
wealthy "suckers" who won the Pennsylvania State Lottery. In a flash, Nashe 
impulsively decides to put up his last $10,000 for Pozzi: "The entire process 
couldn't have taken longer than a second or two, but that was enough to send 
him hurtling over the edge of a cliff." 
</P>
<P>
When Pozzi sits down at the poker table with Bill Flower and Willie Stone at 
their isolated country estate, they wipe him out and win the entire $10,000. 
Worse, at Nashe's insistence, he and Pozzi gamble further and end up owing 
Flower and Stone $10,000 more. 
</P>
<P>
After considerable quarreling, he and Pozzi agree to a bizarre bargain: They 
will stay on the estate for 50 days and build a wall in order to pay off their 
debt. The second half of the book describes their experience of building the 
wall and Nashe's changing thoughts as he finds fulfillment in this labor. This 
exploration of Nashe's shifting sense of self-determination reads like a 
brilliant dramatization of Erich Fromm's "Escape From Freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Early in this story, Auster presents Nashe with the Robert Frost dilemma of two 
off-ramps diverging on a freeway, and from then on, he evokes images from 
American myth and literature almost nonstop. Yankee Peddler/Dean Moriarty/Henry 
Miller allusions pop up as Nashe zig-zags across the American landscape with 
vaguely westward yearnings. After he meets Pozzi, their fantasies of wealth 
deliberately remind the reader of Jay Gatsby and Willy Loman. By the time Nashe 
and Pozzi, entranced by the music of chance, set off to seek freedom in a poker 
game, it is difficult to avoid thinking of Huck and Jim floating down the 
Mississippi River on a similar journey. 
</P>
<P>
The estate of Stone and Flower is located in the town of Ockham, Pa. By now, we 
could hardly think it coincidental that the 14th-Century English philosopher 
who expounded the principle that explanations in philosophy should be kept as 
simple as possible was William of Ockham; his principle was known as "Ockham's 
Razor." 
</P>
<P>
In the huge house they occupy on the estate, one wing is devoted to Flower's 
museum of knickknacks, things connected to history: "The telephone that had 
once sat on Woodrow Wilson's desk. A pearl earring worn by Sir Walter Raleigh. 
A pencil that had fallen from Enrico Fermi's pocket in 1942. General 
McClellan's field glasses. A half-smoked cigar filched from an ashtray in 
Winston Churchill's office. . . . It was all so random, so misconstrued, so 
utterly beside the point." In case you don't get the point, Auster adds, 
"Flower's museum was a graveyard of shadows, a demented shrine to the spirit of 
nothingness." 
</P>
<P>
Stone's wing of the house contains "the City of the World," a miniature replica 
of a utopian city, including the house that they are standing in. Stone, a 
former optometrist, creates this all under magnifying glasses and is intending 
to make a model of his room containing the model, which would contain another 
room and another model. This is an echo of the replicated castle in Edward 
Albee's play, "Tiny Alice," in which the metaphysical questions of free will 
and man's relationship to God are explored. The parallels with Samuel Beckett's 
"Waiting for Godot" are even stronger, with Nashe and Pozzi playing Lucky and 
Pozzo to Flower's and Stone's Vladimir and Estragon. 
</P>
<P>
A critic enthralled by the possibilities of a sophisticated novel such as this 
runs the danger of making it sound like a boring trash heap of clanging symbols 
and arcane allusions. Permit me to eliminate any possibility of such an 
injustice: "The Music of Chance" is an accessible, readable story that can be 
enjoyed by readers of all levels. It is an exceptional novel about the 
interplay of freedom and chance which takes you on an engrossing tour of a 
man's inner life. In fact, it is a revelation of the process Jim Nashe 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Auster, a poet and translator whose "New York Trilogy" brought him critical 
acclaim as an experimental novelist, broke into the mainstream of literature 
last year with a novel called "Moon Palace." At the end of his review of that 
book in the New Republic, Sven Birkerts noted that Auster "stands poised to 
write something momentous about our times." He has done just that in "The Music 
of Chance," a book that speaks to the little piece of Las Vegas in each of our 
hearts.

OTHERLIVES: MAKING TRACKS: AN AMERICAN RAIL ODYSSEY BY TERRY PINDELL (GROVE 
WEIDENFELD: $22.95; 399 PP.) 
</P>

<P>
You know a book isn't all it could be when the author notes in the 
acknowledgements that both his publisher and editor have left the publishing 
house. That's certainly true here, for "Making Tracks" is a competent book that 
frustrates because it isn't better. 
</P>
<P>
Train-travel books usually are fun, and this one is no exception, but it 
suffers from poor shaping; Terry Pindell, a former English teacher and grandson 
of a railroad engineer, can't decide whether his book should be a local or an 
express. He often lingers on uninteresting people, places, and events while 
speeding by others with greater promise. 
</P>
<P>
By Page 100, we've already journeyed from New Hampshire to Florida, from 
Massachusetts to San Francisco, and from San Francisco nearly to New Orleans, 
and that pace all but ensures superficial comment. Pindell devotes a scant two 
pages to the S.F.-L.A. route, for example, and a few more chronicling the 
state's early railway wars, but in attempting to integrate history, social 
commentary and landscape description in bite-size pieces, he sacrifices any 
sense of momentum. 
</P>
<P>
For all that, Pindell has crammed "Making Tracks" with many unusual facts and 
observations -- I certainly didn't know the term "cowcatcher" once was literal: 
the contraptions initially made of pointed spikes and intended to turn 
inattentive animals into the train crew's next meal -- and at those moments, 
the book redeems itself.

OTHERLIVES: GRETZKY: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY BY WAYNE GRETZKY WITH RICK REILLY

<P>
It's unlikely we'll ever see a deal in sports to compare with the one that 
brought Wayne Gretzky to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988. Gretzky so dominated 
the National Hockey League that he had won its Most Valuable Player trophy 
eight of the previous nine years; he had not only set but obliterated every 
previous offensive record in the book. 
</P>
<P>
So why was Gretzky traded? Money, he says here, in his first extended comment 
on the deal; the trade had nothing to do with his marriage to aspiring actress 
Janet Jones and everything to do with the financial straits of Edmonton Oilers 
owner Peter (Puck) Pocklington. Gretzky didn't want to leave Edmonton, he says, 
expecting to win the city a few more Stanley Cups -- the Oilers won their 
fourth in five years just two hours before Gretzky first learned of the trade 
talk -- but Pocklington had to break his personal-services contract with the 
player before he could take the Oilers public and stave off possible 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Few athletes can claim to dominate a sport the way Gretzky has dominated. How 
many have won their lifelong epithet -- Gretzky's is "The Great One" -- at age 
10? That's when he scored 378 goals in 69 games in Little League play (the 
next-highest scorer tallied 140), and it was only the beginning of a long 
string of triumphs. Gretzky turned pro at 16, landed in the NHL -- his third 
pro league -- at 17, and thereafter let his stick do most of the talking. In 
the book, he does criticize the occasional coach, but rarely other players, and 
is careful not to boast. He says he looks "like the guy who bags your groceries 
at the local supermarket," he always finished dead last in the Oilers' strength 
tests, and, amazingly, he has poor peripheral vision. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky tiptoes around his experiences to date in Los Angeles. He heaps praise 
on the Kings' owner, Bruce McNall; hints at minor problems with coaching and 
management, and talks of bringing the Stanley Cup to the city, but says he 
still wants Edmonton "to be a home." Hockey fans will get a kick out of 
Gretzky, for the author is more voluble here -- credit co-author Rick Reilly -- 
than his reputation would have us believe.

OTHERLIVES: I AM THE BLUES: THE WILLIE DIXON STORY BY WILLIE DIXON WITH DON 
SNOWDEN (DA CAPO: $12.95; 264 PP., PAPER) 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's appropriate that Willie Dixon's autobiography should have been published 
first in Britain, for American blues musicians have long received more respect 
abroad than at home. And it's embarrassing, too, for Dixon, who now lives in 
Los Angeles, is responsible for numerous rock classics like "Spoonful," "Back 
Door Man" and "Little Red Rooster." 
</P>
<P>
Noting Dixon's influence on the rock world is a bit disingenuous, however, for 
"I Am the Blues" has almost nothing to do with the likes of Presley, Clapton 
and Jagger. This book is the real thing, told in a great bluesman's own words: 
about growing up black, poor and musically gifted. 
</P>
<P>
"I Am the Blues" is a somewhat ungainly package, frequent Los Angeles Times 
contributor Don Snowden having stitched together interviews with Dixon and 
other blues people with a factual narrative of his own. But it works, mainly 
because Dixon's presence in the book is so strong and commanding. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1915 in Mississippi, Dixon "got up to be a pretty good size" (as he 
puts it) by age 12 and began making as much as a dollar a day hauling anything 
heavy -- ice, timber, coal. He also let people slug him for a nickel -- 
business actually picked up, Dixon reports, after a self-described prizefighter 
broke an arm hitting him in the stomach -- and became a good enough boxer to 
win a Golden Gloves heavyweight championship in Chicago, where Dixon moved in 
1936. He was suspended after four fights following a scuffle over fees in the 
boxing commissioner's office, but by that time the blues culture on the city's 
South Side had given Dixon a new career. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon had sold songs to other musicians since his early teens, but the 
segregated music world ensured that he couldn't make a living at it. He made 
spending money from playing bass and singing with various bands, the best known 
being the Big Three Trio, which usually performed for white audiences, unlike 
most other great Chicago blues groups. The general indifference to the blues at 
the time can be gauged by the fact that the band once had to play the latter 
song with polka players, leading Dixon to write, "Boy, a polka band can mess up 
a blues worse than anything in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon tells scores of stories like that one -- about his years as a studio 
producer for Chess records; about the European tours in which bluesmen were 
treated nearly like royalty; about long-running attempts to regain copyrights 
to his songs -- and they make "I Am the Blues" a marvelous read. Few books feel 
as authentic as this one, and it certainly accomplishes Dixon's purpose: to 
educate listeners about "the facts of life and the wisdom and knowledge of the 
blues."

OTHERLIVES: THE TIME OF MY LIFE BY DENIS HEALEY (W.W. NORTON: $29.95; 607 PP.)

When this book was published in London last year, the Economist was compelled 
to call Denis Healey "probably the best prime minister Britain never had." It's 
hard to argue with that assessment, for Healey comes through in "The Time of My 
Life" as a man of conviction, confidence and significant political savvy. More 
important, he also demonstrates a clear political philosophy -- call it 
"liberal pragmatism" -- that ensured, paradoxically, both his leadership in the 
Labour Party and his failure to take up residence at 10 Downing Street. Healey 
often writes that he would much rather "do" than "be," and that's easy to 
believe; often described as a loner, Healey seems more interested in the job of 
governance than in promoting himself. 
</P>
<P>
"The Time of My Life" often is less than engaging for that very reason -- arms 
control and budgeting issues (Healey was defence secretary from 1964 to 1970, 
chancellor of the exchequer from 1974 to 1979) are sufficiently technical to be 
only intermittently interesting. However, Healey's description of Labour 
politics is absorbing, largely because it parallels that of the Democratic 
party in this country; the ascendancy of the conservative viewpoint in both the 
United States and the United Kingdom is directly linked to decades of liberal 
backbiting and indecisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Healey distinguishes himself from most American political memoirists by failing 
to spend much time settling old scores -- although when he does, he's wickedly 
effective. Of Harold Wilson during his first term as prime minister, he writes: 
" . . . a capacity for self-delusion which made Walter Mitty appear 
unimaginative." Of a fellow Member of Parliament: "I cannot say my heart always 
rose when his long anteater's proboscis began to quiver, and his mouth began 
its gobbling splutter." Of Lyndon Johnson: simply "a monster." 
</P>
<P>
"The Time of My Life," in short, contains gems, but they take some excavating 
to find.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: 84, CHARING CROSS ROAD BY HELENE HANFF (PENGUIN: $7.95)

<TEXT>
<P>
The popular television dramatization of "84, Charing Cross Road" has not 
diminished the charm of Helene Hanff's book. 
</P>
<P>
A collection of letters between a struggling young writer in post-World War II 
New York City and the staff of a small used-book store in London, "Charing 
Cross" chronicles the changes England underwent as rationing and austerity gave 
way to prosperity. A voracious and discriminating reader, Hanff filled her 
letters with concise, intelligent discussions of English literature and the 
joys of book-collecting. The ideal book to tuck away for a rainy afternoon.

Lynda Barry's latest book, a series of letters and diary entries written by a 
14-year-old girl during the late '60s, bridges cartooning and fiction writing. 
</P>
<P>
Maybonne Mullen describes the pleasures and traumas of junior high school, that 
awful period of adolescence humans somehow survive. The product of what was 
called a "broken home," Maybonne must confront problems they didn't mention on 
the re-runs of "The Donna Reed Show:" her father's alcoholism, peer pressure to 
experiment with alcohol and sex, sibling rivalry and even child-abuse in one 
dramatic, sensitively written sequence. Barry's prose cleverly reveals the 
comedy inherent in adolescent self-dramatization; her quirky drawings, which 
resemble notebook doodles, somehow capture the appearance of the nerdy heroine 
and her baby sister.

A CRITIC'S FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are many good-to-excellent restaurants in the greater Los Angeles area 
that deserve more than a narrative of the reviewer's disgruntled friends. 
Critic Ruth Reichl is getting too big for her brioche. 
</P>
<P>
When I read a review, I want to hear an educated commentary on the food, I want 
to know that the reviewer has researched the goals of the restaurant and I want 
to get a feeling of the ambience. What I don't want is to read about miserable 
friends talked into ugly dining experiences, boring stories, cute quips about 
reluctant gourmets and a reviewer with an overwhelming ego (a reviewer should 
be anonymous). 
</P>
<P>
To top it off, in her Oct. 14 review of Lunaria, her friends ask her to cook 
for them at home next time, implying that the reviewer herself is a much better 
chef than the one she is reviewing. 
</P>
<P>
When is your real restaurant critic returning from sabbatical?

<P>
Not all children have a morbid interest in the obscene -- in fact, I have found 
the ones who have just such an obsession are children from homes where 
censorship ranks No. 1 on the list of "values" to be learned. 
</P>
<P>
Values, respect for oneself and others, religious and political preferences, 
begin at home. (And not necessarily just a good Christian home.)

CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can someone tell me why the TV channels that show movies right before the news 
are obsessed with showing a head shot of the newscaster (we all know what he or 
she looks like anyway) while giving teasers of the news to be presented? 
</P>
<P>
When they do this, the cast credits are pulled into an insert so small they are 
unreadable. 
</P>
<P>
Some artsy TV directors even tilt the insert. (Audio direction for 
embellishment on Calendar's letters page: Readers point your forefinger upward 
and move it in a circular motion. Now all together shout, "Whoopee!") 
</P>
<P>
By the time the self-indulgent little dance is over and the credits are 
returned to full screen, we don't know who the actors and actresses were but 
we're on top of who the construction foreman, head carpenter, assistant 
hairdresser and wrangler were. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose the purpose for the whole charade is to hold the audience for the 
upcoming news. It doesn't hold me -- in fact I select another channel to watch 
my news because of these senseless promotion antics.

DEPLORING WENDY WASSERSTEIN'S 'HEARTLESS STEREOTYPES' OF WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some comments about Wendy Wasserstein, the subject of Barbara Isenberg's Oct. 7 
article, and Wasserstein's play, "The Heidi Chronicles": 
</P>
<P>
I too am a sad person, serious and, yes, even sexy. I am also female, and I too 
go to a gym. 
</P>
<P>
(A story about a gym is an important part of Wasserstein's play.) 
</P>
<P>
When I stand in the locker room after a workout, naked and sweaty and, yes, 
tired, I don't see "types" around me. I don't see tight jeans and power suits 
and super women, all my adversaries. I see other women just like me, naked, 
physical "flaws" for the others to see, insecure, vibrant, also tired, and all 
going through their day-to-day live trying desperately to remain hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
How can I feel stranded when they are all reflections of myself? Yes, even the 
27-year-old, single professional women that Wasserstein so heartlessly 
stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
And another thing. I have close friends who are "power" women in the 
entertainment industry. I have eaten lunch with them. Not once have I been 
dismissed or ignored the way Susan dismisses and ignores Heidi when Heidi is 
obviously in turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the friendships I have with women are just as compassionate, just as 
nurturing, just as passionate, as the friendships I have with men. 
</P>
<P>
Why must the healthiest friendships in a play written by a woman about a 
woman's odyssey be those between a man and a woman? Why must Heidi's only 
consistent and long-term female friend abandon her over lunch? And why must 
Peter and Scoop get the best hugs?

PRAYER BOOKS -- THE FIRST AFFORDABLE ART FOR THE 13TH-CENTURY MIDDLE CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until the late Middle Ages, art in Europe was something that belonged to the 
rich and powerful. Royalty, high-ranking church officials and estate owners 
were the only ones who could afford to commission the spectacular paintings and 
reliefs now associated with that time. 
</P>
<P>
But sometime about the 13th Century, middle-class people in great numbers 
started to bring what is now considered high art into their homes. Only they 
didn't call them works of art; they were prayer books. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first affordable art," said Jennifer Haley, curator of the 
"Illuminated Devotional Manuscripts" exhibition that opened last week at the J. 
Paul Getty Museum in Malibu. The exhibit of 20 prayer books handmade for home 
or monastery use will continue through the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The books are spectacularly decorated with vividly colored designs and graphic 
illustrations of biblical or moral tales. 
</P>
<P>
"The books were made and bought for religious purposes," Haley said, "but they 
broadened people's lives in a lot of ways. You could even say that they were 
sort of status symbols." 
</P>
<P>
The earliest book in the exhibition is a 12th-Century monk's text, called a 
breviary, from the Benedictine monastery in Monte Cassino, Italy. The 
calligraphy in the book, done by a scribe named Sigenulfus, is an artistic 
accomplishment in itself. But the chief artistic attraction of this volume that 
was a precursor to home prayer books is its fancifully decorated letters of the 
alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
As displayed at the museum, the book is opened to a frenzied, fanciful 
depiction of the letter C adorned with hordes of real and imagined animals and 
masses of interlaced vines. It is what a future generation would call 
psychedelic. 
</P>
<P>
"It is kind of wild," said Thomas Kren, curator of manuscripts at the Getty 
Museum. "Unfortunately, we have no idea who the artist was. Most of the art in 
the books was not signed." 
</P>
<P>
The breviary, like most of the books in the exhibit, was part of a manuscript 
collection begun in the late 1950s by a German couple, Peter and Irene Ludwig. 
Their collection, which was bought by the Getty Museum in 1983, was assembled 
with the aid of a famed New York rare-bookseller, H.P. Kraus. 
</P>
<P>
In his autobiography, Kraus wrote that finding the breviary was one of the 
crowning achievements of his career. He first saw it in 1962, when it was 
offered to him by a secretive Swiss book dealer, and he would have bought it on 
the spot had he not feared that the spectacular book had been recently stolen 
from its monastery home. 
</P>
<P>
Kraus traveled to the monastery in Monte Cassino to make inquiries. There, a 
kindly librarian told him what he prayed he would hear. The book, Kraus was 
told, had been missing from the monastery collection for more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
"A pity, I said, but the tears welling up in my eyes were for joy," Kraus wrote 
in his book. "Had it been missing that long, it was no longer the monastery's 
property under law and nothing stood in the way of its sale. I could buy it 
without fear." 
</P>
<P>
Kraus, who died in 1988, bought the breviary for $30,000, a fraction of its 
real value. Kren declined to put an exact value on the book's worth today, but 
said that at auction it would be likely to fetch a seven-figure price. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest books in the exhibition that were made for home use are Psalters 
from the 13th Century. The illustrations in these books of Psalms were often in 
the form of a series of panels used to tell stories from the life of Christ or 
other biblical sagas. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't love the idea of comparing them to comic books, but they do tell 
stories in somewhat the same way," Kren said. 
</P>
<P>
The books for the home market that really caught on, the Middle Ages gave way 
to the Renaissance, were known as Books of Hours. They served as guides to 
daily worship at prescribed times of day. "We found records that showed these 
books were very popular," said Haley, who worked as an intern earlier this year 
at the Getty Museum. She is now back in Princeton, N.J., where she is writing 
her doctoral thesis on 15th-Century manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
"They were especially popular with women who sought to emulate princesses and 
duchesses who were known to own several prayer books," she said. 
</P>
<P>
These Books of Hours were prohibitively expensive if done by known artists of 
the time. One example in the exhibition is a spectacular book illuminated by 
Flemish artist Simon Benning in about 1530. It was commissioned by Cardinal 
Albrecht of Brandenburg (who went down in religious history as the church 
figure Martin Luther rebelled against). 
</P>
<P>
Lower-priced Books of Hours, of which there are several in the exhibition, were 
still a bit on the expensive side for the average, middle-class citizen, but 
they were within grasp. "A book like this was a special purchase," Haley said. 
"It was the kind of thing, like a car, that you would not just go out and buy. 
It was a major investment, and you'd think about it a long time before buying." 
</P>
<P>
Although the books were used for religious devotions, their owners probably 
flirted at least a bit with the sin of pride. "They were not only objects of 
use, they were also something people liked to show off," Haley said. "It was 
kind of like people with high-priced books thinking of themselves as Cadillac 
owners." 
</P>
<P>
Johann Gutenberg and his printing press made hand-lettered and illustrated 
prayer books obsolete. Printed books were, of course, vastly less expensive and 
could be distributed far more widely. But they did lose their individuality. 
</P>
<P>
"By the late 16th Century," said Kren, gesturing toward the books in the 
exhibition, "this art form was finished." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 The "Illuminated Devotional Manuscripts" exhibit will continue through Dec. 30 
at the J. Paul Getty Museum, 17985 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu. Admission to 
the museum is free, but advance parking reservations are required. For 
information, call (213) 459-7611.

WASHINGTON'S WOES DON'T FAZE PEANUT FARMERS; 
</P>
<P>
RECESSION: PROLONGED DROUGHT HAS DRIVEN MUCH OF RURAL GEORGIA TO ITS KNEES. BUT 
FAR-OFF ECONOMIC CRISES MAKE FEDERAL AID UNLIKELY. 
</P>

VIENNA, Ga. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the peanut farmers standing around outside Noble's Cotton Gin and Peanut 
Buying Point on a sultry fall evening, the prospect of a nationwide recession 
is so far removed from their troubles that it does not even register. 
</P>
<P>
Their own economy has been nuked. Drought has destroyed two-thirds of this 
year's crop. 
</P>
<P>
The distant sounds of saber-rattling in far-off Saudi Arabia and budget debates 
in the alien chambers of Washington just make these farmers angry because they 
cannot get attention when they need it most. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's approach to federal budget problems does not wow any of these 
practical farm boys. It reminds them of Aesop's fable of the grasshopper who 
ate as if summer would go on forever and the ant who methodically stored up 
food for the winter. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Coley, whose 500 acres of peanuts shriveled, offered another analogy: 
"Rome is burning, and they're just fiddlin'." 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the problems of Georgia peanut farmers reflect the unseen 
economic duress of the 1980s, little islands of despair amid the boom and 
glitter. These people have been hurting for more than a decade and are least 
able to absorb a national bust. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia's farm belt is thick with little towns such as Vienna (pronounced 
VY-enna), and they were in trouble long before this year's drought. Vienna, 
population 3,000 and shrinking, once had four tractor dealerships. Now it has 
one. 
</P>
<P>
To see the future, all Vienna has to do is look 13 miles up the road to 
Pinehurst, once a thriving small town now reduced to a single store at an 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
"The small towns like Pinehurst are already gone," said Hobby Stripling, a 
local businessman who was Vienna's mayor from 1967 until three years ago. "The 
places at risk now are towns like this one. If we don't get some help, we're 
going to be the next to hear the death call." 
</P>
<P>
Vienna, about 105 miles southeast of Atlanta, is the seat of Dooly County and 
usually ranks first in Georgia cotton production and third in peanuts. It also 
has a small textile factory that turns out work clothing, a Georgia Pacific 
plant that produces particle board and two motels to cater to the declining 
tourist traffic off of the interstate. 
</P>
<P>
But mostly, as farming goes, so goes Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
The long, scorching summers began in 1977, and theories about depletion of the 
atmospheric ozone layer have become a favorite topic here. Wesley White 
remembers just two intervening years in which drought did not damage the 
harvest. This year's string of sizzling 100-degree-plus days made it the worst 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
"This county has got hotter and hotter and hotter. I'd rather take my 
million-dollar farm loan to Las Vegas and put it on the red and the black. The 
odds are about the same," said Jack Wall, who lost his gamble in the fields and 
holds a salaried job as a county extension agent. "At least in Vegas, I'd know 
pretty quick if I was going to win or lose." 
</P>
<P>
The picture could not have been rosier last June, when the crop looked as if it 
would be one of the best in years. Then came a scorching July and a sizzling 
August.

By this time of year, Dooly County's nine cotton gins should be operating 24 
hours a day, with hundreds of wagon loads of peanuts streaming into the 
peanut-buying points every afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, crop losses in Georgia are in the $500-million range and rising. More 
than half the Dooly County peanut crop has been lost. Cotton yields are down 
70%. The other day, only three wagons stopped at Noble's vast peanut warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Gov. Joe Frank Harris recently asked the federal government to 
declare an agricultural disaster in 138 of Georgia's 159 counties so that 
farmers could receive disaster aid. 
</P>
<P>
But federal officials warned that the peanut business would not receive much 
attention while Washington was having trouble keeping its own head above water. 
</P>
<P>
The sinking feeling is that Washington, preoccupied by the budget crisis, 
worries about war and a nationwide recession, has no time for peanut farmers. 
Places like Vienna will have to go it alone. 
</P>
<P>
Going it alone could be lonely indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody likes the warning signs here. Last month, the Georgia Pacific plant 
closed for a week, for the first time in anyone's memory. Gasoline sales are 
down at Hobby Stripling's Zippy Food Mart and Service Station, and the 
automobile is the only way to get around in these parts. It means people are 
not getting around. 
</P>
<P>
"Businesses have been changing hands pretty regular around here," said Ellis 
Davis, the third proprietor of the True Value Hardware Store in the last 12 
years. "One of the motels has changed hands five times. The Chevrolet dealer 
has changed four times." 
</P>
<P>
Davis's sales are off 30% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Our recession is here," he said. "Last year at this time, I had completely 
sold out of sporting goods and shotgun shells. Look at them," he added, 
indicating stock on a shelf. "I've got a 30% carry-over on peanut-plow blades. 
If the price of oil goes to where they're predicting, it will be devastating." 
</P>
<P>
Downtown, the president of the Bank of Dooly, Neil Joiner, is preparing for a 
bad winter. Nearly all the bank's loans are made to farmers buying seed, 
fertilizer and equipment, and the notes are due in November and December when 
the harvest is in.

EL-ALAMEIN VETERANS MEET IN SAD MEMORY 
</P>

EL-ALAMEIN, Egypt 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They were young soldiers, far from home, huddled in desert sands, waiting for 
the night sky to explode. 
</P>
<P>
The last time some of them would ever look at their watches was 9:39 p.m., Oct. 
23, 1942. In one minute the wails of bagpipes would summon the guns of Major 
Gen. Bernard Law Montgomery's 8th Army, the Desert Rats, to the final battle of 
El-Alamein. 
</P>
<P>
Such a bombardment had not been seen since World War I. What followed was one 
of history's great tank battles along Egypt's barren but beautiful northern 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
How many died to turn the tide of German victories, nobody knows. But after 
El-Alamein, it was the Allied forces who marched forward. After El-Alamein, 
Adolf Hitler's dreams of world conquest began to sour. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Barnard, a former deputy prime minister of Australia, served with the 9th 
Australian Division, the Diggers, who took the brunt of Field Marshal Erwin 
Rommel's fury at the end of El-Alamein's final battle. 
</P>
<P>
"Each generation seems to produce another dictator and somebody has to go out 
and stop him," Barnard said. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve hundred Diggers are among the 7,354 men of the combined British 
Commonwealth forces buried at El-Alamein. They proved that Germany's seemingly 
invincible Rommel, the "Desert Fox," and his famous Afrika Korps could be 
beaten. 
</P>
<P>
Six days after the Allied victory on Nov. 4, British Prime Minister Winston 
Churchill gave El-Alamein its place in World War II history: "This is not the 
end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of 
the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Patience would prove him right. The ordeal of Stalingrad was then only 
beginning, American Marines were digging in at Guadalcanal, and D-Day -- the 
beginning of the end -- still was almost two years away. 
</P>
<P>
Historians debate whether El-Alamein was the most crucial battle of the war, 
but none ignores what happened here. 
</P>
<P>
After sweeping through Libya, Axis forces under Rommel sped along the only road 
on northern Egypt's coastline toward Cairo, the Suez Canal and the rich oil 
fields of Persia. They could smell victory. 
</P>
<P>
Allied commander Montgomery had other ideas. He sent escape vehicles to the 
rear and told his troops: "If Alamein is lost, Egypt is lost. If we cannot stay 
at Alamein alive, we will stay there dead." 
</P>
<P>
The cost of winning and losing the battles of El-Alamein, which raged off and 
on from July until November, 1942, was staggering. Dead still lie in unfound 
desert graves, but the number of casualties on both sides has been estimated at 
65,000. The Allies suffered 13,500 dead and wounded. Half the forces of Germany 
and Italy were killed, wounded or captured. 
</P>
<P>
The opposing forces were uneven. Montgomery had 11 divisions, about 210,000 
men. He had 1,200 tanks, more than 1,000 field and medium guns, adequate fuel 
and ammunition and a short line of communications to his home base in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
Rommel commanded four German and eight Italian divisions and some independent 
units. He had no more than 108,000 men and 600 tanks, but plenty of artillery. 
Also, he relied on 5 million mines planted in the 50-mile-wide El-Alamein 
bottleneck between the Mediterranean and the quicksand of the Qattara 
Depression. His fatal flaws were the lack of fuel and a steady supply line. 
</P>
<P>
The battle of El-Alamein should have been a showpiece for tank warfare. It 
wasn't. Tanks broke down -- the tinny Italian version was nicknamed 
"self-propelled coffin" -- and the Qattara to the south prevented brilliant 
maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery lost 600 tanks, about the number Rommel had when the battle began, 
and by Nov. 2 Rommel was fighting with only 30. 
</P>
<P>
In his diary, Rommel lamented the battle: "Rivers of blood were spilled over a 
miserable strip of land which in normal times even the poorest Arab would never 
have bothered about." 
</P>
<P>
Today's El-Alamein is not much better. But its stilled battlefields, a military 
museum and monuments of the famous battles beckon visitors to make the 
four-hour journey from Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
Every year since 1978, individual countries have put aside differences to honor 
the fallen World War II desert fighters of all sides at observances on the 
Sunday nearest the Oct. 23 battle anniversary. The service, attended by 
hundreds of diplomats, veterans and well-wishers, rotates among the 
Commonwealth Cemetery and the German and Italian memorials. 
</P>
<P>
This year's is Oct. 21 at the Italian monument atop a hillside overlooking the 
Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
El-Alamein's newest memorial is a simple but poignant obelisk honoring the 
Australian Diggers. The 20-foot-tall monument of locally quarried limestone and 
Australian granite stands before the Commonwealth Cemetery and its thousands of 
Allied dead. 
</P>
<P>
The monument was dedicated in the spring of 1989, and for the Australians it 
was long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
Barnard, the former deputy prime minister, and Everard Baillieu of Melbourne, a 
gunner severely wounded at El-Alamein, spearheaded the campaign for a monument 
to honor their fallen comrades-in-arms. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such an emotional experience for me to go back to Alamein. It was the 
place we stopped Rommel's advance, forced him to go back, leave North Africa," 
Barnard said by telephone from Melbourne. He has made the pilgrimage four 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"The first visit I made I was looking at the graves of my comrades, the graves 
of my friends. Each time I come I believe more and more that victory was made 
possible because of the efforts of the 9th Division." 
</P>
<P>
Melbourne attorney Frank Minotti, another veteran of the 9th, has written a 
division history. He wrote that until the obelisk, "no one visiting the 
cemetery would find anything to tell them what part the Australians played in 
those famous battles, and in what circumstances those in the cemetery gave 
their lives." 
</P>
<P>
There are guest registers at the memorials for the Commonwealth, German and 
Italian soldiers. Few leave El-Alamein without shedding a tear. 
</P>
<P>
Last July 18, Australian Margaret Gillespie visited the Commonwealth Cemetery. 
"My brother Jim, always remembered by his family," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
David and Myrna McDonell of Brisbane: "May there never be cause for such a sad 
place."

SINGAPOREANS BID FOR RIGHT TO OWN CARS AS CITY IMPOSES LIMITS TO EASE TRAFFIC 
JAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SINGAPORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taxes already make cars more expensive than apartments, and now Singaporeans 
have to bid for the right to own one. 
</P>
<P>
It's all part of a government campaign to restrict private car ownership and 
ease traffic jams in prosperous Singapore, which still is one of the least 
congested major cities in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Because the government determines the number of new vehicles that will be 
allowed on the road, taking delivery is no longer just a matter of picking a 
model and arranging to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who wants a car must bid for a "certificate of entitlement" at the 
monthly auction. For unsuccessful bidders, there is a flourishing black market 
in certificates. 
</P>
<P>
The quota system was introduced in May because such standard remedies as 
one-way streets, special bus lanes and staggered office hours had provided only 
limited relief from traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
Something called Electronic Road Pricing probably will be the next big move to 
make motorists pay. 
</P>
<P>
Government planners expect that by the mid-1990s each vehicle will have 
electronic number plates and a small black box on the undercarriage. Sensors 
will be embedded in street surfaces and car owners will be charged for using 
the roads just as if they were consuming water or electricity. 
</P>
<P>
Each mile will be priced according to the day and hour, with prices increasing 
as the motorist approaches the heart of the city. Bills will be rendered 
monthly. 
</P>
<P>
Weekday access to Singapore's central business district now is restricted 
during rush hours. Buses and cars with at least four occupants are allowed free 
entry, but drivers of trucks, motorcycles and other cars must buy windshield 
stickers. 
</P>
<P>
A 175% tax and other fees drive up the price of a good-quality Japanese sedan 
to between $34,000 and $40,000 U.S. About 80% of the city-state's 2.7 million 
people own government-built housing, paying more than $28,000 for a three-room 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
By last year, 10% of all taxes collected came from duties on gasoline and motor 
vehicles. Critics said the government had both failed in its attempt to 
restrict the number of new cars and profited from that failure at the expense 
of motorists. 
</P>
<P>
A parliamentary investigation reached the conclusion that huge taxes and other 
fees had not worked. During boom times, the report said, no financial hurdles 
are high enough to deny people with money their No. 1 status symbol. 
</P>
<P>
Since the pricing policy didn't work, officials decided to restrict the number 
of new vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Monthly bidding for seven types of certificate lets the public name its own 
surcharge for a new car. They cover small, medium-size, large and luxury cars, 
motorcycles and trucks, plus an open category for any type of vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Bidders pay the equivalent of 27 cents for an application form, only one to a 
customer each month. Successful bidders are notified several weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
In the first auction in May, luxury car certificates went for the equivalent of 
$264 and later cost up to $3,000 on the black market. A bid of $1,511 won the 
right to buy a smaller car and the certificates brought $2,250 on the black 
market. 
</P>
<P>
One recent auction attracted 14,888 bids for a total quota of 4,573 
certificates. 
</P>
<P>
Successful bidders, including many speculators, profit by reselling 
certificates at a premium. The government has resisted urgings that the 
documents be made non-transferable to stop the black market. 
</P>
<P>
The Automobile Assn. estimates speculators will get a windfall of $2.5 million 
in the first year of the quota system, "which will not help build more roads or 
improve other traffic infrastructure. In the end, the motorists are the 
losers." 
</P>
<P>
Minister of State Mah Bow Tan said: "So long as the economy is sound, our land 
limited and our people want to own cars, the quota premiums are likely to go 
up."

UTILITY BILLS CAUSE UPROAR IN NICARAGUA; 
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL AMERICA: RESTRUCTURING THE ECONOMY SENT RATES SKYROCKETING, SHOCKING 
THE PUBLIC AND FOREIGN DIPLOMATS ALIKE.

MANAGUA, Nicaragua 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Nicaragua's new government yanked subsidies for public services, utility 
bills took off and diplomats hit the roof. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of simply refusing to pay, as many Nicaraguans are doing, the 
foreign officials organized a protest and their bills were put on hold pending 
an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We pay the light and water (bills) when they are normal, but not when they are 
exaggerated," said Soviet Embassy press attache Vyacheslav Spassky. 
</P>
<P>
A diplomatic source said the Soviets were stunned by an electric bill in July 
for $4,000. Under the Sandinistas, who were voted out of office in February, 
monthly utility bills rarely exceeded a few hundred dollars. 
</P>
<P>
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's economic restructuring program passed 
the full cost of electric, water, sewer and telephone services to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Central Bank President Francisco Mayorga recently said the government reduced 
its monthly deficit from $28 million in April, when Chamorro took over, to $7 
million in September. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguans, however, have not quickly adapted to the new prices after a decade 
of Sandinista subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
The first effects of the austerity program surfaced in July with food, gas and 
utility price increases that jolted people in a country where wages of less 
than $100 a month are common. 
</P>
<P>
A government official, who asked that her name not be used, said her mother 
received an $800 water bill, based on the official exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
The black-market rate, once well above the official rate, is now only slightly 
better than at the banks. 
</P>
<P>
"This goes beyond ridiculous. It is just incredible, it's astounding, it's, 
it's . . . " the exasperated official said. 
</P>
<P>
With electricity, a typical family bill that was $8 a month is now around $117. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic protest began in September at a dinner when somebody complained 
about soaring utility bills, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Stedman Howard. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, all the 42 accredited foreign missions in Managua confronted the Foreign 
Ministry, which appointed a committee to look into the complaints and told the 
embassies to hold off paying bills until meters and consumption were checked. 
</P>
<P>
Technicians found broken water pipes at the North Korean Embassy that explained 
high water bills there, said ministry spokesman David Silva. 
</P>
<P>
But the Libyans would not let technicians in to check out the water meters, and 
Cuban officials complained that meter readers never got close enough to take a 
reading. 
</P>
<P>
Although Howard declined to say how much the U.S. Embassy was being billed, he 
said his home electric bill went from $200 to $780 in one month. 
</P>
<P>
"That's indicative of the general trend," Howard said.

UTAH'S ORRIN HATCH WINS PRAISE FOR COMPASSION; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATIVES: LONGTIME BACKERS ARE IRKED BY HIS STANCE AGAINST SLASHING 
FUNDING TO THE ARTS, FAVORING CHILD-CARE GRANTS AND INCREASING FUNDS FOR AIDS 
RESEARCH.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As one of the Senate's staunchest conservatives for a dozen years, Orrin Hatch 
might be expected to be among lawmakers campaigning to slash federal grants for 
the arts. 
</P>
<P>
But the Utah Republican who spent two years as a Mormon missionary is taking a 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
He shakes his head glumly at moves to curb funding for the National Endowment 
for the Arts on grounds that some of the money has gone to projects tainted by 
obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is more against obscenity and pornography than I am, but I just don't 
believe that the Congress should impose censorship through the authorization 
process," Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these people, if they had lived in the time of Leonardo da Vinci and 
Michelangelo, the Sistine Chapel would never have been painted," Hatch said of 
lawmakers heading the drive. "They wouldn't allow you to hang a Reubens in the 
Senate." 
</P>
<P>
Hatch is scrupulously polite and soft-spoken, although sometimes an emotional 
side surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
When the Senate debated rights for the disabled in July, Hatch was telling how 
his brother-in-law suffered as a victim of polio. Suddenly, he "just broke 
down." 
</P>
<P>
"I mean I just wept, tears rolling down my cheeks," Hatch recalled. "I was 
embarrassed because I don't like people to know that side of me that much." 
</P>
<P>
From the scourge of the liberals to patron of the arts and other issues irksome 
to conservatives, Hatch's political persona is undergoing a distinct change. 
</P>
<P>
When Hatch arrived in the Senate in 1977, he was immediately accepted as one of 
the fiercest conservatives to prowl the floor. Over the last two years, though, 
he's been at odds with old allies more than once. 
</P>
<P>
Despite conservative opposition, he spearheaded in 1989 a $1.75-billion-a-year 
package of child-care grants. He's campaigned for escalation of the battle 
against AIDS. And he sponsored a Justice Department program aimed at fighting 
"hate crimes" motivated by racial and religious bias. 
</P>
<P>
The hate crimes bill put Hatch on a collision course with Sen. Jesse Helms 
(R-N.C.), who called it "the flagship of the gay rights agenda." 
</P>
<P>
Hatch, 56, scoffs at the notion that he's changed: He remains a supporter of 
capital punishment, a critic of gun control and an opponent of a major civil 
rights bill on Capitol Hill whose minority-hiring provision, he says, would 
inevitably lead to hiring quotas. 
</P>
<P>
All the same, a recent poll showed that many Utah voters believe he is moved in 
a more liberal direction. 
</P>
<P>
And he's finding increasing favor with lawmakers he once fought. 
</P>
<P>
"He is open on some things," said Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.). "He has grown, and 
I hope we can all grow. He was superb on the hate-crimes bill." 
</P>
<P>
Lean at 6-foot-4, with every silvery hair in place and a taste for 
conservatively tailored dark suits and blazers, Hatch likes to tell of his 
humble origins as the son of a Pittsburgh metal lather. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up on the wrong side of the tracks," he said. "We were poor, poor 
people." 
</P>
<P>
He worked as a janitor to help pay his way through Brigham Young University, 
where he met his wife, Elaine. They have three sons, three daughters and 10 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
He graduated from the University of Pittsburgh Law School and practiced in that 
city before returning to Utah. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, he upset incumbent Democratic Sen. Frank Moss, in part with the help 
of hundreds of Hatches in rural Utah, their numbers a legacy of the heavily 
Mormon state's polygamous past. 
</P>
<P>
Moss and other Democrats, however, blamed rough-and-tumble tactics by New Right 
conservatives -- Washington groups whose trademark was mail-order campaigns 
designed to rise funds and energize voters around issues such as abortion and 
school prayer. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, Hatch is a vocal member of the Judiciary Committee where he 
ranks second behind Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.). But his major post is that of 
top Republican on the Labor Committee, where he's often at odds with the 
chairman, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). 
</P>
<P>
But frequently, Hatch and Kennedy reach a compromise, as they did on a Hatch 
bill opposed by some liberals that allows export of pharmaceuticals not yet 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Hatch record on such matters gives business little to complain 
about. 
</P>
<P>
He is a firm backer of bills to rein in court damages in product liability and 
medical malpractice lawsuits -- major goals of the insurance industry. And he's 
sponsoring a bill to allow the federal government to preempt tough state 
standards governing pesticides in foods. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch scoffs at complaints from liberal consumer groups that his bill would 
allow unsafe concentrations of pesticides in foods. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not based on science," he said. "That's based on old wives' tales." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Republicans take little notice of strained ties between Hatch and 
conservative activists. They hail him as hard-working and effective. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a real admirer of Orrin Hatch," said Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.). 
</P>
<P>
"He undertakes the toughest chores in the Senate because he is the ranking 
Republican on the Labor Committee," Danforth said. "The issues he involves 
himself in are often hotly controversial and take up a good deal of the 
Senate's time, but he does his job with unflappable competence." 
</P>
<P>
But such testimonials leave hard-core conservatives unmoved. 
</P>
<P>
"He has separated himself from us . . . on social welfare legislation, on what 
we would call gay rights legislation, on a whole range of issues," said New 
Right pioneer Paul Weyrich. 
</P>
<P>
Weyrich said Hatch has been shopping for issues to help broaden his support and 
hopes for an appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court. Indeed, when Justice 
William J. Brennan Jr. announced his retirement, reporters were quick to corner 
Hatch and ask if he wanted the post. He said no. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch also says he's always been a champion of the underdog and that perhaps 
his conservative critics just haven't noticed. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always been an advocate of those with disabilities, those who are 
downtrodden, who really can't help themselves," he said. "What I have a problem 
with is people who can help themselves but won't." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he says his conservative critics should take a more careful 
look at his overall record. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder who they think took the lead in fighting for a lot of the changes 
around here," he said, his voice rising. "I wonder who they think fought for 
fairness in the Iran-Contra hearings."

A 17-year-old boy was shot to death at a doughnut shop across from North 
Hollywood High School, where more than 100 students had gathered to celebrate 
their football team's victory, police said Saturday. The students' elation 
Friday night over the Huskies' 31-20 victory against the Monroe High School 
Vikings ended in screams and tears when a gang member killed Glen Richard 
Avila, said Sgt. John Stilo of the Los Angeles Police Department's North 
Hollywood Division. 
</P>
<P>
Police were seeking Louis Arturo Velarde on suspicion of murder, Stilo said. 
About 15 minutes after the game ended, the gunman approached Avila in the 
parking lot of the Yum Yum Donuts shop, muttered a slogan and shot him in the 
chest before running away, Stilo said.

DRY LAKE GIVES CLUE TO LIFE ON PREHISTORIC GRASSLANDS

LUBBOCK, Tex. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the natural springs that had fed this West Texas region for millennia 
dried up in the 1930s, Lake Lubbock vanished with them. 
</P>
<P>
But the lake has not been forgotten. Its legacy was in helping to preserve a 
treasure store of artifacts of human and animal life dating back more than 
11,000 years, archeologists say. 
</P>
<P>
The arid, wind-swept plains of West Texas were once rich grasslands that 
supported hairy mammoths, 3-foot-tall armadillos and bears three times the size 
of a grizzly. Lake Lubbock has provided the proof of this past. 
</P>
<P>
A 300-acre site northwest of Lubbock, where the lake once existed, has been 
turned into a state park and also designated a federal historic site. The Lake 
Lubbock Landmark opened this month. 
</P>
<P>
Some archeologists regard it as the premier site of its kind in North America. 
Over the last 50 years, researchers have unearthed evidence that the area has 
been continuously inhabited for more than 11,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The site, basically, is little packages of time stacked one on top of the 
other," said Eileen Johnson, the park's director. "You can study man's entire 
existence in the New World in one spot, instead of having to go to 100 
different sites." 
</P>
<P>
From fossils excavated at the site, researchers have been able to identify 
soils, vegetation, pollen records, wildlife and human cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Among the important finds have been an ancient short-faced bear, a giant 
armadillo and mammoths. 
</P>
<P>
"The giant armadillo was truly Texas-size," Johnson said. "It was 3 feet tall 
and 6 feet long." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have also identified the remains of prehistoric plants, fish, 
amphibians, reptiles and birds, she said. 
</P>
<P>
They have found evidence of human habitation -- projectile points, bone tools, 
manufacturing debris, processing areas, slaughter sites and an oven -- but, 
"the most fantastic thing is that no human remains have ever been found," said 
Robert A. Nash, a longtime supporter and namesake of the landmark's 
interpretive center. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be the find of the century -- if they found a skull of the 
so-called Clovis or Folsom man," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The site includes a museum and a research lab occupied by archeological 
students from Texas Tech University. 
</P>
<P>
After visitors pass through the museum, filled with murals of ancient life, 
photographs and fossils, they are encouraged to walk through the digs. Picnic 
tables and grills are set up for barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
The park is a collaborative effort of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, 
Texas Tech and the City of Lubbock. The state agency leases the property from 
the city and Texas Tech conducts the research. 
</P>
<P>
"We know only 5% of what is out there," Johnson said. "It's awe-inspiring and 
exciting to think we will be uncovering and learning here for years and years 
to come." 
</P>
<P>
John Albanese, a Wyoming-based geologist and independent consultant for 
archeological sites, said the park "is the premier site in terms of the quality 
and quantity of the old material that has been found there." 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the better preserved records of early man in North America," he 
said.

MEXICO'S POOR MAKE PAINT THINNER THEIR VICE

<TEXT>
<P>
A mariachi band was playing for tourists in Garibaldi Plaza when the stink of 
paint thinner began to overpower the fragrance of roses sold by strolling 
vendors. 
</P>
<P>
A thin, disheveled woman stood in the middle of the square with a folded piece 
of cloth in one hand and a plastic bottle of clear liquid in the other. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my only vice," said the 23-year-old prostitute, who gave her name as 
Gloria and swayed as she held the solvent-soaked rag to her face. "This, a 
little wine and my cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
Narcotics abuse has not reached epidemic proportions in Mexico; a national drug 
prevention program and a troubled economy have helped keep the use of hard 
drugs from expanding. 
</P>
<P>
Cheap inhalants like glue, paint thinner and other industrial solvents are 
becoming popular among the lower economic classes and fears are growing that 
Mexico is fertile ground for drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
One reason is the wide variety of illegal drugs available here. Mexico grows 
marijuana and opium poppies, and is a transit point for cocaine and heroin 
bound for the United States from South America. 
</P>
<P>
More than half the 85 million people are under 19 and an estimated 800,000 
enter the glutted job market each year. 
</P>
<P>
"They have no opportunity for employment or school," said Mario Alberto, who 
works at Drug Addicts Anonymous. "There is a great number of people at risk." 
</P>
<P>
The latest National Survey of Addictions found that 4.3% of Mexicans, more than 
half of them under age 34, had experimented with drugs at least once. It was 
conducted in 1988 and released this year by the General Directorate of 
Epidemiology and the Mexican Psychiatric Institute. 
</P>
<P>
It said drug use was significantly more prevalent in northwestern states like 
Baja California, Sonora and Sinaloa that are close to the U.S. border or serve 
as bases for large-scale traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Of the estimated 500,000-plus drug addicts in Mexico, the federal attorney 
general's office says, 300,000 use inhalants, 200,000 use marijuana, 30,000 use 
cocaine and the rest use heroin or opium. 
</P>
<P>
People working in prevention and rehabilitation programs worry about the 
increased use of inhalants. 
</P>
<P>
Money determines the drug of choice in a nation whose minimum wage is 
equivalent to $3.60 a day. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a poor country," said Martha Nelda Morales, assistant director of the 
Adolescent Orientation Center, a health service group. "We are trying to 
satisfy our basic needs, like food, clothing and shelter." 
</P>
<P>
A half pint of paint thinner costs 7 cents and a tube of glue $1.07. It is 
illegal to sell either to anyone under 18, but enforcement is lax. 
</P>
<P>
Street prices for marijuana and cocaine, respectively, are about $1.80 a 
cigarette and $35 a gram. 
</P>
<P>
"They give it away," a 14-year-old user named Jose said of inhalants. He was 
walking in Garibaldi Plaza, a tourist area of curio shops, bars and food stands 
where mariachis play for tips. 
</P>
<P>
Inhalants can cause permanent damage to the brain, liver, lungs and stomach, 
but Jose and other users show little concern about that. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes away my hunger, my sleepiness and my problems," Jose said, gripping a 
tiny container of paint thinner. "I'll stop when I get older." 
</P>
<P>
Some people say a "higher morality" has kept hard drugs from getting a strong 
hold on this overwhelmingly Roman Catholic nation. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept of the family is stronger," Morales said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Raul Zapata Aguilar, medical director for the national Youth Integration 
Centers, said a decision to focus on prevention had made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago, Mexico decided the only way to stem the tide of drug use was 
to stem the demand for drugs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most Mexican drug programs do not use the fear themes popular in the United 
States, such as "Drugs Kill." 
</P>
<P>
Zapata believes the appeal to fear has only a short-term effect: "It's like 
speeding on a highway and seeing an accident," he said. "You will slow down for 
the next five miles, but eventually you will speed up again." 
</P>
<P>
The usual Mexican approach is to de-emphasize drugs and teach adolescents, 
parents and teachers how to achieve a healthy emotional, family and physical 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Advertisements show young people river rafting, for example, with the words 
"Say yes to life" across the top in large letters and "Say no to drugs" in 
smaller print on the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Direct-action programs organize activities such as weight lifting, street 
theater, poetry workshops and sports teams in poorer neighborhoods to keep 
children away from narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
A Roman Catholic priest known as Father Chimchachoma runs Providence House. He 
collects waifs from the street and takes them to one of its 15 homes, where 
they can live until they finish school or learn a trade. 
</P>
<P>
One morning, he told three new arrivals of a diamond left in a muddy field. 
Passers-by ignored the dirty, seemingly worthless object, he said, but someone 
finally picked it up and washed it. 
</P>
<P>
"And what did he find?" the priest asked. 
</P>
<P>
"A diamond!" the boys shouted in unison. 
</P>
<P>
"And what are you?" 
</P>
<P>
"Diamonds!"

A TURNAROUND FOR CONEY ISLAND?; 
</P>
<P>
ATTRACTIONS: OPTIMISTS POINT TO NEW HOUSING, A FALLING CRIME RATE AND A 
GENERATION OF NEW YORKERS WHO NEVER KNEW THE LEGENDARY AMUSEMENT PARK. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The faded and peeling sign standing on a weed-choked median in Brooklyn is a 
sad reminder of times gone by: "Welcome to Coney Island -- America's 
Playground." 
</P>
<P>
Coney Island was the Titanic of amusement parks, a grand assemblage of thrill 
rides, cabarets, food stands and other attractions. Today it's but a seedy 
parody of its former self. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Titanic, there are hopes today that Coney Island can recapture some 
of its lost glory, with one developer proposing to build a theme park on the 
scale of a Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Coney Island's demise began decades ago, when Ike was in the White House and 
the Dodgers were in Ebbets Field. Some blame it on changing times, television 
and back-yard swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
Others blame government planners who brought in high-rise housing projects that 
destroyed the small-town ambience of the seashore community, which is actually 
on a peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
The grimy Stillwell Avenue subway station is the gateway to the amusements. 
Visitors pass a liquor store and cigarette stand, topped by a faded billboard 
featuring a sunburned woman with a '60s flip hairdo. Across the street is a 
fast-food store and a graffiti-splashed U.S. Army recruiting shack, padlocked 
and unused. 
</P>
<P>
But Nathan's Famous, where devotees swear the hot dog was born in 1916, is 
still there. The grills beneath the trademark lemon and green sign sizzle up to 
1,500 Coney red hots an hour. 
</P>
<P>
And the beloved Cyclone roller coaster, with its 3,000 feet of wooden track and 
cars hurtling down 90-foot inclines at speeds of 68 m.p.h., is still rolling 
strong. 
</P>
<P>
It's a designated city landmark. Not so Faber's Sportland -- a dingy video and 
pinball hall -- or the Surf Motel, which caters to the by-the-hour crowd. There 
are numerous stands with Coney Island staples such as cotton candy, french 
fries with vinegar and sticky caramel and candy apples. 
</P>
<P>
T-shirt and toy vendors sit in the shade of their plastic awnings waiting for 
visitors leaving Astroland, the New York Aquarium and the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Coney Island once was about as close to death as a community could get," said 
Horace Bullard, who owns a neighborhood fast-food store and hopes to build the 
Disneyland-type amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
He and others insist that there is a comeback in store for Coney Island, which 
is 25 miles from the heart of Manhattan. It draws thousands of visitors from 
throughout the metropolitan New York region thanks to a network of major 
roadways that feeds into it from surrounding areas. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt about it," said Herb Eisenberg, of Coney Island's community 
board. "The resurgence is starting. We're climbing out of the bad old days." 
</P>
<P>
There is evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Five hundred new single-family homes built since 1985 were snapped up at prices 
that started at $90,000 and have climbed to $140,000. In two years, attendance 
at the New York Aquarium has doubled to 800,000. 
</P>
<P>
"A whole new generation is starting to come out," said Rick Miller, spokesman 
for the New York Aquarium. "They don't know what Coney Island was, or anything 
about its decline." 
</P>
<P>
The turnabout began when the city started spending money -- tens of millions 
over the last decade -- to clean up the 3-mile beach and rebuild 23 blocks of 
the dilapidated boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, I would compare our beach to any beach in the world," said Brooklyn 
Parks Commissioner Julius Spiegel. "The cleanliness and attractiveness of the 
sand is second to none." 
</P>
<P>
Eisenberg, who was born in the area 56 years ago, agrees. "I can tell you, it's 
a lot cleaner today than it was 35, even 40 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, on a hot and sultry day, nary a can or piece of paper was seen on a 
stretch of the 500-foot-deep silvery, sand beach. Instead it was filled with 
striped beach blankets, neon-colored umbrellas -- and families. 
</P>
<P>
With dozens of parks police and a beefed-up local police presence, drug-related 
crime that nearly destroyed the area in the 1970s is ebbing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not deluding myself," Eisenberg said, "there are still problems. But they 
are the same problems every neighborhood in this city is facing." 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, the city and a private foundation began knocking down rows 
of abandoned and burned-out bungalows that housed gangs, drug addicts and the 
homeless throughout the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
They were replaced with affordable single-family homes that attracted young 
middle-class families. Coney Island, once a predominantly Italian and Jewish 
community and later predominantly black and Latino, today is home to a 
potpourri of races. 
</P>
<P>
"Come down to Kaiser Park on the weekend and you'll see blacks, whites, 
yellows, pinks, you name it, all with their grills, all together," said 
Eisenberg. "To me it's an unwritten message that we can live together, we can 
play together." 
</P>
<P>
Play was always what Coney Island was about. It gained notoriety during the 
days of Diamond Jim Brady and Lillian Russell. Gamblers and gangsters, chorus 
girls and call girls came regularly to wine and dine and play under the 
carnival lights of Dreamland, Luna and Steeplechase Parks. 
</P>
<P>
Dreamland burned down in 1911; Luna Park suffered the same fate in '39. Today, 
the New York Aquarium stands where Dreamland once mesmerized crowds. Luna Park, 
known for its popular Shoot the Shoots water ride, is now a co-op housing 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
But until Luna's demise, amusement was king at Coney. 
</P>
<P>
"Al Capone was a bouncer at a local cabaret here; Eddie Cantor was a singing 
waiter who worked for $3 a night, and Cary Grant -- then only Archibald Leach 
-- was a stilt walker for Steeplechase," said Matt Kennedy, an 86-year-old 
George Burns look-alike who runs the local chamber of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Even after Luna Park burned down, Coney Island remained popular, thanks to its 
accessibility by a nickel subway ride, the hair-raising Cyclone and 
Steeplechase owner George C. Tilyou's monument to fun: the glass-enclosed 
Crystal Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Steeplechase also offered mechanical horse races and thrilling drops from the 
Parachute Jump. 
</P>
<P>
Television in the 1950s cut into the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
"On Tuesday night -- Uncle Miltie night (referring to comedian Milton Berle's 
TV show) -- the park was empty," said Milt Berger, a public relations man who 
once worked for Steeplechase and now represents Astroland, Coney Island's only 
multiride park. 
</P>
<P>
And things got worse. 
</P>
<P>
When Steeplechase owner Frank Tilyou died in 1964, the heirs wrangled about 
Steeplechase's operation until, Berger said, "for peace and harmony's sake" 
they sold it. The buyer was developer Fred Trump, father of Donald. "He wanted 
to put up some big seaside condo development," Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
Down came the pavilion of fun, and with it the end of a legend. 
</P>
<P>
But Trump couldn't get the building variance he needed to construct residential 
housing in an area zoned for amusement. The '60s rolled by and Steeplechase sat 
vacant. 
</P>
<P>
The city condemned it in 1969; after a court battle Trump reportedly received 
$4 million for the 12-acre parcel. About the same time, the city condemned 
blocks of red-brick bungalows once used as summer homes. 
</P>
<P>
With the '70s came plans to build public-housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
"The city had this vision that they would round up a lot of low-income people 
from the city and bring them out to Coney Island, to this paradise," said 
developer Bullard, "and that once here all of their problems would be over 
because they'd be in paradise." 
</P>
<P>
Tall, boxy buildings sprang up. Whites fled. Stores closed. The vacation trade 
died, nearly taking the entire community with it. 
</P>
<P>
When the urban renewal projects began, Mermaid Avenue was a thriving business 
center with more than 400 retail stores. Today, there are 39. 
</P>
<P>
Coney Island, says Ann Weisbrod, vice president of the city's Public 
Development Corp., was "the victim of government good intentions." 
</P>
<P>
Now the city has a new slate of plans to revive Coney Island, among them 
Bullard's proposed $350-million Steeplechase Park and a 14,000-seat Sportsplex 
to be used for college and high school events. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed new Steeplechase, covering 25 acres, would be a three-tier park 
with 65 major attractions, 14 theaters and a $3-million renovated version of 
the Parachute Jump. 
</P>
<P>
There are also plans to renovate the subway stop, repave local streets, rebuild 
bridges leading onto Coney Island and turn Stillwell Avenue into a pedestrian 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
The city has committed $20 million to the project. "That's just about enough to 
build the parking garage," said Bullard. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, Steeplechase could open in 1993. If approved, the Sportsplex 
project, which is still in the development stage, could be operating by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll never be able to recapture the glory days of old Coney Island," said 
state Sen. Marty Solomon, who represents the area. "But these projects are 
giving an awful lot of hope to an area that hasn't had any for a long, long 
time."

HOMEOWNERS NEAR AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's been so much discussion of late about changing the airport name back to 
Orange County Airport that I would like to offer another idea. I think the 
airport should be named after someone who typifies Orange County, someone who 
symbolizes the county's greed and devotion to the haves taking it all from the 
have-nots. 
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, I would like to suggest that the airport be named the Donald 
Bren Airport.

A BLUEPRINT FOR TRAFFIC IMPROVEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
* WITH MEASURE M, COUNTY VOTERS KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THEIR MONEY IS GOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Transportation Commission Chairman Dana W. Reed quite accurately describes 
Measure M, the proposed half-cent sales tax for transportation improvements in 
Orange County, as "practically a contract with the voters." 
</P>
<P>
What this means is that voters will get more from Measure M than mere promises 
of improvement. They will get a specific blueprint for where their dollars will 
go. In these tight budgetary times, that's important. Voters understandably are 
wary of issuing blank checks. 
</P>
<P>
With Measure M, they know exactly what their money will buy; indeed, they quite 
literally can drive around the county now and see places where their choice to 
approve the measure will pay off in the better flow and management of traffic. 
Or they can let their fingers do the walking through the Orange County sample 
ballot and voter information pamphlet, which has a precise rundown, with maps, 
of all the $3.1 billion worth of transportation benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.3 billion in freeway projects will affect the movements of every person 
who drives in Orange County at some point in his or her week. There is also 
$350 million worth of regional street and road projects, which include a 
220-mile network of arterial streets slated for improvement. Under this 
program, regional interchanges will be improved, as will intersections and 
signal coordination. 
</P>
<P>
Local street and road projects, including projects for maintenance and 
improvement, are scheduled to receive $650 million. $775 million is earmarked 
for various transit projects. And passage of Measure M will have the secondary 
benefit of bringing in state gas tax and rail bond funds to match local 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows for sure what these benefits will cost average residents; it 
obviously will depend on what they spend in retail sales. But Reed's estimate 
is a modest $60 a year for a family of three that has an annual income of 
between $55,000 and $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
That's not too much for unclogging Orange County and getting it moving again. 
Vote "Yes" on Measure M.

MEASURES THAT TARGET THE USE OF LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re the "Yes on Measure C, No on Measure D" editorial (Oct. 14): This initiative 
is not going to "save the beaches or parks" but is directed specifically to 
thwart the construction of a sorely needed Par 3 golf course on about 100 acres 
of abandoned oil fields and mushroom farms located directly south of Central 
Park. This "self-supporting" course would serve some 400 golfers a day -- most 
of them senior citizens -- not counting the benefits of extending the green 
belt in the area. 
</P>
<P>
What the chief architects of initiative C do not tell you is that they are 
residents in an affluent equestrian subdivision south of Ellis Avenue, and the 
area in question is used as their own private riding trail at no cost to them. 
Further, if you counted three or four at any one time riding there, you would 
count a lot. I am not talking about the established horse-riding corral in the 
area, which poses no problem.

KEEPING SCHOOLS OUT OF THE LINE OF FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am a retired elementary school principal from Illinois. While visiting 
California recently, I learned that the certain school board members in the 
Fountain Valley district are being challenged due to school closures. At first, 
I shrugged, thinking "that's politics." 
</P>
<P>
But -- and this is a big but -- part way through the article the issue of 
"electromagnetic field" was mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
There is a comprehensive article in the July 9 New Yorker magazine that 
discusses an abnormal amount of cancerous tumors, leukemia, birth defects, etc. 
experienced by individuals living near or attending school under the 
cross-country wires. The article singled out La Jolla and Santa Barbara, in 
addition to Fountain Valley and Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
How do teachers feel about teaching in schools located under the 
electromagnetic field? Apparently the parents in Fountain Valley are upset 
because a school in a safe zone was closed rather than a (perhaps newer) school 
located under the wires. Was this decision made by the administration or the 
school board? 
</P>
<P>
Forget the daily radiation danger attributed to the electromagnetic fields for 
the moment. In the event of war, the enemy's first target is the power supply. 
Without power, America is virtually crippled. Can you envision high-tension 
wires raining exploding fireballs onto the playground while innocent children 
are at play? Although the bomb may have been dropped miles away to hit a power 
station, live flames could hopscotch along the wires, raining flames that look 
like fireworks and fall like snowflakes from the skies onto the playground. The 
enemy would not deliberately bomb a schoolyard of no military value, but who 
would expect a school to be built under the electricity? 
</P>
<P>
Would I have liked to be the principal at a school located under the 
electromagnetic fields? I answer this question with another question: "Would 
you?"

TWO VOTES AGAINST MEASURE M 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After you pay your taxes, if you have any money left for such luxuries as food, 
the government has plans for that money. 
</P>
<P>
The voters approved raising state gasoline taxes by 9 cents per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
The President saw that we like to pay more gasoline taxes so he plans to add 
another 12-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
With gasoline taxes going up to a total of 39 cents per gallon, plus sales tax, 
the voters will surely think that is enough tax to pay on one item, so they 
will have the opportunity to raise Orange County sales taxes in November. The 
county supervisors appear to think we will eventually give in and impose this 
tax on ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
This tax increase would fund more restricted lanes and rail systems that would 
be impractical for most of us to use but we might hope that others would use 
them so as to leave the freeways for us. Some of the revenue would probably go 
for toll roads in case we have money left after taxes to pay tolls. There might 
even be a little left for actual transportation needs. 
</P>
<P>
The rail systems would be particularly beneficial toward our disposing of any 
money we might have left as they will require future taxes to subsidize 
operating expenses. Of course, any other money left can be used to pay off the 
bonds the voters keep approving. 
</P>
<P>
If you are wealthy enough to be able to afford Measure M, you might have a 
heart for the low- and middle-income people.

SCHOOLCHILDREN VICTIMIZED AS STATE FEEDS OFF COUNTY FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: BUDGET PROCESS LETS LAWS SLIP INTO EXISTENCE WITHOUT PROPER PUBLIC 
HEARINGS BUT WITH WIDESPREAD EFFECTS THAT ONLY A FEW REALIZED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN DiMARCO, Maureen DiMarco is president of the California School 
Boards Assn. and president of the Garden Grove Unified School District Board of 
Education. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The added financial problem that school districts in Orange County, as well as 
others throughout the state, now face goes back to the closing hours of the 
last legislative session. The rhetoric in the Assembly chamber in the final 
hours of the state budget debate was angry, frustrated, personal and very 
partisan. Public policy implications were for the most part lost, and the 
budget package was clearly a "get me through the night" document that few 
expect to hold up longer than six months. 
</P>
<P>
Yet one statement made by Phil Isenberg (D-Sacramento), during the most 
rancorous exchanges, stood out as the best description of this budget and its 
disastrous effects on local government. Isenberg was addressing his Republican 
colleagues across the aisle when he said: "Face it, the 1980s are over. Your 
slogans don't work anymore, and neither do ours." 
</P>
<P>
Those slogans, used on both sides of the aisle, have resulted in state budget 
gimmickry that makes a mockery out of funding local government and basic human 
services. 
</P>
<P>
As a prime example of how badly the budget process has broken down, consider 
the passage of Senate Bill 2557 (Sen. Ken Maddy, R-Fresno). This new law pits 
underfunded county services against underfunded school services by authorizing 
county government to charge school districts for the collection of property 
taxes in lieu of the state fully funding state mandated services administered 
by counties. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, the state has forced county government to put its hand into the 
school pocket if it is to have any semblance of a balanced budget. 
</P>
<P>
As the weeks went on beyond the constitutional deadline for the Legislature to 
complete the state budget, the battle centered upon attempts to suspend the 
funding provisions for schools under Proposition 98, the 1988 constitutional 
amendment guaranteeing a minimum base level of funding for education. 
</P>
<P>
When at last it became apparent that there were insufficient votes to balance 
the budget on the backs of our schoolchildren, the leadership of the Assembly 
and Senate and the governor stopped posturing and got down to dealing. 
</P>
<P>
Out of their closed-door meetings, an agreement was finally reached. But the 
leadership package of revenues and program cuts required numerous pieces of 
legislation to be enacted. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours, language was developed, bills were amended, analyses were written 
and the vote was taken. Buried in that package of bills that had been gutted, 
rewritten and never subject to public hearing was SB 2557. 
</P>
<P>
The analysis of the bill (which is all that even the speediest of readers could 
have read in the crush of those last moments) mentioned nothing about public 
schools. In fact, one floor analysis's only reference to the property tax 
collection fee was "and makes various allowances and requirements for counties 
to recover costs." The major description of SB 2557 referenced an authorization 
for counties to charge booking fees to other local jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
Most legislators could not know the full impact of SB 2557 on schools as they 
were acting in haste upon inaccurate information provided by the leaders who 
concocted the deal. But it was clear to the governor and to the legislative 
leadership what they were doing. While slashing support for California's 58 
counties to below the bone and taking that money for their own budget 
priorities, they were purposely making up the difference by forcing counties to 
take more than $100 million from schools statewide. 
</P>
<P>
The schools can ill afford this back-door thievery. 
</P>
<P>
While the Proposition 98 guarantee generated a 4.76% cost-of-living adjustment 
for education, the governor unilaterally hacked that amount down to 3%. When 
compared to the 5.2% cost-of-living adjustment needed just to stay even with 
prior year costs, schools suffered a 2.2% loss in the budget appropriations. 
The property tax collection fees further reduce the money for education locally 
by an additional 1.25% to 1.50%, leaving schools with about a 1.5% increase to 
stretch against 5.2% in costs. And that is without a pay raise for anyone. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, these fees mean real reductions of dollars to school budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Ranging from $11 to $46 per student, the total reduction in education funding 
in the county for our K-12 districts amounts to more than $7 million. As a 
sampling: Garden Grove Unified School District's bill for property tax 
collection fees will exceed $400,000; Santa Ana Unified School District will 
pay $560,000; Capistrano Unified School District will need to pony up more than 
$680,000 and Newport-Mesa Unified School District will be hit with a tab of 
more than $670,000. With an approximate average cost of $50,000 to operate one 
classroom for one year, the $7 million translates into 140 classrooms -- or the 
cost of educating 4,200 students. 
</P>
<P>
Worse than the monetary bottom lines for both counties and schools is the 
incredible and unsound budget precedent set by the state. Without public review 
of any kind, the state took money from one local government entity in order to 
avoid dealing with its own conspicuous consumption, yet it left in place the 
state mandates to provide the services that those dollars were meant to fund. 
</P>
<P>
While the state fed off of the county funds, they told counties not to worry as 
counties were now authorized to feed off of school budgets in order to recover 
the money the state failed to supply. The problem for schools is that they are 
the end of the food chain. The ones who are fed off of ultimately are the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
It is interesting to note that counties also collect property taxes for the 
state, yet no one authorized the counties to collect fees from the state for 
performing the same service that is now chargeable to school districts. 
</P>
<P>
As budget crises continue throughout the year, it will be important for the 
public to know that schools are not to blame and counties are not to blame. In 
fact, this is not even an issue between schools and counties, though some will 
characterize it as such. 
</P>
<P>
The blame for the feeding frenzy on local government budgets falls squarely on 
the Legislature and its fondness for passing laws without providing the needed 
resources. When counties and schools line up in bankruptcy court, which they 
are starting to do, the line will really begin and end on the steps of the 
Capitol. Until the slogans end and the policy discussions begin, California 
will continue to have a fatally flawed budget process that fails to address the 
real service needs of our state.

RANDY KRAFT ITEM A WASTE OF SPACE, TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am very disappointed that you think I would be interested in what Randy Kraft 
does while on Death Row (Newswatch, Oct. 16). 
</P>
<P>
Why you would take up valuable space to report on something so insignificant 
boggles my mind when there are so many worthwhile subjects that need publicity 
and are not getting it. 
</P>
<P>
For example, how about reporting on the needs of the handicapped, the fact that 
baby food and diapers are needed at the Tustin Air Station, or the items 
requested by our servicemen serving our country in Saudi Arabia. I want to know 
about these things -- not about a killer playing bridge. What good does it do 
society to know it?

WHEN A CHILD HAS 3 'PARENTS,' WHEN DOES THE CONTRACT END AND REARING BEGIN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the matter of the surrogacy case now in the process of being decided, it 
seems to me a very basic question has not been addressed: For what purpose did 
Mark and Crispina Calvert go to such extraordinary lengths to have a child? The 
answer seems obvious: They truly wanted it to love, nurture to adulthood and 
provide a loving environment. 
</P>
<P>
That same basic question must be asked of Ms. Anna L. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
She already has one child of her own. At any time she could have one or more 
children if she so chooses. 
</P>
<P>
Then why would she go into a surrogacy agreement? She had already experienced 
carrying a child for nine months and giving birth. She knew what kinds of ties 
this experience brings. The only possible answer to her motivation then seems 
to be the money she would receive. 
</P>
<P>
A child is entitled to a life with parents who sincerely want offspring, not 
for any monetary gain, but simply for experiencing the joys (and also the 
awesome responsibilities) of parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
If Ms. Johnson receives the agreed amount of money to which the contract 
entitles her, then she has no further claim on the Calverts.

BUSTER DOUGLAS HAS BECOME MAIN COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don King once called James (Buster) Douglas a hot-dog-and-beer fighter. 
</P>
<P>
When Douglas fought, often before the main event, people went for hot dogs and 
beer, the promoter contended in recounting how it was he who built the fighter 
into a star. 
</P>
<P>
While Douglas bristled at King's characterization, he did say, "I was always 
the one on all the major undercards. I wasn't the one they looked at. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd have Joe Blow or somebody . . . I was the one nobody considered. They 
knew of me, but they really didn't think I had what it took to be champion . . 
. they didn't know they were moving right past the man who was going to do it 
all, who was going to shock the world." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas often was criticized as being a reluctant warrior and sometimes for 
being downright dull. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 11 at Tokyo, Douglas figuratively smeared mustard on King's shirt and 
dumped suds on his head, leaving the flamboyant promoter sputtering and dazed. 
</P>
<P>
Buster Douglas knocked out Mike Tyson in the 10th round and won the undisputed 
heavyweight championship, then James Douglas went home to Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely feel at home in Columbus,," Douglas said. "I feel I'm James, not 
Buster, the fighter. Being either one, I'm comfortable at. I'm more comfortable 
as James because that's the every day guy." 
</P>
<P>
He does, however, enjoy the celebrity of being Buster. 
</P>
<P>
"All I ever wanted to be was the best," said the 30-year-old Douglas, who has 
been fighting professionally since 1981 and who has a 30-4-1 record, with 20 
knockouts. "Now that I am the best, it's new, it's exciting, it's unreal. Every 
time I go to a hotel now I'm on the top floor. Before, it was, 'Let me try to 
find you a room."' 
</P>
<P>
The toast of Columbus could become the toast of Las Vegas Thursday night when 
he defends the title against unbeaten Evander Holyfield, the No. 1 contender. 
And, typical of his career, Douglas goes into the fight as an underdog 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas was soggy toast of any town when he fought Tony Tucker for the vacated 
International Boxing Federation title May 30, 1987, at Las Vegas. Even with a 
piece of the title at stake, Douglas found himself in a preliminary role. The 
star of that show was Tyson, who stopped Pinklon Thomas to retain the World 
Boxing Association and World Boxing Council titles. Douglas also boxed on the 
undercards of three other Tyson title fights and as a prelim fighter on four 
other heavyweight championship shows. 
</P>
<P>
After after six rounds, Douglas was leading on all three official cards and the 
scheduled 12-round match was even after nine. Tucker won in the 10th when 
Douglas was stopped. It seemed to some observers that Douglas just quit 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas admits to lacking mental toughness in that fight. 
</P>
<P>
"There were things with my dad and I," Douglas said of his relationship with 
his father-trainer, Billy "Dynamite" Douglas, a rugged middleweight- light 
heavyweight of the 1970s. "I wanted to be my own man, I wasn't little Buster 
any more." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas also said his father "wasn't able to jell with other people in camp." 
</P>
<P>
The professional relationship between father and son ended with the Tucker 
fight. The personal relationship also became strained, but the father who was 
not in Tokyo for his son's finest hour is in Las Vegas for his first title 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas began what has become a seven-fight winning streak after losing to 
Tucker and he maintained a high ranking by the IBF, WBA and WBC, but, he said, 
"the problems were building up." 
</P>
<P>
Then his life changed. 
</P>
<P>
"On July 20, 1989, I accepted the Lord into my life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"My training wasn't going well," said Douglas, who on July 21 fought Oliver 
McCall in a preliminary to Tyson's first-round knockout of Carl Williams at 
Atlantic City, N.J. "My wife and I had been at odds. I really didn't want to 
fight. I told John (manager John Johnson), 'I'd like to pull out of this one.' 
John said it would jeopardize my chances for a title shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lying in bed in a hotel room in a pool of sorrow. I was feeling sorry 
for myself. I was ready to give up." 
</P>
<P>
Some friends from Columbus were in town for the fight, Douglas recalled, and 
"they came to the room and we talked. I found out everybody had problems. We 
joined hands and prayed and read scriptures. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a wonderful experience. When I lie back down, it was a 180-degree 
turnaround." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas won an easy 10-round decision over McCall in an uninteresting bout. 
</P>
<P>
"It (boxing) is a vehicle; it's a drive," Douglas said in reconciling his 
profession with his faith. Pat Day, a top jockey who is a born-again Christian, 
has said he considered giving up race riding, but then decided he must have 
been blessed with his talent for a purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, however, can understand being asked how he reconciles his beliefs with 
boxing, which he took up at age 10. 
</P>
<P>
"The main reason I walked away from boxing when I was 15 was because I didn't 
like the way people perceived me as a fighter -- a brute, non-caring. They 
acted like 'Man, don't hit me.' Man, like I couldn't control myself. It took me 
years to look at it as a sport." 
</P>
<P>
"My life was at a crossroads," remembered Douglas, who attended two colleges on 
basketball scholarships, but who did not get a degree. "In my third year in 
college things weren't going well. I wasn't applying myself, so I went back to 
boxing as a pro at 21." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas says his religious experience enabled him to focus his life, but one 
night in early November at Columbus it got briefly, and dangerously, out of 
focus. 
</P>
<P>
He was supposed to fight underneath Tyson's defense against Donovan "Razor" 
Ruddock Nov. 18 at Edmonton, Alberta, and hoped to use his appearance to 
further his chances for a title shot. Tyson got sick, and the card was 
postponed. 
</P>
<P>
"When I found out that night that the fight was canceled, I went out and had a 
couple of drinks," Douglas said. "I was flying down the highway and got into an 
accident. It was my fault and I got into trouble for that. I just ran off the 
road . . . I was being chased by the police. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to do three days rehab and they suspended my license for three months, I 
believe." 
</P>
<P>
He also continued to believe in himself as a fighter and when the Tyson-Ruddock 
match fell through he suddenly got his chance at the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas certainly needed to take a single-minded approach to his fight against 
Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He and his wife, Bertha, separated shortly after he fought McCall. "We're 
back together again, and about to have a baby in January," Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The mother of his 12-year-old son, Lamar, was seriously ill. She since has 
had a kidney transplant, Douglas said, and is doing well. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Jan. 18, Douglas' mother, Lulu, died. 
</P>
<P>
"Through all of this I was able to stay focused," Douglas said. "I stayed 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
Before the fight, the general feeling of the boxing fraternity was, well at 
least Buster is going to get $1 million for his beating. That amount far 
outstripped his earnings for his first 34 fights. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas was dominant against Tyson, despite a controversial knockdown in the 
eighth round. Referee Octavio Meyran failed to pick up the timekeepers count, 
instead beginning his count at "one," and the Tyson camp contended he should 
have been awarded a knockout. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas and Johnson charged King with breaching his promotional contract by 
trying to get the result overturned. King contended he was just trying to 
create controversy in order to set up an immediate rematch. It was while 
claiming that he made Douglas into star that King made his remark about the new 
champion having been a hot-dog-and-beer fighter. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the court settlement, King is not involved in Douglas' first 
title defense for which the champion will make about $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Attaining it has been everything I thought it would be and more," Douglas 
said. "Only in America." His audience laughed at hearing the soft utterance of 
the phrase King has boomed at numerous news conferences. The champion smiled. 
</P>
<P>
Buster Douglas is pleased with life. So is James.

HERSCHEL WALKER AND VIKINGS CRASHING AND BURNING TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG LOGAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Expensively attired in a double-breasted gray sports jacket, black slacks, 
white shirt and silk tie, Herschel Walker stood in the middle of the visitors' 
locker room Monday night at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia and tried to make 
sense of his great fall from grace. But his flawless appearance belied the 
confusion he felt inside. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Walker denied he was shaken by the poorest performance of his career, 
but then, he changed his mind. "I did feel shaken," Walker said. "I wasn't 
really stable. That wasn't the Herschel I know." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the career of Herschel Walker -- high school sensation 
from Wrightsville, Ga., Heisman Trophy winner at the University of Georgia, 
U.S. Football League pioneer with the New Jersey Generals after leaving school 
a year early, feature back with America's Team and centerpiece of a blockbuster 
deal that sent him from the Dallas Cowboys to the Minnesota Vikings Oct. 12, 
1989 -- he had been benched. 
</P>
<P>
Walker carried three times for three yards, caught two passes for 25 yards, 
lost two fumbles, was ruled down before a third apparent fumble and seemed to 
be playing in a fog before Coach Jerry Burns replaced him on offense in the 
third quarter with Allen Rice, which is like pulling Lou Gehrig to put in Wally 
Pipp. Walker's humiliation and embarrassment were shared by all the Vikings 
after they blew a nine-point fourth-quarter lead in a 32-24 loss to the 
Philadelphia Eagles that left them reeling with a 1-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
Fair or not, the focus was on Walker and the deal that was supposed to 
transform the Vikings into Super Bowl champions but has sent them in the other 
direction. The Vikings are 8-10 since the trade and wondering why, but no one 
is more confused than Walker. 
</P>
<P>
He denied being a victim of mental burnout, yet, he spoke of the need to 
"re-energize, settle down, get myself together and relax." He blamed all the 
fumbles on his failure to maintain concentration. "I've got to start fresh from 
the beginning," Walker said. "It's almost like I've got to re-train myself." A 
moment later, he added, "With my type of physical training and mental training, 
maybe I've overworked myself. I need to slack off and rest a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Walker's conflicting feelings mirror those of his employers. The trade that 
brought Walker to the Vikings was forced on the coaches and players by 
executive vice president and general manager Mike Lynn, who gave up five 
players and seven high draft picks for what he believed was the player who 
could take the Vikings to the Super Bowl. Walker rushed for 148 yards in his 
first game as a Viking and has not been over 100 yards since because the 
coaching staff decided it was best to work him into the Vikings' offense rather 
than rebuild the offense around Walker. 
</P>
<P>
"Herschel has never given our team the chemistry we hoped he would," said Bob 
Hollway, the Vikings' assistant general manager for football. Hollway and the 
offensive coaches have analyzed Walker's play with both the Vikings and Cowboys 
in an effort to boost his production but haven't found the solution. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very definitely a mystery," Hollway said. "The only thing I can say is 
there is a wall for running backs. Maybe he's hit that wall. He did all the 
ball-carrying at Georgia, the USFL and Dallas. Maybe he was close to the limit 
when he came to us." 
</P>
<P>
The idea that Walker is physically spent at the age of 28 doesn't have much 
support around the league. He showed no signs of deterioration last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Walker definitely has to get in the flow and see how his blockers are coming 
off the ball," said one National Football League general manager. "He can't 
carry it six times and catch six passes and produce big plays. I know they 
think they've tried to adjust, but it's still the Vikings' offense." 
</P>
<P>
The impression Walker created with his Monday night effort is that he has given 
up because of the way he has been used by the Vikings. "There's talk he's 
packed it in," the general manager said of Walker. "He doesn't have his heart 
in playing football. I know he's had some shoulder problems, but he's not being 
overused. It's more mental than physical. The guy is used to being on a 
pedestal and being a featured back. He isn't that now, and he may have lost 
interest." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the Vikings' troubles run deeper than just figuring out how to use 
Walker. Injuries to quarterback Wade Wilson and defensive tackle Keith Millard 
have damaged them badly. 
</P>
<P>
Contract problems and charges of racism last season contributed to Lynn's 
decision to send players, coaches and executives to the Pecos River Learning 
Center this past spring in New Mexico for what amounted to group therapy. 
Everyone took part in a series of climbing and high-wire exercises in which 
they were linked together and, thus, dependent on each other for survival. The 
symbol each one took home as a reminder of the experience was a carabiner, a 
safety device used in climbing that resembles a chain link. 
</P>
<P>
Now, though, it's almost as if Walker and the rest of the Vikings, linked by 
their carabiners, are falling together, pulling each other down. 
</P>
<P>
Everything comes back to the Walker trade and Lynn's role in it. 
</P>
<P>
Vikings guard Dave Huffman last week denounced Lynn as a "rat deserting a 
sinking ship" when it was announced Lynn is leaving the Vikings as the result 
of an ownership dispute to head the World League of American Football. There is 
a board meeting scheduled today at which he may be asked to leave immediately. 
Lynn did not return phone calls, but a WLAF source said Lynn is expected to 
begin his World League duties sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
The Walker trade is Lynn's legacy, and all the Vikings can do now is live with 
the consequences. Rick Fenney, who has been paired with Walker in the 
backfield, said, "I don't know what's wrong with the offense. Herschel has 
worked hard, but people expect an awful lot from him. We traded a lot for him. 
He's played well in the past. I'm not going to make a judgment. It's mystifying 
to us why we're having such a bad year." 
</P>
<P>
Walker didn't help matters any by using a day off last week to go to Lake 
Placid, N.Y., to qualify for world competition with the U.S. bobsled team. "I 
don't think the timing of that showed good judgment," Hollway said. "He's 
involved in a lot of different activities. You see some players start to make a 
large salary, and all of a sudden, they throttle back because they've got it 
made. They forget what got them the large salary." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Vikings' troubles, Walker always has refrained from criticizing his 
coaches, but in the aftermath of his benching, it sounded as though he believes 
it's time they take some of the blame for his decline. "They're professional 
coaches, and I go out and do what they tell me to do," Walker said. "Everyone 
else has to judge for themselves. If you have knowledge of the game, you can 
see what I'm doing. Everyone said, 'Herschel is a back who can run the ball.' 
I'm not doing that here. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt I feel more pressure on myself, but I can only do what I'm 
called on to do, whether that's run a (pass) route or be a decoy." 
</P>
<P>
As a benchwarmer, Herschel Walker can't even do that much for a team that 
thought it was one player away from the Super Bowl and now is farther than ever 
from that prize.

TALENTED AND TEMPERAMENTAL, ERIC DICKERSON RETURNS TO COLTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE FREEMAN, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
INDIANAPOLIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The thing Eric Dickerson may do best, besides run the football with unique 
brilliance, is take care of Eric Dickerson. He definitely is a member of the 
Look Out Generation: If you don't look out for yourself, no one will. 
</P>
<P>
The recent debacle with his team, the Indianapolis Colts, demonstrates the 
duality of Dickerson, the most gifted running back in the game today. He seems 
to be a blessing and a curse all wrapped up in a 224-pound frame. But foremost 
is the talent, the unbelievable talent. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Dickerson put on pads for the first time since the bickering began 
with his club during the offseason. It quickly became obvious he has lost 
little -- if anything. The Dickerson trademarks are intact: galloping strides 
and swishing hips combined with omnivision; and uncanny ability to know where a 
defensive player will be before the defender's neurons signal him to go there. 
</P>
<P>
That is only half of Dickerson, the half that is 11 yards shy of O.J. Simpson's 
status as fifth-leading rusher of all time. The other half is, well, weird. 
Unpredictable. It asked to be traded and called his offensive line "terrible." 
Dickerson also said he would never play in Indianapolis again, threatened to 
quit football and refused to take a second physical after flunking his first 
because of a hamstring problem. 
</P>
<P>
The danger -- and Dickerson admits this -- is that half of Dickerson may be 
taking too much away from the football half, at least in the minds of others. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric knows that he is good," Coach Ron Myers said. "Except his attitude is not 
the American way, where you give all the credit to your teammates and be 
humble. That's not Eric's way. And it has cost him dearly in terms of public 
image. He has paid a horrendous price." 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the stuff that I've done probably does alter the way people perceive 
me as a football player," Dickerson said after a recent practice. "But I don't 
care what people think. I never have. I don't play for other people, I play for 
myself. I like football, I love football. Sometimes you hate it just like 
everyone else sometimes hates their job, but I play it because God gave me a 
chance to play. And he made me good at it. Opinions, I don't care much for 
opinions. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I understand that people are mad at me. But they have to understand 
that this is my life. I'm an adult and I choose to live my life the way I want 
to live it. You have to do what's best for you, because no one else is going to 
do it. You have to get it while you can. If you don't, no one else is going to 
give it to you." 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson almost assuredly will be in the Hall of Fame. But in people's minds, 
an asterisk might follow his name. 
</P>
<P>
His problems are temporarily on hold. He will see plenty of playing time this 
week against Denver, an important game for both teams since the Broncos are 2-4 
and the Colts are 2-3. Still, he is living with the repercussions of his 
actions during the offseason in two ways: His contract situation and his 
dealing with the hurt he caused some teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson signed a four-year contract extension that two league sources and 
Dickerson said is worth $11.2 million, slightly higher than previous estimates. 
Dickerson was scheduled to receive $1.45 million this season, but he will lose 
about $600,000 after being placed on the non-football injury list and suspended 
for four weeks for conduct detrimental to the team. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson already received $200,000 from the new deal. His base salary is $2.1 
million in 1991, $2.3 million in 1992, $3 million in 1993 and $3.2 million in 
the final year. There also are $100,000 in reporting and roster bonuses for 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for Dickerson is that none of the money is guaranteed, so the Colts 
are protected if he pulls another Dickerson. Even should he break his leg -- no 
money. Basically, General Manager Jim Irsay is saying, Eric, we think you're 
talented, but we don't trust you. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy with my contract," Dickerson said. The negotiations and feuding with 
management made it "a very tough time for me, but my strong religious beliefs 
helped get me through it all. I think everybody thought I was going to come in 
here a wreck, or out of shape, my mind all messed up. I'm not like that. I know 
what it takes. You have to be a man about it. I was on an island all by myself 
and that was the path I selected. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't lost anything. I feel like I still have it all. Like I tell a lot of 
these guys: Some guys don't need training camp. Most guys need to practice, but 
some of us don't. I don't need to practice. Some of us have God-given talent. I 
have God-given talent. 
</P>
<P>
"I never did not want to play. My thing was, I wanted to be on a winner. If we 
win here, that's great. If I go to Green Bay and we win, it doesn't make a 
difference to me. If it's with an expansion team, I just want to win." 
</P>
<P>
But can the Colts win with him? Since October 1987, when the Colts acquired 
Dickerson in a blockbuster trade with the Los Angeles Rams, he has averaged 
23.1 carries and 95 yards a game. The question is: Can he improve those numbers 
on a team in which some players have expressed their dissatisfaction with him? 
</P>
<P>
Besides calling the offensive line terrible, Dickerson called the team 
terrible. Much has been made of resulting bitterness toward him, but Dickerson 
and other players say there are only about four teammates who can't stand him. 
The problem is, two are starting offensive linemen, Ray Donaldson and Kevin 
Call. Neither would comment on Wednesday, but both have expressed anger about 
Dickerson's comments. 
</P>
<P>
"At this level," said quarterback Jack Trudeau, "you don't have to love 
somebody to play with him. That's how most of the guys feel about it." 
</P>
<P>
Even the quiet Albert Bentley, a cult hero here and one of the most underrated 
running backs in the league, said he was "not really glad" to see Dickerson 
back. Bentley, who has 533 all-purpose yards and four touchdowns, will share 
time with Dickerson. Bentley probably will be used more as an H-back, catching 
passes out of the backfield or from the slot position, while Dickerson probably 
will do most of the running. 
</P>
<P>
Sharing time with Dickerson is fine with Bentley -- as long as it stays that 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like it's not fair sometimes," Bentley said. "But the reality is life 
isn't always fair." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dickerson: "I have four guys on this team I don't get along with. And we 
don't want to have a problem. We don't talk, we don't speak and that's it. Four 
out of 45 isn't much. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to get along. No one has to get along. You can have a whole 
team of guys that don't get along, but when you play on Sunday, that's when you 
get along. There are guys I don't care for and they don't care for me, but on 
Sunday I'm going to fight for them. Now when the game is over, they're not 
going to come to my house and I'm not going to come to their house. And that's 
it. On the field we're teammates, off the field we're nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson fully expects to be booed this week in the Hoosier Dome. "Fans are 
fickle," he said. True, so when he breaks that first long run, fans will forget 
about one half of Eric Dickerson and cheer for the other half.

REDSKINS PREPARE FOR A TASTE OF 'DIRTY WATERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD JUSTICE, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He once knocked out David Archer. He once leveled Jim Everett. And Monday 
night, in full view of a national television audience, Andre Waters twice went 
after the legs of Minnesota Vikings quarterback Rich Gannon. 
</P>
<P>
Who is Andre Waters and why has the NFL suddenly drawn a bull's-eye on his 
back? 
</P>
<P>
Depending on who's doing the talking, he's either a very aggressive player with 
an undeserved reputation or he's the dirtiest player in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, he's a factor this week as the Washington Redskins prepare 
for the Philadelphia Eagles to come to RFK Stadium on Sunday. The Eagles are 
Randall Cunningham and Reggie White and Keith Jackson. ... 
</P>
<P>
And while the Redskins have to prepare for the Pro Bowlers, they'll also spend 
some time on the unpredictable strong safety, Mr. Waters. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't call him 'Dirty Waters' for nothing," Cunningham said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Waters is the guy who knocked the breath out of Washington quarterback Doug 
Williams two years ago and he's the guy who NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue 
said will be investigated for his hits against Gannon on "Monday Night 
Football." He's the guy who spends about half his time warning other players 
what he will do, or hearing players warn him about what they're about to do. 
</P>
<P>
"You want me to talk about who?" Redskins tight end Don Warren said this week. 
"No way." 
</P>
<P>
Several other Redskins, including quarterback Stan Humphries, reacted the same 
way. Coach Joe Gibbs said only, "You have to be prepared. The Eagles come at 
you with everything but the kitchen sink." 
</P>
<P>
One Redskin did talk. Defensive tackle Jumpy Geathers, who may be activated on 
Sunday, points to a couple of long scars around his right knee, and said maybe 
it wasn't Waters so much as the system. 
</P>
<P>
Geathers's 1989 season with the New Orleans Saints ended in Week 15 when a hit 
by Philadelphia guard Mike Schad tore his right knee apart. Geathers said he 
thought his career was over, especially since he'd already undergone 
reconstructive surgery on his left knee two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
When the Saints left him unprotected in the Plan B free-agency system, he said 
he was told: "Don't worry, you won't get any offers." 
</P>
<P>
He was stunned to get about 10 and narrowed his choices to the Redskins and 
49ers, finally picking Washington for its three-year, $1.5 million offer. But 
his recovery has been slow. 
</P>
<P>
On his final play of 1989, Geathers said, he dived for a loose ball and Schad 
dived for him. 
</P>
<P>
"He cheap-shotted me," Geathers said. "There's a lot of guys (on the Eagles) 
that do cheap shots." 
</P>
<P>
Geathers said Schad "was definitely trying to get me out of the game because I 
was having a good game already. He couldn't handle me so he was definitely 
trying to get me out of the game. I was going for the ball. You can't see 
behind your back. I'm going to have a bad knee the rest of my life, but the 
other guy didn't think that way." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about getting revenge if he's activated, Geathers said: "He's on offense 
so he's got an advantage on me. I'm just going to play my game. You start 
holding a grudge and you get out of your game plan. You're not out there to get 
a guy back." 
</P>
<P>
Geathers, asked about Waters, shrugged. "They outlaw steroids -- they ought to 
outlaw guys trying to end somebody's career," he said. "You can't end 
somebody's career just to win the game. (Schad) limited my career in the NFL 
and took money out of my pocket. You've got guys who are really good athletes 
who respect each other and don't try to come down to hurt you, but then you've 
got guys who have no feeling for anybody and they get a name other ways." 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles defend their man and their style of play. Coach Buddy Ryan said he 
watched tapes of the two plays against Gannon and thought the plays looked okay 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a clean deal," he said. "He's had a reputation since I've 
been here of being a dirty ballplayer. He's not. He's a good kid, an aggressive 
kid. He plays the game all the way. He got the reputation in '86 when he'd 
chase people out of bounds. He's cleaned up his act since then. He was killing 
us before." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said that teams preparing for the Eagles had better prepare for 
Waters. "He's a hardcore player," he said. "If you go through there 
lollygagging, he's going to give you a shot. What he does is legal. He goes 100 
percent. He throws his whole body at you." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said Waters and Redskins safety Alvin Walton are similar players. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he and Walton are basically the same style players," he said. "Neither 
one of them are dirty players. They just go in there and try to knock you out. 
They're two tough players. You've got to respect them for their ability. When 
you see them, you better slide and prepare to get hit anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to run out of bounds because you think you're not going to get 
hit, you better get out of bounds faster." 
</P>
<P>
Walton refused to join the debate, saying he had enough to worry about without 
defending himself. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of Waters and late hits isn't new to the Redskins. In the first 
game of 1987 he ran into kicker Jess Atkinson and broke his ankle. In the 
second meeting that season Waters punched Williams in the stomach. Then before 
the two teams played several weeks later, Mark Rypien, by then elevated to the 
starting job, called Waters a cheap-shot artist. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Williams came off the bench to win that game. The subject came up 
again last season when Williams started the second game against the Eagles and 
helped the Redskins to a 10-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"You prepare for them like anyone else," guard Russ Grimm said Sunday when 
asked about Waters and the Eagles. "They've got certain things they do and 
basically you have to be prepared to block everyone in this league. You can't 
prepare for some guy to hit you late, but you're aware of it."

IT HAS BEEN LONG SIX MONTHS FOR TARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's been a long -- very long -- six months since UNLV basketball coach Jerry 
Tarkanian experienced the euphoria of an April full of heady memories. 
</P>
<P>
 -- His Runnin' Rebels were the national champions, beating Duke in a record 
103-73 rout at the Final Four in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tens of thousands of Las Vegans lined downtown's Glitter Gulch and the 
glitzy Strip to welcome home Tarkanian, his family and his players. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Topping off an unforgettable week, Tarkanian gave away a daughter in a 
wedding ceremony attended by Nevada's movers and shakers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And he appeared headed for an amicable, if costly settlement in his 13-year 
battle with the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
The honeymoon ended July 20 when the NCAA, in a bombshell announcement, said 
Tarkanian's Rebels could not defend their national title -- the final 
resolution of a bitter battle dating back to the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
In succeeding weeks, Tarkanian has found himself caught in a power struggle at 
a university and in a community where his name has been magic for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
A change in Athletic Department administrations this summer has left some 
Tarkanian loyalists out in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
And it's left those who know the doleful coach wondering if he will take a 
serious look at pro coaching offers after this season -- despite shunning such 
lucrative offers in the past. He passed up two NBA jobs this summer, friends 
say. 
</P>
<P>
He declines to comment on his future plans, saying he wants to focus on the 
coming season and get his team back in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Some solace came this week when his Rebels began practice for the 1990-91 
season. Tarkanian was back courtside, where he's been most comfortable the past 
35 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to get my head into the season," he said last week, squeezing in 
recruiting trips and dodging flack from the political fallout of the Athletic 
Department changes. "This is the first time I've gone into a season without 
having everything pretty well formulated in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
UNLV opens with an exhibition game against the Soviet National team on national 
TV Nov. 17. The Rebels are the only college team to beat the Soviets three 
years running. 
</P>
<P>
For Tarkanian, the fact the Russians are coming is the first glimmer of good 
news he's had in weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Soviets hit town, UNLV officials will travel to Chicago Oct. 28 for 
a return date with the NCAA Infractions Committee. The committee, which banned 
the Rebels from post season play, agreed to a second meeting to discuss new 
information obtained by UNLV counsel Brad Booke. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian, hoping to convince the committee to change its mind, offered earlier 
this month to sit out the playoffs if the NCAA would allow his Rebels to 
compete. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry loves this team, probably like no team he's ever had," his wife, Lois, 
said Wednesday. "He believes the important thing is what the team achieves this 
year. He believes his job is not that important." 
</P>
<P>
The loyalty is two-way. 
</P>
<P>
All-America forward Larry Johnson and teammate Stacey Augmon passed up possible 
seven-figure contracts with the NBA this summer to return for a shot at a 
repeat title. 
</P>
<P>
When the NCAA announced the playoff ban, all Rebel players had the option of 
transferring to another school. None did. 
</P>
<P>
"That just shows what these kids are all about," Tarkanian said. "Any other 
school you'd have kids jumping ship like crazy." 
</P>
<P>
After he offered to sit out the playoffs, his players issued a statement saying 
they wanted Tarkanian with them, but stopped short of saying they wouldn't play 
without him. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tarkanian is still waiting for the other NCAA shoe to drop. 
</P>
<P>
NCAA investigators have been frequent visitors to the UNLV campus the past 
three years, with their major focus on the recruiting of New York prep star 
Lloyd Daniels. Daniels was arrested in a drug bust and booted from the team by 
Tarkanian before he played for the Rebels. Still, school officials fear his 
case could lead to another penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian's problems with the NCAA date back to the early 1970s when he wrote 
editorials zinging the agency while he was coach at Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian moved to UNLV in 1973 and the NCAA announced an investigation at the 
school six days after he arrived. In 1977 the agency placed the school on 
probation for two years and ordered Tarkanian suspended for two years -- 
something they have not done with any other coach, before or since. 
</P>
<P>
Half the violations cited by the NCAA occurred before Tarkanian arrived at 
UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
The school served the probation but Tarkanian went to court and obtained an 
injunction preventing his suspension, saying he was denied due process. He has 
continued to coach, compiling the best record, percentage wise, among active 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled the agency, 
as a private organization, did not have to provide due process. The same ruling 
said the university did have to provide that right. 
</P>
<P>
The battle cost Tarkanian nearly $400,000 in legal fees and court costs. 
</P>
<P>
And it's taken some of the fight out of the feisty Armenian. 
</P>
<P>
He's often said if he had it to do over, he wouldn't have attacked the NCAA 
because "you just can't beat them."

HE IS DRIVEN TO SUCCEED AS A FORMULA ONE RACER; 
</P>
<P>
AUTO RACING: MATTHIAS NIKOLAKOPULOS IS A SUCCESSFUL ELECTRICAL ENGINEER, BUT 
HIS DREAM IS BECOMING A BIG WHEEL AMONG RACING ELITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Matthias Nikolakopulos, one of the youngest electrical engineers in California, 
is in France this week wrestling with his future behind the wheel of a 
lightning-fast race car. 
</P>
<P>
At 26, he has a bright career ahead of him in his father's engineering firm. 
</P>
<P>
But Matthias, as he is known to friends because his last name is too difficult 
for many to pronounce, wants to be a race car driver, despite pressure from his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a top engineer," Alex Nikolakopulos said. "He demonstrated good 
engineering techniques as a little boy. It would be very difficult for him to 
pursue (a racing career) without a great deal of distress to us." 
</P>
<P>
Matthias, who took his first ride on a minibike when he was 6, has shown 
promise, however, not as a good 'ol boy Richard Petty-type, but as a classy 
Formula One driver. That's why he's back at the world famous Circuit Paul 
Richard race track on the French Riviera today, attempting to become only the 
second American ever to qualify for the championship of the Pilote Elf Series, 
which is run in part by the Winfield School in France. 
</P>
<P>
About 250 drivers, most of them European, pass through Winfield each year. Very 
few, according to Car and Driver Magazine, earn certificates, as Matthias did 
in June, one of only five Americans in a class of 20 to do so. Certificate 
winners qualify for an advanced driving course. They return to France each 
October with the hopes of qualifying to compete in the Pilote Elf Series, 
driving smaller versions of Formula One-type cars. The top driver, winner of 
the Pilote race, receives a full year of sponsorship by Elf Petroleum, a French 
oil company, to race on the Formula Renault circuit, a minor league of the 
Formula One. Twenty-one graduates of Winfield have climbed to Formula One, the 
highest level of racing available in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Currently no Americans are racing Formula One, but Matthias could be soon. His 
performance in the time trials at Winfield in June drew the attention of Car 
and Driver Magazine, which said: "Nikolakopulos looks to be a potential merit 
winner." 
</P>
<P>
Adds John Peterson of Franam Racing, Inc. of Minnesota, who arranges for 
Americans to compete in the Pilote Elf Series: "I've heard good things about 
his performances (at the school). "This is an elite organization, and he 
returns as one of the top two in his class." 
</P>
<P>
Frenchmen have dominated Pilote Elf competition, winning four of five races. In 
recent years, to encourage more participation by Americans, the top Yank 
finisher has received a racing scholarship. This year it includes a trip to a 
top driver seminar in Montreal and a year as a driver on the Barber Saab Pro 
Series of racing in the U.S. In addition, the top American could also win, but 
must finance himself, as the third seat in the Pilot Elf Formula Renault 
series. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, should Matthias make it past the semifinals this weekend, Peterson 
said, "He has a place in racing. There is no doubt in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Formula One is a costly sport which requires many sponsors. Formula cars are 
custom-built, open-wheel race cars costing as much as $50 million apiece. 
</P>
<P>
But the sport can be profitable. Top drivers, often leading lives as colorful 
as the brightly painted road-hugging cars they drive, can earn $12 million a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been many years since America has fielded a competitive effort in the 
Grand Prix scene, and even longer since we've won the world championship," 
Matthias said. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Andretti was the last American to win a world championship 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Matthias would like to be next, but, according to his father, he would be 
better suited with a future in electrical engineering. 
</P>
<P>
Responds Matthias: "I'm there. But my heart is not in it." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't enough just to learn to drive, Matthias said. It becomes a lifestyle. 
Formula One sponsors want a complete person, a man who exhibits a combination 
of coolness and responsibility, yet flare at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to stake my own claim. I want to beat the odds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He is studying the French language and French customs. He also eats French 
foods and is taking Dale Carnagie classes to improve his confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"At 5 years old I already knew that I wasn't going to be one of those kids with 
a baseball bat on my shoulder and a ball in my hand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although shy, at 6 he summoned the courage to ask a teen-ager on his block in 
Palos Verdes Estates if he could ride the teen-ager's minibike in the nearby 
fields. To his surprise, the answer was yes. Matthias was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
He bought a Honda 50 c.c. minibike when he was seven, then three months later 
took it apart and spread the parts over the garage floor. He wanted to learn 
what made it work. 
</P>
<P>
His mother died the following year, leaving Matthias, the youngest of five 
children, a lot of time to himself. 
</P>
<P>
"But instead of fighting (loneliness) I made the best of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He graduated to motorcycles and by the time he was attending Palos Verdes High, 
he was racing them. He loved to fiddle with engines. At 16, he put a Buick V6 
into a Dodge Ram 50 pickup. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't really change what you are," he said. "You have to take whatever you 
have and make the best of what you are." 
</P>
<P>
One day before school his father discovered him awake at 2 a.m., tearing down a 
motorcycle in the garage. Parts were strewn everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still parts in that garage today," Alex Nikolakopulos said. 
</P>
<P>
Schoolwork was easy for Matthias, so he spent most of his time in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I had four hours of sleep a night while I was in high school," 
Matthias said. "Dad really got mad at me that night he found me in the garage, 
but after awhile he couldn't really complain. I was getting good grades and 
doing what I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Mechanical knowledge came easy. Said Brian Springer, a high school shop 
teacher: "He was a gem of a student. Very intelligent. Whenever he wanted to 
get something done, he finished it. There are very few students I remember, but 
Matthias was one of them." 
</P>
<P>
Matthias continued to race motorcycles while attending USC. He moved into 
go-karts after graduation and then, on a trip to Europe in 1986, discovered the 
Formula One circuit. He fell in love with it. 
</P>
<P>
"In the U.S. racing is such a hodgepodge, there is no rhyme or reason to it 
because there are so many levels," Matthias said. "In Europe, Formula One is a 
serious business, requiring a lot of concentration. It is exactly what I dream 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Matthias obtained his electrical engineer's license two years ago. He went to 
work for Dad, but racing boiled in his blood. Two years ago at the Phoenix 
Grand Prix, he snuck into the McLaren Team pits and learned all he could. 
</P>
<P>
The personalized license plate on his flashy 300ZX read "F1 Bound." 
</P>
<P>
"Everything about (racing) is so me," Matthias said. "Other drivers complain 
that when they put the helmet on, they can't hear anything going on around 
them. Not me. I like being isolated. It's like I'm in a think tank." 
</P>
<P>
If Matthias doesn't make it as a race driver, Peterson and others say he has 
the engineering background to design cars. Matthias thinks so, too, although 
his father would prefer he stay closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
"I would rather have him in the office with me," said Alex Nikolakopulos, who 
also employs another son. "I have watched him race when he was doing go-karts 
and I held my heart in my hand each time." 
</P>
<P>
"I know he worries about my safety," Matthias said. "But he knows I have a 
level head on my shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
He is confident. He points to an astrological forecast for his Oct. 9 birthday. 
It predicts that he will "travel in October and could win (a) contest." 
</P>
<P>
During lunch at a fancy French restaurant in Redondo Beach before he left, 
Matthias revealed that the conflict about his future sometimes rages within 
him. Looking all the bit of a high-level electrical engineer with a tie knotted 
firmly around his collar as he ate, he said: "You have to follow your passion, 
your dream, even if you fail. I just want to do it, without breaking a lot of 
hearts along the way."

ORTMAYER WANTS TO FOCUS ONLY ON GAME

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because of developments on the field and in the front office, the AFC West 
rivalry between the Raiders and San Diego Chargers has evolved into something 
especially intense. 
</P>
<P>
Today's game at Jack Murphy Stadium will mark the return to San Diego of Raider 
assistant coach Steve Ortmayer, who served as the Chargers' director of 
football operations for three seasons before being fired Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer, in effect, assembled the Charger team he hopes the Raiders (5-1) will 
disassemble in 60 minutes today. He notes that 39 of the 45 players who 
finished the season on San Diego's 1989 roster were his products. 
</P>
<P>
After being fired, Ortmayer came back to the Raiders and coaxed a few Chargers 
up the freeway with him: wide receiver Jamie Holland, running back Napoleon 
McCallum, tight end Andy Parker, tackle James FitzPatrick, defensive tackle 
Mike Charles and cornerback Elvis Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer won't allow emotion to stand in the way of Raider success. He built 
the present Chargers, for better or worse, but now hopes they lose every game. 
</P>
<P>
"I know this is hard to believe," he said. "But you get caught up so much with 
the emotions of winning a division title that you can't afford to root for 
other teams in your division, even if you have friends there. You can't. It's 
too competitive on a day-to-day basis. Yet, individually, there's a lot of 
people there I'd like to see succeed." 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer's stay in San Diego was controversial from the beginning. Remember, he 
left the Raiders to take over operations of a divisional rival, raising the 
usual suspicions that anyone who once worked for Al Davis never really works 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
Those fears were confirmed in some minds after Ortmayer's role in a major 
three-team trade that (1) landed the Raiders quarterback Jay Schroeder, (2) 
sent the Washington Redskins a Pro Bowl left tackle, Jim Lachey, and (3) gave 
the Chargers lineman John Clay, out of the league because of an injury, and 
later, McCallum, who has since returned to the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer heard the whispers, that he was a Raider masquerading as a Charger. He 
was always "Ort the Raider" to some San Diego loyalists. As in most rivalries 
involving the Raiders, paranoia rules. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer will try to block out the past and concentrate on what promises to be 
a game that would have been interesting without the added dimension of Bo 
Jackson, who is expected to make his 1990 debut. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, Ortmayer can tell you, are well stocked with defensive talent. 
They possess a punishing ground game, led by Marion Butts, and have a true star 
in receiver Anthony Miller. Yet on the road to 2-4, they've looked awful (two 
weeks ago against Pittsburgh) and brilliant (last week against the New York 
Jets with their most lopsided victory in 10 years, 39-3). 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver said the Chargers have to find a happy medium. 
"You have to play at a consistently high level every week that you go out," he 
said. "A lot of it comes from experience. But you can overcome some of those 
things if you go out with enthusiasm. That's what we're going to try to do." 
</P>
<P>
Into this mix the Raiders will throw Jackson. Coach Art Shell isn't saying how 
Jackson might be used today, but Jackson is expected to take Greg Bell's spot 
in the second-quarter tailback rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Shell said he's looking for more out of Jackson this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I want him to become more involved in the passing game," Shell said. "I think 
that's important. I don't want it to be a one-dimensional thing, that when Bo's 
in the game, then Bo Jackson's going to run, because he's a pretty good 
receiver." 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, this game is merely another meeting between mutual friends and 
enemies and one former general manager who returns to the scene of the firing. 
</P>
<P>
"Resentment has never been the right word," Ortmayer said of his dismissal. 
"Disappointment is certainly a much better word. Disappointment that we weren't 
allowed to complete the job we started." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the Raiders activated tailback Bo Jackson and defensive end Howie 
Long on Saturday. Jackson takes the roster spot vacated by safety Vann McElroy, 
traded last week to Seattle. To make room for Long, the team placed tailback 
Greg Bell on four-week injured reserve with a sprained right ankle. The Raiders 
also activated linebacker Alex Gordon off the team's practice squad, placing 
linebacker A.J. Jimerson on injured reserve with a neck injury. Gordon, a 
former second-round pick, was acquired earlier this week from the New York Jets 
for cornerback Dennis Price. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders lead the series in San Diego, 17-10-1. . . . Charger running back 
Marion Butts is the AFC's second-leading rusher with 505 yards in 105 carries, 
an average of 4.8 yards a carry. . . . Raider quarterback Jay Schroeder 
continues to lead the AFC in passing with a rating of 101.1. No other AFC 
quarterback has a rating as high as 90. 
</P>
<P>
If running back Bo Jackson plays in all of the Raiders' remaining 10 games this 
season, he will earn $140,000 per game. . . . Billy Joe Tolliver, San Diego's 
second-year quarterback, on the Raider-Charger rivalry: "You don't have to be 
here very long to understand the importance of the game. We've got two guys on 
this team that between them have 35 years playing experience, that's (assistant 
coaches) Ed White and Charlie Joiner. So they can tell us all we need to know." 
</P>
<P>
Raider receiver Mervyn Fernandez leads the AFC with 522 yards on 28 catches. He 
and teammate Willie Gault are averaging 18.6 yards a reception. . . . The 
Raider and Charger defenses have 20 sacks each through six games, second in the 
AFC to Kansas City's 24.

COMING TO LIFE 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne Coach Goy Casillas said it was only a matter of getting mad. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, the Cougars dominated the last 15 minutes Friday night to pull out a 
crucial 14-10 Bay League victory over host Leuzinger that pushed them into sole 
possession of first place. 
</P>
<P>
Casillas said Hawthorne finally had enough after watching the underdog 
Olympians control the game for most of the first three quarters and build a 
10-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We were getting frustrated," he said. "The players decided they were going to 
do something about it, and they did." 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Ira Moreland scored on a 40-yard run with 1:19 left in the third 
quarter to pull the Cougars within 10-7, and Hawthorne put together an 11-play 
drive on its next possession to score on a one-yard dive by fullback Armando 
Fernandez with 6:18 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone got hyped," said Hawthorne tailback Morell Ollis, who rushed five 
times for 27 yards on the game-winning march. "In the first couple of quarters, 
the offensive line wasn't concentrating. Then Coach Casillas told us a few 
words, and everybody did their job." 
</P>
<P>
A turning point occurred midway through the third quarter when Leuzinger, 
holding a 10-0 lead, had a fourth-down pass intercepted by Cougar linebacker 
Oswaldo Maldonado after the Olympians had driven to the Hawthorne 33. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, it changed the momentum," Leuzinger Coach Steve Carnes said. "I'm not 
disappointed with the call. Maybe we should have been a little more 
conservative, but we thought we had an opportunity to put them away. The play 
was there; the man was open. We just threw it into the linebacker." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MURDERERS' ROW 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger's three losses this season have come against teams with a combined 
record of 19-2. Canyon of Canyon Country (6-1) is ranked No. 8 in the 
CIF-Southern Section Division I poll, Paramount (7-0) is No. 2 in Division II 
and Hawthorne (6-1) is No. 2 in Division III. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RECORD PACE 
</P>
<P>
Carson quarterback John Walsh continued his assault on the record books Friday 
night by passing for 311 yards and six touchdowns in a 48-7 Southern Pacific 
Conference victory over Narbonne at Gardena High. 
</P>
<P>
The six TD passes represent a school single-game record. Walsh also set Carson 
marks with his sixth consecutive game of 200 yards or more passing and 93 
consecutive attempts without an interception. The last time he had a pass 
picked off was Sept. 28 against Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
For the season, Walsh has completed 104 of 170 passes for 1,995 yards and 22 
touchdowns in six games. The school records are 2,404 yards and 30 TDs set last 
season by Armin Youngblood in 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, if he continues at his present pace, will pass for 4,300 yards if Carson 
plays 13 games by reaching the L.A. City Section 4-A final. No South Bay 
quarterback has ever passed for 3,000 yards in a season. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, there is no City record book to measure how Walsh compares to 
the section's passing greats. Mike Smith of Los Altos (a forward with the 
Boston Celtics) holds the Southern Section record with 3,437 yards in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AFTERNOON HAZE 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Coach Chris Hyduke had a difficult time recognizing his own team Friday 
at Rolling Hills, where the Sea Hawks played miserably and lost their Ocean 
League opener, 34-6. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo entered the game with a plus-13 turnover ratio, but gave the ball away 
five times (four interceptions, one fumble) compared to one turnover for 
Rolling Hills. The Sea Hawk defense ranked second in the South Bay, allowing an 
average of 149.2 yards, but gave up 294 to Rolling Hills. And the offense, 
averaging 306.2 yards, managed just 115. 
</P>
<P>
Hyduke blamed the poor effort on three factors: 1. Rolling Hills was ready to 
play after a 32-6 loss to Morningside; 2. Redondo had no school Friday; 3. It 
was Redondo's first day game in two years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be honest with you, I don't like coming up here," Hyduke said. "This is 
in the afternoon and it changes the kids' rhythms. I'm not trying to make 
excuses, but the kids weren't focused. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe this was good for us. I'm looking at it as a positive thing. Maybe now 
(the players) can get focused and know what it means to be able to play every 
week." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1,000-YARD CLUB 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills tailback Robert Coulter became the first South Bay rusher to 
reach 1,000 yards by running for 187 yards, including touchdowns of 60 and 12 
yards, against Redondo. In seven games, Coulter unofficially has 1,114 yards 
and eight touchdowns on 148 carries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SITTING PRETTY 
</P>
<P>
Morningside Coach Ron Tatum was understandably worried two weeks ago about 
opening Ocean League play with back-to-back afternoon games at Rolling Hills 
and Palos Verdes. But after Friday's 14-0 victory over Palos Verdes, the 
Monarchs are 2-0 and alone in first place. 
</P>
<P>
Now Tatum is uncomfortable about being in the favorite's role. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me a little nervous," he said. "Teams are going to be coming after 
us. I'm not saying that people had taken us for granted, but now we know people 
are going to come after us a little tougher." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the Monarchs are in great shape. Their last two league games are at 
home against Redondo and Mira Costa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MONARCHS VS. KINGS 
</P>
<P>
The closing moments of the Morningside-Palos Verdes game were marred when a 
fight between Palos Verdes quarterback Tim King and Morningside linebacker 
Roosevelt Long touched off a moderate bench-clearing brawl. Three Palos Verdes 
players and Coach Bill Judy were ejected, as were two Morningside players. The 
usually mild-mannered Judy was thrown out for arguing with an official. 
</P>
<P>
Long accused the Sea Kings of rough tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd been punching me and giving me forearms all day," he said. "The refs 
wouldn't do anything about it. I got tired of it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TURNAROUND 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro, which opened the season with three consecutive victories, has now 
lost three in a row following Friday's 13-12 setback to Crenshaw. Junior 
quarterback Rino Marconi has also slipped. He completed only four of 18 passes 
for 39 yards against Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STREAKS 
</P>
<P>
* Serra defeated St. Monica, 38-14, to extend its winning streak to 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
* Carson defeated Narbonne, 48-7, for the 17th consecutive time. Narbonne last 
beat the Colts in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
* Hawthorne beat Leuzinger, 14-10, for the first time since 1984, ending a 
five-game winless streak against the Olympians. 
</P>
<P>
* Narbonne's loss to Carson extended its losing streak to 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
* Inglewood fell to Culver City, 20-15, for its 16th consecutive Bay League 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
Morningside receiver-quarterback John Cotton, on his 76-yard scoring catch from 
Stais Boseman in fourth quarter that sealed a 14-0 victory over Palos Verdes: 
"I knew we would score on that play. I told one of our players, 'If he throws 
the ball, it's a touchdown.' I even told the cornerback that I burned. I told 
him when I came up to the line, 'It's over.' He just looked at me and smiled. 
They actually had two-deep (coverage) on me. Either I'm fast or they're slow." 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Coach Chris Hyduke, on the possibility that junior Ted Silva will 
replace senior Dan Sanchez as starting quarterback after Sanchez threw three 
interceptions in a 34-6 loss to Rolling Hills: "We're going to work with 
(Silva) and get him some game experience. He might start next game." 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger Coach Steve Carnes, on Hawthorne being in the driver's seat for the 
Bay League title after beating the Olympians, 14-10: "I don't see anybody else 
beating them. I don't really think anybody else can beat them. They have too 
many athletes. To stay this close to them, it was tough." 
</P>
<P>
Gardena Coach Mike Sakurai, on his team's 27-7 loss to unbeaten Dorsey: "It was 
one of those games where we lost and the score wasn't all that close, but we 
felt good about it afterwards. We played extremely well and were leading, 7-3, 
after the first quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery Coach Steve Carroll, on his team's 15-7 loss to Alemany in 
which the Knights committed three turnovers to bring their season total to 30: 
"I said we were going to be a different team this week and we were. We moved 
the ball consistently. The only thing that stopped us were the turnovers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
David Rosato, South Torrance's leading receiver and defensive back, was hobbled 
by shoulder and elbow injuries in the Spartans' 24-7 loss to Mira Costa. He did 
not play on defense and figured in only three plays on offense. He is expected 
to play a bigger role next week against Torrance. ROB FERNAS and DAVID RAATZ

LATE MISCUE PAVES WAY FOR ANTELOPE VALLEY VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps Antelope Valley College could have engineered a last-minute drive for 
the winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
But as it was, good fortune intervened on the Marauders' behalf in a 21-14 
victory over host San Bernardino Valley in a Foothill Conference game Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
With 1 minute 27 seconds left and the score tied, 14-14, a bad snap on a San 
Bernardino punt from the 30-yard line gave the Marauders a first and goal just 
inside the Indian 10-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Punter Steve Price tracked down the ball but immediately was leveled by Rick 
Starling. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley (6-0-1, 4-0-1 in conference play) ran the ball three 
consecutive plays, scoring on Steve Miller's five-yard run over right tackle 
with 34 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't thinking field goal at that time," said Miller, who rushed for 72 
yards in 23 attempts. "We just wanted to score a touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
After playing to a 14-14 standoff in the first half, neither team mounted a 
serious threat in the second half until the errant Indian snap. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino (2-5, 1-4) drove to the Antelope Valley 35-yard line on its 
initial possession of the second half, but Starling recovered an Obie Cooper 
fumble. 
</P>
<P>
Until the last two minutes, Antelope Valley's deepest penetration was to the 
San Bernardino 48-yard line, but that drive fizzled when a pass by Marty 
Washington (seven of 16 for 38 yards, two touchdowns) was intercepted by Derek 
DeWitt at the Indian 33. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a little luck tonight," Miller said. "But we always thought we had a 
chance to make something happen." 
</P>
<P>
After being stung for two touchdowns -- and falling behind 14-0 -- in the first 
quarter, Antelope Valley regrouped in the second quarter and tied the score, 
14-14, six seconds before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The tying touchdown came on a 15-yard pass from Washington to Tony Simmons (84 
yards rushing in 17 carries), but it was Daron Rodgers' recovery of quarterback 
Anthony Strickland's fumble at the San Bernardino 22-yard line that set up the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's pass to Simmons came on a broken play as the redshirt freshman 
from Grambling State was chased out of the pocket before hitting Simmons at the 
15-yard line. From there, Simmons juked a couple of Indian defenders to get 
into the end zone.

Southwest 12, Pierce 0 -- Pierce (2-4, 2-3 in conference play) suffered its 
second shutout of the season as it fell in a Western State Conference game at 
Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the second quarter, Southwest (3-3, 2-3) moved 74 yards in 10 plays, a 
drive that was capped when quarterback Craig Manigo tossed a six-yard scoring 
pass to Larry Edmonds. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest took a 12-0 lead on a one-yard run by Eric Gibbs early in the third 
quarter.

GUZZO FITS INTO THE SCHEME OF THINGS IN EL CAMINO REAL DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember Jack (Hacksaw) Reynolds, the inside linebacker who left the Los 
Angeles Rams and helped the San Francisco 49ers win Super Bowl XVI in 1982? 
</P>
<P>
Meet Adam (Jigsaw) Guzzo, an inside linebacker who left the Simi Valley High 
Pioneers to become the final piece of the puzzle for an El Camino Real defense 
that has quickly become one of the best in the City Section. 
</P>
<P>
The Conquistadores are whole again, the last hole filled by a surprise transfer 
three weeks into the season. Guzzo is a perfect fit. 
</P>
<P>
The senior showed up at El Camino Real two weeks ago, having moved from his 
mother's home in Simi Valley to his father's home in West Hills. Guzzo already 
had ties to El Camino Real: His girlfriend is a student there and he had played 
in the West Valley Eagles youth football program with many of the Conquistadore 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked in the locker room and there he was," said Chris Griggs, the team's 
other inside linebacker. "It was just in time. We needed inside linebacker 
help." 
</P>
<P>
A knee injury to linebacker Damien Lopez had forced lineman Hilton Romanski to 
fill in at linebacker. In its first three games, El Camino Real was able to 
defeat punchless Monroe and Cleveland but had been defeated by Sylmar. Powerful 
San Fernando and Kennedy loomed ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The addition of Guzzo enabled Romanski to return to defensive tackle and gave 
the Conquistadores a talented quartet of linebackers -- Troy Snider and Jim 
Robertson on the outside, Griggs and Guzzo on the inside. 
</P>
<P>
"When Adam came, everything came back together," said Ryan Marine, a two-way 
starter at running back and safety. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real stunned San Fernando, 14-13, last week, with Guzzo dashing 76 
yards with a fumble recovery to set up the winning touchdown. The 
Conquistadores were even more impressive Friday night, blanking Kennedy, 20-0, 
and holding talented Golden Cougar running back Ontiwaun Carter to 45 yards in 
18 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Flashbacks: Those merry pranksters who made up the Quartz Hill Class of 1970 
were at it again Friday night during the Rebels' homecoming game that also 
served to celebrate its 20-year reunion. 
</P>
<P>
"Made up" is the key phrase here. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters from several newspapers were told by helpful members of the Class of 
'70 that Quartz Hill's 35-7 win over Saugus was the school's first homecoming 
victory since, you guessed it, 1970. Can you dig that? Like, unreal, man. 
</P>
<P>
Unreal, indeed. Turns out the Rebels won homecoming games in "1988, '87, and 
many other years," according to John Albee, who has been the Quartz Hill coach 
since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Home sweet home: After two decades of feeling like an unwanted guest, Royal 
finally has a castle to call its own. 
</P>
<P>
Until this season, the Highlanders played home games at rival Simi Valley High. 
In 1988, a bond issue to build a stadium at Royal High was defeated by less 
than 1%, a margin of 65 votes. Morale on campus was low. 
</P>
<P>
But thanks to the efforts of Principal Dave Jackson and Athletic Director Terry 
Dobbins, the Highlanders this year play at Moorpark College, perhaps the finest 
facility in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"The lack of a stadium was a major problem. The kids felt like they were second 
class," said Dobbins, in his third year at Royal after serving as Simi Valley 
athletic director for six years. "Royal needed an identity of its own." 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders have responded with first-class performances, shutting out 
Newbury Park and Agoura in their two Marmonte League home games. Royal is 6-1, 
having lost only at Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting Moorpark was a big boost," said Tim Ross, a third-year starter. "It's 
our place. We're proud to have people come and watch us there." 
</P>
<P>
Able Gable: Leon Gable's 330 rushing yards Friday night against Monroe bettered 
by three yards his total of two weeks ago against Van Nuys. The North Hollywood 
tailback's 657 yards in those two games is more than the season rushing total 
of seven area City Section teams. 
</P>
<P>
Gable and Montclair Prep's Eliel Swinton became the second and third area 
rushers to break the 1,000-yard barrier. Swinton, a Montclair Prep sophomore, 
had his fourth 200-yard game of the season Friday night to give him 1,016 
yards. Gable has 1,029. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's Pathon Rucker leads area players with 1,183 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Block party: Someday, somewhere, somebody will mention to Eugene Dreher that 
blocking a kick is supposed to be a rare occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the Antelope Valley linebacker has blocked three field-goal attempts 
and four point-after attempts this season. His latest came Friday against 
Canyon on a fourth-quarter conversion kick. 
</P>
<P>
Dreher blocks kicks with the frequency most people take vitamins: One a day. 
The Antelopes have played seven games; Dreher has blocked seven kicks. 
</P>
<P>
His secret? He blocks out negative thoughts. "It's just something I do," Dreher 
said. "It needs to be done, so I do it." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-3 junior linebacker rushes from the right side. Freddy Edwards lines 
up beside Dreher and charges inside, giving Dreher a clear shot at the kick. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the time, nobody touches me," Dreher said.

SADDLEBACK'S COMEBACK SADDLES FULLERTON WITH FIRST LOSS

<TEXT>
<P>
Saddleback College stunned previously undefeated Fullerton College, 31-29, in a 
Mission Conference Central Division game Saturday night at Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Bohn scored from the one-yard line with 31 seconds left in the game and 
Scott Hannah kicked the extra point as the Gauchos (4-2, 3-1) subdued the 
Hornets (5-1, 3-1), who came into the game ranked second the J.C. Grid-Wire 
national poll behind Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jeff Bailey engineered the Saddleback comeback after running back 
Brian Williams scored on a 56-yard run with 6:41 left in the game to put the 
Hornets ahead, 29-17. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey passed the Gauchos 65 yards down the field and found Terry Isles with a 
32-yard scoring pass with 5:21 remaining. Saddleback held the Hornets then 
drove 68 yards to set up Bohn's tally. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey was 24 for 43 passing for 325 yards and three touchdowns. Isles, with 
eight receptions for 147 yards and three touchdowns, and Mike Cook, with 10 
receptions for 119 yards, shredded the Hornet secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a freshman from Chino High School, led the Hornet ground attack with 
144 yards in 14 carries. Fullerton rolled up 337 yards rushing and 89 passing. 
</P>
<P>
The game matches the two winningest coaches in the history of community college 
football. Ken Swearingen improves to 218-65-6 and Fullerton's Hal Sherbeck 
falls to 231-66-8. TOM BIRSCHBACH

NORTHRIDGE SOCCER STREAK ENDS AT 4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Sacramento's soccer team ended visiting Cal State Northridge's 
four-match winning streak Saturday with a 2-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We just lost a game we shouldn't have lost," CSUN Coach Marwan Ass'ad said. 
</P>
<P>
"The first 20 minutes we were all over them. We beat them down the wings and 
crossed it over but we could not score. Their goalie (Dave Lamberg) played a 
great game." 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento (5-10) scored 30 minutes into the match and again three minutes 
later. The only goal for CSUN (7-6-3) came with 10 minutes left when a shot by 
Bobby Reyes deflected off a defender and into the net. 
</P>
<P>
In other men's soccer matches: 
</P>
<P>
Occidental 8, Caltech 2 -- Dirk Hogan, Carl Burmeister, Jason Nagler and Scott 
Sheldon each scored two goals for Occidental in a Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference match at Occidental (5-10-1, 5-2).

Rancho Santiago 43, Orange Coast 15 -- Estrus Crayton, playing a little more 
than one half, ran for 121 yards and four touchdowns to lead the Dons at Orange 
Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
Crayton, a sophomore tailback, surpassed the 2,000-yard mark in his career when 
he scored on an 11-yard run in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
He also scored on runs of 15, 22 and three yards. Crayton has 724 yards this 
season, and 2,064 yards in his career. 
</P>
<P>
Crayton's four touchdowns raised his conference-leading total to 17. He had 20 
last season and has scored 230 points in his 16-game career. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very typical night for him," Rancho Santiago Coach Dave Ogas said. 
"He's just an amazing kid." 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast (4-2, 2-2) did its part to make things even easier for Rancho 
Santiago (4-2, 2-2) by turning the ball over eight times. The first five were 
fumbles and the next three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Spoolstra had an interception and recovered a fumble, Justin Mills, 
Richard Valenzuela, and Scott Strini recovered fumbles and Gary Bladow and 
Scott McMahon got interceptions. STEVE KRESAL

The cross-country coaches at Saddleback and Hart highs, the top two ranked 
boys' teams in the Southern Section Division I poll, gave similar excuses why 
their teams didn't fare well Saturday in the Mt. San Antonio College 
Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
Mel Silva, who coaches No. 1 Saddleback, said his team wasn't mentally into the 
team sweepstakes race, in which the Roadrunners finished third. 
</P>
<P>
Hart Coach Gene Blankenship, whose second-ranked Indians finished second to 
Madera, said his team just plain didn't run well. 
</P>
<P>
Madera, the state's top-ranked team, placed five runners in the top 26 to win 
its second consecutive major invitational title, beating Hart, 96-161. 
Saddleback finished third with 168 points. 
</P>
<P>
Paul De La Cerda, Hart's fifth runner in 16 minutes 40 seconds, sprinted past 
nine runners in the final 200 yards to help push the Indians past Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
"Our heads weren't into it, but I'm glad they beat us," Silva said of Hart. "I 
think what happened today will make us concentrate in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Said Blankenship: "We came into the (final mile) with Madera beat. We had a 
terrible race. I think we're better than Madera. I think we're the best team in 
the state." 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Salinas led Saddleback, placing 17th in 15:54. Arroyo Grande's Louie 
Quintana and Dave Hartman of Canyon Country Canyon posted the fastest times of 
the day at Mt. SAC with Quintana winning, 14:40 to 14:51. 
</P>
<P>
Edison's Shelley Taylor, Katella's Martha Pinto and Jeannie Rothman of Westlake 
ran side by side with three-quarters of a mile to go in the girls' individual 
sweepstakes race, but Rothman surged away at the foot of Reservoir Hill to win 
in 17:25. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor finished second in 17:37 and Pinto (17:44) was third. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, a junior, led the Chargers to the team title. Edison placed five 
runners in the top 30 finishers to beat Fallbrook (San Diego Section), 94-105. 
Westlake (118) and Castro Valley (159) placed third and fourth. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' team sweepstakes race, Deena Drossin of Agoura tied the course 
record set in 1983 by Palos Verdes' Kirsten O'Hara. Drossin won her seventh 
race of the season in 17:16. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura totaled 61 points to beat San Diego Mt. Carmel (91), Arroyo Grande (131) 
and La Jolla (145). 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, behind Kelly Roda (fifth in 18:38), finished fifth with 152 points.

CALIFORNIA GLORY DAYS ARE OVER FOR BUSINESS, AND BOOSTERISM ISN'T GOING TO 
REVIVE THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Oct. 7 Business section did something worthwhile for California by 
countering with facts the usual hype dispensed by the California Chamber of 
Commerce. James Flanigan also picked up on the subject and wrote one of his 
more cogent columns, "Hardly Lean, We Are No Longer Hungry." 
</P>
<P>
California has had it good for so long that it is only natural for chamber of 
commerce types to believe that the future will simply be more of the same. 
However, it should be observed that the federal government's willingness to 
spend a disproportionate amount of its budget in California accounted for much 
of the state's luster over the years. With the prospect of an eventual cutback 
in defense procurement and the continuing deficit crisis at the federal level 
constraining other spending, a new era may be beginning for California, one in 
which the state must fend for itself. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, because of severe tax collection and spending limitation 
propositions passed by the electorate, the state is in a fiscal bind that 
threatens the collapse of the infrastructure needed for the growth of 
efficient, globally competitive businesses. It is no accident that the only new 
companies to succeed in highly competitive consumer markets over the past 20 
years are headquartered overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the great consumer-electronics business prospect for the 21st 
Century is high-definition television, there are no American-based consumer 
companies left to compete in this huge market for hardware. 
</P>
<P>
Just as we let our consumer electronics hardware companies collapse and be sold 
off, we are now permitting the sale of our entertainment software industry. 
While Matsushita and Sony are positioning themselves to be the giants of the 
electronics industry in the 21st Century, our government does nothing and hides 
behind ideological quips such as "the market is the best judge of what we 
should sell and buy -- not government regulators." I guess they feel Japan's 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry is more qualified to make such 
judgements. 
</P>
<P>
As to the reasons for businesses to depart California, you listed the most 
pertinent, with the exception of the crucial one -- perceived personal safety. 
What was the body count last weekend? The deterioration of public safety in 
Southern California has a long-term effect, particularly when added to the 
already negative effects of traffic, air quality and crowding.

INSURANCE REFORM JUST TIP OF BANKING ICEBERG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. JOHNSON, THOMAS S. JOHNSON is president of New York-based 
Manufacturers Hanover Corp. and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., the nation's 
seventh-largest bank. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deposit insurance reform has become a big issue as Congress searches for 
solutions to the savings and loan crisis and addresses concerns about the 
financial strength of our nation's banks. But it would be a mistake to deal 
with deposit insurance and ignore other fundamental issues. 
</P>
<P>
Here are three simple ideas we ought to keep in mind: 
</P>
<P>
* We need to resist the temptation, as understandable as it may be, to go for 
the quick fix. It won't work and most likely will result in even higher costs 
and higher risks down the road. 
</P>
<P>
We should address not only the condition of our insurance fund but a lot of 
other pressures that have built up over the past two decades as our financial 
markets have undergone a jarring transformation. This, to me, calls for a 
comprehensive plan, one that addresses not only the symptoms but the underlying 
causes as well. 
</P>
<P>
In this regard, it is useful to note that during the past 12 years we have seen 
no fewer than eight landmark financial reform acts passed into law. We had two 
major banking bills in 1978, one in 1980, two more in 1982, one in 1983, 
another in 1987 and, finally, last year's Financial Institutions Reform, 
Recovery and Enforcement Act. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this prodigious range of legislative attention, pressures at the core 
remain. This is because all the legislation taken together has still not 
addressed the fundamental structural weaknesses in the system. 
</P>
<P>
The weaknesses stem from the unnatural separation of the securities business 
from banking under the Glass-Steagall Act. And they arise from the Douglas 
Amendment and the McFadden Act, which have blocked the emergence of truly 
national banks that are scaled to the size and diversity of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
* Second, and along much the same lines, we should work hard to prevent the 
S&amp;L crisis from placing on the back burner once again the very pressing 
challenge of broad and comprehensive structural reform. 
</P>
<P>
As Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman noted in recent 
testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, the S&amp;L crisis is "a 
financial disaster of major proportions." But, as he also pointed out, "the 
S&amp;L crisis and the difficulties facing the banking industry should not be 
confused." 
</P>
<P>
I heartily agree. Vastly different issues brought on the thrift crisis. A 
different earnings dynamic. An obsolete concentration on housing finance. 
Capital standards that were practically non-existent. Extremely permissive 
accounting standards. Inadequate limits on loans to a single borrower. Very 
relaxed regulatory supervision. 
</P>
<P>
My concern is that the thrift crisis provides an all too convenient rationale 
for standing still in terms of broad reform and opting instead for something 
quick and immediate. That might be fun, but it wouldn't be constructive. 
</P>
<P>
* Third, we need to do something meaningful about the concept of Too Big to 
Fail. The costs of continuing this policy are too high. So are the risks. 
</P>
<P>
In this regard, I support an American Bankers Assn. proposal that would provide 
full deposit insurance coverage for accounts up to $100,000, with higher 
amounts handled by a rolling scale based on historic recovery rates. 
</P>
<P>
That said, however, I hope that in the United States we can also begin 
addressing the issue not only in terms of Too Big to Fail but in terms of Too 
Strong to Fail. We need banks that are large enough, diverse enough and strong 
enough so that their soundness isn't an issue. 
</P>
<P>
We need to create an environment in this country that will improve bank 
profitability, attract new capital, allow for a greater diversification of risk 
and facilitate orderly and efficient consolidation within the banking industry. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Chernow, author of "The House of Morgan," recently wrote an op-ed piece in 
the Wall Street Journal that made a pertinent and provocative point: 
</P>
<P>
"For 20 years now, our commercial banks have courted disaster. Unless we assume 
that all commercial bankers are dunces, we must suspect some deep, systemic 
flaw behind this flirtation with danger." 
</P>
<P>
The title of the essay expresses succinctly the spirit I've been trying to 
convey: "Don't Punish the Banks, Liberate Them." 
</P>
<P>
These thoughts add up to a single overriding recommendation: namely, that we 
not view the issue of deposit insurance reform in isolation. 
</P>
<P>
We need to address the total challenge. We need to link the insurance issue 
with the equally pressing need to fundamentally reform our entire financial 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike in other countries, the very structure of the U.S. banking system does 
not provide sufficient opportunities for an individual institution to diversify 
its risks geographically. 
</P>
<P>
One result is that in the past few years we watched as nine of the 10 largest 
banks in Texas went through some form of supervisory action. A regional 
economic downturn quickly became a banking disaster. 
</P>
<P>
I can tell you from my experience with it that the one large Texas bank that 
was acquired without official involvement was in trouble for one reason and one 
reason alone: It was locked in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Even if we had a deposit insurance system that imposed market discipline, how 
could we expect people in that state to impose it when they and their banks are 
geographically captive? What were their alternatives, other than outside the 
banking system? 
</P>
<P>
The same thing happened in the Farm Belt, and the same thing is happening in 
New England. 
</P>
<P>
Our banks are equally stymied when it comes to trying to diversify our sources 
of revenue. We are inhibited in attempting to follow our corporate clients' 
shifting financing patterns into the primary capital market, and we are kept 
from meeting the full rational array of consumer banking needs. 
</P>
<P>
With this erosion in the value of a commercial banking franchise, how can we 
expect the banking industry to attract the risk capital so necessary for a 
sound and stable system? Capital, it is useful to note, imposes the greatest 
market discipline, and, once obtained, presents the primary protection for 
depositors as well as the FDIC fund. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the discipline of capital has been strengthened by the Basel Accord, 
the product of multilateral cooperation that could form the model for 
developing international standards with respect to deposit insurance. 
</P>
<P>
But capital cannot be forced into the banking business; it must be attracted 
in. More formulas and more speeches about capital only frighten the market and 
make investors run for cover. 
</P>
<P>
What is needed in this country is a financial structure that will allow banks 
to diversify risks, serve their customers better and lower their costs by being 
able to consolidate into larger companies. When banks can do that, capital will 
be attracted into the industry and our financial system will be truly safe and 
sound.

In conclusion, I see deposit insurance reform as part of a far larger set of 
challenges. Perhaps FDIC chief Seidman said it best recently in testimony 
before the House when he referred to "the structural obstacles to the 
maintenance of a healthy banking system." 
</P>
<P>
"To be effective," he said, "deposit insurance reform must embrace these 
structural problems. Deposit insurance reforms that do not deal with the 
structural problems will produce few lasting improvements in the deposit 
insurance system and will not materially reduce the ultimate exposure of the 
taxpayer to difficulties among banks and thrifts. The purpose of deposit 
insurance reform should not be to hold together an antiquated banking 
industry."

FLAP CASTS DOUBT ON AFRICAN FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We are distraught, angered and unable to begin planning for the 1991 African 
Marketplace and Cultural Faire as a result of the controversy created by 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's criticism of the sale of two anti-Semitic books at 
this year's event (Times, Oct. 14). 
</P>
<P>
The uproar threatens an event that has been heralded as a love-in not only by 
Southern California residents and tourists, but by would-be imitators all over 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
The African Marketplace is the most successful of all city-sponsored festivals. 
This is not because of city funds, but because the community makes it happen. 
Over 150,000 multiethnic Southern Californians attend this event and there has 
never been a gang incident, shooting or other major crime or disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
The two books in question were among more than 500 books in the booth of Eso 
Won Bookstore. With over 150 vendors participating at the festival, how could 
the staff know of this inciteful literature? To our knowledge, none of the 
staff had ever heard of the books until Yaroslavsky's allegations surfaced in 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Correspondence sent to all prospective vendors informed them that no political, 
controversial or inflammatory objects, artifacts, literature or artwork would 
be permitted. We were way ahead of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The African Marketplace can hardly be considered an anti-Semitic venue. Not 
when vendors of Jewish ancestry are participants and selling beautiful African 
clothes and authentic artifacts from that great continent. Not when food 
vendors specializing in Middle Eastern cuisine participated. The dismantling of 
the African Marketplace, for whatever reasons, will not come about without the 
one-voice outrage of the community. To let such a positive event go down in 
defeat without a fight is unthinkable.

FALSE CHARGES OF CHILD ABUSE DOG CUSTODY BATTLES; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: EXPERTS SAY RECENT CHANGES IN THE LAW MAY HAVE CREATED AN ATMOSPHERE 
THAT ENCOURAGES OFFICIALS TO BELIEVE FALSE ACCUSATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Martinez and Lisa Munoz were fighting over custody of their 2-year-old 
daughter, Monique, and it got nasty. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz alleged that Martinez sexually molested the girl. 
</P>
<P>
Within days of the accusation, county officials took Monique away from her 
father. He had to tell his boss he was being investigated. He gave blood 
samples and hair samples. He hired lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
There was only one problem with what was happening. The accusation was false. 
Munoz knew it. Martinez knew it. 
</P>
<P>
To prove his innocence Martinez began taping his private conversations with 
Munoz. 
</P>
<P>
According to the transcripts of one conversation, Munoz told him, "I know you 
didn't do that, Joe." She said she alleged he had molested Monique because 
"that's the only way to get my daughter back." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in a hearing last month, after hearing the tapes, San Diego Superior 
Court Judge Thomas Ashworth returned custody of Monique to her father. He said, 
"It is hard for me to think of anything that is more irresponsible and hateful 
than making a false report of this type." 
</P>
<P>
Yet some experts in the area of child custody say it is increasingly common for 
false charges to be leveled -- to gain a tactical advantage or simply to get 
even. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a big problem," said Lee Coleman, a Berkeley psychiatrist and expert 
in child-custody disputes. "There's no question there's been a dramatic rise in 
these kinds of allegations in the last seven, eight years -- maybe tenfold, but 
nobody knows the precise numbers." 
</P>
<P>
He said, "It's an epidemic." 
</P>
<P>
Although precise statistics are elusive, the general rate of false reports of 
child abuse is about 8% of all reports, researchers have said. And family law 
experts believe the false report rate in child custody cases mirrors that rate. 
</P>
<P>
The Martinez case is unusual because the charge was so quickly and clearly 
proven to be false, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Designed to protect children, recent changes in the laws may instead have 
created an atmosphere in which investigators and social workers are inclined to 
believe a charge of abuse and one in which the accusing parent -- typically, a 
mother -- may have nothing to lose by making a false charge, lawyers and 
psychiatrists said. 
</P>
<P>
"The system has clearly overreacted," said Michael McGlinn, a San Diego lawyer 
and expert in child-abuse laws. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's saying molestation is not a problem," said one of Martinez's lawyers, 
Jim Veltman of San Diego. "You've got to exercise caution. It's where to strike 
the balance." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators and social workers maintain that they strike the appropriate 
balance, because they are neutral and unbiased reporters searching for facts. 
</P>
<P>
But Martinez said sheriff's department and social service investigators seemed 
more interested in proving his guilt than finding the truth, asking him leading 
questions and suggesting he was dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Though Munoz eventually lost the custody battle, she did not have legal custody 
of Monique at the start, so she risked nothing, Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Munoz did not lie under oath, she is not subject to a criminal contempt 
proceeding, lawyers said. And Martinez said he does not want to press charges 
-- for instance, extortion -- against her. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the allegation of abuse is unsupported, as it was in Martinez's case, 
it leaves the accused parent -- usually, the father -- in legal limbo, with 
sharply circumscribed legal rights and in the difficult position of refuting an 
untruth, lawyers and judges said. 
</P>
<P>
Without clear medical evidence of abuse, it is virtually impossible to prove 
the truth or falsity of a claim of abuse, experts said. Instead, it becomes a 
judge's call, based on the credibility of the mother or father, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said a Family Court counselor told him he was the first father the 
staffer had ever seen vindicated in 10 years. The problem is that even his 
exoneration took something as dramatic as a tape-recorded admission, experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Fellmeth, executive director of the Children's Advocacy Institute at the 
University of San Diego, a project of the Center for Public Interest Law, which 
he also directs, said false claims "undermine the critical credibility of 
legitimate claims." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid that the credibility undermined by a small number, even a very 
small number, of false accusations, results in a very high price that we're all 
going to have to pay," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"For every one that is fabricated, 99 may be telling the truth," Fellmeth said. 
"But who to believe? That's what hurts." 
</P>
<P>
In a 1987 law journal article, Santa Clara County Judge Leonard P. Edwards said 
that about 2% to 10% of all Family Court cases surrounding custody or 
visitation disputes involve a charge of sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County Family Court last year, there were 254 cases involving 
allegations of suspected abuse among about 6,000 cases total, or a rate of 4%, 
said Murray Bloom, director of Family Court Services, which mediates and 
investigates custody matters. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom said there are no statistics for the number of false or unsubstantiated 
claims in the San Diego court because that would involve a determination -- 
true or false -- in each case. Many cases don't reach a clear determination, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hard numbers are not available elsewhere, either, but lawyers, judges and 
psychiatrists said repeatedly that they believe the number of false and 
questionable claims of abuse in Family Court custody disputes is on the rise. 
The court is a branch of Superior Court that handles issues relating to the 
care, custody and control of children. 
</P>
<P>
What experts do know is that, because of new laws and increased public 
awareness of child abuse, an entire industry -- doctors, therapists, 
investigators -- has been created in California since the Legislature issued a 
clear directive in 1980 to halt child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
That year, the Legislature passed a mandatory reporting law, since strengthened 
several times by subsequent bills, that expands the class of persons who must 
report suspected abuse and establishes serious penalties for failure to report. 
</P>
<P>
The result: In 1987, more than 370,000 reports of child maltreatment were made 
to child protective services around the state, according to the San Diego-based 
Children's Advocacy Institute. That number was up 404% from 1982, it said. 
</P>
<P>
To maintain that kind of growth, critics said, it's in the self-interest of the 
industry to believe each and every claim. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a whole industry now, treating and caring for these kinds of 
problems," McGlinn said. "We do have a problem, there is abuse going on, and 
it's terrible and it shouldn't go on. But I think everybody has to be very, 
very careful in cases where there's really a question of what happened. Because 
a lot of lives are being ruined." 
</P>
<P>
Another change in the state's laws may be contributing to the perceived 
increase in false claims in child-custody cases in court. 
</P>
<P>
It used to be that there was what was called the "tender years" presumption in 
custody battles. That rule ordered a judge to presume that custody of a child 
would go to the mother unless the father could show in court that he was a 
better parent. 
</P>
<P>
A revision made the law neutral -- now neither parent begins the custody fight 
in court with a legal advantage. 
</P>
<P>
With the presumption, women typically had a "bargaining chip," custody and 
visitation rights, to trade with men, who typically had greater financial 
assets, said Robert Goldstein, a UCLA law professor and expert on family law. 
</P>
<P>
Without this bargaining chip, some women succumb to the pressure by making 
false charges, Goldstein suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"Where once (women) could count on getting custody, they're now in a position 
of having to share custody," he said. "It's not surprising that you start 
finding these sort of (false) allegations." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Munoz said the molestation accusation was false. She 
said she hoped the accusation might gain her a tactical advantage in the 
custody dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was wrong," she said. "I did it, but, after I did it, I really 
regretted it." 
</P>
<P>
Veltman, one of Martinez's lawyers in the custody dispute, said the dilemma 
facing a judge is that, presented with an accusation of abuse, no judge, even a 
skeptical one, "wants to be the one who says, 'There's not enough proof here.' 
Then, the next day that father molests a kid, and the judge had let him go." 
</P>
<P>
Veltman said he even looked suspiciously at Martinez. "I looked at the client 
cockeyed a couple times. You don't want to be an attorney advocating for a 
scumbag. But we decided he was a square guy." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, 27, and Munoz, 22, grew up and went to high school together in 
Brawley, in Imperial County. When she became pregnant, they moved in together 
in San Diego, where Martinez was attending San Diego State University. They 
never married. 
</P>
<P>
Monique was born in August, 1988, a few months after Martinez earned his 
bachelor's degree in criminal justice. That same month, he received his 
commission in the Army Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1989, Monique and Martinez split up. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez filed for legal custody of Monique. He was granted custody by default 
on June 13, 1989, when Munoz failed to show at a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
In court papers, Munoz said she did not appear because she was unable to afford 
a lawyer, was overwhelmed by the court procedure and was intimidated by 
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Later that summer, the two reconciled and Munoz moved back in with Martinez. He 
obtained a job as an investigator with the newly formed county public 
defender's office. Munoz did not work outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Martinez hired a baby-sitter to help care for the baby. The sitter 
has continued to care for Monique on and off since June, 1989, according to 
court records. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 11, 1990, Munoz said she left the house, without the baby, because 
Martinez had been "aggressively dominating me," court records show. He said he 
took her to Brawley, but she returned to El Cajon and moved in with a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 29, she went to court. She had hired a lawyer -- from the law firm of 
Jacoby &amp; Meyers -- and asked that the June, 1989, court order awarding 
Martinez custody of Monique be changed. She also asked for child support and 
attorney's fees. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz also charged that she had seen Martinez "hit and shake Monique." He 
called that accusation "totally false" in court papers. The baby-sitter would 
tell a Family Court counselor that she never saw any bruises or scratches on 
the baby. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys at the Jacoby &amp; Meyers firm declined to discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 31, Ashworth, the San Diego Superior Court judge, ordered that the two 
share custody. Pending meetings with a Family Court counselor and a hearing 
Sept. 11, Martinez was to have custody of Monique on the weekends and Munoz 
during the week, he ruled. 
</P>
<P>
"She just had to say that, allege that abuse occurred. She didn't even have to 
present any evidence, and the judge immediately gave her shared custody," 
Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 7, the court counselor recommended, after interviewing both parents, 
that it was in Monique's best interests to live with her father. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, a Saturday, Munoz called the Sheriff's Department and claimed 
that Martinez had sexually molested the girl. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened was my attorney served him with some papers, we went and talked 
to the counselor, and I guess the counselor was more for his side, I guess," 
Munoz said. "I was afraid that I wasn't going to get custody because my 
daughter means everything to me. 
</P>
<P>
"So I had to do what I had to do." 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 10, the following Monday, the Family Court counselor changed his 
recommendation, saying that Monique should stay with Munoz, and that Martinez 
should have no contact with the girl. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few days, Martinez was contacted by Fran Atwood, a social worker 
with Child Protective Services, a division of the county's Department of Social 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
Atwood wanted to "set up an interview to see how much of a danger I would be to 
my daughter, not whether it was true or not," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Atwood declined to comment. But Carol Baenziger, a department spokeswoman, 
said, "We don't assume anyone's guilt or innocence. We are neutral, and we 
remain unbiased until all the facts are gathered." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Williams, a sheriff's investigator, also contacted Martinez. "I thought he 
was trying to get to me, to say even normal people have this problem with 
children at times, that stress can lead normal people to do these things," 
Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams denied any impropriety. He said, "There was no preconceived idea of 
guilt or innocence." 
</P>
<P>
A doctor examined Monique and reported that it could not be proven that she had 
been molested nor could it be ruled out, according to court papers. 
</P>
<P>
"A diaper rash turned into, 'Maybe she was, maybe she wasn't,' " Martinez said. 
"It was like, 'Come on, you can tell a diaper rash from another kind of rash 
you're looking for.' " 
</P>
<P>
An adult's hair was found in Monique's diaper, so, on the advice of attorney 
Dan Larkin, who was preparing Martinez for the possibility of criminal charges, 
he gave blood, hair and saliva samples to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 11, Martinez and Munoz met. He recorded the meeting and told her it 
was being recorded, which she acknowledged. Still, she admitted lying about the 
molestation claim. 
</P>
<P>
A few days earlier, on Sept. 5, she acknowledged in another tape-recorded 
conversation that she had made up the story about Martinez hitting Monique. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd better agree on something," she said, according to the transcript. "I 
don't want to see you go to jail, I want your money." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said he had decided to tape their meetings because of his experience 
as an investigator. "I was preparing myself for these charges," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Larkin, the lawyer, gave Williams, the Sheriff's Department investigator, the 
transcripts. Williams confronted Munoz, and she confessed that she had made up 
the charge, Larkin said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 19, Ashworth awarded sole physical custody of Monique to her father. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I can easily think of anything that you can do that is much 
worse to a child and to the other parent than make a false allegation of this 
type," he said. "It starts too many things in motion that are somewhat 
knee-jerk reactions." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said he considered filing criminal charges against Munoz, but recently 
decided he would not. "Why start this whole scenario all over again?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said, "I'm not saying (sexual molestation) never happens, because it 
probably does. I'm just saying, 'Be more careful. And think about the father 
every now and then.' " 
</P>
<P>
He also said he hopes mother and daughter can be reunited. "I don't want to 
keep my daughter from knowing her mom." 
</P>
<P>
Munoz, however, said she isn't ready to see Monique. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, I told Joe I didn't want to see her until I got over 
all this," she said. "It caused a lot of stress on me. I told him I didn't want 
to see her until I got over all this because I would see her for a day or two, 
and he would take her away, and that's the most pain, saying goodby to her."

BOOS FOR MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Couldn't San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor have used a different analogy in her 
remarks to GOP officials, instead of calling San Diego "a beautiful girl" who 
"doesn't have a dowry" ("Mayor Tries to Sweet-Talk GOP Into Picking S.D.," Oct. 
12)? 
</P>
<P>
And boos also to City Councilwoman Judy McCarty for saying that "we may not 
have a dowry . . . but we can promise you a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, we are for sale; we'll give you our bodies for your money. 
</P>
<P>
Can you imagine "a handsome boy" with no dowry who'll give you a lot of fun? 
Shades of "American Gigolo." 
</P>
<P>
I know that advertising uses sex to sell products -- but our mayor using a 
sexual analogy to sell our city? Absurd, tasteless and typical of today's 
"marriage" of entertainment, news, politicians.

CASH INSTEAD OF FOOD STAMPS -- A RISKY LEAP; 
</P>
<P>
POVERTY: SAN DIEGO COUNTY'S SHIFT AWAY FROM FOOD STAMPS MAY WORSEN THE PROBLEM 
OF CHILDHOOD HUNGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SUPER, David Super is a policy analyst for the nonprofit Food Research 
and Action Center in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hunger hurts everyone. We all have a stake in preventing infants from being 
born underweight, in improving the performance of school children, in improving 
the work performance of adults and in preventing debilitating and expensive 
nutrition-related health problems among the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
No one goes hungry by choice. 
</P>
<P>
Hunger is the result of poverty; and in America today, 32 million people are 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
According to a recent, scientifically valid survey of poor households in the 
United States, 3 million to 5 million children are hungry. This same survey 
found that hungry children suffer significantly more health problems than 
children who have enough to eat. These illnesses cause children to miss more 
days of school. And hungry children cannot learn. 
</P>
<P>
Many larger issues relating to poverty must be addressed, including adequate 
education, jobs and wages, affordable housing and health care. But hungry 
children cannot wait for long-term solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Any proposal that could help alleviate hunger deserves careful consideration. 
But converting food stamps to cash, as San Diego County began to do this fall, 
is unlikely to lessen the blight of childhood hunger. In fact, it may well make 
this problem worse. 
</P>
<P>
The federal food stamp program was begun in the early 1960s as a way of helping 
poor families achieve a nutritious diet. Even before severe cuts in the early 
1980s, it was never funded at a level sufficient to assure adequate diets for 
low-income people. 
</P>
<P>
Food stamp benefits are not based on poor households' food costs in the real 
world. Instead, benefits are based on the "thrifty food plan," a hypothetical 
projection of the least amount that low-income households could spend to obtain 
a minimally adequate diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that 
only about 1 in 10 low-income households spending this amount would obtain a 
nutritionally adequate diet. 
</P>
<P>
Little wonder, then, that soup kitchens and food pantries report substantial 
increases in requests for emergency assistance at the end of the month, when 
food stamp allotments have run out. 
</P>
<P>
It is against this backdrop that San Diego began its "cash-out" project. 
Households that previously received booklets of food stamps each month now 
receive checks in the same amount. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents assert that recipients will have greater freedom as to how to spend 
this money. The county also expects to reap administrative savings, because 
checks are less expensive to write and distribute. In fact, this freedom is 
likely to be illusory, the savings relatively insignificant and many other 
costs hidden. 
</P>
<P>
USDA studies show that a household's nutritional level increases far more 
rapidly with each additional dollar it receives in food stamps than it does 
when that same dollar is provided in cash. Studies of previous cash-out 
projects do not show dramatic improvements in the program's performance. 
</P>
<P>
The Alabama welfare department recently asked food stamp households whether 
they would prefer the freedom of receiving assistance in cash rather than food 
stamps. Much to the department's surprise, the majority of the recipients it 
surveyed preferred stamps. 
</P>
<P>
One of the dangers of the cash approach is that it gives landlords and 
creditors the opportunity to charge more. 
</P>
<P>
In many communities, rents for the lowest-quality housing hover a few dollars 
below the maximum public assistance grants; when grant levels increase, many 
landlords raise their rents by a corresponding amount. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords cannot collect food stamps as rent, but converting stamps to cash 
allows landlords to raise rents. 
</P>
<P>
Other creditors may react similarly. With energy costs skyrocketing and the 
Low-Income Home-Energy Assistance Program having been cut 47% over the last 
nine years, many poor households are forced to negotiate limited service 
arrangements with utility companies for which payments may be based on 
percentages of their incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these creditors will want their share of any "new" cash that comes into 
a poor household, even if that cash is just the equivalent of the household's 
food stamp allotment. 
</P>
<P>
The danger that cashing out food stamps poses to low-income children is 
exacerbated by the inadequacy of other food assistance programs. A lack of 
funds still prevents the highly acclaimed Special Supplement Food Program for 
Women, Infants and Children (WIC) from serving more than about half of those 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
In California, which already has lower-than-average WIC funding, thousands of 
children were thrown off of WIC this summer because unexpected food price 
increases threatened to exhaust program funds. For these children and those 
unable to get onto WIC, food stamps are the main line of defense against 
hunger. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is much too early to form a firm judgment on the San Diego 
experience, local food pantry operators are already reporting a sharp increase 
in requests, which appears to go beyond what could be expected from a 
slackening economy. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, poor households are coming much earlier in the month, having 
exhausted their food budgets sooner than they had previously. 
</P>
<P>
This increased demand for emergency food comes at a time when surplus 
commodities for the poor have been drastically reduced. The result is that many 
families in dire need may be turned away from these food pantries. San Diego 
County hopes to save $600,000 in administrative costs this year. 
</P>
<P>
But the costs of hunger are quite great: even a slight increase in 
hunger-related illness is likely to increase Medi-Cal costs by more than the 
cash-out's administrative savings. 
</P>
<P>
And, although it may be harder to measure the human costs of these illnesses 
and the long-term losses in productivity resulting from hungry children's 
failure to learn in school, these costs are no less real. 
</P>
<P>
In a world where low-income people's resources more closely approximated the 
cost of living, providing food assistance as cash would have great merit for 
reducing the stigma of the program. 
</P>
<P>
But under existing conditions, a cash-out of food stamp benefits threatens to 
further undermine the tenuous nutritional safety net on which many more 
households and their children already depend.

RANCHO SANTA FE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing in response to the article "A Country Oasis Girds For Change" 
(Oct. 14). In my opinion, there is no reason why some so-called place of luxury 
should complain about how overcrowded their community is becoming, when most of 
the people who live in this particular place don't even know what their 
neighbors look like. 
</P>
<P>
The houses are at least a quarter of a mile apart from each other. Give me a 
break. How would these people feel if the house next door was within just a few 
dozen yards of their own. This is how most people in our country live. 
</P>
<P>
They are also complaining about their giant traffic problems. I have driven 
through this place (Rancho Santa Fe) a countless number of times and I have yet 
to see any sort of traffic jam. Try driving down Highway 101 in the middle of a 
summer day, then you will see what traffic is all about.

'NO' VOTE URGED ON PROPOSITIONS D, M; 
</P>
<P>
* BUILDER BACKPEDALING SHOWS HYPOCRISY BEHIND THE 'GROWTH MANAGEMENT' 
INITIATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The building industry's decision to orphan its own supposed growth-management 
ballot measures had us wondering: Could there be provisions in Propositions D 
and M that merit voter support of the package? 
</P>
<P>
Nah. 
</P>
<P>
The builders found themselves in a sticky position when the San Diego City 
Council recently gave tentative approval to citywide impact fees averaging 
about $1,000 per home for the first year. That's because Proposition M -- the 
initiative the builders placed on the ballot to ward off a tougher measure then 
offered by a citizens group -- calls for fees as much as twice that amount. 
</P>
<P>
When the industry realized that it could be responsible for locking developers 
into higher fees, it halted its campaign for Proposition M, and the 
corresponding measure for county lands, Proposition D. 
</P>
<P>
The builders were gambling that they could persuade the council not to increase 
the fees in coming years, as planned. The ballot measures would be much harder 
to amend. The tactic demonstrates the hypocrisy of calling the propositions 
"comprehensive growth-management" initiatives. If they were even a semblance of 
that, there would be no reason to shut down the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the builders may have already scared the council off. Last week, 
the council postponed final approval of the fees until Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
But, even if the council backs off -- and it should not -- it would still be a 
mistake for voters to approve these flawed special interest measures. 
</P>
<P>
In the first place, growth management and traffic mitigation should be the 
province of the City Council and the county Board of Supervisors. Though we 
reluctantly supported two slow-growth ballot measures in 1988, we noted that 
the initiatives were an inflexible, last-ditch method of addressing situations 
that government had ignored for years. 
</P>
<P>
That is still true today. Despite the home construction bust that the region 
now finds itself in, we hope that the City Council will find a way to adopt 
meaningful standards for traffic congestion, air and water quality, mass 
transit and other critical needs -- and institute corresponding controls on 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
The builders' plan calls for establishment of facility standards, but then 
imposes a $2,000 per home cap on the amount of money that could be generated to 
fund construction of major roads. That would not be enough to build the major 
arterials needed. And, unlike the tentatively approved city fees, there would 
be no money for parks, the central library, operations yards or other city and 
countywide facilities. 
</P>
<P>
More troubling is a provision that apparently exempts almost all development 
already proposed from the initiatives' standards. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition D also includes child-care and recycling provisions that are less 
stringent than already enacted state and city standards, and other elements 
that are clearly window dressing. 
</P>
<P>
We should all take our cue from the development industry's decision not to 
campaign for its initiative. 
</P>
<P>
And the City Council should give final approval to more meaningful citywide 
impact fees. Even if the slowing economy dictates low fees initially, the 
council must implement a financial plan that allows the city to start tackling 
the backlog of unmet needs. 
</P>
<P>
We recommend a No vote on propositions D and M, and a Yes vote by the council 
on citywide impact fees.

SEWAGE SPILL CAUSES QUARANTINE OF SHORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County Health Department workers posted quarantine signs along a stretch of bay 
shoreline in the 5100 block of North Harbor Drive Saturday morning because of a 
sewage spill. 
</P>
<P>
The quarantine occurred after a grease blockage in the 1500 block of Rosecrans 
Boulevard caused about 1,200 gallons of raw sewage to spill into the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Christina Graulau, county health department spokeswoman, said that the spill 
was stopped about 11 a.m. Saturday, but the shoreline quarantine will remain in 
effect for at least 24 hours.

Kristi Yamaguchi of Fremont, Calif., scored her second major upset in two 
months, beating 1989 world champion Midori Ito of Japan at the Skate America 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Yamaguchi, who beat reigning world champion Jill Trenary at the Goodwill Games, 
landed seven triple jumps in her four-minute performance. 
</P>
<P>
Ito started strong with a soaring triple lutz before failing on her trademark 
triple Axel jump, touching the ice with both hands to keep from falling. 
</P>
<P>
Stefania Calegari and Pasquale Camerlengo of Italy easily won the ice dancing 
event. They won all three phases of the event with their innovative free dance 
set to a circus theme. The French team of Isabelle Sarech and Zavier Debernis 
finished second. The top Americans were Jeanne Miley and Michael Verlich, who 
finished sixth.

LAKERS STOP BUCKS' RALLY, 98-90; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: JOHNSON SPRAINS HIS ANKLE, BUT IT ISN'T CONSIDERED SERIOUS. HE 
SAYS HE WILL PLAY TONIGHT AGAINST SPURS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Like Maccabi of Tel Aviv, the Milwaukee Bucks lasted longer into Saturday night 
than had been expected. They cut a 13-point lead to 88-85 late in the game, but 
the Lakers fought them off and won, 98-90, in the Great Western Shootout at the 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers thus will meet the San Antonio Spurs, 109-92 winners over the 
Cleveland Cavaliers, tonight at 7:30 for the title. 
</P>
<P>
James Worthy led all scorers with 29. Magic Johnson left the game after 
spraining his left foot late in the third quarter. He went to the dressing room 
but returned to the bench. Coach Mike Dunleavy, however, didn't put him back 
in. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson says he's OK and will play tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I saw what the injury was," Dunleavy said, "I knew the season was 
all right." 
</P>
<P>
Also playing little, but for another reason, was center Vlade Divac, the most 
lightly used of the regulars in the exhibition season, who once more got in 
quick foul trouble and went only 17 minutes. Divac hasn't gone more than 23 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the Lakers started slowly, too. Dunleavy called a wakeup timeout 
with the Bucks ahead, 10-4, and about that time, Johnson told Divac to dunk the 
ball, after Divac took a pass from Magic on a fast break and missed a reverse 
layup. 
</P>
<P>
About that time, the Laker off guards went off. Byron Scott hit two three-point 
baskets and finished the first quarter with 12 points. Then his replacement, 
Terry Teagle, coming off a seven-for-eight fourth quarter against Maccabi, went 
four for five and scored another 10 points by halftime. The Lakers led, 84-71, 
in the fourth quarter and made enough late free throws to choke off a Bucks 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a preseason game," Buck Coach Del Harris, Dunleavy's former boss, said. 
"The Lakers were up and down in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Johnson: "Portland, San Antonio, Milwaukee, they're flowing. We're not 
flowing right now, that's the difference. Their system is already in. But it's 
gonna flow." 
</P>
<P>
For the Spurs, winners in the opener, anything positive was a surprise. They 
lost to the Pistons Friday night in Auburn Hills, Mich., flew cross-country 
Saturday morning, got to the Forum at 3 in the afternoon and had to tip it off 
at 4:30. This is unusual punishment, even for an NBA exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Someone asked David Robinson who had done the scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," the San Antonio center said. "Whoever did, I should kill him." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson had 21 points, eight rebounds and four blocks, and figures he's far 
ahead of the same point last season., 
</P>
<P>
"Coach (Larry) Brown said I've improved," Robinson said. "That's a big step, 
getting him to say something positive about me."

<P>
A month ago, Minnesota had the worst defense in the Big Ten. After three games, 
the Gophers ranked last in every team defensive category and were giving up an 
average of nearly 36 points and 493 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
This is the same defense that shut out No. 20 Indiana, 12-0, Saturday at 
Minneapolis to keep the Gophers in a tie for the Big Ten lead. 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Gutekunst took more direct control of the defense after a 56-0 loss 
to Nebraska, and the move seems to be paying off. With the defense showing 
steady improvement, Minnesota is 4-2 overall and 3-0 in the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
The Gophers' shutout of Indiana was their first since blanking Illinois, 21-0, 
in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
And it wasn't an ordinary Hoosier team that the Gophers stuffed. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoosiers (4-1-1, 1-1-1) entered the game averaging 41.8 points a game, 
fourth in the nation and tops in the Big Ten. They also led the conference with 
280.4 yards rushing per game and were third in total offense with 426.4 yards a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The Gophers held Indiana to 166 yards, including 63 in 27 rushes. Vaughn 
Dunbar, the Big Ten's No. 3 rusher with 109 yards a game, was held to 11 yards 
in seven carries. 
</P>
<P>
The Gophers got all their points -- two field goals and a one-yard sneak by 
Marquel Fleetwood -- after big defensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
No. 8 Illinois 15, No. 24 Michigan State 13 -- Doug Higgins' fifth field goal 
of the game, a 48-yarder with 42 seconds to play, enabled the Illini (5-1, 3-0) 
to beat the Spartans (2-3-1, 1-2) at Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
A 26-yard pass from Jason Verduzco to Steven Mueller helped set up the winning 
kick 59 seconds after John Langeloh gave Michigan State a 13-12 lead with a 
35-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins opened the game with a career-long 55-yard field goal and also 
converted on kicks of 28, 36 and 27 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois held a 9-3 lead before Michigan State drove 84 yards in 12 plays for a 
touchdown, with Dan Enos bootlegging the final yard for the score. It appeared 
the Illini had stopped the drive when Mel Agee sacked Enos at the 15, but a 
facemask penalty put the ball on the five, and Enos finally scored on fourth 
down for a 10-9 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins' 27-yard field goal with 7:27 left made it 12-10, but the Spartans 
drove to the 17 and got a 35-yard field goal by Langeloh to make it 13-12. 
</P>
<P>
Northwestern 44, Wisconsin 34 -- Bob Christian carried 42 times for 220 yards 
and one touchdown and caught passes for two more at Evanston, Ill., as the 
Wildcats (2-4, 1-2) won a Big Ten game for the first time since November, 1988, 
when they beat Purdue, 28-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Badgers (1-5, 0-3) haven't won a conference game on the road since winning 
at Evanston in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State 42, Purdue 2 -- Flanker Jeff Graham caught passes for two touchdowns 
and threw to quarterback Greg Frey for another as the Buckeyes (3-2-1, 1-1-1) 
routed the Boilermakers (1-5, 0-3) at West Lafayette, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, who had a career-high 144 yards on four receptions, made three catches 
for 96 yards in the first half and caught a 48-yard touchdown pass from Frey on 
Ohio State's first play of the second half. He scored on a 58-yard touchdown 
play and also threw a 60-yard scoring pass in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue quarterback Scott Hoffman, making his first collegiate start in place of 
injured Eric Hunter, completed 31 of 54 passes for 317 yards, but he threw five 
interceptions. The 54 attempts is one less than the school record of 55, set by 
Scott Campbell in 1982 and matched by Jim Everett in 1985.

After a "fumblerooskie" play backfired on Florida State and helped Auburn tie 
the score, Jim Von Wyl kicked a 38-yard field goal with two seconds remaining, 
moving the fifth-ranked Tigers into the thick of the national championship race 
with a 20-17 victory over the seventh-ranked Seminoles Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Stan White helped set up the winning kick with a fourth-down, 
21-yard completion to Herbert Casey. After letting the clock run down to six 
seconds, Von Wyl came on to kick his second game-winner of the year. Two weeks 
ago, his 30-yarder beat Louisiana Tech, 16-14. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy Danley tied the score, 17-17, diving over from the two with 3:47 
remaining to cap a 57-yard drive that started after the blown "fumblerooskie." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Casey Weldon put the ball on the ground for a lineman to pick up, 
but it was Auburn's Walter Tate who covered it. 
</P>
<P>
After Danley's touchdown, Weldon, who came off the bench to pass for 244 yards, 
led the Seminoles back to the Auburn 37. But on fourth and five, Weldon was 
grabbed by Ricky Sutton, stumbled backwards while trying to keep his balance 
and finally fell for a 22-yard loss with 1:04 to play. 
</P>
<P>
That led to Von Wyl's kick. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn (5-0-1), which came back from a 17-7 halftime deficit, won on a Saturday 
when two higher-ranked teams, No. 2 Miami and No. 3 Tennessee, were beaten. 
Tennessee's 9-6 loss to Alabama was particularly important to Auburn, moving 
the Tigers into sole possession of first place in the Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State (4-2) had its national championship hopes dashed as Auburn 
snapped a three-game losing streak in the series. 
</P>
<P>
Weldon, who had passed for only 223 yards in Florida State's first five games, 
entered the game late in the first quarter forstarter Brad Johnson and sparked 
the Seminoles to 17 second-quarter points. 
</P>
<P>
He directed a 10-play, 48-yard drive completed by Richie Andrews' 22-yard field 
goal with 12:02 remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
That seemed to spark the Florida State defense, which held Auburn to ae first 
down the rest of the half. 
</P>
<P>
The Seminoles, meanwhile, scored touchdowns on the next two possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Edgar Bennett went over from the one with 7:19 left in the second quarter, 
capping a drive keyed by a 30-yard pass from Weldon to Shannon Baker. 
</P>
<P>
With 1:40 left before halftime, tailback Amp Lee took a screen pass from Weldon 
on the right side, split four defenders and raced untouched 48 yards to give 
the Seminoles a 17-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn's only score of the first half was set up by Terrell Buckley's fumbled 
punt at the Florida State 46. Five plays later, Tony Richardson went in from 
the five.

<P>
Alabama came up with an unorthodox way to generate some offense in the midst of 
a defensive struggle, and Philip Doyle made it pay off. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a 9-6 Alabama upset of No. 3 Tennessee Saturday at Knoxville, 
Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The offense came in the form of a blocked field-goal attempt with 1:35 left in 
the game. The ball bounced hard off the chest of the Crimson Tide's Stacy 
Harrison and bounced 23 yards downfield to the Tennessee 37. 
</P>
<P>
Four plays later, Doyle won it with a 47-yard field goal, his third of the 
game, as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
"When the ball was blocked, when I saw the ball rolling past the 50-yard line, 
I knew it was a victory all the way," Harrison said. "We have one of the best, 
if not the best, kickers in the nation. The whole team has a lot of confidence 
in him." 
</P>
<P>
It was a big victory for Alabama Coach Gene Stallings, whose team improved to 
3-3 overall and 2-2 in the Southeastern Conference. Tennessee fell to 4-1-2 and 
2-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
The blocked field goal "worked out great for us," Stallings said. "It gave us 
30 or 40 yards when we needed offense. It was great to get that. We hadn't made 
that much in a while." 
</P>
<P>
Doyle called it "the biggest kick of my life." 
</P>
<P>
"Every kid dreams of winning the game on the last play, and to do it my senior 
year against the No. 3 team in the country is the most unbelieveable feeling 
I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
Defense dominated on both sides. Alabama held Tennessee to 175 yards, and the 
Crimson Tide offense managed 222. 
</P>
<P>
Doyle had field goals of 30 and 26 yards earlier in the game. Tennessee's Greg 
Burke had a 20-yarder in the first quarter and a career-best 51-yarder five 
minutes into the final quarter that tied the score, 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee had a nation-leading, 12-game unbeaten streak halted. 
</P>
<P>
No. 17 Florida 59, Akron 0 -- The Gators, coming off a 45-3 loss to Tennessee, 
bounced back with an easy victory over outmanned Akron at Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Shane Matthews paced an offense that produced 595 yards, completing 
20 of 32 passes for 283 yards and three touchdowns. Willie McClendon rushed for 
105 yards and one score. 
</P>
<P>
The Gators have a week off and then play No. 5 Auburn on Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Akron (3-4-1) gained only 87 yards against Florida and didn't make a first down 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The victory before a homecoming crowd of 74,558 at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium 
improved Florida's record to 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Akron lost quarterback Jeff Sweitzer to a shoulder separation in the second 
quarter and Coach Gerry Faust played reserves most of the second half. "We have 
some important games left and we didn't want to get anyone else hurt," Faust 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia 39, Vanderbilt 28 -- Garrison Hearst rushed for 127 yards and two 
touchdowns and Joe Dupree and Andre Hastings connected on a 68-yard touchdown 
pass play for the Bulldogs in an SEC game at Athens, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs (4-3, 2-2) also got a 58-yard touchdown run from Larry Ware and 
John Kasay kicked field goals of 38 and 48 yards. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 21st consecutive SEC road loss for the Commodores (1-5, 1-3), who 
had cut Georgia's lead to 33-28 four plays before Dupree, making his first 
appearance of the year, connected with Hastings on the long scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
LSU 30, Kentucky 20 -- Harvey Williams rushed for a career-high 213 yards in 28 
carries, scored on a 60-yard run, and caught a four-yard touchdown pass to lead 
Louisiana State (4-2, 2-2) over the Wildcats (2-5, 1-2) at Baton Rogue, La. 
</P>
<P>
Williams had 155 yards by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
LSU also got three field goals from Pedro Suarez, and Chad Loup, a redshirt 
freshman, passed to Todd Kinchen on a 45-yard touchdown pass play. 
</P>
<P>
No. 18 Mississippi 42, Arkansas State 13 -- Randy Baldwin scored four 
touchdowns in the first 19 minutes as Ole Miss routed the Division I-AA Indians 
at Oxford, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels (6-1) rolled up 495 yards, one shy of their season high. They also 
ensured a second consecutive winning season, the first time Ole Miss has 
accomplished that since 1970-71.

SOUTH ROUNDUP;

<P>
THE CITADEL BEATS SOUTH CAROLINA FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1950, 38-35

<P>
Quarterback Jack Douglas scored from the one on fourth down with 22 seconds 
left to give The Citadel a stunning 38-35 victory over South Carolina Saturday 
at Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Division I-AA Bulldogs' first victory over South Carolina since 1950 
and first in Columbia since 1919. It was also the Gamecocks' first loss to a 
I-AA opponent since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas rushed for 104 yards and completed seven of nine passes for 125 yards 
in directing the Bulldogs' wishbone attack. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time South Carolina had seen the wishbone since 1977 -- and it 
showed. The Citadel moved the ball at will, gaining 396 yards against the 
fourth-ranked defense in the nation, which had been giving up just 232 yards a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs (4-3) scored 10 points in the final 3:11 to earn the victory 
before a stunned crowd of 63,000 at Williams-Brice Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
After The Citadel made it 35-31 on Howard Barnard's 37-yard field goal, 
Torrence Forney recovered the ensuing onside kick for the Bulldogs at the South 
Carolina 41-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas hooked up with Terrance Young on a 24-yard pass to the 16. Douglas 
fumbled on the next play, but the Bulldogs recovered at the 10. Douglas scored 
four plays later. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina Coach Sparky Woods said the Gamecocks (4-2) weren't looking past 
the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
"This game was a heartbreaker," he said. "They're a tough football team." 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina had enough yards (480) on offense to win, just not enough 
points. 
</P>
<P>
No. 22 Clemson 24, North Carolina State 17 -- The Tigers needed every advantage 
their nationally- ranked defense could provide to escape with an Atlantic Coast 
Conference victory over the Wolfpack at Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
The struggle between Clemson, ranked second in total defense, and the Wolfpack, 
ranked seventh, featured seven fumbles -- four by N.C. State. The third fumble 
set up fullback Howard Hall's one-yard touchdown with 3:02 left that gave the 
Tigers the win. The fourth came on the ensuing kickoff, with Clemson's David 
Joy recovering. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson, 6-2 overall and 3-2 in the ACC, and N.C. State (4-4, 2-4) were tied, 
17-17, after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson's Ronald Williams fumbled inside the Wolfpack 20 with 5:05 left, but 
N.C. State quarterback Terry Jordan returned the favor three plays later to 
give the Tigers the ball at the 11. Hall scored two plays later. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State rolled up 328 yards against a defense that has been 
allowing an average of 202 a game. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson quarterback DeChane Cameron completed 14 of 26 passes for 182 yards and 
Williams rushed for 95 yards in 26 carries, 87 yards coming in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland 23, Duke 20 -- Dan DeArmas kicked three field goals in the second 
half, including the game-winning 20-yarder with 50 seconds left, as the 
Terrapins (3-4, 0-3) held off the Blue Devils (3-4, 0-3) in an ACC game at 
Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Devil quarterback Billy Ray had thrown a 27-yard touchdown pass to Walter 
Jones with 12 minutes left to tie the score, 20-20. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Mississippi 23, Memphis State 7 -- Brett Favre's passing set up a pair 
of touchdowns and Jim Taylor kicked three field goals to lead the Golden Eagles 
(6-2) over the Tigers (3-3-1) at Hattiesburg, Miss. Southern Mississippi held 
Memphis State to 191 yards and 11 first downs.

TEXAS BLOWS PAST ARKANSAS IN 4TH QUARTER, 49-17

<P>
Texas handled a strong wind, Arkansas didn't and that was a major difference 
Saturday as the 19th-ranked Longhorns blew away the Razorbacks, 49-17. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Peter Gardere guided Texas to four touchdowns, throwing for one 
score and running for another, to cap two 80-yard drives into a wind that 
gusted as high as 38 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The victory before 72,657 and a regional television audience raised Texas' 
record to 4-1, 2-0 in the Southwest Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas, which will switch to the Southeastern Conference for the 1992 
football season, fell to 2-4 and 0-3 in the SWC. 
</P>
<P>
"We moved the ball pretty well against the wind. That was a turning point," 
Texas Coach David McWilliams said. 
</P>
<P>
Leading 20-17 after three quarters, the Longhorns rolled up 29 points with the 
wind at their backs for their largest point total against Arkansas since they 
defeated the Razorbacks, 52-0, in 1916. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of things went wrong and they went wrong late. Our plan was to win the 
game in the fourth quarter," said Arkansas Coach Jack Crowe, the first-year 
coach at Arkansas who has yet to win a conference game. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Walker's two-yard scoring run climaxed a 48-yard touchdown march as 
Texas widened its lead to 27-17 in the fourth quarter, and a four-yard run by 
freshman Butch Hadnot with 10:20 to go sealed the victory.

WYOMING IS 8-0 AFTER WIN OVER STUBBORN WEBER STATE

<P>
Unbeaten Wyoming has the most victories in the nation, but stubborn Weber State 
made earning that honor tougher than expected Saturday in a nonconference game 
at Laramie, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Corontzos passed for two touchdowns and Dwight Driver rushed for 105 yards 
and a touchdown as the No. 21 Cowboys held off Weber State, 21-12, to improve 
to 8-0. 
</P>
<P>
Weber State (4-4), an NCAA Division I-AA school, outgained the Cowboys, 427 
yards to 347. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play like we should play with a record like ours," Wyoming Coach 
Paul Roach said. "We thought we were going to be capable enough to dominate 
this game and we didn't. I have an empty feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Wyoming led only 7-6 at halftime and didn't put the game away until Corontzos, 
who completed 17 of 31 passes for 206 yards, connected with Robert Rivers on a 
29-yard touchdown pass play with 1:30 left. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 37, Texas El Paso 23 -- Mike Richmond came off the bench and passed for 
three touchdowns to lead the Utes in a Western Athletic Conference game at Salt 
Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Utah, 3-4 overall and 1-3 in the WAC, snapped a four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
UTEP (3-5, 1-4) led 16-13 midway through the third quarter before Utah scored 
24 consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State 47, New Mexico 7 -- The Rams generated a school-record 607 yards 
in offense and cruised in a WAC game at Fort Collins, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Alford rushed for 116 yards and scored two touchdowns and Todd Yert scored 
three touchdowns as the Rams (5-3, 4-1) broke their old total offense mark of 
583 yards, set against Texas El Paso in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico (2-6, 1-2), which absorbed its 20th consecutive WAC road loss, had 
entered the game ranked 19th in the nation in run defense, yielding only 109.7 
yards per game. But the Rams ripped through that defense for 348 yards on the 
ground.

SOUTHWEST ROUNDUP;

<P>
KLINGLER (48 FOR 76) LEADS HOUSTON VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Houston quarterback David Klingler had a record-setting day as the No. 9 
Cougars defeated Southern Methodist, 44-17, in a Southwest Conference game 
Saturday at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Klingler completed 48 of 76 passes for 461 yards and five touchdowns, three 
going to Manny Hazard, as the Cougars extended their winning streak to 10 
games, longest among major-college teams. 
</P>
<P>
Klingler, the nation's total offense leader, broke NCAA single-game records of 
45 completions, set by Sandy Schwab of Northwestern in 1982 against Michigan, 
and 73 attempts, set in 1989 by North Carolina State's Shane Montgomery against 
Duke. 
</P>
<P>
Klingler threw touchdown passes of 17 and eight yards to John Brown in a 
20-point first quarter, then connected with Hazard on scoring passes of nine 
and seven yards in the second quarter and three yards early in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth time in six games that Klingler passed for more than 400 
yards. He had 390 in the first half, which ended with Houston leading 34-7. 
</P>
<P>
Klingler completed 17 of 29 passes for 184 yards, two touchdowns and a 20-0 
lead in the first quarter alone. Houston was going into a stiff breeze, but the 
Cougars benefited from three SMU fumbles and an interception. 
</P>
<P>
Houston Coach John Jenkins said he wasn't disappointed his team fell short of 
its 1,000-yard performance of last year, when Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware 
quarterbacked a 95-21 thumping of an SMU team coming off two years of 
NCAA-imposed inactivity. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether we win by one point or 200-0 doesn't really matter to me. All that 
matters is that we win the game," Jenkins said. "We played very well today, 
especially in the first quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins' 6-0 start is the best ever by a first-time, first-year head coach in 
the Southwest Conference. The Cougars are 5-0 in the SWC. SMU is 1-5 and 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
SMU Coach Forrest Gregg said he was proud of his players' effort. 
</P>
<P>
"When you consider that Klingler threw more passes today than any other game in 
history and we gave them six turnovers, it could have been much worse," Gregg 
said 
</P>
<P>
Roman Anderson added field goals of 27, 22 and 35 yards. 
</P>
<P>
SMU scored on Kevin Love's three-yard run in the second quarter, Brian Berry's 
seven-yard pass from Mike Romo in the third quarter and Russell Anderson's 
27-yard field goal in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Houston also set NCAA records with 52 plays, 32 completions and 48 attempts in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
No. 25 Texas A&amp;M 20, Baylor 20 -- Michael Moore scored on an 11-yard 
touchdown run and Jeff Ireland kicked the extra point with 8:23 left to lift 
Baylor to the tie in a SWC game at College Station, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Texas A&amp;M, 4-2-1 overall and 1-1-1 in the SWC, got a gift with 3:33 left 
when Moore fumbled and Quentin Coryatt of the Aggies recovered at the Baylor 
36. But the Bears (3-3-1, 2-1-1) held on three running plays by Darren Lewis, 
and Layne Talbot hooked a 46-yard field-goal attempt to the left with 1:39 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis rushed for 179 yards in 34 carries, the 23rd time in his career that he 
rushed for more than 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Texas A&amp;M led 10-6 at halftime on Talbot's booming 59-yard field goal as 
time ran out. The ball rode a 25 m.p.h wind and just made it over the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
Talbot's previous longest field goal was 46 yards. It was the third-longest in 
A&amp;M history, behind kicks of 65 and 64 yard by Tony Franklin, also against 
Baylor, in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Rice 42, Texas Tech 21 -- Quarterback Donald Hollas ran for four touchdowns and 
passed for a fifth to lead the Owls (3-4, 1-3) over the Red Raiders (2-5, 1-4) 
in an SWC game at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Hollas scored on runs of eight, five, four and five yards and added a five-yard 
scoring pass. Running back Trevor Cobb added 203 yards in 38 carries and scored 
a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The 42 points by the Owls was the most for them in a SWC game since they 
defeated Tech, 42-7, in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Southwestern Louisiana 25, Tulsa 13 -- James Freeman came off the bench to pass 
for two touchdowns in the second half to lead the Rajin' Cajuns in a 
nonconference game at Tulsa, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman completed 11 of 20 passes for 186 yards as the Rajin' Cajuns (3-4) 
ended a four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Jackson rushed for 156 yards in 33 carries and a touchdown for the 
Hurricane (1-7), which lost its sixth consecutive game.

A WILD RIDE ENDS LUKAS' SLUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With about three furlongs to run in the $107,800 Linda Vista Breeders' Cup 
Handicap Saturday at Santa Anita, Gary Stevens thought he was on another Wayne 
Lukas loser. 
</P>
<P>
Going more than a mile for the first time and able to control things on the 
front end, Mahaska opened up on A Wild Ride and Stevens approaching the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was running for second money," said the nation's leading rider. 
"When (Mahaska) shot away at the three-eighths pole, I thought it was all 
over." 
</P>
<P>
A bit later, it was Lukas' winless streak at Oak Tree that was over. 
</P>
<P>
After appearing to be home free, Mahaska, an 8-1 shot, faded in the final 
furlong and A Wild Ride took full advantage, drawing away to win by 2 3/4 
lengths in 1:42 for the 1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, the 3-year-old Wild Again filly provided Lukas with his first 
victory of the meeting after 38 misses. Orlanova, the 9-2 second choice, 
completed the exacta, moving past Mahaska in the final yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew the law of averages was going to catch up pretty soon," Stevens said of 
Lukas' slump. Dallas Stewart, a Lukas assistant, saddled A Wild Ride for her 
fourth victory in 14 appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"Even at the quarter pole, I didn't think I had a shot," Stevens said. "But the 
other filly hit a brick wall between the eighth and sixteenth poles and mine 
finished nice and steady. 
</P>
<P>
"It surprises me that this filly has done so well sprinting because she feels 
like a mile and quarter filly. She's got that kind of stride. She feels like a 
typical turf filly." 
</P>
<P>
Orlanova, an improving daughter of Conquistador Cielo, rallied from last to be 
second. Although she might be better on the turf, she demonstrated she can 
handle either surface. 
</P>
<P>
"She feels good on both the dirt and the grass," jockey Robbie Davis said. "She 
got off a little slow and I wasn't able to get any position going into the 
first turn. The best thing was I was able to save ground. She finished real 
well." 
</P>
<P>
As did Stevens, jockey Gary Boulanger thought Mahaska was going to score her 
fourth consecutive victory at her fourth track. Previously, she had won stakes 
at Exhibition Park in Canada, Los Alamitos and Fairplex Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I really liked my chances at the five-sixteenths pole," Boulanger said. "But 
at the eighth pole, she started to really shorten up. With a route under her 
belt, she's going to improve. I was really pleased with the way she relaxed 
going 1 1/16 miles for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
Boulanger, who tried unsuccessfully to break into the local jockey colony last 
winter, said he will try again. He was the leading rider at Longacres with 196 
victories. "My agent from up there (Washington), Stan Puhich, is here with me," 
he said. Boulanger and Mahaska's trainer, Mike Puhich, came back to win the 
ninth race with 14-1 shot Honest John.

<P>
Dead Heat, the longest shot in the field at 18-1, was fourth in the Linda 
Vista, followed by Variety Spice, Lifthigh The Cross, Nasers Pride, Vaguely 
Charming and Mama Simba. 
</P>
<P>
Proving his fondness once more for the Bay Meadows turf course, The Medic beat 
Pleasant Variety to win the $100,000 Tanforan Handicap Saturday in a race 
simulcast at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Ridden by Ron Warren Jr. and trained by Gary Jones, The Medic's ninth victory 
in 38 lifetime starts was his second at Bay Meadows in seven weeks. On Sept. 3, 
he beat Mister Sicy and Shining Steel by two lengths in the San Francisco 
Handicap. In between he had finished third at Santa Anita in the race won by 
Exclusive Partner, who equaled the world record for 1 1/8 miles on grass. 
</P>
<P>
His victory Saturday wasn't so clear cut. With less than a furlong to run, four 
of the five entrants -- The Medic, Pleasant Variety, Esker Island and Variety 
Road -- were spread across the track, but the first two asserted their 
superiority in the final yards. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-5 favorite locally, The Medic, a 6-year-old son of Sweet Candy, paid 
$4.80 here and $5.20 up north. The $55,000 check pushed his earnings to 
$821,530 for owner Edward Giammarino.

Prepping for Saturday's Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, Lite Light worked six 
furlongs in 1:14 1/5 Saturday morning for trainer Henry Moreno. The Majestic 
Light filly was the easy winner of the Oak Leaf in her last start. . . . 
Fourteen casino race books in Nevada handled $211,263 Saturday as they began 
commingling their wagering pools with Santa Anita's. This allows patrons at the 
race books the opportunity to bet on Oak Tree races without limits on the size 
of wager or odds and allows them to participate in the Pick Six and Pick Nine. 
Canterbury Downs and Birmingham Turf Club began commingling Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
For the record: The first California Cup will be held Nov. 3, not Oct. 27. . . 
. Due to longshots Distinctive Noble, Record Hitter, Serious Toy and Grand 
Award, no one was able to select six or even five winners in the Pick Six. 
There is a carryover of $97,813.29. There will also be a mandatory payout in 
the Pick Nine. . . . Russell Baze rode three winners.

<P>
All the Calgary Flames needed to break out of their scoring slump was a team 
with a slumping defense like the Boston Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, coming off an 8-1 beating in Edmonton on Friday night, were drubbed 
by the same score in Calgary on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
It was a fitting ending to a nightmarish road trip for Boston. The Bruins ended 
a seven-game, two-week road swing with five out of a possible 14 points 
(2-4-1). 
</P>
<P>
The Flames, lukewarm for the first seven games this season, scored five 
first-period goals. Defenseman Al MacInnis had two goals and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Robert Reichel scored his first NHL goal for the Flames. Calgary's Mark 
Hunter pleased a sellout crowd with a power-play goal and an assist. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Ranheim and Brian MacLellan got Calgary rolling in the first period with 
goals eight seconds apart, Ranheim's coming on a power play. Stephane Matteau 
and MacInnis also scored in the first, ending goaltender Andy Moog's 
nightmarish game. He was replaced by Rejean Lemelin. 
</P>
<P>
The victory improved Calgary's Smythe Division record to 5-3-0 for 10 points, 
three behind the first-place Kings. The Bruins are 4-4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec 5, Detroit 3 -- Joe Sakic had two goals and an assist and rookie 
goaltender John Tanner beat the Red Wings at Quebec for his first NHL victory. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hough, Michel Petit and Lucien DeBlois also scored for the Nordiques 
(3-3-3). Shawn Burr, Brent Fedyk and Dave Barr scored for the Red Wings 
(4-3-2). 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 3, New York Islanders 1 -- Rick Vaive and Donald Audette scored 
power-play goals 31 seconds apart in the second period as the Sabres beat the 
Islanders at Uniondale, N.Y., for their first victory of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Clint Malarchuk faced only 20 shots for the Sabres (1-4-3). Wayne McBean scored 
the only goal for the Islanders (2-5-0) in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 5, Montreal 3 -- Scott Mellanby's goal 7:46 into the third period 
broke a tie and helped the Flyers beat the Canadiens for their sixth 
consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Pelle Ecklund added a goal at 13:25 to wrap up the scoring for the Flyers 
(6-2-0). Tom Chorske, Stephane Richer and Russ Courtnall scored for Montreal 
(4-4-1). 
</P>
<P>
New York Rangers 4, Pittsburgh 3 -- Brian Bullen scored the game-winner with 
3:17 to play in the Rangers' victory at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth victory in the past seven games for the Rangers (6-3-0). The 
Penguins are 3-4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 4, New Jersey 0 -- Don Beaupre stopped 27 shots and Calle Johansson 
scored two goals to lead the Capitals at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first shutout for the Capitals (4-5-0) against New Jersey (5-3-1) 
since February 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 6, Chicago 2 -- Gary Leerman, a 51-goal scorer in 1989-90, scored his 
first of the season as the Maple Leafs won their first game at the expense of 
the Blackhawks at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Thornton, Rob Ramage, Wendel Clark, Kevin Maguire and Vince Damphouse 
also scored for Toronto (1-6-1), who had managed only four goals in their 
previous three games. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Gilbert and Troy Murray scored for Chicago (5-4-0), which had a 41-30 
advantage in shooting. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 2, Minnesota 2 -- Dave Gagner's goal with 9:52 to play helped the 
North Stars gain a tie with the Blues at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
The Blues (4-3-1) had taken a 2-1 lead on power-play goals 31 seconds apart by 
Gino Cavallini and Cliff Ronning in the second period, but could not hold off 
the North Stars (1-5-2).

AGOURA'S DROSSIN TIES COURSE MARK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Deena Drossin of Agoura High tied a course record in winning the girls' team 
sweepstakes race at the Mt. San Antonio College Cross-Country Invitational in 
Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
Drossin, a senior, finished the three-mile course in 17 minutes 16 seconds, 
equaling the girls' course record set by Kirsten O'Hara of Palos Verdes in 
1983. Veronica Barajas of Channel Islands was second in 18:02. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura won the girls' team sweepstakes with 61 points. San Diego Mt. Carmel 
finished second with 91 points. 
</P>
<P>
Louie Quintana of Arroyo Grande, one of the nation's top high school 
cross-country runners, won the boys' team sweepstakes race in a personal best 
at Mt. SAC of 14:40, making him the fifth-fastest runner ever at Mt. SAC. David 
Hartmann of Canyon Country Canyon finished second in 14:51. 
</P>
<P>
Madera of the Central Section won the boys' team sweepstakes with 96 points and 
Newhall Hart was second with 161. Arroyo Grande finished fifth with 192. 
</P>
<P>
The Mt. SAC Invitational is the largest cross-country meet in the West, with 
more than 300 high schools and 7,000 runners competing Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Drossin nor Quintana has been defeated this season. Drossin, 17, is the 
defending state Division I and Southern Section Division 2-A champion. 
Quintana, 17, finished second at both the state Division I and Southern Section 
2-A finals last year. 
</P>
<P>
Drossin has run the hilly Mt. SAC course many times during her high school 
career, but her time Saturday was 18 seconds better than her previous personal 
best. She led from start to finish, widening her lead over Barajas by 30 
seconds during the second mile of the race. 
</P>
<P>
After the race, Drossin was told she had been timed in 17:18. She said she was 
disappointed because she wanted to break the record. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal coming in here today was to set the record," Drossin said. "I just 
wanted to go out and run the best race I ever have. I'm happy with my 
performance. I felt good the whole way. It would have been nice to have been 
pushed at the end, but I still did OK." 
</P>
<P>
Quintana also led the entire race, but he was pushed by Hartmann, who trailed 
by 12 seconds after the first mile and 15 seconds after the second mile. He 
made up time on the last half-mile of the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I really had to turn the jets on coming over that last hill," Quintana said. 
"I knew David was going to challenge me, but I didn't expect this much of a 
challenge. I beat him by 19 seconds earlier this season, so he closed some 
ground today." 
</P>
<P>
James Menon of San Luis Obispo won the boys' individual sweepstakes in 15:28, 
and Jeanine Rothman of Westlake won the girls' individual sweepstakes in 17:25 
to become the third-fastest runner of all-time at Mt. SAC.

COST OF WATER GOES UP 65% IN MARINA DEL REY; 
</P>
<P>
UTILITIES: THE INCREASE MAY BE PASSED ON THROUGH HIGHER RENTS TO APARTMENT 
TENANTS AND SMALL-BUSINESS OPERATORS, SAYS SPOKESMAN FOR LESSEES GROUP. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The cost of water is going up 65% in Marina del Rey to pay for replacing the 
harbor community's aging water lines. 
</P>
<P>
The higher rate, approved by the County Board of Supervisors last week, will be 
paid by the business interests that hold long-term leases with the county on 
large land holdings in the marina. 
</P>
<P>
The rate increases are retroactive to Oct. 1 and may be passed on in the form 
of higher rents to apartment tenants and small-business operators, said Bob 
Leslie, spokesman for the Marina del Rey Lessees Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new rate, a typical restaurant will see its water bill jump from 
$4,900 to $8,200 a year, and an apartment building from $12,700 to $20,900, 
said Jim Noyes, deputy director of public works for the county. 
</P>
<P>
The higher rate will be imposed for at least 20 years, to raise the $11.6 
million that it will cost to replace all water mains in Marina del Rey and to 
build a 4-million gallon storage tank. 
</P>
<P>
The construction is needed because the community's original water system is 
more than 25 years old, county officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Pipes laid in about 1963 corroded quickly because of their contact with 
saltwater, Noyes said. And the old system was built when building heights in 
the marina were limited to two stories, before high-rise developments requiring 
more sewage capacity were built around the small-craft harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Work on the improvements is expected to begin in 1992 and continue for about 10 
years. The first phase will replace pipes supplying water to the harbor's boat 
docks. Next will come construction of the storage tank, to provide reserves for 
the community. The tank will actually be built up the water line, on a hillside 
in Malibu, and connected by existing pipes to the marina. Finally, the Public 
Works Department will replace water mains beneath Marina del Rey's streets. 
</P>
<P>
"We need all this work because of the additional construction already made in 
the marina and the building that is anticipated," Noyes said. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie said Marina del Rey business people understand the need for the 
improvements, but that the cost is hard to absorb because it comes just as 
property tax bills with higher sewer assessments begin arriving in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors in May approved an increase from $120 to $270 per year for each 
customer who produces sewage equivalent to a single-family home. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything seems to be going sky high," Leslie said. 
</P>
<P>
The higher sewer charges are to pay for improvements to the Hyperion Treatment 
Plant near El Segundo, Noyes said.

BOOK PUBLICITY PROMOTES HATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zev Yaroslavsky is correct in questioning the city's Cultural Affairs 
Department as to whether vendors should knowingly peddle hate and false tales 
at events that have public support and financing (Times, Oct. 14). However, 
quiet diplomacy would have been a more effective way than the heavy public 
barrage to handle the described situation. 
</P>
<P>
As reported, the African Marketplace held at Rancho Cienega Park over the Aug. 
25 and Sept. 3 weekends attracted more than 150,000 people to a fair, and about 
200 vendors participated. That one vendor with 500 books on sale had two tracts 
that promote hate and violence against Jews didn't warrant the public attention 
The Times story gave it. The result could have been predicted. A First 
Amendment debate that would overshadow the individual lack of sensitivity on a 
matter of mutual concern over the effects of hate literature. 
</P>
<P>
If the two offensive books are gaining "popularity," then the agencies fighting 
anti-Semitism better go back to the basics of how to deal with such matters. 
Focus public attention on what needs to be spotlighted, and not become part of 
its promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Ford's book on "The International Jew" was based on the false, libelous, 
ludicrous "Protocols" of the non-existent "Elders of Zion," tied to a myth of 
the non-Jewish Masonic Order control of world power. The absurdity is 
self-evident in what has happened to Jews in pogrom after pogrom, and under 
Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
The "Protocols" were judged to be a forgery by a Swiss Court, fabricated by 
Czarist Russian agents to spread anti-Semitism. Henry Ford was sued for his 
book, apologized, withdrew it, and made restitution.

FRUSTRATED OPPONENTS RAIL AGAINST LACK OF DEBATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Election opponents of two Westside lawmakers went public last week with their 
frustration at being unable to draw the incumbents into a debate. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) and Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa 
Monica) are both heavily favored for reelection Nov. 6. As favorites frequently 
do, they have generally ignored their challengers. 
</P>
<P>
At separate news events Thursday, the challengers called the refusals to debate 
an indication that Hayden and Beilenson don't want voters to hear them discuss 
the issues. 
</P>
<P>
"(Tom Hayden's) a political coward," said Fred Beteta, the Republican candidate 
for Hayden's 44th District Assembly seat, at a press conference on the steps of 
the Santa Monica City Hall. "If he's so sure that he's going to get reelected, 
why is he so afraid to enter into a debate with a challenger?" 
</P>
<P>
Beteta said he sent Hayden's campaign a letter by registered mail Oct. 2 
inviting him to "open things up by having a debate on the issues," but never 
received a reply. 
</P>
<P>
But Hayden campaign chairman Tom Soto said he wrote Beteta suggesting a 
conversation on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't contacted me," Soto said. "Quite frankly, I'd appreciate a 
conversation before he goes and makes any accusations like that." 
</P>
<P>
Joining Beteta at the Thursday press conference was Libertarian Rebecca Donner, 
19, a Santa Monica College student. She said she also sent Hayden two letters 
inviting him to debate, and they were ignored. Soto said he was not aware of 
the campaign's having received any letters from Donner. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want this to become another ho-hum, rubber-stamp election," Donner 
said. "And I find it deplorable that Tom Hayden thinks he's got it in the bag." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Salomon, the Republican candidate for the 23rd Congressional District, has 
tried to take a more creative approach in his attempts to arrange a debate with 
Beilenson, who has held the Westside-San Fernando Valley seat since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, he was in Beilenson's Tarzana office to deliver a 3-by-5 foot 
invitation urging the congressman to debate with him. Accompanying Salomon was 
a campaign volunteer dressed as Abraham Lincoln and carrying a sign saying, "I 
debated Douglas, why can't Beilenson debate Salomon?" 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson's press assistant in Washington said the congressman is currently 
tied up on congressional business, and has had to suspend his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there's nothing more he wants than to be in Los Angeles right now," 
said his press assistant, Kaye Edwards Davis. "He just hasn't been able to make 
any campaign plans at all." 
</P>
<P>
Salomon said he offered to pay for a satellite hookup from Washington and buy 
time on three cable television stations to air the debate. So far, Beilenson's 
staff members have said they haven't been able to schedule it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"So his basic strategy is to keep his head low and to do everything in his 
power to make it into a non-campaign," Salomon said, adding that this was "an 
anti-democratic action.

<P>
Complimenting each other as they go, five candidates are running -- but not 
very vigorously -- for four seats on the Santa Monica College Board of 
Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
No mudslinging or jockeying here. One would be hard-pressed to find a lawn sign 
or a hot controversy. The candidates figure that since there's room for almost 
everybody, there's no need to act pushy or spend lots of money. 
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't have to have as rigorous a campaign as the school board people 
have and the City Council people have," said incumbent Colin C. Petrie. "It is 
very, very, low key," 
</P>
<P>
Petrie and Carole Lundgren Currey, billing themselves as "Experienced College 
Trustees," are running for reelection. Two other board members are seeking 
other political offices: James Bambrick is running for Municipal Court judge in 
Santa Monica, and Fred Beteta is the Republican challenger to Democrat Tom 
Hayden for the 44th Assembly District seat. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent candidates' forum and in interviews, several of the candidates 
praised their competitors. "All four of them, are all excellent," George Hickey 
said. "The people cannot go wrong." 
</P>
<P>
In general, no one seems bent on rocking the boat. They are pleased with 
college President Richard Moore, the faculty, the Emeritus College that caters 
to senior citizens, the Center for Humanities and the new design school. They 
note that Santa Monica College leads all state community colleges in the 
percentage of students who transfer to the University of California system. 
</P>
<P>
The college does have some problems, the candidates say, but they are problems 
stemming from its success: Lack of space and facilities to serve a growing 
student population, and traffic congestion and parking problems that cause 
friction with neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"Our community college suffers from excellent leadership, classes, teachers and 
a beach," Hickey said. 
</P>
<P>
Growth is limited in part by state funding. Enrollment now is about 25,000, 
including part-time students. In January, the board approved a five-year, 
$25.7-million construction plan that includes expanding the library, Technology 
Building, automotive repair area, and building two parking structures. 
</P>
<P>
The parking structures are scheduled for completion in June, 1991, and will 
hold about 1,200 vehicles. The structures, plus ride-sharing and the current 
systems of permit parking for residents, off-campus lots, shuttle buses and the 
use of satellite campuses will handle the parking problem, the candidates say. 
For the long term, the college has to work with other governmental bodies on 
developing mass transportation, they say. 
</P>
<P>
All of the candidates say the college should funnel students to West Los 
Angeles College, which has "both classroom and parking space," as Petrie said. 
He said that in the past, a Santa Monica College real estate program was moved 
to West Los Angeles, and this could be done with other programs. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie and candidate Alfred T. Quinn say the college should stay at its present 
size. "There comes a point where we have to say, 'Try another community 
college,' " Quinn said at a recent forum. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Currey and candidate Ralph R. Villani say they are concerned about 
turning students away. "Our obligation is to provide education for those who 
require it or want it," said Currey, adding that, "I think we're good 
neighbors, but we don't have control over everything." 
</P>
<P>
Villani said the college should explore ways of offering more classes via 
television and computer so students would not have to come to campus as often. 
Hickey favors "freezing (growth), maybe even decreasing it over time." 
</P>
<P>
He said the college should put limits on students who "perennially take classes 
without passing them because the classes are so cheap. . . . They are not 
serious students" and they tie up classroom space, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the candidates agree that the college should make efforts to improve 
communication with the community. 
</P>
<P>
Hickey said, for example, that neighbors were informed too late of the 
college's opening its Center for Humanities in a former elementary school on 
Arizona Avenue. The college began hosting public meetings on its plans in 
August, a month before school started, even though it had been been negotiating 
a lease with the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District for more than a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Villani said residents should expect that some of the parking and traffic 
hassles come with the territory. "When you move into an area where there's a 
high school or community college, you can't just say, 'I wish it'd move away.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents Petrie and Currey say they share many ideas and have sent out some 
joint campaign literature. Petrie reported raising $1,235 as of Sept. 30 and 
Currey $1,360. 
</P>
<P>
Currey said she aims to spend about $2,000. In prior elections when there were 
more candidates and fewer seats, she spent about $4,000, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn leads in fund-raising, reporting $5,227 raised as of Oct. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Villani said he plans to spend less than $1,000, and only from his own funds. 
</P>
<P>
Hickey said he doesn't plan to spend more than $100 of his own money. 
</P>
<P>
Here are brief sketches of the candidates and their positions. The candidates 
are listed in the order they will appear on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Carole Lundgren Currey, a bank secretary, has been on the board since 1979. She 
is on the legislative committee of the California Community College Trustees 
Assn., which reviews and makes recommendations on bills. Her children attended 
SMC. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to continue the good work that's going on at the college," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She is endorsed by the Santa Monica College Classified Forum, the board of 
directors of the non-teaching employees; by Concerned Homeowners of Santa 
Monica, and by City Council candidates Christine Reed, Donna Alvarez and Robert 
Holbrook. 
</P>
<P>
George Hickey is a clinical engineer who advises hospitals on high-technology 
equipment. Hickey wants the college to increase its emphasis on remedial 
education to reach "the kids that may have dropped out of high school and . . . 
probably are in gangs." 
</P>
<P>
Saying Santa Monica residents are being turned away from classes at times, he 
said the college needs to ensure that "as much emphasis is given to registering 
people locally as outside the area." 
</P>
<P>
Hickey is on the Virginia Park Advisory board. He is endorsed by the New Deal 
Democratic Club, Americans for Democratic Action, Concerned Homeowners of Santa 
Monica, and council candidates Reed, Alvarez and Holbrook. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph R. Villani, assistant superintendent for personnel at the Culver City 
Unified School District, says it is unfair that UC Berkeley and UCLA have 
raised their entrance requirements for transfer students. He says he will fight 
to get that policy reversed. 
</P>
<P>
He wants to clamp down on students who abuse the preferential parking spots for 
car-poolers at the college. He said security on campus must remain a high 
priority because Santa Monica High School and other schools have had problems 
with trespassers. 
</P>
<P>
He says he has no endorsements and is running as an independent. He attended 
Pasadena City College. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred T. Quinn has been a professor, counselor, affirmative action officer and 
dean of student services at SMC. When he retired in 1988, some of his former 
students established scholarships in his name at the college. 
</P>
<P>
The college must adapt to the "changing demographics in the '90s," including 
increasing numbers of diverse ethnic groups, immigrants and single parents, he 
says. It should give "as much priority to the vocational programs as we do to 
the academic program," and offer courses for people who are trying to retrain 
for another job. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn has chaired the Santa Monica Housing and Parks and Recreation 
commissions. He is endorsed by the Santa Monica Democratic Club, the New Deal 
Democratic Club and the college's Classified Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Colin C. Petrie taught mathematics at the college from 1955 to 1974. He has 
been on the board since 1977, except for 1981-83, when he did not run for a 
term. His daughter attended SMC before transferring to a four-year college. 
</P>
<P>
The college, he says, should continue active recruitment in the high schools of 
"minority students who . . . are hesitant about coming because they don't think 
they've got the qualifications (or) the finances to do it." 
</P>
<P>
He said he is pleased with the automotive, nursing and other vocational 
programs and says that the college's main mission is to transfer as many people 
to higher education as possible. 
</P>
<P>
He is endorsed by the Santa Monica College Classified Forum, the board of 
directors of the non-teaching employees; by Concerned Homeowners of Santa 
Monica, and by City Council candidates Christine Reed, Donna Alvarez and Robert 
Holbrook.

EDELMAN ISSUES CALL FOR PRECINCT OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing an urgent need, Supervisor Ed Edelman has issued a call for citizens to 
act as precinct workers and to provide and operate polling places in the Nov. 6 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the Los Angeles County registrar-recorder's office, I am asking 
public-spirited citizens to volunteer their time, and or businesses, to help us 
on Election Day this fall," Edelman, whose supervisorial district covers much 
of the Westside, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Precinct officers are responsible for poll operations. Their duties include 
verifying voters' eligibility, issuing ballots, opening and closing the polls 
and delivering completed ballots to neighborhood check-in centers so they can 
be transported to election headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
According to Edelman, precinct workers receive between $25 and $55 depending on 
what they do. Those interested in participating may call the Polls Section of 
the registrar-recorder's office at (213) 725-5940, Monday through Friday, from 
8 a.m. to 5 p.m..

EMPLOYERS, WORKERS ACT TO FIGHT JOB HARASSMENT; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: CLAIMS BY MEN AND WOMEN ARE GROWING RAPIDLY. COMPANIES ARE SETTING FORMAL 
POLICIES, HIRING SPECIALISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Cinnamon Renfro, Sheila McCauley, Tammy Wilson and Holly Miller were new on the 
job at a sales office in Santa Fe Springs when their supervisor started paying 
attention to them. But they say it wasn't the kind of attention they expected. 
</P>
<P>
The women allege in a Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit that before leaving 
their jobs as account executives this summer, they endured weeks of harassment 
by a company manager. 
</P>
<P>
The women alleged that he made vulgar comments regarding his sexual fantasies 
in phone calls to their homes, locked them -- sometimes two at a time -- in his 
office, where he tore at their clothes, forced them to watch pornographic 
videos, and refused to allow them to leave until he had performed lewd acts in 
front of them. He allegedly threatened them with firing, and one said he told 
them he could "easily break someone's neck" because he was a martial arts 
expert. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't concentrate on my job because I was always looking around to make 
sure I wasn't left alone with him," said Renfro, who says she had nightmares 
and was so fearful she slept with a gun on her night stand before quitting her 
job. "I cried all the time. I didn't know where to go for help because he was 
the director of the entire office." 
</P>
<P>
Their case is far from unique. Nationwide, thousands of women -- and some men 
-- have won millions of dollars in back pay, medical expenses and punitive 
damages for complaints ranging from lewd jokes and unwelcomed love letters, to 
hugs, kisses and even rape. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights attorneys say sexual harassment cases, once considered risky, have 
become more attractive to litigate as a result of court decisions clarifying 
the issue and making employers liable for the action of their employees. 
</P>
<P>
The number of cases is rising in California, where the Department of Fair 
Employment and Housing said that sexual harassment complaints now make up 20% 
of the caseload, compared to only 3% a decade ago. In 1989, the latest figures 
available, there were 1,441 sexual harassment cases filed with the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission handled 5,216 
cases of sexual harassment last year. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Laura Best, whose Palo Alto law firm defends companies, said sexual 
harassment suits are now the most popular type of suit filed by employees aside 
from age discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"Its a hot topic legally right now," said Best. "We are seeing a large increase 
in the number of cases filed." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, in what is believed to be the largest damage award ever 
given in California in a sexual harassment suit, an Alameda County jury awarded 
$480,000 to a clerical worker who claimed she had been raped by her supervisor 
at an Oakland law firm. The jury found that the law firm was liable for failing 
to investigate the incident and taking no disciplinary action against the 
supervisor. The firm said it will appeal, noting that the judgment could force 
it into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
The complaints have proliferated not only because more women are in the 
workplace, but because there are now more women with toeholds on the corporate 
ladder. 
</P>
<P>
Women have decided that they "don't have to put up with it anymore," said 
Alison Wetherfield, with the New York-based NOW Legal Defense and Education 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 study by Working Woman magazine found that 90% of the Fortune 500 
companies had received complaints from employees in one year. The National 
Organization for Women said that more than 80% of women it surveyed had been 
sexually harassed. 
</P>
<P>
A 1989 study found that 50% of the California Bar Assn.'s women members 
reported that they had been sexually harassed; a Pentagon survey this year 
found that two out of three women in the military report sexual harassment; and 
only last week, a U.S. Naval Academy report showed widespread sexual harassment 
of its female midshipmen. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the few studies conducted on the issue, the U.S. Merit Systems 
Protection Board found in 1981 that although 56% of all government workers -- 
men and women -- experienced persistent unwelcomed sexual attention on the job, 
only 5% filed complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Sexual harassment cuts across social, economic and racial lines, appearing in 
all kinds of workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
* In Madera County, an investigation by the Department of Fair Employment and 
Housing determined that an appraiser in the county assessor's office had been 
sexually harassed by her supervisor. On one occasion, while out in the field, 
he tried to kiss her, and when she ducked away he pinned her to the ground. He 
contended that the kisses were "given in love, not lust." The man was fired, 
but later reinstated because he had no previous disciplinary problems. She 
alleged that he continued giving her love letters. She quit her job and last 
April won $186,000 in damages. The county is appealing, saying there was no 
harassment after he returned to the job. 
</P>
<P>
* A woman receptionist at the Los Angeles accounting firm of Guill, 
Blankenbajker &amp; Lawson won $30,000 in damages in October, 1989, after the 
California Department of Fair Employment and Housing determined that she had 
suffered significant emotional injury because one of the firm's partners had 
harassed her over a period of six years. The woman, who worked alone in a 
cramped cubicle, testified that the partner told her he had a foot fetish and 
got down on his hands and knees and kissed her feet while she was answering 
calls. The company said that her witnesses were biased and noted that she 
stayed on the job. The firm is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
* The Department of Fair Employment and Housing last July awarded $5,000 in 
damages to a saleswoman at TMC Motorsports in Monterey who testified that her 
boss suggested that she let men customers look up her dress, called her 
"trashy" and "stupid" in front of customers, told false stories about her sex 
life, made obscene jokes and threw tennis balls over the partition between 
their offices hitting her in the head. He also told her, "You have to be nice 
to me. I'm your boss." The supervisor denied that he had engaged in such 
conduct. TMC's owner said she had never heard him make harassing remarks. They 
claimed the accuser "had an ax to grind" because of a disputed sales 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
As more and more companies find themselves caught in the middle of these 
disputes, many have instituted formal written policies against sexual 
harassment, hired human relations experts to handle and investigate complaints, 
and provided special training sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very delicate area to handle," said Best. "We see growing awareness and 
companies much more sensitive to implementing good policies and educating 
management." 
</P>
<P>
Sexual harassment has developed as a legal issue relatively recently. 
</P>
<P>
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act made sexual discrimination illegal, but 
sexual harassment did not become a major issue in America's boardrooms and 
courtrooms until 1986, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that such harassment 
was a form of discrimination and that companies were liable for the behavior of 
their employees. 
</P>
<P>
Congress recently voted to amend Title VII so that plaintiffs claiming 
harassment can obtain jury trials in federal court and seek punitive damages. 
Some business groups have lobbied strenuously against the measure, fearing 
sky-high damage awards. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, the EEOC identified two types of harassment. The first, 
known as "quid pro quo," is unwelcome verbal and physical sexual advances that 
are a condition of employment. The second, referred to as "hostile work 
environment," involves a workplace where unwelcome sexual conduct creates an 
atmosphere that is offensive or intimidating to employees. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that "unwelcome" advances in the workplace 
constituted sex discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the state Supreme Court ruled in January that a company could be 
liable for punitive damages if an employee merely witnesses recurring 
harassment in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was based on a case in which former nurse Julie Fisher sued San 
Pedro Peninsula Hospital and a staff gynecologist claiming that she saw him 
pull nurses onto his lap, simulate sexual intercourse and make lewd comments 
about the breasts of anesthetized female patients. The case has not yet gone to 
trial and the doctor and the hospital, which said it conducted a thorough 
investigation, have denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court did not determine whether the allegations were true or not in 
the Fisher case, but told her she could go ahead with her suit if she were able 
to provide more documentation of the allegations. Her attorney has since filed 
an amended complaint. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't always companies that are sued or only women who are harassed. 
</P>
<P>
In Minneapolis, a jury awarded a male security guard $12,000 earlier this year. 
The guard brought suit against Sears, Roebuck and Co. and a woman cafeteria 
manager, who he claimed had grabbed his buttocks and made sexual comments. 
</P>
<P>
The defense argued that the security guard, who was a former Marine and boxer, 
should have been tough enough to withstand the touching without an emotional 
collapse. The plaintiff's attorney argued the man had been sexually assaulted 
as a child and had promised himself he never would be a victim again. 
</P>
<P>
Companies argue that in many cases the incidents never occurred or, if they 
did, the workers did not bring it to their attention so they could be dealt 
with in a timely fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"It often boils down to credibility, who will be believed -- the supervisor or 
the employee," said Alan Berkowitz, a San Francisco attorney. "It becomes a 
quagmire trying to determine if there was a voluntary relationship or an 
unwelcome act." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles attorney Gloria Allred, who is handling the suit the four women 
filed against their Santa Fe Springs supervisor and Rohnert Park-based 
Transworld Systems Inc., said many companies do not have policies to handle 
such complaints when they arise. She noted that employees often do not know 
where to go with their complaints within the company. And, she said, "They have 
never heard of the government agencies they should file with." 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea what to do," recalled Renfro, one of the women suing Transworld 
Systems. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Carle, Transworld's corporate counsel, said the company plans to 
"vigorously defend" the suit. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe we are an improper defendant," he said, noting that the Santa Fe 
Springs office in question is an independent contractor and the supervisor in 
question is not an employee of Transworld. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach attorney Lisa Hovden, who represents the supervisor, said her client 
would have no comment. 
</P>
<P>
Some large companies have hired human relations directors who investigate such 
claims, thus allowing workers to circumvent supervisors who often have a vested 
interest in squelching the accusations. But even that approach has had its 
problems, Best noted. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a case where the person charged with doing the harassing was the human 
relations director," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Researcher Joyce Penney contributed to this article. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHAT TO DO IF YOU'RE A VICTIM 
</P>
<P>
If you believe you have been sexually harassed on the job, contact your 
supervisor or, if the supervisor is doing the harassing, report it to that 
person's boss, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission advises. 
</P>
<P>
If the harasser is the head of the company, the EEOC says it is still important 
to request that the harassment stop. 
</P>
<P>
The agency recommends that you keep a written record of what happened, 
including when, how you responded, whether there were witnesses and the people 
you told. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk to other employees if you suspect that they, too, have been harassed," 
the EEOC recommends. "Talking to them lets them know what is happening and that 
you are upset about it." 
</P>
<P>
Even if a company takes action, you may file an administrative charge with the 
EEOC office in your district. 
</P>
<P>
Such complaints can also be filed with the California Department of Fair 
Employment and Housing. 
</P>
<P>
Most charges must be filed within 180 days of the alleged harassment. If the 
situation cannot be resolved by these agencies, you may be able to file a 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The EEOC maintains a toll free number to answer questions: 1 800 USA-EEOC.

COWBOY ACTOR JOEL MCCREA DIES AT 84 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joel McCrea, a real-life cowboy who became one of the best of Hollywood's 
make-believe saddle heroes, died Saturday at the Motion Picture and Television 
Fund Hospital in Woodland Hills. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
Eileen Singer Brown, hospital supervisor, said McCrea died at 4:50 a.m. of 
pulmonary complications. She said he had been a patient a short time, and that 
his wife of 57 years, actress Frances Dee, had been constantly at his bedside. 
</P>
<P>
McCrea's last public appearance was Oct. 1 when he attended a Beverly Hills 
fund-raising dinner for Republican Sen. Pete Wilson, who is campaigning for 
governor. Paramount Pictures executive producer A.C. Lyles, a friend of 
McCrea's for many years, said First Lady Barbara Bush went over to McCrea after 
her speech, put her hand in his hand, and said, "My hero." 
</P>
<P>
"He lit up," Lyles said. "That summed up everybody's feeling about Joel." 
</P>
<P>
Tall and taciturn, good-looking and good-humored, McCrea may have ranked just 
behind John Wayne as the most believable of Western heroes. During a career 
that spanned three decades, he made 86 motion pictures, starring in many of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Although best remembered for his cowboy roles, he was a versatile actor who 
handled frivolous light comedy and adventurous melodrama with the same skill he 
brought to Westerns. Some of his best-known films were Westerns such as "The 
Virginian," "Union Pacific" and "Wells Fargo," thrillers such as Alfred 
Hitchcock's "Foreign Correspondent," and comedies such as Preston Sturges' 
"Sullivan's Travels." 
</P>
<P>
McCrea worked in at least three pictures with his wife, one of the most sought 
after leading ladies of the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Gossip columnists often referred to their union as "an ideal Hollywood 
marriage," and it was one of the few that proved to be just that. They were 
married in 1933, and were together until his death. 
</P>
<P>
One of their three sons, Joel Dee, who is known as Jody, played the deputy in 
McCrea's 1959-60 television series "Wichita Town." 
</P>
<P>
Off screen, McCrea was as low key and down to earth as he appeared before the 
cameras -- a working rancher, a shrewd businessman and a public-spirited 
citizen active as a school board trustee in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
McCrea was born Nov. 5, 1905, in South Pasadena, the son of a successful 
executive. His Western heritage was strong: His maternal grandfather, Major 
Albert Whipple, came to California during the Gold Rush in a covered wagon, and 
his paternal grandfather, Major John McCrea, was an Indian fighter and 
stagecoach driver. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, McCrea's future wife was born only five blocks away from his South 
Pasadena home, but moved to Chicago at a very early age. They did not meet 
until both were starting their movie careers. 
</P>
<P>
The McCrea family moved to Hollywood when Joel was 8 or 9 and he then came into 
contact with film figures -- he delivered the Los Angeles Times to such moguls 
as Sam Goldwyn and Jesse Lasky, and stars such as William S. Hart and Wallace 
Reid. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned a good deal about life -- and Hollywood -- back then," McCrea 
reminisced many years later. "There were certain stars, supposed to be worth 
millions, who couldn't dig up the 60 cents, which The Times cost then, at the 
end of the month." 
</P>
<P>
Possibly because of such experiences, the lanky, adventurous youngster was less 
star-struck than horse-struck. He loved and understood horses -- and started 
hanging around the back lots of Hollywood, volunteering as a "horse-holder" for 
cowboy star Tom Mix and one of his newspaper customers, Hart. 
</P>
<P>
McCrea first went before the cameras at age 12. Ruth Roland, a star of silent 
serials, was making a shoot-'em-up in the hills above Sunset Boulevard, and 
young Joel was again a horse-holder. A New York stage actor had been brought 
out to co-star with Roland. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy could act all over the place," McCrea recalled in an interview many 
years later. "But when they brought out the horses he was scared stiff. That's 
how I got to ride his horse in a couple of shots. They dressed me up in 
buckskins and for two days' work I was paid $5. Boy, that appealed to my Scotch 
blood. I forgot about wanting to be a cowboy and decided to be an actor." 
</P>
<P>
Not long afterward, he started working summers as a cowboy on the King Cattle 
Co. ranch in the Tehachapi Mountains. He loved to tell stories about the cowboy 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"In rainy weather, I was sent to hoist mothering (pregnant) cows out of low 
places," he remembered. "It rained like sixty. I found a cow that was bogged, 
and I roped her and pulled." 
</P>
<P>
After a pause to let his drawl catch up with his anecdote, he went on: "The 
cayuse I rode wasn't too well broken -- he decided to turn around, fast, four 
times. One end of the rope was wound around the cow's horns, the other tied to 
my saddle-horn. I was in the middle. After almost being cut in two, I freed 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
It was then, he said, that he came up with a practical solution. "A horse, I 
figured, gets up by raising his front legs first. A cow the opposite. Knee-deep 
in mud, I got down behind the cow. I bent over, put the cow's tail around my 
neck, gripped it with both hands and raised up with all the strength I could 
manage. It worked." 
</P>
<P>
No one but a real cowboy could tell such a story. 
</P>
<P>
He graduated from Hollywood High School and enrolled at Pomona College. It was 
there that he began acting in amateur roles. 
</P>
<P>
McCrea decided that he liked the acting life and after college graduation in 
1928 began haunting the studios and picking up occasional work as an extra. 
</P>
<P>
His first feature role came in 1929 in "The Jazz Age," and in the same year he 
played in "So This Is College," "Dynamite," and "The Silver Horde." He began 
winning star roles the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, considering his authentic cowboy background and rugged physique, 
many of his early roles were as the effete, snooty rich kid. 
</P>
<P>
Critics consider that his career peaked in the 1940s with "Foreign 
Correspondent," "Sullivan's Travels," and "Palm Springs Story." 
</P>
<P>
The general public undoubtedly remembers him best in big-budget Western epics 
because his open, honest face, easy-going manner and relaxed seat on a horse 
combined to make him more at home on the range than almost any other actor. 
</P>
<P>
As producer Harry Sherman once put it: "Joel is the greatest natural Western 
star since the old days of Tom Mix and William S. Hart. He has an authentic 
background, and he is one of the finest natural horsemen I've ever seen. . . . 
Just a guy who knows how to sit on a horse with grace and authority." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as an admiring columnist expressed it: "A horse to him was like a sonnet to 
Keats." 
</P>
<P>
Real cowboys verified the judgment of these Hollywood types by electing McCrea 
to the Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
McCrea's poetic way with a horse and gritty Western look were perhaps most 
evident in Sam Peckinpah's 1962 film "Ride the High Country," in which he and 
Randolph Scott co-starred as a pair of over-the-hill lawmen transporting gold 
to a bank. 
</P>
<P>
McCrea was reputed to be one of the wisest investors and wealthiest actors of 
his era, although he sometimes joked about his business acumen. 
</P>
<P>
"My first business deal was with my mother," he once recounted. "I invested in 
chickens. I sold the eggs to my mother. Then (after she had cooked them) I ate 
the eggs. That's an ideal bargain." 
</P>
<P>
McCrea attributed his financial success largely to the late Times columnist 
Harry Carr and the late actor-humorist Will Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
Early in his career, when McCrea had a reputation as something of a playboy, 
Carr wrote privately to the star: "Don't let yourself slip into a state of mind 
where you believe that these little screen games of pretend are life. . . . 
Take all the easy money and save it. Accept what you find in Hollywood that is 
good and valuable and turn your back on the rest." 
</P>
<P>
McCrea said that he always tried to act on Carr's advice. On the advice of 
Rogers, McCrea invested his Hollywood earnings in a 1,000-acre working cattle 
ranch near Camarillo in Ventura County. He added to it over the years until he 
owned 3,000 acres of prime ranchland, which later became prime residential 
land. At one time, his ranch was producing 200,000 pounds of beef annually. 
McCrea was active in its management and in riding, roping and branding. 
</P>
<P>
In 1959, according to news reports, he sold 540 acres for $1.2 million, and 
four years later sold another 1,000 acres for $3 million. He lived on part of 
his original spread near Camarillo, and had another large ranch near Palos 
Verdes and two more in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
McCrea served as president of the local school board, chaired the fund-raising 
committee for the Camarillo Boys Club and donated $35,000 toward a new 
clubhouse. He also made substantial gifts to local colleges and the Tri-Valley 
YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his wife and son Jody, now a rancher in New Mexico, he is 
survived by two other sons, David, also a rancher in New Mexico, and Peter, a 
real estate developer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services in Westlake will be private. The family has asked that any 
memorial contributions be made to the Conejo Valley YMCA, Camarillo Boys and 
Girls Club, or Motion Picture and Television Fund.

JURORS ACQUIT 2 LIVE CREW IN OBSCENITY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Without a serious disagreement among them, six jurors took only about two hours 
Saturday to eat lunch and then find three members of the rap group 2 Live Crew 
not guilty of violating obscenity laws in a nightclub concert performance. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict caused an eruption of cheers from fans of the Miami-based singers 
who packed the courtroom, and dealt a defeat to local Sheriff Nick Navarro's 
efforts to prosecute the group, whose best-selling album had been declared 
obscene by a federal court judge only four days before the concert. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first and strongest impression was that this is political," said juror 
Helena Bailie, 76, a retired sociology professor. "They were thumbing their 
noses back (at Broward County and Navarro)." 
</P>
<P>
At issue was a June 10 concert at a Hollywood, Fla., nightclub during which the 
group performed four songs from the album "As Nasty as They Wanna Be." The 
songs contain crude and graphic sexual language. 
</P>
<P>
Had they been convicted, 2 Live Crew leader Luther (Luke) Campbell and group 
members Mark Ross and Christopher Wongwon could have each faced penalties of up 
to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell jumped to his feet, raised his right arm and smiled when the verdicts 
were read. "We did overcome," he said later. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the jury found the words offensive, Beverly Resnick, 65, said: "We 
found many things humorous. We looked at this as a comedy." 
</P>
<P>
The case was being closely watched as a test of 1st Amendment rights, 
especially by the music industry and performers. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Rogow, attorney for Campbell, said: "The message here is that the state 
ought to spend its money on real criminal matters. This was a farce. It was fun 
for me, trying this for Luther. But, from the state's point of view it's 
unconscionable." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant State Atty. Pedro Dijols said that although "we would like to have 
won, our lives are going to continue." 
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the state's evidence against the group, two microcassette 
recordings of a concert made by undercover vice squad detectives in the Club 
Futura, were of poor quality, and that the detectives who attempted to 
interpret the tapes for the jury often seemed "stage struck -- they were not 
relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the noisy tapes of the concert, on which the lyrics and shouts of both 
the performers and the audience are heard, were often unintelligible. 
</P>
<P>
What was immediately clear to jurors, however, was that the concert was not 
obscene, said David Garsow, 24, one of two men on the jury. "Everyday people 
use those words," he said. "Maybe people ought to take a look at the obscenity 
law." 
</P>
<P>
Juror Susan Van Hemert, 42, a guidance counselor in the local public school 
system, commented on 2 Live Crew's music: "It's certainly not something I want 
to see in the malls, or out in the open. But in a 21-year-old club, sure." She 
added she did not find the lyrics offensive to women, since "I took the whole 
thing as comedy." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's attorney, Rogow, said that although 1st Amendment issues were 
central to his defense, several weeks ago he was unsuccessful in defending a 
local record store owner against charges of obscenity in selling the "Nasty" 
album. He added that "none of these cases are groundbreaking. That's the 
futility of these cases. None of this sets any precedent." 
</P>
<P>
Jay Berman, president of the Recording Industry Assn. of America, the 
organization that represents the nation's major record companies, said the 
verdict offers small comfort to the music industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning this particular case will do little to derail those trying to reap 
political benefit off the current anti-free-expression atmosphere," Berman said 
by telephone from his Washington office. "We're all glad 2 Live Crew won, but 
no one in the business has any illusions that the war is over. We have to keep 
fighting." 
</P>
<P>
Carl Freed, executive director of the North American Concert Promoters Assn., 
applauded the verdict as a victory for free speech. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision eases some of the tensions for promoters who produce live 
concerts by controversial acts," Freed said in a phone interview from New York. 
"Even if we, as concert promoters, do not approve of the material Mr. Campbell 
performs, we believe the government has no business deciding what adults can or 
cannot listen to." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Thompson, the Coral Gables, Fla., anti-obscenity crusader who initiated 
the national campaign against 2 Live Crew's "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" album 
last January, blamed weak prosecution for the trial's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"This verdict in no way diminishes the fact that Luther Campbell is guilty of 
distributing more than 2 million obscene albums and deserves to go to jail," 
Thompson said Saturday night. "All this ruling does is send a message to law 
enforcement agencies around the country that they must secure better evidence 
and build stronger cases if they truly want to make a dent in stopping 
obscenity." 
</P>
<P>
Leanne Katz, executive director of the New York-based National Coalition 
Against Censorship, cautioned against celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"This verdict only serves to prove that no speaker, artist or retailer can have 
any idea in advance what will or will not be considered obscene," Katz said by 
phone from New York. "Luther Campbell's rights are every American's rights. 
Throughout history censorship has always had one serious side effect: more 
censorship." 
</P>
<P>
In his closing argument Saturday, Dijols told the jury: "Rap music is not on 
trial. Rap music is a viable form of entertainment. Some of us like rap music. 
I like rap music. 
</P>
<P>
"But these three men know exactly what they were doing that night. How can you 
say it's not offensive when you hear things like this?" 
</P>
<P>
As he and fellow prosecutor Leslie Robson have throughout the trial, Dijols 
then repeated the lyrics to several songs from the album that contain frequent 
references to explicit anal and oral sex. 
</P>
<P>
"It's common sense, ladies and gentlemen," said Dijols. "It's openly 
offensive." 
</P>
<P>
For the defense, Rogow told the jury: "The 1st Amendment does protect speech, 
even nasty speech. Of all the things in this world, sex is the thing all of us 
do. But if you don't say it (talk about it) in quite the right way, the state 
says you're in big trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the trial Rogow has argued that the black rap group was being 
prosecuted for both racial and political reasons. During the concert Campbell 
led the audience in call-and-response curses directed at Sheriff Navarro as 
well as Florida Gov. Bob Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
In order to have convicted the three rappers, the state was required to prove 
that the performance appealed to prurient interests, was offensive to the 
average Broward County resident and lacked serious artistic literary or 
political value. 
</P>
<P>
Since the concert included speech directed at Navarro and Martinez, Rogow said: 
"This concert was about as political a concert as one could find." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week the defense presented a professor of literature and a music 
critic who testified that 2 Live Crew's lyrics, however explicit, were serious 
contributions to the world of art. The state contended the songs are, in the 
words of Dijols "just plain simple nasty talk -- that's all it was." 
</P>
<P>
"This performance does not represent black culture," said Dijols, who is black. 
"It was three men trying to exploit sexual conduct to make a buck." 
</P>

A U.S. helicopter mechanic for a company contracted by Chevron Corp. was 
kidnaped by armed guerrillas in northern Angola, a government official said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
According to the official, mechanic Brent Swan and an Angolan colleague were 
abducted as they drove Friday to a heliport in Cabinda, an oil-rich province 
where separatist rebels have staged anti-government operations. 
</P>
<P>
No group claimed responsibility for the kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Weber, a spokesman for Petroleum Helicopter Inc. in Lafayette, La., 
confirmed that Swan is an employee, but declined to discuss the incident. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately possible to contact Cabinda Gulf, which contracts with 
Chevron in the southwest African nation to operate platforms in the Atlantic 
Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, two Portuguese aid workers were kidnaped by a Cabinda separatist 
group linked to U.S.-backed rebels fighting the Angolan government. 
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese government said the Front for the Liberation of Cabinda Enclave 
was holding the two in Zaire.

FALLOUT: THE CRISIS HITS HARD AT THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY. POLITICALLY, THE

<TEXT>
<P>
Shawqi Aql got out of Kuwait with his Chevrolet Blazer, his television and a 
VCR. The cash was left behind. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years' savings -- finished," the 40-year-old engineer said with a cheerful 
shrug of his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
Aql has been lucky. He has picked up a couple of contract jobs since his return 
to Cairo. For most returning Egyptians, there has been no work. The Kuwait 
heydays are over. Welcome home. 
</P>
<P>
Every Arab country caught in the vortex of the Persian Gulf crisis has suffered 
economic and political strains. For Egypt, the most populous at 55 million, the 
blow fell heavily on its top three sources of hard currency: remittances from 
workers abroad, tourism and Suez Canal fees. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems every Egyptian family had someone working in Kuwait or Iraq," 
explained Salama Ahmed Salama, managing editor and columnist of the 
authoritative Al Ahram, the country's leading daily. 
</P>
<P>
By unofficial estimates, as many as a million Egyptians were working in the 
gulf when the Iraqi army invaded Kuwait, more than 800,000 of them in Iraq and 
another 180,000 in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them lost everything they had," Salama said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the crowded, dirty streets of Cairo and the villages of the Nile 
showed no signs of desperation last week. Egypt, as old as time, perseveres. 
</P>
<P>
One senior Western envoy, reaching for the word, came up with "uncomfortable" 
to describe the economic atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
In the big Nile-side hotels, the chatter of French and Japanese tourists echoes 
in the corridors. But in the first cool week of autumn, the traditional start 
of the high season, occupancies are down by 60%, hotel officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"Just the locals are coming by," added a British shop owner on the Zamalek, an 
island in the Nile usually crawling with foreigners at this time of year. "It 
looks like a writeoff." 
</P>
<P>
Politically, the climate is also glum. "At the start," the senior diplomat 
explained, reviewing the evolution of the Egyptian attitude on the crisis, 
"(President Hosni) Mubarak was angry and righteous. (Iraqi President Saddam) 
Hussein had lied to him, he said. He wanted the Americans to knock him right 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"That didn't happen, and the policy from Washington and London called for 
waiting out the embargo. The thing appeared to drift, and still does. The 
feeling here is one of disarray. But Mubarak won't be backing down. He has no 
particular respect for the Iraqis." 
</P>
<P>
A city the size of Cairo simply absorbs political shock. For instance, the 
brazen assassination of parliamentary Speaker Rifaat Mahgoub on Oct. 12 had 
become little more than a highlight of coffee-shop gossip a week later. 
Theories flourished as the government said little: It was a terrorist hit 
ordered by Iraq; it was a case of mistaken identity -- the target was meant to 
be Interior Minister Mohammed Abdel-Halim Moussa; Mahgoub was the target, but 
the motive was personal. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said Saturday that Moussa's police were rounding up the usual 
suspects. The Cairo press published a purported leak that Palestinians were 
involved. Charges are expected soon. 
</P>
<P>
The problem of the returnees, the hundreds of thousands of Egyptian 
professionals and farm workers who fled the gulf, is a deeper issue. Among the 
first waves of refugees, driven by their government's prompt and hard stand 
against the invasion, the Egyptian hordes poured out of Iraq into the desert 
camps of Jordan and, eventually, home to a country that had no work for them. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the problem of President Mubarak, how to absorb these people," Salama, 
the Al Ahram editor, noted. "They need jobs, their children must have places in 
schools. The Kuwaitis have offered $50 million to cushion the blow. But what 
does that amount to? Maybe $500 or less for every returning worker. It's a 
minimal sum." 
</P>
<P>
Aql, the civil engineer, was pulling down about 800 Kuwaiti dinars a month, the 
equivalent of more than $2,500 before the invasion. "I had to pay rent and 
other expenses, but I was saving and living was good," Aql told a reporter. "I 
don't think we'll see that light again." 
</P>
<P>
Major international pledges to sustain Egypt, Turkey and Jordan, the countries 
hardest hit by the embargo against trade with Iraq, have yet to come through. 
According to diplomats, some Egyptian officials are showing impatience with the 
principal donors, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Japan and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no indication that Mubarak will back off his tough stand against 
Iraq. Egyptians do not feel threatened by the prospect of war in the gulf. The 
potential battlefields are far away. No one is selling gas masks in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats say, however, that the president is disappointed by the standoff. "He 
wanted to use the period of confidence to build a political consensus here," a 
foreign political analyst said. Instead, Egypt has slipped back into a 
political morass. 
</P>
<P>
New parliamentary elections are scheduled for Nov. 29, and the opposition 
parties are forming a boycott bandwagon. The largest, the New Wafd Party, 
declared last week that it will not take part. And an even larger alliance -- 
the Socialist Labor and Liberal Socialist parties -- and deputies from the 
Muslim Brotherhood are expected to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of Mubarak's National Democratic Party ruling the National 
Assembly without opposition presents a cosmetic problem. It would also remove 
the government's only reliable sounding board for its policies, since political 
polling is not permitted in Egypt and the partisan press is not considered a 
good measure of public attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
But a one-sided Parliament -- the constitutional court ordered new elections in 
a dispute on candidate qualifications -- will not diminish the power of 
Mubarak, a former air force officer. "The power in Egypt resides with the 
military," the senior Western diplomat said. "Elections will not change that." 
</P>
<P>
The fundamentals of the economy are also enduring in their way. Egypt, with a 
foreign debt of nearly $50 billion, is in the Latin American league. Inflation 
is estimated at 25% or more. Cairo has been fencing for several years with the 
International Monetary Fund, which demands hard decisions -- such as 
eliminating government subsidies on bread -- in return for help in 
restructuring its debt. No agreement has been reached. 
</P>
<P>
But with remittances from workers in the gulf, tourism, Suez Canal tolls and 
some oil exports, Mubarak's government was able to survive on the economic 
edge, an Egyptian tradition. Now, the upheaval of the past 2 1/2 months poses a 
test to Cairo's survival instincts. 
</P>
<P>
The country's primary problem is food. More than 50% of its requirements are 
imported, and a galloping birthrate promises to stifle improvement. 
</P>
<P>
This and other fundamental problems were cushioned by the remittances, an 
estimated $3 billion every year coming into the Egyptian economy. Much of it 
came through bank transfers -- in dollars -- which gave the government hard 
currency for food imports. Some came outside banking circles, pushing dollars 
into the black market. Enough of the latter reached the villages to keep 
families afloat. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the fellaheen (farm workers) are back home," the diplomat said. They can 
help on the family farm, but they're really just another mouth to feed. And the 
money is no longer coming in. 
</P>
<P>
For the professionals who lost their jobs and fortunes in Kuwait and Iraq, the 
situation is less flexible. With the economy pinched by the effects of the 
crisis, there will be few new jobs in their field. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investment is drying up. "The typical Egyptian businessman tends to 
spread his risks," the diplomat explained. "He probably puts a bit into the 
tourist business, and then maybe something into a small industry. With the 
tourists staying home, he's getting no return to spread into industry. The job 
creation goes phfft."

would seem to be the front-runner in terms of campaign paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Hussein -- and it is difficult to find a Jordanian who is not -- 
have plastered pictures of the president of neighboring Iraq on just about 
everything here that doesn't move, and on some things that do -- taxicabs, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's King Hussein gets little more than equal billing in this time of 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Embassy, just down Queen Zein Street from its American counterpart, 
is a fount of posters, including the popular photo of King Hussein and Saddam 
Hussein gripping a rifle in a carpeted reception hall. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown dealers are doing a brisk business in lapel buttons. In dramatic Arab 
style, they forgo "I Like Saddam" for a more trenchant message: "You Can Make 
Us Hungry but You Can't Make Us Kneel," inscribed over the likeness of the 
Iraqi leader. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, 90% of those are bought by Western tourists," said Fuad Afghani, a 
Palestinian merchant. "Jordanians prefer a smaller button without the words." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly the Iraqi government has a hand in the flood of political 
paraphernalia, but Afghani says he creates his own. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time Saddam makes a speech, we make a new button," he said. "We have 
them made up here in Amman with the latest good phrase." 
</P>
<P>
Afghani, too, is an admirer of the Iraqi president. 
</P>
<P>
"He's decisive, a man who says yes and a man who says no," Afghani said. 
</P>
<P>
If pressed, Jordanians will admit that Saddam Hussein is hardly a flawless 
leader. He runs a ruthless regime, they concede, and his profession of Islamic 
piety raises eyebrows here. 
</P>
<P>
Still, his invasion and annexation of Kuwait have met with little criticism, 
despite the Jordanian government's official condemnation. An Amman travel agent 
dismissed the rulers of Kuwait as "$50-billion sheiks." 
</P>
<P>
"Pro-Saddam sentiment goes right up to the top levels of government," a Western 
diplomat said. It is particularly prevalent among the Palestinians, who 
constitute more than half the Jordanian population, according to unofficial 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
A schoolboy march the other day, organized by the Confederation of Jordanian 
Women and very middle-class and non-militant, carried a mix of placards 
supporting the king and the Iraqi president, along with banners calling for an 
"Arab Jerusalem." 
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian attitude may change in time," the diplomat said. "When all 
their brothers and cousins come back from Kuwait and tell their stories of 
family fortunes gone forever, there will be second thoughts. But it hasn't 
happened yet. Saddam and Iraq are riding high here. He's seen as a tough leader 
who backs their cause." 
</P>
<P>
If there's a weak wheel on the Iraqi bandwagon here it is the Islamic 
fundamentalist movement, which increased its political clout in last spring's 
parliamentary elections. The Muslim Brotherhood, the principal fundamentalist 
organization, finds no comfort in Iraq's secular, socialist policies, or in the 
invasion of Kuwait, which drew American-led foreign military forces into Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
But Saddam Hussein remains a prime piece of merchandise at Afghani's shop 
across from the old mosque in downtown Amman. 
</P>
<P>
"The people here have a belief in him," the Jaffa-born Palestinian said. "He's 
not the best Islamic leader, but he's an Arab leader." 
</P>
<P>
As Afghani discussed business and politics with a couple of American reporters, 
a deliveryman came through the door of his shop with a bag full of new Saddam 
Hussein buttons, hot from the factory. He spread them over the glass 
countertop. 
</P>
<P>
"We're selling about 400 a day," Afghani said. 
</P>
<P>
The big ones, the size of a silver dollar, go for about $1.50, mostly to 
tourists. The smaller ones, which the Jordanians favor, cost about half that. 
</P>
<P>
On a rail outside the shop, the latest posters hang like laundry, beckoning 
buyers. A popular one features separate photos of the king, the Iraqi leader 
and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, all cradling 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
At major intersections, teen-agers dash from car to car with posters, like 
newsboys hawking the latest edition. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the selling of Saddam Hussein has not reached the monumental 
proportions it has in his own capital of Baghdad, where his portraits cover the 
outside walls of buildings. The largest poster here is only 2-by-3 feet, but 
the quantity has been more than enough to get the message across. 
</P>

CARIBBEAN: CALM AND ORDERLY VOTER REGISTRATION MARKS A STARTLING TURNAROUND 
FROM THE NEAR CHAOS THAT ENGULFED THE COUNTRY JUST WEEKS AGO.

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Graffiti artists using human excrement as their medium of political expression 
smeared the malodorous slogan "Worst is still to come" on the walls of four 
voter registration offices in Haiti earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
"Next time we will use gasoline," added one piece of graffito. 
</P>
<P>
As the sloganeers suggested, Haiti's upcoming national elections, now scheduled 
for Dec. 16, may turn dirty. 
</P>
<P>
But to Haitians who have feared much worse after years of anti-democratic 
bloodshed and brutality, this relatively benign beginning to a three-week 
registration period for the country's estimated 3 million voters was an 
unexpectedly upbeat sign that the long-postponed election of president, 
parliament and local officials is at last on the track. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't shoot at people to scare them away from registering to vote, 
then the chances of actually having a free democratic election are very good," 
exulted a Port-au-Prince businessman who had all but given up hope for a 
peaceful election process. 
</P>
<P>
To political leaders and diplomats here, the mostly calm and orderly voter 
registration marks a startling turnaround from the near chaos that engulfed the 
country just a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We narrowly avoided a coup d'etat in late August and September," said the 
leading centrist presidential candidate, Marc Bazin, referring to a moment when 
deep discontent with provisional President Ertha Pascal Trouillot led 
politicians of the extreme right and left to urge Army Chief of Staff Herard 
Abraham to depose her. 
</P>
<P>
Bazin and other leaders said visits to Haiti by Vice President Dan Quayle, who 
sternly warned the military against even thinking about a takeover, and by 
former President Jimmy Carter, who talked just as firmly to Trouillot and the 
wavering politicians, influenced the surprising turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
"The port was on strike, there was no fuel, power was shut down, trash was 
piling up and altogether the pressures were so great that people said, 'OK, 
let's put this election together,' " said a senior foreign diplomat. "Enough 
people in enough places decided this was it -- they could just throw the cards 
up in the air or they could buckle down and make the process work." 
</P>
<P>
But with two months between registration and voting day, the potential for the 
kind of terrorism and social turmoil that derailed Haiti's last attempt at free 
elections on Nov. 29, 1987, remains high, according to both political and 
military leaders. On that election day, after weeks of pre-election terrorism, 
army-supported thugs and assassins sent into the streets by followers of the 
deposed Duvalier family dictatorship shot and hacked to death at least 34 
Port-au-Prince voters, forcing cancellation of the voting. Many still fear it 
will happen again. 
</P>
<P>
"Some parties, because of their ideology, are incapable of winning power 
through elections," said Lt. Col. Ramus Sainvil, the chief of army 
intelligence, who sits on a special four-man military committee for election 
security appointed recently to prevent a repeat of the army-approved outrages 
that destroyed the 1987 elections. "Although they say they support elections, 
behind the scenes they are doing things to destroy the elections, and we have 
proof of this." 
</P>
<P>
But Sainvil and his fellow security committee members, all young colonels who 
say they want to professionalize the army and erase its wretched record of 
corruption and brutality, said that attempts to spoil the December voting won't 
work because the army is now committed to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"As we approach the election the level of anxiety will go up," said Jean 
Casimir, a sociologist and secretary general of the nine-member independent 
Electoral Council that must organize and conduct the elections. But he 
expressed confidence that the council's increasingly warm relations with the 
military security committee and other elements of the armed forces will 
forestall a repetition of 1987, when the Electoral Council itself was a target 
of army abuse. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the security committee, Trouillot has formed a civilian-military 
commission of the three top army generals and three Cabinet officers to police 
nationwide security measures. 
</P>
<P>
"Acts of terrorism and sabotage are becoming increasingly difficult for the 
terrorists, given the sort of relations that have developed between us," said 
Casimir. But he added, "The authorities have left too many weapons wandering 
around in the hands of God knows who, so I'm not going to say the bride is 
beautiful until after the wedding -- election day." 
</P>
<P>
Close international scrutiny like that which calmed this year's elections in 
Nicaragua also will put a brake on Duvalierists and others who might try to 
disrupt the process, said Casimir. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 U.N. observers and 28 more from the Organization of American States 
and the Caribbean Economic Community already are on hand to give technical 
advice and observe the election campaign. By election day, the United Nations 
will have fielded between 300 and 400 poll watchers and 65 unarmed military 
security advisers, according to Reinhart W. A. Helmke, chief resident U.N. 
officer in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
The OAS expects its observer ranks to swell to about 200 by the time voters go 
to the polls, according to their Canadian chief, Pierre F. Cote, on loan from 
his regular job as chief electoral officer of Quebec province. 
</P>
<P>
"Our well-marked jeep and our flag have created a big impression already," Cote 
said. "It creates confidence. Because we are here, people believe there really 
will he an election." 
</P>
<P>
Other election observers will be sent by individual governments, including the 
United States and France, as well as by human rights and other non-governmental 
groups such as former President Carter's Freely Elected Heads of Government, 
bringing the total to about 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The more the merrier," said Casimir. "Their purpose is to make it very 
difficult for anyone to disrupt the elections. They will give the population a 
feeling of security and they will give the results legitimacy." 
</P>
<P>
Yet a number of hurdles remain. The first will come during the first week of 
November, when the Electoral Council must decide which of the expected 20-odd 
presidential candidates and innumerable candidates for lesser offices are to be 
stricken from the list under a constitutional ban against politicians who had 
close ties to the 29-year-long Duvalier dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
A bold challenge by the Duvalierists appears certain. Not long ago, a new 
Duvalierist political party, the Union for National Reconciliation, elected the 
former head of the Tontons Macoutes, notorious secret police of the Duvalier 
dictatorship, as leader and probable presidential candidate. He is Roger 
Lafontant, who returned from exile in July. Since then, President Trouillot has 
half-heartedly sought to have him arrested for crimes committed before onetime 
President for Life Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier fled the country in 
February, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the arrest order, Lafontant has been campaigning openly and was 
reportedly surrounded during the Duvalierist political convention by both 
uniformed and civilian-clothed soldier-bodyguards, raising fears that the 
Duvalierists once again enjoy the protection of at least some elements of the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
"Either the army takes Lafontant in or there is going to be trouble," lamented 
Dr. Louis Roy, a father of the Haitian constitution and present chief of the 
quasi-parliamentary Council of State. "If they cannot arrest him, how are they 
going to enforce election security?" 
</P>
<P>
"The Duvalierists are violent," conceded Col. Sainvil, "but so far we have seen 
no signs of their violence, although we're afraid we might see some when the 
Electoral Council disapproves candidates. . . . When they were rejected in 
1987, there were brutal scenes of violence." 
</P>
<P>
But one of Sainvil's colleagues on the security committee, U.S.-trained Col. 
Alix Richard Silva, appeared more sanguine. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1987, the army did not fulfill its mission," he said, "but this year we can 
assure you it will be 100% different." 
</P>
<P>
"We hope it will be a new start (for the army), a new beginning," said Col. 
Raoul Cedras, commander of the military academy and president of the security 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to pre-election uncertainties are two other figures from the past, 
former President Leslie F. Manigat, who returned to Haiti last week, and 
one-time army general and interior minister Williams Regala, who returned in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
Manigat gained the presidency in January, 1988, in an almost totally boycotted 
election engineered by Regala, who was then the right-hand man of former army 
strongman Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy. He was ousted and exiled five months later 
after he tried in vain to fire his army sponsors. Since Manigat was widely 
perceived as a military puppet and became a figure of derision to many, it 
appears doubtful that he will have much impact at the polls even if his renewed 
candidacy is approved by the Electoral Council. 
</P>
<P>
Regala is said to have no interest in the presidency, but his continued 
presence in Haiti, despite pressure from the U.S. Embassy and most 
pro-democracy groups that he return to exile, has been unsettling. 
</P>
<P>
"He shouldn't be parading around the streets," complained Casimir, who said the 
former general's mere presence as a symbol of a bloody past is alarming to 
voters. "He was the one who brought down the 1987 election."

Lebanon's President Elias Hrawi met with Syrian President Hafez Assad to 
discuss his plans after the toppling of rebel Christian Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun. 
</P>
<P>
Hrawi was greeted in Damascus by Assad and a 21-gun salute. Syrian officials 
said talks focused on plans to disband militias, form a new government and free 
southern Lebanon from Israeli occupation. Lebanese government officials said 
the seven existing militias, estimated to number 40,000 men, will be disbanded 
within six months.

Nomadic Tuaregs wiped out an army detachment that had been stealing their

Tilalt said that about 15 Tuareg warriors attacked the army base near Marat in 
northern Mali. Four Tuaregs were wounded, the statement said, and the invaders 
captured three soldiers. The Tuaregs are herdsmen who roam the deserts of Mali, 
Algeria, Libya and Niger, paying scant attention to national borders.

The federal Centers for Disease Control misspent $6.6 million while conducting 
a disputed study of the effects of Agent Orange, a congressional study released 
Saturday said. 
</P>
<P>
The General Accounting Office said the money was spent on work by outside 
contractors that was not needed or couldn't be done because the CDC did not 
have a methodology ready to begin the work. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Orange was a herbicide sprayed by U.S. troops during the Vietnam War to 
remove jungle cover. Many veterans contend it is responsible for cancers, birth 
defects and other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
The report fueled renewed criticism of the CDC's handling of the Agent Orange 
study. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House human resources and 
intergovernmental relations subcommittee, called the report "direct evidence 
that the political manipulation of the Agent Orange study resulted in the waste 
of millions of taxpayer dollars."

A second 16-year-old suspect in the Fresno shooting rampage that left one dead

</P>
<P>
Juvenile Court Referee Phillip Silva ordered Friday that Dwight Tamplin stand 
trial as an adult for first-degree murder and 17 other criminal charges in 
connection with the Labor Day weekend shooting spree. Silva said Tamplin was 
unfit to be tried as a juvenile because of his previous criminal history and a 
record of failing to respond to rehabilitation. Tamplin also faces six counts 
of attempted murder, four counts of robbery and five counts of assault with a 
deadly weapon. He could face life imprisonment without parole.

Police in Colton seized $400,000 worth of methamphetamine and $13,000 in cash 
in a raid prompted by a business card that advertised "good, high quality, 
uncut cocaine." The card, confiscated in neighboring Banning during a warrant 
search, announced "Colton's newest crack house" and gave an address, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you offer good, high quality, uncut cocaine, at a reasonable price, 
Southern California will beat a path to your door," the card said. "This is our 
guiding principle, so why not give us a try." Banning and Colton officers 
raided the home Thursday and seized eight pounds of methamphetamine and $13,000 
in cash, Banning Police Lt. George Lanterman said. Six people were arrested for 
investigation of possession of methamphetamine for sale, he said.

POLICE CAR KILLS MAN ON FREEWAY AFTER ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A motorist who apparently wandered onto the Santa Monica Freeway after a 
traffic accident early Saturday was struck and killed by an unmarked Los 
Angeles police car whose occupants were heading to Century City to provide 
security for visiting Hungarian Prime Minister Jozsef Antall. 
</P>
<P>
John Bewick, 35, of Los Angeles was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the accident occurred about 5 a.m. on the westbound side of 
the freeway near Fairfax Avenue. Bewick was hit by a Chevrolet driven by 
Officer Edward Maytorena, 43. Maytorena's partner, Tim Russell, 38, sustained 
minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told authorities that minutes before, Bewick's westbound car had 
struck the center divider and overturned. Motorists helped Bewick out of his 
car to the right-hand shoulder, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Bewick wandered back onto the freeway to his car. 
</P>
<P>
"The unmarked (police) car . . . was traveling, we believe, 50 to 55 m.p.h.," 
said Cmdr. William Booth, spokesman for the Police Department. "(The officers) 
saw the overturned car and were passing it to the left . . . (when) the 
deceased stepped right out from in front of his vehicle and stepped into their 
path."

4 TEEN-AGERS INJURED IN HEAD-ON COLLISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four Saugus High School students were injured, none of them seriously, when 
their car was hit head-on by a second vehicle on a two-lane stretch of upper 
Bouquet Canyon Road, the California Highway Patrol reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the second car, William Hunt, 43, of Saugus was arrested on 
suspicion of felony drunk driving, said CHP Sgt. Scott Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt was being held at the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station jail in lieu 
of $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt was driving his 1990 Thunderbird north on the narrow roadway shortly after 
10 p.m. Friday when his car swerved into the southbound lane, colliding with 
the car carrying the students, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old female driver of the second car, a 1987 Volvo, received 
moderate injuries in the crash, authorities said. Injuries to her three 
passengers, a boy and two girls, were minor, Jones said. The teen-agers' names 
were not released. All were treated at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in 
Valencia, where the driver was in stable condition Saturday, a spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said the teen-agers, who were returning home from a party, probably would 
have been injured more seriously had they not been wearing seat belts.

NO CARL'S JR AT CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congratulations to CSUN! At long last, an institution of higher learning 
practices what it preaches and sets a good example by not allowing Carl's Jr on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
Students are taught to be open-minded, to thoroughly analyze situations before 
making decisions and choices, and not to discriminate on the basis of race, 
sex, religion, culture, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Karcher and his foundation exemplify the extreme opposite. A national 
survey (Haile, 1990) identified Carl Karcher Enterprises as one of the nine 
worst companies to work for, due to its discrimination against employees based 
on gender, race, etc. 
</P>
<P>
And don't believe the standard Karcher corporate reply: "What Mr. Karcher does 
with his own money is his business, not Carl's Jr's." Corporations set up 
tax-dodge foundations all the time; Karcher is president of the Karcher 
Foundation as well as chairman of the Karcher Enterprises board. Thus, he bears 
the ultimate responsibility for both. 
</P>
<P>
It can be difficult to do the right thing by our youth when money is involved. 
Rental of an on-campus site by Carl's would have generated income for CSUN, but 
given its students the wrong message. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, my co-ed Explorer Scout post approached several foundations for 
financial help with travel to Washington to accept a conservation award as one 
of President Bush's "Points of Light." After discussing the foundations, our 
youth officers decided NOT to ask the Karchers for help because "Exploring 
stands for good citizenship, respect for the basic rights of others and 
non-discrimination; to request help from a foundation which does not stand for 
those ideals would be morally wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Hurrah for my Explorer youth and for CSUN. CSUN's decision to ban Carl's from 
campus is not a rein on freedom, but a clear message that CSUN values citizens' 
rights, beliefs and anti-discrimination. I respect CSUN and am proud that my 
son is a CSUN freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who wishes to support Karcher's policies can eat at the Carl's Jr one 
block west of campus.

MEDIA OUT OF TOUCH WITH IRVINE CITIZENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial "A Mayor or a Marshmallow" (Oct. 11) leads me to the conclusion 
you're out of touch with the citizens of Irvine. The voters spoke by a 52%-48% 
vote to not reelect Larry Agran. 
</P>
<P>
You do a disservice to the city voters when you fail to recognize what in most 
elections would be considered a landslide. 
</P>
<P>
You're right when you said we failed to reelect an international diplomat in 
Agran. I question your description, however. We defeated a man who put his own 
political ambitions ahead of the interests of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Every city with an elected mayor is governed by machine politics. Mayor Bradley 
is out raising $750,000 to cover legal fees for his conflict-of-interest 
lawsuit. Is Sacramento better now that we have paid career politicians 
controlled by lobbyists, instead of our former citizen politicians? 
</P>
<P>
I am a very independent voter -- and I'm not a supporter of Sally Anne Sheridan 
-- but to call her a pothole-fixing mayor is demeaning. You should look at one 
of the cleanest political cities in the United States -- Cincinnati -- the 
mayor elected by fellow councilmen, no political machine, just honest 
government serving the people. 
</P>
<P>
We've got a lot of wounds to bind in this city. Your editorial contributes 
nothing to it. It just illustrates that the media -- like Congress -- are out 
of touch.

PROP. 136 SEEN AS THREAT TO PLAN BY LONG BEACH TO HIRE DEPUTIES; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE INITIATIVE WOULD BAR CITIES FROM RAISING TAXES. LONG BEACH 
HAD RAISED ITS UTILITY TAX TO PAY FOR THE HELP FOR ITS BACKLOGGED POLICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proposition 136, the state ballot initiative that would prevent cities from 
raising taxes, could imperil the city's plan to bring in sheriff's deputies 
over the next three years to help protect a town in which crime is soaring and 
police performance is at a record low, Long Beach officials say. 
</P>
<P>
On the brink of a law enforcement crisis, the city has hired 46 Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputies to begin patrolling the northern parts of town next 
month because the Long Beach Police Department is critically understaffed, 
backlogged with cases and barely able to keep up with calls for help. 
</P>
<P>
The $3.8 million needed to pay for one year of sheriff's assistance was raised 
by increasing from 5% to 7% the utility tax that residents pay for water, gas 
and telephone service, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It is precisely that kind of tax increase that Prop. 136 would prohibit. Should 
the initiative pass, all future tax hikes would need to be approved by 
two-thirds of Long Beach voters -- the same voters who rejected a special tax 
in November that would have bought 75 more Long Beach police officers. 
</P>
<P>
"Had this initiative been in effect when the city considered its budget this 
year," Assistant City Manager John Shirey said, "we would not have been able to 
raise sufficient revenues to meet the public safety needs of this city. We 
would have had to cut elsewhere to find $3.8 million, and there would have been 
a lot more blood on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
The measure's effect on California cities would be sweeping. But in Long Beach, 
city officials said, the impact could go straight to the heart of a service 
considered vital to any community: police protection. 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials are worried. Long Beach police recently ranked lowest among 
10 major cities in California for solving serious and violent crimes. At the 
same time, crime is increasing more rapidly in Long Beach than virtually 
anywhere in the state, Department of Justice figures show. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, Long Beach is in a financial crisis. The city continues to dip 
into its meager budget surplus to pay for such fundamental services as police, 
and there is no new money on the horizon. A healthy budget surplus for a city 
such as Long Beach would approach $9 million, city officials have said; the 
surplus is now about $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 50% of the voters approved of a special tax to pay for 75 
more police officers, but the ordinance failed to muster the two-thirds vote 
needed to become law -- the same high standard that Proposition 136 would 
impose. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ray Grabinski said: "Raising the utility tax is one of the few 
things we've been able to do at the local level to maintain public service. 
This initiative is just another nail in the coffin of local government." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 136, which appears on the Nov. 6 ballot, is sponsored by anti-tax 
groups and backed by $2 million from the liquor industry. Its prime sponsor, 
the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer Assn., contends that the liquor tax has never been 
the driving force behind the measure, which was designed to stop local 
officials from raising any tax without voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
Its opponents -- including the League of Women voters, California League of 
Cities, Common Cause of California, California Parent-Teacher Assn. and 
California Tax Reform Assn. -- call it a "rum-soaked fraud" perpetrated by the 
alcohol industry to protect itself and other special interests from tax 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
The inability to raise local taxes in the future means that Long Beach will 
have to forgo the added sheriff's protection next year or cut close to $4 
million somewhere else. Already, the budget is so lean that most departments 
were asked to cut costs 2% across the board this year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The council would have no choice but to look at parks and recreation and 
library services, because that's about all that's left," said Shirey, the 
assistant city manager. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Forty-six Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies are scheduled to begin 
patrolling Long Beach's 5th and 9th City Council districts Nov. 1, freeing 43 
local officers to patrol the rest of the city. The agreement could run as long 
as three years and eight months, giving the Long Beach Police Department time 
to increase staff levels and improve its performance.

PUBLIC ASKED TO JOIN WATER CLEANUP TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal and local authorities, at odds over how best to remedy severe ground 
water pollution in the San Gabriel Basin, this month are inviting the public to 
wade into the complicated, highly technical debate with them. 
</P>
<P>
Two hearings will focus on differences in proposals by federal environmental 
officials -- who favor building costly central treatment facilities -- and 
local authorities, who want to take a less expensive approach emphasizing 
treatment of individual wells. 
</P>
<P>
Despite differing opinions on a solution, U.S. Rep. Esteban E. Torres, who is 
holding one of the hearings, said: "I fully expect . . . to elicit an explicit 
answer everyone can understand." 
</P>
<P>
Torres, a La Puente Democrat, chairs the House of Representatives' environment 
and labor subcommittee of the Committee on Small Business. His hearing, at 9 
a.m. Tuesday in Baldwin Park's City Council chambers, 14403 E. Pacific Ave., 
will consider federal government's role in the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
A major difficulty facing officials has been how to pay for the cleanup, 
estimated to cost hundreds of millions of dollars and to take decades to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
With the release in April of a $106-million five-year plan, federal and state 
officials detailed how the cleanup should proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Emphasis was placed on 12 of the valley's most highly polluted wells, in the 
Azusa-Baldwin Park area. 
</P>
<P>
The plan suggested the construction of a regional treatment plant to serve the 
area at an estimated $50 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said: "I will be asking (federal officials at the hearing) a very simple 
question: When will construction start? . . . The period for study is over. Now 
we are looking for specific results." 
</P>
<P>
Local officials -- represented by the Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster -- 
released their own cleanup plan last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The Watermaster, a nine-member board that oversees water rights in the valley, 
focused on treatment of individual wells. 
</P>
<P>
This approach, taken during the next three to seven years, would cost less, 
said Timothy C. Jochem, Watermaster project manager: $15 million to $25 million 
for 11 wells in the Azusa-Baldwin Park area and $3.5 million to operate the 
wells each year. 
</P>
<P>
He said water officials were looking for a less expensive plan and trying to be 
realistic about obtaining financing for a short-term project. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have sided with the state and federal plan, saying they 
distrust local water officials. At the same time, the local authorities said 
any differences have been exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
To give the public a chance to respond, the Watermaster is holding a hearing at 
10 a.m. Wednesday at its El Monte offices, 11310 Valley Blvd. Jochem said he 
hoped the hearing, and Torres', will point out similarities in the plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had these philosophical interagency differences so much that we didn't 
notice that our strategies are beginning to merge," Jochem said. 
</P>
<P>
Both hearings will probably deal with how water being pumped from the San 
Gabriel Basin influences the movement of underground contamination. Due to 
increased pollution from cancer-causing chemicals during the last 10 years, 
one-fourth of the basin's wells have been closed. 
</P>
<P>
Federal and state officials have said that pumping by individual water 
suppliers has spread the pollution, whereas local officials downplay such a 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the cleanup was discussed at two other hearings. One was 
held by state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), who chairs the Committee on 
Toxics and Public Safety Management. The other was held by Assemblywoman Sally 
Tanner (D-Baldwin Park), who chairs the Environmental Safety and Toxic 
Materials Committee.

Baldwin Park City Hall.

CITY WON'T BUY BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plans to buy three buildings that make up the former Pasadena Community 
Hospital at 1845 N. Fair Oaks Ave. for use by the city Health Department were 
canceled last week by the Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
The board made public Tuesday a closed-door decision made Oct. 9 to back out of 
the deal with building owners Edward and Laurie Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was based on a city Finance Department analysis that concluded the 
deal was unrealistic because the city doesn't have $7.5 million needed to buy 
the buildings and renovate their 61,000 square feet of space. The city would 
also have to pay $410,000 annually for mortgage and operating expenses, the 
analysis said. 
</P>
<P>
The city had paid a $125,000 deposit, but because the sale was canceled within 
60 days, the deposit will be refunded.

The City Council on Wednesday authorized spending $49,700 to join 11 other San 
Gabriel Valley cities in a collective agreement to meet a state-mandated 
reduction of solid waste. 
</P>
<P>
Under California's 1989 Waste Management Act, cities must reduce landfill 
disposal 25% by 1995 and 50% by 2000. By joining the San Gabriel Valley Solid 
Waste Joint Powers Authority, South Pasadena expects to save from $30,000 to 
$50,000 in its efforts to meet that goal.

<P>
Two community musical groups, the Rio Hondo Symphony Orchestra and Chorale Bel 
Canto, will combine forces in two classical concerts marking the opening of 
their 1990-91 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The first concert will be at 8 p.m. Saturday in the new Shannon Center for the 
Performing Arts, 6760 Painter Ave., on the Whittier College campus. Tickets are 
$20 and include a reception afterward. A nearly duplicate concert will be at 3 
p.m. the next day in the Whittier High School auditorium, 12417 E. Philadelphia 
St., Whittier. It will be free. 
</P>
<P>
What's the difference? Technically, the first concert is the chorale's opener 
for its ninth season, and the chorale charges admission. Its season tickets are 
$40. The second event marks the opening of the symphony's 58th season, and its 
four concerts a year traditionally are free. The Shannon Center seats 403, 
while the high school auditorium holds 2,400. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of both events will be Carl Orff's oratorio "Carmina Burana," 
featuring the 80-voice Chorale Bel Canto and the 40-voice Whittier College 
choir, both under the direction of Stephen Gothold, dean of college life and a 
music professor at the college. The oratorio is based on 25 Latin poems of the 
13th Century and takes its name from a monastery in Germany where the 
manuscript was preserved.

Thomas L. Enders will sing the baritone solo, a part he has performed in Los 
Angeles and San Francisco. Enders, who joined the Whittier College faculty last 
year as assistant vice president for student financing and enrollment, also has 
done several operatic roles. Tenor soloist Alvin Brightbill is director of 
choral activities at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo and has appeared with 
the Portland Opera and the Roger Wagner Chorale. He also was assistant 
conductor of the William Hall Chorale for six years. The third soloist is 
soprano Jean Gothold, the chorale director's wife, who teaches voice at 
Whittier College and has studied and performed in Europe.

To help celebrate the opening of the Shannon center, both concerts will begin 
with Beethoven's "Consecration of the House Overture." Beethoven composed the 
overture in 1822 to mark the opening of the Josephstadt Theatre in Vienna. An 
extra piece on the program Sunday afternoon is "Serenade in E Minor for 
Strings" by Elgar, a romantic work from the 19th Century.

SETBACK FOR CONDO PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A nine-unit condominium project in the planning stages for more than three 
years received another setback Wednesday when the City Council rejected the 
developers' request to build a higher-than-permitted front wall. 
</P>
<P>
Developers of the proposed complex at 167-175 Monterey Road now must wait at 
least a year before submitting revamped plans. 
</P>
<P>
During a public hearing, residents living near the 46,500-square-foot site 
complained that the design of the proposed complex is incompatible with the 
neighborhood. They also argued that the complex would disrupt the hillside 
ecology. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was 4 to 1, with Councilman James Woollacott Jr. dissenting.

ZONING CODE AND THE COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recent poll conclusively showed that nine out of 10 people seeking building 
variances and conditional-use permits prefer doing business with the Monterey 
Park City Council than any other council in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, at the Oct. 1 council meeting, a person asked for not one, not 
two, not three, but four building variances and a conditional-use permit. 
</P>
<P>
The applicant had illegally converted a garage into living quarters and needed 
council approval to legalize the conversion and escape a court appearance. The 
council OKd the variances. 
</P>
<P>
Approving variances that forgive an illegally converted garage not only sets a 
horrible precedent, but clearly does not meet any of the criteria (in the city 
Building Code.) Therefore, at this very moment the city attorney is 
hermetically sealed in a little room with porcelain fixtures next to the 
council chamber creating a legal reason to justify the council's action. 
</P>
<P>
What makes this situation even more questionable is that the applicant's name 
prominently appeared on a political mailer sent out on behalf of Councilman 
Fred Balderrama during the last election. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Councilman Balderrama was one of two council members to appeal 
this case after the Planning Commission and Design Review Board rejected it, 
thus saving the applicant a $244 fee. By their action, the council also saves 
the applicant the time and cost of a court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Balderrama voted in favor of the applicant along with two other 
council members who apparently are ignorant of the legal criteria and grounds 
for approving variances. Or maybe it wasn't ignorance at all.

TEACHER HAS CLUB ADVISER ROLE DOWN TO SCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sofia Pappatheodorou is the first to admit she doesn't fit the profile of a 
typical science teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"So often scientists are so rigid," said Pappatheodorou, who is anything but 
typical as an adviser to the Science Society student club at Cal State 
Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The Science Society was recently honored for the second consecutive year by a 
national chemists' organization as one of 12 outstanding student groups in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
It takes just a few minutes of talking to club members to find out that 
Pappatheodorou, an associate chemistry professor who has been teaching for more 
than 10 years, is a big reason the club has been so successful. The outgoing, 
energetic Pappatheodorou has immersed herself in the club and has rejuvenated 
student interest in the sciences, school officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Her approach to science is to make it fun. Pappatheodorou recently organized a 
magic show where a guest speaker mixed chemicals to show a variety of 
reactions, some of which produced minor explosions. 
</P>
<P>
Pappatheodorou was one of the primary founders of the club in 1986, and it has 
since grown from a small number of students to about 45 last year. In addition, 
22 faculty members were associate members last year. Pappatheodorou said she 
hopes even more students and faculty will be involved this year. 
</P>
<P>
The group's activities encompass all fields of science and include sponsoring 
lectures by professionals, panel discussions, slide presentations, field trips, 
luncheons and social outings. The club is open to all students. 
</P>
<P>
The American Chemical Society recognized the Dominguez Hills group this month 
as an outstanding student chapter. Every year, the society's student chapters 
-- about 850 -- submit an annual report of their activities. Certain chapters 
are selected as either outstanding or commendable, according to Rita Boggs, 
chairwoman of the society's Southern California section. The national society 
was impressed by the number and quality of activities of the Dominguez Hills 
chapter, said Linda Ross, a spokeswoman for the organization's education 
division. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a significant lecture series, and a number of their students present 
research at our local and national conferences," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
The organization was also impressed by Pappatheodorou, Ross said. "Sofia 
exemplifies the wonderful, nurturing characteristics that turn people on to the 
sciences," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to popular perceptions, science is interesting, said Deborah Ward, a 
senior biology major. "You get to light things on fire -- that's fun," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pappatheodorou said she stresses a personal touch. She is known for lending a 
sympathetic ear to students with personal problems and for giving rides to club 
members in need of transportation. She shares her small office with students, 
who store their backpacks there, use her computer and typewriter or just hang 
out -- even when she's not around. 
</P>
<P>
"She's such a caring person," said Ledford Powell, a biology senior and club 
treasurer. "She's the most wonderful instructor I've ever met. She's like a 
mother figure." 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Seely, chairman of the chemistry department, said Pappatheodorou has 
given the department a new profile since her arrival in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"She is so bubbly, so enthusiastic -- it's something to really rejoice about," 
Seely said. "What we have in Sofia is somebody that came in who has a real love 
for the students, who wants to be close to them and get to know them. By and 
large, the field has been populated by people in the past who are, if not 
aloof, at least distant." 
</P>
<P>
Science is often thought to be time-consuming, difficult work -- a perception 
that intimidates students and discourages them from entering science-related 
fields, Pappatheodorou said. So she makes a point of dispensing with "highbrow" 
airs and "highfalutin" language, she said. To that end, many of the Science 
Society's activities are down to earth. 
</P>
<P>
Seely said the Science Society serves as a potentially strong recruiting tool 
and should attract students to the school's science departments over the next 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
Chemistry senior Anthony Del Real said he changed his major from psychology to 
chemistry a few years ago after becoming involved in the club and taking a 
class with Pappatheodorou. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice relationship, teacher to person," he said. "You don't get lost in 
the shuffle like you would at a larger school." 
</P>
<P>
Seely said he hopes students such as Del Real will help reverse declining 
enrollment in the chemistry department. In keeping with a national trend toward 
fewer students entering the sciences, the number of chemistry majors at Cal 
State Dominguez Hills -- 21 -- is the lowest it has been in six years, he said.

MALL'S TENANTS BAFFLED BY LENGTHY RENOVATION; 
</P>
<P>
RETAIL: THE BUENAVENTURA CENTER'S OWNERS REFUSE TO SAY HOW LONG THE WORK WILL 
LAST AND WHETHER A SECOND FLOOR OR A NEW ANCHOR STORE WILL BE ADDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For nearly two years, construction crews have been drilling, pounding and 
hammering away at Buenaventura Mall, the 26-year-old regional shopping center 
in Ventura that is a landmark of western Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
On the face of it, the crews have made progress, installing attractive glass 
ceilings and renovating the mall's center court and west wing. Next, they're 
going to refurbish the east wing. 
</P>
<P>
In the minds of many tenants and shoppers, however, the work being done at 
Buenaventura Mall -- the name was changed in August from Buenaventura Plaza -- 
has created something else: a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the center's 90 retailers nor members of the general public seem to 
know the ultimate goal of the building project at the center, situated just off 
the Ventura Freeway and bordered by Main Street, Mills Road and Telegraph Road. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants -- some of whom say their businesses already have been seriously 
damaged by the lengthy construction project -- say they have no idea when the 
work will end. Some say they have heard it may continue for as long as another 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
The mystery has been fueled by the attitude of Buenaventura Mall's owner, the 
MaceRich Co. of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
The company speaks of negotiations in progress but won't say whether this means 
another department store will join the present anchors -- JC Penney and the 
Broadway. Some merchants believe such an addition is needed. 
</P>
<P>
Workers have sunk heavy pylons into the ground throughout much of the mall, but 
management won't confirm or deny rumors that a second level of stores will be 
added to the 825,000-square-foot center. 
</P>
<P>
Most frustrating of all to some tenants and shoppers, MaceRich and Cayse 
Osterlund, the mall's manager, will not say when the work will be completed. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't comment on that," Osterlund said when asked about a report that 
completion could be four years away. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, some of Buenaventura's storekeepers -- and some of their customers -- 
are seriously questioning whether the improvements are worth all the dust and 
din. 
</P>
<P>
Since construction started, at least seven tenants have left the mall. One of 
those who left did so because "it got so noisy people couldn't hear us on the 
phone." 
</P>
<P>
A tenant who has stayed, Dean Duke, manager of the mall's Radio Shack, 
estimates his sales are off 10% due to customer confusion and inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
Danuta Burke, manager of the Miller's Outpost in the mall, says she has heard 
customers complain "about the inside being dusty, and all the hammering and 
clamoring and detours . . . I'm afraid a lot of people who used to shop here 
are now going to The Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
Burke is one of several Buenaventura Mall retailers who worry that they are 
losing customers to The Oaks Mall, the Thousand Oaks center that is the 
county's largest. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Word, manager of the JC Penney store that anchors Buenaventura Mall's north 
end, acknowledged having a soft sales month in September, but said, "It's hard 
to say whether it was caused by the construction or the economy." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added: "The construction -- especially the problems in the parking lot 
-- hasn't really helped business." 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers, too, say they've been inconvenienced by the project, which started in 
February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I still come here occasionally, but I've been doing most of my shopping 
elsewhere since the construction started a couple of years ago," said Randy 
Bluhm of Camarillo. "The noise and all that definitely bothers me." 
</P>
<P>
"One day I had to park by Penney's and walk a long way to get to the Hallmark 
store. It was confusing," Pat Flanagan-Stelling of Ventura said, referring to 
the parking lot on Mills Road, which until two weeks ago was fenced off to 
create a storage area for construction equipment and building material. 
</P>
<P>
She said she still shops at Buenaventura, "but not as often as I used to. Now I 
also go to the Esplanade or The Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura's manager, Osterlund, admitted receiving some complaints, but said 
that's unavoidable under the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried to appease our customers and tenants to the best of our ability," 
he said. He added that most of the work which tenants and customers have 
complained about has been suspended until after the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
Osterlund maintained that despite the soft economy, business at the center has 
improved this year. But he refused to give figures -- and a number of tenants 
questioned his report. 
</P>
<P>
"I can say that our sales through August this year were up compared to last 
year," Osterlund said. He conceded, however, that he does not receive reports 
from Penney's or the Broadway, whose corporate parents do not disclose sales 
results at individual stores. 
</P>
<P>
As an example of the mystery that surrounds the work being done at the mall, an 
artist's rendering displayed in the center court promises "an arched entry 
crowned by a 45-foot-high glass canopy" and "a two-story-high skylit ceiling, 
with parquet flooring, tile planters, tree grates and sconce light fixtures." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing, however, is said about the two chief subjects of conjecture among the 
mall's tenants -- whether a second floor of stores will be installed, and 
whether one or more new department stores will be added. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Osterlund nor officials at MaceRich would answer these questions. 
</P>
<P>
The tenants, therefore, are left to wonder about the mall's future. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been driving huge pylons into the ground, getting ready for the second 
level," said Duke of Radio Shack. "They've said from the start that there would 
be a second level. I've heard it will take four years before it's completed." 
</P>
<P>
Word, Penney's manager, said he also has heard rumors, "but nothing definite," 
about plans to add a third department store. 
</P>
<P>
"It would help a lot," he said. "We would especially welcome an upscale 
department store. That would assure the viability of the center." 
</P>
<P>
Some tenants said they have heard that not one but two department stores may be 
added. Robinson's, Bullock's and Nordstrom are the names most frequently 
mentioned as potential newcomers, these tenants said. 
</P>
<P>
A MaceRich official who requested anonymity said, "Because of negotiations that 
are now going on, I can tell you very little about our plans for Buenaventura." 
He refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
MaceRich, which says it is the second-largest mall operator in California, 
acquired Buenaventura Mall in 1987. The company is privately held and thus does 
not have to divulge as much detailed information about its activities as 
publicly held concerns do. 
</P>
<P>
While most merchants at Buenaventura feel the improvements being made will help 
them in the long run, some strongly criticize the way the renovations are being 
carried out. 
</P>
<P>
"Two things that they did really hurt us," Duke said. "For months, they closed 
the main entrance on Mills Road. That confused and inconvenienced a lot of 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"Then they fenced off the parking lot to make a storage area for construction 
equipment. Because of that, you couldn't drive directly from one end to the 
other, between the Broadway and Penney's." 
</P>
<P>
Duke said that in contrast to a significant drop in his store's business, sales 
at other Radio Shacks in the county have been at least holding their own, even 
in a near-recession. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that things are very slow in this mall because of all the work 
that's been going on," he said. "I've been feeling the pinch since last March 
or April." 
</P>
<P>
Karen Baker, assistant manager of Plaza Travel &amp; Cruises, one of the 
businesses that have left the mall since the renovations began, had three basic 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"First, they wanted to raise our rent considerably," she said. "Second, we do a 
lot of business on the phone, and the noise got so bad we were constantly 
telling people we'd have to call them back in five minutes. That didn't help 
our business any. 
</P>
<P>
"Third, the noise and dirt were so bad in the east wing, where we were located, 
that it discouraged foot traffic." Plaza Travel has now moved to Telephone Road 
Plaza, about a half-mile east of the Buenaventura Mall. 
</P>
<P>
Osterlund refused to comment about tenants that have left or about how many 
vacancies exist in Buenaventura. He pointed out, however, that several new 
stores have recently moved in or signed leases for space in the east wing, 
which is vacant while being renovated. 
</P>
<P>
Some Buenaventura tenants are reluctant to discuss how they've been affected by 
the construction. 
</P>
<P>
"My attorneys have told me not to comment," said Tom Van Gundy, manager of the 
Van Gundy &amp; Sons jewelry store, which recently was moved from the east to 
the west side of the center court. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants at the center's southern end, toward Main Street, say they have been 
affected less than others. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some noise and access problems, but on the whole it hasn't been 
detrimental," said Lina Kalbak, manager of Big 5 Sporting Goods. She added, "I 
trust they'll let us know if they're going to double-deck our end, however." 
</P>
<P>
Farther north, near Radio Shack, Tina Wilson, manager of the Shades Galore 
sunglasses stand, said she is in an especially good position to gauge foot 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still slow, even though both entrances are now open," she said. "But at 
least the smoke and pounding are gone for the time being."

COURSE HELPS POLICE APPLICANTS MEET PHYSICAL FITNESS STANDARDS

<TEXT>
<P>
No one has to tell Gwen Alferes Akins how difficult it is to become a police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
A part-time waitress, Akins, 33, knows that she must first get accepted by the 
Sheriff's Academy in Camarillo and then endure 22 weeks of physical and 
academic training there. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, Akins is enrolled for the second time in an 18-week course at 
Ventura College designed to prepare students for the physical demands made of 
recruits at the academy. 
</P>
<P>
Akins said she used to have a membership at a gymnasium but rarely took 
advantage of it. Now she boasts that she can jog more than two miles in 20 
minutes. "I'm now running all the time," she said. "I never ran before." 
</P>
<P>
The class, which meets twice a week, was designed by a former Ventura police 
officer and is intended to address one of the main reasons why recruits fail to 
make it through the academy: poor physical conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
Only two of every 1,000 people who apply to the academy graduate and become 
probationary officers, said Lt. Ken Kipp, the academy's commander. 
</P>
<P>
Most applicants are eliminated during a screening process that includes a 
background check, a polygraph test and a series of psychological, academic and 
physical tests, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Once applicants are accepted by the academy, there is a 17% attrition rate, 
which Kipp attributes mostly to poor physical conditioning and weak academic 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
A final physical fitness test at the academy, required by the state for police 
officers, requires recruits to, among other things, scale a six-foot chain-link 
fence, drag a 165-pound dummy for 35 yards and then sprint 440 yards on solid 
concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Goff, the professor who teaches the course at Ventura College, said he 
cannot guarantee that his students will pass the test. But he hopes that it 
will improve their chances. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, we don't talk about passing the academy," he said. "We talk about 
surviving the academy." 
</P>
<P>
In the class, Goff puts his students through a tough physical fitness routine 
that includes long-distance jogging and weight training. Each student is 
required to keep a daily record of his or her progress. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of kids come to me looking physically good. But they don't make it," 
said Goff, a tall, bespectacled man. Twenty percent of his class already has 
dropped out since the course began last month. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent visit to the class, Goff had his students jog nonstop on the 
college track for 30 minutes before sentencing them to 30 minutes of bench 
presses, pullups and arm curls in a weight training room. 
</P>
<P>
Goff said that as a final test he will require his students to perform at least 
10 pullups, 30 push-ups and 50 sit-ups, and to run at least three miles in 30 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"If you get a B or better, you should be able to survive our police academy," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even Mike Marostica, a 20-year-old aerobics instructor from Ventura, found 
himself exhausted after the 30-minute run. "Just because I can do aerobics 
doesn't mean I can do running," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For Anthony Juliano, 29, the most difficult aspect of the class is learning how 
to discipline himself. Before he took the course, Juliano used to eat fast 
food, drink beer and stay out late. Now, he said, he eats healthy food and 
rarely goes out on a date. 
</P>
<P>
However, Goff acknowledged that many recruits forget the importance of physical 
conditioning after they pass the academy. Then "it's doughnut time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The academy does not focus entirely on physical fitness. During a 21-week 
stint, recruits are also trained in firearm techniques, the contents of the 
state penal code and self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
But preparing recruits for the physical demands of being a police officer is a 
major part of academy training, Kipp said. The final physical test, commonly 
known as the Peace Officer Standards in Training exam, or POST, is mandated by 
the state for police officers. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need world-class runners," he said. "We need a person who can do the 
job right." 
</P>
<P>
The test, done at the academy's training facility at Camarillo Airport, begins 
with a 50-yard sprint around a series of orange cones. A deputy stands nearby, 
noting times with a stopwatch. 
</P>
<P>
The second segment requires recruits to dash 20 yards, climb over a six-foot 
chain-link fence and run to a finish line another 30 yards away. They repeat 
the exercise, with a solid wooden wall substituted for the chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
Each recruit must then grab a 165-pound dummy that is stuffed with sand and 
drag it 35 yards as fast as possible. A deputy explained that the exercise is 
intended to demonstrate how much strength it takes to drag a wounded person out 
of the line of fire. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no time limit for each test, more points are given for 
completing the tasks as rapidly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The final part of the physical fitness examination requires recruits to sprint 
440 yards on a paved street. 
</P>
<P>
While female recruits may not have the upper-body strength to drag the dummy, 
Kipp noted that the overall score for the test is cumulative, and women can 
bolster their final scores during the running and climbing elements of the 
test. 
</P>
<P>
Akins said Goff's class has made her realize that being in shape is a vital 
part of being a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the one thing that is going to keep you alive on the street," she 
said.

HOSPITALS RELY ON MARKETING FOR GOOD HEALTH; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMICS: OFFICIALS SAY INCREASED COMPETITION IS FORCING HOSPITALS TO FIND 
NICHES THAT ATTRACT MORE INSURED, PAYING PATIENTS.

<P>
Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks recently invited reporters 
to watch as a surgeon slit open a patient's chest. It was part of an effort to 
drum up publicity and business for the hospital's open-heart surgery program. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo went the low-tech 
route. Touting its use of leeches to unclog veins, the hospital latched onto a 
publicity bonanza aimed at improving its image -- and profitability. 
</P>
<P>
This month, Pleasant Valley opened a center for neurological injuries -- not 
because it gets many nerve-damage cases, but because it needs to fill beds -- 
and no other hospital in the area has such a unit. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Adventist Hospital was so desperate for patients a few years ago 
that it made illegal loans to lure physicians to the area and increase business 
at the hospital, according to a county grand jury. Management has changed since 
then, but the hospital is still striving to boost its patient load, a 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Marketing -- the art of spotting a need and filling it, packaging a product and 
selling it -- has become increasingly important to the economic survival of 
Ventura County's eight major hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"We're having to look a lot more for niches," said Monty Clark, director of the 
Ventura County office of the Hospital Council of Southern California. "Let's 
call it competition, because that's what it is." 
</P>
<P>
Several factors have combined to create the more competitive environment. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the typical patient is spending less time in the hospital, 
thanks to closer scrutiny by government and by insurance companies as well as 
advances in outpatient treatment. Nationally, the average hospital stay was 7.2 
days in 1987 -- a full day shorter than in 1970, according to the American 
Hospital Assn. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County last year, barely half of the 1,184 licensed acute-care 
hospital beds were occupied on an average day, according to state figures. 
</P>
<P>
Just as important as filling beds, however, is getting the right type of 
patient. Ventura County hospitals strive to attract insured, paying customers 
to offset losses from uninsured patients and inadequate reimbursements from the 
Medi-Cal and Medicare programs. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have is a competitive environment, with hospitals going after the 
privately insured patients," said Lori Aldrete, vice president of 
communications for the California Assn. of Hospitals. "The marketing you see is 
geared to attracting private, paying patients who help subsidize the losses." 
</P>
<P>
Less than a decade ago, Aldrete said, marketing was not part of the industry. 
"If the hospital had anybody, he was usually called the community relations 
director whose main function was to hold community events like health fairs and 
hospital tours -- very warm and fuzzy stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Today, presenting a warm and caring image to prospective patients is only one 
of the elements in a successful marketing program, hospital officials say. Just 
as important, they say, are finding a niche in a changing medical marketplace 
and meeting the needs of physicians and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
For smaller hospitals such as Pleasant Valley (81 acute-care beds), Ojai Valley 
Community (71) and Santa Paula Memorial (60), finding a niche is easy: They 
provide basic hospital services to a limited geographic area. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasant Valley considers Camarillo, Somis and Moorpark as its service area. 
Santa Paula Memorial draws from Santa Paula, Fillmore, Piru and Saticoy. Ojai 
Valley's name defines its territory. Marketing efforts of all three hospitals 
are designed to attract nearby residents who need emergency treatment, 
maternity care, and the more routine types of diagnosis and surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the things people go to a hospital for, we can take care of here," 
said Sheryl Rudie, a Pleasant Valley spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
But Pleasant Valley also is licensed for 99 long-term-care beds, many of which 
are often empty. So this month the hospital carved out a new niche for itself 
with the opening of a 12-bed unit for patients with head and other neurological 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
As a hospital news release noted, it's the only unit of its kind between San 
Luis Obispo and the San Fernando Valley. "If you can find a program that fills 
a need, that you can get reimbursed for, and you can better utilize the space 
you have, it's a win-win situation," said Joe Harrington, assistant 
administrator at Pleasant Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The county-owned Ventura County Medical Center has its niche defined by state 
law: to be the "provider of last resort" for indigent patients. But officials 
there try to attract paying customers to balance the patient mix -- and the 
ledgers. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the patients at the 180-bed hospital are on the Medi-Cal 
program, another 10% are on Medicare and about 20% have no insurance, said Phil 
Wessels, director of the county's Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
To attract insured patients, Wessels said, the hospital tries to counter its 
image as the "county hospital" for the poor. A few years ago, it changed its 
name from Ventura County General Hospital in an effort to enhance its image. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make the community aware that we're not just for indigents," 
Wessels said. "We have a lot of specialized services." 
</P>
<P>
As the county's only teaching hospital, Wessels said, Ventura County Medical 
Center attracts physicians who want to learn the latest techniques from 
specialists with the UCLA School of Medicine, which is affiliated with the 
hospital. But as a county agency, the hospital has no public relations budget, 
he said. It doesn't even have an ad in the Yellow Pages. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, marketing and public relations are major activities at the 
county's other large hospitals: St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard 
(257 beds); Los Robles (228); Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura (192); and 
Simi Valley Adventist (115). 
</P>
<P>
In marketing itself to the public, St. John's emphasizes its affiliation with 
the Sisters of Mercy. One of six sisters at the hospital visits almost every 
patient at least once, said Trish Bartel, St. John's director of marketing. The 
hospital also sends out a newsletter to 89,000 residences, promoting services 
such as its emergency room, women's services, oncology and open-heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, St. John's purchased nearby Channel Islands Community 
Hospital and turned it into an outpatient center. With the recent conversion of 
Anacapa Adventist Hospital to substance-abuse treatment, St. John's became the 
only full-service hospital in the Oxnard-Port Hueneme area. 
</P>
<P>
St. John's faces tough competition, however, in high-tech fields such as 
open-heart surgery, primarily from Community Memorial just six miles away, but 
also from Los Robles. 
</P>
<P>
"You need a certain amount of surgeries to maintain credibility," said an 
official at another hospital who asked for anonymity. "There are a finite 
number of open-heart surgeries per year in this county. Split among three 
hospitals, each may end up with barely enough." 
</P>
<P>
Los Robles spokeswoman Kathy Flaherty said its open-heart program feels some 
heat from St. John's, which is planning a major expansion of its cardiology 
unit. But Los Robles' main competitors for open-heart patients are hospitals in 
Los Angeles County, Flaherty said, because many Thousand Oaks residents work in 
Los Angeles or used to live there. 
</P>
<P>
Los Robles' marketing efforts address that problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Heart patients don't have to travel to Los Angeles County for the 'best' 
physicians and treatment," a recent Los Robles press release proclaimed, noting 
that local patients can have family members "only minutes away during a most 
critical time." 
</P>
<P>
"Research also proves that such a psychological edge promotes faster recovery!" 
the release added. 
</P>
<P>
Community Memorial considers the county hospital, only two blocks away, to be 
its main competitor in the city of Ventura, spokesman Michael Lurie said. In 
1985, Community Memorial added an emergency room to its service in part because 
it was losing prospective patients to the county hospital, Lurie said. 
</P>
<P>
But a more basic reason, he said, was the need to be a full-service hospital, 
both to satisfy physicians and to get insurance company contracts. Without an 
emergency room, he said, health maintenance organizations and other insurance 
companies would not include Community Memorial among their approved hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"It really goes to trying to serve the market," Lurie said. "In this case, the 
market is insurance companies. They pay the bills. We have to adapt to meet 
their needs." 
</P>
<P>
Hospital marketers say they constantly face the question of how to allocate 
their efforts among the public, physicians and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still some controversy over how much advertising to the public makes 
sense for a hospital," Lurie said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Community Memorial promotes its emergency room in radio ad 
testimonials, partly because it is a new service and partly because the patient 
usually decides which emergency room to use. 
</P>
<P>
Like most Ventura County hospitals, Community Memorial also promotes its 
obstetrics facilities directly to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"Families have nine months to decide, so they do shop around," Lurie said. "For 
open-heart surgery, it's less clear-cut that you would want to advertise." 
</P>
<P>
By adding high-tech procedures, hospitals may enhance their image with the 
public, but the real purpose is to satisfy physicians, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though patients come in for some things, most things are 
physician-referred," said Aldrete of the state hospital association. 
</P>
<P>
Ashby at the county medical center agreed. "Clearly hospitals compete for the 
favor of physicians in the community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To attract physicians -- and through them, more patients -- hospitals often do 
more subtle things than provide the latest diagnostic and surgical equipment. 
Some, such as Los Robles, have lots of professional office space available in 
nearby buildings. Others provide doctors with a free paging service or a 
separate dining room in the hospital cafeteria. Some provide a list of staff 
physicians to emergency room patients who have no regular physician. 
</P>
<P>
"Every hospital has a certain core group of physicians that consider that 
hospital 'their' hospital," said Dr. Richard Ashby, director of physician 
service at Ventura County Medical Center. "Hospitals are always trying to 
solidify that." 
</P>
<P>
A county grand jury in June accused Simi Valley Adventist of violating state 
law by making hundreds of thousands of dollars in non-repayable loans and 
providing low-priced space and equipment to physicians in exchange for 
referring patients to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Patten, a hospital vice president, blamed the practice on the hospital's 
former administration. The hospital, however, still makes loans of up to 
$100,000 to help needed specialists locate in Simi Valley. The physicians are 
not required to send patients to the hospital, he said.

<P>
FERGUSON'S TACTICS ARE QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first glance, all the stars seem to line up for Democratic congressional 
candidate Anita Perez Ferguson: 
</P>
<P>
* Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino, a Ventura Republican, showed that he is 
vulnerable in his district when he barely escaped defeat by a Democrat in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
* This year, pollsters are measuring a strong current of voter dissatisfaction 
with incumbents. They say the "throw-the-bums-out" mentality grows each day 
that Congress fails to resolve the federal budget stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
* And Ferguson, an articulate, attractive candidate, has emerged at a time when 
being a woman, a Latina and a fresh face are considered advantages. 
</P>
<P>
But Democratic and Republican strategists contend that so far Ferguson has not 
managed to capitalize on these political assets. Nor has she taken advantage of 
Lagomarsino's absence while he is stuck in Washington with round-the-clock 
votes on budget matters. 
</P>
<P>
"Without him here, she could have raised a lot of heck," said John L. Davies, a 
political consultant in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"She is not banging away, attacking his weaknesses with strong organized 
research about his record," he said. For his part, Lagomarsino is confident 
enough of his reelection prospects to allow his campaign manager to quit six 
weeks before the election and an out-of-town consultant to run the campaign 
from afar. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly don't want to create an impression that we think it is a snap," 
Lagomarsino said. "If people got the impression that I didn't care, they 
wouldn't either." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Lagomarsino campaign has no plans to change its strategy -- even after 
Ferguson's most successful attack last week linking Lagomarsino to the nation's 
savings and loan scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson grabbed headlines by pouncing on a 1986 letter that Lagomarsino signed 
with 15 other House Republicans that pressured the nation's top S&amp;L 
regulator for secret records. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin J. Gray, former chairman of the Home Loan Bank Board, called the letter a 
poorly disguised attempt to feed confidential information to the Irvine-based 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan and Charles H. Keating Jr., its indicted owner. 
</P>
<P>
Gray said the congressmen who signed the letter "allowed themselves to be duped 
by people like Charles Keating" and suggested "they should know what they sign 
and who they do favors for." 
</P>
<P>
The negative publicity put Lagomarsino on the defensive. The congressman said 
he signed the innocent-looking letter at the request of a Republican colleague 
and stressed that he has never met Keating or received any donations from him 
or his S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Wickers, Lagomarsino's campaign consultant, said he didn't think the 
disclosure would significantly shrink Lagomarsino's lead over Ferguson. 
Campaign polls showed Lagomarsino leading Ferguson 56% to 22% in June and gave 
similar figures in mid-September, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it is going to hurt us in any way, unless she is able to 
communicate it to the voters, and I don't think she is," Wickers said. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino, who raised $274,581 in contributions through September, compared 
to Ferguson's $115,127, began radio and television ads last week that promote 
him as a lawmaker concerned about helping his constituents and protecting the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Wickers said the campaign is prepared to spend its entire cash reserve of 
$155,000 on media ads and direct-mail brochures. 
</P>
<P>
As for Ferguson, campaign manager Sam Rodriguez said his candidate has received 
an infusion of cash in the last three weeks -- although far short of the 
$400,000 Rodriguez initially said was needed to win. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said the campaign now has $68,165 to spend on ads to portray 
Lagomarsino's poor environmental record and opposition to abortion as out of 
step with his district. Ferguson strategists are also considering raising the 
issue of ethics and the letter linking Lagomarsino to the S&amp;L debacle. 
</P>
<P>
In one sign of how the Ferguson campaign is doing, Rodriguez and his rough-hewn 
style have become an issue in Democratic circles. 
</P>
<P>
"He's put people off," said Don Cannon, a coordinator for the Ventura/Oxnard 
chapter of the National Organization for Women. "Most people won't go through 
Sam to do anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Rose, a seasoned Democratic consultant, sees Rodriguez in that 
"know-it-all stage" that deflates after campaign managers lose a few races. 
"Sometimes he is pushing Sam Rodriguez more than he is pushing his candidate." 
</P>
<P>
More significantly, Rose believes that Rodriguez has incorrectly steered 
Ferguson away from solidifying a base of core Democratic supporters needed to 
carry her in a low-turnout election. 
</P>
<P>
"We Democrats have a harder time getting our voters to get out and vote," Rose 
said. She said it is a mistake for Ferguson to assume that environmental and 
liberal voters are behind her just as they were behind state Sen. Gary K. Hart 
(D-Santa Barbara). Hart came within 4,000 votes of beating Lagomarsino in 1988. 
Ferguson was an aide to Hart until recently. 
</P>
<P>
"She wasted the whole summer going after senior citizens, which are 
Lagomarsino's strongest supporters," said Reb Wayne, Lagomarsino's former 
campaign manager. Wayne said he left Lagomarsino for a better job, "when it 
became obvious to me that my presence was not critical to his winning." 
</P>
<P>
Davies, a consultant for Republican and Democratic candidates, agrees that 
Ferguson has not set her priorities wisely. "She should be the darling of 
younger voters and women. Instead, she is out at senior homes, trying to 
perform brain surgery. If nothing happens soon, it's all over." 
</P>
<P>
Mindy Lorenz, a Cal State Northridge art history professor, is in the race as a 
write-in candidate for the fledgling Green Party that promotes peace and 
ecology. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenz hopes to attract voters disgusted with both major parties but more than 
likely will draw voters who would otherwise support Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
But Lorenz argues that the established Democratic Party has never fully backed 
Ferguson because Hart still has his eye on the congressional seat. "They wanted 
someone to fill in until Gary Hart comes back."

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: TRUCK CRASHES INTO CAR, TRAPPING YOUTH

A Thousand Oaks teen-ager was trapped in his car for more than an hour Saturday 
afternoon and a second teen-ager was injured when one of the boys swerved into 
oncoming traffic to avoid hitting a car that had stopped in front of him, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Fire Department worked with the Jaws of Life to free David 
Stufkosky from his car, closing Avenida de Los Arboles, one of the city's major 
streets, for more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Stufkosky, 18, was at Los Robles Regional Medical Center last night with an 
open fracture to his left leg and head injuries, said Sgt. Will Howe of the 
Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Troy Waters, 16, suffered moderate injuries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Waters, traveling east in a pickup truck about 3 p.m., swerved head-on into 
Stufkosky's car after the car in front of Waters stopped to make a left turn. 
The impact pushed the front of Stufkosky's sedan onto his body. KIRSTEN LEE

CITY'S BIRTHDAY PARTY; 
</P>
<P>
CAMARILLO FIESTA CELEBRATES SPIRIT OF THE COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Nguyen Vu, 16, smiled broadly Saturday as he watched high school bands, 
Clydesdale horses and a float shaped like a giant hot dog go by his front door 
on Brently Avenue as the 26th annual Camarillo Fiesta kicked off with a parade. 
</P>
<P>
For Vu, a Rio Mesa High School freshman who arrived in the United States from 
Vietnam five months ago, it was his first American parade, and it was 
impressive. 
</P>
<P>
"I really like it," Vu said as a bright red antique car honked on its way past. 
</P>
<P>
Vu joined more than 4,000 residents celebrating the 26th anniversary of 
Camarillo's incorporation and the 126th anniversary of the birth of the city's 
namesake, Adolfo Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
"For our parade it's a big turnout," said Camarillo Mayor Charlotte Craven. 
"It's a citywide birthday party." 
</P>
<P>
The party began Saturday morning with 5K and 10K runs, a Mexican breakfast and 
a bicycle rally, in addition to the parade that began at Ponderosa and Arneill 
roads and ended half a mile away at Community Center Park. 
</P>
<P>
More a celebration of community spirit than a display of pageantry, the parade 
included Brownie and Girl Scout troops, Ventura County firetrucks, bands from 
Camarillo and Rio Mesa high schools and the Camarillo White Horses, descendants 
of prized horses that were once owned by the Adolfo Camarillo family. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Camarillo resident Dick Vogel and his family viewed the parade from 
lawn chairs in front of their Brently Avenue house. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lived here for 20 years, and this is one of the better ones," said 
Vogel, adding that the number of participants has increased as the town has 
grown. "It helps community spirit a lot." 
</P>
<P>
At the Community Center, three giant birthday cakes were cut, food was sold and 
a range of entertainment was presented, including musical groups, carnival 
rides, an art exhibit and drill teams and gymnasts from local schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it," said 13-year Camarillo resident Jennifer Conn, 41, munching 
hamburgers on the Community Center lawn with her husband, Bill, 44, and son, 
Chris, 8. "Some years there are more people in the parade than watching it, but 
that's what I love about it. . . . You come and you recognize most of the 
people. It has a real nice community feeling." 
</P>
<P>
For the past 10 years, the fiesta has been organized by the Camarillo Fiesta 
Assn., a nonprofit organization that receives some funding from the city, 
association President Margie Benchwick said. Booths were rented to independent 
vendors, and entertainers performed free of charge, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowds are getting bigger as the town has grown," Benchwick said. "The 
exciting thing is we still have that hometown flavor." 
</P>
<P>
The festival continues today, starting at 7 a.m. with a pancake breakfast at 
the Community Center, 1605 Burnley St. Booths, carnival and an art exhibit will 
continue from noon to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my 20th year in Camarillo and it's by far the best," said Casey 
Marmon, who brought her four children. "I had thought about moving to Virginia, 
but after today, I'm staying here."

VOTERS DISAGREE OVER BENEFITS OF JOINING SANTA CLARITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If her Canyon Country neighborhood were annexed by Santa Clarita, says resident 
Nancy Grass Hemmert, she would have a greater voice in local affairs -- and a 
greater chance of finding solutions to local problems. 
</P>
<P>
But to Bruce K. Bell, annexation by Santa Clarita would create another layer of 
government in a nation ruled by too many governments already. Bell wants his 
neighborhood to remain an unincorporated part of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Hemmert and Bell represent conflicting views on Measure Q, a proposal that 
would add 1.6 square miles of county land -- and 5,000 residents -- to Santa 
Clarita. The area's 3,449 registered voters will decide the matter at the polls 
Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
The election was prompted by a protest against annexation spearheaded last 
February by Bell, a seven-year Canyon Country resident who describes himself as 
"definitely a Libertarian. I look for private, free-market solutions before 
resorting to government solutions." 
</P>
<P>
The annexation of the area, known as Pinetree-Timberlane, had been approved by 
the Santa Clarita City Council and the Local Agency Formation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The annexation would have become final had not Bell and a small group of 
neighbors gathered signatures on protest petitions from 21% of the area's 
voters, well over the 15% needed under law to force the election. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of Santa Clarita's incorporation three years ago had hoped that 
Pinetree-Timberlane would be included in the boundaries of the new city. But 
for reasons that are still unclear to the incorporation leaders, 
Pinetree-Timberlane was omitted from Santa Clarita when LAFCO, which oversees 
annexations and incorporations, drew the final boundaries of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Carl Boyer III said the 25 candidates who ran for Santa Clarita's 
first City Council in 1987 all pledged to support annexation of 
Pinetree-Timberlane if the cityhood drive succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
Boyer, speaking at a forum on Measure Q that attracted 50 area residents last 
week, noted that more than 50% of Pinetree-Timberlane voters signed 
incorporation petitions three years ago. The council was confident the area 
wanted to join the city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Bell and some neighbors complained that the city launched its annexation 
drive without consulting the residents first. 
</P>
<P>
"As a staunch Jeffersonian, I'd like to register a complaint," said John 
Hassel, a 22-year Canyon Country resident. The city's unilateral action, he 
said, was "quite similar to Kuwait being asked to annex to Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Howard P. (Buck) McKeon conceded that the council had moved too 
hastily. "I think we made a mistake," he said. "We just assumed people wanted 
to be in the city." 
</P>
<P>
Bell and annexation opponents have circulated flyers charging that city 
government will be no better than county government: "We don't want higher 
taxes and less freedom! Like you, we just want to live our lives the way we 
want to, not the way City Hall wants." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon and Boyer denied that cityhood would mean higher taxes. They and other 
annexation supporters stressed that belonging to the city provides political 
power unattainable by the residents of unincorporated county territory. 
</P>
<P>
"The city may have problems, but at least you have a chance with the city," 
Hemmert said. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Cameron, a former member of the city formation committee, noted that two 
city councilmen attended last week's forum to answer the questions of Bell and 
others. How many times, he asked, had residents seen Supervisors Mike 
Antonovich and Pete Schabarum in the Santa Clarita Valley together? 
</P>
<P>
"I saw them in a parade once," responded resident Dave Doughman. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the residents attending the meeting appeared to favor joining Santa 
Clarita. Others remained unconvinced. "I don't see any clear-cut advantage 
under cityhood," Hassel said.

COUNTY TO BUY PLANNED LUMBERYARD SITE; 
</P>
<P>
CHATSWORTH: THE 13-ACRE PARCEL OF SOUTHERN PACIFIC LAND MAY BECOME A 
TRANSPORTATION CENTER, REVITALIZING THE COMMUNITY'S DOWNTOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 13-acre site in the heart of the Chatsworth commercial district will not be 
developed into a controversial lumber transfer station because it has been 
included in a $450-million package of property to be sold to the county's 
transportation agency by Southern Pacific, officials said last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Devonshire Street site is likely to become a transportation center where 
commuters can transfer among buses, shuttles and trains, said Nikolas 
Patsaouras, president of the Rapid Transit District board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
The site also could serve as the northern terminus of a proposed 16.5-mile 
bikeway that would start in North Hollywood, Patsaouras said. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference at the site, Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson 
hailed the purchase as a "very good thing for Chatsworth" and suggested that 
the Southern Pacific property could be the linchpin to stimulate redevelopment 
of the community's downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson, who represents the area, joined local civic and business leaders in 
calling for construction of a railroad station "that reflects the cultural and 
architectural heritage of Chatsworth." 
</P>
<P>
Members of Citizens for Chatsworth distributed photographs of the Old 
West-style Chatsworth train depot that was torn down in 1962 and suggested that 
a new station could be built to look like it. 
</P>
<P>
Community leaders were angered two months ago when they learned that Southern 
Pacific planned to develop the long-vacant site, which is next to the 
railroad's Coast Main Line, as a storage yard for lumber brought in by rail and 
bound for local builders and lumberyards. 
</P>
<P>
Activists said up to 70 lumber-hauling trucks a day would destroy the 
small-town ambience of Chatsworth and pose a safety hazard to a nearby 
elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Anderson, a Southern Pacific spokesman in San Francisco, said the railroad 
"has no alternative plans for a lumber transfer station elsewhere at this time, 
but we are studying the demand." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission and Southern Pacific recently 
announced agreement on the sale of 177 miles of railroad right of way that 
transit officials say will be used to dramatically expand the region's rail 
transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Fernando Valley, the purchase includes the east-west Burbank Branch 
freight line, which crosses the Valley from Burbank to Canoga Park parallel to 
Chandler and Victory boulevards and Oxnard and Topham streets before turning 
north parallel to Canoga Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
By 2001, the commission plans to extend the downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro 
Rail subway west along the Burbank Branch line from North Hollywood to the San 
Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the purchase agreement, the commission will obtain rent-free use of 
69 miles of Southern Pacific's two main lines to the north, which diverge in 
Burbank. The agreement gives the commission track rights on these two lines 
from downtown Los Angeles to Moorpark and Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
The commission plans to launch commuter rail service on those lines within two 
years, carrying commuters downtown on intercity rail cars pulled by 
conventional diesel-electric locomotives. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also includes purchase of a 40-foot strip alongside Southern 
Pacific's Coast and San Joaquin lines for possible future light-rail lines 
similar to the Blue Line operating between Los Angeles and Long Beach.

PORT OF LOS ANGELES SEEKS EXEMPTION TO NEW PARKING TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council last week tentatively agreed that the city's new 
parking tax should not apply to any of the huge lots in the harbor where about 
250,000 cars each year are stored and processed for sale after their arrival at 
the port. 
</P>
<P>
The exemption is being sought by Port of Los Angeles officials who fear that 
the tax might drive away the harbor's seven auto storage and processing 
companies. In all, the tax would cost the firms $250,000 to $500,000 each year. 
</P>
<P>
The city's new tax, devised by Mayor Tom Bradley, took effect in August and 
adds a 10% surcharge to parking in the city. The levy is expected to generate 
about $30 million annually, according to city budget analysts. 
</P>
<P>
If the council decides against the exemption and any companies decide to leave, 
their business would be welcome in other harbors such as Port Hueneme and San 
Diego, officials there said. 
</P>
<P>
City lawmakers already have modified the tax once, to exclude apartment 
buildings. The council last week moved toward an exemption for the port 
businesses, arguing they were never meant to be included in the new levy. A 
final vote on the waiver is expected in several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The exemption, proposed Wednesday by Harbor-area Councilwoman Joan Milke 
Flores, would not affect the city's revenue estimates from the parking tax 
because the businesses were not specifically included in the original study of 
the tax, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, officials said, at least one of the companies that stores and 
processes new cars on 270 acres in the port recently received a tax assessment 
on parking from the Los Angeles city clerk's office. That surcharge led the 
Harbor Department and Flores to push for the exemption. 
</P>
<P>
In a motion that was approved without discussion, Flores argued that the 
council had approved the new parking tax with the understanding that it would 
only apply to commercial parking lots, such as those in business districts. 
</P>
<P>
Applying the tax to the port businesses, Flores told her colleagues, was not 
only unintended but could lead the companies to leave the harbor, jeopardizing 
hundreds of jobs and a significant part of the port's annual income. 
</P>
<P>
The concern, port officials added, is that the tax could hurt the Harbor 
Department in its competition with other West Coast ports that vie for auto 
shipments -- a business that generates an estimated $6 million to $7 million 
annually for the Port of Los Angeles in land leases and wharfage fees. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Port of Los Angeles accounts for about 25% of all West Coast 
shipments of autos, port officials said the market has become increasingly 
competitive in recent years. That competition, they said, is evident from auto 
shipments to Port Hueneme and San Diego, which recently opened its first auto 
storage yard. And the competition extends to the Pacific Northwest, where at 
least one port has offered free land just to collect the wharfage fees on new 
autos passing through the port. 
</P>
<P>
"The tax would hurt us. It would be a problem," claimed Michael Lemke, property 
manager for the Port of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The specific exemption voted Wednesday would amend the city's parking tax law 
to exclude auto service companies preparing unregistered cars for sale or 
export. 
</P>
<P>
Before the proposed amendment returns for final action by the council and 
mayor, it is also expected to be reviewed by the city administrative office, 
where one analyst said Wednesday that the exemption for the auto storage 
companies is essentially a policy decision for the council. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at other ports saw Los Angeles' tax as an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the parking tax discourages people from using Los Angeles," said Port 
Hueneme's Deputy Executive Director Bill Buenger. "I don't know that it has or 
that it will, but I hope it does." 
</P>
<P>
While his harbor now accommodates only two storage yards for new cars, Buenger 
said Port Hueneme has plenty of space for additional business if it comes. 
"We've got acres of farmland around here, and that land could easily be 
converted," he said.

LUCK SIDES AGAIN WITH MARYLAND, 23-20; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: FIELD GOAL IN THE FINAL MINUTE LIFTS TERRAPINS TO 23-20 
VICTORY OVER DUKE. 
</P>

<P>
It is still too early to say what fate ultimately will be in store for the 
Maryland Terrapins this season, but 1990 already might be regarded as a turning 
point for the football program. 
</P>
<P>
There was evidence of that Saturday at Wallace Wade Stadium, when a 20-yard Dan 
DeArmas field goal with 50 seconds remaining provided the winning points in 
Maryland's 23-20 triumph over Duke. The 38-yard, seven-play drive that led to 
the kick was set up by a magnificent defensive stand -- plus a little bit of 
the luck that had gone against the Terrapins in recent seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We've worked too hard and come too far -- for the seniors it's been some hard 
times," said senior linebacker Scott Whittier. "We've tried to put those things 
behind us but we remember. We've come too far to lose a game like this one. 
This win came from all we've been through." 
</P>
<P>
Maryland (5-3, 3-2 in the Atlantic Coast Conference) made a number of big 
plays, including a 29-yard touchdown pass from Scott Zolak to Barry Johnson and 
a 19-yard end around scoring run by flanker Gene Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively the Terrapins got six sacks -- three by linebacker Jack Bradford, 
who had six other tackles and recovered a fumble. Whittier contributed 14 
stops. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, when the Blue Devils (3-4, 0-3) -- who had scored touchdowns on two of 
the their previous three possessions to tie the game at 20 -- took over with 
7:06 remaining, Maryland appeared to be in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Duke quarterback Billy Ray riddled the Maryland secondary throughout the second 
half. And when Maryland made the adjustment at the start of the crucial series, 
the Blue Devils ran four straight times to gain 25 yards to the Duke 36-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
On first down, Ray was pressured by defensive tackle Larry Webster and 
scrambled for a one-yard gain. On the next play, the snap from center Stewart 
Albright somehow trickled through Ray's legs and rolled 10 yards backward 
before the quarterback fell on it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have an answer for that one," said Maryland Coach Joe Krivak. "There 
are a lot of things you can look at, a fumble, a turnover ... in a close game 
there are eight to 10 different situations that can go for or against you." 
</P>
<P>
But by now the game had taken on an eerie tone, reminiscent of Maryland's 13-12 
victory over North Carolina State. That win came on a 25-yard DeArmas field 
goal with 11 seconds remaining -- after a fumble by Wolfpack running back 
Aubrey Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
Albright and Ray got their act together on third down but Bradford made his 
third sack, dropping Ray for an 11-yard loss. Maryland got another break when 
Randy Gardner's punt traveled only 26 yards, with Mike Hopson downing the ball 
at the Duke 42. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland took over with 3:23 remaining. A run by Troy Jackson gained four 
yards; on second down, Zolak rolled out to the left and threw to Jackson, 
standing alone in the right flat. The 17-yard gain moved the ball down to the 
Duke 21. On first down, Andre Vaughn gained two yards, but the Blue Devils were 
penalized for having 12 men on the field. 
</P>
<P>
The walkoff put the ball on the 9. Vaughn carried for one yard and Jackson for 
four. A third-down run failed, setting the stage for DeArmas, who after a Duke 
timeout booted his second game-winner. It was Maryland's fourth victory that 
was decided in the final three minutes of play. 
</P>
<P>
Although players and coaches on both sides called it ugly, the game was a 
strategist's delight. 
</P>
<P>
Duke's Randy Jones and Leroy Gallman each had returned kickoffs for touchdowns 
this season and Maryland had yielded an uncomfortable 28 yards per return, so 
Krivak decided to have Fred Ensign squib every kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
However, following DeArmas's field goal, Ensign kicked to Gallman -- "the 
lesser of two evils," said Krivak -- and the coverage team stopped him at the 
18. 
</P>
<P>
From there, Maryland put the pressure on Ray, with Webster getting a first-down 
sack. That pressure had come in part because defensive line coach Dennis Murphy 
had freed the junior from his normal duties. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me not to worry about responsibilities, just get pressure on the 
quarterback," Webster said. "I had to double check; I asked him if I could go 
anywhere I wanted to and he said yeah, just get the quarterback."

WHAT CAN UNSER DO AFTER A CLEAN SWEEP?; 
</P>
<P>
AUTO RACING: ALL OF HIS 1990 GOALS HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED, BUT THERE REMAINS A 
RACE TO WIN, TODAY AT LAGUNA SECA.

<P>
Al Unser Jr., Little Al to his racing peers and friends, is goal-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
Before the start of this year's CART Indy car season, the 28-year-old second 
generation driver set three primary goals: 1. Win the Indy car championship; 2. 
Win on an oval for the first time; 3. Win a 500-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
He accomplished them all. 
</P>
<P>
So what goals are left? 
</P>
<P>
"Win Laguna Seca, then start getting ready to win the championship again," he 
said matter-of-factly while preparing his Lola-Chevrolet for today's Champion 
Spark Plug 300 kilometer race on the twisting, hillside Laguna Seca Raceway 
course. 
</P>
<P>
"The nice part is that we won the championship," he said. "The hard part is 
going to be repeating what we did this year." 
</P>
<P>
What he and the Galles-Kraco team have done this year was to win six races -- 
including a record four in a row -- to clinch the $400,000 PPG Cup bonus in the 
next-to-last race of the season. He won consecutive races at Toronto, Michigan, 
Denver and Vancouver and also won at Long Beach and Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can win here, it will be seven and a CART record and I'd like that. I've 
won twice at Laguna Seca, but not in a championship race," Unser said. "I don't 
have to worry about being careful and running for points now that the 
championship is ours, so I'm going all out to win." 
</P>
<P>
Unser won the Marlboro Challenge, a special non-points race, last year the day 
before the Champion 500, and in 1982 he won a Can-Am race en route to the 
series championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning at Laguna Seca always means something special to a driver because it 
is such a wonderful facility," he said. "It's a true road racing track. It's 
got plenty of hills and the corkscrew is really something else." 
</P>
<P>
The corkscrew is a three-quarter-mile stretch from the top of the course that 
drops more than 200 feet in a series of switchback turns. 
</P>
<P>
Unser, who won 13 races on road courses before his first victory on an oval, 
scored his breakthrough on Milwaukee's mile oval and followed that with his 
first 500-mile victory, at Michigan International Speedway. The Michigan race 
was one of the closest and most exciting in Indy car annals, with Unser and 
Galles-Kraco teammate Bobby Rahal running in the fastest 500-mile race in CART 
history. The two traded the lead, often two or three times in the same lap, as 
they weaved and bobbed through traffic until Rahal found himself caught out on 
a caution flag and Unser slipped through to win with an average speed of 
189.727 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
What surprised spectators, both in person and on TV, was the tense high-speed 
duel between teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say it was scary out there, but it was pretty serious," Unser said. 
"I guess that showed everyone how much respect Bobby and I have for each other. 
There aren't a lot of drivers I would have diced with like that. 
</P>
<P>
"I put my life in Bobby Rahal's hands several times at Michigan, and it was 
great racing. I respect him to the utmost as a race car driver, and I guess 
that's why we did what we did, passing each other twice a lap and so on. We 
were running very close, wheel to wheel, and each of us held our own line, and 
I can tell you we were both trying very hard to win. There's no holding back 
between us just because we're on the same team." 
</P>
<P>
When Rick Galles and Maurice Kraines, owner of the Kraco team, merged their 
teams for the 1990 season with Unser and Rahal as drivers, most Indy car 
observers felt that having two high-profile drivers on the same team would not 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby and I were close friends off the track, with our wives being close 
friends, too, but before we started testing back last March and April we really 
didn't know a lot about each other. But as the season went along we found we 
worked real well together," Unser said. "I know a lot of people don't believe 
us, because race drivers all want to win themselves. But with both Bobby and 
myself, we want to see the team win before we want to see ourselves win. That's 
being very unselfish, but that's the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
Such an attitude is easy to have when you have won six races and a series 
championship, but how does it feel if you've finished second five times and 
have failed to win a race for the first time in your eight years as an Indy car 
driver? 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I want to win, but with all the attention being paid Al, and rightfully 
so, not many people realize that even without winning, I've had my best year 
since 1987," Rahal said. 
</P>
<P>
That was the year Rahal won his second consecutive PPG Cup championship for the 
late Jim Trueman's Truesports team. 
</P>
<P>
"And I couldn't come much closer to winning a race than I did at Michigan. I 
drove that day about as hard and fast as I can. The car has been working very 
well, the team is very strong and I couldn't be happier to see anyone win than 
Al. Unless it was myself." 
</P>
<P>
Rahal has one last chance to win today on a course he once seemed to own. From 
1984 to 1987, Rahal won four consecutive times at Laguna Seca. 
</P>
<P>
Unser's Indy car championship is the sixth for the Albuquerque, N. M., racing 
family. His father, Al, won in 1970, 1983 and 1985, the last when he edged his 
son by one point. Bobby Unser, Al's brother and Al Jr.'s uncle, won in 1968 and 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
Al Unser Jr. beat Michael Andretti for the championship in a second-generation 
points race. In 1969 their fathers battled to the final race before Mario 
Andretti beat Al Unser to the championship. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a special satisfaction in beating Michael, sure, especially this year 
since he was pretty much everybody's choice to win before the season started," 
Unser said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then it's sort of special, too, because I've known Michael since I was 10 or 
11, and we've raced each other since the day we met: go-karts, snowmobiles, 
bikes, everything. Our fathers were teammates for several years, and we were 
together a lot. It's not like we're the Hatfields and the McCoys, feuding all 
the time. But we're definitely competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Unser clinched the championship two weeks ago at Nazareth, Pa. A crash knocked 
Unser out of that race, but Andretti finished only fifth. It left Unser with 
194 points to 157 for Andretti, and the maximum points available today is 22. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great feeling to win, but having Little Al in the hospital when we 
won it kind of took the edge off a little," Galles said. Shortly after the 
halfway point in the Nazareth race, Unser was involved in an accident with Indy 
500 winner Arie Luyendyk and Danny Sullivan. Unser suffered a mild concussion 
and was taken to Eaton (Pa.) Hospital for observation. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I'd be laying in a hospital bed with a headache when I won the 
championship," Unser said. "But I'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
Both the younger Andretti and Unser have been rumored to be switching from Indy 
cars to Formula One, but Unser said he's decided to stay with Indy cars. 
</P>
<P>
"The rumors last summer were true that I was thinking about Formula One, and I 
had a few feelers, but after I signed my new contract with Galles at Toronto, 
it ended all that," Unser said. "I know that Michael is still serious enough 
about it that he'd make the move if conditions were right. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, from my aspect of it, I'd like to see Michael go. It would 
definitely be one less man to outrun to win the races. And that's what it's all 
about. Winning."

THE FUMBLEROOSKI: A FUNNY PLAY, BUT USC ISN'T LAUGHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dick Tomey thinks the fumblerooski must have been invented by Amos Alonzo 
Stagg. 
</P>
<P>
"It's as old as the hills," he said, "but you've got to have the guts to use 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Three times this season, the Arizona coach has had the courage to call the play 
where the center drops the ball on the ground as though he were laying an egg, 
the quarterback runs a phantom option play and the left guard picks up the ball 
and runs for glory. 
</P>
<P>
On opening night, it worked for 24 yards and a touchdown in the Wildcats' upset 
over Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks later, it was stopped for no gain by California. 
</P>
<P>
And Saturday in the Coliseum it went for 28 yards to set up the touchdown that 
put the Wildcats out of reach of USC, 28-17, early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Way to go, Speedy," a teammate shouted to Mr. Fumblerooski, left guard Rick 
Warren, in the noisy Arizona dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably should have scored," said Warren, wearing a smile. "Or at least 
made a better cut." 
</P>
<P>
What Warren -- all 6-feet-1 and 251 pounds of him -- did was chug 28 yards to 
the USC three-yard line while the Trojans were looking the other way early in 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, few other people besides those on the Arizona bench saw 
exactly what happened. 
</P>
<P>
"It's called 13 fumblerooski," Warren said. "Thirteen is our option play left. 
On the 13 fumblerooski, everybody else goes left and I go right. 
</P>
<P>
"It worked tonight and against Illinois. I don't think Cal knew what was 
happening, either, but some of their guys didn't chase our quarterback, so I 
just fell on the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Tomey, who was an assistant at UCLA, said the fumblerooski has been part of his 
playbook during his entire head coaching career at Arizona and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty hard to stop because you can't really prepare for it," he said. 
"We practice it once a week and our defense can't stop it." 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcat defense had less trouble with Todd Marinovich, who passed for only 
174 yards and was intercepted three times. 
</P>
<P>
Picking off two of Marinovich's passes was Darryl Lewis, the cornerback who was 
last seen in these parts intercepting a throw by Tommy Maddox and running 70 
yards for the game-winning touchdown against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
In his spare time Saturday, Lewis returned four punts for 79 yards, including a 
42-yarder that set up the Wildcats' second touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
This hasn't been a bad year for alumni of Nogales High in La Puente. When Lewis 
played second base there, one of the alums came by one day for batting 
practice. Somebody named Cecil Fielder. 
</P>
<P>
"What do I remember about him?" Lewis said. "He hit the ball real far." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' future was in football, although only Arizona, Hawaii and Colorado State 
bothered to recruit him. 
</P>
<P>
Tomey was the Hawaii coach. The Arizona coach was Larry Smith. And if Smith 
hadn't redshirted him in 1986, Lewis wouldn't have had the eligibility left to 
lead the Arizona secondary against USC. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an outstanding secondary," Tomey said. "But I think the key to our 
success against Marinovich was stopping their running game. No quarterback is 
as effective when he has to throw." 
</P>
<P>
One of Tomey's assistants kept shouting, "You gotta believe," as the Wildcats 
celebrated a week after being blown out by Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I had a good feeling about this game from Day 1," Tomey said. "I had 
that same feeling all week. 
</P>
<P>
"We deserved to lose last week to a team that outplayed us. Tonight, we 
outplayed USC and deserved to win." 
</P>
<P>
But, oh yes, there is still room for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"That guard needs to cut the corner better on the fumblerooski," Tomey said.

MIKE DOWNEY: THE MEEK HAVE INHERITED THE TURF IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Well, that "Bottom Ten" thing ought to be a riot this week. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble is, how will we be able to tell it from the Top Ten? 
</P>
<P>
One's as hilarious as the other. 
</P>
<P>
College football has never been funnier. The ratings are downside-up. Virginia 
is No. 1 in the nation -- yes, this nation. Notre Dame gets beat by Stanford, 
which can't beat anybody else. Michigan loses three times in six games. 
Northwestern wins twice. The Rose Bowl race is between . . . Washington and 
Cal? for the right to meet Illinois? 
</P>
<P>
Wait, it gets funnier. 
</P>
<P>
USC suddenly has those Freedom Bowl and Holiday Bowl scouts licking their lips. 
Brigham Young beats Miami, but loses to Oregon. Arizona beats Illinois and USC, 
but loses to Oregon State. Unbeaten Tennessee loses to much-beaten Alabama, 
9-6. Texas has a strong 1990 squad after taking the 1980s off. Kansas State 
beats somebody. Colorado beats somebody on fifth down. Michigan gets ranked No. 
1 with a record of 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
"Each Saturday is a surprise," was USC Coach Larry Smith's summation after 
Saturday's 35-26 loss to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
No, Lar. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing much surprises us now. 
</P>
<P>
We were surprised awhile ago when Washington beat USC by 31 points, and when 
the Trojans didn't score a point. We don't surprise so easy anymore. 
</P>
<P>
We wouldn't even have been surprised if you had benched Todd Marinovich. 
Changing quarterbacks in mid-game worked for Arizona. Might have worked for 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
One way to make sure Marinovich stays and plays in the NCAA and not the NFL 
next season might be to show him what the pro teams do when the quarterback 
isn't cutting the mustard -- yank him. Todd's entitled to an off day, sure. He 
has had a couple of them now. If there are any Heisman trophies in his future, 
they are probably in his distant future. 
</P>
<P>
The temptation to leave a super-duper quarterback out there, just in case he 
gets hot, could be irresistible. That's what Smith was doing Saturday. But 
there were times when Marinovich couldn't have completed a pass if the receiver 
had been allowed to call for a fair catch. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd is no different than a pro golfer or tennis player," Smith said. "We all 
have our bad days." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, but we can't replace a golfer or tennis player or even a coach when 
they're having a day. A quarterback having a bad day we can do something about. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona did. Its starter was George Malauulu. It's pronounced just the way it's 
spelled. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, Arizona's roster included players named Malauulu, Utu, Poumele, 
Fineanganofo and Mu Tagoal. And USC's included Tuiasosopo, Tuliau and Moi. 
</P>
<P>
For a while there, I thought I was watching a South Pacific 10 game. 
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, when Malauulu struggled, the Arizona coach replaced him with Ronald 
Veal, who played about as good a half of football as a player can play. 
</P>
<P>
USC, however, stuck with its starting quarterback, using understudy Shane Foley 
on only one play. 
</P>
<P>
Fittingly for this football season, it was one of the funniest plays we have 
ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
On a two-point conversion after a touchdown, Marinovich lined up at 
quarterback. Foley, a quarterback, lined up at tailback. And then Marinovich 
went into motion. 
</P>
<P>
That's right . . . the quarterback went into motion. 
</P>
<P>
But not just any motion. Marinovich walked to his right, waving his hands, 
pretending to be telling his teammates that they were lined up in the wrong 
place. While he was doing this, the center snapped the ball to Foley. Then 
Foley tried to pass it, unsuccessfully. 
</P>
<P>
It was really, really funny. Funniest play since Cal outran the Stanford band. 
</P>
<P>
Well, this is sure the season for it. USC, with its powerhouse team and its 
cracker-jack quarterback and its proud tradition, is about one defeat away from 
the John Hancock Bowl. Its chances of appearing on anybody's TV on New Year's 
Day are up there with Charles Keating's chances of being grand marshal in 
Anaheim's Freedom Bowl parade. Not too hot. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans are not as good as we thought they would be -- but who is? They're 
no better or worse than most anybody else this season. They could defeat Notre 
Dame, but Oregon State should worry them. They should take nothing and no one 
for granted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sign of today's college football," Smith said. "There's not one 
dominant team." 
</P>
<P>
Truer words were never spoken. Virginia could be No. 1 next week in all three 
polls -- AP, UPI, Bottom Ten. 
</P>
<P>
Really. It could happen.

FRESHMAN HAS BIG DAY FOR WASHINGTON STATE

<P>
Freshman quarterback Drew Bledsoe passed for 188 yards and three touchdowns 
Saturday in his first collegiate start to lead Washington State past Oregon 
State, 55-24, in a Pacific 10 game. 
</P>
<P>
Washington State (3-5 overall, 2-2 in Pac-10) overwhelmed the Beavers (1-6, 
1-2). After a punt on their first possession, the Cougars scored six straight 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Prior's 99-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the first quarter was 
the second-longest kickoff return in Washington State history. Bernard Jackson 
returned a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown for the Cougars against UCLA in 
1971. 
</P>
<P>
Despite coming off an upset of then-No. 21 Arizona, Oregon State could get 
little to go right against the Cougars. In a five-minute stretch in the second 
quarter, the Beavers lined up offsides to receive a kickoff, had a punt blocked 
and fumbled away the ball on a kickoff return. 
</P>
<P>
Beaver quarterback Fred Schweer had a pass for a two-point conversion picked 
off and returned 100 yards by linebacker Curt Newton. Under a rule adopted last 
year, Newton's return counted for two points. 
</P>
<P>
Bledsoe threw touchdown passes of 39, nine and 34 yards and ran 11 yards for 
another touchdown. He completed 10 of 20 passes before leaving in the fourth 
quarter. He was not intercepted or sacked. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars' Phillip Bobo caught two passes for 73 yards. Both went for 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Washington State scored first on a 49-yard run by running back Rich Swinton. 
Bledsoe made it 14-0 on a 39-yard pass to Bobo. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State's James Jones scored the first of his two touchdowns on a 17-yard 
run, but kicker Jamie Burke missed the extra point to make it 14-6. Prior ran 
the ensuing kickoff back for a touchdown and holder Jody Sears ran in on a fake 
for a two-point conversion to give the Cougars a 22-6 lead after one quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Bledsoe hit tight end Clarence Williams for nine yards and a touchdown to open 
the second half. Running back Shaumbe Wright-Fair ran eight yards for a 
touchdown and Bledsoe hit Bobo for 34 yards to make it 43-6. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Hanson made a 51-yard field goal with 29 seconds left in the first half 
to give Washington State a 46-6 lead. Hanson, the Pac-10 field goal leader, has 
12 field goals of 50 yards or more.

Jones scored his second touchdown on a 1-yard run in the third quarter. 
Schweer's pass for the two-point conversion failed.

<P>
Bledsoe made it 53-12 on his 11-yard run, then Oregon State's Dwayne Owens came 
back with a one-yard touchdown run. Newton made it 55-18 by picking off 
Schweer's pass on the conversion attempt.

Andre Waters of the Philadelphia Eagles was fined "a substantial amount," by 
the NFL for hitting Minnesota quarterback Rich Gannon below the knees after 
Gannon released a touchdown pass Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
League spokesman Greg Aiello said the fine was levied by Commissioner Paul 
Tagliabue after a review of tapes of Monday night's game, won, 32-24, by the 
Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
Aiello did not divulge the amount of the fine. It was believed, however, to be 
about $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Waters, Philadelphia's free safety, was blitzing on the play, a 78-yard 
touchdown pass to Cris Carter, and hit Gannon below the knees -- in violation 
of a rule enacted in 1989 after Waters did the same to Jim Everett of the Rams 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
There was no penalty called on Waters for hitting Gannon. 
</P>
<P>
Waters previously had been fined for late hits and also met with 
then-commissioner Pete Rozelle in April 1989 to discuss what some considered 
dirty play. Waters has maintained he plays within the rules.

WASHINGTON / CATHERINE COLLINS; 
</P>
<P>
FISHY DOINGS ON CAPITOL HILL MAY BE GOOD FOR CONSUMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE COLLINS, CATHERINE COLLINS is a Washington writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress is up to its gills in fish bills. And the fishing industry will soon 
get its first law requiring fish inspections. 
</P>
<P>
To date, fish is the only flesh food not subject to a comprehensive, mandatory 
federal inspection program. Yet the Food and Drug Administration estimates that 
about 64,230 illnesses and 22 deaths result each year from contaminated 
seafood. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has considered several bills in the past five years in the hopes that 
a better inspection process would provide better consumer protection and public 
health. How to accomplish that in these times of budget shortages is central to 
the debate. 
</P>
<P>
There are three main issues. The first is a question of turf -- which agency 
will run the program. The favored choices are the FDA, which operates the 
current program of random inspections, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
which runs the meat and poultry inspection programs. 
</P>
<P>
The second issue is a definition of "adulteration" or contamination and the 
public health standard that should apply to fish that contains contaminants for 
which there are no regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The third issue is whistle-blower protection. The meat and poultry industries, 
which have no whistle-blower protection, have lobbied hard against it for the 
fish industry too. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of its mandate to protect public health, it is more appropriate that 
the FDA have the fish inspection program," said Nancy Watzman, policy analyst 
at Public Citizen. "If the USDA, which has the mandate to promote agricultural 
products, were to get the fish inspection program it is possible that these two 
different mandates would conflict." 
</P>
<P>
But Lee J. Weddig, executive vice president of the National Fisheries 
Institute, likes the idea of the USDA controlling the program. "From an 
organization standpoint, the USDA just makes more sense," he said. "And the 
seafood industry is very international. The Department of Agriculture is 
already in place with all our largest trading partners." 
</P>
<P>
The Senate passed a bill (SB 2924), which was sponsored by the majority leader, 
Sen. George Mitchell (D-Me.) and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the 
Agriculture Committee. The Senate bill would make fish inspections part of the 
USDA program. 
</P>
<P>
The leading House bill, now a compromise effort between the Committee on 
Merchant Marine and Fisheries and a bill sponsored by Rep. John D. Dingell 
(D-Mich.), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, would leave the 
program with the FDA and has stronger language regarding contamination and 
whistle-blower protection. A vote is expected at any time. 
</P>
<P>
Although the fishing industry is split in its backing of the various 
legislation, there is support for regulation because it would provide a 
commercial advantage by bolstering public confidence in fish products -- the 
fastest-growing sector of the food industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration and a dozen consumer groups, including the AFL-CIO, 
Public Citizen and Consumers Union, oppose the Mitchell bill and support the 
compromise bill in the House for both public health and budget reasons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Bill Aims to Improve Children's TV 
</P>
<P>
"That's all folks." That's the message Congress is sending to the television 
broadcasting industry with the passage of the Children's Television Act, which 
became law last week without a signature from President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The bill (HR 1677), introduced by Rep. John Bryant (D-Tex.), limits advertising 
during children's programming to no more than 10.5 minutes per hour on weekends 
and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays. It also gives the Federal Communications 
Commission, when reviewing applications for license renewal, the authority to 
consider whether a station has served the educational needs of children. 
</P>
<P>
Action for Children's Television, a public interest group, has reported that 
some stations were airing as much as 12 minutes of ads an hour during weekends 
and 14 minutes an hour during weekday programming. 
</P>
<P>
"Programming for children should be designed to turn on their minds, not their 
sweet tooth or susceptibility for subtle advertising," Bryant said. "Requiring 
broadcasters to consider the educational needs of children serves the public 
interest." 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for a license, a television operator must agree to meet certain FCC 
standards for programming. If he fails to meet the standards, he can lose the 
license through a hearing process when it comes up for renewal. 
</P>
<P>
A bill similar to Bryant's passed Congress in late 1988, but President Reagan 
allowed it to die after Congress adjourned. President Bush did not sign the new 
bill; his Administration did not support it either. However, the current bill 
had overwhelming bipartisan support and ACT, the Parent-Teacher Assn. and many 
education and religious organizations lobbied hard for it. 
</P>

<P>
Local Bar Sorts Out Pension Law Mess 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Bar Assn. appears to have succeeded where so many others 
have failed. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers' group has sorted through the bewildering legalities governing the 
distribution and taxation of pensions and issued a report proposing a 
simplified version of the current rules. 
</P>
<P>
The report describes the present law as "unduly complex, illogical as a matter 
of policy." It suggests replacing the current labyrinth with two simple rules: 
everything that comes out of a pension plan is taxable, and everything that 
comes out can be rolled over into an IRA. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have amended the law so that an individual can avoid paying tax by 
rolling over his investment, there is no policy reason to have very complex tax 
breaks that you now have," said David E. Gordon, co-author of the report and a 
partner at the law firm O'Melveny &amp; Myers. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.) has used the report as the basis for some portions of 
reform legislation (SB 2901) that has been co-sponsored by 10 of his colleagues 
on the Senate Finance Committee. Pryor's bill, however, preserves some of the 
old special rules, such as those regarding taxation of employee stock option 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very supportive, although the bill certainly includes some things we 
don't like," said James A. Klein, deputy executive director of the Assn. of 
Private Pension and Welfare Plans. "But the idea of reorienting Congress toward 
simpler pension laws is very important." 
</P>
<P>
While the bar association has not taken a stand on the other elements of 
Pryor's bill, Gordon said that on the whole it is a step in the right 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
"The end result of complexity is only noncompliance," Gordon said. "This should 
be an area in which an IRS pamphlet can say it all."

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / A. GARY SHILLING; 
</P>
<P>
BLINDED BY THEIR TRAINING, ECONOMISTS MISS THE ABYSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. GARY SHILLING, A. GARY SHILLING is a New York-based economic consultant 
and author of After the Crash: Recession or Depression?, published by Lakeview 
Economic Services. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most economic forecasters finally believe that the U.S. economy is recession 
prone. With the nose-dives in stock prices and economic confidence flowing from 
the Persian Gulf crisis, the scales fell from many eyes. Better late than 
never, right? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps. But for many purposes, the usefulness of a recession forecast made 
after the stock market has fallen sharply is limited. And, in any event, almost 
no one yet agrees with me that the business slump will be deep and global. 
</P>
<P>
Why are economists so reluctant to face the reality of big economic trouble? 
Maybe it's because they're looking at the wrong statistics. Economists are 
trained to study the economy's income statement as shown in the gross national 
product accounts, which show where consumers, business, government, and 
foreigners spend their money, and the wages, profits, interest, rent and taxes 
that generate funding for these expenditures. Those accounts are well 
documented with reams and reams of data, and forecasters swarm around data like 
bees around their queen. 
</P>
<P>
From their beehive perspective looking at this income statement, economists see 
no major imbalances that could unwind into a deep recession. The 
inventory-to-sales ratio remains low and consumer spending growth has been 
moderate recently. They'll point to plant and equipment spending as another 
income statement component that shows that few excesses exist. Indeed, the only 
time when capital spending was strong in this expansion was early in the 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
And everyone will agree with them that construction in general, and housing 
activity in particular, is a long way from being out of hand and able to pull 
down the economy by slumping sharply. A mild recession is possible because of 
the Iraqi invasion, these economists will tell you, but there will be no 
serious -- much less global -- decline. 
</P>
<P>
But the problems that can turn a modest business dip into a disaster aren't 
reflected in the nation's income statements, but in its balance sheets. That's 
where all the under-collateralized debts lie, but lack of data and training 
keeps the average economist from looking there. 
</P>
<P>
I believe the Iraqi invasion merely put the final nail in the coffin of the 
expansion, which had already died from the effects of high interest rates and 
an ongoing credit crunch. The Persian Gulf crisis added more weakness by 
creating immense uncertainty, causing consumers and business here and abroad to 
hold back on spending. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the related surge in oil prices reduces purchasing power of the 
United States and other oil-importing countries. And unlike the 1970s, when oil 
exporters spent their increased revenue like drunken sailors and Third World 
countries borrowed to offset increased imported oil costs, today most 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries members and oil-importing Third 
World countries have huge debts. The OPEC nations must use their enhanced 
revenue to service oversized debts in most cases. 
</P>
<P>
With the business slump under way and likely to intensify, excessive debt 
problems here and abroad are boiling and could explode as recessionary fires 
heat up. Never in the history of consumer self-indulgence have so many borrowed 
so much in such a reckless way. Now, recession-caused layoffs are depriving 
consumers of the income needed to service their crushing debt loads. 
</P>
<P>
But with layoffs mounting, the squeeze is on. Already many are desperately 
turning to credit card borrowing to stay afloat. The growing concern over 
credit card delinquencies is only a sample of the problems that banks and other 
consumer lenders will face if the unemployment rate climbs to double digits, as 
well it might. 
</P>
<P>
The downturn is also drying up corporate cash flow, squeezing debt-heavy 
leveraged buyouts and slashing corporations' ability to service their gigantic 
junk bond issues. Investors are well aware of the risks, and junk bond prices 
have collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
As stocks, bonds, real estate and markets for other assets fall, liquidity is 
shrinking faster, doing away with funding for real estate. This reinforces the 
pressure on real estate prices that are already very weak in the commercial 
area and rapidly becoming so in residential properties. That's much to the 
detriment of S&amp;Ls that haven't already been sunk by bad loans, and banks. 
As a result, funding for real estate is disappearing, only adding to the 
pressure on lenders from regulators to become experts at saying "No!" to 
requests for almost any loans. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, the stock holdings of Japanese banks have collapsed 
along with their stock market. That has turned those institutions from lenders 
to borrowers as they seek to not only restore their capital but also increase 
it in line with the new international bank capital standards. In the process, 
some American banks are being crowded out of the capital market, and the 
possibility that more than one major bank here or abroad will fail is no longer 
remote. 
</P>
<P>
The recession is already spreading, with weakness in Canada and Great Britain. 
In Europe, the surge in economic activity appears to be over and weakness may 
follow, especially as softness elsewhere spreads to the Continent. High 
interest rates, the collapsing stock market and highly vulnerable real estate 
will probably push the Japanese economy into decline before long. 
</P>
<P>
A global recession will dramatically reduce demand for exports from Third World 
countries and eliminate what little ability they now have to service their 
debts. This includes oil exporters because, as usual, they will probably fail 
to cut production as fast as demand falls in a worldwide recession, leading to 
a nose-dive in oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
We will no doubt see further debt crises met with S&amp;L-style bailouts as 
governments and central banks labor to preserve the financial system. But will 
confidence be preserved? If consumers, business and investors see Argentina and 
Brazil default just as several familiar LBOs bite the dust and the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp. runs out of money, will they assume that bailouts will 
prevent the cancer from spreading? Or will they lose all confidence and 
generate a much deeper recession -- or even worse -- as these problems compound 
and as the falling economy, Mideast military expenditures and bailout costs 
push the true federal deficit toward $500 billion with frightening speed? 
</P>
<P>
I don't know how deep the recession will be because we haven't been here 
before. Widespread financial crises aren't new -- the last was in the early 
1930s -- but this is the first since government bailouts came into style and 
there's no way of knowing whether confidence can be preserved. I do know, 
however, that the risks are on the downside, and extreme caution is in order.

A DOGGED INVENTOR MAKES THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY SAY: HELLO, MR. CHIP; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: IN 1968 GILBERT HYATT APPARENTLY INVENTED THE COMPUTER ON A CHIP. 
ARMED WITH A PATENT AT LAST, HE AIMS FOR ROYALTIES -- AND RECOGNITION.

<P>
In 1968, much of the world was in turmoil. Thousands died in the Tet offensive 
in Vietnam. Russian tanks rumbled into Czechoslovakia. Robert F. Kennedy and 
Martin Luther King Jr. fell to assassins' bullets. Police clashed with 
demonstrators in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
But Gilbert P. Hyatt distanced himself from the turbulence. The 30-year-old 
electrical engineer was absorbed with another matter: Designing a computer to 
fit on a silicon microchip no bigger than a fingernail. 
</P>
<P>
Risking his family's savings and security, Hyatt quit his well-paying job as a 
research scientist at Teledyne Inc. and retreated to his Northridge home. In 
the family room, alone, seven days a week, he tinkered with homemade 
electronics hardware. 
</P>
<P>
An idea emerged. And though the design was never specifically used to produce a 
chip that powered an electronic gadget, Hyatt is now asking the world to 
recognize him two decades later as the inventor who made the computer 
revolution possible. 
</P>
<P>
In July, after a 20-year legal fight that generated an estimated 10,000 pages 
of paperwork, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office gave Hyatt patent No. 
4,942,516 for a "Single Chip Integrated Circuit Computer Architecture." The 
patent shocked the electronics world. 
</P>
<P>
If it withstands legal challenges, it could establish Hyatt as the father of 
the "computer on a chip," or microprocessor, the technology that spawned modern 
wonders of electronics from pocket calculators to microwave ovens. It could 
also earn him millions of dollars a year in royalties. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't invent the computer, but I came up with a very good improvement," 
said Hyatt, a 52-year-old workaholic who prefers to work alone at a modest home 
in a cul-de-sac in La Palma. "My work in those days led to the PCs of today." 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the viewpoint, Hyatt is either an underdog who battled greedy 
investors to keep control of his technology, or a frustrated scientist who 
couldn't bring his ideas to fruition in the marketplace and so exploited the 
patent system instead. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who begrudge Hyatt a place in history are former Intel Corp. 
researchers Marcian E. (Ted) Hoff and Federico Faggin, who along with engineer 
Stan Mazor are credited with inventing the first commercial microprocessor 
between 1969 and 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Another inventor, Gary W. Boone, an ex-Texas Instruments engineer, also has 
been given recognition because he was awarded the first microprocessor patent 
in 1973 -- three years after Hyatt filed for his patent. 
</P>
<P>
But Hyatt contends that he is the true inventor of the microprocessor and the 
technology "leaked out" to the industry through investors. He also says that 
patents awarded to Intel and TI cover only limited microprocessor improvements 
that were product specific. 
</P>
<P>
"The patent office did a very thorough job before they issued the patent," he 
said. "That is why it took 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
The competitive atmosphere in the microelectronics industry in the 1960s was 
similar to the race between the United States and the Soviet Union to send a 
manned spacecraft to the moon. Electronics companies were going all out to 
build chips with consumer uses. 
</P>
<P>
The semiconductor chip had been invented a decade earlier by engineers Jack S. 
Kilby at TI in Dallas and Robert N. Noyce, then at Fairchild Semiconductor in 
Silicon Valley. With the chip, the components of a complete electronic circuit 
were built on a single slice of silicon. 
</P>
<P>
Still, computers built from the chips stood several feet high, mainly because 
of the huge core memory they held on reels of magnetic tape. They could control 
missiles, but were too big for consumer goods such as watches. Something 
smaller was needed. 
</P>
<P>
Like the technology, the electronics industry itself was in flux. Noyce and 
Gordon E. Moore left Fairchild to form Intel in July, 1968. Other researchers 
left companies such as TI or Motorola Inc. to be entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt also decided in 1968 to form his own company, but he followed a different 
path. He avoided the professional circles of researchers in the emerging 
Silicon Valley in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"They all knew each other, but they didn't know me," he said. "It was essential 
I get away from them and do my own original thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Those who knew him at the time describe Hyatt as slender, mild-mannered and a 
bit naive for his age. He could be impatient with people who didn't understand 
his ideas. The son of a civil engineer, Hyatt knew from an early age that he 
wanted to be an engineer. 
</P>
<P>
After undergraduate study at UC Berkeley and graduate work at the University of 
Southern California, Hyatt took a job as a research scientist at Teledyne in 
1966. But his ambitions lay elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for a computer on a chip evolved over many months after Hyatt began 
tinkering with designs in his spare time in 1967. He quit his job at Teledyne 
in early 1968 to devote himself to the project. 
</P>
<P>
Using technology mostly available on the market, Hyatt believes he was the 
first to put all the pieces together with a design for a small single-chip 
computer that bucked the industry trend of building ever-bigger computers with 
high-capacity memories. 
</P>
<P>
"All products are built on technologies of the past," he said. "Only God can 
create from nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt decided computers could perform relatively simple tasks with far less 
memory than the room-sized models needed. He chose a compact component known as 
read-only memory, which could be programmed once with the basic instructions 
telling the computer what calculations to make. It would work with another 
memory component called an alterable scratch-pad memory, which could store the 
data that was subject to change with each computation. Both were small enough 
to fit on a chip. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1968, Hyatt trademarked the term "Micro Computer" for the invention. 
In November, he created a working "breadboard," or an oversized prototype that 
demonstrated the chip's circuitry. 
</P>
<P>
John Salzer, a Santa Monica management consultant, recalled that he was so 
impressed with Hyatt's chip design that he invested $5,000 in the company. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1969, attorney Stuart Lubitz agreed to find more investors for Hyatt 
and filed incorporation papers for Micro Computer Inc. a month later. 
</P>
<P>
Irving Hirsch, a friend and veteran manager of several small technology firms, 
joined Hyatt as a partner and invested $60,000 in Micro Computer. Hirsch became 
president of the company, which moved to an office in Reseda and began hiring 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Hyatt was a very hard worker and one of the most brilliant guys I've run 
into," said Hirsch, 68, now owner of a lighting distribution firm in Inglewood. 
"We operated seven days and nights and he was there constantly. We used to work 
at my house in Woodland Hills and take walks at 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. and talk about 
the technology." 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch and Hyatt knew the firm would need about $1.5 million, so they asked 
Lubitz to search for more investors. Lubitz rounded up a group that included 
Intel founders Noyce and Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Other investors included Hale Bros. in San Francisco and the San Francisco 
investment firm of Hambrecht &amp; Quist. 
</P>
<P>
Lubitz served on the board of directors, as did Hirsch, Hyatt, Joseph Chulick 
Jr. of Hambrecht &amp; Quist, and a Hale representative. 
</P>
<P>
With the venture capital backing, the company moved to Van Nuys in 1970, hiring 
25 workers. 
</P>
<P>
But a battle was brewing. Hyatt filed a patent application for the computer on 
a chip on Dec. 28, 1970. Working through Lubitz, the investors tried to 
persuade Hyatt to give up rights to the technology if the company closed or was 
sold, Hyatt and Hirsch recalled. 
</P>
<P>
On July 17, 1971, the investors staged a showdown at a board meeting, Hyatt 
said. He said Lubitz and Chulick tried to badger him into giving up his rights 
to the technology. When he refused, the investors withheld their funding. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the investors decided the technology was too good for Hyatt," Hyatt 
said. "Their motive was to sell the company and take the technology." 
</P>
<P>
Lubitz, who later worked as a patent attorney for Intel and is now a Los 
Angeles patent attorney, said Hyatt was a stubborn, impractical researcher 
without a viable technology who was obsessed with "paper rights." He believes 
Hyatt's patent has stolen credit from Intel. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a question of whether investors wanted the patents developed with 
company funds to be assigned to the company," he said. "Mr. Hyatt refused, and 
that was the end of it. There was never any mention of a computer on a chip." 
</P>
<P>
The firm went out of business in September, 1971. Hyatt contends that the 
investors then leaked details of the chip to the industry, although he will not 
elaborate on the evidence to back up that claim. 
</P>
<P>
As Hyatt's dream was unraveling, his rivals were not sitting still. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1969 and 1971, Hoff, Faggin and Mazor at Intel developed a series of 
four chips that could be sold as a package, including the Intel 4004, a central 
processing unit on a single chip that before the Hyatt patent was known as the 
first microprocessor. 
</P>
<P>
TI's product hit the marketplace about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Intel and TI went on to become industry giants while Hyatt's Micro Computer 
produced only one prototype for one customer. 
</P>
<P>
"It was frustrating watching people exploit my technology and get rich while I 
was on the sidelines," Hyatt said. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to find other funding, Hyatt became an aerospace consultant and tinkered 
with his own inventions at home, eventually collecting more than 50 patents. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't give up on the patent quest. Hyatt and his attorney, Gregory L. 
Roth, knew that under patent law, they did not have to build a working 
microchip, but only prove it could be commercially built from the design. 
</P>
<P>
They had the benefit of the earliest filing date. But they still had to prove 
the case to patent examiners. Over the next 20 years, Hyatt and the examiners 
went through 16 different legal reviews. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1988, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington said Hyatt had not 
proven that any chip maker could have built a working chip based on Hyatt's 
patent application. However, the court broke a stalemate between Hyatt and the 
patent examiners by acknowledging that he had solved technological problems 
that eluded earlier designers. 
</P>
<P>
For the next two years, Hyatt built a case based on published industry 
literature that the technology had existed to create his chip in 1970. He found 
evidence that TI, Intel and other firms could have fabricated the chip if he 
had directed them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The patent examiner finally issued the patent on July 17. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Hecker, a Los Angeles patent attorney who examined the patent, said its 
claims are broad, apparently covering most microprocessors and other computers 
contained in a wide range of electronic products. 
</P>
<P>
Enforcing the patent could prove time-consuming and expensive. Hyatt has agreed 
to testify about his invention in a patent-infringement suit between Zenith 
Data Systems Inc. and TI, which is trying to enforce patents related to Boone's 
microprocessor work. 
</P>
<P>
Hoff and Faggin, the former Intel researchers, feel cheated by the Hyatt 
patent. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel we at Intel made a very small, very economical processor that was 
orders of magnitude cheaper than the minicomputers at the time," said Hoff, a 
legal consultant in Mountain View. "When you do that, that's when you really 
achieve a breakthrough." 
</P>
<P>
In rebuttal, Hyatt said his chip would have been marketable if only his 
investors had backed him. 
</P>
<P>
T.R. Reid, a Washington Post reporter and author of the 1984 book, "The Chip," 
said that historians may solve Hyatt's case with the same compromise that ended 
a 10-year dispute between Intel's Noyce and TI's Kilby over the invention of 
the chip in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
"Kilby got the idea first, but Noyce made it practical," Reid said. "The legal 
ruling finally favored Noyce, but they are considered co-inventors. The same 
could happen here."

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: YOUR BEST PROTECTION IS TO FIND A STRONG INSURER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mounting woes among the nation's life insurers have triggered concerns about 
whether the industry might become the next big financial crisis. The industry 
insists that it will avoid a debacle on the scale of the savings and loan mess, 
but it's nonetheless prudent that you check the financial strength of your 
insurer before investing. 
</P>
<P>
The problem in a nutshell is that many insurers -- seeking to offer high 
returns in their insurance, annuity and other products -- invested during the 
1980s in riskier assets, including commercial real estate and high-yield junk 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, there is a "significant risk" that a severe economic downturn or 
decline in major investment markets could result in the insolvency of one-fifth 
of the nation's major life insurers, according to a recent report by IDS 
Financial Services, a unit of American Express, which owns a life insurance 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of troubles are mounting. Failures of life insurers -- mostly smaller 
firms -- are increasing, and industry-administered guaranty funds have been 
paying out enormous amounts to policyholders and others in insolvent firms. 
Some experts fear that a collapse of one giant insurer could trigger a domino 
effect among others. 
</P>
<P>
What does this mean to you as a current or potential policyholder? 
</P>
<P>
No one knows for sure what could happen because a big insurer has never 
collapsed. But if insurers become insolvent or go under, you or your 
beneficiaries could lose your death benefits, annuity payments or cash buildup 
in your policies. Or, more likely, you or your beneficiaries may be forced to 
wait months or years before getting that money, says Glenn S. Daily, an 
independent insurance consultant in New York. Holders of annuities in 
now-defunct Baldwin-United, for example, had to wait years before getting their 
money. 
</P>
<P>
California recently joined a number of states with laws creating so-called 
guaranty funds designed to protect policyholders in cases of insolvency. That 
would be similar to how the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. protects savers in 
the event of bank or S&amp;L failures. 
</P>
<P>
California's fund (which is actually called a guaranty association) will become 
effective next January and will protect eligible consumers for up to $250,000 
in death benefits and $100,000 in cash value, says Mark Rakich, legislative 
counsel for the state Department of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
But California's program is more restrictive than those of many other states, 
limiting even further how much it will actually cover, Rakich notes. 
</P>
<P>
California's plan and other programs carry many other limitations as well, says 
Joseph M. Belth, professor of insurance at Indiana University and a leading 
expert on life insurers. For example, they generally provide only for the 
collection of assessments from insurance companies after an insolvency, Belth 
says. Also, they may not pay residents outside their states, so that if you 
hold a policy from an out-of-state insurer that fails, you may not get 
anything. And they don't have federal backing like the FDIC. 
</P>
<P>
"The real question is what would happen if there's an insolvency of a major 
company," Belth says. "If that happens, it's not clear if the arrangements 
would work. It's possible that the assessments would be so large as to bring 
down other companies." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the best protection is to make sure you do business with financially 
strong insurers. 
</P>
<P>
The simplest way to do that is by checking the ratings of insurers by the four 
major rating agencies: A. M. Best, Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's Investors 
Service and Duff &amp; Phelps. 
</P>
<P>
Many major public libraries carry A. M. Best's guide, "Best's Insurance 
Reports, Life-Health Edition," containing its ratings and reports on insurance 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from the other rating agencies also may be available at libraries with 
extensive business-reference collections (you could get them directly from the 
rating agencies, but that tends to be expensive and is not generally advisable 
for the average consumer). You may have better luck getting this information 
from your insurance agent. 
</P>
<P>
But ratings are not foolproof. And it's also possible that your policy may have 
been transferred to another insurer, so that your original due diligence has 
become moot. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, experts say, it's still worth checking the ratings. If you are 
most conservative, stick with only those insurers with the top ratings. For A. 
M. Best, the top rating is A+; at Standard &amp; Poor's, it's AAA; Moody's, 
Aaa, and Duff &amp; Phelps, AAA. 
</P>
<P>
Belth notes that about 270 life insurers enjoy Best's A+ rating. About 190 have 
carried the A+ rating for 10 straight years, he says. To get a list of those, 
plus other information on insurance ratings, send $10 to Insurance Forum, P.O. 
Box 245, Ellettsville, Ind. 47429. Ask for the September, 1990, issue of 
Insurance Forum. 
</P>
<P>
What if you already have a policy with a firm with financial woes? That has 
been the dilemma facing policyholders of Executive Life Insurance Co., the life 
insurance unit of Los Angeles-based First Executive Corp. News about the firm's 
ailing junk bond portfolio have caused many customers to terminate their 
policies, incurring surrender charges in the process. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a term life policy (one that provides for only a death benefit, 
without a savings or cash-value component), you can switch to another insurer 
when it's time to renew the policy after you've had it for a year. 
</P>
<P>
But the decision is tougher if you have a cash-value policy, annuity or other 
long-term product. Then the decision can depend on a number of factors, 
including the financial strength of the insurer, the surrender charges and your 
state of health. Replacing the policy might be in order if the cost of new 
insurance will be lower than your current policy and you can make the switch 
easily and cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
Because the decision can be difficult, Belth suggests consulting with a trusted 
and knowledgeable insurance adviser (not necessarily your agent).

GARDEN Q&amp;A: POTTED HEATHER PLANT CAN BE PLANTED OUTSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mary Ellen Guffey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: For Valentine's Day I bought at the supermarket a flowering potted 
plant called Scotch Heather. All the tiny pink bell-like flowers have fallen 
off, but the foliage still looks good. 
</P>
<P>
Should I toss this plant out or is it worth saving? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: By all means, save it and plant it outside -- if you have the space. 
This is Erica canaliculata, one of the best winter-flowering shrubs for 
Southland gardens. It becomes a bushy six-foot specimen but can be kept lower 
with pruning. As a cut flower, its branches will last for weeks -- in water or 
out. 
</P>

<P>
Argument Settled on Bougainvillea Flowers 
</P>
<P>
Q: My friend and I are having a little argument about his bougainvillea. I say 
the flowers are tiny and white, and he says they are obviously big and red. 
Who's right? 
</P>
<P>
A: You are. The true flowers of bougainvillea are inconspicuous and white. The 
showy part comes from three papery bracts, which are modified leaves. Other 
plants with showy bracts that look like flowers are poinsettia and flowering 
dogwood. Mary Ellen Guffey

GARDEN Q&amp;A: AVOCADO LEAF TIPS TURN BROWN FROM SALT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Sidnam 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: Why do the tips of the leaves on my avocado tree turn brown? 
</P>
<P>
A: This is probably caused by a buildup of salts in the soil due to frequent 
light waterings. 
</P>
<P>
Give the tree an occasional heavy, deep irrigation to leach the salts from the 
soil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fruit Drop Healthy for Orange Crop 
</P>
<P>
Q: Each year in late spring my Valencia orange tree drops a lot of its new 
fruit when the fruit is marble-sized. What causes this? How do I prevent it? 
</P>
<P>
A: This condition is known as "June drop" and is a common occurrence with most 
citrus trees. It is thought to be caused by a sudden temperature rise in the 
spring while the soil is still cold. 
</P>
<P>
When the foliage heats up, the cold roots are not able to quickly supply water 
and nutrients to the rest of the tree -- consequently it drops some of its 
fruit. 
</P>
<P>
There is no reason to try to prevent this; it is beneficial as it improves the 
size of the remaining fruit. If all the original fruit were allowed to remain, 
it would be golf ball-sized when mature. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Woody Jicima Tubers Harvested Too Large 
</P>
<P>
Q: Last year I grew jicima for the first time. The tubers grew quite large, but 
they had a woody texture. Should I have watered it more? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Once established, jicama is not a thirsty vegetable and can get along on 
less water than most vegetables. The problem was that the tubers were allowed 
to grow too large. They should be harvested when they are about four inches in 
diameter. Bill Sidnam

HANDYMAN Q&amp;A: SOAP AND SANDING HELP PAINT STICK TO CONCRETE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Popular Mechanics 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: How can I get paint to stick to the high-traffic areas on our 
concrete front porch? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Epoxy, polyurethane and acrylic paints wear much better than oil and 
alkyd paints on concrete. Before applying a water-resistant paint, clean and 
roughen the surface. Use a trisodium phosphate solution or strong detergent to 
scrub the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Sanding with coarse emery paper may be required to give the old surface a rough 
texture for good paint bonding. Test-paint a small area to make sure the new 
paint will adhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Check Out Plywood Before Reroofing 
</P>
<P>
Q: My 25-year-old house needs reroofing and I plan to do the job myself. I 
would like to lay new shingles over the old ones. However, the builder 
apparently skimped on the roof sheathing. Instead of the usual one-half-inch 
thick exterior grade plywood, he used three-eighth-inch sheets. Also, he nailed 
the shingles directly to the sheathing without putting down a layer of building 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
Can I add a second layer of shingles? Or would this be too heavy for the 
three-eighth-inch plywood, considering there can be a foot of snow on the roof 
in the winter? 
</P>
<P>
A: The builder didn't necessarily skimp on the roof sheathing. The required 
thickness depends on the rafter spacing, the grade of the plywood and the 
direction of its face grain. 
</P>
<P>
Look for the APA stamp of the American Plywood Assn. on the exposed underside 
of the plywood for the identification index. The index contains two numbers 
such as 20-0 or 32-16. 
</P>
<P>
The left-hand number represents the maximum recommended spacing in inches 
between rafters when the face grain of the panel runs at right angles to the 
rafters. If the rafter spacing is not greater than 24 inches, your sheathing is 
adequate. 
</P>
<P>
It would be sensible to check with your local building department about a 
second layer. If your town allows only one layer, you'll have to tear off the 
existing shingles. 
</P>
<P>
The builder did skimp on building paper. The paper serves as a backup water 
barrier between the shingles and the sheathing if shingles are lifted, damaged 
or torn off by winds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Antifreeze Can Prevent Damage to Water Pipes 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a second home in Upstate New York and plan to put in an oil-fired 
central heating system for my water. I am not there all the time, the water 
pipes are drained and the traps filled with antifreeze. So, I was wondering if 
I could protect the water-heating pipes by using the proper mixture of nontoxic 
antifreeze and water. Can you think of any problems that may occur? 
</P>
<P>
A: There are a few things you should do before adding antifreeze to the house's 
plumbing system. First, if the house doesn't have one already, add a back-flow 
preventer on the water feed line. This prevents the antifreeze from 
contaminating the house's potable water supply. 
</P>
<P>
Next, determine how much antifreeze to add to the system. To do this, estimate 
the volume of water in the house's pipes and then add the correct ratio of 
antifreeze. 
</P>
<P>

CRITIQUING MOVIE CRITICS -- WHY SOME WATCHDOGS BECOME BLIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, Kenneth Turan has been the film critic for California 
Magazine, Gentlemen's Quarterly and National Public Radio's All Things 
Considered. He is currently interim book editor of The Times and a columnist 
for Buzz magazine.

<TEXT>
<P>
As soon / Seek roses in December, ice in June; / Hope constancy in wind, or 
corn in chaff; / Believe a woman or an epitaph, Or any other thing that's 
false, before / You trust in critics. -- Lord Byron, 1809 
</P>
<P>
Critics should be like Maimonides, a guide for the perplexed. Critics should be 
like the Shadow, a white knight intimately familiar with the evils that lie in 
the hearts of men. Critics should be like Robespierre, "the incorruptible," a 
first line of defense for their readers against the barrage of 
multimillion-dollar advertising and publicity campaigns with which studios 
regularly bombard civilians. Critics should be a lot of things, most of which 
they're not. 
</P>
<P>
While critic-bashing tends to be a popular sport of practically Olympian 
proportions, the irony is that of the three groups affected by film reviewers 
-- the talent, the studios and the public -- it's the first two who invariably 
grumble the most but in reality have the least grounds for complaint. For 
neither performers nor studios are the critics' intended audience -- they are, 
in a sense, eavesdropping on a conversation between the critic and the public, 
and if they don't like what they're hearing, they shouldn't listen in. 
</P>
<P>
And simply by the nature of their work, the relations critics have with 
creative types are always going to be adversarial. Actors, directors, 
screenwriters, etc., react with understandable pain and anger when publicly 
taken to task: no one -- not even critics -- likes negative treatment and, as 
the daughter of a critic friend reminded her parent, "You're killing their 
babies!" 
</P>
<P>
As for studios, they tend to regard critics as unruly adjuncts of the marketing 
department, useful for filling up newspaper quote ads and out of line if they 
venture anything more. Studios would like to be able to depend upon critics to 
be reliable cheerleaders for films with good intentions, and executives with an 
eye on the fiscal risk any halfway serious film entails often can't understand 
why scribes don't form an orderly line behind any earnest effort, no matter how 
misguided or soporific. 
</P>
<P>
Critics and audiences, however, ought to be natural allies. They both want the 
same thing -- a film that doesn't waste your time and money, nor trash your 
intelligence -- 
</P>
<P>
and as consumers, not manufacturers, neither one should care if the actors or 
the studios take offense if they themselves feel like they've been swindled. 
</P>
<P>
However, it's not only the moviemakers who have been shortchanging audiences 
lately, it's the critics as well. Though in an ideal ivory-tower world, a 
critic's main task would simply be to articulate his/her most intimate response 
to the work in question, the reality is that most day-to-day deadline writing 
scribes have a more mundane reason for being that should not be ignored: to 
serve the public that makes their existence (not to mention their salaries) 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
That trust, unfortunately, is frequently betrayed, as dutiful readers are, more 
often than not, not getting the criticism they deserve and think they're paying 
for. Instead, critics often compromise their positions in ways in which their 
audience is not even dimly aware. I am by no means without guilt in this area 
-- no critic that I'm aware of is -- but I am going to cast the first stone 
anyway simply because, a la "Network," I'm tired of the situation and I'd 
rather not take it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Though those who blab about film on TV fall outside the scope of this piece -- 
it wouldn't be very sporting to attack so feeble a target, now would it? -- 
they are an essential starting point. The very fact that they exist and are 
tolerated, even welcomed, as critics by large numbers of people inevitably 
means that the standard for what is acceptable criticism has to be lower than 
almost ever before. Now, not even simple literacy is a hard-and-fast 
requirement, let alone anything more demanding, like coherence. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly enough, it's the very nature of the job, the ways it makes 
filmgoing different for the critic than for his audience, that begins to make 
it difficult for the professional filmgoer -- for that's what a critic really 
is -- to connect with any more or less normal readership. 
</P>
<P>
If you are at all conscientious, you begin your critical life, as you may have 
begun your personal film viewing life, by trying to absorb everything that's 
out there. As a friend put it, you approach your job with the psychological 
equivalent of a huge catcher's mitt, boasting, "Nothing gets by me." 
Unfortunately, what that mitt encompasses includes a surprising amount of stuff 
no one in their right mind would even think of looking at. All those movies 
whose ads you skim in the Sunday paper and say, "No way I'm seeing that one," 
the critic has suffered through. True, that's just part of the job, but 
experiencing all that detritus couldn't help but have deleterious effects: a 
junk-film diet makes movies that are so-so seem like masterpieces. 
</P>
<P>
Even more insidious in that regard is the feeling you get when you realize that 
way more than half of what you're viewing not only isn't any good, it isn't 
even worth your time. When that happens, you have two choices: you can get 
another job or you can unconsciously compromise your standards.Since I would be 
a pathetic fool to be wasting all my time watching trash, you say to yourself, 
it follows logically that what I'm watching must be worthwhile. Clear to you, 
kemosabe, but not necessarily to anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from having our brains enervated by processing more mush than the human 
mind was designed to handle, critics are prey to a whole range of professional 
personality disorders that remove us even further from the grail of rendering a 
beneficial uncompromised view of a film to an audience. Consider the following 
list of maladies: any one of them can enfeeble an ordinarily healthy critic, 
and a combination of several can render a practitioner useless for anything but 
collecting a paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
The Schmoozer. What could be more natural for critics, as lovers of film, than 
to want to hang out and take lunch with those who create what they love? 
Natural, yes, but crippling as well. Because human nature being what it is, 
friendship with creative types inevitably means that the reviewer won't be 
quite as demanding on his new friends' work the next time it has to be 
scrutinized. 
</P>
<P>
This doesn't mean you love a terrible film just because an acquaintance made 
it, but it does mean that you take a little off your fastball. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Easy. The hardest thing to do with a film is to approach it alone, on 
its own terms. Easier, and requiring a whole lot less thought, is the technique 
of latching onto an obvious handle and basing a review on that, the critical 
equivalent of judging a book by its cover. 
</P>
<P>
Did Jim Brooks start out on network TV? Then "Terms of Endearment" and/or 
"Broadcast News" must be "thinly disguised sitcoms." And if it had been 
suddenly announced that a regretable mistake in labeling had occurred and in 
fact Steven Spielberg had directed "The Last Emperor" and Bernardo Bertolucci 
"Empire of the Sun," you would have seen opinions flip-flop. 
</P>
<P>
The Idiot Idolaters. Like all good things, the consumer-oriented aspect of 
reviewing can be taken to a ridiculous extreme, and the Will Rogerses of 
reviewing, who rarely meet a film they don't like, are not doing anybody any 
favors. Though most critics will piously insist that getting quoted or 
"blurbed" in newspaper ads is the farthest thing from their lofty thoughts, a 
surprising amount tend to write in eminently blurbable prose. 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to experience many mirthless "laugh riots" or snore through 
films that putatively "pack a wallop" to understand how totally devalued and 
worthless to the public the nominal language of criticism has become. And 
calling every film that has a semblance of plot "a masterpiece" -- can anyone 
sincerely believe that Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket" is "the best war 
movie ever made," as one critic insisted? -- reflects more on the lack of 
background viewing of the writer than the quality of what is being written 
about. 
</P>
<P>
Revenge of the Nerds. Critics sometimes use reviews to pay off the most obscure 
of scores. Obviously angry at what they felt was the excessive praise given to 
"Less Than Zero," the novel, reviewers took it out on "Less Than Zero," the 
film. Chagrined at having helped create the monster that was "Gandhi," critics 
who had been blind to all of Sir Richard Attenborough's flaws when reviewing 
that film suddenly discovered each and every one of them when confronted with 
"Cry Freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Plot Junkies. Possibly weaned on a diet of Reader's Digest Condensed Books, 
these reviewers feel their job is done if they've managed to construct a 
plausible summary of what they've seen. Worse still is the breed that thinks 
nothing of blandly giving away every nuance of the most surprising story line 
to their justifiably outraged readers. After all, the more plot they reveal, 
the less writing -- and thinking -- they have to do themselves. 
</P>
<P>
I could go on -- another critical foible -- but at this point the question 
arises as to why anyone should put up with critics in the first place. We 
bother with them for the same reason we bother with the medium they criticize: 
When they are good, they are invaluable. 
</P>
<P>
In theory at least, a critic can do many things at once: Inform, entertain with 
lively writing, enlighten with hard-won insight, make us think about the film 
-- and by implication the society it reflects -- in ways we hadn't the 
wherewithal to see by ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
And even when we don't agree with them, adroit critics can guide us, not to 
bombastic star turns which speak well enough for themselves, but to 
experiences, like John Boorman's "Hope and Glory" or Gus Van Sant's "Drugstore 
Cowboy," that we might not have considered otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that critics can be unreliable nuisances, but, like democracy, they 
are better than the alternative. And remember, please, what one editor said 
when press excesses were being criticized during the Gary Hart imbroglio: If 
you want a good watchdog, you have to put up with a lot of barking. A hell of a 
lot of barking.

'MILLER'S CROSSING,' THE BROTHERS' THIRD FILM, SHOWS THEIR STEADY EVOLUTION AS 
TWO OF AMERICA'S MOST DISTINCTIVE FILMMAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
If she's such an angel, why are you lookin' for her at 4 in the morning? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gabriel Byrne to Albert Finney in "Miller's Crossing" 
</P>
<P>
How can we describe the Coen Brothers? Tongue-in-cheek devotees of American 
sociopathology? Film noirettes? The sons of Hammett and Chandler, branded by 
Cain? Or just two guys who like to make movies where the camera races around 
below knee level? 
</P>
<P>
Pigeon-hole them where you will, they're unique. In just three movies -- the 
1984 "Blood Simple," the 1987 "Raising Arizona" and the current "Miller's 
Crossing," the Coens, Joel and Ethan, have decisively staked out their own 
weirdo, psychically charged territory. They've been praised to the skies -- and 
also damned as cold-hearted copycats, derivative movie-brats, two more 
Reagan-era Raiders of the Lost Arts. 
</P>
<P>
There's something both impish and elusive about the Coens: Minnesota heirs of 
the flat, cold Midwestern interior which has inspired so many other slightly 
bent dreamers. They're wonderful mimics and pastiche artists. They've managed 
to catch the timber and tone of writers like James M. Cain, in "Blood Simple," 
and Dashiell Hammett, in "Miller's Crossing," with eerie accuracy. And in 
"Raising Arizona," they grace their suburban and low-life Southwestern rustics 
with a flowery phraseology that seems to mix equal parts of Restoration Drama, 
Gothic romance, redneck badinage and windy TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Like Preston Sturges, they throw strange rhythms and allusions into everyday 
speech: near-biblical phraseology ("Her womb was a rocky place where my seed 
could find no purchase" in "Raising Arizona") and ornate colloquies (M. Emmet 
Walsh's great oily wheezes of Texas cynicism in "Blood Simple"). "Miller's 
Crossing," their best script, finds them particularly inspired. The whole movie 
works out of several mixed rhythms, notably the gutter crackle of '30s Warners 
mob talk and the Irish lilt of two of the main characters: gang boss Leo 
O'Bannion (Albert Finney) and his alcoholic, sad-eyed lieutenant, Tommy Reagan 
(Gabriel Byrne). 
</P>
<P>
This slightly elevated dialogue often seems to clash with their visual style. 
"Miller's Crossing," despite its jarring violence, is relatively somber and 
restrained, but their first two movies were hyper-kinetic, flamboyant, full of 
garish action and eye-popping angles. In "Blood Simple," they use a lot of 
Hitchcockian voyeur shots; at one point they skim us down a loaded bar and hop 
over a glass. In "Raising Arizona," they race their camera frenetically down 
highways, supermarket aisles, through doghouses and, at one point, across a 
front yard, up a ladder and into a window. They sometimes favor dog's-eye or 
baby's-eye views with tracking shots that assume the flying ground-level 
perspective of the creeping spirits in Sam Raimi's "Evil Dead" -- which Joel 
helped edit. 
</P>
<P>
All of their movies are highly artificial, "movies" with quotation marks, and 
they're about characters that might verge on stock movie archetypes -- 
adulterers, detectives, cops, crooks -- but for their alarming eloquence. The 
Coens helped write "Crimewave" for Raimi, and though it's a labored and unfunny 
comedy, it lays out their usual strategy, a consciously comic or ironic 
perspective on dark, disturbing material: infidelity and murder in "Blood 
Simple," childlessness and road psychopathology in "Raising Arizona," and, in 
"Miller's Crossing," the Jacobean betrayals and murders of a Prohibition-era 
gangster community riven by "Titus Andronicus"-style blood feuds. 
</P>
<P>
The Coens have a consistent motif, almost a trademark: wild, almost mirthlessly 
aggressive bursts of laughter or "joy" -- Walsh's "Blood Simple" cackling, the 
bozo howling of escaped cons John Goodman and William Forsyth in "Raising 
Arizona." In "Miller's Crossing," the laughter has been largely replaced by a 
succession of cold, deadly, viciously meaningful smiles, behind which the 
speakers mercilessly calculate their interlocutor's weak spots. 
</P>
<P>
But indicting the Coens for artful heartlessness may be a bit premature -- 
especially for a near-masterpiece like "Miller's Crossing." As writers, the 
Coens are comic artists who like to work out of serious themes and low company; 
if they're sometimes damned for cold-blooded cynicism, it's worth remembering 
that most of their models once were as well. "Miller's Crossing" is a gangster 
movie which owes as much to literary inspirations as cinematic ones, and uses 
them with unusual wit, dramatic suppleness and emotional force. 
</P>
<P>
It's been praised, justly, for its visual coups: the burnished, shadowy-brown 
hues of Barry Sonnenfeld's cinematography, the wizardly production design by 
Dennis Gassner. And for its dramatic ones -- by Byrne, Finney and the whole 
superb cast. But, right now, its dialogue is what makes it special. The plot 
and milieu come largely from Hammett's novels, especially "The Glass Key" and 
"Red Harvest," but the racy lingo, stiletto-sharp, pungent and on-the-nose, 
also recalls Sturges or Ben Hecht. Scorsese's "GoodFellas" is deeper, denser 
and more virtuosic -- but "Miller's Crossing" is the 1990 crime movie with the 
richest, most startling characterizations, the most juicily quotable lines. 
</P>
<P>
Incongruous eloquence was the hallmark of many '30s and '40s crime movies, 
especially "The Maltese Falcon," where rumblingly orotund Sydney Greenstreet 
beamed at Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade and told him, "I'll tell you quite 
frankly, I'm a man who likes to talk to a man who likes to talk." The "Miller's 
Crossing" characters obviously like to talk and cross-talk. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most slightly flabby or over-profane modern pseudo-noir scripts, this 
one is easy and melodic, spiked with dozens of low-life bon mots that draw 
blood, in or out of context -- delivered by a cast of murderers, gamblers, 
alcoholics, whores, chiselers and corrupt politicians that seem possessed with 
bizarre eloquence. The Coens understand the secret of the best '30s hard-boiled 
dialogue: it's a language of stylized shop talk, lightly veiled aggression, 
dangerous euphemisms. Here, philosophical comedy seems to mix with Black Mask 
magazine pungency and street grit. 
</P>
<P>
The rhythms reverberate afterward -- not just the obvious zingers -- the 
cynical observation that a city boss has "more hair tonic than brains" or the 
shivery come-on, "The two of us, we're about bad enough to deserve each other," 
but the way the wisecracks extend into wit combats or explode into horrifying 
non-comic cadenzas. The movie's high point: John Turturro, gut-wrenchingly 
intense as weaselly little bookie Bernie Bernbaum, lurching awkwardly to the 
ground in a poetically gray forest before the man about to kill him, shrieking 
over and over, unforgettably: "I'm praying to you. Listen to your heart!" 
</P>
<P>
The tower of all this babbling, an unnamed "eastern" metropolis -- re-created 
in New Orleans, with a political structure that recalls Prohibition-era Chicago 
-- is loaded with diverse immigrant strains: the main characters include 
Italians, Jews and a "Dane." But the Irish lilt predominates: melodic, 
harsh-edged and melancholy. It's poetry on the edge of an abyss. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the best way to enjoy "Miller's Crossing" is simply to listen to it: not 
just to the ingenious turns of phrase, and the relish with which the cast 
delivers them; not just to the blend of mournfully pretty Celtic ballads and 
Jazz Age pop songs on the sound track, but to the whole, lyrically melded 
cacophony of talk, song and background noise. The cold crackle of ice cubes in 
a tumbler, the ship horns and hoof-clops, the cracking of tree-limbs in a windy 
forest where a grim quartet have come for an execution, Frank Patterson's 
soaring "Danny Boy" while Leo's Thompson machine gun routs two potential 
killers. The way the song "Running Wild" starts up at the climax of a lover's 
quarrel, or the way "Good Night, Sweetheart" suddenly stops when Leo delivers 
the kiss-off to Tommy. 
</P>
<P>
The Coens and sound editor Skip Lievsay meld everything into a world where 
dreamy re-creations become stark and immediate: where the sound is cranked up 
to a near-paranoid level, where the characters, in the midst of chaos, try 
staunchly but comically to preserve their cruel cool. In the great "Danny Boy" 
scene, the ecstatic refrain reflects Leo's sentimentality, but it also echoes 
his exaltation at the assertion of his old mastery, dealing fiery death to new 
challengers. The movie, for that wonderful, hair-raising few minutes, steps 
back from exposing Leo to admire him -- and then probably chuckles at itself 
for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
But what of the vision behind this virtuosity? "Miller's Crossing" is an 
entertainment, but, like Graham Greene's "entertainments," it's not empty of 
moral themes, psychology or social observation. It's a dark comedy set in hell, 
a fairy tale of utter moral chaos, of near absolute evil, in which the prime 
instigators of that evil -- the gangsters who run the city and keep mayor and 
police chief scuttling like flunkies between them -- spend their own time 
absurdly ruminating over ethical and moral consequences and strategies. 
</P>
<P>
In the first scene, obviously inspired by the opening of "The Godfather," the 
Coens pit Irish mob boss Leo against the local Italian mob leader: glowering 
plug ugly Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) who wants to "whack" Turturro's Bernie, a 
local bookie spilling information on fixed races or fights. Curiously, in the 
midst of Johnny's presentation, he launches into a discussion of ethics . . . 
or, in his words, "et'ics." Most writers would have tossed this incongruity off 
as a stray joke, but the Coens extend it, let it blossom. For Johnny, his 
nemesis' behavior is inexcusable. ("If you can't trust a fix, what can you 
trust?") The very structure and sanctity of crime itself has been sullied; 
murder is the only honorable response. "Et'ics" are an obsession of Johnny 
Caspar's, and also of the movie. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone involved, even the most cold-blooded killer, dourly macho Eddie 
"Dane," (J. D. Freeman) quarrels incessantly over morality, strategy and even 
decorum. If, at the beginning, Johnny seems an explosive psychopath, insanely 
sensitive to social slights, soon his obsessions with the moral boundaries of 
power become apparent -- in between wild temper tantrums when he orders 
killings or bashes in someone's head. It's a terrific comic premise, and also, 
undoubtedly, a sly comment on the non-criminal world outside, where equally 
abstract rationalizations and skewed observations often accompany the most 
cruel and self-serving behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The Coens -- who, in "Blood Simple" generated a chain of murderous 
double-crosses out of one infidelity and, in "Raising Arizona," constructed the 
plot around the intrusion of home life into the outlaw-road world -- here make 
sex the secret spur to all their machinations. Underneath the dark, stolid, 
heavily pillared world of "Miller's Crossing," there's a quagmire of tangled 
sexual relationships: two main triangles, one heterosexual (Leo, Tommy and 
Leo's "twist" Verna, who is also Bernie's sister), one homosexual (Bernie, the 
Dane and Steve Buscemi's Mink). At the center, the only uninvolved party in the 
roundelays, is family man Johnny Caspar: constantly extolling familial virtues 
and demonstrating fatuous pride in the achievements of his idiotic son. 
</P>
<P>
Identification is a mysterious process -- and, in "Miller's Crossing," we're 
asked to follow most of this through the eye and ear of a character, Tommy, 
whose motives are opaque to everyone else in the film -- even perhaps, himself. 
("I dunno. Do you always know why you do things, Leo?" he mutters.) As Tommy, 
Gabriel Byrne, looking charmingly like some dissipated younger cousin of 
Spencer Tracy, is incurably in the grip of three non-sexual compulsions: 
alcoholism, gambling and wisecracking. He's both omnipotent and helpless: 
adviser to two ganglords, yet unable to keep his creditor-bookies off his tail. 
</P>
<P>
But though, at times, Tommy seems to have embarked on a mysterious Yojimbo-like 
campaign of universal destruction, in one key shot, while he straightens his 
hat, we may see the answer in his eyes; see, if only faintly, the love for Leo, 
which he's masked or disavowed throughout. That hat is important: Tommy dreams 
about it, talks about it, consistently loses it -- whether in dreams, beatings 
or murder attempts. It's the key image of a movie where people are often 
identified by their headgear or hairstyle -- including a murder victim named 
"Rug," whose toupee is stolen. Perhaps the hat symbolizes the social facade 
that lightly covers the gangsters: so fragile, a smack can knock it off, or the 
wind blow it away. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, when Bernie pleads for his life from Tommy, howling that they're the 
same -- lovers and schemers, not killers -- he's telling a partial truth. But, 
in buying Bernie's plea, Tommy commits a perversion in his own special world: 
showing mercy to a man he knows has to be killed. The forest at Miller's 
crossing, shot in sepulchral hues that recall the woodland execution scene in 
Bertolucci's and Storaro's "The Conformist," is the site of a twisted moral 
reckoning, a dream, a crisis, two near-deaths and one real one. It's the squirt 
of blood and tears at the center of a machinery of murder. That, perhaps, is 
the darkest, most despairing theme in "Miller's Crossing." 
</P>
<P>
In this killer's world, love and pity are perversions. Love destroys you, saps 
you, makes you pull bonehead plays. Murder is good business -- as long as it's 
handled et'ically.

SETTING UP COMMERCIAL RADIO STATIONS, THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT DECREES ROCK IS 
POP -- AND THAT LEAVES THE ROCKERS OFF THE DIAL

LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rolling Stones and David Bowie were among the musicians who stepped in to 
help. Robert Plant and Phil Collins wrote a letter to The Times of London. More 
than 30,000 rock fans signed petitions. 
</P>
<P>
But British government officials, listening to the beat of a different drummer, 
swept aside their arguments in ruling on an issue that recently pushed the 
nation's music industry toward civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Mick Jagger be damned. Rock music and pop music, the British government has 
declared, are the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight years after the Beatles had their first hit record here, a legal 
definition of pop and rock finally has been devised. 
</P>
<P>
It seems silly at first, the notion of staid government officials contemplating 
the stylistic differences between R.E.M. and the New Kids on the Block. But the 
government's finding does not bode well for those who prefer the former to the 
latter. 
</P>
<P>
Causing all the fuss is a smidge of vague phrasing within the British 
government's new Broadcasting Bill, a sweeping piece of legislation set to 
become law in January. Among the changes called for under the bill is the 
creation of three nationwide commercial radio stations -- a significant 
development considering that there are none currently. The state-owned BBC 
operates five national non-commercial stations; all other radio stations serve 
local communities. 
</P>
<P>
Licenses to run the new stations -- two on AM and one on FM -- will be awarded 
next year to the highest bidders who meet the qualifications. But here's the 
tricky part: One of the stations, the Broadcasting Bill states, must be 
"speech-based" -- talk shows, that sort of thing. The second can contain any 
type of programming, as long as it's different than the other two. 
</P>
<P>
The third must broadcast music "other than pop." 
</P>
<P>
Exactly what constituted music "other than pop" was not spelled out, but it has 
been assumed that the government intended to give the FM franchise -- coveted 
because FM is more popular and offers better sound -- to a classical music 
station. Reinforcing the assumption was the fact that Arts Minister David 
Mellor has a habit of stating publicly that he would be interested in having 
more classical music on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Rock FM. 
</P>
<P>
A consortium of four media companies with interests that include rock concert 
promotion, music magazines and local radio broadcasting, Rock FM demanded the 
right to bid in the "other than pop" category. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockers introduced a smooth public relations campaign -- press releases, 
brochures -- to educate and sway government broadcasting authorities about the 
shadings of contemporary music. 
</P>
<P>
Pop, they said, is the music made by moonlighting soap opera stars and 
fly-by-night dance groups. Disposable singles for teeny-boppers. 
</P>
<P>
Rock, on the other hand, is album-based music that is enduring, both in style 
and in the artists who perform it. "Music for grown-ups," they called it. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Clapton, Roger Daltrey and Robert Plant -- the kinds of stars whose 
records might be played on just such a station -- lent their names to the 
cause. Thousands of fans signed petitions calling on the government to accept 
that rock is not the same as pop. 
</P>
<P>
To Americans, these goings-on might seem baffling. But then, so is British 
radio. Unlike the United States, there are no stations playing a steady diet of 
what is often called "album-oriented rock" -- the type made popular in the late 
'60s and early '70s. There is no existing format into which Bruce Springsteen 
records would fit. A new Peter Gabriel album would have trouble getting on the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
"Elton John, Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin -- their share of airplay is next to 
nothing," said Tim Schoonmaker, managing director for radio at EMAP, one of the 
four companies that make up Rock FM. "Britain's foremost cultural ambassadors 
are not represented on the radio here. We're saying the prodigal son should be 
allowed to return." 
</P>
<P>
It also seemed fairly clear that Rock FM would be extremely profitable. The 
station would likely earn $56 million its first year, says Schoonmaker. That 
would make it the second-highest-grossing station in the country, behind 
London's commercial Top 40 station, Capital Radio. 
</P>
<P>
Among the national radio stations operated by the BBC are the classical station 
Radio 3 and the "contemporary music" station, Radio 1. Contemporary, in this 
case, appears to mean that no music is played that was recorded prior to last 
week. Radio 1's playlist is derived from the British Top 40 charts, which are 
as notoriously fluid as the trendy musical styles that are played. Pop 
musicians heard on Radio 1 include Janet Jackson, the Pet Shop Boys and Kylie 
Minogue. If you're 16 and into Betty Boo and Adamski, it's nirvana. If you're 
35 and you want to hear Tom Petty or the Grateful Dead, forget it. 
</P>
<P>
There are alternatives to Radio 1, but none that aims for the niche targeted by 
Rock FM. Local radio stations in Britain playing contemporary music also favor 
Top 40. In London, pirate stations operating out of back bedrooms abound, 
filling local airwaves with reggae and hip hop. 
</P>
<P>
The quasi-governmental Radio Authority, headed by eminent septuagenarian Lord 
Chalfont, a former military man, was handed the task of sorting out the mess. 
Music-industry leaders offered their opinions, some in comments to the Radio 
Authority, others in public pronouncements. 
</P>
<P>
Those involved in classical music generally scoffed at the notion that rock and 
pop should have separate categories. Behind the scoffing, however, was the 
recognition that projected advertising revenues showed that a rock station 
would earn far more than a classical one, and would therefore be able to bid 
far more for the license. 
</P>
<P>
So if rock was defined as being music "other than pop," classical wouldn't 
stand a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Simon Mundy, director of the lobbying group National Campaign for the Arts, 
found it sad that the government had set up a system that pits musical factions 
against each other. While he, personally, supports the creation of a classical 
music station, he is sympathetic to those who want to hear album-oriented rock. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to say that rock music has nothing to say to a contemporary 
audience," said Mundy. And he concedes that "if you enjoy Led Zeppelin, you 
don't have much of a chance to hear it." 
</P>
<P>
But he also feels Britain needs a "middlebrow" classical music station that 
would be more accessible than the "high academic content" that scares away many 
would-be listeners from the BBC's Radio 3. 
</P>
<P>
Factory Records chief Tony Wilson, guru of the current Manchester-based dance 
music craze, is among those who disagreed with the rock separatists and 
pronounced rock and pop the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a difficult one to pin down," said Brent Hansen, executive producer of 
MTV Europe. "All of us have an idea in our heads until we try to rationalize 
it. I think rock can be pop." 
</P>
<P>
Over at the Radio Authority, Lord Chalfont and his colleagues realized what a 
sticky wicket they had on their hands. Scheduled to make a ruling at their 
mid-September meeting, they opted instead to seek expert advice and postpone a 
decision until late October. 
</P>
<P>
They consulted with executives at major record companies, with the British 
Phonograph Industry and with broadcasters in North America and Australia. The 
Radio Authority members also received a recommendation from their own staff, 
which sought to allow Rock FM to bid in the "other than pop" category if it 
agreed to severe restrictions on the number of Top 40 singles it played. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed rock's official recognition was just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
That's when the British government's Home Office -- the department responsible 
for the Broadcasting Bill -- suddenly announced it had come up with its own 
definition. 
</P>
<P>
Said the government: "Pop music includes rock music and other kinds of modern 
popular music which are characterized by a strong rhythmic element and a 
reliance on electrical amplification for their performance." 
</P>
<P>
There it was. Rock and pop were legally inseparable. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement took everyone -- including the Radio Authority -- by surprise. 
The Home Office declined to say how it arrived at its definition. Rock FM 
officials grumbled. 
</P>
<P>
Radio Authority members still have to decide on frequency allocations -- which 
programming formats will go on AM and which lucky one will go on stereo FM. It 
remains possible that the "other than pop" and "speech-based" categories will 
be assigned AM frequencies, which would allow Rock FM to bid in the "open" 
category for the FM station. 
</P>
<P>
But that is considered highly unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Rock FM can now persuade the government that the decades-old records of 
Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix and the Who are classical.

IN HIS NEW POST WITH PACIFIC SYMPHONY, CONDUCTOR CARL ST. CLAIR DRAWS FROM HIS 
YOUTH IN TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl St. Clair, the new music director of the Pacific Symphony, can drop some 
heavyweight names. 
</P>
<P>
New York Philharmonic music director Kurt Masur, Boston Symphony music director 
Seiji Ozawa -- these are people St. Clair says he can "pick up the phone at any 
time (and) have a question answered or talk with them about this or that." 
</P>
<P>
But there are other names he'll mention, nowhere near as familiar, that can 
tell you a lot more about this 38-year-old Texan. 
</P>
<P>
Take Robert S. Pool, for instance. Or Donn Laurence Mills. 
</P>
<P>
Who? 
</P>
<P>
Pool gave St. Clair a job in the governor's office when he was in college. 
</P>
<P>
"He hired me because I had blisters on my hands," St. Clair recalls. "He looked 
at my hands and said, 'What's wrong with your hands?' 
</P>
<P>
"I said I had blisters from building a fence, digging post holes and things 
like that. And he told me, 'That's why I hired you. Anybody who could work that 
hard and do this kind of labor certainly could work in the governor's 
correspondence room. . . .' 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Pool always helped me when I was a starving student at the University of 
Texas. He helped me, and all he ever asked was that when I had the opportunity, 
I would help somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
"And I remember that, and I try to live that because he lost nothing by helping 
me, but I gained everything. I always feel that if I can help other people, I 
only gain from that." 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Mills, chairman of the music department at Chapman College in 
Orange and founding director of the fledgling Capistrano Valley Symphony who 
died of meningitis in February. 
</P>
<P>
Mills had conducted the Texas All-State Orchestra in which St. Clair, then a 
17-year-old from the tiny farm community of Hocheim, Tex., played trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
It was not only the first orchestra St. Clair ever played in. "It was the first 
orchestra I ever heard," St. Clair told The Times in January, when he came to 
guest-conduct the Pacific as one of eight who were trying out for the music 
director's slot. 
</P>
<P>
"I often wanted to tell (Mills) how important that was to me," St. Clair said 
at the time. Last month he said he had been happy to learn that the remark got 
back to Mills before his death. St. Clair said he returns to conduct the 
All-State Orchestra "whenever they ask." 
</P>
<P>
He was the youngest of the eight announced candidates, and his appointment 
ended a search that began in February, 1988, when founding music director Keith 
Clark resigned after a bitter power struggle with the orchestra's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
Another candidate, Lawrence Foster, claimed to have been the front-runner and 
said the Pacific had offered him the job in December but withdrew the offer 
after talks broke down over salary, rehearsal demands and residency 
requirements. The orchestra management has refused to comment on Foster's 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair has declined comment on the Clark and Foster episodes. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair's guest-conducting stint began under particularly trying 
circumstances, as he faced last-minute changes in program and soloist. Only 
days before the concert, soprano Benita Valente was engaged to replace Jill 
Gomez, a British soprano who could not enter the country because she lacked a 
visa. (Gomez and her British agent later would fault the Pacific management for 
the problem. The management would blame her American agent and the heavy 
workload at the Los Angeles immigration office.) 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, St. Clair had to make some fast adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez was to have sung selections from Joseph Canteloube's "Songs of the 
Auvergne" and "Dove sono" from Mozart's "Le Nozze di Figaro." Instead, Valente 
chose to sing Mozart's "Exsultate, Jubilate" and three of Mahler's 
"Ruckert-Lieder" -- none of which St. Clair had prepared. 
</P>
<P>
There was yet another surprise waiting for him: St. Clair had expected to 
conduct the Overture to Mozart's "Die Zauberflote." But when he got on the 
podium to start the rehearsal, he found the score for "Figaro," the result of 
some apparent miscommunication between his agent and the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"Maestro," one of the musicians ventured hesitantly, "we have the 'Figaro' 
Overture. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair reportedly responded: "Even though I'm upset, that doesn't mean you 
can't call me Carl." 
</P>
<P>
Several musicians cite that response as part of what most impressed them about 
the candidate. As it turned out, St. Clair would conduct both the Overture and 
the Ruckert songs from memory. 
</P>
<P>
He continues to insist that the musicians call him by his first name. 
</P>
<P>
Louis G. Spisto, executive director of the orchestra, cites "two very keen 
ingredients" why St. Clair was picked as the new director. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, he's an incredibly talented musician," Spisto said. "In addition 
to that, he is a master at communication -- on the podium, at concerts and in 
the rehearsal periods. He can get our orchestra to do more than just about 
anyone we've ever seen . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He knows how to work with people and how to make everyone love working real 
hard. He's going to demand excellence, and he's going to get excellence." 
</P>
<P>
It was a long but steady road from southwestern Texas to Boston, where until 
this summer St. Clair was one of two assistant conductors of the Boston 
Symphony -- and from playing first trumpet in a high school band to sharing the 
prestigious, $150,000 1990 Seaver/National Endowment for the Arts Conductors 
Award with Florida Symphony music director Kenneth Jean. 
</P>
<P>
Past winners have included Kent Nagano, music director of the Berkeley Symphony 
and L'Opera de Lyon, and Hugh Wolff, music director of the New Jersey Symphony 
and principal conductor of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra. In 1988, the award 
was shared by three conductors: Catherine Comet, music director of the Grand 
Rapids Symphony and the American Symphony Orchestra; Jahja Ling, music director 
of the Florida Orchestra in Tampa and resident conductor of the Cleveland 
Symphony, and Neal Stulberg, music director of the New Mexico Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair studied conducting with Walter Ducloux at the University of Texas at 
Austin and taught music from 1976-78 at Southern Illinois University at 
Edwardsville then moved to the University of Michigan to teach conducting for 
eight years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he became a conducting fellow at Tanglewood, Mass., the summer home of 
the Boston Symphony, and the following January he became one of the orchestra's 
assistants. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1989, he toured with the late conductor Leonard Bernstein and 
conducted various orchestras in East Berlin, Leningrad, Milan, Paris and Rome, 
among other cities. This past August, he stepped in to take over for an ailing 
Bernstein at Tanglewood, and led his 1988 song cycle, "Arias and Barcarolles." 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult for me to comment on the death of Mr. Bernstein right 
now," St. Clair said Monday. "All I know right now is that, as soon as I heard 
the news, I felt a great emptiness and a great void. When we woke up this 
morning, for everybody, there was a great person missing from us." 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair has a three-year contract with the Pacific and will lead six pairs of 
classical concerts each season at the Performing Arts Center and two concerts 
each summer season at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
He holds two other positions as music director -- of the Ann Arbor (Mich.) 
Symphony and the Cayuga Chamber Orchestra of Ithaca, N.Y. -- one of which he 
must drop because of his contractual obligations to the Pacific. He says he has 
not yet decided which will go. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair's goal, he said, is to make the Pacific "a nationally ranked, 
nationally recognized orchestra, which provides an extremely high artistic 
level of excellence." 
</P>
<P>
What he sees as the next step toward that goal is the development of "an 
orchestral sound, ensemble, intonation and energy. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing," he said, "is the musical sound of the orchestra, to 
have the same concept of sound so that we're all working towards a tone quality 
and an orchestral discipline which is united and similar." 
</P>
<P>
The notoriety gained from the Seaver award likely has attracted the attention 
of other orchestras, but St. Clair -- in his first week on the job -- maintains 
he is only concerned with the matter at hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I never think in terms of what something does for my career, but only of the 
music," he said. "We have an orchestra that is certainly capable of making 
music at the highest level. That's why I'm here. If you think too much about 
your career, you get off on the wrong tangent." 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair has not made radical departures in programming for the new season. 
"We began our season with a short contemporary work (William Kraft's "Vintage 
1990-91," commissioned by the orchestra to celebrate St. Clair's inaugural 
season). But the most important thing is a well-balanced diet of musical 
styles. I hope to be able to walk that line of balance carefully so as to allow 
the orchestra to perform standard repertory and to introduce new works -- but 
in the proper balance." 
</P>
<P>
He has, however, experimented in rearranging traditional order. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it's very boring to have an overture, a concerto and symphony; 
overture, concerto, symphony," he said. "Standard, I think, is a dangerous word 
when it involves an art form which is always changing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to make each program a little different so that every time that 
someone comes to the hall, it's not, 'If I'm five minutes late, I'm going to 
miss the overture.' You might miss a whole Mozart symphony if you miss the 
first piece." 
</P>
<P>
Recent local press stories have chronicled his arrival in Orange County -- 
buying a townhouse in Turtle Rock, purchasing furniture -- in almost painful 
detail. St. Clair said he hasn't read them. And while he doesn't "avoid press," 
he added that "most of the time," he doesn't read reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"If the performance is good or not good, I'm usually the first one who knows 
that," he said. "If (a critic) doesn't or does agree, then that's (his or her) 
job. It's not my job. My job is to know whether I did a credible job or knew my 
music, knew the music as well as I could and conducted it as well as I could. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm always listening to things. If someone says this or that, I'm always 
aware, and I would think through it. Learning is important to me. I'm not 
beyond learning." 
</P>
<P>
He is particularly looking forward to learning with the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to develop a musical relationship with the musicians of this 
orchestra," he said. "And that's about to happen. It takes time. It has to 
happen as it happens. It's like a relationship with a person, place. This just 
happens to be a group of people. 
</P>
<P>
"But through music we will find one another, and that will begin to be the 
relationship which will help us take future steps. The first thing is to meet 
one another in the music. That's always a tremendous thing. It creates 
tremendous emotion."

THE ISSUES CONFRONTING HYATT'S COMPUTER-CHIP CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks Has received an application for a 
patent for a new and useful invention. The title and description of the 
invention are enclosed. The requirements of law have been complied with, and it 
has been determined that a patent on the invention shall be granted under the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
If Gilbert P. Hyatt's patent is challenged in court, here are some of the 
issues that the court would likely consider, according to patent law experts: 
</P>
<P>
Prior art, or previous inventions: Did Hyatt really invent the computer on a 
chip before Intel Corp., Texas Instruments and others in the industry? 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt's patent will be difficult to attack because Hyatt has the benefit of the 
earliest known filing date, Dec. 28, 1970, for a microprocessor-related 
application, said Susan Nycum, a Palo Alto patent attorney. However, if either 
Intel or TI can show that they started work on their products before Hyatt did 
in 1968, and diligently carried them through to conclusion, they could prevail 
even though they filed later. 
</P>
<P>
If Hyatt amended his claims later to clarify his invention, does he deserve the 
benefit of the 1970 filing date? Hyatt notes that his first filing stated the 
invention would be built on a single integrated circuit chip; opponents, 
however, could challenge the patent office's assessment of his original claims. 
</P>
<P>
Claim construction: Are the claims listed in Hyatt's patent broad enough to 
cover the entire microprocessor market and other devices such as 
microcontrollers? 
</P>
<P>
Michael A. Ladra, a patent attorney in Palo Alto, said the claims appear 
broad-based, but potential opponents may try to argue that the patent does not 
apply to Reduced Instruction Set Computing microprocessors, which use a 
different architectural approach as well as certain high-performance 
microprocessors made by Intel. 
</P>
<P>
Obviousness and reduction to practice: Is Hyatt's device an invention that 
improved upon the state of the art at the time? Some critics say no. Federico 
Faggin, one of the Intel inventors, said that the idea of building a computer 
on a chip was commonplace. The real breakthrough, he claims, was fabricating 
the device so that it was economical. 
</P>
<P>
Did Hyatt patent a pipe dream or did he create a working device? Even though 
Hyatt's device was never available commercially, for the purposes of patent 
law, a filing that describes an invention that can be built and which will 
function as claimed is adequate for reduction to practice. It does not have to 
prove itself a commercial success. 
</P>
<P>
Enablement: Could a person of ordinary skill in the industry have built Hyatt's 
chip from the information contained in the original filing? This issue delayed 
issuance of the patent for about two years, but Hyatt eventually was able to 
satisfy the patent examiners. 
</P>
<P>
Because Hyatt did not describe how the chip would be built, the patent 
examiners doubted that a chip with 2,000 transistors for a processor and an 
estimated 10,000 transistors for memory could have been built at the time 
without further experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hyatt showed that his design had resolved the "pin problem." This 
problem involved how to pack thousands of transistors on a tiny chip and still 
have room for the bulky connecting pins needed to transfer data on the chip. 
Hyatt figured a way to transmit data between transistors on a kind of 
time-sharing basis to accommodate all the transistors with only 34 pins. 
</P>
<P>
He also provided documentation to show that electronics companies in the early 
1970s had the technology to build the chip he designed. Other sources disagree 
with Hyatt's assessment of the importance of serial data transmission, noting 
that later processors used parallel transmission. DEAN TAKAHASHI

ESCAPE FROM HOLLYWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
SO NEAR AND YET SO FAR, ORANGE COUNTY HAS LONG HISTORY AS CELEBRITY HIDEAWAY

Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall used to hold weekend trysts aboard his boat 
in Newport Harbor during the 1944 filming of "To Have and Have Not," the 
still-married Bogart careful to keep Bacall under wraps below deck as they 
moved away from the slip. Newport was far from what Bogie liked to call the 
"Hollywood gossip and leeches." Bette Davis had eyes for Laguna. In the '40s, 
she bought a house overlooking Woods Cove, its "breathtaking view of the sea 
and sky" a respite from her legendary battles with studio boss Jack Warner. 
Orange County may be perceived as an endless string of housing tracts and 
shopping malls, but for decades it has been a playground, a place for 
celebrities to escape the congestion and notoriety of Hollywood. And like the 
famous folks' own mercurial popularity, Orange County's celebrity roster is 
constantly changing. In 1989, actor Chuck Norris sold his home in North Tustin 
to be closer to his work in Hollywood. Six months ago, singer Jose Feliciano, 
who had lived in Villa Park since 1969, sold his ranch-style home (complete 
with recording studio) and moved to Westin, Conn. And last March best-selling 
author Joseph Wambaugh, who has lived on and off in Newport Beach the past 13 
years, put his Linda Isle home on the market. 
</P>
<P>
But just as some names are erased from the county's celebrity score card, new 
ones are added. 
</P>
<P>
Singer-actress Bette Midler, who bought a home in Laguna Beach in the late 
'80s, has been spotted working out at a local health club. Actor Robert Englund 
(Freddy in the "Nightmare on Elm Street" films) also bought a weekend home in 
Laguna, where he can be seen surfing with the locals. 
</P>
<P>
And last November pop singer Tiffany moved to Orange County after finding the 
"perfect" house in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
While she doesn't relish the commute to Los Angeles for work, the Norwalk 
native told a reporter she couldn't live in L.A.: "It's too crowded." 
</P>
<P>
To put Tiffany's move to Orange County in historical perspective, we offer this 
celebrity sampler: 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood's Back Lot 
</P>
<P>
One stormy midnight in 1910, three carloads of actors, film-crew members and 
cowboy extras pulled into the depot at San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Biograph Studio, a 50-member New York company spending the winter in the 
California sunshine, was headed by the legendary director D. W. Griffith. Among 
the cast: an unknown 17-year-old actress who would later be known as America's 
Sweetheart, Mary Pickford. 
</P>
<P>
Checking into a two-story wooden hotel with only 10 bedrooms, two toilets and a 
single tub, the movie makers waited out the storm for three days and then 
proceeded to shoot an 18th-Century Spanish romance in and around the old 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
"The Two Brothers," a one-reeler, was the first motion picture ever made in 
Orange County, according to historian Jim Sleeper, author of "Great Movies Shot 
in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Over the next two decades, as Hollywood became the film capital of the world, 
hundreds of silent movies were filmed, at least in part, in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
And county residents, who were often hired as extras, could observe some of the 
silent screen's great stars emoting before hand-cranked cameras: Theda Bara, 
Buster Keaton, Douglas Fairbanks, Harold Lloyd and John Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
As Sleeper says, during the period between 1910 and 1930, Orange County reigned 
as "Hollywood's most popular back lot." 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1925, Mary Pickford and her swashbuckling husband, Douglas 
Fairbanks, began leasing a quarter-mile stretch of beach in Irvine Cove north 
of Laguna, where they would set up colorfully striped tents for their large 
retinue of family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood's most popular back lot" would soon become one of Hollywood's most 
popular back yards. 
</P>
<P>
Palmy Days 
</P>
<P>
When the Spanish colonial-style Balboa Inn was built on the Balboa peninsula in 
1930, it quickly became a favorite haunt of the movie crowd. The 34-room inn's 
celebrity guest list included Gary Cooper, Cary Grant and a host of big bands 
that played at the nearby Rendezvous Ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
The '30s and '40s were the heyday of Orange County's Hollywood connection. 
</P>
<P>
It was a time when Bogart, Errol Flynn, Dick Powell, Leo Carillo, Tom Mix, 
Preston Foster and James Cagney (who bought Collins Island in 1938) docked 
their boats in Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, Bogart even served in the Coast Guard out of Balboa and 
was on duty once a week patrolling the shore. And when the 45-year-old actor 
fell in love with his 19-year-old co-star, they spent frequent weekends 
together in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
As Bacall wrote in her autobiography: "Bogie wanted me to see Newport -- to 
feel the atmosphere that he had described to me so many times and loved so 
much." 
</P>
<P>
Late movie tough guy Broderick Crawford, a frequent visitor to Newport Beach in 
the '40s, recalled those palmy days in a 1978 interview at the Newporter Inn. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fun to come down here," he said in his familiar just-woke-up croak. 
Sipping his second vodka of the morning, to "kill" his hangover, the Academy 
Award-winner explained: "We worked like a SOB on a picture, then we'd come down 
here to sit and enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
"This, to me, is one beautiful area." 
</P>
<P>
Among those who agreed over the years and had homes here were Shirley Temple, 
Jascha Heifitz, Ruby Keeler, Joe E. Brown, Ray Milland, Andy Devine, Buddy 
Ebsen, Leon Aames, Raquel Welch, Mamie Van Doren, Joey Bishop and Telly 
Savalas. 
</P>
<P>
(The skin-domed Savalas kept an apartment at Park Newport in the '70s. He once 
drove up to the clubhouse in his white Rolls-Royce for a fund-raising event 
where he was guest of honor, breezed into the foyer and said to the public 
relations woman: "Give me 10 minutes -- I gotta comb my hair.") 
</P>
<P>
Palmy Days, Part II 
</P>
<P>
Rivaling the Balboa Inn's popularity with the Hollywood set during the '30s and 
'40s was the Hotel Laguna, a mission-style landmark built in 1930 after the 
original wood-frame hotel was razed. The hotel's guest registry included Dick 
Powell, John Barrymore, Errol Flynn, Rosalind Russell, Joan Fontaine, and 
Bogart and Bacall. (The waterfront hotel celebrated its 100th anniversary in 
1988 with souvenir hurricane glasses emblazoned with "Yes! Bogie and I Drank 
Here.") 
</P>
<P>
Many celebrities who vacationed in Laguna wound up buying houses there. 
</P>
<P>
Ozzie and Harriet Nelson bought a weekend home on Camel Point in the late '40s 
and after selling it in the early '50s built another ocean-front home in the 
gated community of Lagunita, where Harriet Nelson has lived full time since 
1978. Rick Nelson also had a condominium down the beach at Blue Lagoon in the 
late '60s, and actor Kent McCord, who got his acting start playing one of 
Rick's fraternity brothers on "Ozzie and Harriet," still has a weekend home in 
Lagunita. 
</P>
<P>
Other Laguna residents over the years include Mickey Rooney, Victor Mature, 
Rock Hudson, Lorne Greene, Mike Connors, Tab Hunter, Sterling Holloway, Polly 
Moran, Frederick March, Robert Armstrong, Claire Trevor, Elmo Lincoln (the 
original Tarzan) and movie character actor Slim Summerville (whose cottage on 
Sleepy Hollow Lane is now the Beach House restaurant). 
</P>
<P>
And then there was Bette Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The Academy Award-winning actress already owned a beachfront house on Sleepy 
Hollow Lane, where her mother, Ruth, lived in 1945 when Davis married her third 
husband, William Grant Sherry, a young artist she had met in Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later the couple bought a new home in nearby Wood's Cove. (A large 
black wrought iron "D," for Davis, on the chimney is still visible from the 
beach below.) 
</P>
<P>
A few months after she moved into her new home, Time magazine reported that the 
39-year-old "high-strung cinemactress"gave birth to her daughter, Barbara Davis 
Sherry, in Santa Ana Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was released from her Warner Bros. contract shortly thereafter and 
relished the freedom to spend time with her young daughter. As she wrote in her 
1962 autobiography: "We spent hours on the beach together -- would call on 
Grandmother for tea. I was so thrilled to be a mother." 
</P>
<P>
Although Davis sold the Woods Cove home after divorcing Sherry and marrying 
actor Gary Merrill in 1950, she returned to Laguna periodically to stay with 
her cousin, John Favour, and his wife, Sally. 
</P>
<P>
"We inherited all her mother's furniture and it was almost like coming home for 
her when she came to visit us," recalls Sally Favour, who describes Davis as "a 
great family person, very fond of our children, very close to them all and very 
good to all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Slept Here 
</P>
<P>
Ever since it opened across the street from Disneyland in 1955, the Disneyland 
Hotel has attracted more stars than a Hollywood premiere. Over the years, 
hundreds of celebrity VIPs have stayed there, including Marlon Brando, Steve 
McQueen, Lucille Ball, Cary Grant, Jack Benny, Bob Hope and Elizabeth Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jackson, however, must hold the celebrity track record. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson has been known to check into a suite at the hotel as often as four 
times a year, usually during the Magic Kingdom's off-season. He visited several 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time he was here he went out shopping in some of our shops," said a 
hotel spokesman. "Quite a number of guests recognized him and said 'hi' to him. 
He was real good-natured about that, very personable and friendly." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who always pays to have a Disneyland host or hostess escort him around 
the Magic Kingdom, sometimes shows up on his own; other times he brings young 
friends or family members. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually he dresses down, but if he's recognized he does create a bit of a 
stir," said a Disneyland spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Does the Gloved One have a favorite ride? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, he likes them all," the spokeswoman said. "He's a real Disney aficionado 
and loves everything about the park." 
</P>
<P>
A Stay in Infamy 
</P>
<P>
Not every celebrity who crosses the county line receives VIP treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"Officer Nabs Film Vamp Near Santa Ana" blared the front-page headline in 1921 
when Hollywood star Bebe Daniels was arrested for speeding through the county. 
Clocked at an unforgivable 56 m.p.h., Daniels was sentenced to 10 days in the 
Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Five decades later, in 1970, Truman Capote had his day in court and a stay in 
the county pokey. 
</P>
<P>
Failing to answer a court subpoena to testify at the trial of a triple slayer 
he had interviewed in prison, the famed author of "In Cold Blood" was sentenced 
to three days in jail for contempt of court. 
</P>
<P>
Capote, however, was released after only 18 1/2 hours. Jail officials reported 
that the diminutive author had spent a restless and "understandably nervous" 
night in jail but was in good spirits before "quietly slipping away to his Palm 
Springs home." 
</P>
<P>
During Richard Nixon's presidential days, one of Orange County's top tourist 
attractions was La Casa Pacific, the Western White House in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
The one-story Spanish-style home, built in 1924, is where Nixon retreated after 
resigning from office in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
During his political exile, Nixon kept a relatively low profile behind the 
closely guarded walls of La Casa Pacifica. But he surfaced occasionally, 
celebrating his 65th birthday in 1978 at El Adobe restaurant, a favorite dining 
spot during his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it wasn't like the glory days when Dan Rather and other members of the 
White House press corps holed up in the Surf and Sand Hotel in Laguna Beach to 
record his every move. 
</P>
<P>
Footnote: During Nixon's 1972 reelection campaign, Villa "A" at the Newporter 
Inn earned a place in history. 
</P>
<P>
The two-story, three bedroom suite, which served briefly as Nixon's summer 
office in 1969, is where Martha Mitchell, wife of Atty. Gen. John Mitchell, 
made her famous late-night phone call to UPI reporter Helen Thomas complaining 
that she was "sick and tired" of politics and that she had threatened to leave 
her husband unless he got out of the political arena. 
</P>
<P>
The phone call ended abruptly after Mrs. Mitchell was heard to say, "You just 
get away!" Reported Thomas: "Attempts to regain the broken connection failed 
when an operator said, 'Mrs. Mitchell is indisposed and cannot talk.' " 
</P>
<P>
Martha Mitchell later identified the man who allegedly tore the telephone from 
the wall during her conversation with Thomas as Steve King, the new head of 
security for the Committee to Reelect the President. 
</P>
<P>
Duke's Domain 
</P>
<P>
When John Wayne moved to Newport Beach in 1965, his sprawling bay-front house 
became the most popular attraction on the Newport Harbor boat tours. 
</P>
<P>
That didn't change with the Duke's death in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wayne's former home has been remodeled extensively since it was sold 
in 1980, tourists still strain to catch a glimpse of the house where the Ringo 
Kid once lived. 
</P>
<P>
When he was alive, Wayne always waved to the passing parade of fans, although 
he once good-naturedly groused about being on constant exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
"Hell, I have to wear my wig -- I can't even come out in my front yard," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fans expecting to pay their respects to Wayne at nearby Pacific View Memorial 
Park in Corona del Mar will be disappointed. The man who spent a lifetime in 
the public eye rests in an unmarked grave on a hilltop overlooking Newport 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Those with eagle eyes -- or a good pair of binoculars -- can catch a glimpse of 
The Cowboy, California Angels owner Gene Autry, in his private box behind home 
plate at Anaheim Stadium nearly every home game. 
</P>
<P>
"America's favorite singing cowboy" watches the games with his wife, Jackie, 
but he's been known to have a few friends along: singers Glen Campbell and 
Johnny Mathis and Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Behind Autry's 24-seat box is a private suite for entertaining. And although 
the Autrys have food served to them in their box, The Cowboy generally keeps 
the talking to a minimum once the game starts. 
</P>
<P>
Explained a team executive: "He doesn't like to be interrupted." 
</P>
<P>
And Finally . . . 
</P>
<P>
Onetime Laguna Beach resident Harrison Ford on how he got the scar on his chin 
in the late '60s when he was trying to break into the movies (Vanity Fair, 
August, 1990): 
</P>
<P>
"I was an assistant buyer in the knickknacks and oil-paintings department of 
the Bullock's department store in Santa Ana. I was on my way to work at 
Bullock's one morning. I used to drive through the Laguna Canyon. I had one of 
those old Volvos . . . and I had forgotten to put on my seat belt. I reached 
over to take my seat belt off the hook, and my attention went to that. And I 
hit a high curb and the car went up on two wheels and smashed into a telephone 
pole. I hit the steering wheel, I think." 
</P>
<P>
Singer Donny Osmond on why he and his wife and three children moved to Irvine 
(L.A. Times, 1985): 
</P>
<P>
"I could be in Los Angeles but it's definitely not a place where I'd like my 
kids to grow up. What we've got right now is an ideal situation for them. And 
that is kids all over the neighborhood, running up and down the streets. Now 
that I've got that, I'm satisfied even though I have got to drive an hour up to 
the city because that's where I spend all my time." 
</P>
<P>
Actor Englund on how his Laguna Beach neighbors have taken to having the star 
of the "A Nightmare on Elm Street" movies living on their street (L.A. Times, 
1990): 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're just happy Robert Englund keeps his leaves raked." 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE COUNTY CELEBRITY ROSTER 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has long been a favorite getaway destination -- or even home -- 
for some of Los Angeles' and Hollywood's biggest stars. Some of those who 
escaped to Orange County include:

HOST OF STARS HAVE HOME-GROWN ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "first bona fide film star" to hale from Orange County was an overweight 
kid nicknamed Fatty by his classmates at Central Grammar School in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Roscoe (Fatty) Arbuckle, whose boyhood home was at 5th and Spurgeon streets, 
was one of the most popular comedians of the silent era before scandal in the 
'20s ruined his career. 
</P>
<P>
But the rotund actor was the toast of Santa Ana in 1917 when he appeared on 
stage at the Yost Theater to plug his new picture, according to county 
historian Jim Sleeper. 
</P>
<P>
Introduced as "another of Santa's Ana's world-famous sons," Arbuckle reminisced 
about pulling a red wagon all over town delivering the washing his mother took 
in, hawking candy and peanuts on the old Newport Railway and performing for the 
first time at the Grand Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
A latter-day funnyman, Steve Martin, also had early work experience in Orange 
County. When his family moved from Inglewood to Garden Grove in 1955, 
10-year-old Steve landed a job selling guidebooks at nearby Disneyland after 
school, weekends and summers. 
</P>
<P>
During his eight years at the Magic Kingdom, including a stint behind the magic 
shop counter, Martin became good friends with entertainer Wally Boag, star of 
the Golden Horseshoe Revue. 
</P>
<P>
Boag would often take his youthful protege with him when he performed at 
private shows. Martin's mother, Mary Lee Martin of Corona del Mar, once 
recalled that Boag would introduce Steve as being "very bashful and retiring -- 
so just bear with him." Then Steve would walk out with a "a loud cap and sports 
jacket, doing the Twist." 
</P>
<P>
Martin once told Newsweek magazine that he had "enough innate intelligence to 
get B's and C's" in high school "but I was mostly a goof-off." He did run 
successfully for cheerleader at Garden Grove High School. But, as he told 
audiences in the '70s, "the other cheerleaders were so jealous they wouldn't 
use my cheers. I wrote, 'Die, you gravy-sucking pigs.' " 
</P>
<P>
At the same time that Martin was attending high school in Garden Grove in the 
early '60s, Diane Keaton was attending Santa Ana High. 
</P>
<P>
In high school, Keaton told Time magazine in 1977, she wore "white lipstick and 
black net stockings. Oh, wow." She also sang in the Methodist Church choir. 
"When I was really small," she told Time, "I used to go out in the yard and 
sing to the moon. It was like plugging into a great big battery." 
</P>
<P>
And years before Michelle Pfeiffer writhed atop a grand piano in a thigh-high 
red velvet dress in "The Fabulous Baker Boys," she was a Midway City moppet 
"singing to the garden hose and pretending I was Elvis Presley." As a 
teen-ager, she told People magazine, "I was the beach bunny . . . into all 
kinds of drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Among the many part-time jobs the former Miss Orange County held before 
becoming an actress was as a checker at the old Vons supermarket on Beach 
Boulevard and Atlanta Avenue in Huntington Beach. (It's now a Pic 'n Save.) 
</P>
<P>
Recalled one of Pfeiffer's former co-workers: "The customers and box boys would 
always ask her, 'Why are you working in a grocery store? You're so pretty.' In 
fact, I told her, 'You're so pretty you should be a model.' She was kind of an 
airhead, just kind of a surfer chick." 
</P>
<P>
Other entertainers whose roots extend into Orange County include Kevin Costner 
(Villa Park High), Bill Medley (Santa Ana High), Bobby Hatfield (Anaheim High), 
Jennifer Warnes (Mater Dei), producer-director Frank Marshall (Newport Harbor) 
and Kelly McGillis (a Newport Harbor High School graduate who joined the board 
of the Grove Shakespeare Festival in Garden Grove last May.)

SIMI VALLEY; 
</P>
<P>
225 WEAPONS SEIZED IN RECORD RAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An arsenal of knives, grenades and machine guns uncovered last week at a Simi 
Valley residence was the largest collection of weaponry ever seized during a 
drug raid in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they found 125 firearms and 100 bladed weapons -- along with 
$750,000 worth of cocaine -- in an upstairs bedroom when they stormed a house 
and arrested Gardner Ernest Flockhart, 31, a suspected high-level cocaine 
dealer. 
</P>
<P>
Flockhart and Robert Dale Lloyd, 27, were charged Thursday with one count each 
of possession with intent to distribute about one kilogram of cocaine, 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Sally Meloch said. Other charges may be filed in 
connection with the remaining cocaine and the weapons, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said it was the most extensive collection found 
during a drug raid in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure culminated a six-month investigation by local law enforcement 
agencies into a ring suspected of distributing cocaine to residents of Ventura 
and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
Flockhart was convicted of possession of narcotics for sale in Los Angeles 
County in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
As a convicted felon, it is illegal for Flockhart to possess any firearms, 
Bowman said. If convicted in federal court, Flockhart could receive a 40-year 
prison sentence, Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 125 firearms were 12 illegal weapons. They included four 
semiautomatic Uzi-type weapons, which had been converted to fully automatic 
machine guns. Some guns had been outfitted with silencers, five rifles were 
fitted with illegal short barrels, Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
The departments involved in the investigation stand to gain $700,000 to $1 
million through state asset-forfeiture laws from the house, guns, six vehicles 
and other belongings.

CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS NOT EXPECTED TO CHANGE THE STATUS QUO;

<P>
Incumbent Democrat Howard L. Berman of Panorama City is seeking a fifth term in 
his San Fernando Valley-Westside district. 
</P>
<P>
He faces Republican businessman Roy Dahlson of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Like his colleague Henry Waxman in the neighboring 24th District, Berman is 
regarded as a heavyweight in the House and in California politics. He is a 
member of the Budget, Foreign Affairs and Judiciary committees, and is 
particularly influential on immigration matters. 
</P>
<P>
Berman had $285,040 on hand in May. His major contributors include the Airline 
Pilots Assn., trial lawyers, bricklayers and allied craftsmen, realtors and an 
insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson, a wholesale florist, reported campaign funds of $513. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson says his campaign is based generally on a conservative Republican 
philosophy of "peace through strength." He says he is opposed to tax increases 
of any kind and is supportive of cutting government spending and waste. 
</P>
<P>
Berman is a leading advocate of a woman's right to choose an abortion. Dahlson 
says he opposes abortion in most circumstances, but stops short of advocating a 
constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson said he is concerned about the federal budget deficit and complains 
that Berman gives lip service to cutting back programs. "I don't hear him being 
outspoken (on budget issues) in spite of his power and position," Dahlson said. 
</P>
<P>
Berman received $22,700 in honorariums in 1989 and took a number of trips paid 
for by industry. 
</P>
<P>
Libertarian Bernard Zimring is also on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
26TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
</P>
<P>
The district: Hillside areas above Hollywood, Bel-Air, and Beverly Hills, plus 
the northeastern San Fernando Valley.

PERFECT PLACES TO UNWIND WHEN IT ALL BECOMES TOO MUCH

Getaways. Hideaways. Retreats. Resorts. These are destinations for stressful 
times. We yearn to flee far, far away from tense jobs, polluted cities, more 
bad news. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, we're escaping the real world. But we need a place to re-think our lives, 
a place of blissful days and tranquil nights. We want only to bask in the sun, 
frolic in the water, marvel at the sunset, breathe in the fresh mountain air, 
take in a bit of local color and throw our watches aside. We wouldn't mind a 
beautiful room, first-rate food and fastidious service in the bargain. Frankly, 
we refuse to feel guilty about not having the energy to traipse through yet 
another museum, rough it in the wilderness or even schmooze with other 
tourists. And it would be nice if we could find some new paradise before the 
madding crowd has discovered it. 
</P>
<P>
There are such escapes. In Thailand, only the royal family and blessed few 
others know about magical Hua-Hin. In Mexico, a few chic Europeans and Latinos 
hide out at a hidden resort called Careyes. In Fiji, the locals have their 
small island paradises practically to themselves. At an Idaho guest ranch, the 
salmon and deer are your closest neighbors for miles around. In Majorca, 
romance reigns morning, noon and night at an ancient villa. In Colorado and 
Utah, the snow is pure, the lift lines are short and the millionaires mingle. 
</P>
<P>
It's going to be difficult to come home again.

A ROYAL RETREAT; 
</P>
<P>
THAILAND'S HUA-HIN, A MERE 150 MILES FROM BANGKOK, IS THE EPICENTER OF A 
BLESSED TIME WARP, A PRISTINE RESORT WITH A PEDIGREE REACHING BACK TO THE FIRST 
DECADES OF THIS CENTURY WHEN IT BECAME A PLAYGROUND FOR SIAM'S KINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STIRLING SILLIPHANT, Silliphant, the veteran screenwriter (Towering Inferno, 
Poseidon Adventure), won an Academy Award for In the Heat of the Night. He nows 
lives in Bangkok and is currently at work on a screenplay (The Fusion) for the 
Japanese film-maker Juzo Itami, which is scheduled to be shot in Tokyo next 
spring. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I count myself among those hedonists of travel who seek out still-evocative and 
unique enclaves of sea, sky and earth, especially since I presently reside in 
the concrete zoo known as Bangkok, where gridlock is as much an accepted 
lifestyle as it is in Southern California. When my lungs are about to collapse, 
I hasten 150 miles southwest of Bangkok to the fishing community of Hua-Hin, 
the ultimate escape hatch in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
I say hasten not to be unduly apocalyptic but because the secret of this quiet 
seaside resort -- despite 79 years of modesty and nonaggrandizement -- is now 
definitely out of the bag. Sophisticated travelers who have sated themselves 
with Bangkok -- such discriminating folk as film producer David Putnam 
("Chariots of Fire") and the English director Roland Joffee ("The Killing 
Fields") -- are exponentially bypassing the more publicized second-stop 
destinations in Thailand -- over-crowded Pattaya, over-priced Phuket, 
over-praised Chiang Mai -- for the immutable tranquillity of unspoiled Hua-Hin. 
</P>
<P>
During any given week, the majority of tourists to be found blissed out on 
Hua-Hin's powdery beaches are primarily European -- mostly French, German and 
English. Affluent Thai families pop down on weekends in their Mercedes sedans 
or Beamers. Inexplicably, the Americans have not yet landed. Most are more apt 
to be dutifully checking off the list of must-sees in Bangkok and are thus 
missing out on the meaning of pure relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
In Thai hua means head and hin means stone, producing in tandem the somewhat 
ominous English inscription headstone. The actual translation is Stone Head, 
the local name for Takiab Hill, a dominating coastal escarpment angled into the 
Gulf of Thailand at the southern tip of what must certifiably be one of the 
planet's longest uninterrupted strands of beach. 
</P>
<P>
If you station yourself on the peak of Takiab Hill, you can gaze with stunned 
serenity toward a distant, blurred point 39 miles to the north, where this 
incredible beach finally vanishes from sight somewhere beyond Phetchaburi. 
Getting up to the stony summit of this Gibraltar-like promontory is not for the 
irregular of heart. You have to leave the beach and climb up 100 steps -- maybe 
120, maybe 96 or 97 -- I was breathing so hard on the way up I lost count. Once 
on the ridge, your reward is an unforgettable vista of white sand -- and the 
challenge of temple monkeys who jounce around you impatiently as they wait for 
you to feed them clusters of tiny bananas available from opportunistic vendors. 
</P>
<P>
From this vantage point I found it easy on my first visit to conjure up a 
vision of Joseph Conrad sailing along this shoreline as master of the Otago, 
his first command, 100 years ago. I'm certain that what he saw then is what I'm 
seeing now: the straight line of the flat Thai shore joined to the unruffled 
gulf as though stapled, edge to edge, with a perfect, unmarked closeness; one 
leveled floor, half brown, half apple green, under the enormous dome of a sky 
streaked with lenticular clouds created by swift winds racing at high altitude 
above the Tanao Sri Range. 
</P>
<P>
The miracle of Hua-Hin is that it has remained pristine despite the fact it was 
Thailand's first resort, with a pedigree reaching back to the first decade of 
this century when it became a royal playground. 
</P>
<P>
Pattaya, on the eastern side of the gulf, has come full-blown in only the past 
10 years and is currently struggling to overcome a negative-impact world press 
critical of chronic water shortages, polluted beaches and wall-to-wall bars, 
not to mention occasional lurid accounts of European tourists found dead of 
drug overdoses in steamy sub-soi hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Phuket, located to the south on an island of the same name, is well on its way 
to overdevelopment -- all in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Chiang Mai, north of Bangkok, has sprouted a skyline and generated traffic 
congestion in the past two. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Hua-Hin remains blessedly within its own time warp. The luxury hotels and 
beachfront condos that have recently been -- or are presently being -- built 
are judiciously spaced along that boundless stretch of beach; they appear not 
at all invasive. On the contrary, they provide the world-class amenities 
today's travelers demand, and in the case of Hua-Hin, these amenities have been 
made available with thought for the environment and the area's perpetual 
low-key charm. 
</P>
<P>
How to account for this? As in other developing nations in Southeast Asia, 
Thailand suffers at the hands of opportunists, both Thai nationals and foreign 
businessmen, people compelled to chain-saw the last of the country's teak 
forests or to undermine its soil for salt. Outcries from environmentalists seem 
not to have halted this obsessive encroachment upon Thailand's natural beauty. 
Protest and debate there are, certainly. One top minister recently predicted 
that unless the predators were stopped, the country could become a desert in 
two decades. But there appears to be little positive action to arrest the 
dismantling process. 
</P>
<P>
So how does Hua-Hin manage to go its own graceful, unruffled way, dancing the 
minuet while everyone else is writhing to the beat of the lambada? 
</P>
<P>
One answer may lie in the reverence of the Thai people toward their king and 
queen. The reigning monarch, King Bhumibol, and his Queen Sirikit spend time 
each summer at their palace in Hua-Hin. During their stay, they visit villages 
and inspect royalty-sponsored co-op and development projects that they have 
initiated. It would be unseemly and quite un-Thai to despoil Camelot with the 
kind of garish high jinks that so enlivens Pattaya. The very countryside around 
the summer palace reflects this sensitivity and decorum, and indeed the randy 
foreigner looking for companionship will be frustrated to find only one 
"full-body" massage parlor in all of Hua-Hin and this -- with the un-Thai-like 
name of Petch Barber -- tucked well away down a dead-end soi. 
</P>
<P>
Another answer to Hua-Hin's resolute preservation can be found in its history. 
In December, 1911, King Rama VI was crowned in Bangkok before a gathering of 
more European bluebloods than had ever before graced an Asian coronation. 
Royalty from Sweden, Russia and England were stumbling all over their ermine 
capes, but once the ceremonies were done, the king's brother, Prince 
Chakrabongse, and the prince's Russian wife gathered up the European young 
bloods and whisked them south into a wild countryside in search of tiger. A 
royal encampment was set up on in the province of Prachusbkhirkhan, a site from 
which the happy campers could sip Champagne and savor the awesome sunrises or 
sally westward for game into the mountainous divide between Thailand and Burma. 
</P>
<P>
The prince and his wife became so enamored of the old fishing village planked 
into the foot of Takiab Hill that they ordered a villa built, one that stands 
to this day behind a seawall on the northern extremity of Hua-Hin's gentle 
beach. Others among Siam's high society soon followed the prince's example and 
acquired beachfront property on which to build mansions as retreats from 
Bangkok's sultry trinity -- March, April and May. 
</P>
<P>
Hua-Hin's prominence was further accelerated by the completion of the Southern 
Railroad linking Bangkok to the Malaysian border. Prince Purachatra, director 
general of the state railways, built an elegant Victorian hotel in Hua-Hin, 
quite properly named the Railway Hotel, with two low wings extending toward the 
beachfront, space enough between them for gardens alive with fanciful topiary, 
long verandas laced with fretwork and everywhere wicker chairs into any one of 
which you can easily picture Somerset Maugham settling down to sip his iced 
coconut water. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually the king himself became entranced with Hua-Hin. In July, 1927, 
artisans completed his summer palace. It was given the languid name Klai 
Klangwol, which in English means "far from worries," a somewhat overly 
optimistic claim, it turned out, for in 1932, the king, while in residence in 
Hua-Hin, learned that 700 years of absolute monarchy had come crashing down in 
a bloodless coup d'etat. In his absence from Bangkok, the army, together with 
powerful civilian leaders, had installed a constitutional monarchy. It was thus 
at Hua-Hin that a Siamese king was first compelled to accept historical 
imperative -- and to "chill out." 
</P>
<P>
The Thais call this condition sabai-sabai. Grin and bear it. Relax. Go with the 
flow. Lie back and watch the clouds. Of all places in Thailand, Hua-Hin is the 
epicenter of sabai-sabai. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike so many other tourist sites in the country, the area remains vigorously 
Thai. Because of this, days and nights spent there seem charged with a 
never-ending potential for sensory bombardment, yet nothing strident, to be 
sure. Mystical possibilities hover everywhere, like beckoning Tinkerbells. 
Without listening, one hears from every quarter the grace notes of the 
unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, driving to a temple for an appointment with a Buddhist priest -- yes, 
one does make appointments for such consultations -- my wife and I were 
startled by what sounded very much like gongs, yet we were still nowhere near 
the temple. Suddenly we discovered, advancing toward us along the shoulder of a 
modern highway, a procession from the past, yet moving in present time -- a 
young monk holding lotus buds is being led on horseback by attendants afoot, 
all part of an ordination ceremony the Thais call buat naak. Girls in 
traditional costumes and golden, spired headdress glide like puffs of perfume 
ahead of the monk. Musicians and dancers frolic, some to a disco beat, at the 
point of the column and ignore the whipping dust and exhaust fumes of passing 
trucks. Long before trucks existed, processions like this one moved this way, 
intent solely upon their own purposes, not as programmed entertainment for 
tourists. My wife and I shared this pristine event with particular relish 
because we knew that what we had witnessed was a routine and common event in 
the lifetimes of the Thai country people. For us, their ordinary was our 
extraordinary, and it is this kind of paradox I seem more able to find in 
Hua-Hin than in any other part of Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
Effortlessly, Hua-Hin exposes the everyday fabric of Thai country living. You 
can take it or leave it because it is not there for your sake. It is there 
because it has been there as long as Buddha's teachings have been there, and it 
will be there for as long as anyone can imagine time will run. It is aware of 
you, accepts you, even welcomes you, but does so gently, not appearing to wish 
to exploit you, nor wishing you to exploit it. The consequence of all this is 
that one comes to feel a cessation of time in Hua-Hin. Since time is a concept 
of man, man can stretch it if he chooses, and stretch it they do in Hua-Hin, 
where all the inclination to frantic activity drops magically from your 
shoulders as you relinquish yourself to the liberation of languor. 
</P>
<P>
Stroll through the night market. You will not be hassled nor importuned as you 
are in Bangkok. You may buy or not buy, as you wish. The limitless varieties of 
fruits and Thai delicacies may burden you with an overload of choices, so my 
secret is to go after dinner when my belly is full and I can address myself to 
the aesthetics, not to the opportunities of pigging out. 
</P>
<P>
Or walk out on the pier around 7 p.m. when the fishing boats come heeling in. I 
am always amazed by how muted everything sounds. Even the village women 
haggling over fish and squid negotiate in soft tones. The pock-pock-pock of 
trawler engines is borne seaward with the offshore breeze. The harshest sound 
I've ever heard here is the slush of ice sluicing down long funnels from the 
trucks servicing outgoing fishing vessels. As the night lowers, overhead lights 
along the pier are switched on and you glide through pools of alternating light 
and dark like a two-toned ghost doing nothing, absolutely nothing, but drifting 
along the pier. 
</P>
<P>
For travelers unable to surrender themselves to indolence -- an inability from 
which, happily, I do not suffer -- there are activities in Hua-Hin to keep even 
the most hyper in full boost. The flurries of activity are, of course, centered 
in Hua-Hin's three major hotels, where tennis courts and swimming pools, 
windsurfing boards, catamarans and water-ski equipment are available. If these 
are not enough to pack your day, the hotels will arrange boat trips to nearby 
Singto Island or send you deep-sea fishing, a slight misnomer in this instance, 
since the Gulf of Thailand is a remarkably shallow body of water, not more than 
250 feet deep at its deepest point. Or Jeeps can be rented for the drive to 
Pala-u Waterfall, 38 miles west into the mountains shared by Thailand and 
Burma. If you're into trekking, proceed 10 miles north of Hua-Hin, then hang a 
left and continue west into the settling sun and you will find yourself at Kang 
Krachan Dam, within the most extensive of Thailand's national parks. The 
careful observer might even spot a lugubrious slow loris clinging to a branch. 
Other trekkers might hear an exotic barking sound. Probably barking deer. Or 
the voice of a tiger. But then the rewards of trekking are these occasional 
rushes of adrenaline. 
</P>
<P>
In Hua-Hin, the historic Railway Hotel, renovated and renamed the Hotel Sofitel 
Central Hua-Hin, retains a hushed and almost reverential aura of history. Its 
Victorian ambience and rustling ceiling fans pull you back the moment you enter 
the vast lobby, to an earlier time. Whenever I truly need to stop the world and 
get off, I plant myself in a fan-back wicker chair, look out to the Gulf past 
the fanciful shrubbery of the Sofitel's inner grounds, let a double vodka on 
the rocks work its inevitable spell and wonder who sat here before me. The 
echoes of well-turned phrases from another day seem to resonate from the walls. 
Dazzling ladies seem to descend from the gracious central staircase. I have had 
such fancies in other long-famous hotels: the Imperial in Vienna, the Hassler 
in Rome. If tradition is high on your list, the Sofitel is not to be missed. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, to the south, is the Royal Garden Resort, which attracts a trendier 
crowd. The Resort abounds with restaurants and pool-side buffets, not the least 
of which is the Italian Pavilion, a beachfront layout specializing in fresh 
seafood. Top of the line at the Resort are its coveted seventh-floor suites, 
each with a private, screened-off rooftop veranda and outdoor Jacuzzi, where 
one (or more, depending on one's luck) can cavort in unbridled nakedness 
without fear of being observed. 
</P>
<P>
Back up the beach, some three miles north of its sister hotel, the Resort, is 
my favorite haven in all of Thailand: the Royal Garden Village. Truly a 
restorative oasis, it has 162 deluxe rooms on 14 acres of beachfront. Here the 
architecture is authentic Thai, so that the hotel appears to have risen out of 
the palm trees. Every room has a balcony, and walkways lead the guests through 
landscaped gardens to an immense central swimming pool or directly onto the 
beach only a few yards away. 
</P>
<P>
I questioned my instant enchantment when I first went to stay at the Village 
last year. Its owner is one of my new Bangkok friends. When my wife moved to 
Bangkok from Beverly Hills two years ago, we heard about an American who had 
grown up in Thailand and had become something of a legend -- a tycoon when he 
was still in high school. Guy named Bill Heinecke. We met, and one afternoon he 
flew me down to Hua-Hin in his own plane to show me something he's just 
finished building, the Royal Garden Village. 
</P>
<P>
Was my delight in finding a truly Thai environment in the guise of a 
world-class resort genuine, or was I reacting to Bill's hospitality? I've 
returned many times since -- no Bill, no private plane -- and each time the 
original magic awaited me. It could be the way the slender finials on the 
separate compounds lift toward the sunset sky. Or it could simply be that in 
the presence of such architectural grace I plug directly into Thai culture, a 
culture born of many elements, not least of which is the acknowledgement of 
universal divinity within people and things around you. I'll take that any day 
over a state-of-the-art business center and a health club.

FEW WILDERNESS AREAS OFFER THE HARMONY THAT SURROUNDS IDAHO'S SHEPP RANCH, A 
REFUGE OF UNSULLIED SOLITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The seduction began the moment the bush pilot maneuvered the little 
single-engine airplane out of the heavens and into the canyon through which 
flows the Salmon, Idaho's storied River of No Return. Settling onto an unpaved 
runway, the plane bounced over potholes while a herd of elk stared motionless 
from a towering peak and a lone eagle rode a thermal above pinnacles that 
pierced an incredibly blue sky. As the pilot switched off the engine, the voice 
of a blue jay called out from the forest and the wind wafted through a stand of 
ponderosa pine. 
</P>
<P>
Few wilderness areas on earth offer the harmony that surrounds Shepp Ranch, a 
hideaway in central Idaho that's unrivaled -- anywhere in the West -- for 
tranquillity. It is here that runaways from America's crowded cities arrive to 
recharge their souls in a setting that features Rocky Mountain peaks, Alpine 
meadows and the soothing song of the Salmon as it wends its way through the 
second-deepest gorge in North America -- a gorge deeper even than the Grand 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Guests at Shepp Ranch learn the true meaning of solitude, which is why no one 
is eager to leave. Not after a few days, not even a couple of weeks. This isn't 
to say that Shepp is one of those country-club ranches. Indeed, it is without 
television, telephones or newspapers. It is for this very reason that 
vacationers wishing to escape the pressure cooker choose Shepp with its 
scattering of rustic cabins and engaging lodge where a friendly mutt named 
Cotter snoozes while logs snap in the fireplace and guests read or play cards. 
A bearskin covers one wall, and a bookcase contains a collection of National 
Geographic magazines dating to 1916. 
</P>
<P>
At Shepp Ranch no one locks a door, simply because it is unnecessary. Without a 
road for miles, no one gives a hoot about security. Shepp is an experience that 
haunts the psyche -- long after one returns to the restless world of cities and 
freeways and polluted skies. The ranch is accessible only by the river, or by 
the Cessna that flies north 150 miles from Boise. The nearest settlement, 
Riggins (with its 500 satisfied souls), is 43 miles downriver. Beyond Riggins 
the road comes to an abrupt end -- 15 miles from the ranch. It is there, at 
Road's End, that guests are picked up by a jet boat that delivers them through 
rapids and dark green waters. 
</P>
<P>
Shepp faces the River of No Return at its confluence with Crooked Creek, so 
there is a rush of water that lulls guests to sleep with its constant song. A 
haunting, roadless country, the area that surrounds Shepp Ranch represents one 
of the last expanses of untouched wilderness in America. Moss-covered logs lie 
in the damp forest; black bears roam the rocky shore; horses graze in the 
pasture and leaves turn with the coming of autumn. 
</P>
<P>
I have been here three days and the dream is nearly over. Soon the Cessna will 
be returning and the experience of having known Shepp will be but a memory that 
began with the flight from Boise. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving that city, we flew above heavily forested mountains and 9,500-foot-high 
peaks over which the little airplane was rocked by thermals. Below, dusty 
logging roads led to forests; dozens of lakes and streams mirrored a morning 
sky the shade of faded denims. Beneath the wing I caught a glimpse of a valley 
as green as Ireland itself. Herds of cattle grazed in peaceful pastures and 
farms appeared on the horizon; and after that there was only wilderness -- mile 
after mile of wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
If one is apprehensive about small airplanes and tight approaches -- 
particularly onto an unpaved runway -- my suggestion is to drive from Boise and 
catch the boat at Road's End. For the aerial approach to Shepp Ranch isn't an 
experience for the faint of heart -- nor one that's easily forgotten. Nearing 
the ranch, pilot Rod Nielsen put the plane into a tight turn and expertly 
sideslipped into the canyon. Rocky walls spun past like a descending curtain 
while the plane dropped toward the river on its final approach. Nielsen banked 
and we came in at near treetop level, touching down to face a scene that would 
have inspired Jack London. 
</P>
<P>
Rising beside a chestnut tree, the lodge at Shepp Ranch is within earshot of 
the Salmon. Guest cabins face the river and others are hidden in the forest, 
where wildlife abounds. Indeed, a couple of years ago a bear was caught 
crawling out a kitchen window, a sack of flour clamped firmly in its jaws. And 
only a few nights ago, while a guest stood studying the stars, a black bear 
ambled out of the trees, peered curiously, then disappeared into the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
Deer graze in the yard, and herds of elk slip out of the forest to raid berry 
bushes. If one is bored by wilderness, cross Shepp Ranch off the list. In this 
unsullied setting, there's not a single disco or boogie bar within miles. 
Instead, guests ride to abandoned mines and trout streams and go rafting and 
fishing on the Salmon, wade into Crooked Creek or laze in the sun on a sand 
bar. At night they read beside wood-burning stoves until the witching hour -- 
which is 11 o'clock -- when the generator supplying electricity is switched off 
till dawn. 
</P>
<P>
With accommodations for only 20 guests, Shepp Ranch caters to the vacationer 
seeking solitude in a setting as peaceful as a fresh dawn. Meals served family 
style are prepared by Gini von Essen, an expatriate of the city who turns out 
barbecued ribs, grilled salmon steaks, trout omelets, home-baked breads, pies 
and cakes, as well as down-home favorites: fried chicken, mashed potatoes, corn 
on the cob, hot biscuits, blueberry and sourdough pancakes and rhubarb muffins. 
</P>
<P>
A physician from Boise was bowled over a couple of years ago when von Essen 
served Yorkshire pudding to a group of hunters. "I couldn't believe it," he 
said -- "here in the wilds of Idaho." 
</P>
<P>
Only the other night, von Essen paraded into the dining room with a platter of 
baked Alaska. Nearly everything she serves is grown on the ranch or taken from 
the river: cherries and apples for the pies, vegetables, salmon and trout. Each 
year, she cans up to 1,000 quarts of apple butter, berries, plums, squash and 
rhubarb. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years ago, when 17-year-old Steve Ruzich summered with his parents 
at Shepp Ranch, he was smitten by the call of the wild. As a result, this year 
he returned to mow lawns, pop corn and help hand-crank ice cream for von Essen, 
the Mother Superior of the kitchen crew. Shepp's simple pleasures have turned 
other lives around as well. After vacationing in this pristine setting, more 
than one guest has taken leave of the cities. 
</P>
<P>
It was through the deep canyon that the Lewis and Clark expedition turned back 
after an unsuccessful struggle to obtain a route to the Pacific. Save for an 
occasional miner's shack, it remains unchanged -- white water boiling among 
rapids and big-horn sheep clinging precariously to perches high above the 
river. Occasionally, thunder rolls through the canyon, colliding with the 
cliffs while rain pours into the gorge and drenches the ranch. Mists rise from 
cataracts, and there are silent pools in which trout 30 feet deep are clearly 
visible. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Shepp, an early prospector, arrived on the Salmon River in 1898 in 
search of gold. Instead he discovered contentment. Joined by another 
prospector, Pete Klinkhammer, Shepp built the still-standing ranch house with 
whip-sawed logs and a determination to remain for the rest of his life. He died 
in his 70s; his sidekick lived to be 90. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an ex-Idaho postal employee, Paul Filer, turned up at the ranch with 
"a mortgage, a prayer and a chunk of bailing wire." Filer built a bridge across 
Crooked Creek, floated 1,000-gallon drums downriver for water storage, felled 
trees with a gasoline-powered chain saw, built cabins and cleared the 
still-unpaved airstrip. After that, ex-nuclear physicist Jim Campbell floated 
by one day on his raft, made his peace with the world, and accepted the 
mortgage from Filer. Alas, Campbell eventually grew restless and said farewell, 
turning over the ranch to Beverly Hills building contractor Paul Resnick. In 
turn, Resnick put a young husband-and-wife team, Mike and Lynn Demerse, in 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Few humans are seen on the river. Miners' cabins lie in ruins. Fences have been 
toppled by storms. With its limited accommodations, Shepp Ranch lures the 
discriminating traveler, the one who seeks out such genteel resorts as Caneel 
Bay in the Caribbean and Stonepine in the Carmel Valley. During my brief 
sojourn at Shepp Ranch, I traded pleasantries with a New York stockbroker, the 
Boise doctor, a couple of university professors and a Beverly Hills businessman 
vacationing with his family. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch takes in 100 acres, an alluvial fan surrounded by hundreds of miles 
of national forest. In springtime, when wild flowers bloom profusely, great 
herds of deer, elk, bear, big-horn sheep and Rocky Mountain goats migrate to 
the river. In the fall, the ranch features steelhead fishing and after that, as 
the days grow shorter, the hunter arrives. Finally, the river freezes over, and 
by December the ranch is deserted except for a pair of caretakers. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, floating down the Salmon, I saw a sign announcing, "Shepp Ranch, the 
Ultimate Western Resort." The scene remained locked in my memory, a flashback 
to a more peaceful period, a brief moment when America was young and the West 
was a challenge to be met with courage. Was it really so inspiring, this 
earlier trip to a near-forgotten yesterday? 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Kingfishers dive for trout and rafters wave as they drift downriver 
toward boiling rapids named Whiplash, Growler and Gun Barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Guests retire to cabins that feature old-fashioned wood-burning stoves and 
barnboard-and-pine walls, beds with comforters and showers with hot water. In 
the evening, the air is redolent with the fragrance of pine and smoke and the 
roar of the river is like a symphony without end. Here, for whatever days one 
may spare, one gladly accepts this world without telephones and other 
distractions. 
</P>
<P>
With all its pluses, the primary appeal of Shepp Ranch is the opportunity to 
duck out on crowded cities and to concentrate on catching a trout . . . or to 
pick berries in the forest . . . or to ride a mule or a horse into a wilderness 
that remains as unspoiled as creation's first dawn. One lies back in a hot tub, 
listening to the cry of coyotes, and while star-gazing wonders: Isn't this how 
all the world should be?

Even the night life of Paris cannot be compared with the night life in Havana," 
sings a 1938 copy of The Blue Guide to Cuba, inviting American visitors on a 
nightlong tour of the casinos, bodegas and round-the-clock cabarets of Cuba's 
fabled Barbary Coast. Those were the days when Cuba was the ultimate tropical 
getaway for many an American pleasure-seeker; the days when Astors and 
Vanderbilts wintered in Havana, and Ava Gardner and Gary Cooper sipped mojitos 
(a rum and fresh mint cocktail) in the Bodeguita del Medio; the days when 
Ernest Hemingway fished for marlin in the 80-degree Gulf Stream and the Duke 
and Duchess of Windsor came to stay at the writer's 15-acre villa in the hills; 
the days, in fact, when the Dodgers used to train in Cuba and Fidel Castro was 
just another hot prospect for the Washington Senators baseball team. For 40 
years -- till 1959 -- Cuba was a haven for every kind of half-forbidden 
pleasure, from jai alai and cockfighting to hoochie-koochie joints, horse races 
and nightclubs where couples danced beneath the mango trees. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard for us to recall today that not so long ago, when George Bush and 
Fidel Castro were bright young men, Cuba was a favorite holiday escape for 
Americans. Yet it was, in a sense, a natural choice. For the Pearl of the 
Caribbean is the largest island in the West Indies, and one of the loveliest; 
it comes blessed with 4,500 miles of coastline, a stylish, sensual, fun-loving 
people and a soft spot for diversions sweet as sugar -- from cigars and rum to 
rumbas and Carnival. Best of all, the island is less than 100 miles from 
American shores. Not so very long ago, Americans needed no passport to visit 
Cuba (today it is technically off-limits), the First National Bank of Boston 
had six branches around the island, and honeymooners brought their cars down on 
the 70-hour steamship ride from New York. The typical holiday-maker could stay 
at hotels called the Manhattan, the New York or the Roosevelt, take care of his 
needs at the Fifth Avenue Shoe Store or the American Photo Studios, and while 
away the nights at Sloppy Joe's or the Infierno Club (which advertised "plenty 
of pretty Cuban and Spanish dancing-girls"). The millionaires simply drifted 
from the Yacht Club to the Biltmore to the Country Club. " 'Have on in Havana' 
seems to have become the winter slogan of the wealthy," wrote Basil Woon in his 
1928 book, "When It's Cocktail Time in Cuba," a breezy guide to the good life 
along the Riviera of the Western Hemisphere. In the good old days, Havana was 
the discerning man's Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, such a happy-go-lucky resort became the site of high-rise dreams. 
"Where there is such marvelous scenery, there must be much from which profit 
can be made," wrote one of the first visitors to the island, Christopher 
Columbus. And with its free-and-easy insouciance, the sunlit island that had 
first drawn Americans as a wet spot during Prohibition began attracting less 
legitimate concerns. Meyer Lansky poured millions of Mafia dollars into hotels 
like the Capri and the Riviera; the Colony Hotel on the Isle of Pines, where 
gangsters ran drugs and girls and gambling, came with its own abortion clinic. 
Havana, you may recall, was the place on which the Corleone family had designs 
in "Godfather II." 
</P>
<P>
All of Cuba, in fact, seemed a fruit ripe for American plucking, and not just 
the capital known as "the City of Beautiful Houses." Irenee du Pont planned to 
turn a 5-mile strip of Varadero Beach into what would have been the largest 
private club in the world; for himself, he built a fabulous winter hideaway, 
Las Americas, complete with 9-hole golf course, white-sand beach and seaplane 
dock. The club's interior was opulent with marble, mahogany and cedar; its 
electric organ could be heard a mile away. And all around the dining-room in 
his fantasy retreat, he hung tapestries telling the tale of Kubla Khan and his 
"stately pleasure-dome" in Xanadu. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Las Americas is a place of ghosts, its carpets frayed, its antiques 
thick with dust. The other mansions along Varadero Beach stand desolate as 
beached old galleons, and the beaches themselves are empty save for a handful 
of Russian and Bulgarian tourists. What was once the Hilton is now the Habana 
Libre. Yet much of Cuba remains almost the way it was, in an eerie state of 
suspended animation. The jazz bands are still playing Desi Arnaz standards in 
the cabaret at the Capri, where Frank Sinatra once performed, and young boys 
still gun their skeletal wrought-iron elevators up and down the creaky old 
Hotel Nacional. Vintage Plymouth and Packard roadsters still judder past 
Polynesian restaurants that were once the coming thing; bikinied mulattas still 
shake their stuff at the Tropicana nightclub. For those who knew Cuba once upon 
a time, the gradual dereliction of its tail-fin glamour must make a melancholy 
sight; but for those seeing the island today, stuck in time, it remains a 
beautiful surprise, its air of romance only deepened by the relics of its age 
of vanished elegance.

GROWING RANUNCULUS LIKE THE PROS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Roger's Gardens in Corona del Mar grows picture-perfect flowers, and none are 
prettier than the ranunculus blooms it features every spring. Kathleen Sommer, 
Roger's horticulturist, offers advice on how to duplicate their show. 
</P>
<P>
Tubers: Start with the finest-quality jumbo tubers available. Don't settle for 
tiny rejects sold at discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
Soil Preparation: Work the soil well, to a depth of at least 10 inches. Add 
Bulb Booster, a high-phosphorus fertilizer. (We formerly used bone meal, but it 
works too slowly and is low in nutrients.) 
</P>
<P>
Planting: Place the tubers close together, with the head up and toes down. For 
maximum effect, plant as close as two inches apart. Barely cover them with 
soil. Water sparingly until growth starts. 
</P>
<P>
Feeding: Fertilize with a liquid fertilizer, such as Roger's Flower Food 
(20-22-13) every two weeks while the plants are growing vigorously. 
</P>
<P>
Post-bloom: Discard the tubers. Ranunculus tubers generally perform poorly the 
second year, although some gardeners are successful in naturlizing them in 
summer-dry gardens. Mary Ellen Guffey

LAWYERS GUILTY OF TRYING SURROGATE CASE IN MEDIA; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: ATTORNEYS IN THE ANNA L. JOHNSON CASE HAVE DRAWN THE PRESS INTO THE 
BATTLE TO AN EXTREME DEGREE.

<P>
It was once a golden rule for lawyers: Don't try your case in the press. 
</P>
<P>
But that already tarnished code has been blackened further by attorneys on both 
sides of the Anna L. Johnson surrogate mother case. Indeed the media -- often 
accused of exploiting courtroom drama to sell newspapers or boost ratings -- 
have been drawn intimately and uncomfortably into this legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers contacted the press even before the first court document was filed by 
Johnson, who seeks to keep the baby she was hired to bear for his genetic 
parents, Mark and Crispina Calvert. Attorneys have given dueling interviews to 
waiting TV cameras almost daily -- while each side accuses the other of 
publicity-mongering. One lawyer accompanied Johnson onto The Donahue Show. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the courtroom, Johnson has been grilled about what she told Phil Donahue 
and what happened to the money she was paid to appear on the show. Judge 
Richard N. Parslow Jr. has chided the lawyers for grandstanding, and has asked 
his wife and clerk to monitor the media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Calverts' lawyers forced the Los Angeles Times reporter covering 
the case to testify -- and Johnson's attorneys then sought to bar the reporter 
from the courtroom on the grounds that she was a witness. 
</P>
<P>
Several legal experts interviewed last week suggested that when the judge 
issues his decision Monday, only the lawyers will win. 
</P>
<P>
"Big law firms pay handsome fees to marketing and media consultants to go out 
and tell them how to get their name in the limelight," one attorney said. "Name 
recognition! It could be beneficial down the road." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers and judges in other highly publicized court cases declined to comment 
publicly on the media habits of their brethren in the Johnson case. "Oh God, I 
don't want to be sued," said one prominent Los Angeles attorney, who then 
begged not to be quoted by name. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether you win the big case or lose the big case, what people remember is 
that you were big enough to be in the big case," said another legal veteran, 
whose own career skyrocketed even though he lost a star-studded trial. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the old Hollywood line: Say anything you want about me, as long as you 
spell my name right," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates for the baby boy, however, aren't so sure. They fear the exposure may 
traumatize the month-old child, whom Johnson calls Matthew and the Calverts 
call Christopher Michael. 
</P>
<P>
"The child's right to privacy has been compromised by this three-ring circus," 
said William G. Steiner, the guardian appointed by the court to represent the 
baby, on the day that three dozen reporters, photographers and producers showed 
up in Orange County Superior Court to find out which "parents" would be allowed 
to take the baby home from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have lawyers more interested in publicity than in this child, it's 
absolutely unforgivable," said the baby's attorney, Harold LaFlamme. "The one 
thing that surprises me right now is that they haven't sold tickets." 
</P>
<P>
Fearing such exploitation, Judge Parslow ordered the parties not to release 
photographs of the child or take him places where he could be photographed. The 
order did not bar the media from scrambling to get a picture if they could, 
however. And the media did just that, with a mob of photographers surrounding 
the infant as he was carried from the hospital. The Times also ran on Page 1 an 
exclusive picture of the newborn bundle arriving at the Calverts' home, further 
inflaming the coverage war. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for The Orange County Register and The Times objected to the judge's 
order limiting access to the baby. They argued that the beleaguered Calverts 
might be forced to put blankets over their windows, creating an "unnatural 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
"What might possibly be unnatural is not leaving people alone in certain 
situations," Parslow retorted. "Maybe people could back off just a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
The judge ultimately allowed a single photographer to take the baby's picture 
and distribute it to other media, and the newborn bundle was duly splashed 
across television screens and newspapers, including The Times, which ran the 
image on Page B1 of the Orange County edition. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's case is considered precedent-setting because she is the first 
surrogate mother to seek parental rights to a baby to whom she is not 
genetically linked. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was conceived in a petri dish from the Calverts' egg and sperm, then 
implanted in Johnson's womb. Mark Calvert testified that Johnson had promised 
to be an "incubator" for $10,000. But Johnson, backed by "Baby M" surrogate 
mother Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould and other opponents of surrogacy contracts, 
said she grew attached to the baby as she carried him. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for both sides maintain that the media -- and hence the public -- 
should be informed about the psychological, ethical and legal questions raised 
by this new biotechnological feat. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to know everything we can about it so we can stop it," said Johnson's 
attorney, Richard C. Gilbert of Gilbert &amp; Marlowe in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have much preferred to have privacy and anonymity," said the 
Calverts' attorney, Christian R. Van Deusen, of Van Deusen Youmans &amp; 
Walmsley of Santa Ana. "One of the reasons my clients felt that they had to 
speak out was because of the outrageous accusations made against them. . . . If 
you don't say 'Wait a minute, that's not true,' it amounts to a tacit 
admission, so you have to speak out." 
</P>
<P>
In interviews Friday, Gilbert said he and his client have been misquoted and 
had their remarks distorted by the press. But both he and Johnson stand by 
their decision to take their case to the national media. 
</P>
<P>
"The media have been very helpful to me," Johnson testified last week. "If it 
wasn't for them, I wouldn't have gotten world-renowned witnesses" to testify on 
her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert said Johnson had turned to the media in desperation, hoping that at 
least the publicity would allow the child to track her down later if he so 
desired. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a mother who was going to lose her child and have her child taken away 
from her forever. . . ," Gilbert said. "So she laid bread crumbs in the park so 
that the baby could eventually find his way back to his mother, Anna Johnson. 
And those bread crumbs are now laid coast to coast, continent to continent and 
around the world." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the Calverts, however, have attempted to imply that Johnson's 
willingness to use the media to publicize her case demonstrates that she is an 
unfit mother. They subpoenaed Johnson's former roommate, who testified that 
Johnson's quest to keep the baby was motivated by a desire for money and 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Both Gilbert and Van Deusen said their careers are sufficiently established not 
to require further promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the media itself did little introspection about its role in the case 
until Times reporter Catherine Gewertz was forced to testify about damaging 
statements published after an August interview with Johnson. Gewertz had quoted 
Johnson as saying that she was not bonded to the baby, and Johnson later denied 
having made the remark. 
</P>
<P>
The Calverts' lawyers called Gewertz to the witness stand, and the reporter 
confirmed the remark. Gilbert tried unsuccessfully to have Gewertz barred from 
the courtroom since she was a witness in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert said Friday that the Times should have assigned another reporter to the 
case as soon as Gewertz was subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's not appropriate," said Gilbert. "How can Gewertz or any 
journalist continue to maintain their objectivity when they know that they are 
going to be testifying and their credibility will be challenged?" 
</P>
<P>
"That sounds to me from afar like a lawyer grandstanding," said Tom Goldstein, 
dean of UC Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism. "If what (Gilbert) said 
was the case, then you could basically shut down courtrooms to reporters by 
having them subpoenaed." 
</P>
<P>
Other attorneys called for comment on media coverage of the case, however, said 
the real problem with media coverage of "big" court cases such as Johnson's is 
the tendency of reporters to rely on material gathered on the courthouse steps 
instead of inside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
This practice is especially common in television, and in cases when reporters 
or cameras are barred from the courtroom. But sources said the practice allows 
and even encourages lawyers to try their cases on national television. 
</P>
<P>
"When somebody goes out on the courthouse steps, what they're giving you is not 
a fact, it's their own opinion . . . and you guys should really be reporting 
the facts," said Robert J. Perry, who prosecuted former auto maker John Z. 
DeLorean on cocaine charges and is now a partner at Epstein Becker Mulkeen 
&amp; Green in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason the media is easily manipulated is it's faster and easier to have 
someone else -- particularly a participant -- to summarize the events for you. 
And that is the blurring of fact and opinion that perverts the content of the 
reporting." 
</P>
<P>
If legal maneuvering is so complex that reporters do need help in interpreting 
events, Perry said, they would do better to get a "quickie opinion" from an 
objective third party than from the attorneys trying the case. 
</P>
<P>
The DeLorean case was considered a milestone in media coverage of trials 
because DeLorean's defense attorney, Howard L. Weitzman, gave press conferences 
on the courthouse steps while prosecutors refrained from comment. DeLorean was 
acquitted, and Perry now says the prosecution eered in believing the jury would 
not be influenced by the publicity -- though the government might have lost 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Weitzman was known and respected in Los Angeles before the DeLorean case, but 
now he's "a household word" in legal circles, according to a prominent judge. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief telephone interview, Weitzman, a partner at Wyman Bautzer Kuchel 
&amp; Silbert in Los Angeles, said he believes there is nothing wrong with a 
lawyer trying to correct public misperceptions about his client. 
</P>
<P>
"I do think it's inappropriate to get personal with the other side, and I do 
think it's inappropriate to try one's case in the media," Weitzman said, 
defining the latter as presenting facts to the press before they are introduced 
in court. 
</P>
<P>
"What I have real trouble with is creating the media interest," said Weitzman, 
who said he would not send out a press release about a case before it is filed. 
Weitzman said the media were drawn to the DeLorean case because the auto maker 
was already a celebrity. "The lawyer should not be generating the publicity, 
the lawyer should be responding to the media's and the public's need" for 
information. 
</P>
<P>
When lawyers do take their case to the press, it is usually to counter damage 
done by police, prosecutors or the other side, or to prevent their clients from 
winning the court case but losing in the court of public opinion. Sometimes it 
is a veiled attempt to influence a jury. 
</P>
<P>
In the Johnson case, the ultimate audience isn't listening. Judge Parslow, who 
will decide without a jury whether Johnson has parental rights, has tuned out 
news reports to avoid being influenced, according to his clerk, Marci Dambert. 
</P>
<P>
Dambert is assigned to monitor the coverage to make sure that what is said 
inside the judge's chambers is not misrepresented to the press in the 
courthouse hall. She jokes that she's getting scheduling tips from the papers. 
</P>
<P>
"The lawyers have had a tendency to notify the press before they notified us on 
what their next move was," Dambert said. "We were the last to know." 
</P>
<P>
To some, the relaxation of rules against lawyer advertising makes the old 
notion that it is unseemly for a lawyer to give interviews seem almost quaint. 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, for example, Life magazine sent a reporter to profile an up-and-coming 
New York law firm, trailing its young partners and charting the bar's 
mysteries. The firm did not solicit the piece but agreed to cooperate, and the 
results were "flattering," said Harry F. Weyher, of Olwine, Connelly, Chase, 
O'Donnell &amp; Weyher in New York. 
</P>
<P>
But the article caused "an uproar" at the New York Bar Assn., and in 1963 the 
firm was censured, Weyher said. Today, the law is much more commercial, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very undignified, and it really does not help the correct 
resolution of disputes," Weyher said.

Campground Closures -- O'Neill Regional Park in Trabuco Canyon will be closing 
two of its three campgrounds at the end of this month in anticipation of the 
slower winter season. That will leave 60 campsites available, ranger supervisor 
Richard Dyer said, adding that structures in the closed areas will be treated 
to some much-needed maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time to come out (to the park)," Dyer said. "It's not hot anymore, 
and it's not crowded." 
</P>
<P>
For those looking for fall foliage, he added, the park's liquidambar and 
sycamore trees offer an array of colors from yellow to gold to brown. 
</P>
<P>
No campgrounds will be closed during the winter at the county's other two 
regional camping parks, Ronald W. Caspers Regional Park east of San Juan 
Capistrano and Featherly Park in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
There are 52 individual and six group campsites available at Caspers 
year-round, as well as 30 equestrian sites. Park technician Russell Greene 
noted that the park is restricted to people over 18. 
</P>
<P>
There are 120 campsites available at Featherly Park on a year-round basis. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental Symposium -- Endangered habitats will be the theme of the 
Southern California Botanists' 16th annual symposium at Cal State Fullerton on 
Saturday. Topics will include the management of rare plants and rare plant 
habitats in California state parks and the California Nature Conservancy's 
Habitat Restoration Program. Registration begins at 8 a.m. at the Ruby 
Gerontology Center on campus. Registration is $10 to $15. For more information, 
contact Diana Cosandat at (714) 773-3548.

Q: What is the city of Laguna Beach buying? 
</P>
<P>
A: The Laguna Beach City Council has agreed to purchase from the Irvine Co. 
2,150 acres of Laguna Canyon land for $78 million, effectively halting the 
company's plans to build a 3,200-unit development on the untouched countryside. 
The land is located between the city of Irvine, the residential community of 
Leisure World and the city of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why do Laguna Beach officials and some environmentalists feel it is 
important to buy the land? 
</P>
<P>
A: It is considered one of the last undeveloped coastal canyons between Malibu 
and the Mexican border. Environmentalists battled for more than 10 years to 
keep the land in its natural state and protect it from suburban sprawl. 
Supporters argue that as Orange County becomes increasingly urban, it is 
important preserve what little land is left in its natural state. 
</P>
<P>
Local artists held "paint-ins" to protest the destruction of the natural 
scenery, picketers stood outside the Newport Beach home of Irvine Co. Chairman 
Donald Bren, and almost 8,000 people marched through the canyon last year as a 
show of support to keep the canyon as a wilderness area. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How will the city pay for the land? 
</P>
<P>
A: The $78 million purchase price will be paid out in annual installments over 
a five-year period, with the first payment -- $33 million -- due June 30 of 
next year. A $20 million bond measure on the Laguna Beach ballot Nov. 6, 
Measure H, is expected to anchor the first payment. A two-thirds vote is needed 
for passage of the bond issue, which would raise property taxes by 6 1/2 cents 
per $100 assessed valuation. 
</P>
<P>
The city is also planning to raise $2 million from the sale of bonds that would 
be backed by parking meter revenues, spend $4 million of state open space land 
acquisition funds already appropriated to the city, and use the first $2 
million of $10 million Orange County has pledged. 
</P>
<P>
Funding sources have not been identified for the final $2 million due the first 
year, although city officials said they would seek private donations and 
additional state park grants. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How will the land be used? 
</P>
<P>
A: Members of the Laguna Laurel Advisory Group, which negotiated the land 
purchase, plan to reconvene after the bond election to decide how the land will 
be used and which governmental agency will manage it. Members say the county 
and state may share responsibility for managing the property as a regional park 
that would be kept in its natural state. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is expected to consider options such as whether to construct 
overnight campgrounds, picnic areas or public restrooms. Michael Phillips, 
executive director of the Laguna Greenbelt Inc. and the Laguna Canyon 
Conservancy, said a hike-and-bike trail probably will be included in the plans, 
but motorcycles will not be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not purchased to be the kind of park like Disneyland or Knotts Berry 
Farm," Laguna Beach City Councilman Robert F. Gentry said. "It was purchased as 
a park that has tremendous importance as open space, for wilderness and natural 
habitat." 
</P>
<P>
Q: How quickly will the city receive the land? 
</P>
<P>
A: Under the 5-year buy-out plan, the city can acquire 85% of the property in 
the first year. That includes most of the environmentally sensitive land on the 
west side of Laguna Canyon Road. At the end of the third year, when the 
payments reach $40 million, the city will have possession of all the property 
on the west side of Laguna Canyon Road. The city has the option of paying $40 
million the first year. 
</P>
<P>
The primary lake on the property -- located on the eastern side of Laguna 
Canyon Road -- will be turned over to the city in the fourth year, with the 
balance of the land to be released by the developer when the final payment is 
made. Under the agreement, if the city defaults on its payments, it keeps land 
purchased to that point but the company has the right to proceed with 
development on the remaining property. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When will the park open? 
</P>
<P>
A: "If we can make some arrangements with the county to manage it, it's 
probable that by the fall of 1991 there could be some use of the property," 
said City Manager Kenneth Frank. He added that among the issues still to be 
decided is whether to construct parking spaces to facilitate public access into 
the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What kind of wildlife and vegetation is now on the land? 
</P>
<P>
A: In addition to the cattle that have grazed on the land for nearly a century, 
the canyon's rolling hills are home to a number of rare and endangered plants, 
animals and birds. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons that it (the canyon) is so valuable is that it has a 
mixture of a large number of habitats," said Elisabeth Brown, a biologist and 
president of Laguna Greenbelt, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain lions have been spotted in the canyon, which is also home to coyotes, 
bobcats, skunks, the California black-tailed gnat catcher, the San Diego coast 
horned lizard and other species. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal sage scrub found on the land is becoming endangered due to the large 
amount of development in Southern California, she added, and oak and sycamore 
trees are almost non-existent on the flat lands where grazing cattle have 
devoured the seedlings. "We have a lot of nice old trees, but not a lot of new 
ones," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Laurel property also includes the only three natural lakes in Orange 
County, although two of them have been dry in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Will the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor tollway still be built, 
cutting through the property? 
</P>
<P>
A: "Absolutely," said Donna Stubbs, a spokeswoman for the Orange County 
Transportation Corridor Agencies, who added that groundbreaking is planned for 
late next year. But city officials are on record as opposing the six-lane 
tollway scheduled for construction along the southern edge of the Laguna Laurel 
property. 
</P>
<P>
The tollway was excluded from negotiations to purchase the land with the 
intention of dealing with it separately after the bond election. Laguna 
Councilman Bob Gentry said the city is expected to re-evaluate its position to 
determine whether or how to continue its opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Laurel Advisory Group consultant Paul Freeman also suggested that the 
successful negotiating process that was employed to save Laguna Canyon may be 
used to resolve the tollway issue. "If it's ever built, it's not going to be 
the concrete monstrosity that was first proposed," Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What does he mean it won't be a "concrete monstrosity?" Won't the 
transportation corridor adversely affect the environmentally sensitive land? 
</P>
<P>
A: Stubbs said the corridor is expected to curve around hills rather than go 
through them, and a bridge will probably cross over Laguna Canyon Road to 
minimize the impact on the road. Deer will also be tagged in order to monitor 
their movement so that wildlife crossings can be provided at points where they 
will be used. And if fossils are found, Stubbs said work would be halted until 
paleontologists can study the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plant and Wildlife Treasures Found in the Canyon 
</P>
<P>
Elderberry, live oak and sycamore trees are found on the hillsides. In the 
flatlands, new shoots have been devoured by cattle or have been unable to 
survive because of the drought. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's only natural lakes are also on the property although two of the 
three are dry. The smaller one has been overtaken by eucalyptus. The largest, 
once stocked with catfish and carp, has been polluted by water runoff from 
Leisure World and from manure. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal sage, which is becoming endangered because of all the development in 
Southern California, covers the land and provides shelter for birds and two 
species of rare lizard including the San Diego coast horned lizard. Also found 
in the sage scrub are wood rats and the California black-tailed gnat catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Coyotes and bobcats have made the canyon their home. Historically, mountain 
lions have been sighted in the canyon, although only a couple have been seen in 
recent years.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: DISTANT RELATIONS SUDDENLY FEEL CLOSE

<TEXT>
<P>
We've come so far, so fast. 
</P>
<P>
Remember only a few years ago when citizen diplomats to the Soviet Union feared 
they would be arrested for talking too long with Intourist guides, or for 
leaving books or blue jeans? 
</P>
<P>
Or remember when a visit to Orange County by a Soviet, any Soviet, was cause 
for a full-length feature story? When we took them to the South Coast Plaza, 
recorded the dropping of their jaws, quoted them on the virtues of freedom, 
etc.? 
</P>
<P>
Now, Soviets have their own Big Macs. They have Robert Schuller on prime-time 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
Now, an ordinary Irvine businessmen -- who doesn't even speak Russian -- can go 
to Moscow, build an American hotel and trade center, appear on a talk show, 
meet a teen-age Soviet beauty -- who barely speaks English -- and bring her 
back home with him. 
</P>
<P>
And here she is: Miss Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Mariya Masha Kalinina contradicts every lingering stereotype of 
olive-gray, overweight socialism. Like her country, she is lurching toward the 
future, looking around wide-eyed at what capitalism might do for her. 
</P>
<P>
The first beauty queen in the history of the Soviet state, she has embraced a 
notion that is already waning here: that a beauty contest title can springboard 
a young woman to other possibilities. In her case, it may lead to a career in 
acting or modeling. At least an education in broadcast journalism. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe a lot of hype. 
</P>
<P>
We first heard about her when her host, local businessman Paul Tatum, called to 
tell us what he had done and who she was. 
</P>
<P>
We met in Tatum's Irvine office, a semi high-rise decorated inside with 
abstract prints and impermanent-looking furniture. 
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old was sitting in a conference room, surrounded by middle-aged 
executives. The men apparently had nothing better to do than peruse her 
European high-fashion model portfolio and some T-shirts she had made herself. A 
blond woman sat off to the side, silent, smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a bright red, British-made suit with a black velvet collar, Mariya 
raised her 5-foot, 10-inch frame to shake hands and flash an amazingly wide and 
friendly smile. Here was someone we supposed only existed in toy stores. 
Russian Barbie, in person. 
</P>
<P>
And enthusiastic. She answered most questions "Oh, yes," even if they were not 
quite understood and needed to be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
We talk about how the company has sponsored her trip, how maybe she will, in 
some vague ways, bring them some publicity. 
</P>
<P>
So where is she staying, we ask. The replies come from everywhere and say 
nothing, until Tatum, his blondish hair sticking up in the current fashion, 
finally answers, "She is staying with me." 
</P>
<P>
A romance? No, no, nothing like that. "She calls me Papa." 
</P>
<P>
He schedules her itinerary, down to her workouts at his gym. 
</P>
<P>
Where is this story going? To the gym. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by a cavernous glass and metal building filled with equipment and 
staring men, Mariya is oblivious. 
</P>
<P>
The shop presents Mariya with a free outfit and a personal trainer named 
Chance. She does some exercises, we take pictures. We make sure the gym people 
know we're not promising anything here. 
</P>
<P>
The men are awe-struck. One man, tanned and wrinkled, comments she sure looks 
better than the "silicone jobs" he usually sees at the gym. 
</P>
<P>
We leave. But, before, Mariya wonders if maybe we shouldn't say she is staying 
with Paul, people probably wouldn't understand, and maybe we should say she is 
staying with somebody else, a woman. 
</P>
<P>
Does she think this is Pravda? 
</P>
<P>
The day the story ran, small and inside, I get a call from another businessman. 
He knows a young man, not himself, who could help Mariya learn English. Maybe I 
could put them in touch. 
</P>
<P>
 I get another call from an executive at Tatum's company. He says Mariya will 
be staying with families of other employees. 
</P>
<P>
What a country. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, I interviewed a psychotherapist who was taking citizen 
diplomats to the Soviet Union. The travelers were so fearful that the leaders 
held group therapy sessions in Czechoslovakia to prepare them to meet real 
Soviets. Now I wonder if maybe it's the Soviets who could use help. After 
they've met us.

DANCE MARATHON PART OF UCI'S 25TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION

Stephanie St. John should not have been feeling so well. 
</P>
<P>
Bouncing on her heels and toes, the junior college student thrust her hips and 
bobbed her head so that her long ponytail swung from side to side. 
</P>
<P>
Normal gyrations for any college student dancing to M.C. Hammer's "U Can't 
Touch This," until you consider that she and 11 other students were in the 14th 
hour of a 25-hour marathon dance as part of the UC Irvine's 25th anniversary 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"You know how when runners talk about hitting the wall and then they can keep 
running? That's how we feel," St. John's partner, Becky Baer, said. "We hit the 
wall at about 10 this morning. We can do anything now." 
</P>
<P>
St. John and Baer were one of 10 couples who had pledged to rock around the 
clock, till broad daylight -- and into the next night -- as part of the student 
center's weekend-long activities to celebrate UCI's birthday and also to help 
raise money for a new truck for the campus recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
Other weekend activities included a dinner Friday evening honoring the 
college's founders, including heiress Joan Irvine Smith, former Gov. Edmund G. 
(Pat) Brown Sr., and former UC President Clark Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Jack W. Peltason, who attended the marathon dance Friday and 
Saturday, said Smith promised she would soon be making a large financial 
contribution to the school. However, she did not state how much she would be 
donating, Peltason said. 
</P>
<P>
The student center festival included a casino game room, a centerfold contest 
and a Hula-Hoop contest. 
</P>
<P>
But the big attraction was the marathon dance with a grand prize package that 
included free tuition, course books and a parking permit for one semester 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the dancers said they entered the contest for the fun and the 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"There were points where we thought our feet were going to fall off," said Loyd 
Calomay, a junior electrical engineering student. 
</P>
<P>
Still, no matter how they were feeling, the dancers said that the faster the 
music, the more energized they became. 
</P>
<P>
Marathon organizers had planned to play music from each year the campus has 
been open -- beginning with 1965 and ending Saturday evening with current hits. 
</P>
<P>
But the low point for many dancers began three hours into the dance, which 
started at 10 p.m. Friday, when the disc jockeys began playing music of the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"It was OK until they got to Neil Diamond. I guess some people didn't like 
those songs because they really aren't very good dance songs," said Craig 
Stockwell, a student who volunteered as a judge. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't dance disco," said dancer Gale Goneroso, a sophomore electrical 
engineering student. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hell," Baer added. 
</P>
<P>
From that point on, current recordings were mixed in with the oldies, 
satisfying most of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Gustavo Molina, one of the more animated dancers on the floor, said he 
protested after a rap song with explicit lyrics was played twice. 
</P>
<P>
Because contest rules require dancers to keep moving to the beat of the music, 
Molina said he demonstrated his protest by slowing down his pace and swaying 
from side to side. 
</P>
<P>
"I do all things for my Lord, Jesus Christ, who strengthens me," he said as he 
tirelessly bounced from one end of the dance floor to the other. 
</P>
<P>
Not having raised too many pledge donations before the dance, the senior 
physics student said he was not in it to win -- only to have fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked about six girls before I found her," Molina said, pointing to partner 
Susan Bradford. "She doesn't want to say anything because she knows I don't 
want to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Nine hours after the marathon began, three couples dropped out of the contest. 
An hour later, another couple left the dance floor, leaving six couples 
promising to rock until they dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Couples were required to take seven 10-minute recesses throughout the marathon 
and were allowed three additional five-minute breaks. Any extra breaks cost the 
dancers five points each, and no breaks were allowed during the final hour. 
</P>
<P>
They were given opportunities to earn bonus points prior to the event by making 
publicity posters and raising money through pledges.

LOCAL ELECTIONS: NEWPORT CITY COUNCIL RACE; 
</P>
<P>
NOISE FROM AIRPORT STILL THE MAIN ISSUE 
</P>

<P>
Two years ago, Councilman Clarence J. Turner, the president of the county's 
Airport Working Group, passed out a memorandum to his colleagues on the City 
Council who were running for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
The memo spelled out some of the obstacles that the city faced in resolving the 
issue of noise at John Wayne Airport, and Turner said he wanted his colleagues 
to be sure they weren't making promises the city couldn't keep. 
</P>
<P>
"You might think that was really presumptuous of me," Turner recalled in a 
recent interview. "But I thought it was important that people know. Since then, 
things haven't really changed." 
</P>
<P>
Additional flights that increase noise at the airport is one of the issues most 
often asked of candidates running for four seats on the City Council in the 
Nov. 6 election. The airport issue hits close to home for residents, who are 
quick to point out that noise at John Wayne Airport lowers property values and 
mars the peace of their beachfront community. 
</P>
<P>
In the race for the District 1 council seat, in which three-term incumbent 
Donald A. Strauss is being challenged by political newcomer John Hedges, the 
debate has been over support for an alternate airport site. Hedges argues that 
his job as a pilot for Northwest Airlines gives him the technical expertise to 
evaluate expansion at John Wayne Airport. He advocates a variety of alternative 
sites, including George Air Force Base, in order to reduce demand at John 
Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
Strauss, however, maintains that an alternate site ought to be in Orange 
County. He says that the ideal solution would be joint civilian and military 
use of El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, though he admits such shared usage 
would be difficult to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Evelyn R. Hart, the incumbent being challenged in the District 3 
race by resident Jan Vandersloot, also says that the airport noise issue is a 
top priority for the council. She says her role in various county groups, such 
as the League of Cities, gives her a regional perspective on solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always said that if there is anything that could destroy the quality of 
life in Newport, it is the airport," Hart said. "That's why we take it as 
seriously as we do." 
</P>
<P>
In his plan to reduce noise and restrict airport expansion, Vandersloot says he 
would push for annexation of Santa Ana Heights, in order to limit the county's 
eminent domain in the area. He would also work on the county level for more 
transit access to Los Angeles International, and he says that both George and 
Norton Air Force bases should be looked at to ease air traffic at John Wayne 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is to deflect demand," Vandersloot said. "There has to be 
a regional plan, and John Wayne is unfortunately going to be part of that plan. 
But John Wayne should just be a regional airport and not be used as a long-haul 
airport." 
</P>
<P>
Turner, the incumbent in District 4, and Phil Sansone, the incumbent in 
District 6, are both running unopposed for their seats. 
</P>
<P>
On other issues, challengers Vandersloot and Hedges both advocate a mandatory 
two-term limit for council members. 
</P>
<P>
Hedges not only has questioned Strauss' extended tenure on the council but has 
also denounced the councilman for alleged inaction on the peninsula's problem 
with weekend cruisers. Traffic and weekend parking congestion continue to be 
hot issues. 
</P>
<P>
Among the solutions that Hedges advocates is an increase in the number of 
officers on the city police force, creation of a bicycle patrol unit for the 
peninsula, and formation of a task force to preempt problems with gangs that 
visit the area. 
</P>
<P>
Strauss maintains that the city has acted to control cruising, and that the 
council continues to examine alternative solutions. The councilman says that a 
two-term limit on council members is unnecessary, since voters who disagree 
with the council can always vote against the incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
In the District 3 race, Vandersloot and Hart have debated the protection of 
view corridors from public parks. Hart says preservation of open space and the 
quality of life has been a primary emphasis of her tenure on the council. 
</P>
<P>
But Vandersloot, who says that he was asked to run for the council by the 
leadership of the Newport Heights Community Assn., questions Hart's record on 
public parks and says that with the redevelopment plans for Mariner's Mile set 
to come before the council in the next year, it is important that the District 
3 representative vigorously enforce height and density limitations in the area, 
which runs along Coast Highway from Bayside Drive to the Arches Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Vandersloot has also backed a plan to resurrect the Newport Trolley, a seaside 
transit system which ran from the Fashion Island areas to the more popular 
tourist spots. The trolley folded in 1987 because of lack of funds. Vandersloot 
has proposed that fees from encroachment permits be used to subsidize the 
trolley, thus increasing public access to the beach, while cutting back on 
traffic and congestion. 
</P>

HOME SPRINKLER COSTS SPARK DEBATE; 
</P>
<P>
FIRE SAFETY: PRICES FOR INSTALLATION IN RAPID- GROWTH AREAS VARY. BUILDERS ARE 
OFFERING THE GREATEST OPPOSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The toughest opposition to residential fire sprinklers is from developers who 
are building homes in rapidly growing cities, where sprinkler costs would be 
multiplied by thousands of homes. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates for installing sprinklers in new homes range from 70 cents to $1.25 
per square foot for tract homes, said Steve Hart, director of the Fire 
Sprinkler Advisory Board of Southern California, an industry promotion group. A 
custom home with a cathedral ceiling could soar as high as $2.50 a square foot. 
</P>
<P>
The price tag can increase sharply in areas where water districts assess extra 
charges for sprinkler systems. Costs also vary with other local requirements, 
house size and design. 
</P>
<P>
Builders also add their markup, and they usually like to get at least 10%, said 
Gary Emsiek, Homes by Polygon's vice president for planning. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkler advocates argue that the cost is only 1% of a home's price -- often 
less than the cost of carpeting. In a relatively affordable area like Fontana, 
it costs about $2,000 for a 2,000-square-foot tract house. However, for 
somebody building a custom home, the total could be a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
A client of home designer Wayne Holden ended up with a $6,400 bill for a 
sprinkler system in his 4,000-square-foot Encinitas home. Plans, fees and 
hardware cost $5,900, and another $500 was a San Dieguito Water District charge 
for a larger water meter needed for the system. 
</P>
<P>
Costs at other districts vary considerably. The Olivenhain Municipal Water 
District, which serves other parts of Encinitas, charges $2,850 for the larger 
meter because of potential extra water use, said assistant manager David 
McCollom. 
</P>
<P>
Fontana Water Co. doesn't charge for the larger meter itself, but residents 
with 1-inch meters pay about $4 a month more than those in unsprinklered houses 
with five-eighths-inch meters, said secretary Norma Manning. 
</P>
<P>
Holden said the extra cost is what really bothers him about sprinklers, and 
homeowner's insurance discounts for the systems don't begin to offset the cost. 
</P>
<P>
He also points out that with a smoldering fire in a bed or sofa, the room 
temperature might not get high enough to trigger a sprinkler before a person 
succumbs to toxic smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why smoke detectors are absolutely essential," as well as sprinklers, 
Fullerton Fire Chief Ron Coleman said. Unfortunately, even when homes have 
smoke detectors, they often aren't working, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners forget to check sprinklers and sometimes paint over them. Even 
without human interference, sprinklers can't always control a fire, National 
Assn. of Home Builders (NAHB) spokesman Richard Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few situations a home-sprinkler system can't handle, such as an 
explosion that could damage it or create a fire too large to handle, said Capt. 
Ronald Hayton of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Arsonists and brush 
fires are others. 
</P>
<P>
Systems are designed to have only enough force for one or two heads to go off 
at one time, which in most cases is enough to control a fire because the 
sprinklers activate while the fire is still small. Small rooms usually have one 
sprinkler, while a living room might need two. 
</P>
<P>
How the sprinklers look in those rooms is one of homeowners' biggest concerns. 
Today's models come in a variety of styles and "designer colors," and are 
inconspicuous enough that some people don't know they have them, said Glendale 
Fire Department's Christopher R. Gray, battalion chief and fire marshal. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkler heads usually protrude an inch or less from the ceiling, although 
some are recessed or concealed. 
</P>
<P>
But even more than looks, homeowners' biggest worry about the sprinklers is 
whether they will go off accidentally and drench the house. That's unlikely -- 
the heads' failure rate is 1 in 16 million, said Robert Hagar, director of 
sales for Fire Chief Inc., a sprinkler installer. 
</P>
<P>
They are not triggered by smoke, so unlike smoke detectors, which can go off at 
a whiff of overdone toast, sprinklers don't respond until the temperature 
reaches a certain level (usually 160 to 165 degrees), which melts solder that 
holds back the water. The heads respond independently, so if one activates, it 
doesn't set off the rest. 
</P>
<P>
However, they're not perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were to tell you they never had a leak I'd be lying," Hagar said. But out 
of nearly 8,000 systems the Fontana company has put in, perhaps a dozen had 
problems, Hagar said, and those were covered by guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente residents were guinea pigs for early home sprinklers, but those 
systems are still working, Begnell said. Problems he's aware of include about 
1,000 drippy sprinkler heads that were replaced by the manufacturer several 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Builders provide instructions for the systems, which need little maintenance 
but should be checked occasionally. Most problems are from human error in 
installation or upkeep, fire officials said, and sprinkler systems are often 
more reliable than regular plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
But Holden said some people fear water damage so much that they have disabled 
their systems, which is a misdemeanor in most cities. "Sprinklers cause less 
damage than fire hoses," Fire Chief Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
Once on, systems have to be turned off manually, even if the fire is out. The 
used sprinkler head is then replaced and the water turned back on. Most systems 
cannot be turned off without shutting off water to the rest of the house, to 
help ensure that residents use the sprinklers. They also have alarms to notify 
neighbors and residents that a sprinkler is on. 
</P>
<P>
The alarm woke Don and Diane Tibbetts to a fire in the room of their 7-year-old 
son, Jeff, in February, 1988. The fire was caused by a heating pad that 
eventually ignited the bed. 
</P>
<P>
A sprinkler stopped the fire early enough that damage was only $800. Tibbetts, 
who was irked at having to spend an extra $2,000 when he built the house in 
1986, now can't praise sprinklers enough. "I wouldn't have a house without 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tibbettses live in the Agua Dulce area near Lancaster, a part of Los 
Angeles County where sprinklers are used when homes are built too far from 
hydrants or have difficult access. 
</P>
<P>
In places where sprinklers aren't required, they are often an option -- cities 
may allow developers to save money by requiring fewer fire hydrants when 
sprinklers are installed or reducing other safety features. 
</P>
<P>
But some cities are reluctant to cut back on anything, even when they require 
sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
Building industry officials said they haven't seen many such trade-offs. 
Certainly not enough to offset the cost of sprinkler systems and higher 
insurance rates for builders because of potential water damage, said Bart 
Doyle, general counsel of the Building Industry Assn. of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
In apartment buildings, being able to eliminate extra exits and other 
requirements might save enough to pay for the sprinklers, but there's not much 
to cut back on single-family homes, NAHB's Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
Some Southern California cities require all new buildings -- not just homes -- 
to have sprinklers. Others require sprinklers only in certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Stanton requires that new houses more than 3,600 square feet 
and new apartments with more than two units have sprinklers. Placentia requires 
sprinklers in new single-family homes and apartments with three units or more, 
which covers virtually everything. 
</P>
<P>
In Riverside, only homes more than five minutes from a fire station must have 
sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
Holden said the homes that really need sprinklers are older ones. Instead of 
discriminating against new homeowners, officials should be more concerned about 
existing houses. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 5% of fires occur in homes less than 10 years old, Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
That's because there are more older homes, said Chief Robert La Marsh of the 
Encinitas Fire Protection District. "We have to start somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Trying to make owners of existing homes add sprinklers is an issue nobody wants 
to touch. That would be "political suicide," said Andy Rodriguez, Moreno 
Valley's building and safety director and fire marshal. 
</P>
<P>
Or, as the BIA's Doyle put it, "homeowners vote -- future homeowners don't 
vote." 
</P>
<P>
Installing sprinklers in an existing home costs 50% to 100% more than putting 
them in during construction. Rodriguez said such a requirement would be hard to 
enforce, and some people couldn't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
So, as much as fire officials would like to see them in all homes, they're 
concentrating now on getting them for new housing. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Fire Department is urging its 14 contract cities to require 
sprinklers, and also wants county supervisors to mandate them for 
unincorporated areas. Several cities have done so. But Villa Park and Yorba 
Linda decided it was up to homeowners if they want sprinklers, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman said firefighters need to do a better job of persuading homeowners that 
sprinklers can protect their lives and property. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
REMODELING MIGHT REQUIRE HOME SPRINKLERS 
</P>
<P>
In some cities, a major remodeling job could mean that homeowners would have to 
add sprinklers to their existing residence and the new area. 
</P>
<P>
In San Clemente, for example, three situations can trigger that requirement: 
</P>
<P>
* A second story added to a house. 
</P>
<P>
* An addition that is more than 50% of the house's existing square footage. 
</P>
<P>
* An addition of 750 square feet or more, regardless of the size of the house. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities base their remodeling retrofit requirements either on the square 
footage added or whether the cost represents a specified percentage of the 
home's assessed value. And once a house has sprinklers, additions usually must 
have them too.

RANUNCULUS DISPLAY THEIR MARVELOUS BEAUTY EACH SPRING. PLANTED FROM BULBS IN 
FALL, THEY DO BEST IN MILD, COOL CLIMATES.; 
</P>
<P>
SPRINGTIME SHOWOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ELLEN GUFFEY, Guffey has been writing Times gardening articles for 10 
years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They have no common name, but everyone recognizes these flowers when they burst 
into bloom in the spring. Easily the most magnificent of all our fall-planted 
bulbs, ranunculus blossoms are to the Southland what tulips are to cold-climate 
gardeners. 
</P>
<P>
More publicity is given to tulips -- even here in the Southland where tulips 
are notoriously poor performers. Veteran gardeners, however, ignore the tulip 
hoopla and bulb displays in garden centers. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they head straight for brown, claw-like ranunculus tubers because they 
know that these weirdly curved claws will produce crepe-paper blossoms coveted 
by gardeners and bouquet makers throughout the flower world. 
</P>
<P>
Ranunculus flowers can be cultivated only in mild, cool climates such as 
coastal Southern California. Small wonder, then, that the world's largest 
grower is located on rolling hills along the coast in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
With more than 100 acres planted in ranunculus, the Carlsbad fields produce 90% 
of this country's ranunculus supply and over 60% of the world's crop. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Frazee, a third-generation grower, and his family have been growing flowers 
in the Carlsbad area for more than 60 years. Although the flower crops are 
rotated, the ranunculus fields are usually visible from Interstate 5 in March 
and April, attracting thousands of flower lovers, photographers and sightseers 
every year. 
</P>
<P>
The sandy soil and foggy climate create ideal growing conditions. But another 
important factor contributes to the worldwide reputation of the Carlsbad tubers 
-- the development of the Tecolote strain. 
</P>
<P>
Through purposeful selection, the Frazee family and its marketing/research 
partner, Davids &amp; Royston Bulb Co., have developed a strain that sets the 
world standard for quality ranunculus. Tecolote tubers yield double-rose 
flowers with layers of petals as thick as feathers on parakeets. No other 
grower has been able to duplicate this form or achieve the consistent quality 
of the Carlsbad production. 
</P>
<P>
Ranunculus tubers are susceptible to soil-borne fungi, so commercial growers 
propagate them from seed. Because seed-grown flowers don't always produce 
offspring identical to the parents, quality control is an extremely important 
task. 
</P>
<P>
One special section of the fields is devoted to stock plants, the creme de la 
creme of the millions of ranunculus tubers grown there. Divided by color and 
separated by plastic panels to prevent unwanted cross-pollination, these stock 
plants grow under the watchful eye of Arnold Ellis, research and development 
director for Davids &amp; Royston. 
</P>
<P>
Cruising the rows of magnificent blooms, Ellis yanks out seemingly perfect 
plants for a variety of innocent faults: color variation, semi-double form 
instead of fully double, irregular foliage, imperfect shape, small size. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm intensely concerned with upgrading the strain," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
His most recent research has concentrated on development of a new salmon color. 
Ready for introduction in 1991, this color range will include salmons, pinks 
and orange pastels. Because ranunculus plants are not clones of their parents 
(like tulips and other vegetatively propagated flowers), the colors vary, 
representing a range of colors. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring Ellis watches over the seed plants zealously. 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest problem," he said, "is the theft of plants and flowers at night -- 
apparently by flower industry people." 
</P>
<P>
Security guards now patrol the fields at night, but visitors are allowed to 
explore selected areas during the day. As many as 20,000 visit on spring 
weekends, taking pictures and stopping to buy bouquets at the corner flower 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
Besides producing tubers, the Carlsbad ranunculus fields now provide cut 
flowers that are shipped around the world. But the future is somewhat cloudy. 
Frazee looks across his blooming fields at elegant homes and rapidly spreading 
condominium projects and wonders how much longer his flowers will be able to 
occupy this prime real estate.

SPEAKING OUT: SOUTHLAND REAL ESTATE: DID WE LEARN OUR LESSON?

<P>
The paralysis in Southern California real estate markets reminds me of a 
classic scene in Laurel and Hardy movies. After each new mishap, Ollie looks 
helplessly at Stanley, throws his hands in the air and says, "Well, this is 
another fine mess you've gotten me into." 
</P>
<P>
That same conversation might just as easily be had today by a real estate 
lender meeting with a hapless developer who once again finds himself struggling 
to stay afloat in falling markets. 
</P>
<P>
The malaise hanging over the real estate industry nationally has touched even 
Southern California, once considered impermeable to recessions plaguing other 
parts of the country. While our population continues to grow rapidly in the 
Southland, new home building and other urgently needed development have come to 
a virtual standstill. 
</P>
<P>
We face parallel dilemmas. 
</P>
<P>
After years of banking industry deregulation, the pendulum has swung again to 
the opposite extreme. Federal regulators have levied rules of such strictness 
on banks and thrift institutions that capital for new development is virtually 
unavailable. Real estate lending is the financial community's "bad boy." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, we face a paralysis in regional leadership required to 
confront the reality of growing populations and declining public services in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The LA 2000 Committee put forth an ambitious vision for the Los Angeles 
metropolitan area as a world finance and cultural center -- a model city of the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
Is that vision now threatened by our inability to provide for the growth needed 
to support economic health? Does Southern California face the same fate as New 
York, Texas or Arizona, where collapsing real estate markets were harbingers of 
wider economic problems? 
</P>
<P>
I don't think so. But to avoid repeating the past, we must understand how we 
arrived at our present difficulties. The roots can be easily traced. In fact, 
we are today paying penance for the sins of the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
The genesis of our problems springs from events in the late 1970s, years of 
"stagflation." Economic growth was flat, interest rates were high and inflation 
was running out of control. 
</P>
<P>
As that decade ended, the government took two fateful steps intended to 
stimulate the economy. Congress passed the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 -- 
a law which ushered in a flood of tax-sheltered real estate investments. 
Investors reaped 4-to-1 tax writeoffs. Real estate projects were financed 
regardless of whether they made economic sense. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, deregulation of financial institutions opened up vast new 
sources of funding for speculative real estate projects. 
</P>
<P>
Savings and loans suddenly were able to form subsidiaries owning a smorgasbord 
of assets ranging from fast-food chains to real estate companies. 
</P>
<P>
The world looked rosy for real estate in Southern California. The Reagan 
Administration's kitchen cabinet had cooked up a host of initiatives intended 
to correct the legacy of the previous administration. 
</P>
<P>
In the pendulum's swing back, however, the most severe overbuilding in the 
country's history took place. Syndications and limited partnerships went wild 
with tax-sheltered investment funds pouring into the marketplace. Wall Street 
was booming, and limited partnerships raised billions for new development. 
</P>
<P>
The initial ripple of concern came with the collapse of oil prices in the early 
1980s. The first savings and loans to go under were located in the country's 
Energy Belt, auguring the financial hemorrhage of the thrift industry that 
would take place by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, excessive abuses in tax shelters led to a new tax act, legislation 
dedicated to simplifying the tax code -- a 954-page document that still defies 
complete understanding. 
</P>
<P>
Tax shelters for real estate investment were eliminated. Syndications and 
limited partnerships died almost overnight. Declines in real estate in the 
Energy Belt spread to the Northeast by 1987. 
</P>
<P>
And the multibillion-dollar bailout of the thrift industry was in full swing by 
the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the sins of the past need correction. But we have now entered a period 
of over-regulation that may be offering a cure just as destructive as the 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
Twin forces have forced financial institutions to curb real estate lending: 
shareholders and regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street and other investment analysts who value bank stocks have generally 
concluded that real estate debt is an albatross around the neck of 
institutions. Banks have put as much distance between themselves and real 
estate lending as possible. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, strict new capital requirements under the Financial Institutions 
Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) are forcing banks to limit real 
estate lending. Banks are fearful of triggering regulatory review with respect 
to outstanding real estate loans. 
</P>
<P>
Capital for real estate markets has been squeezed to a standstill as a result. 
And some of Southern California's oldest and most successful home builders, as 
a result, could go broke because banks will no longer make new loans or "roll 
over" existing loans. 
</P>
<P>
Other sources of capital also are threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese investors have been largely responsible for maintaining liquidity in 
the U.S. real estate industry in the last two years with the demise of the 
thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
A full 25% of home building in Southern California last year was financed by 
Japanese financial institutions or joint venture partners. Now that money is 
diminishing. The public reaction in the United States against Japanese real 
estate investment has caused them to look more carefully at Europe and other 
overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the trillion-dollar decline in the Tokyo Stock Exchange this year 
alone -- which has been exacerbated by the Middle East crisis and rising oil 
prices -- means there is less capital available from Japan than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
And the rise in Japan's discount rate brings their yields closer to those in 
the United States, thus making it more likely that Japanese investors will keep 
their funds onshore. 
</P>
<P>
What we have in Southern California is a volatile situation that doesn't lend 
itself to easy correction. In an area with a gross national product larger than 
all but 10 countries in the world, it's not surprising that many diverse 
organizations and groups seek to serve the special interests of their 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
In a 60-mile radius from downtown Los Angeles, it is possible to cross five 
counties and 90 cities. Redistricting at the county level adds further 
confusion regarding these divisions. And, the federal government imposes an 
additional agenda in its oversight through the Air Quality Management District. 
Meanwhile, economic sanctions against new growth are forcing Southern 
California developers to leave the state for better-performing markets such as 
Las Vegas and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of this diversity, what is urgently needed today is a more unified 
approach to planning that cross bipartisan lines and addresses the complex 
problems of overlapping jurisdictions. Strong political leadership is 
essential. We need a forum to deal with economic issues that affect not only 
Southern California cities and counties, but the welfare of the state as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
While we have limited influence over federal regulatory policy, we do have some 
control of our destiny at the state and local level. With a new governor taking 
office, the early months of the new year are an excellent time to launch a 
state initiative evaluating growth policies. 
</P>
<P>
"Summit" meetings involving mayors, local council members, state legislators 
and others offer an opportunity for a "meeting of the minds" on these issues. 
Cooperation and consensus must be sought to stave off further declines in the 
economy and job losses. 
</P>
<P>
Job growth in all industries is required to absorb the oversupply of real 
estate in all sectors -- office, industrial, manufacturing, and research and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
But what tax incentives should be offered to attract new companies and keep 
others from relocating in areas with lower costs of living, particularly 
housing? 
</P>
<P>
While home prices have dropped somewhat in the past few months, affordable 
housing continues to be one of Southern California's most pressing problems. 
New policies relaxing growth controls to stimulate home building -- not 
restrain it -- are required. More bond issues are needed to pay for 
infrastructure such as roads and sewers. 
</P>
<P>
And, we need to find a balance between assuring clean air under Air Quality 
Management District programs and maintaining the competitiveness of Southern 
California as a commercial center. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, cuts in the defense industry mean that a wealth of 
intellectual and technical capabilities must be redeployed. Grants to stimulate 
research and development may be one key in that deployment. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the vision of the LA 2000 Committee for the Los Angeles. Will we 
move toward this vision of Los Angeles as a center of the Pacific Rim, 
marshaling the intellectual and financial resources of the region? Or will we 
become snarled in our own debate over growth as the regional economy stagnates? 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the sins of the past should give us the tools to avoid repeating 
them. But it will also take cooperation at local, regional and state levels to 
put forth the policies needed to avoid the fate of cities such as Boston and 
Phoenix, where programs billed as economic "miracles" ended in disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has a superb position economically and geographically. It is this 
base that we must build on with a coherent effort to support job growth and new 
development so that our children's future will be as promising as what we have 
enjoyed.

CONDO Q &amp; A: ASSOCIATION BOARD HAS THE DUTY TO FIX ERRORS, OMISSIONS IN 
MINUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

chapter of the Community Associations Institute (CAI), a national nonprofit 
research and educational organization.

QUESTION: The secretary of our association board was absent at a recent board 
meeting. The vice president acted as the secretary. 
</P>
<P>
When the board received copies of the meeting minutes, they found that most of 
the business that had been conducted at the meeting was not noted in the 
minutes. Many of the items were incorrect. The minutes were signed by the 
secretary who had been absent from the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
What is the liability of the board members who accepted these minutes at the 
subsequent board meeting? Is it proper for a secretary to prepare and sign 
minutes of a board meeting that he or she did not attend? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Board members have a duty to see that minutes are true and correct. The 
minutes that are approved at a subsequent meeting are the official record of 
the association. 
</P>
<P>
Robert's Rules of Order, the manual of parliamentary procedure that most 
associations rely upon, says that the approved minutes may be corrected or 
amended regardless of the amount of time that has elapsed, so it is still 
possible for the board to correct the errors. 
</P>
<P>
I always recommend that the name and signature of the person who took the 
meeting notes and wrote the minutes appear at the end, for example, "Submitted 
by John Doe, vice president, in the absence of the secretary." 
</P>
<P>
After approval, the minutes should be dated and signed by two officers, usually 
the president and the secretary. The signatures of the secretary and president 
affirm that the minutes were approved as written. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, I do not feel that it is improper for the secretary's name to appear 
on these minutes that someone else prepared. 
</P>
<P>
Agenda Should State All Items of Meeting 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can a proxy be used at a homeowner association annual meeting for voting on 
any issue other than the items stated on the agenda? 
</P>
<P>
During our association's annual meeting, the subject of assessing owners for 
the cost of painting was introduced. The president stated that he could use the 
proxy votes to approve or disapprove a painting assessment. Is this legal? 
</P>
<P>
A: The annual meeting agenda should state any items that will be voted upon at 
the meeting. In my opinion, it is improper to vote on any additional matters. 
</P>
<P>
It is permissible for the painting assessment issue to be brought up during 
discussion, but the vote should have been postponed until all owners could be 
informed. 
</P>
<P>
Remember that in California the association's board of directors has the 
authority to approve special assessments without a vote of the membership 
unless the special assessment exceeds 5% of the current annual assessment. 
</P>
<P>
If the painting assessment is less than 5% , the vote at the annual meeting was 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
Special Assessment by Board Protested 
</P>
<P>
Q: In 1983, our homeowner association passed an amendment that states that a 
special assessment greater than $100 per unit per calendar year must be 
approved by at least 51% of the total membership. 
</P>
<P>
The board recently approved a special assessment of $155 per unit without a 
vote of the membership. The purpose that the money will be used for is not an 
emergency. The association has $100,000 in the reserve fund. Can the 
association legally approve this special assessment? 
</P>
<P>
A: The California Civil Code supersedes the amendment that you describe. 
However, the code states that if the special assessment is greater than 5% of 
the current annual assessment, then the membership should have voted on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
The association has $100,000 in the reserve fund but you haven't told me 
whether a reserve study has been done. Perhaps $100,000 is far below the amount 
needed for maintenance and repair. Obviously, the board of directors feels that 
the current reserve fund is inadequate, so they approved a special assessment. 
</P>
<P>
I doubt if the board would have voted for it without thorough discussion and 
study. Board members do not like passing special assessments because they know 
that they may be criticized for improper budgeting in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
From the information that you have given me, I would say that the board 
deserves your support for increasing the reserves before an emergency arises. 
If a reserve study has not been distributed to all the owners, then you have 
the right to question the board's action. 
</P>
<P>
California law requires homeowner associations to prepare a reserve study that 
identifies the major common area components and the cost of future repair and 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Clarifying Terms of Office for Directors 
</P>
<P>
Q: I would like to comment on your answer to a question regarding the term of 
office for directors. which appeared in your column on Sept. 23. Effective Jan. 
1, 1980, the California Nonprofit Corporations Code specifies a maximum term of 
three years for directors of membership corporations. 
</P>
<P>
A: The headline for the question that you cite, "No Laws to Restrict Term of 
Directors" was misleading. 
</P>
<P>
The current Nonprofit Corporations Code states that the term of office for 
directors, not longer than four years, shall be as stated in the association's 
articles or bylaws. 
</P>
<P>
However, I am not aware of any law that limits the number of terms that a 
director may serve. In other words, when a board member's term is expiring, he 
or she may run for office and be elected for another term. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if an association has two-year terms of office for directors, a 
director could be elected for three consecutive terms and serve for a total of 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
By limiting the term of office to the number of years stated in the bylaws or a 
maximum of four years, the law requires that a director be re-elected by the 
membership in order to serve beyond the initial term of office. 
</P>
<P>
Some associations have bylaws that limit the number of terms that a director 
may serve, but this is not typical of most of the bylaws that I have read. 
</P>

NEGATIVE-AMORTIZATION STIRS UNEASE;

<P>
DEBT: WITH PROPERTY VALUES FLAT AND PAY RAISES MODEST, BALANCES ON SOME ARMS 
KEEP GROWING DESPITE PAYMENTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Many lending experts have always been wary of "negative-amortization" 
mortgages, those home loans that can grow bigger -- not smaller -- with every 
monthly payment that you make. 
</P>
<P>
But now some of those experts seem downright scared about these offbeat 
mortgages because property values are flattening out and borrowers' incomes 
aren't rising much. 
</P>
<P>
"Prices aren't going up like they were a few years ago, and people are getting 
pretty small pay increases," said Bruce Norman of Diamond Bar-based First 
Mortgage Corp., a mortgage banking company that doesn't make 
negative-amortization loans. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't depend on property appreciation to bail you out of a bad loan 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Added Tom Gau, a partner in the Torrance-based financial-planning firm of 
Kavesh &amp; Gau: "A lot of people have negative-amortization loans and don't 
even know it. They might be in for some nasty surprises." 
</P>
<P>
Most fixed-rate loans don't have the potential to negatively amortize, but many 
adjustable-rate mortgages do. It usually occurs when a "rate cap" or "payment 
cap" prevents the lender from raising your monthly payment fast enough to keep 
up with rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate how negative amortization works, let's say that you took out a 
30-year, $100,000 ARM with a starting rate of 9%. Your monthly payments for 
principal and interest would total about $805. 
</P>
<P>
Say that one year later, rates have zoomed to 13%, but a clause in your 
original loan documents prevents the lender from raising your monthly payment 
by more than 7.5%. Your new payment would be limited to $865 -- about $241 
short of the amount that would be needed to fully amortize the loan at the new 
13% rate. 
</P>
<P>
The shortfall would be added to the outstanding balance of your loan, meaning 
that you'd owe more money, not less, with each passing month. 
</P>
<P>
Financial planner Gau said negative-amortization loans aren't so dangerous when 
property values are soaring, borrowers are getting big pay increases or both. 
That's because your equity is building or your paycheck is growing at a much 
faster rate than your loan balance is rising. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that now prices are flattening out and pay increases are 
generally small," he said. "The outstanding balance (of negative-amortization 
loans) is rising a lot faster than most people's home values and incomes." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are some benefits to loans that have the potential of negative 
amortization. 
</P>
<P>
First, the low introductory rate that most of these loans carry make the 
mortgages easier to get. You don't have to earn as much because your beginning 
payments will be relatively low. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, most lenders who make the loans offer their borrowers an option to 
pay a little bit extra each month to avoid having the loan negatively amortize. 
It's much like the way that credit card vendors work: You can make the minimum 
payment that's due, or you can pay more to reduce your finance charges. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that these loans benefit consumers," said Richard H. Deihl, chairman 
and chief executive of lending giant Home Savings of America. "If the borrower 
has a little extra cash, he can make a little larger payment and avoid having 
the loan negatively amortize. 
</P>
<P>
"But if the borrower gets into a financial bind, he can just make the minimum 
payment until his cash-flow situation improves. He wouldn't have that 
flexibility if he took out a fixed-rate loan with fixed monthly payments."

YOUR MORTGAGE; 
</P>
<P>
FIGURING OUT MATH OF ACCELERATED PAYMENTS

QUESTION: In a recent column about accelerating principal payments on a 
mortgage for five years, you made much of the fact that, after that time, the 
family that had accelerated walked off with far more equity than did the other 
family that didn't accelerate. 
</P>
<P>
What you didn't mention, though, was that the seller who did not accelerate 
had, during the five years mentioned, the use of the money, and assuming it was 
invested where the money earning a rate of interest equal to the interest rate 
on the mortgage, in this case 10%, he would come out exactly the same. 
</P>
<P>
While his equity in the home would be less, he would have an equal amount of 
equity somewhere else and, in addition, he would have liquidity, which the 
first party would not have. You also failed to indicate that while interest 
payments would be lower, so would the tax deductions. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Ah, yes, here we go again on the old high-leverage/low-leverage 
merry-go-round. 
</P>
<P>
Should we pay as little in down payment on a house as possible and keep the 
monthly payments to a minimum, or should we make a large down payment and 
accelerate principal payments as much as possible to build up a large equity 
and sharply reduce the interest being paid the lender? 
</P>
<P>
And the argument against acceleration is that the money not used for this 
acceleration can be invested more profitably in something that more than 
offsets the savings in interest. 
</P>
<P>
It always makes for a lively debate, and while I have always been pretty noisy 
in advocating fast acceleration it's also true that I'm not enough of a 
computer whiz to prove my contention in hard figures. 
</P>
<P>
Quite recently, however, an ally has appeared in the form of Colorado-based 
management consultant, M. Joseph Lockerd who has a fascinating book in the 
works entitled: "The Myth of the Mortgage Tax Advantage: Spending a Dollar to 
Save a Dime." 
</P>
<P>
Lockerd has run the invest-versus-acceleration question off in virtually every 
conceivable way on his computer. The conclusion: Except in a handful of 
freakish situations, mortgage-principal acceleration is a far better investment 
than anything else available to the layman. The intervening lack of liquidity 
notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
It's a study that takes clearly into account both the reduction in 
mortgage-interest deductibility that one incurs in accelerating a payoff, but 
also the tax consequences of those investments that are made with the money 
that would otherwise go into acceleration. 
</P>
<P>
One frequently overlooked point: By accelerating the payoff of a 30-year 
mortgage down to 10 or 15 years, the homeowner has a mortgage-free 15 or 20 
years ahead of him in which to further compound his investment program. To an 
extent that that his invest-in-something-else counterpart -- still burdened 
with his monthly mortgage payments -- can't begin to approach. 
</P>
<P>
Time-Share and Taxes: Is Interest Deductible? 
</P>
<P>
Q: Recently, my wife and a friend each purchased a one-half ownership in a 
time-share in Mexico. The total contract balance is $5,000 and they plan to 
occupy the unit for 30 days every year. My question: Can the interest on the 
contract be fully deducted, the same as mortgage interest, or is it treated as 
ordinary personal interest and subject to being phased out? 
</P>
<P>
A: Depends on a couple of tricky things, the Internal Revenue Service tells me. 
For one thing, to be deductible in the same way that mortgage interest is, it 
has to be a "deeded" time-share -- one in which you are actually buying your 
share of the property and can rent it, sell it or pass it on to your heirs. 
</P>
<P>
If it's a non-deeded time-share, however, all you're buying is a "right to use" 
the unit for X number of years, after which it reverts to the developer -- and 
the interest isn't deductible. 
</P>
<P>
The other fly in the ointment is that if you already have one "vacation home" 
somewhere on which you are deducting the mortgage interest, then that's it -- 
the time-share won't qualify. 
</P>
<P>
I might add, too, that most if not all Mexican time-shares with which I am 
familiar are strictly non-deeded. Mexican law prohibits conventional land 
ownership by foreigners along its coast line -- which is where most time- 
shares are located.

REMODELER'S DIARY: AT LONG LAST: YES, YOU CAN GO HOME AGAIN

"We're moving back in on Friday," my husband said. 
</P>
<P>
Well, I thought, it has finally happened. The stress of these last six months 
has overcome him and he has snapped. 
</P>
<P>
After all, our house had no finished floors -- where were we supposed to put 
our furniture? And no power -- how were we going to keep food cold? And no 
window coverings -- what about privacy? And a gate was missing -- what were we 
going to do with the dog? 
</P>
<P>
But he scheduled the move and breathed down the contractor's neck, and sure 
enough, a flurry of work occurred and the house was "substantially complete" 
only two weeks later than had been promised. And we did move in that Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Substantial completion is contract language for "you can live in it if you 
really want to." It is not the same thing as completion. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a slide show from when we moved back into our newly remodeled house. 
</P>
<P>
Whish-click. 
</P>
<P>
This is my husband happily unpacking dishes in his beloved kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Whish-click. 
</P>
<P>
And here we are throwing dishwater out the front window because the garbage 
disposal doesn't work and the sink is clogged. Fortunately, the construction 
workers have lost the screen for this window, so it's no problem. 
</P>
<P>
Whish-click. 
</P>
<P>
This is me, getting ready to do the first load of wash in our new laundry room. 
</P>
<P>
Whish-click. 
</P>
<P>
And this is "Hans" the contractor, explaining that no gas line was ever run to 
the laundry room, so the dryer won't dry. 
</P>
<P>
Whish-click. 
</P>
<P>
That's the spa tub in our new master bathroom. My husband and I are trying it 
out for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Whish-click. 
</P>
<P>
Here he is two minutes later, dripping and wrapped in a towel, looking at the 
place where the water came gushing out into the yard when the Jacuzzi drained 
it from the tub. 
</P>
<P>
Whish-click. 
</P>
<P>
This is us in June with our 2-year-old and our 2-week-old, patting ourselves on 
the back for having found a contractor who brought the project in just about on 
time and just about on budget. 
</P>
<P>
Whish-click. 
</P>
<P>
And here we are in August with our 3-year-old and our 3-month-old, going over 
the punch list of things that still have to be done before Hans gets his final 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
But what the heck. We're home. 
</P>
<P>
Home is now a three-bedroom, two-bath house in Mar Vista -- transformed from 
the 1940 two-bedroom, one-bath we bought four years ago. And the remodel that 
began a year and a half ago when we first met with an architect is almost, 
almost done. But for some reason, getting the last parts of the project 
finished is proving to be a long, arduous process. 
</P>
<P>
Take our painters. Please. 
</P>
<P>
The first painter-to-be was a painter-decorator from Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, for heaven sake. The master-planned community where the highest law is 
the CC&amp;R. 
</P>
<P>
"So?" asked my husband. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what the houses look like in Irvine?" I said. "All the other houses 
in Irvine." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Irvine approved of our painting the house a nice yuppie gray, but he 
thought the trim should be white because the rain gutters come in white, and 
painted rain gutters tend to need frequent repainting. 
</P>
<P>
"So we should paint our trim to match the rain gutters?" I said. "Uh, isn't 
that a little backward?" 
</P>
<P>
We decided to stick with our original plan, which was to paint the trim green, 
and paint the rain gutters to match the trim. We didn't want our house to look 
like the product of some developer's cookie-cutter plan. But willful 
nonconformity was apparently more than the painter could take. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Irvine stalled for most of a week, then told Hans that if we weren't going 
to paint our house the way he wanted us to, he didn't want the job. 
</P>
<P>
Well, la-di-da. 
</P>
<P>
The next painting sub had a more pragmatic approach. We told him what colors we 
wanted and asked: "What do you think? Will that work?" He smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"If you like it," he said, "I love it." 
</P>
<P>
What began as a $100,000-max remodel is ending up costing more like $148,000. 
</P>
<P>
Where has all the money gone? 
</P>
<P>
The contract itself seemed close enough for comfort when we had carved out some 
not-absolutely-necessary details to bring a $142,000 bid down to $109,000. But 
homeowners do not remodel by contract alone. 
</P>
<P>
There was also the architect, who did a terrific job of rethinking our entire 
floor plan to create a good family home that still looks like it belongs in our 
neighborhood. High ceilings and lots of windows make it feel larger than its 
1,600 square feet. He came highly recommended by friends, and was well worth 
the $16,000 we paid him. 
</P>
<P>
Some significant expenses were outside the contract: light fixtures ($1,100), 
carpeting ($1,400), blinds ($950), a new concrete driveway ($3,700), 
landscaping ($2,000 so far, and we haven't touched the front yard), apartment 
rent and utilities during construction ($5,500), an engineering consultant's 
plan review before construction ($750) and permits for the house and driveway 
($1,500). Extra tile work and other changes in mid-project raised the 
contractor's bill by about $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
It adds up. 
</P>
<P>
Where is it all coming from? 
</P>
<P>
We began by refinancing our house, which gave us about $92,000 to play with -- 
not nearly enough. Before we were done, we had drained our savings accounts, 
cashed in an IRA, sold what little stock we had and gratefully accepted the 
generous gifts of our parents. 
</P>
<P>
We also set up a $25,000 home-equity credit line. Still a candidate for 
liquidation is a silk prayer rug from Kashmir, and we are beginning to eye our 
3-year-old's college savings account. 
</P>
<P>
We hatched other money-raising schemes, real L.A. stuff. My husband got himself 
on "Jeopardy!" (earning a lovely parting gift), and we signed our firstborn son 
with a theatrical agent (five interviews and no jobs so far). For my part, I 
worked extra days and did all the free-lancing I could (reliable income, but 
not a very quick way to get rich). 
</P>
<P>
What's left to pay is the 5% "retention" we withheld from each payment to Hans 
as insurance that final details will be taken care of. We decided against a 
slowness penalty because we didn't want to encourage the contractor to try and 
plaster over mistakes; if they happened, we wanted them fixed. 
</P>
<P>
Now that we are in the house and no particular deadline looms, we've noticed a 
pattern to the pace at which things are getting finished. 
</P>
<P>
Each week, the fellows my son calls 'struction workers show up and do half of 
what's left to do. The next week, they do half of what's left. Then half of 
what's left. And so on. At this rate, Hans may be around to see my sons go off 
to college. 
</P>
<P>
Exasperated, my husband asked him one day: "Nothing personal, but what do I 
have to do to get you out of my life?" 
</P>
<P>
Hans didn't even have to think about it. "Write me a check and I'm outta here," 
he said. "That's easy." Then he laughed. 
</P>
<P>
I think I'll miss Hans if we ever really do see the end of this project. 
</P>
<P>
What remains are truly minor things: Some window screens are missing, some 
paint needs touching up, some small electrical and plumbing things need to be 
done to satisfy the city building inspector. None of it was enough to keep us 
out of our house. 
</P>
<P>
We've learned that with a little luck and a lot of determination, you can go 
home again. And we did.

ARBOR IN GARDEN WITHOUT STICKER SHOCK; 
</P>
<P>
PROJECT: BASING THE DESIGN ON A $2,000 MODEL, ONE CAN BE BUILT FOR JUST THE 
COST OF MATERIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
I built a climbing rose arbor (shown in this week's sketch) out of desperation. 
My wife had just purchased a pair of Blaze climbing roses, and she needed 
something for them to climb on. She looked in lumberyards, garden centers and 
mail order gardening catalogues. Anything under $200 looked like a product of a 
sixth-grade shop class. 
</P>
<P>
Finally she discovered an arbor she liked, but the asking price -- $2,000 
installed -- gave new meaning to the term sticker shock. The only solution was 
to build one myself. It's based on the $2,000 design, but it cost about 1/20th 
of that to build. 
</P>
<P>
To build it, all you do is make a pair of stretcher-shaped frames. Into each 
frame you insert a piece of ready-made lattice. 
</P>
<P>
Join the two frames with a pair of arches sawed from ordinary pine, and "plant" 
the whole thing in four holes in your garden. 
</P>
<P>
To make the frames, you'll need five 8-foot, pressure-treated 2-by-4s. I bought 
one 4-by-8 foot piece of lattice and cut it to size, but some lumber yards sell 
it in 2-foot widths. If you can find the 2-foot wide lattice, it will simplify 
your cutting. 
</P>
<P>
For the arches you'll need about 40 feet of 1-by-8 pine, plus 12 feet of round 
closet pole. Everything goes together with waterproof glue and nails. For the 
glue, use construction adhesive, sold in caulking gun cartridges. For screws, 
use plated Phillips flat heads. You'll need about 30 of these 1 1/4 inches 
long, and another 30 at 3 inches long. 
</P>
<P>
The frames. Use four of your 2-by-4s for the posts, and cut the fifth one into 
2-foot lengths for the crosspieces. At the top of each post, cut a notch or 
"rabbet" three-quarter inch deep and 6 inches long. These rabbets will match up 
with four stubs on the arch forming a lap joint (see sketch). 
</P>
<P>
Fasten the main frame parts together as shown with adhesive and a pair of 
3-inch screws at each joint. Then cut your lattice into two pieces measuring 25 
by 60 inches. Use a circular saw with a cheap blade for this. You will probably 
hit a few staples as you cut, and there's no point in ruining a good blade. Be 
sure to wear eye protection. 
</P>
<P>
Set the lattice into the frames and secure it with three-quarter-inch strips of 
wood ripped off the edges of your pine boards. You could also use 
three-quarter-inch quarter-round molding for this job. 
</P>
<P>
The arches. These are made by cutting arced segments out of your pine and 
laminating them together in two layers. The best way to do this is to cut a 
semicircular pattern out of heavy cardboard or scrap plywood. I made a simple 
compass for this purpose out of a thin strip of wood about 26 inches long. To 
do this, drill a small hole about an inch from one end of the stick. Measure up 
20 inches from this hole and drill another hole. Then drill a third hole 23 1/2 
inches from the first. 
</P>
<P>
You now have a simple beam compass that will draw the inside and outside curves 
of your arch. Place the compass on your cardboard or plywood and tap a nail 
through the solitary hole. This will be the center pivot. Now slip a pencil 
into the 20-inch hole and draw the inside curve of your arch. Slip the pencil 
into the 23 1/2-inch hole and repeat to draw the outside curve. Cut it out and 
your pattern is complete. 
</P>
<P>
Use this pattern to lay out arched segments from your pine stock. Cut these out 
and laminate them together using adhesive and your 1 1/4-inch screws. Stagger 
the joints between segments so they don't overlay. And extend the ends of the 
inside layer of each arch 6 inches to create the stubs that will mate up with 
the 6-inch rabbets in the tops of the arbor frames. 
</P>
<P>
Next, join the two arches together with five equally spaced lengths of closet 
pole. You can either simply cut these 24 inches long and fasten with screws, 
or, drill three-quarter-inch deep sockets for them in the inner faces of the 
arches. Then glue and screw them in place. If you take this route, don't forget 
to cut the poles 25 1/2 inches long. 
</P>
<P>
Final assembly. This is easiest with the arbor on its side. Place the two 
frames on edge, 40 inches apart. To hold the frames in position, tack a couple 
of strips of wood from one frame to the other. Apply adhesive to all four 
rabbets, then set the arch in position and secure with one screw at each joint. 
</P>
<P>
Check to make sure everything is square and parallel. Then drive three more 
screws into each joint to lock things up solid. Let the glue set for a few 
hours before putting any strain on the joints. The arbor will be a bit floppy 
until set in the ground, so handle it carefully from here on. It's not a bad 
idea to tack on a pair of temporary diagonal braces about 6 feet long to 
reinforce the arbor until it is safely in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
I tried an unusual trick for setting my arbor in the ground and it worked 
perfectly. Carry the arbor into position in the garden, and set it in place on 
the ground. Carefully mark the position of each leg, then pick the arbor up and 
set it aside. Next, punch four post holes 16 inches into the ground using a 
heavy sledge hammer and a 3-foot length of 4-by-4. Just pound the 4-by-4 into 
the ground, wiggle it around to loosen it and enlarge the hole, then pull it 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, set the arbor legs into these holes and pour them full of pea gravel. 
Once the legs are safely set in the ground, the arbor becomes quite rigid and 
you can remove the temporary braces. I finished my arbor with a white exterior 
stain. This looks a lot like paint, but won't chip or peel, so it's easier to 
maintain.

COMMERCIAL SCENE: JAPANESE GETTING COLD FEET ABOUT L.A.?; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTMENTS: INFLATION, STOCK MARKET DECLINE IN TOKYO, POOR RETURNS MAY PROMPT 
JAPANESE TO SELL SOME OF THEIR REAL ESTATE HERE.

<P>
Whither Japanese investors in Los Angeles 1990? 
</P>
<P>
That's the question real estate observers all over town are asking. 
</P>
<P>
Price Waterhouse issued a press release this month predicting that the Japanese 
may soon begin selling some of their "trophy" office buildings in major U.S. 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese investment firms are looking for better economic returns on their 
investments than they've received in the past few years from their American 
real estate," noted Daniel S. Levitan, director of real estate consulting in 
Los Angeles for the accounting firm Price Waterhouse. And, he predicted, "if we 
have a recession, real estate will be hit hard." 
</P>
<P>
At the core of this gloomy scenario are some major changes that have taken 
place in the Japanese economy. Interest rates have skyrocketed in Tokyo, with 
the prime lending rate now at 8.3%. That may not sound like much, but two years 
ago, the rate was closer to 3%. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks in Japan have been hit hard in recent months. Also, banks in Japan are 
leery of lending funds for investments such as Los Angeles office buildings 
that will take years to turn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
"There are going to be some sales by the Japanese companies under pressure," 
said David Hamamoto, vice president of real estate at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. 
in Los Angeles. "We're starting to hear talk by Japanese companies of disposing 
of their real estate." 
</P>
<P>
Such a movement, needless to say, would have a depressing effect on the local 
commercial scene.

The trend toward less Japanese investments in the office market has been 
evident for more than a year. In 1988, the Japanese invested $8.3 billion in 
U.S. office buildings. Last year that figure tumbled to $3 billion. And, in 
1990, the number is expected to hover between $2 billion and $2.5 billion, said 
Jack R. Rodman, managing partner and director of Pacific Rim activities at 
Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
Golf-related resorts are still very popular with the Japanese, however, and so 
are hotels. These investments in 1990 are expected to total $5 billion to $6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Expect a shift away from Los Angeles investments by the Japanese, though. Other 
areas of the country are currently offering more handsome returns, Rodman said. 
</P>
<P>
Truly trophy properties -- defined as unique assets not easily replaceable -- 
won't be sold anytime soon, though. It's the more mediocre properties, Rodman 
said, that will get sold instead. 
</P>
<P>
The concern over a sell-off persists. "High interest rates in Japan are a real 
problem for trophy properties," warned Asia watcher Christopher Mead, president 
of Mead Ventures Inc. in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
The high rates are "going to make the Japanese more short-term like us," he 
predicted. "It's easy to be long-term when you're paying a 3% interest rate." 
But that is no longer the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles offices are clearly not favored today by the Japanese," said David 
Ash, senior vice president of Eastdil Realty Inc. in Los Angeles. Even so, "it 
wouldn't make sense now to turn around and sell." 
</P>
<P>
The market for offices is depressed, so it's likely that Japanese investors 
will wait out the current downturn. Besides, Ash said, the Japanese aren't 
necessarily dissatisfied with poor returns on their local investments. Many of 
the hotels and offices were not bought to turn a profit, recalled Ash, but as a 
vehicle to maintain a presence in Los Angeles and create new business 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Just how many buildings go up for sale in the coming year is anybody's guess, 
Ash said. "It's dangerous to generalize." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SALES 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's 550 North Brand Building has been sold for $75 million to Los 
Angeles and New York-based pension fund representative the Yarmouth Group. 
Eastdil Realty represented the sellers Hillman Properties West Inc. of Newport 
Beach and Smith &amp; Hricik of Los Angeles. Completed in 1987, the 21-story 
building totals 287,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Yet another building on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills has ben sold to the 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Rodeo Drive Properties Corp., an affiliate of a Japanese retailing corporation, 
has purchased 327-329 North Rodeo Drive from United Kingdom-based Austenpeter 
Inc. for about $12 million. Jones Lang Wooton USA represented the seller; 
Gilbert Dembo &amp; Associates represented the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Other major Japanese acquisitions on Rodeo include Arai &amp; Co.'s purchase of 
One Rodeo Drive in 1987; sale of the Ted/Lapidus Giorgio of Beverly Hills 
building to a Japanese retailing company this year; and the purchase of an 
interest in the new Two Rodeo Drive mall by Kowa Real Estate Investment Co. and 
Sogo Co.

PICTURE FRAMES REGAIN FAVOR AS DECORATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The collectibles you move in with may contribute as much to the decor as the 
paint, wallpaper, rugs and drapes. Pictures, boxes or objets d'art may capture 
the eye first and determine a room's character. 
</P>
<P>
Frames evoking classic styles like Victorian ceramics, Parisian silver or 
sculptured Italian or Russian designs in a variety of metals that have been 
burnished, painted or mirrored are offered by Dakin Terragrafics. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only have picture frames regained their elegance, evoking a time when 
photos of family members were a novelty and placed in intricately crafted 
silver casings, they have recently inspired a veritable explosion of new 
designs and materials," says Joseph E. Walsmith, the firm's president. 
</P>
<P>
Fabric styles that are similar to English chintz designs, by I Was Framed, 
cover picture frames and are available with matching boxes for jewelry, hats, 
cosmetics, dishes and other collectibles, as well as tissue dispensers, 
wastebaskets, albums, notebooks, music boxes and similar items. Most of the 
designs are florals, but the line also includes moires in pink or black. 
</P>
<P>
Gallery and Art Nouveau styles, including a number of architecturally inspired 
frames based on the work of Scottish designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh, are 
offered through the Exposures catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
Also available are archival storage and display systems for incurable 
collectors of photos and oddments, including glass-covered cases and 
museum-style tables in which to display favorite baubles. For information or 
catalogues, call (800) 222-4947. 
</P>
<P>
From Diane von Furstenberg come frames, desk accessories and paper tableware in 
bold animal prints. Her Nairobi collection features abstracts of leopard, tiger 
and zebra patterns on picture frames, address books, journals, albums, letter 
holders, stationery, paper plates, napkins and invitations.

TRICK OR TREAT: On Halloween, Sire Records is releasing "Where the Pyramid 
Meets the Eye," a tribute to Roky Erickson, one of rock's great outcast 
eccentrics. Put together by Warner Records staffer (and Texas-rock maven) Bill 
Bentley, the album features 20 Erickson covers by such disparate fans as ZZ Top 
and Jesus &amp; Mary Chain (who both do "Reverberation"), R.E.M. ("I Walked 
with a Zombie"), Doug Sahm and Sons ("You're Gonna Miss Me"), T-Bone Burnett 
("Nothing in Return"), Poi Dog Pondering ("I Had to Tell You") and BH Surfers 
("Earthquake"). 
</P>
<P>
The profits from the album's song publishing are earmarked for a trust fund for 
Erickson's mental care. . . . Speaking of Poi Dog Pondering, the Austin-based 
band can also be heard on an upcoming episode of David Lynch and Mark Frost's 
"American Chronicles." The group recorded seven new instrumentals for the show, 
titled "Guns for Hire," which chronicles a recent Soldier of Fortune magazine 
convention in Las Vegas.

</P>
<P>
Every weekday at 6 a.m., the Discovery Channel airs two commercial-free 20-25 
minute program segments under the umbrella title Assignment: Discovery. Shows

If the Marines sent Pvt. Gomer Pyle to Saudi Arabia, we wouldn't have to worry 
about war in the Middle East. Gomer would either melt Saddam Hussein's hardened 
heart or send him right into a straitjacket. 
</P>
<P>
Gomer (Jim Nabors) tries his best, but go-o-olly, does he drive Sgt. Carter 
crazy. This time, however, Gomer's the one who could be driven crazy-by Cpl. 
Carol. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Burnett, as a love-starved Marine on Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. (Friday at 2:30 
a.m. on TBS), falls hard for Gomer, who keeps dating her because she never 
gives him a chance to tell her he's already got a girlfriend-Lou-Ann Poovie 
(Elizabeth MacRae). Burnett is at her infuriating and pathetic best. 
</P>
<P>
"Corporal Carol" originally aired in September, 1967, a couple weeks after her 
own series, "The Carol Burnett Show," made its debut. Nabors would sometimes 
turn up on Burnett's comedy series, too. 
</P>
<P>
Gomer, whose show was a spinoff of "The Andy Griffith Show," never forgot his 
Mayberry roots and was occasionally visited by old pals Andy, Goober, Opie and, 
this week, Aunt Bee (Thursday at 2:30 a.m. on TBS). 
</P>

Photo, Carol Burnett and Jim Nabors, right, visited each others' shows in the

Carol falling for Gomer in a big way. On TBS.

TODAY'S NEWS, TOMORROW'S 'MURPHY BROWN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH HASTINGS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's hard enough to separate reality from make-believe on television. On CBS' 
"Murphy Brown," the line between fact and fiction is forever blurred. Real-life 
news broadcasters walk into the fictional "FYI" newsroom as themselves. Last 
season saw TV journaaists Connie Chung, Kathleen Sullivan and Linda Ellerbee in 
guest roles on the comedy series about a make-believe television news magazine 
based in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
Besides cameos by news personalities, the highly rated program consistently 
draws its scripts from headline stories. 
</P>
<P>
This season is no different. 
</P>
<P>
The Sept. 18 premiere of "Murphy Brown's" third season saw the cast and set of 
"FYI" undergo a total overhaul, complete with toupees, short skirts and a Santa 
Fe nightmare of new furniture, all in the name of chatty, user-friendly news 
and bigger ratings. 
</P>
<P>
The next episode concerned the ever-intense liberal and feminist lead character 
Murphy Brown, played by Candice Bergen, doing an interview with a racist, 
sexist comedian whom she despised (guess who the comedian was modeled after). 
</P>
<P>
The show's writers also are working on a script tackling the issue of what 
happens when news personalities say regrettable things, a la Andy Rooney's now 
infamous remarks about gays and blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"People like to see issues from news and things that affect them personally," 
said Diane English, the program's creator, co-executive producer and frequent 
writer. "The topicality of our shows is one of the favorite things about 
'Murphy Brown.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last month the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences awarded the show an Emmy 
for best comedy series. Bergen also won her second outstanding lead comedy 
actress trophy for her acid-tongued portrayal of a star TV journalist. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such heady honors, English said the show will remain largely the same. 
Some subtle, unexpected plot twists are being planned, but she wouldn't divulge 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to have surprises for our viewers," English said. 
</P>
<P>
And while "Murphy Brown" uses news for entertainment, real-life journalism has 
decided to use "Murphy Brown" for news. 
</P>
<P>
"PrimeTime Live" co-anchor Diane Sawyer spent a week on the set taping a 
segment on the making of "Murphy Brown," set to air Thursday. If Sawyer's 
schedule would have permitted, English said, the former "60 Minutes" 
correspondent might have made an appearance on the comedy series while doing a 
news story about it. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, English said, her show has extended several invitations to Sawyer and 
Rall the '60 Minutes' guys" including CB" Evening News anchor Dan Rather (a 
former "60 Minutes" guy) and Mike Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
Rather is really not sure whether this is a good thing for him to do," English 
said. "He has a great sense of humor, and it would be great if people could see 
that."' 
</P>
<P>
Cable talk show host Larry King's involvement is being sought for an upcoming 
episode in which Brown is taken hostage by environmentally conscious 
Reco-terrorists," English said. "She's trying to convince people that she's 
really been kidnaped and no one believes her because she's such a practical 
joker," English said. 
</P>
<P>
In captivity, Brown sees King on television and tries to call in on the talk 
show's viewer line. 
</P>
<P>
English said she and husband Joel Shukovsky, the show's other executive 
producer, also are considering an episode about management survival trips, at 
the suggestion of Sawyer. 
</P>
<P>
According to English, Sawyer said ABC had sent her and "PrimeTime Live" 
co-anchor Sam Donaldson into the wilderness to rough it for a few days-a kind 
of management retreat that bigger corporations are increasingly employing. 
</P>
<P>
English should just film Sawyer and the notoriously pugnacious Donaldson 
hanging out with Mother Nature- now that would be entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Although "Murphy Brown" is lauded by critics and has climbed steadily-if 
sporadically-in the ratings, English and Shukovsky were very close to leaving 
the show this year because of protracted contract battles with Warner Bros. 
Television. 
</P>
<P>
"The negotiations were very long and very tedious and very dismal at times," 
English said. "We had even approved a press release that CBS was going to put 
out in April saying we would not be coming back to the show." 
</P>
<P>
At the last minute, the studio agreed to give the pair more money, a higher 
ownership percentage in the program and the right to make other shows for other 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
In return, English and Shukovsky signed on for 100 more episodes. 
</P>
<P>
"We made this show," English said. "Without us, there was no 'Murphy Brown.' 
And we saw the network coming out way ahead of us. I'm doing everything but 
catering the meals." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to monetary issues in the television business, the line between 
reality and make-believe is very clear. 
</P>
<P>
"Murphy Brown" airs Mondays at 9 p.m. on CBS. The "Murphy Brown" segment of 
"PrimeTime Live" airs Thursday at 10 p.m. on ABC.

Here are the responses to the Sept. 30 question: What did you think of the 
season's first episode of 'Twin Peaks'? 
</P>
<P>
I am obsessed with "Twin Peaks." I think it is the best series there ever was 
in the world. All the actors are wonderful and exciting. The show is soooooooo 
exciting, and you always are never sure who the killer is. I hope the series 
never ends. Agent Cooper is the prize of the show. He's wonderful. "Twin Peaks" 
should go all the way. 
</P>
<P>
Erin Evarts, Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
Sorry to say I was very disappointed in the season debut of "Twin Peaks." I 
thought it was very boring; in fact I fell asleep. "Twin Peaks" started out 
very good but got too involved and too complicated to keep up with the plot. 
So, I give up. 
</P>
<P>
Gail V. Schmitt, Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
I am obsessed with ABC's mystery series "Twin Peaks." I think and dream "Twin 
Peaks." I drive my parents crazy with 'Peaks talk. After watching Sunday's 
season opener, I was even more in awe! This brilliant (David) Lynch series is 
full of fabulous acting, fabulous directing and fabulous writing.(I guess I 
would say it's fabulous.) As a "Twin Peaks" fan, I just want to say keep up the 
good work and Agent Cooper, stay strange. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica L. Rosenthal, Agoura Hills 
</P>
<P>
I suppose I, like a lot of people, have a "love-hate" relationship with "Twin 
Peaks." Immediately after the two-hour premiere was over, I proclaimed that I 
was finished watching "Twin Peaks" forever. The producers had strung me along 
for another two hours, and thrown in some disturbing gratuitous weirdness that 
is becoming older by the minute. 
</P>
<P>
But the real problem is that after a sleepless night filled with thoughts of 
Bob, smiling bags and mysterious giants, I found myself ready to go through it 
again. 
</P>
<P>
There is something addictive about "Twin Peaks." No matter how frightening it 
is or how frustrating its vague answers are, the viewer feels that he must go 
back to "Twin Peaks" again. 
</P>
<P>
And yes -- I'll be there next Saturday night, and the next -- to go through the 
whole cycle all over once more. 
</P>
<P>
Lauren Walden, Orange 
</P>
<P>
"Twin Peaks" grabs my attention, it compares to no other show on TV. Forget 
about who killed Laura Palmer. If they don't tell us soon, we're going to 
forget about her. Besides, there's so much more going on to keep us busy. 
</P>
<P>
Glady Mills, Northridge 
</P>
<P>
I was satisfied with the season premiere of "Twin Peaks." As usual, Agent 
Cooper was the highlight of the show. It was especially nice to see Albert 
Rosenfield again. That dim-witted butler who served Cooper's warm milk got on 
my nerves. Good job, Lynch and Frost. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Jung, Cypress 
</P>
<P>
"Twin Peaks" continues to be a real thriller -- a production which keeps you on 
the edge of your seat. I actually almost jumped out of mine Sunday night.

Q&amp;A: DAVID WOLPER: DOCUMENTING A TALENTED PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan King 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every Monday for the next two years, the Arts &amp; Entertainment Network will 
air "David L. Wolper Presents," a series of documentaries produced by the 
Oscar-and Emmy-winning David L. Wolper. 
</P>
<P>
The series will feature historical, scientific, environmental and entertainment 
documentaries that Wolper made in the 1950's, '60's and '70's for all three 
major networks, with new introductory remarks by Wolper. 
</P>
<P>
"Project: Man in Space," produced in 1959 and hosted by Mike Wallace, airs 
Monday. Some of the documentaries featured during the remainder of 1990 are 
"The Making of the President: 1964" (Nov. 5); "Ten Seconds That Shook the 
World" (Nov. 19); "December 7th: The Day of Infamy" (Dec. 3). 
</P>
<P>
Wolper, who has produced such award-winning miniseries as "Roots," "The Thorn 
Birds" and "North and South" and served as commissioner and producer of the 
opening and closing ceremonies for the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, discussed 
his documentary career with SusanKing. 
</P>
<P>
Does "David L. Wolper Presents" mark the first time your documentaries have 
been seen since they initially aired? 
</P>
<P>
A lot of them haven't been run for 15 years or so. There were a whole series of 
circumstances affecting who owned them and how they went from company to 
company, but I finally got them all back and under my control. There are 75 of 
them. I am very happy they are in one place and under one roof. A lot of people 
have tried to buy them separately in piecemeal, but I wanted to do it all in 
one place. When I told A &amp; E I had them available they just came right to 
me and made arrangements for it. It worked out pretty fast. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial television seems to have stopped airing documentaries. 
</P>
<P>
They used to (air documentaries), but I got out of the business because they 
don't run as many anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Why is that? 
</P>
<P>
A lot of my documentaries did get a lot of ratings. When NBC and CBS were 
always No. 1 and 2 and ABC was always third, (the networks) were willing to 
take more chances. The minute ABC became first, no one wanted to be third. they 
were not even going to take a chance on a documentary, not even their own. They 
are afraid of losing one night because the competition is so hot now, so that's 
why they abandoned them totally. There used to be good stuff like "CBS Reports" 
and "See It Now'." 
</P>
<P>
When you produced your first documentary "The Race for Space" more than 30 
years ago, were there a lot of documentaries on TV? 
</P>
<P>
There were documentaries, but they were all done by the networks themselves. I 
was the first independent to walk in with a documentary. I had it sold, as a 
matter of fact, to a sponsor. It just happens that with "The Race for Space" 
(the networks) didn't put it on the air. The networks said they wouldn't put it 
on because they didn't air public-affairs programming produced by independent 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
How did you get it aired? 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, before 1958 I had been in the business of selling films for TV I 
knew the owners of all these TV stations around the country. I called them up 
and they all put it on in the same week, station by station. 
</P>
<P>
I set up a fourth network basically for "The Race for Space." That was a big 
success and it was nominated for an Academy Award. Some advertising agencies in 
New York saw it and wanted me to make films for them. I was just producing 
away. 
</P>
<P>
We did our documentaries in a very dramatic way. With "Ten Seconds That Shook 
the World" (about the origins of the atomic bomb) we did the whole story behind 
the bomb and the dropping of it and how even mistakes were made. The bomb was 
the biggest secret in the history of the world. Nobody knew about until it was 
done. To think that there were thousands and thousands of people working on a 
project and nobody knew what it was. Even Vice President Truman didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
My philosophy as a filmmaker is to inform and entertain at the same time. And 
when I went away from documentaries into miniseries like "Roots," I did the 
reverse. Instead of just entertaining, I want to inform at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Did you ever find footage that no one knew existed? 
</P>
<P>
All the time. We found pictures of Roosevelt and Churchill in the desert eating 
sandwiches in a car. We were real excited because no one knew there were 
cameras there when they were meeting. We always found jewels here and there. 
</P>
<P>
Did you get cooperation from the presidential candidates when you made "Making 
of the President: 1960" and "Making of the President: 1964"? 
</P>
<P>
In 1964 we did, because of Teddy White (author Theodore White). We didn't in 
1960 because White didn't write the book until after the election, so we didn't 
know we were going to make the film. But in 1964 Teddy White arranged for us to 
go film the candidates in different places. We were able to do our own filming. 
In 1960, we just used film that was already in existence. 
</P>
<P>
I also made the film about Kennedy they showed at the 1964 Democratic 
Convention called "A Thousand Days'." It was a very moving film and everyone 
(at the convention) was crying. 
</P>
<P>
Do you miss making documentaries? 
</P>
<P>
I am away from it. I am into dramatic areas now. Although I did two 
documentaries for the theaters with one of my old associates. We did "Imagine 
John Lennon" and "This Is Elvis" about three years earlier. It's harder to find 
the money to do them now. 
</P>
<P>
"David L. Wolper Presents" airs Mondays at 5 and 9 p.m. on the Arts &amp; 
Entertainment Network.
