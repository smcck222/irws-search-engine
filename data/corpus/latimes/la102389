SHOWERS FAIL TO DAMPEN SPIRITS AT ARTS FESTIVAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
To the more than 50,000 people who crowded Balboa Park for the opening of the 
San Diego Arts Festival, Super Powers Sunday will be remembered as the day it 
rained -- briefly -- on Mayor Maureen O'Connor's parade. 
</P>
<P>
It may also go down in history as the day O'Connor defied the elements. 
</P>
<P>
At the noon-time kickoff, as a procession of children joined O'Connor on stage 
at the Spreckels Organ Pavilion, sprinkles turned to drizzle, and then to rain. 
Seeing some of her standing-room-only crowd heading for the exits, O'Connor 
sprang into action. 
</P>
<P>
"Please," she asked the crowd, as dozens of Soviet Georgian Child Folk Dancers 
stood fidgeting behind her. "I told these dancers to come over in October 
because it would be sunny. I don't care if it's raining, it's shining on San 
Diego." 
</P>
<P>
And with that, the audience sat down, the rain stopped falling, and San Diego's 
image-makers breathed a sigh of relief. For San Diego, the 21-day, $6-million 
festival has come to be seen as a test of the city's ability to host an 
international cultural event. For O'Connor, who came up with the festival idea 
two years ago, it is a measure of her administration, her tenacity and her 
judgement. If successful, it could be her legacy. If a flop, it could be a 
major political embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the rain-or-shine crowd's enthusiastic applause, however, the 
child dancers were worth getting wet for. Dressed in red, black and gold, the 
young men leaped, spun in the air and landed on their knees, nimbly flinging 
gleaming sabers. Members of a 65-member dance troupe of adults and children, 
their performances throughout the rest of the festival have been sold out for 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"You think this is where break-dancing came from?" asked Pam King, a 
first-grade teacher from Leucadia, who was in the audience. "I guess 
break-dancing is our folk dancing." 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Meador, a fifth-grade teacher from Carlsbad, agreed, but seemed alarmed 
by the dancers' knee-numbing gymnastics. "Doesn't it make you wonder about 
their growing bones?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
The folk dancers were among dozens of events and exhibits that seemed designed 
to point out how much Americans and Soviets have in common. Near the pavilion, 
seven sand carvers were at work on a familiar sight: a huge sand castle. It was 
modeled, said a spokesman for Sand Sculptors International, on St. Basil's 
Cathedral in Moscow's Red Square. Local puppeteer Marie Hitchcock's show 
featured a meeting between four Faberge eggs and Humpty Dumpty. San Diego 
street performers among Soviet exhibits -- offering their services for free. 
And then there were the beans. 
</P>
<P>
For $2 a taste, thousands of people sampled a feast prepared by six master 
chefs from the Soviet republic of Georgia. Among the dishes: lobio, a bean and 
herb spread that looked like it ought to be sitting next to a taco. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a frijole fan, so I'm in heaven," said Beto Yznaga, a computer science 
manager from Spring Valley, as he finished off some lamb shish kebab, or 
shashlyk. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Johnson, a retired bank employee from Rancho Penasquitos, held an empty 
plate in her hand. "I had the marinated beef and the beans," she said with a 
satisfied grin. "It looked like regurgitated dog food, and I thought, 'I'll 
taste these and put the rest in the garbage.' But look at my plate!" 
</P>
<P>
She was not alone. By 2:30 p.m., the Georgian chefs were running out of food. 
"The city said 50,000 would come, so we should cook for 20,000," said Jack 
Monaco, who presided over the Georgian food operation. "But it's been less than 
four hours, and almost everybody is out of food." 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, even before the Georgian food ran, more than a few visitors had opted 
to wait in long lines for American fare, like Vienna beef hot dogs and 
hamburgers. By mid-afternoon, even Shalva Metreueli, one of the Georgian chefs, 
said he was hungry for a nice American sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
As Mayor O'Connor told the adult Georgian dancers after their afternoon 
performance, "We have the same things -- good people, good food and fantastic 
cities. The only difference is, you don't have a woman mayor." 
</P>
<P>
The food was not the only sell-out. T-shirts and sweat shirts sold quickly at 
$12 and $21 a pop. And at about 2 p.m., visitors waiting to buy $5 tickets to 
see the Faberge egg collection were told that no more tickets were available 
for Sunday viewing. Last week, museum officials stopped selling advance tickets 
for the first day, but held back about 1,000 tickets for sale on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Those fortunate enough to see the 27 jeweled eggs had nothing but praise for 
the exhibit. The eggs, which Russian czars gave as Easter gifts to their 
mothers and wives, came primarily from the Forbes Magazine and Kremlin Armory 
Museum collections and will be on view until Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Preston said she came from Houston along with a companion from Oklahoma 
just to see the Faberge exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
"I started calling the (San Diego) Chamber of Commerce months ago to find out 
how to get tickets," she said after spending 90 minutes with the eggs in the 
Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone who attended the festival shared Preston's enthusiasm. About a 
dozen members of the Alliance for Self-Determination of Armenia traveled 
throughout the crowds protesting what their leaflet called "the facade of 
'perestroika.' " Dressed in black and white striped jail garb, they carried 
banners that said "Red Tyranny" and "Soviet Art: Yes/ Soviet Imperialism: No." 
At the head of their procession was a man in a dark suit and a Mikhail 
Gorbachev mask. 
</P>
<P>
Across the park in the Casa del Prado, Nana Alexandria, one of the strongest 
women chess players in the world, played chess for four hours with 38 people at 
once. Alexandria, an intense Soviet woman with dark hair and pale skin, spent 
only moments at each board, studying the moves and then moving on. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Mendes, an 11-year-old sixth grader who has played chess for five years, 
started off well, he thought. "At first, I started mimicking her and she got 
confused. At the next move I almost got a checkmate," he said as he waited for 
Alexandria to make her rounds. But in one more exchange, he was out. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Miller, the president of the San Diego Chess Club, predicted that Mendes 
would not be the only loser. "Nana will probably play 100 games today, and she 
doesn't intend to lose any," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the afternoon, dozens of people approached the mayor to shake her 
hand or pose for photos, while still more yelled things like, "It's a great 
party, Maureen!" or, "Thanks for bringing this to us, mayor!" 
</P>
<P>
"Tell that to the City Council -- they're the ones that had the doubts," 
O'Connor replied. 
</P>
<P>
There were other converts. Johnson said that in addition to the tasty food, the 
whole day had made her "a believer. When I read about this I thought, 'My, God. 
We need sewers. We need roads. What is (Mayor O'Connor) doing?' I really have 
to eat crow. This was a marvelous idea." 
</P>
<P>
To Lori Kanter and Richard Lindbergh, who made reservations in March to get 
married in the park on Sunday, the festival was a distraction. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to concentrate," Kanter admitted, as she stood in her white gown 
outside Cafe del Rey Moro. "We have 70 guests, but it seems there are another 
umpteen uninvited ones." 
</P>
<P>
"Someone asked me if I'm a Russian dancer," said Jan Steck, a bridesmaid in a 
pink ruffled dress. "I'm from Tulsa." 
</P>

Cold air that blanketed much of the eastern half of the nation brought record 
low temperatures to Florida. In Tallahassee, the mercury dipped to a record low 
of 34 degrees. Melbourne had a record low of 49, and Miami tied a record with 
59. Temperatures dipped below freezing in the Great Lakes and the northern Ohio 
Valley. Ft. Wayne, Ind., reported a record low of 27. Temperatures were in the 
40s in northern New England, where the fall foliage season is just past its 
peak.

An Amtrak train carrying about 220 passengers broadsided a CSX freight train 
near Upper Sandusky, Ohio, injuring four people. Two Amtrak crew members 
remained hospitalized. An Amtrak engineer and a 76-year-old passenger were 
treated and released. The 116-car freight train carried carbolic acid, but none 
of the cargo spilled, a CSX Transportation spokeswoman said. The accident 
occurred when the Amtrak's Broadway Limited train hit the freight train at a 
crossing, an Amtrak spokeswoman said. The cause of the accident was under 
investigation.

STATE TAKES ACTION TO PROTECT SALMON

<P>
The state Water Resources Control Board has acted to tighten its control of the 
temperature of water in the Sacramento River in an effort to improve spawning 
conditions for salmon. The board adopted a new order recognizing a fact known 
to fishing experts for years -- water temperatures in the Sacramento below the 
Shasta and Keswick dams can rise above 60 degrees in mid-autumn, with 
devastating effects on salmon spawning. Fisheries biologists consider the 
maximum safe spawning temperature for Chinook salmon to be 57.5 degrees. The 
board's action makes the quality of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's releases 
into the Sacramento a "water rights" issue directly affecting the permits under 
which the federal agency operates the Central Valley Project, California's 
largest water distribution system.

RUPERT COSTO; AMERICAN INDIAN SCHOLAR WHO FOUGHT STEREOTYPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rupert Costo, Cahuilla Indian activist and scholar who in the 1950s formed the 
American Indian Historical Society to promote and develop the culture, 
education and welfare of Indians, died Friday at his San Francisco home. 
</P>
<P>
Costo, with his Cherokee wife Jeannette, also fought for the scholarly 
representation of Indians rather than the stereotypes they found prevalent. 
</P>
<P>
He most recently had been in the news when he opposed the canonization of 
Father Junipero Serra, an 18th-Century missionary the couple called "an 
arrogant, opinionated, hypocritical Inquisition commissioner . . . who history 
holds responsible for the decimation of hundreds of thousands of Indian people" 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
Costo was raised on a reservation near Hemet and worked as an engineer, 
meteorologist, surveyor and lobbyist for the federal agency that oversees 
Indian affairs in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
He studied at Riverside Community College, Whittier College and the University 
of Nevada and was a retired engineer for the California Department of 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986 the Costos raised $400,000 to endow the first chair for American Indian 
studies in the University of California system, at UC Riverside. It remains one 
of only a handful in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the money came from the Costos' three-story mansion in the 
Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco, which had been the headquarters for their 
society. 
</P>
<P>
Much of their library of 15,000 books, treaties, legal documents, prints and 
paintings also went to the university. 
</P>
<P>
Jeannette Costos asks contributions to the UC Riverside Foundation in the name 
of the Rupert Costo Chair in American Indian History.

DAVID VICTOR; PRODUCER OF 'MARCUS WELBY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Victor, an Emmy award-winning producer who was forced by the Depression 
to forsake his own interest in medicine and yet, with "Marcus Welby, M.D." and 
"Dr. Kildare" made house calls into millions of American homes, has died. 
</P>
<P>
The Russian-born Victor was vacationing in Williamsburg, Va., when he died of a 
heart attack Wednesday. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
He had come to this country from Odessa as a boy of 13 with his widowed mother. 
</P>
<P>
He told a Times writer in 1969, the year "Marcus Welby" began an eight-year run 
at the top of the television ratings, that he had to abandon his interest in 
medicine to help support his mother after the Depression hit. 
</P>
<P>
But he did pursue an interest in Latin and literature. The quality of writing 
then permeating radio led him to think, "I can do better." 
</P>
<P>
He wrote scripts for such disparate shows as "Let George Do It," a 
mystery-detective series, and "The Mel Blanc Show," a situation comedy starring 
the late dialectician. 
</P>
<P>
Victor moved to television as a writer and associate producer on "The Rebel" 
series and a 1957 feature film "Trooper Hook." 
</P>
<P>
He wrote episodes of "Daniel Boone," "Rawhide" and "The Texan" before 
gravitating toward production. 
</P>
<P>
He became producer of "The Man From U.N.C.L.E." (and its spinoff "The Girl From 
U.N.C.L.E"), "Lucas Tanner," "Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law" and "Women in 
White." 
</P>
<P>
He also did several TV films and miniseries including "The Woman I Love," 
"Vanished" and "Little Women." 
</P>
<P>
His "Portrait: The Man Whose Name Was John," which starred Raymond Burr as Pope 
John, won the International Silver Dove Award in Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
When "Dr. Kildare" went on the air in 1961, Victor was associate producer and 
eventually producer. 
</P>
<P>
James Kildare was an intern who had first appeared in films. In the TV series, 
Victor tried unsuccessfully to move him from a hospital setting into private 
practice where "there was a much wider range for stories." 
</P>
<P>
He was overruled, however, because the show had proved so successful in its 
hospital format. 
</P>
<P>
Victor decided then, he said, that his next television doctor would enjoy the 
latitude of a wider story line. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Robert Young as "Marcus Welby" was a general practitioner in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
One of the producer's favorite stories was about the evening he and Young 
attended the 1970 Emmys where "Marcus Welby, M.D." had received several 
nominations (winning three). Fans besieged Young for autographs and as the 
actor finally extricated himself from the crowd, one woman turned to Victor, 
who was off to the side, and asked, "Didn't you used to be somebody?" 
</P>
<P>
That became the title for his recently completed autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
Services are scheduled at 10 a.m. today at Mt. Sinai Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Florence, who was with him when he died, a 
daughter, a son and four grandchildren, one of whom is a physician.

ARSON SUSPECTED IN LONG BEACH FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fire that raged for five hours Sunday morning in downtown Long Beach 
destroyed an auto upholstery shop and an appliance rental store, but 
firefighters were able to save luxury cars at an auto dealership next door. 
</P>
<P>
The two-story building on Long Beach Boulevard housing Bill's Top Shop and The 
Rent Club was a total loss, Long Beach Fire Department spokesman Bob Caldon 
said. Damage was estimated at about $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach firefighters, assisted by crews from the Long Beach Naval Station, 
broke the front windows of the adjacent Kensington Motors Ltd. and pulled out 
about 15 Lotus and Avanti automobiles valued at $600,000 to $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the 4 a.m. fire, which was fueled by chemicals inside the 
upholstery shop, has not been determined, Caldon said, but arson is suspected. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second major fire of the weekend in Long Beach. Two men, Sean Duffy, 
30, and Jerry Dean Lindsey, 37, were killed early Saturday in a fire that 
heavily damaged a home on East Wardlow Road. Police originally suspected arson 
in that fire, but now it is believed to have begun accidentally, Caldon said.

SUIT ACCUSES L.A. COUNTY OF COERCING DONATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
CHARITIES: SEVERAL COUNTY EMPLOYEES SAY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UNITED WAY AND 
BROTHERHOOD CRUSADE ARE FORCED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Peter Wood, a county Department of Public Works supervisor, said he reached the 
breaking point when he was ordered to direct a student worker to make weekly 
donations to the United Way and the Brotherhood Crusade or risk losing his 
part-time job. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Renteria, an 18-year county Department of Parks and Recreation employee, 
said the final straw for him was a four-hour solicitation party sponsored by 
his bosses on behalf of the two charities. You can't find a repair worker to 
fix the plumbing or broken lights at county parks, Renteria said, yet more than 
100 department employees were on hand on county time to throw sponges soaked in 
whipped cream at their supervisors for $1 a pop. 
</P>
<P>
Wood and Renteria are participants in a recently filed lawsuit accusing the 
county of coercing its employees into contributing to the two charity groups, 
which serve as umbrella organizations to distribute donations to the needy. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge issued a temporary restraining 
order instructing the county to make clear to its 80,000 employees that they 
will not be punished for failing to contribute. Judge Abby Soven also 
temporarily barred the county from evaluating its managers on the level of 
donations by their employees. 
</P>
<P>
Soven, however, refused to issue a temporary order instructing the county to 
stop its practice of soliciting contributions during work time. Rather, the 
judge scheduled a full hearing Nov. 2 on whether to grant injunctions against 
any of the three practices. 
</P>
<P>
Soven's action was hailed by the employees' attorney, Rees Lloyd, who said it 
was the first order on record by a California judge halting allegedly coercive 
tactics by a government body in soliciting private donations. 
</P>
<P>
County officials, denying that coercion is a county policy, said they have no 
quarrel with the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The county's chief administrative officer, Richard B. Dixon, said all 
charitable contributions "are voluntary, although I concede when you have 
80,000 employees, what appears voluntary to one person may appear coercive to 
another person." 
</P>
<P>
A United Way spokesman expressed "delight" with the action, saying the 
charity's policy is that all donations be made voluntarily. Officials of the 
Brotherhood Crusade declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
County workers donated a total of $2.6 million to the two charity groups during 
last year's campaigns. County employees represented the largest single donor 
account for the United Way, giving $1.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
For years, officials of the charities, which target donations to nonprofit 
agencies ranging from the Red Cross to the Compton Sickle Cell Detection and 
Education Center, have been afforded time by many government agencies and 
private firms to make solicitation pitches at workplace gatherings. Employees 
can have weekly donations directly withdrawn from their paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, the suit charges, is that Los Angeles County sometimes goes too 
far. 
</P>
<P>
Wood, a 29-year county water supply technician who supervises 22 workers, says 
he gave to both charities until a few months ago when he finally became 
"totally disgusted and fed up." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit states that Wood was recently instructed by a supervisor "to inform 
two student workers . . . that they must sign up for contributions to United 
Way or they would no longer be employed by Los Angeles County." The next day, 
the suit alleges, a supervisor told him the students must also contribute to 
the Brotherhood Crusade. 
</P>
<P>
Wood, in a sworn declaration, said he believed that the pressure was applied 
because top department supervisors are judged for merit raises and promotions 
on factors that include their ability to persuade employees to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
"They push and push and finally they push too far," Wood said in an interview. 
"You can only back a person in a corner like an animal so far before they start 
rebelling." 
</P>
<P>
Wood brought his complaints to Department of Public Works construction 
superintendent Rudolph Rico, a director of a nonprofit organization called the 
Robin Hood Foundation that frequently represents county employees with 
grievances. Lloyd, legal counsel for the foundation, filed the suit on behalf 
of Wood, Rico, the foundation and several other county employees and former 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Renteria said he agreed to file an affidavit in the case after attending the 
charity breakfast Oct. 13 at Crescenta Valley Park. 
</P>
<P>
Renteria, also a steady contributor to the United Way, was ordered to cook and 
wash utensils on county work time at the affair. 
</P>
<P>
"The event went on until close to noon. I believe that all employees were being 
paid to attend," he stated in court papers. "I observed solicitations being 
made by persons identified as representatives of (the charities). Funds were 
also raised by various events, like throwing sponges full of whipped cream at 
bosses. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe for one dollar a worker could throw a sponge at his boss; for five 
dollars a worker could jam it in the boss's face, with whipped cream. I did not 
participate in this." 
</P>
<P>
The recreation supervisor told The Times that he went public because the party 
was conducted at a time when "it's very difficult to get some things done in 
the park where I supervise. . . . It seems they can't come to the park to 
repair things but they do go to these fund-raisers." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said the lawsuit represents much ado about nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"A good deal of it is in the eye of the beholder," the county's top executive 
said. "Clearly it is the county's policy to pretty strongly encourage its 
employees to contribute . . . because the health and service goals of the 
United Way and the Brotherhood Crusade are close to those of the county." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon denied that donations are a specific factor in rating his managers for 
bonuses and promotions. "On the other hand," he added, "if it is a (county 
Board of Supervisors) policy that people support their community and increase 
their productivity . . . obviously our managers are expected to espouse county 
policies and hopefully, good leaders will have a substantial following." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon contends that those bringing the suit have a hidden agenda. "There is 
substantial reason to believe" that the lawsuit is an outgrowth of a management 
disagreement between county officials and a union representing Department of 
Public Works employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd says it is the county that has an ulterior motive. 
</P>
<P>
The politically conservative Board of Supervisors, he says, believes that "it 
is cheaper for them to have charitable organizations providing public services 
. . . than to provide public services through the public government."

RAPE SUSPECT SURRENDERS TO SWAT TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man suspected of raping and kidnaping a 19-year old woman was arrested Sunday 
after police surrounded a house in South San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, Jose Luis Estrada, 32, surrendered after a SWAT team was summoned, 
ending a 3 1/2-hour standoff in the 2200 block of Conifer Avenue, according to 
San Diego police spokesman Bill Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
The incident ended peacefully when Estrada surrendered at 4:45 p.m. to a 
bilingual police detective, Carlos Chacon. Officers were attempting to 
determine if Chacon was armed during the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada is suspected of the rape and kidnaping of a 19-year-old woman that 
occurred on Saturday evening in the same area where Estrada was apprehended, 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim told police she was able to escape after being repeatedly raped and 
beaten. She was treated at Chula Vista Community Hospital, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada was being questioned by police Sunday evening, Robinson said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN KILLED IN FIGHT AT VAN NUYS HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 31-year-old transient was shot to death early Sunday morning at a Van Nuys 
house that neighbors say is often used for prostitution and selling narcotics, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys police, who had been alerted by a witness, arrived about 4:45 a.m. and 
found the victim's body in the living room of a house in the 15800 block of 
Marlin Place, said homicide Detective Jim Vojtecky. 
</P>
<P>
The victim's name was withheld pending notification of his family. Vojtecky 
said he was killed by one shotgun blast to his upper body. 
</P>
<P>
William Scott Carter, 27, an acquaintance of the victim who lives at the house, 
was arrested several hours later on suspicion of murder. He was being held 
without bail at the Van Nuys jail. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that 15 people were at the house smoking rock cocaine 
when an argument, either about drugs or a woman, broke out between Carter and 
the victim. The victim armed himself with a knife and Carter pulled out a 
shotgun, firing one round, Vojtecky said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Carter fled, an anonymous caller tipped police to his whereabouts and 
he was arrested at another house in Van Nuys a short time later, police said.

ZOO PLAYS CUPID TO MOTHER NATURE

<P>
TRINITY, Jersey, Channel Islands 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some might consider it arcane that tape-recorded thunderstorms act as an 
aphrodisiac for the Majorcan toad. 
</P>
<P>
But not Quentin Bloxam. Nor, one assumes, the toads. 
</P>
<P>
Bloxam is a senior curator at the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust, better 
known locally as, simply, the Jersey Zoo, and he's spent 25 years learning the 
amorous secrets of some of nature's more obscure creatures. 
</P>
<P>
That's because his employer is no ordinary zoo. Instead of lions, tigers and 
giraffes, the tenants here are Round Island boas, cheetahs, pink pigeons and 
partula snails. 
</P>
<P>
Founded 30 years ago by author and naturalist Gerald Durrell, the Jersey Zoo is 
a pioneer in captive breeding programs meant to preserve rare and endangered 
species of mammals, birds and reptiles. And it claims the most extensive 
collection of such species anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The zoo's symbol is the dodo, the flightless, turkey-like bird from the Indian 
Ocean island of Mauritius that became extinct in the 17th Century. There's a 
Dodo Cafe here, a Dodo Dispatch newsletter and replicas of the strange-looking 
bird everywhere one gazes on the preserve. They're reminders of what could 
happen to 50 other endangered species that call Jersey home if it weren't for 
the trust and a growing network of more conventional North American, European 
and other zoos that now cooperate in captive breeding programs. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, the goal of these programs is to rebuild the supply of a rare species 
to the point where it can be reintroduced into the wild. In fact, that's not 
practical for most, because the same elements that threatened to make them 
extinct in the first place still exist in their indigenous homes. 
</P>
<P>
There are exceptions -- such as the pink pigeon, which has been bred in 
captivity and reintroduced to the Maccabbe forest area of Mauritius; or the 
reddish-maned golden lion tamarin, raised in Jersey and several American zoos 
and returned recently to Brazil's Poco das Antas Biological Reserve; and 
Quentin Bloxam's Majorcan toads, which have been prospering with the help of 
his artificial rainstorms and tape-recorded thunder. 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy being a midwife to Mother Nature, Bloxam said. Take the case of 
the Round Island boa, indigenous to an island off Mauritius but now believed to 
be the world's rarest snake. The boa is threatened to the verge of extinction 
by rabbits that apparently destroy its eggs and habitat. Early explorers 
introduced the rabbits to provide for future shipwrecked mariners. 
</P>
<P>
Field workers for the trust captured 11 specimens and transported them to 
Jersey between 1977 and 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"It took us two years to perfect the management of them," said Bloxam, who is 
in charge of the reptile collection. "Then we had to try and get them to 
breed." 
</P>
<P>
Dietary experimentation finally worked, and in 1982 the first infant Round 
Island boas were hatched. They died in a matter of weeks, and it wasn't until 
1985 that more came along. 
</P>
<P>
Bloxam and his team first had to find a substitute for the baby lizards that 
the tiny snakes would have eaten in the wild, and then force-feed them, a 
process comparable to spending 90 minutes repeatedly searching for the mouth of 
a wiggling shoelace. 
</P>
<P>
By two years ago, the Jersey staff had perfected its techniques sufficiently -- 
feeding time was down to 20 minutes per shoelace -- that it could afford to 
ship three of the rare reptiles to a Canadian zoo. 
</P>
<P>
But Bloxam said the snakes died at their new home. "That didn't please me too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
Now he's about to try again, loaning four snakes from his expanding collection 
to the Dallas zoo. But this time Bloxam has spent three weeks training a 
reptile keeper from the Dallas zoo, and the reptile curator is also coming for 
a two-day introduction to the species. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to get somebody else breeding them," said Bloxam. "I don't like the 
fact that we are the only ones." 
</P>
<P>
A nonprofit operation, the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust operates on a 
budget of about 1 million British pounds a year, equivalent to $1.6 million at 
the current rate of exchange. That supports about 1,500 individual animals, 
birds and reptiles kept on 25 acres of manicured parkland, as well as an 
ambitious educational program for local schoolchildren and visiting student 
conservationists. 
</P>
<P>
The trust's money comes from public admissions to the zoo ($5 for an adult), 
donations, bequests and proceeds from a gift shop and the Dodo Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
One of its fund-raising gimmicks is to offer its animals for adoption. A 
"foster parent" pays an annual fee roughly equal to the cost of feeding an 
animal and in return receives a small brass identifying plaque on its cage. The 
donor also gets a photograph of the animal and periodic news reports from the 
zoo on its progress and activities. 
</P>
<P>
Costs range from the equivalent of $800 annually for a lowland gorilla to $12 
for a partula snail, from Moorea Island in French Polynesia. And the program is 
so popular that there is a waiting list to adopt most species. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment we've only got snails available," Jersey Zoo guide coordinator 
Michelle Curwood said apologetically. 
</P>
<P>
However, chimed in reptile expert Bloxam, snails do have their advantages. You 
don't have to determine the sex of a snail to breed it, for example. 
</P>
<P>
"They're hermaphrodites," Bloxam pointed out. "That problem doesn't matter so 
long as you have two."

FRAUD SUIT PARALLELS U.S. PROBE OF ATTORNEYS; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE: LAWYERS ACCUSED OF CONSPIRING TO FATTEN THEIR FEES FACE BOTH A 
PRIVATE LAWSUIT AND A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Allegations of fraud and racketeering in a lawsuit scheduled for trial next 
week in U. S. District Court in Los Angeles mirror those in a federal criminal 
investigation of lawyers purportedly involved in an elaborate insurance fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance giant USF &amp; G is accusing the main defendant in the civil case, 
attorney Lynn Boyd Stites, 44, of conspiring to prolong and expand litigation 
in order to collect legal fees from insurers -- to the point of trying to 
prevent the dismissal of a suit against an Orange County business insured by 
USF &amp; G. USF &amp; G is seeking $6 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Stites, who lives in Bell Canyon in eastern Ventura County, could not be 
reached for comment, but his lawyers have contended in court papers that his 
"litigation activities were altogether proper." 
</P>
<P>
USF &amp; G's claims against Stites echo allegations being pursued by federal 
authorities in San Diego, who are investigating an alleged insurance billing 
scheme involving a network of lawyers, mostly from the San Fernando Valley, 
West Los Angeles and Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Although Stites has not been charged there, prosecutors say he masterminded a 
scheme in which attorneys conspired to lengthen litigation and fatten their 
fees through various legal maneuvers, such as filing spurious suits against one 
anothers' clients to increase defense fees, and paying kickbacks to clients for 
the right to defend them at the expense of insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
With the civil trial scheduled to begin Oct. 31, the criminal investigation is 
casting a long shadow on the USF &amp; G case. Some unusual effects have 
resulted: 
</P>
<P>
* In the USF &amp; G case, more than a dozen potential witnesses, most of them 
lawyers, refused to answer questions in pretrial depositions, invoking their 
Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Many of those who took 
the Fifth are targets of the criminal investigation in San Diego, including 
Stites and his defense lawyers, Alan I. Arnold of Woodland Hills and Gregory S. 
Bodell of West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
* Stites' lawyers sought to use the depositions as a window on the activities 
of the criminal investigators -- spying on those who had spied on the lawyers. 
They recently took depositions of three men who had no involvement in the 
Stites-USF &amp; G dispute but who had worked undercover with federal 
authorities, secretly recording conversations with Stites, Arnold and other 
targets of the probe. 
</P>
<P>
The three -- San Diego attorney Leonard Radomile and two of Radomile's clients, 
businessmen John Naslund and Wayne Watson -- were questioned by Stites' lawyers 
about which conversations they taped and where they concealed their recording 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
* Earlier this month, U. S. District Judge Harry L. Hupp ruled one defendant, 
Stites Professional Law Corp., in default because Lynn Stites, citing the Fifth 
Amendment, refused to turn over tax returns and other records sought by USF 
&amp; G. The default means that the law corporation could be liable for damages 
to USF &amp; G even if Stites and the other defendants are exonerated in the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
* This summer, the U. S. attorney's office in San Diego filed court papers in 
the USF &amp; G case seeking to delay the deposition of a potential witness who 
may also testify in the criminal case. The delay, which was denied, was sought 
"to prevent interference with the criminal proceedings," the government said. 
Stites' lawyers also asked that the civil trial be delayed until the "almost 
identical criminal proceeding in San Diego" is completed, but Hupp refused. 
</P>
<P>
It was 10 years ago this month that a suspicious jewelry theft gave birth to 
the dispute in the USF &amp; G case. 
</P>
<P>
The supposed victims of the $2-million theft were Robert A. and Tiare Ogle, 
operators of Newport Galleries, a jewelry business in Newport Beach. The Ogles 
had taken jewelry on consignment to sell in Saudi Arabia. In October, 1979, 
after buying $2 million in insurance from Lloyds of London to cover the trip, 
they set off for Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
On the way, the Ogles stopped at the Cockatoo Inn in Hawthorne for a farewell 
dinner with friends. As they were leaving the building, witnesses said, armed 
robbers accosted them and took the jewels. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Ogle had an extensive police record, and police and Lloyds of London 
-- after examining such things as the Ogles' deficient travel documents and 
their history of being robbed of insured jewels -- concluded that the robbery 
was a hoax. No criminal charges were filed against the Ogles in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
In one of a dozen lawsuits filed against Newport Galleries and the Ogles by 
those who lost their jewels, an Orange County Superior Court judge agreed. "The 
entire trip to Saudi Arabia was a sham," Judge Robert J. Polis wrote. "It never 
could have happened as planned and was never intended to occur. The robbery was 
staged and probably nothing of value was stolen." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Galleries had a general liability policy with USF &amp; G that did not 
cover theft. But the insurance company agreed to pay for the legal defense of 
Newport Galleries and the Ogles pending a court determination of its duties 
under the policy. 
</P>
<P>
To represent Newport Galleries and themselves, the Ogles hired Stites and 
several of his associates, who were paid about $400,000 by USF &amp; G, court 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
One of the lawsuits was brought by owners of a $17,000 diamond bracelet. Their 
lawyer was Paul Mast, a former Orange County Municipal Court judge. Run ragged 
by the defense team, Mast in 1983 made a written offer to drop the suit, which 
was proving too costly to pursue considering the size of his clients' loss. 
</P>
<P>
But victory was not what Stites had in mind, Mast said later. On July 20, 1983, 
over lunch at the Velvet Turtle in Long Beach, Stites and West Los Angeles 
lawyer William Conkle, a former Stites partner who represented the Ogles, 
proposed that Mast keep the suit alive. 
</P>
<P>
Mast later testified in a deposition that he told Stites and Conkle "that they 
had worn me down" and "that we were willing to give up and just get out of the 
case." 
</P>
<P>
But Mast said his hosts "informed me that the defense of the action was now 
being paid for by USF &amp; G, an insurance company," that "never questioned 
the bill." They wanted the case to go to trial, "and they were going to do 
everything they possibly could to make the trial last as long as possible," 
Mast said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the lunch, USF &amp; G seemed on the verge of winning a court 
ruling that it had no duty to defend Newport Galleries and the Ogles. But 
according to Mast, Stites had a plan to keep the insurer on the hook. 
</P>
<P>
Mast said his hosts described the following scenario: Instead of dropping the 
suit, Mast would amend it to claim that his clients had suffered emotional 
distress and other damages covered by the USF &amp; G policy. Stites would help 
by reviewing and rewriting the amended complaint before Mast filed it to make 
certain that it fit within insurance coverage. The case would proceed to trial, 
Mast would be allowed to win, and USF &amp; G would probably refuse to pay the 
judgment. Both sides then would hit the insurer with bad-faith suits. "And . . 
. in those lawsuits we would be able to clean up against USF &amp; G," Mast 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The "purpose of the lunch was to solicit me to engage in a conspiracy to 
defraud USF &amp; G by continuing the lawsuit for the purpose of building up 
attorneys' fees . . . and . . . to set USF &amp; G up for a bad-faith lawsuit 
that, in the words of Mr. Conkle and Mr. Stites, we would all derive an 
extremely large amount of money from," Mast testified in the deposition. 
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Mast went back to his office and wrote his clients a 
letter to tell them what had transpired. 
</P>
<P>
Later in 1983, a judge ruled that USF &amp; G had no duty to defend Newport 
Galleries and the Ogles. USF &amp; G asked Stites to submit any unpaid bills. 
Stites suddenly produced bills for another $350,000, which the firm refused to 
pay when the bills were not substantiated, according to USF &amp; G. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Stites sued USF &amp; G over the unpaid bills. It was in that suit, 
which was later dismissed, that Mast gave his explosive account of the lunch. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, USF &amp; G filed the fraud suit against Stites, Conkle and 
other lawyers involved in defending Newport Galleries and the Ogles. Some of 
the defendants were later dismissed, including Conkle, who reached an 
undisclosed settlement with USF &amp; G. 
</P>
<P>
In a sworn declaration, Stites acknowledged having lunch with Mast but said 
Mast's "contentions as to what occurred at that meeting are untrue." 
</P>
<P>
But aside from Mast, three other lawyers who sued Newport Galleries on behalf 
of jewelry owners said they were advised by either Conkle or Stites to amend 
their complaints to add claims of emotional distress. None of the lawyers 
amended the suits. 
</P>
<P>
In court papers, Stites said it is worth noting that four lawyers maintained 
that they were approached "to amend their pleadings; . . . none of them did 
so." 
</P>
<P>
So even if such an attempt ever occurred -- which it did not, the court papers 
said -- USF &amp; G would have suffered no damages as a result, Stites said. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent pretrial conference, lawyers for USF &amp; G said they will also 
present evidence about other cases in which a "Stites Network" of lawyers 
joined to "defraud various insurance companies" by billing "excessive, 
unnecessary and fraudulent attorneys' fees for their own illicit gain." 
</P>
<P>
The language is strikingly similar to that used by federal authorities in San 
Diego to describe the criminal probe, which has targeted about 30 lawyers and 
associates of lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
In court papers filed in the USF &amp; G case, Assistant U. S. Atty. George D. 
Hardy, who is heading the San Diego inquiry, said the criminal investigation 
involves "a network of lawyers and associates . . . who have systematically and 
with great deliberation" inserted themselves in complex cases to generate big 
bills. "The total potential loss has been alleged to be between $50 million and 
$200 million." 
</P>
<P>
Stites hit back at Hardy in pleadings filed in the USF &amp; G case, dismissing 
him as "the former insurance industry counsel" -- a reference to Hardy's prior 
work at a private law firm that had insurance clients. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy said indictments in the criminal case are expected before the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal investigation began in Los Angeles in 1987 but shifted to San 
Diego late last year. Since then, one lawyer and two employees of targeted law 
firms have pleaded guilty to mail fraud charges and have agreed to assist 
federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent conviction came last week when Studio City lawyer Marc I. Kent, 
40, pleaded guilty to two mail fraud counts and agreed to surrender his license 
to practice law. 
</P>
<P>
During that appearance in federal court in San Diego, Kent, a Granada Hills 
resident, said Stites brought him into the scheme about 1984. He said that 
Stites sent insured clients to him and other attorneys, that the attorneys 
would file counterclaims against one another's clients to generate more defense 
fees, and that they would kick back part of their insurance billings to Stites.

AA CHAPTER FIGHTS TO KEEP STUDIO CITY MEETING HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alcoholics Anonymous is battling a Los Angeles zoning administrator's order 
that its North Hollywood chapter vacate a former church building in Studio City 
where it has met for 43 years. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the controversy is the Grove Assn., which maintains that 
people who attend AA meetings clog quiet neighborhood streets with their cars 
and sometimes urinate in front yards and pass out on front porches. 
</P>
<P>
AA officials vehemently deny the neighborhood group's claims and are appealing 
Associate Zoning Administrator Jon Perica's ruling that the organization must 
find a new location for the chapter. The issue is to be heard by the Board of 
Zoning Appeals on Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
The chapter has been so successful at drawing alcoholics to its meetings that 
the one-story building at the end of Radford Avenue cannot accommodate the 
crowds, Perica and the residents say. The chapter has grown from about 40 
members when it was founded in 1946 to about 200. 
</P>
<P>
Grove Assn. members say they are not discounting the good work the chapter has 
done. But that work has been overshadowed by the problems that people attending 
AA meetings have brought into the neighborhood, where many houses are worth 
$500,000 and up, the residents say. 
</P>
<P>
AA officials have a different point of view. After all, they say, the 
organization was there before the homeowners and has a right to remain in the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"This is life and death for the people who come here," said Evelyn Carruthers, 
manager of the building and a member of the group. "We have nothing against our 
neighbors, but we can't see closing this place down instead of saving peoples' 
lives. We're going to fight this to the end." 
</P>
<P>
Being forced to move out of the brown building -- in a cul-de-sac that borders 
a city flood control channel -- would be tantamount to closing the chapter, 
because the AA cannot afford to move, said J.C. Phillips, trustee of the 
chapter. 
</P>
<P>
"This is only a small proportion of residents who are against us," Phillips 
said. "Most of Studio City supports us." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, representatives of the Studio City Chamber of Commerce and the Studio 
City Residents Assn. support having the AA chapter stay put. "We don't want 
them thrown out, but parking has to be found somewhere," said Polly Ward, 
president of the Studio City association. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips blamed some of the parking, traffic and loitering problems on other 
businesses on the street, such as CBS Studios. "It's amazing how these folks 
who complain can look at a car or a person and tell they're from AA," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the studios could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips admitted that some of those attending meetings may have been loud as 
they arrived or left meetings. "But are these neighbors going to tell my guests 
not to hang out on the sidewalk?" he said. "Do I tell their guests to quiet 
down?" 
</P>
<P>
Residents have complained for years about crowds that come to the chapter six 
days a week. The building is open from 11 a.m to 11 p.m. Monday through Friday. 
Meetings are held Tuesday through Saturday afternoon from noon to 1:30 p.m., 
and Tuesday through Saturday evenings from 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors say those drawn to the AA meetings have taken up almost all street 
parking for blocks around the meeting hall, and have left trash and bottles in 
yards and streets. Cars have raced down the streets, they complain. And some 
attendees, residents say, have urinated on lawns, passed out on porches and 
curbs or have threatened and cursed residents. 
</P>
<P>
"Please understand, the homeowners are totally compassionate and supportive of 
AA," said Rene Gunther, who has lived in the area for five years. "This is not 
a lynch mob to get AA. 
</P>
<P>
"But we have compromised with them as much as we can," she said. "They are not 
an asset anymore, and they have abused the privilege of being here. They are a 
detriment to property values. They have to move, as much for their benefit as 
for ours." 
</P>
<P>
But chapter officials say they already have made concessions to the 
neighborhood, including cutting back the number of weekend meetings from four 
to one. They say that members are asked to be quiet when entering and leaving 
the neighborhood and that 200 people are seldom at the building at one time, as 
some neighbors have contended. 
</P>
<P>
The AA group began operating in the building in March, 1946, just two months 
before Los Angeles enacted zoning laws that prevented the establishment of 
meeting halls in residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Perica ruled in June that the chapter had to find another meeting hall within a 
year. He also ruled that the chapter had to make arrangements for off-street 
parking or vacate by August. His rulings were held in abeyance, however, when 
the AA appealed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that this chapter saves lives," he said. "But there are real 
problems. They have people coming in who are trying to kick serious habits but 
haven't quite done it yet. These folks will drink their bottles of vodka 
outside and throw them on the street before going to the meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Sally Daley, who has lived in the area for 30 years, said: 'This used to be a 
quiet neighborhood when there were only a few meetings a week. We moved here 
because of the kind of community it was. But it keeps getting worse and worse." 
</P>
<P>
Others are more torn by the conflict. Bill Moloney, who has lived in the 
neighborhood for less than a year, said both of his parents were alcoholics. 
His said his father died of acute alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be loving and supportive. . . . I'm astonished at their success," he 
said of the AA chapter. "I just feel that they need to recognize they've 
outgrown that place."

From his point of view, Johnson in his "A Return to Colton" tells in graphic 
detail how Los Angeles-produced smog has nearly destroyed his hometown. From my 
point of view as a Los Angeles resident, I see my air fouled and streets 
clogged by endless hordes of suburban commuters who are coming into the city 
from ever-longer distances. 
</P>
<P>
So I'll make all the suburbanites who feel they have been victimized by smog 
from Los Angeles a deal: I'll keep my daily commute under 10 miles if they will 
also do the same.

<P>
In response to "A Step for World Safety, If East Bloc Is Serious," by Ernest 
Conine, Op-Ed Page, Oct. 17: 
</P>
<P>
Conine goes into all kinds of reasons that the Russians want to join with the 
United States to fight international terrorism, something at which they have no 
peer. However, "In view of the nationalist fervor now sweeping the Soviet Union 
. . . " describes the true -- and sole -- reason for their sudden change of 
heart towards terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
The Russians will simply tag the term "terrorist" to describe nationalist 
freedom fighters who want to free their once-independent countries from the 
Russian stranglehold. Will the U.S. participate in helping the Russians put 
down a fight for the independence these people have waited and fought for so 
long? Will everyone who ever wanted to regain self-determination be 
automatically labeled a "terrorist?" 
</P>
<P>
I am certain that few freedom-striving people would want to spill their own 
(and other people's) blood in the quest for independence, but they will if they 
have to. Nothing comes easy, especially your freedom. Where will the U.S. stand 
on this issue?

<P>
It never ceases to amaze me just how ignorant our so-called "experts" are when 
it concerns current activities within the Soviet Union. Someone who certainly 
should know better, RAND-UCLA Soviet study center's Arnold Horelick, is of the 
mistaken mind-set that the Soviet Union is a single country. His statements are 
to the effect that Gorbachev "is responding to the growing chaos . . . to get 
some stability and order into the country" (my emphasis). If Horelick did his 
homework, he would know that there never existed any stability at all since 
Russians forced themselves into their neighboring countries. I know that 
Horelick is referring to rising nationalism. But this is nothing new. Since 
1917, when the new Russian empire emerged, there have been nationalist 
uprisings continuously -- some on a large-scale and some on a small-scale. Our 
well-informed Western press chose not to publicize this. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union was established on an extremely shaky foundation. Frankly, 
there is no foundation at all. Because this "union" consists of forceably 
unwilling participants, chaos is simply the nature of things. The more 
restrictive the Russian government gets with their charges, the more massive 
the nationalist demonstrations. The Russians can use more powerful tear gas or 
truncheons, but this just results in a better organized demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
If the Russians had any smarts (and they don't), they would stop beating the 
proverbial "dead horse" and give up control of those who will not respond to 
their bidding. If they do respond, it will be with stronger demonstrations and 
violence.

Your story (Part A, Oct. 14) about $433,000 of U.S. taxpayer money being given 
to the opponents of Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez by the Republican 
Party's international institute is hair-raising, to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting political opponents of Central America's only democratic leader and 
a Nobel Peace Prize winner, to boot, is improper on its face. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, why is an American political party in charge of disbursing U.S. 
taxpayer money at all?

BEVERLY HILLS BOARD AND TEACHERS RESUME TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Striking teachers and school officials in Beverly Hills reopened contract talks 
Sunday evening after meeting earlier in the day with parents who urged them to 
settle their week-old labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Micelli, who hosted the meeting between the teachers union, district 
representatives and about 150 parents at his home, said there were "no barbs at 
all" exchanged among those who attended. 
</P>
<P>
Contract negotiations resumed at district headquarters at 6:30 p.m. and 
continued late Sunday night with a a state mediator sitting in. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope both sides come out of it with red eyes, saying they made some 
progress, and that the teachers are back in school on Tuesday," Micelli said. 
</P>
<P>
The new talks culminated a weekend of escalating tension that saw parents 
launch a petition drive urging school officials to negotiate with teachers, who 
began their strike last Monday over wages and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday and Sunday, parents walked their neighborhoods and the city's 
business district with the petition, which asks the Beverly Hills Unified 
School District to "explore creative financial alternatives" to finance raises 
for the teachers, and to begin round-the-clock talks. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting Saturday night, also at Micelli's home, some members of a newly 
formed group of parents, Children First, said they might later push to recall 
the school board. "We are not going to forget," Ada Horwich, one of the 
organizers, told the standing-room-only crowd of 150, which included some 
teachers and students. 
</P>
<P>
Gershon Lesser, who also called for ouster of the "arrogant" school board, said 
that during the strike his three children have been "home sick with the flu, 
and they'll probably have the flu for a long time because it's a very bad 
virus." 
</P>
<P>
Some parents, however, said a recall campaign would merely make school 
officials more defensive. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers are seeking an 18% pay raise over two years. A mediation session last 
Wednesday collapsed shortly after it began, with the district sticking to its 
position that it can only afford an 11% raise.

WORLD SERIES PUSHED BACK TILL FRIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The World Series is already a memory, more so by the day. It's not even over 
and may not be until November. 
</P>
<P>
Game 3 will now be Friday -- three days later than expected -- in the 
earthquake-ravaged Bay Area. The delay stretches the layoff to a record 11 days 
and pushes a possible Game 7 to Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball commissioner Fay Vincent, in a joint statement Sunday with San 
Francisco mayor Art Agnos, said the city will not be ready to play Tuesday, as 
originally hoped. 
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed that baseball should resume with enthusiasm this coming week, 
but we also agreed that Tuesday was too ambitious," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants meet again, they 
each will have played just two games in nearly three weeks -- both won by 
Oakland. A World Series thrives on momentum, and this one lost it last Tuesday 
at 5:04 p.m. PDT, 30 minutes before the start of Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone admits the games won't be the same. But Vincent and Agnos say the 
World Series should be finished, even if it's two weeks late, provided it's 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
The city needs to test its ability to handle traffic -- the Bay Bridge, the 
very symbol of the series, is closed after a partial collapse -- needs to line 
up adequate security and, most importantly, must make sure Candlestick Park is 
safe. Vincent and Agnos said they expect everything to be ready by the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We would not come to you and say we'll play Friday unless there was a high 
certainty we could play then," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said he has not yet met with Mayor Lionel Wilson of Oakland, the site 
of the deadly freeway collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very busy man," Vincent said, adding he doesn't think there will be a 
problem with playing in the Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Games 3 and 4 and, if necessary, Game 5, will be played during the weekend at 
Candlestick Park. Monday would be an off-day and the Series would finish at 
Oakland Coliseum with Game 6 Tuesday and Game 7 Wednesday, Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
All games will be played at their original starting times, each approximately 
at 5:30 p.m., PDT. 
</P>
<P>
Should the series go beyond five games, it would be baseball's latest ending 
ever. The Dodgers won the 1981 World Series on Oct. 28, ending a strike-marred 
year that included an extra round of playoffs because of the split-season. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent admitted baseball considered canceling the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"We did give it some thought," he said, but strongly emphasized, "We will 
finish this Series right here. It is no longer appropriate to think about 
moving this Series, nor is it appropriate to think about canceling this 
Series." 
</P>
<P>
Agnos agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Cable cars are running, the opera is performing, conventions are starting, the 
(San Francisco) 49ers are playing. We've even had our first protest 
demonstration and that's a sure sign of things returning to normal in San 
Francisco," he said. "It's time to go on." 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco 49ers were scheduled to play New England at Candlestick Park 
on Sunday, but the National Football League game was moved to Stanford Stadium 
in Palo Alto for fan safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants held a one-hour workout at Candlestick on Sunday while the Athletics 
practiced at the Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to play, but they recognize these are different times," Athletics' 
general manager Sandy Alderson said. "I'm certain it creates problems for your 
pitching, for motivation." 
</P>
<P>
"Now that there is a definite date, the players will respond to it," Giants' 
general manager Al Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
But many players, already restless after a week-long break that was the longest 
in series history, might not agree. 
</P>
<P>
"Any further delay will make it really difficult," Giants' pitcher Kelly Downs 
said earlier Sunday while teammates speculated about another setback. "If they 
delay it again, it will take a lot of wind out of it. It's been hard enough to 
get back up already." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent did not meet with Agnos to discuss the World Series until Saturday 
night. They talked again Sunday, and all along Vincent said baseball knew it 
was a low priority in the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"The first stage of the emergency has been completed, and that was dealing with 
victims, finding food and shelter," Agnos said. "For most San Franciscans, the 
shock and the grief have just begun to wear off." 
</P>
<P>
Agnos said he now has time for other issues, including the World Series. But 
before it resumes, he wanted certain conditions met. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to have an ironclad assurance that (Candlestick Park) is safe for 
people to use and could withstand another earthquake and protect people as it 
did the first," he said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials will examine the ballpark Monday and make a final report. 
</P>
<P>
Agnos also wants to make sure the area's roadways could carry the World Series 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll get our first test tomorrow of our ability to handle traffic. We'll see 
how we do and we'll work out adjustments for Friday's game," Agnos said. 
</P>
<P>
Agnos wanted assurances from the police department there are enough people to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been told 250 officers, more than twice what is needed at Candlestick, 
would be available," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said the chances of the World Series being cancelled or moved out of 
the Bay area are "totally unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
"The people of San Francisco waited 27 years for this World Series, and what I 
think we're doing is giving them what they've waited for," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
"My judgment is that this community is better served by playing the World 
Series. But we did consider canceling it. We did give it some thought." 
</P>
<P>
Agnos added: "So did I." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, when Game 3 when still tentatively set for Tuesday, Vincent 
said he preferred that there would not be an off-day once the series resumed. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said the teams will not play next Monday because, "Monday hasn't been a 
day the World Series played." 
</P>
<P>
The reason for that, however, is because baseball has not wanted to get into a 
television competition with Monday night football, although it did happen in 
1986, when rain pushed back Game 7 between the Boston Red Sox and New York 
Mets. 
</P>
<P>
ABC, which has television rights to the World Series, also televises the NFL's 
Monday night package and is scheduled to show the game between the Minnesota 
Vikings and New York Giants.

SERIES LOSES LUSTER, NOT IMPORTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The word most overworked by members of the World Series rival San Francisco 
Giants and Oakland Athletics in reaction to the devastating Bay Area earthquake 
has been perspective. 
</P>
<P>
As in: "This puts everything in perspective. This proves how meaningless 
baseball is." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, many of those same players can be expected to reshape that 
perspective when their contracts come up for negotiation, but this isn't about 
cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
It's about perspective and the need for it again in the wake of Sunday's 
decision by baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent and San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos 
to delay restarting the already delayed World Series from Tuesday to Friday. 
</P>
<P>
By any perspective, it should be clear now that the World Series of 1989 is 
nothing more than a symbol for the Bay Area. A beacon, of sort, on the road to 
recovery. A start on the healing process. 
</P>
<P>
To think of it in any other terms would be a fallacy. In no way can this World 
Series still be considered a championship test. If baseball had been interested 
in preserving the integrity of the Series -- rather than preserving it's 
historical streak and providing the Bay Area with an alternative to the 
earthquake updates -- then it would have dismissed a further delay and declared 
that the A's, who lead the best-of-seven event, 2-0, as Series champions. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the 1989 Series will always carry an asterisk denoting that it was an 
exhibition event at championship prices played for the psychic benefit of the 
Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
How else can it be catalogued? The A's and Giants, come Friday, will not have 
played for 12 days. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stewart and Scott Garrelts, the Game 1 starters who will be rematched in 
Game 3, will not have pitched for 13 days. 
</P>
<P>
Is this anticlimactic or what? How appropriate that the A's, because of 
inclement weather in the Bay Area, are considering spending the week at their 
spring training base in Phoenix. The Cactus League schedule gets started again 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
None of this is a knock at Agnos or Vincent. They are trying to deal with 
obvious priorities amid tragic circumstances. It's just that there's a need now 
to put this twice delayed Series in perspective, to call it what it is. 
</P>
<P>
As Giants' catcher Terry Kennedy said Sunday: "Everyday we don't play it gets a 
little harder. Hopefully the intensity will return, but I can't say it will be 
the same." 
</P>
<P>
Said batterymate Kelly Downs: "It's been hard enough to get back up, and this 
takes that much more wind out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Even Oakland General Manager Sandy Alderson said: "I think the players 
understand, but this certainly creates problems for pitching and motivation." 
</P>
<P>
Does it figure to affect the outcome, however significant that outcome now is? 
</P>
<P>
Probably not, although the Giants will benefit from the new delay. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Mitchell has been nursing a sore wrist for more than two months, Robby 
Thompson has been handicaped some by a sore shoulder and Will Clark was hit by 
a cold and laryngitis last week. 
</P>
<P>
Garrelts, who gave up five runs in four innings of Game 1 and later complained 
of a sore elbow, has recovered sufficiently to be able to start Game 3, which 
will be played 10 days after being postponed by Tuesday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Reuschel, who started Game 2, will go in Game 4 and Don Robinson, who had 
been scheduled for Game 3, will drop back to Game 5, if it is needed. 
</P>
<P>
The A's, however, demonstrated in the first two games that they are clearly the 
deeper and dominate team and will be favored to close out the Giants before the 
weekend is over, salvaging a measure of prestige from a Series that should have 
erased their disappointment of last year and enhanced their claim to the title 
of baseball's best. 
</P>
<P>
The A's still may get the sweep, but it will encompass 15 days. A timetable of 
that type might handicap some teams with the A's power, their big bashers 
losing timing, but Rickey Henderson provides the A's with a self-contained 
scoring machine, and the A's know how to play little ball, in addition to long 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Stewart, who complained at times during the second half of a tired 
shoulder and should benefit from the delay. 
</P>
<P>
The new schedule is such that if the Series goes seven games it will end in 
November, and if it goes longer than five it will end later than any Series 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
The 1981 Series between the Dodgers and New York Yankees, which started later 
because of the double playoff format adopted in that strike season, ended Oct. 
28, the current Series mark for latest closing. 
</P>
<P>
Did Agnos and Vincent consider canceling it? 
</P>
<P>
Only briefly, they said, adding that neither money nor television were the 
motivating factors. To give in, to cancel, they said would have been to 
foreclose on the spirit of the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
"Life goes on," Agnos said, pointing out that the cable cars are back running, 
the opera is performing and conventions are gearing up again. 
</P>
<P>
Said Vincent: "This city waited 27 years for a World Series, and that's what 
we're going to give it." 
</P>
<P>
In reality, hope and healing seem to be what baseball is providing. 
</P>
<P>
The perspective here is that it's a World Series in name only.

LAS PALMAS HANDICAP; 
</P>
<P>
NIKISHKA IS TONIC FOR DELAHOUSSAYE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye is getting well. Antibiotics and fast horses have been the 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
Delahoussaye gets the antibiotics from his doctor, the horses from trainers 
such as Jerry Fanning and Joe Cannon. On Saturday, riding Fanning's Present 
Value for the first time, Delahoussaye brought the 5-year-old home a winner in 
the Goodwood Handicap at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Cannon turned Nikishka over to Delahoussaye and he rode the 
4-year-old filly to a 3 1/2-length victory in the $164,300 Las Palmas Handicap, 
with the 4-5 favorite, Claire Marine, finishing fourth in the seven-horse 
field. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I've been doing, maybe I should stay sick," Delahoussaye said. 
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old jockey is the leading rider for the Oak Tree season, and 
Sunday's victory gave him victories in half of the 10 stakes that have been 
run, but on Thursday he called in sick. 
</P>
<P>
"I must have caught some kind of a bug that's going around," Delahoussaye said 
Sunday. "I thought he (the doctor) might give me a shot, but instead he put me 
on antibiotics." 
</P>
<P>
Both of Delahoussaye's weekend stakes winners beat odds-on favorites, Present 
Value upsetting Rahy on Saturday. Present Value's victory gave Delahoussaye an 
extra reason to be at Gulfstream Park on Breeders' Cup day on Nov. 4. He'll 
ride that horse in the Classic and he also has mounts on Pleasant Tap in the 
Juvenile, Political Ambition in the Mile, Gorgeous in the Distaff and Prized in 
the Turf Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
Delahoussaye has won only one Breeders' Cup race -- on Princess Rooney in 1984 
-- out of 24 mounts. 
</P>
<P>
"None of my horses this year will be favored, but in those races you never 
know," Delahoussaye said. "There's so much money ($10 million in purses for the 
seven-race program) that you can still do pretty good just by hitting the 
board." 
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron, Claire Marine's jockey, had a reason to fear Nikishka in the 
Las Palmas, because before this year he had been the only rider the Nijinsky 
II-Bendara filly ever had. McCarron, who won three in a row before the Las 
Palmas Sunday, broke Nikishka's maiden at Del Mar in September of 1988. He also 
won two more races with her before she was taken out training for about six 
months because of a bleeding problem. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw Nikishka at Del Mar this year, she impressed the daylights out of 
me," McCarron said. "When she ran last time, I thought she'd beat Brown Bess." 
</P>
<P>
Brown Bess, Northern California's grass star, beat Nikishka by a length in the 
California Jockey Club Handicap at Bay Meadows on Oct. 7. That was only 
Nikishka's third time on grass. 
</P>
<P>
Claire Marine began Sunday with a chance to be voted the best female turf horse 
in the country, having won six of nine starts this year and five of her last 
six, but now she must recoup in the Yellow Ribbon in two weeks in order to 
re-enter the picture. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't offer any excuse," McCarron said. "She seemed comfortable on the turf 
(wet from rain but still considered firm). I wasn't concerned until we hit the 
three-sixteenths pole. Nikishka was responding and my filly wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
No Review finished second, a half-length ahead of Agirlfromars, and it was 
another 1 1/4 lengths back to Claire Marine, whose entrymate, Delighter, 
finished sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Nikishka earned $96,800 for his owner and breeder, Aaron Jones. The crowd of 
24,175 made her the second betting choice and she paid $8.20, $4.60 and $3.60. 
No Review paid $5.40 and $4 and Agirlfromars paid $4.40. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Rahy strained a ligament in his left foreleg while running second in the 
Goodwood Handicap and will be sidelined indefinitely. . . . Trainer Jerry 
Fanning will start Pleasant Variety in the Breeders' Cup Turf in addition to 
running Present Value in the Classic. . . . Jockey Pat Valenzuela's first drug 
test came back negative and he was given another test by the stewards Sunday. 
He hopes to resume riding on Thursday. . . . On the Menu, ridden by Corey 
Black, was disqualified after winning the fourth race. The colt came out at the 
top of the stretch and bumped Ole', who stumbled and threw his jockey, Luis 
Ortega. Ortega was excused from the rest of his mounts but didn't suffer any 
serious injuries.

MORNING BRIEFING: WEARY MASCOT KNOWS HIS TEAM IS OFFENSIVE

<P>
Air Ware means wear and tear for Jason Lee, the University of Houston's mascot. 
</P>
<P>
Every time the Cougars score, Lee must perform a push-up for each point the 
team has at that time. At the end of Saturday's 95-21 victory over Southern 
Methodist, during which Andre Ware threw six touchdown passes in the first 
half, Lee had done 682 push-ups. 
</P>
<P>
"If they scored 100, I could have done it," he said. "I just didn't want to do 
98 (for a field goal)." 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars moved inside the Mustangs' 20-yard line in the closing seconds of 
the game, but Houston's backup quarterback, David Klingler allowed the final 
seven seconds to expire. 
</P>
<P>
Said Lee, who had to do 401 push-ups two weeks ago in a 66-10 victory over 
Baylor: "The last few had me shopping for a coffin. I'll have to start working 
out a little harder." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mike Pede, the former Cougar mascot who started the push-up 
tradition, left the Astrodome smiling. 
</P>
<P>
"I got out just in time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Add blowout: Southern Methodist Coach Forrest Gregg said he wasn't bothered by 
the fact that the Mustangs were 59-point underdogs against Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get roped into point spreads, but it doesn't surprise me," Gregg said. 
"We got beat by Baylor, 49-3, last week and the team we're playing beat them, 
66-10, the week before." 
</P>
<P>
Noms de turf: Jay Ward, creator of "The Bullwinkle Show" who died Oct. 12, got 
plenty of fan mail in the form of thoroughbred names inspired by his cartoon 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
There have been thoroughbreds named Snidely Whiplash, Mr. Peabody, Sherman, 
Natasha, Fearless Leader, Boris Badenuf (perhaps a cousin of Boris Badenov), 
Bullwinkle, Whatsa Matta U., and Rocket J. -- after Rocket J. Squirrel, or 
Rocky the Flying Squirrel. 
</P>
<P>
But Ward, who was owner of Bullwinkle Stable, steered away from his own 
creations when naming his horses. His runners included Chief Duffy, Chief 
Dudley, Chief Hawk Ear, E. Eddie Edwards, Lucky Coloullah and Professor 
McGargle. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What was the last team to sweep a World Series against a team with 
a better regular-season record? 
</P>
<P>
Price of intensity: Skip Novak, American adviser aboard the Fazisi, took over 
the helm of the Soviet Union's entry in the Whitbread round-the-world sailboat 
race when its skipper committed suicide after reaching port in Uruguay 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
Angus Phillips of the Washington Post quotes Novak on the death of Alexei 
Gryshenko, 43: "To me it's just a yacht race, and certainly nothing to kill 
yourself over. But he was very intense and the Russians take this thing 
seriously. To them, it represents the whole future of the new U.S.S.R. Maybe he 
suspected failure." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The 1963 Dodgers (99-63) swept the New York Yankees (104-57). 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Notre Dame quarterback Tony Rice, on USC players celebrating their 
10-point halftime lead at South Bend Saturday by singing the Irish's fight song

USOC MEETING; 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO FACILITY GETS FUNDING AT LAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After voting previously to establish a $42-million training center in San 
Diego, the U.S. Olympic Committee finally signed a contract Sunday with 
representatives from the city. 
</P>
<P>
But the ceremony did not take place until after further debate among USOC 
executive board members, some of whom did not want to proceed with the 
commitment to San Diego until they had a more specific financial impact report. 
</P>
<P>
Although San Diego is raising money to build the state-of-the-art center, the 
USOC will be responsible for its operating costs when it opens in late 1991 or 
early 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the executive board voted without dissent Sunday to reconfirm its 
support of the center. 
</P>
<P>
In a related issue, some executive board members had questions about San 
Diego's ability to finance construction of the center. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the city have been negotiating a $15 million sponsorship 
agreement with ARCO, but that has been jeopardized by the USOC's $3-million 
deal with 3M to serve as a sponsor for all three training centers -- San Diego 
plus the two already operating in Colorado Springs, Colo., and Lake Placid, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
But San Diego representatives convinced the executive board that they will be 
able to acquire alternate financing if they lose ARCO. 
</P>
<P>
In the final session Sunday of its three-day meeting, the executive board also 
approved two short-notice, out-of-competition drug-testing plans recommended by 
the substance-abuse committee, which is chaired by hurdler Edwin Moses. 
</P>
<P>
One will require national governing bodies, the federations for Olympic and Pan 
American Games sports, that cooperate with the plan to establish a pool of 
athletes who will be available for testing at any time during the year with 
only 48 hours notice. 
</P>
<P>
Two national governing bodies, track and field and cycling, already have begun 
similar programs that might be incorporated into the USOC plan. 
</P>
<P>
The executive board also voted to adopt the U.S.-Soviet drug-testing agreement. 
The USOC will select Soviet athletes for testing in Moscow, and the Soviets 
will select U.S. athletes for testing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Moses said that the plan will be put into operation when the USOC is convinced 
that the laboratory in Moscow is as efficient as the one at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from eight other countries, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, West 
Germany, Great Britain, Australia, Canada, South Korea and Italy, will meet in 
Rome on Dec. 12-13 to discuss implementing similar agreements among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Conspicuous by their absence is East Germany," USOC executive director Baaron 
Pittenger said. "They are not as interested in becoming part of this as they 
had indicated previously." 
</P>
<P>
It was a kinder, gentler executive board that met Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The nine multisport, community service organizations, such as the YMCA, the 
YWCA and the Boy Scouts, each have had a vote on the executive board. But on 
Saturday, as the USOC began its reconstruction, the nine were given only three 
votes among them on the new board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Overnight, however, there was a change of heart. Their voting power was 
restored Sunday. Votes also were restored to past presidents, which, in this 
case, applies solely to Robert Kane because he is the only one who still 
attends executive board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Wall, executive director of the U.S. Basketball Federation, told the 
executive board Sunday that the United States might not send men's and women's 
teams to the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
Approached later by reporters, he would not elaborate except to say that the 
problems are not with the Cubans but with the Pan American Sports Organization 
(PASO) in Mexico City and that other countries also are considering not 
entering basketball teams. 
</P>
<P>
USOC President Robert Helmick said that the basketball federations in several 
countries want to share television revenues from the Games but have met 
resistance from PASO. There also have been reports that PASO will not accept 
professional basketball players, who are eligible under international rules. 
</P>
<P>
The "Carol Cady Loophole" was closed Sunday, when the executive board voted to 
bar athletes who are ineligible in one sport from competing in another at the 
Olympics, Pan American Games or Olympic Festivals. 
</P>
<P>
Cady, a shotputter from Stanford, was suspended last winter by The Athletics 
Congress, the national governing body for track and field, because she competed 
in South Africa. But she participated in this summer's Olympic Festival in 
Oklahoma City as a weightlifter. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the U.S. Weightlifting Federation takes similar action, she still is 
eligible for competitions that are not sanctioned by the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
The executive board also voted to bar athletes who compete in South Africa from 
representing the United States in the Olympics, Pan American Games and Olympic 
Festivals. But it tabled a motion to ask the U.S. Olympic Foundation to divest 
its financial holdings in companies that operate in South Africa, an action the 
USOC already has taken. 
</P>
<P>
Of the foundation's $172 million, about 4% is invested in South Africa. 
Helmick, a member of the foundation's board of directors, said that he will 
encourage divestiture at a Nov. 29 meeting in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Also tabled by the executive board was a proposal that would have allowed the 
USOC president to serve two consecutive four-year terms. Helmick said that he 
favors the proposal because it would strengthen the presidency, not because it 
would enable him to run for reelection in 1993. But he said that he was not 
disappointed when action was postponed at least until the February meeting in 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not very important," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Between August, 1987, and December, 1990, the USOC will have spent more than $1 
million on its executive director position. 
</P>
<P>
That includes the $432,000 that it eventually cost to buy out George Miller, 
who was fired on the day after the Pan American Games in Indianapolis ended in 
August, 1987. The USOC recently sold the house it bought from Miller in 
Colorado Springs at a $98,000 loss. 
</P>
<P>
Also included is the $12,500 in salary that the USOC paid Harvey Schiller for 
the 19 days he served as executive director before he resigned in January, 
1988, and the $10,000 that it cost to move him from Birmingham, Ala., to 
Colorado Springs. The USOC did not pay for his move back to Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Schiller is returning to Colorado Springs as executive director on 
Jan. 1, the USOC not only will have to pay his salary next year but also that 
of his predecessor, Pittenger. Since replacing Schiller in 1988, Pittenger has 
received $150,000 a year. He will receive $200,000 next year before his 
contract expires in December. 
</P>
<P>
But at least Pittenger will be working for his salary. He will remain with the 
USOC as a senior consultant in charge of the U.S.-Soviet drug-testing 
agreement.

IT'S JUST ANOTHER EASY WIN; 
</P>
<P>
LAKERS: PAT RILEY KEEPS PLAYBOOK CLOSED AS TEAM CONCLUDES EXHIBITION SEASON 
UNDEFEATED BY BEATING CLEVELAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pat Riley's copy of the Laker playbook, usually dogeared by now, has hardly 
been opened throughout the exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
Not coincidentally, the new, fast-break-oriented Lakers have concluded their 
exhibition schedule undefeated for the first time in franchise history after 
beating the Cleveland Cavaliers, 135-115, Sunday night before 16,160 fans at 
the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Dominating all challengers, good or bad, the Lakers won eight consecutive 
exhibitions without even a close encounter. They outscored their opponents by 
an average of 115.8 to 97.1, by keeping the half-court offense uncomplicated 
and running as much as possible now that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar no longer is in 
the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes 10 days of practice, during which the Riley will try to resist the 
temptation to flip through the playbook and add a slew of new wrinkles to the 
offense heading into the Nov. 3 regular-season opener in Dallas. "We're trying 
to keep it very simple," Riley said. "It's been difficult for me not to go to 
the playbook. I'm trying to keep things open, look for that spontaneity in the 
fast break. Because now, if we start to grind it out, teams will start pounding 
us." 
</P>
<P>
No team was able to do that in the exhibition season, if any stock can be taken 
from practice games. The Lakers pounded the bad (Sacramento twice, New Jersey 
and Minnesota), the good (Phoenix, Seattle and the injury-depleted Cavaliers) 
and the so-so (Philadelphia). 
</P>
<P>
And they have done it by running a controlled fast break, untethered now that 
Abdul-Jabbar is not lodged in the middle. Expect the Lakers to become a little 
more patterned once the regular season starts, but not much. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to move and be more spontaneous, because we don't have that safety 
deposit box (Abdul-Jabbar) down low," said Mychal Thompson, Abdul-Jabbar's 
successor at center. "Besides, you don't harness the stallions we got on this 
team. You've got to let them roam free." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, however, are not exactly running wild. There is a pattern to their 
fast-break mentality, and they do run set plays. But they are pushing the ball 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that, as time goes on, we'll be adding more (plays)," James Worthy 
said. "I don't think the coaches want to let on what they've got planned. What 
we'll be doing this year are very basic, fundamental things, like just filling 
the lanes on the fast break and just one or two options in the offense." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, the Laker offense thrived both on the fast break and in half-court 
situations. Magic Johnson had 24 points and 17 assists. Byron Scott and Michael 
Cooper each had 17 points, and Thompson and Vlade Divac added 16 and 15, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Lakers were outrebounded, 45-38, they shot 60.2% from the floor 
and limited the Cavaliers to 43.3% shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Summing up the exhibition season, Riley said: "We've answered a few questions 
that I had going in. One is the center position. I think Mychal, Vlade and Mark 
(McNamara) give us a lot of depth. We knew what Mychal could do as a starter, 
but Vlade has shown that he is a productive, solid player. 
</P>
<P>
"I also saw Earvin play four positions and make us versatile. And I liked what 
I saw of Larry Drew (at backup point guard). We know what we have now, so we 
can go back to practice and just hone. I don't want to mess too much with what 
we've done. We'll just work on a few specialty situations." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he is a little concerned about the long break before the start of 
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we do need to practice," he said. "We'll have to wait until we get 
back to Camp Riley and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tops on Coach Pat Riley's wish-list going into the regular season is acquiring 
another backup center or a shooting guard, so the Lakers will be watching the 
waiver wire this week. But Riley said the club is pleased with rookie free 
agent forward Mel McCants and Mike Higgins as well as swingman Steve Bucknall. 
"We'll continue to evaluate our free-agent players and also see what's out 
there," Riley said. "But I would like to get another big power-forward type." . 
. . The seepage on the Forum court from the ice below made conditions so 
slippery during the Laker-Cavalier game that referees ordered rosin sprinkled 
on the floor . . .Ron Harper had 32 points and Mark Price 26 for the Cavaliers, 
who are playing without injured big men Brad Daugherty and Larry Nance. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the Golden State Warriors' 123-98 victory over Philadelphia 
76ers in Sunday's first game was Charles Barkley's acrobatic save of a loose 
ball. Barkley jumped on a baseline press table, scattering sportswriters, 
flipped the ball back onto the court, then landed feetfirst on a chair in the 
first row about 10 feet off the court. Barkley was not hurt; the chair was 
mangled. . . Lithuanian guard Sarunas Marciulionis led Golden State with 21 
points and Terry Teagle added 20 . . . Barkley and Mike Gminski had 17 points 
each for the 76ers, who are 1-4 in the exhibition season.

VIKINGS' DEFENSE HAS A MERRY TIME, 20-7

Mike Merriweather wanted to remind folks that the Minnesota Vikings rose to the 
top with tough defense long before Herschel Walker arrived on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
With Merriweather leading the National Football League's No. 1 defense, the 
Vikings overwhelmed the Detroit Lions, 20-7, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"The game plan here in Minnesota is blitzing and everybody had an opportunity 
today," Merriweather said. "Our defensive line is the best in the league and 
our secondary can run with anybody." 
</P>
<P>
The victory, Minnesota's second over Detroit in the last three games, gave the 
Vikings (5-2) a half-game lead in the NFC Central over the Chicago Bears, who 
play tonight at Cleveland. Detroit fell to 1-6. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings' defense had eight sacks for 42 yards in losses, intercepted two 
passes and recovered three fumbles. Merriweather had two sacks, one 
interception, caused two fumbles and recovered one of them. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions now have lost seven straight to the Vikings. In their game Oct. 1, 
Minnesota returned two interceptions for touchdowns in a 24-17 win at 
Minneapolis. The Vikings had eight sacks in that game and eight again last week 
against the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings, scoring on their first three possessions, built a 13-0 lead the 
Lions even crossed midfield. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Karlis kicked a pair of 40-yard field goals, then Chris Doleman recovered 
a fumble by Detroit's Barry Sanders at the Lions' 17-yard line, and six plays 
later Walker, following a block by right guard Todd Kalis, dove over from the 
one for his first Minnesota touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, in his second game with the Vikings, carried 20 times for 89 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions appeared headed for a score in the closing moments of the first half, 
but two mistakes by rookie Rodney Peete ended the drive. With first-and-goal at 
the Vikings' five, Peete scrambled to the three, then tried a pass and was 
penalized five yards. 
</P>
<P>
A pass interference call against Carl Lee gave the Lions a first-and-goal at 
the one, but Peete fumbled after a hit by Merriweather, who recovered with one 
second left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Peete, who completed four of six passes for 44 yards in the drive, finished 19 
of 36 for 240 yards. Tommy Kramer completed 15 of 20 for 143 yards for 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't play a good game," said Peete. "I had some guys open and didn't hit 
them. I threw interceptions on balls that should not have been thrown." 
</P>
<P>
On the Lions' first snap of the third quarter, Joey Browner reached over Robert 
Clark to intercept Peete's pass and returned it 27 yards to midfield. Five 
plays later, with Walker going left as a decoy, Alfred Anderson plowed four 
yards up the middle for a touchdown, putting Minnesota ahead 20-0. 
</P>
<P>
Peete scored the Lions' lone touchdown on a one-yard keeper with 5:07 left in 
the game, capping an 80-yard, seven-play drive that was aided by a 45-yard pass 
interference call against Lee.

The Washington Redskins survived a fourth-quarter passing show by Vinny 
Testaverde Sunday and escaped with a 32-28 victory over the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
Testaverde threw for 197 yards and three touchdowns in the final quarter, but 
couldn't overcome the Redskins' early lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins scored on all three of their third-quarter possessions to increase 
a 12-7 halftime lead to 29-7, then held on for another close win. Six of 
Washington's seven games have been decided by five points or less. 
</P>
<P>
The Buccaneers had managed just two first downs on their opening drive and two 
more in the last minute of the third period, and none in between. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Washington (4-3) established control with 17 points in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But a third-quarter wrist injury to the Darrell Green, the Redskins' best 
cornerback, opened the way for Tampa Bay's comeback. After Green went out, 
Testaverde started throwing. 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay (3-4) got two touchdowns within a 22-second span of the fourth 
quarter to cut the margin to 29-21 with 14:10 left. The Redskins pushed the 
lead to 32-21 when Chip Lohmilller kicked a 32-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Until they staged their fourth-quarter comeback, the Buccaneers had been 
limited to 110 yards through the first three quarters.

OILERS' DEFENSE SHINES, SHUTS OUT THE STEELERS

Warren Moon threw three touchdown passes in the first half, two to Alonzo 
Highsmith, and Houston's defense held Pittsburgh to 132 total yards in a 27-0 
victory Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Oilers' first shutout since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The win, coupled with Cincinnati's 23-12 loss to Indianapolis, gave Houston 
(4-3) a tie with the Bengals for the American Conference Central Division lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We played well and made turnovers happen," said rookie safety Bubba McDowell, 
who intercepted two passes. "Coach (Jerry) Glanville told me on Monday that I 
couldn't make any more rookie mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers' last shutout came on Dec. 20, 1980, when they beat Pittsburgh, 6-0. 
The Steelers (3-4) had won three of their last four. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Todd Blackledge, replacing injured Bubby Brister, led the Steelers 
to just 22 first-half yards, and Pittsburgh had only 42 at the start of the 
fourth quarter. Blackledge completed 11 of 27 passes for 105 yards and was 
Pittsburgh's leading rusher with 15 yards in three carries. 
</P>
<P>
"Our game plan wasn't exotic," Glanville said. "We wanted to keep getting after 
them. It was fun to watch it. Any time you get a shut out and you run the ball 
and throw it, you've got to be happy." 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh didn't cross midfield in the first half until the final seconds when 
Larry Griffin returned a short kickoff 21 yards to the Houston 49-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh reached Houston's five-yard line with 10:05 to play, but the defense 
held on downs as Blackledge's fourth-down pass sailed out of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers scored on four of their five first-half possessions and took a 24-0 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Moon's three first-half touchdown passes went to Highsmith for three and five 
yards and 51 yards to Curtis Duncan. Duncan's catch was the longest of his 
career and came after he got behind cornerback Rod Woodson. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Zendejas also kicked a 41-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
McDowell's 18-yard interception return in the second quarter set up the field 
goal. His other interception ended Pittsburgh's final possession. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Stone fumbled the ensuing kickoff, and Houston's Kenny Johnson recovered 
at the Steelers' 18, leading to a missed 31-yard field goal attempt by 
Zendejas. 
</P>
<P>
Houston running back Mike Rozier made his first start of the season after 
sitting out training camp and recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery. He 
gained 50 yards in 17 carries.

DICKERSON CAPS COLTS' COMEBACK, 23-12

<P>
Eric Dickerson rushed for a season-high 152 yards and completed a two-touchdown 
rally with a 21-yard run as the Indianapolis Colts defeated the Cincinnati 
Bengals, 23-12, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts, taking advantage of two Bengal turnovers, scored twice in a 
45-second span late in the game to wrap up the victory. 
</P>
<P>
First, Cincinnati's James Brooks lost the ball while spinning through the line 
and linebacker Duane Bickett recovered at the Cincinnati 16-yard line. Five 
plays later, quarterback Jack Trudeau lobbed a three-yard touchdown pass to an 
uncovered Albert Bentley for a 16-12 lead with 2:07 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
Then Keith Taylor intercepted a pass, his second of the game, to give the Colts 
possession again at the Bengals' 21. On the next play, Dickerson sprinted the 
21 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson hadn't reached 100 yards in his last four games, when he was slowed 
by a strained hamstring. The hamstring held up Sunday until the clinching 
touchdown run, when his burst sent an ache through the muscle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same hamstring," Dickerson said. "It didn't bother me until the last 
run. It feels just like a cramp. It happened on about the two-yard line." 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson's running was the key as the Colts (4-3) held onto the ball for most 
of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati's sputtering offense managed just four field goals by Jim Breech, 
and now has failed to score a touchdown in seven quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson carried 31 times in his 17th 100-yard game for the Colts -- 
surpassing Lydell Mitchell for the club record. He enjoyed running without pain 
in the hamstring, which had him considering an early retirement this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been hurt the last four weeks," Dickerson said. "When I'm hurt, the game 
of football is hard to sustain in practice during the week." 
</P>
<P>
But it was a pain for Cincinnati (4-3), which has lost two consecutive home 
games after winning 12 in a row at Riverfront Stadium the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals failed to get touchdowns from four deep drives, having to settle 
for the field goals. 
</P>
<P>
"If you give them chances, give them life, they're going to beat you," said 
Boomer Esiason, who was sacked five times for 46 yards in losses. "If you talk 
to any one of the 45 guys that played, they'll say, 'Yeah, I made mistakes out 
there.' Some were not as glaring as others." 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals put themselves in position to lose with their goal-line failures. 
The Colts also clamped down in the second half, holding Cincinnati to 70 total 
yards.

CASPER SHOOTS 68 TO WIN BY 3

<TEXT>
<P>
Billy Casper, who began the day in a four-way tie for the lead, shot a 
four-under-par 68 Sunday to win the $400,000 Transamerica Senior Championship 
by three strokes over Al Geiberger at Napa, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Casper, who was tied with Geiberger, Dave Hill and Charles Coody after three 
rounds, had four birdies in his bogey-free round that gave him a 54-hole total 
of 207, nine under par for three rounds on the 6,632-yard Silverado Country 
Club course. 
</P>
<P>
Casper earned $60,000 with the victory after he bogeyed only three holes in 
three rounds and three-putted just once. 
</P>
<P>
Geiberger's final-round left him in second at 210. He won $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
Coody, with a final-round 72, and Larry Ziegler (70) tied for third four 
strokes back, while Bob Charles (72) was fifth at 212. Hill was never in 
contention, finishing with a 74 to wind up sixth at 213. 
</P>
<P>
"I had my chances, I just didn't do anything," Geiberger said. "So, Billy said, 
'I'm going to do it,' and bam, bam, bam." 
</P>
<P>
Geiberger quickly took a two-stroke lead in the final round with birdies on the 
first two holes. Casper caught him with birdies on the third and sixth holes. 
Geiberger then lost a stroke with a bogey on the seventh hole, a par three. 
</P>
<P>
Casper, whose previous best finish this year was a tie for second, moved out to 
a three-stroke lead with birdies on 14 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes that's the most dangerous way to start out," said Geiberger, who 
made birdie putts of 10 and 15 feet on the first two holes, then struggled. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I was trying so hard to make the putts to get out of that logjam," 
Geiberger said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the old Billy coming through here today," Geiberger said. "But when I 
look back on this tournament I'll probably, in the back of my mind, feel like I 
should've won."

MOTOR RACING: BRABHAM, THE SECOND-PLACE FINISHER, CLINCHES SERIES CHAMPIONSHIP 
WHEN ROBINSON DROPS OUT.

<P>
What was billed as a two-hour race turned into a little more than one hour 
Sunday as the pace car for the Camel Grand Prix of Southern California led for 
longer than the Jaguars, Nissans, Porsches, Toyotas and Spices that were 
advertised as the main show Sunday at the Del Monte Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
But even 66 minutes was a couple too many for Geoff Brabham and his 
turbocharged Nissan prototype ZXT as Jan Lammers of the Netherlands slipped his 
Jaguar XJR-10 past Brabham two laps from the finish to win the $180,000 
combined purse in the year's richest sports car race. 
</P>
<P>
Brabham, who finished second in the season-ending race for International Motor 
Sports Assn. cars, won his second straight series championship and its $150,000 
bonus when his Nissan teammate, Chip Robinson, dropped out with a broken axle 
and finished 17th in the 22-car field. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson started the day four points ahead of Brabham. 
</P>
<P>
Brabham led from the 38th lap -- about 45 minutes into the race -- until 
Lammers feinted a pass going into the first turn after a restart and found 
daylight when Brabham got in a little deep and couldn't turn his car. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected him to attack there because he had tried it on the previous restart 
and I managed to hold him," Brabham said. "It takes my car a long time to warm 
up in a situation like that. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, when I saw Chip (Robinson) sitting on the side of the road and knew 
the championship was mine, all the air went out of my balloon. And I knew Jan 
hadn't won a race and I knew he would be going for the $180,000 jackpot." 
</P>
<P>
Brabham apparently forgotten that Lammers was a co-driver when Price Cobb 
finished first at Portland last July. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who needed only to finish ahead of Brabham to win his second 
championship (he won in 1987 in a Porsche), got off to a poor start when he hit 
a pylon and it stuck in his front nose for half a lap. He was running seventh 
when he pitted early, but was never a factor after returning. 
</P>
<P>
On the 59th lap of the 85-lap race, the red, white and blue Nissan stopped with 
a broken axle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that has never happened with this car before," Robinson said. 
"I have no complaints. We've had a terrific year and I couldn't be happier for 
Geoff (Brabham). This track was very rough and we gave it everything we had." 
</P>
<P>
Lammers, a jockey-sized driver who won the 24 Hours of LeMans in 1988, also 
shared the winning ride here last year with Martin Brundle of England. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Earl, driving a Chevrolet-powered Spice, finished third after almost 
passing Brabham on the final lap. Also on the lead lap were Willy T. Ribbs, in 
Dan Gurney's Toyota Eagle, and Jochen Mass, in a four-year-old Havoline Porsche 
962 that is probably headed for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Mass echoed the feelings of most of the 36,500 spectators when he fumed that 
"They could have removed those cars a lot quicker. It seemed like the whole 
race was run under yellow." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Rappauf, IMSA president, said the cause for all the inaction was an 
experiment that didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an experiment to do the Camel Lights drivers a favor and create a 
better atmosphere for their race, but the end result speaks for itself," 
Rappauf said. "The process was too slow, and I know the fans aren't here to 
watch a parade. It was the first time in 20 years I heard boos like that during 
a race, and I didn't enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
This was the second time the process was used and it wasn't any better at 
Watkins Glen. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt we needed to try it on a tight course like Del Mar," Rappauf said. "It 
slowed things down too much on a big course like Watkins Glen, but we felt it 
might work here. But we know now we'll never do it again." 
</P>
<P>
The first caution came when Frank Jelinski crashed his Joest Porsche 962. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just going too fast," the West German driver said. "I hit the left wall, 
then the right wall and went bing, bing, bing just like a ball." 
</P>
<P>
That caution period lasted 23 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Schubot of West Palm Beach, Fla., won the Camel Lights race and finished 
ninth overall in the race within a race. It was Schubot's eighth win in his 
Buick Spice, which made him a runaway series winner. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Ludemann drove two laps in Schubot's car during the race to get credit 
for her fourth victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
A Lights car is a non-turbocharged version of the prototypes with a three-liter 
engine capacity or less. 
</P>
<P>
Ribbs was pleased with the fourth place finish of the Toyota Eagle. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that we finished, and that we beat one of the Nissans and 
one of the Jags. That is the best finish we have ever had, but it's not going 
be that way next year. We don't plan on starting from this point, we plan of 
getting to the next level and coming out smoking."

ONE KILLED, ANOTHER IS INJURED DURING OFFSHORE POWER BOAT RACE

One man died and another was injured Sunday when their boat turned over and 
sank during competition in the Trump Castle World Offshore Power Championships 
near Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Brown, 37, of Rocky River, Ohio, who was driving the Team Skater power 
boat, was killed and the boat's throttleman, James Dyke, was slightly injured 
in the accident. The two were competing in the championship race for boats in 
the Union Internationale Motonautique Class II, said Pam Sinderbrand, a 
spokeswoman for Trump Castle. 
</P>
<P>
Sinderbrand said Dyke, of Bay Village, Ohio, was in stable condition at an 
Atlantic City hospital, which officials declined to identify. An age for Dyke 
was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-foot racing boat was headed southwest about 2 1/2 miles from the 
starting line when its bow launched into the air, hooked the water and rolled, 
landing upright, according to a statement released by the American Power Boat 
Assn., the sport's national governing body. The association said Brown died 
instantly from head and neck injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Sinderbrand said Team Skater had been racing for about 28 minutes at about 
73.57 m.p.h. She said the boat was traveling faster than the average speed of 
the winning boat.

THIS U.S. TEAM IS DEPLETED, NOT DEFEATED; 
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL: AFTER LOSING ITS STARTERS FROM THE SEOUL GAMES, THE AMERICAN 
NATIONAL TEAM APPEARS TO HAVE A BUMPY ROAD AHEAD. STILL, ITS YOUNG PLAYERS 
REMAIN OPTIMISTIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Fortune played only a small role when the U.S. volleyball team won its 
second consecutive gold medal at Seoul last year. 
</P>
<P>
But since then, Fortune has assumed a new role on a team in transition. Seven 
of the United States' 12 Olympic members left after Seoul, and two more say 
they will leave in November. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, U.S. Coach Bill Neville said he will rely on Fortune, a middle 
blocker, and outside hitters Troy Tanner and Jon Root to guide the program 
through the next three years, which might be rough after the team's enormous 
success. All three were substitutes in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys like Fortune have to grow up quickly," Neville said. "There's no time for 
that adolescent stage for them to develop. They have to go out and do it right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
That may be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
The team's biggest void came last July, when outside hitter Karch Kiraly and 
middle blocker Steve Timmons, who led the United States to two gold medals, 
joined the pro beach circuit. They are regarded as two of the world's best 
players. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, their departure left the team with only two returning starters 
from 1988 -- setter Jeff Stork and outside hitter Bob Ctvrtlik. 
</P>
<P>
But Stork and Ctvrtlik plan to leave after the World Cup in November to play 
professionally in Italy. Two other starters, Craig Buck and Doug Partie, joined 
the Italian leagues after the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The three returning players, along with a patchwork lineup of promising 
collegians who are inexperienced at the international level, are trying to 
maintain the United States' No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm upset with a lot of those guys who have left," said Fortune, 23. "They're 
still young enough to play. They've left the program in a difficult situation. 
We're a few years behind and we need to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a learning experience with the younger guys." He said they looked to 
Stork and Ctvrtlik "to smooth things over." 
</P>
<P>
Stork, formerly a standout at Pepperdine, said winning the gold medal in Seoul 
satisfied his amateur goals, and he is ready to move on. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say I made a terrible decision leaving the team," Stork said. "I've 
been with the team for five years and I've helped the younger players as much 
as I can. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to explore new avenues. It's the culmination of my (amateur) career 
and it's time to have fun now. It's also a chance to make a little money." 
</P>
<P>
Stork will earn $500,000 for playing the next two years in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Volleyball Assn. can't offer the players the money to stay around," 
Stork said. "(It) pays for living expenses, but it's not enough. There are a 
few guys on the team who are making $100 a month. There are some who don't even 
own a car." 
</P>
<P>
Neville said he doesn't blame Stork and Ctvrtlik for going to Italy. He 
compared the U.S. team's situation to that of the Clippers, who recently lost 
Danny Ferry to the Italian basketball league. 
</P>
<P>
"What it all comes down to is that the Italians can ante up and pay for the 
players," Neville said. "The Italians have deep pockets -- ones that reach all 
the way to their toes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tempting offer for young players -- a six-figure salary to play seven 
months and work out two or three times a week. Then they can come back and play 
on the beach tour and make more money." 
</P>
<P>
With the loss of nine players from the 1988 team, Neville has searched 
California universities for talent. He said the U.S. team's future rests on the 
newcomers such as Bryan Ivie of USC, Chris Braun of Stanford and Mark Arnold of 
Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
"Losing Bob and Jeff has had a big effect on the team," Neville said. "I would 
be a liar if I said it didn't. It's something I try not to think about. 
</P>
<P>
"But the younger guys know their day in the sun is coming. It's just coming a 
little sooner than expected." 
</P>
<P>
Fortune said the U.S. team is undergoing a transition similar to the one when 
Kiraly and Timmons joined the team eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The United States was weak in international volleyball when Kiraly and Timmons 
arrived in 1981. The Americans weren't much better in 1982, when they finished 
13th at the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
Success did not come until after the world championships, when the U.S. team 
restructured its program and brought in a new coach. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the team was preparing for Seoul, it was a well-tuned machine. 
</P>
<P>
"All (former coach Marv Dunphy) had to do was roll the ball out there and let 
us go at it," Fortune said. "That was what practices were like then. Now the 
coaches spend a lot more time teaching. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize we're going to have to play a lot harder. We can't walk over teams 
since Karch and Steve left." 
</P>
<P>
The team's first major test will be at the World Cup. The United States won the 
last one in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're the favorites," Stork said. "The Cubans and the Soviets 
look good. We might be in the top four." 
</P>
<P>
As a warmup to the World Cup, the Americans are playing the Japanese national 
team in an eight-city exhibition tour in the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is 5-2 without Kiraly and Timmons. Before the tour against 
Japan, the U.S. team split two games against the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Neville used the tour to give the younger players experience. Stork sat out the 
three games in Japan so setter Javier Gaspar could play. 
</P>
<P>
With new players, Neville juggles the lineup to find the best combinations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to discipline myself as the coach sometimes," he said. "When we get 
into the fray, my instinct is to go with the best six players. But my 
assistants keep reminding me that I have to get the younger guys some playing 
time. I've had to do a lot of experimenting." 
</P>
<P>
Fortune, who played at Stanford and Laguna Beach High School, said playing with 
the young team is challenging. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to prove ourselves," he said. "Everyone is saying we can't do it 
without Karch and Steve. Hey, they were great and I looked up to them when they 
were on the team, but now I realize they're gone and we have to go on without 
them."

MCMAHON LEAVES CHARGERS EMPTY, GIANTS WONDERING

Jim McMahon yanked off his helmet, glanced at the scoreboard -- New York Giants 
20, Chargers 13 -- and decided that he had had enough. He could not bear the 
thought of watching any longer. 
</P>
<P>
Even though there still was one more play to be run by the Giants, McMahon 
picked up his gear and was off for the Charger locker room, leaving his 
teammates the task of playing out the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon, the Charger quarterback, was the first to enter the locker room. The 
first to shower. The first to dress. And the first to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to get the hell out of here right now," McMahon said to 
approaching reporters. 
</P>
<P>
He then looked toward teammate Billy Joe Tolliver, and said, "Well, Red, 
another bleeping loss." 
</P>
<P>
McMahon put on his sunglasses and was gone. 
</P>
<P>
Losing three straight games-with three straight dismal offensive efforts, while 
blowing three straight chances for victory in the closing minutes-has a way of 
silencing a guy. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly when the only touchdown scored by your team all day was on a 
81-yard fumble return by safety Vencie Glenn. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon completed 12 of 27 passes for just 133 yards, and if that was not 
painful enough, his third-quarter interception to Adrian White set up a Giant 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, if I hadn't played against him (McMahon) before," Giant linebacker 
Lawrence Taylor said, "I wouldn't have believed it was even the same guy. Part 
of him is gone. There's something missing. He's a different type of Jim McMahon 
now. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems he was more worried about me than getting the ball to his wide 
receivers." 
</P>
<P>
Said defensive end Leonard Marshall: "McMahon just didn't want to get hit 
today. He was rushing the whole time just to get rid of the ball." 
</P>
<P>
The shots fired by the Giants afterwards certainly were more painful than the 
ones they delivered, considering that McMahon was sacked just once, none by 
Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Coach Dan Henning, making sure that the Giants didn't take advantage of 
his decimated offensive line, kept seven players on the line of scrimmage the 
entire game. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that takes away some people that have the capabilities of making a big 
play," Henning said, "but if you can't keep their people out of your backfield, 
you won't have a chance to make a big play." 
</P>
<P>
Countered Taylor: "It seemed as if they were actually playing defense while 
their offense was in there. They had a lot of real quick throws; three steps 
back and throw it. God only knows where it's going. I just don't think you can 
win like that." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor didn't offer any suggestions, but unless the NFL offers them their 
version of federal aid by altering their remaining schedule, the next six weeks 
could be just as ugly.. 
</P>
<P>
Take a look, if you dare. The next time the Chargers (2-5) play a team with a 
worst record than their own is Dec. 3, when the New York Jets come to town. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really getting sick of all this," cornerback Sam Seale said. "I'm tired of 
hearing how the Chargers fought hard and had a chance to win a game. The bottom 
line is we lost, and people don't give a damn how we lost." 
</P>
<P>
As defensive end Burt Grossman said, "No one is going to ask you if you hung in 
there with everybody, and no one is going to ask you that you just lost each 
game by four or eight points. They're going to ask about your win-loss record, 
and right now, it hurts to say that we're 2-5." 
</P>
<P>
Just like last week and the week before that, the Charger defense again 
provided the offense with a chance to win the game in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
And just like last week and the week before, the offense failed miserably. The 
Chargers' offense: 
</P>
<P>
* gained, with the exception of three drives that resulted in field goal 
attempts, only 42 yards. 
</P>
<P>
* failed to get a first down in the fourth quarter and had only three in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
* was on the field for only two minutes, eight seconds during the fourth 
quarter, producing a negative-four yards. 
</P>
<P>
* had only eight plays that gained 10 or more yards. 
</P>
<P>
It was a week ago, in their 17-16 defeat to Seattle, remember, that the Charger 
defense forced a fumble on the Seahawk 18-yard line with 4:06 left, only to 
stand on the sidelines and watch the offense promptly march backward before 
having a 51-yard field goal blocked. 
</P>
<P>
Well, learning by this time that handing the ball to their offense is like 
asking the Army to fend for themselves with squirt guns, the Charger defense 
decided to take it upon themselves to score. With the Giants just trying to run 
out the clock, linebacker Billy Ray Bates walloped Maurice Carthon as he came 
through the line, sending the football squirting out of his hands. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn picked up the ball, ran through a couple of bodies and left Phil Simms 
chasing him futilely 81 yards down the left side for the longest fumble return 
in Charger history. 
</P>
<P>
The touchdown cut the Giants' lead to 20-13 with 2:27 left, and all of a 
sudden, Giant Coach Bill Parcells didn't look so good. 
</P>
<P>
Once the Chargers kicked off into the end zone for a touchback, all the Giants 
needed was one first down to ensure victory. They never got it. The Giants 
gained only six yards on three plays and had to punt. 
</P>
<P>
The Charger offense came onto the field with the ball at their 40, with 1:46 
and one timeout. 
</P>
<P>
Well, three incompletions and a sack later, the Charger defense was back on the 
field with the ball at their own 25. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the Giants took no chances. Simms simply knelt down twice, leaving 
the Chargers muttering to themselves once again. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't pin this loss solely on the offense," Smith said. "You can't say 
it's solely their failure. You can't say we're losing all these games because 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
"We did give up 20 points, remember?" 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers and the Indianapolis Colts are the only teams in the NFL that have 
allowed 20 or fewer points in each of their past five games. 
</P>
<P>
But as the Chargers are finding out, it doesn't really seem to matter.

Sitting down? Take a deep breath. Swallow your coffee. This is what San Diego 
State Coach Al Luginbill was pleased with Sunday: his defense. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, SDSU has lit up the scoreboard for 35 points, then allowed 40. 
Against Pacific Saturday, the Aztecs (3-3-1) scored 35 and allowed . . . 7. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been getting better defensively, but we've had nothing to show for it," 
Luginbill said. "Last week (a 30-26 victory over Cal State Long Beach) we gave 
up 26 points, but it was our best defensive effort." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs nearly had their first shutout since Oct. 6, 1984 -- a span of 61 
games -- but lost it when wide receiver Bryan Baldwin ran 26 yards on a reverse 
with 1:45 left. What was most frustrating was that the Aztecs had stopped the 
drive at the Pacific 38, but were called for having too many men on the field 
when the Tigers punted. Pacific was awarded a first down, and the Tigers moved 
down the field and scored. 
</P>
<P>
The consolation, though, was that Pacific gained only 312 yards -- the lowest 
by an Aztec opponent this year. And Luginbill appreciated Pacific Coach Walt 
Harris referring to SDSU as "physical." 
</P>
<P>
"He probably gave us the biggest compliment we've gotten all year," Luginbill 
said. "He felt this was a physical football team. That's what we've been 
working on all year." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill was particularly happy with the Aztec linebackers, especially Tracey 
Mao. 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting to get some play from our linebackers and that's encouraging 
for us," Luginbill said. "To be a good football team week in and week out, our 
linebackers have to make good plays. 
</P>
<P>
"Tracey Mao played by far his best game. If he can play like that, he's going 
to be a good player for us." 
</P>
<P>
The SDSU offense again played a spotty first half. The Aztecs led, 7-0, at 
halftime. But despite another occurrence of what has been Luginbill's biggest 
frustration this season, he said he kept his cool at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about how we were stopping ourselves again, but I told the defense 
that we had enough points to win the football game," Luginbill said. 
</P>
<P>
Starting Monday, the players SDSU has redshirted this year will practice as a 
group, separate from the rest of the team but with the entire coaching staff, 
once a week. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have individual coaching for that group and bring them along to the 
point where we can give them a little advantage going into spring ball," 
Luginbill said. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs, it would seem, have business to attend to Saturday when they play 
at the University of Texas-El Paso. It was at UTEP a year ago that former coach 
Denny Stolz worked his final game after being fired, and the Miners 
administered a 58-7 whipping to the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this football team has a burr in its saddle regarding UTEP," Luginbill 
said. "I sense that some of the taunts and things that went on in the game a 
year ago, this team has held under its hat for awhile." 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
The injury report: Senior defensive end Todd Coomes suffered a dislocated left 
kneecap and will miss this week's game. Junior wide receiver Dennis Arey, who 
missed the Pacific game with a hamstring pull, should play this week, as should 
senior wide receiver Monty Gilbreath (groin) and junior linebacker Sai Niu 
(bruised shin and ankle). Gilbreath and Niu were both injured during Saturday's 
game. Gilbreath returned to the game after his injury; Niu did not. . . . The 
victory margin against Pacific was SDSU's largest since the Aztecs defeated 
Hawaii, 35-5, in the second-to-last game of 1986. . . . Aztec Coach Al 
Luginbill said the kickoff coverage team was better this week. Pacific's Tom 
Zenner was averaging 26.9 yards a return, but the Aztecs held him to 73 yards 
in four returns -- an average of 18.3.

BUSTED AXLE DOESN'T BREAK THE SPIRIT OF SECOND-PLACE ROBINSON; 
</P>
<P>
DEL MAR: FINISHING BEHIND TEAMMATE GEOFF BRABHAM FOR THE SEASON DRIVING 
CHAMPIONSHIP DOESN'T TAKE LUSTER OF ROBINSON'S BEST YEAR.

<P>
Driving championship or not, Chip Robinson was not about to let an ironic twist 
of fate ruin an otherwise outstanding year. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson went the entire International Motor Sports Assn. season without a 
serious engine mishap on his Nissan GTP-ZXT. He finished in the top 10 in all 
14 starts. 
</P>
<P>
But when Robinson needed his car most -- on the last day of the IMSA season 
with the Camel GTP driving title on the line -- it shafted him, literally. 
</P>
<P>
With Sunday's two-hour race on the 1.62-mile Del Mar course more than 
two-thirds over and Robinson in seventh place, a part of his car's axle, called 
the halfshaft, broke. 
</P>
<P>
"This track is really rough and we took some real punishment," Robinson said. 
"I guess the axle just couldn't take all the bumps." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, on lap 13, Robinson, who began the race in sixth position, was forced 
to change all four tires. 
</P>
<P>
"The right-front tire went down after some rough turns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Holding on to his four-point lead over Nissan teammate Geoff Brabham would have 
been a difficult task. Brabham was five spots ahead of him, but Robinson's car 
troubles ended the suspense. 
</P>
<P>
Still, seven wins in 15 starts and a second place in the drivers' standings -- 
worth $75,000 -- isn't bad for a guy who entered the year with only four career 
wins. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a great year," Robinson said. "I have no complaints. I really don't 
have any bad feelings about it. We did the best we could. 
</P>
<P>
"When you work with a team that has been as reliable as this team has been all 
year, how could you complain," said Robinson, 35, who began his racing career 
at 17 as an IMSA mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
Brabham finished the year with 230 points for his second consecutive GTP 
championship, which was worth $150,000. Robinson, who did not score any points 
Sunday, had 219. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said there is even some irony in finishing second to his Nissan 
teammate. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd kind of gotten the lead because of Geoff's misfortune earlier," said 
Robinson, referring to engine problems that forced Brabham out of two earlier 
races. 
</P>
<P>
Brabham, who finished second in the Grand Prix to Jan Lammers, said Robinson's 
retirement definitely changed his perspective on winning the race. 
</P>
<P>
"When Chip went out, I knew all I had to do was finish," Brabham said. "I kind 
of lost my aggressiveness, though it still would have been nice to win 
$80,000." 
</P>
<P>
Which is what Lammers bagged for winning his second consecutive Del Mar Grand 
Prix. 
</P>
<P>
Pole sitter Wayne Taylor's day was fairly similar to Robinson's, except Taylor 
did not have a $75,000 check to show for his efforts. Just the $3,000 he 
collected for gaining the pole and $2,500 for the race. 
</P>
<P>
After 30 minutes of racing, Taylor dropped into second place, 5.7 seconds 
behind Spice Engineering teammate Bob Earl. Soon after, Taylor began 
experiencing gear box problems. 
</P>
<P>
Three minutes later, Taylor was forced to hand over the driving 
responsibilities to his teammate, Scott Atchison, when his arm cramped. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would go away, but my arm kept cramping," Taylor said."I didn't 
want to risk crashing the car so I got out." 
</P>
<P>
Some 40 minutes later, Atchison dropped out because of valve problems on the 
Pontiac Spice SE89.

Regulator Says Lincoln Laundered Funds: Lincoln Savings and Loan allegedly 
laundered illegal political contributions through its president and other 
employees, a state regulator said. Ray Fidel, former president and chief 
executive of Lincoln, received an inflated salary so that he could contribute 
money in his name and reimburse employees who were ordered to contribute, said 
William Crawford, director of the California Department of Savings and Loan. 
Crawford's comments were reported by the Daily News. According to Crawford, 
"The policy was to inflate salaries. He'd get a phone call and someone would 
say: 'You write a check.' " Crawford said the calls came from subordinates of 
Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of American Continental Corp., the Phoenix, 
Ariz.-based parent of Lincoln. American Continental filed for protection under 
Chapter 11 law on April 13. One day later, Lincoln was taken over by federal 
regulators.

Nippon Life Insurance, Japan's largest life insurer, said Friday that it had 
agreed to buy an 80% stake in the Paine Webber Building, a midtown Manhattan 
landmark, for $550 million. 
</P>
<P>
Equitable Life Assurance Society will hold the other 20% and continue to manage 
the 38-story building on the Avenue of the Americas, a Nippon Life spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nippon has invested in five other U.S. buildings in cooperation with Equitable. 
It owns 20 buildings overseas, of which 18 are in the United States and one 
each in Canada and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very nervous about investing in real estate in the U.S. Therefore our 
investments are mainly based on tie-ups or cooperation with real estate 
developers and life insurance companies there," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Nippon Life, which has assets of more than $156 billion (22 trillion yen), 
hopes the building will provide long-term stable returns, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Purchases of American buildings by Japanese life insurers have drawn criticism 
in the United States because the buildings have tended to be well-known and 
some Americans have objected to seeing them in foreign hands. 
</P>
<P>
Big Japanese life insurance companies began to invest in U.S. real estate in 
1981 and own nearly 50 buildings there. Nearly 90% of overseas real estate held 
by Japan's 25 life insurers is in the United States, industry sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our real estate investment in the U.S. will peak soon. To diversify risks, we 
must shift our funds to other countries," said the manager of the international 
investment department of one Japanese life insurance company.

Quake Doesn't Shake Muni Bonds: California's municipal bond market, the 
nation's largest, felt barely a ripple from the Bay Area earthquake, though 
some of the roads, bridges and buildings financed by the bonds sustained 
damage. Prices of the bonds were virtually unaffected by the quake. Mutual fund 
operators said they received few panicky calls from investors in 
California-based municipal bond funds, and almost none of the investors pulled 
out.

UNOCAL'S GEOTHERMAL PROJECTS ARE GAINING STEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unocal Corp. has given a new meaning to the term steaming jungle. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the rain forests of the Philippines, the company has tapped into a source 
of energy more primordial than oil or natural gas: the heat of the earth's 
crust itself, manifested in super-hot water and billowing steam. 
</P>
<P>
The resource, dubbed geothermal energy, can be drilled, extracted and piped to 
generators to produce electricity. On the Philippines' main island, Luzon, 
Unocal's geothermal division supplies steam to produce 660 megawatts of power, 
enough to fill 25% of the island's electrical needs, said division President 
Stephen C. Lipman. 
</P>
<P>
The decade-old project is Unocal's largest foreign geothermal operation, but is 
only part of the company's Pacific Basin operations. In that sense, Unocal -- 
which calls itself the world's largest producer of geothermal energy -- seems 
to be pacing the industry. 
</P>
<P>
As domestic geothermal markets dry up, the Pacific Basin is emerging as one of 
the best new markets for California geothermal companies, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel (the potential overseas) is very strong because of the diversity of 
experience many companies have here," said Claudia Barker, assistant director 
of the California Energy Commission. "There's just not that range . . . in any 
other state." 
</P>
<P>
Geothermal energy occurs in the form of heat captured by fluids trapped in rock 
formations beneath the earth. 
</P>
<P>
Companies such as Unocal explore such geothermal fields, drill wells and 
produce either superheated water or steam. The company can sell the steam to 
utilities to produce electricity in generating plants. Or the company can build 
its own generating plant and sell the resulting electricity directly to the 
utility. 
</P>
<P>
The heat comes from molten rock, or magma, that has worked its way close to the 
earth's surface. That happens in areas with faults, earthquakes or volcanic 
activity -- such as the Pacific Basin, which also carries the nickname the Ring 
of Fire. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to favorable geology, the Pacific Basin includes many developing 
nations eager for a relatively cheap, home-grown source of electrical power and 
a way to reduce their balance-of-trade deficits. All of which makes the region 
favorable for geothermal. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 countries with the most geothermal development include six Pacific Basin 
countries, according to the Geothermal Resources Council, an industry 
information group in Davis, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Even Indonesia, with its membership in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries and its oil reserves, wants to develop steam-powered electrical 
plants -- and save the oil and gas for export, Lipman said. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal is already active in the area. By 1992, Unocal plans to begin geothermal 
production for a 110-megawatt power plant in the Salak area of Indonesia, about 
40 miles south of Jakarta on the island of Java. 
</P>
<P>
The company is talking about geothermal projects with officials in Guatemala 
and even the Soviet Union, which has geothermal fields on the Kamchatka 
Peninsula, Lipman said. Unocal is also talking with officials in Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
Other geothermal companies in the Pacific Rim include Chevron Corp. and Texaco. 
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, geothermal development is growing at an annual rate of 15% to 17%, 
said David N. Anderson, executive director of the Geothermal Resources Council 
and the National Geothermal Assn., a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
In the race for a piece of that business, U.S. companies may have an edge in 
technology, Lipman said. Unocal has perfected equipment that can withstand the 
high temperatures, hard rock and corrosive salinity of geothermal drilling, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But American firms find themselves at a disadvantage when competing against 
government-subsidized foreign firms that can offer cut-rate financing to 
cash-strapped Third World utilities. 
</P>
<P>
The main competitors are Japanese and Italian companies, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
The state energy commission has taken on the role of broker to help state-based 
geothermal companies get together with foreign governments. Among other things, 
the state has sponsored "reverse trade missions" in which foreign utility 
officials fly to California, where state geothermal companies trot out their 
stuff. The missions have resulted in at least three agreements for further 
development, Barker said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is that these companies are struggling . . . and were having a 
hard time breaking in," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's group, the National Geothermal Assn., was formed in 1987 to 
coordinate efforts of geothermal vendors. The association is also seeking 
federal permission for its members to form coalitions to bid on foreign 
projects, which would enable them to compete better with foreign companies. 
</P>
<P>
The need to look overseas is spurred by a domestic market that is going up in 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
California easily overshadows other areas in the world in geothermal activity, 
with 2,609 megawatts of power generated at the end of last year, according to 
the Geothermal Resources Council. That is projected to grow to 2,889 megawatts 
for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Total worldwide production was 5,004 megawatts at the end of 1987, the latest 
year for which statistics were available, the council reported. By now, another 
600 megawatts may have come on line, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
But future domestic geothermal development isn't attractive, in part because of 
the economics. Up to this point, steam prices have not remained strong enough 
to support further exploration, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the state Public Utilities Commission is reviewing the standard 
contract between utilities and geothermal producers and could require 
geothermal to be competitive with other fuels, Barker said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably going to be a little difficult to compete with oil- or 
natural-gas-based technologies," given relatively low fossil fuel prices, 
Barker said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, California probably won't need more electric generation capacity until 
the mid-1990s, Barker said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the world's biggest geothermal field, the Geysers in Northern 
California, may be overloaded with 26 plants now tapping steam and two more 
under construction. Production of steam has peaked and is in decline. 
</P>
<P>
The drop in steam pressure has caught the attention of the Energy Commission, 
which is now studying the phenomenon to help manage the field better. 
</P>
<P>
It's a question of "how many straws should be stuck into the ground up there 
and how they should be sipping," Barker said. 
</P>
<P>
At Unocal, slipping domestic steam prices are partly to blame for sliding 
geothermal revenue and earnings. At the end of 1988, the geothermal division of 
Unocal reported net earnings of $25 million, down from $33 million in 1987. 
Revenue was $155 million, down from $165 million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the company lowered its estimated reserves at both the Geysers field 
in California and the Tiwi field in the Philippines, which could affect revenue 
from both fields in the future. 
</P>
<P>
But Lipman says earnings have turned the corner this year, partly because of 
higher overall production from the Philippines and revenue from a new 
47.5-megawatt geothermal plant in the Imperial Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings should improve even more once the Indonesian field begins production 
and sales to the national utility, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Improved financial performance would underline the company's need for Pacific 
Rim development. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, we've tended to rely on our operations at the Geysers in Northern 
California . . . to provide the cash flow for the rest of our operations," he 
said. "Now we're at the point where we've got three significant profit centers 
in our operation (the Geysers, Imperial Valley and the Philippines), and when 
Indonesia comes on, the fourth one will be there. 
</P>
<P>
"So we've got the stability and are able to take the ups and downs of any one 
area, and still maintain a very good level of earnings and cash flow."

CABBIES TAKING ON NEW CARGO; 
</P>
<P>
THEY'RE NOT ABOUT TO DO IN TRADITIONAL MESSENGER SERVICES, BUT MORE TAXI 
COMPANIES ARE TOUTING THEMSELVES AS SPEEDY AND LOW-COST DELIVERY AGENTS. 
</P>

<P>
Earlier this year, the state Department of Conservation found itself in hot 
water for running up a $13,988 tab on cab fare for the delivery of documents 
around Sacramento. Controller Gray Davis initially balked at paying the bill, 
although eventually the cab company collected its due. 
</P>
<P>
Package deliveries are a small, but potentially lucrative market for cab 
companies if they can persuade the American public that their drivers -- 
typically independent contractors who lease the cabs -- can reliably perform 
these non-traditional services. 
</P>
<P>
At least half a dozen cab companies in the Los Angeles area advertise their 
willingness to deliver packages, but so far, the service probably accounts for 
less than 5% of the area's biggest fleet operator, Taxi Systems Inc., which 
runs six fleets from Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
The cabs -- which run their meters as though the packages were human passengers 
-- offer a service that is admittedly more costly than a scheduled messenger 
service. But in a pinch, Taxi Systems Vice President of Marketing Gene Hauck 
contends, cabs are cheaper and faster than calling for a messenger's rush 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Such a "valet" service, as Hauck calls it, must be built on public trust, 
because drivers aren't insured to handle valuables. Hauck admits that such 
trust may be hard to establish in the United States where cabbies are often 
stereotyped as the shifty, abrasive dispatcher ("Louie") played by Danny De 
Vito on "Taxi," the long-running TV series. 
</P>
<P>
In Canada, cabs are frequently used to deliver documents in the bustling city 
of Toronto, "although I think right now they are facing stiff competition from 
fax machines," says Roy Van Veen, director of administration for the 
Metropolitan Licensing Commission. Van Veen says he can't recall a single 
complaint "of something not being delivered," even though drivers -- just as in 
the United States -- are not bonded. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Winch, president of Grange Avenue Research Corp. in Toronto, said he 
routinely relies on taxis to deliver his own research reports to clients or 
"pick up annual reports or quarterly reports of companies." He has the option 
of opening an account with a cab company, or simply accepting the cab driver's 
estimate of the cost of the metered drive and paying the driver in advance. 
</P>
<P>
In large metropolitan centers in the United States, however, cab company 
executives admit that some of their drivers have difficulty following complex 
instructions because English is their second language and the dispatcher cannot 
afford to spend too much time repeating instructions over the radio. 
</P>
<P>
Although no data is readily available about the diverse languages spoken by 
L.A. cabbies, a New York survey turned up more than 70 languages or dialects, 
according to former New York taxi commissioner Gorman Gilbert, who now is 
president of Taxi Systems in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Taxi Systems is installing computer display screens in half of its 550 cabs, 
with the remainder scheduled to be outfitted by January. The screens may boost 
"valet" services, according to Hauck, because more detailed instructions can be 
typed and retained on the screen. For regular cab customers, pertinent 
information can be stored in the computer's memory. 
</P>
<P>
The Taxi Systems executive says he is eager to explore the potential of such 
non-traditional services, both for his company's revenue growth and the 
convenience of consumers. As an example, he cites his own recent experience 
after locking himself out of his car. After pricing the cost of hiring a 
locksmith on a Sunday morning, Hauck said he called a cab to deliver a spare 
set of keys from his home because the cab was cheaper and quicker. 
</P>
<P>
Although such customers are atypical, some Angelenos already rely on cabs to 
transport elderly parents or even their children to after-school activities, 
Hauck says, while some big downtown law firms maintain an account for the sake 
of employees who need public transportation after working late at night. 
</P>
<P>
Taxi Systems' biggest customer for package deliveries is the American Red Cross 
Blood Services, which uses cabs to deliver blood to hospitals in Los Angeles 
and Orange Counties in emergencies. According to Hauck, the monthly tab climbed 
as high as $10,000 until the Red Cross reduced its usage. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather not discuss the money volume," says Jim Darden, associate director 
of product management for the Red Cross unit, but he confirms that the Red 
Cross uses the cab service when demand exceeds the Red Cross' ability to 
deliver with its own 70 vehicles and employees. Darden says he tries to avoid 
using cabs because "they're expensive." But in terms of reliability, "they've 
been very good." 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, the Department of Conservation's documents are routinely 
accompanied into the cab by an employee -- and it was the human factor that 
recently landed the agency in trouble, according to Howard Sarasohn, the 
Department of Conservation's chief deputy director. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a case of a new employee who got a little bit carried away," said 
Sarasohn, explaining that the messenger had an unfortunate habit of letting the 
cab meter run while waiting for documents on a return run. In three months' 
time, the cab fare matched the agency's normal cab expenditures for a full 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The employee is no longer with the agency, and the state Board of Control 
eventually agreed that the cab company should be paid. Sarasohn, noting that 
his agency has six different locations in Sacramento, defends the practice of 
using cabs and notes that many state employees are authorized to use a plastic 
credit card to facilitate a cab company's billing. "Actually," says Sarasohn, 
"it is a very efficient way to operate if you need to go short distances in a 
crowded city."

MEMO: TALE OF THREE CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles licenses about 1,150 cabs -- scarcely one-tenth the 
number (11,787) of authorized cabs cruising New York City. 
</P>
<P>
To own a cab in New York, one must purchase a "medallion" that typically sells 
for a whopping $140,000. In Los Angeles, an owner/operator buys into a taxicab 
association for an initial cost of about $27,000. 
</P>
<P>
On average, Los Angeles suspends two or three drivers a week for overcharging, 
discourtesy or other infractions, according to Department of Transportation 
Engineer David G. Leatherman. In New York City, 137 cab drivers were recently 
suspended in a single week, according to Tony Carter, a spokesman for that 
city's Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, courtesy seems to abound north of the border. In Toronto -- which 
boasts about 3,300 licensed cabs -- suspensions average a mere 50 drivers a 
year for similar infractions, according to Roy Van Veen, director of 
administration for the Metropolitan Licensing Commission. Taxi drivers in 
Toronto are expected to be "civil and well-behaved," Van Veen said. "I guess 
it's tradition. Cab drivers know the rules." KATHRYN HARRIS

SOVIET OPERA, PLAY OPEN SAN DIEGO ARTS FEST; 
</P>
<P>
SPEECHES WELCOME A FINE 'BORIS GODUNOV' AT CIVIC THEATRE 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is always a bad sign when microphones are set up in front of the curtain. 
That means speeches will delay the start of the significant business at hand. 
That also can mean self-congratulation, puffery exchanges and socio-political 
hyperbole. 
</P>
<P>
And so it was Saturday night at the Civic Theatre. First Ian D. Campbell, 
general director of the San Diego Opera, welcomed the dressy crowd to the 
opening of his company's 25th anniversary season. So much for lyrical throat 
clearing. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Mayor Maureen O'Connor came on to gush about the simultaneous 
inauguration of the San Diego Arts Festival, a three-week extravaganza 
subtitled "Treasures of the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight," she declared, "San Diego has come of age as a great cosmopolitan 
city." Ignoring any possible separation of church, state and art, she invoked 
blessings from on high. 
</P>
<P>
Then she introduced Mikhail Gribanov, the Soviet deputy minister of culture, 
whose name seemed to escape her. Through an interpreter, he spoke of cultural 
perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's forget the bad sides of our relationship," he suggested, eliciting 
enthusiastic applause. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it was time for "Boris Godunov," and a rather good "Boris Godunov" it 
was. The fuss proved generally worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
Although one couldn't tell it from the program magazine, this did not turn out 
to be Modest Mussorgsky's "Boris." It was Rimsky-Korsakov's time-dishonored, 
slickly prettified version of Mussorgsky's sprawling, forceful and primitive 
original. 
</P>
<P>
The staging, moreover, fell a bit short of the festive ideal. Nathaniel 
Merrill, the seasoned director from the old Met of Rudolf Bing, kept 
vacillating between detailed realism and stock stylization. (The Russian masses 
went in for slice-of-life violence in the Kromy Forest but impersonated the 
stationary Imperial Choral Society of Moscow for Boris' coronation.) Wolfram 
Skalicki's clever but flimsy sets, borrowed from Toronto, looked literal one 
moment, sketchy the next. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, none of this mattered too much in context. "Boris Godunov," which San 
Diego last experienced in 1972 with the unforgettable Norman Treigle as the 
tormented czar, can be saved by an authoritative conductor and compelling 
singing actors in the central roles. San Diego provided these in generous 
abundance. 
</P>
<P>
Musical matters were in the sensitive hands of Dzhansug Kakhidze, head of the 
Tbilisi Opera in Georgia and one of Sarah Caldwell's secret weapons last year 
at her coming-of-age Soviet-exchange festival in Boston. Despite limited 
rehearsal time and a somewhat thin-sounding orchestra, he conducted with 
urgency and eloquence predicated on a lifetime of specialized experience. He 
also elicited an inspired performance from the expanded, all-important San 
Diego chorus. 
</P>
<P>
Kakhidze brought with him a Boris and Marina from the Kirov Opera in Leningrad 
plus three secondary principals from his own company in Tbilisi. They all 
testified to the unique values of a national operatic tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Many aficionados still associate the title role with the virtuosic Feodor 
Chaliapin and, in the process, think the challenge must invite vocal indulgence 
and histrionic distortion. More recent Soviet bassos, however, have 
demonstrated the power of restraint. 
</P>
<P>
Tall, relatively youthful and eminently dignified, Alexander Morozov recalls 
such contemporary models as Ivan Petrov and Yevgeni Nesterenko, but he is more 
agitated than the former, more psychologically oriented than the latter. He 
sings with the rolling, wide-ranging, subtly modulated tones that seem to be a 
Russian birthright, commands the stage instantly and savors the expressive 
impact of concentration and economy. 
</P>
<P>
Gia Asatiani, as the old monk Pimen, complemented him with a slightly darker 
and rougher basso. Despite his reliance on standard gestures, both dramatic and 
vocal, he was imposing. Omar Khoperia, the third member of this low-voiced 
Soviet triumvirate, introduced a hearty Varlaam who could be humorous without 
resorting to buffo cliche and who scored his points with parlando finesse. 
</P>
<P>
Irina Bogachova replaced the originally announced Elena Obraztsova, as Marina. 
She conveyed the princess' wily, regal allure with much persuasion, even if her 
lush mezzo-soprano was sometimes compromised by unsteadiness under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
In the climactic laments of the Simpleton -- laments made somewhat redundant by 
the reinstatement of the St. Basil Cathedral episode -- Teimuraz Gugushvili 
capitalized on the luxury of a golden bel-canto tenor rather than the scratchy 
sighs and whimpers to which we are accustomed. He was magnetic. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans in the huge cast held their own, for the most part, honorably. 
Allan Glassman sang the music of the false Dmitri ardently, acted with 
convincing obsession and physically depicted the character fastidiously -- lame 
arm, warts and all. Stephen West mustered a persuasive, Mephistophelian 
Rangoni. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Jane Howe contributed a lusty Innkeeper, Martha Jane Weaver a sweetly 
feeble old Nurse. Sylvia Wen oozed proper purity as Xenia. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Booth, on the other hand, suggested little of the crucial duplicity of 
Prince Shuisky, and Julia Jamison looked far stronger than she sounded as the 
Tsarevitch, Feodor. Next to his Georgian sidekick, Bernard Fitch seemed 
unusually bland as the vagabond monk Missail.

KEDG-FM, which won a court battle to refer to itself as K-LITE, has received 
approval from the Federal Communications Commission to change its call letters 
to KLIT-FM. The station will continue to play the current mix of adult 
contemporary "soft hits" with no changes in personnel, music or frequency 
(101.9). KLIT program director Lawrence Tanter explained the moved by saying, 
"The call-letter change is reflective of our slogan K-LITE and will certainly 
assist the editors at the ratings services in giving us accurate credit." The 
station, owned by Golden West Broadcasters, has suffered from fairly low 
ratings. Claudia Puig

HOME TEAM ADVANTAGE IS LOST ON TV SPORTS STAFFS

Sure, the rather mundane chore of reporting the scores of the day is a simple, 
almost trivial thing. At the Columbia School of Journalism, it is far down on 
the list of weighty topics for the professors and students to discuss. The 
relative merits of television news' approach to game results will never be a 
subject worthy of a George Will-Sam Donaldson debate on national television. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the local television sports departments' method of reporting the scores is 
a daily, never-ending source of frustration for some sports fans. And it's a 
pretty good example of the difference in the fundamental philosophies of 
newspapers and television toward the news. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every newspaper in the country follows a specific style -- listing the 
visiting team first, home team second -- in box scores. A fan can pick up the 
newspaper, look at the box score and know instantly which team played at home. 
This is particularly important in football and basketball games, since the home 
team has a considerable advantage. 
</P>
<P>
This same, very simple formula is followed on scoreboards, junior high school 
newsletters, baseball cards and just about every other place scores are listed. 
When they flash scores from around the country on the scoreboard during games 
at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, a fan knows instantly which team played at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
But the local television sports departments -- and their counterparts 
throughout the country -- look at it differently. When they roll the scores, 
they never follow this accepted style, prefering to either list the winner 
first or not follow any pattern at all. Unless the sportscaster mentions 
something about it, the viewer has no idea which team had the home field 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's far easier for the eye to adapt to (listing) the winning team on top," 
explained KGTV (Channel 10) sportscaster Larry Sacknoff. 
</P>
<P>
KFMB-TV (Channel 8) has a much more succinct reason for listing the winning 
team first. 
</P>
<P>
"Ted likes it that way," said Channel 8 sports producer Louis Weiner, referring 
to the ratings god of local sportscasters, Ted Leitner. It's the way they've 
always done it. 
</P>
<P>
KNSD-TV (Channel 39) sports producer Rich Rudy, a former Channel 8 sports 
producer, has heard all the arguments before, which means he's had a chance to 
mull it over. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been asked a few times about it recently," he said. In baseball, he 
noted, the home team doesn't matter that much to viewers. In basketball the 
numbers are so large that it would be much harder for the viewer to determine 
the winner if the winning team was not listed first, Rudy said. 
</P>
<P>
"The scores are not up there for very long," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This all makes it sound as if they are presenting the scores on flash cards, 
which, in a sense, they are. Given the local explanations, the results 
apparently are presented, by design, so quickly that people can comprehend only 
the minimal amount of information -- specifically, who played and who won. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, some big thinkers in the television industry were paid thousands of 
dollars to determine how much information television viewers can absorb in the 
least amount of time. 
</P>
<P>
That's great. It's probably very scientific, and clearly makes a lot of sense 
to people in television. 
</P>
<P>
But sports fans also want to know where the games were played. 
</P>
<P>
A whopping 45% of the respondents to a recent New York Times-CBS News Poll on 
Vice President Dan Quayle said they "haven't heard enough about him yet to have 
an opinion," which may explain why KNSD-TV (Channel 39) was able to arrange a 
half-hour interview with Quayle last week. It was the first extended interview 
Quayle has granted to a local station since assuming office, part of a new 
strategy designed to give Quayle a chance to express himself outside the glare 
of the national spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"Strategy is a harsh word," countered Liz Murphy, Quayle's deputy press 
secretary. But she said Quayle hopes to do more in-depth interviews with local 
TV stations like the one he taped for Channel 39 last week, instead of the 
usual quickie interviews at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 39 was given the honor of doing the first simply because they bothered 
to ask. The Vice President's staff had been discussing the general concept of 
doing sit-down interviews when Channel 39's Amy Michael contacted it about the 
possibility of Quayle being a guest on "San Diego Headliners." 
</P>
<P>
"The idea (of doing the interview) actually came from the request," Murphy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Other San Diego stations tried to get Quayle, including "Inside San Diego," but 
it was too late. He only had time for one. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Channel 39) contacted me first," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
After a high-level staff meeting, executives of the "CBS This Morning" show 
told KFMB-TV Channel 8 weatherman Larry Mendte, in New York to fill in on the 
program last week, that he couldn't wear his sneakers on the air. He had to go 
out and buy shoes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Thanks go to "P.M. Magazine" for doing a retrospective program, reminding 
viewers how many truly boring stories the show has done in 10 years. With only 
30 minutes to recap 10 years, they seemed to be struggling to kill time. 
Popcorn king Orville Redenbacher was the highlight, which just about sums it 
up. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps displaying some personal feelings, former Channel 8 reporter Loren 
Nancarrow, closing a report on the Bay Area earthquake Tuesday from KPIX in San 
Francisco, said, "Southern California is looking more appealing now." But it's 
still a long way off for Nancarrow. Negotiations for his return to Channel 8 
have broken down, primarily because KPIX wants to keep him. . . . 
</P>

Former Channel 39 reporter Jody Hammond took the stand last week in Naomi 
O'Hara's suit against the station. O'Hara, identified in a 1983 grand jury 
report as kissing and hugging then-County Supervisor Paul Eckert in a 
restaurant parking lot, is suing the station for incorrectly referring to her 
as an "alleged prostitute." Hammond, now with Channel 8, admitted that she 
simply picked up the story about the grand jury report from the San Diego 
Tribune, but accidentally confused O'Hara with alleged prostitute Christine 
Cole. The practice of picking up stories from newspapers is not unusual for 
television reporters, although they rarely admit it. . . .

Newsroom personnel at KSDO-AM (1130) last week voted to join the American 
Federation of Television and Radio Artists. . . . Instead of giving $10,000 to 
contest winners Thursday, KFMB-FM (B100) gave the money to the American Red 
Cross earthquake relief effort.

Comedian Joan Rivers and writer Ben Stein have agreed to settle her $50 million 
libel lawsuit over his magazine story alleging she joked about the death of her 
husband. Rivers agreed to drop the lawsuit and Stein agreed to donate money to 
charities of her choosing. Richard Grant, Rivers' publicist, said further 
details of the settlement will not be disclosed. The Stein story was published 
in GQ magazine in December, 1987. The article described "certain events and 
conversations prior to and just after the tragic death of Joan Rivers' husband, 
Edgar Rosenberg," the statement said. Rivers contended the conversations never 
took place. Stein said he used sources he believed to be reliable. He said the 
settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing. Stein and the magazine said they 
"sincerely regret any inadvertent imputation of negative or inappropriate 
conduct." Claudia Puig

SOVIET VAN CLIBURN WINNER TO DISPLAY VIRTUOSO TALENT IN S.D. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
To pianist Alexei Sultanov, equivocation is an unknown state of mind. When the 
19-year-old Soviet won the gold medal in this year's Van Cliburn International 
Piano Competition in Fort Worth, he modestly stated, "I came here with one 
object only: to take top prize or nothing." 
</P>
<P>
The flashy, self-confident pianist from Tashkent (Uzbeck, U.S.S.R.) will 
perform a solo recital Tuesday at San Diego's College Avenue Baptist Church as 
part of the current Soviet arts festival. Sultanov has just begun his 
staggering 200-concert schedule, a two-year itinerary of solo and orchestral 
engagements he garnered as the Cliburn gold medalist. 
</P>
<P>
Sultanov's hard-edged determination to study piano rather than either of the 
instruments his musical parents played can be summed up in a childhood 
anecdote. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother plays the violin," he explained, "and she tried to teach me violin 
when I was 3 years old. But after four lessons, I smashed the violin on the 
floor. Then my father tried to teach me cello, but after the second lesson he 
understood that his instrument was also in danger. Then they allowed me to 
start piano lessons." 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Sultanov was in Detroit, where he played Chopin's Second Piano 
Concerto (one of the Van Cliburn Competition concertos) with the Detroit 
Symphony under guest conductor Raymond Harvey. Reached by phone at his hotel, 
Sultanov answered questions in confident English and in a particularly good 
mood. 
</P>
<P>
"My father came to travel with me in America for two weeks," Sultanov said. "In 
Detroit we went shopping a little, and we will have some time to look around 
the city." 
</P>
<P>
Because Sultanov must travel alone for most of his concert tour, his father's 
presence was cause for the high spirits. 
</P>
<P>
"He used to play cello in an orchestra and a string quartet, but now he teaches 
music in Moscow." 
</P>
<P>
But winning the Cliburn in mid-June and embarking on this tour has not been one 
long standing ovation. Sultanov regrets that he has not been able to perform a 
gala homecoming program in Moscow, where he has lived since he was 13. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been able to spend very little time at home -- less than a week -- since 
the competition. There was no time for a recital in those few days, and it 
looks like it will be two years before I can play in the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Before the Cliburn, Sultanov had played concerts in West Germany and the Soviet 
Union. Since his American debut in June, he has noted little difference between 
the reactions of Soviet and American audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that people are the same everywhere, although now I am much more 
popular in America than I am in the Soviet Union because I have no concerts in 
the Soviet Union. American audiences are one of the most warm in my 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Sultanov, who was the youngest of the 38 Van Cliburn competitors, had been 
carefully groomed for the Texas competition by the Soviet musical 
establishment. His teacher at the Moscow State Conservatory, L. N. Naumov, had 
also coached Vladimir Virado, the Russian pianist who won the 1973 Van Cliburn 
gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
According to competition jurist Ralph Votapek, who won the first Van Cliburn 
gold medal, the five Russian pianists who sent audition tapes to the 
competition had been carefully hand-picked to represent the Soviet Union. Not 
surprisingly, four of these pianists were invited to compete in Fort Worth, and 
three Russians made the cut of the six finalists. 
</P>
<P>
Sultanov is eager to record a pair of piano concertos with the London Symphony 
under Soviet emigre conductor Maxim Shostakovich (son of composer Dmitri 
Shostakovich). In an article in the September issue of Musical America 
magazine, Van Cliburn judge Shostakovich unabashedly declared his advocacy of 
Sultanov from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a great musician -- a real talent," said Shostakovich. "I listened to 
three bars (of Sultanov's initial videotaped audition) and was sure he must be 
the gold medalist." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Sultanov and Shostakovich will record two grand, Romantic 
Russian works, Tchaikovsky's Third Piano Concerto and Rachmaninoff's Second 
Piano Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
Sultanov's San Diego program will include Haydn's E-flat Major Sonata, Chopin's 
Scherzo in B-flat Minor, Liszt's "Mephisto" Waltz, and a pair of Russian works 
-- Scriabin's Fifth Sonata and Prokofiev's Seventh Sonata. 
</P>
<P>
"I chose the Prokofiev because he is very popular in America, I think. Scriabin 
is not played here much, but I wanted to show people his wonderful, highly 
individual music." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for Sultanov's 8 p.m. recital at College Avenue Baptist Church are 
available through the San Diego Youth Symphony, the event's co-sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
According to youth symphony board president Mike Iverson, San Diego Mayor 
O'Connor has given his organization the responsibility to dole out about 1,100 
seats in the church. He said the mayor wanted tickets to go first to piano 
teachers and their students, and secondly to children who were interested in 
music. The remaining tickets will then be available to the general public.

PHOTOGRAPHY LIES AND TRICKS ARE FOCUS OF 'INVESTIGATIONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Four Los Angeles artists in their 30s blithely spin a few fantasies to 
demonstrate how photographs lie. Their targets are not just photographs, but 
any type of information that reaches us at second hand. 
</P>
<P>
Gathered under the title "Deliberate Investigations" at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art (to Nov. 12), installations by David Bunn, Una Barth, Connie 
Hatch and Dede Bazyk range from complex and clever to simple-minded. You have 
to work pretty hard to get to the bottom of things, but the effort is nearly 
always worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
Bunn's piece "Curvature (Some Projections)" sets up competing systems of 
classification. Based on Frederick Kiesler's 1942 design for Peggy Guggenheim's 
gallery, Art of This Century, the installation is as tricky and self-reflective 
as a hall of mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
The dislocating effect begins with the strange, convex shape of the 
birch-paneled room. The walls are studded with wood brackets holding what 
appear to be colorful tiles. Actually, they are Polaroids of out-of-focus 
details from maps. 
</P>
<P>
A series of 12 "guides" to the installation provide sources for fragments of 
information painted on the wood brackets. But each guide offers a different 
frame of reference, pertaining to Guggenheim, her gallery or even the 
geographical regions in the photos. 
</P>
<P>
As you immerse yourself in it, this witty, extraordinarily intelligent piece 
begins to suggest an analog to the way the mind sifts through immense 
quantities of information that may reaffirm, negate or enlarge on facts the 
brain already has stored away. 
</P>
<P>
Una Barth groups black-and-white photographs and abstract images taken from 
various sources to create a heightened awareness of seeing as a visceral 
activity. The work forces you to become aware of the visceral activity of 
looking and the invasive bullying nature of shock effects. In "Untitled No. 6, 
Configuration No. 2," Barth juxtaposes images of a helicopter's beam in the 
night sky with a solar eclipse, a dizzying sunburst pattern and a woman picked 
out of the darkness by a conical beam of light. The abrupt light and dark 
contrasts, the optical strain induced by the graphic pattern and the emphasis 
on both revelation and concealment create a cruelly intense effect. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Hatch's photo-and-text installation, "Some Americans" from "A Display of 
Visual Inequity: Forced to Disappear," makes for some fascinating reading. But 
the visual and visceral impact of the piece doesn't have enough oomph. 
</P>
<P>
Illuminated by lights on the floor, 24 black-and-white photo-transparencies of 
faces cast elongated shadows of themselves on the wall. The faces belong to 
people who have "disappeared" -- died before their time or simply vanished due 
to causes beyond their control. 
</P>
<P>
The images come from various sources: the face of a little girl who disappeared 
from her home, from a carpet-cleaning ad; the image of the blues singer Bessie 
Smith, who died after being denied admittance to a "whites only" hospital, from 
an album cover. Texts explain the circumstances of each case. 
</P>
<P>
But the lighting effects -- which also cause the viewer's shadow to fall across 
the images -- aren't sufficiently dramatic to create a sense of the 
"transitoriness of memory," as the catalogue suggests, or notion that the 
viewer is momentarily blotting out history. 
</P>
<P>
Culled from biology textbooks, Bazyk's brightly colored, hugely enlarged 
free-standing and hanging models of blood cells, bones, pupae and other 
biological imagery have the inviting, fun-zone look of a children's museum 
display. But the premise behind this installation -- that science today offers 
only cold, irrelevant theories rather than warm, friendly facts we can observe 
for ourselves -- seems confused.

NO SURPRISES IN 3RD NIGHT OF STONES N' ROSES 
</P>

The third Stones N' Roses show at the Coliseum Saturday was routine as the 47th 
date on an 80-city tour, a bread-and-butter show in Ames, Iowa, or someplace 
with a weekend party crowd. Nobody threatened to break down, no one fell off 
the stage, and the Stones had to manage the blues segment without the help of 
Eric Clapton. Living Colour's leering dedication of "Glamour Boys" to Arsenio 
Hall was about as racy as it got. 
</P>
<P>
Guns N' Roses even managed to play a couple of songs without speeches or Angst, 
though the band was kind of listless until Axl Rose woke them up with a little 
press-bashing 15 minutes into the set -- controversy is to Guns N' Roses what 
gasoline is to a car. Rose has never been what you'd call publicly repentant 
about those famous lyrics, but in an apparent show of solidarity with the gay 
community, he performed "Rocket Queen" clad in nothing but black leather 
jacket, motorcycle cap and bare-bottom chaps, mooning the audience while Slash 
soloed on guitar. 
</P>
<P>
The Stones' stage set still looked like a cross between an airport runway at 
night and the entire city of Irwindale, they still spent a lot of time covering 
the disco years, and Jagger still told the same jokes before the same songs. 
(After 26 years, the Stones don't have a lot to get off their chests.) "Dead 
Flowers" occupied the optional-song spot on the set-list -- you could tell 
because there wasn't an elaborately timed light show. And the Stones still 
sounded best where they were closest to the blues.

PERLMAN OPENS CELEBRITY SERIES AT MUSIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There must be some sort of physical law that makes artists who perform often 
and worldwide fall into a programming rut. That seems to be the case with 
Itzhak Perlman, who on Saturday evening opened the Los Angeles Philharmonic's 
Celebrity Series at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake: The violinist played with a level of precision and refinement 
few can equal. He exhibited nearly faultless bow control and technical 
accuracy. His tone was as pure and silken as it has ever been. And he exuded an 
easygoing amiability that makes his recitals truly pleasurable. 
</P>
<P>
But pleasurable does not mean satisfying. The listener left the hall 
half-sated, for only about half the program proved truly substantial. 
</P>
<P>
In Bach's Partita No. 3, the evening's most memorable installment, Perlman 
delineated phrases with poetic eloquence and infused his playing with 
invigorating rhythm, all the while maintaining an unflagging, fluid line. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrating great expressivity and arching lyricism, the violinist and 
pianist Janet Goodman Guggenheim teamed up to offer a sweeping account of 
Faure's First Sonata, a compelling early work. 
</P>
<P>
Beethoven's E-flat Sonata, however, which opened the program, is not from the 
composer's top drawer. Both musicians nonetheless brought clear definition, 
stylish elegance and fine ensemble to their performance, though the violinist 
asserted a bit too much during the Finale. 
</P>
<P>
As is his wont, Perlman devoted the last quarter of his recital to trifles, 
announced from the stage, by Ponce, Pergolesi, Moszkowski, Gershwin and 
Sarasate, only the last an actual encore. TERRY McQUILKIN

RECENT MCGURTY WORKS AT SANTA MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his prefatory remarks to a concert of music by Mark McGurty on Friday, the 
venerable lexicographer Nicolas Slonimsky stated flatly that no music 
dictionary, not even his own, could adequately describe McGurty's music. He's 
probably right. But the six works by the 34-year-old Los Angeles composer heard 
at the Santa Monica Museum of Art did leave some strong impressions. 
</P>
<P>
The premiere of McGurty's attractive Fantasy for flute and piano revealed a 
melodic technique used, more or less, in most of his music. The flute line 
consists of small sets of notes, not necessarily close in range, rapidly and 
randomly repeated and then added to and melded with another set. The first set 
is left behind and the process continues. This technique has a way of centering 
a musical line, and in the case of the Fantasy gave the flute part, skillfully 
played by Susan Pezzone, a modal, rhapsodic, almost improvisatory quality. 
</P>
<P>
In his arresting "Anatole Cycle," a setting of 205 fragments by Mallarme on the 
death of the son of the poet, McGurty deliberately limited his means for 
dramatic effect. The baritone sings long, sustained, emotive lines over a 
narrow range, the speaker delivers understated, though pained, monologue, and 
the piano provides jagged, kaleidoscopic commentary, framing and creating the 
emotional context. A sigh of relief from someone in the audience was heard at 
its conclusion. Baritone Edward Levy, pianist Vicki Ray and speaker Anne Marie 
Ketchum gave it a convincing reading. 
</P>
<P>
Both of the complex, gnarled piano sonatas (1985 and 1989) build frenetic 
momentum through quickening of activity, thickening of texture and thundering 
dynamics. Bryan Pezzone was the virtuosic, aggressive soloist in both. 
</P>
<P>
Also heard, the thorny "Anniversary Album" for solo violin, faithfully 
dispatched by Cynthia McGurty, and Four Songs, a gently swaying, spacey setting 
of Paul Eluard poems, ably performed by soprano Deborah Mayhan and pianist 
Vicki Ray. TIMOTHY MANGAN

MOUNTAIN BOYS FEUD WITH MAFIA IN 'NEXT OF KIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Next of Kin" (citywide), Patrick Swayze plays Truman Gates, hillbilly cop 
in Chicago, hunting for the big-city Mafia varmint who killed his kin and 
trying to ward off the even more dangerous vendettas of his other backwoods 
brother, Briar (Liam Neeson). 
</P>
<P>
It's the Mafia vs. the Mountain Boys, with Fish out of Water, Feudin' and 
Fussin'. This collection of marketing hooks was strung together by two writers, 
Michael Jenning and Jeb Stuart, who seem to have done most of their research on 
rural America and big city crime by watching old Walter Hill movies. 
</P>
<P>
To call this story a collection of hackneyed stereotypes would be complimenting 
it. "Next of Kin" doesn't have the logic of a good cliche. After a fairly good, 
tense opening, it keeps rolling up one preposterous scene after another: wild 
man Briar's one-against-a-dozen antics as he challenges the Cosa Nostra on 
their own stomping grounds; lone studs swaggering into dangerous locales and 
challenging everybody; Michael J. Pollard's cuddly grimaces as an inexplicably 
friendly hotel clerk; the Three Stooges antics of a clownish Mafia hit man; 
bizarrely loose-mouthed killers confessing everything over vino and tape 
recorders, and Truman's unusual relationship with his classical violinist wife, 
Jessie -- who plays fiddle in the hills and leaves the country folk rapt with 
wonderment. 
</P>
<P>
In the long-suffering but competent cast, Baldwin is memorably nasty as the 
chief killer and Neeson has appropriated a set of vocal inflections that, on 
closer inspection, seem to be Ben Johnson's. Director John Irvin gives it all a 
patina of quality, including smoky Steven Poster cinematography that suggests 
Vilmos Szigmond with his glasses fogged, and a pump-them-up score by Jack 
Nitzsche. 
</P>
<P>
If this machismo-tipsy movie were a little sillier, it might qualify as a 
classic of dumb camp. By the end, when we discover that the feudin' cousins and 
the fussin' Cosa Nostra are all basically good old boys -- or maybe "good old, 
good olds" -- and also that you can blow away half of Chicago and stage a 
massacre in a graveyard without even waking up the neighbors, you may be ready 
to break out the moonshine or break out of the movie theater. Either one is 
preferable to watching "Next of Kin" (MPAA rated R for violence).

S.F. BALLET MAKES STRONG FINISH IN COSTA MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Francisco Ballet closed its run at the Orange County Performing Arts Center 
in Costa Mesa over the weekend with a program that made a surprising point. The 
further away it got from classical vocabulary, the better it looked. 
</P>
<P>
In ascending order of impact, the company offered artistic director Helgi 
Tomasson's new "Handel -- A Celebration"; the athletic follies and competitions 
of Jerome Robbins' "Interplay" (1945), and the hyperkinetic Expressionism of 
Jiri Kylian's "Forgotten Land" (1981). 
</P>
<P>
The ghost of Balanchine hovered over Tomasson's 10-part, neoclassical homage to 
Handel (to a compiled score) but the results, though never in bad taste, proved 
uninspired and unmusical. 
</P>
<P>
Tomasson tended to rely upon rote symmetrical groupings, occasionally skewering 
formal patterns and classical vocabulary, though often apparently, arbitrarily 
so. Two pas de deux dropped the neoclassic look altogether and boldly ventured 
into romantic idioms. 
</P>
<P>
He also occasionally dug from the cliche pile -- such as juxtaposing a lyric 
and a hectic pas de deux to the same music. But the primary problem was the 
threadbare, poverty of movement. You waited for the choreography to fill out 
the music, but it never happened. 
</P>
<P>
Some choices were unfortunate. He cast the superb, Kirov-trained Ludmila 
Lopukhova against type, requiring her to execute speedy, slinky-distorted moves 
a la Balanchine. Though fully capably of fast dancing, Lopukhova, on Friday and 
at the Saturday matinee, only looked badly utilized, and was further subjected 
to the indignity of being turned head over feet in the air by the corps of 
eight men. 
</P>
<P>
Making a cautious first appearance with the company at the Saturday matinee was 
Yuri Zhukov, the Kirov corps member who joined the San Franciscans for a 
nine-month guest stint right after the Leningrad-based company danced in Orange 
County in August. 
</P>
<P>
Zhukov seemed distant, uninvolved. He had a bad landing in his otherwise secure 
variation and partnered a vivid, sweet Sabina Allemann with patrician 
restraint. But at least he didn't smugly court the audience as did his Friday 
counterpart, Anthony Randazzo. 
</P>
<P>
The company looked better in Robbins' high-spirited "Interplay" (set to Morton 
Gould's "American Concertette"). Christopher Stowell excelled with airy 
lightness -- holding shapes in the air, bounding from text-book correct 
position and tossing off the step-over, hopping turns with virtuosic security. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, a good-natured David Justin at the matinee seemed underpowered and 
overly careful in his preparations. But he also made some fine airy corkscrew 
turns and clean landings. 
</P>
<P>
A coolish Elizabeth Loscavio and a supportive Alexi Zubiria danced the pas de 
deux on Friday; a secure Grace Maduell and an overtaxed Barton Parker II on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Both casts in "Forgotten Land" (to Britten's Sinfonia da Requiem) brought 
riveting commitment and energy to Kylian's abstract, whirlwind depiction of 
communal calamity, grief and transcendance. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Cisneros showed slashing power and non-stop dramatic momentum Friday in 
the first pas de deux; Jamie Zimmerman, with her limpid port de bras, evoked 
more poignancy Saturday. Each was partnered by the noble, technically strong 
Lawrence Pech. 
</P>
<P>
Jo Ellen Arntz and Andre Reyes were the shot-from-guns duo in the demonic 
Scherzo on Friday; Joanna Berman and Stowell took over the roles with equal 
power on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
A radiant Alaina Albertson was partnered by Randazzo (Friday) and Edward 
Ellison (Saturday). Both men proved strong. 
</P>
<P>
Denis de Coteau conducted a sometimes ragged Pacific Symphony with deep 
sympathy for Britten's score and few insights into Handel's music. Roy Bogas 
was the expert piano soloist in Gould's "American Concertette."

POWER-SHARING PLAN APPROVED FOR LEBANON

<P>
Breaking a three-week deadlock in talks for ending Lebanon's civil war, the 
Lebanese Parliament agreed Sunday on a historic political reform plan that will 
for the first time share power equally between Christians and Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, given unofficial approval just before midnight after last-minute 
consultations with Damascus, also provides for withdrawal of Syrian forces to 
eastern Lebanon. And there is a guarantee that Lebanon's national sovereignty, 
eclipsed by 14 years of civil war and a long procession of foreign occupation 
troops, will eventually be restored. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks be to God that we have reached this point. After 23 days of hard work, 
night and day, we are now in final agreement," Youssef Hammoud, a Shiite Muslim 
deputy, told reporters as Lebanese journalists broke into applause. 
</P>
<P>
The future of the plan was far from certain, however. Lebanon's Christian 
leader, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, said in Beirut that it does not meet his 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the 61 deputies convened a full session to finalize the details of 
the compromise peace plan, Arab League envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi flew to Beirut to 
deliver word of the accord to the heads of Lebanon's two embattled governments 
-- Aoun, who heads the army, and his Muslim rival, Salim Hoss. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament is scheduled to convene a final session Tuesday in the Saudi port 
city of Jidda to endorse the new national reconciliation charter before 
returning to Beirut to officially adopt it and begin putting the reforms into 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
But even with agreement on opening the doors to Lebanon's Muslim majority and 
phasing out the religious sectarianism that has so divided the country, the 
fledgling plan still faces trouble in Beirut, where Aoun over the past several 
days has remained stubbornly opposed. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun said at a news conference that the plan does not meet his demands for a 
specific timetable for Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon, the Associated Press 
reported from Beirut. He said that he accepts political changes giving more 
power to Muslims, "but I reject the part concerning Lebanese sovereignty. We 
don't know what the Syrian role will be in Lebanon -- what for and how long." 
</P>
<P>
Aoun proposed putting the peace plan to a referendum of the Lebanese people 
since, he asserted, the parliamentary deputies "exceeded their jurisdiction and 
legal powers by voting in . . . ambiguities that compromise Lebanon's 
sovereignty." 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate reaction from Hoss, the AP reported. 
</P>
<P>
Unexpectedly, Muslim militia representatives who had repeatedly denounced the 
charter's failure to immediately abolish the religious basis for political 
power in Lebanon said they would support the reform plan, with reservations. 
</P>
<P>
"We shall struggle by logic, not by arms," declared Zaher Khatib, whose 
National Front includes the Shiite movement Amal and the Druze sect, a Muslim 
offshoot. "We will not be an obstacle to the reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
Maronite Christian deputies appealed Sunday to the Vatican and to Lebanon's 
Christian patriarch to help coalesce support for the compromise, which would 
end the Maronites' 46-year domination of Lebanon in exchange for the hope of 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
The reform talks convened in this Saudi mountain resort on Sept. 30, shortly 
after an Arab League committee negotiated a cease-fire in Aoun's six-month-long 
"war of liberation" and drafted a proposed charter for reforming the imbalance 
of political power in Lebanon that has fueled the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Christian deputies had resisted any move to relinquish their authority, 
however, as long as the plan contained no firm timetable for withdrawal of the 
40,000 Syrian troops that now control two-thirds of the country and, through 
Damascus, dominate much of the decision-making in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise plan provides at least that Syrian troops will withdraw into the 
Bekaa region of eastern Lebanon within two years of the adoption of a new 
government and political reforms, with the precise timing and location of the 
withdrawal to be worked out by a joint Lebanese-Syrian military committee. 
</P>
<P>
But Christian East Beirut deputies remained opposed early Sunday to a proposal, 
backed by Syria, to increase the number of deputies in the Parliament to 128 
from 99. The Christians have insisted that the National Assembly be limited to 
108 members. 
</P>
<P>
Under either scenario, the Parliament would be evenly divided between Muslims 
and Christians, but Lebanon's old-line politicians, heavily represented among 
the Christians, have perceived a large infusion of new deputies, many of whom 
would come from the warring militia groups that now rule Lebanon, as a threat 
to the nation's traditional power brokers. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more importantly, the 128-deputy scenario contains a provision that 
would allow, for the first time, three of the 64 Muslim deputies to be 
Alawites, a Shiite sect of which Syria's president, Hafez Assad, is a member. 
Muslim seats now are allocated among Sunnis, Shiites and Druze. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, three Alawite seats in the Parliament would give Assad a direct 
pipeline into the national government, and Christian deputies held off on any 
approval until Syria reportedly agreed Sunday not to insist on the 128-deputy 
plan, according to sources close to the Christian faction. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud al Faisal, 
telephoned Syria's foreign minister Sunday and relayed Syria's assent on the 
108-seat Parliament to the Christian deputies, who then unanimously agreed to 
the reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
Once the plan went before the full Parliament Sunday night, there was 
additional opposition from two deputies representing the National Front. 
</P>
<P>
Militia leaders and their parliamentary advocates have objected to the 
charter's failure to provide for a rapid end to the religious sectarianism that 
has been both a basis for political power in Lebanon and one of its primary 
sources of conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Lebanon's president has been a Maronite Christian, its prime 
minister a Sunni Muslim and its Parliament Speaker a Shiite, but there is no 
similar position for the Druze sect. 
</P>
<P>
The political reform plan calls for the president, prime minister and Speaker 
to form a committee to discuss abolishing sectarianism in the government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Since 1975, Lebanon has been at war with itself, a conflict marked by political 
upheavals, coups, assassinations and an Israeli invasion. In 1976, a 
30,000-member Arab peacekeeping force dominated by Syrian troops moved in to 
reinforce a cease-fire between Maronite Christian and Muslim forces. Syria has 
been there ever since. The latest conflict began in mid-March, and the fighting 
between the Christian forces of Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun and an alliance of 
Lebanese Druze and Syrian troops has been marked by fearsome artillery 
exchanges, with nearly 900 Lebanese killed and another 4,000 wounded. Much of 
Beirut, the capital that was once hailed as the Paris of the Mideast, has been 
reduced to rubble.

BAY AREA GIRDS FOR TRAFFIC NIGHTMARE; 
</P>
<P>
DISASTER: BASEBALL COMMISSIONER AGREES TO DELAY RENEWAL OF WORLD SERIES GAMES 
UNTIL FRIDAY.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The lucky ones spent Sunday at ease, walking in the park or watching the 49ers 
in the sunshine, but for many thousands in the Bay Area last week's earthquake 
strengthened its grip on their lives -- and threatened new torments this 
morning as commuters try to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned officials urged people to stay home if at all possible, rather than 
attempt the commute on Day 1 of the new era in Bay Area traffic: rush hours 
with no Bay Bridge, no Nimitz Freeway through Oakland, and no Embarcadero 
Freeway or Interstate 280 into downtown San Francisco. Terrible snarls are also 
expected in the Santa Cruz and San Jose areas. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, baseball commissioner Fay Vincent announced that the World 
Series would resume -- but not until Friday -- and in Oakland fresh danger at 
the collapsed Nimitz Freeway forced nearly 200 more people out of their homes 
and curtailed recovery work. 
</P>
<P>
More homes were judged unsafe in the region struck by Tuesday's 6.9 magnitude 
quake, and many residents discovered they could have a long wait for federal 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
But there was also some brightness. The promised rains did not arrive, and Buck 
Helm, the miracle survivor of 90 hours buried in the Nimitz Freeway ruins, 
improved under the care of doctors at Highland Hospital in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Helm was still in critical condition but resting under sedation and breathing 
with the aid of a respirator. Doctors said he could communicate with his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Repairs also began on the Bay Bridge, eerily deserted except for workers who 
lifted out a damaged section of the upper deck. It was carefully lowered onto a 
barge, where repairs will take about a month. 
</P>
<P>
The future of this year's World Series -- the apple of the Bay Area's eye until 
the quake struck at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday, minutes before the first pitch of Game 3 
-- was announced at a press conference held by Vincent and San Francisco mayor 
Art Agnos. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball officials had wanted to resume the series -- matching the two local 
teams, the Giants and Athletics -- back at Candlestick Park on Tuesday, exactly 
a week after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
But Agnos said he told the commissioner in a meeting Saturday that it was 
"unequivocally impossible for us to start on Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said he had no choice but to go along with Agnos. "It was important for 
baseball to know its place," the commissioner said. "He's in charge of this." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said he did not consult Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson. The mayor, reached 
later, said he had mixed emotions. 
</P>
<P>
"On one hand, it seems that the importance of the World Series, in light of 
what we have seen happen here, raises serious questions whether it should be 
played. On the other hand, there is a need to release tension." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson remained firm on an earlier position, saying it is "highly 
inappropriate" to play the World Series in Oakland "as long as we are still 
pulling victims from the freeway." If necessary, the sixth and seventh games 
would be played in the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The new problem at the elevated, double-decked Cypress section of the Nimitz 
Freeway is the cracking and deterioration of support pillars on a portion about 
10 blocks away from the collapsed ruins. 
</P>
<P>
Police went door-to-door ordering about 200 residents of low-income housing 
projects nearby to evacuate. About 15 residents carrying tote bags, suitcases 
and backpacks boarded buses and were taken to Ralph Bunche Elementary School, 
which was opened to house evacuees who needed shelter. Most of the displaced 
found their own shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials said the evacuation may only be for 24 hours while the area 
was shored up, much as the collapsed section of the freeway was strengthened 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"There is very great instability," Caltrans spokesman Kyle Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Four bodies were pulled from the Nimitz debris Sunday, and the body of a woman 
was found in a destroyed apartment building in the Marina District of San 
Francisco. The death toll now stands at 60. About 80 people are still listed as 
missing by Oakland authorities and presumed to be dead in the ruins of the 
Nimitz. 
</P>
<P>
The state Office of Emergency Services announced Sunday that property damage 
had surpassed $6.4 billion, making this the costliest U.S. earthquake in 
history and one of the country's worst natural disasters. Other estimates put 
the damage at near $8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the damage toted so far have become staggering. The agency has 
counted 405 homes, 104 mobile homes, and an unknown number of apartments 
destroyed. Another 107,768 single-family homes have suffered some damage in the 
eight counties affected, an area with a population of more than 5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Both county and state officials caution that the damage figures are still 
incomplete and likely to increase as the Bay Area struggles to recover from the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
"Some counties are still too busy to provide anything but preliminary 
estimates," noted Lisa Covington, a spokeswoman for the state emergency office. 
"When they make a damage estimate, they invariably add the word 'plus.' " 
</P>
<P>
The American Red Cross said more than 10,000 people displaced by the earthquake 
took refuge in its 19 shelters. About 2,000 remained in shelters Sunday, while 
others had moved in with friends or relatives. 
</P>
<P>
As Sunday dawned, churches began to fill. 
</P>
<P>
In Oakland, parishioners of the St. Francis de Sales Cathedral moved services 
to a Baptist church because the cathedral's tower was filled with cracks and 
leaning precariously. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes in life, God shakes us and says 'Pay attention, there is something 
more important than the ordinary things in your life,' " Father Joseph M. 
Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
Archbishop John R. Quinn was at San Francisco's St. Mary Cathedral for a 
special Mass. 
</P>
<P>
He stopped at the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadelupe, patron of the Americas, to 
make an act of entrustment, a ritual that placed San Francisco and all other 
stricken areas "under the protection of Our Lady, asking her to pray that we 
are spared further tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
"My heart beats for the elderly people, who are so affected by the 
uncertainties of this hour," he said. "I weep for the children who are so 
frightened and filled with anxiety. I weep for the parents, who try to console 
and reassure them." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in San Francisco, people jogged, bought hardware, attended movies and 
read the Sunday papers. Young men surfed at Ocean Beach. Couples strolled 
hand-in-hand on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only the Marina, the Bay Bridge and the Cypress structure that got hit. 
For the rest of us, it's just business as usual," said Ronald 
</P>
<P>
Little, a local sign painter, as he strolled at Ocean Beach with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
"We have three children and I assume Halloween is still on for the children," 
said Naomi Galili, as she and her 8-year son picked out pumpkins at a pumpkin 
patch. 
</P>
<P>
The football San Francisco 49ers -- wryly dubbed by some the "6.9ers" after the 
magnitude of the quake that has now surpassed the city's 1906 disaster in 
damage -- played before a larger-than-usual crowd of about 70,000 at Stanford, 
an alternate site chosen so repairs could be made at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
The fans were subdued at first but in the second half got into the spirit of 
the game, which the 49ers won, 37-20, over the New England Patriots. But there 
was a dark lining there, too. Jeff Fuller, a 49ers defensive player, suffered a 
broken neck and was taken from the field on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of luxury hotel rooms in San Francisco that were offered 
free to the earthquake homeless remained empty, partly because people don't 
know about it and partly because some would rather stay in Red Cross shelters. 
</P>
<P>
But those rooms may be snapped up this week as commuters fill the city and 
encounter trouble getting out. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of the Bay Bridge is expected to cause overcrowding at Bay Area Rapid 
Transit subway stations and on trans-bay ferries hurriedly brought from other 
West Coast ports. Closure of the Nimitz Freeway will further disrupt East Bay 
commuting, and the emergency shutdowns of the Embarcadero and Interstate 280 
freeways into downtown San Francisco could turn that side of the bay into a 
jumbled mess. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Diridon, chairman of the nine-county Metropolitan Transit Commission, used 
the strongest terms in urging commuters to cooperate and avoid driving. 
</P>
<P>
"The message is simple. If you find yourself in a single passenger vehicle and 
have not tried very hard to use a car pool or van pool, you're committing an 
antisocial act," Diridon said. "We are in a state of emergency." 
</P>
<P>
"And if we are trying to avert economic disaster, people must be able to get to 
work. This is not business as usual. Everyone is going to have to alter their 
life styles when it comes to commuting in order to maintain economic 
viability." 
</P>
<P>
The transportation crisis was expected to be nearly as bad in the Santa 
Cruz-San Jose area. 
</P>
<P>
California 17, the main link from Santa Cruz into the so-called Silicon Valley 
area, will only be open to car pools of three or more and buses, and they will 
be guided through damaged sections of the highway. 
</P>
<P>
For some, the quake has meant a new experience with public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged woman at an Oakland Bay Area Rapid Transit station stared 
wide-eyed at the subway system map and admitted it was her first time. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like a foreigner in my own city," said the woman, who didn't want to 
give her name. "I have absolutely no idea how this all works." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Founier, 63, a lifelong San Francisco resident, was making only her 
second BART ride, this time under the bay to return home after visiting her 
children in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so nervous, especially after the earthquake," she said, "I usually just 
drive everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Stone, 24, said her employer plans to provide two cars and keep one parked 
in Oakland, the other in San Francisco. Employees can then take BART under the 
bay and use either car for business trips. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be horrible on Monday," she said. "We're really bracing for the 
worst." 
</P>
<P>
There were some reports of tempers flaring in towns in the Santa Cruz Mountains 
near the quake epicenter, as building inspectors fanned out to tag those homes 
too damaged to be saved. Some residents were refusing to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
"They are used to being self-sufficient mountain people," said Barbara 
Macallair, a director of the Zayante Fire Protection District, which serves 
about 5,000 mountain residents. 
</P>
<P>
Explorer scouts and firefighters who checked street-by-street found 92 homes 
demolished -- either split in half, slid down hills or burned to the ground -- 
in the Zayante district alone. In all, 323 homes were uninhabitable and at 
least 1,000 had minor to moderate damage, such as broken windows or toppled 
chimneys. 
</P>
<P>
Houses are posted with "condemned" signs all over the mountains, home before 
the quake to a peculiar coastal Northern California mix of computer-literate 
professionals and a more rustic breed of latter-day hippies, organic farmers 
and doers of odd jobs whose economic status is more dicey. 
</P>
<P>
In Redwood Estates, a town of about 400 homes five miles from the epicenter, 
the owner of one home that cracked in half and slid off its foundation posted a 
sign -- "For Sale. $200k. Fixer-upper." 
</P>
<P>
Notices are posted along the mountain roads advertising clearing and hauling 
services -- prices to be negotiated. Propane and carpenters were also in short 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
Further south in Watsonville, families sleeping in parks refused to return home 
and moved into tent encampments set up by the National Guard and relief 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is a disaster," Pamela Cote, of the Santa Cruz County human 
resources agency, said as she tried to coax 50 survivors living in Callaghan 
Park to move to 22 Army tents erected several blocks away by the National 
Guard. 
</P>
<P>
"People are everywhere on the streets in this town," Cote said. "A lot of this 
is cultural, they don't want to leave their houses, they are afraid people are 
going to go in houses and take things." 
</P>
<P>
Even building inspectors' word that 363 homes have been checked and are safe to 
enter hasn't appeared to sway many whose confidence in even the ground beneath 
their feet was shaken by the 15-second jolt. 
</P>
<P>
"There's this distrust of government because a lot of people are here illegally 
and they don't want to be turned in," Cote said. "We are giving services 
regardless. The INS is not going to show up." 
</P>
<P>
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, President Bush's quake relief 
coordinator, said there will be an indefinite delay before the Bush 
Administration comes up with an estimate for how much it is willing to spend 
for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to do a lot of workup from the field," Skinner said in an interview on 
CBS' "Face the Nation" Sunday. "I don't think anybody can say what's really 
needed today. We're still learning about the damage." 
</P>
<P>
Skinner indicated he does not believe the construction of double-decker 
freeways should end as a result of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
"The technology for the construction of freeways has changed since the 1950s," 
he said. "We've learned a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D-Carmel Valley), 
interviewed outside a tent village in Watsonville, called for new federal taxes 
to help pay for earthquake relief.

normal again. There were even those who enjoyed Sunday afternoon walks in the 
park. But in much of the Bay Area, the earthquake of five days before still 
intruded on most aspects of life. For residents of the Marina district, who

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shouldering his spade, Khassaye Negusse clambered out of the ditch he was 
helping dig for a water pipeline. There were 200 people busy around him, 
pouring concrete and excavating around a remote watercourse five miles from the 
nearest road. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of the others, explained Negusse, 65, he is a farmer, raising corn 
and wheat. It is an enterprise that has meant starvation in four of the last 
six years, when the rains in this rocky part of Eritrea have failed. 
</P>
<P>
So today, he and the others earn their bread not by tilling but by building 
this project designed to take advantage of a stream by directing it into a 
filtration system for drinking water and preserving it for irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
An unskilled laborer like Negusse on a project like this receives 18 pounds of 
flour for an eight-hour day. If he works a full month -- he has worked six so 
far -- he earns the equivalent of a month's minimum nutritional requirement for 
the eight family members living at his home a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
"We manage to survive on that," he says. Once the water project is completed, 
the family will be able to use its water, too. 
</P>
<P>
It is rare enough in Ethiopia that donated food is used to develop the country 
instead of just being a stopgap to keep people from imminent starvation. And 
nothing would please Western aid donors more than to see more projects like the 
one Negusse is working on. 
</P>
<P>
Work sites like this one, which will cost about $75,000 and 3,000 tons of food 
contributed by an Italian charity, seem to bear the best hope for Ethiopia 
extracting itself from the rut of drought and famine that over the last decade 
has become almost a permanent condition. 
</P>
<P>
Already these "food for work" programs have contributed to a visible 
improvement of the Ethiopian landscape. Thousands of acres of Eritrean 
hillsides are terraced with stone walls ranged concentrically down from their 
summits in an attempt to keep the infrequent but destructive rains from washing 
away scarce topsoil. 
</P>
<P>
Some are sprouting eucalyptus trees, the result of another program to restore 
forests stripped away by peasants' search for fuel. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen small-scale dams and water filtration schemes, providing local farmers 
with water for drinking and irrigation, can be identified from the stands of 
thriving green cornstalks that leap out of the brown landscape at infrequent 
intervals. 
</P>
<P>
The West's enthusiasm for these food-for-work programs stems partially from the 
phenomenon of donor fatigue: the weariness that comes from having to ship 
emergency supplies to this country year after year. 
</P>
<P>
The coming year will mark another in which the world must mobilize to save more 
than a million Ethiopians from starvation. This time the crisis will strike 
Eritrea and Tigre, in the far north of the country, where summer and fall rains 
have failed, ruining crops needed to feed people in the first part of 1990. The 
U.N.'s food relief agency, the World Food Program, estimates that at least 
264,000 tons of food will be needed to feed people in parts of the regions 
still controlled by the government. 
</P>
<P>
More is probably needed in areas of Eritrea and Tigre held by rebels. 
</P>
<P>
"No one wants to hear that Ethiopia's in the soup again," says Willard J. 
Pearson, local director of the office of the U.S. Agency for International 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, says David Morton, head of the World Food Program's office in 
Ethiopia, "donors are talking more about what you could do with 1 million tons 
of food aid costing $300 (million) to $350 million a year." 
</P>
<P>
They are talking about devoting their food aid to helping Ethiopia irrigate its 
land, build roads from farm to market and plant trees to check erosion. 
</P>
<P>
Such projects could work in this country for two reasons. The first is that, as 
a World Food Program official puts it: "This is one of the few countries in the 
world so poor that people will work for nothing but food. In a lot of other 
Third World countries, you would need cash." 
</P>
<P>
The second is that Ethiopia is in dire need of infrastructure. Over the last 
decade, virtually no money has gone into developing the country, as opposed to 
just feeding its people. The cause is a combination of the country's extreme 
need and the distaste with which many Western countries view the 12-year-old 
Marxist regime of President Mengistu Haile Mariam. 
</P>
<P>
The United States spent $109 million in Ethiopia last year, more than in any 
other African country. But every cent was in emergency humanitarian assistance; 
not a penny went into development. 
</P>
<P>
That pattern is followed by most donors. In all, since 1985, about 94% of 
Ethiopia's foreign aid has been emergency assistance. 
</P>
<P>
That severe underdevelopment, like the annual reports emerging from Ethiopia of 
new droughts and famine menacing millions of people, contributes to the outside 
world's misimpression that this is a country uniquely tormented by natural 
disaster and ill luck. But drought is not the principal cause of famine in this 
country -- government policy is. 
</P>
<P>
Agronomists say there is no technical reason why Ethiopia's land could not only 
feed its own people but even produce grain for export. Its central highlands 
have potentially some of the most productive farmland in East Africa. 
</P>
<P>
But most of this land goes unused. A recent survey by the U.S. Agency for 
International Development found that only about 40% of arable land here is 
cultivated and that only about 4.5% of its irrigable land is watered. The 
erosion of topsoil from land denuded of forest alone accounts for a 1% annual 
drop in agricultural productivity. 
</P>
<P>
This meager use of potentially rich resources is what makes Ethiopia a place 
where natural misfortune turns regularly into catastrophe. The dearth of 
irrigation means that only a few inches of rain a year spell the difference 
between an adequate crop and a disastrous one, says Ingo Loerbroks, head of the 
Addis Ababa office of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Crop production in this country is characterized by quite extraordinary 
fluctuations from one year to another," he says. 
</P>
<P>
More than a decade of inept agricultural planning, much of it based on 
Marxist-Leninist principles already abandoned by the rest of the Communist 
world, has produced a decline of more than 20% in the country's per capita food 
production in that time. 
</P>
<P>
It has taken more than five years for Ethiopia's crop to recover just to the 
level of the pre-drought years of 1980-84, following the famine of 1984-85. By 
now, the population has increased by 6 million persons and the annual food 
needs are 1 million tons higher. 
</P>
<P>
Ominously, the gap between mouths to feed and food to eat is getting worse. One 
American study has concluded that the annual food deficit here will rise to 2 
million annually during the 1990s, after averaging about 1 million tons a year 
during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
To be fair, it is not an oversight that Western donors have been wary of 
spending more money on development: The Mengistu regime has helped wreck the 
few projects that exist. 
</P>
<P>
A prime example is a major agricultural development scheme in the central 
district of Arsi, in Ethiopia's breadbasket. In June, the project's sponsor, 
the Swedish government, withdrew from the project after spending $50 million on 
it over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We realized our resources, by and large, were supporting government policies," 
said Bo Stenson, director of the Ethiopia office of the Swedish Industrial 
Development Authority, which managed Arsi. Those policies, he continued, were 
clearly interfering with Arsi's agricultural productivity, which had doubled 
between 1968 and 1980 before apparently stagnating for good. 
</P>
<P>
The linchpins of the government's agricultural plan are "villagization" and 
"collectivization." More than half of the country's farmers are now villagized, 
meaning they have been moved from their scattered homes into small communities, 
where they are given some common tools and permitted to till modest private 
plots. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, villagization is useful, say agronomists, because it makes 
available tools and equipment that farmers could not otherwise afford. But few 
of the experts have such good words for collectivization, a Soviet-style 
program that strips the farmers of all private holdings and binds them to work 
for their collective. 
</P>
<P>
It's a system that has been acknowledged as a failure in the two places where 
it was created, China and the Soviet Union, and today exists in its unalloyed 
form only here, perhaps the least suitable place in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Collectivization requires good management because there is no individual 
incentive, and that's precisely what this country doesn't have," Stenson said. 
</P>
<P>
One region that did have management-oriented farmers, however, was Arsi, 
because the Swedes had trained them. The government took advantage of that to 
institute an unprecedentedly rapid collectivization of the project. More than 
16% of Arsi's farmers were collectivized, about four times the ratio in the 
rest of the country, in the space of two years. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Swedes saw that government agricultural extension agents, who at 
the outset were helping to train the farmers in the use of modern equipment and 
cropping techniques, "from the beginning of the 1980s were concerned less and 
less with technical assistance and more with political propaganda," Stenson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last 18 months, some government agricultural policies have been 
liberalized. The prices paid farmers by the government marketing board, to 
which they must sell a certain share of their crop, have been raised, 
encouraging farmers to grow more. Rules that prohibited the shipment of grain 
across provincial borders, which contributed to famines by hampering the 
distribution of food from places where it was abundant to those where it was 
scarce, have been lifted. 
</P>
<P>
Although some Western agronomists say the changes are too gradual to mean much, 
some donors, including the European Community and the World Bank, view them 
positively enough to increase development aid. But many still think a more 
efficient use of their money is to support the small-scale projects that 
exchange food for work promoting development. 
</P>
<P>
There are still many complications hindering a genuine expansion of the 
food-for-work concept. One is the problem facing any similar proposal in the 
United States to make welfare recipients work: How does one avoid depriving the 
disabled or sick of food? 
</P>
<P>
Another is the need to avoid make-work. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless the thing is useful, you might as well just give the food to them," 
said the World Food Program's Morton. He alludes to a eucalyptus project that 
planted the wrong trees on the wrong land: "If you get a couple of thousand 
people planting trees (which) all die, it will be hard to get them to plant 
trees again." 
</P>
<P>
Many Western donors also resist such unconventional proposals as to sell the 
food they contribute in Ethiopian markets, then use the cash to pay workers in 
places here where a cash economy still exists. 
</P>
<P>
But many Ethiopians do not share these misgivings. 
</P>
<P>
"We should put people to work to improve the land," said Ghirmai Woldu, chief 
project engineer for the Ethiopian Catholic Secretariat, which is financing the 
Embatekalla water project. "What should we be, always a nation of beggars?" 
</P>

PLAN FOR FIRING OF INEPT UC PROFESSORS STIRS DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The University of California is considering a controversial proposal to deal 
with what critics say are skeletons in academia's back closets: incompetent 
tenured professors. 
</P>
<P>
Some UC faculty want to publicly set guidelines for the discipline and firing 
of "grossly incompetent" professors. Others, saying such cases are better 
handled informally, fear that any definition of incompetency could be used to 
harass dissident scholars and attack the concept of lifetime employment 
promised by tenure. 
</P>
<P>
"To many faculty, when you say something about possibly terminating a tenured 
person, all hell breaks loose," explained Richard Gable, the UC Davis political 
science professor who headed the entire UC system's faculty council last year. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal about firing the grossly incompetent passed the Faculty Senate at UC 
Berkeley last spring but is opposed by UCLA's professoriate. So, a 
university-wide panel has been formed to study the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the American Assn. of University Professors, wary of possible 
threats to academic freedom, also has expressed concern. The association says 
that a UC plan could start a trend throughout the country. Few other schools 
now specify incompetency as grounds for dismissal. Among those that do is 
Stanford University. No Stanford professor has been formally fired for 
incompetence in at least 20 years, officials said, although some may have been 
pressured into retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the UC Berkeley proposal say it probably would affect a tiny 
number -- Gabel estimated a dozen -- of the 6,700 tenured professors on the 
nine UC campuses. But they say it will be more important to define professorial 
incompetence as UC prepares at the end of 1993 to drop its mandatory retirement 
at age 70. 
</P>
<P>
"Removing the time of retirement might well increase the number of people 
unaware that they have ceased to function," said history professor John 
Heilbron, chairman of the Faculty Senate at UC Berkeley. All tenured 
professors, along with police officers and firefighters, were given a 
seven-year exemption when Congress abolished mandatory retirements in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
According to Heilbron, "gross incompetence" describes only professors "one cut 
above moribund" and "means that the party is a disaster in the classroom, has 
stopped research and just no longer functions as a professor." 
</P>
<P>
Firing for such a person "seems to me difficult to argue against," he added. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jordan Kurland, associate general secretary of the American Assn. of 
University Professors, objects to a hard-and-fast definition "No one is arguing 
that we should just wink at these (incompetent) people and carry them," he 
said. "But what is needed is not a specific procedure. What is needed is enough 
initiative, enough gumption to step in and deal with an unpleasant situation. 
</P>
<P>
"When you start writing criteria and procedures to deal with the most grossly 
unfit, it just opens the door to have another category not quite as bad and 
another category not quite as bad as that," Kurland added. 
</P>
<P>
Under UC rules, a professor can be disciplined or fired for plagiarism, taking 
undue advantage of a student, or a criminal conviction, among other things. 
Officials say that the university can take similar action against an 
incompetent under a general policy of "good cause" but that most such cases are 
handled informally. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Switkes, UC's director of academic personnel, estimated that three or 
four tenured professors a year leave the system because of their poor 
performance. Most are pressured into early retirement. "There are arrangements 
made for people to leave," Switkes said. She and other UC officials declined to 
give details about those cases, citing privacy rules. 
</P>
<P>
Policy Critics 
</P>
<P>
Critics of university tenure policies contend that professors are brutally 
scrutinized for their research and teaching abilities during the selection for 
tenure but that there is little follow-up once approval is granted. However, in 
1986 UC began formal performance reviews for professors every five years, 
linking it to promotions and salaries. That uncovered some cases of 
incompetency and raised questions about what to do with them, faculty leaders 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Some professors think the current policy is too vague and that the university 
needs to confront recent criticism on tenure. For example, state Supt. of 
Public Instruction Bill Honig in August complained that UC professors spend too 
little time in the classroom. And, some students and faculty were outraged that 
former UC Santa Barbara Chancellor Robert A. Huttenback remained on the payroll 
for a year after his conviction for embezzlement of university funds; the UC 
Board of Regents suspended his salary in July and said Huttenback would be the 
first professor in the history of UC to be formally stripped of his tenure if 
he loses court appeals. 
</P>
<P>
The "gross incompetency" proposal at UC Berkeley says that a professor must be 
a flop in both research and teaching to lose tenure. That is an important point 
because some older professors slack off on new research but remain wonderful 
lecturers. For possible dismissal under the plan, a professor must show no 
likelihood of renewed scholarship and be so poor a teacher "that it is a 
disservice to students." 
</P>
<P>
If counseling fails to bring improvement, action against such a professor would 
go through a complicated ladder of review by peers, the campus chancellor and 
possibly the UC system's president and regents. 
</P>
<P>
However, biological chemistry professor Sidney Roberts, chairman of the UCLA 
Faculty Senate, said any such plan would be very difficult to administer 
fairly. "Take someone in literature," Roberts suggested. "He might be working 
on a book for 10 years and would appear to accomplish nothing in the interim. 
He might not have been doing as good a job teaching as he might. But 10 years 
later, he may win the Nobel Prize." 
</P>
<P>
A seven-member panel of professors from around the UC system is to meet soon on 
the matter. "It's unlikely that any resolution will be easily forthcoming and 
certainly not without considerable study and discussion," said committee 
chairman Charles Nash, a UC Davis chemistry professor.

CARIBBEAN STATES WANT U.N. IN DRUG WAR; 
</P>
<P>
SMUGGLING: JAMAICA AND THE BAHAMAS SEEK TO DRAW ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE U.S. 
PRESENCE IN DRUG-TROUBLED COUNTRIES.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than a decade as the main strategic battlefront in the U.S. war on 
drugs, the mini-states of the Caribbean, led by Jamaica and the Bahamas, have 
opened a campaign to draw the United Nations into an active anti-drug combat 
role. 
</P>
<P>
The aim is to ease sensitivities over too great an American presence in 
drug-troubled countries such as Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ministers Michael Manley of Jamaica and Lynden O. Pindling of the Bahamas 
have called for a rapid U.N. deployment force that would interdict drug 
shipments, eradicate drug crops, ferret out anti-narcotics intelligence and 
even mount paramilitary-style raids against drug traffickers -- the way U.S. 
Drug Enforcement Administration, Coast Guard and military units try to do in 
cooperating countries. 
</P>
<P>
The force would be similar to U.N. peacekeeping forces that have been deployed 
in many of the world's hot spots, according to the two prime ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with the unanimous support of the Caribbean Community and Common Market, 
made up of the English-speaking countries of the region, the two last week 
sought broader support at the annual meeting of the British Commonwealth 
nations in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
Pindling said in a recent interview that he will also lobby for support at a 
summit of 15 regional heads of state, including President Bush, scheduled to be 
held in Costa Rica on Friday and Saturday. And he said he will press for 
adoption of the scheme at a special U.N. General Assembly meeting on drugs due 
to convene sometime before next February. 
</P>
<P>
According to Pindling, the multinational force could be formed and in action 
within six months if major powers such as the United States get behind the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are serious, we could pass the resolution at the U.N. this year," 
Pindling said. ". . . If they're serious about a narcotics eradication program, 
they could put it together in three months and have it operational in six. It 
all depends on how serious those countries which have the capability are." 
</P>
<P>
Because both countries now cooperate closely with American anti-narcotics 
forces, U.S. officials are reluctant to muddy relations by publicly criticizing 
the Manley-Pindling scheme. But some U.S. veterans of the Caribbean front of 
the drug war expressed deep reservations and cautioned that even if an armed 
U.N. force is formed, it would be incredibly expensive. 
</P>
<P>
"We would probably have to bankroll it, and we wouldn't get as much bang for 
the buck as we get now in bilateral programs such as our joint operations in 
the Bahamas," one official said. "The Bahamas operation alone costs $30 million 
to $40 million annually. I'm not sure there's enough jam to cover all that 
bread." 
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. specialist dismissed the Bahamian prime minister's support of the 
U.N. proposal as little more than an attempt to scrub up an unsavory image 
imprinted on the Bahamas government by U.S. indictments of several close 
Pindling associates on drug-related charges. "He wants to be seen as part of 
the solution to the drug crisis rather than as part of the problem," the 
specialist said. 
</P>
<P>
But another American drug expert said the idea is a good one, regardless of 
Pindling's motives, because it would make outside assistance more acceptable to 
politically sensitive Latin nations. 
</P>
<P>
"A U.N. helicopter squadron would help immeasurably in some places," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pindling acknowledged that the idea of forming an armed U.N. force to conduct 
aggressive military operations against the drug barons might be hard to sell to 
the international organization, which has deployed troops only for peacekeeping 
purposes since the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
"But if it's not possible to have that kind of (armed) force, at least it may 
be able to take part in the eradication of drug-producing centers and crops," 
he said. "It might be easier to deal with that rather than with 
street-to-street, house-to-house law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
Pindling said he envisages a narcotics enforcement support office at the United 
Nations with high-tech intelligence capabilities, such as satellite 
surveillance aimed at pinpointing drug crops and cocaine factories, as well as 
international financial specialists with the power to track down drug 
traffickers and their financial networks. 
</P>
<P>
The task is urgent, Pindling declared. 
</P>
<P>
"It's made even more urgent by what is happening now in Colombia," he said. 
"How long will it take before Colombia self-destructs? Before the whole economy 
is shattered? And if it progresses to Bolivia and Peru, it may lead them to 
similar self-destruction. We just can't devastate three countries like that. 
They need help. We need help. It's urgent."

China's hard-line leaders have built secret rail tunnels under Beijing that 
could be used in crushing resurgent protests or to enable officials to flee in 
a crisis, according to a program to be broadcast today. 
</P>
<P>
A former Chinese civil servant, who fled to Hong Kong after troops crushed 
pro-democracy demonstrations in June, told the British "World in Action" 
television program that the tunnels link leaders' homes, government buildings, 
the central bank and an army base. 
</P>
<P>
"We built up this network over 40 years as a defense against a foreign invader 
. . . but now they could use such means to escape from China or to deal the 
last blow against the people," he said, according to a transcript of the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors of a secret rail line and an interlinking honeycomb of passages have 
circulated in Beijing for many years, but there has never been any 
confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
The informant said there is a station under the Great Hall of the People and 
another station at the government residence compound, Zhongnanhai. 
</P>
<P>
Still another line goes to the Bank of China, allowing security forces to 
evacuate gold reserves in a crisis, he said. There is also a line to the Xi 
Shan military base, carved into the side of a mountain to the west of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The program did not reveal the name of the former civil servant, saying only 
that he was a junior official in his 20s with access to high-level information 
and close contact with leaders.

Leaders of the 46-nation Commonwealth on Sunday gave South Africa six months to 
deliver on reform promises or face new reprisals, and they called for tighter 
financial pressure immediately. Britain alone dissented. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, rejecting key provisions of the Commonwealth 
summit declaration on South Africa, charged that U.S. and Commonwealth 
embargoes have strengthened white extremism in South Africa. But she went along 
with a stipulation that current trade embargoes remain. 
</P>
<P>
In its declaration, the organization of Britain and its former colonies held 
off on seeking new embargoes for at least six months. 
</P>
<P>
Britain objected to provisions setting up a new body to scrutinize South 
Africa's financial links and declaring that a foreign ministers' committee, 
which monitors sanctions and suggests new ones, will meet in six months. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-page declaration gave muted acknowledgment of reform moves by South 
Africa's new president, Frederik W. de Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
It said there is a "possibility that significant changes in approach on the 
part of the South African regime . . . may yet prove to be within reach." 
</P>
<P>
The declaration was issued Sunday after final approval by the Commonwealth 
leaders at a weekend retreat at Langkawi Island, 210 miles northwest of here. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate statement Sunday, Thatcher said: "There seems to be a clear 
correlation between the imposition of additional sanctions by the U.S. Congress 
and the Commonwealth and the strength of extreme right-wing parties in South 
Africa utterly opposed to change." 
</P>
<P>
In parts of the summit declaration, the tone was milder than that of previous 
Commonwealth pronouncements on South Africa, and it stressed the need for 
peaceful change. 
</P>
<P>
The declaration incorporated an Australian proposal that the Commonwealth call 
on international banks to restrict South African trade credits to a maximum of 
90 days and urge governments to make it more difficult for South Africa to get 
credits. 
</P>
<P>
It also said that a U.N. arms embargo should be intensified. 
</P>
<P>
Current Commonwealth embargoes consist of 11 voluntary sanctions, including a 
ban on air links, drawn up in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Britain refuses to impose most of the Commonwealth embargoes. Black African 
states, which depend economically on South Africa, do not impose them. 
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth sanctions fall well short of those imposed by the United 
States.

REAGANS ARE SERENADED AT BENEFIT CONCERT IN JAPAN

<P>
With a chorus of "America the Beautiful," the Japanese paid a warm tribute to 
former President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, at a gala benefit concert 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The concert, organized to benefit the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, began 
and ended with the patriotic song and featured Perry Como, Placido Domingo, the 
Harlem Boys Choir and Japanese stars Yuzo Kayama and Toshihiko Tahara. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll never know, Ron, how much we need you. Please come here with Nancy to 
stay," went the final tribute, set to the tune of "You Are My Sunshine." 
</P>
<P>
The concert was organized by the Fujisankei Communications Group, which is 
sponsoring the Reagans' visit. Reagan and Fujisankei have refused to confirm 
reports he is being paid $2 million for his appearances. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans waved to the audience and performers and sang along with them in a 
final chorus of "America the Beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Scenes of events during Reagan's presidency were shown on huge video screens 
near the stage. The scenes were subtitled with phrases praising Reagan for 
"restoring public confidence in America" and helping to "maintain peace 
throughout the world." 
</P>
<P>
The audience of more than 10,000 paid $35 to $70 to attend the event at 
Yokohama Arena, 18 miles south of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"I thank you for your interest in the presidential library. . . . I want to 
thank all of you," Reagan said in brief comments after the concert. "I'm at a 
loss for words." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Reagans toured a mountainside art museum in Hakone, 63 miles 
southwest of Tokyo, owned by Fujisankei. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan stopped along the way to shake hands with Japanese museum-goers but did 
not respond to reporters' questions about his reported fee. 
</P>
<P>
Fujisankei, Japan's largest media group, owns the newspaper Sankei Shimbun, the 
Fuji Telecasting Corp. and Nippon Hoso, Japan's biggest commercial radio 
network, among dozens of other companies. 
</P>
<P>
Like its chairman, Nobutaka Shikanai, many of the company's media outlets 
espouse conservatism and nationalism. At the time of Emperor Hirohito's death 
and the controversy it spawned over his role in World War II, the Fuji TV 
network generally carried few critical views of Japan's imperial system. 
</P>
<P>
The network's low-brow programming contrasts sharply with the company's 
impressive art collections, including its outdoor sculpture garden in Hakone. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Reagan begins the two-day official portion of his visit, during which he 
will meet with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, Emperor Akihito and other Japanese 
leaders.

<P>
AN IRONIC LEGACY OF 1906 EARTHQUAKE; 
</P>
<P>
TRAGEDY: MARINA DISTRICT, A LANDFILL AREA WHERE MUCH OF THE MAJOR DAMAGE 
OCCURRED, WAS CREATED AS A TESTAMENT TO SAN FRANCISCO'S DETERMINATION TO 
SURVIVE EARLIER TEMBLOR.

<P>
A sea captain called it the "mad moment" on that morning of April 18, 1906, 
when something mysteriously jolted his steamer in calm waters off San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds later, the madness came ashore at 7,000 m.p.h., an earthquake so strong 
it was as though the sea god Poseidon strode in to obliterate the landlubbers. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-three years later the madness would be back. And in San Francisco, it 
would take its greatest toll in a part of town that had been literally created 
as a monument to earthquake survival. 
</P>
<P>
On land, the 1906 temblor started beneath the Point Arena Lighthouse, 90 miles 
north of the city, and ripped in seconds down the gentle hills and dales. 
</P>
<P>
It hit San Francisco at 5:12 a.m and lasted for 48 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
As Gordon Thomas and Max Witts write in "The San Francisco Earthquake," even at 
that hour some in the raucous young metropolis were astir. 
</P>
<P>
The great Caruso, on his first trip to the American West, had just gone to bed 
after carousing into the wee hours to celebrate his triumphant performance in 
"Carmen" at the Grand Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
The dashing John Barrymore had lured a young woman back to his suite at the St. 
Francis to open some champagne. 
</P>
<P>
And down on the rollicking Barbary Coast they were still belting down whiskey 
and rolling the dice. 
</P>
<P>
All of a sudden, a monstrous shudder. 
</P>
<P>
What in God's name was that? 
</P>
<P>
The clock on the Ferry Building stopped dead at 5:15 (everybody knew it was 
fast), and became the instant symbol of the Great San Francisco Earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"Buildings danced on their foundations," said one witness. 
</P>
<P>
A police sergeant said he looked at the hilly streets and "it was as if the 
waves of the ocean were coming towards me." 
</P>
<P>
Church bells rang all over. 
</P>
<P>
Tumbling buildings sent up a charge of dust as thick as coal smoke. 
</P>
<P>
And everywhere in San Francisco, a strange sound. 
</P>
<P>
"Like a thousand violins, all at a discord," was the way British Consul General 
Walter Bennett described it. 
</P>
<P>
There was bedlam in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
A.P. Giannini, a young banker who was to found the Bank of America, hitched up 
a team of horses and hauled his money to a brother's house for safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
It would not be long before orders went out to shoot looters on sight. 
</P>
<P>
Caruso was found weeping in his hotel suite, his silk shirts and 40 pairs of 
fine Italian boots all ajumble amid the bureau drawers on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Caruso's agent, write Thomas and Witts, was quoted as saying that for the great 
singer, it was "as if the cataclysmic terror had singled him out to obliterate 
his glory of the previous night, as if Providence had evil designs on him 
personally." 
</P>
<P>
Outside in the streets, though, it was as if Beelzebub had designs on San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Everywhere, the little fires that were to grow into the Great Fire were raging. 
</P>
<P>
In 1906 there were no sprinklers in the city's many wooden structures; flames 
scattered like dandelion down from the kerosene lamps that were shattered in 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 17 minutes after the shaking stopped, 50 fires were sighted in 
downtown San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
But there were no fire bells because the central alarm system in Chinatown had 
been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
And the talents of Fire Chief Dennis Sullivan would never be used; his Bush 
Street residence collapsed and he was in a coma from which he would never 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
What happened next was sickening -- a swath of conflagration. 
</P>
<P>
From Russian Hill down past Market Street to the bay, just about everything was 
charred right down to the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
"All night the city burned with a copper glow," wrote James Hopper in the 
periodical Everybody's. 
</P>
<P>
In the Overland Monthly, Pierre N. Beringer penned this breathtaking passage: 
</P>
<P>
"Then came the season of the awful silence, the hush of awe, when mankind held 
its breath and things stood still and humanity gazed on havoc and hideous roar 
and then, out of the silence, out of toppled buildings, ruined palaces, and 
dismal hovels, came the besom of flame. 
</P>
<P>
"With hideous roar it advanced, this terrible thing, this red and yellow 
monster, and its fiery arms outstretched, it reached the seven hills and it 
hissed and roared and with infernal intensity, it consumed, ate, and devoured." 
</P>
<P>
The startling photographs of this devastation assembled by Eric Saul and Don 
Denevi for their book "The Great San Francisco Earthquake and Fire, 1906" show 
parts of the city looking like Hiroshima would look 39 years later when the 
atomic bomb was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates at the time of the quake and fire put the dead at 700. But more 
recently, city archivists have greatly upgraded that to 2,000. Checking 
records, they combined those known to have perished with those who vanished on 
that day. 
</P>
<P>
As William Bronson notes in "The Earth Shook, the Sky Burned," few Americans 
today can fathom the breadth of the destruction. 
</P>
<P>
City Hall and most of its documents -- gone. 
</P>
<P>
Whole libraries and art treasures -- gone. 
</P>
<P>
The domiciles of more than 250,000 people -- destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 schools and 80 churches and convents -- leveled or razed by fire. 
</P>
<P>
"It was agreed by the Real Estate Board," reported the San Francisco Chronicle, 
"that the calamity should be spoken of as 'the great fire,' not as 'the great 
earthquake.' " 
</P>
<P>
After all, they could hope to handle fires in the future. Earthquakes were out 
of their control and any reminder of them could severely limit San Francisco's 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
(San Francisco columnist Herb Caen recalls that as a beginning reporter half a 
century ago, he once referred to "the Great San Francisco Earthquake" and was 
called in by his editors. Wagging their fingers, they admonished him that it 
was the "Great San Francisco Fire.") 
</P>
<P>
But in the aftermath of this year's massive quake, if anyone points a finger, 
it won't be at fire. 
</P>
<P>
It will be, rather, to what followed in the first few years after the 1906 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"San Francisco Doomed," screamed one headline. 
</P>
<P>
The number of homeless was so high that when many people were asked where they 
were from, they responded, "I don't live anywhere. I used to live in San 
Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the collection of fortune hunters, immigrants, sea traders and corporate 
captains who made up "Baghdad by the Bay" soon began to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
And a massive job it was. 
</P>
<P>
About 28,000 structures were destroyed in the earthquake and fire, according to 
Father John B. McGloin's "San Francisco, the Story of a City." 
</P>
<P>
Only four years later, though, in 1910, a survey found 25,000 new buildings -- 
the nucleus of a reborn city. 
</P>
<P>
And when the Panama Canal opened in 1914, providing much faster passage between 
the Atlantic and the Pacific, San Francisco decided it was time to throw a 
party. 
</P>
<P>
Or, more precisely, to stage the Panama-Pacific International Exposition of 
1915. 
</P>
<P>
An exhibition hall and other facilities were needed, and they would best be 
placed on flat land -- a rare commodity in the city of soaring hills. 
</P>
<P>
Civil engineer Harris de Haven Connick decided to literally create land. 
</P>
<P>
He chose an area called Harbor Cove, near Ft. Point and not far from the 
Presidio. 
</P>
<P>
It was under 15 feet of water, a brackish backwash of not much use to anybody. 
But Connick changed that. 
</P>
<P>
Using technology developed by the Dutch, among others, he built a sea wall 
around 70 acres of Harbor Cove and filled it with mud from the bay and other 
dirt. 
</P>
<P>
And on this raw new land all the major countries put up temporary exhibits for 
the Panama-Pacific Exposition. 
</P>
<P>
It was one way to get their minds off World War I, which had broken out the 
year before. 
</P>
<P>
On opening day, Feb. 20, 1915, McGloin writes, the exposition drew 245,143 
people; in 10 months it was visited by more than 18 million. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no doubt," he writes, "that San Francisco had demonstrated to its 
own satisfaction, as well as that of the world, that it had definitely 
recovered from the wounds inflicted upon it less than 10 years before." 
</P>
<P>
Like the 1906 earthquake, memories of Harbor Cove faded over the years. 
</P>
<P>
The new piece of land was given a new name: the Marina District, where fine 
homes and apartments went up after the exhibit structures were removed. 
</P>
<P>
With its sea air, great views of the bay and the huge greensward of park, the 
Marina has become one of the most desirable addresses on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
But it was on this former landfill -- built after the 1906 quake as a testament 
to one city's gutsy determination to endure and prevail -- that last week's 
quake did its worst damage in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
At least three people were killed in the Marina; many buildings were knocked 
off their foundations and city inspectors believe that as many as 100 will have 
to be demolished. Gas service may not be restored for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco this was the closest that the latest quake came to the madness 
of 1906. 
</P>
<P>
And any thoughts of rebuilding in the Marina will be accompanied by the initial 
conclusion from last week's quake that a landfill may not be such a great place 
to be when the Earth's plates shift. 
</P>
<P>
It has suddenly become modern San Francisco's reminder of the Great Earthquake 
of 1906.

<TEXT>
<P>
Although they are a continent apart, the cities of Charleston, S.C., and San 
Francisco now share a fateful page in the ledger of time. They are the scenes 
of two of the century's costliest, back-to-back natural disasters: Hurricane 
Hugo and the Bay Area earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
There are dramatic similarities and profound differences in the ways these two 
cities were affected and altered in the first week after they were ravaged by 
two powerful forces of nature -- one that angrily swept across the land from 
the sea and one that violently rumbled beneath the earth. 
</P>
<P>
"From the standpoint of compassion, of all the people in America we can feel 
the hurt that the San Francisco area is going through the most," Charleston 
Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said Sunday, one month after Hugo hit. "We know it 
means, at best, the disruption of normal life for some time and, at worst, the 
loss of life." 
</P>
<P>
Charleston had warning. San Francisco did not. Unlike earthquakes, hurricanes 
can be tracked by planes and radar, their paths predicted with sufficient 
certainty for those in harm's way to secure property and to flee. Still, at 
least 28 deaths in the Carolinas are blamed on Hugo, while at least 60 deaths 
have been attributed to the Bay Area earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo, 500 miles across with winds topping 175 m.p.h., left virtually every 
street and every neighborhood littered with storm debris and 80% of the city's 
buildings with some degree of damage. Five days after the storm, many city 
residents remained inconvenienced, most without electricity, many without safe 
drinking water. Street lights didn't work. Broken glass and other debris left 
the roadsides lined with cars stopped by flat tires. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast the streets in most of San Francisco were passable within a day of 
the earthquake. Electricity was largely restored overnight. And most broken 
natural gas lines were quickly repaired. Restaurants in Chinatown, North Beach 
and along Fillmore Street were crowded Saturday night. Cable cars began 
carrying passengers Sunday and the curtain went up on the opera. 
</P>
<P>
"Their streets were immediately passable," said Charleston Police Chief Ruben 
Greenberg. "We were gridlocked for two days because of the debris." 
</P>
<P>
And a week after the hurricane, Charleston -- which like San Francisco has a 
tourism-based economy -- was still trying to cope with mountains of broken 
trees and shattered roofs. It was more than 10 days before restaurants and 
other stores began to slowly reopen and twice as long for night life to begin 
to return. 
</P>
<P>
Tour Buses Return 
</P>
<P>
By Sunday, tourists and tour buses could be seen outside hotels near 
Fisherman's Wharf and at other locations favored by visitors. Tourism is a 
$2.5-billion-a-year business in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
It took almost three weeks for businesses that cater to tourists to get back on 
their feet in Charleston. It's likely to take a lot longer for the tourists 
themselves to return in numbers that made it one of the city's biggest 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
Citywide, Charleston had 68 buildings collapse, compared to 60 buildings 
destroyed just in San Francisco's Marina District. 
</P>
<P>
In Charleston most of the damage could be quickly assessed. It was visible. In 
San Francisco much of the damage may still be undetected. Water mains and gas 
lines weakened by the heaving earth may not break for weeks or months. 
Structural damage to houses, in many instances, will become apparent over a 
long period of time. 
</P>
<P>
"When a hurricane is over, it's over," Greenberg said. "Not so with an 
earthquake. You have aftershocks." 
</P>
<P>
Charleston also escaped widespread damage to its infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost no major economic area like the Bay Bridge," said Greenberg, who was 
once San Francisco's undersheriff and who returned with emergency supplies to 
help the Santa Cruz police. "That's an economic lifeline. All we lost was one 
minor bridge. They're going to have humongous traffic problems." 
</P>
<P>
Hugo left Charleston isolated from the world. Communications broke down soon 
after the storm crossed the coastline about midnight and it was daybreak before 
the nation began to learn of the widespread damage. Even local residents were 
left without any information. The hurricane knocked out all local television 
and radio stations, and local officials for almost two days depended on a 
Florida radio station to deliver vital information and warnings. 
</P>
<P>
Millions were watching the pregame World Series program when the earthquake 
struck, and instantly word was out that there had been a disaster. San 
Francisco stations were able to broadcast to residents who had battery-powered 
radios and TVs. 
</P>
<P>
Damage estimates from Hugo have ranged as high as $5 billion, while earthquake 
damage estimates Sunday reached the $6.6 billion mark. 
</P>
<P>
Besides that black page in the ledger of history, both San Francisco and 
Charleston also have another experience in common: Both have experienced 
frustrating delays in getting disaster relief from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg, who has now watched the federal government respond to two of 
America's worst disasters, said he sees relatively few differences between how 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency worked in South Carolina and Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing that needs to be done in a hurry with them," he said. "They 
just plop along like one of the horses at Disneyland. Just plop, plop, plop. 
They are repeating the mistakes of South Carolina in California."

The state Office of Emergency Services now estimates damage at more than $6.4 
billion, including about $1 billion to state highways and bridges. U.S. Sen. 
Alan Cranston's office estimates total damage at $7.12 billion, including $2.5 
billion in San Francisco alone. 
</P>
<P>
The OES estimates 405 single family homes, 104 mobile homes and an unknown 
number of apartments destroyed, and 107,768 single-family homes, 20 mobile 
homes and 320 apartments damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The OES estimates 99 businesses and three public buildings destroyed, and 1,554 
businesses and 24 public buildings damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The state estimates that 7,362 people were displaced from homes, 5,000 of them 
in Santa Cruz and 1,100 in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Casualties 
</P>
<P>
Deaths: Latest figures from the state Office of Emergency Services show that 60 
people died, with 38 of the bodies found in the wreckage of the Nimitz Freeway 
in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries: The state tally is 3,012, with 900 of them in Santa Clara County, 862 
in Santa Cruz and 566 in San Francisco.

Services 
</P>
<P>
Bay Area Rapid Transit added trains, buses and ferries and increased schedules 
to handle above-normal loads as transportation officials sought ways to ease 
traffic jams expected today as people return to work. 
</P>
<P>
Electric power, water and other utilities were restored to most areas. Drinking 
water and portable showers were trucked into mountain areas like Redwood 
Estates, where water service will not be restored for days. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone service to the 2.5 million Bay Area customers suffered little from 
the earthquake, except for overburdened use. But officials worry that weekend 
rain could knock out service in some areas by seeping through cable casings 
cracked or twisted in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency said seven one-stop disaster assistance 
centers opened Sunday. Victims can register for everything from temporary 
housing to grants and loans. One center will be located in each of the 
hardest-hit counties.

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At precisely 8:33 Friday night, visiting conductor Gunther Herbig took the 
podium at Davies Symphony Hall here, raising his baton to begin Mozart's 
Symphony No. 25 in G minor before what would ordinarily have been a 
disappointing crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Bunches of empty seats dotted the orchestra and balconies. Only about three 
quarters of the hall was filled. And for those people who did attend, the 
strictly musical result was unspectacular. 
</P>
<P>
"Their hearts aren't in it," complained one veteran of the San Francisco 
Symphony in the intermission between the Mozart and Shostakovich's Symphony No. 
4 in C minor, Opus 43. 
</P>
<P>
But if the performance was a forgettable one, the circumstances were not. 
Hurriedly stuffed into each program was a black-bordered note from Herbert 
Blomstedt, the symphony's music director: 
</P>
<P>
"I am indeed grateful that I can welcome you tonight into a hall undamaged by 
the earthquake this week. There is sadness and grief in our hearts, and as 
never before we need consolation and confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"As we dedicate these concerts to all victims of the catastrophe, it is my wish 
that the music you hear will speak to you not only about passion and pain but 
also about compassion and hope." 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Opera, temporarily turned out of its permanent quarters by 
Tuesday's 6.9 earthquake, played Friday night, too -- to an audience that only 
half filled the Masonic Temple, its emergency home. 
</P>
<P>
And so it was that San Francisco turned to the arts to calm frayed nerves and 
bring a sense that things might, somehow, be all right again. It was an 
aspiration widely discussed before the performance among patrons at Harry's 
Bar, up Van Ness Avenue from the symphony hall and the still shuttered Opera 
House, which will not reopen until the middle of this week -- and only then 
with a jury-rigged net suspended below the ceiling to keep debris from falling 
into the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Margie O'Driscoll, appointed as Mayor Art Agnos' cultural affairs liaison just 
two week ago, smiled when she recalled that, like thousand of others, she was 
at Candlestick Park Tuesday afternoon, most concerned about whether the San 
Francisco Giants could salvage the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
But by the weekend, O'Driscoll appeared to represent a widespread consensus 
here that the delay of the World Series until at least Tuesday was appropriate 
but that arts organizations -- art galleries and museums as well as performing 
arts groups -- needed to get back into operation as quickly as they could. 
</P>
<P>
"The World Series is a sense of competition and the arts aren't like that," 
O'Driscoll said. "They can bring people together without having to involve a 
winner or a loser." 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps in the scale of things, people see the World Series as something they 
can live without and the arts as something crucial at a time of trauma," said 
Donald Osborne, a booking agency specializing in classical music and serious 
dance acts here. 
</P>
<P>
"People right now are looking to see something of normalcy. The arts have 
always played an important part. It goes beyond diversion. The arts make more 
clear to us the details and deeper meaning of the problem we have just had." 
</P>
<P>
The Opera House emergency net will have to stay up until there is a long enough 
gap in the San Francisco Opera's schedule to permit repairs. Patrons will see 
this reminder of the quake until at least sometime in January, Opera House 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Thelma Shelley, managing director of the city-owned War Memorial complex, which 
includes the Opera House and the Museum of Modern Art, where three sculptures 
were heavily damaged, acknowledged that the draping beneath the Opera House 
ceiling would be something of an acoustic crap shoot whose effects won't be 
known until the hall reopens Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But in the middle her desk, Shelley displayed a chief reason she didn't see the 
acoustic issue as terribly significant, or even worth discussing -- a 15-inch 
long section of gold-painted plaster and concrete molding, weighing perhaps 
eight pounds, that fell to the orchestra floor during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
The quake closed virtually all of the city's cultural institutions. Some, 
including at least two small art galleries, will never be able to reopen and 
their buildings will be demolished. But by Saturday morning, the arts had begun 
to dig out. 
</P>
<P>
Osborne made telephone contact with the half dozen of his clients who reside in 
San Francisco. But by the end of the week, Osborne had to face the fact that he 
would have to fly out on a business trip without making contact with Tandy Beal 
&amp; Co., a prominent dance troupe headquartered in Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
The plight of Tandy Beal illustrates what arts officials here fear may turn out 
to be the harsh reality for the foreseeable future. While there are high hopes 
that the arts will contribute to post-earthquake social catharsis, there is 
also a very great possibility that they will miss out on financial disaster 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
Osborne was not concerned for the physical safety of Tandy Beal and the half 
dozen permanent employees of the dance company. Though phones were still out at 
the end of the week, Osborne had contacted friends of the dancers and learned 
they had been spared. 
</P>
<P>
But Beal's offices were in a building in downtown Santa Cruz that was heavily 
damaged, and may have collapsed. Worse still was the fate of Cafe Zinio, a 
successful coffee shop Beal bought to serve as a profit center to offset the 
peak-and-valley finances of dance. 
</P>
<P>
The concept had begun to work, Osborne said. But the quake wiped everything 
out. Cafe Zinio, Osborne said, was apparently destroyed. "They've taken quite a 
shot," he said of Tandy Beal. "I'm sure they're very badly off right now." 
</P>
<P>
Disconsolately, O'Driscoll looked up at a four-story red brick loft building at 
the corner of 11th and Folsom streets, a few blocks south of Market Street. 
Starting at the roof and descending about halfway down one corner ran a 
breathtaking crack. Bricks still tumbled from the walls and the entire affair 
had the look of a landslide about to occur. 
</P>
<P>
Metal police barricades had been placed around it, half blocking the 
intersection. Entry was understandably forbidden. But when city workers nearby 
told O'Driscoll artists were furiously trying to salvage their possessions 
inside, she took a deep breath and went in. 
</P>
<P>
The structure had an ironic special meaning for her. For several months before 
she joined Agnos's staff, O'Driscoll, working as a private arts advocate, had 
helped artist tenants organize to fight rent increases and other changes in the 
building's management that threatened to force them to move. 
</P>
<P>
On the third floor, Katherine Fitzgerald, a photographer, and her husband, 
sculptor Jean-Louis Pierson, along with two friends, were frantically packing 
clothes, furniture and artworks. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald is six months pregnant. The couple also has an 18-month-old 
daughter. Their loft space had also made up a gallery called Show and Tell, 
which O'Driscoll and local artists said was a significant component of the 
local art vanguard. 
</P>
<P>
"The irony is that we went through this big fight to stay here," said 
Fitzgerald. "We're just going to move everything we can to friends' houses." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald and Pierson moved about the loft as if they were truly stunned. When 
the quake hit, Pierson grabbed their daughter and ran for the street because it 
was clear the building was coming apart. On his way out the door, he was almost 
killed by falling bricks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounded as if there was a train coming through the building," Fitzgerald 
said. "We ran for the door, but kept getting thrown to the floor by the shock. 
Finally, we got out." 
</P>
<P>
Now, three days later, the numbing, long-term implications of what had happened 
were striking Fitzgerald and Pierson perhaps harder emotionally than the quake 
itself. Pierson said the gallery had begun to produce some steady income, with 
the promise of at least a modicum of financial stability between sculpture 
commissions and sales of Fitzgerald's photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Rent deposits for new quarters and even the costs of a temporary storage locker 
were beyond the two artists' means, they said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Driscoll quickly phoned her office and ordered a private truck whose services 
had been donated to the city to help evacuate artists. 
</P>
<P>
Pierson, meanwhile, continued the struggle to pack. What, he was asked, would 
the family and the gallery do next? "I really don't know about that yet," he 
said, almost dazed. "I really don't know." 
</P>
<P>
George Coates didn't immediately realize it, but the first few seconds of the 
quake had, in a sense, devastated his professional and creative life. For a 
week before the temblor hit, Coates had been riding about as high as he ever 
had in his career as a producer and director of theater productions that have 
been widely acclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
His "Right Mind," a multimedia play based on the life of 19th-Century eccentric 
Charles Dodson, had played to sold-out houses at the American Conservatory 
Theater -- ACT -- on Geary Street. With two weeks left to run, the show 
promised near sell-outs of each of its nine weekly performances. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of George Coates's most satisfying moments. "We had the last week 
sold out," he said, "and the people were voting with their pocket books." 
</P>
<P>
The ACT building itself, the 1,300-seat former Geary Theater, came through the 
quake without significant structural damage. But in the shaking, the massive 
grid supporting the lighting system and other structural components above the 
stage came loose and crashed to the floor. That forced cancellation of "Right 
Mind" and probably wiped out the entire run of its next production. 
</P>
<P>
Coates, of course, didn't know any of this at the moment the shaking began. He 
was playing an old upright piano in his company's rehearsal space -- an old 
chapel off the lobby of the University of California's Hastings College of Law 
a few blocks from ACT. 
</P>
<P>
"The building began rumbling and heaving, and I laughed," Coates recalled, "at 
the way my piano playing was being insulted by the whole building. I thought it 
was a 3.5. But it was really a hand coming from the sky to ---- with me." 
</P>
<P>
Coates faces a daunting challenge. The production employs 55 people, 30 of whom 
are more or less on his company's regular payroll. "Right Mind" can be moved to 
the rehearsal space, but the old chapel will seat only 486. In fact, there 
aren't any seats in it at all at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
Coates figures the transition could take at least a month. But he greets this 
challenge with mixed emotions -- most of them defiant. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, Coates said he suspects government disaster-relief programs 
will leave the arts out. "I hope the federal government doesn't include 
cultural efforts in the list of things that are left out" of eligibility for 
assistance. "It would be a form of aesthetic racism." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, the one-month transition to remount the production 
-- an interval that would, under other circumstances, risk losing the interest 
of the potential audience -- may not be a factor now. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're in normal circumstances," Coates said as he sat in a 
folding chair in the middle of the floor of the cavernous, dimly lit chapel. 
"And I hope we don't return to normalcy anytime soon. It's a very special 
condition this community is in. The world of this place just stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a real optimist about this. We were staging a spectacle that was 
interrupted by a major act of nature. I'm a real fan . . . an aficionado . . . 
of scale. I like things that are MAMMOTH. And we certainly have had scale."

MOST PUBLICLY OWNED ART SURVIVES THE BAY AREA QUAKE

<TEXT>
<P>
The city's famed collection of municipally owned public artworks -- ranging 
from 19th-Century monuments to cutting-edge sculpture and painting -- largely 
escaped serious damage in last week's earthquake, city arts officials say. 
</P>
<P>
But an inventory of municipal art and citywide arts-damage assessment scheduled 
to be presented today to Mayor Art Agnos found that public art at San Francisco 
International Airport sustained some major losses and that some museums, 
theaters and galleries face daunting challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the first postquake arts catastrophe analysis were provided by 
Claire Isaacs, director of cultural affairs at the Arts Commission of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Isaacs said that while museum- and publicly owned art objects fared 
comparatively well in the quake, the most significant lasting effect for the 
local arts community may turn out to be in the problems posed by canceled or 
postponed performances, exhibition openings and fund-raising events. 
</P>
<P>
But she said she hoped that the city's collective pluck -- showcased by the 
tenacity of its arts institutions in resuming normal operations -- may have a 
major benefit for San Francisco. She said she has been concerned about erosion 
of the city's self-image in the aftermath of the assassination of former Mayor 
George Moscone and the AIDS crisis, in particular, which has cast San Francisco 
in an unfamiliar morbid role in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
"The tradition of San Francisco has been that we sip wine while the world is 
falling apart," she said. Through the arts, she said, "San Francisco shows the 
world that it's OK. We need for the world to know that." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday morning, the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in Golden Gate Park 
reopened, with plywood and 2-by-4 braces shoring up four archways just inside 
the front entrance. The California Palace of the Legion of Honor in Lincoln 
Park may reopen next week after engineers complete an inspection of heavily 
damaged interior decorative columns in the building's rotunda. 
</P>
<P>
Two small private galleries were condemned by building inspectors and will have 
to be demolished, Isaacs said, and the city's Asian Museum of Art, which 
adjoins the de Young, must cope with both damage to 31 important objects in its 
collection and with the suspected release of asbestos fibers in the air in its 
storage spaces -- apparently from pipes whose coverings disintegrated in the 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
Isaacs said officials conducted a hurried citywide inspection of nearly all of 
the municipal collections. The city owns several thousand art pieces, Isaacs 
said, ranging from large outdoor sculptures to paintings and small objects in 
individual city offices. 
</P>
<P>
The inspection emphasized 262 of the most important pieces in the city 
collection, including such things as Depression-era paintings and frescoes in 
Coit Tower, the Vaillancourt Fountain, George Segal's Holocaust Memorial at the 
California Palace of the Legion of Honor in Lincoln Park and Rodin's "The 
Thinker" in the same location. 
</P>
<P>
Isaacs said there was no damage apparent to any of the city artworks -- except 
for at least three major contemporary pieces at the airport. They are among 64 
airport artworks. Major damage was sustained after ceiling materials in the 
United Airlines area of the airport's North Terminal collapsed and the quake 
motion set off fire sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
A huge untitled acrylic-on-canvas painting by Sam Francis suffered heavy water 
damage and was partially torn. A fragile paper and bamboo hanging sculpture by 
Nance O'Banion was devastated when it was hit by sprinkler water, which warped 
some of the wood and caused one piece of the sculpture to fall to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
A large acrylic hanging sculpture by Freda Koblick was not damaged, said 
Isaacs, but will have to undergo costly removal so workers can repair damaged 
ceiling structures above it. All three works are in the United boarding-gate 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Isaacs said initial fears of massive damage to the collection of the Mexican 
Museum in the Fort Mason Center turned out to be greater than actual losses, 
but she said the museum's gift shop -- a key revenue center -- was severely 
hit.

PAY RAISES: Top managers in Orange County can expect an average 5.9% salary 
increase in 1990, according to a new survey of planned merit raises released by 
an Irvine-based consultant. . . . That tops projected jumps of 5.7% in Los 
Angeles and 5.5% in San Diego. . . . The news is not as good for mid-level 
managers and hourly workers, whose projected pay raises of 5.3% fall well below 
figures in those neighboring counties and the state average. Lanie Jones and

REAL ESTATE: Building permits for single-family homes in the county are at 
their lowest level since 1986, but builders aren't panicking. . . . Permits are 
down 28% from 1988 and 14% from 1987, but last year's figures may have been 
boosted by concern that a slow-growth initiative would pass, a building 
industry spokesman says. Lanie Jones and Rick VanderKyff

SEISMIC: Most people don't notice, but one small quake a month occurs along the 
Orange County coast. . . . On the Newport-Inglewood Fault, the earth is moving 
-- but "not enough to release the strain," Caltech analyst Steve Bryant warns.

CITY SERVICES COULD HINGE ON TAX VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RACHELLE MOLLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters in this small bedroom community could face a difficult choice Nov. 7: 
approve higher taxes or feel cuts in such basic community services as police 
protection and recreation programs. 
</P>
<P>
Ballot Measure Q, a 4% tax on utilities, would raise revenue for the city's 
general fund, the Police and Recreation departments, and other city 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
"The general fund has suffered continually (since Proposition 13)," City 
Manager Paul Bussey said, citing cuts in property taxes that significantly 
reduced the major source of income for La Palma and similar communities that do 
not have large business communities to contribute to the tax base. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the income from the city's new Centerpointe development, La Palma's 
sales tax income is still lowest in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"This is happening to a lot of bedroom communities. . . . Fortunately, we're 
better off than some others," Mayor Orbrey Duke said. "We can afford this tax." 
</P>
<P>
La Palma has the fourth-highest per capita family income of any city in Orange 
County, yet due to a low housing turnover rate, has below-average property 
taxes, and its general fund revenue per capita is also below the county 
average. 
</P>
<P>
"People expect property taxes to pay for everything, but they pay for just over 
half of the Police Department," said Carl Eriksen, who heads a citizen-based 
committee in support of Measure Q. 
</P>
<P>
Although the amount of the proposed tax is small, estimated at about $8 per 
household per month, city officials said they fear voters will reject the 
measure simply because they oppose any taxation. 
</P>
<P>
"If the voters reject the nominal expense, they'd better be prepared to 
instruct the council where they want cuts to go," Eriksen said. 
</P>
<P>
He said cuts would likely be in personnel and salary, which consume 70 to 80% 
of the general fund resources. If the city were to cut $200,000 in salaries, he 
said, it would lose six people, or 10% of the city staff. 
</P>
<P>
Also in jeopardy would be the community's drug awareness program and various 
youth and senior programs. Duke also said the city has no reserves for 
emergency relief in case of a disaster similar to the earthquake that struck 
the San Francisco Bay area last week. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest opposition to Measure Q comes from Copley Colony Cablevision, 
whose services would be taxed along with telephone, gas and electricity. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's unfair to consider us a utility," said Pete Eliason, general 
manager of Copley Colony Cablevision. 
</P>
<P>
He said the tax would be discriminatory, requiring cable television users to 
pay higher taxes than other citizens, thus supporting a larger part of the 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition, city officials predicted that the measure will pass. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people are responsive. . . . They want to keep what we have. Hopefully, 
we're not deluding ourselves," Councilman Keith Nelson said. RACHELLE MOLLIN

STUDENT DEBATERS TAKE ON THE WORLD

<TEXT>
<P>
It is probably not every day that a local schoolboy goes one-on-one with Fidel 
Castro. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Seth Gorman and his fellow students at Mission Viejo High School's Model 
United Nations class regularly challenge international leaders like Castro in 
debate -- and sometimes win. 
</P>
<P>
For some in the program, the best part is dressing up as people such as Castro. 
</P>
<P>
"People really enjoy role-playing," said the Mission Viejo senior. "We try to 
keep them under control." 
</P>
<P>
Drawn from Mission Viejo high's honors program, Model United Nations students 
tackle the same problems that heads of state struggle over, from terrorism to 
disarmament, said adviser Laurie Kund. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about the most exciting thing a kid can do," she said, "and it's the best 
program around for training kids for a university." 
</P>
<P>
Each student adopts a nation, then spends hours studying it and the surrounding 
region, Kund said. Copying the United Nations, the students break into 
delegations, debate the issues and in the process, develop a world view of 
events. 
</P>
<P>
"I represented the Central African Republic once," Gorman said. "You can learn 
a lot from taking the side of a small country. They can learn from us, the 
United States, by learning how to use our modern technology. From them, we can 
learn that no problem is too large to be overcome." 
</P>
<P>
With 120 students, the Mission Viejo program is the fourth largest among the 
nation's high schools, Kund said. It will send representatives to a Model 
United Nations conference at Stanford University in November. The students will 
also take their debating skills across the country later this school year to a 
program at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Students can enter the program as freshmen and stay throughout their high 
school careers, which, Kund said, is her favorite part of being the group's 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
"I get to see them come in as scared freshmen and watch them grow up to be 
mature, confident young people," she said. "That's also very exciting." FRANK 
MESSINA

CONTAINMENT OF FIRE EXPECTED BY TONIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
The 5-day-old forest fire straddling Orange, San Diego and Riverside counties 
is expected to be fully contained by late this afternoon, according to the U. 
S. National Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
"The rainy weather today really did help us," said Audrey Hagen, a spokeswoman 
for the U. S. National Forest Service, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Hagen said the remaining pockets of fire on Sunday were confined to a wooded 
area in Riverside County, just north of the San Diego County line. About 900 
firefighters were on duty Sunday working to extinguish those final blazes, she 
said. Hagen added that no fires remained active in the Orange County portion of 
the Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
The forest fire, which started Wednesday at the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton in 
San Diego County, was 65% contained by Sunday afternoon, Hagen said. "We expect 
100% containment by 6 p.m. Monday," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As of Sunday, the forest fire had burned 10,925 acres in the three counties, 
Hagen said. She said four firefighters had been injured during the past five 
days, but none of the injuries was life-threatening. They included a cut knee, 
a dislocated shoulder, chest pains and a minor burn, Hagen said. 
</P>
<P>
The forest service has estimated that the total cost of extinguishing the blaze 
would be $2.5 million, including manpower and equipment. That figure does not 
include property loss, primarily in trees and shrub, due to the fire. The 
forest service had no loss estimate yet on the fire's total property damage. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire has been attributed to "military training" at Camp 
Pendleton, Hagen said, adding that she had no information on the exact sort of 
training that caused the fire to ignite and spread. BILL BILLITER

<P>
An Anaheim liquor store owner was severely beaten Sunday night by a man trying 
to rob the store, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, whose name was withheld until relatives could be notified, was 
rushed to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he was in critical condition with 
unspecified injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Fred Roush said the robber entered the liquor store in the 2600 
block of West Lincoln Avenue at 8:26 p.m. and demanded cash. The men struggled, 
and the robber eventually fled. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the attacker was described as white, 18 to 19 years old, 5 feet, 6 
inches tall and 190 pounds, with shoulder-length, brownish-blond hair, blue

2 ROB RESTAURANT, SHOOT AT MALL GUARD

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two robbers, one brandishing an automatic handgun, held up a restaurant in the 
MainPlace shopping mall and then shot at a security guard who tried to stop 
them, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The two robbed Boardwalk Fries in the mall, on the 2800 block of North Main 
Street, about 8:30 p.m. Saturday, said Police Sgt. John Dittus. Mall security 
guard Darren Cole chased the two men into the parking lot, where one of them 
turned and fired at Cole several times and missed, Dittus said. 
</P>
<P>
Another guard, James Smith, spotted the robbers getting away in a small black 
pickup truck and chased them to Culver Avenue and Main Street in Orange, where 
they abandoned the truck and fled.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

<P>
Abortion 
</P>
<P>
The House adopted, 216 to 206, an amendment to broaden federal abortion policy 
by permitting Medicaid funding of the medical procedure when the pregnancy 
results from rape or incest. The language was attached to a fiscal 1990 
appropriations bill (HR 2990). Medicaid now covers only those abortions 
necessary to save the mother's life. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.) said, "Congress cannot and must not turn its 
back on the poorest victims of rape and incest who become pregnant." 
</P>

Opponent Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) said: "Rape and incest are tragedies. . . . But 
why visit on the second victim, the unborn child that is the product of (the) 
criminal act, capital punishment?"

Members voting yes supported Medicaid funding of abortion if the pregnancy is

The Flag 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 371 to 43, the House sent to President Bush a bill (HR 2978) 
making it a federal crime to physically damage the American flag. Also due for 
congressional votes this year are proposals backed by conservatives to protect 
the flag by constitutional amendment. The legislative activity is in response 
to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling this year that flag desecration is political 
expression protected by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Don Edwards (D-San Jose), said it is better "to protect the flag by a 
simple statute than to go through the mammoth and dangerous procedure of 
weakening for the first time in our history the free speech provisions of the 
Bill of Rights." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) said, "If you really want to protect the 
flag, if you really want to do something more than make a gesture, then given 
the court's decision you have to support our bipartisan constitutional 
amendment to save the flag." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to protect the flag by statute.

THE FINAL DISASTER WE MUST AVERT; 
</P>

ENVIRONMENT: IN OUR PURSUIT OF "PROGRESS" WE ARE ATTACKING THE FRAGILE ENVELOPE 
OF AIR, WATER AND EARTH THAT SUSTAINS LIFE. SURELY NATURE WILL EXACT A FEARFUL

Many years ago, as a third-year student at Harvard Law School, I was selected 
to become a law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter. That spring, 
on a visit to Harvard, the justice met with me and asked when I intended to 
come to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as school ends," I replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Take some time off for a vacation first," he advised. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't need a vacation," I answered, whereupon the diminutive Frankfurter 
wheeled toward me and pointing an admonishing finger, sternly rejoined: "Young 
man! There's one thing I want you to remember for the rest of your career -- 
the laws of physiology are inexorable." I took the vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area is but another reminder of 
the truism that nature pursues its own remorseless course, is ignored or defied 
only at the peril of human existence. The damage to the Bay Area is reversible; 
structures will be rebuilt and life will continue. But history teaches that 
this is not always the case: Pompeii still lies buried beneath ancient lava 
flows; the dinosaurs will never return. 
</P>
<P>
We live at a time when human defiance of nature is unparalleled in scope and 
ferocity. And surely nature will exact a fearful revenge. In our obsessive 
pursuit of "progress" -- the accumulation of wealth -- we are attacking the 
fragile envelope of air, water and earth that sustains life. We call this the 
"problem of the environment." But the problem is not with the environment, but 
with the systematic, willful, devastating defiance of the human race. 
</P>
<P>
We continue to pump man-made poisons into the air and water; unleash the 
chemicals that slowly dissolve the life-protecting layer of ozone guarding us 
from the sun; heap up the blanket of gases that are transforming the climate of 
the Earth and endangering the intricately woven chain of life. Much of this 
damage is already irreversible. Thousands, probably hundreds of thousands, have 
already been condemned to a premature death -- from man-caused cancers or heart 
attacks or respiratory diseases. And this reality is only the first, faint and 
distant warning of calamities yet to come, calamities that only immediate, 
drastic and costly action can avert. 
</P>
<P>
We all know this to be true. Still we persist. We are in the grips of a malady 
as old as the race -- the wishful thinking, the barely conscious 
self-deception, that disaster will somehow be averted, that it can't really 
happen to us, that some kind of magic (in our time known as technology) will 
find a way to turn back the steadily mounting tides. 
</P>
<P>
"Nature," it has been written, "is the great democrat." Surely this is true of 
the vengeance that our ravaging of the Earth is bringing upon us. Even the 
wealthiest and most powerful cannot purchase escape from life-threatening air, 
poisoned water, the warming of the globe. The truth is that there is no more 
time. We have already exceeded the limits that nature can bear. 
</P>
<P>
There's no question that to save ourselves, we must take action immediately 
that will reduce our standard of existence, change the course of development. 
Perhaps faced with so stark an unavoidable a choice -- once we admit that is 
the choice -- science will find other means of enhancing our material 
existence. And, perhaps not. But one thing is certain. Such alternatives will 
be found only when the crisis is actually upon us. We are too choked with 
arrogance and gifted with self-deception to forgo present satisfaction for the 
sake of the future -- even the future survival of our own descendants. This 
incapacity is not a peculiarly modern affliction. History is littered with the 
wreckage of past empires that overreached themselves and tumbled into the abyss 
of memory. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, always before, as civilizations dissolve, others succeeded. Now we 
confront not so trivial a displacement, but the potential devastation of the 
entire planet. An Earth can have no successors. An overstatement? Perhaps. But 
a mounting possibility. Although some, indeterminate damage has already been 
done, it is not too late -- probably -- to avert far larger catastrophe. The 
nations of the world, the leaders among the nations, could meet to declare a 
global emergency and take those severe actions that might arrest the process of 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
We can do this. But I have little confidence that we will do so. Only a 
swelling clamor, a demand, from the threatened people of the Earth can stir the 
powerful of enterprise and government to action. 
</P>
<P>
The time for analysis is past. If we fail now, we will have made a prophet of 
T.S. Eliot when he wrote: "This is the way the world ends. . . . Not with a 
bang, but a whimper." 
</P>
<P>
And we will have deserved such an ending.

BIG PLAYS 
</P>
<P>
Miami's Pete Stoyanovich kicked a 33-yard field goal with six seconds left to 
give the Dolphins a 23-20 win over the Green Bay Packers. It was his second 
game-winning field goal in the final seconds in the last three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay's Ricky Reynolds blocked a Ralf Mojsiejenko punt and returned it 33 
yards for a touchdown in a 32-28 loss to Washington. It was only the second 
blocked punt in the 13-year history of the franchise and the first touchdown 
scored by a Bucs' punt-return unit. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Hebert threw touchdown passes of 54 yards to Floyd Turner and 37 yards to 
Eric Martin on consecutive plays early in the third quarter to send the New 
Orleans to a 40-21 victory over the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
David Treadwell, who missed a 27-yard attempt with 16 seconds left in 
regulation, converted a 27-yard field goal with 7:14 left in overtime to give 
the Denver a 24-21 victory at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Earl Ferrell scored two of his three touchdowns in the first quarter and 
Phoenix ended its four-game losing streak with a 34-20 win over Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Trudeau threw a three-yard touchdown pass to Albert Bentley and Eric 
Dickerson dashed 21 yards for another score in the final two minutes as 
Indianapolis pulled away from Cincinnati for a 23-12 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Moon completed his first eight passes and threw three touchdown passes 
in the first half, leading Houston to a 27-0 victory over Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Mike Merriweather had one sack, one interception, caused two fumbles 
and recovered one of them for Minnesota in the Vikings' 20-7 win over Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Vencie Glenn scooped up a fumble by Maurice Carthon and returned it 
81 yards for a touchdown -- the longest fumble return in team history -- in the 
Chargers' 20-13 loss to the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FILLING IN 
</P>
<P>
Steve Young, taking over when Joe Montana suffered a slight knee sprain late in 
the first half, threw a 50-yard touchdown pass to Jerry Rice in the third 
quarter to break a 17-17 tie and the San Francisco 49ers went on to defeat New 
England, 37-20. Young completed 10 of 11 passes for 188 yards and three 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Reich, in his second start in place of the injured Jim Kelly, threw three 
touchdown passes as Buffalo routed the New York Jets, 34-3. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco safety Jeff Fuller suffered multiple fractures in his neck on the 
second play of the 49ers' 37-20 victory over New England, causing nerve-root 
damage that may cost him full use of his right arm. Team physician Dr. Michael 
Dillingham said the injury is not life-threatening and that Fuller is in stable 
condition, alert and able to move his extremities, in the intensive care unit 
at Stanford University Hospital. Fuller also sustained a concussion. He was 
injured when he tackled Patriot running back John Stephens. Fuller, was 
administered oxygen before being taken from the field by ambulance to the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the game, the 49ers lost two other players to fractures -- linebacker 
Jim Fahnhorst with an apparent stress fracture in his right foot and reserve 
fullback Harry Sydney with a slight fracture in his left arm. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco fans got another scare in the closing seconds of the first half 
when quarterback Joe Montana was carted off the field with an injured left 
knee. However, Montana jogged back to the sidelines in the fourth quarter and 
team officials said he could have returned to the game, if needed. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix, which has had 12 starters go down with injuries since the season 
started, lost rookie defensive tackle Jim Wahler with a sprained left knee in 
the third quarter and cornerback Carl Carter with a pulled right hamstring in 
the first half of the Cardinals' 34-20 win over Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Denver fullback Jeff Alexander was sidelined with a sprained ankle in the first 
quarter of the Broncos' 24-21 overtime win over Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Darrell Green of Washington suffered a dislocated left wrist in the 
third quarter of the Redskins' 32-28 victory over Tampa Bay. He underwent 
surgery Sunday night and will be out two to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Troy Stradford, who gained 53 yards in 15 carries, suffered a knee 
injury in the Dolphins' 23-20 victory over Green Bay. Stradford will be 
sidelined indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE GREAT OUTDOORS 
</P>
<P>
Houston Oiler Coach Jerry Glanville was bitten by a poisonous water moccasin 
snake as he walked through high grass near his home Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
He was hospitalized Saturday night and came to the Astrodome on crutches for 
Sunday's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
Glanville discarded the crutches, however, and came onto the field with the 
team without a noticeable limp. 
</P>
<P>
The Oiler coach was bitten on the top of his right foot after he stepped on the 
large snake near a home under construction in his neighborhood southwest of 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
After Houston's 27-0 victory, Glanville reserved his biting comments for 
Pittsburgh Coach Chuck Noll, with whom he has openly feuded since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Chuck was in my neighborhood yesterday but I guess not. We'll talk 
about that later, let's enjoy the team win," said Glanville, who was scheduled 
to be tested by doctors again after the game. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LOWLIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
Lars Tate was Tampa Bay's leading rusher with seven yards in six carries in a 
32-28 loss to Washington. The Bucs finished with one yard on the ground in 10 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta linebacker Aundray Bruce was ejected from the Falcons' 34-20 win 
against Atlanta with 10:27 left in the first quarter for leaving the bench to 
join in a brief on-field fight, which started after a hard sack of Phoenix 
quarterback Gary Hogeboom by linebacker Marcus Cotton. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh defensive end Keith Willis helped the Oilers to a touchdown with 
consecutive 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. Willis was flagged 15 
yards for bumping an official and another 15 yards for throwing his helmet 
after the first penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix-Atlanta game, played in 78-degree weather, drew just 33,894 at 
74,724-seat Sun Devil Stadium, the smallest crowd since the Cardinals moved 
from St. Louis last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MILESTONES 
</P>
<P>
Eric Dickerson, who rushed for a season-high 152 yards in 31 carries in 
Indianapolis' 23-13 victory over Cincinnati, established a team record with his 
17th 100-yard game, surpassing Lydell Mitchell on the all-time Colt list. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Okoye of Kansas City carried the ball a team-record 33 times, gaining 
170 yards and scoring twice in the Chiefs' 36-28 victory over Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
J.T. Smith had seven receptions for 96 yards in Phoenix's 34-20 victory over 
Atlanta, moving him into a tie for fifth place with Mel Gray on the Cardinals' 
all-time receiving list. Smith has 351 career receptions. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Craig of the 49ers established a team record for rushing touchdowns with 
a three-yard scoring run in the fourth quarter of San Francisco's 37-20 victory 
over New England. With his 62nd career touchdown, Craig surpassed Ken Willard 
on the all-time 49er list. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STREAKS 
</P>
<P>
Stephone Paige of Kansas City had two catches for 33 yards, extending to 55 his 
streak for games with receptions, in the Chiefs' 36-28 victory over Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Mickey Shuler of the New York Jets had three catches for 34 yards, 
extending to 85 his streak for games with receptions, in the Jets' 34-3 loss to 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
Miami extended its NFL record to 19 consecutive games without allowing a sack 
in a 23-20 win against the Green Bay Packers. Since last allowing a sack, the 
Dolphins have attempted 766 passes -- including 740 by Dan Marino. Tackle 
Ronnie Lee, center/tackle Jeff Dellenbach, guard Roy Foster and guard Harry 
Galbreath have started each of the games during the streak. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Carter of Minnesota had one catch for 16 yards, extending to 56 his 
streak for games with receptions, in the Vikings' 20-7 victory over Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
New England linebacker Ed Reynolds, on playing in the Bay Area: "I don't think 
a lot of us were crazy about coming out here to play. There was a lot of death 
out here. I thought we came here out of respect for the fans. Any time there is 
a catastrophe like they had here, your mind is on it, but we were also getting 
an opportunity to play the champions, and any time you have that, you want to 
play." 
</P>
<P>
Patriot fullback Mosi Tatupu: "It was kind of a weird atmosphere around here. 
It was kind of an awkward feeling having to come here to play a game. We just 
had to try to remember to win the game." 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco center Jesse Sapolu: "You do your best to move on, even while 
you know people are still trapped under that freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 Miami kicker Pete Stoyanovich after his 27-yard field goal gave the Dolphins a 
23-20 victory over Green Bay: "I remembered one thing -- he (holder Scott 
Secules) said if it ever happens again, turn toward him so he can be in the 
picture." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Ken O'Brien after the Jets committed three turnovers and were 
called for nine penalties in a 34-3 loss to Buffalo: "Mistakes, week after 
week, are killing us. It seems we're pulling the noose a little tighter on 
ourselves all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Bubba McDowell, Houston's rookie safety, who had two interceptions in the 
Oilers' 27-0 win: "Coach (Jerry) Glanville told me on Monday that I couldn't 
make any more rookie mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Palmer, a former first-round draft choice of Kansas City signed this week 
by Dallas, on playing against his former team: "I was taunting the (Kansas 
City) coaching staff a little bit. My fiancee said, 'Now, they'll know what 
it's like to hold their breath every time you carry the ball.' I felt like that 
today. It felt good to get that touchdown against the Chiefs defense because 
they're exceptional against the run." 
</P>
<P>
New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor on quarterback Jim McMahon, who 
completed only 12 of 27 passes for 133 yards in San Diego's 20-13: "He's a 
gutsy player, but it's a different type of Jim McMahon now. Maybe they're 
asking him to do different things here." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle kicker Norm Johnson, on missing a 40-yard field-goal attempt in a 24-21 
overtime loss to Denver: "I was waiting for that kick all day long. Then when I 
finally get the opportunity, I miss it. Forty yards is nothing. I can make 
those in my sleep." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TONIGHT'S GAME 
</P>
<P>
Chicago at Cleveland, 6 p.m., PDT -- Some of the Chicago Bears worry about 
their health when Coach Mike Ditka periodically gets angry. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Mike Singletary worries about Ditka's health. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the only thing that scares me when he acts like that," Singletary said 
as the Bears (4-2) prepared to meet the Cleveland Browns (3-3). 
</P>
<P>
Ditka talked of mellowing after suffering a heart attack last Nov. 2. Yet he 
let the health problems sideline him for only one game, and last week he became 
angry after the Bears dropped their second consecutive game, committing six 
turnovers in a 33-28 loss to the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
"I mellowed the week I was in the hospital," Ditka said. "I got excited last 
week. Every once in a while, you have to blow off some steam, and I blew off 
some steam." 
</P>
<P>
Both teams have been dogged by injuries. Chicago's defense has been riddled by 
injuries to Richard Dent, Dan Hampton and Jim Morrissey. In Cleveland, there is 
concern about quarterback Bernie Kosar's right elbow, which he sprained last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Kosar threw a career-high four interceptions last Sunday in Cleveland's 17-7 
loss to Pittsburgh, but said his elbow is fine. "I don't think it's a problem," 
Kosar said. "I've been throwing the deep ball pretty good -- not as good as I'd 
like, but the distance on my throws hasn't been a factor."

<TEXT>
<P>
In case we were becoming complacent, 15 terrible seconds last week gave us all 
the proof we needed of nature's freakish and terrible willfulness. With TV 
images of the San Francisco earthquake burned into our minds by constant 
replay, a new exhibit at Newport Harbor Art Museum seems particularly timely. 
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, Pa., "American Landscape 
Video: The Electronic Grove" (through Dec. 31) presents six large-scale video 
installations produced during the past decade by Bill Viola, Rita Myers, Dara 
Birnbaum, Frank Gillette, Doug Hall and Steina Vasulka. 
</P>
<P>
Their landscape imagery ranges from the grandiloquent turbulence and shock 
effects of Hall's "The Terrible Uncertainty of the Thing Described" to the 
cerebral calm of Gillette's "Aransas." 
</P>
<P>
Hall offers large-screen images of raging fire, billowing smoke and torrential 
floods -- and a real jolt of lightning that leaps between two tall metal chairs 
screened off by a wire fence in the gallery. Gillette surrounds the viewer with 
monitors displaying peaceful distant and close-up views of the woods and 
marshes of Aransas County, Tex., in a slow, rhythmic sequence. 
</P>
<P>
For some viewers, the idea of a video "portrait" of landscape may be hard to 
reconcile with the familiar, handcrafted qualities of landscape painting, or 
even with a stationary photographic image. 
</P>
<P>
But the landscape tradition in American art already has undergone great changes 
during the past century. Think of the distance that separates the vast, 
detailed 19th-Century paintings of sprawling, untamed nature from the abstract 
color fields of Richard Diebenkorn's "Ocean Park" series -- or from the Earth 
Art of Robert Smithson, who worked directly on remote tracts of land. 
</P>
<P>
By turning to video, artists gained a number of advantages lost to cutting-edge 
art since the 19th Century, as well as others perhaps undreamed of by earlier 
generations. Video can transmit instantly recognizable moving pictures of real 
objects. It also offers the intimacy and the user-friendly, non-elitist quality 
of TV viewing. 
</P>
<P>
The artists, of course, are not in thrall to Nielsen ratings and other 
manifestations of consumer culture. They are free to use the special features 
of the video medium (including the ability to fragment, rearrange and instantly 
replay footage) to present unusual, unsettling and difficult ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Video installations typically consist of one or more video monitors that either 
create an "environment" all by themselves -- by virtue of the way they are 
arranged in the gallery -- or function as elements within a larger sculptural 
or architectural setting. This three-dimensional context may either 
counterpoint or reinforce the image on the video screen, giving the viewer 
another layer of visual (and sometimes aural) experience. 
</P>
<P>
Viola's "Room for St. John of the Cross," from 1983, is a particularly 
evocative blending of video with other media -- and a superb example of the 
power of video to convey serious, humanistic ideas as well as flashy, 
nihilistic ones. 
</P>
<P>
St. John of the Cross was a 16th-Century Spanish monk, a poet and mystic 
imprisoned by the religious establishment after introducing a new austerity 
into the Carmelite order. 
</P>
<P>
In a darkened gallery, Viola places an imagined replica of St. John's tiny cell 
with its thick walls and earthen floor. A small table inside holds a glass and 
pitcher of water -- and a miniature portable TV displaying the image of a 
snow-capped mountain peak. 
</P>
<P>
In Spanish, a recorded male voice softly recites St. John's intensely spiritual 
poetry, which speaks of flying over city walls and mountains to join with God. 
On a huge video screen outside the cell, the same mountain peak lurches and 
trembles in black-and-white, as if laboriously photographed, bit by bit, with a 
hand-held camera. 
</P>
<P>
In this work, the small, unchanging view of the mountain is symbolic of St. 
John's contemplative state, a serene and focused view of the true purpose of 
life. The jerky large view of the mountain seems to represent the confused, 
distracted, partial understanding we have of life as we rush through it, 
oblivious to higher things. 
</P>
<P>
Due to scheduling conflicts, Mary Lucier, one of the video artists in the 
original exhibition, is not represented at Newport Harbor, and Myers' video, 
"RiftRise" from 1986 replaces her "Allure of the Concentric" (which, however, 
will be seen at the Art Gallery, Cal State Fullerton, from Nov. 18 through Dec. 
17). 
</P>
<P>
In "RiftRise," images of destruction (fire, charred tree branches) and renewal 
(rushing water, green leaves) shift from one side to the other of two opposing 
banks of monitors, one made of sharp-edged black slabs, the other covered with 
live birch trees. At once very simple and very grand in scope, the installation 
offers a rhythmic, five-minute meditation on the cycle of life. 
</P>
<P>
Vasulka's "The West" from 1983 is the most visually complex piece in the show, 
though ultimately it seems to have less meaning than the others. Images of 
man-made and natural sights from the New Mexican desert play over 22 
double-stacked monitors for 30 minutes, unrolling and twisting and undergoing 
all sorts of coloristic and light manipulations. The whole thing seems to be 
more about technical wizardry, however, than the intrinsic qualities of nature. 
</P>
<P>
Dara Birnbaum's "Will-o'-the-Wisp" (part of her "Damnation of Faust" series, 
begun in 1983) is the most elusive of the six works. Three color monitors are 
mounted on a 36-foot-wide photographic enlargement that can just barely be read 
as a woman's face. The same face appears in the video imagery, surrounded by 
green foliage. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the foliage turns red (Memories of other times? A look into the 
future?) and there are quick glimpses of children gathered at a doorway. 
Meanwhile, the woman's voice murmurs inaudibly on the sound track (she is 
supposedly the fictional Marguerite of the Faust legend, recounting her 
abandonment by her lover). 
</P>
<P>
The piece -- which, to be fair, was partly malfunctioning when I saw it -- 
might be about the way the environment colors memory and affects mood. But the 
clues were vague and the image of the woman's face banal. (It looks like 
something from a toilet tissue commercial.) 
</P>
<P>
Still, the installations as a group are enormously captivating, offering a 
meaty introduction to the powers and fancies of video. It would have been a 
good idea to post the duration of each piece, however, so viewers could 
determine if they've seen the whole thing or are simply wallowing in an endless 
loop of imagery. 
</P>

SPASSOV LEADS GARDEN GROVE SYMPHONY IN 3 BULGARIAN WORKS, ONE HIS

<P>
"When East Meets West" was how the program was touted at Don Wash Auditorium 
Saturday night. If it was not love at first sight and sound, at least a genuine 
respect emerged from the musical proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Imported from Bulgaria via an exchange program, Ivan Spassov led two of his 
countrymen's works with the Garden Grove Symphony in their U.S. premieres, plus 
the first U.S. performance as well of his own Cello Concerto. As a composer, 
the music director of the Pazardzhik Philharmonic proved moderately 
interesting; as a conductor, there was a surprise in store. 
</P>
<P>
No virtuoso vehicle for soloist Vicki Anglin, Spassov's 1984 concerto broods 
and groans not unlike Shostakovich in the beginning, and leaves its questions 
unanswered a la Ives at the close. 
</P>
<P>
But the bulk of both of its movements revolve around aleatoric techniques. 
These chance events in the more compelling "Passacaglia" feature each of the 
first-chair strings with the solo cello, culminating in a magical re-entry of 
the full orchestra with the improvisational elements still in place. 
</P>
<P>
The concluding "Rustico" argues an angrier rhetoric less persuasively; 
undaunted by the arsenal of avant-garde techniques, Anglin provided poignant 
artistry in the hushed and ambiguous conclusion. The large audience showed 
muted enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
The other imported fare garnered scarcely greater responses; pleasantly 
accessible, neither work set the blood racing. 
</P>
<P>
Petko Stainov's "Rachenitza" (1926), a folk dance in 7/8 meter, relies solely 
on that quirky rhythm for its charms. Despite the secure and brisk playing 
Spassov elicited, the metrical device quickly wore out its welcome. 
</P>
<P>
And the contemporaneous "Bulgarian Rhapsody" of Pancho Vladiguerov simply 
alternates a lushly scored folk tune with wind writing of some sparkle, but 
ultimately lacking fire. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise then, came none too soon: Musically, at least, Spassov's heart 
lies with Mozart, not his compatriots. The Divertimento in F, K. 138, revealed 
the wide array of expressive techniques Spassov commands, as well as a keen ear 
for inner balances. 
</P>
<P>
With orchestra and audience now fully warmed up, music director Edward Peterson 
provided a sensuous and robust reading of Borodin's "Polovtsian Dances" and a 
ripely scored arrangement of a Bulgarian folk song as an encore. 
</P>
<P>
But Spassov had the last word -- and a spontaneous standing ovation -- with a 
rousing reading of "Stars and Stripes Forever."

RAPPING INTO SPOTLIGHT AT LAST FOR YOUNG MC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Always the bridesmaid, never the bride, Los Angeles rapper Young MC (nee Marvin 
Young) always seems to be in the wrong place at the right time. Or the right 
place at the wrong time. Or something. 
</P>
<P>
At the age when many rappers were busy acquiring the colorful police records 
they would later disavow in interviews, Young 
</P>
<P>
was an honors student (he is still clean cut in an age of gangster chic, his 
rhymes too clever by half). 
</P>
<P>
When Los Angeles rap was just starting to break big last year, Young told 
British music journals that he was moving back to New York. His album, 
originally scheduled as the first LP from Delicious Vinyl, was pushed back six 
months when the monster success of Tone-Loc's "Wild Thing" single -- for which 
Young wrote half the words -- caused Tone's album to be rushed into print 
instead. (This week Young has a Top 10 single and a Top 20 album of his own, 
but in the media he is still "Young 'Wild Thing' MC.") 
</P>
<P>
After a million gigs opening for everybody from Tone-Loc to Public Enemy, Young 
MC finally has landed a tour opening but kind of as a co-star -- for Boogie 
Down Productions, KRS-One's street-savvy hip-hop posse that philosophizes about 
everything from condoms to biblical history to the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
Young raps in a clear, smooth tenor; he enunciates complex rhymes cleanly as a 
scat singer. Where many rappers these days are content to hunch forward and let 
their dancers put on the show, Young's swinging performance is closer to Smokey 
Robinson's than to Kool Moe Dee's -- he knows he is an entertainer, not a guy 
at a poetry reading. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Friday night, the Boogie Down/Young tour stopped at the Celebrity 
Theatre in Anaheim. Wrong place. The Celebrity can be a brutal venue: No 
rapper, not even Public Enemy or N.W.A, has ever survived the harsh sound 
system or the rotating stage. And, the crowd was clearly KRS-One's, there to be 
enlightened more than entertained. 
</P>
<P>
KRS-One, though politically progressive, has never been the subtlest of 
performers live; at times it seems he is bellowing along with his records like 
a drunk at a frat party, while an on-stage cameraman dogs his every move. 
</P>
<P>
He dresses his rapper wife, Ms. Melodie, in sequins, and tosses records into 
the audience to keep its interest during her solo number. (His sister-in-law 
Harmony croons, um, harmony where other posses use old Lyn Collins samples.) By 
the seventh or eighth time he has shouted the old formula, "Throw your hands in 
the 
</P>
<P>
air/And wave them like you just don't care," you might be of a mind to 
disregard the moral of his hit "Stop the Violence" and rush the stage with 
malice aforethought. 
</P>
<P>
But Boogie Down Productions' spare, bouncy beats, almost as sprightly as 
aerobics-studio funk with a harder edge, are among the most danceable in 
hip-hop; the anti-violence rhymes, while simplistic, are sincere. 
</P>
<P>
KRS-One comes across as a likable B-boy everyman, albeit one with a 
subscription to the New York Times, more concerned with setting a positive 
example than with earning a gold record (though he has two). He might be an old 
person's idea of what a young person should be, but at least his heart is in 
the right place.

SAN FRANCISCO BALLET MAKES A STRONG FINISH IN COSTA MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Francisco Ballet closed its run at the Orange County Performing Arts Center 
in Costa Mesa over the weekend with a program that made a surprising point. The 
further away it got from classical vocabulary, the better it looked. 
</P>
<P>
In ascending order of impact, the company offered artistic director Helgi 
Tomasson's new "Handel -- A Celebration"; the athletic follies and competitions 
of Jerome Robbins' "Interplay" (1945), and the hyperkinetic Expressionism of 
Jiri Kylian's "Forgotten Land" (1981). 
</P>
<P>
The ghost of Balanchine hovered over Tomasson's 10-part, neoclassical homage to 
Handel (to a compiled score) but the results, though never in bad taste, proved 
uninspired and unmusical. 
</P>
<P>
Tomasson tended to rely upon rote symmetrical groupings, occasionally skewering 
formal patterns and classical vocabulary, though often apparently, arbitrarily 
</P>
<P>
so. Two pas de deux dropped the neoclassic look altogether and boldly ventured 
into romantic idioms. 
</P>
<P>
He also occasionally dug from the cliche pile -- such as juxtaposing a lyric 
and a hectic pas de deux to the same music. But the primary problem was the 
threadbare, poverty of movement. You waited for the choreography to fill out 
the music, but it never happened. 
</P>
<P>
Some choices were unfortunate. He cast the superb, Kirov-trained Ludmila 
Lopukhova against type, requiring her to execute speedy, slinky-distorted moves 
a la Balanchine. Though fully capably of fast dancing, Lopukhova, on Friday and 
at the Saturday matinee, only looked badly utilized and was further subjected 
to the indignity of being turned head over feet in the air by the corps of 
eight men. 
</P>
<P>
Making a cautious first appearance with the company at the Saturday matinee was 
Yuri Zhukov, the Kirov corps member who joined the San Franciscans for a 
nine-month guest stint right after the Leningrad-based company danced in Orange 
County in August. 
</P>
<P>
Zhukov seemed distant, uninvolved. He had a bad landing in his otherwise secure 
variation and partnered a vivid, sweet Sabina Allemann with patrician 
restraint. But at least he didn't smugly court the audience as did his Friday 
counterpart, Anthony Randazzo. 
</P>
<P>
The company looked better in Robbins' high-spirited "Interplay" (set to Morton 
Gould's "American Concertette"). Christopher Stowell excelled with airy 
lightness -- holding shapes in the air, bounding from textbook correct position 
and tossing off the step-over, hopping turns with virtuosic security. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, a good-natured David Justin at the matinee seemed underpowered and 
overly careful in his preparations. But he also made some fine airy corkscrew 
turns and clean landings. 
</P>
<P>
A coolish Elizabeth Loscavio and a supportive Alexi Zubiria danced the pas de 
deux on Friday; a secure Grace Maduell and an overtaxed Barton Parker II on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Both casts in "Forgotten Land" (to Britten's Sinfonia da Requiem) brought 
riveting commitment and energy to Kylian's abstract, whirlwind depiction of 
communal calamity, grief and transcendence. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Cisneros showed slashing power and nonstop dramatic momentum Friday in 
the first pas de deux; Jamie Zimmerman, with her limpid port de bras, evoked 
more poignancy Saturday. Each was partnered by the noble, technically strong 
Lawrence Pech. 
</P>
<P>
Jo Ellen Arntz and Andre Reyes were the shot-from-guns duo in the demonic 
Scherzo on Friday; Joanna Berman and Stowell took over the roles with equal 
power on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
A radiant Alaina Albertson was partnered by Randazzo (Friday) and Edward 
Ellison (Saturday). Both men proved strong. 
</P>
<P>
Denis de Coteau conducted a sometimes ragged Pacific Symphony with deep 
sympathy for Britten's score and few insights into Handel's music. Roy Bogas 
was the expert piano soloist in Gould's "American Concertette."

BAY AREA CREEPS TO WORK AT A BUMPER-TO-BUMPER PACE; 
</P>
<P>
GALES, WILD WAVES, RAIN -- MISERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Their misery compounded by soaking rain and bone-chilling winds, hundreds of 
thousands of Bay Area commuters struggled to work aboard the remaining links of 
the earthquake-ravaged transportation system today. Conditions across the area 
were crowded and chaotic, but mass gridlock was avoided. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got gale winds, heavy rains and heavy traffic -- your basic nightmare 
conditions," said California Highway Patrol Officer John Lash. "Somebody up 
there doesn't like us." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Selby, a spokesman for the Golden Gate Bridge District, said officials 
there were "absolutely amazed that things are going so smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
"People are turning to mass transit, he said. "Our buses and ferries are 
running at double and triple the normal level." 
</P>
<P>
But "smoothly" was still only relative. Neophyte riders of the Bay Area Rapid 
Transit District subway were drenched while waiting for cars that carried them, 
sardine-like, from the East Bay to San Francisco. An armada of ferryboats 
braved squalls and rough seas to deliver their seasick passengers to San 
Francisco piers. To the south near the epicenter of Tuesday's quake, Santa Cruz 
County travelers made their way to work on Highway 17 thanks to a fleet of CHP 
escorts. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, meanwhile, the White House announced that President Bush will 
seek $2.5 billion in new federal aid for earthquake victims -- a figure well 
below that sought by congressional Democrats who were working on a relief 
package. Estimates of the actual cost of damages continued to mount, exceeding 
$6.6 billion at last count. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco coroner added two more victims to the list of confirmed dead, 
bringing that tally to 61. Another 52 people were officially missing and 
believed trapped in the yet-uncleared wreckage of the Nimitz Freeway in 
Oakland. Officials in Santa Cruz also launched a search for a man believed to 
have been trapped in a landslide on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Bay Area workers, returning en masse to work for the first time since Tuesday's 
6.9 temblor, were forced onto BART trains, ferries and roundabout freeways 
because of the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay 
Bridge. Authorities were also forced to close I-280 and San Francisco's 
Embarcadero Freeway because of threatening cracks. 
</P>
<P>
By 10:30 a.m., BART had carried 99,732 passengers, compared to an average of 
69,638 on a normal weekday. Two passengers fainted after getting off trains at 
the Embarcadero Station after crossing the bay. 
</P>
<P>
"They were hyperventilating, I guess from being nervous in the tube," said 
Debby Tudor, a Westinghouse Elevator technician dispatched to tend to the 
station's escalators. 
</P>
<P>
But traffic from the northern suburbs over the Golden Gate Bridge was fast and 
smooth. And the morning commute on Highway 101 from the southern suburbs began 
light -- but then the freeway flooded. 
</P>
<P>
"Mother Nature is having a field day with us," commuter Joyce Bustinduy said. 
</P>
<P>
At sea, it was even rougher. Hundreds of commuters -- many afraid of traveling 
in the under-bay BART tube -- sought to make their way to work aboard ferries, 
but found the boats crowded and the seas wild.

IRAN AGAIN DANGLES OFFER ON HOSTAGES

President Hashemi Rafsanjani today offered to help gain freedom for 18 Western 
hostages in Lebanon if Washington releases frozen Iranian assets or helps 
resolve the cases of three kidnaped Iranians. 
</P>
<P>
He appeared to refer to Iranians kidnaped by the Lebanese Forces militia in 
north Lebanon in 1982, along with their Lebanese driver, a Shiite Muslim. All 
four are believed dead. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a news conference attended by mostly foreign reporters, Rafsanjani 
also ruled out any participation by U.S. corporations in Iran's post-war 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think American companies can play any role in Iran," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani spoke in a soft voice, smiling frequently as he played with a string 
of worry beads. 
</P>
<P>
"If the conditions are right, we might be able to do something" about the 
abducted Westerners, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not the first time that Iran has linked its help in releasing Western 
hostages to the unfreezing of the assets or the release of the kidnaped 
Iranians. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, "Our position 
has not changed. We do not link the Iranian assets to the hostages, and we do 
not make deals for hostages." 
</P>
<P>
As for Iran's influence over the hostages, Fitzwater said, "We have always said 
we believe that they have an influence on the hostages, that they have 
considerable knowledge, but we can't gauge how specific that is." 
</P>
<P>
He said the United States has provided Iran with all the information it has on 
Iranians kidnaped in Lebanon.

Former White House Chief of Staff Donald T. Regan, renewing his feud with Nancy 
Reagan, said today the former First Lady "has no gratitude for anyone." 
</P>
<P>
"I think she takes too much pity on herself," Regan said on NBC's "Today" show 
about Nancy Reagan's new book, "My Turn." In the book, she is critical of a 
number of her husband's associates. 
</P>
<P>
Regan also said things that the former First Lady wrote about Raisa Gorbachev 
might have gone better unsaid. "All this bashing of the president of the Soviet 
Union's wife isn't going to help Soviet-American relationships," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Regan was fired as Reagan's chief of staff after Nancy Reagan lobbied her 
husband to dump him, and the two have since traded barbs. 
</P>
<P>
"She doesn't seem to realize what's been going on during those eight years," 
Regan said. "She has no gratitude to anyone. In yesterday's Los Angeles Times, 
they had a full spread on this book, and in it they showed 20 people, all of 
whom Nancy Reagan criticizes."

A series of explosions tore through a Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics plant 
today, showering debris for miles around and sending up a fireball visible 15 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
An elementary school 1 1/2 miles from the plant evacuated 800 pupils, and the 
Houston Ship Channel was closed by the U.S. Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
Houston police on the scene were reporting several people hurt. A spokeswoman 
for Pasadena police said air ambulances were summoned and firefighters were 
dispatched. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion, which occurred about 1 p.m., was followed by at least two other 
blasts. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people lined up on nearby roads to view the yellow and green 
flames shooting from the plant. Joe Baccus said he felt the explosion at his 
business at least 15 miles away and could see the flames and smoke from the 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
Glen Dickey, who lives five miles from the plant, said he came home from lunch 
to find a six-foot piece of metal in a tree. "Pieces of stuff were falling out 
of the sky," he said.

Former President Richard M. Nixon is going to China to meet with government 
leaders late this month on a visit delayed because of the deadly crackdown on 
pro-democracy demonstrators last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's spokesman, John H. Taylor, said the former President's meetings with 
officials in Beijing will begin around Oct. 30. For security reasons, Taylor 
said, his precise travel plans were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said Nixon had discussed his plans with President Bush and with Brent 
Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser. "He will give his 
assessment of the leaders, their policies and Chinese-American relations in 
general in writing to President Bush upon his return," the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
The trip will be Nixon's sixth to China since, before resigning the presidency 
in disgrace, he reopened U.S. relations with mainland China in 1972. Taylor 
described it as "solely a fact-finding trip" with no sightseeing or social 
events. He said Nixon will be paying his own expenses and those of the one 
security aide who will travel with him.

Former President Ronald Reagan had lunch with Emperor Akihito today and 
received one of Japan's top honors -- the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of 
the Chrysanthemum -- for promoting free trade and friendship with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The award ceremony and luncheon at the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo was the 
first meeting between the two men since Akihito succeeded his father, the late 
Emperor Hirohito, in January and since Reagan retired to California. 
</P>
<P>
"I am humbled and deeply honored to have been awarded," said Reagan, who is 
earning $2 million in speaking fees during his visit. 
</P>
<P>
Akihito and Empress Michiko looked on as palace Grand Master of Ceremonies 
Kiyoshi Sumiya presented the award to Reagan, palace officials said. Nancy 
Reagan, Crown Prince Naruhito and Ambassador Michael Armacost also attended the 
ceremony and luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans last met the imperial couple in October, 1987, when they made an 
official visit to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan received the award from the Japanese government for promoting peace and 
friendship with Japan and for working to protect the free trade system during 
his eight years in office, officials said. The last and only other U.S. 
President to receive the honor was Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Reagan, who is in Japan at the invitation of Fujisankei 
Communications Group and the Japanese government, met with Prime Minister 
Toshiki Kaifu and attended a dinner held by Kaifu in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
At the dinner, Kaifu admired Reagan's popularity, noted the deepening of 
bilateral relations during his years in office and warmly congratulated Reagan 
on his award. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that over the years, every relationship has its ups and downs. Even 
among the best of friends, there are sometimes issues which need careful and 
candid evaluation," Reagan said, alluding to often rocky trade issues.

SOVIETS ADMIT RADAR STATION VIOLATED PACT

<P>
The Soviet Union acknowledged today that a radar station in Siberia violated a 
1972 superpower arms treaty and that the leadership had known this for some 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told the Soviet Parliament that the 
Kremlin had breached its own demands for strict adherence to the Anti-Ballistic 
Missile Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
The admission about the radar station at Krasnoyarsk, he said, was proof that 
the main plank of foreign policy was "not to conceal, (but) to acknowledge and 
to correct mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
"All these years we have been fighting for preservation of the ABM treaty as a 
basis for strategic stability," he said in an overview of foreign policy 
achievements. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet at the same time, the construction of this station equal in size to the 
Egyptian Pyramids constituted an open violation of ABM." 
</P>
<P>
The United States had argued that some of the systems at Krasnoyarsk violated 
the treaty and had demanded that it be dismantled before a treaty on strategic 
weapons could be concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union halted construction in October, 1988, and initially offered to 
turn the station into a space research center before agreeing to dismantle its 
disputed sections. 
</P>
<P>
American and Soviet officials held several rounds of talks on the installations 
until late last year, when the State Department announced that Moscow had 
agreed to destroy those systems Washington had considered violated the accord. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said the Soviet leadership had taken four years to "sort out 
matters with this station."

Condemnation of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher today overwhelmed the 
Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting with one black leader calling 
Britain's rebuttal of their declaration on South Africa "despicable'. 
</P>
<P>
One leader after another blasted an unrepentant Thatcher for her statement 
attacking sanctions as the most effective way to force an end to apartheid in 
South Africa, contrary to the official joint declaration supporting even 
stronger measures. 
</P>
<P>
"It was despicable and unacceptable," Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe said. 
</P>
<P>
A bitter Mugabe accused Thatcher of "deliberately telling the blacks in South 
Africa that Britain is a supporter of apartheid and a friend of the apostles of 
apartheid" in order to safeguard Britain's economic interests. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Thatcher's contention that poor blacks suffer the most from 
sanctions, Mugabe asked, "Isn't discrimination across the board suffering?" 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot let this incident pass," Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke said. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine my surprise to find Great Britain put out a separate statement" after 
the delegates' joint communique, he said. "This isn't the way business should 
be done." 
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented move, Thatcher issued her own statement Sunday night 
explaining why she refused to go along with the 46 former British colonies 
endorsing intensified economic sanctions against South Africa to force an end 
to apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth leaders criticized Thatcher's independent action. 
</P>
<P>
"When you sign a document at 5 p.m. you don't repudiate it at 6," Canadian 
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said. 
</P>
<P>
"The price of membership to an organization is loyalty and fairness to one 
another. Britain's behavior was extremely strange," Mulroney said. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher said she was "utterly astonished and utterly appalled" by the clamor 
over her statement. She lashed out at delegates suggesting that Britain had no 
right to comment on a document containing four provisions she disagreed with. 
</P>
<P>
Since the sections Thatcher refused to endorse were clearly indicated, Jamaica 
Prime Minister Michael Manley said he thought that Thatcher's decision was 
"most unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
"All of the leaders gathered and gave their support," Manley said. "The British 
were a part of that decision-making process."

JAPANESE ASSAIL MOVES TO BAN FISHING BY DRIFT NETS

<P>
Japanese fishermen today criticized international moves to ban drift-net 
fishing, which conservationists say threatens to wipe out much of the world's 
tuna stocks in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
The Japan Fisheries Assn. called the move to stop drift-net fishing in 
international waters "an arbitrary attempt . . . without scientific knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
"It is really unfortunate for human beings to be swayed by emotional 
discussions," it said. 
</P>
<P>
In drift net or "wall of death" fishing, Japanese and Taiwan fleets lay 
curtain-like nets up to three miles long that trap almost everything in their 
path. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists say the drift nets catch so much tuna that stocks could be 
depleted within a few years. They also catch and kill thousands of dolphins, 
seals, baby whales and sea birds every year. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been doing that for a long time," said Hajime Nishimura, an acting 
director of the association. "We fishermen are not trying to exhaust marine 
resources. We think in the long term," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Japan said it would cut the number of its drift-net vessels 
in the South Pacific next season by two-thirds, or down to 20. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we need to conduct scientific research to collect enough data to decide 
what impact drift-net fishing has on the environment. Then we can decide what 
to do," Nishimura said.

Troubles continued for Australia's Qintex Australia Ltd. as its stock lost half 
its value and the Australian Stock Exchange suspended trading in the shares 
today following the bankruptcy filing of its U.S. affiliate Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The unwillingness of television tycoon Christopher Skase, head of Qintex, to 
reveal his company's exposure to the U.S. unit, Qintex Entertainment, led the 
Australian Stock Exchange to suspend trading in Qintex's Australian stock. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex Australian shares plunged to 16 cents, valuing the company at only $21 
million, after closing Friday at 33 cents. The suspension came after the close 
of business. 
</P>
<P>
"Share prices normally tell you something," said one longtime Qintex Australia 
supporter at a brokerage firm who did not wish to be identified. "I'm not as 
happy about the company now as I was before."

<P>
Prime Computer Inc. today said it will lay off 2,500 employees, or about 20% of 
its work force, due to a restructuring of the company into four units. 
</P>
<P>
Prime was acquired in August for about $1.13 billion by New York investment 
firm J. H. Whitney &amp; Co. after a protracted, nine-month battle for control 
of the Natick-based computer maker. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Prime said the layoffs will occur mostly in the United States. 
Half of the U.S. layoffs, whose number was not specified, will be in 
Massachusetts, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Prime said it will be reorganized into four profit centers: the computervision 
business unit, the minicomputer business unit, the customer support business 
unit and the international business unit. 
</P>
<P>
Prime posted a net loss of $18.9 million in the second quarter, compared with a 
$76.2 million profit in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin, Calif.-based MAI Basic Four Inc. launched a hostile bid for Prime last 
November and the long battle cut into Prime's earnings, sapped customer 
confidence and drove off some valued employees.

Tommy Helms said the Cincinnati Reds management has passed him by in the search 
for a manager and is identifying him as a candidate only as a courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that the Reds already have decided on Dallas Green as the 
new manager. 
</P>
<P>
Helms, a Reds coach since October, 1982, finished the 1989 season as interim 
manager after Pete Rose was banned from baseball amid gambling allegations. But 
Helms, in an interview published today, said he has been all but ignored in the 
search for a new manager. 
</P>
<P>
Green, a former New York Yankees manager, said Sunday he will decide by the end 
of the month whether he wants the job. General Manager Bob Quinn, who met 
Friday with Green in Philadelphia, is telling reporters that the job has not 
been offered to anybody. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he thought he had been treated fairly during the search, the 
48-year-old Helms said, "No, not whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
"They called in all my coaches and told them that if they could find a better 
deal to go ahead and take it," he told the Cincinnati Post. "But they didn't 
call me in. No one told me I was fired, rehired or anything." 
</P>
<P>
"Dallas is the man. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. It's obvious. . . . 
He's been the guy for about 30 days," Helms said. "Is the call I'm going to get 
a courtesy call or what? 
</P>
<P>
"Sure I'm angry. I know what's going on. I was born at night, but not last 
night." 
</P>
<P>
Quinn said last week that he plans to interview Helms on Tuesday. But Helms 
said he had not been given a definite date or time for the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn and Reds owner Marge Schott did not return telephone calls today. 
</P>
<P>
"I read all this stuff in the papers, but no one has tried to talk to me," 
Helms said. "I have nothing against Dallas Green. I've known him a long time, 
and he's a good baseball man. But the thing that gets me is I keep hearing 
about all this loyalty stuff. Well, who's more loyal than me? I'm probably the 
most loyal person the Reds could even think about, plus I know the team." 
</P>
<P>
The Reds were 14-21 under Helms. But he instilled a sense of discipline in the 
clubhouse, and several Reds players voiced support for him at the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"My record may not have been great, but I wouldn't change a thing I did. I did 
the best I could do. I just didn't have the bullets," Helms said. 
</P>
<P>
"If this goes on like this, I'll still be a fan of the Reds' players. I'll 
always be that," he said. "But I won't be a fan of the Reds' management. 
They've laid me out to dry.

Undefeated Virgil Hill, recovered from a bout with hyperglycemia, will make the 
seventh defense of his World Boxing Assn. light heavyweight title Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Hill (25-0) will meet James Kinchen (44-6-2) in a scheduled 12-round bout at 
the Bismarck Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
The fight was to have been held in August but was postponed when the champion 
was determined to have hyperglycemia -- abnormally high amounts of sugar in the 
blood -- that Hill blamed on a poor diet and stress. 
</P>
<P>
Proper diet has brought the problem under control, Hill said, and he is back in 
top form. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, who won the title from Leslie Stewart in September, 1987, said the 
five-month layoff since May 27 when he stopped Joe Lasisi in the seventh round 
should help him. 
</P>
<P>
"The layoff was better for me because I've been so consistent in my fighting," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kinchen, 31, is best known for a controversial loss to Thomas Hearns on Nov. 4, 
1988. It is his first shot at a major world title in a nine-year career in 
which he has fought as a middleweight, super-middleweight and light 
heavyweight. 
</P>
<P>
"This fight is as important to me as all the others," Kinchen, who will be at a 
seven-inch reach disadvantage, said. "Virgil is quick, but so am I. So we're 
just going to have to do some things to slow Virgil down a little."

Successive victories over Oklahoma and Arkansas have persuaded voters that 
Texas belongs among the Top 25. Two successive losses also convinced them that 
Air Force does not. 
</P>
<P>
After a weekend of upsets, those are among the most dramatic changes in the 
Associated Press college football poll. 
</P>
<P>
The Longhorns, who shocked Oklahoma two weeks ago, did the same to then-No. 7 
Arkansas on Saturday by a 24-20 score to move into the ranked teams for the 
first time this season at No. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson was the other new face in the Top 25 this week, moving back in after a 
week's absence at No. 22 following a 30-10 whipping of previously undefeated 
No. 12 North Carolina State. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Air Force lost for the second straight week, 27-9 to Texas 
Christian, to drop to 6-2 for the season and out of the Top 25. The Falcons, 
No. 19 last week, had won their first six games before losing to Notre Dame 
41-27 and to TCU. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma, No. 25 last week, also dropped out although the Sooners beat Iowa 
State 43-40. 
</P>
<P>
There were plenty of other shake-ups in the Top 25 although Nos. 1 through 5, 
led by Notre Dame, remained intact in the weekly voting by the nation's 
sportswriters and broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish, who have held the top spot since winning the Kickoff 
Classic in August, won their seventh game of the season and 19th in a row 
overall with a 28-24 victory over USC. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish garnered 56 of the 60 first-place votes and 1,496 points overall. 
Miami, idle last week, held the No. 2 spot with 1,424 points, including three 
first-place votes. Colorado, a 49-17 winner over Kansas, was again No. 3 with 
1,379 points, including one vote for first. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska, which beat Oklahoma State 48-23, remained fourth, followed again by 
No. 5 Michigan, a 26-12 winner over Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the Top 10 includes No. 6 Alabama, No. 7 Pitt, No. 8 Illinois, 
No. 9 Florida State and No. 10 USC. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama moved up four spots with a 47-30 victory over previously unbeaten 
Tennessee, which was No. 6 last week. Pitt moved up one spot after an idle 
weekend, and Illinois jumped five places after a 14-10 victory over Michigan 
State. Florida State moved up five after taking a 22-14 decision over Auburn, 
No. 11 last week. And USC dropped one spot after its loss to Notre Dame at 
South Bend. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the Top 25 includes No. 11 Tennessee, No. 12 Houston, No. 13 
Arkansas, No. 14 Penn State, No. 15 West Virginia, No. 16 Auburn, No. 17 
Arizona, No. 18 Brigham Young, No. 19 Florida, No. 20 North Carolina State, No. 
21 Texas A &amp; M, No. 22 Clemson, No. 23 Washington State, No. 24 Texas and 
No. 25 South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's 11-25 lineup included Auburn, North Carolina State, Illinois, 
Florida State, Washington State, Houston, Penn State, West Virginia, Air Force, 
Florida, Brigham Young, Arizona, Texas A&amp;M, South Carolina and Oklahoma.
