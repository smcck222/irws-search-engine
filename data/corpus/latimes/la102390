STATE'S ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Can State No Longer Compete?" front page, Oct. 7: 
</P>
<P>
Your article begins, "A soy sauce maker quits Los Angeles County and opens up 
shop in Nevada. A Glendale fiber company shutters a 40-year-old factory and 
heads for Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County auto parts firms plans it future over the border in Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
Wonderful! We need to thin out the population in Southern California. The idea 
that we must continue to expand, come hell or high water, will destroy us. The 
fact that some small and large businesses move out of the state is not the 
harbinger of doom for the state's economy. People will continue to come to the 
Southland in droves, and people will go into business to serve them. 
</P>
<P>
The problems arise from the need to provide the services and infrastructure to 
serve those who are here and those who are to come. That is going to cost 
money, and we cannot continue to amass bonded debt in this state without 
increasing taxes to "pay as we go" and try to retire the debt. Stop! Tax and 
spend, don't borrow and spend.

PRAGER ON ISRAELI-ARAB CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What the Arab-American community had feared the Persian Gulf crisis would 
precipitate -- anti-Arab racism -- has ominously begun to emerge in the Op-Ed 
pages of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Prager's article represents the type of anti-Arab racism that the community had 
hoped could be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
To lump together all Arabs and Muslims, of which there are almost 1 billion 
Muslims and of which Arabs comprise maybe one-quarter of that figure, is racism 
in its most invidious form. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, to claim that Arabs and Muslims hate democracy is absurd and 
fallacious. Muslim Pakistan had a democratically elected woman prime minister. 
The Arabs, on the other hand, have never had the opportunity to develop 
democratic traditions. Every single state in the Middle East, including Israel, 
is the product of French, British and American imperialism over the last two 
centuries. 
</P>
<P>
What is ironic is that Prager advocates that the U.S. and the international 
community undertake a military effort to obviate the threat posed by Saddam 
Hussein. The irony is that this military intervention is precisely the same 
technique that fomented the present circumstances he condemns: Western 
militarily imposed undemocratic governments which perpetuate the anti-Western 
feelings among the Arab people. 
</P>
<P>
The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee believes that the United 
Nations should be allowed to resolve the conflicts in the Middle East, not U.S. 
military forces. The ADC endorses an international peace conference under the 
aegis of the United Nations.

FOR STATE TREASURER: BROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This year California voters are fortunate to have a choice between two major 
candidates for state treasurer who are both well-qualified. Treasurer Tom 
Hayes, a Republican, and Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown are financial 
experts with solid records of public service. Voters would be well-served by 
either, but we recommend Brown. 
</P>
<P>
The treasurer is California's chief financial officer. A key responsibility is 
managing the state's money, investing about $3 billion a year in revenues that 
state and local governments collect in an effort to make a maximum return 
before the funds are spent or disbursed. The treasurer also issues general 
obligation bonds and sits on the various boards that manage pension funds for 
state employes. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes was appointed to his post by Gov. George Deukmejian when then-Treasurer 
Jesse Unruh died in August, 1987. He is a bureaucrat who takes admirable pride 
in his work and has, by every account, served the state effectively, if 
quietly. Hayes points proudly to California's AAA bond rating and the 
consistently high yields the state earns on its investments. 
</P>
<P>
Brown comes from one of the state's best-known political families, but has 
tried not to run for the treasurer's job on that basis. She has served on Los 
Angeles' Board of Education and its public works board and made a career as a 
finance attorney in both California and New York. While she and Hayes quibble 
over who could do a better job investing state revenues or selling bonds, their 
key difference is how they define the treasurer's responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran government official that he is, Hayes sees the job in technical terms 
-- cautious and careful, taking no chances that might hurt the state 
financially. Brown would do the same, but be more assertive when the state 
could use its financial clout -- trying to persuade a major corporation in 
which state pension programs own stock, for example, to keep a factory in 
California. When Hayes objects that trying to affect policy is beyond a 
financial officer's duties, Brown replies that is why the treasurer's post is 
elected and not appointive. 
</P>
<P>
That's a persuasive argument on Brown's behalf. We recommend her to California 
voters.

PRAGER ON ISRAELI-ARAB CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prager is mistaken in his belief that Arabs hate Israel because it is 
democratic or embodies Western values. 
</P>
<P>
Arabs hate Israel for what it really is, a virulent, aggressive, colonial 
outpost of U.S.-supported cowboys using every brutal means at its disposal to 
oppress the indigenous Arab population. Even the U.S. wouldn't care if Israel 
was democratic or embodied Western values so long as Israel served our 
interests. Unfortunately, Prager's effort to gain the moral high ground for 
Israel is simply a rhetorical device to demonize Arabs among Americans.

HOW TO WIN WITHOUT A WAR; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: HUSSEIN CAN BE PERSUADED TO LEAVE KUWAIT, THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS 
THAT SETTLE IRAQ'S GRIEVANCES AND THE DEBT INCURRED BY ITS INVASION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER FISHER, Roger Fisher, a professor of law at Harvard University and 
director of the Harvard Negotiation Project, is co-author of Getting to YES: 
Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In (Penguin, 1983). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The gulf crisis poses a dilemma: Shall we back down, or shall we go to war? 
Either choice is awful. Fortunately, there is a third strategy open to us, for 
success without war. 
</P>
<P>
Backing down, allowing Iraq to seize Kuwait and profit from its oil, would set 
a terrible precedent. It would throw into question borders all over the world 
and invite strong countries to invade their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Nor should we agree that in exchange for exiting from part of Kuwait, Iraq can 
keep the rest. We should continue to insist that Iraq get no more than what it 
should have been able to obtain through peaceful negotiations, or to which it 
is entitled under international law. 
</P>
<P>
War could be disastrous. Militarily, we would be fighting a ruthless tyrant who 
could tolerate 100,000 fatalities better than we could tolerate 10,000. 
Thousands of civilians might die, the city of Kuwait might become rubble, and 
Saudi oil facilities would be destroyed. The price of oil might double or 
triple, sending the world economy into depression. 
</P>
<P>
Economically, costs of the war to America alone could make this year's deficit, 
collapsed stock market, bankrupt government programs and debate over taxes look 
like trivia. 
</P>
<P>
Politically, a war would almost certainly destroy the U.N. consensus on Iraq. 
At the outset, we could expect emergency sessions, complaints about a "trigger 
happy" President, and calls -- perhaps from France, China, Canada and the 
General Assembly -- for a cease-fire and negotiations. The President's 
promising new world order based on U.S.-Soviet cooperation and wide U.N. 
support would be shattered. 
</P>
<P>
Just how probable is this gloomy future, no one can say. But in the gulf today, 
even "winning" a war could have terrible consequences. 
</P>
<P>
We can, however, avoid the dilemma between backing down and going to war. We 
are already well-launched on a better strategy, which has the following 
elements: 
</P>
<P>
Clarity of purpose: "Iraq shall not benefit from its invasion." Our critical 
interest is not the date when the Emir of Kuwait is returned to office -- 
whether after three months or three years -- but rather that Iraq not profit 
from its aggression. And we can accomplish that without war. Every day that 
Iraq gets no benefit from Kuwaiti oil is a victory for the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Sanctions: Retain the oil embargo indefinitely. Since our true interest is to 
prevent successful aggression, all we have to do to win is to maintain 
indefinitely the blockade on the sale of Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil. To avoid a 
crisis, we should let food, medicine, and other necessities into Iraq. We 
should accept Saddam Hussein's suggestion that Iraqi oil come out onto the 
market, with the proceeds being put into a special escrow account to be 
released when the dispute is settled. All of us (except oil profiteers) would 
be better off with more oil on the market and billions of dollars building up 
in an escrow account that would provide an ever-increasing incentive for Iraq 
to withdraw from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Timing: Be patient. To keep our forces in Saudi Arabia fit and our allies 
supporting us may seem difficult today, but both would be far more difficult 
during a war. Once expectations are set for a long haul, we can consolidate the 
multi-national forces, air-condition the bases, pre-position heavy equipment, 
and start rotation and some reduction in military personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Objectives: Keep them limited. Every time we add a new goal, we make success 
less likely. There is no chance that Saddam Hussein is going to turn himself in 
for trial as a war criminal. So far as the sanctions are concerned, we should 
stick to our original objectives: Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and release of 
foreign nationals. Other objectives we can pursue later. 
</P>
<P>
Open a door: Give Hussein a way out. We cannot hope for him to withdraw from 
Kuwait if doing so would make him even worse off. Sanctions will influence 
Hussein to withdraw only if he is confident that upon withdrawal, sanctions 
will stop. Withdrawal is not encouraged by statements on our part that 
sanctions might continue in support of demands for compensation, war-crime 
trials and his overthrow. 
</P>
<P>
Be specific: Make Iraqi withdrawal look tolerable. We need a Security Council 
resolution making clear that upon withdrawal from Kuwait and the release of 
foreign nationals, specific things will happen, such as: a) sanctions stop; b) 
there will be no military attack against Iraq; c) an Arab mediator will seek an 
equitable settlement of the oil field and island issues; d) fair procedures 
will be used to settle all frozen-asset and financial claims; e) military 
restraints will be negotiated with Iraq, permitting multinational forces to 
withdraw from the gulf; f) Kuwait will announce its plans for becoming more 
democratic, and g) the Security Council's permanent members will turn to the 
Palestinian question. 
</P>
<P>
Each of these items is in our interest. None would set a bad precedent. The 
territorial matter, for instance, could be settled on the merits of both 
parties' claims, with no advantage accruing to Iraq for either its invasion or 
its withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate that sanctions are a U.N. effort, such a resolution is best 
drafted by one of our allies, such as Canada, France, Egypt or the Soviet 
Union.

By investing in human capital through child development and education we will, 
more than in any other way, shape California's future. 
</P>
<P>
It was an article of faith for generations of American parents and children 
that education was the prized vehicle of opportunity that promised to transport 
worthy sons and daughters of charwomen and Pullman porters past the bounds of 
artificial social-class lines to achieve their ambitions and full participation 
in the rewards of our society. 
</P>
<P>
For too many of our kids, education today falls far short of offering that 
bright promise or even the hope that they will be adequately prepared to 
compete and win in the global marketplace of the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that in California we can still make the changes necessary to 
restore credibility to education as the key to full opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
To overcome resistence from defenders of the status quo to the needed reforms 
will demand leadership and sustained effort of a strong, activist governor, one 
resolved to make the changes that will take California education from 
mediocrity to excellence. 
</P>
<P>
To achieve my vision of restoring excellence to education in California will 
require money, stimulating teaching by skilled and dedicated professionals and 
the active involvement of concerned parents and community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
* Healthy start -- I cannot urge too strongly the importance of child 
development, even before birth, rather than later treating a problem that could 
have been prevented. We must make prenatal care available to all pregnant 
California women. We should fund this wise and cost-effective expenditure by 
making it the highest-priority claim on the tobacco tax passed by the voters in 
1988. The money we spend up front will be more than recouped by avoiding the 
tremendous tax and even more important human costs of premature or 
developmentally impaired children. 
</P>
<P>
* Coordinated services -- We must provide early mental health counseling to 
ensure that every child comes to school in good mental health to be able to 
learn. 
</P>
<P>
As governor, I will establish in every county a children's service council to 
integrate the operation of local agencies and the schools to ensure that social 
and health services reach the kids. These are existing services, such as mental 
health counseling, health assessment and nutrition, for which we now pay taxes. 
</P>
<P>
* Safe schools -- Teachers and students are entitled to safe classrooms. 
Students who bring weapons or drugs must be removed to permit learning by 
others. 
</P>
<P>
I have proposed much stronger penalties for selling illegal drugs to a minor. 
State laws fail to protect our kids from drug dealers near schools and parks. 
The sentence for such sales should be increased by 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
* Preschool -- We waste valuable educational time by waiting until a child is 5 
before starting school. I have proposed offering preschool education for every 
4-year-old who wants it. This would be expensive, but if phased in, the cost 
could be absorbed within the overall constitutional funding guarantee for 
education. 
</P>
<P>
* School accountability -- My agenda to improve the schools calls for 
fundamental reforms to make schools more accountable to parents and taxpayers: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Re-establish the connection between parents and schools; that is why I 
support parental choice alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Apply performance standards to teaching, as we do other professions; that 
is why I support merit pay. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Increase the linkages between schools and the community. That is why I will 
establish a volunteer mentor program to provide a caring adult in the life of 
every California child without one. 
</P>
<P>
 * Secretary of child development and services -- To help coordinate and 
implement this ambitious agenda, I have proposed the creation of a 
cabinet-level secretary of child development and services. 
</P>
<P>
* School construction -- We cannot hope to improve our learning environment 
unless we have both adequate new construction of school facilities and more 
efficient use of our existing resources. 
</P>
<P>
I will implement the state program to encourage greater use of year-round 
facilities. It is only common sense to fully utilize existing buildings before 
investing in new construction. But new construction is inevitable. I am pleased 
to have signed the ballot argument in support of Proposition 146, the state 
school bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
However, we cannot expect the burden to be shouldered fully by state government 
or by increasing fees on developers. We must allow local decision-making by 
school districts, who must be given the authority to pass new school 
construction bond issues with a simple majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
* School finance -- This year's budget process pointed out the need for 
broad-based budget reform. The governor must be the leader in setting budget 
priorities, and must have the tools to do this. Children and public safety are 
my top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the process of budget reform, I want to maintain healthy spending for 
education, perhaps even greater than the constitutional guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
My great-grandfather risked prison to teach young Irish peasants to read and 
write English in defiance of the king. We must be no less resolved to restore 
excellence to education, and to bring about a California of much longer 
graduation lines and much shorter unemployment lines.

The president of the California Trucking Assn. recently told me that the 
industry finds many high school graduates unable to fill out an employment 
application properly. Today, one out of three high school students in 
California drops out by the 10th grade. Our classrooms are among the most 
overcrowded in the country. And despite the fact that achievement-test scores 
have been improving, our students still perform below the national average. 
</P>
<P>
So what can we do? Let me summarize some of our proposals: 
</P>
<P>
* Early childhood education -- As I've traveled across California, I've asked 
education experts if there is one program that could reduce the high school 
dropout rate. To a person, they have responded, "early childhood education." 
Teachers often say that they can tell very early when a child is not going to 
make it. Quality education for 4-year-olds in classes small enough to allow the 
teacher to establish the routine and discipline of learning, as well as to give 
the youngster a "jump-start" on fundamentals, can make a dramatic difference 
later on. Studies show that a youngster is 40% more likely to graduate from 
high school and 60% more apt to get a job by age 19 with the benefit of early 
childhood education. 
</P>
<P>
I have proposed that early childhood education be offered throughout the state 
to every 4-year-old who needs it and wants it. 
</P>
<P>
I propose a twofold method of funding. First, I want to increase education's 
share of state lottery funds to 50% from 34%, earmarking the new dollars for 
early childhood education. I have also endorsed Proposition 133, the Safe 
Streets Act of 1990, which would provide $235 million to expand access to early 
childhood education. 
</P>
<P>
* California must set performance standards for students and make sure they 
meet them -- Let's end the practice of promoting and graduating youngsters who 
are failing. A school that promotes or graduates a youngster with Ds and Fs 
effectively condemns that youngster to failure. 
</P>
<P>
* Class-size reduction -- California class sizes are the second-largest in the 
nation. We can reduce them in two ways. First, by reducing the two-thirds vote 
required to pass local school bonds to a simple majority, which would allow us 
to build the schools we need. "One person, one vote" has always been the 
watchword of a democracy. Why should one-third-plus-one of the electorate be 
able to stop a community from building the schools it needs? 
</P>
<P>
We need to use available schools year-round. Although this often brings an 
initial adverse reaction from parents, "multitrack" programs are being used in 
many schools with great success. It is one of the less costly ways of reducing 
class size. 
</P>
<P>
Also, legislation is pending to set up two-year community college courses to 
train teaching assistants who could aid teachers and thereby help reduce the 
adverse impact of large classes. I would certainly sign this legislation as 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooperative work-force training programs -- A number of schools and businesses 
are experimenting with these programs. Students who participate agree to 
maintain a solid attendance record and meet certain goals. They are paid by 
participating businesses for part-time jobs during the school year and receive 
on-the-job training. Each student is also assigned a mentor from the 
participating business who works with the student. Students who do well in the 
program are guaranteed a job after graduation, or a scholarship to a college or 
technical-training program. 
</P>
<P>
By "adopting" a youngster every year for the past four years and by helping 
others through the establishment of a special program for at-risk youngsters in 
San Francisco, I have seen the tremendous impact individual attention can have 
on a young person's life. I have learned that often one person who cares can be 
a lifeline that makes all the difference to a youngster who has little or no 
home support. 
</P>
<P>
I would actively encourage businesses in every community in the state to adopt 
a school, providing equipment and mentors, and to develop a partnership with 
schools on a continuing basis. 
</P>
<P>
If elected, I will also ask the corporate community to contribute to a unique 
teachers' corps concept, whereby college graduates and retirees, for a small 
salary, might be willing to work in special pilot programs for at-risk young 
people. We must provide the attention necessary to deal with an increasingly 
multiethnic and multilingual school population. Motivation is a big part of it. 
</P>
<P>
* Providing financial support for education -- Unlike my opponent, I strongly 
support Proposition 98, which sets aside 40% of state general funds for public 
schools. It is as important to the well-being of the state as Proposition 13 
was to the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
* Support magnet schools -- Magnet schools that offer specialized courses -- an 
emphasis on the arts, on medical studies or on the sciences, for example -- 
should be encouraged as a way to offer parents and students greater choice. 
</P>
<P>
We all want our children to do better than we have. Education is the key to 
opportunity. It opens the door. It is the way up and the way out. It must be 
our state's No. 1 funding priority, and it must command the next governor's 
constant attention. If I am that governor, I would hope that after four years, 
every man, woman and child in this state would truly understand the importance 
and the value of an education, and be determined to see that our children have 
that opportunity.

U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens halted printing and distribution 
of ballots for the Nov. 6 elections in Cook County, saying the full court 
should hear a dispute over third-party candidates. The ballots did not have the 
names of candidates from the Harold Washington Party, named for the city's late 
black mayor and representing some blacks disenchanted with the Democratic 
Party. Stevens stayed an Illinois high court order that knocked the candidates 
off the ballot in the county, which includes Chicago and some suburbs.

<P>
A defendant in the Central Park jogger case disrupted the second rape and 
attempted murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
"No! No! No! I can't deal with this!" Kharey Wise, 18, cried out after 
Assistant Dist. Atty. Elizabeth Lederer's opening statement. Wise then vomited 
next to the defense table. As officers led him out of the courtroom, Wise 
screamed: "I can't take this! It isn't true! She's lying! She's lying!" Wise is 
one of two youths on trial in the gang rape and beating of a woman jogger in 
Manhattan's Central Park. Three others were convicted earlier of rape and 
assault but acquitted of attempted murder. The jury had left for a recess 
before the outburst.

Several suspects have been identified as responsible for a fire that swept 
through a San Jose State dormitory, critically injuring two students and 
sending 19 others to hospitals, officials said. "The suspects university police 
are looking at are all San Jose students," university spokesman Dick Stanley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley said the suspects in Friday's fire, whose names he did not release, are 
believed to have moved a couch in front of a dormitory room and ignited it. One 
student, unable to breathe because of the thick smoke that filled Andrew 
Moulder Hall, suffered a back fracture in a jump from a third-floor window. 
Other students trapped by the flames leaned out windows, screaming for help as 
firefighters set up ladders to rescue them. Rescuers led other students down 
stairways to safety. More than 30 firefighters put out the blaze at the hall, 
which houses 178 residents.

Santa Ana winds subsided, helping more than 750 firefighters gain the upper 
hand on a wildfire that burned 550 acres of valuable wildlife habitat in the 
San Bernardino National Forest, a U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze broke out Saturday in Lytle Creek Canyon, north of Fontana, and 
briefly threatened a subdivision under construction. Biologists said the fire 
posed an unusual threat to deer, bear and Nelson bighorn sheep in the area 
because the species' habitat was ravaged by two earlier fires. The cause of the 
blaze, which officials initially estimated had charred 1,200 acres, remains 
under investigation.

BACKERS OF 'BETTY,' THE CURIOUS, MEDIA GATHER FOR A SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They began showing up at 7:15 a.m., lining up in front of Department 27 on the 
fourth floor of the County Courthouse. The matter that got them out of bed and 
into the maw of Monday-morning rush hour was one they had waited for and read 
about for months: 
</P>
<P>
The People of the State of California vs. Elisabeth Broderick. 
</P>
<P>
It is, as one woman put it, "San Diego's most-celebrated murder trial in ages. 
I wasn't about to miss it." 
</P>
<P>
It drew the media -- the made-for-TV-movie people, the journalist writing a 
book, and Ladies' Home Journal, focusing on the "trauma" of a middle-aged 
woman. Representatives from tabloid TV shows "Hard Copy" and "Current Affair" 
are expected later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
It also drew dozens of women who said they identified with "Betty" and dozens 
more simply attracted to the theater of a prominent murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's behind-the-scenes action at the trial of Elisabeth (Betty) Broderick 
-- arrested on Nov. 5, 1989, and accused of murdering her ex-husband, Daniel T. 
Broderick, and his second wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick -- was described by 
many on the fourth floor as a "zoo." 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom of Judge Thomas J. Whelan seats 36 observers, eight of whom are 
reporters covering the trial. Several of the remaining were taken up by friends 
and relatives, leaving little room for the more than 100 onlookers who gathered 
outside in the hope of getting in. A TV monitor outside the courtroom gave them 
some idea of what was going on inside. 
</P>
<P>
After a morning recess and a lunchtime break, several were allowed to enter. 
The wait, they said, was worth it. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing faded jeans and black cowboy boots, a woman named Ellen was at the 
front of the line. She, like many of the middle-aged to elderly women who came 
to watch, said she was there "out of sympathy for Betty" and because she 
"identifies so strongly with what the woman went through." 
</P>
<P>
"This trial is a perfect illustration of how badly women are treated in 
divorce," Ellen said. "I, too, went through a bitter breakup and divorce. The 
man to whom I was married seems very similar to her husband. My ex-husband 
would call the police and have them come to my house, telling them I was 
abandoning our child, which wasn't true. He had bullies harass me. I can relate 
totally to what Betty went through." 
</P>
<P>
Betty, Ellen said, was like a refugee from a Tammy Wynette song. She "stood by 
her man," Ellen said, and all it got her was an extramarital "slap in the face" 
-- Daniel Broderick's relationship with his then-unmarried secretary, Linda 
Kolkena. In addition, Ellen said, "the woman lost her house, custody of her 
children" and a privileged place in society. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't seem to matter to many of those in attendance whether Elizabeth 
Broderick was, as Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells said, guided by "hate, revenge 
and murder" or that she had pulled the trigger on a man and woman who were, at 
the time they were killed, sound asleep in their own home, which she had 
entered illegally. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of us really believe he drove her to it," said Barbara Harbin, a 
resident of Chula Vista, who frequently attends celebrated trials. She listed 
the Sagon Penn and Craig Peyer trials as ones she had "very much enjoyed." 
</P>
<P>
Another woman, who asked not to be quoted by name, said she had been a legal 
secretary for 30 years, until she retired, and found murder trials "the best 
theater going." 
</P>
<P>
Iris Mann was first in line Monday morning. A student at Palomar College, she's 
attending the trial for credit in a criminal evidence class. She said she's 
fascinated with the goings-on. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm supposed to be like the jury and decide whether the sentence should be 
lenient or harsh," Mann said of her project. "Right now, I like the defense. I 
prefer a lenient sentence for Betty. I just don't think she poses a threat to 
society, which should be the criteria, right? She lost her mind -- not that it 
justifies what happened. . . . It doesn't justify taking away two lives. But 
life in prison for Betty? I think she should be allowed to come out and start a 
new life." 
</P>
<P>
Several in attendance, willing to be interviewed, were unwilling to be quoted 
by name. One woman, who attended the Oliver North "Contragate" trial, showed up 
at Department 27 well ahead of time and got a seat. (Several Broderick family 
members were turned down.) 
</P>
<P>
The woman said she makes it a practice to attend celebrated court proceedings 
around the country. She called the Oliver North trial "the best courtroom 
experience I've ever had, by far." 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"Because I believe in Ollie North," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She wore a bright blue cardigan, pinned with a small American flag. She said 
she first became a "courtroom watcher" in Honolulu and "just kept going after 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Asked her feeling about the Broderick trial, she looked startled and vaguely 
offended, and replied, "I have no feelings." She then walked away. 
</P>
<P>
Bella Stumbo, a longtime reporter for The Times who is on a leave of absence, 
said she is writing a book about the Broderick case. When asked what intrigued 
her about the story, Stumbo, who declined to be interviewed, answered: "All of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Another woman, who asked not to be quoted by name, said she works for the 
production company that is working with CBS to complete a made-for-TV movie 
about the case. She, too, declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Neumeyer, a free-lance writer on assignment for the New York-based 
Ladies' Home Journal, said her editors were intrigued by the story of a 
housewife who had "spent virtually her entire adult life taking care of her 
children," but who then is left for another woman. 
</P>
<P>
"Statistically, very few women commit murder," Neumeyer said. "The public is 
always fascinated when it involves the upper echelon of society, as this one 
does." 
</P>
<P>
Neumeyer said people are amazed when they hear that Betty Broderick was being 
paid $16,000 a month in support from her ex-husband. They don't realize, she 
said, "it was just a fraction of what he was making." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Jack Earley argued the same point, saying that Daniel 
Broderick, who had a medical degree as well as a law degree, and who had been 
president of the San Diego County Bar Assn., was paying his ex-wife only 10% of 
his monthly income. He, Earley argued, was wearing tailored suits and driving a 
Jaguar even when his family was sleeping in a rat-infested apartment. 
</P>
<P>
As the six women and six men entered the jury box Monday morning, one person in 
attendance whispered, "Not a one of them has ever seen a $100 pair of shoes." 
</P>
<P>
Neumeyer said it was the wealth of the Brodericks, their place in society and 
the bitter loss of what had once seemed their American dream, that led 
journalists around the country to focus on "this real-life 'War of the Roses.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
But a few onlookers were drawn by more than the money being talked about. Glenn 
Adams waited patiently for a seat, clutching his copy of "Deep Cover," a story 
about the Drug Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"I like this scene for a lot of reasons," Adams said of the Broderick trial. 
"Like, it's the ultimate 'Fatal Attraction,' man." 
</P>
<P>
Some people came to wait -- and, if they were lucky, to watch -- just for 
entertainment. One nattily dressed man, who asked not to be quoted by name, 
said he came for "the pure theater of it." 
</P>
<P>
"I have my choice," he said. "I can go to New York and see a Broadway play for 
$35. Or, I can come here. I'll take here. This is a much better show than 
anything on Broadway."

RASH OF TRAIN-TRACK DEATHS STIRS PLAN FOR SAFETY AWARENESS PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of the third fatal train accident in as many weeks, transportation 
officials Monday announced plans for a public-awareness campaign designed to 
remind San Diego County residents that, now more than ever, trains can kill. 
</P>
<P>
The decision followed the deaths Sunday of two of five people who had been 
sitting on the track in Encinitas, bringing the total of people struck and 
killed by trains in the county during October to four. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Garcia, district director of Caltrans, said his agency will meet with 
city and county officials during the coming weeks to decide how best to update 
San Diegans' often outdated perceptions of railroad hazards. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people are aware that a freeway is not a safe place to play, but for some 
reason they don't understand that train tracks, in many cases, are even more 
deadly," Garcia said in a statement. "We need to make them aware. Their lives 
could depend on it." 
</P>
<P>
The agency's goal: to erase romantic visions of hobo-hauling freight trains 
ambling leisurely -- and noisily -- down the track. According to Howard 
Robertson, an Amtrak spokesman, its trains -- 16 of which zip through San Diego 
County each day -- are faster and quieter than ever. And, as they have gained 
speed and lost decibels, partly as a result of newly installed quarter-mile 
strips of smooth, silent track, they also have grown more deadly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a give and take," Robertson said. "People like it (the 
improvements), but it's creating a little bit more danger. . . . (The trains) 
are on you before you even know it." 
</P>
<P>
According to law-enforcement officials, that is apparently what happened to a 
group of at least five people Sunday evening. About 7 p.m., a southbound train 
appeared suddenly out of the darkness, moving at 87 m.p.h. along the section of 
track in Encinitas where the group had gathered to drink beer. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies said the locomotive's engineer saw the group standing and 
sitting on the tracks, and sounded his horn in warning but was unable to stop 
before hitting at least two people, killing them instantly. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the two transients, Juan Carlos Ortega, 24, and Sandra Spires, 
45, were found dozens of feet south of the point of impact. Spires had been 
decapitated. 
</P>
<P>
A third person, Eliseo Zarate, 30, was taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La 
Jolla with broken ribs, a broken collarbone and many cuts. He was in stable 
condition in the coronary care unit Monday night. Sgt. Ron Morse of the 
Encinitas sheriff's station said Zarate was believed to have been struck by one 
of the bodies that was hit by the train. Officials did not know where Ortega 
and Zarate were from. 
</P>
<P>
Officials found a partly consumed 12-pack of beer near the tracks, Morse said. 
</P>
<P>
The train was all the more stealthy, Amtrak officials confirmed, because it was 
driven by an engine at the rear of the train, not pulled by an engine on the 
front. As a result, the noise generated by the engine was several cars away 
when the front car came upon the group. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson said Amtrak would support the posting of signs or the erection of 
fences around stretches of track where fatalities have occurred, and he said he 
consides San Diego County an excellent candidate for Operation Lifesaver, a 
program conducted by the Federal Railroad Assn. in schools and communities to 
educate people about railroad safety. The best way to avoid accidents, he said, 
is to modify people's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"If people are on our tracks, there's nothing we can do. We can't stop on a 
dime," he said, noting that trains moving 125 m.p.h. require nearly 2 miles to 
come to a complete stop. In exchange for a quieter, safer ride, he said, people 
"also have to be a little bit more aware. It's a pure tragedy that so many 
people have become a fatality in such a little time." 
</P>
<P>
The accident brought the county's train-related death toll to four this month. 
On Oct. 13, a 16-year-old Encinitas girl was killed by an Amtrak train while 
she and two friends were walking along the tracks near her parents' home in 
Encinitas. On Oct. 4, a 22-year-old surfer was struck and killed while taking a 
shortcut on a train trestle to the beach in San Onofre. 
</P>
<P>
Just the day before, a southbound Amtrak train hit an auto-transport truck that 
was stuck on the tracks in Leucadia. Six train passengers suffered minor 
injuries.

MORE PRAISE THAN CRITICISM FOR POLICE AT SHOOTING FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Police Department's first public forum in response to recent 
fatal shootings involving police was unexpectedly low-key Monday and yielded 
mostly positive comments from San Ysidro-area residents. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers have shot 23 people, nine fatally, this year. In four of the 
fatal shootings, officers were confronted by people carrying baseball bats, a 
garden stake and a cement trowel. The fatal shooting total is one less than the 
department record for a year. The district attorney's office has not filed 
criminal charges, relating to a fatal shooting, against a police officer since 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the department, once widely regarded as exemplary, say officers have 
gotten out of control in their use of deadly force. The department has also 
been plagued this year by allegations of incompetence and corruption regarding 
a string of prostitute murders. 
</P>
<P>
However, none of that was evident Thursday night. About 65 people attended the 
forum to question a panel headed by Police Chief Bob Burgreen and members of 
the department's citizen oversight committees. 
</P>
<P>
Many in attendance were hesitant to ask questions and few voiced the criticism 
that caused the department to schedule seven public forums during the next few 
weeks as part of its massive review of the department's policies and practices 
on the use of deadly force. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to praise the policy. There are too many guns and street gangs" 
terrorizing law-abiding San Diegans, said Joyce Holly, to the crowd's applause. 
</P>
<P>
The only criticism came from Irma Castro, executive director of the Chicano 
Federation, who said many of the police shootings were "senseless" and 
unnecessary. Castro said many San Diegans have come to fear police rather than 
look upon them as protectors and enforcers of the law. 
</P>
<P>
Castro said the Chicano Federation will issue its own findings on the shootings 
by early November. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen said changes in the department's policy and procedures regarding 
deadly force may come by Christmas, when an internal task force releases its 
findings on whether officers are properly trained, carrying the right equipment 
and making the correct shooting decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The chief said the scope and thoroughness of the department's study, which is 
at the mid-point, is unprecedented among major city police departments. 
</P>
<P>
The task force has studied deadly force policies, tactics, practices, equipment 
and training of the FBI and 15 other law-enforcement agancies across the 
country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen also has spoken with the City Council about public criticism of 
police, and he even put council members through a simulated shooting scenario 
recently to demonstrate the difficulty of determining when to use deadly force. 
</P>
<P>
A department ethics board also is considering recommending random, 
department-wide drug testing, a special anti-corruption unit to deal with 
potential abuses among officers and more extensive scrutiny of job applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the department's second-in-command is conducting a management audit 
designed to test whether the department's policies are being carried out and 
whether its organizational structure is sound. 
</P>
<P>
After the final public forum, Burgreen plans to meet with members of his 
department and all the chiefs of police in San Diego County and the sheriff. He 
said he will solicit ideas from two public review boards and then meet with his 
top commanders to develop a new policy in November. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen said the department policy is to train officers to shoot someone who 
poses a threat to their life. He said officers shoot to stop a threat, not to 
wound.

TAX THE RICH? IT WILL ONLY HURT OTHERS, THEY BELIEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BRAUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the heart of the capital of conspicuous consumption, Bernard Turner spent 
Monday morning consuming his own ire. 
</P>
<P>
The government in Washington was lurching toward new taxes on the rich, but 
ensconced in his usual sun-drenched window seat at a stock brokerage firm in 
the commercial center of Beverly Hills, the retired businessman was already 
braced for the impact. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to get hit hard, you can count on that," he said, motioning to 
packs of exquisitely dressed men and women hurrying down Wilshire Boulevard. 
"Those people are going to be screaming. You watch. You'll see people go out 
and decide not to buy $500 bathrobes anymore. They're going to buy $100 
bathrobes." 
</P>
<P>
This is the kind of talk that freezes blue blood and causes grown Hollywood 
executive producers to shed real tears. In Beverly Hills and Los Angeles' 
adjoining playgrounds for the rich -- in beauty salons and counting houses, 
trattorias and boardrooms -- it is no longer a question of whether the rich 
will get soaked by a new tax bill, or even how drenched they will get -- but 
rather, who else will get spattered as the rich shake themselves off. 
</P>
<P>
That was the fix that Turner had on events as he made his usual late-morning 
appearance Monday inside the reception area of Kennedy, Cabot &amp; Co., where 
he and a group of retirees meet every day to trade stock tips, snipe at each 
other and watch the progress of the stock market on a green electronic ticker. 
As they eyed the board, Congress worked to thrash out a compromise on efforts 
to increase taxes on people earning more than $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
"There's one thing I want to know!" interrupted a man who identified himself as 
Norman. "Why are all these politicians in Washington holding out for these 
white-collar types?" 
</P>
<P>
"Norman, you're making too much noise," said a man whose face was buried in 
Fortune magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"So sue me," said Norman. 
</P>
<P>
Their anteroom on Wilshire Boulevard is a world apart from the vault-like 
jewelry stores and couturiers clustered nearby on Rodeo Drive. Here, the talk 
revolves around money and its making, and the uniform is polyester and white 
socks, not natural fiber and brushed leather jackets. 
</P>
<P>
Turner, 73, who used to own a metal supply warehouse, said that without a cut 
in the capital gains tax, "I'm going to get killed." He motioned to the others 
in the room and added: "Every one of us has a lot in the market. We've all got 
stock portfolios in the six figures." 
</P>
<P>
"But then," Turner added, "I'm not rich." 
</P>
<P>
That is a refrain common among those in upper tax brackets, a way of commenting 
on their situation without disqualifying themselves. It is how a public 
relations mogul managed to exit her jade Rolls-Royce on Beverly Boulevard 
shortly before lunch, and, clutching her new Hermes handbag, sound as if she 
was describing auto layoffs in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone here will be affected," said the woman, who declined to give her name 
for fear of losing clients. "I was at the opening ceremonies for Tiffany's this 
morning and there were some lovely jewels there. Well, you know that if this 
bill comes to pass, people simply won't be buying as many of those kinds of 
items." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Marks' reluctance to be pegged as wealthy allowed him to browse with 
familiarity past a jewelry case in Neiman-Marcus with his wife, Rachel, and at 
the same time sound like a farm belt populist. 
</P>
<P>
"Terrible, just terrible," said Marks, who described himself as "in retail" as 
he adjusted a cashmere sweater slung casually over his shoulders. "We're going 
to get hit hard and for no reason other than we make a decent living. When we 
start hurting, the people who depend on us, our employees, will start hurting 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Interior designer Barbara Woolf, having her nails buffed, filed and refreshed 
in Jessica's Nail Clinic on West Hollywood's exclusive Sunset Plaza shopping 
strip, managed to adopt a fervent we-all-must-pitch-in attitude about the rich. 
"Some of their income is so out of proportion to the rest of us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Woolf reclined on a pink banquette inside a pink, scented room where 
white-uniformed emigres silently performed their miracles on pampered 
fingertips. While nail technician Anna Berendi applied finishing touches, Woolf 
wondered whether she would be hurt by the proposed removal of the tax rate 
"balloon" that has allowed some wealthy taxpayers to pay lower rates while 
merely affluent taxpayers pay higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," she concluded, "I don't know whether I'm in the balloon or not." 
</P>
<P>
But, like Turner, she was certain of one thing -- that if the rich get hurt, 
everyone else will too. 
</P>
<P>
"People will not be spending money," Woolf said, holding out her nails one more 
time. "This tax business could drive some of them out of business. There has to 
be a balance for people like us."

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police arrested two persons Monday on suspicion of murder in the 
bludgeoning death Friday night of 38-year-old Victor Avena. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Avena was attacked and killed in his home in the 3800 block of 42nd 
Street. Mexican authorities had found his body Sunday night in an isolated spot 
north of Ensenada in Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested about 12:30 p.m. Monday at a restaurant on Coronado Avenue were 
Avena's wife, Maria Guadalupe Oregal, 23, and her 16-year-old brother, whose 
name was withheld because he is a juvenile. Both had just crossed the border 
into the United States from Mexico.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISOR HAHN GOES HOME FROM HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Veteran Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn was sent home Monday 
following a three-day hospital stay for what an aide said was a bout with 
flu-like symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old Hahn, who suffered a stroke in 1987 that left him partially 
paralyzed and in a wheelchair, "is responding well to an adjustment in his 
medication and is expected to rest at home for about one week," said Hahn 
spokeswoman Lynn Sakamoto. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn was admitted to Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital on Friday complaining of 
"chest discomfort." 
</P>
<P>
"The supervisor did not have a heart attack," Sakamoto said.

TORONTO TRAIN OFFERS GLIMPSE OF FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oceanside residents got a glimpse of the future Monday when a Toronto commuter 
train pulled into the downtown transit center for a six-hour visit. The 
powerful diesel engine and one double-decker commuter car are what North County 
rail commuters will be riding in about two years. 
</P>
<P>
The passenger cars, which resemble pregnant guppies from the outside, sport 
padded seats, plenty of legroom and wide aisles on the inside. Each has a 
seating capacity of 163, with space for an equal number of standees. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Furniss, executive vice president of the Michigan firm that manufactures 
the commuter cars, said they are designed for safety and efficiency, without 
some of the frills of long-distance passenger carriers. 
</P>
<P>
"We could put cellular phones in, we could have a conference room at one end, 
we could have a nursery. These things have been done in special excursion 
trains," Furniss said. "But, for short-run commuter trains, we are designing 
for moving a large number of people. Comfortable seating, yes, but no frills." 
</P>
<P>
The cars also will be equipped with manual ramps to allow wheelchair access to 
the trains, he said. Automated wheelchair ramps have proved to be unreliable, 
so the manufacturer has designed a lightweight ramp that can be placed between 
the platform and the car, Furniss said. 
</P>
<P>
The Toronto commuter rail system moves 85,000 persons a day in 10-car trains 
carrying 2,000 passengers, Furniss said. The cars are designed with double 
doors designed to allow passengers to exit quickly -- 200 in two minutes -- to 
cut down the standing time in stations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no bar or dining facilities on the 42-mile run, according to 
North County Transit District spokesmen, but there will be fast, efficient 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Commuter trains are expected to run at half-hour intervals from Oceanside south 
to San Diego's Santa Fe station on Broadway, stopping at stations in Carlsbad, 
Encinitas, Solana Beach, Sorrento Valley, Miramar and Old Town on the way. The 
trip is expected to take about an hour. 
</P>

FILM INSULTS FAITH, SAY RASTAFARIAN PROTESTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Smoky incense sticks burned over the door. Reggae gospel boomed over speakers 
Monday into the gritty Los Angeles street. The bloody shoot-'em-up film "Marked 
for Death," in which a white hero does battle with a criminal gang of black men 
in dreadlocks, had inspired a protest in Hyde Park, Jamaican-style. 
</P>
<P>
"This film must be stopped," reggae star Ras Michael, an elder in the 
Rastafarian religion, said outside his tiny Hyde Park "assembly house," a sort 
of storefront record shop and church on busy Florence Avenue. "This film is not 
showing the truth of the dread-man and the Jamaican people." 
</P>
<P>
Michael, wearing a red silk African robe, turban and chest-length dreadlocks, 
lashed out at the R-rated 20th Century Fox movie starring Steven Seagal for 
what Michael called an inaccurate portrayal of Rastafarians and Jamaicans as 
killers and drug dealers. The protesters -- about a dozen men and women in 
brightly colored African gowns and dreadlocks -- bore such names as I-Locks, 
Strangejah Cole and Queen Rejoice. They spoke of themselves as Bible followers 
and lovers of peace. 
</P>
<P>
Their long hair, the bearded Michael said, symbolizes holiness. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm telling you . . . when the dreadlock man is killed by the star (during 
the film), they all cheered in the audience," the religious elder said. "That 
ain't right. Rasta is love." 
</P>
<P>
Fox, which released the film Oct. 5 to nearly 1,968 Southern California 
theaters, declined to comment Monday on the protest. However, the studio 
apparently expected some objection to the film, written by Michael Grais and 
Mark Victor and directed by Dwight H. Little. 
</P>
<P>
The credits end with a disclaimer saying that the criminal element portrayed 
"is estimated to be a fraction of 1% of the Jamaican population and should not 
detract from their country or the contributions Jamaicans have made to this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
The film does not refer to the gang members as Rastafarians. Neither that nor 
the disclaimer was enough to satisfy protesters who said the depiction of gang 
members in dreadlocks selling cocaine to Chicago high school students was 
implication enough. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the storefront, where a candlelight altar is used for chanting and 
prayer, reggae performer Queen Rejoice, 44, read part of a protest poem she 
co-wrote. The film, she intoned, "Tarnishes the reputation / And needs 
confrontation / To stop the exploitation. . . . These are the people of greed / 
Who will do anything to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
I-Locks, a 25-year-old keyboard player in Michael's reggae gospel band, saw the 
film Sunday and likened it to "a 1940s Superman movie." In "Marked for Death," 
the hero uses guns, knives and fists to overcome the dreadlock-wearing gang 
members. The gang, controlled by an unsmiling character named Screwface, was 
involved in cocaine, murder and voodoo, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"To me it looked like a direct propaganda film against the Rastafarian 
community," I-Locks said, in reference to the several thousand members in Los 
Angeles. "I don't like it. I don't like it at all."

DRIVER AND SNAKE SNARED AFTER A 2 1/2-HOUR CHASE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE SUSPECT HAD A 6-FOOT BOA AROUND HIS NECK DURING THE 100-M.P.H. 
PURSUIT, OFFICERS SAY. HE WAS WANTED FOR INVESTIGATION OF ASSAULT.

<P>
A man who had a six-foot boa constrictor wrapped around his neck led police on 
a frenzied, 2 1/2-hour car chase that crisscrossed the San Fernando and Santa 
Clarita valleys at speeds of more than 100 m.p.h., authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Paul Moore, 32, of Lake View Terrace, was arrested after the 180-mile 
pursuit Sunday night when a California Highway Patrol car rammed and disabled 
his car in Agoura Hills, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Moore was being held on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon -- his car -- 
and evading police. Los Angeles police said he was under the influence of 
numerous drugs, including alcohol, PCP and methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Valentino Paniccia, head of patrol in the Foothill Division, where the 
chase began, said authorities probably also will seek charges of driving under 
the influence. 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit began at 8:30 p.m. in the 11900 block of Gager Street in Lake View 
Terrace and covered freeways and surface streets in La Canada Flintridge, 
Castaic, Chatsworth, Canoga Park and Woodland Hills, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver traveled "at high speeds for most of 2 hours and 35 minutes," said 
CHP Officer Randy Shields. "This was so wild -- it was going on and off the 
freeways. The suspect backed up, made U-turns, went the wrong way against 
traffic." 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit began after patrol officers went to Moore's home to investigate a 
report that a woman had been assaulted there. It was unclear if authorities 
planned to proceed with an assault charge. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that as they approached his house, Moore sped away in his 1986 
Dodge with his pet snake in tow. 
</P>
<P>
The car took a circuitous route through the northeast San Fernando Valley 
before entering the Foothill Freeway, where it reached speeds of 120 m.p.h., 
police said. The car went through Glendale and La Canada Flintridge, where it 
left the freeway but immediately re-entered it. 
</P>
<P>
Officers following the car reported seeing the snake wrapped around the 
driver's neck at various times during the pursuit. The car reached the Golden 
State Freeway and headed north to Valencia where the Highway Patrol joined the 
pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
In Valencia, the car repeatedly left the freeway and re-entered it traveling in 
the wrong direction, authorities said. CHP officers stopped traffic when the 
suspect was on the freeway, and there were no collisions. 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit reached as far north as Hasley Canyon Road, near Castaic, before 
the suspect turned around and headed back toward Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said the driver ended up on the Ventura Freeway, took the Cheseboro 
Road exit in Agoura Hills and rammed a waiting CHP car. Shields said Moore's 
car was still moving when it was rammed by a second CHP car and brought to a 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries. Moore was arrested and taken to County-USC Medical 
Center for treatment of drug ingestion. The snake was found in the back seat 
unharmed and was taken by animal control officers. 
</P>
<P>
Paniccia said he will review his officers' involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Paniccia was off duty and informed of the chase at his Chatsworth home. Half an 
hour later, he said, the fleeing car, two patrol cars and a helicopter passed 
by. "I saw it firsthand," he said.

OFFICERS IN 4 COUNTIES RAID BOOKMAKING SITES, ARREST 4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Authorities in three Southern California counties have dismantled a huge 
bookmaking organization that was racking up $1 million a week in bets on 
football games, Los Angeles police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Four people, including the alleged head of the organization, were arrested in 
raids Sunday on eight locations in Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and Orange 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
A second bookie operation was raided by San Diego County sheriff's deputies, 
who said they expect additional arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Paper shredders, fax machines and betting sheets with the bettors' names in 
code were seized, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a pretty good-sized operation," said Lt. Dan Jones, head of the Gaming 
Section of the LAPD's Administrative Vice Division, which coordinated the bust. 
</P>
<P>
Philip C. Ronis, 32, who police said ran the operation, was arrested at his 
opulent estate in Montecito in Santa Barbara County. Police said Ronis' 
organization handled 125 bettors and took in $1 million a week. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the alleged bookmakers were arrested in a Long Beach condominium, which 
police said served as headquarters of Ronis' operation. When police officers 
entered the condo Sunday morning, the two suspects were working in separate 
rooms, each with telephones, calculators and sports journals listing coming 
games, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
During the raid, bettors continued to call in with their wagers, so the 
officers accepted those bets as additional evidence, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Ronis' bookmaking network accepted bets on professional and collegiate football 
games, as well as wagers of up to $10,000 on the World Series and occasional 
horse-racing bets as "a courtesy" to valued customers, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sports bettors are big bettors . . . (and) football is the creme de la creme 
of betting," the vice officer said. "The Super Bowl is the biggest betting day 
of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Football season is the busiest time for vice squads attempting to break up 
bookie organizations, he added, because the stakes are much higher and the 
volume of money that turns over is much larger than for year-round horse racing 
and other events. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles vice officers arrest an average of 50 to 60 bookies a year, Jones 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's raids culminated a four-month-long police investigation prompted by a 
confidential informer's tip. Officers watched the alleged bookies and found 
they were "keeping the hours" -- meaning they were seen arriving at the Long 
Beach condo before games began to take bets and seen leaving once the games 
started, when no additional bets could be taken. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police coordinated the raids in Santa Barbara, Long Beach, 
Manhattan Beach, Fullerton, Garden Grove, Brea, Calabasas and Fountain Valley. 
San Diego authorities raided seven sites in San Diego and San Bernardino 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities originally believed the two networks were connected, but later 
determined that although there were some links, they operated separately. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Ronis, the two men arrested in Long Beach were identified as 
Michael K. Anderson, 30, and David J. Atkins, 29. A third suspect, Kevin F. 
Ray, 31, was arrested at his home in Fullerton. All were booked on suspicion of 
felony bookmaking and were released on bail, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Ronis could not be reached for comment.

FATALITIES BRING DRIVE WARNING OF DEADLY NATURE OF TRAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of the third fatal train accident in three weeks, transportation 
officials on Monday announced plans for a public-awareness campaign designed to 
remind San Diego County residents that, now more than ever, trains can kill. 
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed Sunday night when they were hit by a train in Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Garcia, district director of Caltrans, said his agency will meet with 
city and county officials to decide how best to update the often-outdated 
perceptions of railroad hazards. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people are aware that a freeway is not a safe place to play, but for some 
reason they don't understand that train tracks, in many cases, are even more 
deadly," Garcia said in a statement. "We need to make them aware. Their lives 
could depend on it." 
</P>
<P>
The agency hopes to erase romantic visions of hobo-hauling freight trains 
ambling leisurely -- and noisily -- down the track. Howard Robertson, an Amtrak 
spokesman, said its trains -- 16 of which zip through San Diego County each day 
-- are faster and quieter than ever. And as they have gained speed and lost 
decibels, partly as a result of newly installed quarter-mile strips of smooth, 
silent track, they also have grown more deadly. 
</P>
<P>
"People like it (the improvements), but it's creating a little bit more 
danger," Robertson said. The trains "are on you before you even know it." 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials said that is apparently what happened to a group of 
at least five people Sunday evening. About 7 o'clock, a southbound train 
appeared suddenly out of the darkness, moving at 87 m.p.h. along a section of 
track in Encinitas where the group had apparently gathered to drink beer. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies said the locomotive's engineer saw the group on the tracks 
and sounded his horn in warning, but he was unable to stop. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Juan Carlos Ortega, 24, and Sandra Spires, 45, were found dozens 
of feet south of the point of impact. A third person, Eliseo Zarate, 30, was 
taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla with fractured ribs, a broken 
collarbone and numerous cuts. Zarate was believed to have been struck by one of 
the two people hit by the train. 
</P>
<P>
The accident brought the county's train-related death toll to four this month. 
On Oct. 13, a 16-year-old girl was killed by an Amtrak train while she and two 
friends were walking along the railroad tracks near her parents' home in 
Encinitas. On Oct. 4, a 22-year-old surfer was struck and killed while taking a 
shortcut along a train trestle to the beach in San Onofre. 
</P>
<P>
Just the day before, a southbound Amtrak train hit an auto-transport truck that 
was stuck on the tracks in the Leucadia area of Encinitas. Six train passengers 
suffered minor injuries.

A letter from Americans and other foreigners complaining about their detention 
at strategic sites in Iraq reached a Western embassy Monday, diplomats who 
declined to be identified said. 
</P>
<P>
A photocopy of the handwritten letter, minus the signatures, was distributed to 
reporters. It referred to foreigners detained inside a gas storage terminal by 
Iraqi officials. They are among those being held by Iraq to try to deter attack 
after its invasion Aug. 2 of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The letter said: 
</P>
<P>
"The camp inside the LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) storage terminal compound is 
in an extremely dangerous location and in the event of fire or explosion 
resulting from any reason whatsoever, it would be impossible for camp occupants 
to survive. 
</P>
<P>
"Disregarding our strong protests, the persons named herein have been forced to 
move into this camp. 
</P>
<P>
"This is contrary to international law, the Helsinki Accord on Human Rights and 
the promises of his excellency the president, Mr. Saddam Hussein, who has 
stated that the guests would be housed alongside of Iraqi residents and share 
the same risks as Iraqi citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"We, the undersigned, continue to protest this immoral and illegal act and 
herewith demand that we be permitted to contact our respective embassies and 
inform embassy personnel of this inhuman action being taken by representatives 
of the Ministry of Petroleum." 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats said they believed the signers were Americans and other 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats declined to say how many signatures were on the letter, and there 
was no immediate clue to the location of the plant mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how the letter was received, one diplomat said it "came along with the 
mail." He did not say if it had actually been stamped and postmarked. 
</P>
<P>
About 600 Americans, Britons, Germans, Japanese and other foreigners are being 
held at strategic sites in Iraq, according to sources. The number is believed 
to include about 100 Americans.

GARAGE DOORS KILL 46 CHILDREN; PARENTS URGED TO UPDATE OPENERS

<P>
At least 46 children have died in the last eight years because they were struck 
by automatic garage doors, government safety experts said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
They urged that homeowners replace all garage doors that do not have automatic 
reverse. 
</P>
<P>
The children were killed when closing doors did not reopen automatically, the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission said. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said children's lives could be safeguarded by checking the garage 
door opener and having it repaired or replaced immediately if the door does not 
respond to striking an object. 
</P>
<P>
Many garage door units made before 1982 do not have the automatic-reverse 
feature. 
</P>
<P>
Some older doors have a device intended to cause a closing door to reverse, 
but, because of wear, poor maintenance or a bad installation, it may not 
function well enough to prevent a child's death, the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners can check for the hazard by placing a two-inch wooden block in the 
path of the door, the commission said. "If the door does not promptly reverse 
on striking the block, the unit should be disengaged and a service technician 
called to see if repairs are needed," it said. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also said that units made after 1982 can be improved by installing an 
"electric eye" near the floor to cause a closing door to reopen if an object 
crosses its path.

Not Her Grade: Country music legend Dolly Parton received an honorary degree 
from Carson-Newman College in Jefferson City, Tenn., and brought down the house 
when she called herself "Dr. D.D.," a reference to her married name, Dolly 
Dean, as well as her bust size. "I'm trying very hard to hide it underneath 
this robe at this fine Baptist ceremony," she said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Books, Not Boris: Long lines of people outside Boris Yeltsin's Moscow home set 
off false rumors about the health of the Russian leader. The crowd had not come 
to mourn Yeltsin but to buy the first Russian translation of Mario Puzo's novel 
"The Godfather" at a bookstore in Yeltsin's building. Yeltsin's well-being has 
been a concern since a car accident a month ago.

Prison Perks: While deposed Panamanian ruler Manuel Noriega awaits trial on 
drug charges, he is staying in what is called the "dictator's suite" at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center in Miami. It has a bedroom, conference room 
and office, and is furnished with a color television, computer, exercise bike 
and paper shredder. There also are two safes containing documents, but Noriega 
doesn't know the combinations. 
</P>

Cast of Character: The plaster cast Prince Charles wore after he broke his 
right arm playing polo raised the equivalent of $3,230 at a church raffle 
Sunday in London. St. Thomas of Canterbury church will use the money to repair 
the roof, which sustained $87,000 damage in storms in February. "I will pass it 
through my family like an heirloom," said Elizabeth Schofield, who won the cast 
with a 95-cent raffle ticket. The prince broke his arm in a fall June 28 and 
donated the cast.

JACK SMITH: IT'S WATER OVER THE DAM, BUT LETTER IS STILL AMUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Bernhard, a retired employee of the Department of Water and Power, recently 
sent me a letter written some years ago by Will Durant, the late 
philosopher-historian, complaining about the size of his water bill. (Durant's 
appeal resulted in a credit on his next bill.) 
</P>
<P>
Evidently Bernhard had access to letters of complaint and saved some of them to 
amuse him in retirement. He now sends me another -- written in 1971 by a woman 
in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Like Durant, this woman was complaining about a bill that she considered too 
high. Her style, however, is more satirical than that employed by the gentle 
philosopher. 
</P>
<P>
Her letter follows: 
</P>
<P>
"To whom it may concern: 
</P>
<P>
"Units of water consumed is 108, as stated on the bill. If a unit represents 
100 cubic feet of water, or 748 gallons (as I was told by an employee of the 
DWP) you are stating that I have used 80,784 gallons of water in the past two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"That (according to Compton's Encyclopedia on the bathing and drinking habits 
of elephants), could satisfy the needs of your average-sized elephant for four 
years and 155 days. Don't ask me what size your average-sized elephant is -- 
Compton either didn't know or considered it irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
"However, I'm quite sure it exceeds the weight of my entire family several 
times, which, by the way, consists of one man, who, although he bathes, hasn't 
drunk water since he discovered Coors beer in 1949; one kid, who although he 
drinks water, bathes only at gunpoint, and myself. 
</P>
<P>
"I do bathe, but because I object to the Burnt Sienna tinge and the lumps in 
that mud-colored liquid which dribbles from the spigots, I have become addicted 
to Arrowhead Puritas. 
</P>
<P>
"I am the owner of a small domestic establishment, not the Coliseum. 80,784 
gallons could have dampened a fire (had there been a fire) at the rate of 1,800 
gallons per minute for exactly 44.88 minutes, from an opened hydrant. That 
amount in cubic feet (10,800) could fill a super pool, 8 feet deep and 27 feet 
by 50 feet, and I don't even own a plastic kiddie play pool. 
</P>
<P>
"With that much water I could fill 1,923 king-size water beds, so I'm told by a 
friend who manufactures them. If I've used this much water, why is my lawn 
half-dead from a lack of it? 
</P>
<P>
"If you are positive you haven't confused me with someone who owns 27 
elephants, then my meter belongs in the Smithsonian as the first machine to 
exhibit emotionalism common only to the human species -- namely, greed. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect to receive a reply, an explanation, and a serviceman to replace the 
idiot box in my front yard with one which is capable of functioning without 
these strange tendencies toward exaggeration." 
</P>
<P>
Alas, Bernhard does not know how this case was resolved -- whether the customer 
received a new meter and a credit on her bill, or both. I would like to think 
that so eloquent a letter did not go unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
I am not mathematician enough to know whether this woman's figures (about 
bathing elephants and so on) are correct. She sounds positive. But I am 
skeptical about her complaint that her tap water was mud-colored. The water we 
have received from the DWP has always been clear, though it tastes somewhat of 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
I had a long running battle with the late Bob Lee, a longtime executive with 
the department, over the purity of the water. I once referred to it as 
"artificial water," thus provoking an indignant letter from Mr. Lee (who 
remained throughout his lifetime a good friend). 
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the water was water, and was not in any sense artificial. I 
simply pointed out that the water was routinely adulterated by various 
chemicals, to make it safe to drink, and that thus it was artificial. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Lee never conceded an inch to me and took every occasion to chastise me for 
using that epithet. He was not moved by the fact that novelist Joe Wambaugh in 
one of his novels referred to such expensive bottled waters as Evian and 
Perrier as "designer water" -- a sly comment on the vogue use of that adjective 
with every kind of consumer product from jeans to cosmetic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
That letter-writer's note that her husband hadn't drunk water since he 
discovered Coors in 1949 may seem at first glance an admirable solution to the 
impending water shortage. In some parts of the world, in fact, beer is the only 
safe thing to drink. I survived our recent trek through Egypt by drinking 
nothing but beer and wine. But of course it takes water to make beer, and it 
takes water to grow grapes. 
</P>
<P>
I don't mean to make fun of the water shortage. It could soon be very real. One 
day soon we may all be bathing, like Cleopatra, in goat's milk.

ART BUCHWALD: IT'S REAL STORY, BUT WILL IT FLY?

<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't a big story, but at the same time it wasn't a small story -- and it 
did have a tiny connection with the budget fight. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that two Saturdays ago the Secretary of the Air Force, Donald B. Rice, 
took an Air Force jet to South Bend, Ind., with his wife and an aide, Lt. Col. 
Carl Tickel, when Notre Dame was playing the Air Force Academy. The cost to the 
taxpayers was $5,700. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the junket felt that it was a waste of taxpayers' money, and the 
trip was an outrage to Pentagon cost-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
But Secretary Rice's spokesman, Lt. Col. Darrell Hayes, insisted that the jet 
flight was "official business." The only reason that Rice flew out there was to 
discuss Notre Dame ROTC business with the cadets at the school, according to 
Hayes. Hayes was quoted as saying, "It was an official visit, and as secretary 
he is authorized to use Air Force aircraft for official business." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses at South Bend, including the colonel in charge of the Notre Dame Air 
Force ROTC, claim that they didn't notice Rice conducting any business at all. 
</P>
<P>
Because the stories vary so much we can only guess what really happened. As one 
who always takes the word of an Air Force spokesman as opposed to some crabby 
civilian, here is my scenario: 
</P>
<P>
It was a quiet Saturday morning at the Pentagon, and Secretary Rice turned to 
his aide, Col. Tickel. "I'm bored," Rice told him. "I wish I had something to 
do today." 
</P>
<P>
Tickel replied, "Why don't we go out to Notre Dame and review the troops?" 
</P>
<P>
"That's a good idea," Rice said. "I like surprise visits. Can we order up an 
airplane?" 
</P>
<P>
"Of course we can," the colonel responded. "There is nothing more official on 
your schedule than this trip." 
</P>
<P>
They boarded the plane, and Rice, his wife and Tickel flew out, arriving at 1 
o'clock. When they reached the campus there was no one around. They kept 
walking until they saw a stadium and heard the roars coming from it. 
</P>
<P>
"What is it?" Rice asked. 
</P>
<P>
Tickel peeked through a hole in the fence. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're playing football, sir." 
</P>
<P>
"What's football?" Rice wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a game that Notre Dame plays with a very funny shaped ball." 
</P>
<P>
Rice said, "We should go in because all our ROTC cadets might be there." 
</P>
<P>
The three went inside. It was time out and Tickel yelled, "All Air Force ROTC 
students come down from the stands and meet the Secretary of the Air Force." 
</P>
<P>
Five thousand students rose from their seats and gathered around the Rices, 
completely ignoring the game. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary told them, "I want you to study hard and be good to your 
mothers." They all cheered. Rice continued, "Never take a $3 bill from a 
drunken sailor. Thank you, gentlemen." The students broke into the Air Force 
hymn and saluted as Rice with his wife and Tickel walked out of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Tickel said, "Don't you want to see the game, sir? It's Notre Dame vs. the Air 
Force." 
</P>
<P>
"No, this is a strictly business trip. I'll see them play some other time when 
I'm paying for it myself." 
</P>
<P>
That, dear reader, is the true story of what happened with Rice's plane. If you 
would rather believe Col. Hayes' version, I'd like to tell you a story about a 
grizzly bear that went into the bar for a drink.

Action star Steven Seagal again stood his ground at the box office, as "Marked 
for Death" claimed the No. 1 spot for the third consecutive week with ticket 
sales of $5 million. The World War II drama "Memphis Belle" took second place, 
with receipts of $4.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Third place went to "Quigley Down Under," starring Tom Selleck as a 
sharpshooter in 1860's Australia. It earned $3.8 million. The weekend also saw 
the debuts of two limited releases: On 99 screens, Universal's "White Palace" 
grossed just over $1 million, for a per-screen average of $10,896. Warner 
Bros.' "Reversal of Fortune" earned $176,985 on seven screens, for an 
impressive $25,284 average. Both films go wider on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
* After two weeks of successful limited release, Tri-Star's "Avalon" widened to 
630 screens and earned $2.8 million for the No. 7 spot. That's a $4,465 
per-screen average.

Look Who's Talking Now: A 3-year-old boy wonder from Kansas who wowed audiences 
in recent network television interviews is set for his acting debut. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, Seth Kinast, will begin rehearsals Friday for a segment of "Baby 
Talk," the comedy based on the movie "Look Who's Talking," scheduled to debut 
on ABC in November. He'll play a student at a school for young geniuses. The 
3-year-old's reading skills and his abilities to recite the Greek alphabet and 
the English alphabet forward and backward landed him on David Letterman's 
late-night talk show. "Baby Talk" stars Tony Danza and Julia Duffy. BETH KLEID

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The horrible moment lives on, as it will for the rest of his days, in the mind 
of Evander Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it must be a nightmare, that if I woke up, it would just go away," 
he once said of that moment in the summer of 1984 when he was kicked out of the 
Olympic Games in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In a semifinal bout of the light-heavyweight division, Holyfield was 
administering a beating to New Zealander Kevin Barry when, during an exchange, 
the Yugoslav referee, Bligorije Novicic, yelled, "Stop!" 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield had already launched a left hook that landed on the side of Barry's 
head and knocked him out. A great roar went up when Novicic waved Holyfield 
away and it appeared as if he had won the fight. But Holyfield wasn't being 
designated the winner, he was being disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
Only U.S. Coach Pat Nappi, who was already on the ring apron and angrily 
shouting at Novicic, knew that Holyfield had been disqualified for a late blow. 
Slowly, the cheers of the 16,000 on hand turned to boos. Outrage ruled, 
particularly after replays and stopwatches showed that Holyfield couldn't have 
stopped his punch at the command to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The incident is remembered today not only for the drama of the moment, but for 
the class and dignity Holyfield showed. There were no tantrums, no tears, no 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
No one would have blamed him if he had gone back to the Olympic Village, packed 
up and gone home to Atlanta. Instead, he showed up two days later on the 
victory stand, graciously accepting his bronze medal. A great ovation went up 
when the light-heavyweight gold medalist, Anton Josipovic, another Yugoslav, 
raised Holyfield's hand, a gesture that seemed to say he was the real champion. 
</P>
<P>
In a professional sport where prickly personalities and childish behavior are 
common, Evander Holyfield remains boxing's Mr. Class. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night here at the Mirage, Holyfield challenges Buster Douglas for the 
heavyweight championship. In the six years since his nightmare in Los Angeles, 
Holyfield may have more muscles, but class and dignity still define the man who 
is favored to beat Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield was at ringside last February in Tokyo when Douglas upset Mike Tyson 
and took away Tyson's championship. Upon leaving Tokyo, Holyfield discovered he 
was in the same first-class section of Tyson's flight home. 
</P>
<P>
Both felt pain, for Tyson and Holyfield had already signed for a battle of 
unbeatens in June, 1990, and all those millions were gone when Douglas knocked 
out Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
"He left his seat and came over to me and said he felt bad for me, and asked if 
my eye would be OK," Tyson said a month later. "He's a nice guy, really." 
</P>
<P>
Another example: Holyfield had a cold the week he fought Alex Stewart in 
Atlantic City on Nov. 4, 1989, and, although he stopped Stewart on a cut, it 
was an extremely difficult fight for him. Several times, he seemed a punch or 
two away from being knocked down by Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want him to fight that night," said George Benton, co-trainer of 
Holyfield, with Lou Duva. "I wanted to postpone the fight. But I'm not the 
manager, so I didn't speak up. I didn't even want to suggest it to Evander, 
because I didn't want that seed of doubt in his mind." 
</P>
<P>
At the news conference after the fight, Duva raised the subject of Holyfield's 
cold, a secret before the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Evander wouldn't even discuss it to anyone after the fight," Benton said. 
"That's the kind of guy he is. When I asked him later about it, he told me he 
didn't want to take anything away from Stewart's effort." 
</P>
<P>
OK, so he's a nice guy. Can he fight? 
</P>
<P>
At 24-0, you figure he can fight at least a little bit. But he has been brought 
along carefully by promoter Dan Duva, Lou Duva's son. If you were putting 
together a list of fighters you wouldn't want Holyfield -- or any other 
prospect -- to fight before he got a championship bout, Razor Ruddock, Riddick 
Bowe, Bruce Seldon, Tim Witherspoon and Michael Dokes might well be on it. 
</P>
<P>
Of those, Holyfield has fought only Dokes. And on March 11, 1989, at Caesars 
Palace, Holyfield wound up in the fight of his life before he knocked out Dokes 
in the 10th round. It was viewed by many as the most exciting heavyweight fight 
of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
But critics of Holyfield maintain it shouldn't have been an exciting fight, if 
Holyfield is of championship caliber. Dokes, it is always pointed out, was 
years past his prime and coming off rehabilitation from drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
A second knock on Holyfield is his size. At 6 feet 1, 210 to 212 pounds, he is 
a small, though powerfully built, heavyweight. In Douglas, 6-4 and 235 pounds, 
he meets the third-biggest heavyweight champion in history. 
</P>
<P>
Said Douglas' trainer, J.D. McCauley: "You take Holyfield out of those 
weightlifting gyms where they've had him the last few years, and you've got a 
guy walkin' around at 195. Look at Holyfield's legs -- they're pop bottles. 
Evander's going to learn Thursday what the difference is between a big 
heavyweight and a little heavyweight, and he won't like it." 
</P>
<P>
In every fight, Holyfield has impressed critics with his upper-body strength, 
his courage and stamina. Not known for his defensive work, he has been hit hard 
and often. He has been rocked and stunned, but always he had more left at the 
finish than his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say his stand-up style and lack of lateral movement make him vulnerable 
to a taller heavyweight with a strong left jab, such as Douglas. In other 
words, if Douglas took Tyson apart with his left jab, how can a smaller, more 
exposed Holyfield stand up to it? 
</P>
<P>
"All fighters get hit," Holyfield says. "Good fighters will hit you, that's 
part of boxing. Buster's a good fighter, but I'll be ready. I feel I have an 
edge in conditioning -- if it goes into the late rounds. It will come down to 
how much Buster can take, how much he can endure, because he will have to 
endure." 
</P>
<P>
If Holyfield loses, and if in the postfight analysis it is felt by most that 
Douglas was too strong and Holyfield not strong enough, it won't be a favorable 
development for a new partner we've seen in recent years in boxing -- the 
strength coach. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield has been in involved in high-tech weight-training programs since 
1984, shortly after turning pro, when it seemed he would never grow naturally 
into a true heavyweight. 
</P>
<P>
He not only has a strength coach, Lee Haney, seven times bodybuilding's "Mr. 
Olympia," but a stretching coach as well, Mareya Kennett, who owns a ballet 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure, Holyfield says, is the key to beating Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
"Buster's at his best when you let him dictate the pace," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't let him do that. I have a good jab too, and I can hit him with it. I 
don't underestimate him at all. He won the title because of total domination 
(of Tyson), and he looked good doing it. But I'm prepared." 
</P>
<P>
Rocky Marciano, the unbeaten 1950s heavyweight champion, fought bigger 
heavyweights his entire career, knocked out 43 of 49 opponents, yet fought his 
entire career at less than 190 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
As his old trainer, Charley Goldman once put it: "You don't have to weigh 220 
to knock a guy out. You just have to hit him."

RAIDERS WELCOME A RESPITE; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE ON A ROLL, THERE ARE WOUNDS TO HEAL BEFORE 
PLAYING THE CHIEFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In seven weeks, the Raiders have taken a two-game lead in the AFC West, shown 
that two tailbacks can be better than one, restored luster to a sagging image, 
retooled an erratic quarterback and made him the king of efficiency and shown 
the kind of consistency it takes to have scored 24 points in each of four 
consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
So, the Raiders are hot as an Al Davis rumor. They used to lead the league in 
penalties and fistfights. In Sunday's victory over San Diego, they were 
penalized twice for nine yards. One of those was a white-collar mistake by 
Coach Art Shell, who blanked on a certain passage in the NFL rule book about 
the requirements of declaring tackles eligible. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders aren't even dirty anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"Our team is playing very hard and very clean," Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are firing on all cylinders and can't wait until Sunday when they 
can take all this momentum and sink their teeth into . . . no one? 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have a week off, forcing the team to sit on its hands for two weeks 
until a showdown Nov. 4 with the Chiefs in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
They way they're playing, you'd think the Raiders would suit up tomorrow if 
they could, but Shell said the break is coming at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, you want to continue to play, because we're doing all right," 
he said. "But we've got some people hurting, and we need to get healthy. So 
it's coming at a pretty good time. We can use it." 
</P>
<P>
Shell lost four more players to injuries Sunday. Left tackle Rory Graves 
strained his left foot, tight end Andy Parker pulled a hamstring, snapper Dan 
Turk suffered a knee strain and tackle Tim Rother injured a foot. Nothing 
earth-shaking, but serious enough stuff to welcome an extra week off. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders gambled and won when they activated defensive end Howie Long for 
the Charger game, instead of using the open date to allow Long another two 
weeks of rehabilitation. When Long broke his right foot against Seattle in Week 
2, doctors estimated that he wouldn't return before the Chief game Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
"Howie played pretty good for the first time back," Shell said. "He didn't show 
any signs of the injury being a problem. He came out all right. That's a big 
positive for us." 
</P>
<P>
Long, though, welcomes the respite. 
</P>
<P>
"My foot's not that well, and I'm not in shape," he said after Sunday's game. 
"The week off couldn't come at a better time, as far as I'm concerned." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders also have three injured players ready to come back: cornerback 
Garry Lewis, collarbone; tackle Bruce Wilkerson, knee; and tight end Mike Dyal, 
hamstring. All are eligible for removal from the injured-reserve list, and all 
can use an extra week to work out the kinks to play the Chiefs, who messed up 
what could have been a battle for first place by losing to Seattle on Sunday, 
19-7. 
</P>
<P>
Shell, new to the position of looking back over his shoulder at the 
competition, said he hasn't paid much attention to the standings. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I care about is what we're doing," he said. "Ultimately, we 
have to take care of ourselves. If you take care of your own, you don't worry 
about what other people are doing. I'd be lying to you to say I don't look to 
see what's there. But if you get your hopes up for somebody else helping you, 
then you're in trouble. You help yourself. The Raiders take care of themselves. 
Let the rest of them fall in line."

RAMS JUMP ON OWN BANDWAGON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One victory, one little leap to a 2-4 record and suddenly all is well again 
with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, they were 1-4 and feeling at rock bottom. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't even see the light of day two days ago," Coach John Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
But Monday, the Rams didn't need excuses, statistical examinations or an 
embarrassed coach to explain their plight. 
</P>
<P>
All they needed was to point to the NFC standings, accept the compliments for 
the 44-24 pounding they had given the Atlanta Falcons Sunday and begin talking 
about how their early-season emergencies are vanishing. 
</P>
<P>
One victory, and the sinking feelings are history. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've crawled out of the hole and we're back in the race," Robinson 
said. "I think there are a couple of guys way out in front of us, but 
surprisingly, there are a number of people, when you think wild card, who are 
not very far in front of us, who have yet to negotiate a couple of holes that 
may be up there for them, too. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can get going and really start to improve now, then I think we can make 
this into a good season." 
</P>
<P>
Only six NFC teams have better records than the Rams, and only three of those 
-- the San Francisco 49ers, Chicago Bears and New York Giants -- seem 
particularly uncatchable. 
</P>
<P>
And, including the Rams, seven teams -- one-half of the conference -- have 2-4 
records. Thanks to the addition of a third wild-card team this season, six 
teams in each conference make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
So even if it's more a matter of the rest of the conference falling back than 
the Rams' rise into the playoff hunt, the Rams can dream of better days. 
</P>
<P>
And the rest of the conference is courteously allowing them that luxury. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see much difference in teams in the NFL, with the clear exception of 
those that you would put at the top," Robinson said. "There's a lot that 
happens from now. I think things begin to take shape, teams begin to settle 
into oblivion and others begin to try to stay in the hunt for whatever playoff 
opportunities they have. 
</P>
<P>
"Go down the NFC list. Who's going to be good? Damned if I know. It's the club 
that seems to come alive now that has a chance to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done this before. We've had down periods and have come back strong from 
them. We hope we can do it again." 
</P>
<P>
If anything, the Rams hope the last month of trauma has made them stronger, 
tighter as a unit and ready for the long road ahead. 
</P>
<P>
And after Sunday's solid defensive performance against a wide-open Atlanta 
offense that would have seemed designed to plunder the Rams' previously weak 
pass defense, they were convinced the tough times are through. 
</P>
<P>
"This team has been through a lot the last six games, and we're going to be a 
better team for it," quarterback Jim Everett said. "I think this is going to be 
a turning point, after all we've gone through." 
</P>
<P>
Said Robinson: "I guess if you survive a beating it makes you stronger. I don't 
know whether that's masochistic or not. I think we did all of this staying 
together. I think there's a certain sense of pride in that. 
</P>
<P>
"In the course of the last month, a couple of coaches have been attacked in 
terms of not doing their job, of being in jeopardy of losing their jobs. Those 
are all difficult things to deal with. I think we all dealt with it OK." 
</P>
<P>
The man who had to deal with the most negative attention was defensive 
coordinator Fritz Shurmur, who said the last thing he wanted was for the 
players to begin worrying about his job security. 
</P>
<P>
When the point was raised publicly last week, Shurmur said he went to his 
players and told them to ignore the talk and concentrate on winning, not saving 
his job. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a quality defensive effort, one that Shurmur thinks was more 
about personal pride than coaching survival. 
</P>
<P>
"All I did was say that, 'Hey, let's not any of us get so involved with this 
job situation thing that it's a factor,' " Shurmur said. "Because my job is not 
the issue. The issue is we as a group of people getting ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when coaches start worrying about jobs, they spend the time protecting 
the damn thing instead of doing it. This is a deal where you've got to be ready 
to put yourself and what you believe on the line every week, and the minute you 
start appeasing or worrying about your job, then you spend all your job 
protecting it and not doing it. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times when you start to give reasons for everything that happened -- 
that's history. You've got to look forward, you can't be worrying about it. And 
I didn't want them worrying about it. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't 'play for the coach.' That's the least thing on my mind. I mean, 
that is not on my mind, ever. Play for themselves and for the thing that 
involves pride in your performance and demonstrating your ability to do 
whatever it takes to compete and win. That's what's involved."

COURAGE NOT WALKER'S PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Herschel Walker, the 225-pound sprinter who has been turned into a jogger by 
the Minnesota Vikings, continues to be the most misunderstood football player 
of our time. 
</P>
<P>
The charge that Walker lacks courage was brought into the open on national 
television Sunday by NBC announcer O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
It is a preposterous charge. The truth is that Walker has all the courage that 
Simpson ever showed in his NFL career. And to allege otherwise is to slander a 
veteran athlete irresponsibly. 
</P>
<P>
Walker's problem is his style, or lack of style, as a ballcarrier. 
</P>
<P>
He could be an asset to any coach who knows how to use Walker's assets: his 
great speed and his aptitude for catching the ball. But as a conventional 
running back -- on slashes or sweeps or when cutting in a broken field -- he 
never has been more than ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
Except for his extraordinary speed and sure hands, Walker, to give him the best 
of it, was no better than mediocre on conventional offensive plays at Georgia, 
or at Dallas, or in the USFL or anywhere else he has played football. 
</P>
<P>
Always faster than any defensive player on the field, he has often gained a lot 
of yards, although, to this day, he doesn't know how to cut, change pace, hit a 
hole or attack a defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
In short, he isn't an instinctive football player. Thus, when confronted by a 
defender dead ahead, Walker doesn't know what to do. And his indecision in 
head-to-head confrontations makes him appear to be flying a white flag. 
</P>
<P>
The appearance is a lie. Nobody catches passes in a crowd more courageously 
than Walker. And no ballcarrier has ever carried more tacklers on his back, 
play after play, while struggling on. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually defenseless because of his style, Walker has probably taken more 
shots than any other active NFL player and has always come back for more. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson, one of the best running backs of all time, should know all that. His 
assault on Walker was shocking and embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
A continuing NFL irony is the Washington Redskins' inability to run the ball 
for significant yardage with one of the best-designed ground attacks in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The blockers in the Redskins' one-back offense often push the defense two or 
three yards off the line -- giving their runners two or three free yards at a 
time -- but the Redskins haven't had a consistently productive ground gainer 
since John Riggins retired in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Walker is the kind of athlete who would operate deftly in the Redskin system, 
which Coach Joe Gibbs has used to win two Super Bowls. Empowered to hit the 
hole at top speed, Walker would have five yards instantly. And occasionally he 
would pop it and take off. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs' offense is entirely different from Minnesota's. Based on trap blocking, 
the Viking system handicaps rather than assists Walker. 
</P>
<P>
First, he doesn't read traps instinctively. Second, his speed is wasted while 
he waits for the slow-developing Viking offense to uncoil. 
</P>
<P>
Used properly, Walker would be a potent, productive running back in the NFL. He 
has the speed to be a big ground gainer for the Redskins, Rams and others. His 
abilities are not only squandered in Minneapolis, he must also endure insults. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Singletary, the Chicago Bears' all-pro linebacker, was saying the other 
day that in pro football, turnovers are overrated. 
</P>
<P>
That will not sit well with the coaches who blame losses on fumbles and 
interceptions instead of, for example, on coaching mistakes, but it's a view 
that Singletary has held since his days at Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears, who have started 5-1 this fall, finished 6-10 last season under the 
same coach, Mike Ditka, because "we got away from the basics," Singletary told 
Chicago Tribune writer Bob Sakamoto. 
</P>
<P>
"I got in an argument with four or five of the guys on defense last year," 
Singletary said. "They said it wasn't important to be ranked No. 1 on defense 
if we still kept getting turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"Even Coach Ditka said as long as we kept getting turnovers, it was OK. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not the way you play defense. Turnovers are a byproduct of good 
defense. Once you rely on turnovers to win games and don't get them, you're in 
bad shape. 
</P>
<P>
"We had guys going for the ball and not the body (last year). Hey, just be the 
No. 1 defense, and the turnovers will take care of themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Last August, AFC West coaches ranked the Raiders and San Diego Chargers about 
even with the Denver Broncos, Kansas City Chiefs and Seattle Seahawks in one of 
pro football's strongest divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Everything depended, the coaches said, on whether there would be an improvement 
in any of the division's four shaky quarterback situations. If not, they said, 
the AFC West's only established quarterback, John Elway of Denver, could be 
expected to maintain the Broncos' edge. 
</P>
<P>
After the first seven of the season's 17 weeks, it seems clear that there has 
been a conspicuous improvement at quarterback in only one of the division's 
five cities, Los Angeles. And it follows that the Raiders are out in front in 
large part because of Jay Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, there isn't much to choose from. For example, take the 
Raider-Charger game Sunday. Both defenses were effective. There were blue-chip 
receivers on both sides. And both clubs ran the ball smartly. It can't be said 
that Marcus Allen and Bo Jackson outran Marion Butts and Rod Bernstine. 
</P>
<P>
The difference was that Schroeder outplayed Billy Joe Tolliver by an immense 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
As the division heads into its bye week, Schroeder is the All-AFC West 
quarterback, for which there may be a dual explanation: the faith that owner Al 
Davis had in him and the refinements by quarterback coach Mike White. 
</P>
<P>
The run-and-shoot offense is still making progress in Houston, where, for the 
first time, it is being operated by good football players -- among them 
quarterback Warren Moon and four above-average wide receivers. 
</P>
<P>
At Detroit, the run-and-shoot Lions don't have that kind of talent. And 
previously, the system was mostly used by school teams. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Oilers, with Moon in the huddle and Coach Jack Pardee on the bench, 
have been elected to determine whether the run and shoot is viable on the 
professional level. And so far they have shown that it is. 
</P>
<P>
They have led the AFC in offense all year. And after surviving a rash of 
fumbles and dropped passes earlier, they have won their last two games to get 
into contention in the AFC Central. 
</P>
<P>
Houston's opponents have been impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"The Oilers can play football with the best of them," San Francisco quarterback 
Joe Montana announced after the 49ers won earlier this month, 24-21, on a fluke 
Houston error -- an inopportune timeout that deprived the Oilers of a fumble 
recovery late in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the peculiar power of the run and shoot in San Diego's loss to 
Houston, 17-7, Charger linebacker Leslie O'Neal said: "It was really 
frustrating. We'd rush the passer hard, but they'd throw a little pass and pick 
up yards." 
</P>
<P>
Moon's arm has been doing most of the damage to Houston opponents. The Oilers' 
problem has been at running back, where they can't get untracked with either 
Lorenzo White or Allen Pinkett after dealing away both Alonzo Highsmith and 
Mike Rozier -- neither of whom has done much since. 
</P>
<P>
Remarking on the Oilers' wealth of talent in recent years, most NFL critics 
have mentioned their backs first -- but it seems obvious that none of the 
club's famous top four was as special as advertised in the Heisman voting. 
</P>
<P>
Most opponents have calculated for some time that there's something wrong in 
the Houston backfield. Four pretty good young backs shouldn't all go bad. 
</P>
<P>
To make a real move in the run and shoot, Pardee will have to improve his 
backfield. The draw play is open half the time in that system, but to keep Moon 
from being overwhelmed, somebody will have to run it.

SMITH HOLDS EDGE OVER ASU

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arizona State, which will play USC Saturday at Tempe, Ariz., is the only team 
in the Pacific 10 Conference that holds a series edge over the Trojans. The Sun 
Devils are 5-3 against USC in a series that started in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
But Coach Larry Smith is 6-2 against Arizona State, including a 5-2 record 
while he coached at Arizona. Twice, in 1982 and 1985, Smith's Arizona team 
deprived the Sun Devils of a Rose Bowl bid by beating them in the last game of 
the regular season. In the 1986 season, when ASU was 10-1-1 and beat Michigan 
in the Rose Bowl, its only loss was to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
USC's 35-26 loss to Arizona Saturday was its first in a Pac-10 game at the 
Coliseum in 3 1/2 seasons under Smith. Smith's USC teams are 17-3-1 at the 
Coliseum, 12-1-1 in conference games. JERRY CROWE

<P>
Running back Dalton Hilliard of the New Orleans Saints suffered a torn ligament 
in his right knee late in Sunday's loss to Houston and will be sidelined for at 
least this week's game against Detroit, Coach Jim Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
The early diagnosis indicated Hilliard will recover without surgery and will 
not be sidelined long enough to warrant being placed on injured reserve, Mora 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rueben Mayes probably will start against Detroit in Hilliard's place, Mora 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Starting center Grant Feasel of the Seattle Seahawks underwent arthroscopic 
surgery on his right knee after being injured in Sunday's victory over Kansas 
City, Coach Chuck Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
Knox said that because the Seahawks have an off-week, they hope to have Feasel 
in the starting lineup Nov. 4 against the San Diego Chargers in the Kingdome.

QUESTION OF BALANCE FINALLY ANSWERED

<P>
Offensive balance is something the Rams hadn't achieved until Sunday, in their 
44-24 victory over the Atlanta Falcons. They rushed 32 times and passed 38. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first time that we had been able to play a game offensively, for 
some time, other than Tampa, where we were not significantly behind," Coach 
John Robinson said. "It allowed us to put together a rhythm of run and pass 
that I liked." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time this season, Jerry Glanville's Falcons rarely blitzed 
against the Rams and generally toned down their style. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they had gone a little too far out over the edge," Robinson said. "You 
know, it's a new staff, and their approach to football is to come in and to 
sell an attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Because the Rams don't play until Monday night against the Pittsburgh Steelers, 
Robinson gave the team today and Wednesday off. . . . Robinson said he didn't 
know if cornerback Darryl Henley, who has been sidelined all season because of 
an injured hip muscle, will be activated this week. Henley began working with 
the team last week. TIM KAWAKAMI

The San Diego Chargers had five drives inside the Raiders' 20-yard line Sunday 
but came away with only nine points. 
</P>
<P>
Is it dangerous for opponents to get inside the 20 so many times? 
</P>
<P>
"It's dangerous if they get in the end zone," Coach Art Shell said. "If they 
don't get in the end zone, it's not dangerous. They got down there, and our 
defense wouldn't let them in." 
</P>
<P>
Shell on the Raiders scoring 24 points for four consecutive weeks: "If we could 
score three points and win the football game, that's all I care about," he 
said. "I don't care about statistics, I just want to win." . . . The Raiders 
are 4-0 against AFC West opponents. CHRIS DUFRESNE

GENETIC PARENTS GIVEN SOLE CUSTODY OF CHILD; 
</P>
<P>
SURROGATE: JUDGE RULES THAT THE WOMAN WHO BORE AN INFANT FOR AN INFERTILE 
COUPLE HAS NO RIGHTS TO THE BOY.

<P>
In a case that attracted national attention, a judge ruled Monday that 
surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson has no rights at all to the baby she bore for 
an infertile couple and granted exclusive custody to the infant's genetic 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by Orange County Superior Court Judge Richard N. Parslow Jr., 
which sprang from a highly emotional custody dispute, marked the first time in 
the nation that a judge has had to decide the rights of a surrogate mother who 
is genetically unrelated to the baby she bears. In most surrogate arrangements, 
including the famous Baby M case in New Jersey, a woman's own egg is 
artificially inseminated, so she is the child's genetic mother. 
</P>
<P>
The judge agreed with Mark and Crispina Calvert, who hired Johnson to carry 
their embryo because Crispina had had a hysterectomy, that the couple's genetic 
relationship to the baby makes them the only true parents. 
</P>
<P>
"We never set out to make history or set precedent," said Mark Calvert, 34. "We 
just wanted to have a baby. We are just so glad that we have our son." 
</P>
<P>
Parslow rejected Johnson's argument that she should be considered a legal 
mother of the 5-week-old baby boy because she gave birth to him. He said a 
surrogate who is genetically unrelated to the child she carries does not 
acquire parental rights by virtue of having given birth to it. 
</P>
<P>
Parslow said the couple should not have to share parenting with Johnson, and he 
terminated the temporary, twice-weekly visitation privileges he had granted 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
As it became clear they had won, the Calverts embraced and Crispina Calvert, 
36, wept quietly in her husband's arms. Their son's birth certificate has been 
blank since he was born Sept. 19, but the couple said they would now have his 
name -- Christopher Michael -- placed on the document. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 29, who had predicted she would lose in the trial court, was not 
present to hear the decision. She told the baby's court-appointed guardian that 
she "did not want to come to an execution." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's lawyers immediately vowed to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"When the judge screws up at the trial level, it's the baby that takes the 
fall. And he screwed up," Richard C. Gilbert said at a news conference. "No 
thinking person is going to stand for this in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a single mother of a 3-year-old daughter, said tearfully that she was 
"heartbroken." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in a deep state of mourning for my son," she told reporters. "He will 
always be my child. No matter what they call him, he will always be my 
Matthew." 
</P>
<P>
The Calverts' lawyer, Christian R. Van Deusen, hailed the decision as a triumph 
for reproductive freedom and rejected Johnson's contention that it heralds a 
trend of turning women into "incubators." 
</P>
<P>
"Males can sell their semen," he said. "Then why can't women as a matter of law 
have the right to become a nine-month foster mother by carrying another 
couple's child?" 
</P>
<P>
Parslow also ruled that surrogate contracts such as the one in this case -- in 
which an infertile couple hires a surrogate to gestate an embryo made from 
their own sperm and egg -- are legal in California and are not counter to 
public policy. No judge in California has ever ruled on the validity of any 
kind of surrogate contract. 
</P>
<P>
In a 35-minute address to a hushed, packed courtroom, Parslow said Johnson's 
role was like that of a foster parent who cares for a child while the "natural 
mother" is unable to do so. Parslow said Johnson made a "substantial 
contribution" in helping the child come into the world, but that she was an 
"intelligent" woman who signed the $10,000 surrogate contract knowingly, 
understanding she was to relinquish the child to the Calverts. 
</P>
<P>
The judge had been likened by an attorney to King Solomon, who determined which 
of two women was the true mother of a baby by threatening to cut the child in 
half. Parslow addressed that comparison in declining to declare all three 
adults the baby's legal parents. 
</P>
<P>
"In an increasingly anti-child, 'I'm-for-me-first' society, I think the 
decision I'm making in this case is definitely pro-child," Parslow said. "I 
decline, as I say, to split this child emotionally between two mothers," he 
said, adding that three-parent arrangements could result in protracted, bitter 
disagreements and "invite emotional and financial extortion." 
</P>
<P>
William G. Steiner, who was appointed as the baby's guardian to help assess the 
best interests of the child, welcomed the decision, praising Parslow for 
protecting the infant from emotional trauma. 
</P>
<P>
"The baby was the winner," Steiner said. "This baby needs a consistent figure 
in his life. He doesn't need the tension and the turmoil of being pulled 
between three people." 
</P>
<P>
Harold F. LaFlamme, the infant's court-appointed lawyer, said the decision was 
the right one. But he said it creates thorny civil rights questions for those 
who would enter into similar situations. For instance, he wondered, if a 
pregnant surrogate wanted to have an abortion, could the genetic parents 
legally stop her? If she wanted to smoke, drink or "move to New Zealand," could 
they restrict her? 
</P>
<P>
"How are we going to do that in a free society?" LaFlamme asked. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a licensed vocational nurse, sued the Calverts on Aug. 13 and sought 
custody of the baby, contending they neglected her during the pregnancy and 
would not make fit parents. She also argued that she developed a bond to the 
child that entitled her to keep him. 
</P>
<P>
The Calverts' lawyers had questioned the sincerity of that bond, noting that 
Johnson had told several people that she did not feel connected to the baby, 
and consistently represented to the Calverts that she was carrying their child. 
Parslow agreed Monday, saying there is "substantial evidence" that she never 
bonded with the infant "until she filed her lawsuit, if then." 
</P>
<P>
Parslow's decision was blasted and praised by expert observers. Ramona Ripston, 
executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern 
California, which favored a three-parent finding, said that the ruling 
"simplifies" childbirth into a "business contract" and "condones baby selling." 
Jeremy Rifkin, co-chairman of the National Coalition Against Surrogacy in 
Washington, said the decision will make it easier for rich couples and 
surrogate parenthood brokers to "solicit black and brown women" to use them as 
"breeders." 
</P>
<P>
But attorney William W. Handel, co-director of the Center for Surrogate 
Parenting in Beverly Hills, said it upholds the principle that women are 
entitled to do what they choose with their reproductive powers. New Jersey 
lawyer Gary N. Skoloff, who represented the contracting parents in the Baby M 
case and who is chairman of the American Bar Assn.'s family law section, said 
the decision preserves a valuable option for the 10% to 15% of married couples 
who cannot bear their own children. 
</P>
<P>
Parslow urged the state Legislature to pass a law permitting surrogacy, but to 
regulate it so all parties are protected. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Jim Newton contributed to this report.

<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson are expected to ask the 4th 
District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana to modify or reverse Superior Court Judge 
Richard N. Parslow's decision. The appeal process is likely to take more than a 
year. The hearing transcript must be prepared, trial briefs must be written and 
answered, and the justices might ask to hear oral arguments. Genetic parents 
Mark and Crispina Calvert now have exclusive custody of the baby. There will be 
no Superior Court hearing to determine custody or visitation rights, since 
Johnson was denied parental rights. All issues in the case will now be handled 
by the appeals court.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a cold winter morning last July, in a red-brick house on the outskirts of 
this sleepy white village, a frightened 15-year-old named Eugene Mbulawa faced 
a white police detective across a wooden desk. 
</P>
<P>
Constable Deon Oosthuizen had a pad of lined paper to take the black suspect's 
statement. Mbulawa was leaning forward with his palms touching the desk and his 
feet on the floor. His best friend, handcuffed and waiting his turn, watched 
from the side. 
</P>
<P>
The friend said the interrogation went like this: Oosthuizen would accuse the 
young activist of mayhem in Khutsong township, Mbulawa would deny it, and one 
of the police in the room would slap Mbulawa's face. 
</P>
<P>
Then a black policeman kicked Mbulawa's feet out from under him, sending the 
boy crashing to the floor, and the friend was escorted from the room. 
</P>
<P>
Soon Mbulawa was unconscious. Ten hours later, the police called an ambulance, 
telling the attendants he had had an epileptic seizure. 
</P>
<P>
Epilepsy seemed to have become a particular problem in the interrogation rooms 
at Welverdiend (pronounced VEL-ver-deen). Only six months earlier, 16-year-old 
Nixon Phiri had died of a sharp blow to the skull during questioning here. 
Police blamed that one on an epileptic fit, too. 
</P>
<P>
Mbulawa died the next day, July 13, without regaining consciousness. His 
family's attorney demanded charges against the police, but the police 
investigation instead blamed Mbulawa's friend, William Makgatje. On Sept. 20, 
Makgatje was charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
His lawyer, Tim Boyce, says, "It's an absolute joke to charge this kid, the 
prime witness against the police. What amazes me is why they waited 2 1/2 
months to charge him if he inflicted the blows while the police watched." 
</P>
<P>
As the world knows, South Africa has changed dramatically in the year since 
President Frederik W. de Klerk launched the most sweeping reforms in his 
country's history. Apartheid laws are falling, and one-time antagonists are 
talking to each other across the racial divide. 
</P>
<P>
But while South Africa may be on the road to reform, the short life and times 
of Eugene Mbulawa and Nixon Phiri make it clear that some whites are not on 
board. 
</P>
<P>
For all the world headlines and all the promises from the white-led government, 
the average black South African in rural areas like this, only an hour's drive 
from reform planners in the capital Pretoria, has seen precious little change. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights lawyers contend that hundreds of black activists in areas where 
protest marches are banned and forcibly broken up by police have been arrested 
and brutally questioned since De Klerk's reforms took effect. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never been busier," said Hanif Vally, a Johannesburg attorney who 
represents the Phiri family and political activists throughout rural areas of 
the Transvaal and Orange Free State provinces. "The feeling I get is that a 
number of policemen are unhappy with the reform process and they're creating an 
unstable situation. Torture still seems to be standard procedure, especially in 
Welverdiend." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen at police headquarters in Pretoria deny this. 
</P>
<P>
"Torture is totally unacceptable. It's not our policy to torture suspects in 
whatever case," said Capt. Craig Kotze, spokesman for Law and Order Minister 
Adriaan Vlok. 
</P>
<P>
And Vlok said in a speech last month that police who break laws "are duly 
punished. We are not prepared to allow policemen to break the law and then 
cover it up." 
</P>
<P>
But the Mbulawa and Phiri cases are not the only ones this year in which black 
youths are alleged to have been beaten in the Welverdiend house, which serves 
as headquarters for three black and two white plainclothes detectives in the 
riot investigation unit. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen youngsters from Khutsong and Ikageng townships, ranging in age from 15 
to 20, said in interviews with The Times that they have been tortured here over 
the past two years and as recently as last month. Their attorneys have written 
Vlok and even De Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Charges So Far 
</P>
<P>
But so far the police investigations have not led to any suspension or charge 
against officers at Welverdiend. 
</P>
<P>
Warrant Officer J.G. van Graan, head of the Welverdiend unit, attributes the 
allegations to "some blacks (who) don't like us." His superior, Col. H. E. 
Austen, says he is not aware of even a single torture allegation against Van 
Graan or his officers. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, we've got no problem with Welverdiend," said Austen, 
who oversees 250 criminal investigators in the western Transvaal. 
</P>
<P>
Transvaal Atty. Gen. Donald Brunette takes a dim view generally of torture 
allegations made against police officers by black suspects. 
</P>
<P>
"It's written in Marx's books. It's written in Lenin's books," Brunette said. 
"You must discredit your security forces. It's part of the tactic of 
revolution. And we've had this from the ANC for 30 years now." 
</P>
<P>
And, besides, he added, "No policeman is going to be so stupid as to just kill 
a guy in a police station. There are a whole lot better places to kill him." 
</P>
<P>
For months now, the riot police have had their hands full in Khutsong, a 
sprawling, trash-strewn township of 60,000 that sits on a treeless plain 
between Welverdiend, about 10 miles west, and the conservative mining town of 
Carletonville, 5 miles east. 
</P>
<P>
The police have cracked down on political protests, especially in the schools, 
and some Khutsong youngsters have responded with fury, burning cars and homes, 
attacking police vehicles and black policemen. 
</P>
<P>
The youngsters consider themselves loyal soldiers of the African National 
Congress' military wing, but they feel no obligation to abide by the peace 
agreements between De Klerk and ANC leader Nelson Mandela in the face of 
continuing state oppression in their township. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Mbulawa grew up in a comfortable four-room home in Khutsong, better off 
financially than many because his stepfather had a good job as a bakery driver. 
Mbulawa and his 7-year-old brother, Mpumelelo, shared the back bedroom. A small 
chicken coop in the back yard guaranteed their early rising. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, Mbulawa had been politically active, and he regularly 
clashed with police. Van Graan, the Welverdiend unit commander, remembers 
Mbulawa as "a cheeky kid . . . who gave us so much trouble." 
</P>
<P>
A classmate at Tswasongu Secondary School, Arnold Gcuku, says Mbulawa and his 
friends "were famous." They considered themselves ANC freedom fighters, and 
they named themselves the "Kadafi gang," after Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi, 
one of Mandela's friends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Him 'Castro' 
</P>
<P>
Mbulawa was mesmerized, as are so many black South African youngsters, by 
revolutionary politics. He spoke so often of Fidel Castro's achievements in 
Cuba that his comrades gave him the nickname "Castro." 
</P>
<P>
At first, the violence in Khutsong pitted the radical youngsters against the 
police. But the police got some help in June, when an airplane dropped hundreds 
of leaflets on the township. The leaflets promised a 5,000-rand (about $2,000) 
reward for help in arresting troublemakers. 
</P>
<P>
Black vigilante groups soon began going door-to-door. Mbulawa's mother sent her 
son to stay with relatives, and twice she turned away vigilantes armed with 
knives and guns who came looking for Eugene. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, though, the vigilantes and the radicals agreed to peace talks. 
On July 10, as the two groups were leaving in vans for talks in Johannesburg, 
the police stopped them and arrested Mbulawa, Makgatje and 21 other township 
youths. 
</P>
<P>
The detainees were taken to the police lockup at Carletonville. They said they 
were forced into the prison showers, with their clothes on, and drenched in 
cold water. They received no blankets or towels for the night. 
</P>
<P>
Early the next morning, Constable Oosthuizen and two black police detectives 
took the 23 suspects to Welverdiend. 
</P>
<P>
"We were scared," one of them, Shadrack Golotine, said later, "because we knew 
that some of our comrades had been killed in Welverdiend." 
</P>
<P>
The Welverdiend house, a branch office of the criminal investigations unit, was 
known among young activists as the "torture camp." It is a square four-room 
house, with a paved sidewalk leading up to a partially enclosed front porch. 
Inside is a kitchen, a bathroom and three offices. Photographs of wanted black 
suspects are affixed to a bulletin board in the foyer. 
</P>
<P>
The detainees were put in corrugated-iron shacks next to the house, and four of 
them were led inside. Golotine ended up in a room decorated with Nelson Mandela 
T-shirts and ANC flags, items confiscated in May when police raided a Khutsong 
house, killing three black activists. 
</P>
<P>
"They said if we didn't tell them the truth, we'd end up like the owners of 
those flags and T-shirts," said Golotine, 17. 
</P>
<P>
Golotine said his hands were tied behind his back, a cloth sack was placed over 
his head and he was made to lie on the floor. A policeman placed wires on his 
wrists, and later on his genitals, delivering electric shocks, apparently with 
a hand-cranked generator, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They accused me of burning people and vehicles," Golotine said. "When I denied 
it, they shocked me. It was painful. My body was shaking. I ended up admitting 
to things I had not done." 
</P>
<P>
Only the four youths were interrogated that day, and everyone was later 
returned to the cells in Carletonville. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, Mbulawa, Makgatje and four others were taken back to 
Welverdiend. William Fantein, a 16-year-old in the group, remembers that 
Oosthuizen described Mbulawa as "my customer." 
</P>
<P>
At about 9 a.m., Mbulawa and Makgatje were taken into the house. Makgatje said 
he was questioned in a separate room about several cars and houses that had 
been burned in the township. During the questioning, he said, he was assaulted 
with a baton and kicked and punched. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Hear Screams 
</P>
<P>
Later, Makgatje was taken into the office where officers were interrogating 
Mbulawa. After witnessing part of the attack on Mbulawa, Makgatje was taken for 
more questioning in another room, where he could hear Mbulawa's screams. 
</P>
<P>
When Makgatje was brought back he found Mbulawa on the floor with his arms 
across his chest. His friend's eyes and mouth were open, but he was unconscious 
and making a snoring sound. 
</P>
<P>
The officers dragged Mbulawa back to the outdoor cells at about 10 a.m. Other 
detainees tried without success to revive him. 
</P>
<P>
At 7 p.m., the police ordered the detainees to carry Mbulawa to a truck for the 
trip back to Carletonville. Later that night, an ambulance took Mbulawa to the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Josephine Neku, saw him the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't recognize him at first," Neku said, brushing tears from her eyes. "He 
was all swollen up. His chin was swollen, his teeth were loose. I saw he was 
not going to be alive again." 
</P>
<P>
The 22 other detainees appeared in a Carletonville court the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Boyce, their attorney, remembers that "a number had visible (facial) 
injuries from questioning and the injuries were all very similar." At Boyce's 
request, the judge noted the injuries and the allegation that Welverdiend 
policemen were responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Makgatje and five others were charged with malicious damage to property and 
released. Eugene Mbulawa, although still in the hospital, also was named on 
that charge sheet. He died that evening. 
</P>
<P>
Makgatje gave statements to his attorneys, and they wrote the government 
demanding an independent investigation. But 10 weeks later, on Sept. 19, 
Makgatje was arrested again and questioned for several hours by a police 
detective about Mbulawa's death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charged With Murder 
</P>
<P>
Makgatje, a small, thin 16-year-old, said later that he told the investigator 
how the police had beaten his friend. But the investigator didn't taken any 
notes. Instead, he said the police blamed Makgatje. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Makgatje was charged with murdering Mbulawa by "slapping or 
hitting him with clenched fists." He was released to his family and a Nov. 7 
court date was set. 
</P>
<P>
"When a youngster is arrested in perfect health on a Tuesday and dies in police 
custody on a Friday, they've got to explain how it happened," Boyce, Makgatje's 
lawyer, said later. "Short of admitting they did it, they have to say the 
inmates did it." 
</P>
<P>
The state autopsy concludes that Mbulawa died of a brain hemorrhage caused by a 
single blow to the head. But a veteran pathologist who has seen the report said 
it was very unlikely that a hand or fist could have caused the fatal injury. A 
boot or shoe was more likely, said the doctor, who asked not to be identified 
by name. 
</P>
<P>
The Welverdiend unit and the officer investigating Mbulawa's death both report 
to Col. Austen, who said in an interview that he is satisfied that the case 
"has been thoroughly investigated." 
</P>
<P>
In a written reply to questions from The Times, police headquarters in Pretoria 
said, "There is no . . . evidence that the deceased (Mbulawa) had been tortured 
by the police." It added that the police "emphatically deny that they assaulted 
or tortured the deceased." 
</P>
<P>
Oosthuizen, 22, who was transferred to Welverdiend several months ago from the 
riot squad in Pretoria, said he could not comment without Austen's permission. 
About the allegations of torture, however, he said: "As far as I'm concerned 
it's not true. But let's leave it there." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Mbulawa, Nixon Phiri was not a well-known township activist. 
</P>
<P>
He had grown up on a white-owned vegetable farm about 10 miles from Khutsong. 
His mother, Maria, still works on the farm, pulling weeds. She and her three 
younger children share two 5-by-7-foot rooms with no running water or 
electricity. Her employers provide the rooms and food, including two servings 
of meat a week, and a monthly salary of 70 rand ($28). 
</P>
<P>
Nixon moved off the farm two years ago and was living with Mrs. Phiri's sister, 
Grace, in a metal shack in a Khutsong squatter camp. 
</P>
<P>
Phiri and some friends were arrested in the camp about noon on Jan. 16 and 
taken to Welverdiend, where several dozen detainees were waiting in the kitchen 
to be questioned by Van Graan and his officers. One by one, the suspects were 
led to the interrogation rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Door Was Closed 
</P>
<P>
Phiri and his friends were accused of burning a van in the township. Thomas 
Tshabalala, 16, told lawyers later that he was punched, kicked and shocked into 
signing a confession. After Tshabalala was returned to the kitchen, he said, 
two policemen told Phiri to remove his shirt and he was taken into another room 
and the door was closed. 
</P>
<P>
Tshabalala and another youth, Ismael Booysens, said in separate statements that 
they heard Phiri screaming and his body hitting the floor. At one point, both 
said, Phiri screamed: "Hasena!" -- It's not me. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after that, Booysens saw two officers take Phiri outside, where water 
was splashed on his face. Phiri was returned to the interrogation room and 
Booysens remembered hearing a scream, then silence. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Phiri identified her son's body at a mortuary that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
In February, attorney Hanif Vally wrote President de Klerk to request a 
judicial investigation into Phiri's death. Two weeks later, Tshabalala was 
killed during police action to quell township unrest, and Booysens went into 
hiding. 
</P>
<P>
In June, De Klerk wrote Vally, saying he was "satisfied that the death of Nixon 
Phiri will be investigated . . . in an unbiased manner and that justice will 
prevail." 
</P>
<P>
The official police investigation, again conducted by one of Col. Austen's men, 
was completed last month, nine months after the death. 
</P>
<P>
Two policemen, one black and one white, had been questioning Phiri that day, 
according to the police report. The officers said Phiri had become "nervous and 
agitated" and began talking incoherently. Then, they said, "he suddenly started 
shaking . . . and fell off a chair against a steel cabinet." 
</P>
<P>
The officers said they tried mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, "but he died." They 
denied any assault and the police report, written in Afrikaans, said that all 
the other police in the unit "support this story." 
</P>
<P>
The police investigator also said Phiri's mother and aunt signed statements 
saying that Nixon had suffered epileptic attacks "from when he was a small 
boy." 
</P>
<P>
"We've got no case against anyone on that evidence," said Brunette, the 
Transvaal attorney general. He added, however, that an inquest is being 
scheduled and "the court will decide." 
</P>
<P>
The police report did not tell the whole story of Nixon Phiri's death, however. 
</P>
<P>
Phiri's mother and aunt, in separate interviews with The Times, said Nixon had 
not been ill or seen a doctor since he had a brief period of chest pains at age 
2. They said the police had insisted that Nixon had epilepsy and they felt 
pressured to agree. 
</P>
<P>
"We were scared of them (the police)," Maria Phiri said. She and her sister 
signed the statements, which they could not read, with thumb prints. 
</P>
<P>
A private autopsy conducted by Dr. Jonathan Gluckman found numerous abrasions 
and bruises on Phiri's body. The largest of three bruises on his skull was 
about the size of a cassette tape. 
</P>
<P>
Gluckman, widely known for his post-mortem of black consciousness leader Steve 
Biko, who died in police custody in 1977, said the cause of Nixon Phiri's death 
was a brain hemorrhage "associated with external injuries." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be very, very surprised if an epileptic seizure caused all those 
injuries," Gluckman said later. "I'd say he was very badly beaten up." 
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, Van Graan was standing in the sunshine outside his 
headquarters, the Welverdiend house where Eugene Mbulawa and Nixon Phiri 
suffered their fatal injuries. A sprinkler was watering the lawn and just 
inside the front door of the quiet house lay a single brown shoe. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-year police veteran, a slightly built man with a deeply lined face and 
gray hair, admitted that he is worried about the allegations against him and 
his men. But, he said, "They've been saying that for years." 
</P>
<P>
Then he added: "I am not a monster."

HUMPHREY THE WHALE IS BACK, BUT BEACHED 
</P>

<P>
A whale scientists identified as Humphrey, the errant humpback whose 1985 
odyssey through the Sacramento River Delta captured widespread attention, 
fought for his life late Monday after beaching himself in San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
During a day of high drama, the humpback struggled free after beaching himself 
in the morning near Candlestick Park, only to re-beach himself during the 
afternoon off nearby Hunter's Point. 
</P>
<P>
By nightfall, when the tide ebbed, the whale was left "high and dry," said 
marine biologist Marc Webber. "He's in a bad predicament now. We hope to have 
enough water to refloat him about 3 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
Marine biologists from the California Marine Mammal Center threw wet blankets 
onto the disoriented creature in a desperate attempt to keep him from 
overheating or becoming dehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-ton mammal's internal organs could be crushed by his own weight if he 
does not move back into the sea, Webber said. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Balcomb, a marine biologist who assisted in Humphrey's rescue five years 
ago and has sighted the animal every year since off the Farallon Islands, made 
the identification Monday after viewing distinctive markings on the whale's 
flukes. Scientists say the underside of a humpback's tail bears a unique 
pattern much like a human fingerprint. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether scientists had determined what was wrong with the whale, Balcomb 
said: "It's usual Humphrey behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Since his first foray into the bay, Humphrey has exhibited an affinity for 
shallow waters, and last year even swam into Bodega Bay, north of San 
Francisco, without incident. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he's sick. I think he was feeding, or that was his plan, 
anyway," Balcomb said after viewing the whale from a boat. 
</P>
<P>
While scientists said Humphrey could survive until high tide early this 
morning, they expressed concern about his lethargic and unresponsive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Although smaller California gray whales frequently wander into the bay, this is 
only the second time a humpback is known to have strayed. The first also was 
Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
The whale's appearance in mud flats south of the stadium snarled rush-hour 
traffic on the Bayshore Freeway because of rubbernecking motorists. Within 
hours, a small armada of Coast Guard and other vessels was mobilized to track 
the mammal. Hundreds of gawkers and whale lovers from throughout the Bay Area 
converged on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first saw him, we thought he was dead," said a California Highway 
Patrol officer who arrived shortly after the mammal was sighted. "But then he 
would flap his fins every once in a while to let us know he was alive." 
</P>
<P>
Piegin Barrett, head of the marine mammal center in Sausalito, said rescuers 
were obtaining sound recordings of humpback whales that were used to rescue 
Humphrey five years ago in an attempt to lure the whale to deeper waters. As in 
the first rescue of Humphrey, the Navy joined the effort, this time providing a 
special underwater amplifier for the sounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Humphrey has gotten himself out of some pretty tight places before," said Mary 
Jane Schramm, a spokeswoman for the marine mammal center. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, scientists had dismissed the possibility that the whale was 
Humphrey, noting that there are perhaps 300 humpbacks who feed in local waters 
each summer and fall. "If this is Humphrey, he should know better," said marine 
biologist Patrick Brady. 
</P>
<P>
By noon, onlookers had swelled to about 500 as workers in nearby South San 
Francisco office buildings flocked to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"Whales are awesome, and this is cheaper than going out into a boat to see 
them," said Jim McDaniel, a software salesman for GSI Transcomm. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the terrible things that are happening -- the budget mess, the gulf 
crisis, AIDS -- it is heartening to come out here and see something natural and 
beautiful," said Elizabeth Jackson of the McCaffrey &amp; McCall advertising 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Dan Morain and researcher Norma Kaufman in San Francisco 
contributed to this story.

SCIENTISTS ELATED AS RARE SHARK IS RELEASED IN SEA;

MARINE LIFE: ONLY THE FIFTH MEGAMOUTH EVER FOUND APPEARS HEALTHY. IMPLANTED

<P>
After more than a day in captivity, a mysterious species of shark -- described 
as a living fossil -- slipped back into the sea Monday after elated researchers 
videotaped it underwater and implanted radio transmitters to track its 
movements. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-foot megamouth shark is the first to survive after being brought to 
shore, and the only one in the world to be filmed and studied alive, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Caught accidentally in a fisherman's gill net off Dana Point early Sunday, the 
bronze-colored fish with a cavernous jaw and bulbous head seemed healthy and 
strong when it was released a mile off Dana Point Harbor on Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a bit sad to see him go, but I'm really elated," said Bob Lavenberg, an 
ichthyologist and curator of fishes at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural 
History, who was first to identify the fish and coordinated the research. 
</P>
<P>
"This was an opportunity to get knowledge about a really rare fish and an 
opportunity to be environmentally sensitive at the same time by putting the 
fish back where he belongs," Lavenberg said. "It's the best of both worlds. He 
couldn't be better. And now we can get some real science done." 
</P>
<P>
One of the largest sharks in the world, the megamouth, with its large round 
head and whale-like appearance, is intriguing to scientists because its bizarre 
looks are so different from other sharks and extremely little is known about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The male caught Sunday, dubbed Mega, is only the fifth megamouth to be caught 
or found since the species was discovered off Hawaii 14 years ago. Researchers 
believe they can now glean enough information to better understand the exotic 
species. 
</P>
<P>
Lavenberg described the shark as a "living fossil," a life form that has 
evolved slowly, deep in the ocean. "This species is at least 10 million years 
old, and it has changed very little," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Underwater photographers working with the museum and the National Geographic 
Society were awed by what they saw, surfacing with vivid descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
"When you swim right up to it, you know you're seeing something different. It 
has gigantic eyes and big rubbery black lips," said Michael de Gruy, who has 
been filming a documentary on sharks for National Geographic for two years. 
"It's massive, with big, lumbering movements." 
</P>
<P>
The fish, which only eats plankton, seemed docile, letting divers touch it, 
even its mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"He would sort of flinch when people touched him, and his eyes would shift. 
When I swam to his side, he turned and looked at me," said Mark Dell' Aquila, 
an underwater photographer hired by the museum. 
</P>
<P>
The ocean off Dana Point Harbor took on a carnival-like atmosphere as curious 
people and members of the media in boats encircled the shark, which was tied by 
its tail to the Moonshiner, the boat that caught it. Several people dived into 
the water for a closer look, while a noisy TV helicopter hovered above and jet 
skiers roared in close. 
</P>
<P>
"What a circus!" Lavenberg said. "Only in California can they turn this into a 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
Otto Elliott, a commercial fisherman and skipper of the 38-foot Moonshiner, 
said he caught the megamouth in his gill net about seven miles offshore about 
2:30 a.m. Sunday while fishing for swordfish. He had to slice open his $5,000 
net to keep the shark alive, but said he did so because he knew he had 
accidentally caught a rare, bizarre treasure. 
</P>
<P>
A diver with a dart gun implanted two radio transmitters into the fish, which 
will tell scientists how deep and how far offshore it lives. A one-inch square 
of muscle was cut out of its hide near its dorsal fin so scientists can compare 
it with tissue from other well-known sharks to see how the species are related.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; 
</P>
<P>
FEINSTEIN SAYS WILSON DEMEANS HER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic candidate for governor Dianne Feinstein, contending that her 
opponent Pete Wilson has "gone out of his way to demean me," defended her 
tenure as San Francisco's mayor and suggested Monday that Wilson would add 
nothing more than "hot air" to the battle against crime. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, appearing by satellite for an Anaheim audience two hours before 
Feinstein spoke in Los Angeles, showed no inclination to ease his criticism. To 
several hundred members of the League of California Cities, he contended that 
Feinstein's advocacy of state and regional solutions to problems would add to 
the mounting difficulties faced by cities. 
</P>
<P>
Both Republican Wilson and Democrat Feinstein have reached back to their 
tenures as mayors of San Diego and San Francisco, respectively, to give voters 
reason to cast ballots for them. And each has found some ammunition to fire at 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's remarks, made at the Biltmore Hotel to 450 members of the local 
Town Hall, were intended to refute a Wilson campaign commercial that has been 
running for nearly two weeks. In it, he says Feinstein raised taxes in San 
Francisco and left behind a massive deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, she said. "Every one of my nine budgets was balanced. And my last 
budget, which closed out six months after I left office, did so with a 
$16.2-million surplus," Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Moving aggressively on the matter of crime, Feinstein cited Federal Bureau of 
Investigation statistics that show that crime rose 25% during Wilson's time as 
mayor of San Diego. It fell 27% in San Francisco during her two terms there -- 
although she acknowledged that the crime rate was higher to begin with in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was relevant, she said, because "we've already had eight years of a 
governor who thought he could fight crime with tough talk, and the result has 
been more serial murders, more drive-by shootings, more gangs, more automatic 
weapons. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Dope pushers and gang members don't listen to the hot air of politicians," she 
said. "They listen to the sound of jail doors closing behind them." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein supports Proposition 133, an initiative authored by her running mate, 
Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, which would raise the sales tax by a half-cent to 
earmark $7.5 billion over four years to fight drugs and crime. Wilson once said 
he might very well vote for the measure, but he has since come out against it. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't fight a war on drugs unless you're willing to fund a war on drugs," 
Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein indicated that she believes Wilson was knocking her record in order 
to boost himself. 
</P>
<P>
"My opponent, Mr. Wilson, has gone out of his way to demean me, I think in 
order to puff himself up," she said. Wilson had been scheduled to address the 
League of California Cities convention in person, but had to stay in Washington 
after negotiations to settle the long-delayed federal budget faltered over the 
weekend. Appearing over two projection screens in the darkened Anaheim 
Convention Center, he opened his remarks by making light of his location. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't fully appreciate just how much I wish I were with you, rather than 
here in exile," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In his address, Wilson tried to reinforce his characterization of Feinstein as 
a tool of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown of San Francisco. At one point, he 
referred to the duo as "Dianne who would be governor and Willie who would be 
regent." 
</P>
<P>
And Wilson, a 24-year veteran of public office, said he would protect cities 
from the "overreaching" of state and federal governments. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to change the attitude that Sacramento knows best," he said. "It will 
require a clear, a determined and an energetic leadership of an activist 
governor -- and I'm going to be just that." 
</P>
<P>
Repeating his frequent pledge to reform the state's budgeting process, Wilson 
said that he would veto any attempt by legislators to make demands on local 
officials unless the state provided the money. 
</P>
<P>
The senator, in a gibe at Feinstein's proposed growth-management program, said 
he would veto any effort to impose "a new and unneeded layer of regional 
government to second-guess the land-use decisions of local elected officials." 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson did call on the state to ensure that new developments do not unduly 
damage one city while benefiting another. 
</P>
<P>
"Location of a new shopping center, or a new factory, or a new community 
college campus should not place all the revenue and benefit on one side of a 
political boundary," he said, "and all the traffic congestion and housing and 
tax burden on the other side." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, in her remarks to the Town Hall group in Los Angeles, said her 
regionally based growth-management plan would "preserve the quality of life 
that makes us so proud to be Californians." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Feinstein has pledged to try to push new growth into 
less-populated areas of the state, to develop rail and transportation systems 
that can link distant areas and limit freeway congestion, and to integrate jobs 
and housing into the same areas to reduce commuting time.

HE TAMES BLACK'S BEACH BLUFF INTO 'STEVE'S TRAIL' 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Simms stands on a dusty bluff overlooking Black's Beach, gazing down 340 
feet of twisting, tortuous trail that over the years has thrown as big a 
challenge at surfers as the gnarly waves below. 
</P>
<P>
As his eyes squint through a morning haze, Simms does not see a dangerous path 
along which dozens of daring beach-goers have been seriously injured attempting 
to scale its steep-sloped terrain. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he sees a beloved improvement project taking shape above the scenic La 
Jolla shores. He sees the hundreds of bulky bricks, 2-by-4s, iron pipes and 
heavy sacks of concrete he has hauled down the winding trail like a two-legged 
packhorse. 
</P>
<P>
He sees the sections of his sturdy wooden steps, handrails and metal drainage 
pipes that have made the path a much safer way to reach the famous nudist beach 
-- a popular gathering spot for surfers and natural sunbathers throughout 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Simms smiles. What he sees is a much-improved access many locals now 
affectionately call "Steve's Trail." 
</P>
<P>
"See that section right down there?" he says, pointing to a wood-and-concrete 
set of steps that includes a lookout point to the beach below. "That's the one 
I'm most proud of." 
</P>
<P>
For five years, the San Diego part-time carpenter has donated his time, money 
and sweat to improve the trail that is used by tens of thousands of beach 
enthusiasts each year. 
</P>
<P>
When he is not hammering nails, mixing concrete, smoothing blacktop and grading 
wood, the 39-year-old scours local building sites looking for donations of 
materials. Simms peers inside dumpsters in search of usable bricks, scrap metal 
or pipes -- anything to keep construction on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
At night, though he says he has a home, the self-professed loner often prefers 
to sleep outdoors in one of the gullies near his creation, sharing campfires 
and six-packs of beer with the area's homeless population. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his trail has become a controversial undertaking, admired by some 
beach-goers, criticized by others. The project proceeds under the watchful eye 
of city officials who will neither condemn Simms' work nor help him in his 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago, when I started construction, I called the city to tell them 
what I was doing," Simms said, angling down the cliffside with a shovel slung 
over his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"They were all too busy to call me back. So I decided to just go ahead and get 
it done." 
</P>
<P>
Terri Williams, deputy city parks and recreation director, said that while the 
unstable trail was officially closed a decade ago, Simms' work has been so 
solid that city officials have decided to look the other way. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not going to be congratulated or taken before the City Council for any 
awards," she said. "But his trail is certainly an improvement over any other 
access for people who go to that beach at their own risk." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities acknowledge that in the last decade more than two dozen injuries -- 
and a few deaths -- have resulted from people slipping along precarious trails 
while scaling the unstable cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
At Black's Beach, the sentiment over Steve's Trail is divided. 
</P>
<P>
"Is Steve going to take responsibility if somebody falls and breaks his neck?" 
said Joe Bill, manager of the adjacent Torrey Flight Park, a popular 
hang-glider launching area. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of us around here would like to see him stop his work and go on his 
merry way." 
</P>
<P>
Regulars say the trail has changed the demographics of the beach. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the beach was so inaccessible that nude sunbathers as well as a 
large gay population could lounge in privacy. The city did not see the need to 
enforce a no-nudity law on a beach that few people could reach. 
</P>
<P>
Now, that all may change as families and tourists begin gawking as they take 
the Black's Beach tour, locals say. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, I marvel every time I use that trail," said beach regular Al Spencer. 
"It's really a solid piece of engineering, a labor of love. I think most people 
appreciate what he's done." 
</P>
<P>
Surfers complain that the once-isolated beach is becoming too accessible. They 
claim that their beach is crowded with beginning surfers -- geeks, goons and 
kooks, they call them -- and other undesirables. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, why does he do it?" one surfer asked. "Why doesn't he just leave the 
trail alone? Doesn't he have anything better to do?" 
</P>
<P>
Joe Moberg, a homeless man who has helped Simms with his work, had a possible 
answer: "Sometimes people just do things, they take up a cause. Well, this is 
Steve's cause. Day and night."

TRIAL OF LA JOLLA SOCIALITE IN 2 SLAYINGS BEGINS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: BOTH SIDES AGREE THAT THE SUSPECT KILLED HER EX-HUSBAND AND HIS NEW 
WIFE. BUT DID SHE SHOOT THEM IN HATRED OR IN FRIGHT?

<P>
Both sides in the long-anticipated murder trial of La Jolla socialite Elisabeth 
Anne (Betty) Broderick agreed in opening remarks Monday that she fatally shot 
her ex-husband and his new wife in their bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
But while the prosecution argued that the killing was the deliberate act of a 
woman consumed by hate, Broderick's defense attorneys said it was committed by 
a woman made emotionally destitute by a bitter divorce and custody dispute that 
left her without her four children. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick, the defense argued, entered the home only to confront her 
ex-husband and had no intention of shooting anyone but herself. The shots were 
fired, the defense said, only when Broderick was startled by her husband's 
shouts. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick, 42, is charged with two counts of murder in the deaths last Nov. 5 
of her ex-husband, Daniel T. Broderick III, and his new wife, Linda Kolkena 
Broderick. 
</P>
<P>
She has pleaded innocent and has been held without bail at County Jail in Las 
Colinas since last November. If convicted, she could be sentenced to life in 
prison without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
When she fired the fatal shots, she felt "every emotion a person could probably 
feel -- fear, depression, anger and hurt," her attorney, Jack Earley, said in 
his opening remarks. "What you see is a person who hurts, with no self-esteem, 
no way of dealing with problems, someone who was acting on emotions thrust on 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Broderick brushed away tears as Earley told the jury of her plight. 
</P>
<P>
She had stared straight ahead and ignored the jury as Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry 
Wells painted a different picture, telling jurors that the defendant's "hatred 
for Daniel Broderick became the absolute focus of her life," an obsession that 
resulted in two cold and calculated murders. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no way (Betty) was going to let them live happily ever after," Wells 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Broderick was a prominent medical malpractice lawyer and a former county 
bar president. 
</P>
<P>
During and after their divorce, Broderick accused her husband of using his 
legal influence to cheat her out of her fair share of his seven-figure income. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's wealth and the highly publicized accusations surrounding their 
divorce drew to the trial people planning a TV movie, a journalist writing a 
book, and a Ladies' Home Journal writer focusing on the "trauma" of a 
middle-aged woman. Representatives from the TV programs "Hard Copy" and 
"Current Affair" are expected later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
It also drew more than 100 would-be spectators, including dozens of women who 
said they identified with the defendant and dozens more simply attracted to the 
theatrics of a prominent murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Wells said that killing Daniel Broderick had been an act that his 
ex-wife had been "talking about, thinking about, deliberating over for a long, 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
She had married him because he was "going to be a moneymaker," Wells said. When 
he finally began making big money in the mid-1980s but then began the process 
of divorcing her, she felt "she was being gypped." 
</P>
<P>
And as for Linda Broderick, Wells said, she "had what (Betty Broderick) still 
felt belonged to her, and only her, and she hated her for it." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks before the killings, Wells said, Betty Broderick told a housekeeper, 
"I'm either going to make (Daniel Broderick's) life a living hell or I'm going 
to kill him." 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 5, she entered the house with her daughter's keys, Wells said, climbed 
the stairs, entered the bedroom and began shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The first shot hit Linda Broderick in the chest, Wells said. The second hit 
Daniel Broderick in the back. The third and fourth missed. The fifth hit Linda 
Broderick in the back of the head and killed her instantly, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Broderick "essentially was left to suffocate in his own blood and die," 
Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick then ripped a phone out of the wall, left the house, called 
friends and, on the advice of a lawyer, surrendered later that morning, Wells 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But, Earley argued, the case was just not that simple. 
</P>
<P>
When Betty Broderick entered the house, she sought only to talk to her 
ex-husband, who had alternately harassed her, intimidated her and, worst of 
all, ignored her during the divorce -- all part of a calculated campaign to 
marry Linda Kolkena and convince Betty Broderick she was crazy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick's intent, Earley said, was to kill herself if she couldn't talk 
to her ex-husband. But, as she stood before the victims' bed, she heard a yell, 
"Call the police!" and saw her ex-husband reach for the phone. 
</P>
<P>
Startled, Betty began firing wildly, Earley said.

GULF WATCH: DAY 82; 
</P>
<P>
A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
HOSTAGE FRONT: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The head of a Iraqi-American group said that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein 
pledged in a weekend meeting to release some sick and elderly American 
hostages. As many as 57 Americans reportedly could be affected. 
</P>
<P>
There was no confirmation of a possible release from the State Department, 
however. U.S. officials noted that two more Americans and seven Britons were 
detained in Kuwait over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Former British Prime Minister Edward Heath, who visited Hussein over the 
weekend, said that Baghdad has promised to release some ailing and elderly 
British hostages today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Australian sailors boarded an Iraqi-flagged vessel in the Gulf of Oman 
but allowed it to proceed to Yemen after a search revealed it was no longer 
carrying prohibited cargo, military officials said. The vessel, which Sunday 
ignored warning shots, had been loaded with steel and plywood. U.S. officials 
said that the cargo must have been dumped overboard. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Iraq has captured some of Kuwait's cache of 
U.S.-made Hawk anti-aircraft missiles and apparently is trying to learn how to 
use the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economic Front: 
</P>
<P>
The price of oil plunged $5 a barrel in hectic and panicky New York trading. 
Analysts attributed the drop to optimism caused by reports of Iraq moving 
troops away from the Saudi border and by Iraq's promise that it will release 
some British hostages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crisis Indicators: 
</P>
<P>
* Americans trapped in Kuwait and Iraq: 700 to 800 
</P>
<P>
* Americans rounded up, detained: 106 
</P>
<P>
* Seriously ill Americans held: 69 
</P>
<P>
* Total Western hostages: 5,000

DEFIANT IRAQI SHIP DUMPS PROHIBITED CARGO AT SEA; 
</P>
<P>
EMBARGO: THE VESSEL IGNORED WARNING SHOTS IN AN EARLIER CONFRONTATION. THIS 
TIME, IT'S PERMITTED TO SAIL ON TO YEMEN.

<P>
A tense confrontation in the Persian Gulf ended Monday when an embargo-busting 
Iraqi vessel stopped defying American warning shots and was discovered to have 
quietly dumped its prohibited cargo at sea. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise conclusion to the standoff came after U.S. and Australian warships 
maneuvered to force the Iraqi vessel to a halt, then dispatched an armed 
boarding party to its decks. 
</P>
<P>
But the sailors found no trace of the steel and plywood that had been aboard 
the merchant ship when it was first searched Saturday. It was permitted to 
continue on toward Yemen because it was no longer in violation of a 
U.N.-imposed trade embargo, military officials here said. 
</P>
<P>
The case of the vanishing Iraqi contraband ended a confrontation that began 
Saturday afternoon, when the Iraqi vessel Al Bahar al Arabi was boarded and 
Coast Guard inspectors discovered it was carrying steel pipe and plywood. The 
cargo is banned under the U.N. embargo. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi captain promised to return to Iraq, but instead later continued 
defiantly southward, ignoring the 40 warning shots fired across its bow through 
the day Sunday by the U.S. destroyer O'Brien. The captain made clear by radio 
that he did not intend to turn back. 
</P>
<P>
An Italian frigate shadowed the vessel Sunday night as Western navies set a 
trap. Early Monday afternoon, the trap was sprung when the Australian and 
American warships -- in a tactic not previously used in the interception 
operation -- veered in front and forced the ship to halt. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials said the warships had expected they would have to force the 
Iraqi vessel to pull into a port to unload its cargo. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of resistance, the boarding party found cooperation -- and empty 
holds. Military officials said that the warships had no option but to permit 
the vessel to continue toward the Yemeni port of Aden, its announced 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
A military spokesman in Saudi Arabia, Cmdr. J. D. Van Sickle, said the Navy 
"could only assume" the cargo was "pitched over the side" between the first and 
second boardings. Despite the confusion in the operation, he pointed to it as 
an indication of the continuing success in preventing Iraqi goods from reaching 
foreign ports. 
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi official quoted by the Iraqi news agency praised the ship's captain 
for ignoring the U.S. warning. He said the "provocative" action was an 
indication of the "nature of the American aggressor and his allies and their 
failure in imposing sanctions on Iraq."

VETO HURTS GOP, RIGHTS ACTIVISTS SAY;

George Bush's veto of major civil rights legislation Monday could cost him 
support among blacks and undermine his party's attempts to woo black voters, 
civil rights activists said. 
</P>
<P>
Some black Republicans reacted with intense personal disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Dibble -- a Republican most of his 62 years and a lonely black voice 
singing the praises of Bush and raising money for GOP candidates in heavily 
Democratic Chicago -- said that he is embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me very uncomfortable to have these two or three pictures of 
President and Mrs. Bush sitting on my desk," Dibble, a businessman, said. "I 
don't know what to say when someone black comes here and asks me: 'How could 
you support the man who vetoed civil rights?' 
</P>
<P>
"I can't make any excuses for him," he continued. "And I can't tell people to 
vote Republican and to support the Republican ticket when the top man does 
something like this." 
</P>
<P>
John L. Wilks, executive committee chairman of the National Black Republican 
Civil Rights Task Force, an ad hoc organization formed in 1987 to promote the 
GOP's commitment to civil rights, predicted more such reactions. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the one issue that will really cause a mobilization of concern," said 
Wilks, who estimates that the veto will cause Bush's approval rating among 
blacks and other minority groups to slip in percentage "from the 70s to around 
the 30s." 
</P>
<P>
But White House officials said they will defend the President by stressing his 
past commitment to the concerns of minority groups. GOP leaders and strategists 
said that most Americans -- including a majority of blacks -- eventually will 
appreciate Bush's veto as an earnest move to prevent employment decisions based 
on formulas or quotas. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), who opposed the bill, said he believes black 
Americans will listen to President Bush's arguments and reject those of the 
civil rights lobby. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be an attempt to make an impact against the President's 
popularity," he said. He predicted, however, that in the end "most blacks will 
continue to support the President." 
</P>
<P>
But black Republicans are not so certain. For them, defending GOP policies has 
always been difficult. But Bush's rejection of the top-priority legislation for 
most black Americans is likely to make it even tougher, they believe. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a rough, rough ride," said Arthur A. Fletcher, chairman of 
the U.S. Civil Rights Commission and one of the highest ranking blacks in the 
Administration. "The Democrats were waiting for an opportunity to torpedo his 
(favorable) image with blacks. They're all set with their attack posture to do 
a job that will demonstrate that Bush is less than what he seemed." 
</P>
<P>
The veto is a bitter defeat for Fletcher, a Republican Bush named to the Civil 
Rights Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"We were beginning to make inroads, beginning to get blacks to see the party in 
less emotional terms," he said. "Now all I can see is us having real trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Democrats wasted no time in going on the offensive. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bush veto guarantees that blacks will want to stay in the Democratic 
Party," said Rep. John Conyers Jr., a black Democrat from Detroit. "Just think 
of the damage the President has done to his credibility for any support he 
enjoyed in the African-American community." 
</P>
<P>
Some black Republicans whose dealings with Bush go back decades said that the 
President has been more supportive of and accessible to black Americans than 
any other GOP leader in recent history. 
</P>
<P>
"He definitely cares," Wilks said. "He's been on the record. He's somebody we 
know very personally. We've discussed these issues with him." 
</P>
<P>
The President's rejection of civil rights legislation -- he joined Andrew 
Jackson and Ronald Reagan as the only U.S. presidents to veto a civil rights 
bill -- is "the defining moment for the Bush presidency," declared an outraged 
Ralph Neas of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. 
</P>
<P>
That opinion is shared by Mario Moreno, a spokesman for the Mexican-American 
Legal Defense and Educational Fund in Washington. "We are angered and appalled 
that President Bush, who pretends to champion civil rights and the rights of 
minorities, refuses to champion civil rights and the right of minorities (and) 
refuses to provide the kind of leadership this country needs to protect the 
rights of racial minorities and women in the workplace," he said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
But some black Republicans who were interviewed blamed Bush's advisers -- 
particularly Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, White House counsel C. Boyden Gray 
and Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh -- for misleading the President. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question he's poorly informed by them," Fletcher charged.

The House Ethics Committee on Monday voted to investigate new charges that Rep. 
Donald E. (Buz) Lukens (R-Ohio), convicted last year of a sex offense, has 
sexually harassed a Capitol employee. 
</P>
<P>
"The committee has received additional evidence indicating that Rep. Lukens may 
have made unwanted and unsolicited sexual advances to a congressional 
employee," the committee announced. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the case said Lukens is suspected of fondling and 
propositioning a young elevator operator, giving her his business card. She 
reported the incident to her supervisors, and one source said there was a 
witness to corroborate her story. 
</P>
<P>
Lukens' office issued this statement in his name: "My attorneys have advised me 
that since little or nothing is known about the new allegation, there will be 
no comment until we have more information." 
</P>
<P>
Lukens, 59 and divorced, lost in the Republican primary earlier this year and 
will be leaving Congress at the end of the year. However, the committee 
appeared to be expediting its schedule to take action, ordering Lukens to 
appear under oath today. 
</P>
<P>
Lukens was convicted last year of contributing to the unruliness of a minor for 
having sex with a 16-year-old girl at his Columbus apartment in 1988. He was 
sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined $500 but is free on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
He refused to resign despite pleas from many Ohio Republicans.

PANEL MAY END ACTION AGAINST 2 OF 'KEATING 5'; 
</P>
<P>
ETHICS: A SPECIAL COUNCIL'S STUDY REPORTEDLY CALLS FOR DROPPING PROCEEDINGS 
AGAINST SENS. GLENN, MCCAIN STEMMING FROM THE S&amp;L SCANDAL.

<P>
The Senate Ethics Committee, responding to barbed Republican suggestions that 
its "Keating Five" inquiry has become a Democratic coverup, may decide today 
whether to dismiss charges against two senators, including the only Republican 
under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's Democratic chairman, Sen. Howell Heflin of Alabama, made the 
announcement Monday after four Republican senators urged immediate action on a 
six-week-old report by the panel's special counsel, Robert S. Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett reportedly recommended a full-scale investigation of charges that Sens. 
Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and Donald W. Riegle Jr. 
(D-Mich.) improperly helped a major campaign contributor, savings and loan 
executive Charles H. Keating Jr. 
</P>
<P>
But Bennett, according to sources, also called for dropping proceedings against 
Sens. John Glenn (D-Ohio) and John McCain (R-Ariz.). 
</P>
<P>
In coordinated floor speeches, McCain, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) 
and two other GOP senators suggested that Democrats are delaying action on the 
report to prevent the inquiry from focusing solely on Democratic senators just 
before congressional elections Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
They demanded a committee decision before Congress adjourns this week, as well 
as public disclosure of Bennett's 354-page report. Later, Glenn joined in the 
call with a press release. 
</P>
<P>
"There's far more at stake than my reputation," McCain declared. "There's the 
reputation of the United States Senate." 
</P>
<P>
In response, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) condemned a 
stream of "outrageous" leaks from the panel's investigation, suggesting that 
Republicans are responsible for feeding the secret data to reporters because it 
concerned only Cranston, DeConcini and Riegle. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Heflin defended the committee's deliberate pace, saying that the 
panel was obligated to explore issues raised about McCain and Glenn by Common 
Cause, the so-called citizens lobby, after Bennett turned in his report Sept. 
10. 
</P>
<P>
Heflin cited a brief filed Oct. 1 by Common Cause President Archibald Cox, 
arguing that there was "no basis for removing Sens. Glenn and McCain from this 
case." 
</P>
<P>
The panel is investigating Common Cause charges that the five senators 
improperly helped Keating battle federal regulators on behalf of Keating's 
failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, after receiving a combined total of $1.3 
million in political contributions. 
</P>
<P>
McCain said that he was speaking out reluctantly because he did not wish to 
"upset the very powerful Ethics Committee" or "jeopardize my political career." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "my concern is about my honor, my integrity and my reputation. . 
. . Not only am I personally frustrated by the failure of the committee to act 
on its year-long Keating Five investigation, there are growing allegations in 
the media of a coverup. . . . This system is incredibly and inexcusably 
delayed." 
</P>
<P>
McCain, while acknowledging that Keating had been a friend, a political 
supporter and "a hot property around the state of Arizona," maintained that "I 
never lifted a finger for him. When he asked for my help in an improper 
fashion, I walked away." 
</P>
<P>
Dole called for prompt committee action as a matter of fairness. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we are the week of adjournment and two of our colleagues have sort of 
been hung out to dry," he said, noting that the new Congress will not convene 
until January. "There are all kinds of rumors floating around. Some say they 
(the three Democrats on the six-member committee) do not want to make a 
decision before the election, that it is politics." 
</P>
<P>
Observing that McCain had once been held as a prisoner of war by the North 
Vietnamese, Dole said: "Let us not keep him hostage here in the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
Sens. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.) and Slade Gorton (R-Wash.) also joined in the 
criticism of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
In his press statement, Glenn asked that "the committee not allow the Senate to 
adjourn and thus delay indefinitely a resolution of this matter. . . . For more 
than a year, my honor and integrity have been called into question and my 
conduct has been the subject of unending speculation." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said: "I do not believe any fair conclusions can yet be reached about 
the outcome of the committee's deliberations." 
</P>
<P>
In assailing the leaks, he complained that they are "damaging the reputations 
of members. . . . Equally importantly, these leaks are attempting to establish 
a climate in which the judgment of the Ethics Committee will be immediately 
discredited if it reaches a different conclusion."

RULING BRIGHTENS ASPECT OF SURROGATE PARENTING; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: JUDGE SAYS IT ISN'T INHERENTLY EXPLOITIVE FOR A COUPLE WHO CAN'T HAVE 
CHILDREN ON THEIR OWN TO RENT THE BODY OF A THIRD PERSON FOR CHILD-BEARING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In ruling that Anna Johnson has no parental right to the child she bore, an 
Orange County judge Monday gave a somewhat brighter green light to the 
still-rare practice of surrogate parenting. 
</P>
<P>
He said, in essence, that it is not inherently exploitive for a couple who 
cannot have children on their own to rent the body of a third person to make 
child-bearing possible. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, he aroused the ire of surrogate parenthood opponents, who say the 
practice carries with it too much potential for exploitation of poor women 
serving as human incubators for the well-to-do. 
</P>
<P>
Some legal scholars believe that unless legislatures act to curb the practice, 
an industry will develop, exploiting Third World women as gestational 
surrogates for the wealthy, who either cannot carry a child for medical reasons 
or simply do not want to. 
</P>
<P>
"If the green light is given to gestational surrogacy, that will certainly 
occur," said Martha Field, a Harvard Law School expert in surrogate 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters, however, applauded the judge's ruling, which broke nearly new legal 
ground. Only one other U.S. court, in New Jersey, has upheld the validity of a 
contested surrogate contract between a couple who wanted a child and the woman 
they paid to help conceive it. That ruling, in the celebrated Baby M case, was 
reversed on appeal when the New Jersey Supreme Court said such a contract is 
invalid. 
</P>
<P>
If Johnson appeals her case, experts say Orange County Superior Court Judge 
Richard Parslow's legal reasoning could be overturned. But it is less likely 
that a court would change his order awarding custody to the genetic parents, 
Mark and Crispina Calvert. 
</P>
<P>
That is because the judge, as part of his ruling, withdrew Johnson's permission 
to visit the child. The child will therefore know only the Calverts as its 
parents, and appellate courts may feel it is in the child's best interests to 
remain in the situation to which he has grown accustomed. 
</P>
<P>
Something similar happened with Baby M. The New Jersey Supreme Court said that 
even though it disagreed with the lower court's decision, it was too late to 
change the living arrangements for the child. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, however, that state's high court warned, children should not be 
removed from the custody of their birth mothers while a custody dispute in a 
surrogate birth case is being litigated. That court said the birth mother 
should have custody because that would be in the best interest of the child. 
</P>
<P>
Because Parslow is a lower court judge, his opinion is likely to be 
influential, but it is not binding on other courts, even in California. 
</P>
<P>
In delivering his ruling, the jurist spoke for half an hour from notes to a 
courtroom packed mainly with reporters. To his right was a sign that could have 
stood for this case. It said, "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade." 
</P>
<P>
The facts were these: Crispina Calvert, who had had a hysterectomy but still 
wanted to have children, worked as a registered nurse in the same hospital as 
Johnson, an ex-Marine, licensed vocational nurse and mother of one. Another 
nurse, a mutual friend who had heard Johnson express interest in being a 
surrogate, introduced them. 
</P>
<P>
The Calverts could not afford to go through a surrogate agency, but they paid 
$3,500 for a copy of an agency's standard surrogate contract and some legal 
advice. Johnson signed the contract, agreeing to be implanted with an egg from 
Crispina and sperm from Mark. She agreed to carry the resulting fetus and 
deliver the baby for $10,000, the standard surrogate's fee. But in the seventh 
month of pregnancy she changed her mind and filed a lawsuit seeking to 
invalidate the contract, saying she had bonded with the fetus and wanted to 
keep the child as her own. 
</P>
<P>
Parslow began his ruling by acknowledging the strangeness of modern 
reproductive technology, which is to say, it sometimes takes three to tango. 
</P>
<P>
"It took three of them to get the child here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he compared Johnson's role in the trio to that of a "foster parent," who 
knows she is only taking care of the child for awhile. Parslow acknowledged 
that his ruling clashed with a California statute that makes it plain that 
whoever gives birth to a baby is its mother. He said that the Legislature, in 
failing to revise that statute, had failed to keep up with changes in 
reproductive technology, leaving the courts to deal with them. 
</P>
<P>
The judge made clear that the logic of his ruling would apply only to a 
gestational surrogate such as Johnson, a type of surrogate who is much rarer 
than a surrogate who supplies her own egg. That egg is then fertilized with the 
sperm of the intended father and the baby surrendered to him and his wife at 
birth. 
</P>
<P>
He thus left open the possibility that if Johnson had been a regular surrogate 
-- and had had a genetic relationship to the baby -- his ruling might have been 
different. 
</P>
<P>
As far as could be determined, he is the first judge to decide a contested case 
involving a gestational surrogate. 
</P>
<P>
Marjorie Shultz, a professor of law and medicine at UC Berkeley and a supporter 
of surrogate parenthood, applauded the result of the judge's decision, but not 
his reasoning. She said she disagreed with the judge's primary emphasis on the 
genetic tie of the child to the Calverts as a reason to award them exclusive 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
She said that in an age in which science has allowed people to take greater 
charge of their procreative functions, people should be encouraged to make 
decisions and, if necessary, have them enforced by courts. Therefore, she said, 
their intentions -- in this case expressed in a written contract -- should be 
honored as the key factor in a judicial evaluation, whether or not the intended 
parents are genetically related to the child that is produced. 
</P>
<P>
She rejected as too paternalistic the notion that women as a class need to be 
protected from serving as surrogates. "If you start saying that a whole class 
of people -- in this case women -- are somehow incapable of making decisions, 
you're in a very bad spot," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Shultz said that the traditional safeguards of contract law -- principles, for 
example, that invalidate an agreement signed under duress -- are sufficient to 
protect the interests of surrogates who are conned or coerced into carrying 
someone else's child. 
</P>
<P>
Many surrogates say they serve for a combination of altruistic and financial 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Field, the Harvard expert, acknowledged that the industry is small. There are 
only a few hundred surrogate parent pregnancies per year versus tens of 
thousands of adoptions. But she said she feared encouraging surrogate 
arrangements is a bad public policy, in part because it will eventually reduce 
the number of adoptions and increase the number of orphans. 
</P>
<P>
"If courts start enforcing surrogacy arrangements," she said, "it will 
encourage people to think of surrogacy as an available option -- a way for 
childless couples to have a genetic link to child." 
</P>
<P>
She also said she thought it would be better for courts to "stress the 
importance of nurture, rather than genetics" in parenting. 
</P>
<P>
She said she thought it was terrible that Johnson was left with no rights to 
visit the child she bore. "I would go further by saying that when the 
gestational mother says she wants custody, I'd give her custody, and them (the 
intended parents) visitation." 
</P>
<P>
Surrogates' contractual positions have been improving -- if marginally, in the 
last few years. In the Baby M case, the surrogate, who was also the natural 
mother, signed a contract that required her to have an abortion if the father 
demanded it. Johnson's contract contained a similar provision. But it also 
contained one that seemed to nullify it. 
</P>
<P>
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 12 state have laws 
regulating surrogate parenthood. Most make the contracts unenforceable in the 
courts and bar payments to surrogates. 
</P>
<P>
That is also the approach favored in California by an 18-member advisory group 
appointed by the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Parslow made several recommendations of his own to California legislators. He 
urged them to formulate rules that would provide for intensive psychological 
evaluations of parties to a surrogate contract by "an independent agency." He 
also recommended that the Legislature require that the genetic mother in a 
gestational surrogate case be medically incapable of carrying a child.

Spurred by protests from Western states, the Senate late Monday rejected a 
proposed one-year ban on selling federal land containing gold, silver and other 
hard-rock minerals to mining companies for as little as $2.50 an acre. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed temporary moratorium on issuing cheap titles to federal mining 
land was sponsored by Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.), who called the practice a 
flagrant giveaway of public land and "the biggest scam still going on in 
America." 
</P>
<P>
Western senators led by Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Bumpers' proposal would 
devastate the U.S. mining industry and stifle economic development.

$600,000 IN JEWELS ARE STOLEN FROM VAN; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT BELIEVES A SOPHISTICATED GROUP OF THIEVES WHO 
FOLLOW GEM DEALERS MAY BE RESPONSIBLE.

A gem dealer who had stopped for dinner at a Camarillo restaurant returned to 
his van to find that thieves had eluded his alarm system and stolen about 
$600,000 worth of jewels, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives from the Ventura County Sheriff's Department said a sophisticated 
group of thieves who follow gem dealers might be responsible for the crime, 
which is similar to many pulled off in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like someone was following him," Detective Steve Bourke said. "It 
very well could be the same type of ring." 
</P>
<P>
Three cases of rubies, emeralds, sapphires, amethysts and other gems were 
stolen from Ralph Bragg's van Sunday about 9 p.m. as the 71-year-old dealer 
from San Diego ate dinner with his wife at Sizzler-Steak Seafood Salad 
restaurant at 1755 E. Daily Drive, Sgt. Paul Oeschle of the Sheriff's 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Bragg, who said he is not insured because premiums are too expensive, said the 
thieves also took four suitcases of clothing, thousands of dollars in proceeds 
from the jewel show they had just attended and Bragg's prescription heart 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The culprits overlooked about $300,000 worth of jewels stored under the van 
seats, said Bragg, who is still conducting an inventory of everything that was 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tremendous loss," Bragg said. "Financially, we're not going to starve, 
but it makes a hell of a dent in our net worth." 
</P>
<P>
Bragg said he believes the thieves followed him from Arroyo Grande in San Luis 
Obispo County, where he had set up a display during a gem show. He said he 
noticed a group of men casing the merchandise as he packed up his trays of 
jewels. 
</P>
<P>
"They came up to the display and sized it up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bragg, however, said he is used to potential shoplifters casing merchandise and 
did not think about the men after he left the show about 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
When he and his wife stopped for dinner, Bragg said he was careful to set the 
security alarm on his Ford Aerostar van and to park under a bright light 
between two cars. He said he stood up during dinner a couple of times to peer 
through the restaurant's window and check for suspicious activity. 
</P>
<P>
The van alarm is set to sound when the car is tapped or even when the door 
handle is touched. 
</P>
<P>
The thieves entered the van by breaking a side window that could not be seen 
from the restaurant, he said. Apparently, the shattering glass was not enough 
to set off the alarm, which was still operational, Bragg said, when he returned 
after dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a haphazard thing," Bragg said of the robbery. "It's very well 
planned and very well executed." 
</P>
<P>
Such "distraction thefts" account for about $20 million in losses in the Los 
Angeles area each year, said Dave Evans, a sergeant in the Organized Theft Unit 
set up two years ago by the Los Angeles Police Department. The culprits, who 
come predominantly from South America and sometimes from Europe, specialize in 
jewelry theft, Evans said. They also are known to participate in luggage thefts

Evans said they prefer to avoid confrontation and rely on distracting their 
victims -- sometimes by putting cars out of commission by puncturing tires or 
cutting radiator hoses. 
</P>
<P>
The thieves, who typically do not carry weapons, set up surveillance on victims 
and follow them until an opportune moment, he said. To blend with the wealthy 
clientele who frequent jewel shows, the thieves dress in expensive clothing, 
Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a profession," Evans said. "They don't do anything else. This is their 
job."

PLANS FOR TENT JAIL ON NAVY SITE ARE DROPPED; 
</P>
<P>
FACILITIES: THE PORT HUENEME PROPERTY IS EARMARKED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE 
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT MAY SEEK ANOTHER LOCATION TO HOUSE RECREATIONAL DRUG 
USERS.

<P>
The Ventura County Sheriff's Department has scrapped plans to build a "tent 
city" jail for recreational drug users at the Naval Construction Battalion 
Center in Port Hueneme because the Navy wants to use the location for 
affordable housing, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department officials said they will seek another site for the 
facility -- if the project receives federal financing. The county is asking the 
Justice Department for $7.2 million to help support a facility for as many as 
320 minor drug offenders, who would be housed in four large tents. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Sheriff John V. Gillespie proposed building the encampment as part 
of a new drug-enforcement policy he developed with Dist. Atty. Michael D. 
Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy calls for stepping up efforts to curb minor drug offenses and 
reduce the demand for drugs. According to Sheriff's Department officials, 
jailing prominent citizens -- such as teachers, bankers and lawyers -- caught 
using or possessing small amounts of drugs would deter others from using them. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss of the Navy site, the project did not suffer a setback, 
Gillespie said. Department officials said the Honor Farm near Ojai and the 
proposed jail facility between Ventura and Santa Paula could be used, pending 
approval of federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
"We would certainly like to go ahead with it," Commander Bob Brooks said. "It 
is a strong priority of the whole law enforcement community. . . . But with all 
the federal budget problems, we are waiting." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Gillespie said he still believes the tent city concept is an 
"excellent one." 
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to cost $13.6 million in its first year, with the 
county providing a portion of the funding. Much of the program's budget -- 
about $9 million -- would pay for personnel. Under the plan, 71 new county 
positions would be added. 
</P>
<P>
The program would concentrate on counseling and rehabilitation. But the inmates 
would be taken daily to public areas such as beaches and parks to perform 
maintenance work. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie had asked Navy officials last spring if the county could place the 
facility at the battalion center, where they could use the land for free. But 
the request raised a chorus of protests from residents in the area. A group of 
Port Hueneme and Oxnard homeowners gathered more than 700 signatures of 
residents who vowed to fight the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, base officials said Monday that the secretary of the Navy recently 
encouraged base officials to seek outside investors to help build affordable 
housing on the bases. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Port Hueneme officials targeted the site as a possible location 
for housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it would be unwise to tie up this acreage at the present time when it 
could otherwise be considered by a successful proposer for construction of 
badly needed affordable housing for our junior enlisted personnel," Navy Capt. 
R.J. Pearson III said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we don't anticipate that we will have successfully resolved all of our 
housing options for at least the next year or two, the Sheriff's Department has 
withdrawn its proposal." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks said the Sheriff's Department was disappointed to learn of the Navy's 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that it was a situation where the county and the Navy could have come 
out winners," Brooks said.

STATE SALUTES BRAVERY OF 4 FROM COUNTY 
</P>

<P>
Four Ventura County residents who braved fire, water and violence to save 
others were honored as heroes Monday by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp at a 
ceremony in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
In February, a man suspected of threatening his estranged wife was tackled by 
Richard Gonzalez, 37, a meat cutter from Fillmore, who held him until Ventura 
County sheriff's deputies arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez was one of 20 Southern Californians who received certificates from the 
attorney general for brave acts. Some citizens rescued residents of burning 
homes and pulled potential drowning victims out of the ocean, all without 
thought for their own safety. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to get involved," Gonzalez said. "What happens if you don't? You just 
have to do it." 
</P>
<P>
For Gonzalez, who spent eight years in the Marine Corps, it was the second time 
in eight years he had saved another person's life. In 1982, while in San 
Clemente, he prevented a child from choking. 
</P>
<P>
The three other Ventura County citizens who were honored also reacted bravely 
after stumbling on unexpected danger: 
</P>
<P>
In June, Denise Boczek was walking along the beach in Point Mugu when she heard 
cries for help from a drowning 7-year-old boy and his baby-sitter. She jumped 
into the water and rescued both. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Chad Carper of Meiners Oaks saved a woman whose mobile home was 
ablaze by leading her outside and then extinguishing the fire with a garden 
hose. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Saavedra of Thousand Oaks was just cashing a check at a bank in 
December, 1989, when his wife, a bank worker, told him there had been a 
robbery. He caught the suspected robber and held him until sheriff's deputies 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Others honored were two Whittier residents who on Jan. 1 formed a rescue team 
with three neighbors to help a family out of a burning home and three Manhattan 
Beach men who saved a woman from rape by a knife-wielding assailant. 
</P>
<P>
All were citizens who "came to the aid of the victims without hesitating, 
despite the potential danger to themselves," Van de Kamp said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, 35 members of law enforcement from Los Angeles, Orange, San Luis 
Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties were honored for their valor and 
police work. They included peace officers, prosecutors and probation officials. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the citizens who received special praise from Van de Kamp. He said 
neighbors and bystanders have helped police capture suspects and save victims 
-- thus helping the legal community to do its job. 
</P>
<P>
"Our job is ineffective unless we get the help of the local community," he 
said.

FAMILY OF BOY BIT BY POLICE DOG AWARDED $58,840 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The family of a boy attacked by a police dog in 1988 was awarded $58,840 by a 
Superior Court jury on Monday, despite suggestions by the family that more than 
$600,000 in damages be granted. 
</P>
<P>
The jury award came despite a plea from the family's attorney that it had been 
left with permanent emotional scars from the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict, which followed two days of deliberation, resolves a lawsuit filed 
by the family of Wesley Eaton, now 5, against the Oxnard Police Department. 
Wesley was attacked by Max, a 90-pound malinois, March 17, 1988, at the 
residence of the dog's handler, Oxnard Officer James E. O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors were told that the wounds indicated that Wesley's entire head was taken 
in the dog's mouth and that the animal had bitten down, leaving punctures on 
the boy's neck and a 2 1/2-inch gash on his scalp. 
</P>
<P>
The suit is one of four civil actions filed against the department since 1987 
by people who say they were attacked by police dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the trial, the city admitted responsibility for the attack, leaving 
the jury to determine how much the city should pay for medical and emotional 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asked for an unspecified amount, but attorney Richard Bredlau 
suggested his clients deserved an award of about $630,000 for future earning 
losses, and physical and emotional damages. 
</P>
<P>
The jury awarded $33,840 to Wesley to compensate him for emotional distress and 
medical expenses. It awarded his mother, Janet Eaton, an additional $25,000 for 
the emotional distress she suffered by witnessing the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The jury decided not to award damages to Wesley's brother, Michael Eaton, now 
7, who the jury said suffered no emotional distress from witnessing the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred when Janet Eaton took her two sons to visit O'Brien, who 
was a family friend. As she stood at the front door talking with O'Brien's 
wife, Wesley wandered into the back yard. The jury was told that the dog bit 
the boy's head and neck before O'Brien came out of the house to separate them. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Eaton and her husband, Richard, declined to discuss the verdict, 
referring all questions to Bredlau. 
</P>
<P>
Bredlau played down the lower amount awarded by the jury. "They did what they 
thought was right and we are going to have to live with that," he said of the 
jurors' decision. 
</P>
<P>
Becky McCarthy, the attorney representing the city, said she believed the award 
could have been even lower. But she said she was happy that it "came down to 
the neighborhood that we had talked about." 
</P>
<P>
During her closing arguments, McCarthy suggested that the Eaton family had 
exaggerated the extent of their emotional injuries. She suggested that Janet 
Eaton did not witness the entire incident and that Wesley will recover with 
minimal psychological help. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy suggested that the jury award Wesley between $10,000 and $15,000 and 
said Janet and Michael Eaton deserve no compensation because they suffered no 
emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
Maryanne Vreeland, the jury's forewoman, said the jurors believed Wesley and 
Janet Eaton suffered no permanent emotional distress and would eventually 
recover from the trauma. She said jury members varied from $5,000 to $50,000 on 
the amount of damages they believed should be awarded to the Eatons. 
</P>
<P>
"All I am saying is I hope they can go on with their lives, and I think that 
after this they will," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The four-week trial included separate appearances by Wesley and the dog, as 
well as tearful testimony from Janet Eaton and Wesley's grandfather, David 
Eaton. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Eaton testified that Wesley became more subdued after the attack and 
suffered nightmares about dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors heard varying opinions from two psychologists on the extent of the 
emotional distress suffered by Wesley. One suggested that the attack may have 
left permanent emotional scars on Wesley, while another suggested that the 
trauma could be addressed with minimal psychological treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The suit initially named O'Brien as a defendant. But during closing arguments, 
Bredlau said the Eatons had decided O'Brien was not at fault and would not seek 
damages from the officer.

The occupants of a slow-moving vehicle heading south on the Ventura Freeway at 
the Conejo Grade suffered minor injuries after being hit in the rear by another 
vehicle. The passengers were wearing seat belts, the CHP reported. 
</P>
<P>
Dirk Spialti, 20, of Ventura and Jo Ellen Davis of Yucaipa were treated for 
minor injuries Sunday night at Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand 
Oaks and released. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP said witnesses reported that the driver of the second vehicle, Kenneth 
Daugherty, 55, of Monterey Park, was traveling about 55 to 60 m.p.h. in the 
slow lane near the truck scales and braked before hitting Spialti, who was 
traveling about 10 to 15 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Daugherty was not wearing a seat belt, officials said. He suffered major 
injuries and was also taken to Los Robles Regional Medical Center, where he is 
reported in fair condition. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

An Oxnard bank was robbed Monday by a man who gave the teller a note and 
indicated that he had a gun, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
"The suspect flashed a note to the teller so fast that she did not even have 
time to read it," said Gary Auer, supervisor of the local FBI office. "But she 
got the message." 
</P>
<P>
The robbery occurred at 11:09 a.m. at First Nationwide Bank. The man fled on 
foot after receiving money from the teller, Auer said. The amount taken was not 
revealed. It was the 38th bank robbery this year in Ventura County. GERRY

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CONFERENCE PLANNED ON ABUSE SERVICES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Politicians, law enforcement leaders, prevention specialists and education 
officials will meet next month for a daylong conference designed to better 
coordinate drug and alcohol programs in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, together with Cal 
Lutheran University and the district attorney's office, has invited about 200 
members of the public and private sectors to the event, which will begin Nov. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
Conference organizers expect to generate long-term plans for integrating abuse 
services, changing societal attitudes and developing public policy and 
legislation, said Felipe Santana, director of prevention and education for the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
While he would not single out specific cities in Ventura County, Santana said 
many have more than one organization fulfilling similar needs while other 
cities have few, if any, programs. The conference should help eliminate a 
duplication of services, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we develop a council for the entire county, we can develop a more creative 
operation of existing services," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those invited include representatives from the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department, the Ventura County Council of Churches, citizens advisory boards 
from various cities, city mayors and private nonprofit organizations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, 42 county residents suffered drug-related deaths, he said, and in 1988 
there were 51. Figures for 1989 will be released at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
One of the problems to be discussed at the conference is that few services 
exist in the Oxnard-Port Hueneme area for low-income addicts, said Brenda 
Cordobes, a spokeswoman for Steps, an Oxnard prevention agency. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura, there is a lack of facilities for the disabled, including those in 
wheelchairs and the hearing impaired, said Betty Gips, a Ventura communication 
consultant. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: BOARD TO CONSIDER PAY RAISES FOR 50 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HULSE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors will consider raising salaries for about 50 
county employees today in a move that would cost about $350,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
County Personnel Director Ronald Komers said he is recommending salary 
adjustments in a variety of departments. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases it is to recognize the specialized nature of positions, he said, 
and for others it's to remain competitive to attract job applicants or to 
change job classifications. 
</P>
<P>
He said nearly all the positions are covered by the Public Employees Assn. of 
Ventura County, and the increases were budgeted. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest increases will go to pharmacy and radiology employees, according to 
a report Komers prepared. The increases for both departments total $189,000 
annually with benefits and affect 26 employees. 
</P>
<P>
The county has difficulty recruiting pharmacists because of a general shortage 
and because county pharmacists earn 30% less than those at other local 
hospitals, according to Komers' report. The proposed increases are as high as 
19.5% for some pharmacists. 
</P>
<P>
The radiology department also has had numerous vacancies despite extensive 
advertising, the report says. The senior X-ray technician's position pays 20% 
below what other area hospitals pay. Under the proposed increases, salaries for 
some radiology positions will jump as much as 18.5 %. JANE HULSE

FIRST SHIPMENTS OF SEWAGE SLUDGE ARRIVE;

<P>
ANTELOPE VALLEY: LOS ANGELES BEGINS TRUCKING THE MATERIAL TO A FARM NEAR 
LANCASTER, WHERE A CITY-HIRED CONTRACTOR WILL USE IT TO FERTILIZE ALFALFA AND 
SOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A tractor pulling a 3,600-gallon tank rumbled onto remote farmland in the 
Antelope Valley Monday to pump into the earth Los Angeles' newest and smelliest 
export -- gooey, black municipal sewage sludge. 
</P>
<P>
The tractor slowly drove up and down the rows of an abandoned field, plunging 
metal prongs about a foot into the ground to inject the fecal-smelling, mudlike 
byproduct of human waste. 
</P>
<P>
This use of treated sewage as fertilizer is the first local attempt by Los 
Angeles to prove that something good can grow from efforts to get rid of a foul 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Under a program nearly two years in development, the city began trucking up to 
100 tons a day of its sewage sludge to a farm about 10 miles west of Lancaster, 
where a city-hired contractor plans to use the waste as fertilizer for alfalfa 
and sod. 
</P>
<P>
The thick sludge is the remnant of human waste and other sewage that has 
undergone a complex treatment process. Health officials will not allow it to be 
used as fertilizer on crops grown for human consumption. 
</P>
<P>
The program marks the first time Los Angeles has applied its sludge to land 
within the county. Although the city's main goal is to dispose of its waste, 
officials said that sludge can benefit agriculture and help farms cut their 
water use by serving as a kind of mulch. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the city, which has been trucking sludge to farms in Arizona, hopes to 
cut its costs by not shipping it so far. Officials hope that keeping the sludge 
within the county, rather than hauling it far away, will show residents that 
the waste can be safely reused. 
</P>
<P>
The first three 25-ton truckloads made the 90-mile trip without incident from 
the city's main Hyperion sewage treatment plant in El Segundo to Antelope 
Valley. Once there, the sludge in the trucks is mixed with water to flow more 
easily and is pumped into a spreading tank. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to be good neighbors," said Don Price, regional manager for Bio 
Gro Systems Inc., the waste management company hired by the city to manage the 
sludge program. The city is paying Bio Gro about $60,000 a month to truck the 
sludge to Bio Gro's 640-acre farm in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
City residents produce about 1,350 tons of sludge a day. The city dumped the 
waste into Santa Monica Bay for about 30 years until a federal lawsuit halted 
the practice in late 1987. Now, in addition to the farms, the city uses its 
remaining sludge as cover at the BKK landfill in West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
The sludge proposal caused a furor in March when surprised Antelope Valley 
officials learned that Los Angeles was planning to export up to 300 tons a day 
to five sites. In May, the state water board approved a scaled-down request for 
one site and 100 tons per day. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to avoid complaints even in the remote farm area, Bio Gro 
abandoned its earlier plan to spread the sludge on the surface of the soil, 
where it has a stronger fecal smell and could be blown in high winds. The firm 
opted to use a tank truck to inject it underground. 
</P>
<P>
Bio Gro plans up to four truck trips every weekday from Hyperion to the 
Antelope Valley, Price said. Although the program started using dump trucks 
covered with tarps, Price said Bio Gro soon plans to shift to tanker trucks to 
minimize the possibility of sludge spills.

2 RESIDENTS BILKED OF MONEY IN SCAMS

<P>
Two Santa Paula residents have lost money in a scam in which victims are 
approached by someone appearing to be sick or lost, Santa Paula police said. 
</P>
<P>
The first scam occurred Sept. 22 when a Santa Paula woman was approached by a 
woman who claimed to be ill. A man then offered to help, and after a period of 
time, the conversation turned to money. The victim was escorted to Santa Paula 
Savings &amp; Loan, where she made a bank withdrawal and gave the undisclosed 
amount of money to the couple. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 5, an elderly man was approached by two men who said they were lost. 
The two gained the confidence of the victim and persuaded him to withdraw money 
from his bank account, saying they would use their vehicle as collateral. The 
men disappeared after receiving the money. Police did not disclose how much 
money was taken. 
</P>
<P>
A Santa Paula woman was approached Oct. 19 by a woman who said she was lost. A 
man offered assistance, and the conversation soon turned to money and the 
woman's bank account. The intended victim became suspicious, however, and 
walked away from the pair. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a Santa Paula woman received a telephone call from someone claiming 
to be from her bank. The woman was told that an unlawful withdrawal had been 
made from her account and the bank would send a representative to take her to 
the bank to clear up the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The woman said that no one came to her house, so she called the bank and was 
told no one had called her. She then began looking through her bank statements 
and found her most recent statement missing. She believes the statement was 
taken from her mailbox, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula police are seeking information about the suspects. GERRY BRAILO

BIDDING REOPENED ON SCHOOL PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Because of an administrative error, the Santa Paula Union High School board 
decided Monday to reopen bidding for a $2-million renovation of several older 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
When school district officials asked for bids earlier this fall, they did not 
know of a change in California law requiring contractors to be licensed when 
they submit a bid, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, contractors had been required to have their licenses in order by 
the time work began, school Supt. Carolina Erie said. 
</P>
<P>
The school board accepted the lowest bid at its meeting two weeks ago. But the 
decision was challenged by another contractor, who maintained that the firm 
offering the low bid did not have a proper license. Until that time, the 
administrator said, the district was unaware of the change in the law, which 
was enacted in July. 
</P>
<P>
The action to reopen the bidding was taken at a special meeting Monday on the 
advice of the district's counsel. 
</P>
<P>
The renovation at the high school includes new windows and improvements to 
electrical, plumbing and heating systems in the girls' gymnasium, the 
industrial arts building and classrooms on the upper campus. The repairs are to 
be paid for with state and local funds, officials said. AMELIA CHAFFEE

DRIVER CONVICTED OF MANSLAUGHTER IN HIT-AND-RUN THAT KILLED YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 19-year-old Sherman Oaks man was convicted Monday of felony hit-and-run 
driving and misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter for driving a friend's car into 
two teen-agers, killing one of them, after discovering his own vehicle had been 
vandalized. 
</P>
<P>
But the Van Nuys Superior Court jury cleared the man, Sean Gauthia, of more 
serious charges of murder and felony vehicular manslaughter in the April 7 
death of Gavin Kalaba, 17, and the injury of Joseph Elder, 17, both of Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated seven days. Judge Jerold A. Krieger set sentencing for 
Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Kalaba died of head injuries. Elder suffered leg injuries and has undergone 
extensive surgery, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
The two youths did not vandalize Gauthia's vehicle, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Leonard Shaffer. But Gauthia, angry over damage to his Jeep, commandeered a 
friend's Chevrolet Blazer and deliberately ran into the two youths, Shaffer 
contended. 
</P>
<P>
"They just happened to be there," Shaffer said. "There were about 10 or 12 
people, and they happened to be the ones standing there." 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Schwartz, Gauthia's attorney, told jurors that the collision was an 
accident. A passenger in the Blazer jerked the steering wheel, causing Gauthia 
to strike Elder and Kalaba, he argued. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred about midnight, after Gauthia and several friends left a 
party attended by several hundred people at a rented warehouse at Oxnard and 
Sepulveda streets. 
</P>
<P>
Shaffer said Gauthia saw that the windshield and side and rear windows of his 
Jeep had been broken. Shaffer contended that the windows were broken by 
party-goers who thought the Jeep's occupants had smashed the windows of a 
Mustang earlier in the evening, Shaffer said. 
</P>
<P>
Shaffer said that it was one of Gauthia's friends, not Gauthia, who had broken 
the Mustang windows that sparked the vandalism of Gauthia's car. 
</P>
<P>
Gauthia is also facing charges in San Fernando Superior Court of raping a woman 
in concert with friends, Shaffer said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRAIN KILLS A MAN WALKING ACROSS TRACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 20-year-old Van Nuys man was struck by a train and killed as he walked across 
railroad tracks in Sepulveda Sunday night, Los Angeles Police said. 
</P>
<P>
George Roman had been "walking back and forth on the tracks" near Woodley 
Avenue just south of Roscoe Boulevard when he was struck by an Amtrak train at 
7:50 p.m., said Detective Mike Brandt. 
</P>
<P>
The train could not stop in time to avoid hitting the man. 
</P>
<P>
"A train that size takes a good mile or half a mile to stop," Brandt said. 
</P>
<P>
Roman was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Roman was believed to have been drinking heavily earlier that evening while 
watching a football game at a friend's house, Brandt said. An autopsy will 
determine if Roman was drunk at the time of the accident, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The train, the Coast Starlight, was carrying 450 to 500 passengers and was 
traveling from Seattle to Los Angeles. The train was delayed about two hours, 
said Arthur Lloyd, director of Amtrak public affairs.

Yen Traders Case Split: Two commodity traders who contend trading rules were 
broken routinely at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange will be tried separately 
from 12 others in a federal fraud case, U.S. District Judge William T. Hart 
ruled. Hart said evidence presented by defendants Sam A. Cali and Ray Pace in 
their unusual defense might prejudice the jury against the 12 other defendants, 
who have denied breaking rules. Hart did not set a date for the separate trial.

Bar Assn., Business Groups Agree: Colorado businesses will try to slash legal 
costs and reduce off-the-job time losses by attempting negotiation and 
mediation before taking their disagreements to court, under a newly introduced 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The program, called "Colorado Pledge," is an agreement by the bar association, 
the Greater Denver Chamber of Commerce, the Colorado Assn. of Commerce and 
Industry and the National Federation of Independent Business, Conover told 
reporters. "We hope it will show to you a side of lawyers that is not 
frequently enough publicized -- a side of lawyers that solves problems and 
helps clients solve problems not in the courtroom arena," Bar Assn. President 
Jerry Conover.

<P>
COLLECTIBLES: S.D. COMPANY WORKS OVERTIME MANUFACTURING BASEBALLS FEATURING 
PICTURES OF PLAYERS FROM WORLD SERIES TEAMS. 
</P>

Fotoball USA owners were rooting for the Oakland Athletics to win the 1990 
World Series, but it really did not matter to them that the Cincinnati Reds 
emerged victorious. Whichever team won, the San Diego company expected to come 
out smelling like a rose long after the last crack of the bat. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-year-old company is licensed by Major League Baseball to manufacture 
special edition Fotoballs and roster balls for the World Series. The Fotoballs 
are actual baseballs imprinted with color pictures of either players from the 
A's or the Reds, and bear the 1990 World Series logo nd team seal. 
</P>
<P>
Two days before the Oct. 16 start of the World Series, employees at Fotoball 
USA began working overtime at the company's Rose Canyon plant, cranking out 
more than 3,000 series balls a day. The company does not expect to slow down 
until sometime this week, said Michael Favish, Fotoball's 42-year-old 
president. 
</P>
<P>
The roster balls are imprinted with the team seal and a player roster. To 
commemorate their four-game sweep of the series, the Cincinnati Reds' balls are 
stamped World Champions as well as 1990 National League Champions. The Oakland 
balls bear the 1990 American League Champions stamp. Working 12-hour shifts, 
the company has been filling orders as fast as it can, said Derrick Favish, 
Michael's 38-year-old brother and business partner. 
</P>
<P>
The balls were sold for about $13 at the Oakland Coliseum, Cincinnati's 
Riverfront Stadium, via The Home Shopping Network on cable television and in 
gift shops around the country, Favish said. On Monday, orders were still coming 
in, and at last count, the company had sold 20,000 balls. 
</P>
<P>
Watching the series out of the corner of his eye on an office television last 
week, Favish said sales of World Series balls will represent about 10% of the 
company's estimated $2.3 million in sales this year. The company, which opened 
its doors in March, 1989, grossed about $860,000 in 1989 revenue. 
</P>
<P>
During the rest of the year, the company's 23 employees are busy pumping out 
player balls and roster balls of league teams and limited-edition autograph 
balls, Favish said. The company has also diversified into Fotopucks, hockey 
pucks with players' pictures, team crests and career highlights; football 
Fotoballs; and Fotosweats, or sweatbands imprinted with baseball players' 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
The autographed baseball series includes balls signed by Tony Gwynn of the 
Padres; Johnny Bench, Cincinnati Reds' Hall of Fame player; and Jerome Walton, 
a Chicago Cubs' outfielder. "We did a limited, hand-signed edition of the Wayne 
Gretzky Fotopuck which sold out in six weeks for $199 a piece," Favish said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fotoball concept got its start in 1985 with a soccer ball, he said. "I 
built the first prototype on my living room floor." 
</P>
<P>
Favish, a native of South Africa, had sold his interest in a Beverly Hills art 
gallery the year before. "I was kind of at loose ends for a couple of months, 
and this thing came up and I had some time to spend on it. That was very 
fortunate because it took a lot of time and effort." 
</P>
<P>
"I played soccer as a child, and I was very involved with my kids' youth 
programs in Los Angeles. The idea for imprinting balls came from a toy soccer 
ball that had animal characters on it. One of my brothers said, why couldn't 
somebody put players on it instead. A penny dropped, and I started fiddling 
around with paints and tapes and all the things that make a prototype." 
</P>
<P>
But selling the soccer-ball concept proved too difficult because the main 
market at the time was in Europe, Favish said. So, Favish turned his energies 
to finding a color process to print photos on baseballs. "That in itself was a 
full-time task," Favish said, adding that printing on a soccer ball was child's 
play compared to a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
It was a much easier task to print on the 32-panel soccer balls before they 
were assembled, he said. "Baseballs couldn't be done that way. You had to print 
on the baseball once it was already fabricated in the round. So, to come up 
with a process, took my brother and me half of 1987 and all of 1988. I'm a real 
fusspot when it comes to quality." 
</P>
<P>
The brothers went to Italy to work with engineers there to fabricate the 
printing machines to their specifications. They had to draw from several 
different types of machines because what they needed did not exist, Favish 
said. "The machines are one of a kind." 
</P>
<P>
The company has an international flavor, Favish said. "We've got an American 
sports product being made by two South African guys using Laotian labor, 
Italian machines and balls made in China. We're all equal rights here." 
</P>
<P>
The company now has three major league baseball licenses, three National 
Football League licenses, and two National Hockey League licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Professional sports licensing is a major industry, Favish said. Last year, 325 
companies that bought rights from major league baseball grossed more than $1 
billion from retail sales, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But getting a license is no small feat, Favish said. The products are closely 
scrutinized by the league for quality and design, and the company has to pay an 
advance royalty based on expected sales, usually never less than $25,000, he 
said. Then the company pays the league 8 1/2% in royalties once sales begin. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always wondering where my Ferrari is. It's not ready to be driven 
up to the front door yet," Favish said. "The bigger you get, the more money you 
need. (It) costs plenty to do what we do. You have to have balls to print on, 
you have to have packaging to put the finished product into. We need additional 
staff, shipping crates and cartons. The number of employees has grown from 
three to 23." 
</P>
<P>
"Going from a two-product line to a nine-product line is like starting a new 
business," Favish said. "You don't just put nine products in your product 
catalogue and rake in the money. It's not that way." 
</P>
<P>
Getting the products to market is the company's biggest challenge, Favish said. 
Using a network of representatives and distributors, the baseball Fotoballs are 
sold in outlets ranging from Wal Mart stores and airport gift shops to baseball 
card stores and sporting goods stores. 
</P>
<P>
Favish said his company is targeting sales of $4 million next year. "Whether we 
achieve it or not will be a function of our ability to bring the products to 
market," he said.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: 2ND-QUARTER NET INCOME SOARS 266% FOR AMGEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amgen Inc., a Thousand Oaks biotechnology company, said its net income soared 
266% to $14.3 million in the second quarter that ended Sept. 30 from $3.9 
million a year before. Amgen attributed the huge jump to sales of its drug for 
the treatment of chronic anemia in kidney dialysis patients. 
</P>
<P>
The drug, called Epogen, was approved for sale by the Food and Drug 
Administration in June, 1989. Amgen said its total revenues for the second 
quarter nearly doubled to $78.8 million, from $39.6 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of Amgen's fiscal year, the company's profit increased more 
than fivefold to $25.5 million, from $4.7 million a year ago. Amgen's six 
months' sales more than doubled to $150.5 million, from $68.1 million.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: FOOTHILL'S INCOME HOLDS AT $1.8 MILLION FOR QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Foothill Group Inc., a financial company with executive offices in Agoura 
and West Los Angeles, said its net income for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 
was virtually unchanged from last year at $1.82 million. Foothill's total 
revenues for the period fell 2% to $22.8 million from $23.3 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Foothill posted a loss of $47,000, compared 
to a profit of $8.47 million a year ago. The nine-months loss was primarily 
attributable to an $11.6-million loss on its investments, most of which are 
junk bonds. Most of that was reported in Foothill's second quarter, when it 
wrote down the value of its relatively small junk-bond portfolio by $9 million. 
Foothill also recorded a $783,000 loss on investments in the third quarter. 
Mainly because of the writedowns and investment losses, Foothill's nine-month 
revenues fell 20% to $59.4 million from $74.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company seems to have made progress on its plan to sell off its 
junk bonds. The size of the portfolio dropped from $39 million at the end of 
the second quarter to $23 million at the end of the third. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill also reported after the end of the third quarter that it raised $100 
million in commitments for a new limited partnership, Foothill Partners, to 
invest in the bank debt of distressed companies.

A milestone in African democracy could be reached during presidential elections 
Sunday in Ivory Coast.

<P>
The nearly 90-year-old Felix Houphouet-Boigny, the West African country's only 
president in 30 years of independence, will face his first independent 
challenger ever, 45-year-old history professor Laurent Gbagbo. 
</P>
<P>
The challenger is a decided underdog, in part because he has been denied 
adequate access to the government-owned media. Beyond that, however, observers 
say Gbagbo's campaign has been largely undisturbed by government interference.

IN THE AMAZON, FOREST AND FARMERS HAVE TO GET ALONG;

TO SAVE BRAZIL'S TROPICAL WILDERNESS, EXPERTS SAY, ALTERNATIVES ARE NEEDED TO 
DESTRUCTIVE FARMING METHODS. THEY BELIEVE THE REGION CAN BE PROFITABLE AND 
PRESERVED.

MANAUS, Brazil 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sprawling, air-conditioned hotel at the edge of the Amazon forest teemed 
with ideas for saving the world's biggest tropical wilderness. It was a 
flourishing ecosystem of ideas, with the exuberance of a triple-canopy jungle, 
some ideas like towering trees, others like dense undergrowth and entwining 
vines. 
</P>
<P>
They sprouted from the mouths of conservationists, researchers, government 
technicians and officials; they blossomed from photocopied treatises, slide 
projectors and posters; they germinated on note pads and paper napkins. The 
lush proliferation of ideas left no doubt that an international conference 
called "Forest 90" was a fertile theoretical environment. 
</P>
<P>
A sampling: 
</P>
<P>
Dirigibles will float over the wilderness, lowering in loggers to cut mature 
hardwood trees with as little damage to the forest as possible. New trees will 
be planted to replace the harvested ones, which will be hoisted into the sky 
and carried to nearby rivers, then floated to distant sawmills. No more logging 
roads slicing destructively through the fragile flora and fauna. 
</P>
<P>
Forest dwellers will not only tap rubber and gather Brazil nuts, as they do 
today, but also will collect foods, medicinal plants, gums, fibers, dyes, oils 
and other products for marketing in Brazil and abroad. Useful species will be 
reseeded. In riverside settlements, processing plants and cottage industries 
will turn forest products into finished goods, providing needed jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural extension workers will help farmers cultivate combinations of 
trees that yield profitable crops on small plots, protecting the land from the 
erosion and hardening that can occur when the forest is removed. This sustained 
"agroforestry" will render unnecessary the slash-and-burn farming methods that 
have already destroyed so much native forest. 
</P>
<P>
Landowners will raise big, fast-growing Amazon fish in ponds covering a few 
acres, earning much more than they could by raising cattle on large tracts of 
cleared land. Waste from chicken coops at the edge of the water will feed the 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
Two million Amazon colonos, pioneer farmers from other parts of Brazil, have 
shown how the imperative of economic survival can devour virgin forest. Most 
colonos begin by planting traditional subsistence crops such as beans, corn and 
an abundant root crop called manioc on cleared forest land. When the soil wears 
out in two or three years, they clear more land. More rain forest disappears. 
</P>
<P>
Saving the forest, it was clear here, is not only a matter of curbing rapacious 
ranchers, but also of offering small farmers economic alternatives to 
destructive methods. 
</P>
<P>
Like the vast rain forest itself, the ideas for weaning farmers from the 
slash-and-burn cycle seemed to have no end. 
</P>
<P>
Plant manioc in combination with nitrogen-fixing legumes that will replenish 
and protect weak soils. Exploit unwooded river flood plains with intensive 
cultivation of rice or super-grasses to feed livestock. Grow shade-seeking 
perennial crops, such as pepper and cacao, under otherwise useless secondary 
forest growth, capoeira, on the deforested land. Develop more productive 
agroforestry "consortiums" of different crop trees that thrive together. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to "fix the man on the land" with a sustainable system of 
production. "For every year this person doesn't have to move, it means 'X' 
number of acres that aren't cleared," said John Butler, a consultant with the 
World Wildlife Fund. 
</P>
<P>
But Forest 90's 1,200 participants -- environmentalists and government 
officials -- well knew that as deforestation chews away at Brazil's Amazon 
region, ideas alone will not save the unmatched diversity of its myriad plants 
and animals. 
</P>
<P>
While the impressive flood of ideas offered hope for the Amazon, it also 
underlined a difficult challenge: A monumental effort is needed to sort out the 
various forest-saving possibilities and to put them into widespread practice. 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish the goal, new techniques must be taught, and other assistance 
delivered, to a rural population of 5 million in an area nearly three times as 
large as Alaska. That could require an army of agricultural extension agents. 
Currently, few results of Amazon agricultural research reach farmers in the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Luiz Carlos Molion, a Brazilian climatologist and forest hydrologist, served 
himself a few chunks of river fish from the hotel's luncheon buffet. 
</P>
<P>
"This is tambaqui, but it's undersized," said Molion, 43, a stout man with a 
ruddy face and scraggly russet beard. "They're taking small fish from the 
rivers because the big ones are being fished out." 
</P>
<P>
Demand for tambaqui and other Amazon fish is high: A kilogram of tambaqui costs 
more than a kilogram of beef in Manaus, a city of more than a million people. 
Molion and others who know the Amazon say fish-raising in ponds could become a 
major source of food and income for the region's people, with a low ecological 
cost. But so far, little has been done to implement the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Leonir Naumann is an exception rather than the rule. He operates a farm near 
the village of Bela Vista, 40 miles west of Manaus on the Upper Amazon River. 
And on his farm he has a fishpond, full of maturing tambaqui, tucunare and 
pirarucu. 
</P>
<P>
Naumann, 33, walked along the shore and pointed to fish breaking the pond's 
surface. He said he soon will take his first catch to market and his farm will 
begin to turn a profit for the first time in the 10 years he has owned it. He 
also has 135 head of dairy cattle, but he said poor Amazon soil makes pasture 
maintenance too expensive to be profitable. 
</P>
<P>
He wore sandals and blue shorts, and his tanned shoulders shone like copper 
under the midday sun as he stopped to make a simple calculation: Each cow 
requires 2.5 acres of grazing land, but 2.5 acres of fishpond will produce more 
than 150,000 pounds of tambaqui in three years. He feeds the fish dried cow 
manure and manioc -- a crop he also fertilizes with manure. 
</P>
<P>
About 740 acres of forest has been cleared from Naumann's 4,300 acres of land, 
and he said he will cut no more. "I am against deforestation," he said. "There 
is a lot of deforested land and it isn't being used." 
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 square miles of Brazil's Amazon forest has been razed for 
pasture, an area larger than Oregon. An estimated two-thirds of that has 
degenerated into brush and the secondary forest growth, capoeira. 
</P>
<P>
Agroforestry has proved to be one of the most productive uses of cleared Amazon 
land. Over the years, Sebastiao Silva Martins, 65, has planted a small jungle 
on his plot outside Bela Vista. His trees produce rubber, cacao, oranges, 
passion fruit, mangoes, palm peaches and cupuacu. Some thrive in the shade; 
others grow high, seeking sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
The trees protect the fragile soil from hardening and erosion. They produce 
year after year. The tree farm doesn't require much work, and Martins doesn't 
have to spend money on such things as fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
"The fertilizer is just the leaves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Naumann, Martins gets no help from agricultural extension workers or 
ecologists. He has learned which combinations of trees work best from talking 
with his neighbors and experimenting. In his small way, he has demonstrated 
that farming in the Amazon need not destroy the forest. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest controversy at the conference was about "extractive reserves" -- 
forest areas set aside for residents to exploit without destroying them. The 
government has created four extractive reserves with a total of 5.4 million 
acres and others are being planned. But debate goes on over whether they will 
be economically sustainable in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
Critics said prices for forest products such as natural latex, nuts and herbs 
cannot adequately compensate for the time it takes to gather them. They 
contended that when demand increases for a forest product, it will be depleted 
-- or domesticated for more economical production on farms. 
</P>
<P>
Defenders of the concept argued that markets for new products must be 
developed. They predicted that the forest's hundreds of thousands of plant 
species, many of them yet to be studied, will be a cornucopia of marketable new 
material. And they said forest areas can be "enriched" by planting. 
</P>
<P>
Americans interested in rain-forest conservation already have begun buying ice 
cream and other products made with Amazon ingredients. Some conference 
participants envisioned a boom in demand for "rain-forest chic" products. 
</P>
<P>
"Either we find ways to preserve the forest and improve the lives of the people 
there, or 20 or 30 years from now there won't be any more researchers 
researching the forest, because there won't be any forest," said Julio Barbosa, 
a rubber-tappers union leader. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and government officials at Forest 90 agreed that the Amazon 
should be zoned for forest preservation and controlled development. Jose 
Goldemberg, the national secretary of science and technology, said a regional 
zoning plan is being prepared and will be finished by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Alcir Meira, superintendent of the official Amazon development agency, said the 
agency is drafting its sixth plan for the region. The agency, known by the 
acronym SUDAM, dedicated much of its efforts in the past to fostering big 
cattle ranching projects in the Amazon, granting tax concessions and other 
incentives. But Meira said the new plan will emphasize ecological balance. 
</P>
<P>
"What it will not permit anymore is to give incentives for cutting down forest 
for ranching," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Molion, the forest hydrologist, is creating a new Amazon agency called Unitrop 
that will distribute donated funds for research on ecologically compatible 
development and for extension work. He said one of the first projects to be 
sponsored by Unitrop will distribute minnows and teach farmers to operate 
commercial fishponds. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't need to cut the forest to plant and harvest it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That, in essence, is the gospel according to Forest 90. The future of the 
Amazon may rest largely on whether its message is heard.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They are historic figures, two Western-educated Asian women who rode peaceful 
"people power" revolutions to lead their impoverished nations from brutal 
dictatorship to struggling democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Both, propelled to prominence by martyred men, freed a boisterous press, 
restored civil liberties and were held up as champions of the poor. Both won 
standing ovations from an adoring U.S. Congress in the capital of their closest 
ally. 
</P>
<P>
And both Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto and the Philippines' Corazon Aquino have 
squandered remarkable goodwill and promise through political ineptitude, 
widespread corruption in their administrations and personal arrogance in the 
face of myriad economic and political crises. 
</P>
<P>
Despite similarities, one difference is key: Pakistan's voters go to the polls 
Wednesday to decide whether to give the 37-year old Bhutto another chance. 
Three months ago, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, backed by the military, 
summarily sacked her as prime minister, and there is still a chance she may be 
arrested or banned from political office. Her husband has already been jailed, 
and she is charged in six court cases with corruption and abuse of power. 
</P>
<P>
In Manila, Aquino, 54, grimly hangs on as president after the seventh and 
latest military attempt to grab power, a futile and nearly bloodless revolt on 
the island of Mindanao. She has lasted 4 1/2 years, but her future is no more 
assured. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the lesson is that the transition to a broad-based democracy may be 
much more difficult than the revolution itself," said Maleeha Lodhi, a 
political scientist in Islamabad, Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe you need moderate leaders, gray consensus-oriented figures, rather than 
colorful leaders who are seen as larger than life -- and behave like it," Lodhi 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto's aides insist that her next administration would be better than the 
previous one. "I think she'll be different now," said Yafees Siddiqi, spokesman 
for Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party. "Before, she had all these people to take 
care of. That's why everyone said she was corrupt. Now she's paid off 
everybody. Now she can have a new start." 
</P>
<P>
Aquino has also made some efforts to change her administration's ways. In June, 
frustrated at the legislature's unwillingness to fund or implement her 
policies, she launched a political movement called Kabisig, which means 
"linking arms." It's purpose: to send money and government assistance directly 
to provincial officials and non-government organizations. The effectiveness of 
the program remains unproven, however. 
</P>
<P>
Some say the real lesson here is that Bhutto and Aquino both had to cope with 
unrealistic expectations abroad as well as political and military enemies at 
home. Both inherited bankrupt treasuries, bloody internal conflicts and a 
feudal power structure that offered little room for reform. 
</P>
<P>
One Western diplomat who has served in both capitals just shook his head when 
he compared the two cultures. 
</P>
<P>
"The daily violence, the politics of personality, the dominance of feudal 
families, tribal warlords, a collapsing economy, political goons running around 
. . ., " he said. "How could anyone really take control?" 
</P>
<P>
Still, the expectations were fueled by the sheer drama of their arrival. 
Bhutto's father was Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a populist prime minister overthrown 
by Gen. Zia ul-Haq and hanged after a dubious show trial in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
After 11 years of martial law, Zia was killed in August, 1988, in a 
still-unexplained plane crash. Groomed at Oxford and Radcliffe, and tested in 
squalid prison and exile, Bhutto took over her father's party to narrowly win 
national elections three months later. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino's husband was Benigno S. (Ninoy) Aquino Jr. Chief opponent of President 
Ferdinand E. Marcos, he was jailed for eight years under Marcos' martial law 
and then assassinated when he returned to Manila from exile in Boston in 
August, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
His widow, who called herself a "housewife," took office in February, 1986, 
after fraudulent elections and a civilian-supported military coup in Manila 
forced Marcos and his family to flee to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
But no one said democracy would be easy. Pakistan's 107 million people have 
suffered three wars, three internal insurgencies and three military dictators 
since the nation was carved out of British India as a Muslim homeland in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
Generals have determined Pakistan's politics ever since, running the country 
for 25 of its 43 years. Two prime ministers, a president, several high-ranking 
generals and countless politicians and religious leaders have been 
assassinated. Thirteen governments have been dismissed and three constitutions 
written. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto faced constant suspicion from the generals. They insisted on keeping 
most intelligence and foreign policy operations, showing her only peripheral 
papers. And when she apparently angered them, President Ishaq Khan dismissed 
her. 
</P>
<P>
"When the politicians create a vacuum, the military moves in," said Ayaz Amir, 
an Islamabad analyst and columnist. "It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
The 60 million Filipinos have been lucky in comparison. Manila hasn't had a 
military government since World War II. The army has battled a 21-year-old 
Communist insurgency and occasional Muslim secessionist efforts, but the death 
tolls in both conflicts have fallen. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the 160,000-member Philippine armed forces only became politicized in 
the 1970s under Marcos. Still largely unprofessional, the military rebels have 
only succeeded once -- and that was to throw Marcos out and help install 
Aquino. So far, the top command has stayed loyal to her. 
</P>
<P>
The two women have another key difference. Aquino relies on strong support from 
the Roman Catholic Church in her staunchly religious country. After a coup 
attempt that left 113 dead last December, Cardinal Jaime Sin went so far as to 
declare a coup to be "a sin." 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto, by contrast, the first woman to rule a modern Islamic nation, faced 
critical opposition from orthodox mullahs. Although she wore a traditional 
Islamic head shawl and wed in a family-arranged marriage, influential clerics 
denounced her as an infidel. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Bhutto's ouster came as Pakistan's Parliament was considering a bill 
that would impose the strict Islamic code of sharia as the law of the land. The 
bill, on hold since the political upheaval in August, would allow amputation of 
hands or ears as criminal punishment, ban banks from collecting interest, 
regulate the media and most important, give mullahs the power to decide who 
could be prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
But critics say Bhutto and Aquino share depressingly similar problems as well. 
One is souring relations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is Washington's closest ally in South Asia and the third-largest 
recipient of U.S. foreign aid. The Philippines hosts two of the Pentagon's 
largest overseas bases and is the fourth-largest aid recipient. 
</P>
<P>
Those ties are being severely tested now. On Oct. 1 the Bush Administration 
froze nearly $600 million in proposed military and economic aid to Pakistan. 
Under U.S. law, the aid cannot be resumed unless Islamabad curtails programs 
apparently designed to produce nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In Manila, Aquino infuriated the White House when she refused to meet visiting 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney two months after U.S. Air Force jets helped put 
down rebel troops in the failed December coup. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Washington has declared Manila a danger post for diplomats and 
suspended one of the oldest and largest Peace Corps programs after reported 
threats from Communist guerrillas. The two allies are negotiating now to reduce 
America's huge military presence at Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto and Aquino clearly share other problems as well. Neither has proven to 
be a strong administrator or an able politician. Both have been seen as 
well-intentioned but indecisive, surrounded by corruption and cronyism. 
</P>
<P>
"She has great virtues and great flaws, almost in equal measure," one of 
Bhutto's friends said. "She has courage, perseverance and charisma. But she 
also has a natural arrogance and complete inability to listen to criticism. 
She's surrounding by sycophants. And she's vindictive." 
</P>
<P>
More important, perhaps, neither woman controlled corruption in the Cabinet, or 
even, critics charge, in their own families. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto was stung by still-unsubstantiated allegations that her now-imprisoned 
husband, Asif Ali Zardari, illegally benefited from government contracts, 
kickbacks and unsecured loans. She didn't help his claims of innocence by 
appointing his father, Hakim Ali Zardari, to head the agency responsible for 
investigating official corruption. 
</P>
<P>
In Manila, five of Aquino's relatives sit in Congress, and her younger brother, 
Jose (Teting) Cojuangco, is widely seen as a powerful wheeler-dealer with an 
interest in casinos. But no one has been charged and, unlike Bhutto, no one 
suggests that Aquino has personally benefitted. 
</P>
<P>
No one, however, suggests that Bhutto or Aquino have succeeded in helping the 
poor, either. Both from giant land-owning families and neither has challenged 
the powerful feudal dynasties -- about 40 in Pakistan, 60 in the Philippines -- 
who control legislatures, banks and the huge farms that keep millions of 
landless workers in medieval-like bondage. 
</P>
<P>
Although Pakistan's economy is a shambles, for example, Bhutto refused to risk 
alienating big landlords by tightening tax loopholes. Indeed, she passed no 
legislation except budgets. Poverty and illiteracy, already among the world's 
worst, actually got worse. 
</P>
<P>
In Manila, Aquino let the landlord-dominated legislature gut long-promised land 
reform. Despite marginal economic improvements, a soaring birth rate means more 
Filipinos live in grinding poverty than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
"Changes in government did not change the status quo" in either country, said 
analyst Zahid Hussain. They just transferred power from one set of oligarchies 
to another, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The people-power revolutions weren't what they appeared," said a diplomat who 
has served in both countries. "Everyone expected so much of Benazir. Just like 
Cory. It's really such a shame."

AN ANCIENT LAND OPENING ITS DOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A renaissance of traditional culture is sweeping the landlocked Asian nation of 
Mongolia. Long-ago conquerers of most of Asia and part of Europe, the Mongols 
have lived in isolation under Communist rule since 1921. 
</P>
<P>
But now the Mongolian People's Republic is swinging its doors open to the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
A renewed burst of nationalism is bringing looser ties with the Soviet Union 
and new respect for all things Mongolian. The long-persecuted Buddhist faith is 
in resurgence. Genghis Khan, who united warring tribes nearly 800 years ago and 
set them on their path of conquest, is no longer condemned as a feudal 
aggressor, but rather praised as a national hero. 
</P>
<P>
This year, on the rolling grasslands that surround the capital of Ulan Bator, 
Mongolians have held several traditional "Naddam" festivals, featuring the 
national sports of wrestling, archery and horse racing. One festival marked a 
late-summer visit by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III. Another 
honored Genghis Khan in a celebration of the 750th anniversary of the writing 
of "The Secret History of the Mongols," which documented the famous conquerer's 
life and the history of his people.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A century ago, when peasants from poverty-stricken villages of South China set 
out overseas to seek their fortunes in America, the destination for many was a 
place called "Old Gold Mountain." 
</P>
<P>
That traditional name for San Francisco is used less often today, but the 
vision it embodies lives on. The dreamers now are mostly city people, primarily 
the young, the scholarly or the well-connected. 
</P>
<P>
For most, actually going to America remains an impossible dream. But all sorts 
of people have picked up fairly detailed and generally positive views of the 
United States from Chinese and foreign media, imported films and new personal 
links. Images of the wealth and freedom of American society now pose thorny 
challenges to China's Communist leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"We young people all think the United States is best!" a bright-faced taxi 
driver enthused. "You can do anything you want, can't you? You can leave any 
time you like, can't you? We are stuck here. There is nowhere we can go." 
</P>
<P>
Hard-line Chinese officials view such feelings as fundamental threats to the 
nation -- or at least to their own leadership. An ideological campaign against 
"bourgeois liberalization" -- jargon referring to the spread of Western ideas 
of democracy and capitalism -- has been under way ever since the June, 1989, 
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Ideological indoctrination, combined with tight security measures, may have 
played a role in bringing surface calm to China. But there is little indication 
that many people's views have really changed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite new rules that since January have made it harder for Chinese to get 
permission to study abroad, the visa-application lines outside the U.S. Embassy 
in Beijing have only grown. Student and scholar visa applications during the 
first nine months of this year were up 8% over the same period of last year, 
according to U.S. Embassy statistics. From July, 1989, through June of this 
year, 12,967 applications for student or scholar visas were filed with the U.S. 
Embassy in Beijing, up 22% over the previous 12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the embassy has approved 51% of all student and scholar visa 
applications. Because some people who are rejected may file a second or third 
application, the percentage of individuals who eventually get visas is slightly 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
Of nearly 90,000 students and scholars who have received U.S. visas since 1979, 
only about 28,000 have returned to China. Partly because of this low return 
rate, young unmarried students who apply for student visas are routinely 
suspected of hoping to stay in the United States, and they account for many of 
the rejections. In order to receive visas, they must provide evidence to show 
why they would be willing to return to China. 
</P>
<P>
While students and scholars are in the long term probably the most significant 
category of Chinese going to the United States, large numbers of people also go 
on business or to visit relatives. From April to September of this year, for 
example, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing granted 20,002 visas, including 5,404 for 
students, scholars or their spouses, and 10,828 for business or personal 
visits. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledge and images of the United States are brought back to China by those 
who return, while those who stay abroad have the same effect through letters 
and telephone calls home to family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
Shortwave radio broadcasts in both English and Chinese from the Voice of 
America and the British Broadcasting Corp. reinforce the messages that reach 
China through personal contacts. 
</P>
<P>
Television and movies also play roles. When the movie "Breakdance" was shown in 
China a few years ago, it helped touch off a powerful break-dancing fad among 
high school youth. 
</P>
<P>
Imported U.S. television shows such as "Hunter" or "Falcon Crest," dubbed into 
Chinese, beam images of American life into Chinese homes. American television 
aired here tends to project the overall message that the United States is a 
prosperous, technologically advanced society, but one that suffers a severe 
crime problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The general impression of the United States given by television is favorable," 
commented a government employee nearing retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
All of these factors combine to make American culture and political values into 
powerful forces affecting Chinese society. Most ordinary people seem to welcome 
this, but hard-line leaders in the Communist Party are deeply concerned. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's fears were outlined with unusual clarity recently by 
He Xin, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences who has 
gained prominence as an outspoken backer of hard-line policies. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that in the past 10 years, America's China policy has been a 
systematic one which was worked out after careful consideration," he said in 
comments published by the official weekly magazine Beijing Review. 
</P>
<P>
"For instance, the United States has spent a lot of money on cultural and 
ideological infiltration. On the one hand, it encouraged a corruption of 
Chinese cultural mores, and on the other it guided and supported certain 
intellectuals in an anti-system movement in the name of democracy. In the minds 
of some Chinese, the United States is so perfect, so strong that it looks 
almost like a god." 
</P>
<P>
While judgments about the trend may vary, there is no doubt that respect for 
the United States and support for democratic ideals have penetrated deeply into 
the Communist Party itself. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a Communist Party member, and I will always love China," commented a man 
whose daughter is trying to find a way to study in America. "But China is still 
a feudal state; it is still a monarchy. In your country, Reagan and Nixon had 
little or no influence over politics after they left office. But in China, old 
cadres and their sons control everything, and without holding any formal posts. 
</P>
<P>
"Every country has its ills. But the United States has the best conditions for 
promoting people's natural talents. In general, the United States has the best 
society, economy and legal system in the world." 
</P>
<P>
He Xin, the hard-line scholar, sees such talk as full of risks for China. 
</P>
<P>
He argued that U.S. efforts to promote democracy around the world stem not from 
altruism but from pursuit of selfish goals. 
</P>
<P>
"Do the decision makers in Washington care about Chinese democracy out of the 
pursuit of a spiritual value or out of potential strategic interests?" he asked 
in the Beijing Review article. 
</P>
<P>
Democracy in China, he asserted, would give rise to a "politically weak, lax 
and extremely pro-U.S." government that would be "unable to unite the nation." 
</P>
<P>
"Now, the Soviet Union is facing ethnic separatism and grave difficulties," he 
said. "If China sinks into a breakup and chaos, what would the world be like? 
Once China and the Soviet Union are exhausted with internal disturbances or 
even a civil war, and disintegrated by ethnic separation, what country in the 
world then is able to rival the United States economically, politically and 
militarily? Is this world a pluralistic, democratic world, or a mono-polar 
world centered around the United States?" 
</P>
<P>
It would be the latter, he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
"There is such a blueprint -- a world empire headed by the United States -- in 
Washington's strategic plan," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
His views on democracy and American power largely coincide with those of 
China's top leaders although they seldom phrase them quite so baldly. Fear of 
American dominance is reflected in Beijing's determination to assert a fully 
independent foreign policy and in such positions as reluctance to see U.S. 
forces introduced into the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent analysis entitled "Western Europe Unwilling to Be Drawn into War by 
the United States," the official People's Daily offered the view that "one of 
the purposes the United States hopes to achieve in this (Persian Gulf) crisis 
is to establish, following the end of the Cold War, a new world order under 
American leadership." This is a prospect that even Western European nations do 
not want to see, the article said. 
</P>
<P>
Although He Xin's virulent opposition to American-style democracy is rarely 
echoed by ordinary Chinese, it is not hard to find people whose positive views 
of the United States are tempered by some sense of social realities. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem in the U.S.A. is the surfeit of freedom," an employee of a 
Sino-French joint venture clothing firm commented. "It is more dangerous than 
all other countries because in the States, you can carry a gun. Anybody can 
have a gun." 
</P>
<P>
This person -- who has never been to the United States but who has visited new 
American-style restaurants in Beijing -- also had a more mundane criticism: 
"You all eat fast food -- Kentucky Fried Chicken and pizza. It has no taste. I 
would much rather eat Chinese food." 
</P>
<P>
Most Chinese retain a sense that however attractive American life may seem, 
their own traditions remain superior in many ways. An article by the official 
New China News Agency, for example, dealt with a high school girl named Zhou 
Zongai who was chosen to participate in the opening ceremony of last month's 
Asian Games here. 
</P>
<P>
Zhou, who marched in one of the leading positions for the ceremonial parade 
into the Beijing Workers Stadium, said she and others had studied videotapes of 
young women who had similar roles in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"She said her wish was to keep the inner charm and beauty of Chinese women, and 
meanwhile, borrow the American girls' pleasant manner and vigorous steps," the 
official news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more than anything else, Chinese across the political spectrum share a 
sense that the United States is extraordinarily powerful. 
</P>
<P>
A man who used to work in state-run television said he respects the United 
States for trying to block Iraq's moves in the Persian Gulf. He predicted that 
the Iraqi army would prove tenacious if war breaks out while the United States 
would be hampered by concerns over limiting deaths. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a saying in Chinese that goes, 'The least cultured army always wins,' 
" he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the United States has a role it cannot run away from, he added: "America is 
the world's policeman."

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One image captures many of the contradictions that characterize Turkey's 
taboo-breaking First Lady, Semra Ozal, and her countrywomen. 
</P>
<P>
Wrapped in a white cloth, the wife of Turkish President Turgut Ozal appeared a 
picture of Muslim modesty during a recent pilgrimage to Mecca. But then she 
stood shoulder-to-shoulder with her husband, ignoring other Islamic customs by 
which women should be more deferential. 
</P>
<P>
"I am different from the old presidents' wives," Semra Ozal explained in answer 
to written questions about her role. "I don't sit in the corner and do as 
protocol dictates. I am an active wife." 
</P>
<P>
Turks may soon find out how active. Semra Ozal, 56, brushes off consistent 
reports that she plans to become the Muslim world's second prime minister, 
after Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto. But she is quick to add that "in the future, I 
will not hesitate to enter politics if necessary." 
</P>
<P>
The Turkish First Lady gave the same message to Barbara Bush at the White House 
last month, said a correspondent for Istanbul's Sabah newspaper, who sat in on 
the meeting. America's First Lady even offered to come and help if Semra Ozal 
goes on the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
"Semra is her own woman in a way that no other president's wife has been," said 
Nilufer Gole, a professor of international relations and expert on women and 
Islam in Turkey. "Love her or hate her, we have to admit that she represents 
the aspirations of a broad cross-section of Turks that the elite does not." 
</P>
<P>
That may be so, but she is clearly not without opponents. A poll earlier this 
year for the Turkish Daily News found two-thirds of respondents opposed to the 
idea of her becoming prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Older Istanbul moneyed classes look down their noses at her as a parvenu, the 
daughter of a shipyard welder who was a typist when she met her future husband. 
"She just doesn't have enough class," said one Istanbul professional woman, an 
importer of luxury accessories. 
</P>
<P>
Others disapprove because Ozal is part of the president's "all-in-the-family" 
management style, in which relatives seem unusually often to land top jobs in 
business and government. Turkish caricaturists enjoy depicting the Ozals as 
would-be Ottoman sultans. 
</P>
<P>
"Palace and dynasty may be the wrong words in our age," said the respected 
Cumhuriyet newspaper in an editorial. "But there is the word nepotism in the 
political vocabulary." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Semra Ozal's position has put her in the center of the forces 
competing for the soul of Turkey at an important crossroads of its development. 
</P>
<P>
She stands at the confluence of Turkey's two key political currents -- one 
consisting of an old guard elite, dating back to the foundation of the republic 
by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1923, which generally defends Western secularism, 
and the other composed of resurgent Islamic traditionalists who oppose them. 
</P>
<P>
Mosques are being built at an unprecedented rate in Turkey, whose 56 million 
people are virtually all Muslim, and women's adoption of the head scarf is 
becoming more common. 
</P>
<P>
More disturbingly, four political assassinations have been blamed on Islamic 
terrorists in Turkey so far this year. The last to die, on Oct. 6, was Bahriye 
Ucok, a 71-year-old theologian and politician who has long warned of an alleged 
Islamic threat to women's rights and Turkey as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Semra Ozal publicly identifies herself with secularists who want to keep the 
strictures of strict Islamic law out of Turkey. "Reaction (Islamic 
fundamentalism) is a very sensitive and important subject . . . one must stand 
against the danger," she said in a rare recent interview with Nokta magazine. 
</P>
<P>
A short, plump woman with a taste for fine clothes, she breaks many Muslim 
cultural taboos. She makes no secret of her liking for whiskey, for example. 
She very publicly sent flowers to Turkey's first transsexual nightclub star and 
has only recently given up her old habit of smoking cigars because of poor 
health, according to newspaper reports. 
</P>
<P>
All this may have won her sympathy from Turkey's powerful, secularist army as 
well as those politicians, officials and intellectuals desperately looking for 
someone to take a stand against the rising tide of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
Ozal says the Foundation for the Strengthening and Recognition of Turkish 
Women, which she founded in 1986, seeks to teach women how to make full use of 
Western women's rights as endorsed by Ataturk -- but never fully digested by 
Turkey's Muslim society. 
</P>
<P>
As head of the foundation, Ozal briefly published a weekly newspaper, Turkish 
Woman, in 1988. She also appears regularly on Turkish state television, getting 
more time than some Cabinet ministers. As First Lady, she officiates at 
provincial ceremonies and sometimes represents Turkey abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Ozal has critics among more left-wing women's rights movements. 
</P>
<P>
Her foundation's members, for example, are nearly all wives of rich businessmen 
and favored politicians. They're nicknamed "the Daisies," after their flower 
symbol, and are better known for their parties than their health and education 
work. In Istanbul, Turkey's biggest city whose social services are chronically 
overloaded by a population of 7 million, the foundation helps just one small 
clinic and runs four vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"They look like liberals, but these are just masks," said Sukran Ketinci, a 
writer on labor and women's affairs for Cumhuriyet. "This is just vote-catching 
as the women's wing of the (ruling) Motherland Party." 
</P>
<P>
Leftist women's groups are concerned that behind the scenes, a strong Islamic 
wing in the Motherland Party is pushing not for women's rights, but for more 
Islamic regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The government has quietly passed new laws stressing a traditional view of 
women -- including a requirement that Turkish women associated with 
international organizations uphold "national values," which is shorthand for an 
ideology termed the "Turkish-Islamic synthesis." 
</P>
<P>
A recent report by the State Planning Organization, an Islamic stronghold in 
the Turkish government, complained that rapid urbanization is destroying the 
"sacred" role of the father as chief of the family. 
</P>
<P>
In today's Turkish cities, many bank branches are run by women, and on the 
floor of the Istanbul Stock Exchange, a third of the brokers are young women. 
</P>
<P>
The strict Islamic faction would push this new middle class back into what the 
state planners termed "their sacred role as mothers in the Muslim Turkish 
tradition." 
</P>
<P>
But if Semra Ozal is a model for her countrywomen, it appears the 
fundamentalists will have their work cut out for them. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here in the Flemish-speaking countryside of Belgium, an American-based 
manufacturer of home water-softening systems has figured out how to play the 
export game by European rules -- and to win. 
</P>
<P>
Ecodyne, a sister company of EcoWater Systems of St. Paul, Minn., is complying 
with a strict German standard designed to eliminate the breeding of bacteria in 
home water softeners. The two companies, which are part of Chicago's Marmon 
Group Inc., should be well situated if the German standard, as part of the 
drive toward a single European market, becomes the norm for the 12 nations of 
the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
"We are aware, and we are acting accordingly," Ecodyne's general manager, 
Sylvain Claes, said at his small plant, where mostly American-made parts are 
assembled into water softeners. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't easy for Ecodyne, and it won't be easy for other American companies 
and their European subsidiaries that want to maintain sales in the quickly 
changing European market. The European Community has undertaken an 
extraordinarily tedious and complicated process of setting EC-wide standards 
for everything from infant formula to earth-moving machines. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate purpose of establishing a single European market by the end of 
1992 -- a deadline that will surely not be met -- is to simplify life for 
manufacturers. No longer will they have to make up to 12 different products if 
they want to sell in all 12 EC nations. 
</P>
<P>
But some Americans wonder if there is not a more sinister purpose as well: to 
write standards in ways that confer a competitive edge on European 
manufacturers. This is at the bottom of the fear that the EC-92 movement, as it 
has come to be known, will lead to a "Fortress Europe," open to European 
products but closed to imports. 
</P>
<P>
With a collective gross national product of $4.8 trillion -- just a shade lower 
than the U.S. figure of $5.2 trillion -- the 12 EC countries constitute an 
enormous market. So the concern of American marketers is understandable. 
</P>
<P>
European officials hotly deny the "Fortress Europe" scenario. "Nothing of the 
kind is happening," Martin Bangemann, a German who is EC commissioner for the 
interior market, insisted in a recent interview. "EC-92 is an opening, not a 
closing." 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, interviewed during a recent trip to 
Brussels, said the development of EC-wide product standards should generally 
help U.S. exporters. But whether intentionally or not, he said, the Europeans 
seem to be developing some standards that would effectively close their markets 
to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's easier, sometimes it's harder to do business here," Mosbacher 
said. "There's some movement toward an open market, and I'm heartened by that. 
There are also some serious obstacles left." 
</P>
<P>
American business echoes that view. "There is some suggestion that some groups 
within the EC, particularly in Germany, are determined to keep out non-EC 
products," said Stephen Cooney, an economist with the National Assn. of 
Manufacturers in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, U.S. exports to the EC nations have been booming since 1985, when the 
dollar began losing value on international currency markets and American goods 
became less expensive overseas. Exports roughly doubled from 1985 to 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"By and large," Cooney said, "we view EC-92 as an opportunity to do even better 
in Europe. Whatever barriers there may be on the micro level, we're doing fine 
on the macro." 
</P>
<P>
But at the micro level, some U.S. industrial sectors are running scared. 
Particularly vocal have been timber producers. 
</P>
<P>
John Mentis, director of cross-industry programs for the National Forest 
Products Assn. in Washington, has his eye on a proposed EC standard requiring 
that all softwood products shipped from the United States be kiln-dried. The 
stated purpose is to prevent the introduction in Europe of a timber pest called 
the pinewood nematode. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States and Canada have been shipping green (not kiln-dried) 
softwood to Europe for over 100 years without mishap to European forests," 
according to the forest products group. It argues that the proposed standard 
would freeze out the 85% of Pacific Northwest softwood that is not kiln-dried. 
</P>
<P>
Mentis complained that U.S. interests have been frozen out of the meetings of 
the Brussels-based European Committee on Standardization (CEN, its acronym in 
French) at which the standard was prepared. 
</P>
<P>
Gaston Michaud, the manager of CEN's secretary general's office, conceded that 
until two or three years ago, its deliberations were largely private. Foreign 
representatives are still not allowed to participate, he said, because the 
meetings would be unwieldy. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the agency now provides the American National Standards Institute 
with draft proposals of new standards during the development stage. He said 
American businesses, working through the institute, have ample opportunity to 
comment before standards become final. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Smith, who heads the institute's Brussels office, acknowledged that his 
access to CEN's deliberations have improved substantially in the past two 
years. "We've been finding mostly cooperation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of CEN standards have already taken effect, starting with one 
governing toy safety as of Jan. 1 of this year. Michaud said 220 technical 
committees, with about 700 working groups, are still formulating standards. He 
acknowledged that they would not finish by the end of 1992, as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Home water-softening systems provide a handy illustration of the 
standard-setting process in all its complexity. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 150,000 water softeners are sold annually in Europe compared 
to about 500,000 in the United States -- despite the fact European water is 
generally harder than America's, according to Ecodyne's Claes. Even so, that 
means about $150 million in potential water softener sales on the continent 
each year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
John Scott, director of marketing for Minnesota's EcoWater Systems, is of two 
minds about the EC-92 process. 
</P>
<P>
"At first," he said, "the prospect was exciting that barriers would drop to the 
sale of our products across the 12 EC nations. The concern then became that the 
new norms might be so restrictive that we wouldn't be able to sell anywhere in 
Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Scott's concern had its roots in a controversy in Germany over the danger that 
home water-softening systems can breed bacteria if they are left idle during 
family vacations or other absences. 
</P>
<P>
Claes explained that the German Institute for Standardization, influenced by 
the Greens party, held that systems should regenerate themselves at least every 
four days. Standard No. 19636 lacked the force of law, but it carried 
considerable public-relations weight. 
</P>
<P>
It happened, Claes said, that a German company named Judo manufactured water 
softeners with a four-day regeneration cycle. "The norm was not created to 
promote German industry," Claes said. "But it had that effect." 
</P>
<P>
But he said his company and its sister company in Minnesota were able to 
quickly meet the German standard, allowing it to keep its roughly 15% share of 
the German market. 
</P>
<P>
Culligan, a major American water treatment company, has also met the standard, 
if grudgingly. "The standard is just another defense in Fortress Europe," said 
Michael Maloney, chief financial officer of Culligan's European operations. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Rosuck, president of Culligan International in Northbrook, Ill., said 
the German standard substantially increased the cost of home water-softening 
systems, which cost upward of $1,000 in Belgium. But companies such as 
Culligan, he said, face a choice of meeting national and international 
standards or getting out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
Now, CEN is considering a Europe-wide standard for home water softeners. Or to 
be more precise, Working Group No. 2 of CEN Technical Committee No. 164 is 
debating such a standard. And the German standard is a possible model. 
</P>
<P>
Consulting engineer Yves Henderyckx is the Belgian member of that working 
group. He said trade protectionism -- keeping out American products -- is not 
the motive behind the German water-softener standard. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is any kind of protectionism," he said, "it is protectionism of the 
customer, not of the industry." 
</P>
<P>
Henderyckx, speaking last week on the eve of a meeting of his working group in 
Munich, conceded that the standard-setting process was nothing if not complex. 
Working Group No. 2 has been active for a year and a half, he said, and it will 
probably not finish its work before the beginning of 1994 -- more than a year 
after the EC-92 process is supposed to end. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trade Tensions 
</P>
<P>
CONCERNS AND ANSWERS 
</P>
<P>
U.S. business has raised three basic concerns about the process for setting the 
standards that will govern products to be sold in the 12 European Community 
nations. Here they are, with the responses of Gaston Michaud, manager of the 
secretary general's office of the European Committee for Standardization. 
</P>
<P>
CONCERN 
</P>
<P>
The precess is conducted behind closed doors, and American firms have no way of 
knowing what is going on until it is too late. 
</P>
<P>
MICHAUD'S RESPONSE 
</P>
<P>
"A few years ago it was difficult to talk to us. But now the process is 
transparent." 
</P>
<P>
CONCERN 
</P>
<P>
American and other foreign firms have no way of influencing the standards 
before the Europeans accept them. 
</P>
<P>
MICHAUD'S RESPONSE 
</P>
<P>
"American firms do not have the right to participate; otherwise, we would have 
to allow everyone in, and that would be impossible. But they can comment 
through ANSI (the American National Standards Institute)." 
</P>
<P>
CONCERN 
</P>
<P>
Whether intentionally or not, the Europeans are considering standards that in 
some cases would freeze out U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
MICHAUD'S RESPONSE 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot speak about Fortress Europe. These are words that are no longer 
valid."

CALIFORNIA &amp; CO.: THE SILVER LINING IN HOME-BUILDING GLOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY ANDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least on the surface, it's pretty dismal in the California home-building 
business these days. Drive through Palmdale or Rancho California, two hot spots 
for developers only a year ago, and you'll see house after unsold house. 
Reduced prices and near-desperate marketing are to be found everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
There is no hiding the seriousness of the situation. But among all the 
depressing numbers pouring out of this big industry are some interesting 
tidbits which indicate that things may not be as bad as they seem. They also 
tell an intriguing tale of California's insatiable desire for the detached 
single-family home. 
</P>
<P>
The latest information from the Construction Industry Research Board shows that 
the number of permits to build new single-family homes in the state fell almost 
27% in the first eight months of this year compared to 1989. Permits for 
apartments and other multifamily dwellings, which were already sagging, are off 
another 8.2% so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
Employment in the California construction business, which hit an all-time peak 
of nearly 665,000 only last February, has dropped by 24,000 since then. And 
it's expected to average just 585,000 for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
All this is going to be painful, since home construction has always been a 
major industry in California. This is, after all, the place where housing 
tracts become "planned communities," and the split-level ranch house is 
sometimes considered a California birthright. 
</P>
<P>
But a closer look shows that five big counties accounted for 80% of the drop in 
new permits for single-family houses this year: Los Angeles (down 55%), Orange 
(down 57%), Solano (down 58%), Riverside (down 36.5%) and Contra Costa (down 
35.7%). 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the state's home-building industry may not be booming, but it isn't 
slumping badly either. Some places, in fact, are very healthy. Kern County -- 
which includes Bakersfield -- is up 29%, Tulare County 33%, Shasta County 58%, 
Merced County nearly 8% and even big Sacramento County 4%. 
</P>
<P>
"Outside the high-priced coastal and urban areas, the California home-building 
industry is holding up during this slump," said Ben Bartolotto, research 
director of the Construction Industry Research Board. "The metropolitan areas 
were probably overheated, and prices ran past demand." 
</P>
<P>
That last comment is surely an understatement, considering that home values 
more than doubled in the major metropolitan areas of California during the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
What's happening, however, is more than just a slump in the areas that used to 
be the state's hottest for home building. What seems to be occurring is a 
population shift to less expensive areas of the state. That phenomenon is 
expected to continue, whether we have a bad recession or not. And, because it 
involves mostly white, middle-class families, it could have major political and 
economic consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Before the recent downturn, even in booming Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside 
counties, the biggest growth in home building occurred in areas where land was 
cheapest. The windblown Antelope Valley near Palmdale has been the state's 
single largest area of home-building growth until this year. Although large, 
expensive homes were being built throughout the state, new houses that sold for 
$150,000 or less became the most popular segment of the market. 
</P>
<P>
The demand for such homes was so great that some areas, particularly Palmdale 
and parts of Riverside County, were swamped by development, and municipal 
services simply couldn't keep up. 
</P>
<P>
Now the demand has begun to slacken in some of those areas, mostly due to the 
softer economy. But another factor is at work: Many of those places that became 
popular because houses were affordable have simply run out of places to build 
more $150,000 homes. The newer developments in Palmdale and Riverside County 
often cost much more. 
</P>
<P>
This hasn't stopped Californians, however, from their seemingly indefatigable 
quest for affordable single-family houses. That's why we're seeing explosive 
growth in the Central Valley area, in Sacramento, around Bakersfield and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where the readily developable, affordable land for houses is now," 
said Michael C. McGee, president of the Central Valley division of Kaufman 
&amp; Broad Home Corp. New houses in Stanislaus, San Joaquin and Merced 
counties can sometimes still be found for $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder that 75% to 80% of the families buying new homes built by McGee's 
division are from the San Francisco Bay Area, more than an hour's commute away. 
Many of these people are continuing to work at their old jobs, sweating out 
horrendous commutes in order to live in a new house at an affordable price. 
</P>
<P>
Similar stories are told in Kern County, a two-hour commute from most of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"People moving (to the Central Valley) are looking for the family way of life," 
McGee said. He sees parks full of families with children and crowded shopping 
malls. "Not just couples, but families with children. They are moving here from 
someplace else." 
</P>
<P>
In effect, what he is saying is that families are running away from what has 
become of California's big urban centers. The chase for the $150,000 
single-family home has become so frenetic because people are seeking what they 
hope will be the better lifestyle that goes with it. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the state home-building industry as a whole heads into what promises to 
be a bad recession, the quixotic search for the affordable house goes on. The 
minute a new development opens with houses for sale at or below $150,000, most 
sell out immediately. 
</P>
<P>
So, perhaps the real challenge for California isn't just to perk up a sagging 
home-building industry. Maybe what's written between the lines in the 
home-building statistics these days is a vote of no confidence in urban 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Too expensive. Too polluted. Too difficult. Too dangerous. Too congested. Too 
unfriendly to families. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad.

Man Arraigned in Theft of GM Pictures: Authorities arrested a former photo 
technician for General Motors Corp. on charges he tried to get the auto maker 
to pay $75,000 for stolen confidential photographs of GM cars. Gregory Charles 
Hooper, 36, of Royal Oak, Mich., was charged with mail fraud in a complaint 
filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office. 
</P>
<P>
He was released on bond. The FBI began an investigation June 16 after receiving 
a complaint from GM that some photographs of cars it was working on were 
appearing in magazines. Hooper allegedly tried to obtain $75,000 from GM for 
the return of the photographs, the FBI said. Hooper faces a maximum penalty of 
five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

US West Signs Soviet Phone Venture: The Englewood, Colo.-based regional phone 
firm signed a joint venture agreement to build the first commercial cellular 
telephone network in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed with the Leningrad City Telephone Network Production 
Assn. and the Leningrad Station of Technical Radio Control, involves an initial 
$6-million investment in cellular equipment by a US West unit. The system is 
expected to serve 3,000 customers by mid-1991 and could be expanded to serve

Peru Looking for Buyers for State Airline: Peru, seeking private capital for 
money-losing state firms, has begun talks with U.S. and European airlines with 
the aim of selling off part of state-owned carrier AeroPeru, the airline's 
president has said. AeroPeru President Rodolfo Elmore said that Pan Am, 
American Airlines and the Spanish carrier Iberia, among others, had shown 
interest in buying part of AeroPeru. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, Peru's main domestic and international carrier, has been operating at 
a loss for years. Elmore said in the television interview that its finances 
were in "deplorable condition." Total or partial privatization of AeroPeru 
would first have to be approved by President Alberto Fujimori, who won June 
elections on a promise not to sell off state firms, including AeroPeru.

Smoking Verdict Upheld: A Mississippi judge affirmed the controversial verdict 
in Horton vs. 
</P>
<P>
American Tobacco, a key smoker death case. Jurors last month found American 
liable for the lung cancer death of Nathan Horton, but awarded zero damages to 
his family. Tobacco lawyers asked Mississippi Circuit Judge Eugene Bogen to 
rule that American wasn't liable; plaintiff attorneys asked him to award 
damages or set a new trial on damages alone. Bogen refused to alter the result.

Kemper Released From Hospital: Great American Bank Chairman Robert Kemper, who 
collapsed during a special shareholders meeting Thursday to approve the sale of 
the ailing thrift's 130 California branches to Wells Fargo, was released from 
Sharp Memorial Hospital late Friday afternoon, an S&amp;L official said. Kemper 
underwent a series of "precautionary tests" after admission to the hospital 
Thursday but the S&amp;L would not discuss what sorts of tests or the reasons 
for Kemper's collapse.

LORAL TO SELL 49% STAKE IN FORD DIVISION; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: THE $182-MILLION DEAL WITH THREE EUROPEAN FIRMS WOULD CREATE ONE OF 
THE WORLD'S LARGEST COMMERCIAL SATELLITE BUSINESSES. 
</P>

<P>
Loral Corp. said Monday that it plans to sell a 49% interest in its newly 
acquired satellite division of Newport Beach-based Ford Aerospace Corp. to 
three European firms for $182 million. 
</P>
<P>
Loral, a New York-based defense electronics concern, will sell the minority 
interest in the Palo Alto-based Space Systems division to Aerospatiale Societe 
Nationale Industrielle of France, Alcatel NV of Belgium and Selenia Spazio SPA 
of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The sale is the second major asset of Ford Aerospace to be partially or fully 
divested by Loral before it completes its $715-million acquisition of the 
aerospace and defense company. The sale is expected to close sometime this 
week, said Elizabeth Allen, a Loral spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The deal with the European firms would create one of the world's largest 
commercial satellite businesses, with combined satellite operations revenue of 
$1.3 billion between the partners, challenging Hughes Aircraft Co. and General 
Electric Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some analysts' expectations that Loral will sell the Newport 
Beach-based Aeronutronic division, Allen said the company has no plans to sell 
any other Ford Aerospace divisions. In September, Loral sold Ford's BDM 
International defense consulting subsidiary to the Carlyle Group, a Washington 
investment group, for $130 million. 
</P>
<P>
After agreeing to buy Ford Aerospace in July, Loral Chairman Bernard Schwartz 
promised that he would not break up the operations of Ford Aerospace piecemeal. 
</P>
<P>
But with the sale of BDM and the satellite operations, Schwartz said the 
company decided after examining the businesses that the sale of the units would 
be exceptions to that promise.

AT&amp;T to Raise Long-Distance Rates: American Telephone &amp; Telegraph will 
raise its basic night and weekend long-distance phone prices by 2.2% beginning 
Nov. 2, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the increase will result in about $39.4 million in increased 
annual revenue. That amounts to about five cents on an average $16 monthly 
long-distance bill. AT&amp;T said the increase applies only to out-of-state 
direct-dialed long distance calls made during night and weekend hours. These 
are after 11 p.m. Sunday through Friday and all weekend until 5 p.m. Sunday.

MARKETING: BY KEEPING THE CONSUMER GUESSING, TEASER ADS FLIRT WITH DANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That splotchy red birthmark across Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
forehead might not seem like the sort of thing you'd expect to see advertised 
on a billboard -- or across the side of a bus. But, by golly, it's all over 
town. And next to the familiar forehead is this cryptic clue: "More talked 
about than this." 
</P>
<P>
The same advertiser posted another billboard with a picture of a wrench that 
has "Property of the Pentagon" stamped on it. The only other words on that 
billboard: "A better bargain than this." 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere on either of the billboards is the advertiser named. In fact, there are 
now 2,000 billboards, bus shelters and bus sides in the Los Angeles market with 
the ads. It ranks among the largest outdoor-ad campaigns ever undertaken in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
So why isn't the advertiser identifying itself? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a visual tease," said Cynthia Neiman, marketing manager at the Torrance 
office of Ikea, the Swedish contemporary home furnishings chain that plans to 
open its first West Coast store in Burbank next month. "When you see the 
pictures, they force you to think." 
</P>
<P>
Ikea, which plans to open four more stores in Southern California over the next 
year, has begun slapping its name on all of the billboards and posters. Its 
offbeat campaign is a form of so-called teaser advertising that attempts to get 
consumers involved with its ads by holding back information. The object is to 
attract attention by keeping the consumer guessing. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Los Angeles market has seen a slew of teaser campaigns. They are 
most commonly used when big retailers enter a new market -- or for major movie 
openings. Silo, a home electronics chain new to the West Coast, warned in 
teaser TV, radio and print ads earlier this month that "Silos are coming to 
protect the Southland." Also, the makers of the films "Hunt for Red October," 
"Darkman," "Dick Tracy" and "Batman" relied on teaser ads. 
</P>
<P>
But teaser ads are not just fun and games. They are fraught with risk. Among 
those risks is disappointment. "You don't want the consumer's mind to run 
wild," said Tina Kiesler, professor of marketing at USC. "When you find out 
what the ad is really about, there's always the potential for a letdown." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest risk of all is throwing money down the drain. "Almost no 
one has enough advertising dollars to be out there without saying who you are 
and what you sell," said Bruce Silverman, president of the Los Angeles agency 
Asher/Gould, which creates ads for American Suzuki. Yet Silverman said the Ikea 
and Silo campaigns are effective. 
</P>
<P>
What makes a teaser ad work? "The key is knowing when to get off the tease and 
get on with the advertising," said Bill Lane, executive vice president of the 
West Coast offices of J. Walter Thompson. "With a good teaser campaign, you've 
got the consumers' eyes and ears." 
</P>
<P>
The Ikea campaign is the brainchild of the Los Angeles ad firm Stein Robaire 
Helm. "Everything on the boards relates to Ikea and reflects what the company 
is all about," said agency President Greg Helm. The firm oversaw the purchase 
of outdoor advertising that includes 800 billboards, 600 bus sides and 250 bus 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Silo also embraced teaser ads. The home electronics chain is new to the West 
Coast, but it is a very familiar name in the Midwest. In order to grab 
attention, the chain ran a large numbers of teaser ads -- playing on the idea 
of housing nuclear missiles in silos -- that said Silos were being built here 
in "densely populated" areas "to protect the Southland." 
</P>
<P>
The ads gave a toll-free number to call for more information. Within six days, 
the company received 25,000 calls. Callers -- many of whom feared that missile 
silos were being built near their homes -- were told that it was Silo stores 
that would "protect" them from high prices. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the entertainment capital of the world. So ads here have to be 
entertaining in order to get noticed here," explained Stan Becker, vice 
chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi DFS/Pacific Advertising, which created the 
Silo campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Teaser ads, however, can cause unexpected problems. Not everyone liked being 
fooled by the Silo ads. Seventy-two callers complained to the company about the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Then, just days after the campaign broke, Silo quickly pulled the ads for 
several days after an experimental missile exploded at Edwards Air Force Base, 
killing a civilian employee. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps no industry uses more teaser ads than the film business. In January, a 
teaser campaign for "The Hunt for Red October" began to show up on billboards 
all over Los Angeles. The boards simply said, "The hunt is on." 
</P>
<P>
Because the film opened in March, which is usually a slow time in the film 
business, the studio decided that a teaser campaign would build interest. It 
worked. The film took in $120 million in domestic box office receipts in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"The film business is a business of events," explained Barry L. London, 
president of the Motion Picture Group at Paramount. "You try to create an event 
whenever you can." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latino Agency Wins More B of A Work 
</P>
<P>
It recently created ads promoting special bilingual checks at Bank of America. 
The success of that campaign last week resulted in the Los Angeles office of 
the Latino agency Font &amp; Vaamonde winning the Spanish-language advertising 
business for Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
The size of the business, which was previously handled by Bermudez Associates, 
was not revealed. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of America now ranks as the largest account at the agency's 2-year-old 
office, which also creates Spanish-language ads for Warner Bros. and several 
Procter &amp; Gamble products. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Carnation Business Has Really Blossomed 
</P>
<P>
It all began six years ago when the Los Angeles agency Dailey &amp; Associates 
picked up a tiny piece of Carnation Co.'s business. Last week, Dailey was 
handed an estimated $15 million in new business from the Los Angeles-based 
maker of products ranging from Friskies Dry Cat Food to Carnation Instant 
Breakfast. That made Carnation the agency's largest client. 
</P>
<P>
"We're more like a New York agency," said Clifford Einstein, president and 
creative director of the firm. "People come to us to build brands." 
</P>
<P>
Although Einstein declined to reveal the size of the Carnation business, he 
estimated that his firm now creates ads for more than 80% of Carnation's 
products. The 22-year-old agency also creates ads for E&amp;J Gallo Winery and 
the California Lottery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mendelsohn/Zien Gets Yonex's Golf Account 
</P>
<P>
Pardon the executives at the Mendelsohn/Zien agency if they don't know whether 
to suit up for tennis or golf. 
</P>
<P>
The sports equipment maker Yonex Corp. handed the Los Angeles agency its 
$3-million golf equipment ad business last week. It was previously handled by 
Evans Advertising. Mendelsohn/Zien already handles Yonex's tennis equipment 
business, bringing its total Yonex billings to $5 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
With this win -- and other new business expected to be announced shortly -- 
agency President Richard Zien said he is hunting for several new creative and 
advertising account employees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Magazine Day Event to Focus on Environment 
</P>
<P>
Green used to be the color of money. Now it's the color of environmental 
concern. And environmental issues will top the agenda at the annual Magazine 
Day seminar hosted by the Advertising Club of Los Angeles on Nov. 14 at the 
Beverly Hilton Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The theme of the seminar, "Magazines Make Things Happen," will feature 
authorities on the environment and on print advertising. Gilbert Grosvenor, 
chairman of the National Geographic Society, will moderate a panel discussion 
on the environment. The seminar, which costs $45 for members and $55 for 
non-members, will include two morning sessions and a noon luncheon.

DIGITAL'S LINE TO 'TALK' TO RIVALS' COMPUTERS;

INCOMPATIBLE WITH OTHER LINES. SALES HAVE BEEN LAGGING.

Digital Equipment Corp. said Monday that it plans a major shift in strategy 
toward the "open" computer standards that are gaining increasing popularity in 
the computer industry. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the world's second-largest computer maker was pushed into the 
change by a slumping market for its machines, which cannot easily be connected 
with computers made by other companies or operate their software. 
</P>
<P>
Digital will announce Thursday that it will modify its mainstay VAX computer 
line to run software designed for the popular Unix operating system. 
</P>
<P>
That means companies equipped with both VAX and Unix-based computers could run 
the same software on all, saving the cost of buying or writing a second version 
of the software. 
</P>
<P>
An operating system is the base layer of software than controls a computer's 
internal housekeeping functions. Applications software, such as word processing 
programs, enables computer to perform specific functions. It runs on top of an 
operating system. 
</P>
<P>
Digital said it will release a version of its VAX operating system next year 
that will adhere to an open-system standard called Posix. Posix, in turn, is 
compatible with Unix. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., needs to make its VAX computer 
line more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
"There is clearly a slowdown in orders for VAX," said Jay Stevens, who follows 
the computer industry for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Part of that sluggishness is due to the desire for open systems, but it also is 
due to a delay by customers in ordering new Digital computers while they await 
promised new models, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
One such model, also to be announced Thursday, is a new top-end version of the 
VAX 6000 mid-range computer line. The VAX 6000 model 500 will offer 85% more 
processing power than the current top-end 6000, but cost only 18% more, said 
Stephen Blanchette, the line's marketing manager. 
</P>
<P>
Digital admits that the move to open systems is driven by the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
"It is apparent that open-systems computing is the way of the future, and 
Digital intends to address that market," said Phil Auberg, marketing manager 
for the VAX software line. 
</P>
<P>
While Digital's move is important for a company that has relentlessly promoted 
a proprietary computer line, it isn't unique. NCR Corp. made perhaps the most 
dramatic move into open systems of any old-line computer maker with an 
announcement last month that it will replace its entire product range with 
open-system machines.

Eastman Kodak Co. will announce today new products and standards intended to 
make full-color photographs and graphics more popular in desktop computer 
publishing. 
</P>
<P>
The photographic company says the announcements will build upon a system it 
unveiled last month that stores photographs electronically on compact discs and 
displays them on television screens. 
</P>
<P>
The new products involve software that will tie photos stored on CDs to the 
desktop publishing systems that have mushroomed in popularity in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Kodak has teamed up with a number of leading computer and software companies, 
including International Business Machines Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and Adobe 
Systems Inc., to help popularize the system. 
</P>
<P>
Kodak also will announce a $1,500 color printer to be used to make paper copies 
of the photographs and text from IBM and Apple computers and compatible models, 
Kodak executives said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We see desktop color imaging to be a whole new industry," said John P. White, 
an executive at the Rochester-based company in charge of the new products. 
</P>
<P>
He said the new desktop publishing system is the commercial version of the 
photo CD system announced in September.

<P>
Hans Peter Blochwitz isn't a matinee idol in America. Not yet, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the handsome young German -- who has sung Mozart in most of the 
world's leading opera houses -- couldn't quite fill all 500 seats at Sherwood 
Auditorium, where he offered his first U.S. recital on behalf of the San Diego 
Opera. 
</P>
<P>
Lied specialists have never captured the fancy of the mass audience in America, 
unless they happen to bear names like Fischer-Dieskau or Schwarzkopf. 
Blochwitz, however, has the resources -- vocal, intellectual and emotional -- 
to join the elite. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, his special qualities as artist and technician should not be measured 
in terms of any baritone or soprano model. A lyric tenor, he is heir to a noble 
tradition that embraces such disparate paragons as Karl Erb, Julius Patzak, 
Aksel Schiotz, Peter Pears, Ernst Haefliger and Peter Schreier. 
</P>
<P>
Like these predecessors, Blochwitz is no swashbuckling pirate of the high Cs. 
His voice is light in both weight and color, essentially lean in texture. He 
impresses with subtle nuances, with refined inflections, with delicate dynamic 
gestures. 
</P>
<P>
He is introspective. He is something of a poet. He would rather whisper than 
shout. 
</P>
<P>
At this relatively early stage of his career, his achievements do not always 
match his lofty intentions. He may not maintain maximum tension in moments of 
maximum urgency. He sometimes strains for high climaxes. His rhythmic 
definition occasionally gets blurry. 
</P>
<P>
All this can change, however, and no doubt will. On Sunday, Blochwitz chose an 
extraordinarily discerning, uncompromisingly demanding program and performed it 
with taste and pathos. He deserved his standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
The evening began with a nod to the unjustly neglected Alexander von Zemlinsky, 
a Viennese contemporary of Gustav Mahler. By odd coincidence, San Diego heard 
the same composer's poignant Tagore settings just a couple of weeks ago in 
conjunction with the San Francisco Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
The four marvelously romantic songs chosen by Blochwitz were settings of 
Christian Morgenstern poems: "Schlaf nur ein," "Irmelin Rose," "Voglein 
Schwermut" and "Im Korn." Somehow, the printed program managed to muddle the 
order and get part of the repertory wrong. Unfazed (perhaps unaware), Blochwitz 
sang with disarming textual point and strikingly sweet, pliant tone. 
</P>
<P>
He brought similarly compelling qualities to Schumann's "Dichterliebe." 
Although he might have probed deeper into the tragic implications of Heine's 
texts, his elegant articulation earned constant admiration. 
</P>
<P>
The reserve all but vanished after intermission, when he explored the joy, 
hope, bitterness, despair and bleak resignation of "Die Schone Mullerin." This 
exquisitely measured performance sustained intensity at every expressive level. 
Blochwitz's concentration never flagged as he illuminated the romantic 
vicissitudes of Schubert's daunting cycle. 
</P>
<P>
Certain details will haunt the memory: the hushed legato of "O Bachlein meiner 
Liebe," the poised thread of tone at "Ihr blauen Morgensterne," the nervous 
rapture of "Die geliebte Mullerin ist mein," the numbed serenity of "Gute 
Nacht." 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate impact was shattering. 
</P>
<P>
The audience offered an instant ovation and seemed to want an encore. "There's 
not much you can sing after this," Blochwitz said, with obvious justification. 
Then he sang the "Wanderers Nachtlied" of Schubert -- beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Grunberg provided enlightened collaboration on a seemingly unwieldy 
Steinway piano. Accompaniment would be an inadequate word.

PRAZAK QUARTET OPENS COLEMAN SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Czechoslovakia, which must produce more quartets per capita than any nation on 
Earth, provided yet another highly proficient group, the Prazak Quartet, for 
the season opener of the Coleman Chamber Concerts at Caltech's Beckman 
Auditorium on Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
For their local debut, the Prazaks (the name means, simply, Prague residents) 
-- violinists Vaclav Remes and Vlastimil Holek, violist Josef Kluson, cellist 
Michael Kanka -- presented a Czech program skillfully, if with more restraint 
than might be expected from ensembles of similar provenance. 
</P>
<P>
A half-dozen of Dvorak's "Cypresses," exquisitely soothing lyric miniatures, 
opened the program in unhackneyed, inviting fashion. 
</P>
<P>
For the less familiar of Janacek's two quartets, the work in E minor inspired 
by Tolstoy's novella "The Kreutzer Sonata," the Prazaks added appropriate sonic 
weight and tension. But their interpretation contrasted sharply with the heady 
style to which some of their Czech predecessors have accustomed us. 
</P>
<P>
If some of the Janacek theatricality was in abeyance on this occasion, the 
result nevertheless remained engrossing, with the bonus of a structural clarity 
denied to us in more heated interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
In Smetana's E-minor Quartet ("From My Life") the Prazak again refused to be 
passion's slaves, offering playing of unusual lightness, clarity and technical 
refinement -- at the expense, however, of the gutsiness of Smetana's stomping 
peasant dances. 
</P>
<P>
A single encore, the Minuet from Haydn's D-major Quartet, Opus 20, executed 
with stylish brilliance, served to remind us of the failure of quartets 
visiting this area to program Haydn, and how much the poorer we are for his 
absence. HERBERT GLASS

WORLD PREMIERE OF 'IMPRESIONES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD S. GINELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Glendale Symphony Orchestra music director Lalo Schifrin asked his 
audience to observe a moment of silence for the late Leonard Bernstein at the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion Sunday night, he was paying tribute to a kindred 
spirit. Like Bernstein, Schifrin knows no professional bounds, feeling 
comfortable wherever he chooses to hang his hat as a pianist, composer or 
conductor. 
</P>
<P>
The difference, of course, is the unfathomable gap between true genius and a 
versatile craftsman. Still, the craftsman can shine in the right setting -- and 
with the world premiere of "Impresiones" Sunday night, Schifrin has come up 
with a most engaging concert piece. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by a Federico Garcia Lorca poem, this six-movement, 33-minute trumpet 
concerto is loaded with attractive Spanish- and South American-influenced 
tunes, harmonic colors and rhythms. The scoring is always resourceful, with a 
pronounced Gil Evans influence in the winds, and there are plenty of moments of 
bravado and repose for the flashy, authoritative trumpet soloist, Doc 
Severinsen. 
</P>
<P>
Some might be put off by sweeping melodic passages that threaten to turn into 
the opening credits of a TV miniseries. Yet "Impresiones" easily held one's 
attention over its long haul, a good sign of sound construction. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the concert found the Glendale Symphony in rather mediocre form in 
its season opener. The strings made a messy hash of the admittedly difficult 
Mendelssohn Overture to "A Midsummer Night's Dream," and Schifrin's routine 
reading of Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition" (in Ravel's orchestration) 
lacked the imagination that he displayed as a composer earlier. RICHARD S.

A COMPELLING 'ST. MATTHEW' AT BACH FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Bach Festival has been the pillar of local musical life since 
1934. The current edition ended Sunday with a "St. Matthew" Passion that 
clearly showed why -- a dramatically urgent, musically and spiritually 
compelling reading of a repertory monument. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Somerville presided with characteristic calm and incisive authority over 
the large forces filling the First Congregational Church chancel. He delineated 
the levels of action and meditation carefully, shaping the large-scale scenas 
as attentively as individual choruses and arias, and made sure that the 
ravishing music always carried forward the drama. 
</P>
<P>
The Passions, though, are essentially a musical version of readers' theater, 
and depend on -- demand -- a convincing narrator. In the case of "St. Matthew," 
this fluent storyteller must also cope with an awesome vocal challenge to 
stamina, range and finesse. 
</P>
<P>
Tenor Bruce Johnson did so with consistent glory. The strain could be heard by 
the end of Part I, but he remained an amazingly clear, astonishingly expressive 
Evangelist, one who sounded like an immediate witness to the events he 
described. 
</P>
<P>
As Christ, baritone Kenneth Knight proved equally adept vocally. But almost 
everything he sang was a little too slow for dramatic impact. Somerville may 
have wanted it to contrast with the swift surroundings, but the result sounded 
predicated on the time-dishonored cliche that sacred equals solemn. 
</P>
<P>
Holly Shaw Price supplied a sweet, fluid soprano, as completely committed to 
the textual points as to the sinuous music. Veteran mezzo Florine Hemmings had 
trouble with disappearing low notes, but rose convincingly to the demands of 
"Erbarme dich." 
</P>
<P>
Tenor Alvin Brightbill sang on the very edge of technical control, but with 
clarion sound and thrilling exigency. Bass Michael Gallup offered rich, ripe 
sounds, but did little to distinguish between the bluster of Pilate and the 
submissive sweetness of his arias. 
</P>
<P>
The divided chorus, dominated by the basses, made mighty noises where 
appropriate. It otherwise contributed tellingly phrased chorales and captured 
the reflective ache of the opening and closing choruses. 
</P>
<P>
The crack orchestra, also divided, gave finely detailed support, though 
scrambling to follow Somerville on occasion. Violinists Kathleen Lenski and 
Roger Wilkie, flutists Gary Woodward and Lisa Edelstein, and oboists Peter 
Scott and Electra Reed provided pertinent obligatos, rising to real brilliance 
in Wilkie's case. 
</P>
<P>
Cellist Roger Lebow, buried physically and sonically in the dense mass of 
musicians, also had taxing solos, and anchored an accommodating continuo 
contingent that included harpsichordist Grant Gershon and organist Lloyd 
Holzgraf. JOHN HENKEN

'NIGHT': AVANT-GARDE VOCALS AT SONIC SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A refreshing addition to the madcap, low-budget world of avant-garde vocalizing 
took place Saturday at LACE when French countertenor Frank Royon le Mee and 
local composer/electronic music wizard Barry Schrader performed their 
well-planned opus "Night," a musical collaboration written for voice, electric 
piano, synthesizer and computer, with some minor theatrical elements included. 
</P>
<P>
Nine separately titled sections proceed without pause, each inventively 
exploring different worlds of improvisation and computerized sound, as well as 
more conventional, through-composed parts. 
</P>
<P>
The multistyled whole alternates between virtuosic solos from one or the other 
performers as well as transcendental, more Romantic parts where they perform 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Royon le Mee's clownish use of extended vocal techniques and nonsense syllables 
is most effectively displayed when used to intone the mystically provocative 
Latin text in the neo-Medieval "Night Prayer." In "Night Chimes," his use of a 
small chiming toy, as well as a digital watch alarm, adds some degree of 
silliness, though never crossing the threshold of tastelessness. 
</P>
<P>
In Schrader's masterful electronic settings, rudimentary keyboard noodlings 
become exquisite landscapes of timbres and rhythmic elements. His stoic 
delivery in works such as in the mesmerizing parallel organum of "Night Dreams" 
complements Royon le Mee's wackier antics aptly. 
</P>
<P>
Of four movements in which the duo performed together, the finale -- "La Grande 
Nuit du Silence" -- offers the most variety. The longest of the nine movements, 
it includes a recitation by Royon le Mee of his own French text, as well as a 
carefully blended mix of zaniness and seriousness. GREGG WAGER

DECISION HAILED AS PROPER, CRITICIZED AS OUTRAGEOUS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
To infertile couples, the Johnson v. Calvert decision promises brave new babies 
created in petri dishes, incubated in hired wombs and handed over to their 
genetic parents -- all under the protection of the law. 
</P>
<P>
To surrogation foes, the decision heralds "a modern version of reproductive 
slavery" in which poor women will become "breeders" for rich couples. 
</P>
<P>
But to surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson, Monday's decision granting exclusive 
custody to genetic parents Mark and Crispina Calvert means that she may never 
again see the baby she carried. 
</P>
<P>
There was absolute silence in the packed courtroom Monday as Orange County 
Superior Court Judge Richard N. Parslow Jr. explained his decision to favor 
nature over nurture in defining parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, the decision created an instant uproar, with lawyers, 
scholars, surrogate-brokers and ethicists all sharply divided by the decision. 
All agreed, however, that Parslow's reliance on rights of the genetic parents 
will shape surrogation rulings for some time to come. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly is a landmark decision, and it gives a new description or a new 
interpretation on who is a mother," said Ralph Fagen, director of the Center 
for Surrogate Parenting in Beverly Hills. "The reaction we are getting from 
infertile couples is ecstatic. Today was the first public, official affirmation 
of what parental rights are." 
</P>
<P>
Fagen said the case has drawn interest from would-be surrogates as well as from 
infertile couples. He said the number of women applying to the center as 
surrogates has nearly doubled since the Johnson case was filed. 
</P>
<P>
"People have felt that Anna Johnson had wronged this couple," Fagen said. 
</P>
<P>
William W. Handel, Fagen's partner, said that at least one couple had been 
waiting until Parslow's decision to go ahead with a surrogation contract and 
that now they will proceed. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jeremy Rifkin, founder of the National Coalition Against Surrogacy in 
Washington, D.C., called the decision "outrageous," warned that it would 
exacerbate racial tensions, and vowed that he would work to have it overturned. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a modern version of reproductive slavery," Rifkin said. "We will now 
have poor black women being used as breeders or slaves to produce children for 
white people. The baby brokers and clients are going to be relying on poor 
blacks. We will redouble our efforts to bring the black leadership and the 
civil rights leaders in this country into this battle." 
</P>
<P>
Handel, whose standard surrogation contract was used by the Calverts, rejected 
the argument that hiring surrogates is exploitive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no more exploitive than any other endeavor in which people are 
compensated for the work they do," Handel said. "You can hire a man to be a 
surgeon. You can hire a woman to be a professor. You can have men donate semen. 
So you should be able to hire a woman to provide a surrogacy service as well." 
</P>
<P>
"I want my parental rights," said Johnson, who said she was "heartbroken" by 
the decision. "They've stripped me of my constitutional rights." 
</P>
<P>
Laywers and ethicists, however, said the genetic link between the natural 
parents and the child has traditionally been respected, absent evidence that 
the natural parents are unfit. 
</P>
<P>
"Biology must count in determining parenthood," said Arthur Caplan, director 
for biomedical ethics at the University of Minnesota at Minneapolis. "There are 
reasons for taking away parental rights, but simply having someone act as a 
gestational mother . . . should not be sufficient to void the claims of the 
biological parents." 
</P>
<P>
"We always prefer the biological parents," said Harvard University law 
professor Arthur Miller. "It's almost like the surrogate has been running 
upstream against the historical presumption. . . . What you are talking about 
with the surrogate is an eight-, nine- or seven-month period of time against 
the genetic pull." 
</P>
<P>
The baby's court-appointed attorney, however, sees it more starkly. 
</P>
<P>
"You either have two parents or three parents in this situation, and two 
parents are better," said attorney Harold LaFlamme, who applauded Parslow's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling Monday, Parslow offered suggestions to the California 
Legislature, which, like others around the nation, has been struggling to 
establish a code to cover reproductive options that until recently had been 
unimaginable. 
</P>
<P>
"The in vitro fertilization genie is out of the bottle, and you're not going to 
be able to put it back," Parslow said. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander M. Capron, a renowed medical ethicist who teaches law and medicine at 
USC, acknowledged that infertile couples need options but said that forcing a 
woman to comply with a contract to give up a child she bore "turns a child into 
a commodity and a woman into a machine." Surrogate mothers should be accorded 
the same right as women who surrender children for adoption, Capron said: that 
is, they should have a guaranteed right to change their minds. 
</P>
<P>
"We as a society must recognize the fact that (the surrogate mother) is a 
flesh-and-blood person and not an incubator," Capron said. 
</P>
<P>
Lori B. Andrews, an American Bar Foundation research fellow specializing in 
reproductive technology, said she believes that Parslow's decision is the 
proper outcome, but she said she is "uneasy" with its emphasis on genetics as 
the primary test of parenthood. The intent of the parties in a surrogation 
contract, before the child is conceived, is what should determine parenthood, 
Andrews said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an extremely masculine way to view parenthood, to base it all on 
genetics," Andrews said. "The only way to give men parental rights, since they 
don't physically bear children, is through a genetic tie. That's how that body 
of paternity law evolved. But it's not necessarily a good thing to apply the 
same standard to a birth mother." 
</P>
<P>
She said the genetics-based logic could work against couples who have children 
through "embryo donation," in which one couple's fertilized embryo is given to 
another couple who cannot provide their own sperm and egg. In that case, the 
recipient couple seek to become the parents, but they are unrelated to the baby 
the female partner carries. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's position was buttressed by George J. Annas, director of the law, 
medicine and ethics program at the Boston University Schools of Medicine and 
Public Health. Annas favors the legal presumption that a birth mother is the 
legal and natural mother of a child. That presumption, he said, provides for an 
immediate and certain identification of a baby's mother, and it assures the 
presence of the "mother" to care for the child upon birth, as opposed to a 
prolonged period of uncertainty should the infant be the object of a parentage 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Parslow suggested that only women who have carried a child to term should be 
permitted to enter into surrogation contracts, so that the woman would have had 
some experience in dealing with the emotions pregnancy brings. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also said he would require the natural mother to be medically unable 
to bear a child to avoid "a vanity situation of somebody seeking to avoid 
stretch marks." 
</P>
<P>
A case involving a fertile woman who wishes nonetheless to have a baby borne by 
a surrogate would be a "predictable" outcome of the Johnson case, bioethicist 
Caplan said. 
</P>
<P>
"We know what the ethical problems are. We haven't yet shown the societal 
resolve to come up with some answers, so we are leaving it up to courts," 
Caplan said. 
</P>
<P>
Without a coherent federal standard, Caplan warned, the 50 states might adopt 
contradictory policies on surrogation. "Whether or not you're a parent could be 
function of which side of the state line you're on."

County retirement officials voted Monday to cut in half the pension checks of 
two former San Juan Capistrano city officials and said they may seek to recover 
thousands of dollars the men received in pension overpayments. 
</P>
<P>
While reducing the retirement allowance of former city officials James S. 
Mocalis and E. Phillip Hale, the nine-member County Board of Retirement also 
voted to postpone for two weeks the case of a third former San Juan Capistrano 
employee -- James S. Okazaki -- whose $20,000 annual pension is being 
challenged by the board. 
</P>
<P>
Mocalis, 59, and Okazaki, 63, acknowledged last week that officials with the 
4,000-member Orange County Employees Retirement System were looking into their 
retirement payments and had asked them to justify the amounts. 
</P>
<P>
Mocalis, former city manager and general manager of the Capistrano Valley Water 
District, and Hale, a one-time city administrator and assistant general manager 
of the water district, were told that they had improperly inflated their last 
year of pay by using accumulated sick leave and vacation pay, thereby 
increasing their retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Donald H. Rubin, an attorney for the retirement board, said this was "contrary 
to the way we do things with others." 
</P>
<P>
County retirement benefits for public employees are based on years of service, 
age and the highest annual income, which usually occurs in the last year of a 
worker's employment. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Monday's unanimous vote would reduce Mocalis' annual pension of 
$30,000 and Hale's annual $23,000 each by half. Mocalis told reporters last 
week that his annual county pension was $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Okazaki said retirement officials want to revoke his $20,000-a-year pension and 
force him to repay $60,000 he has already received, contending that he was 
improperly classified as a full-time employee when he was with the city and the 
Capistrano Valley Water District between 1977 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Both Mocalis and Okazaki -- once officials with the Laguna Niguel Community 
Services District -- are included in an unrelated investigation by the county 
grand jury of a 1988 land transaction in which the public's right to 96 acres 
of Laguna Niguel open space was deeded to a private developer. They are 
scheduled to appear before the grand jury Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to reducing their retirement benefits, the board ordered Rubin to 
research the possibility of recovering the overpaid portions of retirement 
benefits paid to Mocalis and Hale over the years. Retirement officials have not 
said exactly how much has been made in overpayments, but say it could be in the 
tens of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Mocalis and Hale can request a formal "evidentiary" hearing if they 
want to challenge the board's decision. It would take place before a hearing 
officer appointed by the retirement board. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would write a letter to Mocalis and Hale informing them of Monday's 
actions and letting them know they can appeal the decision to a hearing 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Wells, assistant county treasurer and tax collector and alternate 
Retirement Board member for Treasurer and Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, said 
Mocalis called during the board meeting asking for more time, but the board 
voted anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin described the situation with Mocalis and Hale as "very unusual." He said 
the board has not dealt with pension reductions of this magnitude during his 12 
years as legal counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Mocalis last week defended his retirement arrangement, saying city officials 
offered him a better retirement package because he had told them he planned to 
move on and they did not want to lose his service. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Mocalis left his post as San Juan Capistrano city manager and signed a 
four-year contract with the Capistrano Valley Water District as general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
One of the points in the contract titled "final employment year" said the 
employee may, in his last year of employment with the district, "elect to 
receive as additional base salary the cash equivalent of any or all of the 
compensations and benefits contained in this agreement." 
</P>
<P>
San Juan City Councilman Phillip R. Schwartze said he was "'puzzled" by the 
retirement board actions. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how the retirement board works," said Schwartze, who was a member 
of the council when he negotiated similar retirement packages with half a dozen 
top city executives. "For all these years they paid the retirement benefits to 
these men and now all of a sudden they are being challenged." 
</P>
<P>
"We were told we were doing the right thing," he said. "It's not up to us any 
more -- it's up to the retirement board."

RARE SHARK IS FILMED, RELEASED;

TAGGED SO THAT SCIENTISTS CAN TRACK ITS MOVEMENTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
After 1 1/2 days in captivity, a mysterious species of shark described as an 
alien appearing out of the depths was allowed to slip back into the sea Monday 
after elated researchers videotaped it underwater and implanted two radio 
transmitters to track its movements. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-foot megamouth shark is the first to survive after being brought to 
shore and the only one in the world ever to be filmed and studied alive. Caught 
accidentally in a fisherman's gill net off Dana Point early Sunday, the 
bronze-colored fish with cavernous, yard-wide jaws and a bulbous head seemed 
healthy and strong when it was released a mile out from the harbor Monday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a bit sad to see him go, but I'm really elated," said Bob Lavenberg, an 
ichthyologist and curator of fishes at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural 
History who was the first one to identify the fish, and who coordinated the 
research. 
</P>
<P>
"This was an opportunity to get knowledge about a really rare fish and an 
opportunity to be environmentally sensitive at the same time by putting the 
fish back where he belongs," Lavenberg said. "It's the best of both worlds. He 
couldn't be better, and now we can get some real science done." 
</P>
<P>
One of the largest sharks in the world, the megamouth -- with its large, round 
head and whale-like appearance -- is intriguing to scientists because its 
appearance is so different from that of other sharks and because extremely 
little is known about it. The male shark caught Sunday, dubbed Mega, is only 
the fifth megamouth ever to be caught or found since the species was first 
discovered off Hawaii 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Relieved that the fish survived but happy that they detained it long enough to 
get their work done, shark researchers now believe they can glean piles of 
information from their videotapes and trackers to better understand the 
megamouth, known scientifically as Megachasma pelagios. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowing life forms will help us tell the story of life on Earth," Lavenberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Underwater photographers working with the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural 
History and National Geographic were awed by what they saw, surfacing with 
vivid descriptions of the creature. 
</P>
<P>
"When you swim right up to it, you know you're seeing something different. It 
has gigantic eyes and big rubbery black lips," said Michael de Gruy, who has 
been filming a documentary on sharks for National Geographic for two years. 
"It's massive, with big, lumbering movements." 
</P>
<P>
The fish, which apparently eats plankton, not meat, seems to be a docile 
species, letting divers touch it, even its mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"He would sort of flinch when people touched him, and his eyes would shift. 
When I swam to his side, he turned and looked at me," said Mark Dell' Aquila, 
an underwater photographer hired by the museum. 
</P>
<P>
The ocean off Dana Point Harbor was turned into an open-air zoo as curious 
people and the news media in boats and yachts encircled the shark, which was 
tied by its tail to the Moonshiner, the boat from which it was caught. Several 
people dove into the water to get a closer look at the shark, while a noisy TV 
helicopter hovered above and jet skis roared in close. There were so many 
people diving that it made the water murky, angering the museum's video teams. 
</P>
<P>
"What a circus!" Lavenberg said. "Only in California can they turn this into a 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
Otto Elliott, a commercial fisherman and skipper of the 38-foot Moonshiner, 
said he caught the megamouth in his gill net about 7 miles offshore about 2:30 
a.m. Sunday while fishing for swordfish. He had to slice open his $5,000 net to 
keep the shark alive, but he said he did so because he knew he had accidentally 
caught a rare, bizarre treasure. 
</P>
<P>
Lavenberg called colleagues around the nation and in Japan but couldn't find an 
aquarium that could take the fish, since it is so big. 
</P>
<P>
A diver with a dart gun implanted two transmitters into the fish that will tell 
scientists how deep and how far offshore it lives. Don Nelson, a nationally 
known shark expert from Cal State Long Beach, plans to track the fish at sea 
for at least two days. 
</P>
<P>
A 1-inch square of muscle was cut out of the megamouth's hide near its dorsal 
fin so that scientists can compare it with tissue from well-known sharks to see 
how the species are related. 
</P>
<P>
Lavenberg described the shark as a "living fossil," a life form that has 
evolved slowly deep in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"This species is at least 10 million years old, and it has changed very 
little," he said. "It shows evolutionary stability over time." 
</P>
<P>
Leighton Taylor, a San Francisco aquarium consultant, is one of a handful of 
shark experts in the nation to become increasingly excited about the megamouth 
since it was captured Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We call ourselves the shark Mafia, and we've been calling each other daily 
about this," he said, adding that there will be "tremendous" new information 
from the videotapes and trackers. 
</P>
<P>
"Man has been a student of fish for 500 years, and he has intensively studied 
them for the last 100 years," Taylor said, "but there's this monstrous fish 
that's eluded us for all these years, except for the last 15 years or so." 
</P>
<P>
To unknowingly help in the quest for knowledge, the shark endured discomfort 
and some minor bruises, since it was tied to the Moonshiner by a rope around 
its tail for 39 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"That's like someone interrogating you for two days," Dell' Aquila said. "It 
was good to see him go after all he's been put through." 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people stood on the shore, some yelling "Let it go, let it go," and 
a Redondo Beach-based conservation group called the Sea Shepherd Conservation 
Society demanded the shark's immediate release. 
</P>
<P>
For a few tense hours at sea while the crew waited for the radio transmitters 
to arrive from Long Beach, the shark looked weak and stressed, rolling over to 
show its white underbelly. Worried, Lavenberg and the crew were prepared to 
release it so that it wouldn't die, but the shark started to perk up and the 
devices arrived in time. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lump in my throat thinking he was going to die," Lavenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
When its tail was untied about 5:30 p.m., the shark righted itself, pointed 
down and swam away strong and fast, "like it was saying 'I'm outta here!' " de 
Gruy said. "Considering what he's been through, he swam off incredibly strong. 
What a feeling it was to see that." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, his wife, Catherine, and his first mate and stepson, Rob Worrell, were 
probably more relieved than anyone else that the fish survived captivity. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can't keep it, we want to let it go. We don't want it to die," 
Catherine Elliott said earlier in the day. "This is something that will go down 
in history." 
</P>
<P>
The divers were fascinated with the megamouth's black lips and two large brown 
eyes covered with a thin milky membrane. Lavenberg also said it was clear that 
the shark had spawned recently because of the condition of its reproductive 
organs. 
</P>
<P>
The copper coloring, the same as most middle-ocean fish, leads Lavenberg to the 
new belief that the shark may thrive in shallower waters than the 700 to 
several thousand feet previously thought. Scientists had believed that the 
megamouth escaped detection for so long because it lived in inaccessible 
depths, but now they wonder if there is some other reason. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we can track him," Lavenberg said. "Maybe we'll find out it just goes 
offshore and hangs out in just 100 meters of water or so. This is exciting new 
information." 
</P>
<P>
The National Geographic documentary on sharks and related fish will be aired in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to present a picture that contradicts the notion of sharks as 
predators eating little old ladies," said Mimi de Gruy, who has been working on 
the film with her husband. "If we can learn a little more about it and gain 
greater understanding and sympathy, that's wonderful."

MEGAMOUTH SHARK 
</P>
<P>
* Megachasma pelagios, commonly referred to as the megamouth shark, averages 
about 15 feet in length and weighs about a ton. The megamouth shark gets its 
name from its wide mouth. It has 236 rows of needle-sharp teeth, and its jaws 
are nearly 4 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
* The huge, round mouth filters crustaceans from the sea, similar to the 
feeding technique of some whales. But much like the great white shark, the 
megamouth appears to be able to jut its jaws forward, pulling in as many 
planktonic creatures as possible. 
</P>
<P>
* Despite the shark's fearsome maw, scientists assume from its soft skeleton 
and flabby muscles that the megamouth is a slow-swimming plankton feeder that 
poses no threat to humans. 
</P>
<P>
* Before the megamouth was discovered in 1976, the only other known 
plankton-eating sharks were the basking shark and the whale shark. Both feed by 
straining minute organisms from surface waters. It is unknown whether the 
megamouth is also a surface feeder. No other shark has the megamouth's bulbous 
snout, jaw-structure, gill rakers (fine sleve-like structures that filter tiny 
deep-sea shrimp out of huge swallows of water) and deep fin grooves.

<P>
GUIDELINES: NEWPORT BEACH COMES UP WITH NEW RULES ON ENCROACHMENT BY BEACHFRONT 
HOMEOWNERS INTO PUBLIC BEACH.

<P>
Ending one of the most contentious issues to erupt in this coastal city, the 
City Council on Monday night voted unanimously to allow some beachfront 
residents to keep seawalls, small patios and sun decks that extend onto the 
public beach. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy, hammered out after more than six public hearings over the span 
of a year, will limit homeowners in the West Newport area to extensions of 15 
feet beyond their property lines, while denying encroachments to homeowners on 
Peninsula Point. Homeowners in a third area, the four blocks east of Balboa 
Pier, will be allowed 7 1/2 feet of patio or fence encroachments. 
</P>
<P>
The policy, which must be approved by the California Coastal Commission, also 
establishes guidelines governing the use of the encroachment area and requires 
homeowners to pay $600 a year in permit fees, or $300 if they live in the four 
blocks east of Balboa Pier. Homeowners have a year to comply with the new 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the toughest issues that the council could have to address, 
because there is no one right answer," said Councilman John Cox. "The people 
who care and care deeply have really studied this issue and have made their 
recommendation." 
</P>
<P>
The new policy is the result of more than a year of study by the city staff, 
the Planning Commission and the Newport Beach Ocean Front Encroachment 
Committee, a citizens' task force. In granting West Newport homeowners the 
extensions, the council upheld the findings of the committee, which had 
requested that 15-foot encroachments be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday night's meeting, a representative of the Peninsula Point Homeowners 
Assn. said that residents in his area would voluntarily remove their 
encroachments in order to facilitate the new city policy. 
</P>
<P>
The encroachments run along a 30-foot-wide easement that was dedicated by area 
developers to the city for a beach road that was never been built. There are 
just under 300 homes between the Santa Ana River channel and the tip of the 
Balboa Peninsula that encroach onto the beach, some by as much as 27 feet. 
</P>
<P>
For years, infringements onto the right of way were unchecked by city 
officials, since there was no regulation governing the property extensions. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night's meeting was attended by more than 125 people, many who came to 
testify about the extension of a pedestrian-bike path along the beach to the 
west and east of the current oceanfront sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
The California Coastal Commission, which must approve any land-use changes 
along the beach, has said that any policy that allows encroachment should 
include mitigation measures that will extend the pedestrian-bike path from 36th 
Street to the Santa Ana jetty and from Balboa Pier to the Wedge. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents speaking at Monday night's public hearing opposed the extension 
of the walkway. "I really don't want to look at the concrete beach," said 
Suzanne Warner, a resident of Seashore Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of beachfront encroachments was first brought to the attention of the 
City Council nearly two years ago by the California Coastal Commission. The 
council appointed a citizens' committee to come up with a policy, which was 
then reviewed by the city Planning Commission. In August, planning 
commissioners voted to allow a 10-foot encroachment and conduct an in-depth 
study on ways to improve public access to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Among the arguments that the property owners and others have stated in favor of 
maintaining some encroachment is that the landscaping, trees and decorative 
walls improve the look of the beachfront. Others say that landscaping and walls 
protect their homes from drifting sand, as well as from the public. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the encroachment have maintained that the public right of way 
should be protected. They also argue that the property owners should have to 
pay for the use of the land, since it represents among the most valuable real 
estate in the county.

CAR ORDINANCE GETS INITIAL APPROVAL

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has given initial approval to an ordinance that bans cars from 
being left on private property without permission. 
</P>
<P>
"The ordinance is geared to cars for sale that are parked in shopping centers," 
said Ray Kromer, assistant city manager. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big problem when there's 30 to 40 vehicles being left on the weekends, 
making it look like a used car lot." 
</P>
<P>
The police have been unable to get rid of the cars because until now, the 
municipal code has not addressed the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The ordinance comes in response to citizens' concerns," said Mayor Laurann 
Cook. 
</P>
<P>
In another auto-related matter, the council has delayed making a decision on 
whether Coastline Community College should be allowed to hold an auto exchange 
on its parking lot at Warner Avenue and Newhope Street. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed auto exchange would allow cars for sale or trade to be parked at 
the Coastline property on the weekends. The permit fee charged to auto owners 
who use the lot would go toward educational programs at the college. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission rejected the auto exchange in July because of concerns 
about traffic and impact upon the neighborhood, and the college appealed that 
decision to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The council postponed a decision on the auto exchange until Jan. 15 to give the 
college an opportunity to present its case to community leaders. ROSE APODACA

<P>
After a 10-month search for a new planning director, the city has hired Michael 
W. Brotemarkle to fill the vacancy left by Frank Schuma. 
</P>
<P>
Brotemarkle has worked for the community development departments of five cities 
in Southern California and has managed two private consulting firms that 
handled environmental and redevelopment planning. 
</P>
<P>
He currently resides in Orange but lived in Fountain Valley for eight of his 30 
years in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"When the job became open I immediately said yes," Brotemarkle said. "All my 
kids were born in this town, and it's like coming back home." 
</P>
<P>
Among Brotemarkle's first jobs will be to assist in revising the city's General 
Plan, a blueprint for commercial and residential construction over the next 10 
years. That project will begin this December and take about 18 months to 
complete.ROSE APODACA

<P>
The planning staff is recommending that the commission eliminate 6,250 square 
feet of shops included in the developer's proposed restaurant complex. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Chodos, builder of the downtown redevelopment project, says the retail 
space is necessary to make the complex financially viable. 
</P>
<P>
But in a staff report, city planning officials maintain that the shops are "not 
necessary to serve the beach-going public." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council has tentatively scheduled a Nov. 5 meeting to consider giving 
final approval to the project, which has sharply divided council members and 
planning commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
Pierside Village is a proposed complex of as many as five restaurants to be 
built on bluffs next to the Municipal Pier at Main Street and Pacific Coast 
Highway. The land is now paved for street-level beach parking. 
</P>
<P>
Critics argue that the project would block ocean views and ruin the beach's 
natural atmosphere, while supporters contend that it would attract more 
visitors who, because of the project's plazas and promenades, would also have a 
chance to see the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the retail-space issue, commissioners said they have concerns 
about other details of the project, including the adequacy of parking 
facilities and a potential state Lands Commission lawsuit to bar the 
development. 
</P>
<P>
However, commissioners interviewed Monday said they believe the proposal will 
be approved, although slightly modified. 
</P>
<P>
Project critics have charged that Chodos and council proponents have pressured 
commissioners to quickly approve the proposal so that the council could vote on 
it before the Nov. 6 election. Voters will elect at least three new council 
members and decide whether to approve two ballot measures, including a 
limited-growth initiative that would likely block Pierside Village if it has 
not yet been approved. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, if I were the developer, I'd say this has been the biggest stall 
I've seen in years," said Commissioner Ken Bourguignon, referring to the 
commission's repeated postponements of its Pierside Village decision. JOHN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GRIM LOOK AT EFFECTS OF DRUG ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Standing in the hot sun outside Capistrano Valley High School, the white makeup 
on Joann Villanueva's face had already begun to melt and Eddie Snyder sweltered 
underneath his grim reaper costume. 
</P>
<P>
But the reason for these disguises wasn't Halloween; it was the dangers of drug 
abuse that are being publicized throughout Orange County and the nation as part 
of Red Ribbon Week. 
</P>
<P>
Schools and communities are holding various events this week to discourage drug 
use, from pep rallies to parades. 
</P>
<P>
At Capistrano Valley, 37 students donned white makeup to represent the 
estimated number of drug-related deaths in the United States each day. Snyder, 
dressed as the grim reaper, pulled students out of class, painted their faces 
white and returned them to their seats as "corpses," unable to talk or 
communicate. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the school day, all 37 students gathered in a line in front of 
the campus, as motorists and other students passed by. 
</P>
<P>
"A few people were smart alecks, but overall I think we got the message 
across," said Snyder, a sophomore drama student who volunteered to be the grim 
reaper. 
</P>
<P>
But there were others who didn't take the "death" of their classmates as 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"(The other students) told me I was stupid for painting my face white," said 
ninth-grader Sara Fielstra. "People just don't understand the seriousness of 
drugs. They just think, 'Oh we're going to die anyway, someday.' " CHERYLANNE

CITY OFFICIALS' GROUP ASSAILS NEW FEES LAW; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: DELEGATES AT A STATEWIDE CONVENTION CRITICIZE THE LEGISLATURE FOR 
ALLOWING COUNTIES TO CHARGE CITIES FOR SUCH TASKS AS PROCESSING PROPERTY TAX 
BILLS AND BOOKING PRISONERS INTO JAILS.

<P>
Waving protest signs, about 3,000 city officials from across California 
demonstrated Monday against the state Legislature's surprise passage of new 
fees that cities must pay to county governments. 
</P>
<P>
In passing the state budget this year, the Legislature enacted a law allowing 
county governments to charge cities for processing their property tax bills and 
to charge fees for booking city prisoners in county jails. Cities never before 
had to shoulder those costs. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose Councilwoman Iola Williams, state president of the League of 
California Cities that is meeting this week in Anaheim, said lawmakers realized 
they did not fund counties adequately in this year's state budget. She said the 
Legislature's solution was to tell county governments that they could obtain 
the needed money by imposing new fees on cities. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like not giving a kid his allowance, but telling him to go out and mug 
someone to get it," Williams said. "It's costing cities millions of dollars. 
And we're sending a clear message to the Legislature: we're mad as hell and 
we're not going to take it any more." 
</P>
<P>
City officials want lawmakers to rescind the authority of the counties to 
impose the new fees, which came unexpectedly and at a time when most urban 
governments were already financially drained. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said cities have been forced to cut their budgets to pay the new fees 
to county governments. Some counties are charging up to $180 per prisoner to 
book people into jail, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no uniformity in the booking fee," said Scott Summerfield, director of 
communications for the city of Newark in Northern California. "The cities are 
already seeing abuses in the law." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the league worries that the booking fee may cause some police not 
to make arrests in money-strapped cities. "Police may be thinking, 'Do I want 
my city to have pay $180 for this booking?' " she said. "It's a problem I don't 
want our police to have to face." 
</P>
<P>
During the protest, league delegates carried signs with messages for state 
lawmakers. One sign said: "Do your job; we're doing ours." Another said: "Don't 
balance your budget on our back." 
</P>
<P>
"This was an impressive demonstration," Summerfield said. "We've got some 
fired-up city officials here." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the protest does not mean that cities are angry with counties 
about the budget situation, adding: "We're angry at the Legislature and the 
(Deukmejian) Administration for doing this." 
</P>
<P>
Summerfield said the league estimated that at least 3,000 of 3,300 convention 
delegates took part in Monday's demonstration outside the Anaheim Convention 
Center. The session began Sunday and lasts until Wednesday.

STATE ADDS 5 MORE FREEWAY SOUNDWALLS TO LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Transportation Commission recently added five more freeway 
soundwalls to the list of 13 already scheduled for construction in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, residents have waited 20 years after their homes were built for 
the state to approve the soundwalls, which include: 
</P>
<P>
* A $3.9-million soundwall along the Riverside Freeway between East Street and 
State College Boulevard in Anaheim due in 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
* A $2.2-million wall on the Orange Freeway between Yorba Linda Boulevard and 
Rolling Hills Drive in Fullerton also due in 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
* A $1.6-million wall on the Garden Grove Freeway between Beach Boulevard and 
Yockey Street in Garden Grove scheduled for 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
* A $1.8-million wall along the Santa Ana Freeway between Ball Road and Lincoln 
Avenue in Anaheim slated for 1996-97. 
</P>
<P>
* A $3.1-million wall between the San Gabriel River Freeway and homes on Martha 
Ann Drive in Rossmoor, where ground will be broken soon. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 13 walls previously given state priority, three are under design by a 
consultant hired by the Orange County Transportation Commission.

RAMS JUMP ON OWN BANDWAGON AFTER WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One victory, one little leap to a 2-4 record and suddenly all is well again 
with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, they were 1-4 and feeling at rock bottom. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't even see the light of day two days ago," Coach John Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
But Monday, the Rams didn't need excuses, statistical examinations or an 
embarrassed coach to explain their plight. 
</P>
<P>
All they needed was to point to the NFC standings, accept the compliments for 
the 44-24 pounding they had given the Atlanta Falcons Sunday and begin talking 
about how their early-season emergencies are vanishing. 
</P>
<P>
One victory, and the sinking feelings are history. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've crawled out of the hole and we're back in the race," Robinson 
said. "I think there are a couple of guys way out in front of us, but 
surprisingly, there are a number of people, when you think wild card, who are 
not very far in front of us, who have yet to negotiate a couple of holes that 
may be up there for them, too. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can get going and really start to improve now, then I think we can make 
this into a good season." 
</P>
<P>
Only six NFC teams have better records than the Rams, and only three of those 
-- the San Francisco 49ers, Chicago Bears and New York Giants -- seem 
particularly uncatchable. 
</P>
<P>
And, including the Rams, seven teams -- one-half of the conference -- have 2-4 
records. Thanks to the addition of a third wild-card team this season, six 
teams in each conference make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
So even if it's more a matter of the rest of the conference falling back than 
the Rams' rise into the playoff hunt, the Rams can dream of better days. 
</P>
<P>
And the rest of the conference is courteously allowing them that luxury. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see much difference in teams in the NFL, with the clear exception of 
those that you would put at the top," Robinson said. "There's a lot that 
happens from now. I think things begin to take shape, teams begin to settle 
into oblivion and others begin to try to stay in the hunt for whatever playoff 
opportunities they have. 
</P>
<P>
"Go down the NFC list. Who's going to be good? Damned if I know. It's the club 
that seems to come alive now that has a chance to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done this before. We've had down periods and have come back strong from 
them. We hope we can do it again." 
</P>
<P>
If anything, the Rams hope the last month of trauma has made them stronger, 
tighter as a unit and ready for the long road ahead. 
</P>
<P>
And after Sunday's solid defensive performance against a wide-open Atlanta 
offense that would have seemed designed to plunder the Rams' previously weak 
pass defense, they were convinced the tough times are through. 
</P>
<P>
"This team has been through a lot the last six games, and we're going to be a 
better team for it," quarterback Jim Everett said. "I think this is going to be 
a turning point, after all we've gone through." 
</P>
<P>
Said Robinson: "I guess if you survive a beating it makes you stronger. I don't 
know whether that's masochistic or not. I think we did all of this staying 
together. I think there's a certain sense of pride in that. 
</P>
<P>
"In the course of the last month, a couple of coaches have been attacked in 
terms of not doing their job, of being in jeopardy of losing their jobs. Those 
are all difficult things to deal with. I think we all dealt with it OK." 
</P>
<P>
The man who had to deal with the most negative attention was defensive 
coordinator Fritz Shurmur, who said the last thing he wanted was for the 
players to begin worrying about his job security. 
</P>
<P>
When the point was raised publicly last week, Shurmur said he went to his 
players and told them to ignore the talk and concentrate on winning, not saving 
his job. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a quality defensive effort, one that Shurmur thinks was more 
about personal pride than coaching survival. 
</P>
<P>
"All I did was say that, 'Hey, let's not any of us get so involved with this 
job situation thing that it's a factor,' " Shurmur said. "Because my job is not 
the issue. The issue is we as a group of people getting ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RAMS NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
HIGHLIGHT: HENRY ELLARD 
</P>
<P>
Sunday was just another day for one of the NFL's premier receivers -- six 
catches for 109 yards and one touchdown. On one reception -- late in the second 
period -- he fully extended himself to make a leaping 26-yard catch of a Jim 
Everett pass; on another, with 3:45 gone in the third quarter, he left a 
stunned Delon Sanders frozen at the Falcons' 10-yard line where he had cut to 
the left sideline. The Fesno State grad then cut back to the inside and was all 
alone to take Everett's reception, Ellard eclipsed Elroy Hirsch's 33-year-old 
Ram record (6,289 yards) for career receiving yardage. Ellard's total stands at 
6,312 for his seven-plus years pro career.

Cruz, who has lost only one set in Angelus League play this season, led Rosary 
to victories against its two toughest league opponents, which moved the Royals 
into first place. Tuesday, Cruz won, 6-4, 6-0, 6-4, and Rosary defeated Santa 
Margarita, 11-7. Thursday, she won, 6-1, 6-0, 6-0, in a victory over Mater Dei. 
The Monarchs had defeated Rosary, 10-8, in the teams' first meeting of the 
season when Mater Dei's No. 1 singles player, Erika Asmuss, who is Cruz's 
friend and doubles partner in age-group competition, defeated Cruz, 6-4. Cruz 
said she was ready for Thursday's rematch, but Asmuss played doubles because of 
a hamstring injury that slowed her. Cruz easily defeated Asmuss' replacement 
and the rest of her competition, and Rosary's No. 2 singles player, Mandy 
Gomez, also swept her sets as the Royals won on games, 77-70, after the match 
ended in a 9-9 tie. "We were really ready for them," Cruz said. The victory 
over Mater Dei, the second-ranked team in the Southern Section 2-A Division, 
gave the third-ranked Royals (13-3, 4-1 in the league), a half-game lead over 
second-place Santa Margarita (3-1 in league). Santa Margarita and Rosary play 
again Nov. 1.

EX-ORANGE DEVELOPER GETS 8-YEAR TERM FOR MORTGAGE-LOAN SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Orange developer Kent B. Rogers was sentenced Monday to eight years in 
prison and ordered to pay $70.7 million in restitution for his role in a 
massive mortgage-loan scam that has cost Bank of America about $118 million. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors said the restitution equals the largest ever levied in a 
bank-fraud case, which was imposed in August against David A. Feldman of Palos 
Verdes, co-defendant of Rogers and the major figure in the complex scheme. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Dickran M. Tevrizian further ordered that a receiver be put 
in charge of Rogers' assets to ensure the restitution, which is to be paid to 
San Francisco-based Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers pleaded guilty earlier this year to two counts of mail fraud for helping 
to sell more than $144 million in mortgage loans to 20 banks and savings and 
loan, almost all of which went into default despite assurances that they were 
completely safe. 
</P>
<P>
Announcing the indictment of three men including Rogers last May, the U.S. 
attorney's office said the scheme -- whose principal outlet was National 
Mortgage Equity Corp. of Palos Verdes -- was "one of the largest single frauds 
ever perpetrated on our nation's banks and saving and loan associations." 
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleged that defendants conspired to coax lending institutions 
throughout the East and Midwest to buy into large pools of mortgages on Sun 
Belt property. They offered the institutions high-interest-bearing mortgages 
and assurances from underwriters that the borrowers could pay their debts. But 
the companies making those representations were linked through the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers and the others were accused of using inflated appraisals, insider 
dealing and worthless guarantees to draw the institutions to invest in 
California real estate during 1982-1984. More than 97% of the mortgages 
defaulted. 
</P>
<P>
The Bank of America was forced to reimburse institutions who lost money because 
it served as an escrow company and trustee for the bad mortgage pools. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, who was indicted with Feldman and George C. Ash of Alta Loma in May, 
1989, controlled several companies involved in the scheme, including two Orange 
companies, WestPac and Nevada Western Pacific Financial. Rogers allegedly 
obtained millions of dollars in loans for providing a variety of fraudulent 
services, including furnishing inflated appraisals. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Leslie A. Swain claimed Monday in U.S. District Court in 
Los Angeles that Rogers had pocketed more than $44 million in loan proceeds, 
something his attorney vehemently denied. 
</P>
<P>
"Where he spent that money we haven't been able to trace," Swain said. "Mr. 
Rogers is an incorrigible con man." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, 51, was previously convicted on bankruptcy fraud charges in another 
case, and Swain said he had even falsified records pertaining to the time he 
spent doing community service, a condition of his probation. 
</P>
<P>
"What you see is a history of Mr. Rogers thumbing his nose at the justice 
system," said Swain. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, a former Huntington Beach resident now living in Riverside, appealed to 
Tevrizian for leniency. He said he was mostly guilty of poor judgment and 
should have removed himself from doing business with his two co-defendants, 
Feldman and Ash. 
</P>
<P>
Tevrizian sentenced Feldman last August to 15 years in jail and ordered him to 
pay $70.7 million in restitution. Ash was sentenced to two years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sorry that I didn't disengage from that crowd earlier," Rogers said. "I'm 
not real sure I understood the depth of what they were doing." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Norman D. James challenged federal claims that Rogers pocketed 
tens of millions of dollars in the scheme, saying his client made less than $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone assumes it went in gold bars over to the Marshall Islands and that is 
not true," said James. "Very little profit was made by Rogers, if any." 
</P>
<P>
Tevrizian ordered the restitution after an appeal from Bank of America, which 
asked the court to award damages under the federal Victim and Witness 
Protection Act of 1982. 
</P>
<P>
James unsuccessfully appealed for a delay in deciding restitution, citing a 
number of civil suits against Rogers that also seek penalties. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they (Bank of America) need this court to act as a collection 
agent," said James. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers was ordered to report to Dec. 19 to begin his prison term. He will be 
eligible for parole in about three years.

$5-Million Sale: Irvine-based Laser Precision Corp., a maker of test and 
measurement instruments, said it has tentatively agreed to sell its Analytical 
Division to New Jersey-based Air &amp; Water Technologies Corp. for an 
estimated $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The final purchase price will be paid in cash and notes due within three years, 
and is subject to due diligence, including confirmation of the value of certain 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
The Laser Precision division, also known as Analect Instruments, makes 
laboratory equipment based on infrared light technology, said spokesman Neil G. 
Berkman. The unit accounted for $6.5 million of the company's $26 million in 
sales in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The sale is not expected to have any impact on the division's 72 employees, 
said James Johnson, general manager of the unit. 
</P>
<P>
Laser Precision now plans to focus on its fiber-optic and light-sensitive 
instrument technology, which is based in Utica, N.Y. Proceeds from the sale 
will be used to develop new products and expand international marketing for the 
remaining divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Air &amp; Water Technologies Corp., based in Branchburg, N.J., provides a broad 
range of environmental services for air-pollution control, water-resources 
management, and the disposal and recycling of waste. The company also has an 
environmental products division in Irvine with about 100 employees. 
</P>
<P>
For the second quarter ended June 30, Laser Precision reported net income of 
$111,000, down from $264,000 a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter rose to 
$6.8 million from $6.7 million a year earlier.

HIGHER R&amp;D COSTS KEEP NET EARNINGS DOWN AT BECKMAN 
</P>

Citing greater research and development expenditures, Beckman Instruments Inc. 
said Monday that net earnings increased only 2.1% to $9.6 million in the third 
quarter from $9.4 million for the same three-month period in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Beckman, a manufacturer of medical diagnostic equipment, said 
sales increased to $201 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30, up 7.7% from 
$186.7 million in the third quarter of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Net earnings for the first three quarters of the year dropped to $26.2 million 
from $31.5 million. Sales for the nine months were up slightly to $589.4 
million from $586.2 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
The company blamed slow sales this year on limited budgets at publicly funded 
research laboratories, which are some of the Fullerton-based company's biggest 
customers. There are fewer research grants available to those labs, the company 
said, so they're not purchasing as much equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Some labs, too, are leasing equipment from Beckman rather than purchasing it 
outright, which "has had the effect of stretching out sales revenues" over 
longer periods of time, said Beckman President Lou Rosso in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Net income for the first nine months of the year was down in part because the 
company has increased its research and development budget to $59.7 million 
during the first three quarters, a 17% increase from last year. 
</P>
<P>
New products from this research should help Beckman expand its market share 
"during a time of relatively weak demand" for diagnostic equipment, Rosso said. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock closed at $12.75, up 12.5 cents in trading Monday on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
BECKMAN'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, Beckman Instruments reported a 7.7% increase in revenues 
and a 2.1% increase in net earnings. Figures are in millions, except amounts

VENTURE ALLIANCE, PLATING COMPANY MERGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Venture Alliance Group of Santa Ana and Prime Plating Inc. of Los Angeles 
announced their merger Monday and said the new entity would focus on the 
acquisition and consolidation of electroplating firms. 
</P>
<P>
The new company, Prime Industries of Santa Ana, will employ about 90 people and 
have annual revenues of more than $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Rudy A. Berti, president and chief executive of the new firm, said he plans to 
bring technical and waste management expertise to the electroplating industry, 
which he described as "crippled with poorly managed companies." He said many 
firms are hurt by a lack of self-regulation and by a lack of knowledge of 
federal environmental requirements.

Pacific Scientific Co., a manufacturer of industrial and aerospace products, 
said Monday that it has shut its operations in Puerto Rico and moved the 
manufacturing of one product line to Weymouth, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Plat, senior vice president for finance and administration, said the 
company laid off 165 workers in Puerto Rico but that those layoffs have been 
offset by hiring at other company locations. 
</P>
<P>
He said the company's work force remains at about 1,800. 
</P>
<P>
Plat said the company sold one of its Puerto Rican subsidiaries and moved the 
second subsidiary to Weymouth, Mass., in order to improve its manufacturing 
efficiency. He said the company will incur a one-time charge against earnings 
of about $300,000 in the third quarter as a result of the move. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it was more efficient to centralize the business in existing 
facilities and eliminate overhead and transportation expenses," Plat said. 
</P>
<P>
One product line, a cable-tension testing instrument, was sold to the 
division's Puerto Rico-based management for about $800,000. Plat said the new 
Puerto Rican company has hired some of the workers who were laid off. 
</P>
<P>
The company's outdoor lighting control product line has been moved to Weymouth, 
where about 200 people have been hired at the company's Fisher Pierce plant, 
boosting total employment there to 385, Plat said. 
</P>
<P>
For the third quarter ended Sept. 28, Pacific Scientific reported earnings of 
$1.2 million, up 9% from $1.1 million a year earlier. The company reported 
revenue of $46.2 million, up 12.1% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Edgar S. Brower, chairman and chief executive, said the company has a strong 
backlog of $95 million and he noted that he anticipates continued strong sales 
of the company's fire suppression equipment, robotics and automation equipment, 
and air contamination detection systems.

'BEYOND SHELTER' PROGRAM WAGES WAR ON HOMELESSNESS BY PROVIDING FAMILIES 
LONG-RANGE HOUSING ALTERNATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL QUINTANILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes, late at night -- in the quiet, in the dark -- Maria Ortega would sit 
outside her family's desert home in Michoacan, Mexico, and dream of a better 
life in El Norte with her husband, Federico. The dream was to have a house with 
a shiny new kitchen, carpeted floors and, the most important luxury, real beds 
with box springs and clean sheets. 
</P>
<P>
But eight years later, the Ortegas' life was anything but a dream. They lived 
in a cardboard shack barely five feet high, with no gas or running water, a 
single dangling light bulb above a small refrigerator and a mattress shared by 
her five children while she and Federico slept on a concrete floor. 
</P>
<P>
The Ortegas, legal residents who immigrated to the United States in 1982, paid 
a monthly rent of $100 for that nightmare. They spent one-third of their income 
from Federico's job as a warehouse employee in downtown Los Angeles to live in 
an East Los Angeles chicken coop. 
</P>
<P>
Today the Ortegas live in a spacious three-story, four-bedroom, two-bathroom 
Whittier townhouse for $221 a month. The fulfillment of their dream -- the 
subsidized rent, the stainless steel sinks, beds for all the children, the 
security and the dignity -- is a result of a concerned social worker who heard 
about their living conditions and sent them to Beyond Shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit social service agency secured move-in money -- first- and 
last-month's rent, plus a security deposit -- and enrolled the Ortegas in a 
government subsidy program that allows low-income tenants to pay rent on a 
sliding scale. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond Shelter is a new twist in the war against homelessness. While more than 
160 shelters and programs throughout Los Angeles County offer temporary relief 
from two weeks to two months, Beyond Shelter founder Tanya Tull says she wanted 
to focus on permanent housing. By tapping into existing housing funds offered 
by state and local governments, Beyond Shelter aims to do just what its name 
implies. 
</P>
<P>
Tull says her 18-month-old agency has placed 105 families, including 300 
children, in permanent housing across Los Angeles. The apartments range from 
townhomes in upper middle-class neighborhoods to units in government-subsidized 
buildings. Depending on a family's income and the requirements for several 
rental programs, rent ranges from $160 for a family of two to $650 for a family 
of five or larger. 
</P>
<P>
About 75% of Beyond Shelter's families are single mothers with three or more 
children who have an average monthly income of $800. Because many mothers 
cannot afford child care, they do not work and they receive Aid to Families 
with Dependent Children, food stamps and supplemental government assistance. 
About 20% of Beyond Shelter's clients are employed; the majority receive 
minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
A former Los Angeles County social worker, Tull, 47, is president of Para Los 
Ninos (For the Children), a Skid Row social service agency she founded in 1979 
that now has an annual budget of $1.4 million. Four years later, Tull 
co-founded the nonprofit Los Angeles Family Housing Corp., which develops 
low-cost housing for families with children. She also helped start two 
temporary shelters for the homeless, the Gramercy Place Shelter in 1986 and 
Chernow House two years later. 
</P>
<P>
After a private donor contributed $50,000 in start-up money, Beyond Shelter 
opened its doors at 4032 Wilshire Blvd. With a staff of 11 people and a budget 
of $310,000 for its first operational year, the agency is still developing 
support and awareness of its work "to inform people, especially interested 
landlords, that there are solutions to homelessness," says Tull, who adds that 
she is also seeking financial support from several foundations, corporations 
and private individuals. 
</P>
<P>
The screening procedures for families take several weeks. "We will only work 
with families who want to work with us," Tull says. "We lay out all the cards 
on the table, everything about their family history, their problems and what 
they want for their future." 
</P>
<P>
Apartments are secured from landlords "empathetic, not sympathetic to the 
homeless," Tull explains, and clients' move-in costs -- which can be as much as 
$2,500 -- are paid from government resources including the state's Homeless 
Assistance Program, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and foundations 
and social service agencies such as On Your Feet. Homeless families, Tull says, 
are usually unaware of these resources. 
</P>
<P>
Nicole Pagourgis, co-founder and director of On Your Feet, says her program has 
provided almost $80,000 for rental assistance, furnishings and for getting 
utilities turned on for 85 Beyond Shelter families. 
</P>
<P>
Started 19 months ago, the privately funded On Your Feet is designed to "get 
people back into housing," Pagourgis says. "There are a lot of good programs in 
the city and we work with those programs, but the neat thing about Beyond 
Shelter is that it shares our philosophy. We both feel that emergency 
assistance is not enough. The whole goal of what we are doing collaboratively 
is to break the cycle of homelessness. You do that by getting people back into 
permanent housing and you do everything possible to keep them there." 
</P>
<P>
While Pagourgis, Tull and others agree that temporary shelters cannot solve the 
homeless problem, they agree that the shelters are crucial. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Schwartz, executive director of Shelter Partnership, which in the last two 
years has distributed almost $5 million in food and goods to the homeless in 
Los Angeles County -- estimated at 160,000 -- says that she and Tull visited a 
Washington-based agency that focuses on permanent housing before Beyond Shelter 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been so busy with building emergency shelters and getting people the 
emergency food, it's only now that communities are catching their breath and 
asking 'What is missing from the system?' 
</P>
<P>
"Many shelters just don't have the time to find permanent housing. Some have 
very good housing referral programs, but any time you specialize you get to use 
all your talents, which is why Beyond Shelter is special. It devotes all of its 
resources to permanent housing," Schwartz says. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a great need for the shelter system," Pagourgis adds. "But it isn't 
complete. The road from homelessness to self-sufficiency is a difficult one. It 
takes customized, financial services, follow-up time and all this is a very 
expensive thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
In order for a family to receive help from Beyond Shelter the head of the 
household must sign a one-year contract agreeing to work with the organization 
in meeting goals toward becoming self-sufficient. Families must agree to pay 
the monthly rent, not damage the apartment, get counseling for family problems 
as well as learn how to budget a welfare check. 
</P>
<P>
The contract, although not legally binding, "helps establish trust, commitment 
and dignity between the family and Beyond Shelter," Tull says. 
</P>
<P>
All families are counseled on their rights as tenants as well as their 
responsibilities to their landlords. With a family case worker at their side, 
the family reviews a "Survival Skills" handbook -- written in English and 
Spanish for Beyond Shelter clients -- that is filled with information about 
money management, budgeting, housekeeping, telephone numbers of social services 
and other resources in their area as well as maps of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond Shelter case workers are in contact with families at least once a week, 
often concluding visits with information about health benefits or where to go 
for literacy classes. 
</P>
<P>
So far, only 10 families have been dropped from the program because they didn't 
pay their rent; they damaged the property, or they were housing additional 
occupants in their apartment. Four of the families returned to shelters. The 
others moved in with relatives or left the state. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, Tull plans to link with agencies that will provide job training and 
development for its clients. 
</P>
<P>
She also is working on the first apartment building to be owned by the agency, 
Columbia House, a 41-unit complex that will have on-site services for formerly 
homeless and at-risk families. Beyond Shelter has received $3.9 million -- 
primarily government funds -- to purchase and renovate the building located 
near MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Scott, vice president of Envoy Property, a management company in West Los 
Angeles, oversees 1,000 apartment units throughout the city. She says several 
property owners have agreed to work with Beyond Shelter because they wanted to 
do something to take care of the homeless, including tenants who are formerly 
abused women, mothers with disabled teen-agers and drug addicts undergoing 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
"And Beyond Shelter doesn't let the tenant get away with anything," Scott says, 
adding if a tenant is late in paying the rent, Beyond Shelter intervenes with 
counsel -- not cash -- to help the family and landlord resolve the problem. But 
such instances are rare, Scott adds. 
</P>
<P>
Adele Elliott, occupancy supervisor for American Development Corp., a property 
management company with 1,300 apartment units, says, "So far we are batting 
100%" with Beyond Shelter clients. 
</P>
<P>
"I really do think that is due to the support and assistance the families get 
with that agency. They are told and shown how they need to manage from this 
point on. They aren't just shoved into an apartment and forgotten. Beyond 
Shelter is there from the beginning to end. I need that," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Says Tull: "I have been in the middle of the homeless and housing problem for a 
long time. When I started out in this work, the problems seemed so simple 
because we always had housing back then. If they were on welfare, the welfare 
they received was enough. If they worked, their income was enough to afford a 
place to live. But that just does not exist anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"Society has dug deep pits for homeless people and we have taken away the 
ladder. I have watched us create a sub-class called 'homeless people' and we 
think that their needs are different than ours. They're not. They want a roof 
over their heads, too." 
</P>
<P>
Maritza and Simon Lopez, the parents of four boys, ranging from 1 to 13 years, 
were living in a one-bedroom Van Nuys apartment, struggling to make ends meet, 
when they were evicted last year. The family couldn't afford to pay a rent 
increase. The youngest boy, Simon Jr., was barely 2 months old then. 
</P>
<P>
"They let me go back inside the apartment to get diapers and milk for the 
baby," Maritza recalls. Maritza, 29, took her children to a nearby motel where 
she took a room and called her husband at work. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, the family was in a North Hollywood shelter because they 
couldn't afford to live anywhere else. Simon, a roofer, depends on contract 
work, which is sporadic. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed at least $1,200 to move into a place and we just didn't have that 
kind of money. Then, we'd need money to turn on the light and gas," she says. 
So with the $650 the family was able to save from jobs Simon, 28, had worked, 
they bought a used Chevy Impala. 
</P>
<P>
"We only had 30 days to stay at the shelter and our time was running out. We 
thought we'd live in the car until we could figure something out," she says. 
Luckily, the family found transitional housing at another shelter for 60 days. 
Before their time ran out there, they were referred to Beyond Shelter. 
</P>
<P>
This December, the Lopez family -- with a monthly income of $800 -- will 
complete its yearlong contract with the agency that put them in a 
three-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath apartment with central heating and air conditioning. 
Beyond Shelter helped them secure move-in costs of $1,014 and the family hasn't 
been delinquent on the monthly $457 rent. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you how happy my family has been this past year," Maritza says 
while showing off a bedroom -- decorated in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle sheets 
and "Dick Tracy" curtains -- that is shared by brothers, Edwin, 13, and 
Richard, 7. Jonathan, 5, shares a room with Simon Jr. The furniture, from beds 
to a dining table and chairs to the living room's sofa and lamps were provided 
by the Better Homes and Gardens Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"All our bills are up to date and my kids aren't sick like they used to be from 
all the moving. We feel settled. When we were homeless, my husband and I felt 
embarrassed of our situation. We isolated ourselves from our family and 
friends. We dropped out of sight." 
</P>
<P>
These days Maritza says the children are more focused on school. So is she. 
Maritza, who dropped out after the 10th grade, wants to earn her General 
Equivalency Diploma. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband and I want our kids to get a good education. That's the most 
important thing. That and having a good, clean place to live. And maybe in the 
next three to five years, hopefully, we will get a down payment for a house, 
something to call our own." 
</P>
<P>
The Ortegas -- who once lived in the chicken coop -- have similar hopes. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when my husband first told me about this apartment," Maria Ortega 
says, thinking back. Her husband, Federico, instructed her to keep her eyes 
closed as he escorted her inside the apartment. Standing in the living room, he 
placed his palms over her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"When he moved his hands I almost lost my breath," she says. "Then I cried, 
then I wrote a letter to my mother. We've even sent photos to relatives in 
Michoacan," she says excitedly while cradling the youngest of her six children, 
7-month-old Maria de Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
Maria points out the kitchen's generous cabinet space, the shiny stainless 
steel sink, the linoleum-covered and carpeted floors. She shows off the 
apartment's modest furniture her husband has worked hard to obtain. She walks 
into all of the bedrooms where the children, who all used to sleep on one 
mattress, now have their own beds. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the apartment, photos of her children behind paper frames Maria made 
herself, are tacked on walls. Back in the kitchen Maria reflects on her past 
and her future. 
</P>
<P>
Just thinking about how she and her children used to live and how they live 
now, "is the difference between a nightmare and dream come true," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no money to move into an apartment," Maria says. "We barely had enough 
money for food and coats for the children. The children would wash up and bathe 
with a water hose. My husband and I slept on the floor on top of blankets. 
Whenever we went to find another place to live, the landlords didn't want 
children or they only allowed two or three. And we didn't have the money." 
</P>
<P>
Maria turns toward a sliding glass door, the drapes open, sunlight bathes her 
little girl's face. She kisses the child and looks skyward. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, the children would ask, 'Mommy, why don't we have a regular house like 
our friends do?' You know what? They don't ask anymore. They bring their 
friends and show them. Finally, we have a place to call home."

JOSEPH N. BELL: REACTIONARIES KEEP UP MASQUERADE AS CONSERVATIVES IN O.C. 
ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Journalist and philosopher Ambrose Bierce once defined an American election as 
"a strife of interests masquerading as a contest of principles." We've got an 
election coming up in a few weeks that seems to fit this definition rather 
snugly, especially in the area of candidates who mislabel themselves or their 
opponents as "conservative" or "liberal." No staples of American public life 
have been so drained of meaning and so misused as these two. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the assassination of John F. Kennedy (in Orange County, ever since 
the election of Millard Fillmore), "conservative" has been in and "liberal" has 
been out. So the route to public office has more often than not been for all 
sorts of reactionaries, Know Nothings and economic Brahmins to wrap themselves 
in the panoply of "conservatism" and win elections by attacking "liberals" who 
are defined as permissive airheads or card-carrying leftists who either want to 
spend the country into oblivion or sell it out to the communists. 
</P>
<P>
That's about the level at which George Bush won the presidency and also seems 
to be the level at which the governorship of California and a passel of other 
lesser state and local offices are being contested in 1990. And in the process, 
these two time-honored and once meaningful political terms, liberal and 
conservative, are once more being bludgeoned into insensibility. 
</P>
<P>
Webster is instructive on this point. He defines conservative as "tending to 
preserve established traditions or institutions and to resist or oppose any 
changes in these; moderate, prudent, safe." 
</P>
<P>
If you weigh this definition against some of the people who pass for 
conservatives in Southern California, the scales are going to shout TILT. Was 
it, for example, either "moderate" or "prudent" of Rep. William E. Dannemeyer 
(R-Fullerton) to insert a graphic description of the sexual activity of gay men 
in the Congressional Record? Or to compare Nelson Mandela -- when he was an 
invited guest in our country -- to convicted atomic spies Ethel and Julius 
Rosenberg? Or of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach) when he suggested that 
the Persian Gulf crisis might have been avoided if the CIA were allowed to 
assassinate whomever our government decides are the bad guys in the world? 
</P>
<P>
What is Assemblyman Dennis Brown (R-Los Alamitos) conserving when he votes no 
almost automatically on every piece of environmental legislation that crosses 
his desk? And where is the moderation and prudence when Los Angeles Police 
Chief Daryl Gates tells a U.S. Senate committee that "casual drug users ought 
to be taken out and shot?" Or when Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) calls 
men who support the abortion rights movement "women trapped in men's bodies . . 
. who are like camp followers looking for an easy lay?" Or when a field 
representative of Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) says that "we want 
people to know that (homosexuality) is not just wearing a pink shirt and being 
an interior decorator?" 
</P>
<P>
Can you imagine legitimate conservatives -- like Barry Goldwater or Pete Wilson 
or William Buckley or -- for that matter, Orange County's current state 
senators, Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) and John Seymour (R-Anaheim) -- 
making such statements or performing in such a way? 
</P>
<P>
Most of the people noted above are reactionaries masquerading as conservatives. 
(Webster defines a reactionary as one who favors "movement back to a former or 
less advanced condition or stage.") Or, as former President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt put it: "A reactionary is a somnambulist walking into the future 
backwards." 
</P>
<P>
Our political system is built on the checks and balances of a plural society. 
Within that balance, there is an absolute need for both the conservative and 
liberal viewpoints to be expressed by people who understand the imperatives of 
this type of society. Just as the true conservative would work to conserve and 
preserve our freedoms and traditions, the true liberal (defined by Webster as 
"tolerant of views different from one's own and favoring reform or progress 
tending toward democracy and personal freedom for the individual") would look 
for ways to better adapt the system to always-changing times and conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Challenging the patriotism or personal integrity of either group is not only 
nonsense but terribly counter-productive. And, let's face it, most of this has 
been done by the so-called "conservatives." Richard M. Nixon climbed the rope 
of communist-baiting to the highest office in the land. And George Bush got 
considerable political mileage out of hanging around Michael S. Dukakis' neck 
the Democratic presidential candidate's membership in the American Civil 
Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
If Dukakis had had either the wit or the courage not just to acknowledge but to 
embrace his ACLU membership, he couldn't possibly have hurt himself more than 
the reaction to the gelatinous position he did take. And if an ACLU membership 
is perceived as hurting a candidate nationally, it blows the mind to think what 
it might do in Orange County. Yet, this organization has probably supported as 
many conservative as liberal causes and has deep roots in preserving and 
protecting American values. But in spite of this, it is known to most Americans 
not for the positions it takes and believes in stead-fastly but rather for the 
"liberal" tar-and-feather job done on it for years by reactionaries calling 
themselves conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
And this sort of thing is getting worse, not better. As we regress into the 
bumper sticker slogan and TV sound-bite political campaigns that take place 
today, politicians arm themselves with symbols (like the ACLU or "no new taxes" 
or George Bush's favorite ex-con, Willie Horton) to beat voters around the ears 
instead of trying to engage their minds with issues and ideas. And the cynics 
rule the day. 
</P>
<P>
If you want an awful example, hold your nose and take a quick look at the 
current campaign for the California Assembly between incumbent Curt Pringle 
(R-Garden Grove) who got to the Legislature in the first place when his party 
leaders intimidated Latino voters and Democratic candidate Tom Umberg. God 
knows, they differ enough on the issues without resorting to personal 
vilification. This could have been a legitimate contest between conservative 
and mildly liberal philosophies of government; instead, the candidates have 
demeaned both points of view with their tactics.

To go back to where we started, maybe the cynicism of Ambrose Bierce is the 
only honest place to come down these days. He might have been talking about 
1990 instead of a hundred years earlier when he said, "A conservative is a 
statesman who is enamored of existing evils, as distinguished from the liberal 
who wishes to replace them with others."

BREEDING BIRD: WHITE-THROATED SWIFT (AERONAUTES SAXATALIS) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Description: Easily recognizable from other North American swifts by its white 
underparts and contrasting black side patches below the wings. Length is six to 
seven inches. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Breeds mainly on coastal cliffs and canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Aerial foraging, captures flying insects. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: Mate in flight; pairs tumble together end-over-end as they copulate. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: Built deep inside crack or crevice of a canyon wall; feathers glued 
together and to wall with saliva. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: Creamy white, unmarked; four-fifths of an inch in length. 
</P>
<P>
Conservation: Site tenacity (a tendency to return to nest site or breeding 
colony) has been disrupted by increased housing development on coastal cliffs 
and canyon areas, forcing swifts to nest in cracks of building walls. 
</P>
<P>
Voice: High-pitched jejejejejeje, in descending tones. 
</P>
<P>
Breeding bird atlas: To report bird breeding activity in your neighborhood, or 
to get information on the breeding bird atlas, call Sea and Sage Audubon 
Society members Sylvia Gallagher, (714) 962-8990, or Nancy Kenyon, (714)

STOP-GAP SEEKS EXPRESSIVE PEOPLE TO ASSIST WITH DRAMA-THERAPY WORKSHOPS

It's a peaceful night in Anaheim, and Dollie and Tekla are sound asleep. 
Suddenly, smoke engulfs the bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
"I smell smoke!" Dollie exclaims. 
</P>
<P>
"What should we do?" Tekla asks. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's call 911!" Dollie says. 
</P>
<P>
"Freeze!" says Tekla. 
</P>
<P>
The classroom at the Anaheim Senior Day Center is quiet. 
</P>
<P>
Tekla is an improvisational actress from Stop-Gap, a nonprofit theatrical 
production company based in Santa Ana that uses improvisation to help groups 
role-play issues that have significance to them. 
</P>
<P>
Tekla comes out of her character to address the class about how and when to use 
the emergency 911 number. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think in this situation we should immediately call 911, or do you think 
we should try to get out of the house and call from a neighbor's phone?" 
</P>
<P>
Responses ring out from the classroom, but as a whole the group decides it's 
best to get out of the house. Tekla and Dollie resume their improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
It's drama-therapy programs like this that are the basis for Stop-Gap. Whether 
it's a workshop for a small group or a large-scale theatrical production on 
stage at the South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, Stop-Gap uses theater to 
discuss social issues specific to its audience. 
</P>
<P>
The company has performed before senior citizens, juvenile offenders, battered 
women and others, and has dealt with such issues as date rape, acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome, racial tension, drug abuse and everyday living. 
</P>
<P>
Stop-Gap's theater "is used to empower different groups we work with," says 
Robert Knapp, program director and resident playwright. "We do a lot of 
improvisation to get them (clients) up to role-play parts about issues that 
would have significance to the lives of the whole group." 
</P>
<P>
Stop-Gap is seeking expressive volunteers to help with its programs. 
"Volunteers are currently needed in every area," says Jessica Stuart, program 
coordinator. "We need help making the sets on the major productions, but mainly 
we need volunteers for the drama therapy program, to actually be in the 
improvisation. If someone is interested, they must decide which program they're 
interested in, what time suits them best and come and watch a program a few 
times before committing. 
</P>
<P>
"Volunteers must make at least a six-month commitment to the same program every 
week." 
</P>
<P>
Stuart says Stop-Gap is "not looking for any great performances. No theater 
training is required. The improvisations are a lot of fun because you get to 
act and you are helping a lot of other people." 
</P>
<P>
The drama-therapy programs are conducted between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. at various 
county locations. Volunteers must provide their own transportation. 
</P>
<P>
For information, contact Jessica Stuart at (714) 648-0135. Stop-Gap is at 523 
N. Grand Ave. in Santa Ana.

ACTOR'S ILLNESS CANCELS A 'SWEET SORROW' SHOW

The Hull Truck Theatre Company, a visiting British ensemble, was forced to 
cancel Alan Plater's "Sweet Sorrow" in mid-performance during a Saturday 
matinee at the Irvine Barclay when one of the actors became ill. 
</P>
<P>
During the play's second act, Jeffrey Robert indicated to the audience that he 
could not continue performing and left the stage, according to Barclay 
President Douglas Rankin. 
</P>
<P>
Robert was rushed by paramedics to Irvine Medical Center with symptoms that 
"sounded like an impending heart attack," Rankin said Monday. Rankin said the 
actor was admitted to the hospital for observation and released Sunday after 
his symptoms were diagnosed as resulting from "low blood sugar." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Saturday evening performance was canceled, Rankin said, the last 
two performances of the company's engagement took place on Sunday as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Like the other actors, Robert portrayed multiple roles in "Sweet Sorrow," a 
play about the late British poet Philip Larkin. JAN HERMAN

<P>
AIDS STORIES: A 20-PHOTO EXHIBIT PICTURES THE TRAGEDY AND HOPE OF THOSE WITH 
THE DISEASE. 
</P>

<P>
Two Orange County artists have set out on a mission of sorts, a campaign of 
pictures and words designed to help counter what they feel is a pervasive 
atmosphere of ignorance, fear and hysteria shrouding the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
Mary-Linn Hughes and Jerry McGrath have assembled a traveling exhibit of 
photographic portraits of county residents who have AIDS or have tested 
positive for HIV. Additionally, there are photos of others affected by the 
disease, such as medical professionals and AIDS patients' parents, friends and 
lovers. 
</P>
<P>
"Our idea is to show that these are your sons, your daughters, your neighbors," 
McGrath said recently. "These are real people, living here. The exhibit is 
anti-NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard), so we called it 'This Is Our Yard.' " 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to interrupt the hysteria and fear by allowing viewers to hear 
peoples' stories," Hughes added, citing as indicative of the hysteria last 
year's successful initiative in Irvine which deleted language from an existing 
ordinance that extended anti-discrimination protections to homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty large color portraits make up the exhibit, which is showing at Irvine 
Valley College Gallery Hall through Nov. 9. About half depict people with AIDS 
or those infected with HIV. Accompanying each photo are responses by each 
subject, in English and Spanish, to the question: "What do you want your 
neighbors to know about your experience with AIDS?" 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the intimate, candid narratives are painfully tragic. Writes 
Marge Goebbel after the illness took her son, Alan: "AIDS was the intruder into 
our lives. Months of anger, fear, hate and love. I was the last one to give 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Talamantez-Nevarez, a ruggedly handsome man photographed beside his 
motorcycle, conveyed his uncertainty of living with HIV: "Will I get sick? Is 
this a symptom? How much time do I have? What is death? Will anyone love me?" 
</P>
<P>
But much of the writing reveals a positive outlook, courage and optimism, a 
brightness like that in many of the portraits. In fact, the physical effects of 
AIDS are apparent in only one photograph. Among the others are those of a 
beautiful young woman sitting in the sun and a young man in his patio, smiling 
broadly like a Cheshire Cat. 
</P>
<P>
Where other photographers have taken a distinctly different approach, 
portraying the disease's corporeal devastation, McGrath and Hughes said they 
had something else in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways, we wanted to interrupt those assumptions (about the deleterious 
effects of AIDS) and show that there are people living with this disease," said 
Hughes, who for the past three years has led a self-portrait photography 
workshop in Laguna Beach for AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Phillip Wenthur, for instance, is pictured smiling up from the sparkling 
turquoise water of a swimming pool. He writes that this year his health has 
never been better since he was found to have AIDS in 1986 at age 28. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I have AIDS does not mean I think less of myself or should just sit at 
home, anticipating death. I have found that AIDS is at the center of my life, 
and I am enjoying myself, helping those around me that have been affected by 
the HIV virus." 
</P>
<P>
Writes John Rolling Thunder: "For myself there is no battle with the dis-ease 
(sic), just total surrender to one of life's challenges. I am not dying from 
this dis-ease either. I am living." 
</P>
<P>
While some photographed for the exhibit have not been so fortunate, others who 
had been very sick "are doing better now," McGrath added. "I think that's 
important to know. A lot of people don't want to be seen as needing pity." 
</P>
<P>
The upbeat element was one reason that the collaborators chose to shoot color 
photographs: McGrath had seen many "scenes of the horrific" in black and white. 
Color is also more realistic than the "abstract" alternative, he said, and 
helps carry the message that those pictured are "your neighbors" in the Orange 
County community, not feared casualties or mere numbers in a statistical study. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath, 36, and Hughes, 35, met as undergraduates at Cal State Fullerton and 
found their first participants through Laguna Shanti, the AIDS service 
organization where Hughes conducts her workshop. Later, other local agencies 
helped. The pair developed rewarding relationships and a certain intimacy with 
those they photographed: One session with a bulky, large-format camera took 
seven hours. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an experience," said McGrath, who coordinates the photography program 
at Irvine Valley College. "We got to spend quality time with people, and they 
seemed to be really happy that they were being included in this and to have a 
place to tell their stories." 
</P>
<P>
"This Is Our Yard" is scheduled to be shown at the Art Store in Fullerton, 
Cypress College, Pierce College and other sites in Orange, San Bernardino and 
Los Angeles counties. The artists are also seeking donations to produce an 
exhibit catalogue or book of their work. 
</P>

The Escape Society, a Laguna Beach producer of mystery-train outings, has 
joined forces with L.P. Repertory Theatre of Tustin to stage "The Mystery of 
the Missing Heiress," a show that commences in a San Juan Capistrano restaurant 
and travels by Amtrak to Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Susan King said the eight-hour production, which is based on an 
original script, involves several actors who lead the audience from clue to 
clue until the mystery is solved. 
</P>
<P>
The "Missing Heiress" is to premiere Saturday and will continue every Saturday 
for an indefinite period. Tickets are $109, an "introductory price" good 
through Nov. 17, King said. The price includes a champagne breakfast in San 
Juan Capistrano, hors d'oeuvres on the train, an early dinner in a Del Mar 
restaurant and a "twilight meal" on the return trip. 
</P>
<P>
Performances of the "Missing Heiress," to be directed by Bill Durkin, will 
begin at 10:30 a.m. in San Juan Capistrano during breakfast. Participants then 
board the 12:06 p.m. train to Del Mar and will be led through shops there as 
part of the production. After dinner, they return to San Juan Capistrano on the 
5:30 p.m. train. Package deals for an overnight stay in Del Mar are available, 
Durkin said. Information: (714) 835-9611. JAN HERMAN

Paid attendance at the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company of Great Britain engagement 
at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, which ended Sunday, 
averaged 55.4% of capacity, Center President Thomas R. Kendrick said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-performance run of Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Mikado" and "The 
Pirates of Penzance" grossed $432,945, or 63.8 % of the potential gross, 
Kendrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick had told The Times earlier that paid attendance would have to exceed 
65% for the Center to break even. The engagement "will require subsidy," 
Kendrick said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Prego Ristorante of Irvine raised about $1,500 for the Irvine Barclay Theatre 
at the restaurant's fifth annual grape harvest celebration, "Festa della 
Vendemmia," according to Prego manager Louie Salcito. More than 250 people 
attended the benefit on Sunday which was highlighted by the participation of 
guests in a traditional barefoot stomping of the one ton of grapes delivered to 
the event by horse-drawn carriage. 
</P>
<P>
The Visiting Nurses Assn. of Orange County Hospice sponsors its fifth annual 
"Jazz in the Afternoon" event, featuring composer and pianist Tom Talbert, to 
be held Sunday from 4 to 7 p.m. in the pianist's Laguna Beach home. 
</P>
<P>
The event hopes to raise $4,000 for the hospice, according to a spokeswoman for 
the nonprofit agency that provides care to terminally ill patients and their 
families. Talbert, who in addition to composing and arranging for a wide rage 
of jazz artists and groups including Claude Thornhill, Buddy Rich and Anita 
O'Day, has scored for TV and films and will be joined by a septet. Donation for 
"Jazz in the Afternoon," which includes a light buffet, is $40 per person.

Menendez ruling -- An Oct. 11 digest item in The Times regarding the murder 
case of brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez may have been unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge James Albracht said that, in ruling that audiotapes made 
by psychologist Jerome Oziel are not confidential, he determined that Oziel had 
divulged information about his sessions with the brothers to a third party to 
avert threatened danger. From the bench, Albracht did not name the third party. 
However, he said in an interview that Judalon Smyth was the only witness 
besides Oziel who testified at the hearings on the tapes. Smyth and Oziel have 
acknowledged that they had an affair.

<P>
Authorities are searching for a 68-year-old Granada Hills man who has been 
missing since Monday morning when he took off in his single-engine plane from 
Whiteman Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Bell, a retired carpenter, told his family Monday that he was going to 
Whiteman in Pacoima to look at a plane, said Detective Jim Lewis of the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Missing Persons unit. 
</P>
<P>
When Bell failed to return home, his wife called police, who discovered Bell's 
plane was missing from its hangar and his car parked nearby, Lewis said. Police 
believe that Bell took off in his plane on an impromptu pleasure ride over the 
Mojave Desert, as is often his custom, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday morning, eight planes combed the desert in search of Bell, said Lt. 
Kate Kelley, a spokeswoman for the Civil Air Patrol.

China's guardians of Marxist ideology announced a new campaign today against 
pornography and Western liberalism and said they would press on with an 
anti-crime drive in which hundreds have been executed. 
</P>
<P>
The announcements, made in the Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, 
contradicted widespread expectations that the party would relax its tight 
social controls after the Asian Games ended Oct. 7 in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong newspapers, many of which have close ties to Chinese officials, had 
predicted that more participants in last year's failed democracy movement would 
be released from jail if the games went off smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
But today's announcements further indicated the hard-liners who have dominated 
Chinese politics since June, 1989, have no intention of relaxing their hold. 
</P>
<P>
Their speeches said that China's current stability is fragile and called for 
vigilence against alleged anti-party forces. 
</P>
<P>
"At present, our country is politically, economically and socially stable," 
Qiao Shi, the party official in charge of police matters, said in giving the 
order to continue China's 6-month-old crackdown on crime. "But we must see 
clearly that the relatively smooth public order of these few months was 
achieved through the might of the (crackdown on crime)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The party also held an anti-pornography campaign for about six months beginning 
in June, 1989, when the army crushed a student-led movement for democratic 
reforms. Not only pornographic but pro-democracy publications were seized and 
burned.

Turn off the air-conditioning, don gas masks, seal homes, sit in a bathtub of 
water and don't panic. 
</P>
<P>
This was how Saudis were told to react to chemical warfare in booklets issued 
by civil defense authorities, Saudi newspapers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has bought millions of gas masks and given crash courses in 
protection against chemical warfare to hundreds of civil defense volunteers 
since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Civil defense officers said chemical bombs could be distinguished from 
conventional shells by low noise blasts, thick smoke, fewer fragments and the 
presence of oil-like stains and dead insects in the vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
It said the first precautions were to seal homes from the inside with wet 
cloths, put gas masks or wet handkerchiefs over the mouth and nose and wear 
raincoats or waterproof garments. 
</P>
<P>
The next moves were to throw away polluted clothes, wash eyes and limbs and 
stay in a bath without swallowing any water.

'DAMN THE DEFICIT' DAYS OVER: BUSH

<P>
President Bush, campaigning for Republican candidates in New England, today 
defended his support for unpopular higher taxes and spending cuts. He said the 
days of "damn the deficit must come to an end." 
</P>
<P>
"We're hanging tough for a good agreement," Bush said, speaking in one of the 
most economically hard-pressed regions of the country. He said he hopes that a 
budget package he can support will be crafted by congressional negotiators by 
Wednesday's midnight deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a sluggish economy out there nationally," Bush said, claiming that a 
$500-billion, five-year deficit-reduction plan could help the economy by 
driving down interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
He called on Republicans, many of whom oppose his stand, to put "self-interest" 
aside and stand with him in support of a budget plan. 
</P>
<P>
The "days of tax and spend and damn the deficit must come to an end," Bush said 
at the Vermont fund-raising breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
He was introduced by Rep. Peter Smith (R-Vt.), who is running for reelection 
and who is one of the few Republicans in the House to have voiced support for a 
Democratic-drafted deficit-cutting plan opposed by the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Smith said, "my differences with the Administration are a matter 
of record." He noted his support for the civil rights bill Bush vetoed Monday 
as well as their differences on the budget. 
</P>
<P>
However, he praised Bush's support for a package combining tax increases with 
spending cuts and said Vermont voters are willing to pay higher taxes to get 
the nation out of deficit spending. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish he'd stop reminding me that we have a few differences out there," Bush 
said, praising Smith for having an "independent mind." 
</P>
<P>
Bush traveled through New England on a small two-engine jet. The runways at 
some of his stops were too small to accommodate the jumbo jet that he usually 
uses as Air Force One. 
</P>
<P>
Outside Bush's first stop, several dozen protesters stood in the rain carrying 
banners and shouted at Bush's motorcade urging him not to go to war over oil in 
the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The President's first stop was a fund-raising breakfast for the state GOP in 
Burlington. Former Gov. Richard Snelling is favored to regain the office he 
gave up six years ago, which would return Vermont to Republican control. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also planned to speak at a fund-raising lunch for GOP Senate candidate 
Rep. Robert C. Smith in Manchester, N.H.

Former East German schoolteachers who escaped to the West must repeat teachers' 
exams, while those who stayed and served under communism will be allowed to 
continue working in the new, unified Germany, a Berlin newspaper said today.

<P>
About 300 teachers from what was East Germany will have to take exams to teach 
in the western part of the unified country, the Berliner Morgenpost newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who turned their backs on the Communist regime at great personal cost 
are now being punished for their courage and logic," said Manfred Meyer, 45, a 
physical education teacher who emigrated from East to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials said the policy was designed to keep teachers from moving 
west, a problem that would strongly affect Berlin.

4 ISRAELIS HURT, ARAB KILLED AS ATTACKS CONTINUE

A Palestinian truck driver stabbed two unarmed women soldiers in northern 
Israel today in a third straight day of Arab knifing attacks. 
</P>
<P>
In the southern town of Ashkelon, a Palestinian bludgeoned two Israelis with a 
hammer to avenge the death of a friend in the Gaza Strip, army radio said. The 
two victims were hospitalized with serious head wounds, it said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the attacks, Defense Minister Moshe Arens today barred 
Palestinians in the occupied territories from traveling to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Under Arens' order, the 1.7 million Palestinian residents of the occupied West 
Bank and Gaza Strip will be banned from entering Israel as of Wednesday 
morning, the military command said. Those staying in Israel, where many work, 
were ordered to return home. 
</P>
<P>
Israel television said the travel ban will remain in effect for "several days" 
until tensions are reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Arens' order was issued hours after Israeli civilians fired on an Arab car in 
the southern Negev desert, killing one Palestinian laborer and wounding his 
three cousins. 
</P>
<P>
In the knife attack on the Israeli soldiers, police spokesman Yehoshua Butbul 
said that the wounded women were rushed to Rambam Hospital in the nearby port 
of Haifa and that the assailant was caught by other soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
One of the women was in serious condition with a knife wound in the chest that 
punctured a lung, said Dr. Albert Suttinger, deputy director of Rambam. The 
other suffered a superficial back wound, Suttinger said. 
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred this morning as the soldiers waited for a ride near the 
town of Kiryat Tivon, Butbul said. 
</P>
<P>
The attacker "took out a knife and started to stab the soldiers," the radio 
said, adding that the women were not armed. 
</P>
<P>
Radio reports said civilians assisted in the capture. 
</P>
<P>
"We chased him and then he threw down the knife and we grabbed him," one 
Israeli civilian, Eli Koman, told Israel radio. "We held him down and shouted 
at the soldiers to shoot and kill him. They wouldn't. I asked one of them to 
give me his rifle; he refused." 
</P>
<P>
Israel radio said the suspect, who was taken to a hospital for treatment, told 
police he had driven into Israel with the intent of attacking Jews. He was 
identified only as a 39-year-old Palestinian from the Jenin area, about 20 
miles southeast of the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
In Ashkelon, the two victims of the hammer attack were identified as Israelis 
in their late 40s, army radio said. The Palestinian was apprehended after a 
brief chase, the radio said.

WORK TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE, JAPAN URGED

Japan, the world's biggest exporter of high-technology goods, should channel 
more of its technological prowess into improving the quality of life, a 
government agency said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Science and Technology Agency, in an annual policy statement, said science 
and technology should make a greater contribution to improving health and 
living standards and cleaning up the environment in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The paper, endorsed by the Cabinet today, sets out general principles that may 
influence government funding but does not make any specific recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
"Until now, the goal of science and technology had been economic growth. This 
was seen to result in commercial products which improved society. But now the 
immediate goal is to improve the quality of life," Yoshiki Kurihara, director 
of the research division of the agency's Policy Bureau, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
He said the report echoed other government agencies that have recently issued 
statements reflecting the frustrations of ordinary Japanese who, despite high 
incomes, complain about cramped living quarters, wearying commutes and polluted 
environments. 
</P>
<P>
An agency poll of 1,000 people in June this year, for example, found that 
nearly 90% thought science and technology ought to contribute more to improving 
living standards. 
</P>
<P>
The agency and some ministries have been urging greater government spending. 
Last year's agency report and a Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
report in May outlining goals for the 1990s called on the government to double 
its share of research and development spending as a percentage of gross 
national product. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's total research and development outlays, including expenditure by the 
private sector, surpassed $79 billion in the year to March, 1989, second only 
to the United States. But MITI figures show the Japanese government spends only 
about 0.5% of GNP on research and development, against 1.2% in the United 
States and France.

The Canadian dollar opened slightly higher on international markets today, 
hours after Finance Minister Michael Wilson said the country is in an economic 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson told a parliamentary finance committee late Monday night he has seen 
some third-quarter statistics that indicate a further decline in output. 
</P>
<P>
"However, we do not expect this to be a severe recession," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Wilson's admission, the first time he has used the word recession to 
describe economic activity, the Canadian dollar opened at 85.23 cents today, up 
slightly from Monday's close of 85.07 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic product declined in the second quarter of 1990. A decline in the 
third quarter would meet the technical definition of a recession. "That appears 
to be what we are in right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Canada had 7 1/2 years of very strong growth after the last recession 
in 1981-82. 
</P>
<P>
The economic slowdown has been compounded by major work stoppages, the crisis 
in the Middle East and the weakening U.S. economy, Wilson said, adding he hoped 
to reveal plans for dealing with the recession at a meeting in December of 
provincial and federal finance ministers.

The head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade said today that Germany 
is likely this year to again replace the United States as the world's biggest 
exporting nation. 
</P>
<P>
Top GATT official Arthur Dunkel said global economic strength depends on a free 
trading system, and Germany therefore has special responsibilities in the 
troubled Uruguay Round of trade liberalization talks. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations are scheduled to end Dec. 7 but are deadlocked over 
agriculture, with Germany in particular resisting a European Community offer to 
reduce huge farm export subsidies as the United States and other nations have 
demanded. 
</P>
<P>
Reforming agricultural trade is a "critical" part of the Uruguay Round but 
"five weeks away from the end we are nowhere near this goal," Dunkel said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Germany replaced the United States in 1986 as the world's biggest 
exporting nation and held the position in 1987 and 1988, with the United States 
moving back into the top spot in 1989.

RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. said today its third-quarter loss narrowed to $86 
million on revenues of $3.52 billion, compared with a loss of $447 million on 
revenues of $2.99 billion in the like 1989 period. 
</P>
<P>
The food and tobacco giant said the 1990 third-quarter loss reflects $507 
million in pre-tax charges for non-cash interest related to RJR Nabisco's 
leveraged buyout in 1989, as well as $303 million in pre-tax charges for 
amortization and depreciation. 
</P>
<P>
The third-quarter loss also includes a $108 million extraordinary gain 
primarily from open market purchases of the exchange debentures of RJR Nabisco 
Holdings Group Inc., as part of a recapitalization program announced in July. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of the year, the company reported a loss of $416 
million on sales of $10.19 billion, compared with a loss of $832 million on 
sales of $9.23 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
International tobacco operations continued to record strong net sales and 
business unit contribution, with significant volume gains in Europe and Asia, 
the company said.

Race officials ruled that a 16.5-hour penalty issued to Gautier for being late

Auguin sailed his 60-foot sloop Groupe Sceta across the finish line between 
Cape Town and the offshore prison of Robben Island a few seconds after noon. 
</P>
<P>
Gautier, 28, had arrived in the dark at 5:12 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Gautier criticized the hour-for-hour penalty. "I was first in Cape Town. I 
think I deserve this leg. I respect all the rules while I am racing, but this 
penalty was imposed before we even started, and I think that is incredible." 
</P>
<P>
Auguin offered to help Gautier fight the ruling that cost him the first leg in 
the eight-month race over 27,000 miles.

A tough schedule for next year's Tour de France was announced today, and Greg 
LeMond said the prospect of only one rest day improved his chances for winning 
the cycling race for a fourth time. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1991 Tour is ideal for me since there's no day off before the first time 
trial," LeMond said at the announcement of the route and schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The 1991 race will have one transfer day instead of the usual two. It will also 
have a time trial on the next-to-last day, a scenario that this year helped 
LeMond win the world's top cycling race for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
Next year's tour is 2,462 miles long, over a counterclockwise route around 
France starting in Lyon on July 6. It ends July 28 in Paris with the 
traditional rides up and down the Champs Elysees.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: NITROUS OXIDE CANISTERS GIVE A 'HIGH' FEELING BUT CAN KILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Question: I work in a store that sells a device for whipping cream. We also 
sell the chargers, which contain nitrous oxide (laughing gas). 
</P>
<P>
Our problem is customers who buy the chargers for recreational purposes. It's 
not unusual for a group of teen-agers to request 10 boxes on a Friday or a 
Saturday night. (A box contains 10 chargers.) 
</P>
<P>
We are upset about this because we are aware that abuse can be dangerous and 
that people have died of overdoses. Please tell us how this gas affects the 
brain and why people die from inhaling it. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Nitrous oxide has been used as an anesthetic for more than 100 years 
and is still used during surgery under carefully controlled conditions because 
it is an analgesic. Unfortunately, "laughing gas" has also been abused because 
it produces a "high" feeling. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with inhaling nitrous oxide is that it can cause unconsciousness 
due to lack of oxygen. A person who overdoses may stop breathing. 
</P>
<P>
You have a legitimate concern about the abuse of the nitrous oxide canisters 
used for whipping cream. Perhaps the store could consider limiting the number 
of chargers it sells to minors. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What can I do for itching of the anus? I have had it for some time, and it 
is driving me crazy. This biting and itching feeling is embarrassing, and most 
of the time the drugstore hemorrhoid remedies don't stop it. 
</P>
<P>
A: Dermatologists tell us that pruritus ani, also known as itchy bottom, can be 
caused by many factors. Coffee, citrus fruit and beans may aggravate this 
condition, as can tight clothing. Perfumed toilet paper and clothes washed in 
fabric softener also may contribute. People who are overweight are more likely 
to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
The usual remedies are greasy ointments or cortisone creams. These are likely 
to make the problem worse because they increase moisture in the area. Although 
it is difficult, try to avoid scratching, as it can set up a vicious cycle that 
leads to more intense itching. 
</P>
<P>
A dermatologist may be able to determine the underlying cause. In the meantime, 
keep the area dry by patting it clean with cotton balls soaked in witch hazel 
or special wipes such as Tucks, Mediconet or Preparation H Cleansing Pads.

Dudley Moore had to contend with a piano that went clunk and another that 
wandered across the stage during a benefit. 
</P>
<P>
The concert Sunday at Cal State Long Beach was to help pay for $30,000 in 
repairs on a Steinway grand piano and the replacement of another valued at 
$50,000 that was destroyed when a concert hall roof collapsed July 2. 
</P>
<P>
"Hmmm. A broken string. This is actually a true Steinway," the comic actor said 
of the piano borrowed for the benefit. "I want you all to think about this when 
you buy that new Steinway." 
</P>
<P>
The star of such films as "10" and "Arthur" got another piano from the wings, 
but it began to glide across the stage as he played. He gazed at the crowd and 
said, "I love playing on moments of sheer panic and desperation."

Jerry Van Dyke, in his role as dimwitted Luther Van Dam from "Coach," 
apologized on the air for having knocked Cleveland two weeks ago in a 
promotional spot for the ABC comedy, and the mayor accepted. 
</P>
<P>
The apology came in a promo as well. 
</P>
<P>
It was aired during the "Monday Night Football" game between the Cleveland 
Browns and the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to say that I'm sorry, Cleveland, and I love Cleveland and I love 
the people in it," Van Dyke said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Michael R. White replied: "The Cleveland of today and the Cleveland of 15 
years ago are vastly different places. I think the apology frankly recognizes 
that there has been a major improvement." 
</P>
<P>
The joke that got Cleveland so mad was broadcast Oct. 8 during a Monday night 
game between Cleveland and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Van Dyke, a football coach in "Coach," said in the promo, "I think the problem 
with Cleveland is, even if you win, you lose. You still got to go home to 
Cleveland." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the football season, a "Coach" promo made the same joke about 
Buffalo, incensing residents of that city.

WORLD SERIES SWEEPS CBS TO TOP OF RATINGS; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE BASEBALL BOOST PUTS IT ONLY TWO-TENTHS OF A POINT BEHIND NBC IN 
THE SEASON STANDINGS.

<P>
The World Series won the ratings race for CBS last week and put the network 
within two-tenths of a rating point of NBC for the season to date, it was 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
All four games of the Series finished in the top 10, with games two and four 
taking the top two spots, and games one and three coming in fifth and sixth. 
</P>
<P>
CBS estimated that more than 59 million Americans viewed all or part of Game 4 
in Nielsen-measured homes, with as many as 6 million persons watching in bars, 
restaurants, school dormitories and other venues. 
</P>
<P>
The World Series averaged a 20.8 rating and a 36 share, up 27% over last year's 
earthquake-interrupted four-game fiasco, but down 10% from the first four games 
of the 1988 series. 
</P>
<P>
In the ratings for the week ending Sunday, according to the A. C. Nielsen Co., 
CBS won with a 15.9 rating and a 26 share. NBC was second with a 13.9 rating 
and a 23 share, while ABC posted a 12.6 rating and a 21 share. 
</P>
<P>
The five-week season-to-date statistics show how close this year's race has 
become, with CBS's World Series ratings enough to pull the network close to a 
tie for the top. 
</P>
<P>
NBC leads with a 13.4 rating and 22 share, followed by CBS with a 13.2 rating 
and a 22 share, and ABC not far behind with a 12.7 rating and a 21 share. 
</P>
<P>
Night-by-night competition saw CBS win Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday 
-- the four nights of prime-time baseball. NBC took Monday and Thursday and ABC 
won Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's counter-programming of Danielle Steel against baseball paid off, with 
"Kaleidoscope" taking fourth place and giving the network non-Series Monday 
night. "Fine Things" came in 10th against Game 1, the best an entertainment 
program has done against the first game of a Series since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
In non-Series competition, "The Cosby Show" on NBC was in eighth place, while 
"The Simpsons" on Fox placed 18th, down from eighth the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
Soap opera actress Susan Lucci proved a big winner for ABC in the Sunday movie 
competition. She starred in "The Bride in Black," which ranked 15th. NBC's "The 
Love She Sought," starring Angela Lansbury, came in 46th, while CBS -- which 
had been hoping for a fifth game in the Series -- had to settle for the 
theatrical "The Big Easy" in 60th. 
</P>
<P>
None of the season's new shows are setting the ratings race on fire. Tops was 
"America's Funniest People" (ABC) in ninth place, outperforming its clone, 
"America's Funniest Home Videos," in 13th. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's "World News Tonight" was No. 1 for the 41st consecutive week, with a 9.9 
rating and a 20 share. "CBS Evening News" with Dan Rather and "NBC Nightly 
News" with Tom Brokaw tied for second, each with an 8.7 rating. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

 The top 10 programs for the week ending Sunday, according to the A.C. Nielsen

MURDOCH SEES HIGHER NEWS CORP. EARNINGS

<P>
Rupert Murdoch, chief executive of News Corp. Ltd., said today that he expects 
his debt-laden international media company to increase earnings this fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch told the annual meeting of shareholders that despite uncertainties in 
some of the company's major markets, he expects News Corp. to "trade on ahead 
of last year." 
</P>
<P>
He did not estimate earnings and would not comment on the company's short-term 
debt problems that helped depress News Corp.'s stock price in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
News Corp.'s short-term debt soared last fiscal year to $2.30 billion from $396 
million. Total debt rose to $8.21 billion from $6.13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
News Corp. stock closed today up about 50 cents to $4.75 in Australian stock 
market trading. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Monday, Murdoch said his empire will increasingly concentrate 
on film and electronic media, rather than the newspapers and magazines with 
which he built News Corp. Newspapers and magazines now account for about 70% of 
News Corp. profits. 
</P>
<P>
His international holdings include interests in the Fox Television network in 
the United States and a 51% holding in the South China Morning Post in Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year ended June 30, News Corp. reported that earnings dropped 
75.5% to $267 million, largely because of losses at Murdoch's Sky-TV satellite 
broadcasting business in Britain and a pilots' strike at the half-owned Ansett 
Australia airline. 
</P>
<P>
Shareholders today approved a resolution allowing directors to issue 
limited-voting shares. Murdoch wants to be able to issue such shares so the 
company can raise funds without diluting his 45% stake.
