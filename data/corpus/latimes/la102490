PETTI GUILTY OF ASSISTING SILBERMAN; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: A JUDGE SAYS THE REPUTED MOBSTER WAS A CENTRAL FIGURE IN THE 
MONEY-LAUNDERING CASE, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS ESSENTIALLY A 'PAWN.'

Reputed mobster Chris Petti was convicted Tuesday in federal court of six 
felony counts for his role as a "pawn" in a money-laundering scheme directed by 
San Diego financier Richard T. Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving, who heard the case without a jury, 
found Petti guilty without hesitation as soon as closing arguments in the case 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Petti was "for the most part a pawn" of Silberman, who directed a 
scheme to launder $300,000 portrayed by an undercover FBI agent as Colombian 
cocaine profits. 
</P>
<P>
Petti introduced Silberman to the agent and did not know all the details of the 
scheme, but nevertheless was a central figure in the conspiracy, Irving said. 
"In for a penny, in for a pound," Irving told Petti in announcing judgment. 
"That's the position I believe you find yourself in today." 
</P>
<P>
Petti, 63, showed no emotion as Irving announced he was guilty on each of the 
six counts. He declined to comment on the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Oscar Goodman said Petti would appeal the verdict. "I guess I 
deluded myself, listening to too many people who told me we were winning," 
Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
Petti, Silberman and three other men charged in the scheme have each been 
convicted of felony charges. Petti, however, who could draw up to 75 years in 
prison, stands to receive the harshest sentence and almost certainly more than 
Silberman's term. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, once a top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., was 
sentenced last month to 46 months in federal prison and fined $50,000 for his 
role in the plot. 
</P>
<P>
He was convicted June 28, after a two-month trial, of a technical currency 
violation. On Aug. 24, he pleaded guilty under a plea bargain to a felony 
conspiracy count, averting a second trial. 
</P>
<P>
The three others each pleaded guilty in the past few months to a sole felony 
count apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Though Petti could face up to 75 years in prison, he is more likely to be 
sentenced under new federal guidelines to eight years or less, said Assistant 
U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr., the lead prosecutor in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Irving set sentencing for Dec. 17. Petti, reputed to be connected to organized 
crime in Chicago and Las Vegas, remains free on $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Irving said he was especially careful in the case not to try Petti on his 
reputation alone. "I have been more careful to try this case on the basis of 
the evidence presented in court than any other case I have tried" in eight 
years on the bench, Irving said. 
</P>
<P>
But the evidence, Irving said, made it plain that Petti was guilty of a sole 
count of conspiring to launder money, two counts of money laundering and three 
counts detailing violations of federal currency regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, expecting a finder's fee, Petti introduced Silberman to undercover 
agent Peter J. Ahearn, who was posing as Pete Carmassi, a front man for 
Colombian drug lords, Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman and Ahearn went on to conduct two laundering deals. The first, in 
November, 1988, was a swap of $100,000 for stock in a Silberman gold-mining 
subsidiary. The second, in February, 1989, was an exchange of $200,000 for U.S. 
Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
As the scheme developed, acording to Gorder, Petti made sure Ahearn knew how to 
contact Silberman, even when the financier was overseas, oversaw the first deal 
and served as an "enforcer" when the bonds in the second deal proved to be 
worth far less than Silberman had expected. 
</P>
<P>
There was not enough evidence, however, to prove that Petti pocketed $4,000, as 
prosecutors had alleged, on the second deal, Irving said. He declined to order 
Petti to forfeit that amount in cash to the government, clearing Petti of the 
seventh and final charge in the case.

UCSD TO END PRENATAL CARE PLAN FOR POOR; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: HEAD OF PROGRAM SAYS SHUTDOWN IS CAUSED BY LACK OF FUNDS, BUT 
CRITICS SUGGEST THAT MONEY IS NOT THE ISSUE. 
</P>

<P>
Blaming Medi-Cal reimbursements that in fact have increased by more than a 
third in the last two years, UC San Diego is shutting down the only major 
program in the county under which poor women get access to comprehensive 
prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
The action, announced in an Oct. 16 memo, raised eyebrows from San Diego to 
Sacramento. UCSD's complaint that Medi-Cal obstetrical rates are too low 
doesn't make sense, critics said. 
</P>
<P>
"No one else seems to have a problem with those rates," said Dr. Rugmini Shah, 
chief of the maternal and child health branch of the California Department of 
Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Resnik, head of the Department of Reproductive Medicine at UCSD 
Medical School, said the Comprehensive Perinatal Program will begin phasing out 
in November because the state had withdrawn special block-grant funding. This 
money has funded the program for several years. 
</P>
<P>
In the program, up to 130 women a month have received regular prenatal care 
from UCSD nurse-midwives who saw the women at community clinics, then delivered 
their babies at UCSD Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Under Medi-Cal obstetrical plans implemented over the last two years, instead 
of block-grant funding, the program would have been reimbursed at a rate of 
$2,155 per birth for a package of prenatal and postpartum care, support 
services such as nutrition education, and the delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Resnik said this just wasn't enough to keep the perinatal program in business. 
</P>
<P>
"Our present projections are that the best of these schemes would require 
$250,000-$300,000 in donated physician care and approximately $100,000 
additional program support yearly," Resnik wrote in a memo distributed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The program's enrollment will be cut to 20 a month over the next three months, 
and the last delivery will come in April, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
The death of the perinatal program comes after a year in which UCSD had 
steadily squeezed down the patient load. The gradual cutbacks had prompted 
suspicion among others involved in prenatal-access issues that UCSD was backing 
away from caring for the poor. Resnik denied plans to kill the program as 
recently as late July. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, doubts remained. Janice Bluemer, who recently left as the county's 
prenatal care coordinator, echoed Dr. Shah's skepticism about the claim that 
the new Medi-Cal reimbursement rates are the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Bluemer noted that UCSD's perinatal program started as part of a state pilot 
project, whose success provided justification for the new higher Medi-Cal 
payments for "comprehensive" prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
"They were actually one of the pilots that proved that this is a cost-effective 
method," Bluemer said. "What are we saying, that it was effective then, before 
all this legislation went into effect, but now it's not?" 
</P>
<P>
Shah noted that the higher Medi-Cal reimbursement system had increased doctors' 
participation in the Medi-Cal system statewide. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, there were 3,889 births in San Diego County to women who had no 
prenatal care. These women show up in emergency rooms for delivery, and deliver 
babies who are more likely to have birth defects or be premature. 
</P>
<P>
At UCSD, such "no-care" births amount to about 175 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Resnik's announcement of the perinatal program's shutdown, UCSD 
Medical Center officials stressed that the prenatal care program was operated 
by the medical school, not the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital itself will continue to care for a limited number of poor pregnant 
women through its outpatient clinic and will also do deliveries of women who 
arrive in the emergency room, said Mary Margaret Olin, associate director of 
hospitals and clinics.

'I HATE DADDY,' BRODERICK TELLS SON IN TAPE PLAYED AT MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over and over, one of Elisabeth Anne (Betty) Broderick's young sons pleaded 
with her to stop being so mad at her ex-husband and his new wife, told her all 
she cared about was money and urged her to never again use "bad words." 
</P>
<P>
But, in a wrenching tape played Tuesday at Broderick's double-murder trial, she 
told her son that, even though she had been angry for years at Daniel T. 
Broderick III and his new wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick, she was not about to 
change "because I hate Daddy." 
</P>
<P>
That hate resulted in frequent angry or vulgar messages on Daniel Broderick's 
answering machine and repeated threats to kill him and his new wife before 
Betty Broderick shot them both last November and said she did it to bring the 
family together, one of her daughters testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying against her mother, Kim Broderick cried often. Betty Broderick -- 
who frequently called Kim a "traitor" after asking for her daughter's loyalty 
before and after the killings -- cried, too. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick, 42, a former La Jolla socialite, faces two counts of murder in the 
shooting deaths before dawn last Nov. 5 of her ex-husband and his new wife. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Broderick was a prominent medical malpractice lawyer and a former county 
bar president. 
</P>
<P>
His divorce from Betty Broderick, which started when the couple separated in 
1985 and took four years, was bitter. During and after the divorce proceedings, 
Betty Broderick accused her husband of using his legal influence to cheat her 
out of her fair share of his million-dollar-a-year income. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick, who has pleaded innocent, has been held without bail in the 
Las Colinas Jail in Santee since last November. If convicted, she could be 
sentenced to life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick's defense attorney, Jack Earley, admitted Monday when the trial began 
that Betty Broderick shot and killed her ex-husband and his new wife. He 
contends, however, that she is not guilty of murder because she had no intent 
to kill anyone but herself. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Broderick, 20, testified Tuesday that her mother called shortly after the 
shootings and said that Daniel Broderick said upon being hit, "OK, you shot me. 
I'm dead." 
</P>
<P>
That comment was exactly the same as one made by Betty Broderick's other 
daughter, Lee, 19, last March at her mother's preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Broderick also said, as she did when she testified last March, that she 
lost her keys, including a key to her father's house, a couple of weeks before 
the killings. Prosecutors contend Betty Broderick used that key to sneak into 
Daniel Broderick's Marston Hills home Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad's key was a big deal," Kim Broderick said. "We were supposed to guard 
it with our lives." 
</P>
<P>
But Kim Broderick added new details Tuesday, verifying the details of the 
34-minute tape -- made by her father on his answering machine -- of a phone 
call in March, 1987, between Danny and his mother. The tape was part of the 
Brodericks' divorce case file, which has been sealed. 
</P>
<P>
In the call, Danny, who was then 11 and is not expected to testify in the 
murder case, said that the animosity between his mother and father would never 
cease until his mother stopped using "bad words." 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of times, he asked her to refrain from using angry and vulgar language, 
including the two names by which she consistently referred to her ex-husband 
and new wife. On the tape, Betty Broderick swears repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
At another point, Danny said, "All you care about is your stupid money." 
</P>
<P>
He said, "You want everything. You want all the kids, all the money, to get rid 
of Linda -- and it's not going to work, Mom." 
</P>
<P>
And he said, "You've been mad long enough." 
</P>
<P>
She replied, "No, I haven't." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells played, in a row, 30 calls Betty Broderick made 
-- from May, 1986, to December, 1988 -- to her ex-husband's answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
In one, Betty Broderick said, "I just want what's mine. That's all I've ever 
wanted. I don't give two (expletive) about you. You're not worth spit." 
</P>
<P>
She called her husband the name she usually used, then said, "You've turned my 
life into a nightmare. I can't go to sleep. I close my eyes, and I see you and 
the (expletive)" -- using the word she consistently used to refer to Linda 
Kolkena Broderick -- "and I see you doing all your wonderful things and, um, 
you're gonna be real sorry." 
</P>
<P>
Kim Broderick testified Tuesday that, in early 1989, shortly before Daniel 
Broderick married Linda Kolkena, Betty Broderick told her, " 'I'm going to kill 
them. I'm going to shoot them.' She said she would shoot them in the head four 
times, three times." 
</P>
<P>
Kim Broderick also said her mother knew that Daniel Broderick bought a 
$2-million insurance policy about a month before the killings. If he died, $1 
million was to go to his new wife and $250,000 was to go to each of the four 
Broderick children -- Kim, Lee, Danny, now 14, and Rhett, 11. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick never talked directly about killing him for the policy, her 
daughter said. "She never said, 'Then we'd get the insurance policy,' " Kim 
Broderick said. "But she said, 'We'd have money, we'd be rich.' She said that a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
In other testimony Tuesday, a coroner testified about the gunshot wounds Daniel 
and Linda Broderick suffered, and jurors were shown color photos of the 
corpses. Linda Broderick died instantly from a shot to the head while Daniel 
Broderick took longer to die, probably a couple of minutes, from a shot that 
punctured his lung, Dr. Christopher Swalwell said.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: BUS LINE TO BE RUN ON NATURAL GAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAJA RADEVICH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bus aimed at reducing pollution will provide round-trip commuter 
transportation from Ventura to Santa Barbara and Goleta beginning Nov. 12. 
</P>
<P>
The Clean Air Express program uses three buses that will be converted to run on 
natural gas in early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The two other buses will travel from Santa Maria and Lompoc to Santa Barbara. 
The commuter service is designed to demonstrate that natural gas can be used as 
an alternative to diesel and gasoline, said Peter Cantle of the Santa Barbara 
County Air Pollution Control District, which organized the program. 
</P>
<P>
"Natural gas is a cleaner-burning fuel and better for the environment. It's 
cheaper and it's abundant in this country, which means we would be less reliant 
on foreign oil," Cantle said. "Up until now, oil companies pushed gasoline and 
diesel, and natural gas wasn't very popular here. Now things are changing 
because people are becoming more environmentally conscious." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers estimate that the conversion of the three buses will save about 18 
tons a year of smog-forming pollutants. In addition, with each bus holding up 
to 43 people, more than 120 cars per day might be removed from existing 
traffic, further reducing pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The service will be operated by Santa Barbara Transportation and will cost $70 
a month. Commuters will be picked up at the Ventura County Government Center at 
6:45 a.m. and leave Santa Barbara about 5:15 p.m. MAJA RADEVICH

PLANNERS OK LIMITS ON NEW HOUSING

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura Planning Commission approved a plan Tuesday to limit new housing in 
the city to 185 units a year. 
</P>
<P>
Until February, the city had been allocating about 450 units a year, said 
Everett Millais, community development director. 
</P>
<P>
At that pace, however, the city's population would have exceeded 102,000 well 
before the year 2000, as established in the General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
The allocation program requires City Council approval before it takes effect.

COUNCIL CLEARED ON 2 MEETING LAW CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The district attorney's office has cleared members of the Oxnard City Council 
of allegations that they violated state law by holding secret meetings twice in 
the last five months. 
</P>
<P>
However, special Assistant Dist. Atty. Donald D. Coleman said he is still 
investigating allegations that the entire council violated state open meeting 
laws on a third occasion in August. 
</P>
<P>
After interviewing city officials about the allegations, Coleman said he was 
unable to find enough evidence to prove there were violations of the Brown Act, 
the state's open meeting law. 
</P>
<P>
The first allegation that Coleman cleared was filed in May by council candidate 
Eleanor Branthoover, president of the city's Inter-Neighborhood Council. She 
asked the district attorney to investigate a possible violation by three 
council members during a meeting to discuss a 77-acre development near Oxnard 
Boulevard and Gonzales Road. 
</P>
<P>
Branthoover told the district attorney that she suspected the council members 
discussed the matter in a private conference room during a recess because the 
council was unable to reach consensus until after it returned from the recess. 
</P>
<P>
The second alleged violation that Coleman cleared was filed last month by Scott 
Bollinger, a mayoral candidate in the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Bollinger asked the district attorney to investigate campaign literature 
distributed by Mayor Nao Takasugi, which suggested that three council members 
had been holding illegal secret meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman said he interviewed Takasugi and his campaign consultant, John Davies, 
and found that neither could provide substantial evidence to prove the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman said he is still investigating whether the City Council violated the 
Brown Act when it met in closed session to modify a development agreement it 
adopted in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Gary Gillig has said he approved the meeting and that it did not 
violate the Brown Act. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested that he and the district attorney interpret the law differently.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA COUNTY SUPPORTS ALLIANCE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County officials agreed Tuesday to support an effort by near-bankrupt 
Butte County to form an alliance of financially distressed counties in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Butte County circulated a letter earlier this month to the state's 58 counties 
proposing that they join forces to share information and devise a political 
strategy to get more money from the Legislature for county governments. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not bankrupt, but we need to lend our support to those counties that 
are," Supervisor Maggie Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
Although not bankrupt, Ventura County has had serious budget problems. State 
funding cuts of about $10 million last summer made it tough to budget money for 
local programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're on the same eventual path as Butte County, but there are counties that 
are much closer," said Richard Wittenberg, the county's chief administrative 
officer. "Eventually every county will be there unless things change." 
</P>
<P>
The letter, sent by Butte County Supervisor Ed McLaughlin, said participants 
will be asked to attend a meeting to "plan a political strategy as how best to 
achieve a restructuring of the ineffective relationship that now exists between 
California and its counties." JANE HULSE

HEARING PLANNED ON CONTRACT PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A public hearing on a contract proposal by a union representing 600 Conejo 
Valley Unified School District employees is scheduled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The California School Employees Assn., representing classified workers, has 
proposed a 30% raise over the next three years, plus 15% of the district's 
lottery money each year. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since 1985, the union's proposal would give the workers a 
flat percentage raise, instead of basing their raises on the state funding 
received by the district. 
</P>
<P>
Area residents will be able to comment on the proposal at the hearing, 
scheduled for 7:30 p.m. at Westlake High School. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said they will present their offer at the school board's 
Nov. 8 meeting. A second public hearing, to discuss the district's position, is 
planned for Nov. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the contract, which expires Dec. 31, are expected to begin in 
early December, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
For three years, classified employees -- including secretaries, custodians, 
maintenance and food service workers -- received raises ranging from 2.88% to 
4.59%, plus 8% of the district's lottery funds. STEPHANIE STASSEL

<TEXT>
<P>
Agents seized more than 200 pounds of marijuana and arrested two men near the 
border checkpoint, the Border Patrol reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dagoberto Meza-Hernandez, 24, of Tijuana, and Bernardo Vasquez-Guvioto, 28, of 
Sinaloa, Mexico, were booked into the Metropolitan Correctional Center on drug 
possession charges, said a Border Patrol spokesman, adding that both men were 
in the United States illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Agents arrested the two at about 5:30 p.m. Monday as they allegedly were 
loading 218 pounds of marijuana into a 1984 Ford Bronco on Monument Road, about 
half a mile north of the U.S.-Mexican border, the spokesman said. The marijuana 
was packaged in three duffel bags and two backpacks and agents believe the 
drugs were carried across the border on foot and were going to be driven north 
in the Bronco, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Three other men fled on foot back into Mexico.

UCLA STAR TO SPEAK AT ANTI-DRUG RALLY

UCLA basketball star Don McLean will be one of several guest speakers at an 
anti-drug rally scheduled tonight at Simi Valley High School's Bob Jacob 
Memorial Stadium, school district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The community rally, which will begin at 6:30 p.m, is part of Red Ribbon Week, 
a national program designed to encourage students to stay off drugs and 
alcohol, said Ellen Lee, district consultant for curriculum and instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said the purpose of the rally is to get the community more involved in the 
anti-drug crusade. 
</P>
<P>
"To establish a drug-free community is not something that the schools alone can 
do," Lee said. "We invite the community to join us in that effort." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to McLean, the 90-minute program will feature speeches by Mayor 
Greg Stratton, interim Supt. Cathi Vogel and Simi Valley Police Chief Lindsey 
(Paul) Miller. Students will provide the program's entertainment, which will 
include dancing, singing and comedy acts, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
McLean, a former Simi Valley High School basketball star who helped lead his 
team to a Southern Section title in 1988, was asked to speak to the students 
because of the exemplary life he has led. 
</P>
<P>
McLean "has had a strong, healthy lifestyle," Lee said. "We want to point that 
out. We want young students to look to him as a role model." CARLOS V. LOZANO

WOMAN PLEADS NO CONTEST TO CHARGE OF ATTACKING TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A North Hollywood woman pleaded no contest Tuesday to a felony charge of 
assaulting her daughter's 64-year-old kindergarten teacher in the classroom 
after the child complained that the instructor scolded her. 
</P>
<P>
Benita McCrae, 30, faces up to one year in jail and three years probation under 
the terms of a plea agreement between prosecutors and her lawyer, Deputy Public 
Defender James M. Coady. Sentencing was scheduled for Nov. 6 in San Fernando 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for her no-contest plea to one count of battery against a school 
employee, prosecutors dropped a charge of threatening a school employee. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Stephen A. Marcus denied Coady's request to release McCrae from custody 
on her own recognizance, but he lowered bail from $10,000 to $6,000. McCrae, 
who is being held at Sybil Brand Institute for Women, had not posted bail 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom where McCrae entered her plea, teacher Marjan Swantek 
described the alleged assault. She said McCrae burst into her classroom at 
Toluca Lake Elementary School on Oct. 3, began to choke her and slammed her 
against a wall. 
</P>
<P>
Swantek said her kindergarten students told her that she was lifted several 
inches off the ground by McCrae, who police described as 6 feet tall and 
weighing 240 pounds. Swantek said she is 5 feet, 6 inches tall and weighs 142 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Swantek said the attack left her with bruises and scratches on her neck and a 
bruised elbow. 
</P>
<P>
Coady did not dispute charges that his client assaulted the teacher. However, 
he said McCrae denies choking Swantek and scratching her neck. 
</P>
<P>
Coady said McCrae was oversensitive about how others treated her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
McCrae's 5-year-old daughter was placed in the custody of the Department of 
Children's Services after her mother was arrested. The mother has retained an 
attorney to attempt to regain custody of the girl, Coady said. 
</P>
<P>
Swantek said McCrae had spent time observing her teach the day before the 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
McCrae returned briefly the next day and confronted the teacher, saying, 
"You're going to have to change your way of teaching or there's going to be 
trouble," Swantek said. 
</P>
<P>
After McCrae left, her daughter told Swantek, "You're going to get fired; 
you're going to get fired," the teacher said. 
</P>
<P>
Swantek said she told the child in a firm voice, "Please don't say that again." 
</P>
<P>
The teacher added that the exchange with the girl was the child's "cue to go 
outside to get her mom." McCrae returned shortly afterward and assaulted her, 
Swantek said.

DEPUTIES' HANDLING OF VICE CASE INVESTIGATED; 
</P>
<P>
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT: A LAWMAN ALLOWED A WOMAN TO PERFORM A SEX ACT BEFORE SHE 
WAS ARRESTED, AUTHORITIES SAY. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY DROPPED PROSTITUTION 
CHARGES AGAINST HER.

<P>
Prostitution charges against a dancer were abruptly dropped by the Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office Tuesday because an undercover sheriff's 
deputy allowed the woman to perform a sex act on him before she was arrested, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Three vice investigators who were present during the incident have been 
reassigned pending an internal investigation, according to Assistant Los 
Angeles County Sheriff Jerry Harper. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to drop the case was made by Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, who said the 
deputies' conduct in a Lancaster motel room was "unacceptable and 
indefensible," according to Reiner spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner also said prosecutors in the Lancaster branch of the district attorney's 
office should not have filed charges after reading arrest reports that outlined 
inappropriate conduct by deputies, Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
"The filing showed incredibly poor judgment," Gibbons said. She would not 
comment on whether any disciplinary action would be taken and there was no 
comment from prosecutors in the Lancaster office. 
</P>
<P>
"On the surface of what I read in the arrest reports, I have a problem with 
what happened as far as departmental policy," Harper said. Sheriff's officials 
will also look at whether the deputies' conduct may have violated the law, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A prostitution charge had been filed against a 24-year-old woman on May 2 and 
the case had been set for trial in November. 
</P>
<P>
According to the arrest report, a team of vice investigators acting on an 
informant's tip set up an undercover operation targeting Unlimited Attractions, 
a Lancaster service that provides exotic dancers, and requested that a dancer 
be sent to a motel room for a $150, one-hour session. 
</P>
<P>
The dancer was met at the room by Deputies M. Ward and J. Elliot and Sgt. 
Hilliard, none of whom Harper would identify further. 
</P>
<P>
The woman danced and stripped for the deputies and also sprayed whipped cream 
on their chests and licked it off, the report said. She offered to masturbate 
each of them for $50 each and was given $150, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The report states that Ward lay naked on the floor and that the woman climbed 
on top of him and "began masturbating him," at which point the deputies 
identified themselves and arrested her. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Rhonda Rucker, said the report 
showed the deputies went too far. 
</P>
<P>
"Prostitution is a crime of words," she said. "No act is necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Although Gibbons would not comment on the specific case, she said that 
generally prostitution arrests are made "after there is solicitation and money 
changes hands." 
</P>
<P>
Harper said the Sheriff's Department's policy prohibits vice investigators from 
engaging in sex acts. But he said investigation and prosecution of telephone 
services that commit prostitution under the guise of providing dancers is more 
difficult because the services are more sophisticated than street prostitution 
rings. 
</P>
<P>
That the deputy allegedly removed his clothes is not necessarily improper, 
Harper said, noting that deputies investigating a massage parlor may also be 
required to remove their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
For successful prosecution in such a case, investigators need "a verbal 
agreement and something in furtherance of the act itself," Harper said. "The 
question is, where does one draw the line?"

DEFENDANT'S PLEA FREES JURORS WHO WERE ROUNDED UP OFF THE STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
About a dozen citizens who were hastily ushered into Van Nuys Municipal Court 
last Friday evening and pressed into impromptu jury duty were given unexpected 
court instructions Tuesday -- an order to go home. 
</P>
<P>
"I have good news for you. You're all discharged from the case," Van Nuys 
Municipal Judge Kenneth Lee Chotiner told the panel after the man facing trial 
pleaded guilty to the charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors, who earlier had jokingly chanted the slogan "Free the Chotiner 12," 
filed out of court in seemingly good spirits. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a worthwhile experience," said Mike Mewlon, 45, an executive 
with a Van Nuys construction company, who added that jurors should be selected 
this way more often because it is efficient. 
</P>
<P>
Pam McGuiggan, a phone company saleswoman from Van Nuys, said she didn't mind 
being pressed into jury service even though it made her late for a Bible study 
class and her boss docked her two days pay for missing work. 
</P>
<P>
"We were needed," said McGuiggan, who was withdrawing money from a bank teller 
machine on Van Nuys Boulevard when a marshal ushered her into court. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't know how much I appreciate how well you've taken this," said 
Chotiner, who ordered the juror roundup so he would not have to dismiss 
misdemeanor assault and disturbing the peace charges against Steven Dean 
Beaudry, 35, of North Hollywood. Beaudry was accused of throwing beer on a 
Dodger Stadium security guard Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Courthouse jurors had all been sent home last Friday when Chotiner's clerk 
called for a jury panel shortly after 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
When Beaudry refused to have his trial postponed, Chotiner invoked an 1872 law 
that allows judges to press citizens into jury service. Marshals gathered the 
17 people from street corners and nearby buildings. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of jurors were later dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Chotiner placed Beaudry on two years probation and sentenced him to 12 days in 
jail, which he has already served.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PRISON SENTENCE CUT FOR FAN OF ACTRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge on Tuesday reduced by two years the prison sentence of an obsessed fan 
who barricaded herself inside the Studio City house of actress Sharon Gless. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Superior Court Judge John H. Major reduced the sentence from six 
to four years after reviewing a favorable progress report prepared by the 
California Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
The report stated that Joni Leigh Penn, 30, of Garden Grove has not created 
problems for guards or other prisoners while serving her sentence in the 
California Institute for Women in Frontera. 
</P>
<P>
On July 16, Major sentenced Penn to six years in prison after she pleaded no 
contest to two counts of burglary stemming from the March 30 standoff and an 
earlier break-in at Gless' house. At the time of sentencing, the judge reserved 
the right to reduce the jail term pending an evaluation of Penn's prison 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The sentencing arrangement was part of a plea bargain under which Penn was able 
to avoid being imprisoned for the maximum of nine years, eight months if 
convicted after a trial. 
</P>
<P>
Penn's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Mitchell J. Bruckner, said he believes 
that Major reduced the sentence in part because Penn apologized to Gless during 
the July 16 sentencing hearing. Under the reduced term, Penn could be freed as 
early as March, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Penn broke into Gless' house when the actress was away and barricaded herself 
inside with a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle and 500 rounds of ammunition.

CONGRESS: 24TH DISTRICT

<TEXT>
<P>
Questionnaires were distributed to candidates this month. Answers have been 
edited to fit the available space. 
</P>
<P>
Mideast Crisis 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you generally support President Bush's handling of the Mideast crisis 
precipitated by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait? Briefly 
explain any differences you have with Bush's actions. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman: Yes. I wish the President were able to get Japan and Western European 
countries to carry more of the burden. 
</P>
<P>
Cowles: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Phair: No. The United States military action is counter-productive, elevating 
Hussein to an undeserved status as the anti-imperialist leader of the Middle 
East, and limiting the opportunity for a negotiated regional resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimate Goal 
</P>
<P>
Q. Should the ultimate goal of the United States be to force Iraq to withdraw 
from Kuwait? Or should it be to remove Hussein from power or at least greatly 
reduce his military capacity, either through war or negotiations? 
</P>
<P>
Waxman: Hussein's power must be eliminated, or at least restricted. We must win 
internationally enforced guarantees that he will cease and desist from 
accumulating and developing nuclear and chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Cowles: The primary objective should be the removal of all Iraqi forces from 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Phair: The international community and regional representatives should work for 
an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and drastically reduced armaments for all of 
the Middle East.

Weapons Sale 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support the Bush Administration's proposal to sell billions of 
dollars of additional weapons, including F-15 fighters, TOW missiles and Apache 
helicopters, to Saudi Arabia? 
</P>
<P>
Waxman: Yes, on the condition that there be an explicit understanding with the 
Saudis that these weapons are for defensive use only. We must make certain that 
these weapons are not used against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Cowles: Yes. The necessity of using American forces in the Gulf on a continuing 
basis to deter further aggression by Iraq or any other Arab state would be 
greatly reduced by the government of Saudi Arabia having the military 
sophistication of its neighboring states. 
</P>
<P>
Phair: No. I oppose any additional arms to any Middle East nation. 
</P>
<P>
B-2 Bomber Production 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you favor continued production of the B-2 Stealth bomber beyond the 15 
already in production? 
</P>
<P>
Waxman: No. I am not convinced that additional B-2 Stealth bombers are needed. 
</P>
<P>
Cowles: Yes. The B-2 Stealth will prove to be a continuing military deterrent 
into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
Phair: No. In general, the Stealth has proven not to meet even the military 
goals for which it was designed. 
</P>
<P>
Deficit Reduction 
</P>
<P>
Q. President Bush and congressional leaders recently agreed to a compromise 
package of tax increases and spending cuts designed to reduce the federal 
budget deficit by $40 billion this fiscal year and $500 billion over the next 
five years. This deal, if it gains final congressional approval, would increase 
taxes on gasoline, cigarettes and alcohol; raise Medicare premiums; impose a 
new tax on luxury goods, and reduce itemized deductions that can be taken by 
taxpayers with incomes over $100,000. Do you support this plan? 
</P>
<P>
Waxman: I most definitely oppose the budget. The increased Medicare premiums 
were absolutely unconscionable. The budget ignored the ridiculous tax bubble 
and avoided the obvious need for an increase in income tax on high-income 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Cowles: No. The compromise budget package did not fully address the basic 
problem of excessive government spending. Raising gasoline taxes will hurt the 
lower- and middle-income earners. The elderly, with the majority earning under 
$15,000 per year, cannot afford additional Medicare premiums. 
</P>
<P>
Phair: No. I propose to repeal Gramm-Rudman, take the budget out of the closet, 
make honest revenue projections, increase taxes on the rich and drastically 
reduce the military might, while increasing allocations for housing, health, 
education and environmental repair. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign Spending 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support efforts to restrict campaign spending and reduce the amount 
of contributions that can be made by special interest groups? 
</P>
<P>
Waxman: Yes. Reasonable limits should be set and much prompter disclosure 
should be required. Citizens should know during a campaign who is paying for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Cowles: Yes. We have created a system where incumbents receive more than 75% of 
political action committee money and 99% of incumbents are reelected every two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Phair: Yes. Even though this might be more injurious to challengers, the 
present impact of campaign fund raising is craven vote-selling by incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign Financing 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support full or partial taxpayer financing of political campaigns? 
</P>
<P>
Waxman: Yes. I support partial public support for campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Cowles: No. 
</P>
<P>
Phair: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Capital Punishment 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support capital punishment? If so, do you think it should be imposed 
on those convicted of importing or selling drugs? 
</P>
<P>
Waxman: No. 
</P>
<P>
Cowles: Yes, I support capital punishment. Yes, if while engaged in the 
importation or selling of illegal drugs a firearm or other violent force is 
used, causing death or injury to persons or property. 
</P>
<P>
Phair: No. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support a woman's unrestricted right to an abortion within the first 
three months of pregnancy? 
</P>
<P>
Waxman: Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
Cowles: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Phair: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Unpaid Leave 
</P>
<P>
Q. President Bush in July vetoed legislation that would have required 
businesses employing at least 50 people to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid 
leave per year for childbirth, adoption or serious illness to employees or 
immediate family members. Do you favor this or similar legislation? 
</P>
<P>
Waxman: Yes. Employees deserve it. Business would quickly become accustomed to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Cowles: No. Current legislation provides for maternity, military and other 
unpaid leaves. Extending this further would continue to erode the 
competitiveness of small business. 
</P>
<P>
Phair: Yes. Our economy drafts most adults into employment and gives lessened 
family support or parenting to children, aged and disabled persons. 
</P>
<P>
Assault Rifle Ban 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you favor extending President Bush's ban on the import of semiautomatic 
assault rifles to the domestic production of such weapons? 
</P>
<P>
Waxman: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Cowles: No. 
</P>
<P>
Phair: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Endowment Restrictions 
</P>
<P>
Q. Should Congress impose any content restrictions on obscene or indecent 
materials in reauthorizing the National Endowment for the Arts? 
</P>
<P>
Waxman: No. 
</P>
<P>
Cowles: No. 
</P>
<P>
Phair: No. 
</P>
<P>
Arts Support 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think the federal government should continue to support the arts 
through the NEA? 
</P>
<P>
Waxman: Yes. NEA is a major source of funding for innovative artistic 
endeavors. We should not be intimidated by the fact that some of these 
endeavors are unpopular. 
</P>
<P>
Cowles: No. It is not the function of the federal government to use taxpayer 
money to fund projects or art that do not have a common interest for everyone 
or for art that many people might find objectionable or indecent. 
</P>
<P>
Phair: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-Crime Legislation 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support anti-crime legislation passed by the Senate in July that 
would re-establish the federal death penalty, limit death-row inmates' appeals 
and relax the exclusionary rule that prohibits the use of illegally seized 
evidence in criminal trials? 
</P>
<P>
Waxman: No. This bill is an over-reaction to the crime problem. I do not 
believe crime should be used as a justification for curtailing civil liberties. 
The rights established by the Warren Court should be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Cowles: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Phair: No. These measures have not proven effective in crime reduction, but do 
threaten important constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
Reducing Drug Use 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe our present strategy of criminal prosecution, interdiction of 
supplies, and imprisonment of users and dealers is significantly reducing the 
level of drug use in the United States? If not, what should be done? 
</P>
<P>
Waxman: It is too soon to say. Many of these tactics are just being implemented 
on a large scale. They should be given a reasonable time to succeed or fail. 
</P>
<P>
Cowles: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Phair: No. Education and treatment programs should be expanded. Most drug use 
should be decriminalized and the savings transferred to prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
Limiting Terms 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support limiting the number of terms members of Congress can serve? 
If yes, what should the limits be for members of the House and Senate? 
</P>
<P>
Waxman: No. The constitutionally mandated two-year terms for House members and 
six-year terms for senators give voters ample opportunity to reject 
officeholders who they feel are too old, no longer effective or have become 
corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
Cowles: Yes -- House, 10 years. Senate, 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Phair: Yes. Three terms for the House; two terms for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

RELEASE THE KEATING REPORT NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six weeks after its completion, the report by the Senate Ethics Committee's 
special counsel on the part played by the "Keating Five" in the savings and 
loan scandal remains hidden from public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
The report is said to recommend dropping charges of improper conduct against 
John Glenn (D-Ohio) and Arizona's John McCain, the only Republican among the 
five senators who reaped a total of $1.3 million in political contributions 
after helping Charles H. Keating Jr. hold off federal regulators. That 
intervention helped prolong the survival of Keating's shaky Lincoln Savings 
&amp; Loan. One result was to balloon the cost that must now be paid to bail 
out Lincoln's depositors. 
</P>
<P>
This week McCain and Glenn demanded the immediate release of special committee 
counsel Robert S. Bennett's report, a 354-page compilation of evidence and 
recommendations, believing it will help restore their political reputations. 
That's understandable. But there is a much larger issue involved in the 
committee's delay in releasing the report. That is the public's right to know, 
in timely fashion, what its elected representatives may have been up to, 
including most specifically whether some of them violated Senate rules and 
certain federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
McCain and other Republicans charge that the Bennett report is being held back 
for partisan reasons until after next month's congressional elections, because 
it proposes further investigations of Democratic Sens. Alan Cranston of 
California, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan. 
Whatever the validity of that claim, the Ethics Committee has now voted to hold 
public hearings on senatorial involvement with Keating beginning Nov. 15, more 
than a week after the elections. That is something less than 
confidence-inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
The savings and loan debacle dwarfs every previous financial scandal in the 
nation's history. New estimates are that ultimately it could cost taxpayers up 
to $1 trillion. How did the Keating Five, or the Keating Three, contribute to 
this mess? The Ethics Committee has some clues, maybe even some answers. The 
public has a right to that information, now and in full.

RIGHTS VETO SENDS A WRONG MESSAGE; 
</P>
<P>
WHY SAIL AGAINST SO MANY AMERICANS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With his veto of the Civil Rights Act of 1990, President Bush has revived a 
divisive issue of social justice and forfeited, on this issue at least, an 
important share of his Administration's moral credibility. 
</P>
<P>
If the 101st Congress now becomes the first in the history of this Republic to 
sustain the President's veto of a civil rights bill, the minority of senators 
and representatives responsible will share the blame for a needless and hurtful 
affront to women and members of racial, ethnic and religious minorities. 
</P>
<P>
In his veto message, Bush repeated his charge that the bill "employs a maze of 
highly legalistic language to introduce the destructive force of quotas into 
our national employment system." To strain his way to that conclusion, the 
President has been forced to assert that the civil rights act does not mean 
what it says when it states that: 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing in the amendments made by this act shall be construed to require to 
encourage an employer to adopt hiring or promotional quotas on the basis of 
race, color, religion, sex or national origin." 
</P>
<P>
If that plain language constitutes a legalistic maze, fair-minded people may 
puzzle over how to describe the objections raised by Bush and his chief legal 
advisers. 
</P>
<P>
They do not, after all, contend that the Civil Rights Act of 1990 requires 
quotas. Rather, they insist that it will lead employers to surreptitiously 
adopt them rather than bear the burden of legally defending discriminatory 
hiring and promotional practices on the basis of "business necessity." 
</P>
<P>
Monday, in a memo to Bush, Atty. General Dick Thornburgh attacked what he 
called the bill's "unreasonably restrictive definition of business necessity," 
because it would "force employers to defend any employment practice 'involving 
selection' by showing 'a significant relationship to successful performance of 
the job.' " 
</P>
<P>
In place of that standard, Thornburgh and Bush have urged Congress to adopt a 
bill that would allow employers to justify discrimination in employment or 
promotion on the basis of "legitimate business objectives." 
</P>
<P>
The difference implicit in these two tests is clear: Under the well-tested 
business necessity standard proposed by Congress, the owner of a factory would 
be free to impose a weight-lifting test on applicants for positions as 
boiler-makers, even though a disproportionate number of women would be 
excluded. However, the owner of a bakery hiring people to make cream-puffs 
would not be free to impose such a test. 
</P>
<P>
But under the President's novel "business objectives" standard, the owners of 
both concerns could refuse to hire or promote women or minorities simply 
because they believe their presence would disrupt the workplace or upset their 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
Reasonable people will have little trouble in discerning which of these legal 
tests will result in discrimination. They will have greater difficulty in 
deciding why a President would choose to set his government's face so firmly 
against the legitimate rights and aspirations of so large a number of 
Americans.

ODD RACE; 
</P>
<P>
NO CHOICE BEST CHOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The race for the 4th District seat on the state Board of Equalization is 
between a man who cannot serve and one who should not serve. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Paul Carpenter, a former state senator who currently sits on the the 
board, was convicted last month on four felony counts, including extortion and 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
If elected, he cannot serve. Inasmuch as America's political system was not 
designed to fill public offices by default, we cannot make any recommendation 
in this race. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter was convicted by a federal jury in Sacramento on charges arising from 
a years-long FBI sting operation in which agents tried to buy votes of 
legislators. By the time the verdict was delivered, Carpenter's name already 
was on the Nov. 6 ballot and could not be removed. 
</P>
<P>
California law forbids felons from holding elective office. But Carpenter may 
win anyway; then the governor will have to appoint his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican candidate is Joseph H. Adams, a senior tax auditor with 30 years 
of service with the board of equalization. Adams is a pleasant person, but does 
not have the broader background needed in effective public servants. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Equalization is responsible for assuring that taxes in various 
parts of the state are imposed equitably. Of its four elected members, two 
represent the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, an election matches the two best candidates. In the 4th District, that 
is not possible. Better perhaps to take the second-best way under the law than 
have the office filled by accident: Let the governor make an interim 
appointment.

NOBEL PEACE PRIZE AWARDED TO GORBACHEV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is tragically ironic that the Nobel Peace Prize, which has honored in the 
past some of the greatest champions of justice and models of virtue, has fallen 
this year upon Gorbachev, the man who chose to use force to suppress the 
Lithuanian democratic uprising, one of Eastern Europe's most peaceful 
revolutions of the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Armed only with their national songs and tri-color flags, the Lithuanians took 
to the streets and polling booths to express their intentions of regaining 
their rightful independence which was stolen in 1940; yet Gorbachev responded 
by ordering Soviet tanks to roll through the streets of Vilnius. 
</P>
<P>
It was Gorbachev who insisted on strangling the nation by shutting off its gas 
lines and cutting off vital medical supplies. It was Gorbachev who allowed Red 
Army soldiers to storm Red Cross hospitals in Lithuania, seize Lithuanian 
youths who had fled their occupier's army and beat them into submission. By 
choosing to overlook Gorbachev's stomping of the human spirit and violations of 
human rights, the Nobel committee has greatly compromised the ideals which the 
prize represents. 
</P>
<P>
The Nobel Prize committee should be honoring a noble people, the Lithuanians, 
instead of the man who continues their oppression.

In response to "Gorbachev Clearly Deserved It" (editorial, Oct. 16): 
</P>
<P>
Giving Gorbachev a Nobel Prize for his contribution to world peace is rather 
like rewarding a eunuch for exercising sexual restraint. 
</P>
<P>
One wonders what Gorbachev's contribution to the cause of peace would have been 
had he not been busy dealing with military defeat in Afghanistan, economic ruin 
at home, nationalism and ethnic unrest in the Soviet republics and the serious 
political challenges of Boris Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
The mere absence of the usual amount of mischief in a Soviet leader ought not 
to be mistaken for the good works of a peacemaker.

In response to Cal Thomas' "Reagan's Doing, Gorbachev's Glory" (Commentary, 
Oct. 19): 
</P>
<P>
The Nobel Peace Prize for Reagan, not Gorbachev? Sour grapes! While Gorbachev 
was disengaging Leonid Brezhnev's army from Afghanistan, Reagan had resumed 
U.S. military aid to nuclear Iraq, reversing the embargo Jimmy Carter had begun 
in response to Saddam Hussein's atrocities -- crimes that both Reagan and Bush 
have chosen to ignore until recently when an excuse was needed to prepare for 
war over oil. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev would have reformed the Soviet Union regardless of who was President 
of the United States; but the Berlin Wall would still be standing today if the 
Soviet conservative were still in power. Reagan deserves some credit for 
neutralizing the American war lobby over the issue of cooperating with our 
former enemies, but compared to the magnitude of Gorbachev's challenges to the 
conservative rottenness of his own political party, Reagan's contribution is 
minor.

FAILURE TO BRING BLACK AMERICANS INTO THE MAINSTREAM IS IMMORAL; IT'S ALSO A

<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD N. GOODWIN, Richard N. Goodwin was an assistant special counsel to 
President John F. Kennedy and a special assistant to President Lyndon B. 
Johnson. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From my office in the West Wing of the White House I could see the windows of 
the adjacent Executive Office Building redden with the first light of a June 
dawn. I had spent the entire night drafting a speech that Lyndon Johnson was to 
deliver at the Howard University commencement that very afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we've got voting rights, Dick," the President had told me, "but that's 
just the tail on the pig. Now we've got to go for the whole hog." I had worked 
closely enough with Johnson to understand the object of his porcine quest. A 
series of civil-rights laws had swept aside the legal barriers to equal 
opportunity. The task now was to transform the abstractions of law into reality 
-- jobs, income, standard of living, equal treatment in every sector of life. 
</P>
<P>
Legal equality was not enough. Not for those who had been crippled by 
generations of gateless poverty, preceded by two centuries of slavery. A few 
laws could not compensate for so long a heritage of oppression. 
</P>
<P>
So Johnson was ready to take the next step -- decisive, far-reaching 
affirmative action to provide American blacks with the education, jobs, access 
to income essential to make them full members of American society. 
</P>
<P>
Two months later, American combat troops were on their way to Vietnam. The 
necessities of war had overwhelmed the President's profoundly held intention to 
remedy the single most brutal injustice of American history -- the racial 
oppression that was, and that remains, the great original sin of the American 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
From that day to this the relative condition of black Americans has worsened by 
every measure -- from infant mortality to income. And we have done virtually 
nothing about it. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, just the other day, Congress passed a rather mild "civil-rights bill" 
that takes a few small steps toward the goals so loftily proclaimed on that 
June day a quarter of a century ago. It is a decent bill, one that will make it 
somewhat easier for blacks to enter the mainstream of American society. Not 
full equality, but a step in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
And the President of the United States, one George Bush, has vetoed that bill. 
Using a series of tendentious rationalizations -- too riddled with misstatement 
and misunderstanding to permit detailed refutation -- he has deprived black 
Americans of their first real glimmer of hope since the moral destruction of 
the war in Vietnam. Thus the Republican successor to the Great Emancipator has 
-- perhaps unwittingly -- become the instrument of the great oppression. Once 
again the promises made to the ear have been broken to the heart. 
</P>
<P>
It does not require a litany of statistics, the accumulation of evidence from 
daily life, to prove a self-evident reality -- America is a nation riddled with 
racism. Black Americans live shorter and more impoverished lives, the vitality 
and intelligence of black children is snuffed out at an early age. Almost all 
aspects of our national life -- those that offer opportunities and rewards for 
achievement -- are at least partially closed to blacks. And for most those 
doors begin to close from the moment of birth. 
</P>
<P>
There is no rational way to deny this reality. But should you doubt it, visit 
South-Central Los Angeles or, for that matter, the inner cities of every major 
urban center. You will see it for yourself -- conditions so abysmal, social 
institutions so defective that mere survival is an achievement and only the 
strongest and most fortunate can hope to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks are the sufferers from oppression. But we are all losers. We cannot 
afford to eliminate a large number of our fellow citizens from the enterprise 
and production on which the well-being of all Americans is based. The resistant 
racism that stains America has created a burden and a cost that all of us must 
bear. And when the history of U.S. economic decline is written -- in a not too 
distant future -- the failure to assimilate black Americans will rank high 
among the causes. 
</P>
<P>
Moral imperatives and practical necessities do not always coincide. But this is 
such a time. George Bush has not simply made a mistake or done the wrong thing. 
He has committed an enormous wrong -- against blacks, against the founding 
principles of his own party and against the idea of America itself. He 
proclaims himself passionately attached to the Pledge of Allegiance. Perhaps he 
should read it more carefully. It calls for "liberty and justice for all." Not 
all whites or all employers, but everyone. And in vetoing the civil-rights act 
he participates in a denial of that justice to millions. Thus, he joins Ronald 
Reagan in that mercifully short roll of shame -- Presidents who have betrayed 
their solemn obligation, sworn to before God, to strike down the weapons by 
which fellow citizens are denied the equality that is amply guaranteed in law 
but so cruelly deprived in practice.

2 ACTON OFFICIALS CHARGED WITH REMOVING SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unlike Zorro or the Lone Ranger, the vigilantes of Acton do not wear masks. 
</P>
<P>
And prosecutors say there is little doubt that Charles Brink and Joel Levy, 
members of the Town Council in this unincorporated mountain community southwest 
of Palmdale, were behind a campaign in which hundreds of real estate and 
developers' signs were torn down between May and September. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday prosecutors filed charges of felony conspiracy to commit theft and 
vandalism, felony grand theft, misdemeanor vandalism and misdemeanor petty 
theft against Brink and Levy in the alleged sign caper. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Tuesday, Brink said: "People have a right to enforce 
the law. If a vigilante enforces the law, they have a right to do it. . . . We 
have the support of the people in Acton and of the county code." 
</P>
<P>
But the Los Angeles County district attorney's office disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint filed in Lancaster Superior Court alleges that Brink and Levy 
stole or vandalized seven signs worth $3,500, some of which were legally posted 
"open house" signs on private property. 
</P>
<P>
Brink said he tore down the signs because he thought they were illegally posted 
and a blight on the rural community, which has a population of 10,000. Levy 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
During meetings of the nine-member elected council on which he and Levy serve, 
Brink allegedly boasted about tearing down more than 300 signs, according to 
court records and prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
The Town Council is an advisory group to the county but is not a government 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors estimate that total losses to developers, real estate agents and 
private homeowners exceed $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to have these two gentlemen accept responsibility for their 
behavior," said Deputy Dist. Atty Pamela Rhodes. "Our concern is that public 
leaders are taking a position that they are above the law. And they are not." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said it was unusual to have to press such charges against members 
of an elected body. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the cases where county sign ordinances were violated, Rhodes said, 
Brink and Levy should have contacted county officials rather than trespassing 
on private property and stealing or destroying signs. 
</P>
<P>
Brink, who said he and Levy were planning to surrender today to authorities in 
Lancaster, said he tore down only illegal signs that he believed were on public 
property. He said most developers have cooperated with his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"Of the 300 signs I've removed, only one that I can think of was on private 
property, in which case that was trespassing and a mistake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brink asserted that the prosecution was politically motivated and that Mark 
Lebens, a manager with Woodgate Real Estate Corp. in Palmdale, was behind the 
effort to have criminal charges filed. 
</P>
<P>
Lebens, who was among those who complained to the Sheriff's Department about 
the vandalism, said of Brink: "I think his position with the Town Council has 
gone to his head." 
</P>
<P>
Although Lebens acknowledged that one billboard-type sign near the Antelope 
Valley Freeway that was defaced had been posted illegally, he said the other 
signs were legal.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
SHORE THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A gentle giant of a shark showed up on Orange County's shoreline this week, 
giving landlubbers a fascinating glimpse of a deep-sea creature so rare that 
only five of its kind have been found anywhere since they were first discovered 
a mere 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Megachasma pelagios, as the megamouth shark is known to scientists, 
survived after being ensnared Sunday in the gill net of a fishing boat off Dana 
Point. 
</P>
<P>
The fisherman could have let it die -- as is the sad fate of so many dolphins 
and other creatures caught in gill nets. Instead, he cut his $5,000 net, 
tethered the shark and towed it back to shore, sure that he had stumbled upon a 
treasure. That gave marine experts the unusual opportunity to study it and add 
to knowledge that can be used to teach men to better share the oceans with 
their inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the shark's huge appetite for plankton, aquariums in the United 
States and Japan refused to accept it. Also, there were fears that it would die 
in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, in the 39 hours it was tethered to the fisherman's boat, it was poked, 
ogled and photographed, its big eyes following these activities with seeming 
bemusement. Occasionally it flinched when touched. Finally, it was rigged with 
tracking devices and released. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the Persian Gulf continues to simmer, there's a budget crisis and a hole 
in the ozone layer. But the short visit by this bonhomous creature and its safe 
return to sea after a close encounter with humans was a bit of good news.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES;

<P>
MEASURE WOULD TRASH IRVINE'S STRUCTURE FOR SELF-GOVERNANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK P. PETRACCA, Mark P. Petracca is an assistant professor of political 
science at UC Irvine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Popularly elected leadership is the essence of democratic government. When was 
the last time that citizens in any representative democracy were asked by their 
government to abolish democratically elected leadership? It's a rare event, 
indeed, more familiar to authoritarian or totalitarian regimes. 
</P>
<P>
Yet that's precisely what the Irvine City Council is asking Irvine residents to 
do by voting for Measure E, which will eliminate the direct election of 
Irvine's mayor. 
</P>
<P>
For the third time in five years, Irvine voters must decide whether they want a 
mayor directly elected by the people or a mayor appointed by the majority of 
the City Council behind closed doors. Capitalizing on popular dissatisfaction 
with Measure D, the City Council moved hastily to put Measure E on the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Council, Measure E will remedy "the expensive lawsuits and 
divisive elections" produced by Measure D. How will it accomplish this? Not by 
abolishing or amending Measure D but by eliminating the direct election of the 
mayor. This is the political equivalent of selling your automobile because it 
has a flat tire. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the council's claim, there is nothing intrinsic in the direct 
election of the mayor that leads to expensive lawsuits and divisive elections. 
These are the stepchildren of Measure D, which provides for political 
succession in the event that a council member is elected mayor, and have no 
family relationship whatsoever to a directly elected mayor. Measure E has been 
deceptively set up to force voters to render a single judgment on two very 
distinct issues. 
</P>
<P>
For varied reasons, a city the size of Irvine needs a directly elected mayor. 
First, a directly elected mayor can provide the political leadership and 
initiative necessary for community improvement in a municipality undergoing the 
strains of development and growth. American cities with council-manager forms 
of government -- the kind Irvine has -- recognize that while government by a 
professional city manager works well for small cities, larger cities need the 
leadership and initiative that comes from a directly elected mayor. As a 
result, two-thirds of these cities directly elect mayors in addition to city 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
Second, a directly elected mayor guarantees political accountability for the 
principal executive official in the city. That's as it should be in a 
representative democracy. The results of effective political accountability can 
be seen in the results of Irvine's June election. The political system worked; 
the electorate effectively rejected one political agenda and endorsed another. 
</P>
<P>
Third, Irvine needs a directly elected mayor to stand up to the Irvine Co., 
which has forcefully opposed the direct election of the mayor because it 
challenges the company's control over the city's development. As the dominant 
voice in the city, the Irvine Co. has a major stake in diminishing the ability 
of Irvine residents to speak through a single voice in opposition to its 
interests, especially through a popularly elected mayor with ample political 
credibility and legitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine needs a directly elected mayor to buttress the development ambitions of 
the Irvine Co. and to balance the influence of the company on important 
political and economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine needs electoral reform. However, reform must nurture, not trash, the 
city's commitment to democratization. Irvine's problems with political 
succession must be remedied. But that remedy should not come at the price of 
democratically elected leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Measure E is a giant step backward in self-governance. In the name of 
democratic leadership, Irvine residents should send a stern rebuke -- No on 
Measure E -- to those who would too quickly sacrifice democracy in pursuit of 
private interests.

PEOPLE: 5 EXECUTIVES RESIGN AT CONTINENTAL AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Continental Airlines announced the resignation of five top executives in what 
appeared to be a major housecleaning at the Houston-based carrier. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Continental said the action was a "cost-efficiency measure" 
intended to make Continental more competitive worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
The action came two months after controversial former Chairman Frank Lorenzo 
quit and sold his Continental stake to Scandinavian Airlines System. SAS, which 
owns 18.4% of Continental's stock, was instrumental in hiring Delta Air Lines 
President Hollis Harris as Lorenzo's replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Continental said Tuesday that Harris would be given the additional role as 
president, replacing Mickey Foret, who is leaving the company to pursue other 
interests, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Others who plan to leave include Neal Neehan, senior vice president-customer 
services; Clark Omstad, senior vice president-properties and government 
affairs; Jim Arpey, senior vice president-aircraft programs, and Elliott 
Seiden, vice president and associate general counsel for Continental Airlines 
Holdings Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Continental named Thomas Kalil senior vice president-customer service and said 
Lewis Jordan, executive vice president and system general manager, was given 
the additional responsibility for managing the company's international 
division. 
</P>
<P>
"With radically higher fuel costs, Continental must become a stronger 
competitor in the global marketplace," said Harris, Continental's chairman and 
chief executive. "We have reaffirmed our intention to become a preferred 
airline among frequent travelers around the world."

OVERALL MARKET RISES, BUT DOW RETREATS 22.03 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Profit taking and skepticism over Washington's ability to fashion a budget 
pushed blue chips lower Tuesday while the broader market was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index closed down 22.03 at 2,494.06. Much of the fall 
came in the session's last hour during a wave of computerized sell programs. 
</P>
<P>
However, for the second day in a row, the broader market gave conflicting 
signals. Leading stocks outnumbered losers by 804 to 688 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, but the NYSE composite index still lost 1.02 points to 170.50. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume shrank to 146.30 million shares from Monday's 152.65 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The excesses on Thursday and Friday were in the Dow," said Larry Wachtel, 
Prudential-Bache analyst, referring to a combined 133-point rally last week. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said blue chips were realigning after their two-day rally as traders 
took profits. Meanwhile, though over-the-counter stocks had advanced strongly 
Monday, they ran out of steam on Tuesday. The NASDAQ OTC composite index 
slipped fractionally. 
</P>
<P>
"The market needs to break above 2,550 (on the Dow) on expanding volume to give 
us an indication that this is more than a snap-back rally," said Kenneth 
Spence, director of technical analysis at Salomon Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Budget talks appeared stymied again Tuesday as House Democrats insisted on a 
tax increase on the rich, while President Bush and the Republicans talked 
instead of cutting tax deductions. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Financial stocks took a new pounding, in what is becoming a broken-record of 
grief for many investors. Citicorp dropped 3/8 to 12 5/8 after reports that 
investors were reluctant to buy the bank's short-term commercial paper on 
Monday, fearing it is too risky. Other bank losers included First Interstate, 
down 1 1/4 to 20 5/8, First Chicago, down 3/4 to 14 1/8, and C&amp;S/Sovran, 
down 2 3/8 to 16 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Among S&amp;Ls, Glenfed slumped 5/8 to 7 1/2 after it slashed its quarterly 
dividend in half, to 15 cents a share. CalFed dropped 3/8 to 4, HomeFed fell 
1/2 to 4 3/4 and Citadel Holding tumbled 1 3/8 to 23 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Good earnings news sent insurer Chubb up 2 1/2 to 41 7/8. Another insurer, 
Unum Corp., posted stronger-than-expected profits and rose 1 1/2 to 40 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Entertainment stocks were mixed. Time Warner climbed 4 1/2 to 76 1/4 in the 
wake of a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss. Paramount added 1 1/8 to 37 1/4 
and MCA rose 1 5/8 to 58 7/8. Also, Disney rose 5/8 to 96 1/2 after forming a 
partnership with Japanese institutional investors to provide $600 million in 
film financing. 
</P>
<P>
But Cap Cities/ABC tumbled 32 to 400 after projecting weak fourth-quarter 
earnings because of slumping ad sales. 
</P>
<P>
* Tech stocks were mixed. Diagnostic Products lost 4 to 26 1/2, apparently on 
earnings concerns. Sun Microsystems fell 2 3/4 to 20 1/8 after it reported 
strong earnings but also announced a hiring freeze because of sales concerns. 
Conner Peripherals rose 1 1/4 to 22 7/8, following healthy earnings. 
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, share prices closed up nearly 3%, boosted by domestic investor 
position covering and some foreign institutional buying. The DAX index of 30 
leading German shares ended 39.83 points higher at 1,514.34. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed higher as plunging global oil 
prices spurred the market to its seventh consecutive gain. The 225-share Nikkei 
average rose 227.44 to 25,298.30. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stocks shrugged off a lower opening on Wall Street to trade firmer 
in generally thin late business with prices buoyed by the recent weaker trend 
in oil. The Financial Times 100-share index gained 25, or 1.2%, to 2,127.0. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT: Traders Pessimistic; Bond Prices Decline 
</P>
<P>
Most bond prices weakened, hurt by what traders called a shroud of economic 
uncertainty overhanging the market and disgust with the government negotiations 
to fashion a budget agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year bond ended the day about a half point lower or down 
$5 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield rose to 8.79% from 8.75% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 7.75%, down from 7.813% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY: Dollar Strengthens as Fed Unloads Yen 
</P>
<P>
The dollar traded mostly higher against other major currencies Tuesday, rising 
most strongly against the Japanese yen after the Federal Reserve sold yen to 
buy dollars, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the Fed sold an undetermined amount of yen for dollars, apparently 
at the request of a customer, most likely another central bank. Traders said 
the sale was not believed to be an attempt by the Fed to affect the value of 
the dollar against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed at 1.518 German marks, flat with Monday. It rose to 128.15 
Japanese yen, up sharply from Monday's 126.02. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the British pound fell to $1.943 from $1.945 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: Spot Crude Price Up; Copper Surges 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices rebounded after Monday's record drop of more than $5 a barrel, which 
was driven by peace signals in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, copper prices surged, and platinum led the precious 
metals higher. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, spot crude oil for December delivery ended 
at $29.37 a barrel, up from Monday's close of $28.38 for the November contract. 
</P>
<P>
Futures prices of refined products finished broadly mixed, with near-term 
deliveries up sharply after Monday's dramatic plunge. 
</P>
<P>
Heating oil was 3.83 cents lower to 5.08 cents higher, with November at 81.06 
cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 3.13 cents lower to 3.4 cents higher, 
with November at 79.90 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of copper futures surged on the Comex in a powerful rally ignited by 
fading recession fears and computer-generated buying. 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures settled 3.6 to 5.2 cents higher, with the spot contract at $1.32 
a pound. The rally marked copper's fourth-straight daily advance from a 
three-month low of $1.23 last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Platinum futures also rose sharply for the fifth straight day on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange. Like copper, platinum prices fell dramatically when 
recession fears were on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
Platinum settled $9.90 to $10.10 higher, with October at $422.40 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
On the Comex, gold futures ended $1.50 to $1.60 higher, with October at $371.20 
an ounce; silver was 2.4 to 2.5 cents higher, with October at $4.22.

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS NET IS $248 MILLION

<P>
McDonnell Douglas Corp. reported a third-quarter profit of $248 million 
Tuesday, nearly all of it due to a one-time $234-million gain from a pension 
fund change. 
</P>
<P>
The company also reversed all of its earnings on the C-17 transport aircraft 
program, which resulted in a one-time charge of $93 million to cover the 
elimination of previously reported earnings dating back to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas, the nation's largest defense contractor, now estimates that 
it won't make any money on the $6-billion C-17 project, which is scheduled for 
a first flight in June of next year and completion in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
"Backing out the unusual items, these earnings were surprisingly stronger than 
expected," said Howard Rubel, a stock analyst for C. J. Lawrence in New York. 
"The C-17 is a disappointment, but hopefully this is a clear-the-decks approach 
and let's go from here." 
</P>
<P>
The big gain involving the pension fund came after McDonnell Douglas executives 
decided to dissolve the company's plan covering 14,000 retired salaried 
employees and replace it with an annuity sold by Metropolitan Life Insurance 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
Without the two unusual items, the company would have reported a profit of $72 
million in the quarter. In last year's third quarter, McDonnell Douglas had a 
profit of $38 million. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the quarter was $4.17 billion, up 12% from $3.70 billion for the 
same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas, headquartered in St. Louis, makes aircraft for the Air 
Force, the Navy and the Marines, as well as missiles and space systems. The 
company is also the second-biggest maker of commercial aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"There was continued improvement in the operation of all of our businesses," 
said John McDonnell, chairman and chief executive. "For most of them, the third 
quarter was better than the second and the second was better than the first. 
And our results to date this year are far better than last year." 
</P>
<P>
All of the company's businesses had improved profits during the quarter ended 
Sept. 30 except the transport aircraft division based in Long Beach, which is 
still racking up losses.

RJR SLASHES ITS LOSS IN THE THIRD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. on Tuesday reported a sharply lower third-quarter 
loss, aided by improved profit in the tobacco business, lower interest expenses 
and special items. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based company said its loss in the quarter fell to $86 million 
from $447 million in the 1989 period. Sales rose 17.7% to $3.53 billion from $3 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
RJR, the second-largest U.S. tobacco company and a major food producer, owns a 
host of well-known brands, including Winston and Salem cigarettes, Oreo, Fig 
Newton and Ritz cookies and crackers, Planters peanuts and Lifesaver candies. 
</P>
<P>
RJR took on a huge debt load when it went private in a record $25-billion 
leveraged buyout last year. 
</P>
<P>
It said quarterly operating income before interest charges on its debt, taxes 
and other items rose 56.2% to $706 million from $452 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"By focusing on efficiency and productivity gains, we've improved the operating 
performance of both our tobacco businesses and our food businesses," Chairman 
Louis Gerstner Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
Interest payments related mainly to RJR's 1989 buyout were $507 million in the 
quarter, which included additional costs of $303 million for depreciation and 
other items. 
</P>
<P>
Total interest expense fell to $845 million in the quarter from $983 million a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The results included a net gain of $108 million from a debt restructuring last 
summer. The recapitalization was designed to bring the company's total debt 
load under $20 billion, from $28.7 billion after the buyout was completed in 
February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Worldwide tobacco sales jumped 36% to $2.11 billion in the quarter from $1.55 
billion a year ago. Higher prices and cost reductions improved profitability, 
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Operating income in tobacco, before amortization and other items, rose 51.4% to 
$683 million from $451 million. But last year's results were depressed by about 
$230 million, reflecting lower volumes and a decision to eliminate excess 
inventory.

MIDEAST FALLOUT IS UNEVEN; OIL PROFITS MIXED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Texaco Inc. said earnings were up in the third quarter, mainly because of 
higher crude oil prices, but Mobil Corp. and Shell Oil Co. reported profits 
that were down sharply as losses in chemicals, refining and marketing more than 
offset crude oil gains. 
</P>
<P>
Amerada Hess Corp. reported a fivefold increase in net income for the quarter, 
primarily because of gains in petroleum futures trading. 
</P>
<P>
The results underscored the varying effects the Middle East crisis is having on 
oil companies, which saw crude oil prices soar from $21 a barrel Aug. 1 to as 
high as $40 a barrel during the third quarter. The difference depended on a 
company's balance of businesses, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking about an industry with three legs: 'upstream' (oil exploration 
and production); refining and marketing, and chemicals," said Jack Aydin, an 
energy analyst with McDonald &amp; Co. Securities Inc. in New York. "When one 
side of the business does well, the other segments may do poorly, and there's 
definitely an offset." 
</P>
<P>
White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco Inc., the nation's third-largest oil company, 
reported net income of $381 million in its third quarter, a 25% increase over 
the $305 million reported in the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco's exploration and production operations benefited from higher crude oil 
prices. These so-called upstream operations reported net income of $346 
million, up from $189 million. 
</P>
<P>
On the refining and marketing side, Texaco also reported a profit gain, unlike 
other oil companies whose so-called downstream operations suffered. 
</P>
<P>
Refining and marketing reported net income of $169 million in the quarter, up 
from $159 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
That increase might have been greater had not Texaco held back on increasing 
its wholesale and retail gasoline prices, James W. Kinnear, Texaco's president 
and chief executive, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"While this (crude oil price) increase benefited the company's upstream 
results, downstream refined product margins declined significantly since July 
due to the inability of the competitive marketplace to absorb higher crude and 
product acquisition costs," Kinnear said. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco's petrochemical operations also suffered from higher costs of crude oil, 
as well as a general malaise in the petrochemical industry, with net income of 
$12 million in the quarter, down from $69 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil Corp., the nation's second-largest oil company, based in Fairfax, Va., 
saw its net income drop dramatically in the third quarter, despite increased 
earnings from higher crude prices. Net income was $379 million, down 29% from 
the $532 million reported a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil, one of the nation's largest refiners and a net buyer of crude oil, said 
losses in chemicals and refining and marketing operations more than offset 
gains in its oil exploration and production business. 
</P>
<P>
"In the United States, our monthly average crude oil cost more than doubled 
from June to September," Mobil Chairman Allen E. Murray said in a statement. 
"However, we only recovered about half of the increase in the market." 
</P>
<P>
Upstream, Mobil reported net income of $380 million, up from $205 million a 
year ago. But refining and marketing profits fell to only $5 million in the 
quarter from $366 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, chemicals, upon which Mobil is heavily dependent, saw earnings fall 
to $85 million from $121 million in the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
Shell Oil Co. of Houston, the nation's largest marketer and retailer of 
gasoline, also blamed losses in refining and marketing for the 33% decline in 
its third-quarter net income, to $227 million from $340 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Exploration and production profits were up to $203 million from $136 million 
last year. But refining and marketing profits fell to $13 million from $106 
million because of slimmer margins and increased refinery maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Chemical earnings fell to $65 million from $137 million because of higher crude 
and feedstock costs. 
</P>
<P>
Amerada Hess Corp., which is mainly a refiner and marketer based in New York, 
reported net income of $280 million, a whopping 5 1/2 times the $51.8 million 
earned in the third quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Of the third-quarter income total, $213.8 million resulted from petroleum 
futures trading, the company reported. Amerada Hess took the unusual step of 
breaking out those profits in an effort to deflect criticism about the huge 
increase in its overall profit and to show that it did not make it at the 
expense of consumers, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sun Co., a major refiner based in Radnor, Pa., reported net income 
of $25 million in the third quarter, a 71% decrease from $85 million in the 
third quarter of 1989.

Allergan Inc.: The international maker of contact lenses and eye- and skin-care 
products posted third-quarter income of $25.4 million, 14% less than a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Allergan Inc., formerly a unit of SmithKline Beckman Corp., went public July 
27, 1989. Sales advanced 8% to a record $222.2 million. The Irvine firm said 
the results resulted from strong sales growth in its pharmaceutical, surgical 
and dermatology businesses, which came despite adverse sales in optical 
operations.

A 'MOTOWN' HISTORY LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OK, so Motown's not the first to lie about its age. 
</P>
<P>
"Motown 30: What's Goin' On," which was taped Monday at the Pantages Theatre 
for a CBS special, was designed as a successor to Motown's spectacular 25th 
anniversary special . . . which took place in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The producers of the show can be forgiven for the fib, which links it to the 
1983 special. That event was both a television and Motown landmark, highlighted 
by electrifying performances by Michael Jackson, moonwalking his way through 
"Billie Jean" in what turned out to be a key step in his rise to the top, and 
Marvin Gaye, capping his triumphant commercial and artistic comeback. 
</P>
<P>
But by recalling "Motown 25," Monday's show evoked a standard it could not 
possibly live up to. There was no Michael this time, and no Marvin, who was 
shot and killed by his father in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Few moments in Monday's concert, which will be televised on Nov. 25, even 
hinted at that spectacle. What could have been a peak -- a touchingly 
understated tribute to ailing singer Mary Wells by Stevie Wonder, Smokey 
Robinson and Gladys Knight -- fell a bit flat. 
</P>
<P>
And if the producers failed at math, they get straight A's in history. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember watching 'The Mickey Mouse Club' or 'American Bandstand' and not 
seeing one black person," said Suzanne dePasse, president of Gordy/dePasse 
Productions and the show's executive producer, during a Monday afternoon 
rehearsal. "We went from practically invisible to dominating performances in 
every art, and that's the reason for this show." 
</P>
<P>
On that count, the show, a black-tie affair benefiting the Brotherhood Crusade, 
succeeded as both entertainment and education, with humor pushing aside self- 
righteousness, pride winning over smugness and talent speaking for itself. 
</P>
<P>
The event centered on Motown music and artists, including Wonder, Robinson and 
Knight, but also featured a wide spectrum of performers, including 
singer-dancer Debbie Allen, rappers Queen Latifah and Heavy D &amp; the Boyz, 
actress-comedienne Whoopi Goldberg (masquerading as Diana Ross) and "Phantom of 
the Opera" star Robert Guillaume. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the veterans remembered during the show how, like dePasse, they 
struggled to find black role models in the arts when they were growing up, 
while the younger performers expressed their appreciation for the 
groundbreaking done in the past. In fact, the most thrilling moments may have 
been the Jackson (Miss.) State University marching band opening the show with 
dynamic versions of several Motown hits, and the Soul Children of Chicago's 
uplifting gospel numbers. 
</P>
<P>
A typical point was made by Damon and Keenan Ivory Wayans introducing a segment 
about television. Noting that 30 years ago TV Guide ran an article titled "What 
Does the Negro Want From TV?" Damon ad libbed a little from his script, saying, 
"He wants the same thing in 1990: to be on it . . . and get paid!" 
</P>
<P>
Television provided as much of an anchor for the show as music, with 
actor-director Robert Townsend ("Hollywood Shuffle") starring in a series of 
skits dealing with black television: Nat King Cole's 15-minute weekly show in 
1957, Bill Cosby in "I Spy" in 1968, "Soul Train" in 1972. For 1983, it was the 
"Motown 25" special itself, leading into a live re-creation of the 
Temptations-Four Tops medley from that show. 
</P>
<P>
As much fun as that medley was, it made the point that in 1983 Motown had a 
sense of renewal. In 1990, it's mostly memories. Even Motown's current teen 
group the Boys, in an energetic, accomplished spot, belabored its debt to and 
worship of the Jackson 5. 
</P>
<P>
And in seven years, when they do "Motown 35," nothing from this show will be 
looked back on like the Michael and Marvin moments from the past.

WORLD SERIES A 4-BAGGER FOR CBS

Viewers in about 19.9 million homes were watching Saturday as the Cincinnati 
Reds swept the Oakland A's out of the World Series. According to figures 
released Tuesday by the A. C. Nielsen Co., that ranked as the second 
most-watched program of the week -- right behind Game 2 of the baseball 
championships, which attracted about 400,000 more households. 
</P>
<P>
With games 1 and 3 also ranking among the week's top six programs, CBS handily 
beat rivals NBC and ABC in the prime-time ratings race and closed to within 
two-tenths of a point of front-runner NBC in the season-to-date derby. NBC, 
meanwhile, did well with its two first-run Danielle Steele movies: 
"Kaleidoscope" ranked fourth and "Fine Things" was 10th. The full list of 
ratings is on Page 12. 
</P>
<P>
* One month into the fall TV season, "L.A. Law" fans had begun to wonder if 
maybe the producers hadn't taken their lastest Emmy Award for TV's best drama 
series and set sail for Tahiti. Nonetheless, they turned out when the show 
finally returned last Thursday. The program won its time slot, attracting 
viewers in about 15.7 million homes. CBS' "Knots Landing" drew about 11.8 
million and ABC's "PrimeTime Live" got about 8.2 million.

Soon to Be Back in the Saddle: Roy Rogers, "the king of the cowboys," is 
recovering from surgery to correct an aneurysm near his heart. 
</P>
<P>
The singing cowboy movie and television star, who will be 79 on Nov. 5, had the 
operation Monday at a hospital in Apple Valley, and was doing fine after the 
surgery, his son Roy Jr. said. Rogers underwent triple-bypass surgery 13 years 
ago. Riding a golden palomino named Trigger and strumming on a guitar, Rogers 
rode off into the sunsets of some 90 musical Westerns in a career that spanned 
more than 30 years. CLAUDIA PUIG

The Fullerton Civic Light Opera Company's "The Wizard of Oz" is so enamored of 
the movie version, the 1939 fairy tale turned American institution, that it's 
really a little beside itself. 
</P>
<P>
While ably performed, this production never goes out on its own, happy instead 
to give a live reflection of the film's beloved (and kitschy) moments. Calling 
this show derivative is an understatement -- director Jan Duncan and 
choreographer Sha NewmanQ duplicate the style and many of the moves they've 
seen on the big screen, and most of their actors are pleased to impersonate the 
stars, from Judy Garland to Bert Lahr. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's enough (children will probably enjoy all the big-eyed, broad 
performances and Popsicle-colored visuals; parents may find it all too 
precious), but you do yearn for more invention. "The Wizard of Oz" seems to 
present such opportunities, so it's disappointing when the inspiration is so 
grounded in what has come before. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Duncan thinks that it's wrong to tamper with a classic or worries that 
any new romping would go against the audience's expectations. Whatever, she 
does present the key moments in generally amusing ways, although we know 
exactly what's coming and, after a while, how it's all going to be presented. 
</P>
<P>
The pace often toddles, but the fairly elaborate set changes (Ed Gallagher's 
scenery is not expensive-looking, but it is bright and vaguely hallucinatory), 
Mela Hoyt-Heydon's bold costumes, the flying witches and steady handling of 
Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg's well-known score can give pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of not taking enough chances, there's really nothing to fault the cast 
with. Rita Baretta presents a pretty, girlish Dorothy done up in gingham and 
pigtails. Her singing is also pretty; she doesn't disappoint on "Over the 
Rainbow." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Fletcher as the Scarecrow, Randy Gianetti as the Tin Man and Daniel 
Halkyard as the Cowardly Lion are pleasing as well, with comfortable voices and 
characterizations. In heavy makeup, Polly Seale looks and sounds just like 
Margaret Hamilton's original Wicked Witch of the West. Ray Erlenborn's Wizard 
is an appropriately pompous bumbler. 
</P>
<P>
The show relies on many children, who have been well rehearsed by Duncan. One 
of the best scenes is reserved for the handful who play the Munchkins. They too 
mimic their movie counterparts but do so with such earnestness that you can't 
help but smile. 
</P>

MA AND KAHANE AT MUSIC CENTER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An event was clearly in the offing Monday at the Music Center as a large crowd 
strolled in the plaza and queued for cellist Yo-Yo Ma's recital. That chamber 
music could create such a stir is heartening indeed. 
</P>
<P>
What transpired within the packed Dorothy Chandler Pavilion was more heartening 
still, for Ma's rapport with his audience is achieved through a combination of 
total musicianship and a friendly stage presence. 
</P>
<P>
The cellist's choice of keyboard partners is likewise impossible to fault. On 
this occasion it was pianist Jeffrey Kahane, who proved both a consistently 
complementary collaborator. 
</P>
<P>
The first two works on the program, both by Beethoven, were in fact the 
pianist's show: the bubbly variations on Mozart's "Bei Mannern welche Liebe 
fuhlen" and his mighty Sonata in C, Opus 102. In both, Kahane provided 
animation, fluency and power, as well as a keen appreciation for his partner's 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing Shostakovich Sonata, the players meshed flawlessly, with Ma the 
sweetly sad singer and Kahane projecting just enough of the requisite acerbity. 
</P>
<P>
Whether in its original form or in the alternative editions for cello or flute 
and piano, the Franck Violin Sonata has been worked to death and deserves a 
rest. And from Ma's swooningly lush, shudderingly vibratoed reading one could 
suspect him of overcompensating for its familiarity by overperforming. HERBERT 
GLASS

BRASILJAZZ COVERS TWO CONTINENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It took Brasiljazz exactly one song to leave its adopted Latin roots and move 
to fertile American jazz soil with a Charlie Parker-inspired rendition of Cole 
Porter's "I Get a Kick Out of You" Monday night at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
On the third tune, it was back to Brazil. And so it went for most of the 
hourlong opening set by this most interesting trio composed of singer Kevyn 
Lettau, guitarist Peter Sprague and percussionist Michael Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
Just about everything about this group without bass or keyboard was far 
different from the norm, and just about everything worked to the group's 
advantage. Singer Lettau displayed a beautiful soprano that benefited from the 
sparse sound created by her cohorts. Whether funky in a voice-and-drums 
recitation of "Secret Code," a Latin-tinged tune composed by Sprague and 
herself, or deliciously sultry in the ballad "Stairway to the Stars," Lettau 
showed experience well beyond her obvious youth. 
</P>
<P>
That same sense of accomplishment was evident in Sprague's consistently musical 
accompaniment. A brilliant technician, the guitarist deftly backed Lettau with 
finely constructed harmonies and spurred the action with inventive stretches of 
improvised melody. 
</P>
<P>
As a songwriter, he has come up with some gems, particularly in "Words and 
Music," a delightful tune that expressed his own view of music's magical 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
The trio's great sense of dynamics was most impressive, with drummer Shapiro 
demonstrating that powerful percussion need not be loud. His use of various 
bells and whistles, along with brushes and hands on his oddly tuned kit, were 
wonderfully effective. 
</P>
<P>
Though the group had a certain affinity for Latin inclusions that left one 
wanting more, it would have been a shame to remain in the South American vein 
and deprive the audience of such rarely heard tunes as "All I Want" and "I'm 
Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter." For Brasiljazz, which appears 
Saturday night at Lunaria's, eclecticism works just fine. A. JAMES LISKA

NEW ROSE QUEEN QUICKLY FACES A COMPOSURE TEST 
</P>

<P>
Seconds after being named Tuesday to preside over the 1991 Tournament of Roses 
parade, Cara Payton Rullman, 17, faced her first test of composure as Rose 
Queen. 
</P>
<P>
As the other six Rose Court finalists clustered around Rullman to congratulate 
her, finalist Tisha Mei-Lin Kong -- apparently overcome by the emotions of the 
moment -- fainted in Rullman's arms. 
</P>
<P>
( 
</P>
<P>
"What do we do now?" Rullman said. "This wasn't rehearsed." 
</P>
<P>
But Kong recovered quickly and a smiling, yet startled, Rullman calmly turned 
around to pose for photographers. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony -- with its small moment of drama -- capped a month of competition 
among more than 700 San Gabriel Valley girls who vied for the title of the 73rd 
Rose Queen. Rullman, a San Marino High School senior and member of the varsity 
cheering squad, was selected to lead the 101st Rose Parade on New Year's day. 
</P>
<P>
The parade theme, "Fun 'n' Games," mirrored the lighthearted approach with 
which Rullman entered the contest. About 35 of her San Marino friends competed, 
including Kong, a friend since the fourth grade, Rullman said. 
</P>
<P>
Rullman lives in San Marino with her father, George; her mother, Linda; her 
19-year-old sister, Courtney, and 12-year-old brother, Chas. 
</P>
<P>
Rullman said she hopes to pursue a college degree in early childhood education. 
</P>
<P>
For now, she wants to catch up on schoolwork missed during the weeks of Rose 
Queen competition. 
</P>
<P>
Rullman also planned to visit her brother, hospitalized after a weekend 
accident in the San Gabriel Mountains. He broke his wrist on a Boy Scout hike. 
</P>
<P>
"He was supposed to be here today and he has been at all the other events," 
Rullman said. "I've been thinking about him a lot."

JUDGE SLAPS GAG ORDER ON TRIAL OF 7 DEPUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal judge in the money-skimming trial of seven Los Angeles County 
sheriff's narcotics officers Tuesday clamped a gag order on participants after 
a defense attorney persisted in linking the case to allegations that drug money 
was used to fund Central Intelligence Agency operations. 
</P>
<P>
Harland Braun, who represents Deputy Daniel M. Garner, had told reporters -- 
without providing evidence -- that the U.S. government was laundering drug 
money for South American cartels and siphoning some of the cash for its own 
clandestine operations abroad. 
</P>
<P>
In contesting an attempt by prosecutors to restrain himself and others from 
talking to the media, Braun has claimed in court papers that in 1986 his client 
searched the Southern California home of a CIA agent who had ties to a major 
drug- and money-laundering ring. 
</P>
<P>
According to Braun, the unnamed suspect acknowledged that he was a CIA agent 
and the narcotics officers discovered "numerous documents indicating that drug 
money was being used to purchase military equipment for Central America." In 
particular, he said, deputies found links to the funding of Contra rebels 
fighting the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after deputies seized the documents and booked the material as 
evidence, however, federal agents "swooped down" on the Sheriff's Department 
headquarters and removed the recovered property, as well as other records of 
the search and seizure, Braun said. 
</P>
<P>
One officer who was at the search scene with Garner, but asked not to be 
identified, told The Times that the suspect asked the deputies if he could make 
a phone call to his CIA contact in Virginia. He purportedly was allowed to make 
the call. 
</P>
<P>
"It was strange, because here we are chasing this drug dealer and we end up 
with this guy," said the officer, who added that the man was not arrested 
because no drugs were found at his home. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Earnest, a CIA spokesman in Washington, said the agency's policy was not 
to comment on anything under litigation. However, without commenting 
specifically on the allegations contained in Braun's affidavit, Earnest added: 
"The CIA has not and has never been directly involved in laundering drug 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Undersheriff Robert Edmonds called the assertions "preposterous" and said 
Tuesday he was unaware of either the 1986 case or Braun's version of events. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to tell you that I would be startled if federal agents swooped down 
on one of our stations and I wasn't aware of it," Edmonds said. "I would be 
rather astounded if this has any credibility in fact." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie, who is presiding over the trial of Garner 
and six other narcotics officers, chastised Braun for raising the matter in 
opposing the gag order. 
</P>
<P>
In seeking the restraining order, federal prosecutors claimed defense attorneys 
were making prejudicial comments about the case in which the narcotics officers 
are accused of skimming $1.4 million in drug money, evading taxes and various 
other charges. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors singled out Braun's comments about the alleged CIA connection with 
laundered drug money and Nicaraguan Contra rebels as irrelevant to the case and 
a subject that "will serve only to confuse the jury and waste time." 
</P>
<P>
Rafeedie also suggested that the allegation was irrelevant and said he had been 
uncertain whether to grant the gag order until he read Braun's legal brief, 
which he described as a ruse to get the CIA story before the media. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if everything you say in the document is true, it has nothing to do with 
whether your client has filed a false income tax return or has (unexplained) 
expenditures," Rafeedie said. 
</P>
<P>
In his court document, Braun maintained that the CIA agent questioned by 
deputies had ties to "the Blandon family which was importing narcotics from 
Central America to the United States." He did not identify the family further. 
</P>
<P>
In his court filing, Braun said that he had asked for -- and never received -- 
a letter from federal officials stating explicitly that no drug money was used 
by the U.S. government or any government agency to purchase weapons for the 
Contras or for weapons to be traded for hostages in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas A. Hagemann, one of the prosecutors in the 
deputies' trial, would not comment directly on the allegations. But in his own 
court papers, Hagemann said prosecutors would seek to exclude court testimony 
about "any alleged CIA plot." 
</P>
<P>
"Such matters are entirely extraneous to this case and would be nothing more 
than a 'smoke screen' to divert the jury's attention from the issues which are 
properly before it," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Garner and some of the other deputies on trial have said that, as part of their 
job, they sometimes worked with federal agencies on money-laundering cases that 
would actually send drug money back to the cartels as part of the undercover 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving tips from informants that large sums of money needed to be 
laundered, federal agents would alert local undercover operatives such as 
sheriff's narcotics deputies who would pose as money launderers and meet the 
drug trafficker's representative, they said. After turning the money over to 
federal officials -- who would actually launder it -- other deputies would 
follow the trafficker in hopes of uncovering more of his drug operation. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying Tuesday, Robert R. Sobel, a former sheriff's sergeant and the 
prosecution's chief witness, said his deputies were told by federal agents 
whether to follow a money courier, seize the cash or arrange for the money to 
be laundered by federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"And to keep up the credibility of the informant, they would launder money back 
to the cartel?" Braun asked. 
</P>
<P>
"That's right," Sobel replied.

FIRE REPORT SAYS HOMES WERE LEFT UNGUARDED; 
</P>
<P>
GLENDALE: THE DECISION TO SACRIFICE A CANYON MAY HAVE COST 20 HOUSES BUT HELPED 
SAVE 700 ELSEWHERE, FIRE DEPARTMENT ANALYSTS CONCLUDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Glendale firefighters deliberately left a neighborhood unprotected for two 
hours to halt the advance on another front of a fast-moving brush fire that 
damaged or destroyed 64 houses last June, including more than 20 in the 
unprotected canyon neighborhood, according to a long-awaited report by the city 
Fire Department released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The report, the only official analysis to be conducted of the devasting blaze, 
acknowledges that the department's communications system was overtaxed and that 
firefighting resources were "stretched to a critical level" because three other 
Southern California fires also broke out that day -- June 27. 
</P>
<P>
But despite loud complaints from residents about the way the firefighting was 
conducted, Glendale Fire Chief John M. Montenero defended the strategy, calling 
it "the best possible approach." 
</P>
<P>
The fire, described as Glendale's worst, erupted about 3:24 p.m. in the 1100 
block of Verdugo Road, apparently after an arsonist tossed an incendiary device 
into the bone-dry hillside area. Driven by strong winds, the fire was contained 
in 3 1/2 hours after cutting a "serpentine" path through three neighborhoods, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The two-volume document, compiled by Fire Department personnel, analyzed the 
firefighting tactics and made recommendations aimed at reducing the risk of 
future hillside blazes. It answered some questions raised by angry fire 
victims, but left others unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the Glendale Homeowners Coordinating Council, fearing the Fire 
Department's report would not be impartial, asked the state fire marshal and 
the state attorney general to conduct an independent probe. But the state 
officials refused, saying the matter was outside their jurisdiction. So the 
report stands as the only official post-mortem. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Glenmore Canyon, where more than 20 houses were damaged or 
destroyed, have been particularly critical, charging that their neighborhood 
was left to burn while fire crews converged on other areas. The report conceded 
that the neighborhood was neglected because firefighters concentrated their 
efforts just ahead of the fire's eastern edge to keep it from burning into 
Pasadena, saving more than 700 houses. 
</P>
<P>
But because of this strategy, the report said, "areas including Glenmore Canyon 
were devoid of firefighting resources for approximately two hours into the 
incident." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Leimeter, who lost her Glenmore Canyon home, said Tuesday she was not 
satisfied with this explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand their decision in wanting to save those other houses," she 
said. "But I don't understand their decision to write us off before the fire 
had even crossed the Glendale Freeway. I'm paying taxes to be protected." 
</P>
<P>
At a Tuesday afternoon news conference on the report, City Manager David 
Ramsay, defended the department's strategy in Glenmore Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a war out there and they simply had to make some very tough judgment 
calls," said Ramsay. "They had to make a decision on stopping this fire. They 
had to get ahead of it. They did that." 
</P>
<P>
"The combination of hot, dry weather; wood roofs; structures built close to the 
edge of the hill; and a wind . . . with gusts up to 25 knots, (created) a fire 
of such major proportion that it quickly overwhelmed the resources of the 
entire Glendale Fire Department . . .," " the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The mutual aid system, in which neighboring agencies send firefighters, was 
stretched critically thin because of demands for help with the Santa Barbara, 
Carbon Canyon and Altadena fires, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The report also said fire damage was much less than the original estimate of 
$50 million. The revised figures were $15 million in insured losses and $4 
million in uninsured losses. Sixty-four houses were damaged or destroyed, not 
66, as originally reported. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce losses in future fires, the report recommends that top fire officials 
receive more training in working with other agencies. It also states that the 
Verdugo communications system is undergoing a review aimed in part at 
preventing the "system overload" that occurred during the June 27 fire. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials discussed the report Tuesday night at a community meeting that 
drew about 40 people, including homeowner association leaders and fire victims. 
Some residents who used hoses to protect their homes complained that police 
officers forced them to leave even though there were no firefighters in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Other residents suggested that the city purchase a water-dropping helicopter, 
because it took an hour for aircraft from neighboring departments to arrive. 
Still others suggested the city train volunteers to supplement its professional 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
Montenero said he would look into the suggestions and complaints.

It was big news in Valley Center when, just a few weeks ago, the first traffic 
light was installed along the main drag. 
</P>
<P>
It was a symbol, literally, of a little town growing up and of the debate now 
taking place among townsfolk about the area's future. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County Board of Supervisors today will decide how much growth 
will be permitted in Valley Center while still preserving the rural ambience of 
the small community northeast of Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
The town's dominating faction wants significantly fewer homes built than were 
allowed in a 1984 community plan. Others, though, say more homes -- and 
businesses -- are needed to ensure the town's integrity. 
</P>
<P>
Many people move to Valley Center because they are smitten by country living 
and horizons marked by ridgelines, not rooftops. Homes are on minimum 2-acre or 
4-acre lots. There's no big business here, no grocery store, no shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those people fear that the county wants to transform Valley Center into 
-- egads! -- Uptown Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
They fear that Escondido's Valley Parkway, with its retail stores and 
apartments and mobile home parks, will snake up the grade to the northeast and 
keep flowing right down Valley Center Road like some awful run-on sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Others say Valley Center must expand its commercial base and housing 
opportunities, or else the town is destined to become too elite for senior 
citizens or low-income families, and the rural residents will continue to have 
to motor to Escondido for most of their services and goods. 
</P>
<P>
Given those two opposing visions for Valley Center's future, county supervisors 
today will be asked to adopt a new community plan that will guide Valley 
Center's residential and commercial growth for the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
But this bureaucratic exercise comes with a twist. The advisory Valley Center 
community planning group has proposed a growth plan that dramatically reduces 
previously planned residential development and resists commercial retail 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
The planning group, dominated by a slate of slow-growth champions elected two 
years ago, wants two relatively high-density residential and commercial 
neighborhoods, or "country towns," developed along Valley Center Road -- one at 
Woods Valley Road, the other about 4 miles away at Cole Grade Road. In those 
areas, homes could be built on lots as small as a half-acre -- if and when 
sewers are brought to Valley Center to serve them. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County Planning Commission and the county's own planning staff 
agreed with the thrust of the new plan. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisor Brian Bilbray, who represents South County, sees a different 
future for Valley Center. 
</P>
<P>
He argues for greater commercial and residential growth along Valley Center 
Road -- a "linkage" between the two town centers reflecting more intense land 
uses. 
</P>
<P>
"To think there will be low-density residential along Valley Center Road 
between those two nodes is to stick your head in the sand," he says. "Dynamics 
will be created along that road." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Valley Center's 1984 community plan called for some frontage property 
along the road to be zoned for as many as 7.4 homes per acre -- not urban 
density but, nonetheless, 15 times more homes per acre than is now allowed 
along the two-lane highway. 
</P>
<P>
That plan called for a 2,337-acre country town, contrasted with the current 
proposal for two smaller ones totaling just 662 acres. More telling, the old 
plan called for as many as 3,800 homes within the country town boundaries; the 
new one calls for a maximum of 485. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 plan assumed that the center of Valley Center would be served by 
sewers. The town is now served exclusively by septic tanks -- and because of 
high ground water, a moratorium was issued in 1980 on any new development in 
the center of town because the ground couldn't handle any more sewage 
percolation from leach lines. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Valley Center water district officials, armed with a large federal 
grant that would have picked up most of the tab, were ready to bring in sewers. 
But strong opposition surfaced, a public vote was conducted and the sewers were 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
To this day, the building moratorium remains in place, there has been no new 
growth in the central part of Valley Center, and the debate about the benefits 
and liabilities of sewers continues. 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray and others say those sewers are inevitable, and want a community plan 
developed that will allow a greater number of homes, once the sewers are 
installed, as well as more commercial businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray is not without local support. 
</P>
<P>
Local egg rancher George Armstrong, who served on the Valley Center planning 
group for 19 years and championed the 1984 growth plan, said commercial and 
residential growth needs to be better concentrated along Valley Center Road in 
order to preserve the rural settings farther out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he says, without higher-density -- and less expensive, and 
easier-to-maintain -- housing, "the seniors who live in Valley Center are going 
to be squeezed out. And that's 39% of our population base" of about 12,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"And there's no way for young families to afford 2-acre estates up here," he 
said. "I'd personally be better off if no one moved up here, because chickens 
and houses are not very compatible. But we have to realize what's necessary to 
make a good, well-balanced community." 
</P>
<P>
Realtor Alan Dorris agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"I can make a fine living either way -- whether I sell 10 $500,000 homes or 50 
$100,000 homes," he said. "But I don't want to just sell upscale, Rancho Santa 
Fe-type properties in Valley Center. I want a complete community that 
represents the entire population. I don't want to see an elitist-type town." 
</P>
<P>
Ted Marioncelli agrees, too. A former aide to Supervisor John MacDonald, 
Marioncelli now consults for developers, including one who wants to build in 
Valley Center -- and whose plans are in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the 10-year-old sewer moratorium, there's a pent-up demand (to 
grow) in Valley Center. You can live there and enjoy the rural life -- and 
drive to work somewhere else. Well, I don't see the kinds of development that's 
being proposed out there jeopardizing that life style. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, it will enhance it. These developments can bring in horse trails, 
golf courses, public parks -- the kinds of amenities that Valley Center 
wouldn't otherwise get," Marioncelli contended. 
</P>
<P>
The counter arguments are offered by the likes of Kevin Mahan, an attorney who 
serves as chairman of the Valley Center planning group; Craig Johnson, who 
spearheaded the opposition to sewers, and Lynn Leichtfuss, a Valley Center 
resident who also serves as chairman of the county Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"There are maybe 300 people in Valley Center who are in favor of high density, 
high growth and strip commercial -- the people who own the businesses along 
Valley Center Road and the landowners who hope to get tremendous returns on 
their property," said Mahan. "But I look at Valley Center like living in a 
Norman Rockwell painting, and (the 1984 growth plan) would destroy that, maybe 
not this year or next but in the next five or 10. You wouldn't recognize this 
place. It would be like living in an elevated Escondido." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said: "Bilbray is operating on a system of mediocrity, in trying to 
make sure each community is numerically responsible in terms of regional 
planning. People move here in order to not live where they work. Why take that 
from us? It's not that we're elitists, but we do believe we have a right to a 
rural community somewhere in this county. Bilbray would have the entire county 
bulldozed." 
</P>
<P>
Said Leichtfuss: "It's very difficult for me to understand, when you have three 
bodies in concert, working to develop a plan and being in agreement, that one 
supervisor can try to throw a wrench in the works and cause a good deal of 
confusion and animosity in the community. The mechanics, and the notion of 
democratic representation, seem to have broken down." 
</P>
<P>
She said she has no conceptual problem with two separated country town centers. 
"That makes perfect sense for rural living," she said. "Let's use some 
ingenuity." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, John MacDonald -- whose district includes Valley Center -- is 
withholding comment because "not all the evidence is on the table," said his 
chief of staff, Nancy Allen. 
</P>
<P>
"But he's very concerned about a strip-commercial atmosphere. We don't want 
Valley Center covered in neon," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One option to pursue, she suggested, is a mixed commercial-residential use 
along Valley Center Road, allowing small businesses to operate with persons 
living upstairs, something akin to an artist's loft. 
</P>
<P>
"Valley Center doesn't have too much commercial now, but, on the other hand, 
there's not much existing base to support it," Allen said. "You probably won't 
find a supermarket in Valley Center for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"People who move to Valley Center don't anticipate having all those kinds of 
amenities. When they move out there, it's with the understanding they'll have 
to drive down the hill (into Escondido) for that." 
</P>
<P>
Are developers licking their chops to develop Valley Center? "Well, I overheard 
a conversation in the hallway the other day," Allen offered. "A developer was 
saying, 'There's land out there screaming, Grade me! Grade me!' "

BILL BOYARSKY: TERM LIMITS: ADVANTAGE FOR THE GOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democrat Dick Floyd's Assembly district has a peculiar shape to it, like the 
front half of a horse. 
</P>
<P>
The torso rests awkwardly along Pacific Coast Highway, near Wilmington. The 
head reaches several miles northwest to around Hawthorne, pointed in the 
general direction of Hollywood Park race track. 
</P>
<P>
I'm telling you about this oddly shaped district because it illustrates an 
important, but little-discussed, side effect of a pair of term-limit proposals 
on the Nov. 6 ballot, Propositions 131 and 140. District boundaries are drawn 
by the politicians and for the politicians -- or, to be more precise, by and 
for the politicians in power. 
</P>
<P>
Voter approval of term limits eventually will topple the existing Sacramento 
power structure. Depending on your party preference, the measures can be 
described as either boosting Republican efforts to take control of the 
Legislature or breaking a Democratic stranglehold on the Statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
I know that's not part of the term-limit debate. Proponents are shouting 
reform, not partisan advantage. But I've talked to political scientists and 
politicians and they agree that term-limit approval would help the GOP win 
legislative elections. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Floyd's district shows how it would work. 
</P>
<P>
As they began the 1981 legislative reapportionment, Democratic Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown and other Democratic powers faced an unpleasant political reality. 
The state was becoming more Republican. While the governor, Jerry Brown, was 
Democratic, the party's registration edge was shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
And so, as politicians do, they fell back on the technique devised during the 
early 19th Century Administration of Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge Gerry, when 
party leaders gained political advantage by drawing a district in the shape of 
a salamander. It came to be called a gerrymander. 
</P>
<P>
In Floyd's 53rd District, widely separated working-class neighborhoods in 
Carson, Gardena, Lawndale and Hawthorne were bundled together. The boundaries 
had no relation to neighborhoods or communities. The lines simply followed 
Democratic registration in a free-flow manner, creating a district where 60% of 
the voters would be Democrats. Rather than a salamander, they produced the 
front end of a horse -- a fortunate outcome, given the alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to popular belief, such gerrymandering doesn't automatically produce 
victory in California. That's because the state has an element known as The 
Disloyal Democrats. These are Democrat constituents who often don't vote along 
party lines. 
</P>
<P>
You counter disloyalty and shrinking party registration by finding candidates 
who appeal to local tastes. Hometown heroes, so to speak. In Floyd, the 
Democrats found someone perfect for this Joe Sixpack district. 
</P>
<P>
Rebellious and irate, union man Floyd is the guy who'd tell the foreman to take 
that job and shove it. But the foreman probably wouldn't fire him. For Floyd's 
also a jokester, the kind of legislator who wanders the Assembly floor sharing 
stories with his colleagues and shouting wisecracks across the room. 
</P>
<P>
As long as he keeps telling stories -- and telling off the bosses -- Floyd has 
a job. 
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of local heroes like Floyd among Southland Democrats. They can 
be found from Riverside to Long Beach. You can tell the local heroes by the way 
they always outstrip Democratic presidential candidates in their districts. 
</P>
<P>
Their entrenched presence, combined with the gerrymandering, gives the 
Democrats a huge advantage regardless of how the nation might be tilting 
politically at the time. 
</P>
<P>
So for the Republicans, the only way out is to get rid of the locals and 
everyone else, and start fresh: Term limits. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans compare the present situation to playing football on a field that 
runs uphill. Trying to remedy the situation, they've backed voter initiatives 
to take reapportionment out of the hands of the Legislature. But the measures 
have been defeated. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's winning the governorship would help. He could veto the Democrat's 
once-a-decade reapportionment bill. 
</P>
<P>
But the Republicans' real hope is getting rid of incumbents like Dick Floyd. 
Then, when the Republicans win the Legislature, they can do their own 
gerrymander. 
</P>
<P>
That's a strong reason for Republicans to like term limits. That support was 
clear last Friday when I was on a panel interviewing Vice President Dan Quayle 
on a cable talk show. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle invoked the image of the team forced to play uphill. Asked about the 
advantages a term limit would have for the GOP, he said "It would level the 
playing field." 
</P>
<P>
A level playing field for the Republicans, political death for Dick Floyd -- 
and, quite possibly, for the Democrats' decades of majority rule.

RTD run-around? 
</P>
<P>
A Montclair man's bus didn't show as scheduled downtown at 3:30 p.m. In fact, 
it didn't show at all -- a clear test of the RTD's new guarantee of a free ride 
for anyone whose bus is 15 minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
The next bus on the line pulled up at City Hall at 3:50. The man asked the 
driver to stamp his monthly pass, entitling him to a freebie. 
</P>
<P>
The driver said: "I'm not late, I'm on time. I don't have to stamp anything." 
</P>
<P>
Two other passengers told the Montclair man they had been caught in the same 
vicious circle on other days. 
</P>
<P>
What gives? RTD spokesman Anthony Greno said the driver was technically 
correct. But any such passenger can receive compensation by phoning RTD 
Customer Relations at 972-6235. 
</P>
<P>
Or taking the bus over to RTD headquarters.

A Woody Woodpecker character appeared before the county Board of Supervisors 
Tuesday and was christened official mascot of the county's recycling program, a 
clear override of Only in L.A.'s veto attempt. We had pointed out in a previous 
column that woodpeckers can cause great damage to trees. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the supervisors ignore us, but we were taken to task by a Woodland 
Hills resident who asserted that it was "a sad statement of our times that a 
world-famous fictional character" would be compared "to its live counterpart."

She asked whether we should also "abandon such enduring symbols" as Smokey the 
Bear because "bears ravage campgrounds and attack people."

BRANDO'S DAUGHTER NOT EXPECTED TO TESTIFY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors trying Marlon Brando's son for murder said Tuesday they probably 
will fail in bringing the actor's daughter back to California in time to 
testify against her half-brother. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing Tuesday in Santa Monica, a judge ordered jury selection to begin 
Nov. 5 in Christian Brando's first-degree murder trial in the shooting death of 
his half-sister's boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office has sought for months to return Cheyenne Brando 
from Tahiti. "We're not really overly optimistic it will happen," said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. William Clark. "If we had a couple of years, we might be able to 
pull it off." 
</P>
<P>
She flew to Tahiti shortly after the May 16 death of her Tahitian boyfriend, 
Dag Drollet, who was killed at her father's mountaintop estate. Cheyenne gave 
birth in June to Drollet's child. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Brando, 32, had admitted shooting Drollet, but contends the gun went 
off accidentally while struggling for the weapon with Drollet.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HUGE OIL RUNOFF INTO SANTA MONICA BAY FOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even though only eight inches of rain fell on the greater Los Angeles area in 
1989, storm drain runoff carried more than 4.4 million pounds of oil and grease 
into Santa Monica Bay, according to a study released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got the equivalent of a major oil spill going into Santa Monica Bay 
every year because of this runoff," said Diane Cameron, an official with the 
Natural Resources Defense Council, the environmental group that did the study. 
</P>
<P>
The study also estimated that more than 522,000 pounds of zinc, 11,100 pounds 
of cadmium and 152,000 pounds of lead were swept into the bay because of 
runoff. Those amounts are far greater than the amounts deposited by the area's 
two major sewage plants, the study concluded. The levels should be viewed as 
"rough estimates," Cameron said.

THREE FATAL INGLEWOOD SHOOTINGS PROMPT CALL FOR ANTI-GANG SUMMIT; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: COMMUNITY LEADERS CITE THE DEATHS OF LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AS 
EVIDENCE OF ESCALATING STREET VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The shooting deaths of three local high school students has prompted a call 
from Inglewood community leaders for an anti-gang summit to address an 
escalating level of street violence. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent incident was Sunday night, when seven teen-agers who had 
gathered on a street corner were sprayed with bullets by two gunmen across the 
street, killing two and injuring three others. 
</P>
<P>
The week before, a 17-year-old boy who had recently broken off ties with a 
local street gang was killed in a gang-related shooting. 
</P>
<P>
School board President Lois Hill-Hale said Tuesday that she will call for a 
gathering of community members at the board's meeting tonight to come up with a 
plan to address the violence. 
</P>
<P>
"This seems to be an escalating problem in the community," she said. "We have 
to map out a plan to prevent this from happening. Law enforcement cannot do it 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Luther Keith, pastor of the Central Baptist Church, planned a 
candlelight vigil next month "to reclaim our community from the gangs. . . . 
It's getting pretty rough. If we don't stand up and do something, it will get 
out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
School board member Joseph Rouzan, a former Inglewood police chief, added: 
"Unfortunately, I think this gang stuff is out of control. It's just 
unmanageable." 
</P>
<P>
Rouzan called for a meeting of city and school officials to coordinate strategy 
against the violence. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday the teen-agers were standing in the 10200 block of Crenshaw Boulevard 
about 11 p.m. when a car with its lights out pulled slowly past before parking 
across the street, according to witnesses and police. As many as 20 shots were 
then fired at the group by the two occupants of the car. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a deliberate ambush of these men by persons unknown," Police Sgt. 
Harold Moret said Tuesday. "It was a concerted effort meant to kill all of 
them. These shooters meant to kill them all." 
</P>
<P>
Moret declined to label the incident gang-related, pending completion of the 
police investigation. But friends of the victims and area gang members said the 
teen-agers were associated with the Crenshaw Mafia, an Inglewood gang connected 
to the Bloods. They said the word on the street was that an unknown set of 
rival Crips was responsible for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"It was Crips, and if we find out who did it we can't help but get our 
revenge," said a gang member who knew the teen-agers. "These guys were kids 
that hung out with us, innocent bystanders." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Malone, 16, a student at Morningside High School, died at the scene. Edgar 
Cole, 16, a former Morningside student, died Sunday night at an area hospital. 
School officials said a counselor had been working with both victims to steer 
them away from gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Two other victims remained hospitalized in stable condition, and another 
sustained a minor wound. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked out the window and I saw two boys laying right there," said area 
resident LaRonda Sims, 15. "One was moaning and the other was just laid out." 
</P>
<P>
She said her classmates at Morningside High were all talking about the 
shooting, which took place a few blocks from campus, on Monday. "Everybody knew 
about it," she said. "Everybody was crying and stuff." 
</P>
<P>
LaRonda said the group often hung out on the street "giving their little (gang) 
signs" to passing motorists. 
</P>
<P>
In the earlier incident, Norman Smith was riding home from a school dance in 
the back of a pickup truck on Oct. 13 when an unknown assailant fired at the 
truck with a shotgun after asking about the passengers' gang affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
Norman had broken off ties with the Inglewood Trece Demon Locos earlier this 
year, his family said.

MIKE DOWNEY: WHEN 2,000TH IS DOWN, THERE'S A LIFETIME TO GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hockey lovers probably won't remember forever where they were on the night 
Wayne Gretzky got his 2,000th point. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Gretzky is still so young that eventually we will all be witness 
to his 2,500th point. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And his 1,000th goal. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And his 3,000th point. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And his 1,500th goal. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And then that magical night around the year 2005 when Paulina Gretzky, just up 
from the juniors, joins her Dad on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
And then, oh, you know, everybody will start calling her the Even Greater 
Gretz, and she'll start scoring her own goals, and we'll start adding onto 
their NHL record for father-daughter points, and the good name of Gretzky will 
live on and on and on. 
</P>
<P>
The night the guy got his 2,000th point? 
</P>
<P>
Who'll remember? 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't send chills down the spines of Americans -- not the ones south of 
the Canadian border -- the way Henry Aaron's 715th home run did or Nolan Ryan's 
5,000th strikeout or Pete Rose's 4,192nd hit, partly because hockey is not this 
nation's national pastime, but partly because it's just another wonderful day 
here in Wayne's World. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky himself would just as soon get this latest milestone over with, so 
everybody can go back to concentrating on the rest of the hottest-thing-on-ice 
Kings, who beat the Calgary Flames, 6-4, Tuesday night at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Gretz got an assist on a Tony Granato goal 99 seconds -- yes, 99 seconds; this 
guy is spooky -- into the second period, giving him 1,998 points for his 
storybook career. 
</P>
<P>
And during the final two minutes, Gretzky spoon-fed a pass to Bob Kudelski for 
his 1,999th point -- yeah, nineteen ninety-nine -- and little Paulina, seated 
on her mommy's lap, really seemed to like it. 
</P>
<P>
This means the fresh prince of Inglewood will come up with the big Two Zero 
Zero Zero sometime this weekend in Winnipeg, which will be the biggest news 
event in Manitoba since a moose got loose in the general store. 
</P>
<P>
And Gretz will smile sheepishly and say he couldn't have done it without his 
teammates, and he will be sincere. Of course he couldn't have done it without 
2,000 sticks and 2,000 pucks, either, but that's the trouble with professional 
sports. Equipment never gets any credit. 
</P>
<P>
Next day, Gretzky will simply get started scoring his next 2,000 points, which 
should take him a little beyond the turn of the century, when hockey will be 
played on Astro-Ice with an aluminum puck. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne and his wife, Janet Jones, got comfy on Arsenio Hall's TV couch Monday 
night, and Janet said she really likes that new aluminum stick her husband has 
been using, because it gleams. 
</P>
<P>
Just for the record, so does her husband. 
</P>
<P>
And, further for the record, let's make sure that everybody knows what a 
distinguished achievement this 2,000th point is for the favorite son of 
Brantford, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
The next-leading scorer in hockey history is Gordie Howe, who scored 1,850 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky is 29. Gordie Howe, as most of us know, played until he was 
something like 65, then collected Social Security checks for a while, then came 
out of retirement and played until his 85th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
No, seriously . . . know how many more games Howe played than Gretzky? Nearly 
900 more, that's how many. 
</P>
<P>
The man played hockey before anybody even invented aluminum. He played a long, 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
And so did Marcel Dionne, who will have his number retired when the Kings 
return home Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Know how many points did Dionne score? He scored 1,771. Know how many more 
games Dionne played than Gretzky? Nearly 500 more, that's how many. 
</P>
<P>
Young as he is, Gretzky already has set NHL records for most assists, most 
games with three-or-more goals, most 100-point seasons, most career Stanley Cup 
points, most goals in one season, most assists in one season, most short-handed 
goals in a playoff game, most times making a tough shot look easy, most 
incredible passes by one man in a career, most fans who still can't believe 
their eyes, and, oh, you know. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Gretzky is out to get 200 points and take the Kings to the 
promised land. So far, it looks as though such goals could be both scored and 
accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
And the 2,000th point? 
</P>
<P>
People won't be talking about it for long. It won't have historic value. It 
won't be the stuff of legends. 
</P>
<P>
It'll just be another notch on the stick of a legend.

KINGS STAY HOT, WIN, 6-4; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: THEY MATCH THEIR BEST START IN CLUB HISTORY WITH VICTORY OVER FLAMES. 
GRETZKY RAISES POINT TOTAL TO 1,999.

<P>
They came to the Forum Tuesday night hoping to see history. 
</P>
<P>
And history they saw. 
</P>
<P>
No, it wasn't Wayne Gretzky's 2,000th point. That will have to wait for another 
night after Gretzky collected two assists to bring him to the brink with 1,999 
points. 
</P>
<P>
But two third-period goals by Bob Kudelski and one by Tomas Sandstrom enabled 
the Kings to beat the Calgary Flames, 6-4, and equal the best start in club 
history through nine games. 
</P>
<P>
The Smythe Division-leading Kings improved to 7-1-1, matching the record of the 
1980-81 team. Gretzky's second assist came with 1:26 to play. That brought what 
was left of the sellout crowd of 16,005 to its feet, roaring every time Gretzky 
got his stick on the puck. 
</P>
<P>
But, it was not to be. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little disappointed," Gretzky said. "I wanted to do it tonight. I have 
not had a big night here in L.A. The fans have been great to me, and it would 
have been nice to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Rob Blake, who was playing collegiate hockey at Bowling Green a year ago at 
this time, didn't have to be told he was in on history. 
</P>
<P>
"You could feel it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not Tony Granato. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth," said Granato, one of Gretzky's linemates, "I forgot 
about it. I didn't realize until they made the announcement he had his 1,999th 
point." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky missed two chances for a point in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Operating in a power play, he twice fed Granato, once in the crease and once in 
the slot. On both occasions, goalie Mike Vernon fell to his knees to make 
strong saves on Granato's shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little mad at myself that I didn't get in there and bury that one," 
said Granato of his first scoring opportunity on the power play. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames led, 1-0, at that point with a goal only 1:21 into the game. Al 
MacInnis, having skated around Gretzky into the right circle, fired a 30-foot 
slap shot from there that flew between goalie Daniel Berthiaume's pads. It was 
MacInnis' team-leading seventh goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Some fancy skating by Todd Elik tied it at 6:31 of the period. 
</P>
<P>
Elik skated around defenseman Ric Nattress, leaving him a clear shot at the 
goal. Elik then moved past Vernon to the right side of the net where he 
backhanded the puck past the goalie for his fifth goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings got a little help in taking the lead later in the period. 
</P>
<P>
John Tonelli, who has had a quiet start this season, made some noise by 
slamming the puck off Vernon in front of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
But the puck skidded to defenseman Tim Sweeney, whose momentum carried him 
toward the goal. Unable to stop, Sweeney inadvertently kicked the puck into the 
net with his right skate. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney got the score, but Tonelli got credit for his first goal and second 
point of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky got his only point of the night in the second period after taking a 
pass from Sandstrom, who had controlled the puck off the right boards. 
</P>
<P>
Sandstrom passed to Gretzky on the left. The Kings' center spotted Granato all 
alone ahead of two defensemen, like a wide receiver who has beaten the 
defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky got Granato the puck and Granato got his fourth goal of the season by 
scoring from about 15 feet out. That made it 3-1 at the 1:39 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Goals by Roger Johansson and Gary Suter tied it again, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the King's fifth in a row, surpassing last year's best winning 
streak. The club's unbeaten string stands at six. 
</P>
<P>
But when it was over, most players talked about Gretzky and the point that 
never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too bad it didn't happen," Sandstrom said. "I had a lot of chances. I 
should have had two or three goals. 
</P>
<P>
So it's on to Winnipeg where the Kings will open a six-game trip with games on 
Friday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to get it over with quickly," Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, Gretzky's total, already the best in NHL history, will stand at 
1,999. 
</P>
<P>
For No. 99, what could be more fitting? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tim Watters returned to the Kings' lineup after missing six games with bruised 
ribs. . . . The American national anthem was sung by Rev. George Simmonds, 
fulfilling a longtime fantasy at age 100.

PAY-PER-VIEW HAS AT LEAST AS MUCH AT STAKE AS BOXERS; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: IF VIEWERS BUY THE DOUGLAS-HOLYFIELD FIGHT, IT COULD SERVE AS A 
FORERUNNER FOR FUTURE PROMOTIONS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Steve Wynn is so smart, how could this be happening to him? 
</P>
<P>
He's going to hold a heavyweight championship fight at his Mirage hotel 
Thursday night, a fight that has a chance, because of pay-per-view television, 
to earn more money than any fight ever. 
</P>
<P>
It could also lose more money than any fight ever. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn, whose winning purse bid for the Buster Douglas-Evander Holyfield bout was 
$32.1 million, has packaged Douglas' first title defense in a unique 
pay-per-view promotion that, he says, may be a forerunner of future 
pay-per-view sports and entertainment shows. 
</P>
<P>
To start with, Wynn controls the telecast of this fight. Past major 
pay-per-view boxing events were sold to regional promoters around the country 
who, in turn, marketed the bout to local cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
A New York City pay-per-view distributor, Lou Falcigno, said Wynn is simply 
eliminating middlemen by producing his own telecast of Douglas-Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
"What he's doing is gaining back 10% of his pay-per-view income that would go 
to regional promoters," Falcigno said. "He'll lose money on the fight itself, 
but nothing like $10 million to $15 million, like some think. Steve wants to do 
this telecast himself, to see how it can work for him in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Said Wynn: "If we can do this well, if this telecast works and we show people 
in the entertainment world that the Mirage can be a major event center, then it 
carries enormous implications for my business, beyond boxing. 
</P>
<P>
"For proprietary reasons, I don't care to discuss what I have in mind beyond 
boxing, but let's just say pay-per-view has my complete attention these days." 
</P>
<P>
So in a sense, Douglas-Holyfield is an experiment, possibly a look at how 
Americans might be entertained in their own homes within a few years. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, get ready for (choose one): 
</P>
<P>
 -- One night with Bruce Springsteen at the Mirage ($49.95). 
</P>
<P>
 -- One night with Michael Jackson at the Mirage ($49.95). 
</P>
<P>
 -- One night with Frank Sinatra at the Mirage ($49.95). 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe Led Zeppelin -- there are strong rumors there. 
</P>
<P>
The number of cable television households in America, those with addressable 
systems -- the capability of ordering a pay-per-view telecast -- has grown to 
14.9 million, cable TV industry experts say. Historically, pay-per-view boxing 
and pro wrestling telecasts have attracted the most viewers, but that could 
change now. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Kagan Associates, Inc., a Carmel-based firm that publishes cable 
television industry newsletters, maintains a ranking of the top 76 grossing 
pay-per-view shows, and boxing and wrestling dominate the top of the list. Last 
year's Sugar Ray Leonard-Robert Duran fight at the Mirage was the 
highest-grossing pay-per-view show ever, at $27.3 million, although that figure 
is disputed by many in boxing. 
</P>
<P>
"The two highest-grossing PPV shows ever were Mike Tyson-Michael Spinks and Ray 
Leonard-Marvin Hagler," said Rick Kulis, a pay-per-view regional promoter of 
both those fights as well as many others. He's working for Wynn this time, 
marketing the Douglas-Holyfield telecast. 
</P>
<P>
Kulis added: "Both of them did about the same in PPV revenue, around $30 
million. This fight, we think, will be right up there with them. Remember, 
there are millions more cable households than there were for Hagler-Leonard." 
</P>
<P>
The pay-per-view numbers achieved with major boxing shows have by now caught 
the eye of everyone in the cable television and entertainment industries. 
</P>
<P>
"What Wynn is doing with this Douglas-Holyfield show is totally unique," said 
Doug Stewart, vice president of Denver-based United Artists Entertainment, one 
of the country's largest cable conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, the hotel is the exclusive owner of the telecast. Everyone 
in the cable industry will be watching how Wynn does on this, because the 
industry is starved for revenue-producing PPV shows." 
</P>
<P>
Why has boxing done so well on pay-per-view? 
</P>
<P>
"Because boxing is time and date specific," Stewart said. "It's a live event, 
it occurs on a specific date and will occur only once." 
</P>
<P>
So why have movies -- the average cable household orders an average of one 
pay-per-view movie every four months -- and rock concerts flop on pay-per-view? 
According to Paul Kagan Associates, Inc., the highest buy rate ever for a 
pay-per-view music show was a 2.2% by the Rolling Stones concert last December. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone who's ever promoted a PPV music show has blatantly violated all the 
reasons why boxing does well," Stewart said. "In the past, PPV rock concerts 
have been part of some group's tour. Leonard and Hagler fought only once. It 
was special. You can't say that about all the music shows that have been 
tried." 
</P>
<P>
Which is where Led Zeppelin comes in. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a big proponent of PPV music shows," Stewart added. "I think eventually 
music will be huge on PPV. There is a rumor in the cable industry now that Led 
Zeppelin will re-form and do a 50-concert tour. And there's talk that the last 
stop on the tour will be sold as a PPV show. 
</P>
<P>
"That won't work, in my opinion. What would work is if they do one, single 
concert, say from the Meadowlands, shown only on PPV, with no delayed telecast. 
Just one show. Figure it out. If one million households (out of 15 million) 
order it at $20 each, that's $20 million in one night." 
</P>
<P>
As for the fight itself, Wynn indicated this week that whatever he loses will 
be recouped in the Mirage casino. 
</P>
<P>
"The way the numbers add up right now is, worst-case scenario, I lose $3 
million, which is exactly what I lost on Leonard-Duran III, and that night we 
made $5 million in the casino," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another Las Vegas hotel executive, experienced in major boxing shows but who 
asked not to be identified, added up the estimated overhead for 
Douglas-Holyfield and projected revenues and showed an $8.5-million loss, even 
assuming a $15-million return from pay-per-view. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn has written bigger checks than he has written for this fight. He's paying 
magicians Siegfried and Roy $57.5 million for five years to perform three weeks 
out of every four. 
</P>
<P>
He is paying Douglas $24,075,000 -- $4 million of which has already been paid 
to rival promoter Don King for last summer's settlement of their lawsuits -- 
and $8,000,025 to Holyfield. Wynn projects at least a $9.5-million live gate 
sale at his 16,200-seat outdoor stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those tickets, priced from $200 to $1,000, were purchased by other Las 
Vegas casinos. Wynn sold the delayed telecast, to Showtime, and foreign TV 
rights for $5 million, and he expects to earn $1.5 million from closed-circuit 
rights and another $1 million from merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
The rainbow ends in the casino, however. There's a reason why this is a 
Thursday night fight. It means most of his high-roller casino customers are in 
the hotel Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. 
</P>
<P>
"People bet $100 million a month at the Mirage, and that's table games only," 
Wynn said. "Saturday is a big night. So with this fight on a Thursday, we in 
effect have four consecutive Saturday nights. We could do $60 million in those 
four days." 
</P>
<P>
Other casino executives in Las Vegas say a casino generally wins back 16% to 
20% of the "drop" -- the amount of money wagered in a casino. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those adding up Wynn's costs for the fight include the $3 million he'll 
spend in a national advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"We will spend that much," Wynn said, "but remember . . . I had a hotel 
advertising budget to begin with, before we made the fight." 
</P>
<P>
Wynn said he'd been looking for a major fight for the Mirage for which he could 
own the telecast. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched Tyson-Douglas at my home in Sun Valley," he said, "and when Buster 
knocked him out, I said, 'That's it, Douglas-Holyfield, there's my fight.' 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing like a heavyweight championship fight. If I put Frank Sinatra 
in my showroom, I get Sinatra fans. Same with Michael Jackson. But you hold a 
heavyweight championship fight, and you get people from all over the world, 
from Tokyo to Guadalajara. It transcends every socioeconomic barrier." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas-Holyfield would be history now were it not for a New York trial in 
which King and Douglas sued each other and then settled. When the fight was 
finally on track, Wynn brought in a major San Francisco advertising agency, Hal 
Riney and Partners, creators of the successful Bartles and Jaymes wine cooler 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Allen, an account executive with the firm, said: "Tom Tieche, our 
associate creative director, and I met in Steve's office on July 12 and, in 
talking the fight out, came up with the 'Moment of Truth' theme." 
</P>
<P>
"We designed a national campaign, in 110 markets, for TV, radio and newspapers. 
It was designed right down to the day of the fight, when full-page ads will 
appear in newspapers around the country." 
</P>
<P>
Later, the TV commercials were filmed at Johnny Tocco's Ringside Gym in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
For boxing, as well as any other pay-per-view-suitable show, the numbers grow 
to breathtaking levels. Las Vegas boxing promoter Bob Arum predicted a year ago 
that by the end of the 1990s, given the growth of pay-per-view in Japan and 
Europe, a major fight could gross $500 million. Falcigno said a pay-per-view 
Super Bowl could do a $320-million gross in the late 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
A key number in any pay-per-view projections is the buy rate, or the percentage 
of pay-per-view homes ordering a telecast. Leonard-Duran III last December, 
rated by Paul Kagan Associates, Inc., as the biggest pay-per-view show ever, 
had a 6.5% buy rate. The more available pay-per-view homes, the more the 
revenue -- providing the buy rate stays the same. 
</P>
<P>
In the days before a major pay-per-view boxing show, Kulis, Wynn's pay-per-view 
marketing chief, closely watches sales at a half-dozen major cable systems, 
which traditionally, he said, produce high sales rates for boxing shows. 
</P>
<P>
The six are Cox Cable of San Diego, with 270,000 homes; Cencom of Alhambra, 
130,000; Continental Cable of Los Angeles, 208,000; Brooklyn-Queens Cable of 
New York, 228,000; Garden State Cable of Garden City, N.J., 50,000; and 
Suburban Cablevision of East Orange, N.J., 102,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Those six generally will account for about 25% of all gross PPV revenue for a 
fight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Youngman, pay-per-view coordinator for Cox Cable of San Diego, said 
Douglas-Holyfield orders are running at a near-record pace. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we're way ahead of Leonard-Hearns (1989) and just a little behind 
Tyson-Spinks," he said. "Usually, 50% of the orders come in the last 24 hours, 
so if that holds up, we'll have an 8% buy rate and we'll be very happy with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Wynn sold a four-tiered pay-per-view deal to cable systems, with three of them 
carrying some risk to the system operators. But one of them, representing 3.8 
million households, calls for no risk to the cable systems, and a 70-30 split 
for the Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
"That's our favorite," Wynn said, "if this fight kicks in big, we win big on 
that deal." 
</P>
<P>
Closed-circuit telecasts, which steadily fade in significance as more homes are 
cabled, is still a winner in New York. Falcigno, the closed-circuit syndicator 
there, sold the fight to 96 restaurants, bars and private clubs for prices 
ranging from $1,000 to $20,000. At Mickey Mantle's Restaurant, for example, you 
get dinner for two and the fight for $135. 
</P>
<P>
Of reports that Wynn plans non-boxing pay-per-view PPV productions in the 
future from the Mirage, Ed Bleier, president of pay TV for Warner Bros., said 
he'll have to break new ground. 
</P>
<P>
"If he were to do a Led Zeppelin show, for example, I don't think it would work 
if it was just another concert on a tour. But if he were to do a one-night-only 
type of show, that's an entirely different matter." 
</P>
<P>
If within a decade or so, pay-per-view entertainment shows become routine 
viewing at home, it might be traced back to 1990, when a couple of heavyweights 
named Buster Douglas and Evander Holyfield paved the way.

IGWEBUIKE LINKED TO DRUG CASE;

PRO FOOTBALL: VIKING KICKER REPORTEDLY IS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR ALLEGED

Minnesota Viking kicker Donald Igwebuike is being investigated in connection 
with drug-smuggling allegations, ABC News reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
ABC reported that the U.S. attorney's office in Tampa, Fla., has "irrefutable 
evidence" linking Igwebuike to an attempt to smuggle heroin into the United 
States from his native Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
His name surfaced about two weeks ago when a Nigerian was arrested by customs 
agents at the Orlando, Fla., Airport, ABC said. The Nigerian, a school teacher, 
had 31 small bags of heroin in his stomach, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC report quoted law enforcement officials as saying that Igwebuike bought 
the alleged drug courier's ticket and participated in phone conversations that 
indicated he was aware of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Igwebuike worked out with the Vikings at their Eden Prairie practice facility 
Tuesday. ABC said he confirmed that he was the subject of an investigation, but 
wouldn't answer specific questions. Igwebuike told the reporter to talk to his 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by the Vikings, Igwebuike's attorney, Larry E. Reed, 
said he had listened to a recording of a telephone conversation between his 
client and the Nigerian teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"It was in the Nigerian language. I had it translated and there was no mention 
of drugs on the tape. I saw all the documents. I saw all the evidence and there 
is nothing to connect Donald to the case," Reed said. Reed did not respond to 
messages to call the Associated Press for further comment. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Customs officials obtained a search warrant Tuesday for Igwebuike's 
apartment in the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington, ABC said. Igwebuike, 29, 
spent five years with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before the Vikings signed him 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not been contacted by federal authorities. We have talked with Donald 
Igwebuike and his attorney about the matter. We have contacted the National 
Football League and they are looking into the allegations," the Vikings said in 
a prepared statement Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings said any decisions on Igwebuike's playing status would be made by 
the NFL.

The oral commitment given Duke by 6-foot-11 Marina High School center Cherokee

Too bad the Breeders' Cup and Santa Anita can't settle their differences. The

If there were only one race for 2-year-olds, filly Meadow Star would be 
favored. . . .

The huge entry list for the Classic means there are no superstars in the field.

</P>
<P>
However, the race would have been a genuine classic if injuries hadn't 
sidelined Sunday Silence, Easy Goer and Criminal Type. . . .

<P>
Unlike Bo Schembechler, Gary Moeller won't get a chance to screw up in the Rose

Nice to see Washington move up in the ratings, but at No. 6 in United Press

Funniest TV bit over the weekend came during CBS' telecast of the Washington

When Ryan O'Neal talks about boxing as a sportscaster on his new sitcom with 
Farrah Fawcett, he won't have to fake it. O'Neal, who managed welterweight

MELVIN DURSLAG: DOUGLAS STILL LOOKS LIKE A ONE-TIMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Giving deep and enduring thought to James (Buster) Douglas, heavyweight 
champion of the universe, you can allow, in a first judgment, that Buster has 
burgeoned as a formidable fighting machine. 
</P>
<P>
But in a second judgment, you see Buster as one of those horses that ascends 
Olympus on Derby Day and vanishes as quickly as he rose. 
</P>
<P>
We are talking about an Unbridled, a Spend a Buck, a Dust Commander, a Proud 
Clarion, a Kauai King -- Buster Douglases all on the first Saturday in May, but 
leaving no legacy worth remembering. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo last February, Buster was offered as a canape for Mike Tyson, who, in 
condition that was suspect, seemed to be looking for an easy yen. 
</P>
<P>
His case was strengthened by the fact that Don King, his business associate, 
confrere and spiritual adviser, dipped a mitt into the promotion, working with 
a Japanese entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
In this environment, two of the officials appointed to work the match were 
local, a third imported from America. Buster knocked out Tyson in the 10th 
round. 
</P>
<P>
It is then revealed, at fight's end, that the American official has Douglas six 
points in front, but one of the local officials has Tyson in front and the 
other has judged it even. The horrifying thought occurs that unless Buster 
knocks out Tyson, he probably was going to lose. Little wonder, bucking what 
was happening there, Buster comes into the fight a 42-1 underdog, and he pulls 
off this caper, an undeserving blow to the distinguished patriot, King. Douglas 
hasn't fought since. He has romped about the country, partaking generously of 
foodstuff. He has carried on socially, reveling in his new power. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever comical course he has followed, one cannot conclude unalterably 
that Douglas has forgotten how to fight. 
</P>
<P>
We will have a better line on that Thursday night when he engages Evander 
Holyfield at the house of chance in Las Vegas called the Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield appears to be a worthy challenger. So much so, in fact, that he is a 
substantial favorite over Douglas, who is hard-pressed to live with such 
indignity. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, Holyfield is a cruiserweight, compared to Douglas, who is 
dreadnaughtweight. Evander also yields a lot of reach to Buster and hits with 
less impact. 
</P>
<P>
So, why would Holyfield be the favorite? Well, the suspicion seems to be that 
Evander is better conditioned and generally steadier. He is seen chopping up 
Buster methodically. 
</P>
<P>
It is tasteless to introduce a commercial note to an occurrence of such 
refinement as a prizefight, but in Las Vegas, you could be seeing the last 
massive-money match for a long spell. 
</P>
<P>
The economy is growing anything but conducive to such undertakings. Most big 
fights have been bankrolled by gambling casinos, which are beginning to feel 
the financial bite and will feel it even greater in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
If the group posting maybe as much as $40 million to stage the 
Douglas-Holyfield thing suffers inadvertent losses because of (a) lean ticket 
sales, (b) lean pay-per-view sales and (c) appearance on the scene of fewer 
crapshooters than expected, it is going to have a sobering impact on money 
volunteered for fights down the line. 
</P>
<P>
Hard times or not, seats will be listed at $200 to $1,000 at the match Thursday 
when the strong possibility exists that Holyfield will fight Douglas smarter 
than Tyson did. If Tyson had a plan, it wasn't evident to anyone who watched. 
</P>
<P>
And the prediction in Las Vegas? It is Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
Like Apple Annie, Buster is seen here as royalty only for a day.

<P>
With Coach Mike Dunleavy promising to play this one "like an exhibition is 
supposed to be played," the Lakers will meet the Golden State Warriors tonight 
at 7:30 in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers are 3-l in exhibitions against NBA opponents, having used their 
regulars and top substitutes heavily. Magic Johnson and Byron Scott sat out 
Monday's practice with bumps and bruises, and James Worthy missed Tuesday's 
drill. 
</P>
<P>
X-rays of Larry Drew's left knee were negative, and he will accompany the team.

The Clippers will play the Portland Trail Blazers in an exhibition game tonight

Cecil Fielder, the first major league player in 13 years to hit 50 or more home 
runs in a season, and Ryne Sandberg, only the third second baseman ever to hit 
40 or more, lead a power-laden 1990 Associated Press baseball all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-man team, selected in a nationwide poll of sportswriters and 
broadcasters and based only on regular-season performances, has six National 
League players and six American League players. 
</P>
<P>
Three teams were represented by two players each -- Pittsburgh Pirate 
outfielders Barry Bonds and Bobby Bonilla; Chicago White Sox catcher Carlton 
Fisk and relief pitcher Bobby Thigpen; and Oakland Athletic outfielder Rickey 
Henderson and right-handed pitcher Bob Welch. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg and Milwaukee Brewer designated hitter Dave Parker were the only 
repeaters from last year. 
</P>
<P>
Completing the team are the San Francisco Giants' Matt Williams at third base, 
the Cincinnati Reds' Barry Larkin at shortstop and the New York Mets' Frank 
Viola as the left-handed pitcher.

David Wingate of the San Antonio Spurs will go on trial Jan. 7 on charges of 
raping a 17-year-old, according to the prosecutor in Ellicott City, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Wingate, 26, is charged with second-degree rape, battery and a fourth-degree 
sexual offense. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged victim said she was attacked during a party at his apartment in 
Columbia, Md., Sept. 16. Wingate told police she had consented to have sex. 
</P>
<P>
A 21-year-old woman charged Wingate last month in a civil suit in San Antonio, 
alleging that he sexually assaulted her last June after drinking with her at a 
nightclub.

TWO TOP MARES FINALLY TO MEET

Females have moved into the spotlight in horse racing. 
</P>
<P>
In thoroughbred racing, the Breeders' Cup program Saturday in New York will be 
highlighted by the Distaff, bringing together stars Bayakoa, Go for Wand and 
Gorgeous. There also have been rave reviews for unbeaten Meadow Star, the 
favorite in the Juvenile Fillies. 
</P>
<P>
In harness racing, the most publicized Standardbred in recent times is Miss 
Easy, a filly who paced the fastest winning mile for a 2-year-old, 1:51 2/5, at 
Lexington, Ky., last month. 
</P>
<P>
The story is no different in quarter horse racing, where the mares Dash for 
Speed and See Me Do It are on a collision course in the Breeders Championship 
Classic Nov. 17 at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
The Horsemen's Quarter Horse Racing Assn. meet opens Friday and will continue 
through Feb. 2 at the Orange County track. Fans are already circling Nov. 17 
and Dec. 15, a possible rematch date in the Champion of Champions. The two 
mares have never met before and their races probably will yield the 1990 world 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
See Me Do It, a 4-year-old, has won 15 of 18 races and earned $884,833. The 
Oklahoma-bred chestnut won the 1989 Champion of Champions at Los Alamitos, 
clinching the world champion title, and currently has a four-race winning 
streak at Ruidoso Downs, N.M. She arrived from Oklahoma last week with trainer 
Bobby Turner, who is seeking millionaire status for her before retiring her. 
</P>
<P>
Dash for Speed, a 5-year-old daughter of Dash for Cash, has won 21 of 27 starts 
and earned $1,093,441. Trained by Blane Schvaneveldt, the Texas-bred mare is 
two for two in 1990, having won the Anne Burnett Invitational and Los Alamitos 
Championship in July. Her time of :19.53 in the Anne Burnett broke a 14-year 
track record for 400 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Dash for Speed has settled for third place in the Breeders Championship the 
last two years. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope the third time's the charm," co-owner Bob Blakeman of Ft. Worth, Tex., 
said. "We want real bad to get the world championship. We feel she deserves to 
have that." 
</P>
<P>
March 14 is a special date for Blakeman and Dash for Speed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my birthday, it's her birthday and it's the date I bought her as a 
2-year-old from my mother (Mary McRae)," Blakeman said. "The next day I sold 
half interest to Tom Bradbury, a horse owner and friend from Byers, Colo."

Dash for Speed is also a mother-to-be for the first time but it hasn't 
interfered with her training. "We bred her for the first time last April to 
Streakin Six and seven days later took the embryo," Blakeman said. "A recipient 
mare is carrying her embryo. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm keeping my fingers crossed she foals on March 14. I'll be 52, Dash For 
Speed will be 6 and we'll all celebrate with champagne!" 
</P>
<P>
Dash For Speed is nominated to the Inaugural Handicap opening night but 
probably will wait for the Charger Bar Handicap Nov. 3 to prep for the Breeders 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
It was the best of meets and worst of meets for Los Alamitos harness racing, 
which concluded a 42-night stand last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The meet was highlighted by the return of the American Pacing Classic, which 
produced a 1:51 2/5 world record by T K's Skipper in the $150,000 final; and 
the opening of a $750,000 paddock in the grandstand during the final week. 
</P>
<P>
But the meeting produced combined on-track and off-track nightly average 
attendance of 4,495 and handle of $773,985. There are no comparable dates in 
recent years, but a 101-night winter session averaged 4,847 and $818,796, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem we had at first was a virus in our stable area that hit 
about 300 horses," said Lloyd Arnold, president and general manager. "They 
usually last two or three weeks, but this one kept hanging on. Horses are just 
coming back now." 
</P>
<P>
The first 2 1/2 weeks of the meet overlapped with the end of the Del Mar 
thoroughbred season. Los Alamitos served as a satellite wagering site for the 
first time during those afternoons. Los Alamitos handled about $750,000 per 
afternoon -- it kept $15,000 plus parking and concessions each day -- but 
harness handle was down about $100,000 a night. Los Alamitos was unable to send 
its signal to Del Mar during that time, costing another $20,000 per night. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, trifecta wagering and commingling of pools in Nevada did not come 
into place in time to help the meet. The California Horse Racing Board approved 
the trifecta -- picking the 1-2-3 finishers in one race in order -- as an 
experiment, but legislation remains unsigned in the Office of Administrative 
Law. 
</P>
<P>
The commingling of pools -- by which wagering at a consortium of 14 Nevada 
sports books now goes directly into the track pool -- began last week at Santa 
Anita and will join Los Alamitos on opening night of the quarter horse meet. 
</P>
<P>
"The trifecta would have put us up 10 to 15%," said Arnold, who was relieved to 
see Del Mar approved as a Standardbred training site until early February. He 
had hoped that the CHRB also would allocate leased dates at Fairplex Park in 
Pomona from April to August. 
</P>
<P>
"If not, we'll have to re-enact our lawsuit," said Arnold. "But I think we'll 
find a solution to satisfy the board and satisfy us."

DESPITE RECENT LUCK, LUKAS IS OPTIMISTIC; 
</P>
<P>
BREEDERS' CUP: TRAINER PROBABLY WON'T HAVE ANY FAVORITES IN SATURDAY'S RACES. 
BUT HE EXPECTS TO WIN.

<P>
Wayne Lukas, who recently went through a 38-race slump at Santa Anita, was told 
one of his promising fillies had broken down at Belmont Park Tuesday morning. 
The filly, Hey Hey Paula, had to be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
It has been that kind of autumn for Lukas, the trainer with the most Breeders' 
Cup accomplishments, who goes into Saturday's seventh running with little 
chance of winning any of the seven races. 
</P>
<P>
"We're like a cat," the unflappable Lukas said. "We're always landing on our 
feet." 
</P>
<P>
After six years and 42 Breeders' Cup races, the Lukas barn has won 10, seven 
more than either Shug McGaughey or Neil Drysdale, who are tied for second 
place. Lukas' horses, which have finished second 10 times and run third six 
times, have earned $7.8 million, almost $4 million more than those run by 
Charlie Whittingham, who is next on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
But today, when the names of seven Lukas horses are dropped into the entry box 
at Belmont, none will be listed as a favorite by the track handicapper. Seven 
of Lukas' 10 Breeders' Cup winners, either by themselves or while running as 
part of multiple-horse entries, went off the favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas, who with more than $12.5 million in purses will lead the nation for the 
eighth consecutive year, says that Steinlen, winner of last year's Breeders' 
Cup Mile and running in the same race Saturday, offers his best chance for 
victory. But Steinlen, who hasn't won since July and has only three victories 
in nine races this year, might go off at 5-1 Saturday in a grass race that 
lacks a distinct favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas' other starters are Shy Tom in the Classic; Luthier's Launch in the 
Distaff; Carson City and Senor Speedy in the Sprint; and Deposit Ticket and 
Fire in Ice in the Juvenile. The Juvenile Fillies, which Lukas has won with 
Twilight Ridge and Open Mind, and a stake that has accounted for 20 of Lukas' 
59 Breeders' Cup starters, doesn't have a single runner from the trainer's barn 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
The customary clockwork schedule at Lukas' barn was interrupted for about an 
hour Tuesday morning after Hey Hey Paula, out of Big Dreams, the dam that 
produced the sprinter Housebuster, came back from the track limping. 
</P>
<P>
After consulting with their veterinarian, Lukas and Howard Kaskel, who shared 
ownership in the 2-year-old, agreed that the only thing that could be done was 
to give the filly a lethal injection. Hey Hey Paula had not been scheduled to 
run in the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Much later, Lukas analyzed his Breeders' Cup position and took his familiar 
stance. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1988, everybody was saying that we were having a down year," the trainer 
said. "Then bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! We had it all." 
</P>
<P>
At Churchill Downs in the Breeders' Cup that year, Lukas won with Gulch, Open 
Mind and Is It True and had two second-place finishes and a third. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lukas could come up empty in the Breeders' Cup for the first time 
since 1984, when the first event was held at Hollywood Park, he still might be 
smiling late Saturday. Developments in the races might result in 
horse-of-the-year honors going to the Lukas-trained Criminal Type, who was 
taken out of training because of a sore leg after running sixth in the Jockey 
Club Gold Cup at Belmont on Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
The turf writers, track racing secretaries and Daily Racing Form voters won't 
cast their ballots for national honors until early next year, but Lukas feels 
that Criminal Type accomplished enough before his injury to merit their 
support. Criminal Type won seven of 11 starts, earned $2.2 million and scored 
major victories in the Pimlico Special, the Metropolitan Handicap, the 
Hollywood Gold Cup and the Whitney Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Among his victims were Sunday Silence, Easy Goer and Housebuster, all of whom 
would be factors in Breeders' Cup races if they hadn't been injured. 
</P>
<P>
"He not only won, he went around the country to do it," Lukas said. "You should 
judge horses by who you beat, and how you do it, and by those standards 
Criminal Type deserves the title." 
</P>
<P>
Go For Wand, the favorite in Saturday's Distaff, and Meadow Star, who by 
winning the Juvenile Fillies could close out the year with an undefeated record 
of seven victories, are other horse-of-the-year candidates, and trainer Ron 
McAnally, whose Bayakoa will be the second betting choice in the Distaff, feels 
that she also deserves consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas says that Criminal Type should be rated over all three distaffers because 
they didn't beat male horses this year. 
</P>
<P>
Horse of the year or not, Criminal Type's racing career appears to be over. He 
was sent to Calumet Farm in Lexington, Ky., where a decision on his racing 
future is pending. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he'll run anymore, although it's not my decision to make," Lukas 
said. "If it was anybody but Calumet, I'd say that there'd be a chance he'd 
come back. But once you get to the farm at Calumet, you usually wind up going 
to stud. We've never won the Classic, and he would have had an outstanding 
chance. He was the flagship of our operation this year." 
</P>
<P>
Steinlen is another horse Lukas will be losing to the breeding shed, probably 
after Saturday, although there is a chance that he might run in the Japan Cup 
next month. Steinlen is winless in his last two grass starts, and running on 
dirt for the second time in a 44-race career on Oct. 6, he was last in the 
Jockey Club Gold Cup here. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a fall horse and on Tuesday he worked (half a mile) in 49 (seconds) flat, 
so he's ready," Lukas said. "The dirt race was an experiment that didn't work. 
We were just hoping to add to his stud value by trying him on dirt. I'm 
factoring the race in as a workout on his record." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
With horses being officially entered today, there was a late report Tuesday 
that a trainer's switch might further change the field for the $3-million 
Classic. Francois Boutin is said to be considering running Priolo, the French 
colt, in the Classic instead of the Mile. Priolo, who has five victories in 
eight starts, all on grass, was pre-entered last week for both races. 
</P>
<P>
Priolo's shift to the Classic could squeeze out Lively One, who reportedly is 
the 14th and final horse on the preference list. If Lively One doesn't run, he 
would be the second California-based colt to be at Belmont but unable to start 
in the Classic. Quiet American is also without a berth.

<P>
Treading on SURELOCK's turf, I ended the week on a positive note when In Excess 
won the eighth race on Sunday. However, I missed my $10 exacta box when Barton 
Dene finished third. Today, I'm betting a $15 exacta baseball in the seventh 
with Lakeland Beauty-Belara-Singing Pirate. 
</P>
<P>
Janice Goldinger's Sun. Bankroll: $2,131 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's Profit: $125 
</P>
<P>
Current Bankroll: $2,256 
</P>
<P>
SURELOCK lost $80 on Sunday when Mehmetori, who went lame, failed in the eighth 
race. SURELOCK, casually reminded by his programmer of the fate that befell HAL 
in "2001, a Space Odyssey," spewed dozens of bets for Wednesday. However, given 
the limited budget the computer has to work with, only a few of its bets are 
possible. They are: A $2 Pick Nine composed of Fistylee, Proclamation, Bold 'N 
Timely, Valid Allure, Honor Clef, Casey's Plum, Cascading Gold, Sondeed and 
Worthy Rolfe. Also, a $2 Pick Six composed of the above selections; $15 triples 
of Casey's Plum, Danzig Melody and Got It Dialed in the sixth to Cascading Gold 
in the seventh and Sondeed in the eighth; also another $15 triple on Casey's 
Plum-Cascading Gold-Sondeed, and a $20 exacta box, I Can Do That-Honor Clef, in 
the fifth race. 
</P>
<P>
SURELOCK's Sun. Bankroll: $494 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's Loss: $80 
</P>
<P>
Current Bankroll: $414 
</P>
<P>
Note: Janice Goldinger, a horse owner, does not bet on races her horses run in. 
SURELOCK does not own horses. 
</P>
<P>
Both players started with a $2,000 bankroll.

BIG EIGHT REINSTATES FIFTH-DOWN OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven football officials who were suspended for mistakenly giving Colorado a 
critical fifth down against Missouri have been reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
The seven officials will not work together as a crew for the remainder of the 
season, John McClintock, supervisor of Big Eight officials, said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said it is standard policy not to announce in advance which games 
officials are working. 
</P>
<P>
The crew was suspended after the Oct. 6 Missouri-Colorado game in Columbia, Mo. 
Colorado was mistakenly given a fifth down on the final play and scored the 
go-ahead touchdown in a 33-31 victory. 
</P>
<P>
A Purdue spokesman says the published report that football Coach Fred Akers 
will be fired at the end of this season unless there's a major turnaround is 
"only speculation." 
</P>
<P>
And the coach said it was news to him. 
</P>
<P>
The Indianapolis Star, quoting unidentified sources inside and outside of the 
Purdue athletic department, also reported today that if Akers goes, Athletic 
Director George King, who is 62, may be asked to take early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue is 1-5 this season, 0-3 in the Big Ten, and has scored only nine points 
in its last three games. Akers' record is 11-27-1 in four years at Purdue after 
10 years as head coach at Texas (86-31-2) and two at Wyoming (10-13-0).

LITERATURE: FROM MYSTERIES TO SCIENCE FICTION TO CHINESE-LANGUAGE BOOKS, IT

A lone female figure stepped onto the sidewalk, pausing to adjust her cargo of 
terror: some $40 worth of suspense, mystery and horror books. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with enough mystery treats to last through many a dark night -- "Strega" 
"Rod Serling's Night Gallery Reader," "Silver Scream" and "Scare Care" -- she 
moved briskly toward a waiting car. 
</P>
<P>
Mary De Louise needn't have scurried away from her midday caper, however. Even 
after her expedition to BOOK'em Mysteries, the San Gabriel Valley's newest 
specialty bookstore, De Louise still had 15 minutes before she was due back on 
the job at Balk's Hardware and Garden Supplies. 
</P>
<P>
As she headed back to the workaday world, De Louise, 24, reflected on her 
lunch-hour spree. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited," she said. "I've never found any other place that has such a good 
selection." 
</P>
<P>
Avid readers seeking their favorite volumes have a wealth of choices in the 
world of San Gabriel Valley specialty bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
BOOK'em, which opened in South Pasadena on Oct. 5, joined a select group of 
local booksellers offering tomes on everything from African-American art to 
zoology. 
</P>
<P>
Old Pasadena has the sci-fi offerings of Planet 10, and Claremont boasts 
Recess, a children's bookstore featuring a little red schoolhouse for playtime. 
Also in Claremont is Wild Iris, specializing in books by and about women. 
</P>
<P>
In Covina, Pathfinder caters to devotees of Christian books, and virtually all 
the books at Evergreen in Monterey Park are in Chinese. Altadena is home to the 
Black and Latino Bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Books, one of the oldest bookstores in Pasadena, specializes in 
out-of-print and rare collections of detective and mystery novels. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Martin, a former television producer who co-owns BOOK'em Mysteries with 
Mary Riley, a Monrovia teacher, said he joined the ranks of specialty 
booksellers because he was "tired of the rat race." 
</P>
<P>
"I had always harbored this secret desire to open a bookstore and have my own 
kind of venture," he said. "And being a lover of mysteries and thrillers I 
decided that this was the kind of genre that we wanted to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
BOOK'em's exposed brick wall is decorated with FBI wanted posters and a pair of 
broken handcuffs supplied by the South Pasadena Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Its volumes are divided into separate sections, including Mysteries, Thriller, 
Horror/Occult, True Crime, Suspense and Vintage. 
</P>
<P>
Even representatives of large general bookstores believe that the profusion of 
smaller, specialty establishments helps the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The stronger the independent bookstores are, the stronger the business 
becomes," said Karen Watkins, a manager at Vroman's, in Pasadena. 
</P>

For many visitors to the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum in Arcadia, the 
grass is always greener in the "Garden for All Seasons," a half-acre plot of 
land that lies behind a stalwart oak tree close to the arboretum's entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Hopeful horticulturists flock to the garden to admire flowers, from amaranths 
to zinnias, and vegetables that would spruce up any salad. And they seek advice 
from the man with one of the greenest thumbs in the San Gabriel Valley: Bill 
Hager. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 13 years, Hager has been the mind and body behind the garden. At 
82, this white-haired, bespectacled great-grandfather volunteers four mornings 
a week at the arboretum, giving freely of his knowledge, expertise and labor. 
</P>
<P>
And the garden flourishes throughout the year -- so much so that budding 
gardeners often come to Hager armed with books and catalogues, firing a barrage 
of questions on how to bolster their own efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an authority -- he knows everything," said Jack Hart of Arcadia, one of 
Hager's dozen assistants. 
</P>
<P>
The visitors ask him what, when, where and how to plant. But mostly, said Hager 
as he sat in the cool shade of the oak tree, gazing at the San Gabriel 
Mountains, they ask for advice on watering. 
</P>
<P>
"They think when it's dry you have to water (the plants) every day, but you 
don't," the longtime Temple City resident said. "There's no set answer; you 
have to use your own judgment." 
</P>
<P>
His own judgment is tempered by more than half a century's experience in the 
nursery business -- a history as colorful as his flowers, stemming back to his 
teen-age years in his native Germany. 
</P>
<P>
At that time he lived with his parents and two sisters in the eastern German 
city of Erfurt, known as the "flower city of Germany" for its large number of 
nurseries. When he was 16, his physician father encouraged him to work without 
pay for a short time at a nursery in a neighboring city. 
</P>
<P>
"My father said, 'Try it out, just for the fun of it,' " Hager recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The six-month stint was enough to persuade the young man to sign on at a 
nursery in Erfurt as an apprentice, a position he held for two years. 
</P>
<P>
But his new-found vocation was interrupted by his voyage to the United States 
in 1927, when he was 19. By that time, Adolf Hitler had written "Mein Kampf" 
and was beginning to form the Nazi Party. Hager's recently widowed father felt 
it wise to send his only son away from Germany "while there was a chance," 
Hager said. 
</P>
<P>
As he adjusted to life in Cincinnati and then in Southern California, he worked 
odd jobs, first as caretaker at a large estate and then in a launderette. 
</P>
<P>
About a year later, he landed a job at a small nursery in Los Angeles. He 
worked at a succession of nurseries in Los Angeles County before he and his 
wife of 55 years, Mary, bought their own business in 1948. Located in Temple 
City, Hager's Nursery met the gardening needs of area residents for more than 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Hager retired at the end of 1977. But he has continued pursuing his first love 
by volunteering at the arboretum and planning the "Garden for All Seasons." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he said, this year has not been as fruitful as years past. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing at a small vegetable patch, he shook his head and said, "We didn't 
even get one good tomato (this summer)" -- a result of intense summer heat, 
smog and malathion spraying, which killed pollinating bees, as well as pesky 
Medflies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The flowers appear to have fared better. Magenta, white and deep orange 
impatiens -- small, delicate-looking flowers -- decorate one shaded bed. Pink 
and yellow zinnias peek out daintily from another patch. Pale hollyhocks show 
off in a corner. 
</P>
<P>
Hager has already begun planting winter vegetables, such as cauliflower, 
cabbage and carrots, and spring flowers, such as snapdragons, pansies and 
delphiniums. 
</P>
<P>
But he took a break from pushing his wheelbarrow last Tuesday to reflect on why 
he has cultivated his vocation for so many years. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always liked to work outside more than inside," he said. "When you work 
in an office, you leave to go home and you lock the door. When you come back, 
it's all there; it's all the same. 
</P>
<P>
"When you work outdoors, when you come back, everything's different -- rain, 
shine or snow. You never know what Mother Nature has in store." 
</P>

A BLOCK THAT RESTS ON SHARING; 
</P>
<P>
NEIGHBORHOOD: THE RESIDENTS OF MONROVIA'S OAKCLIFF ROAD KEEP THE STREET'S 
FRIENDLY SPIRIT ALIVE BY DOING THINGS TOGETHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Valley View.

<P>
Just below Monrovia's canyons runs Oakcliff Road, a bastion of neighborliness 
and stability. 
</P>
<P>
The Northeast Monrovia cul-de-sac of about 30 homes is known for its block 
events. In addition to annual New Year's Eve parties, residents each March hold 
a back-yard sale, where anything from plastic kitchenware to Art Deco lamps can 
be picked up at bargain prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Often," chuckled Charlotte Schamadan, 41, "we buy things from each other that 
we put up for sale ourselves a year or two later." 
</P>
<P>
Schamadan and her husband, Lee, run a graphics design business from their home 
and create posters for civic festivities. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the newcomers on the street," she said. "We've lived here only 11 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Queen Esther and Willie Hawkins moved to Oakcliff Road in 1970. "We bought the 
house because we liked it. We especially liked the kitchen and the three 
bathrooms," Queen Esther Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Course, 69, who throws holiday coffee parties for the neighbors, said she 
and her husband, Ben, are among the earliest residents of the street. They 
moved there in 1958. Soon after, in 1961, came the Piderits, Pete and Betty. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Piderit, 67, a retired IBM executive, is chairman of the Neighborhood 
Watch. When he isn't busy tending his hydroponic tomato patch (the tomatoes are 
planted in ceramic pebbles and watered four times a day), Piderit runs a 
Monrovia dance group, which meets annually in his light-green stucco home. 
</P>
<P>
Most residents agree they couldn't afford to buy on the street now. The 
ranch-style homes, predominantly three-bedroom-and-den, sell for upward of 
$300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Oakcliff Road was once in the apron of a lush forest, where Indians 
occasionally hunted and fished. It is topped by 5,409-foot Monrovia Peak, and 
grooving southward along rocky creeks and streams are what are known now as 
Monrovia and Sawpit canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Just below the junction of the two, a deep "saw pit" was once dug. According to 
legend, Franciscan priests and Indian laborers hauled lumber down the mountain 
for the construction of the San Gabriel Mission, and crouched together in the 
pit to saw it. It's said they also dug mysterious, long tunnels found in 
Norumbrega Canyon in 1934. 
</P>
<P>
The pit, which has long since disappeared, was there when the earliest settlers 
arrived in the area. The first known were the Rankins -- Hibbard and Polly -- 
who came in 1874 with their four children. They built a cabin in the canyon and 
earned their living sawing wood in the saw pit. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the cabin was destroyed by fire and flood, and typhoid fever claimed 
three of their children. The triple tombstones remain at the top of Canyon 
Boulevard, Monrovia Historical Society President Steve Baker said. However, 
after an incident of vandalism about two years ago, the grave markers were 
restored and permanently placed to lie flat, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the city of Monrovia was established in 1886, a reservoir was built in 
Sawpit Canyon. William N. Monroe, of Scott County, Ind., a Civil War cavalry 
scout and railroad entrepreneur who is considered Monrovia's founding father, 
secured the water rights to the two canyons as one of his first official acts 
as mayor. Later, he built a burro trail up the canyon to what is now Deer Park. 
</P>
<P>
In 1905, Ben Overturff of Selma, Iowa, stumbled upon Deer Park while on a 
hunting trip, and fell in love with the idyllic glen. Toting supplies, 
burro-style, up the trial, he built Deer Park Lodge, where, it is said, guests 
would arrive to find beans on the stove and Mrs. Overturff's lemon pies on the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
Sawpit Canyon saw many changes over the years -- mainly the construction of 
Sawpit Dam in 1928 and '29. In the 1930s, Civilian Conservation Corps workers 
extended Sawpit Canyon Road to link up with fire roads around Monrovia Peak. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the 13-square-mile city of Monrovia has about 35,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Even though crime in the city has gone up in recent years, the people on 
Oakcliff Road say they feel safe on the street. Many look for signs that 
someone's out of town, and then keep a watchful eye on the house. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the quiet, the mountain backdrop and the small-town atmosphere here," 
Jane Course said. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Schamadan added: "The neighbors are wonderful. And Monrovia is the 
best-kept secret in the San Gabriel Valley."

SEQUOYAH SCHOOL SCARES UP ANNUAL PUMPKIN FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
All this week, students at Pasadena's Sequoyah School will be putting the 
finishing touches on a haunted house, practicing ghost stories and boning up on 
their skeleton paintings. 
</P>
<P>
It's all part of the 1990 version of the school's 8th Annual Pumpkin Festival, 
which celebrates not only Halloween but also the creativity of children. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's festival, which is open to the public, features games and other 
events for children of all ages, with an emphasis on introducing them to new 
ideas and experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the activities will be a corn-husking contest, a costume parade 
(children can select disguises or accessories from a costume shop on the 
premises), a ghost-story hour, a dragon-painting mural, food-decorating booths 
for young children, a professional face painter and games such as "Pumpkin 
Land" (an obstacle course) and "Beetle in a Haystack." 
</P>
<P>
For adults, there will be a jazz band, barbecued ribs and a $10-a-ticket 
lottery with donated prizes ranging from a year's membership in a local health 
club to getting someone to come your house to show you how to program your 
videocassette recorder. 
</P>
<P>
One new event this year will be a concert for nose-flugelers, said festival 
chairwoman Nancy Kyes. The nose-flugel is a type of kazoo played through the 
nose. A nose-flugel concert, for anyone who cares to participate, will be held 
at 2 p.m. as part of the festival. 
</P>
<P>
The Sequoyah School, which has been operating for 35 years, is a private 
kindergarten- 
</P>
<P>
through-eighth-grade school that emphasizes open learning, which means that 
children are grouped according to ability and social readiness rather than by 
age, Kyes said. 
</P>
<P>
The festival runs from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday on the grounds of the school, 
at the corner of Pasadena Avenue and California Boulevard in Pasadena. 
Admission is free, and festival-goers are encouraged to come in costume. 
</P>
<P>
Game tickets will be sold for 25 cents each, and barbecue plates will be about 
$5, Kyes said. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds will benefit the school. KAREN E. KLEIN

EX-HOSTAGE'S JOY IS TEMPERED BY THOSE STILL HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Jack Frazier's days as an American hostage inside a Baghdad safe house passed 
quickly enough. The Santa Ana man filled the long hours scouring the home's 
upstairs bathrooms and leading a daily exercise class for 20 fellow hostages. 
On Fridays, he would cook for the others sharing the house. 
</P>
<P>
But after dark, the pain and pressure of captivity would bear down on him, the 
53-year-old construction superintendent said Tuesday. Too much time to think 
about mistakes, about little slights done to loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the worst part that I had was the nights," Frazier said during a phone 
interview from his Amman, Jordan, hotel room, where he was taken along with 13 
other American hostages released by Iraq Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"When you shut the light out at night, your mind kind of plays games on you. 
Incidents would pop back in my mind that I didn't really handle too well. I may 
have got upset at my son. At the time, it wasn't a major item. But when you 
wake up at 2 in the morning and say, 'My God, I'm in Baghdad and I'm a 
hostage!' Well, it makes you place appreciation and affection on things that 
maybe were trivial before." 
</P>
<P>
After arriving in Amman, Frazier immediately called his mother and fiancee in 
Whitefish, Mont., and his daughter, Kimberly Albrecht, in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mixture of the happiest day in my life, and the anticipation of getting 
everybody else back home safely," an emotionally shaken Albrecht said after 
speaking to her father. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier will fly to New York today, catch up on some sleep and arrive in Los 
Angeles on Thursday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I guarantee you," he said, laughing, "I will kiss the ground on arrival." 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the 14 Americans released 
Tuesday included six from a list of 69 people in urgent need of medical care. 
Frazier, a construction crew manager for San Francisco-based Bechtel Power 
Corp., is a diabetic who takes oral medication. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier was among 700 to 800 Americans trapped in Iraq and Kuwait since Aug. 2, 
when Iraq invaded the small emirate. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqis call them "special guests," and while those in the group were not 
rounded up and detained, they have been hostages since shortly after the 
conflict erupted, when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein banned the departure of 
thousands of foreigners whose governments are trying to drive him out of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
For the first three weeks after the invasion, Frazier remained at the Sheraton 
Hotel, where he had been living. Then, he and numerous other Americans were 
told to move to the American Embassy or other safe havens. Frazier declined to 
identify where he stayed because other hostages are still there. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier said he spent the past several weeks in a two-story house, a hostage 
without blindfold or physical torture but trapped nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
"I was most certainly being held against my will," he said Tuesday. "We were 
told not to go outside for our own safety." 
</P>
<P>
Frazier said he was told not to discuss why he and the others were selected for 
release. But he said a group of Iraqi-born Americans called the Iraqi 
Businessman's Assn. secured freedom for the 14 hostages after discussions with 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
When he left Baghdad, he said, it was with a mixture of relief and anguish. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the toughest moments in my life was when I got into the vehicle and 
stood there and saw my friends who remain," he said. "I found it rather 
difficult to even put the feeling into words. It's been eight hours since then 
. . . but it's tough. They are friends for life, those people." 
</P>
<P>
Albrecht said her father was saddened during his departure from Iraq because he 
did not want to leave the other hostages who, because of their unique ordeal, 
had become "bonded together." 
</P>
<P>
"He was crying on the flight out of Baghdad," she said. "My father was working 
with the Iraq-American (group) over there. He wanted to make sure there is 
nothing more that he can do before he leaves the Middle East. He said he would 
do everything he could to help get the rest of the hostages out of there." 
</P>
<P>
It would be three weeks after the Iraqi invasion before Frazier's family 
learned that he was alive in Baghdad. Prayers, Albrecht said, were the family's 
only solace. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very worried. It took about three weeks for us to receive word from 
the State Department," said Albrecht, who, during the two-month ordeal, has 
acted on behalf of her family with State Department representatives. In turn, 
she would contact each member of the Frazier family, including her two 
brothers, Scott of Santa Ana and Robert, a captain in the U.S. Army at Ft. Ord. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the emotional roller-coaster finally ended for the family. 
</P>
<P>
The ride for Frazier himself wasn't quite over. Still revved up from his ordeal 
and travels, Frazier talked eloquently of the life lessons he had learned as a 
hostage. 
</P>
<P>
"At 53 years old, I've got a whole new education," he said with a sigh. "I 
learned a lot of compassion. I've learned that there's a lot of agony and pain 
in this world that I wasn't aware of, and that there's a lot of very hard 
people who have no compassion. 
</P>
<P>
"The comrades I was with, we tried very, very hard to bolster each other and 
not allow each other to get down," Frazier said. "But at night, you look out, 
and you see the stars, and you wonder: 'I wonder what my daughter's doing? I 
wonder what my fiancee's doing?' Nobody can tell you what an emotional 
roller-coaster it is." 
</P>
<P>
Frazier several weeks ago said he hoped "when this history finally is written, 
and that last chapter is over, I will get a chance to read it." 
</P>
<P>
Now on his way home, he said, he hopes to work on his health, to find a new job 
with Bechtel and catch a couple of homes games of his beloved but beleaguered 
Los Angeles Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"I think things will turn around for them now," he said confidently.

M MAIL: Supporters of Measure M, the half-cent tax for transportation on the 
November ballot, are finally getting ready for their first mass mailing -- 
450,000 pieces due out in the next few days. . . . "We got a bit of a late 
start," acknowledges Reed Royalty of the campaign, "but we're catching up." . . 
. Late won't mean unsophisticated, though. There will be 30 different versions 
of the mailer, informing voters in different areas of the county what streets 
and intersections will be improved if the measure passes. Dennis McLellan and

<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE COMMISSIONERS OVERRULED CONCERNS OF ENVIRONMENTALISTS IN 
SUPPORTING THE PROJECT NEAR MISSION VIEJO.

<P>
Overruling concerns raised by environmental consultants, the Orange County 
Planning Commission on Tuesday unanimously backed a proposed planned community 
near Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which would allow as many as 2,500 homes and apartments to be 
built on about 1,000 acres, came under fire from an array of environmental 
organizations during a 4 1/2-hour meeting. But at its conclusion, the 
commissioners held a straw vote in which they voiced some concerns but signaled 
overall approval for the development. 
</P>
<P>
The project, known as the Las Flores Planned Community, is being proposed by 
the Santa Margarita Co., one of the county's largest and most influential 
development firms. 
</P>
<P>
"This project has support," commission Chairman Stephen A. Nordeck declared at 
the conclusion of the grueling session. "We just need to get a couple of things 
worked out." 
</P>
<P>
Among the most hotly debated points was a corridor intended to protect nesting 
birds in Arroyo Trabuco, a 5-mile stretch of canyon east of Mission Viejo. The 
arroyo is home to a variety of birds, and several species could be threatened 
by the development if steps are not taken to protect them, said Karlin Marsh, a 
biologist who studied the area under contract with the county's Harbors, 
Beaches and Parks division. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh recommended that the county trim about nine more acres from the project 
proposal, reserving it as buffer to protect the species inhabiting the arroyo. 
On a 3-2 vote, however, the commissioners rejected that proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Nordeck and Commissioner Thomas Moody voted in favor of the restriction, while 
A. Earl Wooden, Roger D. Slates and C. Douglas Leavenworth opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Marsh said the commission had probably doomed the birds in 
favor of the homes. 
</P>
<P>
"We've shut down the area for nesting raptors," she said, adding that 
red-tailed hawks and black-shouldered kites would be the most seriously 
affected. "They will no longer be there. Period, end of discussion." 
</P>
<P>
Although board members heard that argument during their session, many indicated 
that they believed that the project's potential benefits -- in particular, the 
construction of relatively low-cost housing in a county desperately short of it 
-- outweighed potential damage to birds and other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the county planning staff and the developer agreed to several 
conditions that are expected to reduce some of the environmental damage caused 
by the project. 
</P>
<P>
The company, for instance, has agreed to delete so-called Planning Area 7, a 
housing tract on the project's southern edge. Eliminating that area from the 
plan could cost the company $2.5 million to $3 million in lost housing sales, 
according to Dan Kelly, vice president of governmental relations for the Santa 
Margarita Co. 
</P>
<P>
The company also reconfigured other housing areas and eliminated a community 
park that county officials said could crowd species living in the arroyo. 
</P>
<P>
Although much discussion centered on environmental issues, commissioners also 
raised concerns about the amount and type of affordable housing that the 
project will include. Kelly, however, reassured commissioners by providing them 
with a proposed condition committing the company to providing 60% of its 
housing for less than $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Included in that will be housing units classified as "affordable" to people 
earning about 80% of the county's median income, a figure that varies along 
with average salaries of county residents. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly described himself as "gratified" by the commission's vote Tuesday but 
cautioned that final Planning Commission approval is still at least a week 
away. The commission will meet again Tuesday and is expected to approve the 
project at that session. 
</P>
<P>
The commission will then forward it to the Board of Supervisors, which will 
make the final determination on the project.

SURROGATE PARENTS DRAW THE CURTAINS ON THE CURIOUS, TRY FOR A NORMAL LIFE

The day after a judge's ruling changed their lives, Mark and Crispina Calvert 
looked to all the world like many other young married couples: He went off to 
work and she stayed home with the baby. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a telling sign that the emotional tumult that spilled into this 
house in the wake of a nationally watched test-tube baby case had not yet 
disappeared -- on a sunny California day, the curtains were drawn. 
</P>
<P>
Crispina Calvert said she is tired of cars full of curiosity seekers pulling to 
a stop outside and craning their necks for a glimpse of the black-haired infant 
who was born into a furious, draining custody fight. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll open the curtains sometime, but I'm not quite ready yet," she told The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
Since mid-August, the unique surrogate mother case has hijacked the hearts and 
minds of the Calverts and Anna L. Johnson, the woman they hired to carry their 
embryo, as well as a team of lawyers and a judge. On Monday, Orange County 
Superior Court Judge Richard N. Parslow Jr. handed victory to the Calverts, 
ruling that Johnson had no rights to the boy. Johnson, 29, has vowed to keep 
fighting in the appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like a ton of bricks has been lifted off my shoulders," Crispina 
Calvert said. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone tried to resume normal lives Tuesday, but signs of the emotional 
firefight lingered. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was "solemn and quiet" Monday but "more talkative" on Tuesday and 
"seemed to be returning more to herself," said her lawyer, Richard C. Gilbert. 
Although Johnson was upset, she anticipated Monday's decision and was 
emotionally prepared for it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who has been on disability from her job as a licensed vocational 
nurse, spent part of Tuesday on the telephone, Gilbert said, looking for a new 
apartment, since she has been staying temporarily in Mission Viejo, and for a 
new job. 
</P>
<P>
He said Johnson has "mixed feelings" about the prospect of returning to work at 
Western Medical Center, where she met Crispina Calvert, a registered nurse. She 
worries how her co-workers might treat her when she returns, and if it will be 
awkward when she runs into Crispina Calvert in the hallways, Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert said he was focusing on the future and feeling certain that Johnson 
will win her case in the appeals court. But even as he prepared his appeal 
Tuesday and returned to work on other cases, anger over Monday's ruling seeped 
into his thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though it was all very predictable, I'm still angry the judge didn't 
follow the law," Gilbert said. "It's a case of the system failing. I'm 
disappointed. But I'm pinning my hopes on the appeal." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert said he drew strength from a visit he made to church Monday with 
Johnson. Gazing at a crucifix for 20 minutes, he said, he realized something 
that seemed to capture the battle he had just fought. 
</P>
<P>
"Was Mary genetically related to Jesus Christ? And yet everyone recognizes that 
Mary is the mother of Christ. Perhaps that was really the first non-genetic 
(parent-child) case. I just knew more than ever that we were right in what we 
were doing." 
</P>
<P>
One of the Calverts' lawyers, Christian R. Van Deusen, took the second half of 
a Mammoth Lakes fishing trip that had been interrupted when the case gained 
momentum. The other, Robert Walmsley, "hit the grindstone" on other cases, 
spending Tuesday in Los Angeles on a contested adoption case and preparing to 
fly out to Stockton and Sacramento on others later this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I was riding on adrenalin, but then when the arguments were done and all we 
could do was wait for the ruling, there was a real letdown, and I got 
depressed," Walmsley said. "Yesterday, I was still shell-shocked, but today I'm 
back." 
</P>
<P>
The baby's court-appointed lawyer, Harold F. LaFlamme, said he had been unable 
to read books -- his favorite leisure pastime -- or sleep much during the 
Calvert case because he was "operating on maximum brainpower." Now it is a 
"relief" to get back to his usual battery of child-abuse cases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The infant's court-appointed guardian, William Steiner, said he was "absolutely 
drained" and "close to burnout," even after three decades of working with 
abused and neglected children. He said he was unprepared for the depth of 
emotion involved when three people wanted the same child. 
</P>
<P>
The hallway outside Parslow's fifth-floor courtroom had been overrun with a 
jostling, shouting mob of news media in the last three weeks, but on Tuesday it 
was finally quiet. 
</P>
<P>
"Both the bailiff and I remarked we were not accosted by 45 different press 
people saying, 'When will you open? Can we set up now?' " said Marci Dambert, 
Parslow's clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the courtroom, it was back to business as usual for Parslow as he began 
a new breach-of-contract trial -- this one involving real estate. 
</P>
<P>
The day after his widely publicized decision, Parslow was teased by other 
judges about when his autograph sessions might begin and who did his makeup, 
Dambert said. At the lunch recess, one judge left him a letter that began, 
"Dear Sol . . . ," a sly poke at Parslow for having been likened to King 
Solomon during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
The judge himself declined interviews, noting that it would be inappropriate to 
comment because the case is expected to be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't talked much about it," Dambert said of the normally loquacious 
jurist. "He doesn't get involved in the ego side of it. He's not that type of 
judge." 
</P>
<P>
Crispina Calvert said she thinks that even the baby, Christopher, senses the 
post-battle calm. For the first night in weeks, both mother and child slept 
soundly Monday night, she cradling the tiny infant in her arms. 
</P>
<P>
As Parslow read his decision in court Monday, the mother said, she was 
"shaking, and Mark's arm was around me, and I could feel his arm shaking." 
During the trial, she has been so drained that she didn't cook much. Her mother 
and sister came over and cooked instead, she said. But Tuesday night, she was 
back to her old ways, cooking one of her husband's favorite Filipino meals: 
beef with coconut milk, spinach and peanut butter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're finally getting kind of back to normal," she said. "Thank God 
that all that is finished."

DANA PARSONS: KARATE CLASS TRAINS KIDS FOR THE FIGHT OF THEIR LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By DANA PARSONS

<TEXT>
<P>
It's a jungle out there, and I suppose it's never too early to realize it. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing like watching a group of grade schoolers in karate class to 
realize we're not in Kansas any more. 
</P>
<P>
"Hand blow to the head," instructor Blaine Carter says. 
</P>
<P>
"Knife-hand to the neck. Clean 'em up. Those look sloppy. Clean." 
</P>
<P>
"Two cross-knives to the neck. . . . Reverse hammer to the groin. . . . 
Leopard's paw to the philtrum (the upper lip area)." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a person behind you with a knife. He's going to kill you. Are you 
going to miss him or are you going to get him?" 
</P>
<P>
"The only time you take your eyes off your opponent is when he has a gun, 
right?" 
</P>
<P>
"No-o-o-o-!" comes the response. 
</P>
<P>
"When do you take your eyes off?" 
</P>
<P>
"Never!" 
</P>
<P>
"Right. You never ever ever take your eyes off your opponent for any reason at 
all. Even if you think he's dead." 
</P>
<P>
The 11 kids in class, almost all of them under 10 years old, are having a 
rollicking good time. They are learning balance and agility and discipline and, 
not incidentally, how to deliver a nice spinning back kick to the breadbasket. 
</P>
<P>
They know Carter well enough to know this is for fun. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
Lest you think this is some wacko training ground for future Green Berets, be 
advised: Carter said his company, United Studios of Self-Defense, probably has 
more than 1,000 kids under 10 years old in karate classes in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But the class isn't about dismembering your schoolmate or extorting good grades 
from teachers. It reflects a growing realization that karate teaches not only 
agility and self-confidence but also prepares kids for the realities of 
modern-day life. 
</P>
<P>
When Susan Brayton had her first child nine years ago, she wanted as 
well-rounded a son as she could have. "Some of the books said it's important 
when you start out that they're given not only love but good nutrition and they 
also talked about sports and education and a good religious background. When I 
read some books about athletics and how to develop a fine body, many of the 
books said start with gymnastics and then move to karate." 
</P>
<P>
That was for physical dexterity and self-confidence, but the Braytons also 
wanted to teach their son, David, about the other facts of life. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people were surprised when they learned we put him in class," Brayton 
said. "It was like, 'What is she thinking of?' I'm not trying to create a mass 
murderer, but I want to give him the very best education and the best of sports 
and the very best of self-defense. And that's becoming just as important as 
outside school activities and sports are. 
</P>
<P>
"We have it nice in Orange County, but the crime rate is increasing. Robberies 
are up drastically in our neighborhood in the last few years. We try to raise 
kids in a sheltered environment -- and let's face it, Orange County is a 
sheltered environment -- but then we don't give them the tools if they go 
outside of their little nest area. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's the other thing that worried me. We may not be in Orange County 
forever. There's a real world out there and I want him to be able to handle it. 
. . . We're setting up little safe zones to live in and that's not realistic." 
Blaine Carter has just finished running the students through some paces. "You 
can go outside and kick anybody you want to, right?" 
</P>
<P>
"No," says one student. "You can, but it's against the law." 
</P>
<P>
"When do you defend yourself?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"When you go out on the street and someone bothers you and they won't stop and 
you can't get out of it," says one student. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter, you're a jerk! You're so stupid!" Carter says to a boy in the front 
row. "Should he hit me?" Carter asks. 
</P>
<P>
"No-o-o-o!" the students say. 
</P>
<P>
"So, words, no," Carter says. "If they're not hurting you, no. Try not to fight 
over words. Words and hurt. This is the line, and you have to know when to 
cross it." 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, I was wondering, 'Is he going to go kill everybody at 
school?' " Susan Brayton says. "But Blaine worked to make sure this is not for 
attack mode, but for self-defense and when someone is aggressive toward you. He 
started out with another friend of ours, and neither has gone around beating up 
anybody. But they have it, their reflexes are ready and they have in the back 
of their head that they know what to do. I can't be with him every moment. I 
want to protect him, but when I can't, the best thing is take him to an expert 
and give him the knowledge to protect himself." 
</P>
<P>
You look at these kids, all tow-headed and angel-faced, and tell yourself it's 
the future. Besides, as Susan Brayton says: "Our other son, he's now 3. He's 
mimicking the moves of our 9-year-old. He's already ready to go. If Blaine 
would take him tomorrow, I'd send him."

<P>
Jeanette Spruill walked around the back of her beachfront house Tuesday, 
pruning small ice plants beside the carefully landscaped patio on which her 
family has enjoyed 19 years of ocean breezes. 
</P>
<P>
But because of a City Council vote Monday night, Spruill and her husband must 
now lop off 2 1/2 feet from the patio because it encroaches on the public right 
of way. The council's decision, however, brought relief to Spruill and other 
homeowners who stood to lose up to 27 feet from their backyards and have a 
sidewalk installed behind their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's OK; we certainly aren't going to argue about it," said Spruill, one of 63 
homeowners affected by the council's decision. "We certainly are happy, no 
matter what, if we don't get a sidewalk. The sidewalk brings so much traffic 
and so much noise." 
</P>
<P>
The beachfront encroachment issue now moves to the state Coastal Commission, 
which must approve all changes in policy concerning the use of coastal land. 
And indications are that the Coastal Commission will go along with the 
council's decision only if the city extends an oceanfront concrete path that 
now runs from F Street to 36th Street. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Coastal Commission Deputy Director Tom Crandall reiterated that the 
two issues are linked. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, it will be the commission that will be making the decision on the 
appropriateness of the policy," Crandall said. "But we haven't changed our 
stance regarding the linkage or trade-off between allowing the encroachments 
and the sidewalk extension. 
</P>
<P>
In an Oct. 4 letter to the Newport Beach Planning Department, Crandall said 
that "(as) mitigation for the encroachments, we feel strongly that public 
access must be enhanced by providing a hard surface oceanfront sidewalk 
(between the homes and the water)." 
</P>
<P>
But many residents on both sides of the current concrete path have said that 
they object to the extension. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a different world down there, where the boardwalk is, and I wouldn't 
want to live there," Spruill said. "We've lived here 19 years, and my son, who 
is in a wheelchair, he said that he probably couldn't live here if the sidewalk 
went through." 
</P>
<P>
Peninsula Point residents oppose the concrete path so strongly that they told 
their homeowners' association that they would give up their encroachments 
rather than put up with the increased congestion and noise of the walkway. 
</P>
<P>
"I oppose a boardwalk because of all the attendant problems that go along with 
a boardwalk -- the litter, the noise, the increased policing problems that the 
city has to deal with," said Charles Munns, a west Newport resident who will 
also have to move his retaining wall in by two feet. He added that beach-goers 
in west Newport are more limited by lack of parking than by access to the sand. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the yearlong debate on the encroachments, the council heard from 
many people on both sides of the sidewalk extension issue. But at Monday's 
meeting, council members emphasized that they would not consider approving an 
extension simply because the Coastal Commission staff recommends it. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw a video in here the other night (of the boardwalk) . . . and it's a sad 
situation," said Councilman Phil Sansone. "It's an accident looking for a place 
to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"And regarding an edict from the Coastal Commission, I have serious doubts that 
the state can dictate on a municipality without coming up with some money to 
pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Cobb, who headed a citizen's task force to study the problem for more 
than a year, said he doesn't expect the commission to reject the plan outright. 
</P>
<P>
"I do think the Coastal Commission will adopt whatever the city goes up there 
with," Cobb said. But, he added, "the Coastal Commission could tie us up for a 
long time if they don't agree with our plans for enhancing beach access." 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners have one year to trim their patios and decks to comply with the new 
regulations, which include an annual permit fee of $300 to $600. Property 
owners from 36th Street to the mouth of the Santa Ana River will be allowed to 
keep their patios and small decks as long as they do not extend more than 15 
feet onto the public right of way. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners in the Peninsula Point district, which begins at about F Street and 
stretches as far west as the Wedge, have said that they will voluntarily remove 
any patios or decks on the beach. Residents of homes between A Street and F 
Street will be allowed 7 1/2 feet of patio decking, from their property lines 
to the concrete path, the council decided. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very satisfied," said Sterling Wolfe, who will have to slice one foot off 
his deck. "There was plenty of time for public input and plenty of time for 
debate." 
</P>
<P>
City staff will now prepare the final wording of the encroachment policy, said 
City Manager Robert L. Wynn, and the Coastal Commission will then set public 
hearings on the matter.

homeowners who live on beachfront land on Newport Beach have one year to trim 
their patios and decks to comply with the new encroachment regulations. The 
properties were found to be encroaching on the public right of way. The issue

A Fullerton police officer has received an Award of Valor from the California 
State Firemen's Assn. for his heroic efforts in saving three people from a 
burning car last New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Steve Bair, 30, who has been on the force for seven years, received the 
award early this month. 
</P>
<P>
Also receiving awards for their assistance in the rescue were John Lamkin of 
Fullerton and K.C. Schwarz, a former Fullerton resident who now lives in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
The three were nominated for an award by Capt. Tom Metcalfe of the Fullerton 
Fire Department, who was part of the company that responded to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what they did was tremendous," Metcalfe said. "If it hadn't been for 
Steve and the two other citizens, there is no doubt in my mind that the three 
people in that car would have died." 
</P>
<P>
At 4 p.m. on New Year's Eve, Bair was taking a report on an earlier traffic 
accident that had occurred at the intersection of Harbor Boulevard and La 
Entrada Place. He heard skidding tires and looked up to see a station wagon 
slam into a tree, trapping the driver and two passengers inside. Immediately 
after impact, the car's engine caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
Running to the car, Bair was able to pull one of the occupants, who was 
unconscious, out of the back seat. A few moments later, Schwarz and Lamkin 
stopped to help Bair, and the three tried to free the driver and the other 
passenger. 
</P>
<P>
After they were unable to pull the remaining two from the wreckage, Bair ran 
back to his police car and grabbed a fire extinguisher, and was able to fend 
off the flames until firefighters arrived. 
</P>
<P>
All three victims have since recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Blair, who lives in Ontario, also received the Award of Heroism last May from 
the American Legion for his part in the rescue.ERIK HAMILTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: RADIO AD URGES LATINOS TO VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County radio stations and cable television networks have begun airing an 
advertisement encouraging Latinos to vote and invoking the memory of a 1988 
election incident in which uniformed guards were employed by the Republican 
Party at several heavily Latino precincts in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-second ad, produced in both English and Spanish, does not name any of 
the parties involved in the incident, nor does it urge Latinos to vote any 
particular way. 
</P>
<P>
"The point of this campaign isn't partisan," said Lowell Finley, a partner in 
the San Francisco law firm of Remcho, Johansen &amp; Purcell, which filed a 
lawsuit on behalf of five Latino voters after the election. "It's simply to 
urge Hispanics to get out the vote." 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the county Republican Party and Garden Grove Assemblyman Curt 
Pringle's 1988 campaign settled the civil lawsuit last year for about $400,000, 
although a criminal investigation is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle, who won a narrow victory in 1988, is facing a tough challenge this 
year from Democrat Tom Umberg, a former federal prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Police Officer Jose Vargas and Jane Fantauzzi, two of five plaintiffs 
in the lawsuit, paid about $44,000 from their share of the settlement to 
produce and distribute the ad. Remcho, Johansen &amp; Purcell contributed 
another $10,000, Finley said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the stations and networks playing the ad are Santa Ana radio station 
KWIZ; KVEA Channel 52 in Los Angeles; Santa Ana-based Comcast Cablevision and 
Garden Grove-based Paragon Cable. BOB SCHWARTZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTY DELAY URGED ON JAIL-BOOKING FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and GEORGE FRANK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of nearly every city in Orange County asked the Board of 
Supervisors on Tuesday to reverse field and postpone imposing a controversial 
jail-booking fee intended to raise $2 million next year. 
</P>
<P>
The board took no action but is expected to vote on the matter next month. 
</P>
<P>
"We implore you today to defer the jail-booking fee until July 1 of next year, 
and we will help you identify other potential sources for this revenue," Irvine 
Mayor Sally Anne Sheridan told the supervisors. "We strongly believe there are 
alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
The fee, which the board approved in principle in August, would charge cities 
and other agencies $75.50 for every inmate they book into County Jail. If 
imposed in January as planned, that would raise $2.1 million needed to balance 
the county's budget this year. 
</P>
<P>
The county was allowed to begin charging that fee as part of a budget package 
from Sacramento, which stripped the county of millions of dollars in funds but 
gave it authority to levy several new fees. 
</P>
<P>
While the jail fee would give the county badly needed funds to pay for 
services, it is likely to create serious hardships for some city governments. 
Cities have already passed their budgets for this year, and some would be asked 
to absorb hundreds of thousands of dollars in cuts in order to cope with the 
new fees. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, cities have loudly objected to the plan, accusing the Legislature 
and governor of pitting local governments against one another as they scramble 
to make up shortfalls caused by the state government. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, who called the state's action "a cynical trick 
of trickling this problem down," urged supervisors to reject the fee and join 
with cities in lobbying lawmakers in Sacramento to reverse themselves on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
During the session, the supervisors were noncommittal, and board Chairman Don 
R. Roth asked his colleagues to refrain from responding until the matter is 
before the board for a vote. That issue is expected to come before the 
supervisors in November. 
</P>
<P>
But after the meeting, several supervisors said they share the cities' concerns 
and hope that the Legislature can be persuaded to provide some relief for local 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
"It may give us an opportunity to make a statement," Supervisor Gaddi H. 
Vasquez said. "The statement is, 'We're not going to take this kind of abuse 
any more from the state Legislature.' " 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez, once a city of Orange police officer, complained that Sacramento 
lawmakers are "balancing their budget on the backs of the cities and counties." 
</P>
<P>
Echoing his sentiments, Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said: "This is a battle 
that we have to do together. I think it is a flag around which we can rally." 
</P>
<P>
The more immediate issue for the county, however, is how to pay for this year's 
budget, and so far no proposal is on the table to replace the $2.1 million it 
would lose if it deferred the booking fee. JIM NEWTON and GEORGE FRANK

OCEAN VIEW DISTRICT TO BAN SMOKING AT ALL ITS FACILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ocean View School District Board of Trustees voted 3 to 2 Tuesday night to 
make the district the first in Orange County to ban smoking at all its schools 
and other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees' smoke-free policy, which becomes effective Feb. 1, prohibits 
anyone from smoking during school hours or during district-sponsored events 
anywhere at Ocean View's 17 schools, district administrative offices, 
maintenance yard and transportation facility. 
</P>
<P>
The prohibition eliminates smoking areas now designated at some of the 
district's schools and other facilities for teachers, administrators, 
custodians and other employees. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees Carolyn Hunt and Janet Garrick backed away from their previous support 
of the ban, saying they believe employees should still be able to smoke at 
designated outdoor areas. 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the smoking prohibition, the board agreed to schedule 
American Cancer Society clinics to help employee and parent smokers who want to 
kick the habit. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View's decision marks the latest example of a growing anti-smoking 
movement among the nation's school districts the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
According to a 1989 survey by the National School Boards Assn., 17% of school 
districts nationwide adopted policies last year banning tobacco use. Among 
those was the Riverside Unified School District, whose smoking prohibition 
served as a model for Ocean View's policy. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District is scheduled Nov. 15 to enact a similar 
smoke-free policy, which its board adopted last month. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the Fountain Valley School District currently has the most 
stringent anti-smoking policy. It forbids anyone from smoking inside 
district-owned buildings, but allows employees to smoke at designated outdoor 
areas as long as they are out of the sight of children. 
</P>
<P>
Among the county's higher-education districts, only the Coast Community College 
District prohibits smoking on all its properties. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View's smoking ban is largely a symbolic statement to show students the 
district opposes tobacco use, trustees said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the district's 800 employees, only about 60 are smokers, according to an 
informal poll conducted in the past month by John Thomas, the district's 
administrator of pupil personnel. And, aside from 15 teachers who smoke, the 
other employee smokers rarely, if ever, are in the presence of children, Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're talking about here is a public health issue," said Trustee Sheila 
Marcus, who proposed the smoking ban. "It is a statement that says if smoking 
is unhealthy for children, it's unhealthy for adults," 
</P>
<P>
Like most other school districts that have prohibited smoking, Ocean View faced 
only a diminutive pocket of resistence to its policy. A small group of 
maintenance workers who smoke argued the smoke-free rule should not be extended 
to the maintenance yard and other district sites where no children are present. 
</P>
<P>
In the coming weeks, district officials will continue finalizing details of the 
smoke-free policy. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators will continue negotiating with representatives from the 
district's two labor unions to decide how to enforce the ban and how violators 
will be reprimanded, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Ocean View is awaiting a legal ruling from the County Department 
of Education to determine whether to extend the ban to former school sites the 
district now leases. Many of those properties are used as day-care centers, and 
one has been developed as an apartment complex.

THREAT TO LAGUNA CANYON FUNDING DOWNPLAYED; 
</P>
<P>
GREENBELT: THE PROPOSED $10-MILLION COUNTY ANTE TOWARD THE LAGUNA LAUREL PLAN 
AND CITY'S OPPOSITION TO A COUNTY-FAVORED TOLLWAY COULD ROCK THE BOAT. 
</P>

Laguna Beach city officials Tuesday downplayed a threat by Supervisor Thomas F. 
Riley to block a $10-million contribution to help purchase 2,150 acres of 
Laguna Canyon if the city sues to halt the proposed San Joaquin Hills 
Transportation Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
But they conceded that Riley's comments concerning the tollway -- long opposed 
by the city because of environmental concerns -- threatened to upset the city's 
campaign for a $20-million bond measure on the Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
That bond measure and the expected $10-million donation from the county are key 
elements in the city's bid to purchase the Laguna Laurel tract for $78 million 
from the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
Riley's remarks that he may try to withhold the $10-million county donation 
came after he became concerned that Laguna Beach officials might still try to 
fight the tollway project even if they acquired Laguna Laurel. 
</P>
<P>
He said that while the city had the right to oppose the toll road by 
challenging the environmental impact report, comments by Mayor Lida Lenney 
indicated that the city might sue the county to block construction. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not think the constituents in Orange County would be very happy about the 
county giving money to a community that later sues the county," Riley said. "I 
support enthusiastically the idea of Laguna Laurel, but I am also committed to 
the fact that the corridor has to go through." 
</P>
<P>
Riley's district includes the canyon area, and he has long been at odds with 
Laguna Beach officials over the need for a new tollway to cut through the 
canyon to relieve congestion on the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Riley added that while he could not prevent environmentalists from filing a 
lawsuit to stop the toll road, he did not think it would be right for Laguna 
Beach to sue the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We are surprised and concerned," Michael Phillips, executive director of two 
environmental groups involved in the land purchase negotiations, said of 
Riley's comments. 
</P>
<P>
Lenney said Tuesday that she has not threatened a lawsuit and that the city has 
no plans at this time to take the county to court. The mayor said the city has 
only hired a consultant to advise it on the tollway's environmental impact 
report. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lenney said it was unlikely that the city could promise before the 
Nov. 6 election not to sue in exchange for the county's $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a new council that's going to be seated in December and that council 
will have a say on what the city does. There's no way that I, as one of five 
members of the City Council, can say 'yea' or 'nay' about this," Lenney said. 
</P>
<P>
All parties involved in the negotiations to buy the land and block the proposed 
3,200-unit development by the Irvine Co. -- including the city and county -- 
had agreed that the future of the tollway would be considered as a separate 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
And while the City Council is still officially on record as opposing the 
tollway -- it would be built along the southern edge of the Laguna Laurel site 
-- City Councilman Robert F. Gentry has hinted that the city would consider 
compromising if the bond proposal receives the required two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists said they did not recall the county attaching any conditions 
to its tentative approval in September of the $10-million donation, but Riley 
said he made that stipulation several months ago to Lenney and Gentry during a 
private meeting with Irvine Co. Chairman Donald L. Bren. He added that because 
the county's approval is tentative, both sides are not expected to negotiate 
the terms of the county's contribution until after the election. 
</P>
<P>
While county supervisors traditionally defer to one another on special projects 
in a member's district, it is not known whether Riley's threat to withhold the 
money would be sustained by the full board given the widespread sentiment in 
favor of saving the canyon from development. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed purchase of the $30.2-million development agreem related to the 
corridor. 
</P>
<P>
"We understood that was a commitment to the county that the (Irvine) company 
was going to honor," bond campaign manager Paul Freeman said. "We also 
understood they (the supervisors) were interested in contributing to the 
purchase of the land independent of the corridor issue." 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent effort to downplay the threatened loss of county funds, which 
are scheduled to be dispersed in $2-million installments over a five-year 
period, Freeman said the city had time to come up with another revenue source 
before the first payment is due to the Irvine Co. next June. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials representing the city, county, the state parks department 
and environmental groups met Tuesday in a brainstorming session with land 
conservation and bond consultants to explore open space revenue sources. 
</P>
<P>
Members attending the meeting convened by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach) zeroed in on one proposal to create a benefits assessment district for 
the preservation of open space countywide, with every property owner in the 
county being assessed a flat fee. A similar proposal was approved last year by 
the state Legislature for Riverside County.

COUNCIL DEADLOCKED ON PIERSIDE PROJECT

<P>
After four hours of heated debate, the city Planning Commission on Tuesday 
night deadlocked 3 to 3 on the Pierside Village project, forcing continuation 
of discussions of the controversial development at the commission's next 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel it's a political pork barrel issue that we are being rousted into 
making a decision on," Commissioner Barry Williams said in explaining why he 
voted against the project. "I don't know why we have to have these things 
shoved down our throats like this." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Williams, commission Chairwoman Geri Ortega and Commissioner 
Victor Leipzig voted against the project, saying they feared it would increase 
traffic on Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Ken Bourguignon was absent. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which is planned for the area immediately south of the Municipal 
Pier, will be brought back before the commission at its next meeting on Nov. 6 
-- Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have charged that the project's developer, Jonathan Chodos, has 
pressured commissioners and council members to approve his plans before the 
election. City voters will elect successors to three councilmen who strongly 
support the project and will decide on a charter amendment that would prohibit 
the sale or lease of city beach or parkland without a citizens' vote. 
</P>
<P>
Chodos denied that he has lobbied for quick approval but acknowledged that he 
would like to see the project approved before the election. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that city planners have repeatedly revised and delayed the project 
during the past 18 months, Chodos said: "I feel this project has already been 
victimized enough, and I would prefer it not be further victimized by the 
political process. And if that means getting this done before Nov. 6 . . . then 
that's what I'd like to see happen." 
</P>
<P>
The Pierside Village proposal has sharply divided council members, planning 
commissioners and city residents since the council adopted its concept in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, it was envisioned as an 87,500-square-foot complex of several 
restaurants and 60 retail shops. A scaled-back version calls for between three 
and five restaurants, including the reconstruction of Maxwell's Restaurant, 
along with promenades and plazas totaling about 48,500 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which would also include a parking structure providing more than 
600 spaces, is planned for 3.5 acres of land that is now used as street-level 
parking. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents tout Pierside Village as the centerpiece of the city's ongoing 
downtown redevelopment. They say the project would attract more visitors, 
bolster revenue for the city and, because of its promenades and plazas, would 
provide ocean views. 
</P>
<P>
A large, vocal group of critics, however, has rallied to oppose the project, 
charging that the 25-foot-tall buildings would block ocean views and ruin the 
beach's natural atmosphere.

COUNTY'S AIRPORT NOISE LAW SEEMS SAFE FOR NOW; 
</P>
<P>
AVIATION: CONGRESSIONAL PASSAGE OF NEW POLICY THAT WOULD EASE O.C. LIMITS IS 
UNLIKELY THIS YEAR BUT ISN'T DEAD YET, INSIDERS SAY. COUNTY OFFICIALS ARE 
FIGHTING TO STOP IT.

<P>
Congressional passage of a new national airport noise policy that has outraged 
John Wayne Airport officials appears increasingly unlikely this year, but the 
proposal is not yet dead, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The noise policy is included in aviation legislation that also contains a plan 
to levy new fees on passengers. The entire package ran aground Tuesday in a 
House-Senate conference because of a last-minute flap over landing "slots" at 
East Coast airports. 
</P>
<P>
"The deal is off," said Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), referring to a 
tentative agreement that might have led to passage of a noise policy this year. 
Cox strongly opposes the noise provisions. 
</P>
<P>
But key congressional aides said that it was too early to pronounce the 
agreement dead and that a deal that would include a national noise policy 
remains possible in the next day or two. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials in recent weeks have lobbied heavily against the noise 
proposal. They contend that granting noise-control authority to the federal 
government would upset a delicately balanced, 5-year-old agreement on 
commercial flight schedules and noise levels that has permitted the expansion 
of county-owned John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think the federal government should be able to come in with a policy 
that totally tosses out what took years to negotiate, particularly when it's 
working so successfully," said Jan Mittermeier, the airport manager. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Congress fails to enact a noise policy this year, it is almost certain 
that the issue will be revived when the 102nd Congress convenes in January, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner and the major airlines favor 
development of a national airport noise policy to lend consistency to what 
critics describe as a hodgepodge of local rules and regulations at airports 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
A central issue facing Congress is the extent to which a new national policy 
would leave in place, or "grandfather," existing airport noise policies. Such 
policies were developed in recent years at perhaps two dozen American airports 
as exploding residential development pushed housing closer and closer to flight 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
At John Wayne Airport, airlines are barred from operating the noisiest, or 
Stage II aircraft, such as Boeing 747s. In addition, outgoing flights may take 
off no earlier than 7 a.m. and no later than 10 p.m., while incoming flights 
may not land after 11 p.m. The agreement was reached in 1985 as part of an 
out-of-court settlement of a series of longstanding lawsuits that sought to 
block expansion of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the aviation subcommittee of the House Public Works and 
Transportation Committee held hearings on what panel members thought would be 
an effort to enact a noise policy sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
But the effort was short-circuited when Sen. Wendell H. Ford (D-Ky.) introduced 
legislation in the Senate to mandate a national airport noise policy as well as 
the new passenger fees, known as passenger facility charges. The fees, sought 
by the Bush Administration, would help airports pay for needed capital 
improvement projects and at the same time reduce airport dependence on federal 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The Ford legislation, a reauthorization measure that would extend the life of 
the Federal Aviation Administration, ultimately was attached to the Senate 
version of the federal budget bill. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Ford bill contained language that exempted, at least temporarily, 
existing local noise policies from federal review, it set off a storm of 
protest among local officials who were concerned that the grandfather 
provisions were not strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Senate and House negotiators began meeting to iron out the 
differences between the FAA reauthorization bill passed by the Senate and an 
earlier version passed by the House. The House bill contained language creating 
the passenger fees, but not the noise policy. 
</P>
<P>
Some House members, such as Cox, opposed enactment of a noise policy this year, 
contending that the policy should be fully aired at public hearings and in 
legislative debate. But others, including Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), were 
willing to accept a noise policy as long as its grandfather provisions were 
stronger than those contained in the Senate bill. 
</P>
<P>
Mittermeier said Orange County officials were satisfied with toughened 
grandfather language drafted by House negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had some pretty good language in there to protect John Wayne and 
some of the other airports," she said. "I think it would be kind of 
disappointing if this all goes away and we have to do it all over again" next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The House-Senate negotiations were scuttled Tuesday, but neither the passenger 
fees nor the noise policy was to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), one of the Senate negotiators, had insisted on 
including a provision that would have expanded the number of "slots" available 
to airlines at La Guardia Airport in New York City and National Airport in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
La Guardia, National, O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and Los Angeles 
International Airport are the only four airports in the country that operate 
under a system in which airlines are allotted "slots" by the FAA to control 
airport congestion. Since 1985, airlines have been permitted to sell their 
slots, and some have fetched prices of up to $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
McCain's move was widely seen in Congress as an attempt to assist America West, 
a Phoenix-based airline that for years has struggled to break into the 
congested airports. 
</P>
<P>
House negotiators were adamantly opposed to handing out more slots to benefit a 
single business interest, congressional aides said, while the Senate 
negotiators have said they must accommodate McCain. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning, Ford officially rejected a House offer that included 
language creating a noise policy and passenger facility charges, but not 
additional airline slots. Several aides said that House and Senate negotiators 
are close on the passenger fee and noise policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a holding pattern," said one Senate aide.

RUNNING ASSAULT UNEARTHED

Philadelphia Coach Buddy Ryan, who pays close attention to these things, said 
last month the Rams were one of the league's most physical teams. It's a 
reputation they built primarily with a punishing running game and an offensive 
line that routinely manhandled opponents. 
</P>
<P>
But the combination of a potent passing attack and a propensity for falling 
behind early had reduced the vaunted Ram running game to afterthought status 
this season. Then came Sunday's game against Atlanta and a 102-yard performance 
by Cleveland Gary, and the Ram offensive line suddenly became a dominant force 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the game just dictates what you have to do," guard Duval Love said. 
"When you get down 21 points, obviously, you have to throw the ball. You can't 
do a lot of physical run blocking. But when we get a chance to mix it up, we 
can get back to the physical style we used to be known for. 
</P>
<P>
"We still need to polish up a lot of aspects of our game, but maybe we got all 
the bad stuff out of us, and now we can get our rhythm going and keep rolling 
toward the end of the year. Maybe we can climb up the mountain now." 
</P>
<P>
Tackle Jackie Slater said a renewed emphasis on fundamentals and some good, 
old-fashioned head-slamming in practice might have revived the line. 
</P>
<P>
"We work hard all the time at trying to win the physical battle up front," he 
said, "but one of the keys for us has been going back to the basics on the 
practice field. We have really been coming off on one another on the practice 
field, and we expect now to get it done in the games." 
</P>
<P>
Gary, who ran through a number of tackles Sunday, was an important factor, of 
course. He had the Rams' first 100-yard effort this season despite playing just 
4 1/2 minutes of the fourth quarter. The Rams -- who had averaged just 79 
rushing yards in their previous three games -- finished with 129. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for all of us to remember we can do that," Coach John Robinson 
said. "We all see the benefits of the mixture between pass and run. To see the 
back run the ball like that was good for all of us, too. That was as good a 
running performance as any of us have seen." 
</P>
<P>
Slater, speaking for the entire offensive front, would like to put an 
exclamation point on that. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's safe to say we're all very excited to have Cleveland Gary," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It's also safe to say that no one is more elated about Sunday's turn of events 
than Gary, who has suffered from a lower-back injury that kept him out of 
action all summer and through the first regular-season game. He's finally back 
to full speed, and he vented his frustration on a host of would-be tacklers. 
</P>
<P>
"We were up against a team that's very tight against the run, so I think this 
does a lot for the self-esteem of everyone," Gary said Sunday. "We can run the 
ball, and we proved it today. 
</P>
<P>
"During the week, there were a whole lot of questions running through the guys' 
minds. We're such a talented club, picked to do this and that. The only answer 
was to go out and keep working hard, keeping kicking at the door. Today, we 
finally kicked it in." 
</P>
<P>
Few, if any, NFL coaches maintain a better relationship with the media than 
Robinson. So even this rather tame reprimand issued Monday at his weekly press 
luncheon might have surprised some: 
</P>
<P>
"We all have a tendency to read or hear something and say, 'that's true, and 
therefore everybody must be thinking that way.' But that isn't always the case. 
. . . You don't get players' real feelings. You get their responses to your 
specific questions. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems that happens when things are going poorly is you stop 
thinking. You're put in a position of having to defend yourself. You wind up 
turning around to fight off the battles, and you stop doing the things that you 
normally do. 
</P>
<P>
"In the course of the last month, a couple of coaches have been attacked in 
terms of being in jeopardy of losing their jobs, and those are difficult things 
to deal with. When you begin to slide, you have to fight off a lot of ghosts 
that are hard to fight off." 
</P>
<P>
The defense is beginning to come together, thanks in large part to the healing 
process. Mike Piel, a second-year defensive tackle whose progress has been 
slowed by a sore elbow that was dislocated twice last season, is an example. 
Piel had five tackles and a sack against the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
"He played very well," Robinson said. "I think he's played quite well the last 
two weeks. He's finally back to being himself. Before that, he was playing like 
he was a one-armed guy." 
</P>
<P>
Piel was making steady progress last season before dislocating his left elbow 
Dec. 3 in a game against the Cowboys. He returned to the starting lineup for 
the wild-card playoff game at Philadelphia, batted down two of Phil Simms' 
passes in the NFC divisional playoff game against the Giants and then reinjured 
the elbow early in the NFC championship game at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as my arm and my confidence level goes, I feel great," Piel said. "It's 
only my second year, and nobody's perfect in this game. It's a hard game to be 
perfect in, but I have to just keep plugging away and trying to get better each 
week." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
After falling behind, 21-0 and 31-0, in consecutive weeks, how did Coach John 
Robinson feel when the Falcons jumped out to a 10-0 lead Sunday? "At Chicago, 
we were saying, 'What the hell is going on?' But this time, it was too scary a 
thing to contemplate. It was 'Nah, nah, nah, we're OK, we're OK.' We talked all 
week about how it would be that kind (of high-scoring) game, and a short swing 
would not affect it. But that's all bull, because I was scared to death." . . . 
Just in case you were wondering what Robinson said to safety Michael Stewart, 
who tackled Atlanta's Andre Rison about 10 yards after he had crossed into the 
end zone for a 71-yard touchdown: "Where we've been in the past, you say, 
'Well, you ran into a guy. Good. Just try to do it on the field next time.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nickel and Dime Dept.: How important is having the right situational defense on 
the field? Said Robinson: "The league has gotten into an area of specialization 
where if you put (New York Giants linebacker) Lawrence Taylor, the best 
defensive player in America, man-to-man on Andre Rison, Andre Rison will catch, 
oh, 30 passes in a game for 20 touchdowns. Taylor would have no chance. Getting 
matched up is an element of strategy that didn't use to be part of the game. 
(Now), you have to create matchups that fit."

SECTION HAS HANDS-OFF POLICY ON FUND-RAISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Southern Section has no rules regulating fund-raising, according to 
publicist Scott Cathcart. 
</P>
<P>
A school can raise as much money as it likes and spend it however it wants. 
</P>
<P>
"The only recommendation we make is that someone from the school's athletic 
department be directly involved in the fund-raising process," Cathcart said. 
</P>
<P>
There are rules regarding bonuses to players and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
A school can't give a team's most valuable player $5,000 or a new car, t for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
And the team's coach cannot be paid directly with money generated by 
fund-raisers. But there is a simple way to legally circumvent that rule. The 
booster club can donate the money to the school district, which then could give 
that coach a raise. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, however, schools might have to give the state a slice. 
</P>
<P>
The State Board of Equalization ruled last February that a Monterey high school 
wrestling team must pay a sales tax on the thousands of dollars it made selling 
fried calamari. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-2 decision cleared the way for taxes on fund-raising for high school 
sports. ELLIOTT TEAFORD

COACHES' DUTIES ALSO INCLUDE RAISING MONEY FOR THEIR TEAMS 
</P>

<P>
John deFries was a seven-year assistant line coach at Rancho Santiago College 
before he was named to replace Herb Hill as the varsity football coach at Loara 
High School last spring. 
</P>
<P>
DeFries expected a transition from simply wearing a cap and whistle and 
coaching at Rancho Santiago to becoming "a part-time parent, baby-sitter, 
academic adviser and personal counselor" when he accepted the coaching job at 
Loara. 
</P>
<P>
And deFries has added another title to his long list of duties: fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to be a fund-raiser just to survive these days," he said. "The 
funds you receive from the Associated Student Body (ASB) can't possibly cover 
all the expenses incurred by a football program." 
</P>
<P>
DeFries' first task was to help organize a jogathon last spring. Loara's 
coaches asked each of the program's 75 players to get 10 pledges each from 
relatives, friends and neighbors to help buy new game jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
The players ran laps and earned about $2,000. The event was so successful that 
deFries is planning a liftathon this spring, in which his players will lift 
weights for pledges. 
</P>
<P>
While the majority of the student body took the summer off, deFries had his 
team competing in a summer passing league at El Dorado and an eight-team 
tournament at Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
DeFries charged each player a $50 participation fee. That helped to pay a 
$1,000 coaching stipend for two assistants who aided deFries. 
</P>
<P>
"I did some checking and found out we were undercharging the kids for our 
summer program," deFries said. "Most schools charge between $75-$100. Mater Dei 
is getting $150. I'm sure we'll go up next summer, because we plan on playing 
in Rancho Santiago's summer tournament." 
</P>
<P>
When the season began, deFries played host to Wednesday night booster club 
meetings, in which he reviews game films from the previous week. The booster 
board raffles prizes and a game ball, usually earning $50. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-50 drawing on game nights usually earns about $100, and Loara's football 
program splits a $1 fee for those who attend a party at an Anaheim pizza parlor 
after each home game. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't sound like a lot of money, but it all adds up," deFries said. 
</P>
<P>
School administrators are hoping bingo, added this summer on campus, will 
become a big money-making proposition. Loara's band boosters started the 
program off-campus a couple of years ago but it failed. 
</P>
<P>
DeFries estimates the games are drawing 175 players and netting $1,500 to 
$2,000 each week. 
</P>
<P>
"Our football booster board is helping out and will get a share of the profits 
depending upon how many volunteers show up each week," he said. "We're still 
paying off the equipment, but I'm hoping we'll start seeing some profits soon." 
</P>
<P>
Loara's football boosters budgeted about $4,000 for any additional expenses 
deFries might incur during the season. The money was raised selling 
advertisements for the game programs. 
</P>
<P>
DeFries has given the boosters one bill for 25 game-day shirts for his coaching 
staff and another for seven game films at $65 each. 
</P>
<P>
"I never bargained to be just a coach when I took this job," he said. "I knew 
that going in. You're more than a coach at this level, and helping to raise 
money to keep your program on top is just part of the job."

WOODBRIDGE WOULD LIKE TO RECLAIM ITS PRESTIGIOUS POST, CRITTERS AND ALL

Termites. 
</P>
<P>
As defined by Webster's, these little critters are "pale-colored insects having 
a soft body and living in colonies composed of winged forms (and) very 
destructive to wooden structures." 
</P>
<P>
Creepy? Crawly? Totally disgusting? 
</P>
<P>
Quite so. 
</P>
<P>
But in Irvine, termites are a integral part of the Fence Post Trophy, the 
prestigious -- albeit cruddy -- piece of wood awarded each year to the city's 
top high school football team. 
</P>
<P>
Since the award was initiated 12 years ago, hungry termites have called it 
home. Others just call it hideous. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically," Woodbridge Coach Rick Gibson said, "it looks like an ugly old 
piece of fencing that someone decided to pick up and varnish. There's a plaque 
(on the base) that says which team has won it every year, but outside of that, 
it's very, very ugly." 
</P>
<P>
But it's coveted nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at 7:30, Woodbridge will have a chance to reclaim the Fence Post, 
which it held from 1985 through 1988. The Warriors play University at Irvine 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, which beat University in the season opener, was upset by Woodbridge two 
weeks ago. If University beats Woodbridge Friday, a three-way tie will result, 
forcing the Fence Post to its neutral location -- a local movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
But a Woodbridge victory would make the Warriors the city champions once again. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an intracity game," Gibson said. "Records, rankings mean nothing. 
Nothing else matters." 
</P>
<P>
Not even the bugs. 
</P>
<P>
The trophy was actually renamed the Dennis Toohey Fence Post Trophy this year 
in honor of a longtime Irvine football coach. Toohey coached many of the 
players on the Irvine, Woodbridge and University teams. 
</P>
<P>
Best matchup for the Woodbridge-University game is on the line, where 
Woodbridge's Dae Kim meets University's Brian Riggs. 
</P>
<P>
Kim is 5-feet-5, 180. Riggs is 5-6, 160. 
</P>
<P>
"We call it 'The Battle of the Smurfs,' " Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
During his recruiting visit to Duke last weekend, Marina's Cherokee Parks was 
sitting next to 8-year-old Jamie Krzyzewski, daughter of Blue Devil Coach Mike 
Krzyzewski, at a team scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie watched Parks, a 6-foot-11 center, try unsuccessfully to break a small, 
pen-sized piece of plastic in half. 
</P>
<P>
She grabbed the piece of plastic from Parks. "If I break it in half, will you 
come to Duke?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, you have six minutes," Parks told her. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie twisted, bent, ripped and pulled. No good. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad's gonna be real proud of me when I get you to come here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But after six minutes, the plastic was still intact. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. Parks made an oral commitment to Duke Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie, who spent two hours on the task, sent the broken pieces to Parks as a 
souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
Leigh Steinberg, sports attorney to the stars, will be the key speaker at 
tonight's fall meeting of the Orange County Athletic Directors. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting starts at 6 p.m. at the Stadium Club at Anaheim Stadium. For 
information, call Katella Athletic Director Tom Danley at 999-3647. 
</P>
<P>
As a fifth-year assistant to Newport Harbor water polo Coach Bill Barnett, Dean 
Crow knows what it's like to coach in one of the county's powerhouse programs. 
</P>
<P>
But he also knows the other side. 
</P>
<P>
Crow, 24, also is athletic director and girls' volleyball coach at tiny Pacific 
Shores High, a private school in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
At Newport Harbor, there are 40 players in the water polo program. 
</P>
<P>
At Pacific Shores, there are 36 students. 
</P>
<P>
At Newport, each position is three or four players deep. 
</P>
<P>
At Pacific Shores, four girls went out for volleyball last year. The school did 
manage to draw enough to put together a team this season. 
</P>
<P>
At Newport Harbor, the Sailors have at one time or another been among the 
county's best in football, water polo, swimming, volleyball, tennis, soccer, 
cross-country, track. . . . 
</P>
<P>
At Pacific Shores, the only sports offered are girls' volleyball, boys' 
basketball and co-ed baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, there are definitely differences," Crow said. "The biggest is probably 
that Pacific Shores has never had to forfeit a game (because of an ineligible 
athlete)." 
</P>
<P>
Crow helps out with the morning workouts at Newport Harbor and attends games, 
then coaches Pacific Shores volleyball four afternoons a week. If there's a 
conflict, he goes with the girls' volleyball team.

Both coaches described it as a must-win situation, but in reality the men's 
soccer match between The Master's College and Cal Lutheran was more a 
must-not-lose. 
</P>
<P>
Neither did. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran and Master's played to a 1-1 tie after a 30-minute overtime in an 
NAIA District 3 match at Master's on Tuesday. Both teams came out believing 
they had helped their chances for a berth in the district playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"This sealed it," said Master's Coach Mark Schubert, whose team apparently will 
be the highest-seeded District 3 independent. 
</P>
<P>
"I think as far as playoffs, it gives us a shot," Cal Lutheran Coach George 
Kuntz said. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran (11-3-2, 5-1-2 in district play) has a loss to fellow independent 
Biola in addition to its tie with Master's, but the Kingsmen nonetheless are 
hoping a strong overall record also will merit an independent berth in the 
six-team tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs (6-9-4, 2-1-2) have seen their record suffer because of several 
matches with NCAA Division I teams, but they have beaten Biola. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran scored first on a goal by Casey Pirih about two-thirds of the way 
through the first half. Teammate Jeff Popour hit the right pole with a shot 
that ricocheted back toward the middle of the goal mouth, and Pirih came 
sliding in to chip the ball over goalie Allan Bowden. It was Pirih's fifth goal 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Master's tied the score two minutes before halftime on a shot by Chris Palm, 
who leads the district in goals and is among the national NAIA leaders. Palm 
picked up a long pass from Russ Spencer and scored his 15th goal on a 
left-footed grounder that skipped by Cal Lutheran goalie Eddie Guerricabetia. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer was playing his first match of the season after breaking his leg in a 
summer motorcycling accident. However, Master's was missing high-scoring Randy 
Whitfield, who sat out the match because of a previous red card, and Ezekiel 
Bongarra, who left the match with an injury. 
</P>
<P>
Pirih also missed part of the match, leaving on a red-card ejection with about 
15 minutes remaining in regulation. Thus CLU had to play the remainder of the 
match a man down. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to change our tactics completely," Kuntz said. "Defensively, we had to 
play very safe. . . . To leave one of their forwards alone would be suicidal." 
</P>
<P>
CLU actually outshot Master's, 4-2, in the first 15 minutes of overtime. After 
a break, Master's had six shots on goal, including a Palm floater that 
Guerricabetia barely tipped over the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish we would have finished better," Schubert said. "Some days it's not 
going to go in."

LANCERS WIN SHOWDOWN WITH ROYAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As the Thousand Oaks High girls' volleyball team broke from its huddle before 
the third game of Tuesday night's Marmonte League showdown at Royal, the 
players shook with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
Were the Lancers nervous because they trailed, two games to none? No, actually, 
they were feeling a bit giggly. 
</P>
<P>
"We went out (onto the court) laughing," outside hitter Aimee Stone said. "We 
do so much better when we're having fun." 
</P>
<P>
Laughter turned out to be the Lancers' best medicine. Thousand Oaks, ranked 
fifth in the Southern Section 5-A Division, took the next three games to win 
the match, 15-17, 8-15, 15-9, 15-2, 15-11. 
</P>
<P>
Royal, ranked 10th in the 5-A Division, took a 7-1 lead in the fifth game 
before Thousand Oaks (14-1, 11-0 in league play) made its second serve. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders (11-2, 9-2) served with an 11-9 lead, but Erikka Gulbranson's 
spike forced a sideout. 
</P>
<P>
Gulbranson sandwiched two of her game-high five aces around a Cindy McKinnon 
kill to give Thousand Oaks a 12-11 lead. A Royal error and two more McKinnon 
kills gave Thousand Oaks the match. 
</P>
<P>
Kaili Kimura and Gulbranson each had 17 kills and Stone added 16 for Thousand 
Oaks. Royal's Wende Brown had a match-high 20 kills.

MOORPARK COACH SERVES SUSPENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His team maintained its unblemished record, but Frank Parodi, the Moorpark 
College men's soccer coach, has been punished for having a dispute with a 
referee that led to the termination of a match with two minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Western State Conference Commissioner Aviva Kamin on Monday handed Parodi a 
one-match suspension for his role in a verbal tiff with referee Roger Silva in 
a WSC match on Oct. 12 against Hancock. 
</P>
<P>
Parodi sat out a 4-0 WSC victory over Glendale on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have been worse," Parodi said. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting Moorpark was leading the Hancock match, 2-1, when Silva ended play 
after the argument, which capped a simmering dispute. The Hancock match is 
considered a no-contest and will not count in Moorpark's record of 12-0, 7-0 in 
conference play. If the match has a bearing on conference results, it will be 
replayed at Hancock after the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the decision is great because the kids aren't penalized," said Paul 
Dunham, Moorpark athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Because a member of the school staff had to lead the team, Gary Abraham, 
Moorpark women's basketball coach, was the coach of record Tuesday. But Parodi 
said Peter Schraml, Royal High boys' coach, actually did the coaching. 
</P>
<P>
Silva was not disciplined, Parodi said.

STANLEY BUILDING IRVINE VALLEY PROGRAM FROM GROUND UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phil Stanley, the athletic director at Irvine Valley College, is a man of 
vision. His sight is so acute, in fact, that he can see things that aren't 
there -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
When he looks across the Irvine Valley campus, he points out where the locker 
room, gym and swimming complex will be built during the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
But Stanley also has a sharp focus on the present. After taking the job at 
Irvine in the summer of 1989, he spent most of his first year visiting area 
high schools, trying to get athletes to come to Irvine Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, last summer, Stanley was able to make his first solid move toward 
building the college's sports program: He hired Martin McGrogan to coach its 
first sport, men's soccer. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the results have been beyond all expectations. Irvine Valley is 10-1-6 
and 3-1-5 in the Orange Empire Conference, good for third place. 
</P>
<P>
"It was by no accident that we picked soccer to start with," Stanley said. 
"This is a great area for it, and we felt we could compete right away . . . but 
never like this." 
</P>
<P>
This spring, Irvine Valley will field a women's softball team, to be coached by 
Denise Clayton, who was a graduate assistant at Cal State Fullerton last 
season. And if a available gym can be found, there might even be a men's 
volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
"We would really like to have a full-fledged athletic program here," Stanley 
said. "But we have to start small and build up. That is our philosophy here, to 
do things one at a time with class." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Valley plans to add women's soccer and men's and women's cross-country 
and tennis next season, and plans call for basketball and swimming once 
construction is complete. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is a possibility in the distant future, Stanley said, but football 
isn't even being considered because of the expense and lack of a campus 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley also had a hand in deciding Irvine Valley's nickname. In 1985, when the 
college fielded a soccer team for one season, it was called the Wolverines. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, when it came time to select a new nickname to accompany the new 
sports program, Wolverines, Lasers and Ants were among the finalists. 
</P>
<P>
The thinking behind Ants? Well, Irvine Valley is a feeder school for UC Irvine, 
which is nicknamed the Anteaters, so . . . 
</P>
<P>
The suggestion was quickly thrown out, and the committee settled on Lasers -- a 
name to promote the technical aspects of the school. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's 31-29 loss to Saddleback Saturday dropped the Hornets from second 
to fifth in the weekly Southland Football Poll. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield (6-0), ranked No. 1, has led the poll for five consecutive weeks. 
Moorpark (5-1) is second, Golden West (5-1) third, Mt. San Jacinto (6-0) fourth 
and Fullerton (5-1) fifth. El Camino (5-2) is sixth, Santa Monica (5-1) 
seventh, Antelope Valley (6-0-1) eighth, Rancho Santiago (4-2) ninth and 
Cerritos (4-2) 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago baseball Coach Don Sneddon will run a team of 20 community 
college players from the state this fall in Taiwan. California will represent 
the United States in the world-wide competition between Nov. 20 and Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Local players participating are: Steve Grack, an outfielder from Rancho 
Santiago; Doug McConathy, a first baseman from Cypress; Jason Bates, a 
shortstop from Cypress; Gerad Cawhorn, a third baseman from Golden West, and 
Tom Wilson, an outfielder from Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sam Lopez (118 pounds) and Ken Stegall (190), from Cypress, are top-ranked in 
their weight classes in the latest state wrestling poll. Lopez is 13-0, Stegall 
8-0. . . . Cuesta defeated Orange Coast, 12-11, in overtime Saturday to win the 
Cypress water polo tournament and will most likely move to the top of the next 
state poll. Golden West, which was the top-ranked team, was upset in the 
semifinals, 11-8, by Orange Coast. Golden West defeated Long Beach, 10-8, for 
third. . . . The 14th Rancho Santiago over-the-line baseball tournament is 
scheduled for Nov. 3. The tournament, which costs $35 per three-man team, is 
the only organized one in Southern California in which a baseball is used 
instead of a softball. The tournament takes place on the Rancho Santiago 
baseball field, which is divided in half so two games can take place at once. 
For more information call the Rancho Santiago baseball office at 667-3503.

NAIA IS QUESTIONING BOYUM'S ELIGIBILITY 
</P>

<P>
With only one match remaining in its finest soccer season, Point Loma Nazarene 
(6-6-1) might have to forfeit five of its victories because of the use of an 
ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics is expected to rule sometime 
this week on the eligibility of midfielder Charles Boyum, who played in 10 
matches and scored only one goal. 
</P>
<P>
At question is the interpretation of the rules and whether Boyum should have 
been treated as an incoming freshman or a transfer. 
</P>
<P>
PLNC contends that Boyum is a transfer because he attended a community college 
-- College of Lake County in Grayslake, Ill. -- for a semester before coming to 
PLNC. The NAIA District III eligibility committee, which originally cleared 
Boyum to participate before the season, contends that Boyum should have been 
classified as an incoming freshman since he did not complete the necessary two 
terms to be considered a transfer. As an incoming freshman, Boyum does not meet 
NAIA eligibility requirements. He does as a transfer, however. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an oversight on the form that stated the number of terms he 
completed at the other school," said Nate Wright, chairman of the NAIA District 
III eligibility committee. "We're a screening process, but if there is an 
oversight, that does not whitewash the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made our recommendation to the national committee. What they choose to 
do with it is their business. The recommendation is that (PLNC) played with an 
ineligible player and they should forfeit the games in which he played. I'm 
sure our recommendation is not popular with Point Loma Nazarene, but we have to 
stay within the rules." 
</P>
<P>
Wright categorized the incident as "an opinionated case." 
</P>
<P>
A PLNC spokesman said, "It is a matter of the interpretation of the rule." 
</P>
<P>
When Lesle Gallimore took over as San Diego State women's soccer coach before 
this season, Chuck Clegg, the men's coach who headed the women's program in its 
inaugural season last year, good-naturedly informed her about a certain streak 
the Aztecs have: Never has the school had a losing soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, with the women's team assured of a winning record -- it finished 
7-5-2 after going 5-4 in 1989 -- it was Gallimore's turn to rib Clegg, whose 
team was 7-5-2 at the time. "Now, Chuck, the pressure's on you." 
</P>
<P>
Clegg and the Aztecs held their own, winning two of three matches during the 
week. And with three matches remaining, against St. Mary's, Santa Clara, which 
tied for the NCAA championship last year, and perennial power UCLA, the Aztecs 
are 9-6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Even if SDSU wins those three remaining matches, it probably will not make the 
playoffs for the first time in four seasons, but 1990 will not be a 
disappointing season for Clegg. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased with this year," said Clegg, in his ninth year at SDSU. "We 
had eight new (starters) this year, and we lost some really top-notch players. 
We haven't really been dominated by any one team this year." 
</P>
<P>
Among the seniors last year, Clegg lost World Cup participants Marcelo Balboa 
and Eric Wynalda, goalie Bryan Finnerty and defensive captain Brad Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
As for the women's team and Gallimore, Clegg said: "She did a great job. It was 
hard for her because she didn't have any time to recruit. She had to go with 
what was already here. I look for them to achieve the success the men's team 
has had." 
</P>
<P>
The University of San Diego, 16th in one national poll, will play sixth-ranked 
Santa Clara (10-2-3) Friday night at Torero Stadium in a key West Coast 
Conference soccer match. 
</P>
<P>
A big part of the PLNC women's volleyball team's success this season has been 
the Simpsons. 
</P>
<P>
Not the TV show, but sisters Roberta and Debbie. Roberta is leading the team, 
which last week clinched its first Golden State Athletic Conference title, with 
210 kills and 72 blocks. Debbie is leading in digs (316) and is third in kills 
(177). 
</P>
<P>
Now they might not be as twisted as Bart and Homer, but things can get rather 
confusing with the Crusaders' Simpsons. 
</P>
<P>
Roberta, a sophomore, is younger but taller than Debbie, who is a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Explanation: Roberta, 18 and 6 feet, skipped a grade in junior high school and 
played for PLNC last year. Debbie, 19 and 5-9, redshirted last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that I stopped growing and I'm not so dopey, I might be catching up," 
Roberta said. "But she has always been better in sports. She always got MVP, 
and I never did. Maybe I would have had I stayed with my age group, but I guess 
we'll never know." 
</P>
<P>
Demetrius Laffitte, a standout forward for U.S. International, Grossmont 
College and Monte Vista High, begins his professional basketball career this 
week in Argentina. Laffitte, 6-6, set a USIU record by shooting more than 57% 
from the field and averaging double figures in points and rebounds the past two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
John Jerome, who in his one season at USD set the Toreros' single-season 
scoring record with 504 points, is playing in Holland.

MILKEN LIED ABOUT DEAL, FORMER CHIEF OF DREXEL IMPLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frederick H. Joseph, Drexel Burnham Lambert's former chief executive, 
confronted Michael Milken in court Tuesday for the first time and implied that 
Drexel's longtime star employee had lied to him. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph also seemed to damage Milken's case in pre-sentencing hearings by 
stating that Milken had violated written company rules on ethics. The Drexel 
executive said Milken had done so by giving managers of mutual funds and some 
company executives improper personal investment opportunities in a deal 
involving highly valuable Storer Communications warrants. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a policy that you could not give favored treatment to employees of 
institutional investors accounts" at Drexel, Joseph said. Referring to 
distribution of Storer warrants, he said: "I think it violated that rule." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph currently is vice chairman of Drexel, now in bankruptcy proceedings. The 
firm collapsed less than a year after Joseph, based at the firm's New York 
headquarters, had it plead guilty to six felony counts, all relating to Milken 
transactions. At the time of Drexel's plea, Milken supporters considered 
Joseph's decision a major betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
But now Milken himself has pleaded guilty to six counts. The hearings are being 
held to determine if there is evidence that Milken committed other crimes 
besides the six. U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood said she will consider the 
evidence in deciding Milken's sentence. He faces up to 28 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The court appearance was the first time in about a year that Joseph and Milken 
had met face to face, a source said. It proved to be a less-than-epic 
confrontation, however: Milken betrayed no emotion in response to Joseph's 
testimony. And Joseph didn't heap blame on Milken for the firm's fate. He 
simply answered the relatively narrow factual questions that were put to him. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony centered on the distribution of the Storer warrants that were 
generated as part of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.'s leveraged buyout of 
Storer in 1985. Drexel handled the financing. Prosecutors argue that Milken 
secretly arranged for 80% of the warrants to go into a private employee 
partnership that he controlled. They also charge that Milken used the warrants 
to personally bribe investment fund managers and others into having their funds 
or companies buy risky Storer preferred stock that did not pay cash dividends. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph implied that Milken had lied to him about the use of the warrants. 
Joseph said that in the spring of 1988, a senior official of the Keystone group 
of mutual funds expressed concern to him that Drexel might be involved in 
unethical activity by allowing employees of investment funds to invest 
personally in lucrative private partnerships established for Milken and other 
executives of Drexel's high-yield bond department. Joseph said he then called 
Milken and asked if this were true. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him if any fund managers were in any of (the Drexel employee) 
partnerships," Joseph said. "He said to the best of his recollection 'No.' " 
</P>
<P>
Joseph said he later learned that this wasn't true. He said Craig Cogut, a 
lawyer who worked for the Beverly Hills-based junk bond department, came to him 
a short time later. He said Cogut told him there was a Milken-controlled 
partnership "that the firm was unaware of and that the investors included some 
fund managers for their own account in situations where the funds they had 
managed had purchased (Storer) preferred." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, the judge seemed to hint that she would like to see 
Milken himself testify. She indicated that she hadn't decided yet whether she 
will hold it against him if he doesn't. Defense lawyer Arthur L. Liman said he 
was concerned that whatever Milken says might be used against him in criminal 
proceedings filed by state authorities. He said Milken probably won't testify 
unless he gets blanket immunity. Milken already has immunity from federal 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
One other witness testified Tuesday, providing the first testimony directly 
linking Milken to offering the warrants as personal investments to favored 
corporate executives. Richard Grassgreen, who this week agreed to plead guilty 
to two felony counts, said Milken had called to offer him some of the warrants. 
</P>
<P>
Grassgreen is former chairman of Enstar Group Inc. and its predecessor, 
Kinder-Care. He said, however, that Milken offered him the warrants well after 
Kinder-Care had committed to buying the preferred and that there was no 
connection to that investment decision. He said neither Milken nor any other 
Drexel employee ever tried to use the Storer warrants improperly to pressure 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the investments that were made during the time I managed the 
(Kinder-Care investment) portfolio were made on the merits and were very 
profitable," Grassgreen said.

The troubled parent of the worldwide 7-Eleven convenience store chain edged 
toward bankruptcy Tuesday, but bondholders apparently approved a quick 
reorganization plan that could get the company back on its feet within months. 
</P>
<P>
Bondholders apparently endorsed a so-called prepackaged bankruptcy plan 
Tuesday, Southland Corp. officials said, although no official results were 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
The vote came after months of abortive effort by Southland to persuade 
bondholders -- owners of $1.8 billion in Southland debt -- to agree to a buyout 
proposal that would have bailed out the Dallas-based company without going into 
bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
In this prepackaged bankruptcy, a company goes into federal court with a 
reorganization plan largely worked out and the approval of roughly two-thirds 
of its bondholders. With most of the issues already negotiated, a company can 
emerge from bankruptcy in months instead of years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a new lease on life if they can do this," said Southland analyst 
Wayne A. Josephson at Fitch Investors Service in New York. With a prepackaged 
reorganization, there is "a significantly lower toll on the company in terms of 
expenses and declining customers." 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the plan, Ito-Yokado Co. would pay $430 million in cash for 
70% of Southland, perhaps the biggest Japanese investment in a U.S. retailer to 
date. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, bondholders would accept new bonds that would have only half of 
the face value of their old investment in exchange for 25% of the company. And 
the Thompson family of Dallas -- Southland's founders and principal owners -- 
would end up with just 5% of the company. 
</P>
<P>
But prepackaged bankruptcy plans are not foolproof, and analysts warned Tuesday 
that Southland's problems are not necessarily over even if the prepackaged plan 
is indeed accepted by bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
"If they go into bankruptcy court their plan may not be allowed," said David 
Glatstein, president of Barre &amp; Co. Inc., a Dallas brokerage. "You're 
asking a court to rubber-stamp everything you want to do. A court's not 
necessarily going to want do that." 
</P>
<P>
Bondholder approval of a prepackaged plan "is a very, very positive development 
for the company," said Southland analyst Jim Bennett of R. D. Smith in New 
York. "The risk is that you could get a crazy nut who goes into bankruptcy 
court and tries to disrupt the plan, a creditor who takes a lawyer to court and 
tries to challenge it." 
</P>
<P>
Southland, parent of the world's biggest network of convenience stores, has 
been brought to the brink of collapse largely by the huge interest payments 
stemming from the $4.9-billion management buyout in 1987. At the time, 
Southland was maneuvering to avert a takeover by Canadian investor Samuel 
Belzberg. 
</P>
<P>
Along with other convenience-store chains, Southland was stung by stepped-up 
competition from supermarkets and gasoline station mini-markets. By last 
November, the company acknowledged that it faced a cash crisis and began 
working on a corporate overhaul. As part of that overhaul, it sold its 58 
stores in Hawaii for $75 million to Ito-Yokado's 7-Eleven Japan unit. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Southland tentatively agreed to sell 75% of the company to 
Ito-Yokado. But bondholders balked at the plan. Despite an improved offer that 
came in ensuing months, bondholders never provided the 95% support needed for 
the deal to go through. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Southland and Ito-Yokado came up with a similar plan that would 
send the company into bankruptcy court. This plan, which was voted on Tuesday, 
only required the support of two-thirds of the holders of each class of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Scott A. Pearce, a franchisee with two 7-Eleven outlets in San Bernardino 
County and a member of Southland's National Advisory Council, said most 
7-Eleven franchisees hoped the company would stay out of bankruptcy. He 
expressed concern that a bankruptcy, even a prepackaged bankruptcy case, will 
trigger bad publicity that could hurt business. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Pearce said the prepackaged bankruptcy plan ensures that 
7-Eleven's suppliers will continue to be paid on time. He added that 
franchisees believe that Ito-Yokado's planned investment will provide needed 
funds to remodel stores, increase advertising and install computerized cash 
registers. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be back to the old Southland, when it was No. 1 (in the convenience 
store business) by leaps and bounds," Pearce said. 
</P>
<P>
John Gordon, chairman of the steering committee representing bondholders and 
preferred shareholders, expressed frustration that the out-of-bankruptcy buyout 
offer failed to win the needed 95% approval. 
</P>
<P>
He called the minority who rejected the deal "dopes." "They took money out of 
their pockets and out of my pockets," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Gordon said, the prepackaged bankruptcy is much better than regular 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, which he estimated would take three years or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very comfortable with the prepackaged bankruptcy plan, and I'm glad 
we're getting on with the show," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
"The business is going to be business as usual. It's not going to affect sales. 
It's not going to affect day-to-day operations. The only people being asked to 
take hits are the bondholders."

5 PARTIES SAID INTERESTED IN LEARNING CHANNEL; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIA: IF COMPLETED, THE DEAL COULD BRING FNN UP TO $40 MILLION. HOWEVER, 
SEVERAL RIVALS MAY MAKE A BID FOR CASH-STRAPPED FNN ITSELF. 
</P>

<P>
Financial News Network Inc. and Infotechnology Inc. confirmed Tuesday that they 
have received several offers for their 51% stake in the Learning Channel Inc., 
a cable TV network. Analysts said the transaction could bring the company $30 
million to $40 million in badly needed cash. 
</P>
<P>
FNN and Infotech were said to have received bids last week from five interested 
buyers, including a partnership of Hearst Entertainment, Capital Cities/ABC 
Inc. and Viacom Inc., as well as a bid from the Discovery Channel. Hearst, 
Capital Cities/ABC and Viacom jointly own the Lifetime cable TV channel. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, several media companies are believed to be considering making a 
bid for FNN itself, including Time Warner Inc., Turner Broadcasting System Inc. 
and Paramount Communications Corp. Turner made one previous attempt to take 
control of FNN in 1989, but the move was blocked by Turner's board. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual twist, FNN and Infotech -- Infotech owns 47% of publicly traded 
FNN and the companies have the same chairman -- said Tuesday that a bid was not 
received from National Media Corp., a Philadelphia-based direct mail company 
that reportedly had made an offer for TLC. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Diao, an investment banker with Prudential-Bache Securities in New York 
who is handling the bidding process, acknowledged that he had spoken with 
National Media and confirmed that no bid had been received. He declined to 
elaborate. National Media could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
FNN and Infotech, however, seemed to be deflating estimates of the purchase 
price for their stake in the Rosslyn, Va.-based adult education channel. 
Analysts have estimated that such a sale could fetch $30 million to $40 
million. But the companies said those figures were based on reports from "when 
the market values of media companies were significantly higher." 
</P>
<P>
The companies warned there can be "no assurances that such a transaction will 
occur." 
</P>
<P>
Richard MacDonald, a principal in MacDonald Grippo Reilly in New York, said: 
"These comments reflect management's inability to maximize shareholder value." 
He believes that it is more likely that FNN itself will be sold instead. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-hour business news channel, which saw its fortunes soar along with the 
roaring 1980s stock market, has come under intense scrutiny by Wall Street 
since it disclosed that an accounting dispute could lead to a substantial 
non-cash charge against earnings. This would create a quarterly loss and put 
the company in jeopardy of defaulting on its bank loans. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts who follow FNN said it might this week announce another shake-up of 
its senior management. Earlier this month, FNN fired its chief financial 
officer over allegedly misappropriating company funds and suspended two other 
finance department employees. And last week, FNN dismissed its finance staff in 
Los Angeles to move that department closer to senior executives in New York and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
FNN first revealed on Oct. 1 that it was unable to complete its year-end 
financial statements because of a dispute with outside auditors on how to 
account for the start-up costs of a new business venture launched in July. Now, 
observers say, FNN's nine-member board has moved to take day-to-day control of 
company. 
</P>
<P>
One of the board members, Michael Wellesley-Wesley, a British investment 
banker, is overseeing much of the financial operations of the company formerly 
managed by the fired chief financial officer, C. Steven Bolen. Analysts also 
noted that Earl W. Brian, chief executive of FNN, is no longer speaking for the 
company or making public comment, as he was in the early days of the 
disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1989, the latest for which information is 
available, the Learning Channel's revenue rose 62% over the previous year to 
$9.1 million. But due mainly to higher programming costs, pretax operating 
income fell 13% to $211,702. 
</P>
<P>
American Community Service Network, a nonprofit group that started the Learning 
Channel in 1980, holds 31.5% of the company, while 17.5% is owned by TLC 
management. Infotech acquired its stake in TLC in 1986 for $3 million.

DISNEY TO GET FILM FINANCING FROM JAPANESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the largest such deal in Hollywood history, Walt Disney Co. announced 
Tuesday that it has teamed with some Japanese institutional investors to form a 
new U.S. limited partnership that will provide $600 million in financing for 
its upcoming motion pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Called Touchwood Pacific Partners I, the partnership will be backed by $420 
million in credit provided by two Japanese banks and two U.S. banks, as well as 
$180 million in proceeds from the sale of limited partnership interests by 
Yamaichi General Finance Co., an affiliate of Yamaichi Securities, one of 
Japan's leading securities firms. 
</P>
<P>
The deal represents Walt Disney Co.'s first major film financing from Japan, 
and it is the largest injection of Japanese financing into a major Hollywood 
studio other than an outright acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Disney said Touchwood would be the primary financier for all of Disney's 
live-action films once funds from its existing limited partnership, Silver 
Screen Partners IV, are exhausted. The partnership could pay for most of 
Disney's motion picture production for at least the next 12 to 18 months, a 
Disney official said. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership will allow Disney to continue financing films without adding 
debt to its balance sheet -- and apparently on better terms than it would have 
been able to get from Silver Screen Partners, which paid investors an estimated 
18% annual rate of interest on their investment. 
</P>
<P>
Yamaichi Finance's sales of $180 million in limited partnership interests could 
be a boon to Japanese institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership could then borrow as much as $420 million from its 
participating group of international banks, which includes Fuji Bank Ltd., The 
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., led by 
Citibank N. A. as agent. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is only the latest in a growing list of Japanese investments in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Sony Corp. bought Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $3.4 
billion. And Victor Co. of Japan agreed to invest $100 million in Largo 
Entertainment, a film company headed by former 20th Century Fox President 
Lawrence Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, MCA Inc. has been talking with Matsushita Electric Industrial 
Co. about a buyout worth as much as $8.6 billion.

TIME WARNER TO PAY PATHE FOR VIDEO RIGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: THE TWO COMPANIES ALSO AGREE TO SETTLE A LAWSUIT OVER PATHE'S 
BID FOR MGM/UA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Time Warner Inc. agreed to back Pathe Communications Corp.'s bid for MGM/UA 
Communications Co. by advancing the independent film company $125 million in 
return for long-term video rights to Pathe and MGM/UA movies. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner and its Warner Bros. unit also agreed to settle their litigation 
with Pathe. The companies had sued each other in Los Angeles Superior Court 
after Time Warner dropped an earlier plan to provide $650 million in backing 
for the $1.3-billion MGM/UA purchase. 
</P>
<P>
The current agreement, which had been rumored for a week, gives Warner Bros. 
worldwide video distribution rights to the existing MGM/UA and Pathe libraries 
and to new films to be produced by the merged companies for the next 12 1/2 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Pathe announced a similar agreement under which Turner 
Broadcasting System Inc. acquired television distribution rights to MGM/UA's 
1,000-film library for the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros., under its agreement, will make additional payments as each new 
MGM/UA film begins production for the life of the agreement. The arrangement 
will give MGM/UA funds to restart production, which has ground to a virtual 
halt since Pathe announced its buyout bid last March. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe has already completed nearly a dozen films that will be released to 
theaters under the MGM/UA logo, before their release on videocassettes by 
Warner Bros. The films include "The Russia House," starring Sean Connery and 
Michelle Pfeiffer, and "Not Without My Daughter," starring Sally Field. 
</P>
<P>
"Rocky V," an MGM/UA film set for release next month, will also be released on 
cassettes by Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe and its president, Giancarlo Parretti, have said they plan to complete 
the acquisition of MGM/UA under their $21.50-a-share bid by Friday. A 
$4-a-share portion of the price has already been paid to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
An MGM/UA spokesman said Tuesday that the company's board met to review 
progress of the buyout, and will reconvene today for a vote on whether to 
approve Pathe's financing package.

Glenfed Cuts Dividend: The parent of Glendale Federal Bank, California's 
third-largest thrift, slashed its quarterly dividend to 15 cents per share from 
30 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Glenfed Inc. said it cut the dividend as part of an effort to increase the 
amount of capital it generates internally. Federal capital standards for 
thrifts are set to rise in 1993. Glenfed also said the new dividend would be in 
line with the dividend yield paid by similar-sized thrifts. Before the 
announcement, Glenfed's dividend yield was 14. The new dividend will be payable 
Nov. 16 to stockholders of record on Nov. 5. Glenfed's stock closed at $7.50 a 
share, down 62.5 cents in NYSE trading.

ARMOR ALL EARNINGS TAKE PLUNGE OF 71% 
</P>

<P>
Pelted by an ailing retail industry and increased competition, Armor All 
Products Corp. is having trouble polishing up its profits. 
</P>
<P>
The maker of Armor All Protectant and other car-care products said Tuesday that 
its second-quarter earnings plunged 71% to $1 million, down from $3.6 million a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the quarter ended Sept. 30 declined 7% to $23.5 million from $25.3 
million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Armor All stock, traded over the counter, closed Tuesday at a 52-week low of 
$10.75 per share, down 75 cents, on news of the earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
"With retail sales slowing down, there's a lot of product in the warehouses and 
the shelves of retailers," said Marvin L. Krasnansky, vice president of 
corporate relations for McKesson Corp., which owns 83% of Armor All Products of 
Aliso Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Krasnansky said the company has also been hurt by a decline in the number of 
retail outlets that carry its products. The number has fallen to about 100,000 
from 113,000 two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The consolidation reflects the mergers, acquisitions and bankruptcies among 
retailers," Krasnansky said. "The general-merchandise retailers are less 
willing to carry automotive products to compete with the automotive specialty 
stores." 
</P>
<P>
And then there is the problem of increased competition from companies such as 
First Brand Corp.'s STP division, which markets the Son of a Gun! protectant. 
Despite heavy advertising and competitive pricing by STP, Krasnansky said, 
Armor All Protectant still has more than 75% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
The competition from STP and from Turtle Wax and other car protectants has 
forced Armor All to spend more on advertising and is squeezing profits, the 
company said. Besides the protectant, introduced in 1972, Armor All also sells 
other car-care and wax products that compete with Turtle Wax and First Brands' 
STP items. 
</P>
<P>
Armor All launched a cost-control program in March, when President and Chief 
Executive Jeffrey M. Sherman resigned and was replaced by Kenneth C. Hicken, 
chairman of McKesson. The company said, however, that it expects overall 
expenses will be the same this year as last. 
</P>

For the six months ended Sept. 30, earnings declined 67% to $3 million, and 
revenue dropped 7% to $56.5 million. One bright spot was international sales, 
which rose 40% during the six months and now make up 13% of Armor All's total 
sales.

Orange County housing sales declined 18.5% in September from a year earlier and 
the average price fell 5.6% during the same period, a report issued Tuesday 
said, and there is no sign of recovery for the slumping housing market as 
recession fears grow. 
</P>
<P>
Still, amid all the gloom, the report by TRW Real Estate Information Services 
shows that the housing market for the first nine months of 1990 has been mostly 
flat. In fact, housing sales and average prices for the nine-month period are 
slightly ahead of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Sales so far this year have been spaced fairly evenly over each quarter. There 
was no discernible decline in the traditionally slow third quarter until 
September, when sales closings were off considerably from September, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
There were 3,373 sales that closed in September, down from 4,139 a year ago. 
The monthly sales total is the lowest since February and the fifth-lowest since 
January, 1988, when TRW began compiling monthly sales data for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
TRW's monthly reports include all new and resale homes and condominiums that 
closed escrow during the month -- meaning that the actual sales contracts were 
signed from one to three months earlier in most cases. 
</P>
<P>
The sales pace of 34,980 units for the first three quarters was up a scant 0.5% 
from a year earlier, when 34,801 residential sales were closed by the end of 
September, TRW said. For the third quarter, the 11,829 closings were down only 
1.2% from 11,987 closings in the third quarter of last year. 
</P>
<P>
"That is amazing," said Gary Wescombe, a real estate industry consultant with 
the Newport Beach office of the Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. accounting firm. "I 
would have thought the third quarter would be way down." 
</P>
<P>
Wescombe said he couldn't explain the apparent stabilizing but said it 
indicates that "everyone is complaining not because sales have shrunk so much 
already this year but because they are afraid they will shrink in the future." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for TRW, which compiles the data but makes no attempt to analyze 
it, said the residential market in Orange County appears to be a little 
stronger this year than in surrounding counties. 
</P>
<P>
But while the current nine-month figures look good compared to last year's, 
they remain positively anemic when contrasted with the 47,476 units sold in the 
first nine months of 1988 -- the last year of a three-year bull market for 
Orange County residential real estate. 
</P>
<P>
The three-quarter total for this year is 26.3% lower than for the first nine 
months of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The two-year sales slowdown has had one moderately beneficial impact as sellers 
of both new and resale homes in recent months have dropped prices to attract 
those buyers remaining in the market. 
</P>
<P>
So while the county still is one of the costliest home markets in the nation, 
average prices for residences sold last month dropped to $246,022 from $260,654 
in September, 1989, according to information compiled by TRW. 
</P>
<P>
And the nine-month average price of $250,557 was up less than $900 from the 
$249,677 average for the first nine months last year. The increase from last 
year didn't even outpace inflation, but the nine-month average was up a hefty 
21.2% from the 1988 nine-month average of $206,709. 
</P>
<P>
Resale activity, which makes up the bulk of the sales, posted the largest 
decline in September. The 2,843 units that closed escrow represented a 20% 
decline from 3,554 units sold a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Average resale prices fell 5.7% to $241,211 from $255,891 in September, 1989, 
according to the TRW report. 
</P>
<P>
New home sales were off 9.4% from a year ago, with 530 closed sales last month 
versus 585 in September, 1989. Average prices for new homes dropped 6.6% to 
$262,293 from $280,741.

NINTENDO KEEPS COLOR DREAMS UP WORRYING; 
</P>
<P>
VIDEO GAMES: THE BREA FIRM THAT MAKES UNLICENSED GAMES FOR THE JAPANESE 
COMPANY'S SYSTEM NOW FACES COMPETITION FROM THE U.S. COMPANIES THAT DESIGN THE 
OFFICIAL NINTENDO GAMES.

<P>
Already reeling from its inability to sell its video games through major 
retailers, a small local company said Tuesday that a recent decision by the 
Nintendo Co. could pose an even greater threat to its success. 
</P>
<P>
Color Dreams, a Brea firm that develops games that work on the popular Nintendo 
system but are not licensed by the Japanese company, said competition will 
intensify as a result of Nintendo's decision to permit the U.S. companies that 
design its games to also manufacture them. The move is expected to clear the 
way for a flood of new video games on the market, perhaps driving down prices. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for cutthroat competition," said Eddy Lin, Color Dreams 
marketing director. "The only good things happening are we're exporting some 
games to Japan and overseas to the Third World and Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo of America, the U.S. arm of the Japanese parent, controls an estimated 
80% of the American video game market. To ensure that only licensed video games 
are played on its system, the company implants a computer lockout chip in each 
game cartridge. Before play can begin, the chip must send a key signal to 
another chip in the Nintendo Entertainment System machine. 
</P>
<P>
Competitors charge that the practice of prohibiting other firms from developing 
games for the Nintendo system amounts to unfair competition. They say the 
practice allows Nintendo to preserve artificially high prices for its games, 
which typically sell for about $50 each. 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo has maintained that unlicensed games contain software flaws that could 
cause malfunctions and frustrate players. The company said it has assurances 
that the 53 U.S. firms that design its games can manufacture them without 
flaws. 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo's manufacturing decision has not placated competitor Atari Games Corp. 
of Milpitas, Calif. In a statement Tuesday, Atari Games said that "while 
Nintendo's move to loosen its manufacturing restrictions may appear to ease its 
stranglehold on the video game industry, in reality it does no such thing." 
</P>
<P>
Calling Nintendo's move "a sham," Atari Games Senior Vice President Dennis Wood 
said Nintendo's continued use of lockout chips gives it "total control over the 
titles and quantities of the games that are available to consumers." Atari 
Games and Nintendo have sued each other over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Color Dreams' games circumvent the Nintendo lockout chips and can therefore 
operate on the Nintendo system. The company will not say exactly how it is able 
to do this. 
</P>
<P>
Lin said the company has developed several games, which have titles such as 
"Crystal Mines" and "Baby Boomer," that retail between $29 and $39, 
substantially below the prices for the licensed games. He said Nintendo-related 
products will account for about 60% of the company's anticipated $30 million in 
sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
The company's sales, however, are largely limited to exports and video rental 
shops because major retailers such as Toy R Us and Sears refuse to stock the 
games. He said he suspects that Nintendo has pressured retailers to not carry 
unlicensed cartridges. Nintendo has denied engaging in any unfair trade 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
Video rental shops have proven to be a strong market, Lin said, because 
customers are able to judge for themselves how well they work. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers' shelves, however, are already bulging with Nintendo cartridges, Lin 
said, and the expanded licensing for game makers will only add to the glut. 
</P>
<P>
"The market," he said, "is saturated."

After completing a small-business class at Orange Coast College last spring, 
Sharon Corzine and Robin Ellis decided they had hit upon a great idea for a new 
enterprise: holiday care packages for college students far from home. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in early August, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein dispatched his troops to 
Kuwait. And the marketing strategy for Corzine and Ellis' company did an 
about-face. 
</P>
<P>
Why not market care packages filled with goodies from home to U.S. military 
personnel stationed in Saudi Arabia, they thought. The fledgling entrepreneurs 
began marketing their packages at Orange County military installations and 
sending mail order lists to homes in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The orders, they say, are beginning to pour in. 
</P>
<P>
"We set up the company at the right time and at the right place," said Corzine, 
co-owner of Care Packages in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Although Corzine and Ellis have stuck with their original idea of providing 
gift packages for families of students at far-away colleges and universities, 
their company got a boost from the international crisis that began when Iraqi 
tanks rolled into Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the families were worried, and they started sending boxes to their 
husbands and loved ones in American military camps," Corzine said. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, sending packages to U.S. troops stationed in Saudi Arabia was 
problematic. The Pentagon originally set a limit of 12 ounces for packages sent 
to the Middle East. But the regulations were changed last month, allowing 
packages of up to 70 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The extra weight was necessary for customers who wanted to send larger packages 
to particular groups of soldiers, such as a number of Orange County residents 
who wanted orders sent to troops from the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
The packages, Ellis said, are "like a donation for some people; it's their way 
of showing support for our servicemen." 
</P>
<P>
Since August, Care Packages has received more than 100 orders and has shipped 
out dozens of packages. The orders are coming in so quickly that the two women 
say they've been working seven days a week to fill them. 
</P>
<P>
"With the holiday season just starting, we'll be working extra hard," Corzine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the packages come in simple brown boxes measuring 18 by 18 by 6 inches. 
But the goodies inside vary with the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a Halloween box called "Autumn Harvest" includes apple butter, 
cheese crackers, walnut cookies, Indian corn and a miniature pumpkin. A 
Christmas package, "Nutcracker Sweet," contains a chocolate toy soldier, 
chocolate eclairs, mulling spices, a mint-filled drum and cinnamon sticks. 
</P>
<P>
The boxes range in price from $25 for the simplest package to $100 for an extra 
large "Christmas Elegance" box that includes such treats as smoked salmon, 
gourmet honeys, sparkling cider and holiday plates and napkins. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're offering is convenience for the sender because we pack and send the 
boxes for them," Ellis said. "All they have to do is pick from our catalogue." 
</P>
<P>
For the military men or women receiving the packages, the hardest part may be 
keeping the goodies out of the hands of other homesick soldiers.

MEDIA: THE NEW YORK TIMES' MAX FRANKEL APOLOGIZES FOR EARLIER COMMENTS ABOUT 
WOMEN, THEN KICKS OFF A NEW CONTROVERSY WITH STATEMENTS ABOUT BLACKS.

<P>
Earlier this year, commenting on a survey that criticized the New York Times 
for its Page 1 coverage of women, Executive Editor Max Frankel put his foot in 
his mouth when he made a flippant comment about women in the news. 
</P>
<P>
He angered female reporters, including those in his newsroom, when he likened 
stories involving women to coverage of tea parties. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, after apologizing for those comments, Frankel raised eyebrows once 
again. During a symposium on women and the media at the Columbia Graduate 
School of Journalism, he said it is easier for him to fire women than blacks, 
because there are more women in the newsroom these days. 
</P>
<P>
"We've reached a critical mass with women. I know that when a woman screws up 
it is not a political act for me to go fire them," Frankel said at the meeting. 
"I cannot (easily) say that with some of our blacks. They're still precious, 
they're still hothouse in management, and if they are less than good, I would 
probably stay my hand at removing them too quickly. It's still a political act 
and it would hurt the organization in a larger sense, so you tolerate a little 
more in the short term." 
</P>
<P>
Frankel's comments drew an angry response from two black woman reporters, who 
called the comments patronizing, confusing and, in one case, racist. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting was sponsored by the Women, Men and Media Project. The group 
is based in the School of Journalism at USC, under the direction of Betty 
Friedan, a leading feminist thinker and writer. 
</P>
<P>
In a report issued Tuesday, the group charted the number of stories filed by 
women reporters on American television news, including the three major 
networks, PBS and CNN. Based on a one-month survey, the study found that female 
correspondents participated in only 15% of the news stories, down from 16% in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, the organization produced a study on the number of female bylines 
and sources appearing on the front pages of 10 major American newspapers. When 
told that the New York Times ranked last in sources, Frankel was angered, 
calling the report "unfair and bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that different newspapers have different missions, he added: "By that I 
mean, if you are covering local teas, you've got more women (on the front page) 
than if you're the Wall Street Journal." 
</P>
<P>
Although he still believes he was right, Frankel on Tuesday conceded that his 
comments about tea parties were "defensive" and "stupid." However, his 
statements on race and gender got him in hot water again, this time with two 
black woman reporters sitting with him on a panel. 
</P>
<P>
If the newspaper treats blacks differently than females, asked Long Island 
cable television news anchor Melba Tolliver, "what do you do when a black 
female screws up? You have a policy about how to treat women. Is that white 
women, all women . . . and then do you have another policy on how you treat 
white or black people? I mean, it's puzzling." 
</P>
<P>
Carole Simpson, an ABC News senior correspondent, was said: "I'm very disturbed 
when I hear a news organization say, 'we will let black people slide.' I think 
that feeds into the whole stereotype of you're not as good. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Frankel seemed surprised by the reaction, saying he had been misunderstood. The 
New York Times demands excellence from all its reporters, he said, adding that 
it cares "passionately" about affirmative action. "Other things being equal and 
the quality being there, yes, we give the nod to a woman, a black, and put them 
on the fast track."

NOVELS HELP FATHER JOSEPH GIRZONE REACH THE FAITHFUL -- AND NONBELIEVERS

<P>
Standing at the lectern at St. Timothy Roman Catholic Church, Father Joseph 
Girzone was telling the story of how Jesus performed the miracle of turning 
water into wine to save the wedding party at Cana the embarrassment of running 
out only three days into the eight-day marriage feast. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes you think," the soft-spoken priest said, peering owlishly at his 
mostly teen-age audience through large-framed glasses. "There were probably an 
awful lot of people at that party who were more than three sheets to the wind. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have thought twice about doing something . . . and here the Son of God 
gives them another 150 gallons of wine." 
</P>
<P>
It is Girzone's view of Jesus -- open and caring and having an "uncanny ability 
to accept human nature as God fashioned it" -- that has made the retired parish 
priest from Altamont, N.Y., a publishing phenomenon. He is so much in demand as 
a speaker that he jokes, "I now live on USAir." 
</P>
<P>
Girzone, 60, the author of "Joshua" and "Joshua and the Children," two 
best-selling religious novels that place Joshua (Jesus in Hebrew) on the 
contemporary scene, can barely keep up with the nearly 200 lecture requests a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Girzone, who retired from the active ministry in 1981 for health reasons, is an 
unlikely literary success story. 
</P>
<P>
Girzone wrote and self-published "Joshua," the story of a mysterious woodcarver 
who shows up in an eastern U.S. village and captivates the townspeople with his 
simple and loving ways, in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Girzone had sold the paperback rights to the Gospel-oriented novel 
in 1987, he had already sold 40,000 hardcover copies, largely by word of mouth. 
Since then, "Joshua" has sold 750,000 paperback copies, and the novel has been 
translated into five languages. And, according to his publisher, it is still 
selling an impressive 20,000 to 40,000 copies a month. 
</P>
<P>
"Joshua and the Children," a sequel that places Joshua in a fictional country 
similar to Northern Ireland where people are warring in the name of religion, 
was published by Macmillan in 1989. The sequel, which addresses the question of 
forgiveness, spent 11 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list, landed on 
the Publishers Weekly list of the top 25 hardcover fiction best-sellers of 1989 
and has been optioned for a feature film. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Girzone has combined a cross-country publicity tour with his lecture 
schedule to promote "The Shepherd" (Macmillan; $15.95), the latest installment 
in his Joshua series. 
</P>
<P>
"The Shepherd" is the story of a newly ordained bishop who has always adhered 
strictly to church rules. But after praying for guidance the night of his 
ordination, he has nightmares about the damage his rigidity has caused in 
parishioners' lives. 
</P>
<P>
In this one, Joshua plays a supporting role, serving as the bishop's mentor as 
he makes decisions to do things the way he thinks Christ would do them. 
</P>
<P>
Among the contemporary issues "The Shepherd" addresses are: 
</P>
<P>
* The shortage of priests: "We will in a short time be faced with a priestless 
church, at a time when people need good priests more than ever." The fact that 
a qualified person is married, the book contends, should not be a barrier to 
the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
* Celibacy: "It is a clear violation of a basic human right. Even Jesus made 
celibacy optional: 'Let him who can take it, take it.' He himself picked 
married men as his first priests." 
</P>
<P>
* Confession: "When people stop accepting forgiveness in traditional form, it 
expresses a clear message: That form has lost meaning for them. The whole 
Christian world can't be wrong. Find another way." 
</P>
<P>
* Homelessness: "If people starve, it is because others don't care. Do you 
think it will go well on Judgment Day with those who have built their casinos 
and their castles and amassed their riches by shutting their hearts against the 
hurting masses of humanity?" 
</P>
<P>
"The Shepherd," Girzone acknowledges, is his hardest-hitting novel yet. 
</P>
<P>
"It addresses practically all the issues we're not supposed to talk about," he 
said in an interview before his talk. "It's sort of a blueprint for the radical 
reconstruction of the church." 
</P>
<P>
It is radical, he added, "but not in the bad sense of the word: There's nothing 
in it that is against the Catholic doctrine, but it hits very, very hard at 
archaic laws and an archaic way of doing things in the church." 
</P>
<P>
Girzone, however, does not consider himself a radical. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very rational," he said. "If anything, I tend to be more conservative. But 
in working with people, I've always tried to be very realistic, and to have 
laws that are archaic and no longer work and not to reconsider those laws to me 
seems to be totally irrational." 
</P>
<P>
Of the small number of successful priest-authors, Father Andrew Greeley is 
probably the best known. (The best-selling Greeley writes far more secular, 
some say steamy, novels.) Among writers of contemporary religious fiction, 
industry sources say, Girzone is one of the most popular. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Father Girzone's deceptively simple novels have succeeded for the same 
reason their source material has succeeded," said Bill Rosen, Macmillan 
publisher and Girzone's current editor. "All Father Girzone is really saying is 
pretty much what Jesus said and what people said about Jesus. And that seems to 
have an awful lot of power." 
</P>
<P>
And it's not just Catholics who are reading Girzone's simply written tales of a 
compassionate modern Christ. The books have had extraordinary 
interdenominational appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Girzone has been invited to speak to groups of Southern Baptists, Pentecostals, 
Presbyterians, Methodists, Episcopalians and even Jews who have read his books. 
"Usually," he notes, "they develop Joshua clubs -- Friends of Joshua they call 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Girzone also has been told that a Hindu swami in New York, believing "Joshua" 
to be divinely inspired, urged his disciples to follow Joshua's teachings. And 
psychiatrists, observing the calming effect "Joshua' has on many readers, have 
given the book to troubled patients, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Girzone's fan mail attests to the profound effect "Joshua" has on readers, many 
of whom say they were so deeply touched by the book that they now live their 
lives more simply. 
</P>
<P>
A Texas millionaire who was suicidal, for example, credited "Joshua" with 
having given him a reason to live: He moved to Washington, D.C. to help build 
homes for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sort of flabbergasted by the way people respond to it," Girzone said. "I 
think the underlying thing is what some Southern Baptists once told me -- that 
the reason they loved the book so much is because I give them a Jesus that 
makes sense, a Jesus they can fall in love with." 
</P>
<P>
Even non-believers have been affected. 
</P>
<P>
"I get letters from people saying, 'I really don't believe in God, but I read 
'Joshua,' and it gave me such a tremendous sense of peace that it was the most 
powerful argument for faith that I've experienced."' Girzone said. 
</P>
<P>
Such testimonials, he said, "make me feel my retirement, my ill health, was 
worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
Girzone, who was born in Albany, N.Y., and ordained in 1955, spent his early 
years working with Bronx street gangs, counseling Pennsylvania coal miners and 
teaching high school before being assigned as pastor of several parishes in the 
Albany diocese in the '60s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Then the stress began to mount. 
</P>
<P>
At one large parish, Girzone was in charge of organizing religious education 
for some 2,000 children. Also during that time, he was made head of a local 
Human Rights Commission, and when there were riots in the jail and public 
school system he was put in charge of both investigations. 
</P>
<P>
When he completed that assignment, he was transferred to another parish "where 
they had a big crisis going on, and then my last parish was a place where the 
people were extremely depressed and disillusioned with the church and I had to 
try to get them all back in shape." 
</P>
<P>
"All that pressure," Girzone said, "was just devastating." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Girzone discovered that he had a high cholesterol count, high blood 
pressure and a dangerously elevated red blood cell count, a deadly combination 
resulting from stress. 
</P>
<P>
His doctor warned him that if he continued working at the parish, he could be 
dead of a stroke within a year. 
</P>
<P>
The more relaxed lifestyle of a writer seemed the perfect antidote. Girzone 
already had written one book, "Kara, the Lonely Falcon," an allegory on human 
beings' search for peace, which was published in 1979 by a subsidy press. 
</P>
<P>
Girzone worked out an agreement with his diocese for an early retirement in 
which he would support himself. Then he moved into a sparsely furnished house 
provided at low rent by a friend and began writing. 
</P>
<P>
During the first two years of his retirement, Girzone wrote two religious books 
-- "Gloria: A Diary," about a popular teen-ager who gets cancer, and "Who Will 
Teach Me?" a religious handbook for parents. Both were published by his own 
small publishing house, Richelieu Court, named after the 17th-Century cardinal 
who used the press to shape public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
His retirement also gave him time to do something he had wanted to do for 
years: reread the Gospels. 
</P>
<P>
"I was able to see things that I didn't see before." A whole new Jesus jumped 
off the pages, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He used the Gospels as the basis for his story of Christ in modern setting, and 
coupled that with the idea that people have not changed much since Christ's 
time. Girzone "just let the book take its course," he said. "It's almost as 
though God wanted this image of Himself out." 
</P>
<P>
Girzone's straightforward, unadorned prose has been criticized as "simple and 
childlike." Girzone says he has taken his "lumps" for that but that the style 
is intentional. 
</P>
<P>
"I never looked upon myself as a writer," he said. "I just had a lot of ideas I 
wanted to get out to people. So I tried to write as simply as I possibly could 
because I wanted everybody, even little children and old people losing their 
powers, to be able to read the books and get something out of them. And so 
simple, ordinary people love Joshua." 
</P>
<P>
Girzone's substantial income from his books has allowed him to buy a 21-room 
mountaintop house outside Altamont, where he occasionally holds informal 
retreats. He also has bought land on a mountaintop in Northern California where 
he plans to build his first Joshua House, a retreat for people of all 
denominations. 
</P>
<P>
Although he still must take blood-pressure medication, and although his hectic 
lecture schedule prevents him from spending much time at home relaxing, he has 
no intention of slacking off. 
</P>
<P>
Says Girzone: "I reach more people and have done more priestly work in the past 
eight or nine years than I've ever done in my whole life."

ANTI-CRASH COURSE FOR CYCLISTS; 
</P>
<P>
CONSUMERS: UNDER A NEW LAW, MOTORCYCLE AND SCOOTER RIDERS UNDER 21 MUST TAKE 
SAFETY TRAINING TO GET THEIR LICENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California motorcyclists and scooter riders ages 18 to 21, considered the 
high-risk group for accidents, are about to be taught a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, a number of lessons. 
</P>
<P>
After Jan. 1, no person under 21 will get a motorcycle or scooter license from 
the DMV unless he or she completes an approved training course. The current 
mandatory training requirement affects only riders under 18. 
</P>
<P>
The new law, created through Assembly Bill 55, is specifically aimed at young 
riders "because all the studies show conclusively that this under-21 age group 
is the one most in need of motorcycle safety training," said California Highway 
Patrol Commissioner Maury Hannigan. The CHP estimates that about 2,000 riders 
will be affected in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Young riders have been targeted for training because those ages 15 to 24 are 
involved in the most accidents nationwide, according to statistics from the 
Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF), a national nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
The law also creates new motorcycle license classifications: M1 for motorcycles 
and scooters; M2 for mopeds (motorized bicycles), motor-driven cycles and 
low-powered motorcycles. M1 maintains the original testing procedure for 
cyclists -- written and operating examinations. 
</P>
<P>
But M2 establishes written and driving tests for moped riders. Currently, 
anyone with a Class C state driver license can operate a moped. 
</P>
<P>
Inexperienced riders can become injury statistics on all kinds of motorcycles 
and scooters, industry experts say, but some law enforcement officials are 
especially concerned about the extremely high-powered "bullet bikes," such as 
the Kawasaki Ninja, Yamaha FZR600 and Honda Hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
These sport bikes, with 600 cubic-centimeter engines, are street-legal replicas 
of racing bikes that have a high horsepower to weight ratio. Some can reach 
speeds of 140 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"We're aware of the trend toward those bullet bikes," said the CHP's Steve 
Kohler. "There's a risk involved if they're being operated by young, untrained 
riders. The injury risk is much greater with that kind of power. There's a 
saying, 'There are old bikers and bold bikers, but there are no old, bold 
bikers.' " 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, for example, drivers in the 15-to-24 age bracket had the highest 
accident rate in the state among motorcyclists (including scooters) -- 9,849 of 
20,955 injuries; 248 of 620 fatalities, according to CHP statistics. 
</P>
<P>
There were 845,881 licensed motorcycle drivers in the state this year, riding 
643,137 registered motorcycles and scooters. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything goes pretty fast these days," said Julie Filatoff of the Motorcycle 
Safety Foundation. "The problem is more people who are riding (motorcycles and 
scooters) are young. They have a lot of bravado when they're out with their 
friends. Often, they're not licensed." 
</P>
<P>
In an even more specific study published in September by the American Journal 
of Public Health, teen-agers were shown to have the highest number of fatal and 
severe-injury scooter and moped accidents in California. Scooters had twice the 
injury crash rate of mopeds, but half the rate of motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
The study, performed by the epidemiology department of the UCLA School of 
Public Health, was based on 1985 figures. It also showed that more than 59% of 
injured scooter operators, about 41% of injured moped riders and 20% of injured 
motorcycle riders were under the age of 20. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has so many scooters and mopeds on campus that a university committee is 
examining the possibility of requiring student riders to wear helmets, said 
Jess F. Kraus, Ph.D., who headed the study. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many scooter crashes here that it's being studied," said Kraus, 
adding that he favors a statewide mandatory helmet law for motorcycles, 
scooters and mopeds. "They're economical for short-term travel, but they're 
mixing with autos, pedestrians and bicycles." 
</P>
<P>
The new law also authorizes the impoundment of a motorcycle for up to six 
months if its operator has a suspended or revoked license. Subsequent 
convictions carry stiffer penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1980s, nationwide motorcycle fatalities have dropped 
considerably -- there were 30% fewer fatalities (3,105) in 1989 than in 1980 
(5,144), according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
(NHTSA), a branch of the federal Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
California fatalities dropped from 816 in 1980 to 620 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
There is no cause listed for this reduction, but many motorcycle organizations 
point to the trend in rider education programs in many states. 
</P>
<P>
An earlier NHTSA study concluded that one of the major causes of motorcycle 
accidents is a general lack of riding skill and knowledge. About 92% of 
motorcyclists involved in accidents were either self-taught or learned from 
family members or friends. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that rider education programs, stricter licensing laws and 
campaigns against alcohol abuse -- those programs that motorcyclists support -- 
have worked," said Robert Rasor, vice president of government relations for the 
American Motorcyclist Assn. "But we still have a long way to go. We can't 
afford to relax our efforts now." 
</P>
<P>
Since California began its mandatory safety training program in 1987 for 
motorcyclists and scooter riders under age 18, 20,000 riders have taken the 
course. Motorcycle and scooter fatalities in the state have dropped 28% since 
the program began; injuries, 33%. 
</P>
<P>
The California Motorcyclist Safety Program (CMSP) is administered by the CHP 
and funded by motorcyclists themselves. Two dollars from each motorcycle 
registration fee collected by the Department of Motor Vehicles supports the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
There are 45 sites statewide where cyclists and scooter riders can take the 
16-hour course, which includes both written and riding tests. Some of the sites 
will be mobile. A toll-free telephone number has been installed for information 
on course locations (800) 227-4337, or CC-RIDER. 
</P>
<P>
The Riding and Street Skills course, for riders without extensive experience, 
is required under the new law. Currently, the course costs $55 for motorcycle 
and scooter riders under 18, and will cost the same for riders under 21 when 
the law changes. Older riders will continue to pay $85 to $150. Early this 
year, American Honda and BMW of North America began offering reimbursement of 
the safety course fee to buyers of new motorcycles and scooters who enroll in a 
course within six months of purchase. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing a lot of folks taking advantage of that offer," said Mary Barta 
of American Honda. "The volume (of enrollments) has been incredible." 
</P>
<P>
The courses were developed by the Motorcycle Safety Foundation for national 
use. The curriculum includes seven hours of classroom instruction and nine 
hours of on-cycle training and testing. 
</P>
<P>
Students learn basic road skills, including riding in straight lines, safe lane 
changes, avoiding obstacles, cornering and making quick stops, as Mark Holiday, 
a 16-year-old student from Cerritos discovered when he began the course last 
Saturday. Holiday recently bought a used Vespa scooter to commute the three 
miles from his home to Valley Christian High School. "Even though it's 
required, it's just a lot better to take a safety course," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Many insurance companies offer 5% to 15% discounts to motorcyclists and scooter 
riders who take an accredited course. 
</P>
<P>
Under California law, motorcyclists must carry a minimum of 
$15,000/$30,000/$5,000 in liability insurance, which breaks down to $15,000 for 
one person injured; $30,000 for two or more injured; $5,000 for property 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
Optional coverage for medical care and uninsured motorists adds to the expense, 
as do such factors as the type of cycle and age and driving record of operator. 
</P>
<P>
The required liability insurance for a 17-year-old male who has just bought a 
new 250-cc Honda is about $168 a year. A 25-year-old rider with the same 
motorcycle would pay $87 yearly. But a 17-year-old male with a new 
high-performance bike might pay as much as $589 a year in liability insurance, 
"because the bikes are fast and the kids are young," said Mita Patel, an 
underwriter for McGraw Insurance in Anaheim, which specializes in motorcycle 
and scooter insurance. "As a person gets older the rates go down," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Although California requires anyone under 15 1/2 riding on or operating a 
motorcycle or scooter to wear a helmet, there is no state law requiring all 
motorcyclists to do so.

SPRING IN PARIS; 
</P>
<P>
FASHION: CHRISTIAN LACROIX SHOWS AT HOME WHILE OTHERS GO TO THE LOUVRE. BUT 
EVERYONE'S LOOKING TO CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first thing to say about Christian Lacroix's spring '91 collection is that 
he showed it in his salon, rather than in the tents set up in a Louvre 
courtyard where most designers show. 
</P>
<P>
Every season the audience at Lacroix watches from gilded wooden chairs with red 
velvet cushions in a room whose walls are colored a deep orange. 
</P>
<P>
This is one step short of inviting everyone home for dinner, which the French 
are notoriously slow to do. And it allowed the audience a better look at his 
new collection, which balances Lacroix's love of costume with the practical 
matter of wearable clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Jackets were narrow and fitted close to the body, many with romantic, curved 
necklines. Daytime suits had short sleeves and slightly bell-shaped skirts. 
Body suits were not the focus they were in the designer's fall collection. 
Narrow shorts under elongated tops, and dresses in trapeze, blouson or 
baby-doll shapes interested him more. 
</P>
<P>
Fabrics included rich pastel silk prints, lightweight wools, some of which were 
embroidered, and nubby tweeds. Several were Lacroix's own fabric designs, 
including a hand-painted abstract print he calls his "Hommage to the Marquis," 
a reference to Italy's aristocrat designer, Emilio Pucci. 
</P>
<P>
This season's evening suits included one in brocade with a lingerie lace hem 
and one with an embroidered floral jacket and silk floral print skirt. 
</P>
<P>
Metallic sandals, flat-heel silk shoes, short leather gloves with gold charms 
at the wrist, sheer elbow-length black lace gloves, heart-shaped brooches, 
small, structured handbags, and chandelier earrings were the main accessories 
of the season. Lacroix's favorite skirt length was mid-thigh. 
</P>
<P>
The house of Chanel is especially relevant for Southern Californians this 
season. The surfboard that one model carried down the runway was one clue. It 
accompanied a series of what looked like Chanel wet suits, in warm shades of 
blue or green marked off with black grid-like stripes. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the best ideas in this collection by designer Karl Lagerfeld appeared 
in his own signature collection. 
</P>
<P>
Leggings topped by short skirts split high on the sides, worn with fitted 
tailored jackets, had a place in both collections. So did pastel print leggings 
worn with oversized matching print shirts. The Chanel versions have more black 
binding, gold buttons and gardenia brooches attached. The Lagerfeld signature 
look features asymmetric layers of fabric, lower necklines, and fewer 
squared-off edges. 
</P>
<P>
This was not the Chanel collection of a lifetime. But it worked. Jackets were 
elongated and usually solid colored; skirts were narrow and short. Leggings 
added a new look when worn under suits -- as in an aqua-colored suit with hot 
pink leggings. 
</P>
<P>
Eveningwear was resort-like, with bodysuits under sheer wrap-and-tie ruffled 
skirts. 
</P>
<P>
At the House of Balmain, London-based Alistair Blair showed his first 
ready-to-wear collection. And Eric Berge showed his second collection for the 
House of Lanvin. Most of these long-established French couture houses are 
hoping to revive their reputation by injecting their collection with new 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
But they are off to a shaky start. Blair played it too safe, showing knit 
dresses without much spark, conservatively cut suits in floral prints, and 
black crepe evening dresses with lingerie lace that looked as if they'd been 
inspired by Chanel, rather than Lanvin. (Blair worked with Chanel designer Karl 
Lagerfeld for several years, when he was designing the Chloe collection.) 
</P>
<P>
Berge's second collection for Lanvin is better than his first but the clothes 
looked too old-ladyish, even for old ladies to wear. 
</P>
<P>
Big collars and cuffs, wide boxy-cut jackets and skirts that erred on the 
conservative side of classic were matronly mysteries considering that Berge is 
not yet 30 years old. 
</P>
<P>
There were a few hopeful signs in both collections. Time will tell. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Dior designer Gianfranco Ferre continues to search for the balance 
between his style and that of the legendary designer whose footprints he has 
been trying to follow the past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
In a few cases there appeared to be a meeting of the Dior and Ferre minds. You 
could see it in the basket-weave coat dress with a petticoat skirt and a wide 
patent leather belt, the Shantung silk jeans with suede tunics in colors such 
as rose and melon, in the black swimsuits that are bodysuits with elegant 
asymmetric necklines under long white robes, and a crisp pale gray romper with 
white piping. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the search for clothes that blend the two talents continues. Heavy 
black tuxedo suits, and the billowing coats that overpower the tight satin 
jeans underneath, were among memorable problems in the collection. 
</P>
<P>
The question of exactly how to restore an aging couture house and even whether 
to restore it, is under hot debate here. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment, Pierre Berge, business partner of Yves Saint Laurent, said, 
"I'll close the haute couture division permanently the moment anything happens 
to Yves Saint Laurent. The original designer is the heart of a couture house. 
Naming anybody else is a grand joke." 
</P>
<P>
Beatrice Bongibault, Dior corporate chief executive officer, said, "We'll see 
what Mr. Berge does when he's really faced with decision." (Projections are 
that Yves Saint Laurent will be a $1 billion business by 1998.) 
</P>
<P>
Christian Lacroix said he would love to take the role of renewing an old label. 
And he noted, "It's easier when the designer is long dead and his image has 
been lost over the years. Then a young designer with strong ideas can be a good 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
And Rose Marie Bravo, CEO of I. Magnin said, "It's been proven that if a 
designer is not alive, a brand can be developed. Sometimes it takes a couple of 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Karl Lagerfeld, who has restored Chanel to its past glory was flippant about 
the matter. "I am a success at Chanel because people are crazy for Chanel right 
now, that is all." 
</P>
<P>
(Not likely. Reports are that the American house of Norman Norell recently 
offered Lagerfeld the job of creative director there.) 
</P>
<P>
Many designers attended a press conference on Monday where plans were announced 
to construct a permanent fashion exhibition space at the Louvre. It will be a 
multimillion-dollar project completed in 1993 and designed by the architectural 
office of I. M. Pei, which built the glass pyramid that serves as the main 
entrance into the Louvre. 
</P>
<P>
Three times this week the photographers burst into a chorus of "Marseillaise," 
from their standing-room only positions at the far end of the fashion runway. 
</P>
<P>
This is never a good sign. It only happens when a show is so late in starting 
that the men and women behind the cameras are fed up. They want an army of 
fashion models to storm the stage. 
</P>
<P>
It finally happened an hour after curtain call at Sunday night's Sonia Rykiel 
show. Otherwise, things went off without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
Rykiel is faithful to her original idea about clothing -- that it should be 
comfortable, common-looking and made of wool or cotton knit as an added 
convenience for women who travel. 
</P>
<P>
Two clean sporty looks stood out: a deep rose-colored crew neck and matching 
jacket over wide-leg white pants, and white ankle-length hooded dress over 
matching wide-leg pants. This outfit is part of a small group of linen styles. 
The dress buttons up the back, but Rykiel showed it unbuttoned to expose the 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Katharine Hamnett also elicited a chorus from the photographers before her show 
began. This is the second time that London-based Hamnett has presented a 
collection in Paris, which she has explained by saying that the British fashion 
week simply does not draw the same numbers of retailers and press. 
</P>
<P>
Outfits such as her two-piece swimsuit with matching Capri pants help explain 
why Hamnett's clothes are popular in California. 
</P>
<P>
Bodywear is still her strength, including dresses that wrap the figure like a 
mummy, sheer sarong skirts over matching red briefs, and slip dresses that 
truly do slip -- models couldn't keep the straps up. 
</P>
<P>
Hamnett, who always attaches an ecology-minded cause to her show, is promoting 
an anti-pesticide program for agriculture. Invitations to her show included 
this message: "Green cotton by the year 2000."

BURNETT -- TELLING A STORY ON A SHOESTRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WALLACE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the first 15 minutes or so of Charles Burnett's "To Sleep With Anger," 
you may begin to wonder why so many people went to so much trouble for so 
little money to create what appears to be a socially scaled-down version of 
"The Cosby Show." 
</P>
<P>
For sure, a lot of talented people worked on the cheap to get the project done. 
Burnett, the gifted black writer and director, struggled close to bankruptcy 
for much of the four years it took to make "To Sleep With Anger," and among the 
actors working for scale was Danny Glover, whose $10,000 fee for six weeks work 
was a mere fraction of the millions he was paid for his last film, "Lethal 
Weapon II." 
</P>
<P>
Even gangs that normally prowl 20th Street in the South-Central Los Angeles 
neighborhood where the film was set agreed to a truce during filming in the 
summer of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
All this for a Cosby clone? Far from it. The moment that Glover's character, 
Harry Mention, appears in the story -- an old friend from the South who arrives 
on a family's doorstep with a box of belongings and a century's worth of 
superstitions -- it's clear "To Sleep With Anger" is something unique. 
</P>
<P>
Although the title is derived from the biblical admonition against going to bed 
angry, the movie is a complex and poetic look at what could happen to a family 
when an outsider meddles with relationships, loyalties and traditions, already 
brought close to the breaking point by the stress of everyday living. Mention 
is a paradigm of the trickster, the archetypal smiling demon who is part of the 
folklore of many cultures, including that of black Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"I came from a rich heritage and we lived in a neighborhood where Southern 
traditions were kept," says the 46-year-old Burnett, who was born in Vicksburg, 
Miss., but moved to Watts as a child. "When people gathered in the evening or 
on weekends, they used to tell stories to provide a sense of culture. Some of 
those stories were of the trickster who, during slavery, was more of a heroic 
figure." 
</P>
<P>
Burnett says "To Sleep With Anger" is a deliberate effort to re-create a sense 
of that black cultural history: "I didn't appreciate the (storytelling) 
tradition until it disappeared. I had a sense of who I was because of that 
experience. . . . This film was an attempt to go back and deal with the past. 
To tell a story about a story." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Danny Glover: "I think there is a little of Harry in all of us. We're 
constantly in conflict between the good side and the other. Harry's involvement 
with the dark side is not that uncommon." 
</P>
<P>
Originally developed as a project for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, 
"To Sleep With Anger" was derailed by editorial demands. Burnett says he did 
odd jobs to stay afloat, but was still close to bankruptcy when he got a call 
"out of the blue" from the MacArthur Foundation informing him that he had been 
chosen for one of its "genius" grants -- a stipend of $275,000 awarded on the 
basis of his earlier work on such films as 1981's "Killer of Sheep" and 1984's 
"My Brother's Wedding." 
</P>
<P>
Burnett says he immediately moved his family from a small studio apartment into 
a house and bought medical insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have kids, that's real important," he says. "If you have a 2 
1/2-year-old who gets sick at night, an emergency room has no sympathies. If 
you don't have cash, credit or insurance, you're out." 
</P>
<P>
For Burnett, nothing is simple, or quick. Even getting his college education -- 
he has BA and MFA degrees from UCLA -- was a decade-long project, deliberately. 
</P>
<P>
"I was finally asked to graduate rather than take up room needed for other 
students," he says with a laugh. "There wasn't the independent filmmaking that 
there is today, and I would take Russian and Italian just to stay in school. 
There were a lot of us doing the same, and they were glad to get rid of us." 
</P>
<P>
After leaving school, Burnett acted as a sort of jack-of-all-movie-trades, 
writing, directing, reading scripts and making several low-budget films. He won 
the Berlin International Film Festival's critics' prize and Park City, Utah's, 
U.S. Film Festival's first prize for "Killer of Sheep," and received a 
Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship, an NEA grant and a Rockefeller Foundation 
Fellowship along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Many characters and tales recalled from those long-ago days in Watts are 
amalgamated into "To Sleep With Anger." As a child, he raised chickens and 
pigeons and played the trumpet. Chickens and pigeons appear in his film, as 
does a child blowing a raucous trumpet (portrayed by Burnett's older son, 
Steven). 
</P>
<P>
The entire production, in fact, has a home-grown quality demanded by its tiny, 
$1.4-million budget (his wife, Gaye Shannon-Burnett, designed the costumes). 
Glover, one of the film's executive producers, admits, "Basically I was 
instrumental in getting the film funded -- because of my involvement." 
</P>
<P>
Glover and Burnett say they wish there had been more money for additional 
production refinements, but Glover believes the tight budget was largely 
responsible for the film's quality. 
</P>
<P>
"We put in late hours and were limited to two or three takes (of a scene). 
Maybe the technical things we couldn't afford didn't get in the way and we had 
to rely on the performances. . . ." Obviously, no corners were cut in the 
casting, which included such actors as Paul Butler, Mary Alice, Richard Brooks, 
Carl Lumley, Vonetta McGee and Sheryl Lee Ralph. 
</P>
<P>
Both also recall the making of the film not only as successful moviemaking, but 
as an extremely positive social experience. Glover, currently on tour talking 
about the making of the movie, says: "The role the community played in this was 
unlike any other project I have been involved with. Kids in the neighborhood 
hung around and we took two vanloads to a black rodeo. The last day, I cooked a 
big pot of gumbo and we invited the community. Every single cast and crew 
member extended themselves with open arms. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe," Glover says hopefully, "some young kid watching might think, 'I want 
to get involved in making films. My community has encouraged me to dream. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
Burnett, remembering the genesis of his film, adds: "That would make the 
struggle all worthwhile."

GRAND THEATRE PRODUCER LEAVES 
</P>

Frank Wyka, the longtime producer of the Grand Dinner Theatre at the Grand 
Hotel, said Tuesday that a disagreement with hotel management over how to run 
the theater led to his recent departure. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a mutual termination," said Wyka, 60, who began running the 399-seat, 
professional dinner theater in 1978, then called Sebastians-at-the-Grand. "They 
knew I was planning to leave. We had discussed it. They are not theater people, 
and I asked them to terminate me." Wyka was sacked Sept. 23, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Moser, the general manager of the hotel, did not return several phone 
calls. Joan Serot, the theater administrator, said: "I can't really comment. 
All I know is that (Wyka) is no longer with us. Nobody ever made any formal 
statement to us." 
</P>
<P>
The current show, "Damn Yankees," has continued without the producer and has 
been doing well at the box office, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wyka, however, said business at the theater went into a general decline nearly 
two years ago, about the time the hotel management changed. "I felt we were not 
growing," he said. "We were just repeating all the shows we did in past years. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to do 'Fiddler on the Roof' for the fifth time, 'Annie' for the 
second time, 'Camelot' for the third time and 'Gypsy' for the second time," he 
said. "You have to do blockbusters, but how many times?" 
</P>
<P>
With the former hotel management, Wyka said, he had made all production 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Wyka, a Cleveland native who moved to Los Angeles in 1953 and started a 
Hollywood showcase called the Three Arts Studio and Theatre, signed many older 
celebrities for shows at the Grand. The latest was Dorothy Lamour, who is 
scheduled to star there in "Side by Side by Sondheim," beginning in February. 
</P>
<P>
The Grand Dinner Theatre is one of only two in California that hires only 
professional players under a union contract with Actors Equity. The other is 
the Lawrence Welk Dinner Theater in Escondido.

MARGARET SMITH'S DRY WIT 'MARINATING' FOR LAFF STOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Comedian Margaret Smith -- she of the distinctively slow, deadpan delivery -- 
just got back from a week of engagements in Hawaii where she went scuba diving 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Before submerging, Smith says, the diving instructor told her: "Now the idea, 
when you're down there, is to just do everything real slow." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm like, No problem," says Smith. "I'm slow up here. . . . I'm sure I'll be 
slow down there." 
</P>
<P>
Smith will bring her dry wit and measured style of delivery to the Laff Stop in 
Newport Beach on Thursday for two shows. 
</P>
<P>
By then she may have worked her Hawaiian scuba-diving experience into her act. 
</P>
<P>
"It's marinating now," she said in a phone interview from her home in Los 
Angeles last week. "It's like certain things have to sit with you for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Called "the Nurse Ratched of stand-up" by one critic, Smith has a comedy style 
that has been described as caustic and droll -- her slow, careful delivery 
labeled laconic and morose. 
</P>
<P>
But don't say she lacks energy on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm bothered when somebody calls me low energy because I think I'm just a 
different kind of energy." A pause. "I think I'm like nuclear energy. You don't 
see it, but you know it's there." 
</P>
<P>
Another pause, then: "I don't know, I believe in pauses. . . . I mean jazz 
wouldn't be jazz if it weren't for the great pauses." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, whose TV credits include "Late Night With David Letterman" and 
"A&amp;E's Evening at the Improv" once unnerved "Good Morning America" host 
Joan Lunden during an interview because she didn't answer Lunden's questions 
quickly enough. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," Smith says, "this occurred to me in Hawaii because it was so 
peaceful there and I got to unwind: I think there are opportunities I don't get 
because people are afraid of my rhythm. . . . I don't know, I'm 35 years old, I 
think to myself, I'm a subtle person." 
</P>
<P>
Smith describes her comedy style by saying, "I kind of have a next-door 
neighbor approach. It's almost like I'm out in the back yard by the picket 
fence hanging clothes and I'm talking to you. But the content is that of 
someone that you might be afraid to bring home to mom." 
</P>
<P>
She grew up in a blue-collar section of Chicago, the kind of place "where the 
guys don't wear shorts because only pansies wear shorts, and you work hard all 
week and earn the right to be in a bar all weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who studied improvisation at Second City before moving to New York in 
the early '80s, draws from her adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote this poem when I was 15," she says on stage, "and it goes like this: 
'I am the sea. You are the river. You run to me. I take you in. I hate my 
parents.' " 
</P>
<P>
Here she is complaining that her parents let her sister take piano lessons 
simply because she was fat: "Like the world needs another fat piano player." 
</P>
<P>
Although she describes her own childhood as "typical," Smith says of her act: 
"I think everything is based on something true, but I might color it a little." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who has a bit part in "GoodFellas" with Robert DeNiro, is writing a 
short film of her own. She is also collaborating with an artist friend on a 
comic book. 
</P>
<P>
But she has another ambition. When she was trying to break into comedy in New 
York, she worked as a cook -- "and a good cook," she says. She still loves to 
cook. "And I still fantasize about opening a restaurant. I'd call it Eat Your 
Vegetables. And you wouldn't be able to get your dessert unless you ate them." 
</P>
<P>
She paused, then laughed and said: "Kind of a mean restaurant."

BEATLES SOUND IS A TICKET TO RIDE FOR S.F.'S JELLYFISH; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: THE GROUP, PLAYING FOR FREE TODAY AT CAL STATE FULLERTON, SERVES A 
USEFUL ROLE IN KEEPING ALIVE THE PAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Virtually all pop music is theft. What separates the dullards from the smart 
guys in this year's rookie class is how well they've learned to steal. 
</P>
<P>
Clumsy burglars like the Black Crowes and London Quireboys have tried to raid 
the grit-stained sonic wardrobe of early-'70s Rolling Stones and Faces, swiping 
it right off the rack and donning it without adding any accessories of their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
It takes charm and wit and lyrical ingenuity to pull off a stylish heist. For a 
crafty thief, the Rolling Stones legacy ought to be like Ft. Knox with the 
doors unbarred. But the Crowes and the Quireboys' albums sound more like the 
work of small-timers knocking off the neighborhood 7-Eleven. 
</P>
<P>
Jellyfish, the San Francisco band responsible for one of the year's zestiest 
pure-pop debut albums, appears to have the knack of a master safecracker. A 
good deal of the legal tender that Jellyfish grabs from the vault of pop-music 
past carries the likeness of John, Paul, George and Ringo. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent phone interview, the band's songwriting team, singer-drummer Andy 
Sturmer and keyboards player Roger Manning, recalled how they got their 
introduction to the Beatles from '70s bands that stole from the Beatles -- 
proving that pop thievery, in addition to its purely exploitative angles, can 
serve a useful role in keeping alive the past. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember hearing a Beatles song and going, 'So that's where ELO's first few 
albums came from!' " said Sturmer, 25, who will front Jellyfish in a free 
outdoor concert at noon today at Cal State Fullerton. "When you're a kid and 
you're listening to the radio and ELO comes on, you think, 'What an original 
sound.' You don't know where it's coming from." 
</P>
<P>
Manning, 24, said it would be "the ultimate form of flattery" if some 
uninitiated young fan were to conclude that Jellyfish's first album, 
"Bellybutton," were a work of great originality. 
</P>
<P>
With Beatles quotations spread hither and yon, that's not quite so. 
</P>
<P>
Take "The King Is Half-Undressed," a song that is getting lots of play on MTV. 
It features Beatlesque harpsichord, lush vocal harmonies straight out of Side 2 
of "Abbey Road," plus a rhythmic intro nicked from "Ticket to Ride." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the demonstration of craft involved in pulling off a sure-handed 
Beatles heist, Jellyfish comes up with some vibrant touches of its own that 
separate it from lesser pop thieves. There is always something fresh about a 
good, catchy melody, and the choruses of songs such as "The King Is 
Half-Undressed," "The Man I Used to Be" and "All I Want Is Everything" are 
eminently catchy. 
</P>
<P>
Jellyfish also uses its borrowed musical styles to outfit some imaginative 
lyrical ideas. "The King Is Half-Undressed" evokes the void of human feeling in 
a prostitute's encounter with a client. "The Man I Used to Be" is a lament sung 
by the ghost of a dead sailor who watches over his son, fearing that the boy 
will follow his footsteps into the military. 
</P>
<P>
And "All I Want Is Everything" contains a pop thief's wry confession, while 
reveling in some cheeky, absurdist commentary about pop-star attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
I think I'd like to play guitar and 
</P>
<P>
 be a Beatle, 
</P>
<P>
That'd be so swell. 
</P>
<P>
And every show I would just 
</P>
<P>
 dedicate this song to you. 
</P>
<P>
And I would envy all my fans 
</P>
<P>
While I bitch about the price of 
</P>
<P>
 fame 
</P>
<P>
To my French maid, Lou-Ann. 
</P>
<P>
She looks so sincere, but she don't 
</P>
<P>
 understand. 
</P>
<P>
Sturmer said: "I think anyone writing music in 1990 owes a huge debt to (the 
Beatles). There are definitely quotes (from them on the album), but there are 
also quotes from elsewhere. Reading it totally (as a Beatles homage) would be 
missing the point." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't just the music that points back to the '60s, though. Jellyfish has 
wrapped itself in fab, far-out imagery. On the album, and in publicity 
pictures, the four members are decked out like denizens of Haight-Ashbury or 
Carnaby Street, circa 1967, sporting top hats, bell-bottoms, platform shoes and 
effusive, clashing colors. The album cover casts the band members as 
psychedelic Lilliputians, clambering about a prone nude who has been liberally 
decorated with swirls of what looks like blue gel toothpaste. 
</P>
<P>
"This band has always enjoyed presenting itself colorfully," Manning said. "A 
lot of that stuff we wear day in and day out. We just raided a lot of thrift 
stores." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than copying the image of the Beatles or of their own San Franciscan 
forebears from the Summer of Love, what Jellyfish had in mind was to recall 
figures from children's lore, such as Willy Wonka and Doctor Doolittle. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the image gives the band a definite '60s-rock association. With a look 
like that, Jellyfish members surely could get a seat on the Magical Mystery 
Tour bus without paying the fare. 
</P>
<P>
Fittingly enough, Jellyfish played its first tour as the opening act for World 
Party, whose leader, Karl Wallinger, is one of pop's expert thieves -- a 
confirmed purloiner of Beatles, Stones, Dylan and Prince. World Party's 
computer-aided, note-for-note live replication of the Beatles' epic, "A Day in 
the Life," demonstrated that if fate would have allowed it, the Fab Four could 
have returned to the concert stage they shunned after 1966 because their music 
had grown too elaborate to re-create live. 
</P>
<P>
With elaborate orchestrations of its own -- full of strings, horns, breezy 
harmonica melodies and multilayered voices -- Jellyfish has a choice to make: 
How much machine-aided replication should the band permit itself on stage? 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the songs," Manning said, "we strip down from the album (version) and 
make them more raw. Others are just like the record. We definitely have a few 
sampling things going in the keyboard department. But we try to steer clear of 
that as much as possible. Bashing out horn parts on the keyboard is not natural 
or convincing to me." 
</P>
<P>
The band doesn't rely on electronic boosting to fill out its layered harmonies, 
Sturmer said: "People come up to our sound man all the time and look for a 
tape, or to see if we're sampling things (to aid the voices). But we're big 
Beach Boys fanatics, and we can blend and harmonize." 
</P>
<P>
To carry out his unusual role as both the drummer and lead singer, Sturmer 
plays his stripped-down drum kit from a stand-up position at the front of the 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
Sturmer and Manning said they have known each other since they were high school 
students in Pleasanton, in Alameda County. They were recruited into Beatnik 
Beatch, a San Francisco band that played a spare, Bohemian brand of pop and 
released one album in 1988. Sturmer and Manning left to pursue their own more 
rock-oriented direction, along with guitarist Jason Falkner. After the album 
was recorded, Manning's brother, Chris, joined as the bassist. 
</P>
<P>
Helping Jellyfish forge the detailed sound of "Bellybutton" was producer Albhy 
Galaten, who was part of the Bee Gees' production team during their string of 
disco hits in the mid-'70s. 
</P>
<P>
According to Manning, the parts on the album that seem like Beatles' quotes 
weren't conscious references. "We don't say, 'You know what this song needs? It 
needs backing vocals that sound like "She's Leaving Home." ' If we've all been 
listening to something that week, the sounds are rattling around in your head. 
You open your mouth and that comes out." 
</P>
<P>
What if the members of Jellyfish stopped listening to their favorite pop music, 
as some songwriters say they do to avoid too much outside influence? 
</P>
<P>
No way, Sturmer said. "It's food to me."

FUND-RAISING NEEDS CREATE ETHICS DILEMMA FOR WILSON; 
</P>
<P>
NEWS ANALYSIS: RECORD SHOWS HE HAS INTERVENED FOR BIG DONORS. SENATOR SAYS HE 
IS SERVING PUBLIC INTEREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Although he has harshly criticized his opponent in the governor's race for 
taking special-interest money, Pete Wilson has himself intervened on behalf of 
a number of political supporters with a considerable stake in federal 
government decisions, a review of his record in the U.S. Senate shows. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, at the request of his campaign contributors, has lobbied against 
banning a potentially hazardous food dye; urged a federal agency not to impose 
a $5-million penalty against citrus growers; fought regulators to prevent 
closing an Orange County investment firm; pressed authorities to reconsider 
their denial of a controversial railroad merger; arranged a meeting with top 
Justice Department officials for a longtime friend, and blocked a bill that 
would require stricter safety standards for industrial bolts, according to 
documents and interviews. 
</P>
<P>
These backers have contributed to Wilson's Senate and gubernatorial campaigns, 
and some have an interest in California issues that require the governor's 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican senator defended his actions by saying that he strives to serve 
the legitimate needs of his constituents. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no quid pro quo in any decision. You do not (help a supporter) for 
campaign contributions. You do it only because it . . . benefits the public," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson cited a 24-year political career built on strong campaign ethics -- the 
same point he underscored earlier this month when he accused Democratic 
challenger Dianne Feinstein during a televised debate of compromising herself 
by accepting $150,000 from the organization that represents state Highway 
Patrol officers. 
</P>
<P>
"Dianne, I am truly shocked that you would be so blind to such a gross conflict 
of interest," Wilson said as he lectured Feinstein on the impropriety of 
accepting a large contribution from an organization of state employees whose 
salary is set by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson sought the endorsement of the same CHP group but did not seek a 
contribution. He also solicited political and financial support from three 
similar organizations that represent nearly 100,000 state workers whose pay the 
governor also approves. Among them are California prison guards, who are 
gearing up to independently spend as much as $150,000 to help Wilson in the 
waning days of the governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the amount that he has received directly from state employees -- at 
least $13,000 -- is not enough to pose a conflict, and not nearly on a par with 
the $150,000 that CHP officers gave Feinstein's campaign. He also said he 
cannot be held responsible for the large sum that prison guards are prepared to 
spend on their own to help him get elected. 
</P>
<P>
The contrast between Wilson's public statements as a candidate and his lobbying 
efforts as a senator illustrates the central dilemma he faces in running for 
governor of the nation's most populous state. 
</P>
<P>
As Wilson continues to carefully craft the image of a politician with high 
ethical standards, his need to raise huge amounts of campaign money has made 
him vulnerable to the same kind of criticism that he dishes out at his rival. 
</P>
<P>
In the real world of politics, serving constituents is a necessity for a 
successful politician, and so is raising a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert E. Alexander, political science professor at USC, said the problem 
arises because special-interest groups are the most ready source of campaign 
contributions. "Without public funding or more party assistance," Alexander 
said, "candidates are bound to go to funding sources that may prove to be 
embarrassing at a later date." This dilemma is magnified by Wilson's prowess as 
the leading fund-raiser in Congress -- he has collected more than $27 million 
over the last decade for two Senate races and the governor's contest thus far 
in a state that is one of the most expensive in which to mount a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The next California governor will take office at a time when the ethical 
guidelines for public officials are undergoing intense scrutiny. For years, the 
rules governing how far lawmakers should go in helping their constituents have 
been fuzzy or nonexistent. But in the wake of the savings and loan scandal in 
Washington and the FBI's ongoing corruption probe in Sacramento, the boundaries 
between elected officials and their contributors are beginning to take shape. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was clearly drawn last month when a federal jury in Sacramento 
convicted former state Sen. Paul Carpenter on four counts of racketeering, 
extortion and conspiracy. The jurors relied largely on evidence that Carpenter 
had granted special access to his backers, regardless of whether he aided their 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take a large amount of money," said Charles Mathias Jr., a Maryland 
Republican who served on the Senate Ethics Committee before retiring in 1986, 
"you raise a question about your scruples whenever you do something on behalf 
of a contributor." 
</P>
<P>
As a vigorous defender of California interests on Capitol Hill, Wilson 
maintains that his job is to look after the needs of his constituents. Just 
because they support his campaign, he argues, is no reason to ignore their 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, I do what I do because I think it's right," Wilson said in an hourlong 
interview. "And if you're going to pillory someone who does something he thinks 
is right because he has taken a campaign contribution, then what you're 
essentially saying is . . . you can't help anybody who has a legitimate need 
for help." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he agrees with virtually every political ethics expert on one 
guiding principle: A public official must always act in the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
The definition of public interest often is in the eye of the beholder, and some 
of Wilson's actions have raised questions: 
</P>
<P>
* In 1984 and again in 1988, he asked the Food and Drug Administration to delay 
acting on a proposed ban of red dye No. 3, a potentially cancer-causing color 
additive used to brighten lipstick, pistachios and maraschino cherries. The FDA 
issued the ban last January as required by law after finding that the dye 
induced cancerous tumors in laboratory rats, although the risk to humans was 
found to be small. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson wrote the FDA in June, 1988, saying that "scientists feel the color is 
safe" and that a study sponsored by the food industry would "resolve any 
lingering doubts." California fruit growers say the dye is critical to their 
livelihood because marketing studies have shown that consumers stop buying 
fruit cocktail when the bright red maraschino cherry is omitted. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA delayed the ban because it needed time to review the industry data that 
Wilson cited in his letter, said spokesman Bill Grigg. Wilson, a member of the 
Senate Agriculture Committee, was one of many California congressmen who 
expressed an interest in the dye issue. 
</P>
<P>
* Between 1985 and 1988, Wilson received more money from the agriculture 
industry -- $235,755 -- than any other political action committee, according to 
a Common Cause study. While the red dye ban was one of many issues of interest 
to agribusiness during that period, the fruit growers most directly threatened 
by the issue also have contributed at least $4,800 to Wilson's gubernatorial 
campaign, records show. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he lobbied to extend the ban, Wilson said, "What is red dye No. 3? 
I'm sure I didn't write the letter." When shown his signature on his official 
stationery, Wilson said that his staff must have reproduced his name using an 
automatic signature machine. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen Health Group, which led the fight 
against the dye, said that Wilson joined a lobbying effort that ignored the 
public good. "Wilson thinks that the interests of people selling fruit 
cosmetics are more important than the health concerns of the public," Wolfe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
* Wilson urged the Federal Trade Commission in February, 1986, not to seek a 
$5-million civil penalty against Sunkist Growers Inc. for allegedly attempting 
to monopolize several citrus markets. The agency had filed a complaint against 
Sunkist, contending that it had illegally cornered the market on the sale and 
distribution of oranges and lemons in the United States and Canada, said FTC 
spokesman Howard Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
Sunkist was ordered to dispose of its citrus processing plant in Yuma, Ariz., 
by February, 1983. Sunkist, a cooperative of 6,175 individual citrus growers in 
California and Arizona, faced a huge fine for not selling the plant until 
August, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Sunkist Vice President Curtis W. Anderson criticized the FTC action, saying, 
"It just seemed like harassment." Sunkist officials took their case to Wilson, 
who in turn wrote a letter to the FTC. The agency assured the senator that his 
views would be "carefully considered" before a civil penalty was imposed. Five 
months later, Sunkist and the FTC agreed to a $375,000 settlement. 
</P>
<P>
According to Wilson aides, the senator most likely discussed the case with 
William Quarles, a Sunkist vice president who later raised $28,200 from fruit 
growers around the state for Wilson's gubernatorial campaign, records show. 
Sunkist has donated an additional $6,000 to Wilson's campaign for governor and 
$14,000 in Senate contributions. 
</P>
<P>
The commission would not say what role, if any, Wilson's intervention had on 
its decision. Said spokesman Shapiro: "It would take a lot of influence to go 
from $5 million to $375,000, but I am in no position to speculate." 
</P>
<P>
* In 1986, Wilson vowed to do everything within his power to prevent some 
members of Congress from using legislation to close Monex International Ltd., 
an embattled Newport Beach precious metals dealer. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators were pushing to shut down the leverage trading industry 
after thousands of investors lost $100 million over four years in credit 
purchases of precious metals through Monex and three other firms. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to bat for them," Wilson told The Times in an earlier interview. "I 
thought 200 people employed in a legitimate business should not be put out of 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson prevailed and Monex was allowed to keep operating. Later, the company's 
owner, Louis E. Carabini, offered to help Wilson as an expression of gratitude, 
Wilson recalled. After declining financial support from Carabini, Wilson later 
accepted $6,000 for his Senate and gubernatorial campaigns and $1,426 in 
expenses for a weekend trip at a Florida resort. 
</P>
<P>
After he was questioned by The Times last December, Wilson returned all of the 
money. "It turned out to be an enormous pain in the ass," he said recently. 
</P>
<P>
* Wilson asked the Interstate Commerce Commission to reconsider its denial of a 
controversial merger between the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroads in 
September, 1986, at a time when a railroad official involved in the deal was 
one of his biggest fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
The ICC rejected the merger in 1987 because of concern that it could limit 
competition and drive up shipping prices for Central Valley farmers. Wilson, in 
urging a reversal, wrote a letter in which he cited concerns about Southern 
Pacific's "deteriorating financial condition." 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin F. Biaggini, an architect of the merger and a board member of the 
Santa Fe holding company, estimated that he helped Wilson raise "between 
$300,000 and $400,000" for his 1988 Senate reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Biaggini, who left the holding company in 1988, said he never approached Wilson 
regarding the merger. Wilson said he was "certainly aware" of Biaggini's 
position with the struggling railroad when he wrote the ICC letter. Wilson said 
he intervened because it was the right thing to do, and that Biaggini's 
involvement had no bearing on his support. 
</P>
<P>
* Wilson arranged and attended a meeting in January, 1987, with top U.S. 
Justice Department officials in hopes of obtaining FBI help to investigate a 
fire that destroyed a Puerto Rico hotel owned by a longtime political supporter 
and personal friend. 
</P>
<P>
The friend, wealthy Los Angeles businessman Brian Corbell, told Wilson he 
wanted the FBI to provide security for his employees in the weeks after the 
deadly fire at the Dupont Plaza Hotel and to determine the cause, which he 
believed was arson linked to labor unrest. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-seven people were killed and 140 injured in the fire on New Year's Eve, 
1986. Corbell and his partners stood to lose a fortune. So far, more than $100 
million in legal settlements has been awarded, said attorneys familiar with the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Corbell said he was relieved when the Justice Department, which had already 
shown an interest in the case, agreed to increase the FBI's visible presence 
around the hotel and reasserted its commitment to investigate the fire. A 
Democrat who has supported Wilson for years, Corbell said he has contributed at 
least several thousand dollars to Wilson's various political campaigns and 
solicited at least several thousand more through friends and associates. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he would have provided the same service for a total stranger. 
"Hell, I thought he was entitled to all of the law enforcement help he could 
get. That's why we went to the FBI," he said. "I was approached by a man who 
said, 'I am dealing with gangsters. I am frightened. I need help.' " 
</P>
<P>
Richard Brown, a San Francisco attorney who represents 60 hotel employees 
injured in the fire, called Wilson's intervention highly improper. 
</P>
<P>
"If a private citizen could use the influence and power of a federal 
investigative agency like the FBI or IRS for his own civil protection . . . I 
think it would be an impermissible use of the government," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department officials said that such meetings with top law enforcement 
authorities are not routinely requested by senators. The officials said they 
did not regard the incident as unusual, particularly because Corbell was 
offering to cooperate with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Three former hotel employees pleaded guilty to arson and were sentenced to 
prison terms of up to 99 years, but union officials have denied any involvement 
in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
* Wilson came under criticism this month for holding up legislation that 
advocates claim would ensure the quality of heavy-duty bolts that have been 
found at fault in a number of construction and aerospace accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson took the action after his staff received a call from Ron Cedillos, a 
Long Beach supporter, who said he wanted the bill strengthened with amendments 
that would require testing of industrial fasteners by outside firms. Cedillos 
operates a firm that does this testing. 
</P>
<P>
Cedillos was host of a fund-raising event at his plant last year that yielded 
$140,000 for Wilson's gubernatorial campaign. Officials of other Southern 
California firms that support the legislation said they have been unable to 
reach Wilson. "We've never had a call returned," said Mary Ann Langholtz, a 
fastener industry lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who maintained that his sole intention was to pass a tougher bill, said 
he was unaware that his office had failed to return calls from the fastener 
lobby. 
</P>
<P>
The California senator has told his Washington staff that he is willing "to 
take the heat" for appearing to bail out a large campaign contributor "as long 
as the decision is right on its merits," said aide Ira Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
In his defense, Wilson said his decisions frequently run counter to the wishes 
of even his biggest contributors. He cited a recent study by consumer advocate 
Ralph Nader that linked major contributions by the oil and auto industry to 
Senate votes on environmental legislation. While many of the leading 
fund-raisers in the Senate were rated "poor" on clean air issues, Wilson voted 
"correct" 100% of the time, the Nader study found. 
</P>
<P>
"You can find cases where he went against people who were fund-raising 
supporters," said Otto Bos, Wilson's campaign director. "If you make decisions 
based on merit, you don't run into this problem." 
</P>
<P>
To avoid any appearance that his votes or influence are for sale, Wilson has 
taken certain precautions over the last two decades: He has been a strong 
supporter of limits on individual contributions; has formed a special committee 
to screen campaign donations for potential conflicts of interest, and has 
placed his personal assets in a blind trust to avoid knowingly participating in 
issues that could affect his pocketbook. 
</P>
<P>
As mayor of San Diego, Wilson enacted what he called the state's toughest 
campaign finance law, which made it a criminal offense to accept a campaign 
contribution in excess of $250 -- a point he emphasized during the Oct. 7 
debate with Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
During the gubernatorial campaign, Wilson has sent back about $40,000 in 
contributions, including money from the toxic waste industry, Bos said. The 
Wilson camp was concerned about how the political transactions would look for 
Wilson as well as for contributors who could become the subject of Feinstein 
attacks, Bos said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also returned $17,500 in Senate campaign contributions last year to 
Charles H. Keating Jr., who faces charges of securities fraud in the sale of 
junk bonds at branches of the Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Wilson's efforts to insulate himself from criticism have not always 
worked: 
</P>
<P>
* He chastised Feinstein for taking advantage of a court ruling that overturned 
individual $1,000 limits on campaign contributions and, at the same time, began 
soliciting large donations himself. Only later, after two more court rulings, 
did he publicly announce that he would accept such contributions. 
</P>
<P>
* He returned $6,000 in contributions after going to bat for Monex. However, 
Wilson later kept $50,000 raised by Hollywood executives a month after 
arranging a meeting at their behest with top Justice Department officials -- an 
action that prompted a critical article in the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
* He set up a blind trust to shield his assets, then put his best friend in 
charge of managing his investments. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson acknowledged that he has no policy for deciding when it is appropriate 
to accept a campaign donation or lobby on behalf of a major contributor. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no hard and fast rules," he said. "Obviously, it's a question of 
judgment." 
</P>
<P>
During the recent campaign debate, Wilson narrowed these guidelines when he 
attacked Feinstein for taking money from the California Assn. of Highway 
Patrolmen. His claim that Feinstein would be compromised by the CHP money is 
drawing charges of hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Noble, president of the CHP group, said Wilson flew from Washington twice 
during the summer in an effort to win the group's endorsement. While the 
subject of money was not discussed, Noble said, Wilson should have expected to 
receive financial support. The officers' association was prepared to make a 
$5,000 donation and pump up to $300,000 into an independent advertising blitz 
on behalf of their chosen candidate, said Noble. 
</P>
<P>
"Hypocritical is a good word," said Noble, a patrol officer assigned to the San 
Francisco office. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he was only interested in the patrol officers' endorsement. "I 
never asked them for a dime," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign records and interviews show that the Republican candidate asked for 
and received a more modest $13,000 from two other associations representing 
office workers, administrative law judges and attorneys -- all state employees 
whose salaries the governor must approve. 
</P>
<P>
The state's prison guards, whose salaries are also set by the governor, have 
endorsed Wilson. Don Novey, president of the 22,000-member California 
Correctional Peace Officers Assn., said the group intends to launch an 
independent campaign for Wilson that will be competitive with the Highway 
Patrol officers' contribution to Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
For Wilson or any other statewide candidate to campaign on ethics is open to 
question, said Jim Wheaton, former executive director of California Common 
Cause, a public-interest group that lobbies for ethics reform. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to distinguish who is more beholden to the special interests. 
All candidates for all state offices are in an arms race for dollars and, 
understandably, the people who are the easiest to go to are those with a 
pocketbook interest in what happens in Sacramento," said Wheaton, who heads the 
Proposition 131 campaign, which calls for term limits and public financing of 
political races. 
</P>
<P>
The growing public cynicism over campaign fund-raising, Wilson said, is part of 
a strategy by reformers such as Common Cause to drive honest people from 
politics because of "insults to their integrity." 
</P>
<P>
Said Wilson: "They want to make life so unpleasant for people . . . that they 
will finally create a climate in which people will finally throw in the towel 
and say, 'Aw, the hell with it. Let's have public financing. I've had enough of 
this.' "

PARKS DIRECTOR OPPOSES FOREIGN ROLE IN YOSEMITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Park Service director has told the chairman of MCA Inc., the owner 
of Yosemite National Park's main concession and the object of a possible 
takeover by a Japanese firm, that the federal government would prefer to keep 
the park operation in American hands. 
</P>
<P>
National Park Service Director James Ridenour telephoned MCA Chairman Lew R. 
Wasserman late last week after the Park Service received dozens of letters from 
citizens objecting to a foreign-owned firm running the accommodations in a 
national park, a National Park Service spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"What is driving this is these (national parks) are America's national 
treasures, and while foreign owners have the right to invest in the United 
States, that doesn't mean they should be buying up all of America," said Steven 
Goldstein, spokesman for Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, who presides over the 
National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
"People identify Yosemite . . . with mom and apple pie." 
</P>
<P>
An Interior Department source said Ridenour called partly in response to 
indications that the Japanese firm, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., might 
not be interested in acquiring the Yosemite operation because the purchase 
would trigger "bad publicity" for the company. 
</P>
<P>
Ridenour suggested to Wasserman that MCA talk to the Yosemite Restoration 
Trust, a not-for-profit group formed by environmentalists to compete for the 
concession contract, to other potential bidders or to the National Park Service 
about buying the Yosemite operation, the park spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the price is right, the government would be interested," said Park Service 
spokesman George Berklacy, quoting Ridenour. 
</P>
<P>
The Park Service's contract with the Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co., an MCA 
subsidiary, expires in 1993. The company owns lodgings, restaurants and stores 
in the park. 
</P>
<P>
Berklacy said the Park Service has received "pretty strong" letters, "all 
negative," from the public upset about the possibility of a foreign-owned firm 
running a concession in a National Park. Although such ownership is not barred 
by law, there currently is no park concession owned by a foreign company, 
Interior Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a sort of prejudice, this whole issue of Japanese 
investment," Berklacy said. "It's not MCA, it's Yosemite specifically (that 
unnerves the public), a concession in an American park being operated by a 
foreign firm." 
</P>
<P>
Curry Co. profits, criticized by environmental groups as excessive, represent 
only a small fraction of MCA's overall earnings. MCA's holdings include 
Universal Studios, record companies, a film library and a television station. 
Matsushita is one of Japan's largest consumer electronics companies. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the takeover negotiations first surfaced in a news report Sept. 25 but 
neither company has discussed details or how much progress has been made. 
Outside financial analysts previously had speculated that should the deal go 
through, the Curry Company would be sold to a buyer other than Matsushita, as 
would MCA's New Jersey television station, which under law cannot be sold to a 
foreign owner. 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita is aware of the "sensitivity" over Yosemite, said an industry source 
close to the situation. "Curry does not fit Matsushita's strategic focus," said 
the source, noting that the possible friendly takeover is in only "the second 
inning of the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita, MCA and the Curry Company declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Secretary Lujan was described by aides as personally unhappy about the 
possibility of a foreign-owned park concession. An Interior official said Lujan 
refuses to stay at Japanese-owned hotels, and Goldstein, Lujan's spokesman, 
confirmed that the secretary believes in buying "all American." 
</P>
<P>
"He won't buy a foreign car, and he discourages his staff from buying a foreign 
car," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein and other Interior Department officials said Wasserman listened 
politely to Ridenour but did not express an opinion on the subject or offer to 
sell the Curry Co. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, this is a fluid situation, and we do have a dog in this fight," 
Goldstein said. "So we want to make sure that everyone is clear on where the 
Interior Department stands." 
</P>
<P>
The MCA-owned Curry Co. has been under siege during the past year by 
environmentalists who complain that the company has made Yosemite too 
commercial and cluttered. The company has fought back aggressively, contending 
that it has acted only at the direction of the Park Service and has placed 
environmental programs among its highest priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Reiss, a spokeswoman for the Yosemite Restoration Trust, said she was 
pleased to learn about Ridenour's call, but added that foreign ownership is 
"not an issue for the trust." 
</P>
<P>
"The trust is willing to compete against whomever ends up owning the Curry 
Co.," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Reiss also said she thought it would be a "great idea" if the Park Service 
acquired the company's holdings in Yosemite. They have been estimated as high 
as $200 million, but Reiss says the trust believes they are worth less than 
$100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Purchasing a concession would not be unprecedented for the Park Service. It 
bought the Yellowstone National Park concession in 1979 for $20 million and 
leased it to a private company to operate. Berklacy said the concession 
buildings at the time needed $100 million in upgrading, and the Park Service 
has plowed its revenues from Yellowstone into repairing the buildings.

ETHICS ACTION SET AFTER ELECTION IN 'KEATING 5' CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON and MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate Ethics Committee on Tuesday set public hearings Nov. 15 on ties 
between savings and loan magnate Charles H. Keating Jr. and five senators. 
</P>
<P>
In deciding on the hearings, the panel reportedly rejected a recommendation by 
special counsel Robert S. Bennett to launch a full-scale inquiry into the 
actions of Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and two of his Democratic colleagues 
and to drop charges against two others, one a Democrat and the other a 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
The action was viewed by some Republicans as an effort to ensure that their 
party -- not just the Democrats -- is left on the hook through the Nov. 6 
congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
Emerging from closed-door deliberations, Ethics Committee Chairman Howell 
Heflin (D-Ala.) and Vice Chairman Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.) released a panel 
resolution stating that next month's hearings will provide "a full exposition 
of the facts, so that each of the five members can respond to the allegations 
made against him." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution said that in the open hearings the panel will be able to "judge 
credibility and determine whether there is reason to believe any improper 
conduct may have occurred, and the American people can hear all the evidence." 
</P>
<P>
The committee said that "except in extraordinary circumstances" it would 
conclude its proceedings before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to the committee Sept. 10, Bennett reportedly had recommended that 
the panel drop cases against Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. John Glenn 
(D-Ohio). 
</P>
<P>
Bennett had recommended an intensified investigation of Cranston and Sens. 
Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) on grounds that 
they had much more extensive dealings with Keating in trying to help him 
resolve his problems with federal thrift regulators. 
</P>
<P>
All five senators intervened with regulators on behalf of Keating and his 
ailing Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. In addition, they received a total of 
$1.3 million in contributions from Keating for their campaigns and other 
causes. All have denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston hailed the committee's action Tuesday, saying that "the public is 
entitled to get beyond the malicious rumors and selective leaks and to know all 
the facts. I see this as an opportunity to achieve the public vindication I 
know I deserve." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's reference to leaks involved confidential committee documents that 
surfaced last week showing extensive actions that he, DeConcini and Riegle had 
taken to help Keating. 
</P>
<P>
Among the information in the documents were references to late-night and 
early-morning telephone calls placed by Cranston and DeConcini to the unlisted 
home number of a federal regulator, Roger F. Martin. 
</P>
<P>
In an affidavit, Martin said the senators used "almost exactly the same words," 
urging him and his colleagues on the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to meet with 
an investor group that could have taken Lincoln off Keating's hands at a time 
when it was on the verge of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine-based thrift ultimately was seized by the government in April, 1989, 
at a potential cost to taxpayers of more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Although the committee did not disclose its votes, sources said Bennett's 
proposal to dismiss McCain and Glenn from further investigation failed to win 
approval on a tie vote, with the panel's three Republicans voting in favor and 
Heflin and two other Democrats voting against. 
</P>
<P>
Such action would have left only Cranston, DeConcini and Riegle -- all 
Democrats -- under a cloud, giving Republicans a potential campaign issue, even 
though none of the three is up for reelection this year. In addition, some 
Democrats suspect McCain's office of having instigated the leaks of committee 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution calling for hearings next month into the actions of all five 
senators was approved unanimously, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn and McCain bitterly criticized the committee's refusal to drop them from 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
McCain said the committee's failure to act was "an outrage" and called its 
refusal to make the special counsel's report public "an act of political 
cowardice." 
</P>
<P>
"I am incredibly puzzled by this bizarre and clearly unprecedented decision by 
the Ethics Committee," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and other Republicans had demanded 
earlier that the committee act on the recommendations before Congress adjourns, 
accusing the panel of inexcusable delays. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn declined to attack the committee's motives but said the panel was going 
back on a guarantee it made to handle the charges against him and the other 
senators on an individual basis. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said angrily, "all five of us will be lined up at the same table" 
at the Nov. 15 hearing, and "all of you (the media) will have a field day." 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be treated as an individual, not as part of a group," Glenn said, 
suggesting that he does not want to be tarred with the same brush as senators 
who may be faced with more damaging evidence. "I know what John Glenn did. I 
have no idea what others did." 
</P>
<P>
Heflin said the unusual decision to depart from the customary secrecy that 
surrounds the committee's deliberations was motivated by a need to "promote 
public confidence in the integrity of the Senate."

RESCUERS TOW HUMPHREY THE WHALE TO SAFETY

In a spectacular rescue of Humphrey the whale, dozens of volunteers and members 
of the Coast Guard on Tuesday towed the lethargic humpback from the muddy tidal 
flat where he was stuck overnight and herded him out into San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
By nightfall, the Coast Guard reported that the whale was last sighted north of 
San Francisco and was swimming on a course that could take him under the Golden 
Gate Bridge and back into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 4,000 cheering people lined the shore at the midafternoon high 
tide to watch as rescuers slipped a harness over the errant whale's head and a 
Coast Guard boat pulled him backward into deeper water. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-ton whale welcomed his new-found freedom by promptly beaching himself on 
the muddy shore several hundred yards away. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going the wrong way," shouted one man in the crowd, capturing the 
essence of Humphrey's exploits inside the Golden Gate. 
</P>
<P>
But rescuers, racing against the changing tide, once again used the harness -- 
a cargo net -- and this time were able to haul him to safety. 
</P>
<P>
When he reached open water minutes later, Humphrey characteristically tried to 
head south, toward San Jose, but a fleet of eight boats succeeded in steering 
him northward in the proper direction. The rescue boats stayed with him until 
dark, but gave up when they could no longer track his movements. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very positive turn of events," said Marc Webber, a marine biologist 
with the Marine Mammal Center who helped coordinate the rescue. "We'll just 
have to resume the search tomorrow morning and hope that he's not beached 
himself again." 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey, who swam into San Francisco Bay and up the Sacramento River in 1985, 
apparently returned to the bay on Sunday. He beached himself Monday afternoon 
in the mud near Candlestick Park and was stuck there for more than 24 hours 
before rescue crews were able to dislodge him. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Humphrey was trapped in a small slough of the Sacramento River 
25 miles south of the state capital. In an equally dramatic rescue, volunteers 
were able to coax him to safety through a small opening in a bridge that had 
blocked his path. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, scientists said the 40-foot whale apparently suffered no serious 
ill effects from his latest misadventure -- despite having spent nearly four 
hours completely out of the water at low tide Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Whale experts had worried that, while Humphrey was stranded on land, the weight 
of his body could crush his bones or exert such pressure on his lungs that he 
could not breathe. 
</P>
<P>
But after examining him Tuesday morning, Marine Mammal Center veterinarian 
Laurie Gage said she could detect no health problems from his overnight stay at 
the beach. In addition, she said, blood tests indicated that Humphrey had no 
serious infection, a problem that sometimes causes marine mammals to beach 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"It could just be that he's wayward again," said Gage, who participated in the 
rescue of Humphrey five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since that first rescue, the humpback has been sighted each year by researchers 
studying whales off the Northern California coast. Repeatedly he has shown a 
propensity to hang out in shallow water, and he once swam in close to the shore 
of Bodega Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, researchers took a skin sample from Humphrey, conducted a DNA 
analysis and proved conclusively that he is a male. 
</P>
<P>
After Humphrey beached himself Monday on a small island 100 yards offshore, 
dozens of volunteers from the Marine Mammal Center worked through the night to 
keep him wet and prevent him from overheating. At high tide, about 3 a.m. 
Tuesday, they attempted to push him off the mud, without success. 
</P>
<P>
At the next high tide Tuesday afternoon, volunteers freed him from the gooey 
muck by pumping compressed air into the mud beneath him. At the same time, 
other rescuers dived down into the murky water and placed the harness over his 
head so that the 41-foot Coast Guard boat could pull him free. 
</P>
<P>
The huge crowd cheered as Humphrey swam free. But only moments later, the Coast 
Guard boat appeared to cut him off and he beached himself again just 40 yards 
from shore. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers jumped back into the water from their small rubber boats and replaced 
the harness. To shouts of "Go, go, go," and an immense ovation, the Coast Guard 
vessel again towed Humphrey to safety.

TV PULLS PLUG ON DEBATE BETWEEN WILSON, FEINSTEIN 
</P>

<P>
The second televised debate between gubernatorial candidates Dianne Feinstein 
and Pete Wilson was abruptly canceled Tuesday, two days before it was to occur, 
after a topsy-turvy day of negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates at one point agreed to a satellite-assisted, bicoastal contest 
only to have their television sponsors pull the plug. 
</P>
<P>
At day's end, Republican Wilson and Democrat Feinstein were mulling over a list 
of five days and times offered by KPIX-TV, the San Francisco CBS affiliate that 
was to sponsor the hourlong contest at 8 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the debate has been up in the air for days. Originally, the second 
debate was to be held last Thursday, but it was pushed back a week when Wilson 
returned to Washington to cast votes in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, with the Senate still in session and expected to remain so through 
the rescheduled debate night, Wilson suggested in a letter faxed to Feinstein 
and reporters that the two hold the session from studios 3,000 miles apart. 
Wilson would be in Washington and Feinstein at KPIX-TV. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein quickly faxed back her response, accepting the offer of a bicoastal 
debate and challenging Wilson to a third session. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, KPIX-TV bowed out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's canceled," said station spokeswoman Jennifer Barnett. "It's going to be 
too difficult for us. . . . We'd have to do it from another facility. There's 
too many complexities." 
</P>
<P>
Barnett said the station gave Feinstein and Wilson five alternate dates -- 
Saturday or Sunday at 3 p.m., and the following Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday 
at 8 p.m. The station gave the candidates until today to make a decision and 
stipulated that they agree on a time when both could be present in the San 
Francisco studio. 
</P>
<P>
Already, there were potential problems with rescheduling the debate. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to be in session through the weekend and possibly until 
Tuesday. Wilson could conceivably leave Washington while the Senate was 
meeting, but he would then be playing into Feinstein's recurrent criticism of 
his absences during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The latter of the dates suggested by KPIX would put the debate within five or 
six days of the election, a move that either side might see as limiting its 
flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wilson's campaign ruled out a third debate and accused Feinstein of 
raising the possibility as a diversion. 
</P>
<P>
"Feinstein knows that she's trailing the senator, she's coming out with 
negative hits (advertisements) today -- she's desperate," said Wilson spokesman 
Bill Livingstone. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said in her letter to Wilson that a third debate would be helpful to 
California citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"With Election Day just two weeks away, there is increasing interest in the 
campaign and I believe another debate would be very valuable," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the candidate debates was held Oct. 7 at the Burbank studios of 
KNBC-TV, where Feinstein and Wilson dueled for an hour. The debate earned a 
respectable television audience after the California Assn. of Broadcasters 
worked for months to secure agreements to air the event on more than two dozen 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
The second session was expected to have a much narrower viewership. No large 
Los Angeles television outlet was planning to air the debate live on Thursday.

CENTER USES ANTI-CANCER PROTON BEAM;

<P>
Loma Linda University Medical Center on Tuesday inaugurated the world's first 
hospital-based cancer treatment facility that uses a beam of protons to 
irradiate tumors. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring that their $45-million center marks a "milestone" in cancer 
treatment, Loma Linda officials said proton therapy could ultimately be 
effective for many of the 1 million new patients diagnosed with cancer in the 
United States each year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the use of protons -- positively charged particles in the nucleus of 
atoms -- to destroy cancer cells is not a new concept, Loma Linda's facility is 
the first dedicated solely to medical purposes. Previously, several thousand 
patients have received proton treatments at laboratories designed for physics 
research. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an important beginning," said Dr. James M. Slater, chairman of Loma 
Linda's department of radiation medicine. "If this (treatment) produces the 
benefits we anticipate, there will be many, many centers like this one 
available to cancer patients." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Loma Linda center treated its first patient -- a 35-year-old 
rehabilitation nurse from the Los Angeles area suffering from a tumor in her 
right eye. At a news conference, the patient, Becky Carrillo, said the proton 
treatment gave her hope of retaining her eye and her vision. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very grateful," said Carrillo, who will undergo five treatments and was 
told there is a 96% chance they will destroy her tumor. "My husband said, 
'Don't get your hopes up too high,' . . . but I feel like I've been given 
another chance." 
</P>
<P>
Carrillo was diagnosed with ocular melanoma on Sept. 18 after a partial vision 
loss prompted her to consult an ophthalmologist. Her doctor said the only 
remedy was removal of the eye, but a friend told Carrillo to seek a second 
opinion at Loma Linda, and the medical center agreed to treat her. 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago, several tiny metal rings were sutured around the base of the 
eye tumor to help doctors focus exactly on their target. Tuesday morning, 
Carrillo sat in a padded gray seat resembling a dental chair for her first 
encounter with the proton beam. 
</P>
<P>
Her head was held still by a plastic mask attached to the chair's frame, and 
she was told to focus her eye on a light. There was some minor discomfort, 
caused by having her eyelids stretched open to reveal the eye's surface, but 
otherwise Carrillo called the 67-second treatment "painless." 
</P>
<P>
Proton therapy is a form of radiation effective on certain types of so-called 
localized tumors -- those that have not yet spread throughout the body. It is 
made possible by the use of an accelerator, called a synchrotron, that 
accelerates the protons to reach the energy level proven effective against 
cancer cells. 
</P>
<P>
Because the energy of the beam can be precisely delivered to a tumor without 
seriously harming healthy surrounding tissues or vital organs, proton treatment 
is free of many of the side effects of conventional radiation. 
</P>
<P>
Proton therapy also allows doctors to supply a more potent dose of radiation. 
In conventional radiation therapy, the danger of inflicting excessive damage on 
adjacent organs or healthy cells often requires doctors to use a 
less-than-optimal dose, Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
Loma Linda's center, funded by private contributions and $19.6 million in 
grants from the U.S. Department of Energy, will initially treat patients with 
ocular tumors, like Carrillo. Slater said patients with head and neck cancers 
will be accepted in December and those with cancers below the shoulder may be 
treated early next year. 
</P>
<P>
By late 1991, the facility could be treating as many as 100 people a day, 
Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
Development of proton therapy has evolved over the past 45 years, and to date 
8,000 cancer patients worldwide have been treated. One Harvard University study 
showed that after at least two years of follow-up, 96.3% of 1,008 patients with 
melanoma of the eye had no further tumor growth, and 90% retained their eyes.

2 MEN KILLED, OFFICERS WOUNDED IN SHOOT-OUT AT SAN FRANCISCO BUILDING

A man shot and killed a lawyer Tuesday in a downtown office building and 
wounded two police officers, who then returned fire and killed the gunman, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was confronted by officers, who told him to drop the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
He returned fire -- he elected to do so for some unknown reason -- and the 
officers had no recourse but to return the fire," Police Chief Frank Jordan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings occurred on the third and sixth floors of the James Flood 
Building on Market Street about 1 p.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know the motive at this time," said Deputy Police Chief Frank Reed. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Garfield Steward, 75, of San Francisco, was fatally shot on the sixth 
floor. The others, all shot on the third floor, were taken to Mission Emergency 
Hospital, where the unidentified gunman died shortly before 2 p.m., Jordan 
said. Officer Jim Jean was struck in the face by bullet fragments and was 
expected to be released by today. Acting Lt. John Madden was shot in the left 
knee and will need surgery, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Kiersta Burke, who teaches Russian emigres at Jewish Vocational Services on the 
sixth floor, said she and her students were frightened by the gunfire and 
locked and then barricaded the door of their office. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very afraid that someone would break in and shoot us. We were thinking 
about climbing down the fire escape, but most of my students are elderly so I 
ruled that out," Burke said.

BROWN, ROBERTI DRAW FIRE OVER COMMERCIAL

Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp accused legislative leaders Willie Brown and 
David A. Roberti on Tuesday of "hiding behind Angela Lansbury's skirts" because 
a political ad that features the actress does not disclose Brown's and 
Roberti's backing. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said the ad opposing Propositions 131 and 140, the term-limit 
measures on the Nov. 6 ballot, appears to violate the state's 
Truth-in-Initiative law that requires campaign advertisements to identify their 
major financial backers. 
</P>
<P>
He said the ad only discloses that it is paid for by the "No on 131 and 140 
Campaign" and does not reveal that financial support for that campaign is being 
provided by incumbent legislators and political committees organized by 
Assembly Speaker Brown (D-San Francisco) Senate President Pro Tem Roberti 
(D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
"They should stop hiding behind Angela Lansbury's skirts and come out in the 
sunshine where people can see them," Van de Kamp said. "That television ad 
released by the opponents of Propositions 131 and 140 is both inaccurate and 
illegal. . . . In short it is just what people have come to expect from 
politicians in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said he understood that some broadcasters have already decided not 
to air the ad and threatened to seek "court relief and treble damages" against 
any stations that don't follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's comments were immediately denounced by representatives of the No 
on 131 and 140 Campaign and the California Assn. of Broadcasters, both of whom 
accused the attorney general of attempting to stifle free speech. 
</P>
<P>
Vic Biondi, the association's executive, said it is the broadcaster's role to 
inform the public and not to enforce disclosure laws. 
</P>
<P>
"They're using us to fight a campaign and to get the other side to do what they 
want, and we object to being dragged into this," said Biondi. "If there is a 
problem I think they should go after the source and not shoot the messenger." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 131, which Van de Kamp helped write, would limit legislators to 12 
consecutive years in each house and limit most statewide officials to eight 
years in office. It also would limit campaign contributions and enact a system 
for taxpayer financing of campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 140 would limit Assembly members to six years in office, and limit 
senators and statewide officials to eight years in office. It also would 
eliminate the Legislature's pension program and cut the Legislature's operating 
budget by about 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a loophole in state disclosure laws, Jay Ziegler, a spokesman for the No 
on 131 and 140 Campaign, said the ads against the two ballot measures do not 
have to contain full disclosure as along as they don't devote a majority of 
their content to one initiative. 
</P>
<P>
But Van de Kamp said his belief that the ad is illegal was based on an analysis 
that concluded that one initiative got more attention than the other, thus not 
qualifying for the exemption. He said most of the ad refers to Proposition 131 
and its provisions for public financing and only five words to Proposition 140. 
</P>
<P>
The No on 131 and 140 Campaign is the second big-moneyed group to take 
advantage of that loophole in the disclosure laws. Last week the alcoholic 
beverage industry used the loophole to avoid disclosing its backing of ads 
featuring actor Tony Randall. The ads oppose Proposition 134, which 
substantially increases taxes on beer, wine and liquor, and support Proposition 
126, which only modestly increases those taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in full compliance with all disclosure requirements of the law," said 
Ziegler. "We are very cautious and we requested an opinion from the Fair 
Political Practices Commission (the state's political watchdog agency) well in 
advance of our television advertising." 
</P>
<P>
He said television stations throughout the state appear to "have agreed with 
our interpretation." He said none have refused to run the ad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN 
</P>
<P>
The ballot measures: Propositions 131 and 140. Proposition 131 would limit the 
terms of state legislators and officers, limit campaign contributions and 
create a system for public financing of campaigns. Proposition 140 would limit 
terms, eliminate the Legislature's pension program and cut the Legislature's 
operating budget by about 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Whose ad: Yes on 131 -- The Clean Government Initiative. Cost: About $9,000 to 
produce. Supporters are seeking free air time on stations that run ads opposing 
Proposition 131. Producer: Zimmerman, Fiman &amp; Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
Elements of the ad with analysis by Times staff writer Daniel M. Weintraub: 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "Everyone knows why California needs a law to stop the politicians from 
turning public service into a lifetime career." As the announcer says this, 
pictures of convicted former lawmakers Joseph Montoya and Paul Carpenter flash 
on the screen along with a description of their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Neither Carpenter nor Montoya served long enough in any office to 
have been affected by Proposition 131's 12-year limit on terms. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "So who's against Prop 131? You guessed it, the most powerful career 
politicians." Pictures of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and 
Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra flash on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Brown has been in the Assembly since 1964 and has been Speaker since 
1980. He is credited with building a huge power base and is thought to be 
capable of winning passage in his house of any bill he favors and blocking 
passage of any bill he opposes. Johnson, in office since 1978, is considerably 
less powerful than Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "So who's for Prop 131? You and me and everybody who's fed up with politics 
as usual." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Supporters of Proposition 131 include California Common Cause, the 
Sierra Club, the National Organization for Women, Voter Revolt and consumer 
advocate Ralph Nader. 
</P>
<P>
Whose ad: Californians for a Citizen Government -- Yes on 140. Los Angeles 
County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, the chief sponsor of the initiative, 
addresses the camera. Cost: Less than $5,000 to produce. Sponsors are seeking 
free air time from stations that run ad opposing Proposition 140. Producer: TVC 
Productions. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "Seventy-two percent of Californians believe the Legislature is corrupt." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Percentage comes from a poll by Moore Information Services of 
Portland, Ore. A survey by The Los Angeles Times Poll late last year found that 
53% of voters thought "taking bribes is a relatively common practice" among 
Sacramento lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "140 limits their terms, ends their lavish pensions and cuts their huge 
staffs." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Besides term limits, the measure would eliminate the Legislature's 
pension program, which now allows lawmakers to retire at any age after 20 years 
of service and receive up to 67% of their highest salary. The Legislature's 
operating budget would drop from $219 million to $114 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "Proposition 140 doesn't use your tax dollars for their campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: This line is meant to draw a distinction between Proposition 140 and 
Proposition 131, which would limit terms and provide public financing of 
political campaigns. But it might lead some voters to believe that passage of 
Proposition 140 would stop tax dollars from going into campaigns, which isn't 
true. 
</P>
<P>
Whose Ad: No on 131 and 140, funded by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and Senate 
President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles). The ad features actress 
Angela Lansbury on the set of a television show. Cost: Unknown, although 
opponents of the two measures are expected to spend as much as $4 million to 
defeat them. Producer: Berman &amp; D'Agostino. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "These so-called reforms are written by politicians." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Proposition 131 was written by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp as part 
of his unsuccessful campaign for governor. Proposition 140 was written by Los 
Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, who has been in public office for 25 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "If 131 and 140 pass, special-interest groups and developers will amass 
even more power. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Opponents of term limits argue that the inexperienced legislators who 
would replace today's incumbents would be dependent on lobbyists for 
information about complex subjects. But advocates of term limits say the 
Legislature is already beholden to special interests. And they point out that 
special interests -- including labor unions, business groups and corporations 
-- are providing the lion's share of the funding for the anti-term-limits 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "Millions of your tax dollars go to politicians' campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Proposition 140 has nothing to do with financing campaigns. 
Proposition 131 would create a system under which $5 million a year would go 
from the state's general fund to match private campaign contributions and an 
estimated $12 million would be raised by taxpayers earmarking a portion of 
their taxes to a campaign finance fund.

ANC PROPOSES MANDELA TALK WITH BUTHELEZI

<P>
In a conciliatory move aimed at ending black factional fighting, the African 
National Congress has proposed a meeting between Nelson Mandela and rival black 
leader Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi. 
</P>
<P>
In its statement Monday, the ANC backed down from months of resistance to a 
Mandela-Buthelezi meeting. It did not say when the two should meet, only that 
such a meeting should take place in the "near future." 
</P>
<P>
Zulus loyal to Buthelezi's conservative Inkatha Freedom Party have been 
involved in bloody battles with ANC supporters since the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said he welcomes the invitation, which he said Inkatha had been 
pursuing "for some time now." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who is visiting Australia, said Tuesday he hopes the meeting will ease 
tensions. Violence between the ANC and Inkatha in black townships around 
Johannesburg has claimed about 800 lives since early August. 
</P>
<P>
"Future meetings are important," Mandela told a news conference in Canberra. 
"You create a new atmosphere, an atmosphere of hope. The meeting raises the 
hope of a peaceful resolution." 
</P>
<P>
Later Mandela became angry when an Australian radio station attempted to set up 
a surprise live telephone conversation between him and Buthelezi. Mandela was 
sitting in the studio after finishing an interview when Buthelezi was 
introduced via a telephone hookup. 
</P>
<P>
"In fairness, you should have told me," Mandela said before returning to his 
hotel. He did not speak to Buthelezi. 
</P>
<P>
If a meeting takes place, it would be the first between Mandela and Buthelezi 
since Mandela's release in February from 27 years in prison. The two were 
scheduled to meet earlier this year, but Mandela canceled under pressure from 
the ANC, which felt the talks would only enhance Buthelezi's stature. 
</P>
<P>
Both groups oppose apartheid, but Inkatha disagrees with ANC support of 
boycotts, strikes and other protests. Inkatha has also accused the ANC of 
trying to speak for all blacks in South Africa.

U.S. OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY CONCLUDE THAT PAKISTAN HAS A NUCLEAR BOMB; 
</P>
<P>
WEAPONS: THIS ASSESSMENT WAS BEHIND THE U.S. SUSPENSION OF AID.

<P>
After years of suspicion, U.S. officials have concluded that Pakistan has 
developed a nuclear explosive device, a knowledgeable source said Tuesday. The 
officials believe that the bomb was completed last spring at the height of 
increased tension with India over long-disputed Kashmir, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
The determination was based partially on satellite photographs of the closely 
guarded Kahuta uranium enrichment facility about 12 miles from Islamabad, as 
well as on reports of covert attempts to buy sophisticated high-temperature 
furnaces and other critical elements through intermediaries in the United 
States and Europe, other sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. assessment, which Pakistan officially rejects, was behind Washington's 
unexpected suspension of $564 million in new economic and military aid to 
Pakistan earlier this month. The freeze also affects $2.7 billion in previously 
authorized military aid and sales, including the delivery next year of 71 F-16 
fighter jets. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials concede that the aid freeze vastly complicates U.S. relations 
with its third-largest aid recipient and closest ally in South Asia. It also 
has become an emotional political issue in national elections being held across 
the country today. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Benazir Bhutto, who was ousted as prime minister Aug. 6, 
appears likely to capture strong support despite a seventh corruption charge 
filed against her Tuesday by the caretaker government. 
</P>
<P>
Public opinion polls show that most Pakistanis strongly support the country's 
nuclear program to maintain a balance of power with India, its neighbor and 
longtime enemy. Pakistan began its program after India exploded a nuclear 
device in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
"It is seen as vital to the security of Pakistan," said Mushahid Hussain, a 
lecturer at Pakistan's National Defense College and the military Command and 
Staff College. "The West does not have a lethal enemy breathing down its neck, 
as we do." 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen a single anti-nuclear editorial," agreed Najam Sethi, editor of 
the Friday Times, an independent weekly in Lahore. "You would be ruined, wiped 
out, run out of town, if you said we don't need the bomb." 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has never tested a nuclear bomb and denies having one. But it refuses 
to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty or allow international experts to 
inspect suspected facilities until India agrees to the same conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The aid freeze was triggered when President Bush could not certify to Congress 
that Pakistan "does not possess a nuclear explosive device," as required in a 
1985 law. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe it's gone past that line," the knowledgeable source said, adding, 
"There's a certain amount of subjectivity in there." 
</P>
<P>
Despite White House warnings in 1988 and 1989, assurances from Islamabad that 
the program was stopped "no longer held up" early this year, the source said. 
"There was new information on new activities that had taken place this year," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's deputy national security adviser, Robert M. Gates, expressed concern 
about the work when he met with Pakistan President Ghulam Ishaq Khan in 
Islamabad on May 21 to discuss the threat of war with India over Kashmir, 
according to Hussain. 
</P>
<P>
Hussain said Gates complained that Pakistan was preparing weapons-grade uranium 
at Kahuta, in violation of a 1984 pledge. "The U.S. feels that commitment was 
not kept," he said. "So they want to open Kahuta for inspection." 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has fought three wars with India, two over the status of Kashmir. Both 
countries claim the divided Himalayan state, while hundreds have died this year 
as India has tried to crush a violent pro-independence movement in its only 
Muslim state. 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. officials privately admit they conveniently ignored Pakistan's 
nuclear development in the 1980s, when the country was used to supply American 
weapons to anti-Soviet guerrillas fighting in neighboring Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Many Pakistanis say the United States also overlooked widespread human rights 
violations, an explosion in drug trafficking and 11 years of brutal martial law 
under Bhutto's predecessor, Gen. Zia ul-Haq. 
</P>
<P>
"They find America's sudden focus on democracy rather amusing," one Western 
diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The ambivalence is one reason the aid freeze has aroused strong nationalist 
passions in a bitter election campaign. Both Bhutto and her opponents have 
tried to tap into resentment against the United States, accusing each other of 
undermining the nation's popular nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Democratic Alliance, for example, has denounced Bhutto as a 
"traitor" and accused her and her mother of lobbying Washington to cut aid on 
India's behalf in a "Zionist-Hindu conspiracy." 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto, in turn, has insisted that her government repeatedly resisted U.S. 
pressure to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty but that her opponents 
were prepared to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"We prefer to lay down our lives for the vital nuclear program instead of 
compromising on it," she told a packed rally in Rawalpindi last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The knowledgeable source said the U.S. freeze would be reviewed after a new 
government is elected. For now, it has caused "a tremendous amount of antipathy 
and hostility, which is going to make U.S.-Pakistan relations more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
The freeze comes at a difficult time for Pakistan. Already burdened by heavy 
debts and debt servicing, the impoverished nation stands to lose $2 billion 
from the Persian Gulf crisis, according to government officials. The loss comes 
from a surge in oil prices, a sharp fall in exports and lost currency 
remittances from Pakistani workers who have fled Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
But few Pakistanis appear sympathetic to calls for nuclear non-proliferation. A 
group of men who gathered to sip tea in a crowded Lahore bazaar several nights 
ago had nothing but scorn for the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should America tell us what to do?" demanded Mohammad Saleem, a 
26-year-old office clerk. "We are not a colony of America. Why does George Bush 
want to be the viceroy of Pakistan?"

China's guardians of Marxist ideology on Tuesday announced a new campaign 
against pornography and Western liberalism and said they will press on with an 
anti-crime drive in which hundreds have been executed. 
</P>
<P>
The announcements in the party newspaper People's Daily indicated that the 
hard-liners who have dominated Chinese politics since June, 1989, have no 
intention of relaxing their hold. 
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhongde, who headed an anti-pornography drive last year, said a new 
campaign will clean up the remaining "spiritual pollution and cultural 
garbage." In last year's drive, pro-democratic publications as well as 
pornography were seized and burned. 
</P>
<P>
Liu said that 12% of the country's newspapers, 13% of its social science 
periodicals and more than 7% of its publishing houses have been closed since 
June, 1989. He said that 32 million books and magazines have been destroyed and 
nearly 80,000 people convicted of illegal publishing. 
</P>
<P>
"This is still just a good beginning," he said.

BUSH OKS BIGGER U.N. MILITARY ROLE; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: A MEETING OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL'S DEFENSE ARM IS PLANNED. IT 
WOULD COORDINATE ANTI-IRAQ MOVES AND ACCOMMODATE THE SOVIETS.

<P>
Despite strong opposition to putting U.S. troops under foreign commanders, the 
Bush Administration has agreed to a high-level meeting of the military arm of 
the U.N. Security Council in a step that will broaden the U.N. umbrella for any 
military action against Iraq, Administration and diplomatic sources said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
An Administration official confirmed that representatives of the five permanent 
members of the Security Council are planning to meet soon at "a three-star 
level, a lieutenant-general level," giving the long-moribund U.N. Military 
Staff Committee greater authority than it has had for the last four decades. 
</P>
<P>
The move to upgrade the U.N. military arm is intended to help overcome the many 
problems of coordination that have arisen as multinational forces have gathered 
in the Persian Gulf. The problems prompted a visit to Saudi Arabia this week by 
Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
The move also is aimed at accommodating the Soviet Union, which began pressing 
even before the gulf crisis to have the U.N. Military Staff Committee given new 
power. Last month, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze proposed that 
the United Nations set up a rapid-response force made up of military units from 
several countries to handle future emergencies like Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pentagon is concerned about any subordination of U.S. forces to anyone 
else or about putting U.S. forces in a position where the chain of command is a 
complicated one and you can't make decisions easily," one U.S. official said 
this week. "But there is an understanding on the Pentagon's part, as well, that 
we've got multinational forces there (in the Persian Gulf), and there's a need 
for a certain umbrella for them." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials emphasized that the bolstering of the Military Staff Committee 
will not amount to setting up a formal U.N. military command. Rather, it will 
be "a vehicle for coordination," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
A European diplomat suggested that the Military Staff Committee could provide a 
vehicle that would ease the concerns of countries such as France about having 
their troops in Saudi Arabia put under American direction. 
</P>
<P>
"It's for sure that the Americans will play the most important role" in the 
U.N. effort at military coordination, this diplomat said Tuesday. "But we can't 
say that. We have to find a way to explain things that will not look like a new 
American hegemonism in the world. You know the French sensitivities about 
having French troops under U.S. command. There has to be a solution that is 
acceptable to the French public." 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Military Staff Committee is made up of military officers from the 
United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China. 
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Charter, the committee was supposed to direct any military 
forces established by the Security Council. But during the Cold War years, the 
Security Council was too divided to agree on any tasks for its military arm, 
which conducted only brief meetings involving low-level officers such as majors 
or colonels. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev suggested that the Military 
Staff Committee be empowered to take on new tasks such as directing U.N. 
peacekeeping forces. During the early weeks of the gulf crisis, in a gesture to 
the Soviet Union, the committee was given a slightly expanded role when its 
senior officers were allowed to meet three times, but only in the presence of 
their ambassadors. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Soviet officials have kept pressing to give the U.N. military arm a 
larger role. "We must put life into the Military Staff Committee," Soviet 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said last month. Two weeks ago, 
Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir F. Petrovsky proposed that the 
committee convene at the level of the military chiefs of staff. 
</P>
<P>
"The results of this effort to rely on the Military Staff Committee could be 
very important, not only for the Iraq crisis but for the next 20 years," the 
European diplomat said. "This is very important for the future, for other 
regional conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
American commanders in Saudi Arabia remain deeply concerned about an unorthodox 
chain of command that, in case of war, would leave the United States with no 
direct control over most of the two dozen armies in the area. Those forces 
instead would report directly to a Saudi regional commander. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, in a meeting with Prince Sultan ibn Abdulaziz, the Saudi defense 
chief, Powell was understood to have sought more streamlined arrangements that 
would give the United States clear authority over the forces operating in 
support of U.S. military operations. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking with reporters in Riyadh before the meeting, his first with Saudi 
officials since the crisis began, Powell said he expected to discuss "the 
status of our buildup" and to make "a general review of all of our plans." 
</P>
<P>
Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, U.S. commander in the region, and his Saudi 
counterpart, Prince Khalid ibn Sultan ibn Abdulaziz, are effectively equals, 
with major decisions theoretically made in tandem. British forces report 
directly to the United States while those of every other nation except France 
answer to the Saudis. 
</P>
<P>
With Muslim units positioned on the front lines immediately ahead of the 
heavier U.S. forces, the lack of coordination has caused concern among American 
commanders about possible mix-ups in case of combat. As a result, the United 
States has sought to conduct joint exercises with forces in adjoining 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
But progress has been slow. After announcing the first U.S.-Saudi ground-force 
training operation last Thursday, American military officials abruptly canceled 
a trip for members of the press to follow-up exercises over the weekend, 
initially saying that the exercises had been postponed. 
</P>
<P>
A military spokesman offered a new explanation Tuesday night, saying that the 
operation, which involved units firing 81-millimeter mortars, had gone so well 
that neither the United States nor Saudi Arabia saw any reason to repeat it. 
There is no indication, however, that other units have yet begun similar joint 
training. 
</P>
<P>
Tensions also linger between the Americans and Saudis, on the one hand, and the 
French, on the other, over Gallic insistence that French forces answer to no 
one but Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from the Saudi government, French Foreign Legionnaires who had 
arrayed themselves close to the Iraqi border near the town of Hafir al Batin 
began Tuesday to withdraw to positions behind Syrian and Egyptian forces, 
according to Western diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
The "tactical realignment" came after the Saudi government expressed pique over 
the unauthorized presence of non-Muslim forces along the front lines, the 
diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Maurice Schmitt, chief of staff of the French armed forces, met with top 
American commanders in Washington on Sunday in an effort to sort out some of 
the differences and will host Powell on a visit to Paris later this week. 
</P>
<P>
Powell, who is making his first trip to Saudi Arabia since Sept. 9, spent more 
than eight hours meeting with Schwarzkopf and his senior staff Monday night and 
Tuesday, reviewing what the chairman of the joint chiefs described as "a very 
complex military buildup." 
</P>
<P>
"You sit and go over all the details of our dispositions here, our defensive 
plans here, and obviously we examined every possible contingency with which we 
might be faced," Powell told a small pool of reporters.

Solidarity leader Lech Walesa upstaged his presidential rival Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki on Tuesday by presenting half a million signatures backing his 
candidacy for next month's Polish elections. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa's campaign chief said he presented the national election commission in 
Warsaw with sacks of signatures -- at least 500,000 names and five times the 
number required to register as a candidate. Prime Minister Mazowiecki 
registered last Wednesday with about 140,000 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
The number has only symbolic importance, but Walesa deliberately waited a week 
longer to register in order to upstage his rival.

HOUSE PASSES FARM POLICY BILL THAT COULD CUT SUBSIDIES 25%

<P>
The House on Tuesday passed legislation that could lead to a 25% cut in farm 
programs but would try to make up for it by giving farmers more freedom to look 
for money-making crops. 
</P>
<P>
The farm policy bill, which now goes to the Senate, also requires steps to 
protect water supplies from becoming contaminated with farming chemicals and 
establishes the first federal rules as to what foods may be sold as organic. 
</P>
<P>
The bill sets terms for farm subsidies, export promotion, research and public 
feeding programs for the next five years. It was approved on a 318-102 vote. 
</P>
<P>
The farm bill's authors reluctantly embraced the so-called triple base plan in 
order to meet budget guidelines. Under triple base, 15% of the nation's wheat, 
feed grain, cotton and rice land would be ineligible for subsidies, but farmers 
would be allowed to raise other crops on that land. 
</P>
<P>
Triple base is the centerpiece of a $13.6-billion reduction of farm program 
costs. As a precaution, the House and Senate agriculture committees made the 
cuts contingent on passage of an overall bill to narrow the federal deficit by 
$500 billion. 
</P>
<P>
If the overall budget bill is passed, farm subsidy funds will fall by 25%, to 
$40.8 billion. If the budget bill fails, farm spending would revert to about 
$54 billion, and there would be no triple base or other spending cuts.

SENATOR PLACED GROWING ASSETS INTO BLIND TRUST RUN BY BEST FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Pete Wilson announced his mayoral candidacy in San Diego nearly two 
decades ago, he made a point of disclosing all of his belongings. 
</P>
<P>
"I own an equity in my home, some books and some furniture. . . . I have a bank 
loan of $3,400. That's it," Wilson said during a speech. "Neither Betty nor I 
own any other real property, business or interest in any company located in or 
doing business with the city." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his political career, Wilson often has boasted about his 
extraordinary efforts to steer clear of any appearance of a conflict of 
interest. This led him in December, 1986, to put his assets -- which have grown 
considerably since he first ran for mayor -- into a blind trust, making him one 
of 21 senators to entrust his investments to an independent administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he did not have the need to establish a blind trust while he was 
mayor. He decided to take this step shortly after he abstained from a Senate 
vote affecting the beer industry because his second wife held extensive stocks 
in Anheuser-Busch Inc. 
</P>
<P>
To administer the trust, Wilson selected his best friend and former law partner 
from San Diego, John Davies. A former Wilson political appointee, Davies had 
arranged for two wealthy friends to provide rent-free apartments to the former 
San Diego mayor in the early 1980s when Wilson's marriage to his first wife, 
Betty, was ending. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of a blind trust is to allow an independent third party to handle a 
public official's assets without informing that official of the investment 
portfolio. That way, potential conflicts are avoided. The investments are also 
shielded from public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
A public official who appoints his best friend as administrator has created "a 
visually impaired trust," said Lawrence J. Ross, a Washington tax lawyer and 
former chief counsel of a House Ways &amp; Means subcommittee who is familiar 
with blind trusts. "It doesn't seem like it fulfills its function if the 
politician can't say that the trustee is truly independent. It's not a legal 
question. It just doesn't look right." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he sees no problem having the trust administered by his best 
friend. He insisted that Davies would not jeopardize his career as a lawyer by 
discussing financial details with the senator. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, he's my dear friend. On the other hand, he's not a goddamned fool," 
Wilson said. "I wouldn't ask him to do anything like that. He wouldn't do it if 
I did." 
</P>
<P>
Before he married his second wife, Gayle, Wilson had accumulated few private 
investments and little wealth, according to his tax returns and financial 
disclosure statements. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1977 and 1981, his annual income fluctuated from $46,860 to $102,284 to 
$45,404, largely the result of his first wife's commissions as a real estate 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
The only significant investment made by Wilson and his first wife was the 1980 
purchase of a share in a firm trying to convert cow dung into methane gas. The 
$10,000 investment helped the Wilsons avoid paying any federal income tax in 
1980 despite earning $71,342. Wilson did not claim any deductions further after 
the tax shelter became an issue in his 1982 Senate race. He paid back taxes 
when the deduction was disallowed, said campaign director Otto Bos. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of Wilson's current wealth -- estimated at about $850,000 -- comes 
from his second wife. The value of the blind trust in March was reported at 
$295,302. In addition to his $101,400 salary, Wilson has collected about 
$200,000 in speaking fees since he was elected to the Senate in 1982 -- a 
controversial source of income because the money often comes from special 
interest groups and goes directly into the recipients' pockets. Like many 
members of Congress, Wilson has given a portion of his honorariums to 
charities. 
</P>
<P>
Among the companies that have paid Wilson $2,000 speaking fees -- the maximum 
allowed under federal law -- are the National Assn. of Homebuilders, 
Construction Industry Advancement Fund, American Railroads Assn., Securities 
Industry Assn., California Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. and Coast Savings 
&amp; Loan Assn.

WILSON RETURNED $7,400 FROM LEVERAGE FIRM HE AIDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the waning days of the 1986 congressional session, Pete Wilson stood on the 
Senate floor and vowed to "use whatever parliamentary procedures are available" 
to block a bill that would have effectively closed several precious metals 
dealers, including a controversial Newport Beach investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Wilson won the fight. Monex International, despite concerns of 
federal regulators and losses by thousands of investors, remains in business. 
</P>
<P>
When questions were raised late last year about Wilson's actions, he decided to 
return $6,000 in contributions from Monex and $1,400 the company spent on a 
weekend jaunt for Wilson and his wife near Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"That money is going back," Wilson told The Times last December when questioned 
about the contribution. "I'm concerned about appearances." 
</P>
<P>
Monex engages in leverage trading -- the buying and selling of precious metals 
contracts with little money down. The process is similar to the trading of 
commodities futures contracts, except that leverage contracts are not traded on 
an exchange, generally are of longer duration and involve smaller amounts of 
precious metals. 
</P>
<P>
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission estimates that thousands of customers 
of four firms, including Monex, lost more than $100 million through leverage 
trades between 1986 and the third quarter of 1989, according to documents 
obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Bruggeman, an Illinois tractor dealer, said he lost nearly $50,000 in 
Monex investments. "I remember coming home at night and I had just lost 20 
grand," he said. "That was a shocker." 
</P>
<P>
Monex, which has faced some regulatory actions over the years, says its 
customers by and large are satisfied. The company, with annual sales of $610 
million and 250 employees, reports handling more than $10 billion in 
investments for more than 100,000 customers. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, Congress placed a moratorium on new firms entering the 
business because members believed it was too susceptible to fraud, but that 
action did not apply to Monex. By 1986, some legislators thought the remaining 
leverage firms, including Monex, should be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
The fight that followed boiled down to two choices -- banning the industry 
altogether or lifting the moratorium imposed in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of groups and individuals lined up against leverage trading, including 
Consumers Union, three commodity exchanges and even the commodity commission. 
</P>
<P>
Those in favor of expanding leverage included the White House, the Justice 
Department and Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he thought leverage trading should be expanded rather than 
outlawed, believing competition will bring down commissions and fees and force 
companies to do any necessary housekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
On the Senate floor, he threatened to filibuster an important commodities 
regulation bill if a provision to outlaw leverage trading was included. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to bat for them," said Wilson. "If you're asking me to say it's not 
risky you're wasting your time. . . . I wouldn't urge anyone to go into it. 
There are disreputable used car salesman. Should we ban the sale of used cars?" 
</P>
<P>
At first, the House of Representatives voted to require that leverage contracts 
be traded on an exchange. Later, the House reversed itself and voted to lift 
the ban. The Senate went along with the House's final decision largely because 
of the efforts of Wilson, according to numerous members of Congress and 
lobbyists familiar with the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Following his victory, Wilson was approached in a Senate corridor by the very 
grateful owner of Monex, Louis E. Carabini. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he told Carabini he could not accept any donations because of how 
it would look. The men had met two or three times before to discuss the 
impending legislation, Carabini said. 
</P>
<P>
But nearly two years later, Carabini and his wife were invited to a Wilson 
fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
"I inquired through his staff in Washington whether he would still prefer that 
we not financially support his reelection efforts," Carabini said. "I received 
an answer (from Wilson's campaign staff). . . that our support would be 
welcome." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the green light given to Carabini to begin contributing was a staff 
oversight and that he first learned of the donations when he was contacted by 
The Times. "The senator's first reaction was 'What the hell happened?' " said 
Bill Livingstone, campaign press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the $6,000 in contributions, Monex paid $1,426 in air fare and lodging 
for Wilson and his wife, Gayle, to spend a weekend in 1987 at the Boca Raton 
Resort and Club. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he was unaware Monex was paying for the trip, which he reported was 
given so he could attend the annual meeting of the Futures Industry Assn. 
Wilson later said he was really there to visit his father. 
</P>
<P>
After he returned the contributions -- the majority in 1989 and the remainder 
earlier this year -- Wilson wrote a letter to The Times in which he expressed 
concerns over how the Monex incident might be portrayed. 
</P>
<P>
"A story alleging that leverage contract trading is inherently too risky to 
allow and that Congress allows this type of trading because of campaign 
contributions . . . would be factually incorrect, irresponsible and 
defamatory," Wilson wrote.

5.7 QUAKE FELT OVER WIDE AREA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A strong earthquake centered in the Owens Valley shook a large area of Northern 
California from Fresno to the San Francisco Bay Area late Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The 11:15 p.m. temblor was rated at magnitude 5.7 on the Richter Scale by the 
U. S. Geological Survey at Menlo Park and its epicenter was 16 miles east of 
Bridgeport and 5 miles north of Lee Vining in a remote section of Mono County. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had no reports of damage yet," said Tom Flynn of the state Office of 
Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
The Times received calls from Fresno about the quake and news agencies and 
emergency agencies in San Francisco and Sacramento areas were flooded with 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of the temblor came in from Manteca, San Francisco, Sacramento and 
Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Hodges, editor of the Manteca Bulletin, said the newspaper received six 
calls within minutes after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a rolling, strong jolt and lasted about 25 seconds," said Manteca 
resident Robin Bergmann. 
</P>
<P>
Gamblers at Lake Tahoe reported being shaken out of their chairs but no damage 
was reported at the casinos there or in Reno. 
</P>
<P>
Only two rock slides were reported in Mono County center of the quake and there 
were no injuries said Sheriff's Deputy Suzanne Sturdivant. 
</P>
<P>
"We had lots of calls," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake according to ground motion 
as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one digit represents a tenfold 
increase of magnitude.

MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR CANDIDATES RUN AS OUTSIDERS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE RACE REFLECTS THE PUBLIC'S DESIRE FOR CHANGE AFTER LARGE TAX 
INCREASES AND SERVICE CUTS UNDER DUKAKIS. THE VOTERS 'ARE JUST FED UP.'

<P>
If Gov. Michael S. Dukakis is the fading sun of Massachusetts politics, John R. 
Silber and William F. Weld, the men vying to replace him, are competing to be 
Pluto, as distant a point from him as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Silber, 64, a philosopher on leave as president of Boston University, 
and Republican Weld, 45, a former U.S. attorney and Justice Department 
official, won their parties' gubernatorial nominations over favored political 
veterans last month by projecting themselves as outsiders untainted by the 
fiscal chaos on Beacon Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Now, both are maintaining that pose into the final two weeks of the still 
unfocused general election. In their animated first debate last week, each 
pointedly tried to link the other to Dukakis, whose personal approval rating 
has slipped to near single digits -- the kind of numbers Marie Antoinette might 
have posted on her way to the guillotine. 
</P>
<P>
Their strategies reflect the barbed emotions dominating politics here. With the 
state reeling from large tax increases and service cuts, "people are just fed 
up and want to change," Democratic pollster Brad Bannon said. 
</P>
<P>
A Boston Globe/WBZ-TV poll released Tuesday showed Silber ahead of Weld, 41% to 
35%. But the poll results have been volatile, and both sides are bracing for a 
turbulent and unpredictable finish. 
</P>
<P>
Anything else in a race involving Silber would be a shock. Throughout the 
campaign, he has riveted attention with his incongruously cerebral, mad-as-hell 
style and his penchant for offending predominantly Democratic groups -- from 
blacks to Jews to the elderly -- with acerbic, scolding remarks dubbed "Silber 
shockers." 
</P>
<P>
Many Massachusetts activists believe that a victory next month would instantly 
establish Silber as a leader in the Democratic Party's conservative wing -- and 
even as a possible future presidential candidate. Conservatives are attracted 
to his tough approach to foreign affairs, support for a constitutional 
amendment limiting the terms of state legislators and stress on personal 
responsibility in domestic policy. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has since softened his comments, he proposed earlier this year that 
a welfare recipient who has a second illegitimate child face loss of her 
benefits -- and the prospect that, "if she cannot care for her child, her 
children will be taken away from her . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But Silber's cultural conservatism is tempered by economic proposals that 
liberals welcome: a massive educational day-care program for all needy children 
beginning at age 3; a 12-cent hike in the state gas tax to fund infrastructure 
improvements; a state program to guarantee that all qualified high school 
graduates can "attend college without cost" if they lack the funds to pay for 
it, and a state industrial planning agency modeled on Japan's Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
Although Silber says he backs a woman's right to obtain an abortion, he has 
called abortion "homicide" and supports legislation that would require any 
married woman to obtain her husband's written approval before receiving one. 
</P>
<P>
For those reasons, the state's largest abortion rights group, Mass Choice, last 
Friday endorsed Weld, who supports access to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
But Weld's ability to attract liberals disenchanted with Silber is constrained 
by his opposition to gun control and his support for Question 3, a 
controversial ballot initiative that would slash state taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Silber has resolutely opposed the proposal and slammed Weld as irresponsible 
for supporting it. That message seems to be getting through. The new Globe poll 
found Question 3 favored by only 28% of those surveyed, with 59% opposed. Weld 
may have hitched his hopes to a fading star. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very impressed by Weld until he said he was in favor of Question 3," 
said Dorothy Amato, a retired schoolteacher, after meeting Weld at a church 
bazaar in Pittsfield on Saturday. "I'm a realist. If you're going to pay bills, 
you've got to have money." 
</P>
<P>
Although it shows signs of becoming the race's dominant issue, the dispute over 
Question 3 is a rare ideological intrusion into a contest that so far has 
drifted down other tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Silber has stressed his experience as an administrator at Boston University and 
derided Weld as a "lawyer and a bureaucrat" -- thus linking him to the 
political careerists blamed for the state's problems. During the debate, he 
poked at Weld, the product of a prosperous family, as the candidate of 
"inherited wealth." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Weld has strenuously sought to tie Silber to the mast of the 
state Democratic Establishment, constantly reminding audiences that Silber 
received primary endorsements from state Senate President William M. Bulger and 
other party insiders. 
</P>
<P>
"Silber says he represents 'throw the bums out,' but he's not going to be able 
to do it because they are his bums," Weld said in an interview Saturday while 
campaigning through Berkshire County. 
</P>
<P>
Even these comparisons may ultimately prove less important than the most 
personal ones. Silber is such a volcanic personality that many observers here 
believe the race could finally turn on whether voters are angry enough to 
accept so polarizing a figure. 
</P>
<P>
Weld has been the more bare-knuckled campaigner -- he has aggressively 
criticized Silber's record at Boston University, questioned his personal 
finances and aired several negative ads -- but the Republican's personal style 
is much gentler than his opponent's. 
</P>
<P>
"With Weld, there is the promise of change, and yet he seems to be sensible, 
calm and reasoned," Republican consultant Todd Domke maintained. "Whereas 
Silber . . . is somewhat unsettling." 
</P>
<P>
But that tendency to unsettle is also Silber's strength, for, in this autumn of 
discontent, Massachusetts voters may be looking for the candidate who can most 
disrupt the habits of state government. In a year when voters everywhere are 
roiling with anger at politicians, this race will measure the boundaries of 
outrage.

PHOENIX SHUTS OUT THE GULLS, 7-0

<P>
Indirectly, San Diego can blame Los Angeles for its latest bruise, as Phoenix 
defeated the Gulls, 7-0, in an International Hockey League game Tuesday night 
before 3,743 at the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, the Raiders beat up on the Chargers, Monday a thick blanket of smog 
drifted south from the L.A. basin, and Tuesday, Phoenix, a team almost solely 
supplied by the Kings, handed the Gulls their worst loss and second shutout of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
"What can I say, it was just one of those nights," said goaltender Mark Reimer, 
who allowed four goals before he was pulled with four minutes remaining in the 
second period. 
</P>
<P>
Gulls' Coach Mike O'Connell found nothing to cheer about Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"They score seven goals on us, that's embarrassing," he said. "They got some 
soft goals on us, that hurt. But we're focusing on the puck too much and not 
the man." 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix (3-3-1) scored three goals in the second and third periods, and for the 
eighth time this season, the Gulls (2-5-1) outshot their opponents, this time 
30-24. 
</P>
<P>
Even the first San Diego appearance of 12-year NHL veteran goalie Glen Hanlon, 
acquired last week from Detroit, failed to help the Gulls. 
</P>
<P>
Goalie Mark Reimer started the game with a 2-1-1 record, but was pulled after 
Phoenix scored once in the first period and three times in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Leading 4-0, Steve Graves, Sean Whyte and Brian Lawton scored the last three 
goals of the night, all off Hanlon, to give Phoenix a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After giving up two goals, which put the Gulls behind, 2-0, the next two, both 
in the second period, seemed to catch Reimer off guard.

At 9:52 in the second, Lawton scored from the right circle to put Phoenix 
ahead, 3-0. The puck took a slow roll and bowled over Reimer, who ended up 
sprawled on his back trying to make the save. 
</P>
<P>
Graves became Reimer's next nightmare, never stopping his skating stride as he 
backhanded a shot from the slot. Reimer appeared to have made the save with his 
right hand, but he lost his grip on it and the puck sank into the net for a 4-0 
Phoenix lead.

Gulls Notes 
</P>
<P>
On the road again: The Arizona State Fair will keep Phoenix out of the Arizona 
Veterans Coliseum until Nov. 1, when it will play its first home game against 
Muskegon (Mich.). "I'm reasonably satisfied with our start," Phoenix General 
Manager Adam Keller said of his team, which has played nine games on the road. 
"It's a long trip and the guys are a bit weary, but as long as we can come out 
with a couple of points . . . " Keller was a defenseman and captain of the old 
Roadrunners, when Phoenix and the original Gulls were Western Professional 
Hockey League archrivals. He recalled there was never a problem getting 
mentally ready to play San Diego. . . . It was old home week for Keller, 
Phoenix owner Lyle Abraham, and six of the Gulls -- Jim McGeough, Carl Mokosak, 
Brent Sapergia, Larry Floyd, Robbie Nichols and Dave Korol -- who played for 
the Roadrunners last year. "You should be very grateful to us," Keller said. . 
. . Charlie Simmer, Gulls' assistant coach and left wing, is still nursing an 
injured ankle. Center Darcy Norton injured an ankle Friday against Indianapolis 
and is listed as probable for Thursday's game. . . . Left wing Steve Martinson, 
who played in 48 NHL games for Detroit and Montreal from 1987 to 1988, and 
defenseman Derek Mayer, from Detroit's top farm team, were added to the Gulls' 
roster Tuesday. Right wing Paul Kelly and left wing Jacques Mailhot were 
released.

QUAKE-CAUSED ROCKSLIDES SHUT YOSEMITE ROADS

<P>
Huge boulders knocked loose by an earthquake blocked one road into Yosemite 
National Park today, and two of the three other highways leading into the park 
were also closed by rockslides. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported from the quake, which was felt Tuesday night from San 
Francisco to Nevada and shook up casinos and hotels in South Lake Tahoe and 
Reno. It registered a preliminary magnitude of 5.8, according to the U.S. 
Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
Six-foot-high boulders forced the closure of Highway 120 on the west side of 
the park. A three-foot section of the highway was gone, and a retaining wall 
was lost. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a big pile of small rocks, it's a small pile of big rocks," U.S. Park 
Service Ranger Kelly McClaskey said. 
</P>
<P>
A rockslide half a mile away closed Highway 140 into the park, but that was 
expected to be cleaned up today, Ranger Scot Bowen said. State highway crews 
were also clearing away a slide on Highway 120 on the east side of the park. A 
road from the south was unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
The quake's center was in Lee Vining, a town of 400 people northeast of 
Yosemite National Park in the Sierra Nevada and about 190 miles southeast of 
San Francisco, said Pat Jorgenson, spokeswoman for the U.S. Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a rolling, strong jolt and lasted about 25 seconds," said Robin 
Bergmann, a resident of Manteca, about 120 miles from Lee Vining. 
</P>
<P>
"We had lots of calls but no reports of injury," said Mono County Sheriff's 
Deputy Suzanne Sturdivant, who said the quake lasted about 45 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Elaine West, a telephone operator at Caesar's in South Lake Tahoe, said the 
quake left "a lot of frightened guests" at the hotel and casino. 
</P>
<P>
"In the gift shop, things started clinking around, and that's how the girls in 
the gift shop knew about it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Syrena Styff, an employee at Harrah's in Reno, said guests reported feeling 
dizzy but did not immediately realize a quake had struck.

SENATE BARELY UPHOLDS BUSH VETO OF RIGHTS BILL

<P>
The Senate today upheld by a single vote President Bush's veto of the major 
civil rights legislation of 1990, and supporters of the bill vowed to return 
next year with an even stronger anti-discrimination measure. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted 66 to 34 -- one vote short of the necessary two-thirds 
majority -- to sustain Bush's rejection of the bill. The President has vetoed 
16 bills, and Congress has failed to override any of them. 
</P>
<P>
All 55 Democrats and 11 Republicans voted to override the veto. Thirty-four 
Republicans voted to sustain. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) said the Administration and the bill's backers are 
still "very, very close" to agreeing on a substitute measure, and Senate 
Republican leader Bob Dole promised a White House Rose Garden signing ceremony 
this week if Congress adopts the Administration alternative. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said the issue is dead for the year and 
predicted that Congress next year will pass a "stronger bill" and will have the 
votes to override a veto by Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if something could be worked out on the Administration alternative bill, 
Kennedy said, "You can't compromise on discrimination, and that's what the 
President was trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
The debate prompted a scathing personal denunciation of Bush by Kennedy, who 
accused the President of taking "the low road on civil rights." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said the veto "contravenes the basic principles for which George Bush 
has stood" during his long career, adding, however, "When the chips are down, 
President Bush -- like candidate Bush -- is willing to divide the nation for 
narrow or partisan advantage." 
</P>
<P>
President Arthur Kropp of People for the American Way, which pushes civil 
rights, said the bill was the "casualty of an unrelenting White House smear 
campaign," but Kirk Fordice of the Associated General Contractors of America, 
said, "I fervently hope that today's action will be the first of many to rid 
our society of other quota-inducing laws and regulations." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, approved by overwhelming majorities in the Senate and House, 
would have overturned a series of Supreme Court decisions that have made it 
more difficult for women and minorities to prove discrimination in hiring, 
promotions and job-related activities.

RTD LAUDS FREE-RIDE PROGRAM

<P>
The Los Angeles Rapid Transit District's free-ride pilot program to patrons 
whose buses are at least 15 minutes late was a "phenomenal" success in its 
first month, with ridership increasing by about 1 million over the same period 
last year, officials announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Of the nearly 34 million passengers who rode RTD buses in September, about 
59,000 -- or 0.18% of the total -- qualified for free rides under the agency's 
warranty program, far less than the 600,000 officials had predicted. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a phenomenal RTD success story," board President Nick Patsaouras said 
at a downtown news conference, adding that he will recommend that the program 
be permanently implemented beyond its scheduled December expiration if the 
success continues.

Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole today became the first member of 
President Bush's Cabinet to resign, saying she wanted to turn her attention to 
humanitarian concerns by heading the American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
"It is with real deep regret that I accept this resignation, but let me hasten 
to say I understand her desire to continue her public service as president of 
the American Red Cross," Bush told reporters at the White House as Dole stood 
at his side. 
</P>
<P>
Dole, 54, plans to leave her post at the end of November to begin work at the 
Red Cross in January, Labor Department spokeswoman Dale Tate said. Her first 
project there will involve disaster relief. 
</P>
<P>
A North Carolina native married to Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas 
-- who unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination against 
Bush in 1988 -- she dismissed speculation that she may seek the Republican 
nomination for North Carolina governor in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm on my way to the Red Cross," Dole told reporters. "I have no plans to run 
for anything." 
</P>
<P>
She has served in government for the last 25 years, holding jobs in every 
presidential Administration since that of Lyndon B. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
She said she was leaving government because she "felt a calling to join" an 
organization performing charitable acts. 
</P>
<P>
"The Labor Department is the peoples' department, and what we have tried to do 
there is to use the power of the Labor Department to empower people with the 
skills they need, with safety on the job and with security of their pensions in 
their retirement years," Dole told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush said: "After a quarter-century of service to this country, 
Elizabeth Dole has earned the respect of the American people, and as secretary 
of labor she has made the workplace safer, healthier and more secure."

Israeli troops sealed the borders of the occupied territories today in an 
effort to curb a wave of bloody revenge attacks by Arabs and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
An order from Defense Minister Moshe Arens banned the nearly 1.7 million 
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip from entering Israel after attacks 
on Tuesday left two Arabs dead and seven people wounded. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, tensions over the killings of Palestinians on the Temple Mount on 
Oct. 8 increased with the death today of a 20th Arab victim. 
</P>
<P>
Police sources and family members said Salim Ahmad Khaldi, 18, was apparently 
shot by an Israeli civilian on a street near the holy site during the melee. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said another Arab also died today of beating wounds suffered 
at the hands of Israelis after he stabbed two women soldiers Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A general strike was called in Arab East Jerusalem, and activists ordered 
merchants in the main Arab shopping streets and the narrow alleys of the Old 
City to close. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview on army radio, Arens denied that confining Palestinians to the 
territories amounted to returning to the 1967 border before Israel captured the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped Palestinians would realize "that persisting in these violent 
attacks will only increase the tragedy of the Palestinian people." 
</P>
<P>
Defense Ministry spokesman Dan Naveh said the order would "last for several 
days" and should not seriously affect the troubled Israeli economy. 
</P>
<P>
At the Erez crossing into the Gaza Strip, thousands of Palestinians arrived 
today in private cars, taxis and buses. Many carried suitcases or makeshift 
bundles as they were loaded into buses and trucks to go home.

Many hostages in Iraq are sick and several rioted to protest the conditions, 
Britons returning home from Iraq said today. One diabetic said he was denied 
insulin. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in really bad shape," Jim Thompson, one of 32 Britons freed Tuesday, 
told reporters on the flight home from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, 50, an engineering company manager, said he was among 15 foreigners 
held as human shields at an Iraqi armaments factory. 
</P>
<P>
"We told the guards, unless you do something . . . we are going to have a 
disturbance," Thompson was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
He said when nothing was done, they tore down fences, broke windows, daubed 
remarks critical of President Saddam Hussein on walls and shouted anti-Hussein 
slogans until guards forced them back into their rooms at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
He did not say where the factory was located or when the incident happened. 
</P>
<P>
Others told of being moved from site to site as part of Iraq's human shield 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
Syd McCann, 52, said after Iraqi troops stopped him from escaping across the 
Syrian border, he was held at two strategic locations outside Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
One was a factory making machine parts. The other was a factory that he 
believed was making explosives or chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
"They tended to drive us backwards and forwards," he said. 
</P>
<P>
London sales executive John York, a diabetic, told the British Broadcasting 
Corp. in a radio interview: 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi authorities would not give me the insulin. I have since found out . 
. . that there is plenty of insulin available in Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors on the flight said the sick included people suffering from a variety of 
illnesses including cancer, heart trouble, diabetes, liver complaints, 
punctured eardrums, epilepsy and stress. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ronald Eccles, 42, who was detained in Iraq while on a physiology lecture 
tour, warned of health problems among those still trapped in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of stress-related diseases coming out," said Eccles, who 
suffers from severe arthritis. "People have been developing heart trouble and 
diabetes. If they had any medical problems in the past, they are flaring up and 
are made much worse by the ordeal." 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was getting upset. You start to get angry, but you don't know where 
to direct it. It's a bit dangerous to start taking it out against the Iraqi 
soldiers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 32 Britons were released Tuesday after the intervention of former Prime 
Minister Edward Heath. They arrived in London today.

The Navy has fished a rare World War II dive bomber from the depths of Lake 
Michigan and will display it at the National Museum of Naval Aviation in 
Florida.

The 32-foot SBD Douglas Dauntless, its guns still intact, was brought to the 
surface Tuesday about 16 miles off Chicago's Navy Pier, in 130 feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials said the two-seat, single-engine plane is a rare find because 
there are fewer than 10 left.

The plane sank Nov. 23, 1943, after the pilot missed a landing on the converted 
aircraft carrier Wolverine during a training mission, toppling from the 
carrier's deck into the water. The pilot was not injured.

and feared dead after the blast, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A third similar operation near an army camp at Omagh failed when a man, who had 
been strapped to the seat of the car by IRA gunmen and forced to drive it to 
the target, wriggled free. 
</P>
<P>
The detonator went off but failed to trigger the main bomb in the car. 
</P>
<P>
The predawn attacks inflicted the heaviest casualties this year in Northern 
Ireland on British forces and amounted to a major coup for the IRA.

At least 18 people were killed today in riots and by police nationwide during a 
strike called by a right-wing Hindu party that is trying to bring down Prime 
Minister V. P. Singh's government. 
</P>
<P>
Singh said he will prove on Nov. 7 that he can muster a majority in Parliament 
despite the defection of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Whether he can do so is 
questionable. India could soon face new elections. 
</P>
<P>
The government called a special one-day session of Parliament on Nov. 7. The 
reports of violence during today's strike came mostly from small cities and 
towns in western and southern India where both Hindus and Muslims live.

BHUTTO SAYS GOVERNMENT STOLE ELECTION

<P>
Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said today she had lost Pakistan's general 
election because of massive rigging by the caretaker government. 
</P>
<P>
"They have stolen the (National) Assembly from us totally," she told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto said many of her polling agents had disappeared and reports from other 
party workers indicated that ballot boxes had been stolen on a massive scale. 
</P>
<P>
She blamed the alleged corruption on President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, who dismissed 
her in August, and the caretaker government he appointed. 
</P>
<P>
Voters had turned out in unexpectedly small numbers today for the bitterly 
contested national election widely considered a referendum on the dismissal of 
Bhutto. 
</P>
<P>
At least four people were killed and 11 injured in disputes involving rival 
parties, officials said. The monthlong campaign claimed at least a dozen lives. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of heavily armed soldiers, paramilitary troops and police 
patrolled throughout the country during the voting. Today's general elections 
were only the fifth in Pakistan since its 1947 inception, and never before was 
the military deployed in such large numbers during polling. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 million people were eligible to vote, but election officials said 
turnout was light, perhaps reflecting cynicism about the future of democracy in 
Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, after casting her own vote in her ancestral hometown at 
Larkana, in southern Pakistan, Bhutto predicted victory for her party. 
</P>
<P>
"We have turned the tables on them," said Bhutto, who was unopposed in her bid 
for reelection to Parliament. "If we win, they will have no choice but to let 
us form the next government." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts had predicted that the vote would be close between Bhutto's 
left-leaning Pakistan People's Party and three smaller allied parties and the 
Islamic Democratic Alliance, a loose-knit coalition of 18 parties united only 
by their dislike for Bhutto and strained by individual ambitions.

<P>
The Treasury Department today postponed a $12-billion auction of two-year notes 
because of congressional inaction on legislation to raise the debt limit. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third postponement in less than a week. 
</P>
<P>
The debt limit dropped from $3.195 trillion to $3.12 trillion last Saturday, 
and a bill to raise the ceiling is caught up in negotiations between the Bush 
Administration and Congress over a budget for the fiscal year that began Oct. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
Since the lower ceiling already had been reached, the Treasury last Thursday 
postponed an auction of $10.75 billion in 52-week bills. And on Monday, it put 
off an $18.8-billion auction of three-month and six-month bills.

The state Department of Citrus reported today that the retail price for orange 
juice is expected to decline almost 12% during the coming year, while 
consumption of the juice is expected to increase by 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Behr, economic research director of the Florida Department of Citrus, 
said he "expected retail prices to decline as a result of higher Florida orange 
production and record world orange juice supplies." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that Florida 
would produce 165 million boxes of oranges, a 50% increase over last season's 
freeze-damaged crop.

Advertising billboards blasted as racist have brewed up a storm in Australia,

<P>
Hahn Brewing Co. said today it would consider withdrawing its advertisements 
after complaints that they are racist and ridicule black people. 
</P>
<P>
The advertisement urges drinkers to "Get Your Laughing Gear Around This." One 
depicts a black person with an elongated neck adorned with rings, while another 
shows a wide-eyed black man balancing a bottle of beer on his lip. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine Nelson Mandela's reaction, coming to Sydney and seeing ads like that," 
a New South Wales state politician said. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn Managing Director Chuck Hahn said the advertisements, which were approved 
by state advertising authorities, are making a humorous comment about the beer.

The stock market drifted in a narrow range today, continuing the indecisive 
pattern that has prevailed since the start of the week. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 10.15 to 2,504.21. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues nosed out declines on the New York Stock Exchange, with 758 
up, 718 down and 493 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 149.29 million shares, against 146.30 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index inched up .10 to 170.60. 
</P>
<P>
The price of crude oil for December delivery climbed more than $1.50 a barrel, 
to the neighborhood of $31 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that helped to put a damper on buying interest in the stock 
market, along with persistent worries about the economic outlook. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported that new factory orders for durable goods 
dropped 1.7% in September, on top of a downward-revised decline of 0.8% in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
The latest decrease stemmed mainly from a drop in transportation orders, which 
are often subject to wide short-term fluctuations. But brokers said it still 
came as something of an unpleasant surprise to investors. 
</P>
<P>
Government bond prices slumped today as investors fled the market in disgust 
over lawmakers' inability to forge a deficit-reduction bill. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year bond, which fell 1/2 point on Tuesday, was off 3/16 
point, or $1.88 per $1,000 in face amount at midday. Its yield, which rises 
when the price falls, advanced to 8.81% from 8.79% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Also depressing the market today was a spike upward in oil prices over the 
$30-a-barrel level. The move comes after a steep, week-long decline in energy 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said there was no reaction to a Commerce Department report showing 
orders to U.S. factories for "big-ticket" durable goods plunged 1.7% in 
September, the third decline in the last four months. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term maturities were 
unchanged to 1/32 point lower, intermediate maturities fell by between 1/32 
point and 1/8 point and long-term issues fell 5/32 point, the Telerate Inc. 
financial information service reported.

DISPERSAL EARLY FAVORITE IN BREEDERS' CUP 
</P>

<P>
A full field of 14 horses was entered today for the $3-million Breeders' Cup 
Classic, and Dispersal was made the early favorite at 4-1 in a race that 
trainers almost unanimously are calling "wide open." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike last year, when Sunday Silence beat Easy Goer in another installment of 
their classic rivalry, or in 1988, when Alysheba held off the gallant charge of 
Seeking the Gold, this year's Classic has produced no clear-cut favorite. 
</P>
<P>
There's Unbridled, the Kentucky Derby winner, and Dispersal, the Woodward 
winner that has won five in a row. There's Rhythm, which won the Travers, and 
Flying Continental, winner of the Jockey Club Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
With those four, and some of the others, Saturday's 1 1/4-mile run at Belmont 
Park is hard to figure. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the kind of race that any horse can win," said Carl Nafzger, 
trainer of Unbridled. "When you get a race like this, there's only two factors 
-- your horse's class and the jockeys." 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled, which will be ridden by Pat Day, drew the far outside post position. 
Starting inside of him, from the rail out, will be: Izvestia, Ibn Bey, Thirty 
Six Red, Opening Verse, Home at Last, Flying Continental, Rhythm, Beau Genius, 
Go and Go, Mi Selecto, Lively One, Dispersal and De Roche. 
</P>
<P>
Dispersal, to be ridden by Chris Antley, was made the early favorite at 
unusually long odds of 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Rhythm, trained by Shug McGaughey and ridden by Craig Perret, was listed as the 
9-2 second choice in the Classic, with Flying Continental, which will be ridden 
by Corey Black, at 5-1. The Nafzger-trained entry of Unbridled and Home at Last 
were listed at 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
Two horses, Woodward runner-up Quiet American and Defensive Play, a European 
campaigner that has never started on dirt, were listed as alternate entries and 
will be eligible to fill out the field if there are any early scratches. 
</P>
<P>
The real classic among Saturday's seven Breeders' Cup races, worth a total of 
$10 million, might be the $1-million Distaff. 
</P>
<P>
Eight were entered in the Distaff, including the 6-year-old Argentine-bred 
mare, Bayakoa, winner of six of nine starts this year, and the 3-year-old filly 
Go for Wand, winner of her last five, all Grade I stakes. 
</P>
<P>
"If we beat Go for Wand, I would think we'd get some consideration for Horse of 
the Year," Bayakoa's trainer, Ron McAnally, said. "If she'd beaten colts this 
year, there'd be no question about it, but the race is so wide open this year, 
we should get some votes." 
</P>
<P>
In post-position order, the field for the 1 1/8-mile Distaff is: Luthier's 
Launch, Go for Wand, Flags Waving, Gorgeous, Bayakoa, Colonial Waters, Valay 
Maid and Mistaurian. 
</P>
<P>
The Distaff drew the smallest of the seven fields. 
</P>
<P>
Full fields of 14 were entered in the $1-million Sprint over six furlongs, the 
$1-million Juvenile Fillies over 1 1/16 miles and the $1-million Mile on turf. 
</P>
<P>
The $1-million Juvenile, at 1 1/16 miles, drew 12 entries, and 11 were entered 
in the $2-million Turf over 1 1/2 miles.

HAS EDGE ON DOUGLAS, HOLYFIELD SAYS

<P>
If Evander Holyfield has his way, Thursday's heavyweight title fight with 
champion James (Buster) Douglas will be as much a test of minds as bodies. 
</P>
<P>
And in his mind, Holyfield feels he has a clear advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes down to the clutch, it comes down to determination and smarts," 
Holyfield said. "That's where I feel I can control the fight." 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield, undefeated in 24 fights, goes into his first heavyweight title fight 
giving away size, reach and weight to the undisputed champion. 
</P>
<P>
But his determination and focus have never been questioned, unlike those of 
Douglas, who many thought quit when he was stopped in the 10th round of a 1987 
title fight against Tony Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the deciding factor will be mental strength, and I think Evander has 
just got so much more mental strength," co-trainer Lou Duva said. "That's what 
we're gambling on." 
</P>
<P>
Oddsmakers apparently agree, making Holyfield a 7-5 favorite to beat Douglas in 
the champion's first defense of the title he won when he shocked the boxing 
world by stopping Mike Tyson in Tokyo last February. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield, a former cruiserweight champion, will be fighting as a heavyweight 
for only the seventh time against the 30-year-old Douglas, who stands 30-4-1 
after a nine-year pro career. 
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old challenger is at a decided physical disadvantage, giving away 
about 20 pounds and nearly six inches in reach to Douglas. But Holyfield's 
conditioning is impeccable and his will to win is unquestioned. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield had two trainers, strength and conditioning coaches and even a ballet 
teacher to help him prepare. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm willing to pay every price I have to pay to be the heavyweight champion," 
Holyfield said. "Both of us fight pretty well and we both have the skills. It 
becomes a mind thing, which man is stronger mentally and can adjust more to win 
the fight." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, who battled weight problems since winning the title from Tyson, 
canceled his last scheduled workout on Tuesday to concentrate instead on 
resting up for the scheduled 12-round fight. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas said he will come into the ring weighing about 230 pounds, the same he 
weighed when he knocked out Tyson in the 10th round. Holyfield is expected to 
weigh about 210 pounds at this afternoon's formal weigh-in.

A woman died of heart failure after choking on candy while cheering her son

Shawn Overocker, a tight end at St. Theresa High School, caught his first pass 
of the year during Monday night's junior varsity game against Monticello.

But when Candace Overocker began cheering, she choked on some hard candy, said 
William Mundt, Piatt County medical examiner.

<P>
"Within two minutes, she was given CPR" by paramedics attending the game, Mundt

STEFFI GRAF WILL BE GLAD TO PUT 1990 BEHIND HER

<TEXT>
<P>
Like Mike Tyson, Steffi Graf has already written off 1990, the year they both 
want to forget. 
</P>
<P>
While the seemingly invincible Tyson lost his world heavyweight boxing title, 
Graf succumbed to outside pressures her tennis skills could not overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Illness, injury and allegations surrounding her father took their toll as the 
world's No. 1 woman player watched three of the four Grand Slam titles go to 
other players. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel it was a tough year and somehow I don't want to have had it," said 
Graf, who today advanced to the quarterfinals of the Brighton WITA tournament 
with a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Nathalie Herreman of France. "There are many 
moments that I don't want to remember at all." 
</P>
<P>
Although Graf has lost only four matches all year, she won only one of the four 
major titles -- the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
She lost to Monica Seles in the French Open final, tumbled to Zina Garrison in 
the semifinals at Wimbledon and to Gabriela Sabatini in the title match of the 
U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I have had the year, it was good to come through. But I am looking to the 
end of it, definitely," she said. 
</P>
<P>
While she goes for her fourth Brighton title, her father Peter will be 
appearing in a German court in connection with a paternity suit brought by a 
German model. 
</P>
<P>
Graf acknowledged that the allegations had affected her on-court performances. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times, too many times," she said. "It was getting to me so much because 
there were times when I never played like I usually do. My concentration and my 
usual feeling was not on the court. 
</P>
<P>
"Only in Leipzig (in September) did I get to read a few papers and I was very 
upset. There were times when I was very depressed and very quiet, and I tried 
to get away from everything as much as I could. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I wasn't able to and reacted in a way I didn't want to. Sometimes I 
didn't feel comfortable at all." 
</P>
<P>
But she says she has never lost her motivation for tennis. 
</P>
<P>
"I never really thought about quitting tennis. Never," she said.

BREEDERS' CUP; 
</P>
<P>
HANDFUL OF JOCKEYS HAVE DOMINATED THE COMPETITION

With a total of $10 million in the wind Saturday at Belmont Park, the trainers 
of the horses in the seven Breeders' Cup races will leave as little as possible 
to chance. Once a horse walks through the tunnel leading from the walking ring 
to the race track, its fate is taken out of the hands of the man who has done 
the planning and preparation and placed in the hands of a jockey who weighs 
about 110 pounds and must make decisions while going 40 m.p.h. straddling the 
withers of a 1,000-pound beast. 
</P>
<P>
The jockeys are left to deal with the actual heat of battle. A trainer may have 
methodically prepared a horse to be at his best on a given afternoon and every 
detail may be in place, but the difference between success or failure often 
depends entirely on the decisions and reactions made in fractions of seconds by 
the man on its back when the gate opens. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, 85 jockeys have ridden in 42 Breeders' Cup races, but only 19 have 
ridden winners, 16 Americans and three from Europe. Not surprisingly, the most 
successful riders on Breeders' Cup days have been the leading figures of the 
last decade -- the money riders, whose skills are in perennial demand by top 
stables. 
</P>
<P>
Six jockeys have won 22 of the 42 Breeders' Cup races. The same half-dozen have 
ridden the second finishers in 20 races and finished third on 20 others. That 
totals 62 of a possible 126 placements, almost 50%. 
</P>
<P>
The leader is Laffit Pincay, who has ridden in 39 of the 42. The 43-year-old 
native of Panama has ridden five winners: Tasso in the '85 Juvenile, Capote in 
the '86 Juvenile and Skywalker in the '86 Classic, Is It True in the '88 
Juvenile and Bayakoa in the '89 Distaff, his finest Breeders' Cup moment. 
</P>
<P>
He has the mount on Bayakoa again Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Cordero, who has ridden in more Breeders' Cup races, 38, than anyone 
except Pincay, shares second position in wins with Pat Day. Each has four, 
although Day has had fewer mounts, 29. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Cordero's victories have come in the Sprint, which he won astride 
Dancing Spree for trainer Shug McGaughey last year at Gulfstream Park, and on 
Gulch in 1988. His other winners have come aboard D. Wayne Lukas-trained 
fillies, Life's Magic in the 1985 Distaff at Aqueduct and Open Mind in the 1988 
Juvenile Fillies at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
Cordero also shares the lead for second-place mounts in the Cup with Chris 
McCarron. He is in position to win the Sprint for a third straight time when he 
rides Dancing Spree, who appears to be his most formidable mount in the seventh 
Cup. In the Turf he will ride El Senor, a horse who always has a chance at 12 
furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
Day rode the first Classic winner, long-shot Wild Again, was on Lady's Secret 
in the 1986 Distaff and rode two winners in '87, Epitome in the Juvenile 
Fillies and Theatrical in the Turf. He has not ridden a Breeders' Cup winner 
since, although he was on heavily favored Easy Goer in the '88 Juvenile and the 
'89 Classic. His most prominent mount on Saturday is Kentucky Derby winner 
Unbridled in the Classic, and he will ride Jalaajel in the Mile. 
</P>
<P>
McCarron, Jose Santos and Randy Romero each have ridden three Breeders' Cup 
winners.

Carmine Abbatiello became only the second driver in harness racing history to 
win 7,000 races when he drove Right On Course to victory in the 10th race 
Tuesday night at Yonkers Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
Hall of Famer Herve Filion is the leading driver with more than 12,000 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about time," said Abbatiello, who posted his 6,999th victory two weeks 
ago. "I had over 10 chances since my last one, but something always seemed to 
happen in the stretch.' Right On Course, timed in 2:00 3/5 in a driving 
rainstorm, paid $3.60, $3.40 and $4.60.

MICHAEL JACKSON, ELTON JOHN WIN FIRST RYAN WHITE AIDS AWARD

<P>
Entertainers Michael Jackson and Elton John were selected as the first 
recipients of the Ryan White Memorial Award, which was named in the memory of 
the young AIDS victim. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made Tuesday night at a gathering of Athletes and 
Entertainers for Kids at the newly opened Tiffany &amp; Co. store on Rodeo 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The award was created to remember the young AIDS victim, who spent the final 
years of his life telling adults and youngsters about the disease and fighting 
for his rights and the rights of others who contract the virus. 
</P>
<P>
Among those attending the event were Ryan's mother, Jeanne, former Lakers star 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Olympic gold-medal swimmer Greg Louganis. 
</P>
<P>
Louganis, who had developed a close relationship with Ryan, said the youngster 
served as an inspiration to him. 
</P>
<P>
"He really was so brave," Louganis said. "That really helped me. When I hit my 
head on the springboard in Seoul, Korea (during a dive at the Olympics), it was 
like if this was Ryan White, he wouldn't give up. I know he wouldn't. He was my 
strength for a time there." 
</P>
<P>
The awards will be presented during a television show later this year.

MOVIEGOERS NEAR 1989'S RECORD PACE

Movie patrons have paid nearly $4 billion so far this year at the domestic box 
office, just slightly behind last year's record-setting pace, when ticket sales 
reached $5 billion by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
Good performances by action-adventure films such as "Marked for Death" and 
"Memphis Belle" and the continued popularity of "Ghost" have kept ticket sales 
from lagging in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The year-to-date total hit $3.92 billion over the weekend, compared to $3.97 
billion for the same period last year, Daily Variety reported Tuesday. In 1988, 
the total at the same juncture had hit $3.51 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The top 10 movies of the weekend grossed a total of $33.1 million, off 9% from 
the previous weekend's take of $36.3 million. The gross was also down 14% from 
the $38.5 million taken in by the top 10 last year, when "Look Who's Talking" 
set a fall weekend record of $14.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
For the week, the domestic box office for all movies in release reached $75.6 
million, off slightly from the $77.2 million grossed in the same week a year 
ago. In 1988, the same week produced ticket sales of $54.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Marked for Death," which has earned $28.9 million in 17 days for 20th Century 
Fox, will face stiff competition for the top spot next weekend when Paramount 
releases Stephen King's "Graveyard Shift." 
</P>
<P>
Universal's steamy "White Palace," meanwhile, may perform well as it goes into 
wide release. The romance-comedy, starring Susan Sarandon and James Spader, 
grossed $1.1 million at just 99 screens in its debut last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"Ghost" will probably pass Disney's "Pretty Woman" around Halloween as the 
year's most popular film. "Ghost" has pulled in $172.2 million for Paramount, 
and "Pretty Woman" has grossed $177.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Five other releases have topped $100 million in ticket sales this year: New 
Line's "Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles," with $133.1 million; Paramount's "Hunt 
for Red October," with $120.7 million; Carolco's "Total Recall," with $118.3 
million; Fox's "Die Hard 2," with $114.1 million, and Disney's "Dick Tracy," 
with $103.7 million.

LIZ SMITH: CRICHTON'S 'JURASSIC PARK' IS AN OLD-TIME THRILLER NOVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIZ SMITH

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"THE ENTIRE world is increasingly described by the metaphor of the theme park. 
Paris is a theme park, although it's too expensive, and the 'park employees' 
are unpleasant and sullen," writes Michael Crichton in his new novel from 
Knopf, "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
This thriller is for adults who are still fascinated by dinosaurs. What a 
whopping story it is and what a movie it will make. (Steven Spielberg already 
has the rights.) The thing about Crichton is that while he tells us his 
exciting story, he also fills the reader up to the brim with scientific facts 
and lore. 
</P>
<P>
THE APPEALING star of "Pretty Woman" -- Julia Roberts -- has her next film 
beginning on Nov. 12 and, as I've said before, it will be titled "Dying Young." 
</P>
<P>
Director Joel Schumacher and 20th Century-Fox have been casting about for a 
male star and now they've found one. He is Campbell Scott, who racked up raves 
with his onstage "Hamlet" recently in San Diego. He scored in the AIDS movie 
"Longtime Companion" and has another big film for Bernardo Bertolucci under his 
belt. It is based on the famed Paul Bowles novel "The Sheltering Sky." 
</P>
<P>
The fascinating thing about Campbell Scott is that he is the son of the great 
actor George C. Scott and the great actress Colleen Dewhurst. Talk about acting 
genes -- this kid has them! 
</P>
<P>
HASN'T THE Donald Trump relationship with that New York City powerhouse of 
P.R., Howard Rubenstein, come unraveled? The Trump One is looking around for a 
new representative between himself and the press. 
</P>
<P>
And in the meantime, although Marla Maples came off looking quite impressively 
spectacular in Vanity Fair, she is not happy about the story. Says they 
promised her a cover! 
</P>
<P>
And hasn't Ivana made a big decision we'll be hearing about at the end of this 
week -- and isn't it about time? 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, if you think that just because every time she puts her nose out 
in public, Ivana is surrounded by photographers, don't make the mistake of 
believing she is kicking up her heels. Everything Mrs. Trump does these days is 
strictly business -- either for her coming book career, her designing label, or 
her running of the Plaza Hotel. She has the picture that her economic future 
could be strictly up to her! So Ivana has been working like a dog the last few 
weeks while her doctor and friends beg her to lie down and rest. She is taking 
antibiotics for what has been described as "walking pneumonia." And those trips 
to Europe are also to shore up business and lure travel agents to the Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
ONE OF the famous triad of America's most famous female TV cops is Kate 
Jackson, who helped create "Charlie's Angels." Kate has had some ups and downs 
and hasn't really worked in almost two years. She had a bout with breast 
cancer, but says she is now A-OK. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm starting over," Kate tells me. "I am better than ever in my 
whole life. I have an entirely new outlook on life and I have back the 
enthusiasm I had when I was 20!" 
</P>
<P>
Kate has a project in development at ABC, but more than that we'll see her in 
the CBS-TV movie "The Stranger Within" on Nov. 27. This was written by John 
Pielmeier, who also wrote "Agnes of God."

BLUES HEAVEN; 
</P>
<P>
JOHN LEE HOOKER WINNING NEW ACCLAIM AT 73 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As far as John Lee Hooker is concerned, the blues wasn't born in the 
Mississippi Delta. He dates blues back further than that -- to the Garden of 
Eden. 
</P>
<P>
"When the world was born, the blues was born," he says. "There wasn't no 
problem till God put man and woman together. Then started love and heartache. 
It turned into blues." 
</P>
<P>
The 73-year-old singer, guitarist and songwriter had a hit with his first 
record, "Boogie Chillen," in 1948. Since then, he's been up and he's been down, 
opened for the Rolling Stones on one tour, paid a lot of dues. His latest 
record, "The Healer," has brought him more attention than any record he's ever 
had. 
</P>
<P>
He was recently honored at a concert in Madison Square Garden, and talked about 
the tribute a few days before. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to be here and alive," he said. "I'm just proud and I'm overjoyed 
that the people are doing this for me. It's a long time coming but it got here. 
</P>
<P>
"I paid so many dues. I've laid the path for so many other musicians to follow 
my footsteps. I'm proud of that." 
</P>
<P>
The concert was a benefit for the 12-year-old Delta Blues Museum in Hooker's 
birthplace, Clarksdale, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
A duet by Hooker and Bonnie Raitt, "I'm in the Mood," won a Grammy Award this 
year. A single now is out, "Baby Lee," by Hooker and Robert Cray. Raitt and 
Cray are on Hooker's "The Healer." So are Carlos Santana, Charlie Musselwhite, 
Los Lobos, Canned Heat and George Thorogood. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to do it because of the respect they had for me," Hooker said. 
"They didn't need the money. It's brought more attention to me than any album 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
Hooker estimates that he has made between 65 and 70 albums, and wrote or 
co-wrote all the songs on "The Healer." 
</P>
<P>
About the title: 
</P>
<P>
"The blues is a healer. It's got a meaning to it. You do things in your 
lifetime -- at the time you did it you really wanted to do it. In the end 
sometimes you see it wasn't good for you and you say, 'It served me right to 
suffer.' People hear that and say, 'Oh, that's a true lyric,' and feel better." 
</P>
<P>
Hooker lives in Vallejo, Calif., and tours two to four months a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I love to go in small nightclubs, dirt on the floor or peanuts, people 
drinking at the bar, not dressed up. They're shocked, thinking I shouldn't be 
in the funky little place with them. They're the ones put me where I am. Rich 
men don't buy records. They ain't got the time. Poor people are the ones that 
support you. They work, buy your records, come out and see you when you got a 
concert."
