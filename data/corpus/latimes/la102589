BUSINESSMAN, COMPANY CHARGED WITH BRIBING NAVY CENTER WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Marcos salesman and the Escondido company he represented were indicted 
Tuesday by a federal grand jury on charges they bribed employees of the Navy 
Public Works Center. 
</P>
<P>
Jacob Lubarsky, 51, and Las Palmas Distributors Inc. were named in the 
five-count indictment and charged with offering trips, television sets and 
other merchandise to mechanics at the Public Works Center, located at the 32nd 
Street Naval Station. 
</P>
<P>
In return for the travel and the goods, the mechanics were supposed to 
recommend that the Navy buy chemicals from Las Palmas, Assistant U.S. Atty. 
George D. Hardy said Tuesday. Las Palmas could supply chemicals the Navy uses 
to maintain its air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment, Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
The charges marked the third time in three months an indictment has been 
returned that detailed charges of bribery by contractors at the Public Works 
Center, a facility that repairs and maintains vehicles, machinery and parts. 
</P>
<P>
Four Navy mechanics already have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of 
receiving unlawful salaries, Hardy said. U.S. Magistrate Roger McKee sentenced 
the four on Sept. 7 to probation of two or three years and fines of $1,000 or 
$2,000, Hardy said, adding that three of the four also were ordered to perform 
community service. 
</P>
<P>
The charges and pleas are the product of a Naval Investigative Service probe 
that, in turn, occurred because "the Public Works Center brought things to our 
attention," Dennis E. Usery, NIS regional director, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The press makes it look like (the center is) a hotbed of criminal activity 
but, in fact, the center is cooperating fully," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate but related case, a Public Works Center purchasing agent pleaded 
guilty Oct. 16 to three counts of soliciting bribes, the result of a joint NIS 
and FBI investigation, Hardy said. Rodrigo Plata Montefalcon, 59, of Chula 
Vista, who faces a maximum of 45 years in prison plus fines, is due to be 
sentenced Jan. 8, Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
Lubarsky and Las Palmas were charged Tuesday with one count of conspiracy to 
bribe and four counts of bribery. 
</P>
<P>
Lubarsky allegedly offered the mechanics television sets, microwave ovens, 
industrial vacuum machines, videocassette recorders and trips to Hawaii, 
according to the indictment. Las Palmas allegedly would offset the costs of 
these items by reducing the quantity of the chemicals it delivered to the Navy, 
Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Levine faces a maximum of five years in federal prison on the 
conspiracy count and 15 years apiece on each of the four bribery charges, or a 
total of 65 years, Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
He also faces a fine of $250,000 on the conspiracy charge and fines of up to 
three times the amount of the bribes alleged in the four other charges, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy did not disclose the value of the alleged bribes. 
</P>
<P>
Las Palmas faces a fine of up to $500,000 on each count, Hardy said.

<TEXT>
<P>
A weak storm is expected to reach San Diego today, bringing with it cloudy 
skies, lower temperatures and a 50% chance of rain, the National Weather 
Service said. 
</P>
<P>
If rain does fall, it is expected to amount to less than a quarter of an inch, 
forecaster Frank Perdue said. The storm, which started in the Gulf of Alaska, 
is the same one that has battered Northern and Central California with heavy 
rains and strong winds. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in the San Diego area are expected to drop, with coastal highs of 
68 and overnight lows ranging into the mid-50s. Inland valleys will have highs 
of 71 today, with lows in the upper 40s overnight. High temperatures in the 
mountains will range from 48 to 56, with lows of 35 to 43. The deserts are 
expected to see highs of 74 to 82 and lows of 56 to 64.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VICTIM TESTIFIES AT TODD BRIDGES' TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A convicted drug dealer testified Tuesday that former television actor Todd 
Bridges shot him at close range, emptying the handgun until he heard its hammer 
clicking. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth (Tex) Clay took the witness stand for the prosecution on the first day 
of the Los Angeles Superior Court trial for Bridges, 24, who played Gary 
Coleman's protective older brother in the NBC-TV series "Diff'rent Strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges is on trial for first-degree attempted murder in connection with the 
Feb. 2 shooting 
</P>
<P>
"As I looked up, he shot me . . . in the mouth and I fell back," Clay 
testified. "I was trying to squirm away, but I just didn't have the strength to 
move." 
</P>
<P>
Clay, a convicted drug dealer from Texas, said he met the actor at a 
South-Central Los Angeles drug den where he worked as a bodyguard, protecting a 
cocaine dealer named "Cisco" who lived at the residence. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges, who began acting at age 6 and portrayed Willis Jackson for eight years 
on "Diff'rent Strokes," was living with two women in the same heavily fortified 
house, Clay testified. The so-called rock house was a gathering place for 
smoking crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Bridges could be sentenced to life in prison.

STAR TO ASK FOR DRUG PROGRAM IN LIEU OF JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kelsey Grammer, a star of the long-running television show "Cheers" who faces a 
cocaine possession charge, is scheduled to appear in Van Nuys Municipal Court 
on Thursday to request permission to attend a court-ordered drug-abuse 
education program. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer, 34, who plays Dr. Frasier Crane, the comically egotistical 
psychiatrist on the popular NBC series, has been charged with one felony count 
of possession of cocaine stemming from his arrest April 14 by Los Angeles 
police. 
</P>
<P>
The actor is seeking the court's permission to attend the drug-abuse education 
program, which is offered to people charged with first-time felony drug 
offenses, said Rion O'Brien, a Van Nuys Municipal Court clerk. 
</P>
<P>
If he successfully completes the program, which lasts for several months, 
Grammer would be eligible to have the cocaine possession case dismissed and the 
arrest cleared from his record after six months, O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
The cocaine charge would otherwise carry a maximum sentence of three years in 
jail, but the sentence on a first offense is typically three to six months, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrew W. Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
The actor was scheduled to appear in Van Nuys Municipal Court on Tuesday for 
the hearing but did not show up. His attorney, Robert L. Diamond, told Judge 
Aviva K. Bobb that his client apparently was confused about the date of the 
hearing and whether he had to be present. 
</P>
<P>
Bobb issued a warrant for Grammer's arrest but stayed it until Thursday, when 
Grammer's attorney said he would be present in court. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer was driving east on Riverside Drive near Whitsett Avenue about 7:15 
p.m. when he was pulled over for having expired license plate tags. According 
to the police report, Grammer had no driver's license but only a learner's 
permit in his possession. 
</P>
<P>
A computer check turned up a speeding ticket and Grammer was taken to the Van 
Nuys police station. He dropped a small packet containing about a quarter of a 
gram of cocaine, worth about $25, on the seat of the police car before entering 
the station, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer, of Van Nuys, has no prior criminal record and the Los Angeles County 
Probation Department has found that he is a suitable candidate for the 
drug-abuse education program, O'Brien said.

TRUCK CARRYING RADIOACTIVE ROCKWELL GEAR HITS UNDERPASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A truck carrying radioactively contaminated equipment from Rockwell 
International's Santa Susana Field Laboratory struck an underpass in 
Pennsylvania on Tuesday en route to a plant where the equipment is to be 
decontaminated, according to spokesmen for the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission and the Pennsylvania company. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said late Tuesday that none of the metal boxes of equipment ruptured 
and that no radioactive material escaped. But preliminary measurements showed 
that both the boxes and the truck were emitting more radiation than federal 
regulations allow, according to the NRC. 
</P>
<P>
NRC spokesman Greg Cook said agency officials in Pennsylvania and California 
will investigate to determine if violations occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Rockwell's Rocketdyne Division in Canoga Park, which operates the 
Santa Susana lab west of Chatsworth, issued a brief statement. "We are aware of 
the accident and are conducting an investigation," said Rocketdyne spokesman 
Pat Coulter. "We will not comment further until we have completed the 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
The truck was bound for Alaron Corp.'s Wampum, Pa., plant when the driver 
apparently got lost on a back road a few miles away and tried to drive through 
an underpass that was too low for the trailer, according to Peter Davin, an 
Alaron vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Davin said about eight to 10 feet of the roof was sheared off, but the truck 
was allowed to continue under escort to the Alaron plant after state police and 
emergency response officials came to the scene. It was not a Rockwell or Alaron 
truck, but a common carrier, Davin said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he thought that the shipment involved five metal boxes but was 
uncertain what type of equipment they contained. 
</P>
<P>
Following the truck's arrival at Alaron, preliminary measurements showed that 
one of the metal containers was emitting up to 2,500 millirem of radioactivity 
per hour -- well above the applicable limit of 1,000 millirem per hour, 
according to the NRC's Cook. He said a reading of 250 millirem per hour was 
recorded beneath the truck; the limit is 200. Cook said the levels registered 
are well above natural background radiation but pose no danger to neighborhoods 
through which the truck passed. 
</P>
<P>
He said NRC officials are still trying to determine if the shipment involved 
equipment covered by Santa Susana's NRC license, or if it originated in a part 
of the complex under the U. S. Department of Energy's control. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell critics have cited the risk of transportation accidents in arguing 
that nuclear work has no place in a densely populated area. 
</P>
<P>
Bowing to public pressure and economic factors, Rockwell on Friday stunned its 
critics by announcing that it will close the "hot lab" at Santa Susana -- the 
main workshop for processing nuclear materials. Rockwell had been trying to 
fend off a challenge by local activists of its request for a 10-year extension 
of the hot lab's NRC license. Yet the hot lab had had little business since its 
last contract to dismantle nuclear fuel rods for the DOE lapsed in 1986.

COURT STOPS CSUN DENTAL EXPERIMENT; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: DENTISTS WIN SUIT TO STOP A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWED LICENSED HYGIENISTS TO 
CLEAN TEETH WITHOUT SUPERVISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The 3rd District Court of Appeal in Sacramento has ordered a halt to an 
experimental program run by Cal State Northridge in which dental hygienists 
worked independently, without the supervision of a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
The court said state authorities did not follow proper procedures when they 
approved the pilot program in 1987. Sixteen Southern California dental 
hygienists are participating in the experiment, which is designed to determine 
whether hygienists can clean teeth safely and profitably without the 
supervision of a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
All other dental hygienists are required by state law to work under the 
supervision of a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ruled Friday that the Office of Statewide Health Planning and 
Development should have held a public hearing before approving the experiment. 
Four more hygienists have applied to work in the program, which comes up for 
review in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Dentists, who sued state regulators in an attempt to shut down the program, 
applauded the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not opposed to research. We are opposed to experimentation on 
unsuspecting patients," said Dr. Dale Redig, executive director of the 
California Dental Assn. "Programs that have the potential to threaten public 
health should be put through the most rigorous scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
Hygienists, 90% of whom are women, have long labored as employees in dental 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
"They got us on a technicality," said Phil Perry, assistant director of 
external affairs for the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. 
State regulators reviewed the experiment during an open meeting attended by 
dental association members but failed to keep proper transcripts or meet other 
criteria required for a proper public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to take this lying down," Perry said. Regulators will seek a 
delay while trying to appeal the court's ruling, he said, or schedule a public 
hearing on the dental program, which has operated at offices in Reseda, Van 
Nuys, La Canada and in Central and Northern California. It is directed by a 
public health specialist at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good program. It's a viable program," Perry said. "They're taking 
X-rays and cleaning teeth. If they find a cavity, they call the doctor they're 
working with." 
</P>
<P>
He said association members were "guarding their turf" and "trying to remove 
any perceived competition" because unsupervised hygienists might provide some 
dental care at a lower price than dentists charge. 
</P>
<P>
All the hygienists are licensed, and most have been practicing for 10 years or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruling was the latest setback for the experiment, called the Dental 
Hygiene Independent Practice Prototype. It was created as a result of a 1972 
law authorizing experiments in health care that would otherwise be illegal in 
an effort to find novel ways of treating patients. The hygienist project took 
six years to get under way, delayed by lack of financing and the opposition of 
the dental association, which represents more than 14,000 dentists. 
</P>
<P>
The association, saying the project amounted to a declaration of war on 
dentistry, filed suit against the program in 1987. A Sacramento Superior Court 
judge refused to halt the project, but the association appealed, leading to 
Friday's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Lombardo, an attorney for the association, said hygienists are not 
educated or licensed to diagnose dental disease or serve as primary health-care 
providers. Dentists characterized the patients as guinea pigs. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to court because this is an experimental program that necessarily 
involves human subjects," Lombardo said. "It should be scrutinized very 
carefully and in an open setting." 
</P>
<P>
But the hygienists have responded that patients of the independent hygienists 
are no more guinea pigs than patients of dentists are when the dentist is on 
vacation or takes a day off, leaving an hygienist unsupervised. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ordered the Sacramento Superior Court to require the Office 
of Statewide Health Planning and Development to halt the program.

REVAMP OF MIGRANT HOUSING PLAN SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego County supervisors Tuesday sought revisions on a set of proposed 
incentives for migrant farm-worker housing after North County Supervisor John 
MacDonald protested that the county Farm Bureau had not been consulted in 
drawing up the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The county staff-generated proposal would have allocated $55,000 in Community 
Development Block Grant funds to subsidize permit fees for much-needed 
low-income housing projects, and would have speeded up processing of the 
projects under a "fast-track" system. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Benz, executive director of the Farm Bureau, said the county proposal 
would not accomplish the purposes for which it was designed. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald, who had asked county officials to come up with a program to aid 
growers in providing housing for their workers, said he was shocked that staff 
members had not sought Farm Bureau input in proposing the incentives for 
employers willing to provide the housing. 
</P>
<P>
After supervisors approved a 90-day delay to allow for a revamp of the program, 
Benz said that a meeting of all agencies involved, including the state and 
county, might aid in simplifying the program and in avoiding bureaucratic snags 
over agencies' differing rules and definitions. 
</P>
<P>
She asked supervisors to reconsider simply waiving the county permit fees for 
farm-worker housing, a proposal they have rejected out of fear that it would 
cause budget deficits in the departments that issue the permits. 
</P>
<P>
Use of block grant funds to offset the fees might subject participating growers 
to further governmental restrictions, Benz said, as well as require "another 
layer of administration" because the funds would have to be administered by a 
community-based nonprofit organization.

MOBIL INVITES THOUSANDS TO TOUR REFINERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Denied the permits they need to conduct a full-scale open house, Mobil Oil 
Corp. officials instead have mailed more than 20,000 letters to homes near 
their Torrance refinery inviting them to tour the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Opening with a breezy "Dear Neighbor" greeting, the letters say Mobil has set 
aside two successive Saturdays -- Oct. 28 and Nov. 4 -- to sponsor a series of 
hourly group tours for roughly 40 people at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"We're anxious to share with you not only how the refinery operates, but also 
the results of our extensive modernization programs," says the letter, signed 
by refinery manager Wyman Robb. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil had hoped to attract as many as 12,000 people to a festive, $200,000 open 
house on Oct. 7, featuring refinery tours, informational booths, free food and 
rides on a Ferris wheel and carousel. 
</P>
<P>
But Torrance city officials, expressing concern that the crowd would not be 
safe on refinery grounds, balked at the plan late last month and refused to 
issue the permits Mobil needed for temporary structures, electrical wiring and 
crowd control. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, city officials offered Mobil the use of nearby Columbia Park for the 
assembly, with buses leaving at regular intervals to take small groups on tours 
of the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil officials angrily rejected that idea because it would not bring people 
directly to the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil now will rely on its own buses and existing meeting areas for the tours, 
which Mobil hopes will attract several hundred people each day. 
</P>
<P>
"This may take a little longer and it may be viewed as a little more 
complicated than the open house, but if this is what it takes to satisfy the 
city, we will comply and this is how we're going to do it," Mobil spokesman 
Barry Engelberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Refinery officials will control the number of people on refinery grounds by 
requiring reservations for a specific tour time, Engelberg said.

DECOMPOSED BODY MAY BE THAT OF MISSING GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The discovery of decomposed remains in the Arizona desert may signal the end of 
a three-state search for a 7-year-old girl who was last seen alive Oct. 2 in 
Bullhead City, Ariz., with her suspected abductor, who was later arrested by 
police in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona authorities say that the body -- found in a shallow grave Friday on the 
Fort Mohave Indian Reservation -- may be that of Rebecca Lanning. The girl who 
disappeared after riding a ferry with a man -- identified as Timothy P. 
Quinton, 24, a transient from South Carolina -- across the Colorado River to 
Bullhead City. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy conducted Tuesday in Tucson by the Pima County coroner should reveal 
the identity of the victim and the cause of death, said George Olsen of the 
coroner's office. The results of the autopsy are expected to be available early 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the body about 10 miles north of Bullhead City was reported to 
tribal police on the Indian reservation, said Jewell Potter, a spokeswoman for 
the Mohave County Sheriff's Department. Two men searching for scrap metal 
"detected a strong odor" and found the grave, Potter said. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by detectives from Bullhead City, Mohave County authorities 
uncovered the nude remains of a young girl, Potter said. The shallow grave was 
situated just off a dirt road used to enter an illegal dump, she said. Potter 
said the body was partially covered with pieces of scrap metal. 
</P>
<P>
"There's probably a good likelihood it's her (the Lanning girl) but there's no 
way to confirm that yet," said Steve Chenoweth of the FBI's Phoenix office. 
</P>
<P>
"Assuming that it is her, the federal government has no authority to 
prosecute," he said, explaining that no interstate transit laws were apparently 
violated since the child was reported missing in Arizona. The role of the FBI, 
according to Chenoweth, will be to assist local authorities in investigating 
the case.

Quinton was arrested in Oceanside Oct. 7 on suspicion of auto theft and was 
returned to Arizona last week. He is now being held on suspicion of kidnaping 
in the Mohave County Jail in Kingman. Quinton, whose bail has been set at 
$250,000, has refused to cooperate with authorities, Potter said. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence gleaned from Quinton's car by FBI agents in San Diego County has been 
forwarded to an FBI laboratory Washington for analysis, Chenoweth said. Results 
that could link Quinton with the Lanning girl's disappearence may take up to 
three weeks to materialize, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was living in a car with her mother and two other children in 
Laughlin, Nev., when she reportedly accompanied Quinton on a ferry ride across 
the Colorado River to Bullhead City. Rebecca's mother, Cynthia McGee, told 
authorities that she allowed the child to make the trip with Quinton, whom the 
mother had met a few days earlier.

PLENTY OF REASONS TO STOP THIS RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the U.S. Bureau of Land Management really wants to demonstrate that it is a 
sensitive and protective steward of the California desert, the agency would 
decide today to cancel, or at least postpone, this year's Thanksgiving-weekend 
motorcycle race from Barstow to Las Vegas. The desert does not need another 
1,700 motorcycles roaring across 170 miles of terrain, much of it designated as 
a special scenic region, just as Congress is attempting to decide the proper 
level of protection for these fragile lands and, indeed, whether the BLM is the 
agency to be managing them. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for halting this year's race are even more compelling than in the 
past. The Department of the Interior, the BLM's parent agency, declared the 
desert tortoise an endangered species several months ago. The race course would 
go directly through some prime desert tortoise habitat. But so far, the BLM has 
resisted requests from conservation organizations that it conduct a new 
environmental impact study before attempting to justify further races on 
questionable grounds that the effect on the desert is acceptable. The desert 
tortoise population has declined at an alarming rate in recent years and no 
such activity should be allowed until it is clear that the tortoise will not be 
endangered even further by an event officially sanctioned by the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The BLM's casual methods were emphasized again recently after the race sponsor 
acknowledged he bulldozed 5 1/2 miles of the race course before he had 
permission to do so. The sponsor said he just assumed he would get the BLM 
permit "and so I just went down and did it." The BLM issued a trespass notice 
only after the illegal earth-moving was called to its attention by the office 
of Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
The desert deserves better. If the BLM will not see to it, then Congress or the 
courts should.

FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
An editorial in Wednesday editions of The Times incorrectly reported that 1,700 
motorcycles were to be entered in the planned Thanksgiving weekend race from 
Barstow to Las Vegas. The correct figure is 1,200. Also, the bulldozing of a 
portion of the route occurred in 1987 and not in preparation for this year's 
race.

Was Mitroff poking fun at himself? His article asks why he, such an opponent of 
TV, agrees to go on television to promote his book which is so critical of TV. 
Who could resist -- attention, maybe fame, maybe even money! And television 
benefits as well. It gains prestige, style, self-criticism. 
</P>
<P>
And to topple irony with irony, the article appears on the very day that The 
Times announces its new format, which makes reading the paper just as easy as 
watching TV.

There's even a summary of Prof. Mitroff's article at the top -- just to make it

THESE WORDS PACK MEANING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The collapse of the Berlin Wall would have been a more dramatic sign of 
fundamental shifts in American-Soviet relations than a mere exchange of words, 
but the choice of words probably has more meaning for the long term. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, said Monday 
that the Soviet Union's occupation of Afghanistan in 1979 violated both 
acceptable international behavior and his nation's own law. 
</P>
<P>
He said also that a 30-story radar tower in Siberia that was discovered by an 
American satellite in 1983 was built in violation of a 1972 arms control treaty 
to limit ballistic missile defenses. The confession ended six years of denial 
that the station was in violation of anything at all. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in San Francisco on the same day, Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III talked of the "folly" of missing the best chance to reduce the risk of war 
"since the dawn of the nuclear age." Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
reform movement, he said, makes it possible to achieve the "sound political 
footing" that is essential for enduring arms control agreements. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's words seemed to end nine months of cautious examination of new Soviet 
thinking. The Bush Administration seems to be saying that Gorbachev is for 
real. And even though Washington spokesmen later rejected a Moscow proposal to 
disband both NATO and the Warsaw Pact, other responses had the ring of an 
agreement to join the Soviets in an armistice in the Cold War. That is a 
stunning development after 40 years of angry arms buildup in a sometimes 
terrifying race to make certain that neither superpower could be certain of 
destroying the other without gambling on obliteration in return. 
</P>
<P>
Caution probably will remain a central trait of the Bush presidency, but Baker 
Monday talked of caution while moving forward, not the caution of inertia. 
Washington wants movement toward making a surprise strike by either side 
impossible, toward broader arms control discussions and toward a political 
relationship in which it will be possible to see Soviet power first-hand from 
observation flights -- what started under President Eisenhower as an "open sky" 
policy -- rather than from satellites alone. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also said that uncertainty about Gorbachev's success "is all the more 
reason, not less, for us to seize the present opportunity." Negotiated and 
verifiable reductions of the threat of force could survive, he said, even if 
reform did not. 
</P>
<P>
A truce in the Cold War will require many changes, not the least of those in 
military planning to shift the emphasis gradually from superpower confrontation 
to regional conflicts and terrorism. The words of Monday must be followed by 
the deeds of negotiators both in arms control and on the environment and other 
problems on which the superpowers might just be able to join forces. For many 
Americans who have known nothing except the Cold War, the most important change 
probably will be in thinking that such changes are within reach. It should help 
that Washington has already started changing the way it thinks.

BOB'S BIG BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Big Boy Bowing Out: Original Glendale Diner Serves Its Last 
Burger After 51 Years," Metro, Oct. 17: 
</P>
<P>
During the 1950s Bob's was a large drive-in restaurant popular with young 
people as a hang-out "American Graffiti" style. 
</P>
<P>
About 1958, a novelty song was frequently played on the radio about a Nash 
Rambler behind a Cadillac; much horn honking was integrated into the music. The 
young people, one night, all listening to the same station on their car radios, 
proceeded to honk their horns in collective unison. 
</P>
<P>
The carhops were quite perplexed, not knowing how all the young people knew to 
honk in unison. I thought to myself -- "only in America!" 
</P>
<P>
We will miss Bob's.

'FOR REGIONAL GOVERNMENT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for the Sept. 23 editorial "For Regional Government." It places many 
important facts clearly in view. 
</P>
<P>
It is, unfortunately, unrealistic to expect adequate support for directly 
electing people to a local government adequately sized to deal with major 
regional problems such as air pollution and traffic congestion. Most local 
government officials will be opposed for fear it would lessen their power and 
most state officials will be opposed because those regionally elected officials 
successful in addressing major problems would be too-strong lead candidates to 
replace current legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Due to antiquated boundaries and inadequate funding most people tend to forget 
that we already have regional government -- we call it countries. 
</P>
<P>
It is unfortunate that our two agencies most competent and intended to deal 
with regional problems find themselves at odds. I believe Southern California 
Assn. of Governments is being quite shortsighted in opposing the bill that 
would provide license fee revenue to cities and counties through the Southern 
California Air Quality Management District. Too much chauvinism, not enough 
statesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the SCAQMD staff has gone overboard in insisting that the 
dollars necessary to SCAG to do its necessary planning be on a straight 
contractual basis rather than a more assured partnership basis. 
</P>
<P>
This problem would be solved if the state met its responsibilities in providing 
SCAG an assured source of funding sufficient to accomplish its broad 
responsibilities. There are additional disagreements but they all lend 
themselves to reasonable resolution. The future of Southern California is too 
important to allow its harm through misunderstandings and squabbles. 
</P>
<P>
As a past President of SCAG and the current chairman of the SCAQMD, I am 
strongly supportive of both agencies and very appreciative of their 
accomplishments on behalf of all of us. 
</P>
<P>
If we genuinely support home rule we will insist our state provide ample 
authority to locally elected officials to adequately address our major regional 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks again for a very much on-target and thought-provoking editorial.

LOST LUGGAGE RINGS DOWN CURTAIN ON PUPPET SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERARD GARZA, SAN DIEGO COUNTY ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Organizers of the Soviet arts festival canceled a sold-out puppet show Tuesday 
while continuing to book a substitute for the exhibit of religious icons from 
the republic of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
The Tbilisi State Marionette Theatre, which sold out all 17 of its festival 
performances, was forced to skip its Tuesday preview performance because 
luggage containing some of the marionettes remained in London en route from the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
However, most of the missing luggage arrived Tuesday, and the company will go 
on with its scheduled performance tonight at the Marie Hitchcock Puppet Theatre 
in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, festival executive director Bruce Herring said efforts were 
continuing to find a replacement for the icon exhibit, which was scheduled to 
open Sunday at the B Street Pier exhibit hall. The exhibit was canceled Monday 
after the Georgian minister of culture said "political tensions" related to a 
nationalist movement in the republic prevented the sacred icons from being 
taken out of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the substitute exhibit may be a display of 5th-Century to 
7th-Century gold pieces from the Kremlin's Armory Museum, but Herring would not 
confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
"The gold exhibit is not confirmed," Herring said. "There's a couple of 
different possibilities and we're very optimistic, but nothing's been pinned 
down. . . . Any exhibit would take a period of time to get over here and 
install." 
</P>
<P>
Herring did say that talks regarding a substitute exhibit have taken place with 
Irina Rodimtseva, director of the Kremlin state museums, who is in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Mayoral spokesman Paul Downey said Tuesday's preview performance of the 
marionettes would be rescheduled, as will a free performance because the 
marionettes didn't perform at Super Powers Sunday as planned. 
</P>
<P>
Charlene Baldridge, spokeswoman for the Old Globe Theatre, which is producing 
the marionettes' performance, said it was uncertain whether tonight's 
performance would be the premiere of "Daughter of the Trebizond Empire," a 
piece commissioned for the festival.

POWERFUL DYNAMITE IS SEIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officers from the San Diego County Sheriff's Department narcotics found two 
sticks of an extraordinarily powerful variety of dynamite when they searched a 
suspected methamphetamine lab in Lakeside, a department spokeswoman said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Narcotics agents searched the residence of Richard Howshar, 26, in the 13000 
block of Werba Valley Road on Sunday night and called in the sheriff's arson 
and explosive team after finding the dynamite, spokeswoman Lorraine Truitt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Howshar, a convicted felon, and Sandia Everett, 32, were arrested on suspicion 
of possessing a destructive device, suspicion of manufacturing a controlled 
substance and possessing a controlled substance for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The explosives are believed part of the 800 pounds of dynamite stolen from a 
Gordon Carter Construction storage bunker in Ramona in March, 1988, Truitt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Explosives investigator Sgt. Connie Grayson described the Atlas Gelmax dynamite 
as a very powerful variety with a nitroglycerin base.

HUNTER'S FRAUD AND TAX-EVASION TRIAL IS RECESSED AS PROSECUTOR BECOMES ILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
S. Gay Hugo, the lead prosecutor in Nancy Hoover Hunter's lengthy fraud and tax 
evasion trial, was stricken with chest pains Tuesday as Hunter testified and 
was eased out of San Diego's downtown federal courthouse on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo, 46, was taken out of U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam's courtroom 
shortly before 11:30 a.m., about 20 minutes after Hunter, testifying in her own 
defense, pointed out to the judge from the stand that Hugo appeared to be in 
discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo was rushed to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, where she underwent a 
"battery of tests" and was discharged shortly after 3 p.m., said Lynn Morra, a 
hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam, who immediately called a recess when Hugo was stricken, tentatively 
ordered testimony to resume today, the judge's law clerk said. U.S. Atty. 
William Braniff, however, said late Tuesday that federal prosecutors "expect 
Gay back in court Thursday" and would ask Gilliam to continue the trial one 
more day. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter is facing 197 counts of fraud and tax evasion stemming from her role as 
a top executive in J. David &amp; Co., the La Jolla investment firm that 
collapsed in 1984 when nervous investors forced it into bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators later showed that the J. David firm, headed by J. David (Jerry) 
Dominelli, Hunter's former lover, bilked 1,200 investors of $80 million. 
Dominelli pleaded guilty in 1985 to four counts of fraud and tax evasion in 
connection with the firm's Ponzi scheme and is serving a 20-year federal prison 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo, the chief prosecutor in the case, has argued since Hunter's trial began 
in March that Hunter was second in command at the firm and was actively 
involved in carrying out the giant fraud. Defense attorneys claim Hunter was 
blinded by her love for Dominelli and unaware of any illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo's illness was the second unusual event in as many days of testimony to 
bring the trial to a halt. On Friday, the financial editor of the San Diego 
Union, Don Bauder, made faces of incredulity during Hunter's testimony, 
prompting a break while Gilliam tried to figure out whether any harm had been 
done. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam allowed Hunter -- who wept during that interruption -- to resume 
testifying last Friday only after he was satisfied that jurors had not been 
improperly influenced by Bauder's gestures and ordered him to stay away from 
the trial while she was on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday marked Hunter's fourth day of testimony. She was well into it, 
discussing a company J. David had contracted to handle client accounts, when 
she whispered to Gilliam from the stand as she pointed to Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo sat still at the prosecutors' table and did not say anything as jurors, 
reporters and spectators filed out of the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
After paramedics arrived, they gave Hugo oxygen, but she was sitting up and 
alert as they wheeled her out of the courtroom. "Oh my God, they're out there," 
Hugo said when she saw a crowd of onlookers gathered to see her leave by the 
door to the rear hallway of the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo has been a federal prosecutor in San Diego for 5 1/2 years, Braniff said. 
Before moving to San Diego, she prosecuted organized crime cases in Chicago, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo also is a Del Mar city councilwoman. Coincidentally, Hunter is a former 
mayor of Del Mar.

MANY PUPILS TOO FAT, SCHOOL STUDIES REVEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA GRIEGO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When all the information was analyzed, assessed and charted, Montebello Unified 
School District trustees were not really surprised to find their worst 
suspicions confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Many Latino and Asian children are not shedding their baby fat. Like their 
Anglo and black playmates, many are just getting fatter. Worse, some are 
walking around with high cholesterol levels. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at children and seeing they are overweight and are in poor 
health before they become adults, and that's frightening," said Eleanor Chow, 
president of the Montebello Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting, school board members were given the results of a 3 
1/2-year study by a team of scientists from Cal Poly Pomona and the UC Irvine 
School of Medicine. The 18-page fitness report, one of the first of its kind in 
the nation to focus on Latino and Asian children, described how 1,000 students 
at Montebello's La Merced Intermediate School were examined each year. 
</P>
<P>
What the research team found made the trustees cringe. 
</P>
<P>
Many children were overweight and had low cardiovascular endurance and high 
cholesterol levels. They were weak and, in general, becoming less healthy every 
year, the study concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 800 children who agreed to have their blood cholesterol level checked, 
three out of eight had levels considered above normal for children. Thirteen 
percent had levels above normal for adults. On the average, over the 3 1/2-year 
period, the research team rated 40% of the boys and 45% of the girls moderately 
to severely obese by current health standards. This means that about one-third 
of their body weight was fat. 
</P>
<P>
Without treatment or intervention, some of these children are destined to 
become obese adults susceptible to heart attacks and other health problems, 
according to medical authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not good," said Dr. Stanley Bassin, a Cal Poly Pomona researcher who 
headed the team. "What we found is that children are more unhealthy than 
previously thought." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the school district's assumptions about the health of Latino and 
Asian children have been based on tests of Anglo and black youngsters, Bassin 
said. The study did not find that Latino and Asian children are much different, 
she said, but it gave educators and the medical community their first direct 
look at these groups. 
</P>
<P>
Chow said it has long been suspected that schoolchildren who spend free time 
sprawled on the floor in front of the TV, eating pizza and microwave burritos, 
are in poor health. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, upgrading physical education programs has not been a high priority 
for school administrators and trustees wrestling with budget constraints, said 
Bonnie Mohnsen, the district's new health and fitness coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what's outstanding about this report. It has given credibility to what 
we have been trying to say for a long time," Mohnsen said. "Our kids have a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
She said the district will conduct fitness tests at all six intermediate 
schools and three high schools. A salad bar already has been added to La 
Merced's cafeteria, and parents have been encouraged to feed their children 
healthier foods at home. 
</P>
<P>
The district is also looking into buying its own cholesterol screening machine 
to check all fifth-graders for high cholesterol. Perhaps most important, 
Mohnsen hopes to teach children to take responsibility for their own health and 
decide how to improve it -- a kind of physical education homework assignment.

ST. GENEVIEVE TO REVIEW TAPE OF ON-FIELD FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

St. Genevieve High football Coach Mark Lovett and Principal Rudy Trujillo will 
review videotape today of last week's game against Chaminade to determine 
whether disciplinary action is warranted against players for their role in a 
fight during the game. 
</P>
<P>
Both benches cleared and the game at Chaminade High was delayed for several 
minutes Friday night while coaches and officials struggled to restore order. 
The fourth-quarter brawl erupted after a St. Genevieve punt and with Chaminade 
leading, 45-0. Valiant defender Roel Navarro blindsided and leveled returner 
Felix Goodson after the whistle. Navarro was hit with an 
unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty. Goodson, who had called for a fair catch, was 
unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
Brother William Campbell, Chaminade's principal, said that his school is 
blameless and commended Coach Rich Lawson for his handling of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the game tape, Lawson attempted to reach Lovett at home late 
Friday to request that Navarro be disciplined. As of Tuesday, the coaches had 
not spoken. Lovett said his videotape did not capture the infraction and that 
he will borrow Lawson's copy today. Lovett said that although he does not 
condone illegal hits, he claims that Goodson regularly "taunts the opposition." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"They're saying that Felix pushed and shoved kids," he said. "My response is 
that Felix is an aggressive football player but he doesn't do anything 
malicious after the whistle to prove he's some kind of headhunter. As soon as 
he stops playing football the way the game is to be played, he's not going to 
be playing for me." 
</P>
<P>
Despite this incident of fighting -- and two other recent run-ins involving the 
Valiants and Alemany -- Lovett defended his team. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been down for a couple of years and these things makes us look like 
we're really a trash school, and we're not," he said. "There is a real bad 
feeling with the parents because they feel we've been taken advantage of. We 
feel like we're getting stepped on."

HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: DAMEWORTH BEATS THE COURSE AND COMPETITION AT 
MT. SAC; 
</P>
<P>
CROSS-COUNTRY: AGOURA RUNNER FINALLY TAKES THE MEASURE OF HIS TOUGHEST FOE AS 
HE WINS THIS INVITATIONAL TITLE WITH A PERSONAL-BEST TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Bryan Dameworth established himself as one of the top high school cross-country 
runners in the nation during his freshman, sophomore and junior years at Agoura 
High. But it wasn't until the Mt. San Antonio College Invitational last 
Saturday that he finally conquered his most unforgiving adversary. 
</P>
<P>
For three years, the third mile of the Mt. San Antonio College cross-country 
course had plagued Dameworth in his quest for titles in the prestigious Mt. SAC 
Invitational and the Southern Section 2-A Division championships. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year I always get beat right there," Dameworth said. 
</P>
<P>
So the Charger senior decided to put his foot down Saturday. Followed quickly 
by the other foot. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth survived a late surge by Arroyo Grande junior Luis Quintana and the 
final mile of the challenging three-mile course to win the team sweepstakes 
race in a personal best of 14 minutes, 41.8 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth's time -- which improved his previous best by 27.2 seconds -- moved 
him to fourth on the all-time course list behind Jeff Nelson (14:32 in 1978) of 
Burbank, Eric Mastalir (14:38 in '85) of Sacramento Jesuit and Eric Reynolds 
(14:39 in '82) of Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds also was the Kinney national cross-country champion in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think I could run better, I always do after I finish that course," 
said Dameworth, who last won the Mt. SAC Invitational while competing in the 
junior high school division as an eighth-grader at Lindero Canyon Middle School 
in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not very fond of it still," he said of the course. "I just know it too 
well. I used to like it a lot, but it's kind of getting old." 
</P>
<P>
Although Dameworth has turned in impressive performances on the Woodward Park 
course in Fresno -- site of the state championships and the Kinney West 
regional -- and at Crescenta Valley Park where the Kenny Staub Invitational is 
held, the Mt. SAC course has been his Achilles' heel. 
</P>
<P>
He placed 13th, fourth and third in the Mt. SAC Invitational during his first 
three seasons at Agoura, and third (1986), fourth ('87) and second ('88) in the 
2-A championships. 
</P>
<P>
But consider Dameworth's other accomplishments during those years: 
</P>
<P>
* As a freshman, he became the first ninth-grader to qualify for the Kinney 
national championships. 
</P>
<P>
* As a sophomore, he won the inaugural state Division I championships. 
</P>
<P>
* As a junior, he successfully defended his state Division I title and placed 
fourth in the Kinney championships in San Diego, earning All-American honors. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura Coach Bill Duley, who is also Dameworth's stepfather, said that 
Saturday's race was good for his protege. 
</P>
<P>
"It really opened up his confidence," Duley said . "Not for the season or 
anything, but for that course." 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth's time surprised Duley, who had expected his charge to run between 
14:50 and 14:55. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw him come down on the airstrip (about 200 meters from the finish 
line) and I looked at my watch and it said 14:10 (running time)," Duley 
recalled, "I said, 'Oh, my God.' "

GARCIA EFFECTIVE BUT UNINSPIRED IN MAIN EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On the excitement scale, Alex Garcia's 10-round unanimous decision over Eddie 
Gonzalez at the Country Club in Reseda on Tuesday night ranked somewhere in 
that gray area between watching old men get haircuts and spending a weekend 
re-upholstering a sofa. 
</P>
<P>
Even Gonzalez, of Houston, appeared bored with the bout. After the sixth round 
ended he followed Garcia back to his corner and swore at him. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, 213, the former national super heavyweight amateur champion, never hurt 
Gonzalez, 203. Gonzalez has fought most of his pro bouts as a light 
heavyweight. 
</P>
<P>
In a bout that did provide some action, Gabriel Ruelas of Arleta won a tough 
but unanimous six-round decision over Freddie Santos of Tijuana in a 
featherweight bout. Ruelas hammered Santos in virtually every round, but the 
veteran Santos responded to each flurry with combinations of his own, rocking 
Ruelas in two different rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Ruelas is 17-0. Santos is 23-11. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Ruelas, Gabriel's brother, had a slightly easier time in his junior 
featherweight bout. He landed a grazing right to the head of Margarito Ruiz of 
Tijuana just 20 seconds into their bout, and Ruiz tumbled into a corner. Toward 
the end of the round, Ruiz went down again and stayed on the mat for exactly 10 
seconds. Referee Lou Moret saw no punch and asked Ruiz if he wanted to continue 
fighting. Ruiz said no and was promptly disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll hold onto his purse," said Don Muse, an official of the state athletic 
commission. "We'll give him bus fare back to Tijuana and ask him not to come 
back again." 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier bout, heavyweight Rocky Pepeli of Simi Valley stirred up the most 
excitement on the night, knocking out former Oklahoma wrestling star J. R. Frye 
of Phoenix at 2:15 of the second round. He dropped Frye in the first round with 
a left hook, then ended the bout with a crushing right that sent Frye face 
first onto the mat, where he was counted out. 
</P>
<P>
Pepeli is 6-2 with six knockouts. Frye is 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
In other bouts, middleweight Jim Tunney, the grand nephew of former heavyweight 
champion Gene Tunney, was knocked out in his debut by Fred Thomas (2-1-1) of 
Los Angeles. The end came at 2:49 of the fourth round. Lightweight Ben 
Contreras of Tucson knocked out George Wally (0-1) of Van Nuys.

Fireman's Fund Corp.: The Greenwich, Conn.-based insurer's third-quarter 
earnings dropped 85% from a year ago to $7 million. Revenue totaled $904 
million, up 4%. The results were due to $36 million in pretax losses attributed 
to Hurricane Hugo and increases of $71 million recorded to reflect 
higher-than-expected legal expenses related to prior periods. The results do 
not include any losses related to the Oct. 17 earthquake in Northern 
California.

EARNINGS RETAIL: SEARS PROFIT DOWN 15.6% IN THIRD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. Tuesday said its third-quarter profit fell 15.6%, 
reflecting a sharp drop in retailing income and a storm of claims filed against 
Allstate Insurance Co. by victims of Hurricane Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
The claims of more than $250 million represented the largest storm-damage loss 
in Allstate's history, Sears said in announcing its quarterly results. 
</P>
<P>
Sears earned $257.5 million in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared to 
$305 million in the comparable 1988 quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue rose 4.8% to $13.2 billion, the Chicago-based company said. 
</P>
<P>
Income from the Sears Merchandise Group, the nation's largest retailing 
operation, plunged 25% to $82.9 million, Sears said. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue from the retailing division edged up 1.3% to $7.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Sears attributed the retailing results to a soft market for big-ticket durable 
goods, such as home appliances, and higher interest costs in the credit segment 
of the merchandise group. 
</P>
<P>
Two retail analysts expressed differing opinions on whether the performance of 
the merchandise group indicated that Sears' "everyday low pricing" strategy is 
failing. 
</P>
<P>
"My opinion is that they probably have to do more promotion to get the 
customers in the door," said Walter Loeb of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
But John Landschultz of Cowen &amp; Co. said the results "weren't bad at all." 
The real test of the new retailing strategy will come in the second half of 
1990, he said, after Sears finishes reshaping its stores into collections of 
"super stores," offering low-cost, brand-name items. 
</P>
<P>
Allstate's income fell to $126.1 million from $202.7 million, largely as a 
result of damage claims from Hurricane Hugo, which battered the southeastern 
U.S. coastline in September. 
</P>
<P>
Allstate spokesman Greg Rossiter said it was "a natural conclusion" that the 
company would also be hit with a lot of damage claims from the earthquake that 
struck northern California a week ago.

EARNINGS MEDIA: TIMES MIRROR CO. NET INCOME OFF 13% IN 3RD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Times Mirror Co. reported Tuesday that it earned $70.1 million in the third 
quarter, off 13% from the previous year, when the sale of timberlands boosted 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding those gains from asset sales, the 1989 earnings were 13% higher for 
the Los Angeles-based media company, which publishes The Times, Newsday, the 
Baltimore Sun and other newspapers. Revenue increased 7% in the quarter to 
$873.9 million from $814.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, it was better than expected," said Drew Marcus, vice president of 
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New York. "But we do have some concern about high 
cost growth and an uncertain revenue environment." 
</P>
<P>
Marcus said costs in the newspaper division increased 5.5%, outpacing revenue 
growth of 4%. That was the fastest growth in costs among the 10 newspapers that 
Marcus monitors, and he noted specifically the expense of new zoned editions at 
Newsday and the Hartford Courant as well as higher promotional costs for the 
Orange County edition of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Net income for the first three quarters of 1989 was $223.9 million, a slight 
decrease from $235.1 million in 1988. Excluding gains from asset sales in both 
years, the 1989 year-to-date earnings exceeded those in 1988 by 7%. Revenue 
totaled $2.58 billion, up 7% from $2.41 billion in the first three quarters of 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
A robust performance in cable television and professional publishing companies, 
along with improvement in broadcast operations, helped offset a decline in the 
newspaper group, primarily in the Northeast, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the newspaper division reported a 5.7% decline in year-to-year 
operating profits for the quarter. In a statement, Robert F. Erburu, Times 
Mirror chairman and chief executive, said softness in advertising volume, 
primarily in the Northeast, continued to adversely affect the newspaper 
division's performance. 
</P>
<P>
The cable television division reported a 69.7% increase in operating profit to 
$17.4 million. The company said controls on expenses and growth in the number 
of subscribers had boosted profits. 
</P>
<P>
The division responsible for book, magazine and other publishing reported that 
operating profit climbed 32.4% to $49.5 million. Improvements in the Texas 
economy helped increase earnings in the broadcast division, which includes 
television stations in Dallas and Austin, by 12.5%, to $7.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to have the newspaper weakness offset by other divisions, but I 
think what investors want to see is a rebound in the newspaper division, and I 
see no signs of that yet," said Bruce E. Thorp, an analyst with Provident 
National Bank in Philadelphia.

bangers that kill people and scare little children on the block," wrote Brenda 
Lee, a fifth-grader. "That's why we don't go outside. We need your help."

* Big first birthday: Christy Andrews celebrates her first birthday Friday. 
That's a remarkable achievement, because the Camden, N.J., girl weighed just 15

JACK SMITH: FAME IS THE NAME OF THE GAME OF THE WELL-KNOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Who or what is a celebrity? 
</P>
<P>
We had reason to ponder that question during Zsa Zsa Gabor's recent trial for 
slapping a policeman and other misdemeanors. The attention showered on Zsa Zsa 
was justified, presumably, because she is a celebrity. But what is she a 
celebrity for? 
</P>
<P>
As much as anyone else I can think of, Zsa Zsa fits the definition invented by 
Daniel J. Boorstin: "The celebrity is a person who is known for his 
well-knownness." 
</P>
<P>
Evidently Zsa Zsa enjoyed her exposure as a defendant. It validated her status 
as a celebrity. But one scans her career in vain for reasons why she should be 
so well known. In his voluminous "Film Encyclopedia," Ephraim Katz lists Zsa 
Zsa's several films, but notes that she appeared mostly as "a decoration." 
</P>
<P>
Zsa Zsa was Miss Hungary in 1936. "In the U.S.," Katz observes, "she is famous 
more for many jewels and husbands than for acting achievements." Katz notes 
that she has been a frequent "sharp-tongued guest" on TV talk shows, and 
concedes that she is "one of the most glamorous women in America." 
</P>
<P>
Celebrity is not entirely desirable. It cost John Lennon his life. He once 
said: "The postman wants an autograph. The cab driver wants a picture. The 
waitress wants a handshake. Everyone wants a piece of you." 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing a celebrity is of special importance to a reporter. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has held that a public figure cannot win damages for libel unless 
there is proof of "actual malice" as well as untruth. (It is not clear to me 
whether a mere celebrity is a public figure.) 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Glenn Easter, a law student at Western State University, Fullerton, 
sends me a copy of "Public Figure/Private Figure," a comment he had published 
in the Western State University Law Review (spring, 1989), on the complexity of 
that question. 
</P>
<P>
He notes one federal judge's lament that "defining public figures is much like 
trying to nail a jellyfish to the wall." Court rulings on who is or is not a 
public figure have been inconsistent. Easter notes that a trainer of harness 
racing horses in New York was held to be a public figure, while a trainer of 
Apaloosa race horses in Oregon was held to be a private figure. 
</P>
<P>
Courts have held that a "pervasive" or "all-purpose" public figure is one who 
has "deliberately thrust himself or his views into public controversy to 
influence others." They have also labeled others as "limited purpose" public 
figures or "part-time" public figures. 
</P>
<P>
"What of those individuals who truly do not seek publicity or controversy," 
Easter asks, "or prefer to remain Garbo-like and well outside the spotlight of 
notoriety?" 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, a court held that an air traffic controller who was accused of being 
partly responsible for an airline crash was an involuntary public figure for 
the limited purpose of discussing the crash itself. 
</P>
<P>
Easter's reference to Greta Garbo causes me to wonder whether she has ceased to 
be a public figure by sequestering herself from public view and avoiding the 
spotlight. Can a woman who was once the most celebrated actress in the world 
simply discard her celebrity by willing it? 
</P>
<P>
Easter notes that courts have warned libel defendants against "bootstrapping" 
-- that is, trying to make a plaintiff into a public figure by bathing him in 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
In this short space I cannot of course do justice to Easter's paper, but I hope 
I am right in assuming that Zsa Zsa Gabor is a public figure, and that she is 
not likely to sue me for libel. 
</P>
<P>
Since I often thrust myself into controversy, I suppose I'm a public figure 
myself, though not a celebrity. So you can say whatever you like about me, so 
long as it isn't both untrue and malicious. 
</P>
<P>
Come to think of it, if Zsa Zsa were to sue me, the notoriety would make me a 
celebrity as well as a public figure. 
</P>
<P>
But I want her to know that I bear her no malice. I interviewed Zsa Zsa once at 
the airport, when she was returning from Europe with one of her husbands in 
tow. She is an entertaining woman, if enervating. As ex-husband George Sanders 
said of their relationship: "She squeezed me like a lemon."

CONSUMER VIEWS: BENEFITS AND THE WORKING RETIREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I read with great interest your recent article about retired people 
receiving Social Security, but also working part time, and thereby getting 
their benefits recalculated each year. Since I retired in 1984, I have worked 
part time every year to the maximum allowed without being penalized. I rushed 
to my local Social Security office to find out why my benefits had not been 
recalculated. 
</P>
<P>
I was told that the early years are being indexed, and that for 1989 you need 
to earn at least $17,000 in part-time work to get your benefits recalculated. 
(Of course, $4,200 in, say, 1956, is not $4,200 in today's money.) The person 
to whom I talked was unable to tell me what type of indexing is used, however. 
</P>
<P>
I also found that the benefits for every Social Security beneficiary are not 
automatically recomputed each year. In order to have a recalculation made for 
1989, you must have earned $17,000 or above, and you must submit your W-2 form 
for the year to your local Social Security office to get any action. Who is 
right in this matter? -- B.L. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: We'll split the difference. The earlier column was in response to a 
reader who chided me for, by inference, suggesting that, once retired, Social 
Security benefits would not be increased through part-time work. He went on to 
inform me that, since retiring 11 years ago, he had had his benefits increased 
automatically every year (exclusive of cost-of-living adjustments) by virtue of 
his part-time work. 
</P>
<P>
In the follow-up column to which you refer, I probably made such increases 
sound more commonplace than they actually are -- although many Social Security 
beneficiaries do, indeed, have their benefits so increased on the basis of 
part-time work. 
</P>
<P>
Today, a Social Security beneficiary's earnings (part time) are calculated, 
and, if they are higher than his earnings for some year 20 or 25 years ago, 
today's higher earnings are calculated into benefits and the older, lower, 
earnings-year is dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1970s, though, Social Security has been indexing the early years 
to take into account, as you put it, that "$4,200 in, say, 1956, is not $4,200 
in today's money." And so the indexing was put into place to put a more 
realistic light on today's part-time earnings in terms of what comparable 
earnings would have been in, say, 1956. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the figure given you is about right -- at this moment. It takes 
part-time income of about $17,750 to offset one of those lower, earlier, years. 
But how does this jibe with the fact that the ceiling on part-time earnings for 
those 65 and older this year is $8,800? 
</P>
<P>
"The two don't really have anything to do with each other," according to Joe 
Giglio, public affairs spokesman here for Social Security, "because a Social 
Security beneficiary can earn well in excess of $8,800 in part-time work, and 
still draw, at least, partial benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Above earnings of $8,800, that is, you lose $1 in benefits for every $2 earned. 
So, if you earned $17,750, you would be penalized on the surplus $8,950, or on 
the one-for-two formula, $4,475. 
</P>
<P>
"But," Giglio adds, "if his normal monthly benefit was, say, $600, or $7,200 a 
year, he would still have been receiving annual benefits of $2,725 ($7,200 
minus $4,475)." And, of course, that base benefit would still go up because it 
is replacing -- even with indexing -- one of those earlier years. It might not 
mean much at present in terms of money in the pocket, but it will if, in the 
future, he knocks off the part-time work and draws full benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Giglio doesn't know why you were told that recomputation requires your W-2 form 
and that it isn't automatic. It is automatic.

TOP SOVIET ROCK GROUP READIES FOR S.D. DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't expect to hear "Living in the U.S.A." or "Back in the U.S.S.R." during 
the U.S. debut of the Soviet Union's top rock band, Vladimir Kuzmin and 
Dinamik, whose six-night stand at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art's 
Sherwood Auditorium begins Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the handful of other Soviet rock acts that have passed through San Diego 
in the past couple of years, Kuzmin and Dinamik have yet to be Westernized. 
They sing in Russian, not English, and they play only originals, not covers of 
American and British pop hits. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of the bands don't have their own music because they try to sound like 
Western groups, and that's because all of the idols come from America," said 
Elena Brimakova, Kuzmin's manager and interpreter. "I think to some extent it's 
the same thing with Vladimir, but he has his own music, his own words, his own 
vision." 
</P>
<P>
Kuzmin is being hyped as the Soviet Union's answer to Billy Joel and Bruce 
Springsteen. And popularity-wise, that might be true: Kuzmin's last three 
albums have each sold more than a million copies in the Soviet Union, and in a 
January, 1989, readers poll by the Moscow youth newspaper, Moscovskey 
Komsomopets, he was voted the country's top singer, songwriter, guitarist and 
poet. 
</P>
<P>
Musically, however, Kuzmin has nothing in common with either Joel or 
Springsteen. His vocals are expressive but not strained; his melodies are 
catchy but not predictable. His guitar work is dazzling and his lyrics, well, 
they're all in Russian -- so in the absence of a translation, the jury is still 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"His songs are always like small novels," Brimakova said. "Usually, they're 
about love, and this love is mostly unhappy. He sings about the condition of a 
person -- the feelings, the thoughts, of a person -- in love." 
</P>
<P>
Promoter Scott Pedersen discovered Vladimir Kuzmin and Dinamik while on a 
</P>
<P>
scouting trip to the Soviet Union last April. Of the 40 rock bands he heard 
live, Pedersen said, Kuzmin and his group impressed him the most. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went to the Soviet Union, I wasn't expecting to find something totally 
unique, something that would blow me away," Pedersen said. "But, when I saw 
Vladimir Kuzmin and Dinamik, they did just that. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe this music was happening in the Soviet Union; it was just 
so good." 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen immediately made plans to bring Kuzmin and his group to San Diego for 
a series of concerts during the Soviet arts festival. Pedersen temporarily was 
stymied by Mayor Maureen O'Connor and festival organizers, who tried to prevent 
commercial promoters from booking Soviet acts during the festival, but 
Pedersen, aided by financial backer and fellow promoter Don Hughes, was able to 
defeat the blockade. 
</P>
<P>
Brimakova recalls Kuzmin's initial reaction to the attempted ban was one of 
puzzlement. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, it was very surprising that there would be no spot for a rock band 
in the festival," Brimakova said. "It's a cultural event between two countries, 
and it seemed very strange that your mayor would want to exclude us." 
</P>
<P>
But Brimakova is glad it all worked out. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first heard the news, we decided not to give up," Brimakova said. "We 
continued our rehearsals because we fully trusted Scott Pedersen and Don Hughes 
and believed everything would come out fine -- and it did. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the most exciting thing. For a long time, we had live 
performances of Western groups in the Soviet Union, and since perestroika there 
have been lots more, promoting understanding of your people through music. I 
hope Soviet groups will be equally interesting to Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the six concerts will benefit local arts and social service agencies. 
All performances are at 8 p.m. and tickets are $25 and $30.

BRIAN WILSON'S RECORD CONTRIBUTION IS BEACHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brian Wilson won't be appearing on "The Stars Come Out For Christmas" after 
all. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Wilson was one of nearly 20 major-league pop, rock and country 
stars who had agreed to contribute a song each to the locally produced album of 
Christmas tunes to benefit the Children's Hospital and Health Center. The album 
is scheduled for a late-November release. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Vaus, the project's coordinator, was ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
"Brian Wilson was one of the first acts we invited to participate in the 
project, not only because he's a tremendous talent, but because of his close 
kinship with Southern California," Vaus said. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, we didn't think we had a prayer that he would be at all interested. 
But his office responded almost immediately, asking for more details -- and 
then, a few days later, they called back again and said Brian had just written 
a song, 'Christmas All Around the World,' that he would like to record here in 
our studio and let us use on our album. 
</P>
<P>
"Needless to say, we were thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
Alas, it was not to be. Sire Records, Wilson's label, has since refused to let 
the creative genius behind the Beach Boys participate in the project because it 
would be against corporate policy. 
</P>
<P>
"We first began to hear rumblings that there was trouble in paradise a few 
weeks later, after we had already made arrangements regarding scheduling and 
Brian's equipment needs," Vaus said. 
</P>
<P>
"His office called us up and said they were having difficulty getting 
permission from the label. Apparently Mo Ostin, chairman of Warner 
Communications, Sire's parent company, had stepped in and said he didn't want 
Brian to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I immediately sent Ostin a letter, thinking that perhaps he didn't have a 
clear idea of what this project was about and literally pleading for his help 
and intervention. 
</P>
<P>
"About a week later, I got a call from his assistant, telling me Mr. Ostin was 
just not interested in allowing it to happen. She told me, 'If we say yes to 
you, we'd have to say yes to everyone else with a similar request, and we're 
simply not in a position to do so.' " 
</P>
<P>
Warner spokesman Bob Merlis confirmed the story. 
</P>
<P>
"It is generally our policy to keep our artists off these types of compilation 
albums, and it's not because we are heartless, it's because we are deluged with 
these types of requests," Merlis said. 
</P>
<P>
"From an administrative point of view, it's easier to just write a check to the 
charity than going through mounds of paper work and delving into our artists' 
contracts to make their participation possible." 
</P>
<P>
Vaus is not placated. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we have an artist who is certainly one of the cornerstones of pop music, 
an artist who has fought against tremendous odds to make a comeback and now 
wants to give something back to the community, and he's not allowed to do so 
because of some corporate policy that I have a great deal of difficulty 
understanding," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure they have their reasons, but still, it just doesn't seem right." 
</P>
<P>
The Rolling Stones might have bypassed San Diego last week during the West 
Coast leg of the group's 1989 reunion tour, but contrary to speculation, they 
do know we exist. 
</P>
<P>
Airbourne/Zorlac, a skateboard manufacturing company in Kearny Mesa, has just 
delivered its initial shipment of Rolling Stones skateboards to specialty shops 
throughout the country. The boards were commissioned by the British supergroup 
two months ago, after they saw an ad in a national skateboard trade magazine 
for the firm's successful line of Metallica boards. 
</P>
<P>
"They saw the things we were doing with Metallica and I guess they also wanted 
to capitalize on the whole young-punk skateboard image," said Mark Schmid, the 
26-year-old co-owner of Airbourne/Zorlac. "Rock 'n' roll and skateboarding go 
hand in hand. The rock 'n' roll people want the image that the skaters have -- 
it's punk, it's hard-core, it's primitive." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after being contacted by the Stones' office, Schmid said, "We set up an 
agreement: We produce the boards, and they supply the art and get royalties." 
The four different designs, he added, are all related to the Stones' current 
tour and new album, "Steel Wheels." 
</P>
<P>
Schmid said he's optimistic that the Rolling Stones skateboards will prove as 
popular as the Metallica boards, several thousand of which have been sold since 
being introduced in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rolling Stones are such a big deal," he said, "that anything with their 
name on it will sell." 
</P>
<P>
Is Airbourne/Zorlac looking for any more rock bands to complement its line of 
Metallica and Rolling Stones skateboards? 
</P>
<P>
"They would have to fit in with the image," Schmid said. "Like, we couldn't do 
a Bee Gees board, or a Sonny and Cher board." 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: Atlantic Records has just released the first solo album in almost 
a decade by San Diego singer-songwriter Stephen Bishop. "Bowling in Paris" was 
co-produced by Phil Collins, who also plays drums and sings backup on the album 
-- joining a bevy of other notable guest artists, including Eric Clapton and 
Sting. Bishop is best known for his two 1977 hits, "Save It for a Rainy Day" 
and "On and On." . . . 
</P>
<P>
There's no fancy menu requirements, like pickled lime rinds or Courvoisier VSOP 
Cognac, in the contract rider for Vladimir Kuzmin and Dinamik, the Soviet rock 
band performing Thursday through Tuesday at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary 
Art's Sherwood Auditorium. Just a couple of pitchers of "drinkable water" on 
stage during each show. Wednesday night, Kuzmin will be at La Jolla's Hard Rock 
Cafe for a welcome party, open to the public, at 10 p.m. . . . The Cramps have 
canceled Friday and Saturday night concerts at Iguanas in Tijuana because 
guitarist Poison Ivy is still recovering from recent eye surgery, according to 
promoter Harlan Schiffman. Schiffman said he hopes to reschedule the dates 
sometime early next year. Refunds are available at points of purchase. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: a grown-up Donny Osmond, tonight at the 
California Theater downtown; the Dynatones, also tonight at the Belly Up Tavern 
in Solana Beach; Peter Case and the Walking Wounded, Thursday at the Belly Up 
Tavern; Concrete Blonde, also Thursday at Iguanas; Top Jimmy and the Rhythm 
Pigs, Friday at the Casbah in Middletown; Jimmy Cliff, Saturday at the Belly Up 
Tavern; Flock of Seagulls, also Saturday at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa; 
Deborah Harry, Sunday at the Bacchanal, and Bad English, Oct. 30 at the 
Bacchanal.

SIGNS OF A THAW IN HARRY'S GIG AT COUNTRY CLUB

Deborah Harry opened her show at the Country Club on Monday not with the 
expected bang, but with a touch of restraint. It was daring and surprising 
enough to enrich the rest of the set, which wasn't all that daring or 
surprising -- at least until the final encore, when Harry saluted two New York 
influences with versions of the Velvet Underground's "Waiting for the Man" and 
the Ramones' "Pet Sematary." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a splashy Blondie hit or an upbeat tune from her new album, the 
new-wave-era pinup girl began with a low-key, Peggy Lee-style version of Smokey 
Robinson's 1967 Marvelettes hit "The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game." With 
its eerie mood and odd little stairstep lines, the song demanded every bit of 
Harry's limited expressive and technical range. It also caught the crowd off 
guard Monday, drawing them in instead of blowing them away. 
</P>
<P>
From there it was a more predictable pastiche of Blondie songs (all four of the 
New York group's No. 1 hits) and numbers from her new "Def, Dumb &amp; Blonde" 
LP. Of the latter, only "I Want That Man" has the spark and buoyancy of the old 
stuff, but her five-piece band -- which includes Blondie architect Chris Stein 
and a drummer, Jimmy Clark, with the moves and drive of Blondie's Clem Burke -- 
mowed through it all with such vigor that the momentum rarely let up. Not too 
slick, not too sloppy. 
</P>
<P>
Even though she's still looking for her footing as a solo act seven years after 
the end of Blondie, Harry retains her Warhol-superstar cool, and remains a 
puzzling performer: stiff but sometimes endearing, aloof but somehow able to 
connect with a loyal following ranging from pop purists to soft-core 
slam-dancers to true believers -- like a guy frantically holding up a leather 
jacket with her picture on it, desperate for her notice. She did -- one 
indication of a welcome thaw. This was noticeably warmer than Blondie was at 
the end. 
</P>
<P>
Harry has moved over to the Roxy, where she continues through Thursday before 
shows at the Coach House on Saturday and the Bacchanal in San Diego on 
Sunday.RICHARD CROMELIN

Comedian Rodney Dangerfield will sit out another appearance at Bally's Hotel 
and Casino in Las Vegas rather than cross musicians' picket lines, but the 
Pointer Sisters and singer Engelbert Humperdinck are expected to keep their 
scheduled dates this week. The Pointers, who refused to cross the picket line 
earlier, are set to play Caesars Palace tonight through Monday. Humperdinck was 
scheduled to begin Tuesday night at the Las Vegas Hilton. He performed earlier 
this year despite the strike, then quit midway through the engagement to honor 
the line. Musicians have been on strike for 20 weeks over the issue of taped 
music and guaranteed work. Several entertainers have honored the picket lines, 
but more are beginning to return to the showrooms. Dangerfield, who was to open 
Thursday, says he is "very anxious to go back to work, but I find it 
emotionally very difficult to go out and tell jokes while this unpleasant 
situation still exists." ALEENE MacMINN

YA-YIN REFLECTS WESTERN INFLUENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Western notions of realism are beginning to creep into the bare-stage 
traditions of Chinese opera, as witnessed in the presentation of "The Gall of 
the Peacock" by the Ya-Yin Ensemble of Taiwan at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Adapted from a traditional opera ("The Bridge of Tung Chi") by An-Ch'i Wang, 
the Ya-Yin Ensemble utilized a series of innovations to tell the story of love, 
political intrigue and civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Innovations obvious to the Westerner included far greater use of props, painted 
back-drops (derived from classical scrolls), severe lighting changes (including 
strobe and -- overused -- portentous flashings), and expanded orchestration to 
include violin and cello. 
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, also, other musical styles were incorporated, speech and song 
repetitions were pared down (shaving off at least half an hour from the 
original), make-up and costumes were less rigidly assigned according to 
tradition and actors' movements were made more realistic. 
</P>
<P>
None of the changes appeared to discomfort the largely Chinese audience Monday, 
who applauded the principals frequently for their execution of the distinctive 
staccato melismas that seem to correspond to operatic cadenzas. 
</P>
<P>
As the central Princess Ah-Kai, Hsiao-Chuang Kuo, director of the troupe, made 
the most of luscious opportunities to pass from girlish happiness to tragic 
grief. As her husband, the victorious warrior Kung Tuan, Fu-Yung Ts'ao was 
properly heroic and noble. 
</P>
<P>
Lu-Hao Chu was the treacherous, virtuosic Nieh Shih. 
</P>
<P>
Among a host of strong supporting cast members, Chin-Jung Chu, as the general 
Yuan-Hai Yang, offered a powerful suicide scene, and Hsi-Jung Liu was the 
spectacularly acrobatic Horse Boy. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for everyone, the Chinese text and an English translation were 
projected onto screens at the side of the stage. Although the translation often 
went out of sync with the action, that mattered far less than one would expect, 
and only occasionally did the misspellings or grammatical irregularities prove 
impenetrable.

JUDGE SLAPS ZSA ZSA WITH 3 DAYS IN JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL and PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zsa Zsa Gabor, who turned a routine traffic stop into a slap heard around the 
world, Tuesday was ordered to serve three days in jail, to pay fines and 
retribution totaling $12,937, to perform 120 hours of community service -- and 
to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could let emotions enter into this, Ms. Gabor, I can assure you that you 
would spend a far longer time in county jail," Beverly Hills Municipal Judge 
Charles G. Rubin said after a four-hour hearing before a packed courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
In his strongly worded ruling, Rubin said he decided against a longer jail 
term, in part because of the actress's age -- she is reportedly 66 -- and 
because she brought no physical harm to Beverly Hills Police Officer Paul 
Kramer when she slapped him with her open right palm on June 14. 
</P>
<P>
But the judge expressed outrage over Gabor's behavior throughout the three-week 
trial, which attracted worldwide attention last month. The usually placid Rubin 
accused the former Miss Hungary of "milking" the criminal justice system to 
publicize herself and unfairly attacking Kramer and the Beverly Hills Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor lashed out at Kramer repeatedly during the trial, accusing the motorcycle 
officer at one point of having several gay lovers. She also contradicted 
herself numerous times while on the witness stand and claimed that police 
videotapes of her made after her arrest were doctored to show her using vulgar 
language. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin ordered Gabor to pay the largest single chunk of her retribution -- 
$10,000 -- to Beverly Hills police to help offset the department's cost of 
conducting the trial. He made it clear that the award was an unusual one, 
handed down because of Gabor's "aggressive verbal attacks" on the department. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor was fined $2,350 for slapping Kramer, $352 for driving without a license 
and $235 for possessing an open container of alcohol -- a flask of Jack Daniels 
-- in her Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
In ordering her to undergo psychiatric evaluation, Rubin said he saw in Gabor 
evidence of "hyper" or "manic" behavior -- although not enough to stand as a 
legal defense against her crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"She has demonstrated an attitude of continual contempt for the legal system," 
Rubin said. "Miss Gabor, in this case, not only slapped the face of Officer 
Kramer out there on Olympic Boulevard. But by her vituperative and denigrating 
comments, she has verbally slapped the faces . . . of almost every prosecution 
witness that appeared in this case. And she was not satisfied with that, but 
she turned around and slapped the face of every American by claiming that the 
United States is worse than Communist Russia. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Sits Silently 
</P>
<P>
Gabor, who conceded she was nervous before sentencing, sat silent and 
motionless as Rubin commented on each of the three misdemeanor counts. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, apparently seeing Gabor smile, Rubin warned her, "You laugh, Ms. 
Gabor. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Quickly, Gabor said, "I'm not laughing." 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, Gabor defended her comments during the trial by saying, "I have 
said the gospel truth -- I don't know if you know what that means." 
</P>
<P>
Rubin responded by describing her courtroom demeanor as "a continuing tantrum," 
adding: "It's time for you to stop it and begin acting like the kind of lady 
you so repeatedly say that you are." 
</P>
<P>
Gabor has 30 days to appeal the sentence, but her attorney, Harrison E. Bull, 
declined to say whether such action would be filed. "The options are open to 
us," he said. "I don't want to comment on his (Rubin's) comments." 
</P>
<P>
Gabor said, "Thank God it's over," and added, "I am a very good American. I 
love America, I will say that," before leaving the third-floor courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
But the actress, who regularly spoke to reporters throughout the trial, eluded 
a crowd of about 60 media representatives waiting on the courthouse steps, 
apparently leaving via a rear exit. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Prince Frederick Von Anhalt of West Germany, left the courthouse 
alone, calling the sentence unfair and saying he would volunteer to serve time 
in her place. 
</P>
<P>
He was greeted by a street band, Hello Disaster, whose three members wore black 
leather jackets and played a specially written song, "Let There Be Justice," 
celebrating Gabor's jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just happy she got something," said band member Shaun Kay, 21. "I think 
she really could have gotten more of a sentence." 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner had sought a 30-day sentence. But at a press conference 
Tuesday afternoon he expressed pleasure that the judge "did recognize, and in 
strong terms, that she must go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
"Zsa Zsa Gabor tried to make a mockery out of the idea of equal justice," 
Reiner said. "She has an unfortunate history of trying to turn everything into 
farce and to mock everything. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, this did not start out as a particularly important case," Reiner 
added. "It started out as a minor incident. But what elevated this beyond . . . 
a minor case was her conduct over that three-week period during the trial where 
she made a mockery out of everything. And it wasn't just a mockery of the 
criminal justice system . . . the judge, the police officers, the court 
personnel, the prosecutors, the entire system, which she dismissed as a 
Nazi-type system because anybody would presume to judge Zsa Zsa Gabor." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills police spokesman Lt. Robert Curtis said that Police Chief Marvin 
D. Iannone called the sentencing "eminently fair." 
</P>
<P>
"The chief feels that the department has been truly vindicated and that the 
judicial process has run its course," he said, noting that Kramer was not 
expected to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin pronounced sentence after denying a bid by Bull for a new trial, based on 
assertions that Gabor's trial lawyer had improperly solicited her business and 
was unsuited to handle the case. 
</P>
<P>
Bull, hired by Gabor earlier this month, argued that the actress's former 
attorney, William Graysen, violated state Bar Assn. policies by volunteering to 
handle the case free because of the publicity it would bring him. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Bull argued that Graysen violated similar policies by 
"guaranteeing" to Gabor that she would not go to jail, thus implying that the 
actress could speak out or act any way she chose during the trial, which cost 
$30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Elden Fox, however, noted that Graysen was not involved in 
Gabor's appearances on "Entertainment Tonight," "The Arsenio Hall Show" and 
other television and radio shows in which the actress appeared to seek 
publicity after her arrest. 
</P>
<P>
In denying the motion, Rubin said, "It is clear to the court that Ms. Gabor is 
a very aware and sophisticated person who . . . could have chosen any attorney 
she wanted to. She chose Mr. Graysen above all others."

OFFICIAL SAW NO NEED TO BOLSTER BRIDGES IN '85 
</P>

A senior state Department of Transportation engineer in charge of the program 
to strengthen bridges to make them earthquake-resistant reported in 1985 that 
there was no need to bolster bridge columns until future earthquakes showed 
them to be vulnerable, state documents show. 
</P>
<P>
Ray J. Zelinski, head of the bridge retrofitting program, told participants in 
a seismic workshop in New Zealand that California's project to tie bridge 
roadbeds together with steel cables may have made it unnecessary to strengthen 
supporting columns. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be noted," Zelinski said in a paper delivered at the workshop, "that 
column retrofits have been avoided by designing restraining features in a 
manner which circumvents collapse due to column damage. Review of behavior of 
retrofitted bridges during earthquakes will determine whether features will 
need improvement and whether columns need to be considered for retrofitting." 
</P>
<P>
Zelinski's paper was released by Caltrans on Monday along with a raft of other 
technical documents. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials have come under criticism from structural engineers for not 
doing retrofitting work on the columns of the double-decked Nimitz Freeway in 
Oakland that collapsed and killed at least 39 people in last Tuesday's 
earthquake. It is not clear whether the structure collapsed because of column 
failure or some other weakness in the structure. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials have maintained that further research is necessary before 
multiple columns such as those that held up the Nimitz can be reinforced. They 
say that funding limitations have prevented a more accelerated retrofitting 
program. 
</P>
<P>
But James E. Roberts, chief of Caltrans' structures division, acknowledged 
Tuesday that the the retrofitting program may well have been slowed down 
because of the belief of Zelinski and other state engineers that such 
reinforcement was not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"That tells you about why we haven't seen the need to move . . . faster," 
Roberts told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts stressed that he thought the project to tie roadbed sections together 
had been highly effective. Such reinforcement had been done on the Nimitz. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Zelinski still believes the tie-down system should be enough to 
prevent bridge failures, although the collapse of the Nimitz "shakes his faith 
a little." 
</P>
<P>
Based partly on conclusions by the department's seismic unit, Caltrans in 1985 
told the state Division of Mines and Geology that bridges along Interstate 880 
in Alameda County, including the Nimitz, could be expected to withstand a quake 
more severe than last week's 7.1-magnitude temblor, although they would suffer 
some damage. 
</P>
<P>
Zelinski himself has acknowledged stating in 1985 that the retrofit program 
would protect every bridge in the system against a quake as severe as the 
8-magnitude 1906 earthquake that destroyed San Francisco. Zelinski has been 
ordered by superiors and Caltrans attorneys not to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
Since last week's Bay Area quake, Caltrans engineers have sought to portray 
their retrofitting program as an orderly, three-phase project that started with 
roadbeds, would move to freeways supported by single columns and then conclude 
with work on multiple-column structures such as the Nimitz. But interviews and 
documents released by the department suggest that the pace of the program was 
actually set by a series of major quakes in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts maintains that it has been the department's goal since the 1971 Sylmar 
earthquake in the San Fernando Valley to retrofit both columns and roadbeds. 
Both of those failed during the Sylmar quake. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not until after the 1987 Whittier quake severely damaged some 
freeway columns in the Los Angeles area that Caltrans approved a contract with 
the University of California at San Diego for research into strengthening 
columns. Roberts says Caltrans officials had been discussing such research 
before the Whittier earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans engineers conceded Tuesday that the research now under way at UC San 
Diego was never intended to address multiple-column structures such as the 
Nimitz. In light of the collapse, such multiple-column freeways are now 
considered vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
"They (UCSD researchers) haven't been asked to do that," Roberts said. "We're 
talking about it." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the UCSD work is aimed at finding a way to strengthen structures 
supported by cylindrical single columns. About 700 such bridges and elevated 
highways were considered the highest priority before the Bay Area quake, and 
still are, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that he recommended to Gov. George Deukmejian in a 
face-to-face meeting the day after the Bay Area earthquake that research on the 
multiple-column structures be accelerated. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get a 'No,' so we are going to move ahead," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
In another development Tuesday, a former Caltrans bridge designer who now is 
public works director for the city of Pleasant Hill alleged that the Nimitz 
structure was not designed to the highest engineering standards when it was 
built in the mid-1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Jim See, who worked at the construction site as an entry-level engineer before 
going on to design bridges, said the freeway's columns were not sufficiently 
reinforced with horizontal steel supports. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans has maintained that this was not done because standards at the time 
did not include such supports. But See, pointing to a 1952 design manual 
published by the Chicago-based Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute, disputes 
that. 
</P>
<P>
The Nimitz structure, which opened in 1957, had columns with vertical steel 
reinforcement. The vertical steel bars were circled by a single horizontal bar 
every 12 inches along the length of each column. 
</P>
<P>
But the design manual, which is based on standards published by the American 
Concrete Institute and the American Assn. of State Highway and Transportation 
Officials, calls for a different, stronger approach, according to See. The 
manual suggests that every vertical steel bar be wrapped by interlacing 
horizontal bars to restrain its movement in any direction. 
</P>
<P>
"Every bar must be braced," said See, who has examined the original plans for 
the structure and visited the site of the disaster. "Any bar that is not braced 
will fail." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said his staff is investigating See's allegation. Roberts said he 
believes that the bridge was built to standards set by the American Assn. of 
State Highway Officials. In any case, he said, columns with the kind of 
supports described by See failed in the 1971 San Fernando quake and are no 
longer used. 
</P>
<P>
If See is correct, Roberts said, then "a whole lot of people who are paid to 
review the construction, including the federal government, which comes back and 
does an audit inspection, didn't do their jobs."

SOVIET PARTY MAY LOSE ITS RESERVED LEGISLATIVE SEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Soviet lawmakers, rebelling against the Kremlin leadership, voted Tuesday to 
eliminate the Communist Party's reserved seats in the country's national 
assembly and other legislative bodies. 
</P>
<P>
The move, a dramatic reflection of the rapid evolution of a new political 
system here, would force party leaders, including President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, to run in open, competitive elections. 
</P>
<P>
After two days of heated debate, the Supreme Soviet, the country's Parliament, 
voted overwhelmingly against a proposed constitutional amendment reserving 
seats in the Congress of People's Deputies -- the national assembly -- and in 
lower-level councils for representatives of the Communist Party, the Communist 
Youth League, the country's labor unions, veterans and other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
What the lawmakers demanded was an electoral system based on the principle of 
"one person, one vote," with the party and other organizations nominating 
candidates to compete against others from local groups. 
</P>
<P>
In Soviet terms, the lawmakers were also affirming the principle of "all power 
to the soviets," the country's system of elected councils that is now being 
restored, and declaring that elected rather than appointed bodies must govern 
if basic political reforms are to succeed here. 
</P>
<P>
Voting 254 to 85 against the reservation of one-third of the seats for special 
nominees, the deputies declared their independence from the party leadership, 
which had pushed hard to retain the reserved seats as its bedrock in all 
legislative organs. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the lawmakers recognized that the country's emerging 
political structures and shifting alliances could not be frozen prematurely in 
constitutional forms. 
</P>
<P>
The package of constitutional amendments must still be approved by the present 
Congress of People's Deputies, one-third of whose 2,250 members were elected 
from such "public organizations" as the party and labor unions. And any change 
will not take effect on a national level until the next parliamentary election, 
which is scheduled for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the impact of the vote is likely to be immediate and large, with 
elections to city councils and other local governments planned for December and 
elections to republican legislatures scheduled from December into March. The 
deputies recommended that the country's 15 constituent republics encompass the 
legislature's action in drafting local election laws. 
</P>
<P>
Hard-pressed to justify many of its policies and to explain the failure of 
perestroika -- Gorbachev's program of political and economic restructuring -- 
to improve life as much as promised, the party was already expecting 
substantial trouble in retaining control of many local governments. Among the 
regional trouble spots for the party are the Baltic republics of Estonia, 
Latvia and Lithuania, perhaps the southern republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and 
Georgia, and the Ukraine, Byelorussia and Moldavia. 
</P>
<P>
If the party and its allies were able to fill one-third of the seats in the 
Lithuanian Supreme Soviet, for example, the Lithuanian Reform Movement, known 
as Sajudis, might find itself fighting for a majority in the republic's 
legislature -- although it would win more than 80% of a popular plebiscite. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's vote was also a landmark in national politics. 
</P>
<P>
Not only had the deputies defied the party leadership, even though many of them 
were chosen for the Supreme Soviet because of their presumed political 
docility, they had also laid the basis for a more independent political system. 
</P>
<P>
"This was well beyond our expectations," Sergei Stankevich, a liberal political 
scientist who represents a Moscow district, told reporters. The party's 
nominees "will now have to win their seats in open electoral fights like 
everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
The move may not, in fact, diminish the Communist Party's hold on the Congress 
of People's Deputies or on the Supreme Soviet, a body of 542 deputies selected 
from within the congress, because party members won more than 85% of the seats 
in the national elections last March. But it will free even party members from 
the discipline that the party's policy-making Central Committee and its 
powerful secretariat would like to exercise. 
</P>
<P>
The system used in last spring's parliamentary elections had given party 
members a greater role in constituting the Congress of People's Deputies 
because many organizations had elected three, four or more representatives to 
the body. 
</P>
<P>
Communist Party officials, starting with Anatoly I. Lukyanov, the country's 
first vice president and a key Gorbachev aide, had pressed for the continuation 
of this system, calling it "proven" because of the March election. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not just a question about elections, but of power," Vitaly I. 
Vorotnikov, president of the Russian Federation, said, perhaps reflecting his 
own anxiety about a direct election. "It may lead to a . . . presidential form 
of rule, abolishing our collegial soviet system. Won't these amendments turn 
the soviet system on its head?"

<P>
Down at the office, Gideon Skhosana is a man respected. He directs a district 
sales team, charts the performance of his salespeople on pegboards and 
schmoozes with the big customers. 
</P>
<P>
Skhosana jokes easily there, tilting his goateed chin back with a booming 
laugh. That relaxed sense of humor and his marketing skills make him "a super 
bloke to work for," says his secretary, who is white. 
</P>
<P>
But down at the New Lantern, one of Welkom's most popular drive-in restaurants, 
Gideon Skhosana is just another black man. His family eats on paper plates 
inside the car while his secretary's family and the other white diners are 
served on china, at picnic tables shaded by thatch umbrellas. 
</P>
<P>
And on the drive home, when Skhosana leaves the wide, palm-lined boulevards of 
Welkom for the dusty, congested ghetto of Motse Thabong, the last warmth of the 
respect he feels at the office is chilled away. 
</P>
<P>
There's usually a police roadblock at the township entrance, where he and other 
blacks who work in the mining town are stopped. His company car is searched by 
grim-faced police looking for automatic pistols and limpet mines in the 
mornings, gold nuggets in the evenings. 
</P>
<P>
These are the two worlds of one angry black man in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Giving blacks an economic stake in the system was the government's idea. It 
figured that the more black people with new cars and microwave ovens, steady 
paychecks and tall mortgages, the fewer black people agitating for rapid change 
or revolution. 
</P>
<P>
But it hasn't worked out that way. 
</P>
<P>
One million black men and women have ascended into the middle class and beyond 
in recent years only to become even more embittered than their poorer neighbors 
by the system that dictates where they may live and denies them a vote on their 
own future. 
</P>
<P>
From the outside, they often appear content with the status quo, their silence 
bought and paid for by the government. But, in their hearts, they resent being 
prevented from enjoying all the privileges of a hefty paycheck. Many yearn to 
run this country, a prospect even the new reform-minded president doesn't 
contemplate. And they've become an impatient and quietly militant force for 
their own liberation. 
</P>
<P>
"You can make us managers and give us a lot of money, but if you don't get rid 
of apartheid, if you don't stop treating us differently from whites, we're 
nothing but the wealthy, educated oppressed," the Rev. Frank Chikane, general 
secretary of the South African Council of Churches, says. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way they can co-opt me in that type of system." 
</P>
<P>
Gideon Skhosana works in Welkom, a community of parks, clean streets and 60,000 
white residents. The name means "welcome" in the language of the white 
Afrikaners, and the town sits at the crossroads of farming and mining on the 
vast platteland of the Orange Free State, for generations the prairie home of 
South Africa's most conservative whites. 
</P>
<P>
Most white folks here think integration, or "mixing," is something that happens 
only far away, in big cities like Johannesburg, for instance, where in their 
view too many white do-gooders have opened the floodgates. In the clean, modern 
short-stack building where Skhosana works, a doctor's office has a sign, in 
Afrikaans, directing "blacks and Coloreds" to a separate waiting room. 
</P>
<P>
Gold makes Welkom's economy glitter, and black labor makes the gold mines run. 
The area has 40 mine shafts, seven of them inside the city limits, and the town 
has sprouted around 50-foot-tall ridges of bleached-white soil, the mines' 
byproduct. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Place of Happiness' 
</P>
<P>
Most of the black workers in those mines live on the outskirts of Welkom under 
a perennial haze of coal smoke in the township of Motse Thabong, a Zulu phrase 
meaning "place of happiness." About 80,000 blacks live there in small, square 
houses along potholed roads paved in litter. 
</P>
<P>
Gideon, his wife Maureen, and their 2-year-old daughter, Kanabo, came 
house-hunting three years ago when South African Breweries offered Skhosana a 
job in its Welkom office. They had been renting in Soweto, the 2.2-million 
population township near Johannesburg, but the new job gave them enough money 
to buy. 
</P>
<P>
They could afford to live in one of Welkom's garden suburbs, where the 
ranch-style homes, back-yard swimming pools and leafy cul-de-sacs resemble many 
neighborhoods in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley. The real estate market there 
is soft, with too many houses and not enough buyers, and departing residents 
often complain about how difficult it is to sell their homes. 
</P>
<P>
But the Group Areas Act prevents Skhosana from living there. That 40-year-old 
law, which even the new reform-minded government is committed to preserving, 
means blacks who work in Welkom must live in Thabong, where housing is scarce. 
</P>
<P>
The Skhosanas settled on a three-bedroom brick home for $20,000 in a new 
subdivision, at the time the fanciest in the township, where police officers, 
post office workers, lawyers and teachers live. 
</P>
<P>
It looks like many American working-class neighborhoods, with nearly identical 
houses on tiny plots fenced in chain-link. But there are no trees or street 
lights and only a few paved roads. Frequent power outages bathe the 
neighborhood in darkness. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a choice, I wouldn't live here," Skhosana said, sitting in a living 
room only slightly larger than his downtown office. "I'd rather live in a white 
area. Not because it's white, but because it's better." 
</P>
<P>
The Skhosanas and their closest neighbors have stuffed their houses with an 
array of furnishings not generally found elsewhere in the township. Their 
kitchens have built-in Kelvinator ovens with smoked-glass windows. Skhosana's 
living room has soft imitation-leather sofas, an Oriental rug, glass coffee 
tables, a stereo system, a color television and a VCR. Maureen Skhosana parks 
her 1979 Volkswagen Beetle in the one-car garage. Skhosana himself keeps the 
company Toyota in the yard, inside the fence, to thwart thieves. 
</P>
<P>
When the Skhosanas and their friends get together, the talk is about jobs and 
politics, sports and house designs, private schools and servants. On the 
kitchen counter the other day, next to the food processor, was the latest issue 
of Fair Lady, a magazine whose motto is, "The Chic of It." 
</P>
<P>
Maureen, a social worker, has a full-time black housekeeper who doubles as a 
baby-sitter when Kanabo arrives home from St. Andrews, a private, multiracial 
school where she is in first grade. 
</P>
<P>
The Skhosana family's life style is one of the reasons blacks are the 
fastest-growing consumer market in South Africa, where 26 million of them 
outnumber whites 5-to-1. Black buying power will overtake white within the next 
decade, researchers say, and black-oriented magazines are thick with ads for 
everything from vinyl flooring to Chivas Regal to BMWs. 
</P>
<P>
Tribute Magazine, for example, regularly analyzes stock market investments and 
reviews books selling for more than $35. Alongside society photographs, it 
recently profiled 100 self-made black businessmen, including one who owns a 
race horse that he runs under the black, green and gold colors of the outlawed 
African National Congress, the principal guerrilla group fighting Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
By its sheer numbers, the black middle class is forcing open doors once closed 
by the government. Blacks may now own homes and run businesses with fewer 
restrictions, but they still need permission to do business in most white 
towns. 
</P>
<P>
'Shock Absorbers' 
</P>
<P>
Black men like Skhosana have begun to appear in the corporate suites, with 
fancy titles, big desks, white secretaries -- and, sometimes, no real 
authority. Skhosana calls them "shock absorbers," hired to attract black 
customers or as a hedge against the day when a black government comes to power. 
</P>
<P>
Black executives sometimes feel caught between the white and black worlds, 
belonging to neither. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not accepted by your white colleagues because you're a radical, but 
then you go back to the ghetto and they see you as an instrument of capitalism, 
a sell-out," says Dexter Selepe, a 32-year-old black accountant with Arthur 
Anderson &amp; Co. in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough. We have to go back to our ghetto every night, back to our people, 
and contribute to the struggle," adds Selepe, who does that by teaching 
mathematics in night school in Soweto. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands solve the problem by moving illegally into white urban 
neighborhoods, where they pay exorbitant rents and risk being reported by their 
neighbors and evicted. But they often feel as if they've abandoned the struggle 
of their people and part of their cultural identity. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because I live in a white neighborhood and have lots of white friends, my 
people think that means I'm not politically interested any more," says Eric 
Mafuna, who conducts marketing surveys of black consumers for white firms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Don't Understand' 
</P>
<P>
"But they don't understand," Mafuna says. "Revolutions are never fomented by 
the masses. They are the numbers, of course. But the black middle class 
supplies the leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Thami Mazwai, an editor at the Sowetan newspaper, sends his young daughter to a 
private, multiracial school in the white suburbs of Johannesburg. He likes the 
fact that she is learning she can get better grades, and worse grades, than 
white pupils. But he's worried about the cultural implications. 
</P>
<P>
"Very few of us, no matter how strong our heritage, can claim we aren't being 
co-opted culturally," Mazwai said. "She's becoming a little white girl, and I'm 
not sure I like that." 
</P>
<P>
Skhosana's employer, South African Breweries, is a multimillion-dollar company 
that produces seven brands of beer and holds a virtual monopoly on beer sales 
in southern Africa. Its most popular product, Castle Lager, ranks seventh in 
the world in total consumption. 
</P>
<P>
The Welkom office is responsible for the northern Orange Free State, which 
consumes 21 million gallons of beer a month, and Skhosana originally was hired 
to oversee the region's black business and two black salesmen. But the company 
merged the white and black divisions in Welkom this year and appointed 
Skhosana, now 34, as director. 
</P>
<P>
When Skhosana's white supervisor, Justus Hill, announced the promotion in a 
letter to the liquor stores, restaurants and taverns in the territory, a few 
customers telephoned to complain. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want that kafir in our stalls," said one, using the derogatory word 
for blacks. But Hill told them the company had taken a stand: Blacks consume 
most of the 
</P>
<P>
beer "and that's the market we must protect." 
</P>
<P>
"People hate change here," admits Morag Williams, Skhosana's 33-year-old 
secretary. "But they're adjusting to Gideon. They can see he's capable and he's 
handling them very well. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't so long ago that it would have been infra dig to report to a black 
guy," she adds. "But people are enlightening themselves." 
</P>
<P>
That enlightenment has taken longer than Skhosana had hoped, though. The owner 
of a chain of bottle stores still refuses to have lunch with him, saying it's 
"against my principles" to eat with a black man. Another customer refused to 
shake Skhosana's extended hand at a breweries' cocktail party. 
</P>
<P>
Even inside his office, Skhosana's large oak desk doesn't protect him from the 
racial insults that are part of South Africa's social fabric. 
</P>
<P>
A white technician who came to repair an office computer recently asked the 
receptionist where he could get one of the complimentary ties that the company 
gives clients. She referred him to the white depot manager, who referred him to 
Skhosana. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happened at the breweries?" the technician complained to Skhosana. "The 
missus tells me to talk to the baas (boss) and the baas says I should talk to 
the 'boy.' " 
</P>
<P>
Skhosana shouted him out of the office and telephoned the man's company to 
complain. The next day, the technician apologized. 
</P>
<P>
Skhosana's new job made him the direct supervisor of the region's two white 
salesmen, and he wasn't sure how he should treat them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to relax with them," Skhosana says. "They might not know when I'm 
joking and when I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
One of the two had no difficulty making the transition, but the other was 
uncomfortable accepting orders from a black man, according to Skhosana's 
secretary. Six months later, Skhosana, with his supervisor's backing, fired 
both men for poor performance. He's interviewing white applicants now for the 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
As he walks the streets of Welkom, Skhosana is frequently reminded of his 
second-class status. His application to join each of the three health clubs in 
town was turned down. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't mind," one club owner assured him, Skhosana remembers. "But most of 
my clients don't like to work out with blacks." 
</P>
<P>
Apartheid is a system of exclusion, and the black middle class, raised on the 
promise of opportunity, comes to feel that exclusion most acutely. 
</P>
<P>
"The system is designed so that the middle class cannot be absorbed into it," 
says Thabo Mbeki, director of foreign affairs for the exiled African National 
Congress. "So it's inevitable that they will still be excluded, no matter how 
big their houses or paychecks." 
</P>
<P>
The day-to-day indignities, accepted as a fact of life by most working-class 
blacks in South Africa, often make Skhosana angry enough to fight back. 
</P>
<P>
A sales clerk at OK Bazaars department store, which relies heavily on the black 
trade, looked past Maureen Skhosana one day to wait on white people standing in 
line behind her. Gideon called the head of the company to complain. No apology 
was forthcoming, though. 
</P>
<P>
His secretary, Morag Williams, like most whites in South Africa, thinks blacks 
are accepted everywhere as equals. "There's no place they can't eat now," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
But only a few days earlier, the owner of J.J.'s Restaurant turned Skhosana and 
his wife away in an apologetic but firm tone: "We're not open for blacks." 
</P>
<P>
In another restaurant, Skhosana received his ice cream in a chipped bowl and 
went to the counter to ask for another. 
</P>
<P>
"No white would complain about that," he was told by the white proprietor. 
</P>
<P>
When Skhosana first moved to Welkom, he promised himself that he would avoid 
the New Lantern restaurant because its owners forced blacks to eat in their 
cars while allowing whites to use the tables. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Alternatives' 
</P>
<P>
"But sometimes, when it's 11 at night, you've got nowhere else to go," Skhosana 
says. "I don't want to go where I'm not wanted. But what frustrates me is that 
there are no alternatives. I hate for my child to see that." 
</P>
<P>
Skhosana was radicalized long before he joined the affluent middle class. 
</P>
<P>
He was born in a mud shack on a white man's farm and christened Zulu Gideon 
Theopolus Skhosana. Tofie, as he was called, lived there with his grandparents, 
his parents and five sisters. When his father refused to work on the farm, the 
landowner evicted the entire family. Tofie was 6 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The family moved to Soweto, where all three generations of Skhosanas lived 
under the roof of a four-room house, supported by his father's job at an 
appliance store in downtown Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
Tofie earned a scholarship to the Inkamana High boarding school in Natal 
province, where he led a delegation to the principal, asking that boys and 
girls be allowed to take a weekend trip together. The principal, a German nun, 
wrote his parents that Tofie was a "bad element." 
</P>
<P>
At a Mass the next year, he asked fellow students to pray for leaders of 
demonstrations in support of revolutionaries in neighboring Mozambique. He was 
summoned to the principal's office and told he could either continue to study 
at Inkamana or leave to enter politics. 
</P>
<P>
"But I want to do both," he remembers telling the nuns. 
</P>
<P>
Skhosana had his first day-to-day contact with whites while riding the train to 
school each term. 
</P>
<P>
"The (white) guards and conductors would shout at us, beat us and cram us all 
into small compartments while whites were allowed lots of space," he remembers. 
"I thought of them as slave drivers." 
</P>
<P>
But later he came to realize that "not all whites were racists," Skhosana says. 
"It's not a color issue. It's just about power." 
</P>
<P>
Skhosana went to Fort Hare University, a center of black activism, and in 1977 
helped organize a prayer meeting in memory of Steve Biko, the black 
consciousness leader who had died in police custody. Skhosana and 600 other 
students were arrested and spent two weeks in jail before being acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
After graduation, he went to work at Colgate Palmolive, where the security 
police visited the manager to suggest that a close eye be kept on the new 
employee. Skhosana moved through a series of marketing jobs, steadily improving 
his salary and position. 
</P>
<P>
Skhosana's open sympathy with the black liberation struggle, his continuing 
friendship with several political prisoners on Robben Island and his public 
defense of the banned African National Congress has often stunned his white 
co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
He had been in the breweries job about a week when a black colleague called the 
office to say his child was missing. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh God!" an office secretary exclaimed. "Maybe the ANC got him." 
</P>
<P>
"But the child's only 3 years old," Skhosana said. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think they care?" she responded. 
</P>
<P>
Skhosana raised his voice in anger. 
</P>
<P>
"They aren't animals!" he said. "They're human beings." 
</P>
<P>
(It later turned out that the child, a girl, had wandered off with friends. She 
was found later in the day.) 
</P>
<P>
While some middle-class blacks are grateful for a gradual whittling away of 
apartheid, many, like Skhosana, are increasingly impatient with the slow rate 
of change and unfulfilled promises of reform. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be willing to lose my job to have things change in this country, rather 
than quietly accept piecemeal destruction," Skhosana says. "Maybe I wouldn't 
even vote if I could. I probably wouldn't move to Ribestadt (a wealthy white 
neighborhood) and move in next to an Afrikaner, either. But the thing is to 
have the right."

Former Labor Secretary William J. Usery Jr. has been picked to mediate the 
six-month dispute between the United Mine Workers and the Pittston Coal Group, 
sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole is to formally announce her choice 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Two sources familiar with the decision, speaking on condition they not be 
identified, said that Usery, who in the last 25 years has helped settle dozens 
of bitter strikes, was Dole's choice as "supermediator" for the coal strike. 
</P>
<P>
The strike, which began April 5 in a contract dispute, has idled 1,700 miners 
in three states. 
</P>
<P>
The major issue in the strike, which affects Pittston mines in Virginia, West 
Virginia and Kentucky, is health and retirement benefits. Pittston withdrew 
last year from the Bituminous Coal Operators Assn., the national bargaining arm 
of most coal companies, because it said the group had given the miners too much 
medical coverage in its contract.

POLICY: HE COULD SET OFF ALL-OUT WAR IF HE TRIES TO SEIZE LINE-ITEM VETO POWER.

<P>
The Bush Administration demonstrated its frustration over the budget morass 
Tuesday as it sharply escalated its rhetorical battles with the Democratic 
leadership of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater accused Democrats of playing politics 
and going to "incredible lengths" to deny Bush a vote on his proposal to lower 
capital gains taxes. At the same time, Fitzwater confirmed that the 
Administration is "looking for a vehicle" to test the novel legal argument that 
Bush has the power to exercise a line-item veto over legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Even Bush supporters acknowledged that the veto strategy, if tried, would be a 
declaration of all-out war with the Democrats over budget policy. 
</P>
<P>
The escalating rhetoric on capital gains and the threatened test of a line-item 
veto are both symptoms of the ever-deepening gridlock over the nation's fiscal 
policy. For most of the year, the federal budget has operated almost on 
autopilot, and there is little likelihood of that changing soon. 
</P>
<P>
The government faces a series of deadlines for key money measures over the next 
several days, and both the Administration and the Democratic leadership are 
jockeying to assure that the other side gets blamed if those deadlines are 
missed. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an increased frustration level on all sides because this year began 
with the hope that we wouldn't come to this point," said Rep. Leon E. Panetta 
(D-Monterey), chairman of the House Budget Committee. "We've entered the macho 
period where everybody tries to talk tough." 
</P>
<P>
The tough talk from the White House on Tuesday focused on Bush's capital gains 
proposal. Democrats in the Senate have been blocking a key budget bill to 
prevent Bush's allies from using it as a vehicle for the capital gains tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
"We find it very difficult to understand that the leadership would be willing 
to hold up the entire budget of the United States to make a political point," 
Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), in return, criticized the 
Administration for pressing capital gains so hard that it now threatens to 
bring the government to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
"Capital gains has become the Holy Grail of this Administration," Mitchell 
said. In pursuit of that goal, the White House "has cast aside any concern for 
the budget deficit and now it has cast aside concern for fairness . . . (and) 
concern for relations with Congress." 
</P>
<P>
Given the already tense relations between the White House and Congress, raising 
the line-item veto issue now appears to be a calculated attempt by Bush and his 
allies to strike a tough stance. 
</P>
<P>
"I assume the reaction would be violent," with complaints from both Republicans 
and Democrats, if Bush tried the tactic, Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.) said. 
</P>
<P>
But, Domenici said, Democrats will "never" approve a measure to give Bush a 
line-item veto, so perhaps the best course would be for the President simply to 
try to take the power and let the courts sort out the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's test it," said Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), the Senate's deputy 
minority leader. "I'd like to see him try." 
</P>
<P>
Panetta, reflecting the Democratic view, said that any such move by Bush would 
be a mistake that "resurrects the image of Richard Nixon," who tried to assert 
power to block spending measures approved by Congress during his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
"They're essentially challenging the balance of powers" between the legislature 
and the executive branch, Panetta said. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, presidents have assumed that they have power only to approve a 
bill in its entirety or disapprove it, rather than approving some parts and 
vetoing others, as most state governors can do. But some conservative legal 
scholars argue that the Constitution does, in fact, allow a President to veto 
specific "line items," and Bush aides said Monday that the President had 
decided to give that theory a try if a good test case could be found. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Congress faces several budget deadlines over the next week. 
The first deadline comes today, when Congress must complete work on a 
continuing resolution needed to keep many parts of the government operating 
because most regular appropriations bills are stalled. Congress is expected to 
meet that deadline. 
</P>
<P>
A more difficult test will occur next Tuesday, when both houses must agree on a 
bill to increase the government's borrowing limit. If that bill does not pass 
on time, crucial items -- from Social Security checks to military pay -- could 
be at least temporarily stalled. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Congress and the Administration still have to agree on a bill to cut 
$12 billion from the deficit. If no agreement is reached on that bill, $16 
billion in automatic across-the-board spending cuts that took effect earlier 
this month will continue.

KRENZ GOES FROM HATED TO WAIT-AND-SEE

<TEXT>
<P>
For East German dissidents, Egon Krenz is the man they loved to hate. 
</P>
<P>
While Krenz's predecessor as national leader, Erich Honecker, was viewed as 
misguided but well-meaning, Krenz was seen as the rock-hard anti-reformer. 
</P>
<P>
After his first week in the nation's top three offices -- head of state, 
Communist Party chief and chairman of the Defense Council -- Krenz is being 
given a second look, not only by East Germans but by Western diplomatic 
observers. 
</P>
<P>
Baerbel Bohley, a founder of the opposition New Forum, says Krenz -- who at 52 
is the youngest member of the ruling Politburo -- should be given a chance to 
show what he can do. So far, what he has said and done has given rise to 
optimism in some quarters and skepticism in others. 
</P>
<P>
"His first speech was not impressive," a diplomat said, "but he has started 
seeing churchmen and workers and saying some conciliatory things. But he is 
going to be judged not by what he says but what he does." 
</P>
<P>
A 21-year-old mechanic taking part in a church vigil for arrested dissenters 
said, "He's making some good gestures, but they are only gestures, maybe just 
tactical moves to give the right impression." 
</P>
<P>
Gethsemane Church, where the vigil is taking place, is papered with statements 
from dissenters, and anyone on the steps may be questioned by agents of the 
security service. The mechanic ignored a bystander who appeared to be such an 
agent and said, "We want to see results: more travel and free elections." 
</P>
<P>
West German political figures have adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward 
Krenz, but one West German party aide said he thinks Krenz will make an effort 
to improve the relationship between the two Germanys. 
</P>
<P>
Karsten Voigt, a foreign affairs expert with the opposition Social Democratic 
Party, said in a recent conversation that he has known Krenz for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"He may surprise us," Voigt said. "He may turn out to be much more flexible and 
open than depicted." 
</P>
<P>
There does not seem to have been much flexibility in Krenz's past. For a dozen 
years, under Honecker, he was head of the state security apparatus; he was in 
charge of the electoral commission that approved what was widely regarded as 
rigged voting; he complimented the Chinese government for its crackdown on the 
pro-democracy movement last summer in Beijing, and early this month, while 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was in Berlin, Krenz ordered the police 
to break up popular demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
In private, he is reportedly less austere than his public persona. 
</P>
<P>
"His background would indicate that Krenz knows what's going on, which is more 
than you could say about Honecker," a political observer here said. "In a 
police state, the police may be the only ones who know what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts suggested that Krenz's tough background may be just what is 
needed for the introduction of much-needed political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a hard reputation, and only a hard man will lead this country out of 
its problems," a Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomat pointed out that it was conservative President Richard M. Nixon 
who made the breakthrough with Communist China, and that it was a conservative 
successor, Ronald Reagan, who came to terms with Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"People change in jobs," a West German diplomat remarked, "particularly when 
faced with the realities of life." 
</P>
<P>
How Krenz deals with East Germany's realities has become a fascinating area of 
speculation. 
</P>
<P>
"Krenz says he wants to discuss reforms," a diplomat said, "but not the 
socialist system itself. Yet it is the system itself that needs changing." 
</P>
<P>
Krenz and the party's ruling Politburo are faced with the problem of how to 
liberalize East Germany's rigid society and at the same time hold to the 
socialist ideal. Without this ideal there would be no need for a separate East 
German state, and Communist leaders admit this. 
</P>
<P>
Rolf Heinrich, another of the New Forum leaders, talked about this problem with 
a reporter. A lawyer, Heinrich was barred from practice earlier this year after 
publishing a book, "The Guardian State," that was critical of the government. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing for Krenz and his people to do is to show that things are going to 
change," Heinrich said. 
</P>
<P>
What could the government do quickly to regain public confidence? 
</P>
<P>
"First," Heinrich said, "he could restore the possibility for travel, East and 
West. Then he could declare a law for free elections. 
</P>
<P>
"Third, he could abolish political offenses as criminal acts. At a stroke of 
the pen, he could recognize opposition groups like New Forum. These would cost 
nothing. And if they are really serious, they would announce changes in the 
socialist system -- for example, that a worker would be paid more for extra 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Already, Heinrich said, "Things are moving. Last spring I was considered an 
enemy of the state. Now I am only considered useless to the state. That's an 
improvement under Krenz."

<P>
The East German Parliament on Tuesday confirmed Egon Krenz as president, but by 
an unprecedented divided vote. 
</P>
<P>
Refusing to rubber-stamp Krenz's selection last week by the Communist Party 
Central Committee, 26 of the 500 members of Parliament voted against him; 26 
others abstained. 
</P>
<P>
The no votes and abstentions came mainly from the Liberal Democratic and 
Christian Democratic parties, two small satellites of the Communist Party that 
in the past had been obedient to the wishes of the leadership. The revolt of 
the 52 was in stark contrast to the unanimous approval of Krenz's predecessor, 
Erich Honecker, in 1976 and other party leaders since the founding of the state 
in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours after the vote, more than 5,000 demonstrators marched through the 
center of East Berlin to denounce Krenz's selection. 
</P>
<P>
"Egon Krenz, we are the opposition," the demonstrators chanted. "Parliament, 
Parliament, what a terrible thing to do!" Some placards proclaimed, "Egon, your 
election doesn't count, because the people didn't elect you." Others said, "No 
Krenz, no free elections." 
</P>
<P>
The divided vote and the protest were yet other indications of the dissident 
mood sweeping East Germany. On Monday night, in several cities, there were 
massive demonstrations for political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz was elected to the post formally known as chairman of the Council of 
State, which makes him chief of state, or president. 
</P>
<P>
In his acceptance speech, Krenz, 52, appealed to young East Germans to stay in 
their country and not join the tens of thousands who in recent weeks have gone 
to the West. 
</P>
<P>
"Our homeland, your friends, your colleagues -- we all need you," he said. 
"Everyone who leaves us is one too many." 
</P>
<P>
He called for an end to the demonstrations, but promised an investigation into 
charges of police brutality in connection with demonstrations earlier this 
month, at a time when he was responsible for internal security. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he warned that the demonstrations, "even if they are well-intentioned, 
always carry in this complicated time the danger that they might not end so 
peacefully as they began." 
</P>
<P>
Krenz said the government and Parliament should operate more independently of 
the party. And he said the legal system should not discriminate against the 
60,000 or so East Germans who have fled to the West illegally this year. About 
the same number have emigrated legally. 
</P>
<P>
He did not address one of the most pressing demands of the young people, the 
abolition of restrictions on travel abroad. Instead, he appealed for public 
support in overcoming the economic and refugee crises. 
</P>
<P>
"Young and old, we must all work together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After Krenz's nomination last week by the Central Committee, about 1,000 
demonstrators held a protest march in the center of East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The police made no attempt to stop the demonstration, which took place in the 
same area where the police had violently attacked marchers a few days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Steffen Reiche, a leader of the small, newly formed Social Democratic Party, 
said Tuesday in a radio interview that the new East German government should 
separate party and state functions, as in Poland and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz, like his predecessors, is not only the head of state but also chairman 
of the National Defense Council and general secretary of the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, meanwhile, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he has offered to 
meet Krenz "if both sides deemed it meaningful." 
</P>
<P>
In another development, the official East German news agency ADN quoted a 
factory manager as denying that his workers had organized an independent labor 
union. On Monday, a spokesman for workers at the Wilhelm Pieck electronics 
plant in East Berlin said that hundreds of them had bolted the official union 
and joined a new union called Reform. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, ADN quoted the plant manager, Wolfgang Wernicke, as denying 
that any such group had been formed and saying that a single worker was behind 
the statement issued Monday.

WILL AGREE TO U.S. PEACE PLAN, ISRAEL SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: AMERICAN OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, SAY JERUSALEM IS INSISTING ON 
CONDITIONS THAT HAVE BLOCKED THE PEACE PROCESS FOR WEEKS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israel announced Tuesday that it is ready to accept "in principle" a U.S. 
Middle East peace initiative, but American officials said Israel continues to 
insist on conditions that have blocked agreement for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Embassy in Washington said Foreign Minister Moshe Arens sent 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III a "positive message . . . in which he 
expresses Israel's readiness to accept in principle Baker's five points with 
slight modification that are needed in order to make sure that Israel's 
concerns are adequately met." 
</P>
<P>
But State Department spokesman Margaret Tutwiler said Arens' letter is no 
different in substance from the almost daily telephone conversations that Baker 
and Arens have had all month. Asked if gaps remain between the U.S. and Israeli 
position, Tutwiler replied: "Absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, Israeli officials said Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who last 
week warned of a confrontation with Washington, has decided it is time to 
change his tone. In effect, Shamir is trying to position himself so that if the 
peace process breaks down, Israel will not be blamed. 
</P>
<P>
"He has decided to accentuate the positive," said Avi Pazner, Shamir's 
spokesman. "The United States and Israel agree on most things and are only 
separated on a few points." 
</P>
<P>
Baker's plan, which has not been made public in detail, is intended to foster a 
dialogue between Israel and Palestinians and to revive Shamir's own plan for 
Palestinian elections in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Baker 
offered his suggestions after Palestinian leaders made it clear that they would 
not participate in the elections under conditions proposed by Shamir last May. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Embassy said Shamir's government will accept the Baker approach if 
Israel receives assurances that it "will not be negotiating with PLO 
representatives" and that the Israeli-Palestinian dialogue will be limited to 
the election plan and will not branch off into other issues. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, the conditions do not appear to be far from the stated U.S. 
position. For instance, Tutwiler said last week that the United States will not 
try to force Israel to negotiate with the PLO. And Baker has constantly 
maintained that his only objective is to get Shamir's election plan off the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
However, there are important differences in nuance. Under the American 
interpretation, the Palestinian delegation would not operate under PLO auspices 
but would almost certainly contain some PLO members. Washington also maintains 
that if Israeli-Palestinian talks start, either side should be allowed to raise 
any issue. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials maintain that there is no chance that any prominent Palestinians 
would participate in the dialogue under Israel's interpretation of the two 
points. These officials believe -- although they admit they are not certain -- 
that representative Palestinians would take part under the American 
interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
Baker has said repeatedly that his objective is to get a peace process started. 
</P>
<P>
"But, we can't move it forward unless we can get Palestinians and Israelis 
sitting down at the same table and engaging each other in a dialogue," Baker 
said Monday in response to a question after making a speech in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Shamir visited Israeli soldiers on the Golan Heights and told them 
that the Baker plan is "still under discussion." 
</P>
<P>
"I won't give you headlines today but promise that in a few days we'll know if 
there is an agreement or not," government radio quoted him as saying.

Commonwealth nations ended their biennial meeting in discord, with Britain 
again isolated over the issue of new sanctions against South Africa. After much 
wrangling at the meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, leaders thought they had 
fashioned a compromise by endorsing those sanctions now in effect while giving 
Pretoria a grace period before any new ones. But Britain then rejected five of 
the major points of the plan.

FBI'S DIRECTOR OF ESPIONAGE CASES TO RETIRE

James H. Geer, who has headed the FBI's intelligence division during a 
four-year span in which some of the bureau's most noted espionage cases were 
developed, is retiring, an FBI spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Geer, 50, is a 25-year bureau veteran, and his decision to end his FBI career 
"comes as no surprise," said Milt Ahlerich, assistant FBI director for public 
affairs. FBI officials are required to retire by the age of 55, and many leave 
to launch second careers after reaching 50 as Geer is said to be doing. 
</P>
<P>
Ahlerich dismissed as "preposterous" an intelligence analyst's claim that 
Geer's departure signals official displeasure over the FBI's handling of the 
investigation of suspected Soviet spy Felix Bloch. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch, former second-in-command at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, has been 
suspended from his State Department post and is under intense FBI investigation 
on suspicion of turning over secret material to a Soviet agent. 
</P>
<P>
Ahlerich said Geer's decision to leave was his alone, and that he is regarded 
in the agency as "an innovator whose accomplishments are second to none." 
</P>
<P>
The intelligence analyst, who would comment only anonymously, said Geer's 
departure comes at a time of debate between the FBI and CIA over the role of 
counterintelligence and which agency is best handling the assignment. 
</P>
<P>
The analyst said the Bloch case "fell between the cracks" of the FBI and CIA 
operations. But Ahlerich said Geer had a significant role in establishing 
closer ties and more effective cooperation between the two agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Geer's deputy assistant director, Gary Penrith, also is leaving the division to 
become head of the FBI's Newark, N.J., field office. 
</P>
<P>
No successors have been chosen, Ahlerich said. 
</P>
<P>
Geer has headed the FBI's intelligence division since 1985. The targets of 
successful counterintelligence investigations during the four-year period 
include an espionage ring headed by John Walker, former National Security 
Agency spy Ronald Pelton and Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard.

The National Park Service will not allow commercial timber hauling through 
Yellowstone Park, despite a request by the U.S. Forest Service. Parks Director 
James Ridenour denied the request as environmentalists labled the decision the 
first big test of Ridenour's willingness to protect the parks from commercial 
assault. Ridenour was concerned that a lumber company's plan to transport about 
20,000 truckloads of logs through the park would have adverse impacts on 
important grizzly bear, elk and bison habitats as well as roadways, said a 
spokesman. The timber to have been hauled is from trees partially burned by 
fires in the park last year.

METHANE DETECTED AT SITE OF MINE BLAST, INSPECTOR TESTIFIES

Workers detected high levels of methane at the William Station Mine four days 
before an explosion there killed 10 men, a state inspector testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The air was 6% methane in one section of the mine when tested Sept. 9, but the 
high level of gas alone does not explain the blast, said Billy Smith, an 
inspector for the Kentucky Department of Mines and Minerals. 
</P>
<P>
"You had a 6% level on Saturday before the explosion," Smith said. "That is an 
explosive level and it didn't explode. You've got to have an ignition source." 
</P>
<P>
Workers adjusted fireproof curtains to allow more air into the mine, assigned a 
miner to monitor the methane level while they worked, and warned incoming crews 
of the high gas levels before the blast, Smith said at a state hearing on the 
Sept. 13 explosion, the worst U.S. mining disaster since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Methane is considered explosive in levels of from 5% to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Workers in the section of the mine where the blast occurred were dismantling a 
longwall mining machine. Mining in that area had been completed Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Siler, president of Pyro Mining Co., the mine owner, said officials did not 
learn until after the explosion of the high methane reading.

The Agriculture Department has barred the use of an American Heart Assn. seal 
of approval on any food product containing meat or poultry, the heart 
association said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Although we share the desire to provide information to consumers that enables 
them to make informed food choices, we are unable to approve this labeling 
program," said Lester Crawford, who heads the department's Food Safety and 
Inspection Service, in a letter made public by the heart association. 
</P>
<P>
The association has said it plans to test several hundred foods and allow its 
HeartGuide seal to appear only on those low in cholesterol, fat and sodium. The 
seal is to begin appearing on non-meat groceries in February.

EARTHQUAKE: SOME SCHOOL OFFICIALS ARE STILL ASSESSING THE DAMAGE AND OTHERS ARE

<TEXT>
<P>
Eighty-three years ago, Stanford University President David Starr Jordan wrote 
that his earthquake-battered university "is clearing away the fallen stones and 
restoring the torn walls, and her classrooms will be open . . . as though 
nothing had happened." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, much as Jordan vowed in New San Francisco magazine to replace the 
15-year-old campus ravaged by the 1906 quake, Stanford officials counted their 
blessings and got the university fully back to work after suffering $160 
million damage in last week's temblor. 
</P>
<P>
During a campus news conference, President Donald Kennedy said 25 of about 400 
buildings on the sprawling campus had to be closed entirely or placed under 
limited access. But there were no deaths or serious injuries, and classes began 
resuming last Thursday, just two days after the quake struck on Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
"That was not an easy decision to make," Kennedy told the university's 13,000 
students during a campus radio broadcast the night before the reopening. "But 
the Stanford way is to go for it if you can." 
</P>
<P>
As Stanford announced all classes and research projects were back on track, 
most of the scores of other colleges and universities in the Bay Area reported 
operations were normal -- or nearly so -- one week to the day after the 7.1 
quake struck from beneath the mountains near Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
While townspeople in hard-hit Santa Cruz and Watsonville tried to cope with the 
damage to residential neighborhoods and the historic downtowns, the wooded 
campus of UC Santa Cruz bore few scars. Only a science building suffered 
serious structural damage, and two libraries and the women's center remained 
closed after classes resumed on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"To a great extent, things are as back to normal as they can be," university 
spokesman Jim Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Robert Stevens said a preliminary survey put the 
damage at $12 million, with another $6 million required to further improve 
seismic safety and communications. The university was completely cut off for 
several hours after the quake, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its proximity to the quake's epicenter, San Jose State University 
suffered no major structural damage to its main campus. After working through 
the weekend to pick up thousands of books that had tumbled from shelves, 
officials reopened campus libraries on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
All classrooms are usable. Nonetheless, there was about $1.7 million in damage, 
a university spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the East Bay, UC Berkeley had little damage or disruption. A few miles away, 
in the Oakland hills, administrators of the venerable Mills College spent 
Tuesday moving their offices out of an 1871 building "as a precaution." 
</P>
<P>
Across the bay, officials of San Francisco State University scrambled to find 
other quarters for the 700 students displaced by water line problems in one of 
its dorms, Verducci Hall. The dorm is not expected to reopen until after 
Thanksgiving weekend, university spokeswoman Janet Kraut said. 
</P>
<P>
While classes resumed Monday, the library will remain closed for a while. 
"Please do not return currently due library books until Nov. 1," said a memo 
distributed to students this week. Officials were trying to line up borrowing 
privileges at neighboring universities and set up other study centers. 
</P>
<P>
While just three minor injuries occurred on campus, Kraut said there has been 
"a lot of counseling" for those traumatized by the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
At the private University of San Francisco, officials were marveling at their 
good luck. "We had a couple of cracked stairways and we lost a couple of dorm 
windows, and we're checking for damage to the ornate interior of St. Ignatius 
(the campus church), but we have our own co-generator, so we even had heat and 
power on Tuesday night," a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
UC San Francisco endured just "superficial" damage, according to UC spokesman 
Rick Malaspina. Total damage at the three UC campuses affected by the quake -- 
Berkeley, San Francisco and Santa Cruz -- was estimated to be $30 to $40 
million, about half of that at Santa Cruz, Malaspina said. The UC system, which 
is self-insured for such disasters, will also apply for federal and state 
disaster relief funds to cover the cost of repairs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal and state aid will also be requested by the State University and 
College system, which estimates a total of $45 million in damage to San 
Francisco, San Jose and Hayward campuses and by the California Community 
Colleges system, which has not yet compiled estimates from all 26 of the 
campuses affected. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Reed, vice chancellor for public affairs for the community colleges, said 
most of the affected schools were reopened within 24 hours of the quake. Only 
two remain closed, City College of San Francisco and Cabrillo College in Aptos, 
and they intend to reopen by the end of this week, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"We were surprised and astounded that we sustained no catastrophic damage at 
any of the colleges," Reed said. "While perhaps the damage was substantial in 
terms of dollars, it was not life-threatening. We had no serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"That put it all into wonderful perspective for us." 
</P>
<P>
Similar sentiments were echoed Tuesday by Stanford's Kennedy, who noted the 
lack of serious injuries meant "a lot of people were put through worrying when 
they didn't need to be." 
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged that the cost in damaged buildings was staggering, saying 
it is too soon to determine how the university will pay to rebuild or replace 
them. The university does not have earthquake insurance, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Among those heavily damaged are Memorial Church -- the crown jewel of the 
campus, also destroyed in the 1906 quake, the Stanford Museum, the Graduate 
School of Business building, the main library's west wing and rotunda and a 
vacant chemistry building that had been condemned three years ago. It has not 
yet been determined what can be saved, Kennedy said.

SALCIDO PLEADS INNOCENT TO MURDER

Winery worker Ramon Salcido pleaded innocent to murdering his wife, two 
daughters and four others. In a brief appearance before Sonoma County Superior 
Court Judge J. Brian Jamar in Santa Rosa, Salcido's trial was tentatively set 
to begin Jan. 30. He could be sentenced to death if convicted. Salcido, 28, was 
arrested in his native Mexico several days after the April 14 killings. Public 
Defender Marteen Miller said he needed more time to prepare and will probably 
ask for a delay in the trial. Among other things, Miller said, he is preparing 
motions to move the trial to another county because of news coverage; to 
challenge the voluntariness of Salcido's reported confession in Mexico, and to 
argue that the U.S.-Mexico extradition treaty forbids a death sentence. Salcido 
is charged with murdering his wife, Angela; two of their three daughters; his 
wife's mother; two of his wife's sisters, and a winery co-worker. A third 
daughter, Carmina, 3, had her throat slashed but survived.

SHE CAN CHOOSE THE JAIL BUT NOT THE WARDROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If convicted cop-slapper Zsa Zsa Gabor opts for jail in America instead of a 
castle in Germany, she can expect to receive a simple, light blue dress and a 
room without a view. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolute total boredom" is what awaits the former Miss Hungary, according to 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Joseph Surgent, acting captain of the Sybil 
Brand Institute, the women's jail in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor was sentenced Tuesday to 72 hours of incarceration for striking a Beverly 
Hills police officer. 
</P>
<P>
But she and her husband, Prince Frederick von Anhalt of West Germany, had 
indicated that a jail sentence might prompt them to move to one of their 
estates in the European nation. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills Municipal Judge Charles G. Rubin gave Gabor the option of serving 
time in any jail in the county, meaning that she may choose a small, municipal 
jail rather than Sybil Brand. The courts provide the option as a way of easing 
overcrowding in county facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that it makes a great deal of difference where she goes," Dist. 
Atty. Ira Reiner said. "Jail is jail, and when you hear that slammer close 
behind you, it's really all the same." 
</P>
<P>
If Gabor, reportedly 66, does choose Sybil Brand, Surgent said he could assure 
her that she will not encounter lesbians -- a fear the actress expressed during 
her trial. 
</P>
<P>
Because of her notoriety, Gabor will be segregated from other inmates for her 
own protection, the jail official said. 
</P>
<P>
"She is not going to walk a foot out of her cell where she will not be escorted 
by a deputy," Surgent said. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of Brand's 2,047 inmates sleep in bunk beds in overcrowded, 
barracks-style facilities, the segregation of Gabor should not be considered 
"special treatment," Surgent said. 
</P>
<P>
Inmates who are celebrities, political figures or law enforcement personnel -- 
or inmates who are close relatives of celebrities, political figures or law 
enforcement personnel -- are routinely segregated from the general jail 
population as a safety precaution, the lieutenant said. 
</P>
<P>
All female inmates in Los Angeles County are booked at Sybil Brand before being 
jailed there or in the county's Mira Loma facility in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Loma "does not have housing for high-profile inmates who need to be 
segregated for their own security," said Sheriff's Lt. Diana Corrington at the 
Lancaster jail. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Gabor chooses a county jail or a city jail, she will pay for the cost 
of her incarceration, Reiner said. 
</P>
<P>
Like other inmates at Sybil Brand, Surgent said, Gabor would undergo a "pat 
down" search for weapons or contraband. She would be issued blue jail garb. 
</P>
<P>
While her paper work was processed, she would be placed in an 8-by-10-foot 
holding tank furnished with only a bench and a toilet. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Surgent said, Gabor would be escorted to a segregation cell. 
</P>
<P>
The last celebrity accorded such treatment was television personality Cynthia 
Garvey, who was jailed briefly earlier this month for contempt of court in a 
child-custody battle with her ex-husband, former baseball star Steve Garvey.

The filing period in the 27th Assembly District ended with five Democrats and 
three Republicans vying for the seat that represents residents of Stanislaus 
and Merced counties. If no one gets a majority in the Dec. 5 election, a runoff 
vote will be held Jan. 30 for the seat left vacant when Gary Condit was elected 
to Congress last month. Republican candidates are Modesto Mayor Carol 
Whiteside, former Waterford City Councilman Zane Johnston and Modesto City 
Councilman Dick Lang, who has won the backing of the party and Gov. George 
Deukmejian. Democratic hopefuls are Stanislaus County Supervisors Sal Canella 
and Pat Paul, county Democratic Central Committee Chairman John Lazar, teacher 
Carmen Sabatino and former Condit aide Peggy Crowther.

DINKINS LEAD SLIPS IN RACE FOR N.Y. MAYOR, POLLS SHOW; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE MARGINS VARY, BUT SURVEYS AGREE THAT RECENT CONTROVERSIES SEEM TO 
HAVE HURT THE DEMOCRAT'S CAMPAIGN.

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Contrasting polls showed the lead of Democratic mayoral candidate David N. 
Dinkins to be slipping Tuesday, but the degree to which his margin was eroding 
remained in question. 
</P>
<P>
A Daily News-WABC-TV survey showed that Dinkins had plummeted from 19 points 
ahead of his Republican rival Rudolph W. Giuliani to a four-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
But a New York Observer poll showed Dinkins with a 20-point lead. A poll by 
that weekly newspaper earlier this month reported the Democratic contender with 
a 33-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the discrepancy, both polls may be a reflection of the most recent 10 
days of Dinkins' campaign to become New York City's first black mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins, the Manhattan borough president, has been forced to deal with 
controversies over the true value of a stock gift he made to his son, and his 
campaign's payment of $9,500 to a community activist who was once convicted on 
a kidnaping charge and who organized a demonstration last month that ended in 
battles with police. 
</P>
<P>
When Sonny Carson, the activist, called a news conference last week to explain 
that the funds were designed to help get out the vote on primary day, he also 
denied being anti-Semitic. "I'm anti-white," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins then denounced Carson and said that had such comments come to his 
attention, Carson would never have played any role in his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
New York's heated mayoral campaign also echoed in the financial marketplace on 
Tuesday. Moody's Investors Service, which rates the city's bonds, warned that 
unless New York's next mayor has a detailed plan to deal with a projected 
budget gap, his new administration "will face the prospect of a weakening 
credit outlook." 
</P>
<P>
Moody's criticized both Dinkins and Giuliani for failing to come up with such a 
plan. New York faces a $528-million budget gap for the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Some political analysts said that in such an economic climate, questions about 
Dinkins' finances have become magnified -- and are reflected in polls. Dinkins, 
who did not pay income taxes for four years two decades ago, has been 
scrutinized recently on a stock transaction with his son that may have skirted 
a capital gains tax bite. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, in a form he filed, Dinkins valued the stock at more than $1 million. 
But the same year, in another form, he valued the stock at $20,000 to $60,000. 
He transferred the stock in January, 1986, to his son for a $58,000 promissory 
note due in 1991, with interest. 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins said the million-dollar figure was given to him by the chairman of the 
non-publicly traded company and the price he charged his son was close to the 
price the company had offered to redeem its shares during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily News poll reported that 34% of voters were less likely to vote for 
Dinkins because of the new reports about his finances. The poll showed major 
defections among Jewish voters, white liberals and independents. 
</P>
<P>
Some politicians and polling experts Tuesday questioned the Daily News-WABC-TV 
survey for its relatively small sample of 501 registered voters and the fact it 
was taken during just one day. The poll had a 5% margin of error. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts pointed out the ripples from the Daily News poll may be more 
meaningful than the numbers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Post headline on Tuesday: "Dinkins Sinkin'."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 WOUNDED IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING AT GAS STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Los Angeles men were shot and wounded Tuesday morning in a gang-related 
drive-by shooting in front of a Westchester gas station near the intersection 
of Sepulveda Boulevard and Manchester Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Johnson Jr., 20, and Troy Kimble, 19, were walking along Sepulveda 
Boulevard about 10:50 a.m. when two men in a white car pulled up and yelled, 
"This is Rolling 60s," the name of a Los Angeles gang, said Lt. Ron Dena of the 
Los Angeles Police Department's anti-gang unit. 
</P>
<P>
As the pair tried to run to the Unocal 76 station, Kimble was shot once and 
Johnson suffered multiple gunshot wounds, according to Lt. Ron Moen of the 
LAPD's Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was in critical but stable condition after surgery at UCLA Medical 
Center, Moen said. Kimble was in good condition at Daniel Freeman-Marina 
Hospital with a gunshot wound in the thigh, said a hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Following the shooting, the assailants sped south on Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the victims told police that they were shot in a robbery attempt as 
they stood at a bus stop in front of the gas station, according to Moen. The 
men also told police that Johnson was in the area job-hunting and that Kimble, 
a friend, had accompanied him. 
</P>
<P>
"They later changed their story," Moen said. "Now, I don't know what they were 
doing over there." 
</P>
<P>
The manager of the gas station, who witnessed the shooting, said Kimble told 
him and other attendants that the assailants were gang members from nearby 
Westchester High School.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROUND-THE-CLOCK TALKS URGED IN TEACHERS 
STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Petitions containing more than 900 signatures from parents and other residents 
urging the Beverly Hills school board to begin round-the-clock talks with 
striking teachers were delivered to district headquarters Tuesday afternoon, 
according to a newly formed parents group. 
</P>
<P>
The group, called Children First, began circulating the petitions Friday night. 
The petitions also ask the board to "explore creative financial alternatives" 
to provide raises for the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on Day 7 of the strike, attendance appeared to be stabilizing. 
Districtwide, it was at 58% Tuesday, down slightly from Monday's 60% but up 
from the 43% of last week. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, about 170 Beverly Hills teachers, many dressed in black, 
marched outside Hawthorne School to protest what they said were the autocratic 
and anti-union policies of the principal there. The teachers union had filed a 
charge with the Public Employment Relations Board, accusing Principal Ann 
Picker of undermining the union and of harassing union representative at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
The employment relations board is investigating the case, board attorney Tom 
Allen said. He said the charge is not directly connected to the strike over 
wages and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Picker has declined to comment on the union's charge, referring inquiries to 
Supt. Robert French. On Tuesday, French reiterated his support of Picker. He 
said the case is a personnel matter and that it is "totally improper" for the 
union to bring it up during the strike. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers are demanding an 18% salary increase over two years. The district says 
it can afford only 11%.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'CHEERS' ACTOR TO REQUEST COUNSELING IN DRUG 
CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kelsey Grammer, a star of the long-running television show "Cheers" who faces a 
cocaine possession charge, is scheduled to appear in Van Nuys Municipal Court 
on Thursday to request placement in a drug abuse education program instead of a 
jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer, 34, who plays Dr. Frasier Crane, the comically egotistical 
psychiatrist on the popular NBC series, was charged with one felony count of 
possession of cocaine after his arrest April 14. Los Angeles police said he 
tried to dispose of about a quarter-gram of cocaine following his arrest for 
driving without a valid license and with expired license plate tags, and on a 
warrant from a previous speeding citation. 
</P>
<P>
The actor is seeking the court's permission to attend the drug abuse education 
program, which is offered to people charged with first-time felony drug 
offenses, said Rion O'Brien, a Van Nuys Municipal Court clerk. If he 
successfully completes the program, which lasts several months, Grammer would 
be eligible to have the cocaine possession case dismissed and the arrest 
cleared from his record after six months, O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
The cocaine charge would otherwise carry a maximum sentence of three years in 
jail, but the sentence on a first offense is typically three to six months, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrew W. Diamond.

19 COLLECT SHARES OF THE COUNTY'S $36,777 REWARD FUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors meted out shares Tuesday of a 
$36,777 bounty for the capture of convicted Night Stalker killer Richard 
Ramirez, paying rewards ranging from $250 to $10,388 to 19 people. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the largest sum will go to Jesse N. Perez, 65, of Los 
Angeles. Perez is a one-time acquaintance of Ramirez, who was convicted Sept. 
20 of 13 murders and faces death in the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Yochelson said Perez led police to the recovery of a 
murder weapon used to help convict the Night Stalker defendant. Perez's 
daughter, Pauline, who persuaded her father to call the police, will receive 
$3,250. 
</P>
<P>
"My father didn't do it for the money," Pauline Perez said Tuesday night at the 
family's home. "He requested that any reward money be given to me. It will go 
into the bank for something we really need. 
</P>
<P>
"We never gave much thought to what we would do with a reward. People shouldn't 
think about spending money when they don't have any idea of what they are going 
to get." 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Perez said he still feels there is some question about his own safety. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just glad that there was a stop to the killing and I don't want to bring a 
lot of attention to myself," he said. "I don't want people to think I'm 
bragging about all this. I was doing it because I wanted to help the people in 
California stop all the killings. He had to be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
Of the $36,777 to be paid by the county, most was contributed by corporations 
and individuals. It is part of about $80,000 offered by various jurisdictions 
and the governor's office for the Night Stalker's arrest and conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"We assigned the monies in proportion to how important a person's information 
was in leading to the identification, arrest and conviction" of the Night 
Stalker, said Georgette Dewyer, deputy executive officer to the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Citing privacy statutes, county officials declined to give addresses and other 
specific information about those who won rewards. Times sources provided the 
identification of some of the people issued awards. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Ochoa, an unemployed truck driver from Lompoc, will receive $2,500 for 
tipping off police to the possibility that Ramirez was the Night Stalker. 
"That's great," she said after hearing about the reward, adding: "It really 
helps. I'm out of work." 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa said her brother, Earl Gregg Jr., also of Lompoc, and Ramirez were once 
roommates. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked at composites," she said, "and the more we talked, the more we 
decided it was Rick." She said her brother and his wife turned over to police a 
bracelet from Ramirez that was linked to one of the Stalker's crimes. Gregg and 
his wife, Deleen, will also receive $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
Alejandro Espinoza, who will receive $6,338, was awarded his share of the 
reward for assisting police in the recovery of property taken from the homes of 
murder victims, Yochelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Rewards of $1,000 each will go to eight East Los Angeles residents who, in 
August, 1985, helped subdue Ramirez and held him until police arrived. They 
include Carmelo Robles, Frank Moreno and Faustino Pinon, three of the people 
who gave chase as Ramirez made a desperate -- and futile -- bid to outrun 
pursuers after Robles spotted Ramirez's picture on the front page of a 
newspaper in a Boyle Heights liquor store. 
</P>
<P>
Also receiving $1,000 is James Romero, a 13-year-old Orange County boy who in 
1985 got a partial license number of a car believed used in several of the 
Stalker's attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Others receiving shares of the reward are Manuel De La Torre; Jose Burgion and 
his sons, Jaime and Julio; Ken Will; Edgardo Molinar; Elena Salter; Arturo 
Benavidez; Paul Wallace, and Donna L. Myers.

TEMPORARY BAN UPHELD ON SCHOOLBOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hacienda La Puente Unified School District Board of Education early Tuesday 
upheld a temporary ban on reading books that sparked a debate about morbid 
imagery but agreed to reprint and keep teaching some less controversial stories 
and poems while it evaluates the entire series. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise, reached after more than five hours of heated discussion, failed 
to appease many of the 500 people who squeezed into the Cedarlane Junior High 
School auditorium in Hacienda Heights. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to terminate the whole series," said Denise Hill, who took her 
8-year-old daughter Daphne out of class this week and will enroll her in 
private school. "We won't be satisfied with them removing just a portion of the 
books. There are still stories about magic." 
</P>
<P>
On the other side were parents like Mark A. Peterson, who warned that the 
hysteria could lead to book-burning. "What is involved is a basic attack on the 
liberties of all of us in this country," he said. "If we object to these 
stories, the next step is to attack and remove other stories which have been 
told in Western society for generations." 
</P>
<P>
The debate focuses around "Impressions," a series of literature-based reading 
books published by Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston of Canada Ltd. and used in 
first through sixth grades. Protests have already been mounted in several 
Oregon and Washington communities where religious activists have claimed that 
the series promotes witchcraft and magic. 
</P>
<P>
The books have also raised issues about conflicts between First Amendment 
rights and parents' rights to censor what their children read. Not all the 
selections in the "Impressions" series are considered objectionable; some are 
classics like William Farley's "The Black Stallion." 
</P>
<P>
School administrators defend the series as a whole, however, and blame the 
protests on a group of parents with strong religious beliefs who have inflamed 
others in the district, which has 22,295 students from La Puente, Hacienda 
Heights, Industry and Valinda. 
</P>
<P>
School officials also say that some of the controversial stories had been 
removed from a revised edition they reviewed and approved earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, officials approved books that contained the standard "Twelve Days 
of Christmas" but got instead in one of the books a version with "a wart snake 
in a fig tree." 
</P>
<P>
"An honest mistake was made," said Irv Rem, the assistant superintendent for 
instructional services who said the textbook series cost $378,000. "The books 
my board received to review were not the edition of books that were shipped." 
</P>
<P>
Parents responded with cries of "Send them back! Let's get our money back!" 
They also threatened to picket the district, take their children out of school 
for a day and vote out school board members.

WHITTIER'S LANDLORDS STILL FEELING THE AFTERSHOCKS; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: A HIGH VACANCY RATE PLAGUES UPTOWN'S BUSINESS DISTRICT TWO YEARS AFTER 
THE EARTHQUAKE.

Repairing his commercial building in Uptown Whittier after it was damaged in 
the Oct. 1, 1987, earthquake was easy compared to what Robert Klein says he is 
going through now. 
</P>
<P>
Klein and scores of other landlords in Whittier's Uptown business district say 
they are struggling to find merchants to move into the buildings they spent 
thousands of dollars to rebuild after the 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured that once I rebuilt it, I would have no trouble renting it. I never 
had before," Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
Not so. The 10,000-square-foot building, like many others in the area, is 50% 
vacant. 
</P>
<P>
The unusually high vacancy rate, landlords and city officials say, is primarily 
due to expansions of some of the reconstructed buildings, rent increases to 
help pay for costly earthquake repairs and new city restrictions on the types 
of tenants that can locate on the ground floors. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, there is more commercial space available than ever before in the 
Uptown area, which serves as the city's downtown business district. Before the 
earthquake, there were few vacancies in commercial or office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Despite vacancies in 43 buildings, another half a dozen retail and office 
buildings destroyed in the quake are scheduled to be rebuilt in the Uptown 
area, according to Planning Commission President Larry Haendiges. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem, landlords say, is that they were forced to nearly double 
monthly rents to pay for loans to make earthquake repairs. Before the quake, 
space in the Uptown area rented for an average of about 50 cents a square foot, 
relatively cheap for the Los Angeles area. As a result, the Uptown district, 
made up of older, unreinforced brick buildings, had been surviving with small 
businesses on shoestring budgets. 
</P>
<P>
After many of the older buildings were reduced to rubble, 10% of the small 
businesses went under. Some of the businesses could not get loans to keep 
going, while some tenants could not afford the increased rents. 
</P>
<P>
"The mom-and-pop renters were squeezed out," Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
The city in June approved a redevelopment plan that prohibits certain 
non-retail businesses, like accounting and law firms, from locating on the 
first floor in the Uptown business area. City officials say they want to 
maintain shops on the ground level, where people can walk from store to store. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said two accountants have approached him, asking if they can rent the 
3,000-square-foot space on the first floor of his building. He had to say no. 
It was like throwing money away, Klein said, adding that he barely makes enough 
money in rent to cover the $2,000 monthly payment for his earthquake repair 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm angry and I'm frustrated," Klein said. "They (the city) encouraged us to 
stay and rebuild after the quake." 
</P>
<P>
They ought to make allowances for the ones who stayed, Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Victor Lopez agrees that the non-retail businesses should be allowed in. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten ourselves against a wall, and we can't get out of it," Lopez said 
at a recent City Council meeting. "It's a mess." 
</P>
<P>
But the consensus of other council members is to stick with the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe we should give the plan a chance," Councilman Gene Chandler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Haendiges, also president of the Whittier Uptown Assn., said the association 
hopes to attract tenants by aggressively marketing the area. He has gained city 
approval to hire an outside firm to come up with and implement a marketing 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The landlords all want quality tenants and they want (their buildings) filled 
right now, and we share that goal," Haendiges said. 
</P>
<P>
Calling Uptown one of the city's best-kept secrets, he said officials need to 
better publicize the area. "Marketing is the No. 1 issue right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But many of the businesses in Uptown are doing better than ever, Haendiges 
said. According to the city comptroller's office, sales tax revenues in the 
area are up. 
</P>
<P>
The high vacancy rate will soon pass, many officials say. It is just another 
hurdle Whittier must overcome in the lengthy process of recovering from the 
earthquake, they say. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, "For Rent" signs appear in many store windows. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Theisen, an Uptown landlord, said he is concerned that problems will force 
some owners to go under. Theisen added an extra floor when he rebuilt his 
building but now has an occupancy rate of about 50%. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of square footage out there," he said. "And the marketing plan 
will take time to take effect. It may be too late for some. 
</P>
<P>
"They encouraged us to rebuild. Now it's too late to go back."

BOY, 12, TO BE CHARGED IN FIRING OF FATAL SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors decided Tuesday to charge a 12-year-old Antelope Valley boy in the 
shooting death of his 10-year-old playmate. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Michelle Rosenblatt said the type and degree of homicide 
alleged will not be determined until Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives 
finish investigating the Sunday afternoon slaying of Thomas Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenblatt said that in some cases of accidental death, prosecutors have the 
option of declining to file charges. But in this case, she said, "We have 
established that the elements of a homicide exist." 
</P>
<P>
Once the investigation is complete, Rosenblatt said, the charge will specify 
one of four possible homicide offenses: first-degree murder, second-degree 
murder, voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
She said the focus of the investigation "relates to the intent of the 
perpetrator. It relates to state of mind." 
</P>
<P>
While Rosenblatt declined to be more specific, a sheriff's deputy on Monday 
said the boy was being held on suspicion of murder because "he committed an 
inherently dangerously act" by pulling back the hammer and aiming the shotgun 
at Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez died instantly after being hit in the head by a shotgun blast, 
detectives said. The 12-year-old suspect had been staying with a friend while 
his parents were out of town, but he, the friend and Hernandez entered the 
house through a window. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside, the 12-year-old picked up the shotgun in his parents' bedroom, 
cocked it and aimed it at Hernandez, according to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have declined to say whether the boys were playing with the gun or 
whether there was a fight or argument before the shooting in the semi-rural 
community of Pearblossom. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect is being held at Sylmar Juvenile Hall and will be arraigned today. 
Under the rules of juvenile procedure, the boy's lawyer will either admit or 
deny the petition filed by the district attorney's office, the equivalent of an 
adult pleading guilty or not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
If a minor denies the petition, the case goes to trial before a judge. If a 
minor admits the petition, a judge renders a disposition. 
</P>
<P>
The range of possible sentences for a minor involved in a homicide includes 
probation, placement in supervised custody such as a boys' home or the home of 
a relative, detention in a probation department youth camp or incarceration in 
a California Youth Authority facility. 
</P>
<P>
At today's hearing, the judge will have the option of deciding whether the boy 
should remain in detention or be released into the custody of parents or 
relatives, Rosenblatt said. That decision is based on arguments by lawyers and 
criteria including the conditions at a minor's home and whether the minor is 
considered dangerous or needs the court's protection, Rosenblatt said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors and detectives are reluctant to discuss details in the Hernandez 
case because of confidentiality rules governing juvenile cases and because of 
the boy's age. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had years of experience with murders, but this is all kind of new to 
us," said Detective Gil Carillo, a veteran Sheriff's Department homicide 
investigator. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, a 10-year-old girl who admitted strangling an infant she was 
baby-sitting, became the youngest person to face the charge of murder in Los 
Angeles County. She was charged with second-degree murder and sentenced to an 
indefinite period of time at a psychiatric facility.

A woman died of a head wound Tuesday after delivery of her baby, hours after 
she and her husband had been abducted, robbed and shot by someone who 
apparently thought they were police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Stuart, 33, a lawyer, died after the baby boy was delivered one month 
prematurely by Cesarean section, the hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that the gunman, who had forced his way into their car, apparently 
thought the Stuarts were police officers because of the celluar phone in the 
car. According to officers, the gunman said: "I think you're five-o," slang for 
police. There are no suspects. Stuart is in serious condition.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: THERE'S MORE TO NEWS THAN A HOUSEHOLD NAME; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: CONNIE CHUNG'S SATURDAY SHOW DEMONSTRATES THE GROWING STATUS OF 
NEWSCASTERS.

Are the stars out tonight? 
</P>
<P>
"PrimeTime Live" with Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer on ABC gets bigger 
headlines, but "Saturday Night With Connie Chung" on CBS is the new prime-time 
news series delivering the biggest performances. 
</P>
<P>
Rarely have the values of news and entertainment been so artfully merged, and 
with such rewarding results. On a sour note, rarely has the importance that TV 
news attaches to its own stars been more dramatically on display as well. The 
past and future of TV news -- the messenger and message system increasingly 
eclipsing the message -- merge here too. 
</P>
<P>
"Saturday Night With Connie Chung" is an enjoyable show, so you applaud -- but 
uneasily. 
</P>
<P>
Although near the bottom of the ratings, the successor to "West 57th" has 
largely been a program not to be missed, topped by last Saturday's bewitching 
and profoundly moving segment on Terry Anderson, the longest held of the 
Western hostages in the Mideast. First came a capsule docudrama depicting the 
agonies of Anderson in captivity, followed by a Chung-moderated discussion with 
former hostages David P. Jacobsen and Father Lawrence M. Jenco; Anderson's 
sister, Peggy Say, and former Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
The series premiered Sept. 23 in similar style -- a panel discussion following 
a dramatic re-creation -- with James Earl Jones giving a stirring performance 
as civil rights pioneer Vernon Johns of Montgomery, Ala. It was bracing 
television, as was much of Chung's recent interview with Marlon Brando. 
</P>
<P>
The Brando interview was fascinating in that it embodied at once the best and 
worst of this series. 
</P>
<P>
His bluntness, combativeness, high standing as an actor, passion for social 
causes and media skepticism promised to make Brando a challenging and 
captivating interview subject. And he didn't disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
Everything went extremely well, with Chung asking some pointed questions and 
wisely giving Brando almost the entire stage. But then, inevitably -- Chung's 
name isn't in the title for nothing -- the interview dissolved into a joint 
performance. Chung's cutaways seemed to grow longer and the camera shots of 
Brando and her together more frequent, until the two of them became an act, a 
duet, two celebrities in front of the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Walters could not have executed it more self-servingly. Well, perhaps 
just a shade more, for Chung didn't sing or tap dance, and her modus operandi 
was the giggle, not the melodramatic pause and lowered gaze. 
</P>
<P>
"Saturday Night With Connie Chung" also renews the debate over news 
division-produced programs potentially confusing viewers by stirring 
re-creations and reality in the same pot. There's peril in giving substance and 
credibility to skillful re-enactments, as this program does, by making them the 
basis for ensuing discussions of the topics being depicted. And peril in using 
-- as the program did in a riveting piece on the December's crash of Pan Am 
Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland -- both actual home-movie footage of a 
victim and "reconstructions of the investigators' own theories" on how the 
terrorists' bomb may have been brought aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Yet such programs as Chung's and "PrimeTime Live" (which does not use 
re-enactments) reflect something far more intrinsic to TV news and something 
just as incongruous with its avowed mission to inform the public. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, the host of "Saturday Night With Connie Chung" is the 
epitome of the journalist as star, and stars tend to outshine everything in 
their presence. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, you're right. In a sense, this is old news: Edward R. Murrow was a star. 
Huntley and Brinkley were stars. Walter Cronkite was a star. "60 Minutes" was 
predicated on its correspondents becoming the stars of their stories. And so on 
and so on. 
</P>
<P>
But times are changing. The number of news stars seems to be increasing even as 
the link between stardom and competence seems to be diminishing. TV news 
people, on both the network and local level, are increasingly promoted to us as 
personalities, and we are tuning in to them because of their personalities. No 
one should watch a newscast because of the messenger's attractiveness, but -- 
shame on us -- that's exactly what we do. 
</P>
<P>
Chung's exodus from NBC to CBS was widely regarded as a devastating loss for 
the former and an enormous coup for the latter because she was widely regarded 
as a valuable property and rising star. That was not because of anything she 
had accomplished journalistically, but because of some undefined star quality. 
</P>
<P>
There are surely lesser interviewers and journalists on the air than Chung, who 
also anchors the Sunday evening news, has a nice personality and is very 
likable. But her name in the title? Please, give us a break. As it turns out, 
"Saturday Night With Connie Chung" works best without much Connie Chung. 
Attribute that to the good producers who do the work behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
What makes a news star? 
</P>
<P>
Chung is a journalism dean compared with Deborah Norville, who was on the list 
of NBC News "stars" cited last spring by division president Michael Gartner. It 
is Norville who recently replaced veteran correspondent and non-star John 
Palmer as news anchor on "Today" and is thought by many to be the heir apparent 
to Jane Pauley. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Norville a news star? Her tough news coverage? Her reporting on 
Vietnam? Civil rights? AIDS? Central America? Glasnost? Get serious. This kid 
looks like Corky on "Murphy Brown." Norville is a star because, well, she's a 
star. That is why she is co-hosting the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on NBC 
with Willard Scott. 
</P>
<P>
One of these days, as she continues to grow in stature, she'll be joining the 
rest of the news stars in using television to share their views on the human 
condition, as if stardom and wisdom were necessarily synonymous. And America 
will listen because she'll be a star. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, Connie Chung's present series will probably will have been 
canceled. But she'll have a new one that will reflect her next level of 
stardom: "Connie Chung With Saturday Night."

EPIC OF NATURE'S LOST INNOCENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a world squandering its natural resources and slaughtering its wildlife, we 
sometimes sentimentalize over the carnage. As we strip the land, we mourn its 
passing. As we kill off one species after another, we cluck, often impotently, 
over their destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, Jean-Jacques Annaud's new film, "The Bear" (opening citywide 
today), avoids most of these sentimental traps. Based on a 1916 children's book 
by the American naturalist James Oliver Curwood, it's the story of two bears -- 
a fierce grizzly and a lovable cub-ursued implacably by two human hunters in 
the Canadian Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
And though the outline of the movie's story -- the cub Youk losing its mother 
in a landslide triggered by her addiction to honey, its introduction to the 
wounded grizzly Kaar and their shifting relationship with the relentless 
hunters -- may suggest a male-bonding version of "Bambi," the material never 
gets weepy or cloying. Annaud and his collaborators charge it with a sweep and 
exhilaration startling for a family-oriented movie. You'd have to go back to 
the island section of Carroll Ballard's 1979 "The Black Stallion" to find 
something comparable. 
</P>
<P>
Part of that exhilaration comes from the landscapes. Inspired by the paintings 
of Albert Bierstadt and Caspar Friedrich, Annaud shot much of "The Bear" in the 
Bavarian Alps, in a spectacular environment of 10,000-foot-high peaks, snowy 
slopes and pine forests. The cinematographer, the great color stylist Philippe 
Rousselot ("Diva," "The Emerald Forest"), bathes them in frosty, clear light, 
an almost glacial purity and depth. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the exhilaration comes from the astonishing empathy the movie develops 
with and between the bears -- partly, of course, through sheer trickery (the 
many dubbed yaps and yelps of adorable Youk), but also through staggering work 
by trainers Doug and Lynn Seus and Clint Youngreen. When you watch Youk waving 
goodby to some human friends, craning to get a better look and then slumping 
disconsolately to the ground, you never think of how he is being manipulated. 
The action and the shot have an almost magical rightness. 
</P>
<P>
And much of the charge comes simply from the movie's philosophy, the reverence 
for life in the Curwood quote -- "The greatest thrill is not to kill but to let 
live" -- used as the epigraph. The film makers involve you with the animals, 
make you see the world through their eyes, romping with them, running fearfully 
or attacking in anger, mourning death or curling up gratefully together in the 
chilly darkness -- even, in some surreal sequences, dreaming their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Equally, we get the viewpoint of the two hunters (Jack Wallace and Tcheky 
Karyo). These men aren't disembodied villains. Their pursuit of Kaar comes not 
through viciousness but vendetta and pride; they want to avenge the horses and 
dogs he has clawed or killed. He is also, for them both, a symbol of prowess 
and mystical strength, like the prey in Faulkner's "The Bear." 
</P>
<P>
Kaar (played by the Montana-based Kodiak, Bart) becomes like the master warrior 
of a Kurosawa film. When he rubs his back magisterially against a swaying tree, 
it's a gesture of gaudy machismo not unlike Toshiro Mifune's shoulder twitch in 
"Yojimbo." By contrast, the gray, tender little Youk (played by the French cub, 
Douce) is an orphaned mite lost in a beautiful, threatening world, like the 
child protagonists of many European art films. He is the quintessential 
innocent, watching wide-eyed the sports and swaggering of Kaar. 
</P>
<P>
Annaud has a taste for epic subjects. He is a flamboyant visual stylist who is 
drawn to vast or elemental stories: the World War I anti-war, anti-racist fable 
of "Black and White in Color"; the dawn-of-man picaresque of "Quest for Fire"; 
the medieval eschatological murder mystery of "The Name of the Rose." But 
Annaud doesn't treat these subjects solemnly. He makes grandiose images -- and 
sometimes bizarrely baroque ones, like the shot of the moon from a bullet's-eye 
view in "The Bear." But there is also a humorous edge in his visuals, a 
childlike wonder, a witty relish in the absurd mechanisms of man viewed against 
the awesome unity of nature. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Bear," he gets the "Once upon a time . . ." inflection of a good 
Spielberg or Disney picture, but it's steeped in hints of real horror or 
darkness. "Quest," "Rose" and "The Bear" were all written by Roman Polanski's 
regular scenarist, Gerard Brach -- an agoraphobic who has not left his Parisian 
apartment in two decades -- and the sense of entrapment, sexy absurdity or hip 
paranoia in his Polanski films isn't entirely absent here. (There's even some 
bear-faced voyeurism.) In a way, the Annaud-Brach movies are like those glass 
balls that contain immaculate little worlds. Despite the illusion of a 
limitless universe, they're confined, stylized, imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
These hints of bleakness don't dampen the joyous surge of the movie's climax. 
They heighten it. There has been a glut of animal movies in the last few years. 
But, of them all, "The Bear" (MPAA-rated PG, despite some violence and bear 
bawdiness) -- sympathetically imagined, meticulously organized and grandly 
executed -- is easily the period's epic. These movie makers want you to feel 
the thrill of life, of all life. At their best, they do.

CONGRESSMAN PAINTS DARK PICTURE OF NEA FUTURE; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: REP. PAT WILLIAMS SEES CONTENT CONTROL AS A PERMANENT FEATURE OF THE 
ENDOWMENT LANDSCAPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's artistic community has lost much of its political momentum in 
Congress and it is likely that content-control standards are permanently 
imposed on the National Endowment for the Arts, a prominent congressional arts 
leader predicts. 
</P>
<P>
If the trend continues, said Rep. Pat Williams (D-Mont.), arts groups may, as 
early as within the next six months, face an agonizing dilemma: Whether the 
Endowment should be allowed to evolve into a sort of national censorship panel 
or simply be dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
That assessment came in remarks by Williams to a Music Center luncheon 
sponsored by the American Council for the Arts. The New York-based council, one 
of the largest private arts groups in the country, held a board meeting in Los 
Angeles Monday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said renewal of the controversy over the content of federally funded 
arts will be as rancorous as the just-concluded dispute in the House and Senate 
led by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). Williams said a House-Senate compromise bill 
that jettisoned some of the most restrictive language proposed by Helms -- but 
left some content controls in place for the first time -- "was less destructive 
(than what was initially proposed) but isn't a victory." 
</P>
<P>
The bill in question provided $172 million in operating funds for the Endowment 
for the 1990 fiscal year. Theoretically, its content-control provisions and 
other restrictive sections expire in one year. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said that, if arts forces in Congress lose their battle against 
subject-matter control over Endowment-funded art, he may be forced to support a 
measure that would eliminate the Endowment altogether. "I love the NEA," he 
said, "But I have no preconceived notions on whether it should continue to 
exist" if its mission under federal law transformed it into "a conduit for 
censorship." 
</P>
<P>
Williams is chairman of the House post-secondary education subcommittee, which 
will take up a bill next month that would extend the life of the Endowment 
until 1995. The agency must be formally reauthorized by Congress every five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the reauthorization, which is expected to come up for final House 
action early next year and conclude in the Senate sometime in the spring, will 
force arts agencies to grapple again with political pressures to impose content 
controls on the Endowment to prevent federal money being spent on "offensive" 
or "indecent" works. 
</P>
<P>
He said the House reauthorization committee will probably resist such pressures 
and report out a bill that rescinds provisions adopted a few weeks ago that 
discourage federal funding of "obscene" work, but permit the Endowment to 
support such work if it has inherent artistic merit. 
</P>
<P>
But Williams said the political tempest in which the Endowment found itself 
last summer and this fall has not subsided. He said that, irrespective of 
provisions of the committee reauthorization bill, it is nearly inevitable that 
conservatives will move on the House floor to reattach stringent content 
controls -- and probably succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Williams also delivered a rebuke to the nation's arts community, warning that 
advocacy groups and their leaders failed to fully understand the way 
legislation works its way through Congress and failed to intervene early 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
"Those of you who love the arts (but do not get involved in politics) ignore 
the reality of your peril," Williams said. "The issue is coming like a train 
wreck." 
</P>
<P>
The bluntness of Williams' analysis surprised some members of his audience. But 
others, including actor and singer Theodore Bikel, a member of the arts 
council's board, contended that artistic freedom may have already suffered 
major damage: "I wonder whether the harm has not already been done. A certain 
amount of bruising has already taken place." 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting immediately after Williams' speech, American Council for the Arts 
directors voted belatedly to endorse a position taken earlier this month by 
Milton Rhodes, the council's president, that compromise legislation containing 
the vague content controls "is a bitter pill to swallow" and "a very dangerous 
road the Congress is traveling down." 
</P>
<P>
"Art by its nature creates controversy," Williams said. "It requires that 
viewers abandon passivity and adopt passion." When art precipitates raging 
controversy over its subject matter, Williams said, the situation only 
establishes that art "is working." 
</P>
<P>
He said the coming renewed arts debate will force arts supporters to make 
uncomfortable choices and face disquieting questions. He said he will hold a 
hearing next month in an attempt to address the conflict between the inherent 
rights of artists to express themselves and the right of taxpayers to object to 
what they see as inappropriate use of their funds. 
</P>
<P>
If the assessment was gloomy, Williams also became one of the first politicians 
to come to the defense of besieged artists whose work became the focal point of 
a summer crisis for the Endowment. 
</P>
<P>
Williams came most forcefully to the defense of Robert Mapplethorpe, the late 
New York photographer, and Andres Serrano, another New York photographer who 
produced an image of a crucifix immersed in urine that was titled "Piss 
Christ." 
</P>
<P>
Mapplethorpe's images of homoerotic and sadomasochistic subjects became a 
lightning rod for conservative anger when they were included in a traveling 
show partially funded by the Endowment. 
</P>
<P>
"Mapplethorpe and Serrano are the right wing's new Willie Horton," said 
Williams, refering to the Massachusetts criminal who committed violent crimes 
while on a prison furlough. Horton became an issue in the 1988 presidential 
campaign. "It's wrong to use the arts for that in this country," Williams 
declared. "It creates a cancer in America."

THE TIMES POLL; 
</P>
<P>
S.D. VOTERS QUICKLY WARM TO DISTRICT-ONLY ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After their first taste of district-only campaigns, San Diegans have warmed 
considerably to the idea and now approve of the new method of electing San 
Diego City Council members by a more than 4-to-1 margin, a Times poll shows. 
</P>
<P>
District elections, approved by a razor-thin 51% majority last year, apparently 
won over more converts in September's council primaries, as reflected in the 
poll's finding that registered voters approve of the electoral change by a 
61%-14% margin. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who favor district elections, more than three-fourths believe that 
district races give neighborhoods a bigger voice in electing council members 
and, thereby, enhance individual communities' clout at City Hall. The results 
of last month's primaries in four council districts reinforced that perception, 
as one incumbent was defeated and two others were forced into tough November 
runoffs -- the bleakest performance by sitting council members in more than a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
On other issues, the poll showed that: 
</P>
<P>
* Mayor Maureen O'Connor's popularity has dropped to below 50%, though she 
continues to draw positive job-performance reviews by a more than 3-to-2 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
* Nearly half of San Diegans say that they do not know enough about their own 
council member to judge his or her performance. More than three-fourths of the 
city's registered voters also are not familiar with a plan to expand the size 
of the council, but, when the proposal is explained to them, 47% support the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
* Support for growth-control measures remains strong, with 59% of the public 
favoring limits on development even if those restrictions harm business or 
endanger jobs. 
</P>
<P>
* San Diegans, by a convincing 59%-26% margin, favor the city-sponsored Soviet 
arts festival that began last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Times poll was based on telephone interviews conducted Sunday with 701 
people throughout the city of San Diego. The poll's margin of sampling error is 
plus or minus 5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
With the city's first district-only council runoff elections in nearly 60 years 
only two weeks away, the poll found that public support for district races has 
increased dramatically since last November's Proposition E campaign. In last 
fall's race -- the fifth time in 19 years in which San Diegans were asked 
whether council members should be elected strictly within individual districts 
-- a narrow majority of voters overturned the city's former electoral system of 
district primaries followed by citywide runoffs between the top two 
vote-getters. 
</P>
<P>
Less than one year later, district elections, which are being used this year in 
half of the council's eight districts, drew a more favorable reaction -- 61% 
among registered voters and 57% overall, the poll showed. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why they like district races, 76% of those in favor said they believe 
that elections confined to districts will expand neighborhoods' role in local 
government -- both in council elections and the formulation of city policy. 
Under the city's former two-tiered election format, neighborhood activists 
often complained that their wishes were frequently overwhelmed by citywide 
interests or by political pressure applied by groups outside their district. 
</P>
<P>
Another 10% explained their support by noting that district elections make it 
possible for relatively unknown candidates with limited financial backing to 
win through grass-roots campaigns, while 8% suggested that the new election 
system will improve minority representation on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Among those registered voters who oppose district elections, 58% said they fear 
that district races will cause council members to become preoccupied with 
narrow, parochial issues, to the detriment of citywide concerns. An additional 
26% of the opponents were distressed by the fact that district elections have 
reduced individual council members' constituencies to one-eighth of their 
previous citywide size, using that point to argue that future council members 
will be elected by too few people. 
</P>
<P>
People on both sides of the district-election issue, however, doubt that the 
change in election methods will have a major impact in the way that city 
government is run. Sixty-one percent of those polled said they believe that 
district elections will produce little or "hardly any" change, compared to 22% 
who predicted major changes at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Another potential major structural change in city government -- the proposal to 
increase the number of council seats from eight to 10 -- apparently has 
attracted little public interest to date, the poll showed. 
</P>
<P>
More than three-fourths of the public -- 76% among registered voters and 81% 
overall -- say they have not heard or read much about the plan, which will 
appear on the June, 1990, ballot under the terms of the city's recent 
settlement of a voting-rights lawsuit. However, when details of the 
council-expansion plan were explained to them, registered voters approved of 
the proposal by a 47%-33% margin, with 20% undecided. 
</P>
<P>
The poll provided mixed political signals for Mayor O'Connor, showing that her 
personal popularity has declined even as public support for the Soviet arts 
festival -- a controversial event that she has championed for the past two 
years -- increases. 
</P>
<P>
By 45% to 27%, registered San Diegans approve of O'Connor's performance, with 
more than one-fourth of the public undecided -- an unusually high percentage of 
undecideds for someone who has been in public office as long as O'Connor. That 
job-approval index, though still favorable, represents a significant drop from 
the 69% positive rating that O'Connor received in a May, 1988, Times poll, as 
well as from her 60% reelection margin the following month. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the explanation for O'Connor's slippage in the polls may be that she 
simply is experiencing the midterm decline in popularity common among elected 
officials. Now nearly 3 1/2 years into her mayoralty -- which began with her 
victory in a special 1986 election necessitated by Roger Hedgecock's forced 
resignation following his felony conviction -- O'Connor has been in office long 
enough to attract significant opposition through her handling of myriad issues. 
</P>
<P>
"For a mayor who's had to tackle some very tough issues -- growth-management, 
the assault-weapon ban, sewage, crime -- those numbers still are very 
gratifying," said Paul Downey, O'Connor's press secretary. "If you were to 
divide the undecided, and people had to vote today, it looks like we'd probably 
come out just about where we were last year with about 60%." 
</P>
<P>
Should the Soviet arts festival prove an artistic and public-relations success, 
the three-week event's popularity conceivably could produce an upswing in 
O'Connor's own approval rating, because she has invested two years of effort 
and a considerable amount of her prestige -- as well as $3 million in city 
funds -- in the festival. 
</P>
<P>
Conducted on the same day as Super Powers Sunday -- the kickoff to the festival 
that drew more than 50,000 people to Balboa Park -- the poll found that San 
Diegans approve of the event by a more than 2-to-1 margin, 59% to 26%. When the 
same question was asked in a May, 1988, Times poll, public opinion among 
registered voters was more evenly split, with 40% in favor, 35% opposed and 25% 
undecided. 
</P>
<P>
"Strong public support like that is going to make some of the people who have 
been critical of the festival reassess their position -- or at least realize 
they're in the minority," Downey said. "It proves what we've said all along -- 
that people are enthusiastic over bringing top world talent to San Diego and do 
favor this kind of cultural exchange." 
</P>
<P>
While O'Connor can be heartened by at least some of the poll's findings, the 
results were gloomier for the San Diego City Council. In short, the poll found 
that most San Diegans do not know much about the council, and dislike what they 
do know about it. 
</P>
<P>
If district elections are designed in part to establish a closer rapport 
between elected officials and their constituencies, the poll shows that there 
clearly is a need for improvement in that area at City Hall. Forty-three 
percent of the registered voters polled -- and 48% overall -- said that they 
are not familiar enough with the council member who represents them to assess 
his or her performance. Among those with an opinion, attitudes were divided, 
with 28% expressing satisfaction and 23% disapproving of their council member. 
</P>
<P>
Collectively, the council fares little better than its individual members. 
Asked to judge the council's handling of growth issues -- long one of the most 
volatile topics in San Diego politics -- registered voters expressed 
disapproval by a 39%-33% margin. 
</P>
<P>
Although voters rejected two city growth-control measures last November, the 
poll found strong majority support for restrictions on development -- sentiment 
that environmentalists hope to tap into next year when they plan to put another 
ballot proposition before voters. 
</P>
<P>
By a more than 2-to-1 margin -- 64% to 27% -- registered voters say they favor 
limiting growth, even at the risk of damaging business or eliminating jobs. 
Moreover, the poll found that, for many people, growth is a pivotal issue in 
determining how they vote, with slow-growth advocates, by a 45%-37% margin, 
saying that they would vote against a pro-growth candidate, even if they agreed 
with that candidate on most other issues. 
</P>
<P>
Prevent Los Angelization Now, the successor organization to Citizens for 
Limited Growth -- the group that waged last year's unsuccessful growth 
limitation battles -- next month will begin gathering signatures for a 1990 
ballot initiative that would link the issuance of building permits to traffic 
congestion and the availability of public needs such as drinking water and a 
sewage treatment system. 
</P>
<P>
If PLAN succeeds in getting that measure on the ballot, it will have the 
benefit of trying to make its case to an initially receptive public, the poll 
showed. Indeed, 61% of the registered voters surveyed said that they would be 
inclined to support another slow-growth measure, while only 27% expressed 
disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
That finding, however, may be illustrative more of one of the peculiarities of 
San Diego politics than it is indicative of any such proposal's prospects for 
approval at the polls -- in particular, of environmentalists' inability to 
transform generally solid public backing into tangible electoral success. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, numerous public opinion surveys have consistently detected 
strong public support for growth controls. However, just as consistently, the 
building industry, through effective high-budget campaigns, has managed to 
defeat most slow-growth ballot measures. Last November, for example, developers 
not only defeated the two city measures, but also turned back two similar 
propositions on the countywide ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Growth-control sentiment is considerably stronger among women than men, the 
poll showed. While women favored growth limitations by an overwhelming 70%-19% 
margin, the men polled narrowly supported such restrictions, 48% to 43%. 
High-income persons also were more favorable toward growth limits than 
lower-income individuals, whose attitude perhaps reflected a desire to see more 
jobs created by economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Racial and ethnic distinctions also were evident in the poll respondents' 
positions on growth issues. While whites were strongly in favor of slowing down 
growth, 65% to 25%, minorities preferred economic development by a 49%-39% 
margin.

TOO MUCH SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest the recent article about the USC band. It is wonderful 
when a band and student body have spirit. 
</P>
<P>
I grew up in a rather small Ohio town where football was and is what this town 
is known for. Their band was and is phenomenal. But with all their spirit and 
enthusiasm for the past 45 years, they have remembered that the opposing team, 
band and fans are their guests, and they don't blare their fight song during 
every play. 
</P>
<P>
My sister and I were at the Ohio State-USC game last month. If we never hear 
that USC fight song again, it will be too soon.

STATWATCH: BEAUER ADDS TO STREAK OF TOUCHDOWN CATCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clint Beauer of Canyon High, the state leader in touchdown receptions with 11, 
has caught a touchdown pass in eight consecutive games dating to last season's 
Southern Section Division II championship game against Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Beauer leads Valley-area players with 47 receptions and is the state's 
second-leading receiver behind Eric Hansen of North Torrance, who has 58 
catches. Hansen has 803 yards receiving to Beauer's 771. 
</P>
<P>
Passing: What's all the fuss about Thousand Oaks' passing game? The Lancers' 
passing yardage has accounted for 20.7% of their offense. In 1987, the year 
they won the Coastal Conference championship, the passing game produced 20.2% 
of the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham quarterback Danny Larson has rushed for 285 yards and thrown for 746 
yards, giving him 1,031 all-purpose yards through five games. Braves' receiver 
Jake Brescher has caught 19 passes for 380 yards, accounting for more than half 
of Larson's passing yardage. 
</P>
<P>
High five: Granada Hills' offensive average, listed in Sunday's edition, was 
based on five, rather than six, games. The Highlanders are actually averaging 
329.8 yards a game, not 395.8. 
</P>
<P>
It was fun while it lasted. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked pretty good to me," Highlander co-Coach Tom Harp said. 
</P>
<P>
Rushing: Through five games, Monroe has rushed for 163 yards. Last year, 
tailback Curtis Scott averaged 176.6 yards a game. . . . Since transferring 
from San Fernando two weeks ago, tailback Maurice McFarland has rushed for 108 
yards in 28 carries for North Hollywood. . . . Poly's Jonathan Campbell has 
rushed for 747 yards, accounting for more than half of Poly's 1,353 total 
offensive output. 
</P>
<P>
Extra points: For the first time this season, tailback Johnny Carter of San 
Fernando outgained his cousin, Ontiwaun Carter of Kennedy. Johnny, a junior, 
rushed for 107 yards in 15 carries and scored a touchdown in San Fernando's 
26-6 defeat of El Camino Real. Ontiwaun, also a junior, was held to 81 yards in 
22 carries in a 35-21 loss to Cleveland. Ontiwaun still leads Valley-area City 
backs with 877 yards. The Northwest Valley Conference's other Carter -- Irving 
of Taft, a senior who is unrelated -- gained 75 yards in 17 carries.

<P>
When Italy's Gianfranco Ferre showed his first collection for the French house 
of Christian Dior last summer, critics accused him of trying too hard and 
straying toward prissiness. 
</P>
<P>
But his Monday show of spring and summer designs, his first ready-to-wear 
collection for Dior, was more relaxed. There were plenty of flexible separates 
-- smart city pants, shorts, skirts, flouncy chiffon chemises and tight jackets 
in black, white, gray, periwinkle blue, red, violet and vibrant yellow. 
</P>
<P>
His signature -- the bow blouse -- was outsized in organza or taffeta. Some 
were worn off the shoulder, others had black lace cuffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian designer took traditional Dior trademarks -- ballroom skirts, 
little black dresses, lilies-of-the-valley -- and gave them a contemporary 
look. 
</P>
<P>
Flower-brocaded evening skirts were sheer enough to allow legs to show through. 
Little black dresses were cut from slinky leather, and red taffeta ball gowns 
were cut away in front to reveal narrow black-satin slacks. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a marriage of Dior and Ferre," the sweat-drenched designer said after 
the show. "I've tried to take the great Dior name and adapt it to contemporary 
life." 
</P>
<P>
"A lovely collection," said designer Paloma Picasso, praising the taffeta 
dresses and stream-lined city slacks. 
</P>
<P>
Notable by her absence from the audience was Princess Caroline of Monaco, a 
devotee of Dior's previous designer, Marc Bohan. Since Bohan was abruptly 
dismissed and replaced by Ferre last spring, the princess has boycotted Dior 
shows. But this time her place was taken by another royal -- Britain's Princess 
Michael of Kent. 
</P>
<P>
At Chanel, West German-born designer Karl Lagerfeld presented one of his best 
collections. He led off with transparent chiffon skirts worn under ivory tweed 
jackets. Transparency is a theme in most Paris collections for spring. 
Lagerfeld treated it as one of the several important ingredients for modern 
dress. Others are shorts for all occasions, and bosom wraps. 
</P>
<P>
Lagerfeld played with the jacket form, cutting it into a short bolero, or 
leaving it so long and fitted that it all but covered the flirty miniskirts or 
shorts worn underneath. 
</P>
<P>
He curved the decorative trimming indelibly associated with Chanel into 
geometric designs to outline pockets, hems and necklines. 
</P>
<P>
It was a leggy collection, given an airy feel by the floating chiffon Lagerfeld 
used for his asymmetric skirts and fluttering shorts. Black chiffon dresses 
were scooped and draped at the sides to show the thighs, and the same fabric 
returned in hot pants for evening wear. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese-born designer Hanae Mori, who was presented with the Legion of Honor 
during this press week, celebrated her 35th year in the industry with a 
particularly young-looking collection. 
</P>
<P>
Short skirts, wide shorts and long flared skirts in striped chiffon made up her 
daytime sportswear. She put her signature -- the butterfly -- on navy linen 
suits and on her iridescent evening wear.

AT 33, IT'S STILL WORTH A SHOT; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: MARQUES JOHNSON WANTS TO FIND OUT IF HE'S STILL OF NBA CALIBER, 
EVEN THOUGH HE KNOWS IT MEANS ACCEPTING A RESERVE ROLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They spoke face to face, Johnson to Johnson, last summer after another 
afternoon of pickup basketball at UCLA. Marques wanted to hear it straight from 
Magic, the unqualified truth: 
</P>
<P>
"Can I still play?" 
</P>
<P>
Marques needed to know. It had been three seasons since he had last played in 
the National Basketball Assn. His once-flourishing career had ended, or so 
everyone thought, 10 games into the 1986-87 season when he suffered a ruptured 
cervical disk in his neck after running head-on into Clipper teammate Benoit 
Benjamin's stomach. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Johnson had kept his distance from basketball, having received 
varying reports from doctors about the degrees of danger if he were to play 
with his neck condition. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Johnson's 18-month-old son drowned shortly after that injury, and life 
seemed difficult enough to handle without giving the NBA another stab. But last 
summer, at 33, Johnson picked up a ball and a sense of purpose. Before he made 
a move, however, he had to know whether he was fooling himself. That was when 
he approached Magic. 
</P>
<P>
The reply: "You can play. Not the way you used to play, but good enough to play 
in this league." 
</P>
<P>
Given that encouragement, Marques thought of a team that needed an older, 
heavier, step-slower, 6-foot-7 swingman trying to revive his career. 
</P>
<P>
Don Nelson, coach of the eclectic Golden State Warriors, seemed the logical 
choice. Nelson had coached Johnson during his All-Star years with the Milwaukee 
Bucks before Johnson was traded to the Clippers in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
They are reunited now, and it appears that Johnson has earned the 12th, and 
final, roster spot. Trying to switch to power forward on a team that can use 
lineups either very tall or small, Johnson is struggling to adjust his game and 
help the Warriors strictly in a supporting role. 
</P>
<P>
If this seems quite a comedown for Johnson, a five-time All-Star and 1986 
comeback player of the year who boasts a career scoring average of 20.3 points 
a game, well, it is. 
</P>
<P>
But even though he is 10 to 15 pounds heavier than during his halcyon days, 
even though he has lost many of his dips and spins and other moves around the 
basket, and even though he might not play much should he make the team, Johnson 
wants to give it a try just to see if he still can do it. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Johnson returned to Los Angeles with the Warriors for two 
games in a four-team exhibition tournament at the Forum. He was not 
particularly impressive, but he wasn't outclassed, either. He scored seven 
points in 20 minutes against Cleveland Saturday and eight points in 23 minutes 
against Philadelphia Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done really well," Nelson said. "He's not there yet, but he can get 
pretty close to where he was. I don't think there's anything magical about 33. 
I think he can get back to the way he played when he was younger. 
</P>
<P>
"At the start (of training camp), he was questioning himself. This isn't the 
playground or UCLA in the summer against the Lakers. There are some killers in 
this league who won't go easy. You won't see the change in two weeks. But in 
one or two months, he'll be making those layups he's missing now." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, actually, seems less optimistic -- or more realistic -- than Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't do the things I used to and I've come to terms with that," Johnson 
said. "I just want to try and play again in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a struggle for me the first couple of years (after the accident). I was 
uncertain whether I wanted to (play), whether I could play. It was also whether 
my neck could hold up." Johnson's neck injury, which left him with temporary 
paralysis, was the most serious concern. Clipper doctors recommended 
corrective, albeit risky, neck surgery. Other doctors Johnson contacted, 
however, determined that surgery was not required, but that playing with his 
neurological condition might be risky, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is stabilized now," Johnson said. "The doctors I've seen have 
assured me of that. There is no risk of paralysis. I feel confident about that. 
I've been hit enough upside the head to know that I can take (the pounding). 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I was real nervous. I didn't know whether I was going to reinjure 
myself. But it got to the point where I've been hit enough that I don't even 
think about it. When I play now, it's not a factor." 
</P>
<P>
Three years of a relatively sedentary existence have created a problem, though. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson played his first game since 1986 last July during Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 
tour of Australia with a group of former NBA players. It was not a success, 
Johnson conceded. He was always winded and his skills were not sharp. 
</P>
<P>
"That was more discouraging than encouraging," Johnson said. "That Australian 
team we played against, they had been together for a long time and were in 
playing shape, and we had a tough time. 
</P>
<P>
"After that, I really questioned doing this." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson returned to Los Angeles late last summer somewhat dejected but not 
defeated. He started frequenting UCLA, where Magic Johnson, A.C. Green and 
others play pickup games. Johnson said he held his own in those free-form 
games, which heartened him. 
</P>
<P>
Doubt still lingered, however. So, Marques asked Magic's advice. 
</P>
<P>
"I just asked him point-blank, and he had a lot of positive things to say," 
Marques said. "His opinion helped, but the question is always going to be 
there. I mean, it has been three years." 
</P>
<P>
Magic said he did not want to discourage Marques but did not want to lead him 
on, either. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him what I thought, that he could still make it in this league," Magic 
said. "Any time you take that much time off, you got to wonder. He kind of 
caught me off guard when he asked me. I can't imagine what it is like to be a 
(star) and then come back like this. But I know he is serious about it. He's 
very dedicated, a true professional." 
</P>
<P>
Marques Johnson simply hopes to be a professional again. He can accept not 
being a star. He can accept sitting more than playing. He can even accept it if 
Nelson cuts him. In his mind, though, he still believes he can play. Now, it is 
up to his body to cooperate.

HOLTZ TAKES BLAME FOR PREGAME INCIDENT; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: NOTRE DAME'S PLAYERS ARE EXPECTED TO WRITE A COLLECTIVE 
LETTER OF APOLOGY TO USC FOR THE FIGHT THAT BEGAN AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
What really happened at Notre Dame? 
</P>
<P>
Three days after the Fighting Irish defeated USC, 28-24, there remain more 
questions than answers about the fighting the Irish and Trojans did before the 
game. There is still little light at the end of the tunnel incident. 
</P>
<P>
Who started it? Were the Notre Dame players lying in wait for the Trojans? Or 
did USC instigate the brawl by disrupting the Fighting Irish pregame drills? 
</P>
<P>
The evidence seems to support USC. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz has taken full responsibility, and said he'd resign 
if it ever happened again. Notre Dame's players are expected to write a 
collective letter of apology to the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Rosenthal, Notre Dame's athletic director, has called Mike McGee, his 
USC counterpart, to apologize and assure that this will never happen again. 
</P>
<P>
But details remain sketchy. This is one case where instant replay is no help. 
It just shows a mass of bodies pushing and shoving outside the tunnel leading 
to the locker rooms at Notre Dame Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It got pretty rough in there. Two off-duty policemen, working as bodyguards for 
the Trojans, got caught in the middle. One suffered a black eye. The other lost 
a tooth. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, one of those most seriously injured was a Notre Dame security guard 
who was attacked by his own players. His mistake was wearing a yellow rain 
slicker, the same style and color as those worn by the USC coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Figuring there were about 120 Notre Dame players in uniform and about 60 
Trojans, you could probably ask each individual and get 180 different versions 
of what happened. 
</P>
<P>
This much seems clear: The Trojans, leaving the field after their pregame 
warmup, ran into the middle of Notre Dame's punt drill. 
</P>
<P>
"We were running in," USC quarterback Todd Marinovich said, "and guys were 
getting picked off. That's going to happen because we were done with our 
warm-ups before they were. They were right at the tunnel, punting toward us." 
</P>
<P>
The rules, clearly marked in the visiting locker room, request that the 
opposing team use the narrow sidelines to exit the field. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no sidelines on that field," Marinovich said. "I don't see how 60 
guys can go single file into the tunnel without going by them anyway. It was 
just a madhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our players got into the tunnel, but then they (the Irish) blocked the 
tunnel from the stragglers." 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich, although he made it safely to the tunnel, didn't escape the blows. 
</P>
<P>
"I was dodging guys and I got a forearm I didn't even see. It was a jab," he 
said, pointing to his ribs. 
</P>
<P>
When Marinovich looked up, he saw defensive end Scott Kowalkowski. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get involved in those things," Marinovich said. "All you can do is 
hurt your hand, and I don't need any of that. So I just kept going." 
</P>
<P>
But not before the two exchanged words. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be running into you all afternoon, " Kowalkowski reportedly said. 
</P>
<P>
Nor was Marinovich totally innocent. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after throwing a touchdown pass, he deliberately ran into Kowalkowski. 
</P>
<P>
"I just gave him a little nudge," Marinovich said, "to let him know I was 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Tit for tat. 
</P>
<P>
Here were archrivals placed in a volatile pregame situation with the logical 
result. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not the first such incident at Notre Dame Stadium. A year ago, the 
Fighting Irish and players from Miami clashed in the same tunnel before another 
big game. 
</P>
<P>
John Heisler, Notre Dame's sports information director, said one possible 
solution would be for the Fighting Irish to warm up on the other side of the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Such a good idea, you'd think somebody might have thought of it before. 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach Larry Smith has tried to avoid discussing the Notre Dame game, 
attempting to refocus his team's attention on Saturday's game against Stanford 
at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
But asked about "the Spot," he broke his own gag rule. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial spot came on USC's first drive of the third quarter. On third 
and seven at the Trojan 14-yard line, Marinovich hit tight end Scott Galbraith 
with a pass. On the replay, it appeared that Galbraith had reached the 22-yard 
line before being pushed back and out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
But the ball was spotted at the 20, leaving USC a yard short. The Trojans 
punted, and Notre Dame, trailing at the time, 17-7, drove down and scored to 
get back in the game. 
</P>
<P>
So what did Smith say to the official? 
</P>
<P>
"I just asked him how he could sleep at night," Smith said. "How could he look 
himself in the mirror?" 
</P>
<P>
Smith, now in his third year at USC and his 14th year as a collegiate head 
coach, said this defeat went down as hard as any. 
</P>
<P>
"We put so much into it," he said, "emotionally, physically and everything, 
played so hard and wanted to win it so bad . . . That was probably the hardest 
I've ever seen a team take a loss." 
</P>
<P>
Smith included. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans have lost seven straight games to Notre Dame. Smith himself has 
coached the last three defeats, including last season's battle for No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
But going in, he was sure this was the year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a down place right now," Smith said Tuesday of the USC campus. "We 
haven't received any heat of any kind. It's been all support. 
</P>
<P>
"But when you want something so badly and don't get it, we all have to know 
this is part of life. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like that kid at Christmas who has been wishing for that pony all his 
life. He thinks, 'Boy, this is the year I'm going to get it. I'm old enough to 
ride it. Everything's perfect. The barn's built.' 
</P>
<P>
"And he doesn't get it. The next day, he's not going to be a very happy camper, 
right?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Trojan defensive lineman Randy Hord, who limped into practice last week on a 
sprained ankle, limped out of Saturday's game with an injury to the other ankle 
and is listed as "very doubtful" this Saturday. . . . Running backs Aaron 
Emanuel (shoulder) and Scott Lockwood (dislocated thumb) will also stay on the 
sideline except in an emergency. . . . Kick returner Bruce Luizzi has a 
shoulder separation and is not expected to play either . . . The cold weather 
in South Bend, Ind., has left the Trojans facing a cold and flu attack, but 
that is not expected to keep anyone on the bench against Stanford. . . . Nose 
tackle Don Gibson, who has yet to play a down this season, may be just a week 
away. Gibson, who tore knee ligaments in preseason training, may see his first 
action against Oregon State Nov. 4 at the Coliseum. . . . Marc Preston has 
beaten out Ron Dale for the punting job.

PRO FOOTBALL: SEAN SALISBURY HAS TAKEN A STARRING ROLE IN THE CANADIAN FOOTBALL 
LEAGUE, HOPING IT WILL LEAD TO AN OFFER FROM AN NFL TEAM.

<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Winter came to Manitoba with a sense of urgency on the first weekend of 
October, the temperature having dropped 50 degrees to the freezing level from 
one day to the next. The nonstop wind, with no mountains near this provincial 
capital to slow it down, blew through town at 50 m.p.h. Flags snapped straight 
as sheet metal. 
</P>
<P>
Inside Winnipeg Stadium, Sean Salisbury, quarterback of the hometown Blue 
Bombers, the defending Canadian Football League champions, dressed at his 
locker. Wide receiver Randy Fabi was at the next stall. It was about 90 minutes 
before the start of the 7 p.m. game against the Toronto Argonauts. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a fan," Salisbury said to Fabi, "do you come to this game?" 
</P>
<P>
They laughed. But he had spoken like a true foreigner, a warm-weather import at 
that. As it turned out, an average-size crowd of about 22,000 people leaned 
against the relentless wind to watch an eventual Winnipeg loss. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this one bad guess, Salisbury is very much a local, as much a part of 
the football scenery as end zones 20 yards deep, 110-yard fields, 12-man sides, 
three-down series, and the Grey Cup that the Blue Bombers won last season -- 
the Grey Cup that Salisbury led them to. 
</P>
<P>
Now, many in this city of 650,000 are holding their breath, not to mention 
their football hopes and wallets, to learn his next move. 
</P>
<P>
"If Sean signs a new, long-term contract, he would be the most popular athlete 
in town," said Blue Bomber kicker Trevor Kennerd, who works at an advertising 
agency during the off-season. "He might be right now. But this is a bit of a 
wait-and-see city, and they're just waiting to embrace him." 
</P>
<P>
Waiting to see if Salisbury, whose contract expires after this season, makes a 
commitment to staying. 
</P>
<P>
And then? 
</P>
<P>
As Kennerd, a 10-year Winnipeg resident, said: "If we can get this guy signed, 
he'll own this town." 
</P>
<P>
During a much-maligned career at USC, no one would have believed it possible. 
Owning a house, yes. A town, no. 
</P>
<P>
There is no secret to his astounding popularity, just surprise that it would 
belong to an American quarterback rather than to a member of the National 
Hockey League's Jets. He came in at the midpoint last year and led the Blue 
Bombers, a 9-9 team during the regular season, to the Grey Cup, the CFL 
equivalent of the Super Bowl. Next thing the 6-foot-5, 215-pound Salisbury 
knows, he's bigger in Winnipeg than parkas. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't trade that feeling for any I've ever had in sports," Salisbury said 
the day after the Toronto game while sitting in the apartment he shares with 
his wife of 15 months, Kim. "Winning a championship, at any level, is what it's 
all about. . . . When I was growing up, that was all I ever wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Except that in his dream, the championship was a little closer to home, not in 
Ottawa, and he'd make commercials that lifelong friends could see. 
</P>
<P>
That didn't happen, and therein lies the rub. Right plan, wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
While Salisbury may be a big fish in the smaller pond of the CFL, he is very 
much a fish out of water. 
</P>
<P>
Movies come to town weeks after friends in Los Angeles are talking about them. 
Players' wives used to sit in the stands before a game and wait to see if Kim 
would dress more for California than a Winnipeg winter night, not realizing 
until later that she was from Denver and knew something about the cold. 
</P>
<P>
Salisbury originally turned down overtures from Winnipeg because he considered 
the CFL a minor league. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew about Warren Moon and Joe Theismann; I'd run across a few plays on TV, 
laugh a little bit and wonder why the end zones were so long," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you would have asked me 16 months ago if I would play in the CFL, I would 
have laughed in your face. I would have said I'd retire first." 
</P>
<P>
But when the decision came to that -- Canada or quit -- he came north. On Aug. 
27, 1988, the night after he and Kim were married in Denver, they became 
residents of Manitoba. 
</P>
<P>
Salisbury went because he had something to prove. 
</P>
<P>
He left USC as the Trojans' then-No. 1 career leader in completions, since 
surpassed only by Rodney Peete. And Salisbury accomplished that despite having 
to come back from two knee operations. He was the quarterback in the 4-6-1 
season of 1983 but was injured and on the sideline when Tim Green led the way 
in the 1985 Rose Bowl victory over Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
"When the last game of my senior year was over, I was glad it was over," he 
said, admittedly sensitive about his USC years. "I went through two knee 
injuries, a coaching change, two quarterback coach changes, a 4-6-1 season, 
sitting out a Rose Bowl and not being drafted, and it's like people are still 
saying they're not sure if I can make it. I guess I'm upset because nobody 
seems to point out how hard I worked to achieve what I did. 
</P>
<P>
"Even now, when I go back to the campus sometimes, the feelings are partly of 
hurt because I don't feel part of the tradition like I should. The alumni were, 
and still are, great, and I got a great education. But . . . " 
</P>
<P>
But something is not right. He says today he would recruit for the Trojans any 
way they might ask. He recalls the majority of his time at the school with 
great fondness, and he calls meeting current Coach Larry Smith at a booster 
club meeting in San Diego an honor. And they still don't give him due respect? 
</P>
<P>
The night of the National Football League draft, Salisbury left a party at his 
brother's house in San Diego without hearing his name called, went home to 
Escondido and cried himself to sleep. No calls, inviting him to try out as a 
free agent, came for several days. 
</P>
<P>
He hooked on with Seattle and spent the entire 1986 season with the Seahawks. 
He got cut during the next training camp. 
</P>
<P>
He went to Indianapolis just before the end of the strike. The next draft when 
the Colts acquired Chris Chandler, and Salisbury knew his time was limited as 
quarterbacks were stockpiled. He asked to be released. 
</P>
<P>
No one else from the NFL called. Winnipeg did, but Salisbury said no. He 
finally went for a tryout, said no again as the interest continued, and left to 
prepare for his wedding. 
</P>
<P>
But he couldn't quit yet. He considered a career in broadcasting, but the time 
for that would come later, he decided. 
</P>
<P>
There was this little matter of his ability as a football player, something 
Salisbury had been confident about for what seemed like forever. He still 
needed to prove it to people at USC and in the NFL. To himself. 
</P>
<P>
"There's, what, 80 or 84 quarterbacks in the NFL, right?" he said. "I promise 
you, there are not 80 quarterbacks there better than me. Let's be blunt. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what I want more than anything? To have an NFL team solicit me to 
play for them. That's when I'll know I'm wanted." 
</P>
<P>
That's one thing the Blue Bombers had going for them. They wanted Salisbury. 
</P>
<P>
After arriving in Canada, his opinion changed. The city was bigger than 
expected, likewise the talent of the players was better. It wasn't Los Angeles 
-- or Toronto or Montreal or Vancouver, for that matter -- but there's 
something to be said for being a starting quarterback in professional football 
making other transitions easier. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his career took off. Suddenly thrust into surroundings where the 
wind chill can drop to 10 or 15 degrees below zero, to the point that you learn 
to hate halftime because going into the locker room provides a false sense of 
security against the cold, Salisbury started five of seven regular-season games 
in 1988. He was Winnipeg's only quarterback in the three postseason outings, 
and the Blue Bombers went 7-2 when he played. 
</P>
<P>
There is no such thing as national ad campaigns for CFL players, unlike their 
counterparts to the south. But Kennerd estimates that Salisbury, 26, is popular 
enough after last season to earn $25,000 a year on commercials. A deal with 
Salisbury House, a coffee-shop chain, was so obvious that one marketing firm 
had a script ready within a few days of the Grey Cup victory. 
</P>
<P>
Picture Salisbury, the player, in a booth at the restaurant. He puts his arm 
around the Cup, and looks into the camera, saying: "C'mon over to my house." 
</P>
<P>
A natural. 
</P>
<P>
Except that Salisbury, who rents an apartment in Carlsbad, Calif., during the 
off-season, would have to stay in Canada to land the deal, and apparently 
several others. Stay for a while, not just another season. 
</P>
<P>
He could be the big man in town some more, but he would still be in Winnipeg 
and he would still be in the Canadian Football League. He tries to be 
diplomatic about remaining a Blue Bomber, but the truth has no soft edge. 
</P>
<P>
"That I would love to stay is a saying that's a little far-fetched," Salisbury 
said. "I tell the people that in the media here, so they'll get off my back. 
But I'd love to stay?" 
</P>
<P>
No. 
</P>
<P>
So, what are the chances he will be back in Winnipeg next season? 
</P>
<P>
"Slim," Salisbury said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Kim: "Hopefully, very slim." 
</P>
<P>
Added Sean: "I don't think they can make it worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
In a league that operates under a $3-million salary cap, which includes 
incidentals like training camp, Salisbury reportedly could break the $90,000 
barrier, depending on bonuses for games played and started. He turned down an 
offer before the season worth nearly $130,000 a year, hoping to parlay another 
big season into a contract equal to the $165,000 deal that former Cal State 
Fullerton star Damon Allen has with the Ottawa Rough Riders. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Salisbury waits for what he has wanted all along. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'm being presumptuous, but I have to believe some team in the NFL will 
put me in the position to make it crazy for me to come back (to Winnipeg)," he 
said. "That's what I hope. I want them to make the decision for me." 
</P>
<P>
He wants a reason to leave is what he wants. After all, if you're a 
strong-armed California boy with confidence and pride so robust it should be 
declared at customs, do you come to this game, in weather like this?

MULDOWNEY SAYS LATEST WIN RANKS AMONG HER MOST MEMORABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For more than a year, from June of 1984 through the summer of 1985, the biggest 
question in Shirley Muldowney's life was if she would ever walk again, much 
less drive a 3,000-horsepower race car. 
</P>
<P>
Then in January of 1986, she strapped herself into her pink top-fuel dragster, 
hit the throttle and raced down the quarter mile of asphalt at Firebird 
Raceway, outside Phoenix, in 5.58 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The lady was back. 
</P>
<P>
Then for three years, she heard and read of what a remarkable comeback she had 
made from a 250-m.p.h. crash during a race at the Sanair track, near Montreal. 
After she was pulled out of a muddy field in what was left of her dragster, 
doctors had to rebuild her left foot and repair her legs, pelvis, fingers and a 
nearly severed thumb. 
</P>
<P>
The racing world marveled at her comeback, but she felt unfulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
She was walking and she was even racing, but that was not enough. She wanted to 
be back on the throne she had occupied in 1977, 1980 and 1982 -- the best damn 
drag racer in the world. 
</P>
<P>
No one else but Don (Big Daddy) Garlits has won three National Hot Rod Assn. 
top-fuel championships. Muldowney wanted to be the first to win four. 
</P>
<P>
But she had not won an NHRA national event since the World Finals of 1983 at 
Orange County Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
Then, 10 days ago, Muldowney returned to Phoenix for the Fallnationals, and on 
the same Firebird strip where she tested herself nearly four years ago, she 
beat Darrell Gwynn in the final run. 
</P>
<P>
Now she was completely back. Well, almost completely. She still harbors 
thoughts of winning that fourth championship, even though she will turn 50 next 
June. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot left in terms of potential," she said. "We couldn't really use 
all the horsepower we had. What I enjoyed most was that I proved I still had my 
reflexes. I won the last three rounds when my opponents (Gene Snow, world 
champion Joe Amato and Gwynn) ran quicker than I did. I beat them off the 
(starting) line." 
</P>
<P>
The win was Muldowney's 18th in national competition and she ranks it right up 
there with the one in the 1982 U.S. Nationals at Indianapolis where she 
defeated Connie Kalitta, her former lover and crew chief, and the final round 
of the 1980 Winston World Finals at Ontario, where her victory gave her a 
second world championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Phoenix was wonderful, but they're all special," she said. "What made Phoenix 
so memorable was how gracious Darrell (Gwynn) was after I beat him. He was such 
a sportsman, such a gentleman. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got out of our cars, he came over to me with a big smile on his face 
and said, 'Shirley, you welded me.' He was so happy to see me win again, it was 
written all over his face." 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, Muldowney will be at the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds in 
Pomona, racing her top-fuel dragster in the 25th annual Winston Finals, last of 
the year's 19-race schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Her opponents should beware: It doesn't pay to get Shirley riled up. 
</P>
<P>
When she feels that someone is messing with her psyche, she responds with a 
championship performance. 
</P>
<P>
The low point of the year, perhaps of her career -- other than the crippling 
accident -- occurred last September in the U.S. Nationals at Indianapolis when 
she failed to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't imagine how low we felt after a back-breaker like that," she said. 
"But it was nothing compared to what happened the day after we got home in 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"A box of a dozen long-stemmed roses were delivered to me. They were 
spray-painted black, with a note that read, 'You have finally faced reality.' I 
was so upset -- it was such a hateful thing to do -- that I went right down to 
the flower shop and demanded to know where they came from. They wouldn't tell 
me the name of the sender, but they said they came from Corpus Christi, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't have to be a brain surgeon to figure that out." 
</P>
<P>
Corpus Christi is the home of Lori Johns, who is challenging Muldowney's 
position as the No. 1 female driver in male-dominated competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never forgiven her for the lawsuit she filed against nearly everyone in 
drag racing after an accident in 1986, and she knows it," Muldowney said. 
</P>
<P>
Johns was injured while racing in the competition eliminator class at the Cajun 
Nationals in Baton Rouge, La., and her family sued the opposing driver, Jim Van 
Cleve; his car owner, Kenny Bernstein and King Entertainment; Bernstein's 
sponsor, Budweiser; and the sanctioning body, the NHRA. The suit was later 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had words, and I told her in writing not to take credit for things she 
didn't accomplish," Muldowney said. "She claimed in a press release that she 
was the top woman in drag racing. She hasn't won a thing and I'd won 17 
nationals at the time." 
</P>
<P>
This season, Johns, 23, is sixth with 8,524 points and Muldowney ninth with 
7,396 after 18 of the 19 rounds in the Winston series. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'll never forget this last thing," Muldowney said. "I know we did poorly 
at Indy, but I don't like having my nose rubbed in it." 
</P>
<P>
The next race was the Keystone Nationals, in Mahnton, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
"Rohn (Tobler, her husband and crew chief) and the guys were at the bottom, but 
we wouldn't have missed that race for the world. We were steaming, and when we 
got there we ran 4.97 right out of the box and backed it up for a national 
record." 
</P>
<P>
In the quarterfinal round, she lost to Amato in the quickest side-by-side race 
in history, 4.967 seconds to 4.975. It was also the fastest run in her career, 
287.81 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been this excited at a drag race, after losing," she said. "This is 
history, and I'm a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Another incident, she said, stimulated her before her comeback victory Oct. 15 
in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the guys, who I choose not to identify, was out of it but he wandered 
out to the starting line and got in my vision. I knew he was trying to bug me, 
but it only made me concentrate more. If guys think they can get to me that 
way, they're sadly mistaken. It only makes me try harder." 
</P>
<P>
The result was her winning run against Gwynn, ending a six-year losing stretch. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't pay to get the lady mad. 
</P>
<P>
One of the fascinating facets of Muldowney's season was her employment of her 
one-time archrival, Garlits, as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Garlits, who has not raced since an accident more than two years ago in 
Spokane, Wash., joined Tobler and the Performance Automotive Wholesale crew in 
Atlanta before the Southern Nationals in April. 
</P>
<P>
"Garlits definitely helped us on the road back," Muldowney said. "It was a team 
deal. We all put our heads together and took our ideas, and his ideas, and came 
up with a combination of everything. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, he made a lot of contributions, but at Phoenix it was pretty much our 
combo. Garlits wasn't there, but we had some of his ideas incorporated into 
what we dialed in." 
</P>
<P>
As a thank-you for Garlits' input, the team put him in Shirley's car at Dallas 
for a try at the Cragar 4-Second Club membership. Big Daddy came close, 5.07 
seconds and 287.81 m.p.h., the quickest and fastest runs of his legendary 
career even though he missed the 4-Second Club. 
</P>
<P>
"The track (condition) wasn't there for him," Muldowney said. "I have no doubt 
he would have run a 4 if conditions were right. The car wasn't built for him, 
and he had it right on the ragged edge. I think he did a masterful job." 
</P>
<P>
Garlits, who will be at Pomona this week, working with the Diamond P television 
crew, said he felt he got as much from working with Muldowney's crew as it did 
from him. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are changing so much, I couldn't believe how electronics and things 
like that have progressed in two years," Garlits said from his drag racing 
museum in Ocala, Fla. "Making that run was absolutely phenomenal. That 5.07 was 
a full two-tenths quicker that I'd ever run and 287 was 12 miles faster. It was 
a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as my contribution to what Shirley did, it was mostly toward 
conservation of the parts. Her boys know how to make her go fast, but it seemed 
it was always blowing a head gasket or something like that. I gave them more of 
a conservative approach." 
</P>
<P>
Garlits still harbors thoughts of coming back to the top-fuel wars. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got all the parts I need to build a car right here. If I can get some 
sponsorship money, I'll build a car and come to Pomona (for the Winternationals 
in February). 
</P>
<P>
"I'd still like to take another shot at four seconds." 
</P>
<P>
The speeds approaching 300 m.p.h. that Muldowney hopes to attain in her 
top-fuel dragster will pale alongside what she achieved last year at Seattle, 
where she flew in a Blue Angels F-18 jet at 650 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to fly, especially commercial planes, but when I was invited to 
go up with Lt. Doug McClain, it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," she 
said. "My word, how could I turn down a chance to fly an aircraft that cost $18 
million? 
</P>
<P>
"It was an experience like I never thought existed. Nothing in driving a race 
car can compare with it. It's as far removed as black is from white. Any race 
driver who tells you that the two can be compared is pulling your leg. 
</P>
<P>
"The G forces (pressure on the body caused by acceleration) were incredible. I 
really concentrated in our briefing session because if you don't keep yourself 
together, it will black you out in an instant. I was up for an hour and when 
Lt. McClain told me to take the controls, I was able to stretch it out and bank 
it, but when he said to roll it, I told him I couldn't do it. Just taking hold 
of the controls made me a little queasy. 
</P>
<P>
"The wildest part of the hour was when we took off. We pulled off, maybe no 
more than 50 feet off the ground when suddenly we headed straight up. All the 
way to 40,000 feet. It was the most unbelievable pressure I ever felt in my 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"When you hear someone say something was breathtaking, now that was it. No race 
car in the world can do that to you." 
</P>
<P>
Muldowney has won twice at Pomona, in the 1980 and 1983 Winternationals. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the Pomona track," she said. "I can't tell you exactly why, but there's 
something about it that is special. Of course, if you win in the spring, it 
gets the year off to a fabulous start for you, your crew, your sponsors and 
everybody. And if you win the fall race, it gives you and your crew a good 
feeling through the off-season and gives you a lift in getting ready for next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"The track is a little short (in the run-off area), but overall, the people at 
NHRA have become masterful at preparing the track. It's certainly one of the 
best we run on." 
</P>
<P>
This will be Muldowney's last race of a four-year sponsorship and although she 
has a new car on order from Al Swindahl, who built her current model, she says 
she needs $1 million to run the NHRA's 19-race schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"We have so much to offer, we can't stop now," she said. "With a new car, and 
the engines running the way they are, I don't think that fourth world 
championship is out of sight." 
</P>
<P>
She's not in the running this year but is rooting for Gary Ormsby to win his 
first top-fuel championship against two-time champion Amato. Ormsby holds a 
narrow lead, 13,828 points to 13,258. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe (Amato) is a good friend of mine, but from a selfish standpoint I'll be 
rooting for Ormsby because I want Garlits and I to still be the only three-time 
champions." 
</P>
<P>
The left foot, which Muldowney almost lost, still bothers her almost 
constantly. She can walk only short distances and fights to keep from limping. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a bone in the ankle that actually is moving around," she said. "It 
can't be fused, or pinned. It just floats around, and when my ankle is at 
certain angles, the pain is almost unbearable." 
</P>
<P>
She used to say when she was recuperating and she and Tobler were engaged, that 
she would never get married until she could walk down the aisle in high-heeled 
shoes. But she finally changed her mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I wore black bedroom slippers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She hasn't lost that urge for high heels, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I love to go into shoe stores and try on high heels," she said. "When the 
clerk asks me if I want to walk around to see if I want them, I say, 'No 
thanks, I'm just looking.' "

TAGLIABUE COMES UP 3 VOTES SHORT OF SELECTION 
</P>

<P>
The National Football League's owners are still three votes shy of electing 
anyone as commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, needing 19 votes to win, Jim Finks could get only 16. 
</P>
<P>
And in the balloting here, Paul Tagliabue could get only 16 Tuesday, when Finks 
dropped to 11. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers suggest that Tagliabue, an NFL lawyer, might finally be selected on 
an early ballot today, after the voting resumes at 6 a.m., PDT. 
</P>
<P>
But that isn't necessarily so. 
</P>
<P>
The Finks 11 seem solidly behind their candidate, a 30-year NFL man who runs 
the New Orleans Saints' front office. 
</P>
<P>
The Tagliabue group, while larger, seems softer. Five of the 16 Tagliabue 
voters on Tuesday's final ballot abstained on one or more of the day's earlier 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
They finally chose the Washington lawyer not necessarily because they want him, 
but simply in a futile try to break the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
Raider owner Al Davis, who was here for a while, checked out early, enabling 
the 27 who remained to split, 16-11. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Charger President Alex Spanos also departed Tuesday night, meaning 
that only 26 ownerships will be represented this morning, with 19 votes still 
needed to elect. Spanos had voted for Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
The other Southern California club owner, Georgia Frontiere of the Rams, also 
voted for Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Commissioner Pete Rozelle said the league has several options: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Conceivably, either Finks or Tagliabue could withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Both could be shelved while the league hunts for a compromise candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Both could be included in a restructured NFL leadership plan of some kind. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One could be elected. 
</P>
<P>
Restructuring isn't likely today. But Tagliabue's backers -- largely drawn from 
the ranks of new owners who have been fighting the old-guard owners since last 
March -- were quietly contacting compromise candidates during the day. 
</P>
<P>
They were on the phone with, among others, Housing and Urban Development 
Secretary Jack Kemp and New Jersey Meadowlands Manager Robert Mulcahy. 
</P>
<P>
"If (the owners) can't decide between the two candidates (today), they'll have 
to go outside for somebody else," Rozelle said. "We have no other choices." 
</P>
<P>
But first, at a Cleveland hotel, Rozelle and the leaders of the Tagliabue group 
were spending early Wednesday trying to convert at least three of the Finks 
voters they needed to break the deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
Finks' backers argue that Tagliabue's backers don't really want Tagliabue, 
they're just against Finks. 
</P>
<P>
But Tagliabue's backers don't appear to be against Finks as much as they seem 
to be against the old-guard committee that originally nominated Finks last 
July. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't a single vote for Tagliabue at either of the first two meetings 
the league has had in its seven-month hunt for a new commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
The current 11 Finks backers include club owners from Chicago, Phoenix, New 
Orleans, Washington, Kansas City, Cincinnati, Buffalo, Cleveland, Atlanta and 
the New York Giants and Jets.

RAMS' MAJOR PROBLEM MAY BE INEFFECTIVE RUNNING GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The other day, when Coach Buddy Ryan of the Philadelphia Eagles was talking 
about the 1988 Washington Redskins, he could have meant the 1989 Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"(The Redskins) didn't have a running game last year, and that really hurt 
their defensive team," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't control the ball without a running game. When you can't make first 
downs, you've got to punt it, and that keeps piling more pressure on your 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
For the Rams Sunday, that's what went wrong in the New Orleans game. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of their two-game losing streak, the focus this week has been 
on the Rams' pass-defense deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
But it's more likely that the real problem is their ineffective running attack. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints largely ignored running back Greg Bell and went after quarterback 
Jim Everett vigorously, knocking him around and jarring the Ram pass offense 
off stride. 
</P>
<P>
The same things had happened in the Monday night game at Buffalo, where Bell 
didn't run far, either. 
</P>
<P>
That stopped the Ram offense, putting the ball in the hands of the Bills, who 
wore down the Ram defense. 
</P>
<P>
With the kind of blockers they have, this has been another season in which the 
Rams have been productive running Bell against mediocre defenses but not 
against top defenses. 
</P>
<P>
And the irony, of course, is that their coach, John Robinson, is a running-play 
expert. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Robinson has also come to realize that you can't run your way 
to the Super Bowl, and so, now, he is stressing the pass. 
</P>
<P>
Which may not leave time enough to polish the student body right in the old 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Rams' crying need is for a running back who can burst through for 
important yardage on fake-pass plays when the defense overloads against 
Everett. 
</P>
<P>
Getting Gaston Green in the Eric Dickerson trade didn't do it. 
</P>
<P>
On a typical day of NFL football, 12 of last Sunday's 13 winners were the teams 
that outgained the other side on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The only good running team that lost to a passer was Seattle. And Denver won 
that one when, on a Seahawk field-goal try, the snapper snapped the ball into 
the holder's head when the holder wasn't looking. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Steve DeBerg, who passed for 237 yards as Kansas City defeated 
Dallas, 36-28, said the difference in his game was running back Christian 
Okoye. 
</P>
<P>
"Dallas looked at him on every down, and that opened up the passing game," 
DeBerg said. 
</P>
<P>
After winning, most NFL quarterbacks say as much, or think as much. 
</P>
<P>
All five of the league's leading ground-gainers Sunday played on winning teams. 
</P>
<P>
Only three of the top five passers won. 
</P>
<P>
Running problems this year are bringing down, among others, the AFC champion 
Cincinnati Bengals. The Bengals (4-3) still have passer Boomer Esiason, but 
they lost their running game when they lost Ickey Woods to injury. 
</P>
<P>
In the NFC, Minnesota just gave up half the farm for a running back, Herschel 
Walker. 
</P>
<P>
"You win with the pass -- but if you can't run, you can't pass," said George 
Young, general manager of the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
That's the NFL today. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Redskins are coming into the Coliseum Sunday with one of the 
NFL's best running teams, having outgained Tampa Bay on the ground last week, 
179 yards to 1. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, the Raiders will have a shot against an Eastern contender, 
because Washington has lost its most valuable defensive player, cornerback 
Darrell Green, who was injured in the second half of the Buccaneer game. 
</P>
<P>
Even with Green this year, the Redskins were having defensive troubles. Without 
him, they gave up three touchdown passes to Tampa Bay in the fourth quarter as 
Buccaneer quarterback Vinny Testaverde came close at the end, 32-28. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Green's injury) helped us out," Testaverde said. "He's a great 
player." 
</P>
<P>
From Philadelphia, here's Ryan on the Redskins: 
</P>
<P>
"What they do is, they go out and get the best people money can buy. Wilber 
Marshall is the best outside right linebacker in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"The Redskins go out and they got one of the best offensive tackles in the 
league last year, Jim Lachey. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, they go out and get two experienced, excellent running backs, 
Earnest Byner and Gerald Riggs. 
</P>
<P>
"They get proven, quality players who know how to play the pro game, so that 
makes them tough." 
</P>
<P>
Testaverde's improvement in his third pro season is one of the stories of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
It was Testaverde who earlier this month put the Chicago Bears into their 
three-game slide, and, otherwise, his interceptions are down and his touchdown 
passes up for a club that was surprisingly batting .500 last week going into 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm more of a quarterback now than the thrower I was last year," 
Testaverde said. 
</P>
<P>
"I throw the ball low or away when I have to, rather than force it. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm sacked, I (usually) hold the ball. Last year, I threw it and it got 
intercepted." 
</P>
<P>
With some experience, that's what they all say. 
</P>
<P>
"When Vinny matures a little more, we'll have a great quarterback," Tampa Bay 
owner Hugh Culverhouse said. 
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota Vikings, not long ago, were two games behind the Bears. Today, 
contemplating the Giants in one of the big Monday night games of the year next 
week, the 5-2 Vikings are one up on the Bears in their division, and only one 
behind the flying Giants in the NFC. 
</P>
<P>
And their coach, Jerry Burns, has one explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got two winning quarterbacks," he said, identifying starter Wade Wilson 
and backup Tommy Kramer. "That's what it takes." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson is expected to be on the sidelines in the Meadowlands with two screws in 
the broken knuckle of his left ring finger, and without him, the Vikings are 
less menacing. 
</P>
<P>
Against a team like the Giants, most NFC coaches and scouts, based on their 
preseason views, would start Wilson instead of Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
But Minnesota's outspoken players, who will take sides on anything, seem happy 
enough with Kramer, who is 2-0 this month after Wilson's 3-2 start. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we can count on Tommy," Pro Bowl receiver Anthony Carter told 
Minneapolis reporters. "He gets it going in the huddle. Not taking anything 
away from (Wilson), but the guys seem to react a little better to Tommy." 
</P>
<P>
That is an opinion that coincides, more or less, with Kramer's. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we lose a thing when I come in," Kramer said. "It's a luxury to 
have two quarterbacks." 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco 49ers also win with two quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Young replaced injured starter Joe Montana at halftime last week and 
completed 11 of 12 passes for 188 yards -- more than Montana got -- as the 
49ers turned back New England, 37-20. 
</P>
<P>
Said Patriot Coach Raymond Berry: "That's the tremendous strength of their 
team, a one-two punch at quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have also used two quarterbacks, with limited success. Jay 
Schroeder and Steve Beuerlein are one-two, or two-one. 
</P>
<P>
The Beuerlein-Willie Gault touchdown in Philadelphia Sunday, on a 24-yard pass 
into the end zone, was the only really professional play of an unspectacular, 
windswept game. 
</P>
<P>
More than ever these days, the Eagles' highly predictable offense is holding 
back quarterback Randall Cunningham, who accomplished hardly anything in the 
victory over the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to change our philosophy a little bit," Cunningham told reporters 
this week. "We're at a point right now where people know what we're doing. I 
think we're always coming out to establish the running game." 
</P>
<P>
That's the way it looks, and that's the way Ryan, a conservative, wants it, 
perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
But one rule of thumb in football coaching is that the strategy should be 
adapted to the personnel. And this year, the Eagles are hardly doing that. 
</P>
<P>
Their offensive coordinator, Ted Plumb, weighs in each week with particularly 
uninspired game plans. 
</P>
<P>
They have three assets in Philadelphia -- a superior coach in Ryan and two 
great players in Cunningham and defensive end Reggie White -- but a plodding 
offense can nullify the best of talent. 
</P>
<P>
Contemplating the score of the Raider game, 10-7, Ryan said: "It doesn't seem 
like we played that good." 
</P>
<P>
He was right again.

FIGHT BETWEEN BILLS' ASSISTANTS STARTS AS THEY WATCH TEAM FILMS

<P>
One day after one Buffalo Bills' assistant punched another as they watched team 
videotapes, the coaches involved tried to play down the altercation Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But wide receivers coach Nick Nicolau, a former Raider assistant, confirmed 
Monday's altercation that led to offensive line coach Tom Bresnahan receiving 
several stitches. 
</P>
<P>
The fight apparently began when Nicolau decked Bresnahan with a solid uppercut 
and then grabbed Bresnahan in a headlock and drove his head into a wall in the 
team's administration building. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, Bresnahan walked through the Rich Stadium locker room carrying a bag 
of ice, his face swollen and a bandage the size of a baseball card on his chin. 
He wore sunglasses that didn't quite cover the shiner under his right eye. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had any comment on the confrontation, Bresnahan said, "Not at all." 
He did say he felt better when asked about his condition. 
</P>
<P>
Added Nicolau: "Everything is fine. That's all I can say." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the two were on speaking terms, Nicolau said, "We've always been on 
speaking terms." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, according to Coach Marv Levy, the two had lived together for a while 
after joining the team before the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Tom and Nick are close friends," Levy told the Buffalo News Monday 
night. "Their wives are close friends. They (the coaches) lived together for 
four or five months in the off-season." 
</P>
<P>
While there was no official word on what triggered the fight, one club employee 
said Bresnahan had argued with the other assistants during practice this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"He tries to coach every position," the employee said. "It was building up for 
a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Levy said he was in his office while the assistants watched the films. The 
Bills beat the New York Jets, 34-3, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked (Tom) what happened and he said, 'I had an accident,' " Levy said. "He 
didn't want to say any more than that, and I didn't ask him any more about it."

RAMS CAN WIPE SLATE CLEAN IF THEY CAN GET PAST BEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That blackboard the Rams return to this week is so full of chalk marks that 
there is hardly room to write, "Help!" 
</P>
<P>
With surprising ease, the Rams have misplaced their ability to tackle, cover 
opposing receivers, rush the passer, hold on to gimme interceptions, run the 
football, punt, protect the quarterback and keep players free of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, Coach John Robinson says things are going hunky-dory. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are 5-2 and losers of two in a row as they enter a wicked little 
stretch that includes the Chicago Bears at usually frigid Soldier Field, the 
Minnesota Vikings at the always loud Metrodome and the New York Giants at 
perennially quiet Anaheim Stadium. In short, the National Football League's 
Dead Man's Curve of scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
If the Rams don't watch it, they could be 5-5 by mid-November -- and wouldn't 
that take some explaining. From undefeated to unwanted, all in five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
What the Rams need now is a clean eraser and -- surprise -- the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
You read it right. The Bears. Monsters of the Midway. The team that George 
Halas built. The team that Mike Ditka stokes with shovels full of anger. 
</P>
<P>
In a quirk of fates, both the Rams and the Bears are headed in similar 
directions, mainly down in the standings. You know about the Rams' problems. 
Multiply them by two and you have the Bears' current situation. 
</P>
<P>
One more loss and Ditka might need to guzzle some of that antifreeze he hawks 
on the tube, the better to coat his stomach with. His offense is as dull as 
Shakespeare in the park. His defense, or what's left of it, was most recently 
roasted by that offensive powerhouse, the Cleveland Browns, who had scored a 
whopping 17 points in their previous two games. And at last glance at the 
medical charts, the Bears were missing defensive linemen Dan Hampton, Richard 
Dent and first-round draft choice Trace Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
Rams vs. Bears? Clash of the Titans, it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
For the Rams, such Bear difficulties couldn't come at a better time. If ever 
they needed the kindness of strangers, this is it. Nor does it hurt the Rams' 
confidence to know that they have beaten the Bears four out of their past five 
meetings, including a 23-3 victory in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson can't wait to play the Bears. He can't wait to see how his team reacts 
to the pressure of two consecutive defeats, to the whispers that maybe the Rams 
aren't quite as good as everyone believed them to be. He counts the days until 
the Rams, embarrassed by Sunday's loss to the New Orleans Saints, receive a 
chance to quiet the doubts. 
</P>
<P>
"I like this team," he says. "I like it a lot. But we have to find out what 
type of resiliency we've got." 
</P>
<P>
They had better hurry. There are only so many games you can fall behind the San 
Francisco 49ers before you simply wave goodby to the NFC West title. And there 
are only so many times you can play as the Rams are playing right now -- 
listlessly, carelessly and non-aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
Some midweek predictions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Rams will run the ball until they drop Sunday. Or more correctly, until 
the Bears drop. The days of finesse football, a word Robinson uses with 
disdain, are officially finished. Robinson wants his team to make a statement 
and he knows of no louder way than by stampede, not air travel. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Ram defense will be different in both style and substance. Maybe not 
better, just changed. Robinson isn't divulging any state secrets these days, 
but his hints of a shakeup are not to be ignored. Something needs to be done 
and something will. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Rams will not suffer from the same pregame blahs that contributed to 
Sunday's loss. Strangely enough, Robinson, known throughout the league for his 
motivational expertise, was unsure as to how to cure what ailed his team that 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't think of anything to do," he says. "Pull out a gun and shoot 
myself? Pull out a gun and shoot somebody else?" 
</P>
<P>
No such worries this week. At the first sign of team lethargy, Robinson likely 
will deliver a little oratorical goody before the Rams take the field against 
the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll play our butts off, you can bet on that," Robinson says. "We'll play 
good, too." 
</P>
<P>
Nine games remain on the Rams' regular-season schedule. Of those games, 
Robinson says his team will play well in eight of the nine. If that's the case, 
then the Rams had better start immediately with a vulnerable Bear team. Beat 
the Bears and all is forgiven, or at least, overlooked. Lose to the Bears and 
an opportunity is lost with it. 
</P>
<P>
An opportunity to erase, "Help!"

Seldom have Los Angeles sports teams fared so miserably. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the Trojans, Bruins, Rams and Raiders all fall on their facemasks 
on the same weekend, but the Clippers failed to get rid of center Benoit 
Benjamin. Although no local teams sullied the Coliseum, that arena didn't 
escape ignominy, either. Singer Axl Rose fell off the stage during a concert 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, one week after Fitchburg State ended its 36-game losing streak, the 
University of the District of Columbia put a 25-game streak of misfortune on 
the line against Livingstone of North Carolina (1-4). 
</P>
<P>
"(Livingstone's players) were doing a lot of jawing before the game," UDC's 
Willie Wood Jr. said later. Final score: UDC 14, Livingstone 10. Most 
embarrassed team in the nation? Livingstone, we presume.

The Pros 
</P>
<P>
If Dancing Bears Coach Mike Ditka offers you any tips on what stocks to buy, 
pay attention. This man obviously can see the future. 
</P>
<P>
When Chicago fell to Houston two weekends ago, Ditka raised the question of 
whether the Bears were capable of winning another game this season. "I don't 
think we are," he concluded. 
</P>
<P>
And the Bears went right out and got beat up by Cleveland, 7-27. The Bears 
couldn't stop the rushing game of Cleveland quarterback Bernie Kosar, who ran 
for one yard to hike his 4 1/2-year total to 75. Chicago, which now has 
suffered three straight setbacks for the first time under Ditka, is 4-3, going 
on 4-12. 
</P>
<P>
Blooper-of-the-week award went to Seattle center Grant Feasel, who snapped the 
ball too soon on a field-goal try. It bounced off the helmet of holder Jeff 
Kemp, who wasn't looking. Officials in the instant replay booth ruled that the 
ball then fell short of the end zone, and off to the right.

<TEXT>
<P>
John Matuszak, the former Los Angeles Raider who died of an accidental overdose 
of painkiller last summer, left most of his estate to his mother and three 
sisters in Wisconsin but his Super Bowl rings will go to his nephews. 
</P>
<P>
Matuszak, a former all-pro defensive end noted for his aggression on the field, 
his flamboyance off it and his nickname, the Tooz, named his mother, Audrey 
Matuszak of Oak Creek, Wis., as his representative in the will formally filed 
in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The will was signed July 13, 1984, and in it Matuszak left his championship 
ring from Super Bowl XI to nephew Justin Evancy, and his ring from Super Bowl 
XV to Justin's brother, Luke Evancy. 
</P>
<P>
Matuszak also left the contents of his house in Franklin, Wis., to his sister, 
the boys' mother, Christine Evancy. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of his estate, $230,000 in personal property, $217,000 in real 
property and $10,000 in income from that property, was left to his mother and 
his sisters, Karen and Dawn Matuszak. 
</P>
<P>
Matuszak, 38, died in June at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Burbank. The 
county coroner's office found that his death had resulted from an accidental 
overdose of a narcotic painkiller, aggravated by an enlarged heart and 
pneumonia.

TYSON-HOLYFIELD FIGHT DRAWS SOMEWHAT CLOSER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The long-awaited Mike Tyson-Evander Holyfield heavyweight championship fight 
might be closer than Tyson's promoter, Don King, has recently indicated. 
</P>
<P>
In a TV interview taped by Showtime for showing during Holyfield's Nov. 4 fight 
with Alex Stewart, King said he and Tyson, the heavyweight champion, want 
Holyfield "in the very near future." 
</P>
<P>
King said, according to Reuters, that "there are only two pay-per-view dates to 
go on -- June or November -- and so Evander Holyfield certainly will be one of 
them, preferably June." 
</P>
<P>
Both Tyson (37-0) and Holyfield (22-0) have November fights. Tyson will defend 
his championship Nov. 18 in Edmonton, Canada, against Razor Ruddock. 
</P>
<P>
During a Beverly Hills news conference in August, King indicated that 
Tyson-Holyfield might not take place until 1991, adding that Tyson might fight 
Michael Dokes, Ruddock, Buster Douglas and George Foreman before Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
Many, however, saw it as a King ploy, an attempt to drive a wedge between 
Holyfield and his manager, Ken Sanders, on the one hand, and Holyfield's 
promoters, Dan and Kathy Duva, on the other. That way, King wouldn't have to 
share the promotion's revenues with the Duvas. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers believe that a Tyson-Holyfield pay-per-view showdown could be 
boxing's first $100-million fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Tyson-Holyfield is going to be a rich fight, but it's not ready yet," King 
said Aug. 3 in Beverly Hills. "Just to say they got an undefeated fighter . . . 
that's not enough. You've got to develop it, promote it, and that's what we'll 
be doing over these next few fights. The Holyfield people, they don't know how 
to do that." 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, a possible thaw might have begun in the King-Duva feud. In 
another long-awaited matchup, King's Mexican superstar, Julio Cesar Chavez, and 
the Duvas' Meldrick Taylor were paired, after months of acrimonious 
negotiations, for a March 17 junior-welterweight unification title fight at the 
Las Vegas Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
Also, King may have been nudged toward a Tyson-Holyfield bout by the World

Olympic champion Carl Lewis has begun legal action against a West German 
magazine and a Canadian cable network for reporting that he used 
performance-enhancing drugs, according to a report in today's New York Times. 
Toronto lawyer Timothy Danson has sent letters seeking a retraction, an apology 
and damages from Stern magazine and The Sports Network, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
Under Canadian law, plaintiffs are required to notify defendants of pending 
legal action, then must file suit within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
Also being notified is Darrell Robinson, the former American 400-meter champion 
who accused Lewis of using drugs in the Stern story, and Bill Watters, a 
commentator on TSN, who according to Danson said on the program "The Sports 
Page" that Lewis used drugs.

TELEVANGELISTS -- Orange County names abound in the just-published "Forgiven: 
The Rise and Fall of Jim Bakker and the PTL Ministry," by Charles E. Shepard, 
Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for the Charlotte Observer. . . . Among them is 
Paul Crouch, who with Bakker founded Trinity Broadcasting Network in Tustin in 
1973. . . . Things got so acrimonious before the televangelists' final split, 
Shepard writes, that Bakker prepared to fight an on-air coup by Crouch, 
suggesting an associate be "poised to kill the audio and fade to black . . . if 
Crouch tried anything." (A1) Dana Parsons and Rick VanderKnyff

STARS BEHIND BARS: Zsa Zsa Gabor's trial (A1) recalls another celebrity legal 
circus. . . . In 1921, silent film star Bebe Daniels drew a 10-day sentence 
after becoming the first woman convicted of speeding in Orange County. Her stay 
in the county slammer was less than a hardship, as a local furniture store 
delivered a bedroom suite and a band played beneath her window in the evenings. 
. . . Daniels displayed something of Gabor's imperial air: "I suppose if you 
live in a small town you get like that," she said of the sentencing judge. "I 
bet 56.5 m.p.h. sounds awfully fast if you've never driven anything faster than 
a plow." Dana Parsons and Rick VanderKnyff

O.C. SENDS 12 EXPERTS TO AID QUAKE WORKERS IN THE BAY AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE ELLEN O'CONNOR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County by late Tuesday had dispatched a team of 12 experts, including 
structural and civil engineers, building inspectors and a geologist, to help 
assess the earthquake damage in the Bay Area, which may result in a temporary 
slowdown of building inspections in the county, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The team, which included 11 county employees and a former county employee who 
volunteered his services, is needed in San Francisco for critical tasks ranging 
from determining whether homes are safe to occupy to determining any lingering 
hazards on bridges and roadways, Orange County officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald J. Novello, director of regulations for the county's Environmental 
Management Agency, said the team represents about a fifth of his engineering 
staff and about 10% of his building inspection staff. The employees' absence, 
he said, will slow down the processing of building plans from private 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
"This will affect production by about 10% to 20% and may cause us to slip 
(behind) on our schedule two or three days," Novello said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known how long the team would be needed in Northern California, but 
the county will be reimbursed by the state for the salary and expenses of those 
employees sent to the disaster area, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency management officials worked around the clock Monday and Tuesday to 
round up engineers from both the public and private sector. But they revised 
earlier estimates that another 80 engineers would be sent to the Bay Area on 
Thursday, saying they have yet to get a formal request for more help. 
</P>
<P>
As for the shortage of building inspectors and engineers in Orange County, John 
W. Sibley of the county administrative office said: "Essentially we'll just 
double up here with the (staff) that's left, which is not atypical of an 
emergency response. . . . I can assure you our workload will be covered, but 
our first concern is the emergency."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; 
</P>
<P>
NEW WELFARE OFFICE DECISION POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday postponed until January a decision on 
financing a full-service welfare office in Laguna Hills to serve more than 600 
welfare recipients living in South County. 
</P>
<P>
Financing for the Social Services Agency office in the 25200 block of McIntrye 
Street in Laguna Hills became an issue late last month after county officials 
closed down a small welfare office in San Juan Capistrano, forcing welfare 
applicants to go instead to an office in Costa Mesa. However, the San Juan 
Capistrano office was reopened less than a week later. 
</P>
<P>
County welfare officials said they originally decided to close the office 
because its three eligibility workers were overwhelmed by the workload, and 
that welfare recipients could be better served in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley said the county had earlier 
considered financing the Laguna Hills office but the request had been rejected 
in August because of budget constraints. 
</P>
<P>
Riley spokeswoman Susan Hinman said Tuesday that the supervisors delayed the 
decision until January, when they will receive a midyear financial report from 
the County Administrative Office. If the funds are approved in January for the 
Laguna Hills office, it may not be in full operation until June. 
</P>
<P>
A report received by the supervisors Tuesday said the new Laguna Hills office 
would cost $116,987, and expanding it to a full-service office would require 60 
days of planning and 10 new staff members. 
</P>
<P>
The funds will be used to hire new welfare workers to staff the office. A 
6,000-square-foot building has already been leased by the county. 
</P>
<P>
Riley has vowed to lobby to get the funds to open the full-service office. "The 
supervisor is very serious about getting the office," Hinman said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors voted 5-0 to defer the action until January. They all have agreed 
not to propose any programs that would spend money from the county's general 
fund until a financial examination of the county is done after the first of the 
year. GEORGE FRANK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
BEACH STILL CLOSED FROM SEWAGE SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A half-mile mile strip of shoreline with private access near Laguna Beach 
remained closed to swimmers Tuesday after the weekend rupture of a sewage pipe 
that leaked about 5,000 gallons of effluent into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
County health officials said the beach at Emerald Bay would probably stay 
closed until the end of the week. However, it could reopen as early as today if 
water samples taken regularly since the Friday spill show a drop in effluent 
levels, said Michael Wehner, water quality program chief for the Orange County 
health department. 
</P>
<P>
Wehner said the beach was closed as a precautionary measure because sewage 
contamination can cause gastrointestinal disease. However, he said he did not 
expect the spill to pose a danger to marine life. 
</P>
<P>
The spill was the first to close the beach at Emerald Bay, according to Bob 
Blankenship, a maintenance worker who helped repair the eight-inch pipe beneath 
Coast Highway. The pipe is less than a mile north of McKnight Drive. 
</P>
<P>
A foot-long crack was discovered in the pipe at about 6 p.m. Friday, 
Blankenship said. 
</P>
<P>
He said crews worked for 24 hours to dam the end of the drain and pump sewage 
from the beach. Rain on Saturday broke the dam and forced workers to redo the 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The sewage pipes are maintained by a private association at Emerald Bay and do 
not fall under city jurisdiction, county health officials said. TAMMERLIN

COUNCIL UNITES ON ANTI-DRUG PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a rare show of unanimity, the City Council has supported an ordinance that 
would bar felony drug offenders from publicly subsidized housing in Mission 
Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The often-divided council voted Monday night to back the proposed law in 
concept and send it to City Atty. Scott Fox for review. His recommendation will 
be heard by the council at its Nov. 27 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor William S. Craycraft, who announced the proposal at a community anti-drug 
rally Saturday, said it "felt good to receive the support of the council." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed law would also force all residents with felony drug records to 
register at the Laguna Niguel station of the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ordinance would empower city officials to place liens on homes 
where drug activity occurs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great idea," Councilman Norman P. Murray said. "We've got to 
get off the dime and get moving on this." 
</P>
<P>
While backing the proposed ordinance, council members Christian W. Keena and 
Robert A. Curtis, both attorneys, cautioned the city to move slowly because of 
potential legal complications. 
</P>
<P>
"We pay good money for legal counsel," Keena said. "I would like to receive 
input from the city attorney before we act." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Orange County homeless shelters said Monday that they are 
uneasy about the proposal because they fear that other cities will follow 
Mission Viejo's lead by passing similar laws. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if a man has been convicted of a drug crime, what do we do with him?" 
asked Jim Lands, executive director of the Orange County Rescue Mission. "If 
you deny these people housing, they're going to sleep in the streets and 
defecate in driveways." 
</P>
<P>
Warren Johnson, an administrator for the 145-bed Salvation Army shelter in 
Anaheim, said the law is unfair because it apparently does not separate 
one-time offenders from habitual criminals. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems not to address the individual," he said. "I would like to think we 
live in a forgiving world. I would feel very uncomfortable with this law." 
</P>
<P>
Other county officials, who did not wish to be identified, did not see the need 
for targeting housing projects in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials said they could not provide any figures on 
affordable-housing projects, the Orange County Housing Authority said 14 
families receive subsidies under the main federal housing assistance program in 
Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Craycraft said that if only one drug dealer were kept out of the city, the 
ordinance would be a success. 
</P>
<P>
"Any steps we can take are worthwhile," the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
He expressed sympathy for families and recovering addicts who would be affected 
by the ordinance, but said that "with all due respect to those who need 
assistance, I think the needs of Mission Viejo take precedence over those who 
abuse drugs. We are determined to make this city a drug-free zone." FRANK

CURTIS RECALL EFFORT NEARS SIGNATURE GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County officials who are reviewing petitions for recalling Mission Viejo City 
Councilman Robert A. Curtis verified several hundred additional signatures 
Tuesday, bringing recall supporters to the brink of the number needed to force 
a recall election. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the latest count, Curtis all but conceded that the latest tally 
of signatures means he will probably face a recall election next year. 
</P>
<P>
Final word is expected today. 
</P>
<P>
The number of verified signatures is growing as officials comb through the 
petitions, searching for valid signatures that were overlooked during the first 
review. 
</P>
<P>
By 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, the total number of valid signatures had grown to 7,778, 
eight more than needed. But early rejoicing by the Coalition to Recall 
Councilman Curtis was squelched when officials pointed out that 127 of the 
valid signatures were turned in by petitioners who had incorrectly filled out 
their affidavits. 
</P>
<P>
That left the coalition just below its threshold but made it appear that the 
requisite number would soon emerge from the 12,001 signatures turned in on 
Sept. 28. After a discouraging Monday during which coalition leaders discovered 
that they were 477 signatures short, Tuesday's news brought sighs of relief. 
</P>
<P>
"The fat lady hasn't sung yet," said Helen Monroe, chairwoman of the recall 
campaign. "But we're confident that we'll get enough valid signatures, much 
more confident than we were yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
According to City Clerk Ivy J. Zovel, the county registrar of voters office 
hopes to find at least 7,950 valid signatures before approving the petitions. 
That, she said, would provide a safety margin beyond the needed 7,770 
signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis, whose enthusiasm bubbled over Monday, was more subdued after hearing 
the latest count. "I'm assuming they'll qualify," he said. "At this point, I'm 
looking forward to an election. I think it's the clearest way for the voters of 
Mission Viejo to send a message to the Philip Morris Co. to stay out of the 
affairs of this city." 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based Philip Morris Companies Inc. owns the Mission Viejo Co., 
which has donated $35,717 in cash and in-kind contributions, including the loan 
of a political consultant, to the recall effort. Curtis and the Mission Viejo 
Co. have sparred furiously in recent months, most notably over a proposal to 
annex Aegean Hills, a pie-shaped area of unincorporated Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis championed the annexation and the company opposed it. The annexation bid 
crumbled last spring. The Mission Viejo Co. now leads all contributors in the 
effort to recall Curtis. In addition, several developers who have done work for 
the company are among the recall campaign's other major backers. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition has collected $156,422 and spent more than $124,000 on its recall 
campaign to date, and observers note that those enormous resources have 
produced paltry results -- about $10 spent for each of the 12,001 signatures, 
with thousands declared invalid. The coalition's travails have emboldened 
Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
"They've had to struggle mightily to get this far," he said. "The time that 
they spent and the resources that they spent to get these few signatures shows 
how little support there is for them." 
</P>
<P>
Monroe declined comment on Curtis' remarks, saying that she and other coalition 
members would wait until after the signature verification is complete. If 
sufficient signatures are declared valid, Mission Viejo's City Council will be 
required to set a special election date, probably sometime early next spring.

The city's first automated dump trucks will begin collecting containers full of 
recyclable items Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The trucks, equipped with robotic arms that hoist and empty containers, will 
collect trash every week and recyclable items twice monthly. On Nov. 6, every 
Brea resident will receive two 100-gallon containers for free, a green one for 
recyclable waste and a black one for garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers, cardboard, computer paper, magazines, glass, aluminum and plastic 
containers can be stored in the green can. Each can is equivalent in size to 
four medium-size trash cans. As a result, residents will not have to segregate 
different kinds of recyclables into separate containers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an opportunity for us to control our (trash) rates in the future," 
said Patrick McCarron, director of maintenance services. 
</P>
<P>
Landfill disposal fees were raised countywide in July. For Brea residents, they 
increased from $4.92 to $7.93 per month. Because recyclables will be sold, gate 
fees at landfills will be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take a behavior change, a modification of habits," McCarron 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A test program in Anaheim identified some problems, such as trash in the wrong 
container, but nothing that cannot be resolved, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a winner for the people who live here," McCarron said. "The program 
has long-range benefits and good economic effects. JENNIFER MOULTON

EQUESTRIANS' TROUBLED TRAIL TALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY HESKETH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
River Trail Stables in Orange is, as its name suggests, a bucolic stone's throw 
from the banks of the Santa Ana River -- 7 1/2 acres of tree-shaded horse 
stalls, bordered by a narrow bridle path that meanders beside the waterway. 
</P>
<P>
Flocks of nesting ducks, terns and an occasional blue heron glide along the air 
currents above the marshy riverbed. Vincent, the stable cat, stretches out atop 
a weathered picnic table near the training ring. 
</P>
<P>
"This," said River Trail owner Nancy Shipley, "is our little haven -- our 
little country, where you can almost forget you're in the middle of the hustle 
and bustle." 
</P>
<P>
Almost. The rattles and clunks and roars from a nearby carpet foam factory 
provide a syncopated reminder of all that surrounds River Trail Stables. 
</P>
<P>
After Shipley bought River Trail Stables in 1985, an industrial park overtook 
the last of what was once orchards and fields. And with the encroachment has 
come competition for the river trail itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main problem is with bicycle riders," Shipley said. The Santa Ana River 
marks the 28-mile course for two bike and equestrian paths from the Orange 
County line near Green River Golf Course to the Huntington Beach shoreline. For 
the most part, the asphalt-paved bike path is some distance from the dirt 
bridle trail. 
</P>
<P>
"But right here, the paths are together," Shipley said. In fact, the two paths 
converge at the end of the river bank. 
</P>
<P>
Many bike riders don't realize when a horse is walking quietly along the trail, 
a sudden noise or movement can spook it, especially from behind, Shipley said. 
</P>
<P>
"If a horse can see something, they can pretty much handle it," Shipley said. 
"It's the element of surprise that is so dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Every rider at the stable has a horror story about cyclists, she said. One 
often-repeated story involves a cyclist who slapped the rump of a horse as he 
sped by. The horse spooked and reared, but the rider hung on. One of the 
stable's trainers, who was along for the ride, chased the cyclist. And soon, a 
posse of other riders on the trail joined the pursuit until the bicyclist was 
caught and told how nearly disastrous his prank had been. Sheepishly, the 
cyclist returned and apologized to the shaken rider. 
</P>
<P>
Not all bicyclists are a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Families are usually very considerate," Shipley said. But the serious, 
spandex-clad cyclists who use the trails for conditioning and to practice for 
racing events are another matter, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just my thinking," Shipley said. "We almost think there should be a 
speed limit." 
</P>
<P>
Some county workers charged with overseeing the trails agree that problems 
sometimes occur where the paths converge. 
</P>
<P>
"I've clocked some of them going 35 to 45 miles per hour -- with their heads 
down, not watching where they're going," said Ron Broadbelt, a county bike 
trail maintenance worker. "It's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
But a speed limit would be almost impossible to enforce, Broadbelt said. A more 
practical solution would be to separate the trails -- a design plan that is 
part of the much-delayed Santa Ana River Flood Control project. Terrie 
Medeiros, a project manager with the county's Environmental Management Agency, 
said the plan calls for widening the river near River Trail Stables and 
creating a new equestrian trail. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the only real solution," said Jean McIntire, a county transportation 
planner who has been riding horses out of River Trail Stables for several years 
and has had her share of run-ins with cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
But construction along this stretch of the riverbed isn't scheduled to start 
until April, 1994, with completion of the area estimated at mid-1995. In the 
meantime, "if (cyclists) could just not reach out, slap the horses or shout," 
Shipley said, then most riders, in turn, would try to keep their horses out of 
the way of the bikes.

DECISION ON HOTEL DEVELOPER DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A decision on whether to keep La Quinta Motor Inns Inc. as the developer of a 
hotel in Garden Grove has been delayed until Nov. 13 by the City Council as the 
two parties wrangle over how to cope with a potential flood from an overflow of 
the Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
The council, sitting Monday night as the Agency for Community Development, 
voted 4 to 0 -- Councilman Frank Kessler was absent -- to consider at that 
meeting whether to modify or terminate a development agreement between the city 
and the hotel chain for the construction of a three-story hotel at the 
northwest corner of Haster Street and Garden Grove Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The city's economic development staff will work with the developer to resolve 
the Santa Ana River flood plain issue. 
</P>
<P>
According to City Manager George L. Tindall, La Quinta has been in default of 
the agreement to develop the site because it failed to meet an Aug. 30 deadline 
to submit plans that include elevating the project five feet to meet federal 
flood protection guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta, based in San Antonio, has for two years been planning the 
construction of the 174-room inn. The project, which is on a 3.8-acre site and 
has an estimated cost of $8 million, has been seen as a key step in 
revitalizing that portion of Garden Grove Boulevard east of Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph D. Barrett, western division real estate manager for La Quinta, maintains 
that the costly elevation -- estimated at $500,000 -- isn't necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that with the county raising the western levee of the Santa Ana 
River, and with the improvement and widening of the Katella Avenue bridge, we 
shouldn't be in the 100-year-flood-plain area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Tindall argued that the developer must still provide evidence that its 
grading plan would meet federal regulations and was required do so by Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a technical default. Right now, I have no evidence that says that the 
site is not in the flood-plain area," he said. He urged Barrett to apply for a 
variance from federal regulations and to provide supporting evidence justifying 
that variance to the agency. 
</P>
<P>
The city and redevelopment agency have been acquiring and consolidating land 
for the project, which would include a restaurant. It used the power of eminent 
domain to acquire the D.O.K. West, a bar on that site. 
</P>
<P>
Recent problems with development of the site have revolved around the 
flood-plain issue. Under guidelines issued by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, the proximity of the site to the Santa Ana River requires that the 
project would have to be raised five feet as a precaution against the effects 
of a "100-year flood" -- that is, a flood so severe that it is expected to 
occur only once each century. 
</P>
<P>
Having missed the deadline for submitting a complete plan, La Quinta could 
forfeit its $50,000 deposit, officials said. JAMES TORTOLANO

150 TO TEST BLOOD TO HELP AILING TEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least 150 employees of St. Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation Center will 
undergo blood tests today to determine if their bone marrow is compatible with 
that of Brandon Oba, a 16-year-old suffering from leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors say the youth, son of hospital employee Steve Oba, needs a bone marrow 
transplant if he is to have any hope of a healthy life. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said the blood tests will be performed from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
Hospital employees, volunteers and members of the medical staff have 
volunteered to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say the possibility of finding a "matching" donor is 1 in 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the blood test is $75 per test, but St. Jude Hospital and 
Rehabilitation Center has agreed to pay the costs of the tests performed on 
their employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of those who have volunteered to be tested are very positive and upbeat," 
said Karen Murray, a hospital lab employee. "We're all hoping that one of us 
will be able to help Brandon."

MISSION VIEJO BOY GETS STALKER BOUNTY

The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors meted out shares Tuesday of a 
$36,777 bounty for the capture of convicted Night Stalker Richard Ramirez, 
paying rewards ranging from $250 to $10,388 to 19 people, including a 
13-year-old Mission Viejo boy. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the largest sum will go to Jesse N. Perez, 66, of Los 
Angeles. Perez is a one-time acquaintance of Ramirez, who was convicted Sept. 
20 of 13 murders and faces death in the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Yochelson said Perez led police to the recovery of a 
murder weapon used to help convict the Night Stalker defendant. Perez's 
daughter, Pauline, who persuaded her father to call the police, will receive 
$3,250. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the county claiming reward funds, Perez's daughter wrote that 
Ramirez had discussions with her father, revealing "that he had done 'bad 
things' in his life, like killing and stealing. My father described the suspect 
to me, and I said he sounded like the Night Stalker." 
</P>
<P>
Of the $36,777 to be paid by the county, most was contributed by corporations 
and individuals. It is part of about $80,000 offered by various jurisdictions 
and the governor's office for the Night Stalker's arrest and conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"We assigned the monies in proportion to how important a person's information 
was in leading to the identification, arrest and conviction" of the Night 
Stalker, said Georgette Dewyer, deputy executive officer to the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Citing privacy statutes, county officials declined to give addresses and other 
specific information about those who won rewards. Times sources provided the 
identification of some of the people issued awards. 
</P>
<P>
Receiving $1,000 is James Romero, a 13-year-old Mission Viejo boy who in 1985 
got a partial license number of a car believed used in several of Stalker 
attacks. James spotted the car in his neighborhood the night of a 1985 attack 
on a Mission Viejo couple. Ramirez has been charged with rape and attempted 
murder in that case, which is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Ochoa, an unemployed truck driver from Lompoc, will receive $2,500 for 
tipping off police to the possibility that Ramirez was the Night Stalker. 
"That's great," she said after hearing about the reward, adding: "It really 
helps. I'm out of work." 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa said her brother, Earl Gregg Jr., also of Lompoc, and Ramirez were once 
roommates. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked at composites," she said, "and the more we talked, the more we 
decided it was Rick." She said her brother and his wife turned over to police a 
bracelet from Ramirez that was linked to one of the Stalker's crimes. Gregg and 
his wife, Deleen, will also receive $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
Alejandro Espinoza, who will receive $6,338, was awarded his share of the 
reward for assisting police in the recovery of property taken from the homes of 
murder victims, Yochelson said.

FROM PUNCHES TO PRANKS, RIVALRIES A PART OF GAME; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH SCHOOLS: THE SHENANIGANS THAT PRECEDE THE ACTUAL COMPETITION HAVE BECOME 
AS MEMORABLE AS THE FINAL SCORES.

<P>
As a result of the tank rivalry and the tree incident, Sonora has become 
involved in a feud with the cross town farm boys. -- SONORA SABRE, student 
newspaper 
</P>
<P>
The tank was a paint-splattered water tower in a vacant field, the tree was a 
campus landmark and the farm boys were kids from the next town over. 
</P>
<P>
It was mid-October of 1968 and Sonora and Brea-Olinda high schools were 
preparing to play a football game. 
</P>
<P>
The rivalry between the neighboring schools began when Sonora opened in 1966. 
It grew slowly, centering solely on a football game -- an important game 
between league rivals -- but picked up intensity and intrigue when the students 
got involved. 
</P>
<P>
Sonora students claimed the water tower as their own, decorating it with 
graffiti the week before the big game. 
</P>
<P>
 "SHS No. 1," "Tower Power," "Victory," "Class of '69." 
</P>
<P>
 Days later, Brea students redecorated the tower with Wildcat slogans. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. 1," "Brea Rules." 
</P>
<P>
 In retaliation, Sonora students sawed down the senior tree, a campus landmark 
in the Brea quad. 
</P>
<P>
You know, of course, that meant war. And it has not let up in the 20 years that 
have passed. 
</P>
<P>
Through spray-painted water tanks, rocks, trees, mock funerals (Brea students 
marched a Sonora coffin around school to inspire the football players and, 
indeed, the campus to kill the Raiders), the schools have traded barbs, paint 
strokes and, this season, punches. 
</P>
<P>
The shenanigans that precede the games have become as important and linger as 
long in the participants' memories as the final scores themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Sonora-Brea is one of Orange County's longest-running rivalries, but by no 
means the only one. 
</P>
<P>
Name a school and it has a rival, a hated rival that its students would do 
anything to beat. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley has Edison, Servite has Mater Dei, Santa Ana Valley has Santa 
Ana, Tustin has Foothill, Esperanza has El Dorado, Corona del Mar has Newport 
Harbor, Mission Viejo has Capistrano Valley, Capistrano Valley has El Toro, El 
Toro has Mission Viejo . . . you get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Geography plays a part in establishing rivalries. What could be more heated 
than a feud between cross-town high schools? 
</P>
<P>
Some schools have seen cross-town rivals change as the county has grown. 
</P>
<P>
"Our big rival now is Villa Park, but back in the 1940s, '50s and '60s we've 
had Santa Ana, then Huntington Beach and then Foothill," said Dave Zirkle, 
Orange athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Success plays a part, too. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley and Edison are rivals mainly because their games often decided 
Sunset League championships. 
</P>
<P>
Rivalries between coaches can't be overlooked, either. El Modena and Foothill 
were rivals for many seasons because of the contrasting personalities of 
personable Bob Lester at El Modena and gruff Ted Mullen at Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
The rivalry has lessened in recent years, though. Lester retired in 1985 and 
Mullen left Foothill in 1987, first for Anaheim then, recently, for Palm 
Desert. 
</P>
<P>
But most rivalries have endured through coaching and personnel changes, through 
good teams and bad. Some carry more significance than others, but Orange 
County's football rivalries are a big part of Thursday, Friday and Saturday 
nights in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Lombardo, assistant athletic director at Servite, speaks for most: "I 
have heard it said on both sides that Mater Dei can't call it a good season 
until it beats Servite, and the same for us. As long as we beat Mater Dei, 
we're OK." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, the students have their own wars to wage. 
</P>
<P>
Halftime of the annual Esperanza-El Dorado game in 1978 was one fans of both 
schools will long remember. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs' mascot that season was a dog named Esperanza, trained to retrieve 
tennis balls thrown by a custodian. 
</P>
<P>
When Esperanza trotted out to do his act at halftime of the '78 game, El Dorado 
fans heaved hundreds of tennis balls on the field. "There must have been 600 of 
them; the dog went crazy," an observer, recalling the incident, told The Times 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, such pranks carry considerably less wit. 
</P>
<P>
The Villa Park-Orange rivalry has produced a number of incidents. 
</P>
<P>
During a pep rally, a former Orange coach made an off-handed comment about 
Villa Park being the weenies on the hill. 
</P>
<P>
"It stuck and our kids started throwing hot dogs at their people," Zirkle said. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park would strike back by throwing oranges. 
</P>
<P>
One year, Orange students stuck oranges on the classroom door knobs at Villa 
Park. Villa Park retaliated by plugging up all the key holes at Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Another year, Orange students plunged a Volkswagen Karman Ghia into the Villa 
Park pool. 
</P>
<P>
And there was the time in the early '70s, when a dead dolphin was hoisted up 
the school flagpole at Dana Hills. San Clemente students allegedly had found 
the dolphin during a harbor cleanup and wanted to zing their rivals, nicknamed 
the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
But for sheer animosity, it's tough to top the Tustin-Foothill rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
Pranks have ranked from a tame bombing of the rival's pool with dye to bales of 
hay all over the Foothill campus. 
</P>
<P>
"They always referred to us as farmers, so our cheerleaders spread hay all over 
their quad," said Vince Brown, Tustin baseball coach and assistant football 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
The cheerleaders from the schools exchanged cookies the week before the game as 
a gesture of good will, but one year things got a little twisted. 
</P>
<P>
The Tustin cheerleaders put laxatives in their batch and handed them over to 
Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
"A tremendous amount of animosity built up and there was a lot of tension the 
rest of the year any time the schools played," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Emotions intensified during the 1981 Fullerton-Sunny Hills game. Before the 
season finale against Fullerton, Sunny Hills forfeited four games after the 
district office received an anonymous tip that the Lancers had used an 
ineligible lineman. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, everyone at Sunny Hills thought someone at Fullerton made the call. 
An estimated 25 police officers were on duty for the game, but there were no 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an electricity on this campus that I've never seen before," said Tim 
Devaney, Sunny Hills coach. "It was a strong rivalry that was suddenly 
intensified. 
</P>
<P>
"We played in a CIF (Central Conference) championship game against La Habra at 
Anaheim Stadium in 1983, but I've never seen emotions higher on campus than 
that week. The students wore war paint all week in preparation for playing the

For the most part, rivalries benefit the schools. Coaches say there is more 
excitement around campus during the week of a big game. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Edison and Fountain Valley, two Sunset League rivals, have reaped 
huge rewards, not to mention profits, from their rivalry. It reached its height 
in the late 1970s and early '80s, when the game outgrew high school stadiums 
and was played at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially at that time, the best time to rob a house in Fountain Valley or 
Huntington Beach was when Fountain Valley and Edison were playing because 
nobody was home," said Bill Workman, former Edison coach now at Orange Coast 
College. "The whole community was evacuated." 
</P>
<P>
From 1975-1981, the game drew between 14,000 and 32,000 each year. Only once 
did the teams draw fewer than 10,000 in Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Memories of Edison-Fountain Valley games tend to stick with the participants. 
Dave White, Edison coach, was a quarterback on the Chargers' 1972 and '73 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I played (quarterback at Oregon State) against USC at the Coliseum," White 
said. "I played in front of 90,000 in Tennessee and LSU. The games I remember 
most were the two against Fountain Valley. I still haven't gotten over losing 
in 1972." 
</P>
<P>
This year, Mike Milner, Fountain Valley coach, received a letter from former 
tight end Greg Bolin, who is in Zaire working as a Peace Corps officer. It was 
dated Aug. 12 and somehow arrived before last week's game. Bolin had taken the 
time to encourage his alma mater to beat Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Edison won Friday's game with a touchdown in the final minutes, 28-25, in front 
of a capacity crowd of 7,500 at Orange Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, games go beyond mere rivalries. 
</P>
<P>
Sonora-Brea reached a head in the waning moments of the Wildcats' victory 
earlier this season. A fight broke out after a number of personal-foul 
penalties were called against both teams. After officials broke up the fight, 
they ended the game early. Four Sonora players were suspended for a game by 
school administrators for their part in the melee. 
</P>
<P>
The schools have decided not to play next season. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a couple of years of cooling off," said Jon Looney, Brea coach. "This 
game has gone beyond just a rivalry. We need to let it cool down a little bit. 
It's gotten out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
Rivalries present a fine line between spirited pride and outright lawlessness 
that administrators and coaches must traverse. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have coaches who can put things in perspective," said Tom Vitello, 
Servite athletic director. "I look at (last week's) USC-Notre Dame game. Things 
got out of control (during a pregame fight) and I blame the coaches." 
</P>
<P>
Said James Golden, Mater Dei vice principal: "I know that kids will do things 
that you have no control over. You have to try and discourage all that." 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1970s, things had become so bad between Servite and Mater Dei that 
the Servite administration decided anyone caught defacing Mater Dei property 
would be expelled. 
</P>
<P>
And somewhere between the dye in the pool and the hay on the quad, 
administrators at Foothill and Tustin decided something needed to be done to 
curb vandalism and bad feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"The principals decided that they better start doing something to bring the 
kids together," said Brown, the Tustin assistant. "They have a lunch every year 
before the game at the district office and try to get them to understand that 
it's just a friendly game." 
</P>
<P>
The schools have added campus security during the week of the big game to 
prevent vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
Breakfast has become a 20-year tradition as part of the Fountain Valley-Edison 
rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the school's student government, cheerleaders and selected players 
are invited the morning of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea is to promote good sportsmanship between the schools," said 
Fountain Valley Principal Michael Kasler, a former administrator at Edison. 
"The kids get to know each other and become friends. We think it's very healthy 
in promoting a good, clean rivalry." 
</P>
<P>
Zirkle said this was the first year there were no incidents in Orange's rivalry 
with Villa Park. He attributes that to a pregame breakfast both teams attended. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it had an effect, I don't know," Zirkle said. "But this is the first 
year we didn't have any vandalism." 
</P>
<P>
Oranges were eaten, not thrown. No word on the hot dogs, though.

<P>
Perhaps no other county rivalry has produced as many significant meetings and 
thrilling finishes as the Sunset League showdowns between Edison and Fountain 
Valley. A few of the highlights from the series, which Edison leads, 15-6-1: 
</P>
<P>
1969 -- A freshman- and sophomore-dominated Edison team stunned Fountain 
Valley, 21-20, costing the Barons the Irvine League championship. 
</P>
<P>
1970 -- Edison rolled to a 28-6 victory on the way to a 13-0 record and a 
Southern Section 3-A championship. 
</P>
<P>
1973 -- Fountain Valley posted a 28-24 victory for its first win in the series. 
</P>
<P>
1974 -- Fountain Valley's Steve Thompson missed a 31-yard field goal attempt on 
the game's final play, allowing Edison to escape with a 0-0 tie. 
</P>
<P>
1977 -- Willie Gittens' one-yard touchdown run with 3:19 to play allowed 
Fountain Valley to avoid an upset with a 6-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
1978 -- Edison drove 81 yards in the final minutes to set up a 32-yard field 
goal by Rick Stephens in a 10-7 Charger victory. Edison went on to win the 
Sunset League championship, but Fountain Valley went one better; the loss was 
its only one in a Big 5 championship season. 
</P>
<P>
1979 -- Kerwin Bell rushed for 235 yards and four touchdowns in a 35-7 victory 
for Edison, which was on its way to a Big 5 championship. 
</P>
<P>
1980 -- Edison rallied for a 14-13 victory on Ken Major's touchdown and 
two-point conversion runs with 19 seconds to play before a crowd of 18,000. 
Five weeks later, the teams played for the Big 5 championship before a crowd of 
29,000, with Edison winning, 14-0, to cap a 14-0 season. 
</P>
<P>
1983 -- Fountain Valley ended a six-game losing streak in the series with a 
33-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
1985 -- Edison, the eventual Big 5 champion, rolled to a 24-0 halftime lead, 
then held on for a 24-12 victory. 
</P>
<P>
1987 -- Fountain Valley's Eric Sasenberg stopped Greg Angelovic on a two-point 
conversion run with no time remaining as the Barons held on for a 14-13 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
1988 -- Fountain Valley, the eventual CIF Division I champion, stopped a late 
Edison rally at the Barons' 10-yard line with 1:22 to play to preserve a 28-21 
victory.

CHAIRMAN PUTS BID TOGETHER FOR CINEPLEX ODEON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six months after a nasty brawl with his major shareholder, the intrepid 
chairman of Cineplex Odeon Corp. on Tuesday reached an agreement with his 
outside directors to proceed with a takeover bid for the company. The bid is 
valued at nearly $16.50 per share (Canadian), or almost $14 in U.S. currency, 
according to sources familiar with the Toronto movie-theater concern. 
</P>
<P>
The bid would be worth about $700 million (U.S.), and the buyer would also 
assume about $600 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
Cineplex Chairman Garth H. Drabinsky will have 21 days to formally launch the 
bid, which requires firm financing under Canadian law. The price exceeds the 
pessimistic valuations of $4 to $9 (U.S.) for the stock, set by speculators who 
have bet the stock price will plummet and have sold the stock "short" over the 
past 18 months. The deal will require a "fairly creative capital structure," 
according to one Wall Street source, who said financing arguably could come 
from bank and junk bond financing, "a lot of equity" and short-term loans until 
certain assets can be sold. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to have to sell . . . substantially all of the U.S. circuit," 
declared one industry source. Cineplex currently ranks second-largest among 
theater companies in North America, with about 1,200 screens in the United 
States and about 500 in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Trading of Cineplex shares was halted four minutes before the close of the New 
York Stock Exchange at the company's request. The stock closed at $11.25, up 
$1.125 on a volume of 828,300 shares, or more than double the recent average 
daily volume of 330,000 shares. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for an independent Cineplex directors' committee said an 
announcement would be made early today before trading resumed. 
</P>
<P>
The independent committee was formed last spring to sell the company after the 
Cineplex chairman offended his largest shareholder, MCA Inc. of Los Angeles, by 
attempting an end-run for control. 
</P>
<P>
Drabinsky and a group of investors had privately struck a deal to acquire stock 
held by the Charles R. Bronfman clan for $17.50 per share (Canadian), but MCA 
protested that the Drabinsky group would enjoy control without offering the 
same price to other shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
After MCA went to court and petitioned Canadian regulators, the Bronfman group 
bowed to the pressure to form an independent committee. In mid-June, the 
company formally went on the auction block by providing financial data to 
potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The prospective buyers included other theater companies and Los Angeles-based 
Davis Co., led by former 20th Century Fox Film Corp. owner Marvin Davis, but in 
recent weeks, the industry wagered that Drabinsky would win the company if he 
could put together a bid.

JAMES FLANIGAN: PUTTING HOME PRICE FORECASTS IN PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Predictions about residential real estate are becoming scary -- that house 
prices in the New York and Boston areas will fall eventually to levels of Texas 
and Oklahoma; that California home prices will fall 5% to 10% on a statewide 
basis -- more in big cities. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the prospects outlined in Barron's financial weekly and Forbes 
magazine by analysts and investment managers. And they're sure to get 
attention, because for most people house values represent 60% of their net 
worth. But before you run screaming for shelter, let's see what's behind such 
predictions. 
</P>
<P>
In Barron's, the money managers of a firm named Comstock Partners say burdens 
on the economy from the savings and loan bailout and the high levels of 
corporate and individual debt will affect house prices. "Property values in 
Oklahoma, Texas and Arizona are more consistent with what the future will hold 
than property values in New York, Boston and Washington. Somewhere the values 
will equalize," says Michael Aronstein of Comstock, speaking in terms of the 
next five to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Comstock Partners are the guys who predicted a year ago that real estate 
prices in the Northeast would tumble, and so far they've been right. House 
prices in the New York-New Jersey-New England area, after an incredible run-up 
of 150% to 200% from 1983 to 1987, have fallen 10% to 20% -- and more in some 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the West Coast is not immune. In a report for the brokerage 
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, analyst Timothy Hurckes predicts that 
California house prices will decline 5% to 10% on a statewide basis next year. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the decline is already here, says Edward Abbott, head of Western 
Pacific Capital, a San Francisco-based real estate investment firm. "The 
merchandise isn't moving in Orange County and the (San Fernando) Valley," says 
Abbott, and in San Francisco (unrelated to the earthquake) "asking prices are 
20% below what they were last March." 
</P>
<P>
So, are house prices in wholesale retreat, as in the 1930s when foreclosures 
were common and Los Angeles properties lost half their value? No, don't panic. 
What is happening is that in some markets -- the Northeast, San Francisco, some 
areas of Los Angeles -- prices that were pushed up by the financial boom of the 
early to mid-1980s, are now going into a down cycle. 
</P>
<P>
But elsewhere, prices are rising. In the Central Valley, "in Tracy, Fresno, 
Sacramento -- wherever real people can afford to buy a real house, markets are 
good," Abbott says. 
</P>
<P>
And elsewhere in the country, too, real estate values are on the rise in 
industrial areas such as Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio, and in places that went 
through severe depression in the 1980s -- such as Houston and San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
What all this means to you is don't be scared by predictions, but do get a 
perspective on real estate values. They rise and decline in a market like any 
other but often without the trading that constantly sets stock and bond prices. 
In real estate, if houses aren't selling, people don't move as often -- and so 
prices fall invisibly, as it were. The experts are saying that now is such a 
time, that real estate in many places is going into a down cycle, so you can't 
count on appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
But as for $300,000 houses in the Northeast or Los Angeles tumbling to the 
$90,000 levels of Oklahoma City, that's not going to happen, says Christopher 
Leinberger, a real estate consultant and author on urban patterns. Land, 
population and politics are the reasons. In large urban areas, land use is 
restricted by zoning and the power of community groups to control developers, 
Leinberger says. 
</P>
<P>
A zoning ordinance saying only two houses can occupy an acre of land -- rather 
than four houses or a bunch of apartments -- reduces the overall amount of land 
available to construction and drives up land and home prices. That helps 
account for the high property prices in dense urban areas -- which make up only 
2.2% of the total U.S. land area. 
</P>
<P>
But such zoning also restrains overbuilding, so that dense urban areas don't 
suffer horrendous declines such as Houston experienced and such as Arizona is 
now going through. "After this economic pause, the direction of prices in 
Boston and Los Angeles is higher, more toward the patterns of Europe and Japan 
rather than those of the Midwest," Leinberger says. 
</P>
<P>
Dense urban areas also generate diverse economies that are better able to 
withstand an economic downdraft in a single industry. "The economy is more 
diverse and incomes per person are higher in California than they were in 
Texas," notes real estate investor Abbott (who nonetheless is most bullish 
right now about Houston and San Antonio). 
</P>
<P>
Which only means that despite scare headlines and predictions, economies remain 
cyclical -- and this cycle too shall pass. And though a house may not be a 
money-making investment right now, it usually beats inflation over the long 
term, aside from being a nice, tax-deductible place to live.

DOW SINKS 85 POINTS BUT RECOVERS TO CLOSE OFF 3.69

Computerized program trading led the stock market on one of its most erratic 
days Tuesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 85 points before it 
reversed course, trading briefly above Monday's close, before ending the day 
off 3.69 at 2,659.22. 
</P>
<P>
The market's wild ride was set in motion by the apparent collapse of any hope 
for a buyout soon of UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines. This prompted a 
selloff at the start of the trading day of airline and other potential takeover 
stocks. In addition, economic news about a fall in durable goods orders in 
September was widely interpreted as a possible sign of a recession and was 
cited as a factor in the initial heavy selling of stocks. 
</P>
<P>
But the wide swings in stock prices throughout the day were attributed mainly 
to program trading, as specialized investors sought to profit from the 
seesawing differences between the prices of futures contracts for baskets of 
stocks and the prices of the stocks themselves. Traders said the heavy trading 
volume -- 237.96 million on the New York Stock Exchange, compared to 135.86 
million Monday -- masked the fact that many institutional investors retreated 
to the sidelines rather than risk trading in the face of unpredictable price 
swings. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Weeks, senior vice president for equity trading at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; 
Jenrette Securities, called the market's volatility Tuesday "absolutely 
ridiculous" and said it appeared to be almost entirely related to computerized 
arbitrage trading between stocks and stock index futures, such as the Standard 
&amp; Poor's 500, a futures contract for a basket of 500 stocks, and the major 
market index, made up of stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Creber, a partner at the brokerage Miller Tabak Hirsch &amp; Co., said, 
"We're seeing (program traders) play around with this market and whip it 
around." 
</P>
<P>
The sharp drop in futures prices early in the day triggered a temporary trading 
halt in the S&amp;P 500 futures contract. The halt is part of the so-called 
circuit breaker mechanisms implemented since 1987 in an effort to curb wide 
swings in stock and futures prices, and it goes into effect when the contract 
falls below a 12-point limit. Some market analysts said the brief halt 
contributed to the recovery of futures and stock prices later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
News late Monday that UAL's board had decided to keep the company independent 
for now, and the apparent evaporation of hope for a new bid soon, led to a 
massive selloff of the stock by speculators in takeover deals, known as 
arbitragers. The fate of the UAL deal has had a profound impact on the stock 
markets since Oct. 13, when the Dow index dropped 190 points in response to 
news that the group trying to take the company private had failed to obtain 
financing for its $6.75-billion, $300-a-share offer. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, trading of UAL was delayed because of a sharp imbalance of sell 
orders over bids to buy. Later, the stock traded down as much as 30 points from 
its close on Monday. But rumors that one or more brokerages were "sweeping the 
street" with large buy orders for the stock fueled speculation that a new 
takeover offer might emerge. This caused the stock to bounce back, closing off 
only 8 3/8 at 170. 
</P>
<P>
The rebound of stock prices late in the day mainly affected the blue chips. On 
the New York Stock Exchange, declining stocks outnumbered rising ones by 3 to 
1, with 360 up, 1,213 down and 381 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to UAL, other active issues included Security Pacific, which fell 
7/8 to 44 1/2; Philip Morris, up 5/8 to 44 1/2; Chase Manhattan, down 7/8 at 38 
7/8, and AMR, down 1 3/4 at 68 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of stocks traded over the counter fell, wiping out most of the recovery 
made late last week. The NASDAQ composite index of OTC stocks fell 5.52 to 
close at 461.70, only slightly above its recent low on Oct. 17 of 459.93. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the recovery by blue chip stocks late in the day, traders said 
Tuesday's economic news was discouraging and could put a damper on the market 
in coming weeks. The Commerce Department announced that orders for durable 
goods slipped 0.1% in September. Traders noted in particular that if the 
volatile defense sector is excluded from the figures, remaining durable goods 
orders fell 3.9%, the biggest drop in four months. The figures came as several 
large companies Tuesday reported lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
"This is confirmation that the economy is slowing down," said Anthony Woodruff, 
managing director in charge of equity trading at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stock prices closed lower in brisk trading, with the key 225-share 
Nikkei index slipping 58.97 to close at 35,526.55 after climbing 99.14 on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The initial decline in the U.S. stock market Tuesday led to nervousness in 
London. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed sharply 
lower, off 40.4 at 2,1149.3.

BUSH PROPOSES GLOBAL RULES FOR TRADE IN SERVICES; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: THE SERVICES SECTOR IS BOOMING, AND THE UNITED STATES WANTS TO ENSURE 
THAT ITS INDUSTRIES CAN MARKET THEMSELVES AS EASILY AS GOODS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration unveiled a formal proposal Tuesday that for the first 
time would extend global trading rules to cover the burgeoning services sector, 
which accounts for 68% of the U.S. economy and 90% of all new jobs in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The sweeping new provisions, which Washington is putting forward at the global 
trade liberalization talks now under way in Geneva, are designed to guarantee 
that services can be marketed worldwide as easily as goods and that all firms 
are treated fairly. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the services category are industries such as banking, insurance, 
construction, architecture, communications, advertising, law, consulting, 
transportation, equipment leasing, tourism, recreation, hotels, restaurants, 
medical care and engineering. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials conceded that the effort, which Washington has been pressing 
with limited success since the early 1980s, is almost certain to prove 
controversial. Developing countries in particular fear that industrialized 
countries will dominate the market. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. firms, on the other hand, were expected to support the plan vigorously. 
Harry L. Freeman, executive vice president of the American Express Co., a 
spokesman for the group, called the proposal "very bold and very aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills said the thrust of the new plan is to 
establish a general framework for negotiating specific rules to govern trade in 
services, which currently are not covered by any international regulations. 
</P>
<P>
All services would be included under the new U.S. plan unless they are 
specifically exempted as a result of the Geneva talks. 
</P>
<P>
To make the proposal seem less threatening to developing countries, the 
Administration provided for a series of possible escape mechanisms under which 
countries would be able to exempt themselves from specific categories or 
provisions that they found unpalatable. 
</P>
<P>
However, countries that reject too many such rules would be denied some of the 
benefits that the new regulations would provide. The plan also calls for 
establishing a new mechanism to settle disputes that may arise. 
</P>
<P>
Hills and Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter also unveiled a proposal for 
a "substantial, progressive reduction" of farm subsidies worldwide over the 
next several years, which also will be placed on the table as part of the trade 
liberalization talks. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, the agriculture plan calls for all countries to convert their 
quotas and other trade barriers into numerical tariffs -- which are easier to 
compare -- and to phase out within five years all those that distort world 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
The United States also wants to muster support for revamping existing farm 
subsidies so that payments to farmers are made independently of the size of the 
crop that they produce. U.S. officials charge that linking subsidies to crop 
size encourages overproduction. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, the Administration wants trading countries to eliminate 
agricultural export subsidies, which they say enable inefficient producers 
often to underprice efficient growers in global markets. The plan calls for 
phasing out the subsidies within five years. 
</P>
<P>
The plan for setting rules to cover trade in services would give all 
participating countries the right to market and provide services across 
borders, to establish offices in other countries and to send in their own 
personnel temporarily for maintenance and repair. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, governments would agree to treat foreign firms in the same way they 
treat their own companies, to give them full access to government-run 
monopolies such as telephone companies and to phase out subsidies to domestic 
firms in the service sector. 
</P>
<P>
They also would be required to keep their regulatory procedures open and to 
give foreign firms an opportunity to comment on proposed regulations before 
they are put into effect. 
</P>
<P>
Hills said the United States wants to include all service industries in the 
negotiations -- whether or not the United States enjoys an advantage in that 
particular industry. "We're taking nothing off the table right now," she told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Both the agriculture and the services proposals were rushed out ahead of 
possible rival plans from other countries, in hopes of gaining the jump on any 
competition and of heightening the pressure for others to present their own 
proposals in both areas by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The European Community and Canada both are working on their own proposals in 
the services field, but they have not yet completed drafting them. Australia 
and New Zealand are expected to support the U.S. plan. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, which has been the major force in the 104-country talks, has 
been pushing for all proposals to be in by late December so the hard bargaining 
can begin in January, in time to wrap the negotiations up as scheduled by the 
end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Besides agriculture and services, the talks also are dealing with areas such as 
patents and intellectual property rights and improving enforcement of trade 
rules generally. The sessions are taking place under the aegis of the 
Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
Hills said the talks are "entering the most creative phase" and must seek 
ambitious goals to make progress.

Shearson Lehman Sued: Quantum B.V.I., a $2.1-billion stock fund, has sued 
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and 103 stock-index futures brokers and traders for 
allegedly defrauding it of $60 million three days after the October, 1987, 
stock market crash. Quantum charged Shearson, three Shearson brokers and up to 
100 traders in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Standard &amp; Poor's 500 
futures pit with fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and violations of the 
Commodity Exchange Act, according to the suit filed late last week in the U.S. 
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Quantum is run by money 
manager George Soros.

FORD TO OPEN TOKYO OFFICE TO GAIN A FOOTHOLD IN ASIA

Ford Motor Co. Chairman Donald E. Petersen said Tuesday that Ford will station 
a vice president in Tokyo and open a "strategic organization" here to gain a 
foothold it now lacks in markets that he said are expected to provide 60% of 
global sales growth in the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Petersen told an audience at the Japan National Press Club that the appointment 
of W. Wayne Booker to head the new Ford Asia-Pacific office represents the 
first time that Ford has stationed one of its officers in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Petersen said Booker and the new office would coordinate existing Ford 
operations in Japan, Australia, Taiwan, New Zealand and South Korea and 
"establish a presence in (other) nations where we do not have a strong presence 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the countries in which Ford lacks a significant foothold and that are 
expected to provide the bulk of automotive growth are in Asia, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something that we simply must take on as a strategic issue," Petersen 
said, adding that the company intends to build its new Asian organization into 
one "that, in time, will be as important as our European and North American 
operations are today." 
</P>
<P>
He said Ford is about to introduce the Thunderbird as its fourth model sold 
here. The others are the Lincoln Continental, the Taurus and the Probe. Last 
year, when the Taurus was the only Ford product sold here, Ford exported a mere 
642 vehicles to Japan, compared to 27,947 for Volkswagen, the No. 1 import.

CHAIRMAN PUTS TOGETHER A CINEPLEX ODEON BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six months after a nasty brawl with his major shareholder, the intrepid 
chairman of Cineplex Odeon Corp. on Tuesday reached an agreement with his 
outside directors to proceed with a takeover bid for the company. The bid is 
valued at nearly $16.50 per share (Canadian), or almost $14 in U.S. currency, 
according to sources familiar with the Toronto movie-theater concern. 
</P>
<P>
The bid would be worth about $700 million (U.S.), and the buyer would also 
assume about $600 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
Cineplex Chairman Garth H. Drabinsky will have 21 days to formally launch the 
bid, which requires firm financing under Canadian law. The price exceeds the 
pessimistic valuations of $4 to $9 (U.S.) for the stock, set by speculators who 
have bet the stock price will plummet and have sold the stock "short" over the 
past 18 months. The deal will require a "fairly creative capital structure," 
according to one Wall Street source, who said financing arguably could come 
from bank and junk bond financing, "a lot of equity" and short-term loans until 
certain assets can be sold. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to have to sell . . . substantially all of the U.S. circuit," 
declared one industry source. Cineplex currently ranks second-largest among 
theater companies in North America, with about 1,200 screens in the United 
States and about 500 in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Trading of Cineplex shares was halted four minutes before the close of the New 
York Stock Exchange at the company's request. The stock closed at $11.25, up 
$1.125 on a volume of 828,300 shares, or more than double the recent average 
daily volume of 330,000 shares. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for an independent Cineplex directors' committee said an 
announcement would be made early today before trading resumed. 
</P>
<P>
The independent committee was formed last spring to sell the company after the 
Cineplex chairman offended his largest shareholder, MCA Inc. of Los Angeles, by 
attempting an end-run for control. 
</P>
<P>
Drabinsky and a group of investors had privately struck a deal to acquire stock 
held by the Charles R. Bronfman clan for $17.50 per share (Canadian), but MCA 
protested that the Drabinsky group would enjoy control without offering the 
same price to other shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
After MCA went to court and petitioned Canadian regulators, the Bronfman group 
bowed to the pressure to form an independent committee. In mid-June, the 
company formally went on the auction block by providing financial data to 
potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The prospective buyers included other theater companies and Los Angeles-based 
Davis Co., led by former 20th Century Fox Film Corp. owner Marvin Davis, but in 
recent weeks, the industry wagered that Drabinsky would win the company if he 
could put together a bid. 
</P>
<P>
Drabinsky, after all, had the most personal and compelling reasons for staying 
at the helm of the company he helped found 10 years ago. The mercurial chairman 
has gained a great deal of visibility as a showman and patron of arts and 
charities, and would be loath to be yanked off his stage, business associates 
have said. 
</P>
<P>
He is "going to try to do some magic with something that sounds like a lot but 
is really a little," predicted one former film executive who had business 
dealings with Drabinsky and Cineplex. "But have no fear: if he pulls it off, 
he'll get into trouble again," the executive said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cineplex auction was haunted by the fact that MCA publicly attacked the 
credibility of the financial reporting practices of Cineplex last April when it 
went to court to block Drabinsky's purchase of the Bronfman stake. 
</P>
<P>
The theater company has already gained a reputation for having overpaid for 
construction of new theaters, as well as for acquisition of existing chains in 
such markets as New York, Washington and Chicago. Such factors may have 
discouraged potential buyers who fear that Cineplex has assigned too high a 
value to its assets.

WITH BUSINESS OFF, DIP IN AIR STOCKS SEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. DALLOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
Airline stocks rose in recent weeks largely because of proposed takeover bids 
for UAL Corp. and AMR Inc. Now that these offers have collapsed, stocks of most 
carriers are expected to drop dramatically, analysts said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
That is largely because the airline business has started to slump. Passenger 
volume is weak because of the slowing economy. Labor and fuel costs are rising. 
Earnings are disappointing. And these pressures are likely to intensify as the 
overall number of aircraft and seats in operation industrywide are expected to 
rise as Eastern Airlines, now in bankruptcy proceedings, boosts its flight 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Further, proposed rules by Congress and the Department of Transportation to 
crack down on leveraged buyouts of airlines -- which many in the industry see 
as the beginning of airline reregulation -- are also seen as bearish by airline 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the airline stocks have been selling at premiums based on speculation 
of takeovers," said Edmund S. Greenslet, a Florida airline analyst. "Those 
premiums are now being removed. When you take those premiums out, you take the 
stocks back to levels supported by earnings, and those prices are lower than 
the prices we have today." 
</P>
<P>
Hans J. Plickert, an airline analyst with the Transportation Group, an 
affiliate of Paine Webber, said that "if it had not been for the speculation on 
the takeover moves, the (airline) stocks might have started to weaken earlier 
in the year." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, USAir provided further evidence of disappointing airline earnings. 
The carrier reported an operating loss of $71.9 million in the third quarter, 
in contrast with operating income of $136.7 million in the 1988 period. The 
carrier blamed the loss in part on discount fares, higher-than-expected 
frequent-flyer awards and fare wars in California. The effect of Hurricane Hugo 
and the Bay Area earthquake, along with recent trends, are likely to push 
results for the fourth quarter and all of 1989 "significantly lower" than the 
year-earlier periods, said Edwin I. Colodny, USAir's chairman and president. 
</P>
<P>
AMR, parent of American Airlines, earlier this month reported that its 
third-quarter operating profit fell 8.9% from the 1988 period, while its 
operating expenses rose 20.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Delta Air Lines also is expected to report disappointing quarterly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, analysts expect third-quarter earnings to plummet as much as 40% from 
a year ago. Such deterioration is expected to continue for the remainder of 
this year and well into 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Such conditions are a stark contrast to the brighter days of late last year and 
the first half of this year, when U.S. airlines enjoyed healthy growth in both 
revenues and yields (the average revenue received for carrying one passenger 
one mile), despite sluggish passenger volume increases. 
</P>
<P>
Aided by those trends and by proposed buyouts, airline stocks rose close to 80% 
in the first nine months of 1989 -- three times greater than the Standard &amp; 
Poor's 400-stock index of industrial issues, according to Drexel Burnham 
Lambert. Since their lows in late 1987, airline stocks rose 143.5% versus 39.2% 
for the S&amp;P 400. 
</P>
<P>
Airline stocks outperformed the broad market averages in 1988 and 1989. The 
last time this occurred, Drexel Burnham said, was in 1982 and 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, many analysts predicted that the entire airline industry 
would report a combined operating profit of $3 billion to $3.5 billion for 
1989. That would have surpassed last year's record of $2.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But recently, experts have revised projections downward. 
</P>
<P>
George James, president of Airline Economics Inc., a Washington consulting 
firm, has revised his projection downward to $2 billion to $2.5 billion. Drexel 
Burnham airline analyst Rose Ann Tortora is forecasting operating profits of 
approximately $2 billion, down from her earlier estimate of $3 billion to $3.5 
billion. Further, both Airline Economics and Drexel Burnham are forecasting 
operating profits to fall to $1.2 billion to $1.8 billion in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"We would not own any U.S. airline stocks at this time," Tortora said. "We 
think there is another 10% to 15% downside risk over the coming months." 
</P>
<P>
Profitability is being pressured largely because passenger volume has grown 
only marginally, forcing widespread fare cutting while costs are increasing. 
</P>
<P>
Yields increased 11% and 13%, respectively, during the first and second 
quarters of 1989 as compared to the same periods last year. But they rose only 
1.5% in July and August. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the amount of miles flown on discount fares totaled 92.3% of all 
traffic, as opposed to less than 90% earlier in the year. The greater use of 
discounts are the result of a number of promotions: Kids Fly Free, redemption 
of frequent-flyer mileage and regional fare wars. 
</P>

Treasury bond prices rose sharply Tuesday, sustaining most of their large early 
gains despite an afternoon rebound in the volatile stock market. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraging signs Tuesday that the Federal Reserve would not drive interest 
rates higher to fight inflation, the enemy of fixed-income securities such as 
bonds, also boosted the credit market during a hectic trading day. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, the bellwether 30-year issue gained 
5/32 point, or $4.69 per $1,000 face value, down from as much as 15/32 point 
earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, tumbled 
to 7.89% from 7.93% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The stock market was the real story," said Steven A. Wood, an economist with 
BankAmerica Capital Markets Group in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The rise in Treasury prices followed a pattern established in the Friday the 
13th stock market tumble, when bonds rose sharply as investors shifted money 
out of stocks as the Dow Jones industrial index fell about 190 points. The long 
bond rose about $5 on Monday, after the Dow closed down 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Dow index declined as much as 85 points in the morning session 
before rebounding to finish the day down 3.69 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Half the gains were sustained and that really was a pretty good performance," 
Wood said of Tuesday's dealings. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.688%, up from 8.75% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished lower against most major currencies, depressed by Wall 
Street's volatility and expectations of lower U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The steep morning plunge of more than 80 points in the Dow Jones industrial 
index touched off a heavy but brief flurry of dollar sales that subsided once 
the stock market started to recover later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
David Jaques, a vice president at Barclays Bank PLC in New York, said currency 
dealings were lethargic in the early going, with traders lacking a compelling 
reason to buy or sell. News of a 0.1% decline in September orders for U.S. 
durable goods created barely a ripple in the currency markets because the 
figure virtually matched advance estimates. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar began its trading day in Tokyo with a fall to 142.10 Japanese yen 
from 142.40 yen at Monday's close. Later, in London, it declined further to 
141.95 yen. It was quoted at 141.50 yen in New York, down from 141.90 yen on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound rose to $1.6065 from $1.5945 late Monday. A pound 
cost $1.6075 at the end of New York trading, compared to $1.6030 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures prices nose-dived for the third straight day, dropping to 2 
1/2-month lows on New York's Commodity Exchange on selling fueled by 
perceptions of a weakening economy. 
</P>
<P>
On other futures markets, precious metals advanced; stock index futures 
retreated in a day of wild trading; grain and soybean futures fell; oil futures 
were mixed, and livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures settled 0.9 cent to 4.6 cents lower, with the contract for 
delivery in December down 4.5 cents at $1.151 a pound, its lowest daily close 
since Aug. 11.

TALK OF NEW BID REVERSES SKID IN UAL'S STOCK; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: THE CARRIER MUST PLACATE ITS EMPLOYEES, WHO HAD HOPED THEIR BID WOULD 
FLY BUT ARE NOW LEFT WITHOUT A CONTRACT. 
</P>

<P>
The collapse of a labor-management buyout of UAL Corp. sent the company's stock 
into a nose dive Tuesday only to partly recover late in the day on speculation 
that a new offer for the parent of United Airlines may be imminent. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of a takeover, UAL and its Chairman, Stephen M. Wolf, face a 
number of management challenges just as airline industry earnings are slumping 
amid sluggish passenger volume and heightened competition in the form of fare 
wars. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf faces an army of disgruntled employees without labor contracts who had 
hoped to be owners and had been willing to grant wage and other concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts acknowledge that UAL has much fence mending ahead -- two employee 
groups have already called for Wolf's resignation -- but some contend that 
labor negotiations this year probably won't be made more difficult by the 
buyout's unraveling. Negotiations will continue for months, and the threat of a 
strike is not likely for some time. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf "has got a long row to hoe. It's difficult to say where the starting point 
is even going to be on these (contract negotiations)," said Thomas Longman, an 
airline industry analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., a New York investment 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
"I think right now they just have to concentrate on running the company and let 
the dust settle," said Ray Nedl, an airline analyst with Dillon, Read &amp; 
Co., a brokerage in New York. "United Airlines is still a strong franchise with 
a good management." 
</P>
<P>
UAL's non-management directors said late Monday that the company should remain 
independent, killing hopes for a revival of the faltering $300-a-share buyout 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
UAL's stock reacted to the announcement Tuesday by plunging more than $32 a 
share in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange -- a fall that helped 
precipitate an early selloff in many other stocks. Then new takeover rumors 
brought the stock back to close at $170 per share, down only $8.375 from 
Monday's close. 
</P>
<P>
The price had gone as high as $294 a share after the labor-management bid was 
announced. It started at around $150 before takeover speculation arose in July. 
</P>
<P>
Stock arbitragers, who speculate in takeover stocks, said that some party was 
buying large amounts of UAL stock. One arbitrager said that Bear Stearns had 
acquired 1.5 million shares, presumably on behalf of a client, but that 
purchase could not be confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers were variously rumored to be big-time investors Donald J. Trump, Saul P. 
Steinberg, Robert M. Bass or Coniston Partners, an investor group that two 
years ago forced a restructuring of UAL but now owns less than 5% of its stock. 
Texas investor Bass was earlier said to be interested in UAL and is believed to 
own about 2% of its stock. 
</P>
<P>
The purchaser apparently is not Marvin Davis, who started UAL's takeover 
turmoil in August with a $240-a-share bid. The Los Angeles billionaire can't 
buy more UAL stock because he signed a standstill agreement with the company, 
but he could make a new, higher offer. 
</P>
<P>
A UAL spokesman said the company had not made any announcements and does not 
comment on the activity of its stock. 
</P>
<P>
The unraveling of the labor-management buyout has put a strain on relations 
between UAL executives and rank-and-file employees, observers noted. Wolf, in a 
statement Monday, tried to make the best of the situation by pointing to a 
"substantially improved working relationship" between management and the pilots 
union. 
</P>
<P>
"The company has a big job ahead," said Frank A. Spencer, professor of 
transportation and labor relations at Northwestern University's J. L. Kellogg 
Graduate School of Management. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has to sit down and decide what side their hair is going to be 
parted on and how they're going to approach it," said Spencer, who was a pilot 
with American Airlines for 30 years and a union official for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of issues that everybody has to come to grips with now that 
the buyout has stalled," said Hank Krakowski, spokesman for the pilots' union. 
Pilots had been sporting buttons reading "I'm The Boss" and "Owner-Operator." 
</P>
<P>
"It clearly was kind of a punch" when the buyout fell through, Krakowski said. 
The union still hopes to revive its bid, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Wolf's credibility with employees is poor and it is still in the best interest 
of the company that he resign," said Bill Palmer, organizer of a group that 
claims to represent 25,000 non-union UAL employees. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship between flight attendants and management "has been difficult 
for two years," flight attendants union President Pat Friend said. "I don't see 
how it could get much more difficult. . . . This certainly is a chance for them 
to demonstrate this new working relationship." 
</P>
<P>
The flight attendants, who had joined the pilots in the buyout only last week, 
were particularly disappointed that the UAL board adjourned Monday without 
taking any measures to protect the company from hostile takeovers, Friend said. 
</P>
<P>
The machinists union opposed the buyout and had called for Wolf's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
But employees' barbed comments do not mean that contract negotiations, which as 
a rule are contentious in the airline industry, will become any more 
troublesome, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly events aren't going to make negotiations any easier, but I guess at 
bottom I'm a pragmatist," said Edmund S. Greenslet, an analyst whose Florida 
firm publishes Airline Monitor, a trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a certain amount of rhetoric that's mainly for public 
consumption, but I really don't think that the outcome would be materially 
different than it otherwise would have been," Greenslet said.

Campaign Funds: The U.S. senators caught in the web of controversy over their 
aiding Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan would help the former operators of the 
Irvine-based S&amp;L if they would return more than $175,000 in campaign funds, 
some observers say. 
</P>
<P>
As one lawyer put it, the money would go back to its donors -- Charles H. 
Keating Jr., his family and associates, many of whom could use the pocket 
change to help defend themselves against a civil bank fraud lawsuit that 
regulators filed against them after Lincoln collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
The senators argue that they did nothing wrong, and three of them -- Alan 
Cranston (D-Calif.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and John Glenn (D-Ohio) -- have so 
far refused to return campaign funds contributed by the Keating group. 
</P>
<P>
The others -- Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) -- 
have returned a total of more than $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
Keating is chairman of American Continental Corp. in Phoenix, which was the 
owner of Lincoln. American Continental filed for bankruptcy April 13, and 
regulators seized Lincoln the next day.

Protection for S&amp;L: Guardian Savings &amp; Loan in Huntington Beach, 
worried that it might lose $56 million in gains generated through accounting 
procedures, has arranged for First Interstate Bank to protect it against such a 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement concerning Guardian's $1-billion servicing portfolio is the first 
to protect a thrift or mortgage banker from losses that could occur when 
borrowers pay off home loans earlier than the institution estimated that they 
would, said Brian Cosgrove, an executive at First Interstate in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Thrifts such as Guardian sell many of the loans they originate to investors, 
but the thrifts continue to service the loans, a low-risk operation that 
provides them fee income. In addition to recording the fee income, the 
institutions can also estimate how much they will earn in servicing fees over 
the lives of the loans, reduce that amount to its present value and record it 
as a gain. 
</P>
<P>
But when interest rates fall and borrowers pay off their loans early by 
refinancing them, the thrifts must write off as a loss a portion of those gains 
they recorded. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between Guardian and First Interstate is designed to reimburse 
Guardian for any servicing loss it must take as a result of falling rates and 
early payments of mortgages. The bank insures against that loss through 
hedging, a strategy of trading in options on the bond market to offset 
investment risks. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate has a large options trading desk, Cosgrove said, that can 
handle hedging operations more efficiently than most S&amp;Ls or mortgage 
bankers.

On the mend from its financial woes of earlier this year, General Automation 
Inc. reported Tuesday that it earned $126,000 in its latest quarter but still 
lost money for fiscal 1989. 
</P>
<P>
General Automation, an Anaheim-based supplier of computer systems, software and 
related services, lost $1.6 million for the year ended June 30, compared to a 
loss of $11 million in 1988. Revenue fell 19%, to $41.4 million, down from 
$50.9 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The company, however, reported profits during the last six months of its year 
after reporting heavy losses in 1988 and during the first half of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In January, British-based Sanderson Electronics PLC agreed to provide $4 
million in financing to General Automation in exchange for stock, warrants and 
notes that would give Sanderson up to a 51% stake in the company. Sanderson now 
holds about 35% of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
General Automation's fourth-quarter earnings of $126,000 compare to a whopping 
loss of $8.8 million in the year-earlier period. Revenue, however, dropped 27%, 
to $10.2 million from $13.9 million.

Ropak Corp.: The Fullerton-based packaging manufacturer reported net income of 
$29,000 for the third quarter, contrasted with net income of $932,000 for the 
comparable 1988 period. Revenue rose 4%, to $25.4 million from $24.3 million. 
Ropak's nine-month net income totaled $904,000, contrasted with $2.4 million a 
year ago. Revenues for the first nine months of 1989 rose to $73.9 million, 10% 
higher than the $67.2 million posted for the like period in 1988. William H. 
Roper, chairman and chief executive, said unit sales volume this year has not 
kept pace with efficiency and capacity gains, resulting in lower plant 
utilization. Earnings were also depressed by interest costs associated with 
investments in capital equipment and facilities. Ropak makes plastic packaging 
and handling products for foods, coatings and agricultural and industrial 
materials.

The European Commission is asking EC countries how much they would lift the 
veil of bank secrecy to counter tax fraud once all EC exchange controls are 
scrapped in July. 
</P>
<P>
Christiane Scrivener, the commissioner responsible for tax, asks in a 
confidential questionnaire: "How far are you ready to go, including the 
question of the limits of bank secrecy, to facilitate the exchange of 
information with other member states in cases where tax authorities . . . can 
show that there are clear grounds for presumption of fraud." 
</P>
<P>
She put the list of eight questions to EC finance ministers at a weekend 
meeting in the south of France to work out how to make progress on preventing 
tax fraud. 
</P>
<P>
France insists that free movement of capital in the EC planned for 1990 would 
require parallel measures to prevent citizens from avoiding paying taxes on 
investment income. 
</P>
<P>
Paris fears substantial capital flight from residents who have to pay 
relatively high taxes on such income. 
</P>
<P>
Scrivener intends to base new proposals for battling tax fraud on member 
states' responses. Ministers are due to discuss them at a meeting in Luxembourg 
on Oct. 9.

THERE'S NO MONOPOLY ON GOOD GAME IDEAS, BUT JUST TRY SELLING ONE 
</P>

Ask experts on the toy and game market what the chances are of successfully 
introducing a new board game -- let alone a phenomenal best-seller such as 
Trivial Pursuit -- and they will say you have a better chance of winning the 
California Lottery. 
</P>
<P>
The $500-million board game market has always been saturated and difficult to 
crack, industry observers say, but it is even tougher to break into these days, 
with Trivial Pursuit clones crowding the adult market and glitzy video games 
luring children's attention away from board games. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Carlat, editor of Toy and Hobby World magazine, a leading trade 
publication in New York, said: "The average guy who thinks he's come up with a 
great game idea usually heads straight for a Milton Bradley or a Parker 
Brothers, expecting that they'll take his idea and make him a millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
"But in reality, you'll be lucky if they don't slam the door in your face." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Practically Nil' Chance 
</P>
<P>
Diane Cardinale, a spokeswoman for the Toy Manufacturers of America, an 
industry trade association, is equally discouraging. Asked about the difficulty 
of launching a new game, she said, "I would say your chances are practically 
nil." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all that, a San Diego landscape architect turned game inventor named 
Craig E. Allison thinks that he can defy the odds. Allison and his partners 
conceived and developed this summer Strokeamoby, a board game that tries to 
capture the excitement and disappointment of trying to catch the big one in a 
bass-fishing tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Strokeamoby boasts sponsorship of the sport's biggest promoters, including the 
Future Fisherman Foundation. Those imprimaturs, combined with the game's 
peculiar name ("stroke a Moby" is fishing jargon for landing a hefty female 
bass) should attract a significant percentage of the millions of this country's 
fresh-water fishermen, Allison said. 
</P>
<P>
Allison's game will not be available to the public until June. Because giant 
manufacturers hardly ever accept ideas from novice game makers, such 
entrepreneurs as Allison usually pay for initial production and distribution on 
their own. He and his partners said they are ready to invest $200,000 to pay 
for the manufacturing and marketing of their game through sporting goods, bait 
and tackle shops. 
</P>
<P>
The investors' hope is that Strokeamoby will sell well enough at $19.95 a game 
that they will be in a position to sell the game to such major manufacturers as 
Parker Brothers or Milton Bradley, receiving royalties from future sales. 
</P>
<P>
A nice scenario, to be sure, but industry experts said the odds of success are 
stacked against Allison. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't imagine how many people call us every day believing that they have 
the idea, the next Trivial Pursuit," said Stacy Botwinick, associate editor of 
Playthings, a leading toy and games industry magazine based in New York. "But 
the truth is, nobody is going to buy an idea." 
</P>
<P>
The inventor, if no one else, remains optimistic. Allison, who has been 
successful with a new game once before, is confident that he has a winner. 
</P>
<P>
Besides finding a novel concept, he has already covered other game-launching 
steps, such as financing and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
And he thinks that he has found a rich vein of potential customers. Unlike 
other sports such as baseball and football, which have more than their share of 
games, fishing has been overlooked by the game industry, said Allison, who got 
into the business when he tried to create a one-of-a-kind game for his children 
a couple of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I was a little skeptical about the idea too," said Allison, who was 
approached by bass fishermen who were co-workers at his landscape architecture 
firm. They were interested in seeing their sport in a board game. 
</P>
<P>
After some research, he discovered Americans' love affair with fishing. "That's 
when I realized that there was potential for a huge marketplace," Allison said. 
</P>
<P>
If his game is stocked at bait and tackle shops and sporting goods stores, he 
said, fishermen can pick up Strokeamoby along with a new fishing rod. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you ever hung around with fishermen? These people can't leave a tackle 
store without buying something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still No Guarantee 
</P>
<P>
Allison may have found a niche, but that does not mean the people in the niche 
will buy his game, Carlat noted: "I'm a basketball freak, but that doesn't mean 
I'm going to go out and buy Larry Bird's basketball board game." 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, the success of games such as Trivial Pursuit and Pictionary 
would seem to have helped board games regain the popularity they lost with the 
advent of video games in the early 1980s. In 1988, for example, board game 
sales were $512 million, according to Toy Manufacturers of America, up sharply 
from $377 million in 1982, when video games had their most profound impact. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, many game inventors now think that selling board games is a path 
to riches. Not so, Carlat said. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides Trivial Pursuit and Pictionary, how many other hot board games can you 
name?" he asked. "The sales of those two games have really skewed the picture. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so difficult to attract board game buyers. You're competing against so 
many other things, against movies and other leisure-time activities. People 
don't seem to realize that games like Trivial Pursuit and Pictionary come along 
maybe once in a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, game inventors, large and small, are introducing many 
adult-oriented board games. 
</P>
<P>
"What Trivial Pursuit and Pictionary have done is opened the board game 
manufacturers' eyes to the adult market," Carlat said. 
</P>
<P>
Pursuing the older game player also allows game makers to recoup sales they 
have lost to video-game manufacturers. Children's games retail for about $10, 
and most adult games sell for $20 to $30. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, industry officials expect plenty of Trivial Pursuit clones or 
"social interaction" games to appear on store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
"When something pops in the toy business," Carlat said, "then every major 
company will come up with a similar product and try to ride the bandwagon. What 
you get is a tremendous oversaturation, and then everybody suffers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid that's what we're beginning to see. People in the game business are 
notorious for killing the golden goose." 
</P>
<P>
With game inventors rushing to pitch their winning ideas to manufacturers, 
industry experts said selling a game concept, traditionally a difficult task, 
will become even harder. 
</P>
<P>
"Selling a game idea is probably one of the hardest things to do," said 
Cardinale, the Toy Manufacturers of America spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Because major manufacturers have a staff of game inventors, they rarely accept 
unsolicited ideas, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sticking With Their Own 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, if they take outside ideas, they would have to pay the inventor 
royalties," she said. "If one of their own comes up with a winner, all they 
have to do is pay that person his regular salary." 
</P>
<P>
Cardinale added: "You have to realize that a manufacturer puts a lot of money 
behind the introduction of a new product. They're not going to take a risk on 
an unproven concept." 
</P>
<P>
So how does a novice game inventor get a game out on the market? 
</P>
<P>
"Go out and pound the pavement," said Botwinick, the associate editor of 
Playthings. "Go store to store in your neighborhood. You've got to start small. 
Until you can prove that your product sells, you won't be able to get the 
attention of the big game makers." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, industry experts strongly urge aspiring game inventors to attend 
toy fairs -- particularly the one sponsored by the Toy Manufacturers of America 
-- where retailers and buyers come in droves, hoping to find next year's 
best-seller. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, if you want to get something to the American buyer, you have to 
come to our show," Cardinale said. The group's show is the largest toy trade 
fair in the United States -- second-largest in the world -- and attracts more 
than 17,000 buyers and 1,100 exhibitors annually. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advertising Space on Board 
</P>
<P>
Allison plans to attend TMA's toy fair as well as other exhibition shows but 
said his planned "instant-distribution network" will allow him to worry less 
about finding distributors at such fairs. He is trying to sell 16 game spaces 
on his game board as ad slots for fishing equipment manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
"According to my plan, the manufacturer actually becomes part of the board 
game," Allison said. "A player could land on a certain spot that actually 
features a manufacturer's logo. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever buys advertising space will have a vested interest in having the game 
do well. The manufacturer can sell the game to his established network of 
dealers, along with his other products. Once I get manufacturers to advertise 
on my game, I get an instant-distribution network." 
</P>
<P>
Allison has contacted more than 300 fishing equipment manufacturers in hope of 
landing their ads on his board. The inventor is charging $100,000 per game 
space and has not yet signed any advertisers. But he emphasized that he and his 
partners will put up $200,000 of their own money to pay for the game if the 
"distribution network" idea fails. 
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, Allison -- in a partnership he has since left -- started a 
board game called Skaters Only for skateboarders, using the same 
instant-distribution concept. Eight skateboard equipment manufacturers paid 
$8,000 each to advertise on the board. The partnership declined to say how the 
game is faring now. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Allison will succeed this time remains uncertain, but "what he's trying 
to do is certainly a very acceptable strategy," Carlat said. 
</P>
<P>
More important, industry experts said Allison has the right "mental approach" 
for the game-launching business. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I would love to be a millionaire," Allison said. "But I'm not greedy. 
Trying to develop a game is a game in itself. I'm having fun doing this."

YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIGN -- REALTY LISTING CONTRACT IS OPEN TO NEGOTIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN L. JAMES, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine this scenario. You've carefully selected an agent to sell your house. 
He hands you a form granting him an exclusive, six-month right to sell the 
place -- no cancellation allowed. You panic at the terms yet sign anyway, 
figuring the standard contract is unbendable. Right or wrong? Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Although most agents -- representing their brokers -- will come up with a 
standard listing contract, you don't have to go with that contract," advises 
Beauty Stephens, who sells homes through the Century 21 chain. 
</P>
<P>
If your house languishes on the market unsold or your relationship with the 
agent sours, you could come to want a shorter contract or one that lets you out 
easily. And the law gives you every right to seek such a contract. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, virtually every aspect of the listing agreement is open to negotiation 
-- including the time it stays in force and how fast you can declare it null 
and void. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, many realty companies strongly favor in-house forms or those passed 
out by local realty boards. Such forms are drafted in cautious legalese and 
have the blessing of a company's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, as William Echols, a vice president of the realty chain RE-MAX of 
California, observed: "Even the standard forms leave blanks -- giving you 
latitude as to what's filled in." Besides commissions, Echols says, flexible 
items often include the duration of a contract and the terms for its 
cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
"You should have the right to fire the broker or agent if you're not 
satisfied," says Patricia Collins, who sells homes through Long &amp; Foster, a 
mid-Atlantic chain. The company routinely grants sellers the right to cancel a 
listing with 24 hours' notice if they're unhappy with the agent. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to realize that selling a house is one of the most emotionally 
stressful times in peoples' lives," Collins says. "Nobody should be trying to 
sell a house when they're unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
A clash in personalities can provide one good reason for canceling a listing 
contract, according to Collins. "Maybe the agent is too laid-back for you or 
too intense." You may have thought you had chosen the agent carefully yet the 
differences in style didn't surface during the original, honeymoon period when 
the agent was seeking to sell you his services. 
</P>
<P>
Some sellers -- especially first-time sellers -- need a lot of hand-holding. 
They thrive on constant, daily updates from their agents. At the other extreme 
are introverts who feel bothered by an agent who calls with any but the most 
significant news. If either type is wrongly paired with an agent, the 
relationship can soon break down. 
</P>
<P>
An agent's response time can also become an issue. "Some sellers find their 
agents inaccessible, and that's bad," says Stephens, of Century 21. For any 
good reason, an agent should be readily reachable -- whether during business 
hours, evenings or weekends. A seller's message should be returned the same day 
-- if not by the agent, then someone assigned to cover for him. 
</P>
<P>
"My body clock has been tuned to stay up late," says Stephens, who often finds 
herself on the phone until midnight with clients who have long commutes and 
keep late schedules. When she's not in, she uses an answering machine to take 
messages, though "a lot of people are turned off by them," she allows. 
</P>
<P>
Besides finding an agent accessible, a seller has the right to expect the agent 
will actively market his property. When the listing is first put out, this 
often involves a "brokers' open," a festive preview to which other realty 
people are invited. It may also involve public open houses, neighborhood flyers 
and other promotional techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Active marketing should, in all cases, involve advertising as well as prompt 
and thorough follow-up between the listing agent and others who have taken 
potential buyers through the property. If these things aren't being done -- and 
the agent offers no plausible explanation -- then the seller may have good 
cause for cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, some sellers cancel listing contracts for the wrong reasons. It's a 
naive seller who blames the realty agent for his failure to quickly unload a 
home in a slower-than-average market. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes sellers are unrealistic in their expectations," says Connie Callow, 
sales manager of Town &amp; Country Properties in Ft. Washington, Md., a 
Washington suburb. A Ft. Washington seller with a $170,000 home for sale can 
expect to wait 90 and 120 days, according to Callow. She says the same property 
would have sold in less than 60 days in the spring of 1988, a peppier market. 
</P>
<P>
An unrealistic seller who cancels his listing agreement impulsively may be 
acting to his own disadvantage. Fair play suggests you give a competent realty 
agent time to do the job properly. 
</P>
<P>
"Compare it to a car going across the desert -- you've got to have enough gas 
to get to the other side," says Collins, the Long &amp; Foster sales manager. 
Unless you've changed your mind about selling, it would be silly to cancel your 
listing agreement right before an announced open house or on the eve of an 
advertising blitz. Not only would your last-minute cancellation waste your 
agent's money (these marketing tools can be costly) but it might cause 
confusion about your property in the public's mind. 
</P>
<P>
It would also be unfair to fire your agent because, after you insisted on 
pricing your property higher than the market, it sat unsold for a lengthy 
period. The best agent in the world is unlikely to move an overpriced property. 
</P>
<P>
Be suspicious of an opportunistic agent who attempts to lure you away from your 
listing agreement before it expires. Known in the industry as "going behind a 
for-sale sign," the practice is unethical yet increasingly common, according to 
Callow, the Town &amp; Country realtor. 
</P>
<P>
Although -- for continuity's sake -- it's better not to change agents at any 
point in your contract, it's wise to give yourself that option, should you need 
to use it. 
</P>
<P>
Several major U.S realty chains routinely offer 24-hour cancellation clauses 
and others let you cancel with 10 days' notice. RE-MAX agents, who are 
basically self-employed while working within the context of a broker's office, 
may be especially flexible in negotiating terms. Yet, in all cases, remember 
that negotiation is a real possibility. 
</P>
<P>
One footnote. If you reach the end of your listing contract with an unsold 
house, don't assume it's an absolute certainty that your agent will renew. An 
occasional seller is so irritating or demanding that the agent wants to drop 
him.

<P>
Conditions are nearly ideal as John Fales heads briskly out the front door with 
his butterfly net and a worn green canvas bag slung over his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
It's 75 degrees on a mostly sunny afternoon in the early fall. A gentle breeze 
ripples the waters of Chesapeake Bay, a short walk from Fales' home at Plum 
Point in Calvert County, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Fales records the temperature from a gauge atop a pole in his yard and writes 
down the time. Ready now, he scans the shrubs in his yard and the sky overhead. 
He is quickly rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
"There goes one," he says, glimpsing a monarch butterfly as it flutters 
overhead, too high to catch. 
</P>
<P>
The monarch is flying due south, following an ancient migratory path to its 
winter home in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
No other insect migrates as the monarch does. Each fall, millions east of the 
Rockies from Texas to Canada fly south, to return in the spring. Those in the 
West winter near the coast in Southern California and Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
Despite decades of study, scientists cannot fully explain the phenomenon. Do 
they navigate by the sun or take their cue from the Earth's magnetic field? No 
one knows. The mystery enhances the allure of one of the most beautiful and 
popular of butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
The migration is easily observed in early fall. The butterfly's distinctive 
wings of burnt orange, black and white as well as its larger-than-average size 
make it stand out. You can spot monarchs as they stop to feed in gardens, along 
the beach or at the sides of highways. Or just look up. 
</P>
<P>
"Between Labor Day and the middle of October, on any really sunny day I could 
go out in the mall and see them flying overhead," says Robert K. Robbins, 
research entomologist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
There might be one monarch or many. Philip Kean, a member of the Maryland 
Entomological Society, once saw thousands clustered in a field of tick weed 
sunflowers near in Anne Arundel County, "tanking up for the trip home." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists assume that the monarch has been making this annual journey for 
thousands of years; whether they can continue it will depend on actions of its 
worst enemy: people. The butterfly's winter homes are under assault. In Mexico, 
poor people living next to the forests of coyumel firs where the monarchs stay 
have cut into them for timber and to clear land for crops. In California, 
developers' projects have destroyed the insects' habitat. 
</P>
<P>
A number of private organizations and the government of Mexico, however, have 
taken action in the '80s to prevent irreversible damage. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico's efforts in particular are noteworthy. In an impoverished country where 
environment often takes a back seat to economy, the national government has 
established monarch refuges. The refuges, or reservas, are a two-hour drive 
southwest of Mexico City in an area of about 1,500 square miles. Despite the 
official designation, however illegal encroachment has occurred. 
Preservationists believe that the monarch's security depends on developing 
economic alternatives for the resentful residents nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very, very poor people," said Alfredo Arellano, a biologist with the 
Monarch Civil Assn., a private group in Mexico City. "They want work." 
</P>
<P>
Even limited logging can hurt the monarch, however. Thinning of the forest 
results in higher temperatures in the day and lower ones at night, upsetting an 
environment that would otherwise be a perfect spot for the mariposa monarch to 
spend the winter. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists say that if the temperature rises too much, the monarchs become too 
active, burning energy they need to survive and to make the return flight 
north. If it becomes too cold, the monarchs die. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the Xerces Society and National Wildlife Federation are 
among the organizations supporting efforts to preserve the monarch. A number of 
scientists are trying to unravel its secrets, with the assistance of volunteers 
such as Fales who pass on their observations and tag butterflies so that they 
can be tracked. 
</P>
<P>
Fales has been collecting butterflies of all kinds since 1942. He was an 
entomologist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture research facility in 
Beltsville, Md., until 1972, when he retired and moved with his wife to their 
small house overlooking the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Fales, who is fit and nimble at age 76, snares the butterflies with a quick 
snap of his net and tags them with the dexterity of a surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
He spots what looks like a monarch perched in a patch of wildflowers. It turns 
out to be a viceroy, a look-alike that often fools an untrained eye. The 
viceroy also fools birds, which generally avoid monarchs because the chemicals 
derived from the butterflies' ingestion of milkweed, their favorite food, make 
them a poisonous meal. 
</P>
<P>
Fales soon nets the real thing. Kneeling, he opens the bag to extracts his 
tools: a peanut jar containing ethyl acetate, which he uses to kill butterflies 
he intends to collect, and a small box. 
</P>
<P>
Fales removes the struggling butterfly from the net and lays it on the yellow 
jar top, his thick fingers holding it gently in place. He takes a marker and, 
with the pointed end, delicately scrapes off a small patch of scales on both 
sides of the top right wing, being careful not to poke through the wing 
membrane. Then he picks up a folded gummed tag a bit larger than a thumbtack 
and places it on the cleared area of the wing, pressing gently. 
</P>
<P>
The white tag has a number, 1099, and the address of the Natural History Museum 
in Los Angeles, where monarch research data is collected. So far, none of the 
butterflies Fales has tagged during the past four years has turned up. 
</P>
<P>
Fales then tosses the tagged monarch into the air. It obstinately heads 
northward, ignoring Fales' prediction that it would go the other way. He seems 
mildly surprised, but the other butterflies he tags this afternoon do fly 
south. 
</P>
<P>
The typical generation of monarch does not live more than a month, Fales says, 
but the migrating generation can live long enough to survive the winter and a 
trip of perhaps 2,500 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the mystery is that no one is sure how far north a monarch makes it 
back in the spring. Fales has caught tired specimens whose colors have faded 
and wings have become ragged, suggesting that their trips had started far to 
the south. Scientists are certain, however, that the butterflies mate along the 
journey north, producing new generations that join the migration. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been monitoring the monarchs for many years," Fales says. "In the last 
couple of years, it's been in short supply. We're trying to figure out what's 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 and 1988, Fales said, there was not a "massive fall migration" -- 
during one of those, you can spot 100 in a 10-minute period. The numbers have 
so far been small this year, he said, although higher than they were for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In Mexico, preservationists have discovered four new wintering sites, all in 
the same region, according to a report last summer by Fred Urquhart. Urquhart 
is the Canadian scientist who deserves much of the credit for discovering the 
monarch's winter homes. 
</P>
<P>
For many years, scientists suspected that monarchs migrated to Mexico, but they 
did not know where. Finally, in 1975, an American named Kenneth Brugger, using 
information from Urquhart, found a colony of monarchs. Local residents, of 
course, had known all along about the butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
In the 14 years since, the butterflies have acquired many friends, the 
Entomological Society of America among them. The society is one of more than 11 
groups seeking to make the butterfly the national insect. 
</P>
<P>
Mexicans are also fond of their colorful visitors, and one refuge is open to 
the public to accommodate the increasing number of people who want to see an 
unusual sight. 
</P>
<P>
On a chilly morning last January, for instance, tens of thousands of monarchs 
-- too many to estimate -- were clumped like leaves in the branches of tall fir 
trees in a forest in the state ofMichoacan more than 7,000 feet above sea 
level. As the sun climbed higher into the sky, warming the air, the butterflies 
begin to stir. Thousands begin to fly between the trees and to light on bushes. 
A few settled on the awe-struck people who had trekked up a steep unpaved path 
to the refuge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a glorious silent dance," whispered Connecticut artist Lois Read as she 
painted the scene in watercolors.

COLOR IT TOYOTASAURUS WRECK: CAR ART HEADED FOR JUNK HEAP

Another dinosaur bites the dust. 
</P>
<P>
"Toyotasaurus Tyrannicus," the Toyota station wagon/art installation towed from 
the Laguna Canyon site of "The Tell" 600-foot-long photomural, will go to the 
junk heap, said artist Mark Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just returning to earth," said Chamberlain, who co-organized "The Tell" 
project and half-buried his former car nearby as part of its anti-development 
message. 
</P>
<P>
"Toyotasaurus" was exhumed and towed by the City of Laguna Beach earlier this 
month and impounded at Larry Hunt Auto Body Center where it has been 
accumulating impound fees for about three weeks. Tuesday morning, Chamberlain 
received notification that a lien of $275 (an amount growing at $12 a day) had 
been placed on the car. 
</P>
<P>
Chamberlain, who acknowledges that he was never given permission to bury a car 
at the mural site, claims that he was never told that the auto was going to be 
towed and charges that "a form of censorship" therefore occurred. City 
officials assert that the artist was definitely told that the vehicle was going 
to be removed because it had been installed without permission. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the artist says the 1977 vehicle is ready to go to scrap and is 
worth neither his own money nor time to salvage. The auto body center has been 
told to dispose of the car and intends to do so on Nov. 4, he says. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the city will pay all impound charges incurred. 
</P>
<P>
"It was on city property, and we were the ones that hauled it out," explained 
Laguna Beach City Councilwoman Martha Collison. "We didn't want to make it an 
issue. It wasn't the purpose to stick him (with the bill)." 
</P>
<P>
Chamberlain added that the whereabouts of Irving, a manikin that sat at the 
car's steering wheel and last seen before the auto was towed, are still 
unknown.

SUSPECT ARRESTED IN $900,000 JEWEL THEFT FROM VAN NUYS CLERK

<P>
A man accused of taking part in a $900,000 theft from a Van Nuys jewelry 
saleswoman last summer was in jail today after he was spotted by detectives on 
surveillance in the Wilshire District, Los Angeles police said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin Lopez, 26, a Colombian national who police believe is a member of a ring 
responsible for $200 million in jewelry thefts in Los Angeles last year, was 
arrested Tuesday night and was being held in lieu of $1-million bail, Detective 
Michael Woodings said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez was wanted on a warrant charging him with burglary from the auto of 
Sandra Smith on Aug. 25, Woodings said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a sales representative for Van Lightner Jewelry in Van Nuys, was 
carrying the jewels in a canvas bag when her car overheated in Hollywood, 
causing her to stop, Woodings said. When Smith attempted to get help, four 
suspects ran to her car, broke a window, grabbed the jewels and fled. Later it 
was discovered that Smith's radiator hose had been slashed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Fingerprints connected Lopez to the scene, Woodings said. At the time of his 
arrest, detectives were watching other members of the alleged theft ring when 
they noticed Lopez, he said.

Belgium will offer sanctuary to Colombian judges threatened by the country's 
drug barons, the Justice Ministry said today. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman said Justice Minister Melchior Wathelet decided to grant 
residency to Colombian magistrates after meeting the leader of their 
professional organization, Nino Perez, last week. 
</P>
<P>
Judges have been among the main targets of bombings and killings by Colombian 
drug cartels since the Bogota government declared war on cocaine traffickers 
two months ago, backed with legal powers to extradite ringleaders to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The Colombian Embassy in Brussels said discussions had started with Belgian 
authorities on the practical details of Wathelet's offer.

SENATE ADDS TO QUAKE AID OKD BY HOUSE;

RELIEF: $600 MILLION FOR EMERGENCY LOANS BY SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION ADDED

<P>
The Senate today overwhelmingly passed a $3.45-billion relief package for 
earthquake-damaged Northern California which substantially expands aid approved 
by the House. 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 97 to 1, the Senate approved the plan and sent it back to the 
House as part of a wide-ranging spending bill that must reach President Bush's 
desk tonight to keep the federal government from defaulting. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Gordon J. Humphrey (R-N.H.) cast the only negative vote. Not voting were 
Sens. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.). 
</P>
<P>
The Senate accepted the House-passed $2.85-billion earthquake allocation and, 
responding to pleas from California lawmakers, added to it $600 million more 
for Small Business Administration emergency loans. 
</P>
<P>
"California will be eligible to receive immediately $3.45 billion," said Sen. 
Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). "It is very likely that the ultimate federal cost for 
the disaster may be higher . . . for a community that has been badly shaken." 
</P>
<P>
"People who are dislocated from their homes and businesses need that assistance 
now," said Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), who called the Senate action "generous 
and sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to go for what you can and we've done that," said Rep. Vic Fazio 
(D-Sacramento), who led his delegation's unsuccessful effort in the House for 
even more money -- $3.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The House measure, passed 321 to 99 on Tuesday, included $500 million for the 
SBA, $1.1 billion for Federal Emergency Management Agency repair efforts and $1 
billion for the Federal Highway Administration's emergency fund. It also set up 
a $250-million fund for Bush to spend at his discretion. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to expanding the SBA money, the Senate approved waivers of federal 
rules, denied in the House bill, that would let the state get more federal 
money quickly with less commitment of local and state funds. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston estimated the total cost of the damage to the San Francisco Bay Area 
from the Oct. 17 earthquake exceeded $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Quick Senate action was needed because the aid was attached to a stopgap 
spending bill needed to avert a government shutdown Thursday. The bill is 
required because Congress and the President have failed to enact 11 of the 13 
annual appropriations bills required for the government to operate in fiscal 
1990, which began Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
A top House leadership aide said he expected that a modest expansion in the 
Senate would be acceptable in that chamber. Both houses must agree on a single 
version before it can be sent to the President. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday that Bush could accept the 
House version of the assistance plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration had proposed $1.5 billion in new federal spending, plus 
earmarking another $1 billion for quake relief. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the urgency of the situation, the Californians said they are seeking 
as much as they can get now, while the quake is still fresh on the nation's 
consciousness, but will come back for more later.

A torrent of mud fell onto the Nova Republica slum in the southern section of 
Brazil's biggest city Tuesday night, and firemen estimated there was enough to 
fill 5,000 trucks. "There are places where there is more than (20 feet) of 
earth," one fireman said.

'SINATRA DOCTRINE' AT WORK IN WARSAW PACT, SOVIET SAYS

Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennadi I. Gerasimov today said the Soviet 
Union has adopted the "Sinatra Doctrine" in its policy toward Warsaw Pact 
nations -- they can do things their way. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov appeared on ABC's "Good Morning America" to discuss the speech 
delivered Monday by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in which he 
said that the Soviets now recognize the absolute freedom of choice of all 
countries, specifically the Warsaw Pact nations. 
</P>
<P>
That marks a huge departure from the past, in which Eastern European countries

"We now have the Frank Sinatra doctrine," said Gerasimov. "He has a song, 'I 
(Did) It My Way.' So every country decides on its own which road to take." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if that includes an absolute rejection of any military force against any 
Eastern nation, Gerasimov replied: 
</P>
<P>
"That's for sure . . . political structures must be decided by the people who 
live there." 
</P>
<P>
But what, he was asked, if the Communist Party were to be rejected in a 
country? 
</P>
<P>
"Take Poland," replied Gerasimov. "There are new faces there."

The State Bank today announced a tenfold decrease in the value of the ruble 
against the dollar for people and firms needing convertible currency to travel 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The new rate, set at 6.26 rubles to the dollar, is a tacit admission by Soviet 
authorities that the ruble is not worth anything approaching the existing 
official rate of .6277 to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement, reported by Tass press agency, indicated the standard rate 
will remain in effect for most transactions, such as for foreign firms doing 
business in the Soviet Union and for most international trade with the West. 
</P>
<P>
Because the ruble cannot be freely exchanged for dollars, yen, marks and other 
hard currencies, it has virtually no value outside the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Tass gave no explanation for the devaluation, and Igor Kozlovsky, deputy chief 
of the joint currency economics department of the Finance Ministry, refused to 
give more details on the decision. He would say only that it had been approved 
by the Council of Ministers.

The European Community today rejected a newly proposed U.S. plan for farm trade 
reform, saying it was a backward step aimed at eliminating the EC's Common 
Agricultural Policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Such an approach cannot be shared by the community, which thereby considers 
that the American proposal is not an adequate basis for negotiations," the EC 
delegation at world trade talks said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-nation community was commenting on a comprehensive U.S. proposal that 
called for elimination of farm export subsidies in five years, and substantial 
cuts in barriers to free farm trade over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The United States presented the plan at a session of a negotiating group on 
agriculture at the 105-nation Uruguay Round of world trade talks being 
conducted under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

DREXEL MAKES GLITZY PITCH FOR JUNK BONDS IN TOKYO

Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., whose Beverly Hills office pioneered high-yield 
bonds, rolled out a bit of Hollywood glitz in Tokyo today to try to breathe 
life into the sagging U.S. junk bond market. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese investors hold only about 5% of outstanding junk bonds and analysts 
fear that share could erode in the wake of highly publicized problems in the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Eight junk bond issuers, led by Drexel Chairman John Shad, made private pitches 
to local investors who were enticed to come to a conference by the attractions 
of a sports clinic and dinner with a top Japanese television star. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel provided artificial golf-putting greens and miniature driving ranges for 
its guests. Later, women pros held a short seminar. 
</P>
<P>
And at dinner, popular Tokyo TV host and singer Akiko Wada performed for about 
300 persons attending. Waitresses were decked out in traditional kimono or 
Playboy-bunny-like outfits and fishnet stockings. 
</P>
<P>
At some of the presentations, a team of technicians sat perched behind a bank 
of TV monitors and light controls worthy of a rock concert. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very entertaining program," one Japanese investor said. "Nobody went 
to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
But Japanese investors may not have been impressed enough to increase their 
holdings of the high-yield bonds. "We are very cautious and a little worried," 
said another investor.

NEW SEC CHIEF HAILS AGENCY HANDLING OF 190 POINT PLUNGE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new head of the Securities and Exchange Commission told a congressional 
panel today the handling of Wall Street's 190 point plunge on Oct. 13 shows 
"the value of the market improvements adopted during the past two years." 
</P>
<P>
SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden was the star witness before a House panel on 
market reform. 
</P>
<P>
It was Breeden's first public questioning since the Dow Jones industrial 
average plunged 190.58 points on Oct. 13. The Dow rebounded to close up 88.12 
points the following Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We learned important lessons from the market turbulence of Oct. 13 and Oct. 16 
and the market's responses to it," Breeden said. 
</P>
<P>
"The volume surges and volatility experienced on those two days exemplify 
fundamental changes in our markets; they were not isolated instances. We should 
not panic in the face of these events, however. For what was demonstrated on 
Oct. 13 and 16 was the strength and resiliency of the nation's markets." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that more shares were traded in one hour during the Oct. 13 slide 
"than were traded on the average full day in 1985" and three times the market's 
average daily volume 10 years ago.

24% EARNING HIKE FOR SARA LEE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sara Lee Corp. reported record first-quarter earnings today, a 24.1% increase 
over the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings for the three months ending Sept. 30, the company's first fiscal 
quarter, rose to $93.8 million from $75.6 million for the same period last 
year, Sara Lee said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings per share increased 15.4% to 75 cents, compared with 65 cents a year 
ago. The lower percentage increase in earnings per share relative to the 24.1% 
earnings increase is due to a higher level of preferred dividends and more 
common shares outstanding in the current quarter, the Chicago-based company 
said.

NOT SOFT ON MARSHMALLOW TOSSERS, UNIVERSITY WARNS

University of Michigan officials cannot be accused of being soft on rule 
enforcement, but rule violations are going soft on them. 
</P>
<P>
The school announced plans to add marshmallows to the list of objects banned 
from Michigan Stadium during Wolverine football games. Already banned are 
umbrellas, coolers, chair backs, backpacks and alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
"This sounds funny, but it's a real problem," Bruce Madej, Michigan director of 
sports information, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fans in the student section began pitching marshmallows at each other during 
the season opener against Notre Dame, and the activity has stuck. 
</P>
<P>
During an Oct. 7 game, the attention shifted to band members and cheerleaders, 
who were peppered with the candies. Thousands of marshmallows littered one end 
of the stadium after it was all over. 
</P>
<P>
Marshmallows aren't harmless, Michigan officials said. Some fans press together 
several marshmallows to create a gooey ball. Mixed with water, the concoction 
can become as hard as a golf ball, said Jack Weidenbach, Michigan's senior 
associate athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a number of complaints," Weidenbach said. "One woman said she got 
hit and had a red spot on her cheek that bothered her all day. There are 
concerns that somebody will get hurt."

PGA REJECTS BREAK FOR FOREIGN GOLFERS

<P>
The PGA Tour has rejected a move by foreign golfers to reduce the number of 
tournaments they must play in the United States each season, retaining its 
minimum of 15 events. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Deane Beman blamed the attitude of "certain foreign players" 
Tuesday for the failure of his proposal for members of overseas circuits to 
compete in only 12 events to retain their membership in the U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting several foreign stars last summer at the U.S. Open, Beman drew up 
a plan that would allow overseas players to compete in only 12 events. Three of 
them would have been from a list of weaker tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
His plan was tentatively approved in August by the Tour's policy board, but the 
same group reversed its position and rejected the proposal at a meeting this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan did not receive the full support of the foreign players, our own 
membership and the tournament sponsors," Beman said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"We were disappointed because a similar proposal was made a couple of years ago 
and it failed," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposal met with hostility from the majority of U.S. players," Beman 
said, "while the leading foreign players felt it did not go far enough. Certain 
foreign players undercut the proposal, so it just couldn't go through." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign golfers who discussed the issue with Beman at the U.S. Open were Seve 
Ballesteros of Spain, Nick Faldo and Sandy Lyle of Britain and Bernhard Langer 
of West Germany, who play on the European tour, and Isao Aoki of Japan, who 
also plays in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros, a frequent critic of Beman, expressed skepticism about the new 
plan, and Faldo said he doubted that it would make the situation easier for the 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros lost his PGA membership in 1986 for failing to play in enough 
events. Since then he has played in only a few U.S. tournaments each year plus 
the major championships, which are outside the jurisdiction of the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
In another move, the policy board approved a proposal to grant the winner of 
the British Open a 10-year exemption from qualifying to all PGA Tour events, 
beginning in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"The Open is one of the most revered championships in the world, and the board 
decided it should be recognized for what it is," Beman said. 
</P>
<P>
Only five other tournaments carry 10-year exemptions for tour events: the U.S. 
Open, the Masters, the PGA championship, the Players Championship and the World 
Series of Golf. 
</P>
<P>
Money won at the British Open will still not be counted on the PGA earnings 
rankings.
