HIGH-SPEED TRAIN TO LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I see that the local politicians are debating whether the proposed Las Vegas 
high-speed train should terminate in Anaheim or Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
With Southern California suffocating in smog and traffic congestion, billions 
of dollars are proposed to be spent on transporting people on a "gamblers' 
special" train out of the state. I wish I had thought of that! 
</P>
<P>
An even better idea would be to run the train in one direction only -- towards 
Las Vegas. That way we'd solve our congestion problems and I further suggest 
that those politicians debating this non-issue be given free passes on the 
first train.

THE ENVIRONMENT AND WATER NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The column by Marc Reisner ("Planting Seeds for a Water Harvest," Op-Ed Page, 
Oct. 3) concerning the availability of water in Southern California is correct 
in every respect, and yet it proves again that when water is discussed, 
everything else is set aside. 
</P>
<P>
In this case Reisner considers Metropolitan Water District's water purchase 
from Imperial Irrigation District as an ". . . all-carrot and no-stick approach 
. . ." to the water problem, where MWD gets at least 100,000 acre-feet of 
water, up to a possible 420,000 acre-feet of water in the future. The 100,000 
acre-feet water has, supposedly, been conserved over the past number of years 
by IID, and the additional water is to be conserved by IID over the next number 
of years. But where is that water now going, and what effect will its loss have 
on the environment? 
</P>
<P>
The overflow from IID's antiquated irrigation system has been maintaining what 
is now California's largest inland body of water, the Salton Sea. And now it is 
suffering. The Salton Sea will shrink in size because that water will be 
conserved, and the flow to the sea will be cut back, since water for human 
consumption always wins out over the environment. But that does not mean the 
Salton Sea has to die. 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of programs available that can help keep the Salton Sea at a 
livable salinity while the inflow is cut back and the body of water shrinks, 
but even with coordinated local, state and federal efforts in the form of the 
Salton Sea Task Force in Sacramento, things aren't moving fast enough to save 
it. The Salton Sea is shrinking, and the salinity is increasing at an 
astounding rate. 
</P>
<P>
The unfortunate thing about all this is that California law demands that action 
be taken . . . and it is not being taken. Under CEQA (California Environmental 
Quality Act), the ongoing destruction of this most unique and magnificent 
ecosystem must be mitigated. 
</P>
<P>
But who should pick up the mitigation tab? Does IID pay the bill to save Salton 
Sea because it is conserving the water which is killing it? Does MWD pay the 
bill, because it intends to sell the water to users in and around Los Angeles? 
Or do the people pay the bill, because they are the ultimate users of that 
water? 
</P>
<P>
Apparently these questions are going unanswered. But even worse . . . nobody 
seems to be looking for the answer.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With reference to your editorial "Major Mistake in Argentina" (Oct. 14), 
readers should bear in mind that the situation of some members of the Argentine 
armed forces is a consequence of the turmoil in which the society has lived in 
the last decades. The institutional end to that turmoil came in 1983 when a 
democratic government was definitely re-established. The political stability 
has been confirmed by the free presidential elections of 1989, the first 
constitutional change of authorities in 62 years. 
</P>
<P>
President Carlos Saul Menem, in strict application of his constitutional 
capacities and following a widespread practice in our history, has issued a 
pardon to condemned and indicted officers and civilians. This act can in no way 
be considered a limitation to the competence of Argentine federal courts or, as 
it was suggested in your editorial, an invitation to "the military to assert 
its influence again." On the contrary, it is a reinforcement of the 
constitutional powers, as confirmed by the Supreme Court.

SIMPLY PUT, TERRITORIAL RATING IS REDLINING; 
</P>
<P>
AUTO INSURANCE: OUT OF GREED, THE INDUSTRY WOULD RATHER HANG ON TO A RACIST 
POLICY THAN COMPLY WITH PROP. 103. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK RIDLEY-THOMAS and MARY LEE, Mark Ridley-Thomas is executive director of 
the Southern Christian Leadership of Greater Los Angeles. Mary Lee is directing 
attorney for the South Central Legal Aid organization. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The current debate on insurance ratings is marked by indecision, but one thing 
does seem regrettably certain: territorial rating. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the term territorial rating has been employed by the insurance 
industry to describe the practice of basing the price of insurance on the 
address of the insured. The industry prefers to use the euphemism of 
territorial rating for this practice to guard against charges of racial 
injustice. Simply put, territorial rating is redlining. 
</P>
<P>
It is a practice in which a red line is drawn around certain areas (often using 
zip codes) that results in automatically higher rates for residents. People of 
color, who typically have lower incomes, usually predominate in redlined 
communities. Insurers have reason to be defensive: Redlining, no matter what 
it's called, is racist. 
</P>
<P>
State Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie recently barred the use of 
territorial rating in setting the cost of auto insurance. At long last, we 
thought, she was implementing a critical provision of Proposition 103. This 
fleeting fantasy of fairness was later snatched from expectant consumers when 
the commissioner began to reconsider her uncharacteristic pro-consumer stance 
in the name of fairness -- "a fair rate of return" for insurers. 
</P>
<P>
What about fairness for folks who paid $1,050 in Compton (predominantly African 
American and Latino) for a 1981 Buick with basic liability coverage? Compare 
that to the residents of Torrance (four miles away and predominantly Anglo) 
who, with the same car and driving record, paid $550 (according to 1986 data 
supplied by the California Insurance Commission). 
</P>
<P>
Further, the impact of price disparities has been multiplied by the state's 
mandatory auto insurance law. For residents of redlined communities, the choice 
is grim: Pay excessive, discriminatory rates or break the law. Given the rates 
charged in those areas, it can come down to a choice between auto insurance and 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
Insurers insist that territorial rating is necessary to the rate-setting 
process as an accurate predictor of "risk of loss." Wrong. According to the 
Stanford Research Institute study of insurance rating factors, (a survey 
commissioned and paid for by the insurance industry) there is only a 7% 
correlation between where people live and their risk of loss. This refuted the 
insurers' theory that in certain areas, accidents are inherently more likely to 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
Having posted faulty assumptions, their logic goes on to place the burden of 
the loss not on those who drive in those "risky" areas, but on those who live 
in them. Until recently, this argument was blindly accepted, even by the 
commissioner, illustrating once again the manipulation of language and logic by 
this all-too-powerful industry. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than set rates on individual driving records, the burden is imposed on 
entire communities. Neatly, but powerfully, packed into this policy is the 
stereotypical notion that people of color are generally less responsible and 
often more dangerous. So, then, the communities they occupy must be dangerous 
areas or at least unsafe for driving as well as other things. In the mind of 
insurers, risky driving conditions warrant the red line, as they seek to 
justify "the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
Even more enraging is the fact that redlining has resulted in consumers in the 
affected areas subsidizing those whose communities are not redlined. Insurers 
insist that if they are "forced" to set rates equitably, rates will go up 
everywhere. But the only reason rates would go up is because insurers would 
raise them and the commissioner would approve them. 
</P>
<P>
Although the California Supreme Court has guaranteed insurance companies the 
right to a "fair return," they have not been guaranteed the right to limitless 
profits. These brazen insurers, however, care little about the effect on those 
who are least able to pay. Some have opposed any restrictions on territorial 
rating. Clearly, the insurance industry is hell bent on maximizing profits. 
</P>
<P>
The law, as established by the people's Proposition 103 victory, is clear. 
Rates should be based on three factors: the insured's driving record; the 
number of miles driven annually, and the number of years of driving experience. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Proposition 103 has a giant loophole, one in which the 
commissioner, guided by the industry, appears to be preparing to recklessly 
drive a Mack truck through. That loophole declares that the commissioner may 
approve the use of other rating factors if they have a substantial relationship 
to risk of loss. At first glance, that language seems to provide consumer 
protection, since it requires proof of a substantial relationship to risk of 
loss and must be approved by the commissioner. But it now looks as though the 
commissioner and certain consumer groups may compromise with the bullying 
insurance industry. Those who can least afford exorbitant rates would be 
required to suffer redlining in exchange for a short-term blanket freeze on 
premium increases. 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who believe in civil and economic rights are used to tough 
struggles. On redlining, we are unrelenting: We will continue to insist that 
the rights of all insurance consumers be represented by appointed and elected 
officials. And we will continue to challenge unjust and unfair policies and 
practices wherever they are used, no matter what they are called.

ERMA BOMBECK: THE PLEASURES OF BEING A FRUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Usually I am quite modest about all the awards (two) I have received 
professionally. Recently, however, I was given an honor that is long overdue. I 
was made an honorary celebrity FRUMP (Frugal, Responsible, Unpretentious, 
Mature People). Keeping me illustrious company are First Lady Barbara Bush, 
Willard Scott, Roseanne Barr and Andy Rooney. 
</P>
<P>
The founding mother of FRUMP is "Auntie" Barbara Hovanetz of Winter Park, Fla., 
who also edits the monthly newsletter. ("It's fall . . . the start of the 
annual Purge Your Expired Coupons Season!") 
</P>
<P>
There are 2,000 card-carrying FRUMPS out there -- women who wear polyester in 
midsummer, crochet poodles to cover bottles of booze and, in order to prevent 
the smoke alarm from going off while they're cooking, cover it with a shower 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
I suspect there are a lot more women who aren't organized enough to know 
there's an organization organized just for them. 
</P>
<P>
Some of us are destined for lackluster. We go through life carrying the same 
handbag in winter and summer. We buy a skirt for 50 cents at a garage sale and 
ask if they do alterations. If we have a season where our slips aren't too long 
for our dresses, then our coats are too short. 
</P>
<P>
You can dress us up, put us at a head table and make us feel important, but let 
us sneeze and we quickly unfold from our handbag a half-roll of toilet tissue. 
</P>
<P>
In a country that has a support group for everything, including dogs who have 
had hysterectomies, it is comforting to know there are other women out there 
who make dresses from curtain panels and hold bras together with safety pins 
and fallen hems with staples. Every day I see a world becoming more serious 
about itself. 
</P>
<P>
Women are driven to "have it all," from bathrooms that sparkle to kids who 
carry color-coordinated food in their Batman lunch boxes. It's not an invention 
of the baby boomers. We've always been that way. At birth, every baby girl is 
given a Stepford booster shot. Somewhere between laundering plastic bags and 
hanging them out to dry and ripping off stamps on envelopes that I never 
returned, I learned to lighten up. I don't know when the First Lady decided to 
bare her roots or Willard decided to bare his skull, but it has probably made 
life a lot easier for them. Or as one FRUMP put it, "Don't take life so 
seriously. You'll never get out alive!" 
</P>
<P>
I don't owe anyone for this award -- not my family, my editors or members of 
the academy. I did it all myself. I thank you for the honor and the white FRUMP 
T-shirt. Well, it used to be white. It is now pink, but then you probably 
anticipated that.

THE UNFORGIVABLE SIN OF PLAGIARISM

Stolen Words: Forays into the Origins and Ravages of Plagiarism by Thomas 
Mallon (Ticknor &amp; Fields: $18.95; 283 pages.) 
</P>
<P>
Back when there were half a dozen Democrats vying for the 1988 presidential 
nomination, Sen. Joseph F. Biden was the first to come unstuck. The unsticking 
was accomplished by the revelation that a particularly fine campaign speech of 
his had plagiarized an even finer speech by the leader of Britain's Labor 
Party, Neil Kinnock. 
</P>
<P>
Biden, who is head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, seems to have suffered no 
long-term ill effects. He was even able to present Kinnock, some time later, 
with a copy of his own speeches and an invitation to the Labor leader to feel 
free to borrow anything he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
But then, Thomas Mallon reflects in "Stolen Words"? "Politics is not so serious 
and dirty a business as literature." 
</P>
<P>
Mallon is a writer who possesses grace and wit, a delight in incongruity, and a 
quickness to love hard, and grow furious. The grace, the wit, the 
incongruity-spotter and the love were all evident in "A Book of One's Own," his 
marvelously beguiling account of literary diaries. 
</P>
<P>
All these qualities are present in Mallon's book on literary plagiarism, except 
that the love is pretty much replaced by the fury. He thought of calling it 
"Not A Book of One's Own," but changed his mind, which seems a pity. Instead, 
he calls it "Stolen Words," as if to signal that he was feeling angry and not 
playful. 
</P>
<P>
Mallon, I expect, will never not be playful; but his rage is useful. Plagiarism 
is the vacuum that nature abhors; it is a quiet, chilly, excavating vice, like 
picking one's nose when nobody is looking. It takes Mallon's fieriness, even if 
it sometimes seems excessive, to get us to pay attention. 
</P>
<P>
One of the characteristics of plagiarism, in fact, is that there is a certain 
tendency to excuse it. Writers began to complain seriously about it, or defend 
themselves against it, around the time of Shakespeare -- nobody minded Virgil 
borrowing from Homer -- but almost immediately, Mallon finds the denouncers 
denounced as petty-minded. 
</P>
<P>
In two of the three cases he studies in detail -- he uses each of these 
chapters to weave in other examples along with general reflections -- he 
discovers a reluctance to confront a fact, and a tendency to minimize it. Like 
rape, he writes, it is a crime with the odd ability to make others feel guilty. 
</P>
<P>
There is a detailed and absorbing study of a professor at Texas Tech who 
repeatedly used others' material, and who was allowed quietly to resign, even 
though some of his colleagues wanted some more energetic action. The man 
involved -- Mallon names him as Jayme Sokolov -- eventually published his 
disputed version in a somewhat revised version and, when complaints of 
plagiarism persisted, wrote notes of apology in the American Historical Assn. 
Journal and inserted errata slips in the remaining volumes. Mallon's point is 
the lack of public denunciation by the professor's peers. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was "Wild Oats," by Jacob Epstein, a comic novel about the 
enthusiasms and predicaments of an American college student, which appeared in 
1980. It was praised by several prominent writers. Perhaps too snidely, Mallon 
gives the impression that some of the praise was due to the fact that Jacob's 
parents were influential editors; he does not deny the author's talent. 
</P>
<P>
A considerable scandal resulted when the English novelist, Martin Amis, wrote 
an article citing half a dozen highly distinctive passages that were almost 
identical to passages in his own well-praised "The Rachel Papers," published in 
1974. Mallon quotes them. There were 53 such passages in all, Amis complained. 
</P>
<P>
The British author seems to have made his disclosure reluctantly, and Mallon 
writes that he still rather regrets it. Amis' own publisher, Corlies Smith -- 
who, one might have thought, would have been outraged -- suggested that the 
affair had been overplayed. 
</P>
<P>
Mallon supplies anger for both of them. It is beside the point, he writes, that 
the two books were different in spirit and tone, and that much of Jacob's book 
was original. That is like saying that although 50 stolen items are found in a 
burglar's house, 2,000 items were not stolen. And, he adds in wicked deadpan: 
"The books don't feel, overall, very much alike. It's just that they are, 
sometimes, exactly the same." 
</P>
<P>
Once or twice, I find Mallon persnickety in citing transgressions. And there is 
the borderline case of "Tristram Shandy," whose author, Laurence Sterne, got a 
good many of Uncle Toby's sayings from Richard Burton's "Anatomy of 
Melancholy." 
</P>
<P>
Mallon grants that "Tristram" is an extraordinary original, but he takes issue 
with scholarly indulgence, and the argument that readers would recognize the 
Burton adages. Sterne, he said, got a free ride. He has a point; but what is 
the alternative? Could Uncle Toby really be expected to put footnotes in his 
mouth? 
</P>
<P>
By and large, though, his distinctions are fair. Not citing the authorship of a 
well-known phrase is legitimate. "After all, one could put an end to literary 
allusion if one feared the footnote police behind every punctuation mark." 
Self-plagiarizing is generally OK. "No writer wants his work to have just one 
temporary or inconspicuous life." 
</P>
<P>
And stylistic influence, or "osmosis" is more than OK. Joan Didion, he is sure, 
was influenced early on by Hemingway's sentences. He knows that he himself was 
influenced by Didion. "No one will ever amount to anything unless his early 
reading leaks into his first writing." 
</P>
<P>
Plagiarism is not, mainly or necessarily, using plots or situations that others 
have used. It is, necessarily and always, using their words, unattributed. 
Word-stealing is the fuel to Mallon's fire; it is unforgivable. 
</P>
<P>
Writers write above all more for identity than for money, he tells us. You can 
bear your wallet being stolen so long as you keep the photographs. Losing one's 
words means losing one's self-respect. "If ego stopped mattering, then, very 
likely, writers would stop writing or at least, stop writing so frequently and 
so well."

 The San Francisco earthquake was disturbing -- and not just for Californians. 
We have seen several patients in our practice in the last few days because of 
anxiety precipitated by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, many of my patients have become significantly more anxious and 
depressed since the disaster, which killed so many and devastated the lives of 
thousands. I was initially amazed as to how important discussion of the 
California quake was to my patients. What was even more puzzling was that their 
focus on this event continued rather than diminished as the days went by. 
</P>
<P>
I polled several practitioners and they reported similar reactions with their 
patients. Interested to see if this was limited to people who were already in 
therapy, I asked several of my friends and family to informally monitor and 
report back to me what they observed with their friends and associates. 
Although far from qualifying as a scientific survey, their reports were 
unanimous: about 25% of the people they observed seemed to have a higher level 
of anxiety and depression associated with the California earthquake. What is 
the basis for their anxiety -- particularly in Baltimore, Md., 3,000 miles from 
the disaster? 
</P>
<P>
Perceived control over our lives is the most important factor which predicts 
our emotional and physical health as well as our longevity. Most of us spend 
the majority of our energy to secure what we want and need and to increase the 
predictability of life. When we feel that our control over day-to-day existence 
is reduced, our anxiety and fear grow proportionately. 
</P>
<P>
But worldwide disasters are commonplace. All we have to do any day of the week 
is turn on the TV and there we have it -- instant disaster. So why should the 
California temblor shake us to our foundation and create so many emotional 
aftershocks, including increased anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia and 
depression, and physical problems, such as headaches, gastrointestinal distress 
and fatigue? There appear to be several conditions that came together to reduce 
our sense of perceived control over our lives to extremely low levels and, in 
turn, resulted in severe and continued reactions to the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
First, within the month preceding the quake we had Hurricane Hugo. Each night, 
we tracked the hurricane on the evening news. At the onset we saw it east of 
Puerto Rico, and then each day we carefully plotted its course. We knew exactly 
where it was, what islands were in its path, how large it was, and how strong 
were its winds. Yet in spite of all that information, we watched on television 
while it destroyed the life's work of tens of thousands of people in South 
Carolina. We had complete information and yet were helpless -- totally lacking 
control over preventing its disastrous consequences. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, because of instantaneous reporting on television, our capacity to 
closely identify with the people who were devastated was heightened to levels 
beyond that which we normally experience. This unique combination of "seeing it 
coming" and being unable to "stop it" increased our sense of helplessness and 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
With the devastation of Hugo still fresh in memory, along comes the earthquake. 
Not in Tibet or Peru, but on home territory, in San Francisco, a city most 
Americans associate with the height of civilization and sophistication. 
</P>
<P>
So the one-two punch of Hugo and the quake has caused the nation's anxiety to 
soar. 
</P>
<P>
But why doesn't everyone experience problems? And what can we do about it if we 
are suffering such upset? 
</P>
<P>
We all have, whether we realize it or not, what I call a "sense-of-control 
quotient." Some of us feel more in control of our lives than do others. For 
example, at one end of the continuum of perceived control is the person who, 
after falling out of an airplane without a parachute, is relatively confident 
that he will be able to hit the ground in such a fashion as to minimize his 
injuries. At the other end is the individual who, while seemingly secure in his 
cozy living room, is anxiety-ridden over the possibility of an out-of-control 
airplane crashing into his house. Fortunately, most of us reside somewhere in 
between these two extremes. 
</P>
<P>
However, where we reside appears to be the result of two factors. The first is 
subtle and often hard-to-identify learned behaviors in our childhood that, at 
critical times in our development, teach us how much control we "perceive" 
having over our lives. I must emphasize that what we grow to expect in terms of 
control over our life and how much control we actually have are not necessarily 
related. Some of us grow up expecting to rule the world and others grow up with 
a desire to dig a hole and hide, no matter what our life's experiences. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to our childhood experiences are those in our adult life. If we 
have been plagued by events such as losing our job unexpectedly, our spouse 
running away with the next-door neighbor, the unexpected and untimely death of 
a loved one, a chronic illness -- these combine with our learned expectations 
from childhood to produce a particular "sense of control quotient." The lower 
our quotient, the more susceptible we are to developing emotional and physical 
problems from events like Hugo and the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
So what can we do to enhance our quotient and to reduce our distress? 
</P>
<P>
First, we can use our intelligence like a tool to reshape our emotional 
reactions. Understanding the meaning and implications of the serenity "prayer" 
can be a major first step in this regard. "God give me the strength to change 
the things I can, the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, and the 
wisdom to know the difference." 
</P>
<P>
We spend so much of our emotional energy focusing upon that which we cannot 
change that we have none left to expend on those circumstances that we could 
alter. As a result of not taking charge over that which we can control -- we 
feel even more out of control and our "quotient" drops even lower. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of us have experienced tragic events in our lives that have been 
totally outside of our control, in fact these account for a very small 
percentage of events and situations in our lives. In spite of this fact, so 
many people spend so much of their time worrying about things they can't change 
and do little to shape the outcome of their own lives.

The Dublin birthplace of Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw has been sold for 
$166,000 to a trust that will turn it into a museum. The Dublin-based Shaw 
Birthplace Museum Trust will restore the eight-room house near the center of 
Dublin to the way it was when Shaw was born there in 1856. Shaw and his family 
lived in the house at 33 Synge St. for 10 years. It went up for auction in 
Dublin last month but failed to reach its reserve price. "We have been after 
the house for some time and look forward to it becoming the basis of an 
appropriate permanent commemoration," Trust chairwoman Nora Lever said. ALEENE

A Bird In Hand: Five parrots named Sam, Barney, Miggsie, Loreto and Sharkey 
flocked to London's Mermaid Theatre Wednesday to audition for a Christmas 
production of "Treasure Island." Despite owners' claims that the parrots could 
talk, most of the birds perched on the leading actor's shoulder, could manage 
only a series of outraged squawks or deposit droppings on his pirate costume. 
"It might be safer with a stuffed parrot," said British television star Frank 
Windsor who will play the one-legged pirate Long John Silver. "But it would be 
a very boring show." ALEENE MacMINN

Hundreds of artists and their supporters staged a National Arts Advocacy Day in 
London Wednesday and warned that theaters, museums and other institutions are 
being "squeezed to death" by government cutbacks. The demonstrators rallied at 
the South Bank Arts Center, home of the Royal Festival Hall and the National 
Theater, before heading to the House of Commons to urge lawmakers to be more 
generous with funding for the arts. John Bowis, a legislator for the governing 
Conservative Party, said they would have to exert "huge pressure" because the 
arts were of little interest to most members of Parliament, or MPs. "The last 
time I initiated a debate on the arts there were about 40 MPs present out of 
650" in the House of Commons, he said. Speakers accused the government of 
underestimating the value of the arts to British life and as a revenue earner. 
Since Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives won power in 1979, 
government financial support for the arts has fallen by 19%, said Simon Crine, 
director of the National Campaign for the Arts, which organized the events. 
Total government spending this year on arts and libraries, including the 19 
national museums, is officially estimated at $1.3 billion, of which $707 
million is for the arts alone. ALEENE MacMINN

EARTHQUAKE RATTLES BOTTLES AND NERVES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WINE COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
The earthquake that struck Northern California on Oct. 17 could have been a 
tragedy for California wineries, especially to those in the Santa Cruz 
Mountains just west of the epicenter in Hollister, but no injuries were 
reported and there was only a minimal amount of wine lost. 
</P>
<P>
However, the quake left many wineries in a shambles, with a long clean-up 
process ahead. Coming, as it did, after a difficult harvest, complete with 
damaging rains, the quake created more sleepless nights and untold hours of 
work for crews that had looked forward to a rest. 
</P>
<P>
But there were bright spots: "Thank God for the World Series or we might have 
been killed," said Val Ahlgren, co-owner with her husband, Dex, of the small 
Ahlgren Winery in Boulder Creek in the Santa Cruz Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been working in the cellar, but we quit early to watch the Series 
game," said Val. The quake struck at 5:04 p.m., just as the pregame show for 
World Series Game Three was starting. When the quake hit, it tossed barrels 
about in the cellar and anyone standing in the small work area would have been 
crushed, she said. Instead, Val and Dex were in their home, above the winery, 
and were uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Roudon at Roudon-Smith Winery in Santa Cruz said he and his crew had just 
quit work at 5 p.m. "We were in the parking lot when it hit," he said. Barrels 
tumbled off barrel stacks, scattering here and there and spraying wine all 
around the winery. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of barrels were smashed, and we lost some of the bungs," he said, adding 
that most of the loss was in expensive Chardonnay. The winery, which he and 
partner Jim Smith designed, suffered no structural damage, however. "We 
designed it to flex quite well," Roudon said. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been able to assess what we've lost yet, but it looks like it'll be 
about 30% of the (1989) crush," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our big mistake is how we stacked the barrels, barrel on barrel, and when the 
quake hit, they just squirted off the stacks. We're just grateful no one was 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Barrel Racks Split 
</P>
<P>
At Santa Cruz Mountain Vineyard, barrels were on racks, but half of the barrel 
racks split apart, "and barrels just tumbled everywhere," said Jeff Emery, wine 
maker. "But I have yet to see a broken barrel, and most of the bungs stayed 
in." 
</P>
<P>
The wine library, including bottles of every wine the winery had made as well 
as old and rare French wines, was hard hit. Emery estimated that owner Ken 
Burnap lost about a third of his collection, including a bottle of 1945 La 
Mission Haut-Brion and a range of older Bordeaux and Burgundies. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the pile of barrels that remains "is very unstable so it's dangerous 
to move them." Immediately after the quake, he began pumping wine into the 
seven empty barrels he had. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Longer Maceration 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a tank of Cabernet Sauvignon "should be pressed off today, but it'll 
have to wait." The wine has macerated on the skins for seven days. "What the 
hell, in the old days we used to leave the wine on the skins 21 days, so I 
guess we'll make this one like those. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going on vacation in two weeks, but that ain't happening now," Emery 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A number of wineries that ferment their wines at cold temperatures and need 
refrigeration to maintain low temperatures said the loss of power for two days 
may have hurt the quality of the wine. But most said they couldn't say yet what 
the effect will be. 
</P>
<P>
Some wineries were luckier than others. At Bonny Doon Vineyard , no wine was 
lost, either from barrel or tank, and no bottles were broken, said Patrice 
Boyle, assistant to owner Randall Grahm, who was cleaning up the cellar when 
the winery was called. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of barrels fell onto the rack below, but nothing broke," said Boyle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Losses Reported 
</P>
<P>
Losses were reported at David Bruce Winery, Bargetto and Devlin in the Santa 
Cruz Mountains, as well as J. Lohr Winery in San Jose. Hallcrest and Ridge 
reported no serious losses. 
</P>
<P>
A number of cases of wine stored at California Wine Transport in San Jose were 
lost when stacks of boxes of wine fell over. But even there the losses were 
minimal. Marcia Ljubojevic, vice president of finance at Ridge, said about 
3,000 cases tipped over, but that only eight cases of wine were lost. 
</P>
<P>
Val Ahlgren said her wine cellar was "so full (of barrels) that they all came 
together like popcorn in a bowl. The wine library is a mess, but when the 
barrels came down, none of them broke, and we don't see a bung out." The cellar 
is "very precarious, so we'll wait until after the worst aftershocks before we 
move in there and try to organize stuff we can move. It's like giant pickup 
sticks." 
</P>
<P>
Things were so tossed about in their house that they initially cleared a path 
to the bathroom, to the sink and the telephone, and then slept outside on a 
porch. 
</P>
<P>
"And we look up at the stars and the moon and they're all still in the right 
place," she said.

PUMPKINS &amp; OTHER SQUASHES; 
</P>
<P>
FROM JACK-BE-LITTLES TO AUSTRALIAN BLUES, SQUASHES PROVIDE AUTUMN MENUS WITH 
NUTRIENTS AND COLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Among the first vegetables cultivated by American Indians were those called 
askutasquash or isquoutersquash. Thanks to the pilgrims, however, the word for 
this vegetable family now is simply squash. 
</P>
<P>
 The native American gourd, which originally meant "eaten raw," has become a 
mainstay on our tables as both an edible menu item and as a table decoration. 
</P>
<P>
This is the proper time of the year to rediscover the hard-shelled, 
summer-grown crops of the Cucurbita maxima family. In familiar language, 
they're known as winter squash, so-called because they store well for winter 
eating. So forget the canned substitutes, get the cleaver and mallet out and 
enjoy your share of these ever-appealing vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Blending with the brilliant colors of fall, the squash family includes 
pumpkins, in various shades of tangerine and now white and blue as well. 
Pumpkins range in size from a 641-pound mammoth (this year's record holder) to 
minuscule 3-inch Jack-Be-Littles. Common winter squash varieties include Acorn, 
Butternut, Hubbard and Buttercup, which come in many shapes, colors and 
stripings, displaying rugged to smooth exteriors. 
</P>
<P>
For the tough-skinned pumpkin, however, this year's harvest wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
"Pumpkins have been hurt due to the rains," said Dimetri Gardikas, a produce 
distributor in Downey. "The rains damaged some portion of the larger sizes. A 
good portion of the mini-pumpkins were wiped out while the white pumpkins 
suffered extensive damage. Adding to the problem, we got more mud in the 
pumpkins." 
</P>
<P>
On the brighter side, consumers still will find a heap of jack-o'-lantern 
pumpkins for carving and pie-making because supplies have arrived from out of 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"The 20 to 30% (local) loss was also offset by a heavier crop this year," 
Gardikas added. Good news is that pricing is about the same as last year, with 
a slight half-cent-per-pound increase. 
</P>
<P>
Although the familiar pumpkin remains the unanimous choice for Halloween and 
fall decorating, its eating quality is not that of its sister winter squashes. 
"Some (winter squashes) are so sweet that you don't need anything on them," 
said food consultant and stylist Marlene Brown, who devoted an informative 
chapter in her new book, "International Produce Cookbook and Guide" (H P Books: 
$12.95) to squash. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer acceptance of squash improves each year, she said. "New varieties are 
being introduced, and people are becoming more aware that squashes are packed 
with nutrients, are high in fiber and are superb sources of Vitamin A -- 
especially the orange-meat squashes." Brown suggests choosing a squash that's 
hard and solid and heavy for its size. 
</P>
<P>
New, improved hybrids also have inspired the comeback of older favorites. 
Gardikas said he feels secure handling the popular sellers, such as Butternut, 
Acorn, Spaghetti squash and sometimes Banana squash. On the other hand, 
suppliers such as Melissa's Brand (formerly World Variety Produce) and Frieda's 
Finest expressed growing positive responses with specialty squashes. 
</P>
<P>
One of the newer entries into the winter squash field is the Australian Blue, 
which Brown said is her current favorite because it's very rich and meaty, with 
brilliant orange flesh. According to Trudy Hernandez, marketing manager for 
Melissa's, the bluish-gray shelled squashes, which were once available only in 
Australia and known as Queensland Blue Pumpkins, are now grown just north of 
Bakersfield, Calif. Because of their washed-out blue shade, some people are 
already planning to use them as Southwest-style jack-o'-lanterns or as 
centerpieces before cooking them. 
</P>
<P>
"These blue squashes were considered a staple in Australia. Because 
refrigeration of the squash was not necessary even after opening, the blue 
pumpkins were served at almost every pub Down Under," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
Highly successful members of Melissa's and Frieda's squash lines are two 
small-size varieties that make excellent one-serving vegetables: the Gold 
Nugget, a small, round, orange squash of the buttercup type; and Sweet 
Dumpling, a squat-shaped squash with a cream-colored shell and indented dark 
green striping. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason why winter squashes are gaining in popularity is that they are 
all microwaveable, said food consultant Cathi Hofstetter. "They keep their 
flavor and texture in the microwave," she explained. "It's so convenient and 
fast this way; it frees up the oven during the holidays and doesn't scare 
people into thinking that they have to spend so much time preparing squash the 
stove-top way." 
</P>
<P>
Hofstetter also prefers baby squashes because they cook faster and are tasty 
plain or stuffed. Of the special varieties, she prefers White Acorn for baking 
and the long, slender Delicata for its corn-and-sweet-potato flavor. 
</P>
<P>
To vary presentations and to make soup, rice or vegetable casseroles more 
appealing, a trend (borrowed from the early American Indians) is to use medium- 
to small-size precooked squashes as serving vessels. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing from international cuisines, we've developed some interesting 
suggestions on how to use winter squash and pumpkin. For an all-American 
pumpkin pie, try Julia Child's Fluffy Pumpkin Pie from her latest cookbook, 
"Julia Child's The Way to Cook" (Alfred Knopf: $50). The filling is light and 
moist, the butter crust so flaky and rich, it melts in your mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Pumpkin seeds have a unique application in the savory, pastel green sauce for 
orange Pumpkin Ravioli, a recipe from the new "Betty Crocker's Southwest 
Cookbook." There's also a brightly colored Squash Soup With Cranberry Dollop 
from Marlene Brown's produce cookbook. 
</P>
<P>
Use your imagination. Substitute squash purees, chunks or slices for potato or 
sweet potato in recipes. Tempura or creme brulee? You'll be surprised that 
squash works in both applications. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it's hard to beat the delicate perfection of plain cooked squash, 
swathed in butter and accented with a sprinkling of fragrant herbs and spices.

1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons light molasses 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons Bourbon whiskey or dark Jamaican rum 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon ground ginger 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 
</P>
<P>
4 egg yolks, stirred 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
3/4 cup milk, or more if needed 
</P>
<P>
5 egg whites 
</P>
<P>
Butter Pastry Shells 
</P>
<P>
Whipped cream, vanilla ice cream or pulverized praline or nut brittle, optional 
</P>
<P>
In large mixing bowl, blend pumpkin, brown sugar, granulated sugar, salt, 
molasses, whiskey, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, egg yolks, whipping cream 
and milk. Mixture should hold its shape softly in spoon. (Beat in droplets more 
milk if it seems too stiff.) 
</P>
<P>
Beat egg whites to stiff peaks. Beat a quarter of whites into pumpkin mixture. 
Gently fold in remaining. Ladle mixture into prepared pastry shells, filling 
only to rim of pan. 
</P>
<P>
Place in middle level of oven and bake at 450 degrees 15 minutes. Reduce heat 
to 375 degrees and bake 15 minutes more (lower heat if pastry begins to brown 
too much). Reduce heat to 350 degrees and continue baking another 15 minutes, 
or until skewer comes out clean when inserted 2 inches from edges of pie. Turn 
oven off and leave door ajar 20 to 30 minutes longer. 
</P>
<P>
Serve warm or cold. If desired serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, 
dusting with pulverized praline. Makes 2 (9-inch) pies, 16 to 20 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Butter Pastry Shell 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, preferably unbleached

blade. Pulse 5 to 6 times to roughly break up butter. Add shortening, turn on 
machine and immediately pour in 1/2 cup ice water, then pulse 2 to 3 times. 
Remove cover and feel dough. It should look like a bunch of small lumps and 
will just hold together in a mass when pressed together. If too dry, pulse in 
droplets more water. 
</P>
<P>
Turn dough out onto work surface and press into rough mass. Rapidly and 
roughly, with the heel of hand, push egg-size clumps of dough in front of you 
in 6-inch smear. 
</P>
<P>
Gather and form dough into two cakes. Wrap in plastic and chill at least 2 
hours. Roll out each dough and fit into two (9-inch) pie pans, making strong 
fluted rim that extends about 1/2 inch above top of pan. Makes 2 (9-inch) 
pastry shells.

AMERICANS REMAIN NUTTY OVER FAVORITE PISTACHIOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Christian Science Monitor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Americans have always been fascinated with nuts. Almonds, pecans and walnuts, 
macadamia nuts, pine nuts, pistachios, hazelnuts, filberts and peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
One by one they seem to reach a peak in popularity, then become a staple item 
while a different one takes the spotlight. Many once relegated to cakes, 
candies and tortes are now showing up in new sauces for poultry, game and fish. 
</P>
<P>
Pine nuts and pistachios are two of the latest to be seen in many new recipes. 
Neither is new. But the pistachio nut is probably tops as the current favorite, 
especially the large variety in the natural color shells that are grown in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Once the product of Assyria and Iran, they're now grown in the United States. 
Pistachios are green or ivory, but some Near Eastern varieties are dyed red in 
processing to hide blemishes from crude hulling methods. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. importers use a nontoxic, red vegetable dye approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Some imported pistachios are also coated with a thin layer of cornstarch and 
salt to improve appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Because California nuts are mechanically hulled and dried within 24 hours of 
harvesting, they don't need the red coloring. 
</P>
<P>
The pistachio has a characteristically sweet, oily taste that is excellent as a 
flavoring for sweets, sauces, cakes and ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
Although pistachio oil is used as a flavoring ingredient, the majority of nuts 
in the United States are sold in the shell and eaten out of hand as a snack. 
</P>
<P>
California growers claim their pistachios taste the same as the imported nuts 
but are larger, fresher and easier to open, although the question of best 
flavor is always debatable among purists and people from Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Under favorable conditions, pistachio trees live and produce for centuries, 
producing a heavy crop one year followed by a smaller one the next. In the 
Kerman region of Iran, a 700-year-old tree is still standing. The most 
important California cultivar is called "Kerman." 
</P>
<P>
The Queen of Sheba was especially fond of pistachio nuts and is said to have 
monopolized the limited pistachio output of Assyria. In Syria, pistachio nuts 
are an important ingredient at wedding feasts, and following a social call 
departing guests often receive a small bag of pistachios as a gesture of 
goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
Iran was the top supplier of pistachios to the U.S. market in 1979, with 12 
million pounds. After the seizure of the American hostages and the subsequent 
cutoff of all Iranian imports, Iranian pistachio imports in 1980 fell to less 
than 1 million pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Pistachios vary in size. The Iranian variety has from 18 to 40 nuts per ounce. 
California nuts are larger, sometimes as few as 14 per ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Today, about 30 million pounds of in-shell pistachio nuts are consumed annually 
in the United States. It is expected to grow to at least 50 million pounds a 
year in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Pistachios are fine in sauces, pates and stuffings, and Germans and Italians 
use the oil in curing pork sausage. 
</P>
<P>
When shopping for nuts, look for freshness. Store both shelled and unshelled 
nuts in the refrigerator. For longer storage, seal carefully and freeze. The 
nuts will keep well in the freezer for a year or longer and can be used 
directly from the package.

Question: I live in a home at 6,000 feet elevation and am having trouble baking 
a cake. I like making my cake from scratch, but when I bake it, it always rises 
nicely and then sinks in the middle. What do you suggest I do? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The following information about high-altitude cake baking comes from 
"Joy of Cooking" (Bobbs-Merrill, 1986) by Irma S. Rombauer and Marion Rombauer 
Becker: 
</P>
<P>
"Cake batters at high altitudes are subject to pixie-like variations that often 
defy general rules. Read the comments and then launch forth on your own, 
keeping records at first until you know what gives you the greatest success. On 
the whole, cupcakes and layer cakes are better textured than loaf cakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Up to 3000 feet, if you reduce the air in the cakes by not overbeating eggs, 
you will probably need no adjustment of the cake formula. Also raise the baking 
temperature about 25 degrees. In elevations higher than 3000 feet, continue to 
underbeat the eggs as compared to sea level consistency. Another way to reduce 
their volume is to keep the eggs refrigerated until almost ready to use. 
</P>
<P>
"At around 5000 feet, it will also help to reduce the double-acting baking 
powder or baking soda by 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon for each teaspoon called for in 
the recipe. Decrease sugar one to two tablespoons for each cup called for and 
increase liquid two to three tablespoons for each cup indicated. Raise the 
baking temperature about 25 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"At 7000 feet, decrease double-acting baking powder and baking soda by 1/4 
teaspoon for every teaspoon called for. Decrease sugar by two to three 
tablespoons for each cup indicated and increase liquid by three to four 
tablespoons for each cup in the recipe. Increase the flour one tablespoon for 
each cup called for. Raise the baking temperature about 25 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"At 10,000 feet, decrease the double-acting baking powder or baking soda by 
one-quarter to one-half teaspoon for every teaspoon called for in the recipe, 
and add an extra egg, but do not overbeat the eggs. Decrease the sugar two to 
three tablespoons for each cup in the recipe. Increase the liquid by three to 
four tablespoons for each cup liquid indicated. Increase the flour by one to 
two tablespoons for each cup called for. Increase the baking temperature about 
25 degrees." 
</P>
<P>
The book goes on to say "whatever formula you use, grease your baking pans well 
and dust them with flour or line them with parchment paper. For, at high 
altitudes, cakes have a tendency to stick to the pan. Fill cake pans only half 
full of batter, as high-altitude cakes may overflow." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps this will help you, as well as others who live or vacation at high 
altitudes. You might also check bookstores in those areas for cookbooks that 
address the subject.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"This recipe has been in my family for some 60 years," Carole Foran writes. 
"It's a cross between a cake and a light bread and needs no icing, other than a 
sprinkling of powdered sugar, which is optional. The cake freezes very well." 
</P>
<P>
BANANA-NUT CAKE 
</P>
<P>
1 3/4 cups sifted cake flour 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon baking soda 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
1/4 pound butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
3 eggs, well beaten 
</P>
<P>
3 very soft bananas, mashed 
</P>
<P>
1 cup chopped walnuts 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
Sift together cake flour, baking soda and baking powder. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Cream butter with sugar until smooth. Add well-beaten eggs, beating until

THE BUTCHER: SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS FOR HIS BIG, JUICY PORTERHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Texas reader writes: "Several years ago my wife and I were visiting San 
Francisco. We had dinner at a restaurant where there was a steak on the menu 
with your name on it, the Merle Ellis Porterhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big steak, over a pound, cooked and served in a cast-iron skillet, 
then carved at the table. So I decided to write and ask if you had the recipe 
for the Merle Ellis Porterhouse." 
</P>
<P>
The steak in question was on the menu at the Mason Beach Grill at the Sheraton 
at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco five or six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
To fix the steak, select as good a porterhouse as you can find, well-marbled, 
preferably with a bit of age on it and at least one-inch thick -- an inch and a 
half is even better. 
</P>
<P>
Trim it well of all but a thin layer of outside fat. Give each side a few 
generous grinds of good coarse black pepper. Pour about one-quarter inch of the 
best olive oil you can afford in the bottom of a glass dish large enough to 
hold the steak and lay the steak in the oil. Let the steak marinate in the oil 
for several hours, turning from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat. (I prefer a grill pan with raised 
ridges to let the fat drip away.) Remove the steak from the oil and pat off any 
excess oil with a paper towel. Sear the steak first on one side and then the 
other over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook to the desired 
degree of doneness, turning twice more. 
</P>
<P>
Remove the steak to a heated serving platter. Pour off any fat in the grill pan 
and return the pan to the stove over low heat. Add two tablespoons of butter 
and the juice of half a lemon to the pan and with a basting brush incorporate 
any drippings left in the bottom of the pan to make a nice sauce to pour over 
the steak. Carve the steak, pour over the sauce and serve immediately. A good 
steak doesn't like to be kept waiting.

THE POWER OF PEANUT BUTTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BOSTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Americans bought 700 million pounds of peanut butter last year, says Mitch 
Head, executive director of the Peanut Advisory Board. That's three pounds per 
person, and enough to cover the entire floor of the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Peanut-butter consumption has risen more in the last two years than ever 
before. It's no wonder, then, that the peanut butter and jelly sandwich is the 
No. 1 sandwich in America. Each day, 20 million adults (who prefer chunky 
peanut butter) and children (who prefer creamy) carry it to work or school. By 
the time the average child finishes high school, he or she will have eaten some 
1,500 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, according to Head. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows how the iconic sandwich originated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely American, and probably started in the early 1900s," says Sarah 
Laubner, assistant marketing director for Trombly's Peanut Butter Fantasies in 
Boston, a company that markets peanut butter to adults. Jelly has been spread 
on bread for ages. Peanut butter came along about the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peanut Butter Accompaniments 
</P>
<P>
But as the people at Peanut Butter Fantasies know, jelly isn't the only thing 
that complements peanut butter and bread. How about a cucumber, cream cheese 
and peanut butter sandwich? Or Trombly's peanut butter dark sider, a Reuben 
sandwich made with peanut butter? 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been pounded into our heads that peanut butter only goes with 
jelly," says David Thibodeau, president of Trombly's. "People are saying 'Hey, 
we found our own way to eat peanut butter. It's a flavor we grew up on, and we 
can use it so many different ways.' " 
</P>
<P>
True fans will confess to using mayonnaise, honey, marshmallows, bananas, 
potato chips, chocolate, raisins, cheese, bacon -- almost anything. But 
"nothing will ever replace the standby PB&amp;J," says Thibodeau. His personal 
favorite: peanut butter and strawberry jam on burnt toast.

WHY FAVORITE PRODUCTS VANISH FROM STORE SHELVES; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING: THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY PRODUCTS DISAPPEAR -- RANGING FROM LOW 
SHOPPER ACCEPTANCE TO CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES, FROM NEW TECHNOLOGY TO 
CORPORATE ACQUISITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE E. MAYER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Abracadabra, poof! Now you see it, now you don't. 
</P>
<P>
Almost as fast as magic, products come and go at the supermarket. It seems like 
a simple fact of shopping: Grow attached to a product and before long, it will 
vanish from the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of Marjorie Levine. The Laurel, Md., special-education teacher 
discovered Ocean Spray's new carbonated fruit drink, "Splash," last March and 
instantly became one of its loyal buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Two months later she noticed it was on sale -- a clearance sale, she ultimately 
learned. In June, she no longer could find it on her supermarket's shelves. 
</P>
<P>
"I was annoyed. I kept going to various grocery stores to see if they carried 
it. I couldn't believe such a great product had disappeared," she says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Reasons 
</P>
<P>
There are a host of reasons why products become extinct -- ranging from low 
shopper acceptance to changing consumer tastes to new technology. Even the 
recent rash of corporate acquisitions has led to the demise of many popular 
products. 
</P>
<P>
And frequently, as was the case with Splash, the product is merely a test to 
see how consumers respond. Introduced and tested, the product may never see 
daylight again. 
</P>
<P>
Splash was introduced in the spring of 1988 in five cities around the country, 
only to be pulled a year later "to rework the flavors," says John Lawlor, Ocean 
Spray Cranberries Inc.'s manager of public relations. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept was well accepted, but consumers said the flavor combinations -- 
particularly the 'Peach 'N Passion' -- were not what they associated with Ocean 
Spray." The company is planning to reintroduce a new version of Splash early 
next year -- with more cranberry blends, of course. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Record Numbers 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the cause, marketing experts say items both old and new are being 
pulled off the shelves in record numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"Products are coming and going from the supermarket much more rapidly than they 
did five years ago," says Marlene Johnson, manager of product communication for 
Pillsbury Co. 
</P>
<P>
The reason lies largely in the number of new products -- more than 10,000 -- 
that are introduced annually. "In this day and age, with the physical 
constraints of shelf space, one item goes out for every item that goes in," 
says supermarket consultant Willard Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, if it doesn't sell," it goes, says David Hackney, public relations 
manager for Campbell Soup Co. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell recently dropped its gazpacho condensed soup because of low sales. 
Campbell thought the soup, which was introduced five years ago, would "lend 
itself well to the growing interest in Mexican and Spanish food," Hackney 
explains. "But not enough people were buying it; people had a perception 
problem" with eating gazpacho that came in a can. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Distribution Problems Too 
</P>
<P>
It was a distribution problem, however, that led to Campbell's decision two 
years ago to halt production of its Fresh Chef line of refrigerated sauces, 
salads and soups. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell shipped Fresh Chef the same way it sent its canned soups to the 
grocery stores. First, the product was sent to a supermarket warehouse; then it 
was trucked by the chain to a store's back room, where Fresh Chef sat until it 
could be stocked in the refrigerated case. This process "could take as long as 
30 days," Hackney recalls. "And for a product that has only 40 days of shelf 
life, by the time it hit the shelf, it was so close to the expiration date 
consumers wouldn't buy it." 
</P>
<P>
Although Campbell lost more than $20 million on Fresh Chef, the company today 
is again testing the fresh, refrigerated concept -- complete with a new 
distribution system -- on a more limited scale under the name Fresh Kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
Competition also has led to the demise of many a popular product. Remember 
Chipwich, the upscale ice-cream sandwich wrapped between two chocolate-chip 
cookies? Introduced in 1981, it was an immediate hit -- so much so that many 
other companies rushed to create rival adult-novelty ice-cream products, 
recalls Chipwich president Sam Metzger. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Metzger adds, most of these companies were giant food 
manufacturers that not only could afford the large advertising campaigns, but 
could also offer large discounts to encourage supermarkets to carry their 
products. "We couldn't afford it," Metzger says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gradual Reappearance 
</P>
<P>
So in 1984, Chipwich was dropped from the supermarkets, with the company's 
targeting sales instead to restaurants, ballparks and small mom-and-pop stores. 
Only recently, under new agreements with supermarkets, has Chipwich begun 
gradually reappearing in grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
Ice-cream products in particular seem to come and go in rapid fashion, thanks 
to the rapidly changing tastes of the American consumer. "We are a fickle 
nation, and with our affluence we can afford to be," says Ronald C. Curhan, 
professor of marketing at Boston University's School of Management. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's explosion of frozen-fruit bars is a good example. It has all but 
fizzled as "consumers saturated themselves with the product, and their interest 
in the whole variety waned," says Debby Schapiro, marketing manager of the 
International Ice Cream Assn. Now the freezer case is being inundated with 
"light" ice creams and frozen-yogurt products. 
</P>
<P>
"Manufacturers of food products have a unique problem in terms of being able to 
predict a product's success," says Robert Kopp, assistant professor of 
marketing at Babson College. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumers may try a product and repurchase it several times and then they 
become satiated with the product. The novelty wears off after several repeat 
purchases. In my own experience, I remember when I became very attached to 
Klondikes and Dove Bars. I made several repeat purchases. Finally I got 
satiated with that product class, and I haven't bought them in months." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps one reason why ice-cream products are so vulnerable is that they are a 
novelty, says Robert Wunderle, economist and vice president of Supermarkets 
General Corp. "One of the most common reasons why a product fails is that it's 
a passing fashion or short-term novelty. If it becomes part of an integral part 
of the diet -- like spaghetti, yogurt or chicken -- its popularity won't 
change." 
</P>
<P>
Just as too much competition can hurt business, so can too little competition. 
At least, that is what a trade source who didn't want to be identified says 
caused the demise of Dannon Co.'s flavored yogurt drink, Dannup. 
</P>
<P>
Launched in 1987 with big hopes that it would meet as much success in the 
United States as yogurt drinks have in Europe, Dannup was pulled off the market 
earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall interest was not enough to sustain the brand," explains company 
spokeswoman Barbara Beck. The chief problem, says Beck, was "getting customers 
to try it. Once they tried it, there was great interest." 
</P>
<P>
But it costs a great deal of money to get people to try a product -- more than 
Dannon could afford, the trade source says. If only another one or two 
companies had made a competing product, the combined promotions may have gained 
wider consumer attention, prompting more people to try the drink. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate acquisitions also have contributed to the disappearance of many 
products. One marketing expert fondly remembers Guido's Italian Ice. "It was a 
very, very popular item in Chicago," the expert recalls. 
</P>
<P>
But the company that made Guido's, Nutrafoods International, was acquired by 
the Coca-Cola Co. in 1985. Coke "did a little bit of tinkering" with Guido's, 
which was a type of push-up Popsicle, a Coke spokesman said. It was ultimately 
reintroduced as "Minute-Maid Fruit Juicee." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Went National 
</P>
<P>
"We felt if we were going to go national with the product, we would do better 
with the name Minute Maid," the Coke spokesman said. But the marketing expert 
recalls, "It wasn't as good." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, when Boboli Inc. was acquired by General Foods Corp. a little more 
than two years ago, the Boboli -- a pre-baked pizza dough shell that could be 
embellished with toppings of the consumer's choice -- began to disappear from 
frozen-food cases around the country. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, explains Boboli sales manager Hank Bradanini, was that General 
Foods wanted to "concentrate all our efforts" on delivering the product fresh, 
instead of frozen. "And obviously with one facility in California, we can't 
ship fresh throughout the United States." 
</P>
<P>
For now, Boboli is selling its pizza crusts, which can be topped with fresh 
fruit as well as tomato sauce, in Northern California, Nevada and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changes in Technology 
</P>
<P>
New technology also has played a hand in driving some products off the shelves. 
The advent of self-locking plastic bags, for example, "has made freezer paper 
hard to find," says Anne Cockrell, consumer-affairs manager of Safeway Stores 
Inc.'s Washington division. Similarly, she adds, the large cans of fruit juices 
are being replaced by glass or refrigerated cartons. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, even best-selling products may disappear for reasons totally 
beyond anyone's control. 
</P>
<P>
Take Perdue Farms Inc.'s popular Perdue Done It! roasted chicken and chicken 
parts. A major fire at Perdue's Bridgewater, Va., processing facility last 
September has kept that item off the market for nearly a year now. 
</P>
<P>
Given all that can go wrong, it is mind-boggling to think how many age-old 
products remain on the shelves, notes Boston University's Curhan: 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing to me as I go into a store to still find a number of items that I 
can recall knowing growing up. You can still find Corn Flakes. You can still 
find Rice Krispies. You can still find Quaker Oats oatmeal. No matter how many 
new products come along, the successful products are still holding their own."

TOMATOES ARE A PERENNIAL CHOICE FOR COOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRMA S. ROMBAUER and MARION ROMBAUER BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those of us accustomed to having the highest court in the land pronounce 
judgment upon paramount issues of national life will not be surprised to learn 
that as long ago as 1893, the justices resoundingly declared the tomato a 
vegetable, not a fruit. Either way, it ranks with lemon as a perennial 
inspiration for culinary uplift -- fresh or canned, or as juice, puree, paste, 
catsup or chili sauce. 
</P>
<P>
In many sections of the country, fresh large-sized, field-grown tomatoes are 
not available during the colder months, being supplanted by hydroponic or 
hothouse-grown kinds. We find most of these disappointingly mushy in texture. 
Try occasionally the meaty pear-shaped Italian tomatoes, which are sweeter than 
the American types. 
</P>
<P>
When you use fresh tomatoes in cooking, their juiciness is seldom an asset. To 
avoid watery results, slit the stem end and remove it; then, holding your hand 
palm down above a bowl, squeeze the tomato to eject excess juice and seeds. 
When recipes call for strained canned tomatoes, be sure to force the pulp 
through the sieve well, to make the most of its thickening and seasoning power, 
and watch the brands -- the less expensive brands are apt to be diluted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staples in Diet 
</P>
<P>
Tomatoes have run the usual checkered-gamut of vegetable introductions: they 
were regarded at one time or another as purely decorative, poisonous and 
aphrodisiac. Now that they have become staples, it is nice to emphasize their 
solid virtues, one of which is high Vitamin A and Vitamin C content. 
</P>
<P>
These values as well as good color and condition may be preserved in ripe (not 
overripe) fruit for as long as five to six days after picking if stored upside 
down in light (not sunlight) unwrapped, at between 65 and 75 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The best practice, though, is to make use of only vine-ripened fruit and to 
store it at once in the refrigerator. Similarly, to assure maximum food value, 
prepare tomatoes just before serving. Tomatoes of mature size but still green 
in color may be ripened on a windowsill but will lack the flavor and some of 
the nutritive value of their vine-ripened counterparts. Immature small-sized 
tomatoes will not ripen satisfactorily after harvesting. Use them, if at all, 
for pickling. Do not attempt to freeze tomatoes: no effective process has yet 
been developed.

A FESTIVAL OF LEARNING; 
</P>
<P>
STUDENTS STUDIED TO GIVE EVENTS MEANING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
For students at Miller Elementary School in Escondido, the Soviet arts festival 
will be remembered for much more than a one-time field trip to a folk dance or 
painting exhibit. After all, how many busloads of San Diego County children 
riding to the Soviet Georgian Youth Company's performance Wednesday could play 
"Simon Says" in Russian? 
</P>
<P>
But for the fourth- and fifth-graders at Miller, that game is only one of many 
activities involving Soviet culture, language and politics that their teachers 
have added to the curriculum to make the festival experience meaningful and 
long-lasting. 
</P>
<P>
The faculty took to heart the information from two workshops on the Soviet 
Union given earlier this fall by the San Diego County Office of Education and 
from festival education guides prepared by specialists from San Diego city 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
The students in Debi Johnson's class are "traveling" to the Soviet Union as the 
first stop of an around-the-world "trip" to learn geography and world cultures 
during the next several months. Already, they have prepared individual 
passports using instant cameras and have studied immigration procedures on how 
to enter various countries. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has encouraged students to talk with their parents about what they know 
about Russia. "My dad has been telling me about (past) wars and all the guns 
and tanks they have," said 10-year-old Henry Sintay, "but I think things are 
changing. . . . Gorbachev is the first good president they've got." To which 
his 9-year-old classmate Michael Carley added, "I think he is OK." 
</P>
<P>
Kristen Shipley's fifth-grade students have composed watercolor designs using 
Russian designs, and have learned to sing several songs in the language, 
including "Brat Ivan," better known here as "Frere Jacques" or "Brother John." 
They also drew up signs saying "hello," "goodby," and "thank you" in the 
Cyrillic alphabet to show to the dancers Wednesday, when they went to a 
performance by young dancers from Tbilisi at the Starlight Bowl in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Ernest Kutcher is putting together slide shows from his trip to the 
Soviet Union a decade ago with the Phi Beta Kappa educational organization, 
drawing "oohs" and "ahs" from children when they see close-ups of Soviet 
children speaking in class and of the deep snows that sculpt that nation's 
winter landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido schools specialist Pat Saville learned to play the balalaika (a 
triangle-shaped instrument resembling a guitar) as well as a Russian-style 
accordion to bring authenticity to the Russian folk songs that the students 
sing. And Kutcher added an album of Soviet rock music, which grabbed the 
attention of those children who disbelieved that rock is not exclusive to 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Before Principal Judith Adams encouraged the staff to use the arts festival in 
a major way, few if any of the students knew much about the Soviet Union. "I 
guess I thought they were at war with us," Meghann Kime, 10, said. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the current news, it's important for our students to have more 
information about the Soviet Union," Adams said. "And, if you learn things in 
isolation" such as a Soviet folk dance, without tying it to larger issues, then 
"the learning is not as meaningful," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Shipley added: "Until now, all the kids heard about is 'Star Wars' and the 
like. Hopefully the legacy of the arts festival will be that our kids are going 
to be much more the children of the world than we were."

UCSD RESEARCHERS SIFT THROUGH NIMITZ DATA; 
</P>
<P>
EARTHQUAKE: THE TEAM THAT RUSHED TO THE SITE OF THE OAKLAND COLLAPSE WILL USE 
THE INFORMATION TO HELP AVERT SIMILAR TRAGEDIES. 
</P>

For UC San Diego researcher Gilbert Hegemier, Oct. 17's tragic earthquake in 
the San Francisco Bay Area was a raw reminder that much of what engineers know 
about the damage caused by temblors has been learned during field visits 
conducted after a quake. 
</P>
<P>
"Every one of these teaches us a new lesson," said Hegemier, who spent four 
days climbing over and under the collapsed section of the Nimitz Freeway in 
Oakland, as well as nearby structures that survived intact or suffered 
relatively minor damage. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the collapse of the double-deck Nimitz, researchers from around 
the country assembled to measure, photograph and assess the damage. The 
scientists rushed to the scene because, "as (officials) tear the Nimitz down, 
we're losing information," Hegemier said. "We're more concerned with preserving 
data and evidence" that will help researchers understand why the structure 
collapsed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The three UCSD researchers who arrived in San Francisco the day after the quake 
went to work even as rescuers were pulling out bodies from the Nimitz. Cars 
crushed by the failed structure continued to smolder, and aftershocks buffeted 
the bridge's precariously balanced remains. 
</P>
<P>
Because earthquake engineering is still evolving, a quake's aftermath serves as 
"our main laboratory," said Hegemier, director of the Charles Powell Structural 
Systems Laboratory at UCSD, where researchers test designs by subjecting 
buildings, bridges and other structures to earthquake-like forces. 
</P>
<P>
Actual quakes provide a firsthand glimpse into why structures fail, whereas 
research facilities can only simulate the destructive effects. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD researchers last week determined that the Nimitz collapsed when the 
15-second quake shook apart the ill-designed and under-reinforced joints that 
connected its roadways to its massive reinforced-concrete support columns. 
</P>
<P>
The joint failures were visible "in column after column after column," 
according to Nigel Priestley, a UCSD structural engineering professor who has 
been retained by the state Department of Transportation to devise methods of 
strengthening suspect bridges around the state. 
</P>
<P>
The massive joints, described by most experts as "state of the art" when 
designed during the 1950s, failed to survive the huge forces generated as the 
freeway lurched back and forth during the earthquake. The joints provided "a 
natural place for weakness, and there was virtually no reinforcement" evident 
in them, Priestley said. 
</P>
<P>
Should Caltrans officials be held accountable for not having reinforced the 
joints? Probably not, Hegemier said, because joints had never before failed 
during an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that joints have become a major concern," he said. "It 
is now very clear that joints ought to be included" in Caltrans' program to 
reinforce bridges. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a complex and unusual bridge," Priestley said. "It's not a standard . 
. . and there are some unusual aspects to it that make it prone to damage." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for those who died Oct. 17, the now-obvious design flaws became 
apparent only after the structure fell, Hegemier and Priestley said. 
</P>
<P>
If the past is a guide, engineers will eventually craft a "Band-Aid" solution 
to keep the handful of bridges that share elements of the Nimitz's design from 
collapsing as well. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the state has used a "Band-Aid" approach after past quakes. For 
example, inspections conducted after one recent earthquake alerted Caltrans to 
the likelihood that major quakes might destroy the circular columns that hold 
up as many as 700 of the state's older bridges. Another post-quake inspection 
led Caltrans to reinforce certain bridges by beefing up expansion joints. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of those two quakes, Caltrans awarded UCSD a pair of contracts to 
find ways to buttress bridges that might not survive major temblors. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose it would be easy to extend" those contracts to include joints, 
Hegemier said. 
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that Caltrans should not take technology gleaned from one 
quake-related "fix" and attempt to use it on another problem. 
</P>
<P>
Reinforcing the Nimitz Freeway's columns wouldn't have helped the bridge 
survive the Oct. 17 quake, because "this is tricky stuff," Hegemier said. 
"Reinforcing one part, you may just move the failure to another part." 
</P>
<P>
The accident "could have happened anyway," Priestley said. 
</P>
<P>
"The joint problem with (the Nimitz) is not a simple one," Hegemier said. "I 
could not tell you in the next five minutes how I would retrofit. The trick is 
to find (a solution) that's economically feasible . . . and then you've got to 
demonstrate that it's going to work." 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations involve expensive, tedious work: Although the section of Nimitz 
was destroyed in just 15 seconds, it can take months or years for scientists to 
conduct an experiment that duplicates nature's fury. 
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, only a handful of facilities, including the UCSD laboratory in La 
Jolla, are designed to perform earthquake testing. Before construction of the 
UCSD facility in 1985, the only similar earthquake laboratory was in Japan. A 
second U.S. facility recently opened in Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Hegemier, whose laboratory is constantly scrambling for funding, hopes federal 
and state officials will respond to the worst U.S. quake since 1906 by 
loosening up funding for earthquake engineering research. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt that, if (the country) adopts a 'Band-Aid' solution, that 
we'll face big problems in the future," Hegemier said. "It's going to take both 
time and resources to correct the problem." 
</P>
<P>
But only full-scale testing of bridges and buildings will "uncover problems 
like the joints," he said. "Otherwise you wait until the next earthquake, and 
that always involves loss of life and economic hardships. The more big testing 
we do now, the more we'll learn." 
</P>
<P>
In the UCSD laboratory, researchers are slowly tearing apart a 60-foot span of 
freeway cut from an interstate bridge in the Fresno area. They also are 
destroying models of columns that hold up hundreds of interstate bridges. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1990s, UCSD researchers will build -- and slowly destroy -- a 
five-story reinforced concrete building. The building's carefully orchestrated 
death will be tracked by a complex system of sensors that will feed a constant 
stream of data into high-speed computers. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers expect results of that experiment -- along with data from other 
tests -- to lead to improved design and construction methods that will reduce 
the loss of life and property during quakes. 
</P>
<P>
But Hegemier, who will spend a year and $2 million to destroy the five-story 
building, knows that funding for earthquake research is scarce. 
</P>
<P>
"We waste a lot of time trying to get funding, and once we're up and running we 
seem to be renewing (that funding) every five minutes," he said. "We have to 
live with that because it's a fact of life." 
</P>
<P>
"San Francisco had a big problem, but they were lucky," Hegemier said. "Had the 
epicenter been closer, the situation would have been very different. The 
situation demands proper resource allocations."

NAVY BRANDS OFFSHORE OIL RIGS TRAINING HAZARD; 
</P>
<P>
COASTLINE: THOUGH THEIR REASONS DIFFER, MILITARY OFFICIALS FIND THEMSELVES 
ALIGNED WITH ENVIRONMENTALISTS IN OPPOSING DRILLING OFF CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Navy and Marine Corps officials Wednesday called offshore oil rigs a danger to 
ships, submarines and military operations off the coast. 
</P>
<P>
The rigs pose an "unacceptable safety hazard," according to a Navy report 
released Wednesday by Reps. Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado) and Ron Packard 
(R-Carlsbad). 
</P>
<P>
As Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan studies the California coast for offshore 
drilling sites, Navy officials released a report explaining that, during Navy 
exercises simulating wartime conditions, submarines might not use active sonar 
and would be unable to detect oil rigs. 
</P>
<P>
Oil rigs and noise from drilling would interfere with a variety of exercises 
now conducted, including sea-skimming missile and acoustic instrumentation 
tests, according to the report issued by Capt. J. B. Hinkle, director of Navy 
Programs, in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"The Navy is aware of the potential hazards that offshore oil rigs present to 
navigation of submerged submarines and surface shipping," said Lt. James Wood, 
a Washington-based Navy spokesman. "As a matter of normal operating procedures, 
the Navy monitors the location of U.S. oil rigs to ensure the safety of our 
operations." 
</P>
<P>
The report also catalogued two cases in which submarines ran into oil rigs in 
the last eight years, one involving a U.S. submarine. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has 564 ships, including 100 attack submarines and 35 ballistic 
missile submarines, Wood said. About 100 of the Navy's ships are based in the 
San Diego area, where the Marine Corps and the Navy conduct extensive 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
Marine Corps officials said oil rigs also pose hazards for their personnel at 
sea. Marines routinely train in an area stretching 25 nautical miles out to sea 
and along 17 miles of coast, said Gunnery Sgt. Stan Pederson, a Marine 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"We are opposed to any surface or sub-surface structures along Camp Pendleton's 
coastline," said a statement issued by Camp Pendleton officials. "Any structure 
in this area would have a severe negative impact on amphibious training and the 
bases' role in national defense." 
</P>
<P>
Navy spokesman Cmdr. David Dillon added, "It would interfere with our ability 
to train off the coast. Camp Pendleton and the area is a national asset for 
training -- you cannot replace it." 
</P>
<P>
The thorny issue of offshore drilling may forge partnerships between 
unconventional allies: military personnel and environmentalists. At a hearing 
in Carlsbad earlier this year, the two groups both opposed drilling. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an unusual alignment," Dillon said. 
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday's press conference in Washington, Hunter and Packard cited the 
Navy report and called for a special hearing, saying the oil rigs would pose 
hazards to military personnel and to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the dangers of a collision between a submarine and a stationary rig 
pumping oil, Packard said, "We could have a spill that would truly devastate 
our beach line. It could be catastrophic for our area." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter said, "It's alarming. There's substantial danger. The military 
leadership in the Navy and Marine Corps does not want to see oil rigs in the 
training area. They've kept quiet because of a discipline and a loyalty to 
their President and to the secretary of the interior." 
</P>
<P>
There is now a moratorium on drilling off California, and, earlier this year, 
President Bush created a task force to study the effect of such drilling, which 
he has said he favors as a means of lessening the nation's reliance on foreign 
oil. The task force is expected to issue its recommendations in January. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Lujan, who heads the task force, Hunter and Packard say that 
lifting the President's moratorium on drilling "would have serious implications 
for our national security." 
</P>
<P>
Two accidents were cited in the Navy report. One occurred last year when a 
submerged 500-ton West German submarine ran into a Norwegian offshore oil 
platform in the North Sea. There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The other incident involved an American submarine, the Archerfish, which hit an 
ocean oil rig -- officials declined to say where the rig was situated -- and 
caused an estimated $1 million in damage in 1981. The Archerfish is based in 
Groton, Conn.

ANOTHER PROBE URGED OF DUFFY'S OUTSIDE JOBS; 
</P>
<P>
ETHICS: A LAWYER SEEKING AN INTERNAL REVIEW SAYS DUFFY HAS FIRED DEPUTIES FOR 
LYING WHILE ATTEMPTING TO HIDE HIS OWN ACTIVITIES AS A PRIVATE CONSULTANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Noting that San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy has fired rank-and-file 
deputies for lying, a local attorney said Wednesday that he will ask the 
Sheriff's Department's internal affairs division to review allegations that the 
sheriff lied about his work as a private consultant. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second time this week that a formal investigation has been requested 
into allegations of misconduct by Duffy for allegedly attempting to hide his 
outside income. 
</P>
<P>
James Gattey, an attorney who has represented dozens of sheriff's deputies 
disciplined by Duffy for misconduct, said the same high set of standards should 
be applied to the sheriff himself, especially now that Duffy is offering 
conflicting versions of his activities as a private consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy told a television interviewer in June that he has always lived on his 
county salary and that "I don't have a second job." He told reporters Tuesday 
that he had advised Chief Administrative Officer Norman Hickey about his 
outside work, but Hickey says he never knew Duffy had a second income. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported Sunday that Duffy earned about $150 a day for more than 38 
days of work for a Washington consultant firm, and Duffy told a KFMB (Channel 
8) television reporter Wednesday that he made $500 a day working for a second 
firm reviewing the management of the Arlington, Tex., Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy told The Times this summer that he could not remember why he made three 
trips to Texas and Washington, trips he took as a private consultant. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff has failed to report any of the income on his annual public 
disclosure forms, contending that he is not required to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Gattey's request for an internal Sheriff's Department review of Duffy and his 
consulting work is the second plea for a formal investigation into the matter. 
Another attorney, Everett Bobbitt, plans to file a complaint with the state 
Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Both Gattey and Bobbitt provide legal representation for deputies who are 
disciplined, but each of them has emphasized that he is filing the complaints 
as a private citizen. 
</P>
<P>
Gattey said that, in the past two years, he has represented five deputies who 
were harshly disciplined by Duffy for misconduct involving untruthfulness. 
</P>
<P>
"In all of those cases, with one exception, termination was the discipline that 
the sheriff imposed," Gattey said. "The one exception was a lesser penalty, and 
it involved an extremely minor matter." 
</P>
<P>
Gattey said Duffy has long demanded that his staff be honest and truthful, both 
in dealing with the public and their superiors. Gattey said credibility is a 
law enforcement officer's most precious attribute. 
</P>
<P>
"I have heard a number of senior members of the command staff say that the lack 
of truthfulness effectively makes a law enforcement officer worthless," he 
said. "They are called upon to testify in court. They must represent themselves 
properly to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"And, if the public has any questions about them and recognizes any problems 
about their truthfulness, then their effectiveness as a law enforcement officer 
is done away with," Gattey said. Duffy refused to talk to The Times on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Gary Cantrell, of the sheriff's internal affairs division, said he is 
unsure how the complaint against the sheriff will be handled.

PILOTS SUE TO BLOCK TORRANCE DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of pilots has sued the city of Torrance, charging that city officials 
ignored state land-use laws when they gave permission for construction of 52 
new homes and an office building under the departure pattern for Torrance 
Municipal Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in Torrance Superior Court by the 1,600-member California 
Aviation Council and the Torrance Airport Assn., asks that a judge block the 
city from issuing building permits for the former Meadow Park Elementary School 
site until the city submits the project for county review. 
</P>
<P>
Local pilots said at a press conference Tuesday that they were not aware of the 
Meadow Park project until grading began this summer. Residents living near the 
project, which is surrounded on three sides by homes, opposed initial plans to 
build condominiums on the site. After more than two years of debate, the City 
Council approved the construction of 52 homes and a 43,000-square-foot office 
building. 
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, held next to the site at the corner of Lomita 
Boulevard and Ocean Avenue, attorney Scott Raphael, Aviation Council director 
Walter Lull and three representatives from Torrance airport groups said planes 
flying over the site make it too dangerous and too loud for residential or 
office construction. 
</P>
<P>
City noise regulations require most aircraft taking off from Torrance airport, 
which lies within 3,900 feet of the Meadow Park site, to make a 45-degree turn 
directly over the site. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that 60% of all general aviation accidents take place within one mile of 
a runway, Raphael said the Meadow Park site is at even greater risk because 
planes are both turning and ascending as they pass over it. 
</P>
<P>
"The most likely area for an accident to take place is right here where we're 
standing," he said. "Where are the politicians going to be if a plane crashes 
here in five years and kills 50 people?" 
</P>
<P>
A secretary at Val-Co Enterprises said developer Arthur Valdez was in Australia 
this week and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Kenneth Nelson said he could not comment on the suit, which names 
all seven City Council members, until he has had a chance to review it. 
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuit, state law requires Torrance to submit any project 
planned within a mile of the airport for review by a county airport land-use 
planning commission. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance did not do so, planning director David Ferren said, adding that city 
officials are not familiar with the law. 
</P>
<P>
Ferren noted that airport noise problems already were taken into consideration 
when an environmental impact report was completed for Valdez's initial proposal 
-- a 174-unit condominium development. 
</P>
<P>
The council ultimately required Valdez to include several soundproofing 
measures when he builds the houses, including double-paned window glass and 
thick insulation. 
</P>
<P>
Under the state law, however, the Los Angeles County Regional Planning 
Commission is designated as the correct agency for reviewing projects near 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
But John Huttinger, the commission's assistant administrator for community 
planning, said vague wording in the law could be interpreted as exempting Los 
Angeles altogether. 
</P>
<P>
His commission has been waiting for a ruling from the county counsel's office 
before agreeing to take on the airport cases. 
</P>
<P>
No city in the county has ever approached the commission for review, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone agrees that the thing is poorly written," Huttinger said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Legislature approved an amendment to the law two months ago that 
may help resolve much of the confusion surrounding how it is to be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment also may nullify the aviation council's suit, Huttinger said, 
because it sets a June 30, 1991, deadline for counties to create airport 
land-use plans and orders all suits stemming from the law postponed until that 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is they're going to be jeopardizing people by putting homes here," 
Torrance Area Pilots Assn. President Ted Stinis said. "An industrial use, 
anything with a parking lot that you can plop the airplane in without killing 
people, is more appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Council members expressed disgust with the lawsuit, saying it was nothing more 
than an attempt to harass the city. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't discussing anything about planes dropping out of the sky when it 
was still a school site, with hundreds of kids running around," Councilman Dan 
Walker said. "I think this is just stupid. That's the best way of putting it." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman George Nakano said he thinks the lawsuit could backfire on the 
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if they're looking for a death wish, but what they're doing is 
giving rise to those people who are advocating closure of the airport," Nakano 
said, adding that at present he does not favor shutting down the facility. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should a city be subjected to this kind of harassment time after time by 
people who live outside of the city? We could stop this by closing the airport, 
and I'm sure those people who are advocating the closure would say this."

CAR DEALER PENALIZED IN SALE OF USED 'NEW' AUTOS

A Thousand Oaks car dealership has been fined $46,000 and will be shut down for 
two days next month for failing to tell customers their "new" cars had actually 
been used for driver education classes by the Conejo Valley Unified School 
District, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The action against Shaver Pontiac follows a two-year probe that began when one 
customer, a private detective, grew suspicious about his car's problems. He 
discovered through a check of Department of Motor Vehicles records that the car 
had once been registered to the school district, according to the Ventura 
County district attorney's office and the man's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara attorney Robert L. Monk said that, like the other victims, the 
buyer had been told that the car showed thousands of miles on its odometer 
because it was a "demonstrator," used to give test drives and driven by 
employees of the dealership. 
</P>
<P>
"It's embarrassing to feel like you've been had," said Monk, who has filed five 
lawsuits against the dealership on behalf of five customers who allege they 
were lied to about their cars' histories. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Silver, an attorney for Shaver Pontiac, said that "one of the 
unfortunate consequences of this has been to discourage Shaver and other 
dealers from providing these cars to school districts." He declined to comment 
further. 
</P>
<P>
A suspension of its operating and sales license will close the dealership Nov. 
25 and 26 as part of its penalties, said William Gengler, a spokesman for the 
Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The DMV found the dealership failed to inform at least five customers that the 
cars they were purchasing had been used by the school district. The DMV gave 
Shaver Pontiac the choice of having its license suspended for five days, or 
facing a two-day suspension plus $20,000 in fines, said Gengler. The dealership 
chose the latter punishment. The DMV also fined Shaver Pontiac nearly $6,000 to 
cover investigation expenses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The dealership also was ordered to pay $20,000 in civil penalties as part of an 
out-of-court settlement with the Ventura County district attorney's office, 
which had filed a consumer-protection lawsuit against the auto dealer. 
</P>
<P>
The dealership admitted no wrongdoing in its settlement. Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Linda S. Groberg said criminal charges were not pursued because of the 
difficulty in proving that the dealership and its salesmen intended to defraud 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
But a Simi Valley woman who also sued Shaver Pontiac said she was angered by 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way I can get my restitution is through my own private lawsuit," said 
Jennifer Tarara. "I don't think our justice system is working very well if they 
can defraud people like this . . . and have it not be viewed as a criminal 
matter." 
</P>
<P>
Tarara said she paid about $15,000 for a 1986 Grand Am and learned only last 
April, after many repairs and arguments with the dealership, that it had been 
used in driver education classes. She said the DMV contacted her during its 
investigation.

DEPUTY D.A. SENTENCED ON DRUNK-DRIVING CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A veteran deputy district attorney who once prosecuted former California 
Highway Patrol Officer Craig Peyer for murder has been sentenced to two days in 
an honor camp for his second drunk-driving conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph van Orshoven, 58, was ordered this week to spend two days in the 
Descanso honor camp under his five-year probation. 
</P>
<P>
Van Orshoven, who has been with the district attorney's office more than 20 
years, was also fined $980 by El Cajon Municipal Court Judge Eddie Sturgeon. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Rhonda Cartwright said Wednesday that the court restricted 
Van Orshoven to driving only to and from the El Cajon courthouse, where he now 
works. The restriction will last a year. 
</P>
<P>
She said Van Orshoven is also barred from drinking any alcoholic beverage for 
one year. 
</P>
<P>
"The sentence that was handed down Monday is the standard sentence for 
second-time driving under the influence," Cartwright said. Because of a 
possible conflict of interest, the state attorney general's office prosecuted 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Van Orshoven, who was not present for the misdemeanor sentencing, pleaded no 
contest Oct. 2 to driving under the influence as a result of an July 28 arrest 
by the CHP on California 67 near Lakeside. 
</P>
<P>
He also was convicted of drunk driving in 1987, and was also placed on 
probation, but his record was expunged last year. 
</P>
<P>
Cartwright is seeking to have that expungement order set aside because she said 
her office was not notified of that request at the time. A hearing in El Cajon 
on the matter is set for Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
If the attorney general's office is successful in reinstating Van Orshoven's 
first conviction, he faces the possibility of having his probation revoked and 
being sent to jail for 30 days.

POST OFFICE FENCES OUT DOWNTOWN STREET PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Problems with transients and the homeless have forced the downtown post office 
to erect a tall, wrought-iron fence with sharp points curled outward in both 
the front and rear of the building. 
</P>
<P>
A local Postal Service spokesman said the $30,000 fence is being erected to 
stop the vandalism against the vehicles parked in the rear and to deter people 
from using the front and rear of the building "as a toilet." 
</P>
<P>
"We thought a fence is the best way to go to protect our customers and 
employees," said spokesman Ken Boyd. "We planted bushes in the front but that 
didn't work. People were still sleeping in there and using the area to relieve 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
A clerk at the downtown post office, on E Street across from the main library, 
said customers frequently complained about transients sleeping in the bushes. 
He noted that several local businesses, including the Salvation Army 
headquarters at 7th Avenue and E Street, and the Great Western parking garage 
across the street, have erected similar fences to keep transients out. 
</P>
<P>
The gray fence, which is clearly designed to deter people from climbing over 
it, lines a busy thoroughfare used by hundreds of commuters every day while 
leaving downtown en route to California 94 and Interstate 5. The fence will 
extend most of the block on E and F streets. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to send a security officer down there every morning to make our 
building accessible to our customers. There are a lot of people milling about 
on the front steps," Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
A homeless person who wanted to be identified only as Jerome, acknowledged that 
transients sleep among the bushes and also relieve themselves there. 
</P>
<P>
"But I wouldn't think that people sleeping in the bushes would be the problem. 
They're full of thorns and too low to the ground. But some people go to the 
bathroom there. I mean, when there's no other place to go, what do they want 
people to do?" said Jerome. 
</P>
<P>
Another transient said that postal authorities were really trying to keep 
"street people" away from the front of the building and from sitting on the 
steps leading up to the two entrances. 
</P>
<P>
"Their guards patrol around the building and are always hassling people," Joe 
Holley said. "They don't want you sitting on the steps. They don't want you 
standing on the steps. They've got no right telling us to move off the 
sidewalks but they do. They treat homeless people like dirt." 
</P>
<P>
Transients and homeless people congregate throughout the day at the two bus 
benches in front of the building and by the newspaper racks. They also 
frequently use the bathrooms in the main library when it is open. 
</P>
<P>
The fence is being put up by a Riverside County company.

STUDY CITES BENEFITS OF USING PALMDALE ROUTE FOR LAS VEGAS TRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed high-speed train from Las Vegas though Palmdale to Sylmar would be 
easier, quicker and less expensive to build -- but also would have fewer riders 
-- than rival routes ending in Anaheim, according to a study conducted for the 
city of Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
A 54-page report comparing route options for the $4-billion system was released 
by Palmdale city officials Wednesday in hopes it will help keep their city in 
the running against Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel with the data we have acquired, we can present a compelling story that 
would say, 'Yes, this is the way to go,' " said Palmdale Mayor William (Pete) 
Knight. The report was conducted by Daniel, Mann, Johnson &amp; Mendenhall, a 
Los Angeles engineering firm, and cost $49,600. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they plan to use the report at Friday's meeting of the 
California-Nevada Super Speed Ground Transportation Commission, a panel of 
officials from both states charged with exploring development of the train 
system. 
</P>
<P>
The commission was expected to consider choosing between the alternative 
termination points in Southern California. But Palmdale officials said they 
will urge the commission instead to ask for opinions from private businesses 
considering building the 230-mile system. 
</P>
<P>
The Palmdale consultant found that a Palmdale-Sylmar line could be 45% less 
expensive, completed up to a year sooner and have fewer environmental impacts 
than the others. It would travel through less-developed areas, likely reducing 
the cost of obtaining right-of-way and the political and construction snafus 
that could delay the project or inflate costs, the consultant said. 
</P>
<P>
The route, which would aid Los Angeles' long-delayed plans to develop a 
regional airport in Palmdale, had been viewed as an underdog of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the commission released a study indicating alternative 
routes ending in Anaheim would draw 5.7 million and 6.5 million round trips 
annually by 2000, while a Palmdale-Sylmar line would have just 2.3 million 
round trips. 
</P>
<P>
The Palmdale report was more optimistic about the Palmdale-Sylmar link, but the 
projection of 3.76 million round trips by 2000 was still well below those of 
competing routes. 
</P>
<P>
The Palmdale report also said ridership by 2025 should increase to between 10.4 
million and 13.4 million round trips with development of the airport and growth 
in commuter ridership. The city consultant acknowledged, though, that those 
longer-range figures still might not exceed those for Anaheim.

ELSMERE LAND TO BE SOLD TO COUNTY, L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
LANDFILL: THE AGREEMENT WITH BKK CORP. UNDERCUTS AN EARLIER DEAL WITH A STATE 
AGENCY HOPING TO OBTAIN MOUNTAIN PARKLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a preliminary accord reached Wednesday night, BKK Corp. agreed to sell Los 
Angeles County and city its land holdings at Elsmere Canyon north of Sylmar, 
moving the site a step closer to development as a public landfill, County 
Supervisor Deane Dana said. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary agreement, which Dana said is still "at the handshake stage," 
climaxes nearly a week of intensive maneuvering and political intrigue over 
control of the proposed Elsmere dump, which city and county officials say is 
critical to solving trash-disposal problems. 
</P>
<P>
Dana said the deal will be worth about $125 million to BKK, which had amassed 
at least 500 acres of land at Elsmere Canyon along with options and an 
agreement in principle with the U.S. Forest Service to acquire nearly 1,000 
acres of federal lands needed for the dump. 
</P>
<P>
The deal also signifies BKK's 11th-hour withdrawal from a unique mutual aid 
pact with the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which was scheduled to 
acquire BKK's lands today -- thus making them condemnation-proof and giving the 
conservancy a bargaining chip in its effort to preserve three other canyons as 
parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly revealed last Friday by The Times, the secret agreement between the 
parks agency and waste disposal firm was meant to strengthen their bargaining 
power in pursuit of vastly different goals. 
</P>
<P>
BKK, which wanted to develop and run the Elsmere dump itself, faced the threat 
the county would use its power of condemnation to take the land if BKK did not 
agree to sell its interests at a price the county and city were willing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
And the conservancy -- a state agency that buys parkland in and near the Santa 
Monica Mountains -- wanted a promise that three other canyons would be saved if 
it acquiesced in the destruction of Elsmere canyon. The conservancy wanted 
Mission, Rustic and Sullivan canyons in the Santa Monicas, owned by the county 
and independent County Sanitation Districts, to become parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Following disclosure of the secret deal, which was to take effect today, city 
and county officials began intensive negotiations with BKK. The roughly $125 
million it will receive is about midway between the county's initial offer of 
more than $50 million and BKK's demand of $200 million to $225 million. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy's secret plan to forcibly inject itself as a player in the 
negotiations surprised and angered some city and county officials. Yet it 
appeared the conservancy may get something from the preliminary agreement, 
according to Dana and the conservancy's executive director, Joseph T. Edmiston. 
</P>
<P>
They said the deal appears to call for Sullivan and Rustic canyons, deep 
pristine clefts covering 1,900 acres, to become parkland either through 
donation or sale to the conservancy or another agency. 
</P>
<P>
But the deal reportedly is silent on the fate of Mission Canyon, where 
politically powerful developer Ray Watt wants to develop 500 expensive homes. 
The 400-acre canyon is already ringed by homes and was used by the sanitation 
districts as a dump for a while in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston said parkland status for Sullivan and Rustic canyons would be "a major 
step forward." But he predicted that legislation in Congress to transfer Forest 
Service lands in Elsmere to the city and county will face tough scrutiny from 
environmental interests, which will question whether enough new parkland is 
created to justify a trash dump on Forest Service holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Dana said the conservancy had caused "considerable disruption," but was "no 
longer a factor" because of the 11th-hour deal with BKK. He claimed the 
conservancy's gambit was "completely inappropriate" because the agency "was 
going to get . . . Rustic and Sullivan canyon anyway." 
</P>
<P>
In their effort to break up the pact between the conservancy and BKK, top city 
officials, including Mayor Tom Bradley, Tuesday had considered orchestrating an 
emergency vote of the conservancy board to void the deal with BKK, Deputy Mayor 
Mike Gage said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
State Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti (D-Los Angeles) confirmed reports 
that Bradley called him Tuesday afternoon to complain about the conservancy-BKK 
deal. He quoted Bradley as saying the BKK-conservancy deal would make 
development of the dump more costly for the city. Bradley also reportedly tried 
to reach Assembly Speaker Willie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti and Brown each appoint one member of the conservancy's decision-making 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti aide Rick Dunne said that, following Bradley's call, he discussed the 
issue with Gage. Dunne said that when Gage mentioned a possible vote on the BKK 
pact, he told Gage that Roberti "tries to appoint quality people but we do not 
tell our appointees . . . how to vote." 
</P>
<P>
Gage said late Wednesday he gave up the idea of the emergency meeting, but 
denied this was for lack of votes on the board to overturn the pact. "Now I 
don't think it's necessary to line up the votes," he said, declining to 
elaborate. But he apparently knew the deal between the city and county and BKK 
was near.

COURTHOUSE PLANS TURN INTO A TRIAL FOR TORRANCE; 
</P>
<P>
BUILDING: AFTER QUIETLY NEGOTIATING TO SCALE DOWN PLANS FOR THE NEW MUNICIPAL 
COURT BUILDING, TORRANCE OFFICIALS HAVE PUBLICLY CRITICIZED COURT OFFICIALS FOR 
NOT HEEDING THE CITY'S CONCERNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When South Bay Municipal Court personnel moved into the new Superior Court 
building in Torrance in 1968, they intended to stay only a few years until 
their own courthouse could be completed. 
</P>
<P>
Built to handle decades of Superior Court expansion as the South Bay's 
population swelled, the building had some extra space. No one saw any harm in 
letting the Municipal Court use it awhile. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, a lengthy planning process and the tax-limiting provisions of 
Proposition 13 turned "awhile" into 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the Torrance courthouse bursting at the seams with personnel and 
caseloads, state legislation has finally made $60 million available to build a 
new courthouse. Municipal Court officials have spent the last few months 
eagerly making plans, hoping to move to their new home in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance City Council members, however, are not pleased by what court officials 
envision. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, city officials were stunned by initial estimates that the new 
building would soar eight stories above the Torrance Civic Center. The city has 
little legal control over what is built on county-owned land and has been 
quietly negotiating to scale down the project before final plans are drawn. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations went public last week when irritated council members, debating how 
best to talk to the county, accused court administrators of paying scant 
attention to their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Although a report on the court's space needs submitted recently to county 
administrators now calls for only a five-story building with an adjacent 
five-level parking structure, council members say the proposed 
200,000-square-foot courthouse would be too bulky for the Civic Center area, 
even though it would be only 65 feet tall. The existing courthouse is 80 feet 
tall. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too damned big," City Councilman Dan Walker said when asked to summarize 
the council's concerns. "Everything we've seen so far is too big, too dense and 
not enough parking." 
</P>
<P>
Council members also criticize plans to lease private office space for 
temporary courtrooms, saying the proposed sites provide far too little parking. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Municipal Court Administrator Christopher Crawford said the council's 
discontent comes as a surprise to him. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been going out of our way to make sure that we are meeting with the 
city, sharing documents, sharing plans," he said. His report on the court's 
space needs "could have been submitted months ago, but it was only submitted 
Aug. 31 because of a months-long process of meeting and conferring with city 
staff." 
</P>
<P>
Meeting time has not been the problem, City Council members say. They believe 
the problem is that court planners have not been listening. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the problem is the attitude of the court people. It does not seem real 
open or real flexible," Councilman Mark Wirth said. "I haven't heard, 'What do 
you think of this?' We've heard, 'This is what we want to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
City Council members worry that allowing a massive new courthouse will gridlock 
traffic and overwhelm parking in and around the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
The council, which generally opposes parking structures for aesthetic and 
safety reasons, also is disgruntled over the size of the structure proposed for 
the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford said the building plan reflects existing and future needs of the 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Existing courthouse crowding is "intolerable," he said. Crawford noted that 10 
judges work out of eight courtrooms; clerical staff are assigned half the space 
they need, and jurors for the Municipal and Superior courts are packed into a 
basement assembly room with woefully inadequate restrooms and too few emergency 
exits. 
</P>
<P>
"It is horrendous," he said. "It's oppressive not only for the work force but 
for the public, too. It really is at the crisis point." 
</P>
<P>
The new courthouse cannot be scaled back, he said, "not unless we can prevail 
on the good nature of the citizens and transient residents of this district to 
commit fewer crimes and file fewer civil actions." 
</P>
<P>
Plans to turn leased office space into temporary courtrooms and clerical 
offices also have been discussed with the city, Crawford said. He said court 
administrators are looking for sites that meet both their space requirements 
and the city's parking requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford said he is continuing to look at several locations, but a city memo 
said the search has been narrowed to two: an empty warehouse east of the Civic 
Center on California Street near Maple Avenue, and an office complex called the 
"Park Beyond the Park" on Crenshaw Boulevard south of Carson Street. 
</P>
<P>
Neither site has sufficient parking for what court officials have in mind, City 
Council members said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent letter from the Crenshaw Boulevard site's owner requesting permission 
to lease 500 city parking spaces at Wilson Park infuriated the council. 
</P>
<P>
"I voted against that development in the first place. I thought it was too much 
for that area," Wirth said. "My attitude is, 'Forget them.' " 
</P>
<P>
Council members have asked city planners to draw up amendments to commercial 
and industrial zoning codes that will set a minimum number of parking spaces 
for courthouse uses on private property. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the control now, but give us a couple weeks," Walker said. "This 
is just one of those little cracks in our land use regulations that is being 
shored up as we speak." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Councilman George Nakano asked Mayor Katy Geissert to assign a 
council committee to oversee negotiations with the county. 
</P>
<P>
Nakano wants the committee to meet with county Supervisor Deane Dana and court 
administrators to hammer out a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
One solution might involve a swap of vacant city land next to the county 
courthouse complex for a 15,000-square-foot brick court annex building behind 
the existing courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Adding additional land to the court development would help reduce its lot 
coverage ratio, city officials said, while the city would get an existing 
building within its present Civic Center complex. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager LeRoy Jackson said no formal negotiations have begun about that 
possible exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford insists that the county wants to do as much as possible to incorporate 
the city's concerns into the final courthouse construction plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking, and we'll continue to talk. This plan isn't set in stone," he 
said. "At this point, erasers and pencils are cheap."

JURY FACILITIES 'WORST IN COUNTY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The air is stale, the carpet stained, the quarters cramped and the furniture 
strictly Los Angeles County issue. 
</P>
<P>
Comfort is a frill in the Torrance courthouse's jury assembly room, a second 
home each year for thousands of jurors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dump," Steve Schriekenof Carson said Monday, on the first day of his 
minimum 10-day service. "For someone to be here for 10 days. . . . The $5 a day 
(jury pay) you can keep, but at least it should be comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Courthouse officials are sympathetic to complaints. Jurors tell them regularly 
that they don't enjoy their time in the basement of the five-story Maple Avenue 
courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the worst facilities in the (county) system," concedes Lerol White, 
the courthouse's jury coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they hope to alleviate the problem temporarily by moving the 
jury room to more spacious quarters in a one-story annex building behind the 
main courthouse. But that will mean moving the county Probation Department and 
the South Bay Municipal Court's civil, small claims and juvenile traffic 
divisions out of the annex and into rented space in another building. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal for moving the jury room and the other facilities should be 
submitted to the county within two months, said South Bay Municipal Court 
administrator Christopher Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, jurors make do. 
</P>
<P>
There are not enough chairs to accommodate everyone when as many as 200 jurors 
are called on a Monday morning to serve the Municipal Court and the Torrance 
Superior Court. Some are left standing. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors spend much of their time waiting in the basement gathering area before 
they are called into one of the building's 19 courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
There is only one bathroom in the basement. It is just off a boiler room and is 
designated for men only. 
</P>
<P>
Women had a bathroom in the basement, but it had to be closed this year to 
ensure security in an adjacent room where Municipal Court employees count cash, 
White said. 
</P>
<P>
Recent juror Ula Roberts complained about the problem to court officials. "This 
is discrimination against women," she said in an interview. "I am talking about 
basic needs!" 
</P>
<P>
After complaints from Roberts and other jurors, the court agreed to open the 
basement bathroom, on request, to women. 
</P>
<P>
In an added effort the ease the problem, first-floor bathrooms that had been 
open to the public have now been fitted with locks and keys provided only to 
jurors. 
</P>
<P>
But jurors still complain about other problems: The air conditioning provides 
little relief in the overcrowded jury room. There are not enough desks for 
those who want to work while they're waiting. And smokers are relegated to a 
hallway. 
</P>
<P>
Several jurors said this week that the court employees have been attentive to 
their problems. Coordinator White permits jurors to leave the basement and sit 
in on trials, to ease the boredom a little. 
</P>
<P>
And White uses a sharp sense of humor to disarm the disgruntled. 
</P>
<P>
"We tell them, 'You're suffering through 10 days,' " White said. " 'But we're 
here for a lifetime.' "

THE TRAINS THAT COULDN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Union's promised era of reform threatens to become an era of 
material disaster. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plans to modernize the 
long-faltering economy, rather than providing Soviet consumers with a more 
comfortable life, have so far only produced a harsher one. Not for 30 years 
have state-run food stores had so few products on their shelves. Despite a 10% 
increase in investment in consumer goods, shortages of the most basic household 
items have become acute. Anything that is available is hoarded for future use 
or barter. Moscow is being swept by rumors of imminent food rationing. 
</P>
<P>
How could matters have become so bad? Among the few things not in short supply 
are plausible explanations. One is that recent steps to decentralize planning 
have thrust much of the burden of economic decision-making on inexperienced 
managers and bureaucrats, with predictably unhappy results. Another is that 
last summer's strikes and ethnic unrest continue to disrupt normal economic 
activity; among other things, coal is in short supply, possibly portending heat 
and electricity rationing this winter. Still another is that Soviet workers, 
seeing almost nothing to buy with the hundreds of billions of rubles they 
already hold, have no motivation to work harder or produce more. Finally, a 
major explanation is that the nation's distribution system is at a point of 
near-paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
Distribution has always been a weak link in the Soviet economy. The inadequacy 
of the country's road, railroad and storage systems is dramatized anew year 
after year as a significant percentage of the food the country's farmers 
produce rots before it can be delivered to consumers. Right now, according to 
railways minister Nikolai S. Konarev,25,000 fully laden freight cars are spread 
out across the country, stalled because freight yards are filled to capacity 
and key junctions are congested. One consequence is that enormous quantities of 
cargo are piling up at ports and on the country's western borders for lack of 
transport. Among the imports yet to move to market are 500,000 tons of potatoes 
from East Germany and Poland, 350,000 tons of wheat, and heavy tonnages of 
sugar, coffee, tea and rice, along with billions of dollars of non-food 
consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
Konarev has not hesitated to suggest that the rail tie-up may be due to 
"sabotage," a word heavy with political significance in Soviet history. In the 
1930s and '40s, failure to meet work norms, breakage of tools and equipment and 
the like was as often as not attributed to deliberate sabotage, and punishments 
were severe. Konarev has in mind political sabotage by conservative enemies of 
Gorbachev's restructuring program. As Times correspondent Michael Parks reports 
from Moscow, no one has felt compelled to dispute him. 
</P>
<P>
In another time, the shortages and the mood of despair they are fueling might 
well have been seen as precursors of violent upheaval. The current dismal 
situation seems to be producing something else. As Mikhail L. Berger, a 
respected economic commentator for the government newspaper Izvestia notes, he 
and many like him "don't have any trust any more, any faith that the government 
is going to get (us) out of this." The Soviet Union is experiencing a consumer 
crisis, but there is a deepening crisis of confidence as well, and in the long 
run that could be decisive in determining whether Gorbachev will be able to 
muster the popular support he must have if his hopes for major reform are to 
succeed.

SOVIET MILITARY SPENDING HAS INCREASED UNDER GORBACHEV, USAF SECRETARY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet military spending has increased slightly since Mikhail Gorbachev took 
power in 1985, despite his promises to cut back, Air Force Secretary Donald B. 
Rice said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rice told a gathering of the Los Angeles World Affairs Council that while the 
Soviets apparently have spent a bit more on defense during the last four years, 
U.S. defense spending and military aid to foreign nations has decreased 
significantly during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
"While Mr. Gorbachev has promised cuts, the U.S. has gone ahead and done it," 
the secretary told about 250 people at the luncheon gathering at the Biltmore 
in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Since he came to power, our defense budget -- adjusted for inflation -- has 
declined by 11%," Rice said. "The Air Force, like the other services, feels the 
pinch." 
</P>
<P>
Before he became Air Force secretary under President Bush, Rice was president 
and chief executive officer of the RAND Corp. and previously held posts in the 
federal Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
He also is a former director of the Los Angeles World Affairs Council, a 
nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that serves as a forum for the discussion 
of international issues. 
</P>
<P>
Rice said Air Force actions since 1985 have included cutting more than 30,000 
personnel, delaying production of the B-2 Stealth bomber, deactivating the B-52 
squadron, cutting Peacemaker missile deployment from 100 to 50 operational 
missiles and starting the withdrawal of ground-launched Cruise missiles from 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"What have the Soviets done in terms of decreasing their budget and force 
structure?" Rice asked. "While they've said they'll cut back, the fact is 
Soviet outlays for defense increased by an average of 3% per year in real terms 
since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.S.R. has said 1989 spending will be less than 2% below 1988 spending," 
he said. "Even if Gorbachev reduced military spending by 14% by the end of 
1991, that would only about equal the amount he increased spending during the 
1985-88 period."

TORRANCE MAN, 18, PLEADS GUILTY IN CARSON SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Torrance youth has pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for shooting a 
Carson man to death in the back of his van last June. 
</P>
<P>
Felipe Antonio Cruz Jr., 18, faces from 17 years to life in prison when he is 
sentenced Nov. 13 by Torrance Superior Court Judge William Hollingsworth. He 
made his guilty plea Monday. 
</P>

HOTELIER FINED $175,000 FOR FAILURE TO PAY TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The operator of the Radisson Plaza Hotel &amp; Golf Course in Manhattan Beach 
was fined and ordered to pay restitution of $175,000 after pleading no contest 
this week to charges that he failed to pay the state thousands of dollars in 
taxes deducted from employees' paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
By entering the plea Monday in South Bay Municipal Court, hotelier Horst 
Osterkamp avoided a possible jail sentence for not forwarding $127,000 in 
disability insurance and income taxes to the state, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Peter Burke. 
</P>
<P>
Osterkamp has already turned over a check for more than $94,000 for the back 
taxes and agreed to pay the remaining $33,000. Judge Gary Daigh also placed 
Osterkamp on probation for one year and fined him $48,000. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor dismissed three related misdemeanor charges in exchange for 
Osterkamp's no-contest plea for having kept tax money that he collected in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
The hotelier and his lawyer did not return several telephone calls this week. 
</P>
<P>
Osterkamp is president of US Hotel Properties, which operates the 364-room 
Radisson and a dozen other American hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The Manhattan Beach hotel has been beset by such a variety of problems that its 
owners -- a partnership headed by the investment firm of Shearson Lehman Hutton 
Inc. -- has considered hiring a new management firm. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Local 814 has been 
attempting to negotiate higher wages and improved benefits for 275 maids, 
cashiers and waiters at the hotel. The union has called on the hotel's owners 
to throw out Osterkamp. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1988, the company that runs the Radisson's restaurants and bars 
filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy 
code. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Osterkamp pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge in a similar 
case: He failed to pay an 8 1/2% bed tax to Manhattan Beach. Manhattan Beach 
Finance Director Merle Lundberg said this week that Osterkamp owes $117,000, 
but that he has consistently been paying the past-due taxes.

CHARGERS READYING TOLLIVER FOR START AGAINST SEAHAWKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Billy Joe Tolliver got the good news Wednesday morning, and he wasn't 
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"I had hints," said Tolliver, the Chargers' rookie quarterback from Texas Tech. 
"I read the papers. I'm not like some guys. I spend a quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Henning ended two days of speculation when he named Tolliver to 
replace Jim McMahon for the Chargers against the Seahawks Sunday in Seattle. 
Tolliver, activated last week after spending the first six weeks of the season 
on injured reserve with a broken collarbone, will be making his regular season 
debut in the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
Henning announced Tolliver's promotion with a somewhat cryptic statement that 
left the door slightly open for him to change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"We're practicing Tolliver to get him ready to start," Henning said. "If I 
think he's ready to start, he will. If I don't, we'll start McMahon, but I have 
a feeling we'll start Tolliver and try to keep the situation status quo and get 
a little better. If that's not the case, we'll go back to McMahon." 
</P>
<P>
McMahon has a sore left shoulder and has been ineffective in recent games, but 
Henning wouldn't say whether either factor had led to the decision to start 
Tolliver. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he had made the change, Henning said, "Because I think it's prudent 
at this time to see what Billy Joe can do. Our collective group of offensive 
players have not been as productive as we'd like them to be." 
</P>
<P>
Veteran David Archer had been the No. 2 all season. Asked why he had been 
bypassed, Henning said, "That's a question I decided to think about and won't 
discuss with anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if this meant he hadn't consulted Ted Tollner, the quarterbacks coach, 
about the change, Henning said, "I consult with all of my position coaches 
about such matters." 
</P>
<P>
Pressed at that point to explain his statement about Archer, the coach said, "I 
will decide that answer within myself." 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver, who didn't work out with the team until a week ago, said, "I know 
it's not going to be easy, but I'd like to know where my career is at. I have a 
good feeling. I like my chances of doing well." 
</P>
<P>
Henning's original plan was to bring Tolliver along slowly, but with McMahon 
struggling and the Chargers in the AFC West cellar at 2-5, he advanced his 
timetable. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just something that happened," Tolliver said. "I'm not going to go crazy 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some feelings going around as far as other guys wanting to play. You 
know Jim. He wants to be in there, and if he was healthy, he would be. David 
wants to play, too, but what am I going to do? If they tell me to play, I'll 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's not paint a different picture here. If I stink the joint up, they won't 
hesitate to put in somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver took all but seven snaps in Wednesday's workout. McMahon took the 
remainder, and Archer watched. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Tolliver said, "My timing was all right, and my arm felt good. 
However, there were three plays I blew by translating signals wrong." 
</P>
<P>
A disappointed Archer said, "It doesn't say that much for me, that's for sure. 
I've just got to try to help Billy Joe the best I can." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he now considered himself No. 3, Archer said, "That's the way it 
looks. But they're the decision-makers, and I'm the player." 
</P>
<P>
McMahon didn't want to talk about it. His brief press conference went this way: 
</P>
<P>
Question: There are indications of a change at quarterback. Are you receptive? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I just do what they tell me, man. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you have any opinion on it? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you feel that you need a rest? 
</P>
<P>
A: I just do what they tell me. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do you gauge the way you have played? 
</P>
<P>
A: Just pretend I snuck out. I didn't even see you here. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Well, how would you gauge the way you have played? 
</P>
<P>
A: Just pretend I snuck out. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do you feel about the possibility of being taken out of the lineup? 
</P>
<P>
A: I feel like it's lunch time. 
</P>
<P>
Q: This is Wednesday. Isn't this the day you're supposed to talk? 
</P>
<P>
A: You've got everything out of me you're going to get. 
</P>
<P>
With that, McMahon picked up the attache case in which he carries his lunch and 
walked away. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Running back Dana Brinson was omitted from the Chargers' injury report despite 
the fact that he missed last Sunday's game and still has a right shoulder that 
is so sore he left Wednesday's workout early. The list included H-back Rod 
Bernstine (knee), doubtful; offensive tackle Joel Patten (knee and back), 
questionable, and quarterback Jim McMahon (shoulder), running back Marion Butts 
(knee), linebacker Jim Collins (back) and defensive end Burt Grossman (knee), 
probable. Two others were hurt after the list was turned in -- cornerback Sammy 
Seale (shoulder) and offensive tackle Joey Howard (ankle). . . . The Seahawks 
listed four players as probable -- offensive tackle Ron Mattes (thigh), 
linebacker M.L. Johnson (eye), linebacker Darrin Miller (back) and linebacker 
Tony Woods (leg). . . . Charger offensive tackle Brett Miller is a new father. 
His wife, Gailyn, gave birth Monday to a seven-pound girl, Giana Lynette. 
Quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver said of Miller, "He was shining so bright after 
that baby was born that I didn't see anything else on the right side of the 
line."

PASSERS PAID AFTER WILSON CHOSE TO STAY; 
</P>
<P>
AZTECS: INJURIES, CHANGES AND THE BANISHMENT OF A FRIEND MADE MILT WILSON MAD, 
AND OPPOSING QUARTERBACKS CAN TELL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURT HOLBREICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Milt Wilson battled injuries. He adjusted to the many position switches. He 
endured losing. He watched as his coach was fired. 
</P>
<P>
Each setback angered him. At first, he fought the changes, but he eventually 
yielded to authority. He came to understand that upheavals were part of being a 
member of the San Diego State football team, a program in which success one 
year turned into turmoil the next. 
</P>
<P>
Then last spring, an action was taken that Wilson could not accept. His friend 
and roommate, free safety Lyndon Earley, was dismissed for disciplinary 
reasons. Wilson's anger grew. This was different. This was not about him; it 
was about his friend. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard for me to deal with," said Wilson, a senior defensive tackle. "I 
was on the verge of telling them I was leaving, too." 
</P>
<P>
But Earley advised him to stay. He did not force Wilson to choose between 
friendship and football. He did not want to see his hardship ruin Wilson's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"I respect him for that," Wilson said. "He didn't ask me whose side was I on. 
He told me to do what I have to do, and that's what I did." 
</P>
<P>
That difficult decision is now being rewarded. Despite breaking his left hand 
before the fourth game against Utah, Wilson has become the Aztecs' sack 
specialist. Of his 11 tackles, seven are sacks and another is for a loss. Last 
Saturday in a 35-7 nonconference victory over Pacific, Wilson had a season-high 
three sacks. He is ranked third in the Western Athletic Conference in that 
category entering the Aztecs' game Saturday night at Texas El Paso (2-6, 1-3 in 
WAC). 
</P>
<P>
His specialized role has given Wilson extra incentive every time he takes the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
"All I think about is getting to the passer," Wilson said. "My whole thing is 
that if I don't get to the quarterback, I at least want to be far enough 
upfield to let him know I was there. I want to be able to whisper in his ear, 
to let him know I was there, and that I will get him before the night is over." 
</P>
<P>
Yet while he sounds enthusiastic about his role as a pass-rush specialist, it 
is not one he accepted readily. Wilson wants to be an every-down player. The 
concept of playing only on likely passing downs strikes him as an insult. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't plan it this way," Wilson said. "I didn't want to be a pass-rusher. I 
wanted to be in all the time." 
</P>
<P>
But the coaches are firm in their decision that Wilson can be best utilized in 
his limited role. 
</P>
<P>
Although one of the strongest and quickest players on the line, Wilson was 
judged too small to play against larger offensive linemen against the run. 
Wilson, 6-feet-2 and 245 pounds, plays mainly nose tackle when the Aztecs use a 
five-man front in their "Bear defense" package. 
</P>
<P>
"His body type lends itself to rushing the passer as opposed to standing in 
there on run block," said Ed Schmidt, the defensive line coach. "I don't know 
what he likes to play. I just know what he is good at. And playing inside, 
rushing the passer, is where he has excelled." 
</P>
<P>
The move to sack specialist is the latest adjustment in a college career marked 
by numerous changes. They began the day Wilson reported as a freshman out of 
Daniel Murphy High School in Los Angeles. Recruited as a defensive 
end/linebacker, Wilson was switched to fullback because of a shortage at that 
position. That accounts for Wilson wearing No. 33, unusual for a defensive 
lineman. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson's time on offense was brief. Soon he was playing defensive end and 
contributing to the 1986 WAC championship season. He recovered a fumble for a 
touchdown in a 38-34 victory at New Mexico and recovered an Iowa fumble in the 
Holiday Bowl that set up the Aztecs' first touchdown in 39-38 loss. 
</P>
<P>
That was only the beginning of the changes for Wilson. He began his sophomore 
season at defensive end, but after the Aztec defense was embarrassed in a 47-14 
loss at UCLA, Wilson was moved inside to tackle. It meant Wilson would make his 
first college start against Air Force, but that did not make him happy. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really upset about that," Wilson said. "I didn't figure I was heavy 
enough to play inside. I wanted to play outside, where I could use my speed. 
But I didn't have a say in it. It was up to the head man (Denny Stolz), and he 
wanted me to play tackle." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his initial resistance, Wilson learned to play his new position and 
again was successful. He recorded eight sacks in the final seven games of 1987 
to place second on the team in that category, and finished with 74 tackles. But 
no sooner did Wilson become comfortable in his latest role than he was moved 
again, this time to linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
The switch during spring practice in 1988 was only the start of what would be a 
frustrating junior season for Wilson. He never knew where he would play next. 
</P>
<P>
"It got maddening at times," Wilson said. "I would actually come to practice 
and the other players would know before me. 'Oh, you're playing linebacker this 
week, huh,' they would say. I just laughed. The next I know I have something in 
my locker to see the coach. He would tell me the change. It was real hard." 
</P>
<P>
The changes were part of the struggles in a season that ended in a 3-8 record 
and resulted in the dismissal of Stolz. 
</P>
<P>
"We really did an unjustice to him because we never let him concentrate on one 
position," said Schmidt, a holdover from Stolz's staff. "He went from 
linebacker to nose tackle to tackle to end. He went everywhere except defensive 
back, and that is just not fair to do to a guy." 
</P>
<P>
Position changes were only part of Wilson's problem. He severely sprained his 
right ankle in the second game against Air Force. He missed several games and 
finished the season with only 16 tackles and one sack. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he was not at full strength until the final game at New Mexico. By 
then, Stolz had been told he was fired. That meant more adjustments and, 
ultimately, the dismissal of Earley, the team's leading tackler in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he reacted emotionally at first to the loss of Earley. He lashed 
out at the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just mad, and the coaches couldn't understand that," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches wondered if his association with Earley would affect Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"When you live with a guy who is dismissed from the team, you have to go home 
and listen to it every night," Schmidt said. "Milt really showed me that he is 
a mature man because he knows what is best for him and his situation. Even 
though he loves Lyndon like a brother, there comes a point where you say what 
is best for me, and that is what he did. That would be hard for me; I know it 
was hard for him." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said Earley's support during that time tightened their bonds of 
friendship. If they could not stay teammates, they would remain roommates. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I get a sack, just like when were playing, he still gives me a big 
hug," Wilson said. "If I get home from a game and go to sleep before he gets 
home, he wakes me up to tell me good job. To see him not there at practice now 
when I know he should be really hurts. But he wanted me to do what was best for 
me, and that is what I did. I know he understands." 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State quarterback Dan McGwire resumed throwing in practice Wednesday 
after resting his sore right elbow Tuesday. . . . Terrill Steen, a freshman 
from St. Bernard High School, has received extensive practice time at 
linebacker this week because of injuries to Thane Fisher (hand), Sai Niu 
(ankle) and Eric Thompson (shoulder). But Coach Al Luginbill said he would 
prefer not to play Steen against Texas El Paso Saturday because he wants to 
red-shirt him. . . . The Holiday Bowl will send scouts to watch nine teams 
Saturday: Arizona (5-2), Washington State (6-2), USC (5-2), Washington (4-3), 
Illinois (5-1), Minnesota (4-2), Ohio State (4-2), Alabama (6-0) and Penn State 
(5-1). The bowl, to be held December 29 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, will 
pair the Western Athletic Conference champion against an at-large opponent. 
Teams cannot officially be invited to a bowl until November 25.

MORNING BRIEFING: DITKA MAY BE TURNING INTO A BIG TEDDY BEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only two weeks ago, Chicago Bear Coach Mike Ditka was almost in a rage when he 
said he doubted that his team could win another game. But after three 
consecutive losses, Ditka apparently has decided to change his tune with the 
Rams (5-2) coming to town Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears (4-3) are one game behind the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Central 
Division, where they are seeking a sixth consecutive championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Fellas, with three losses you can dance into the playoffs backward," Ditka 
said at his weekly news conference. "You can win your division backward with 
three losses. Four losses will get you into the playoffs, maybe even five. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I think we can go undefeated the rest of the way? Yes. It's possible, but 
it will be tough. 
</P>
<P>
"These are my players; I drafted them and if they don't win, it's my fault," 
Ditka said. "I take full blame for it. When you take enough blame, then 
'peeeeng,' you're gone." 
</P>
<P>
Add Ditka: If his club could play every game against the man Ditka loves to 
hate, Coach Buddy Ryan of the Philadelphia Eagles, the Bears might go 
undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ryan after having been beaten by Ditka for the fourth consecutive time 
since Ryan quit as a Bear assistant in 1986: "You can't lose to anybody this 
many times and stay in this business very long." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ditka after the victory: "These guys, they come in here and they think 
they can talk their way into (winning) the game. It's unbelievable, and it all 
comes from the fat man (Ryan)." 
</P>
<P>
Ditka said his only regret was not having more time to savor victories over 
Ryan. "Every time it happens, I'll savor it more. It's nine times better than 
beating a (former Coach Tom) Landry team." 
</P>
<P>
Last add Ditka: The entire Tampa Bay offensive unit won the National Football 
League's player-of-the-week award after the Buccaneers beat the Bears. Said 
Ditka: "My football team knows what I thought about that. They won't be player 
of the week next time we play." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who was the last player-manager to appear in and win a World 
Series game? 
</P>
<P>
Moving experience: Defenseman Mark Hardy, who spent nine seasons with the 
Kings, was traded by the New York Rangers to the Minnesota North Stars in June, 
1988, and reacquired six months later. Helene Elliott of Newsday quotes Hardy 
on why he is renting in New York rather than buying a house: "When I went to 
Minnesota, I thought I'd be there a few years . . . so I went out and bought a 
house. It cost me $20,000 to get traded. I don't want that to happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Lou Boudreau, who played shortstop for the Cleveland Indians as 
they won the 1948 Series from the Boston Braves in six games. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Phoenix Sun Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons, on the Lakers after the 
retirement of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: "It's been Magic's team for a long time. As 
long as Magic is breathing, you have the Lakers to beat." GARR KLUENDER

LEMIEUX, PENGUINS STRUGGLE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the last two seasons, Mario Lemieux has been the National Hockey League 
scoring champion and has been voted by his peers as the league's best player. 
</P>
<P>
Last season the powerful center, in his fifth year, finally led the Pittsburgh 
Penguins into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Lemieux, 25, was supposed to remove any doubt regarding his 
superiority over Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the 6-foot-4, 200-pounder has been mired in a slump. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux ended a two-game scoreless string with an assist Wednesday night at 
Pittsburgh, but it was not enough to keep the Penguins from losing again. 
Daniel Marois scored the tiebreaking goal with two minutes left and the Toronto 
Maple Leafs won, 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
With Lemieux scoring 15 goals and accumulating 33 points, the Penguins were 6-3 
at this stage last season. This season, they are 3-5-1, and Lemieux has only 
four goals and 15 points. He has a simple explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the player I was a year ago," he told the Associated Press. "I'm not 
playing like I did then. It seems that I'm a step behind all the time and I 
don't have the jump I had last year. With the season almost a month old, it's 
beginning to get serious." 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 2, Quebec 0 -- After a decade as one of the best goaltenders in 
hockey, Mike Liut slipped last season. Bothered by nagging injuries, he played 
in only 35 games and had a high goals-against average of 4.25. 
</P>
<P>
Injury-free again, Liut, 33, is off to a brilliant start. By stopping all 22 of 
the Nordiques' shots at Hartford, Conn., Liut improved his league-leading 
goals-against average to 1.81. 
</P>
<P>
It was his 21st shutout, tops among active goaltenders, but his first in almost 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've ever played a stretch in which I had such support in front 
of me," Liut said. 
</P>
<P>
Six of Liut's saves, including three spectacular ones, were against Hall of 
Famer Guy Lafleur. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Babych and Pat Verbeek scored first-period goals to give Liut all the 
support he needed. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 3, New York Rangers 3 -- The way things have been going for the Oilers 
lately, ties on the road against both New York teams represents a good trip. 
</P>
<P>
For the second night in a row, Jari Kurri rallied the Oilers in the closing 
moments to get the tie. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night at Uniondale, he scored a goal and assisted on another as the 
Oilers wiped out a two-goal deficit. In this one, the high-scoring wing got the 
puck in a scramble in front of the net and scored his seventh goal with 4:14 
left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 4, Buffalo 2 -- Defenseman Larry Murphy scored his first goal of the 
season 17 seconds after Soviet Alexander Mogilny tied the score for the Sabres 
in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, who leads the North Stars with 11 assists, enabled his team to remain 
perfect at home (4-0-0). 
</P>
<P>
Mogilny's goal, his first in the NHL, came at 1:25 of the final period. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg 6, Washington 4 -- Dale Hawerchuk scored a goal and assisted on two 
others at Winnipeg to lead the Jets to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Ellett scored the go-ahead goal on a power play halfway through the final 
period, then set up an empty-net goal in the final seconds by Greg Paslawski.

ST. GENEVIEVE COACH, PLAYER SUSPENDED FOR ROLE IN BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
St. Genevieve High football Coach Mark Lovett sat down to watch a videotape 
Wednesday afternoon, and he did not like what he saw. Lovett, in fact, issued a 
scathing review, suspending a player and an assistant coach for their part in a 
brawl during Friday's loss to Chaminade. 
</P>
<P>
Lovett, a first-year coach, suspended a player for two games and an assistant 
for one game in connection with a sideline-clearing fight that took place in 
Chaminade's 45-6 San Fernando Valley League victory. 
</P>
<P>
A second player and another assistant were reprimanded by Lovett, who issued 
word of the punishment through a statement released by the St. Genevieve 
athletic department. None of players or coaches involved were identified. 
</P>
<P>
With Chaminade leading, 45-0, a fight erupted after Chaminade's Felix Goodson 
was leveled by Roel Navarro, who was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct. 
Goodson, who waved for a fair catch as one of the deep men on the punt-return 
team, allowed the ball to land untouched several yards away but was decked 
nonetheless, according to Chaminade Coach Rich Lawson. 
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Lovett said that he was "accepting responsibility for the 
behavior of my assistant coaches and my players only." Lovett did not return 
phone calls Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
No Chaminade players have been disciplined in connection with the fight, Lawson 
said, nor have any been suspended from school. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson, who provided Lovett with the videotape that was used to view the fight, 
said he was glad to see that the matter has been settled, but he had mixed 
feelings about the suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm certainly not gratified that a kid will miss a couple of football games," 
Lawson said. "It's just unfortunate that emotions got to the point where they 
did."

EL SEGUNDO JUGGLES LINEUP AND BECOMES A PLAYOFF CONTENDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because of injuries and personnel adjustments, high school football teams 
usually are in a state of constant change. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is that more evident this season than at El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Since the opening game, when starting tailback Don Smith was lost for the year 
with a broken leg, the Eagles have been forced to adjust their lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Initially it was a problem. But, judging by the team's success in recent weeks, 
Coach Steve Newell and his staff deserve credit for pushing the right buttons. 
</P>
<P>
After starting dismally with four straight losses, El Segundo has won its last 
three games to occupy second place in the eight-team Santa Fe League with a 3-1 
record, one game behind St.Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely have turned things around," Newell said. "We got off to a slow 
start. We had some young kids on the team that we needed to bring around, and I 
think we had problems as a coaching staff zeroing in on priorities. Once we 
started making those adjustments, we started winning." 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo's most effective adjustments have come on defense. The Eagles gave 
up 129 points in their first four games but have held opponents to 27 in their 
last three outings. 
</P>
<P>
Newell credits four players, in particular, with helping turn things around on 
defense: sophomore twins Eric and Eran Taulua, junior Tom Frechette and senior 
Ken Talanoa. 
</P>
<P>
Three have switched positions since the start of the season. Eric Taulua 
(6-foot, 240 pounds) was moved from tackle to outside linebacker, Frechette 
(6-4, 240) was moved from tackle to defensive end and Talanoa (6-4, 225) was 
moved from inside linebacker to defensive end. Eran Taulua (6-0, 215), who did 
not play until the third game because of an off-season hip injury, starts at 
outside linebacker opposite his brother. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought going into the season we had strong enough kids on the outside to 
do the job," Newell said. "But we found out we were weak there, and it forced 
us to make the changes. I always figure you have to protect yourself on the 
outside first." 
</P>
<P>
The Tauluas, who were not listed as starters before the season, have emerged as 
stars. They were a two-man gang in last week's 21-20 victory over Cathedral. 
Eric rushed for 43 yards and one touchdown, made eight tackles, intercepted two 
passes and recovered two fumbles, while Eran rushed for 62 yards and one 
touchdown and had five tackles and a sack. 
</P>
<P>
"They are real good now," Newell said. "I can't imagine how good they are going 
to be over the next two years." 
</P>
<P>
The twins' play at running back has helped compensate for the loss of starting 
tailback Garret Quaintance. The team's leading rusher suffered an injured foot 
in a 17-7 win over Mary Star two weeks ago and is not expected back in the 
lineup until Nov. 3 against Cantwell. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo, which lost its league opener to St. Monica, 39-30, on Sept. 29 with 
the Tauluas and Talanoa on the bench because of disciplinary reasons, resumes 
league play at 1:45 p.m. Saturday at Pater Noster (3-4, 1-3). 
</P>
<P>
"If this team stays on track, it has the opportunity to get to the playoffs," 
Newell said. "From there, maybe we can surprise some people." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of El Segundo's adjustments have been easy for Newell. 
</P>
<P>
After a 44-7 loss to Garey in the third game, he switched quarterbacks by 
replacing his son, Brett, in favor of Tom Cover. Brett is now a starting wide 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, the move created an awkward situation in the Newell home. 
</P>
<P>
"It definitely was a tough decision," Coach Newell said. "I would say there 
were some hard feelings." 
</P>
<P>
Gardena football Coach Mike Sakurai, whose team has lost to Carson and Serra, 
was asked who he would favor in a meeting between The Times' top-ranked South 
Bay teams. 
</P>
<P>
Carson routed the Mohicans, 40-6, and Serra beat them, 36-13. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be a good game," Sakurai said. "Speed-wise, Serra is right up 
there. But Carson is probably a little better overall. The physical game that 
Carson plays would probably present a problem for Serra." 
</P>
<P>
The debate can't be settled on the field this year because the teams play in 
different sections. But a future non-league meeting is a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Carson Coach Gene Vollnogle, whose team was idle the third week of the season 
because it could not fill its non-league schedule, might have better luck 
arranging a game with Serra. After all, the Cavaliers' first-year coach, Leo 
Hand, is accustomed to playing highly rated teams from his four years as 
Servite's head coach. 
</P>
<P>
It's do-or-die time for Bishop Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights entered Angelus League play two weeks ago with high hopes of 
qualifying for the football playoffs for the first time from the league. But 
after losses to Bishop Amat and Servite, they find themselves 0-2 and in a 
must-win situation against visiting Mater Dei (1-1) on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery Coach Steve Carroll said he was "very disappointed" by his 
team's performance Saturday in a 35-13 loss to Servite. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Servite was a team we could beat, but we came out and played real 
flat," he said. "To play football in the Angelus League, you have to be ready 
every week." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said the Knights have several personnel changes, mostly on the 
offensive line, planned for Friday's game. 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES -- Unbeaten Mira Costa retained its No. 1 ranking in the State 
CIF/Coaches girls volleyball poll. The Mustangs, ranked No. 1 in the nation by 
several publications, are followed in the state rankings by Corona del Mar, 
Santa Barbara, Laguna Beach and Poway . . . Miraleste (3-1), which is a 
half-game behind co-leaders Valley Christian (3-0) and Whittier Christian (3-0) 
in the Olympic League football race, plays at Valley Christian on Friday night 
. . . Miraleste's water polo team, ranked No. 3 in the Southern Section 2-A 
Division coaches poll, defeated No. 8 Mira Costa, 9-8, Tuesday in an Ocean 
League game at Mira Costa. Kyle Hildebrand scored three goals for Miraleste, 
which remained in first place with a 5-0 league record. Mira Costa, which got 
three goals from Mike Mullen, fell to 3-2 . . . Carson junior Steve Gonzales 
set a cross-country course record Monday at Peck Park in San Pedro by covering 
the 2.9-mile trail in 14 minutes, 46 seconds . . . Torrance, led by Israel 
Pose, has risen to No. 6 in the 4-A Division boys cross-country poll . . . 
Carson basketball Coach Richard Masson said an exhibition game scheduled 
between the Colts and the Korean Junior National team Nov. 2 at Carson has been 
canceled because the Koreans could not raise enough money to make the trip.

FULL HOUSE BACKFIELD PAYS OFF; 
</P>
<P>
SERRA HIGH'S SPEEDSTERS RACK UP 40 TOUCHDOWNS IN SEVEN GAMES; 
</P>
<P>
PREPS: COACH LEO HAND HAS ONLY ONE FAVORITE PLAY, THE PITCH. THAT'S WHERE HIS 
PLAYER PITCHES THE BALL TO THE REFEREE AFTER CROSSING THE GOAL LINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Leo Hand became head football coach at Serra High School last spring, he 
explained his offensive philosophy in simple terms. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the players I only have one favorite play in football, and that's the 
pitch play," he said. "That's where the guy crosses the goal line and pitches 
the ball to the referee." 
</P>
<P>
Hand stole the line from former USC Coach John McKay, but it applies to Serra 
perhaps more than it ever did to the Trojans. Through seven games this season, 
the Cavaliers have crossed the goal line 40 times, an average of 5.7 touchdowns 
per game. 
</P>
<P>
Serra's speedy full-house backfield of quarterback Fred Safford, fullback 
Dennis Gerard and halfbacks Lamont Daniel and Jerald Henry have done the bulk 
of the scoring, accounting for 36 touchdowns -- all on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
This is a team that likes to run. And run. And run. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll run until someone stops the run," Safford said, matter-of-factly. "Then 
we'll pass. But ain't no one stopped the run yet." 
</P>
<P>
Serra's team statistics support Safford. The Cavaliers lead the South Bay in 
rushing with 2,104 yards, an average of 301 per game, and they are last in 
passing with 220 yards, an average of 31 per game. In last Friday's 52-6 win 
over St. Anthony, the Cavaliers rushed for 355 yards and attempted two passes, 
both incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the lack of a passing attack hasn't hurt. Serra (7-0 overall, 2-0 in 
the Camino Real League) has outscored its opponents, 276-39, and is ranked No. 
2 behind Lompoc in the Southern Section Division VII poll. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers figure to add to their lopsided stats Friday night when they 
visit hapless Pius X of Downey (0-7, 0-2) in a Camino Real League game. 
</P>
<P>
All four members of Serra's full-house backfield credit team unity for their 
impressive start. There is no jealousy among the stars. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to play as a team and not individually," Safford said. "We act as a 
family. It's not just going out there and saying, 'I'm going to get mine, I 
hope you get yours.' It's more of a team concept." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gerard, who leads the team with 18 touchdowns: "I think the fact that our 
line works hard, both in practice and in the games, and the defense holds the 
other teams to few scores makes it easy on us." 
</P>
<P>
The diminutive members of the backfield -- all four starters are 5-foot-9 or 
shorter -- also give a great deal of credit to Hand and his 22 years of 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
Before he arrived at Serra, Hand intended to run an I formation. But once he 
got to the Gardena school, he realized he had too many talented tailbacks to 
limit the offense to just one starter. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something I decided to do with these particular athletes," he said of 
the full-house T offense. "We wanted to utilize as many (tailbacks) as we 
possibly could. Right now, we've got three of them in there." 
</P>
<P>
That would be Henry and Daniel, the team's halfbacks, and Safford, who is 
basically a tailback playing quarterback. Together with Gerard, a powerful 
runner who can bench press 325 pounds, the backfield gives opposing defenses 
plenty to be concerned about. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't focus on one guy," said Gardena Coach Mike Sakurai, whose team lost 
to the Cavaliers, 36-13, on Sept. 22. "You can't get caught up looking into the 
backfield because they run a lot of misdirection. They can attack you at 
different places with all the speed they have." 
</P>
<P>
Hand learned the full-house T from Taft College Coach Al Baldock and used it 
off-and-on during his four years as head coach at Servite High in Anaheim. He 
described it as "sequence football." The formation consists of three running 
backs, two wide receivers and no tight end. 
</P>
<P>
"All the plays are tied together," Hand said. "We start with the basic play, 
which is running Dennis (Gerard) off tackle. Then we draw up all the different 
defenses in football. We figure out every way teams can stop it. 
</P>
<P>
"When they do the things they need to do to stop Dennis, then they have left 
themselves vulnerable in some other area. And it's my job to find that out." 
</P>
<P>
In last week's win over St. Anthony, Serra used Gerard mostly as a decoy during 
the first quarter and had success running the ball wide to Daniel and Henry. 
After building a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, the Cavaliers went to Gerard 
on the first play of the second quarter and the fullback busted loose for a 
65-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
After just 10 offensive plays, Serra had built a 22-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Gerard, a 5-9, 190-pound senior who lives in Carson, said Serra's ability to 
run at will has a demoralizing effect on opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"After a while, no one wants to tackle us head-on," he said. "They go for the 
legs. Pasadena came out fired up against us. But it got to the point where we 
were coming at them so hard, they didn't want to hit us any more. They would 
just step to the side and make a soft tackle. Then they stopped talking." 
</P>
<P>
Serra silenced Pasadena, 40-0, in its opener. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hand will not release individual statistics until after the season in 
order to maintain his philosophy of "team before player," the coach said Gerard 
surpassed the 1,000-yard mark last week. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the backfield starters also have been productive. 
</P>
<P>
Safford, a 5-6, 155-pound senior from Inglewood, has seven touchdowns. Henry 
(5-8, 170), a junior from Carson whose older brother John was an All-Camino 
Real League running back at Verbum Dei last year, has eight TDs. And Daniel 
(5-8, 152), a senior who has run the 100 meters in 10.9 seconds, has three TDs. 
</P>
<P>
To a man, the backs say they are on a mission to reach the Division VII 
championship game. Serra's only previous appearance in a Southern Section final 
was in 1980, a team the present group is frequently compared with. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Cavaliers reached the second round of the playoffs after 
capturing their third consecutive Camino Real League title. A win over rival 
Verbum Dei on Nov. 2 will make it four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to go out in style," Gerard said. "With rings on our fingers and 
shirts and jackets." 
</P>
<P>
If Serra keeps playing the way it has, the football team may well be the 
best-dressed group on campus come December.

LEAGUES WILL HAVE A NEW LOOK FOR '90-92 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Segundo High received a last-minute reprieve Monday when the school was 
switched from the Camino Real League to the San Fernando Valley League for the 
proposed 1990-92 releaguing cycle in the CIF-Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
Late changes in the section's Catholic leagues were caused by the placement of 
Santa Margarita in a yet-to-be-named league that will include, among other 
schools, Bishop Amat, Mater Dei, Loyola and Servite. There had been a holdup in 
the placement of Santa Margarita, a three-year-old school in southeastern 
Orange County, because of a series of bureaucratic rulings. 
</P>
<P>
The changes were welcomed by El Segundo, which was not looking forward to 
competing in basketball and baseball in the Camino Real League. Athletic 
Director John Stevenson said it would have been inequitable for the Eagles, who 
have not won a league title in basketball since 1967, to compete against 
traditionally strong teams such as Serra, St. Anthony and Verbum Dei. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Stevenson said El Segundo's powerful baseball team would have faced 
limited competition in a Camino Real League that will lose St. Bernard and 
Bosco Tech, its chief competitors last season, to other leagues in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new configuration, El Segundo will be grouped with Bell-Jeff of 
Burbank, St. Genevieve of Panorama City, Harvard of North Hollywood, La Salle 
of Pasadena, Louisville of Woodland Hills, Flintridge Prep and St. Francis of 
La Canada in the San Fernando Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
"We're satisfied with that," Stevenson said. "We voted to approve it." 
</P>
<P>
The new league will mean longer trips for the Eagles, but Stevenson said it was 
a small price to pay for a more balanced league. 
</P>
<P>
"We've become accustomed to driving," he said. "We're willing to travel to have 
a competitive situation for our athletes." 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo, which joined the Southern Section's Parochial Area in 1988, has 
competed in the Santa Fe League in football and basketball and in the Camino 
Real League in most other sports for the last two years. However, the Santa Fe 
League voted not to allow El Segundo to return for basketball in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
With a declining enrollment of approximately 600 students, El Segundo joined 
the Parochial Area after finding it increasingly difficult to compete with 
larger public high schools in the Coast Area. 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste, another school facing declining enrollment, has been moved from the 
Private Area to the Parochial Area for the 1990-92 releaguing cycle and will 
compete in the Camino Real League. That is, if the school remains open in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he expects Miraleste to close before next fall, Athletic Director Tom 
Graves said: "That's a good possibility. Everyone at our league meetings asks 
that question. I really don't have any answers." 
</P>
<P>
Graves said a clearer picture of Miraleste's future should come after the Nov. 
7 school board elections. 
</P>
<P>
If Miraleste does stay open, Graves said the Marauders will have trouble 
competing in the Camino Real League in football and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a good situation for us," he said. "Football-wise, we're going to 
have trouble playing teams like Serra and Verbum Dei with our 625 students. In 
basketball, it's even uglier." 
</P>
<P>
Graves said Miraleste, which has already lost two appeals, will try to change 
leagues again. Schools must contact the Southern Section office by Nov. 28 to 
initiate an appeal. Appeals will then be heard on Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990-92 releaguing cycle will also see the return of the Pioneer League in 
the South Bay. The league was disbanded for the 1988-90 cycle, as the area's 
public high schools went from three six-team leagues (Bay, Ocean and Pioneer) 
to two eight-team leagues (Bay and Ocean). Miraleste was not included because 
it originally was expected to close in 1988, and El Segundo moved to the 
Parochial Area. 
</P>
<P>
The new Pioneer League will bring together the four Torrance high schools 
(South, West, North and Torrance) and Centennial. South, West and North have 
competed in the Ocean League for the last two years, while Torrance has been a 
member of the Bay League.

<P>
The status of Friday's Bay League football game between Hawthorne and Beverly 
Hills high schools will not be decided until today because of the teachers 
strike in the Beverly Hills Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills Principal Ben Bushman said the Normans will forfeit the game if 
co-coaches Bill Stansbury and Dick Billingsley remain on strike. Beverly Hills, 
scheduled to play host to Hawthorne at 2:45 p.m., forfeited last week's game to 
Santa Monica.

FALL SPORTS ROUNDUP;

<P>
OCCIDENTAL NO MATCH FOR CLAREMONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last month, the Occidental men's soccer team played one of its best matches of 
the season against conference-rival Claremont, losing in double overtime to the 
Stags, ranked No. 2 in Division III. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's rematch at Claremont, however, was a different story as Claremont 
raced to a three-goal lead at halftime en route to a 5-0 win in a Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference match. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't generate any offense at all and we didn't play defense well, 
either," Occidental Coach Lowell Thomas said. "You can't afford to play sloppy 
against a team that good and expect to do very well." 
</P>
<P>
Occidental fell to 6-8-2, 5-4-2 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
In another soccer match: 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran 3, Caltech 2 -- Casey Pirih and Ricky Meyers hooked up on both the 
giving and receiving end to lead Cal Lutheran in a nonconference match at 
Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
Myers scored unassisted at the 14-minute mark to give CLU (11-5-1) a 1-0 lead. 
Pirih scored six minutes later on an assist from Jesse Gallegos for a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Myers scored Cal Lutheran's final goal on an assist from Pirih at the 48-minute 
mark.

Moorpark 22, Bakersfield 21 -- Bakersfield needed a pin in the final match to 
secure a tie, but Moorpark heavyweight David Mitchell managed to hold off 
George Anderson, 20-5, to keep the Raiders unbeaten in Western State Conference 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (6-1-1, 2-0) won several lopsided matches in building a big lead. In 
the 188-pound class, Moorpark's Delfino Ochoa defeated Steve Ward, 21-6. At 190 
pounds, Moorpark's Carson Wollert beat Steve Sherr, 16-4. Tony Flores of 
Moorpark defeated Jim Frolic, 14-5, at 177 pounds.

THE COLLEGES; 
</P>
<P>
BAKERSFIELD NEXT IN LINE TO CHALLENGE CSUN HOME WIN STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The streak is at 51 and counting. 
</P>
<P>
When will it end? Perhaps as early as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Cal State Northridge, ranked 11th in the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. Division II women's volleyball poll plays host to ninth-ranked 
Cal State Bakersfield in a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. match that 
features a couple of intriguing twists. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, which has won 51 CCAA matches in a row at home, has already lost 
twice to Bakersfield this season. The Lady Matadors dropped two of three games 
against Bakersfield at the UC Davis tournament in early September, and on Oct. 
3 at Bakersfield, the Roadrunners swept CSUN in three games. 
</P>
<P>
However, salvaging the home winning streak is not foremost on the mind of Walt 
Ker, the Northridge coach. 
</P>
<P>
"The streak is very nice to hear about, but it really doesn't mean much to me," 
Ker said. "It's a media-oriented statistic. The new players in the conference, 
it can't be very meaningful to them because they haven't had anything to do 
with it. The only time I even mention (the streak) is when I'm recruiting." 
</P>
<P>
Ker is more concerned about CSUN's place in the CCAA standings. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors enter Friday's match 15-9 overall and 3-3 in conference 
matches. Bakersfield is 10-10 overall and 4-2 in the CCAA. Both teams trail 
top-ranked UC Riverside, which is 16-1 overall and 6-0 in conference games. 
</P>
<P>
Another CCAA loss would equal CSUN's total in the previous seven seasons 
combined. Northridge has never lost more than three conference matches in a 
season and has a 94-10 record since the CCAA was formed in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds trite, but fundamentals will make the difference for us," Ker said. 
"That's been our focus for the last three or four weeks. We've been working 
hard to gain some consistency, and when we do, we're going to be tough. 
</P>
<P>
"We continue to execute in practice, train hard and be coachable every day. I 
know evidence of that work is going to come forth in matches. We're ready to 
pop." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge's last meeting against Bakersfield marked one of the Lady Matadors' 
worst performances of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"We played poorly, but Bakersfield also is a very good team," Ker said. "This 
will give us a true test of how far we've come in the last few weeks." 
</P>
<P>
And, on a more personal note, Ker does not relish the prospect of dropping 
another decision to Dave Rubio, his protege. 
</P>
<P>
Rubio, who played for Ker at Granada Hills High and Northridge, is in his third 
season as Bakersfield's coach. Rubio's assistant, Rob Wortmann, was formerly a 
CSUN assistant. Both men were ushers at Ker's wedding and are counted among his 
best friends. "If there is a person who I've talked more volleyball with than 
anyone else, it would have to be Dave," Ker said. "Any time I coach against a 
friend, it becomes that much more meaningful." 
</P>
<P>
Pulling the plug: The Cal Lutheran women's volleyball season came to a merciful 
-- and premature -- close with a three-game loss to Christ College on Tuesday. 
Cal Lutheran's final match, against Redlands, was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
The Redlands match was to be played Saturday, which is the day of Cal 
Lutheran's football homecoming game. The Cal Lutheran players reportedly 
weren't too excited about missing homecoming to travel to Redlands for another 
match after losing their 20th match of the season. Redlands agreed to release 
the Regals from their obligation. 
</P>
<P>
The 0-20 record is the worst of any team in Cal Lutheran history. The men's 
basketball team set the previous record for futility with a 2-24 record in 
1967-68. 
</P>
<P>
Only two years ago, the volleyball team finished 31-7, but the program went 
into a precipitous slide this year when only two players returned from the 1988 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
Loss ledger: Cal Lutheran's 38-15 loss to Santa Clara on Saturday dropped the 
Kingsmen to 2-5 and assured the team of its fourth consecutive losing season. 
</P>
<P>
In the 28 years Cal Lutheran has played football, the school had recorded only 
two sub-.500 seasons prior to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Wide margins: Valley College's 47-0 win over Compton last Saturday marked the 
Monarchs' biggest margin of victory since last season's 64-16 decision over 
Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pierce defeated West L. A., 30-15, on Saturday, thereby doubling its 
1988 win total. Pierce was 1-9 last season after resurrecting the sport after a 
two-year hiatus. The Brahmas are 2-4 this season. 
</P>
<P>
On the mend: The pins and stitches have been removed from the injured left 
index finger of Mike Demeter, Cal Lutheran's leading rebounder and 
second-leading scorer last season, and Demeter should be able to participate in 
basketball practice in about a week. 
</P>
<P>
While working a summer job, Demeter, a 6-foot-7 senior center, had his hand 
crushed in a truck door. The injury required 18 stitches and two pins in his 
finger. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball practice began Sunday, but Coach Mike Dunlap has kept Demeter on the 
sidelines where he watches practice or rides a stationary bike. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't want anything to happen. I can be accident prone at times," Demeter 
said. "I had been playing with the team before I had the surgery to take the 
pins out, and it was feeling OK." 
</P>
<P>
Demeter said that he can't bend the finger because of ligament damage, and he 
will have to tape it to his middle finger when he plays. 
</P>
<P>
Little big man: Occidental tailback Gary Little was limited to 68 yards in 21 
carries during the Tigers' 44-14 victory over Claremont last week, but the 
freshman from San Francisco maintained his position at the top of the Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference rushing list. 
</P>
<P>
Little is averaging 136.2 yards. Claremont was the first team to hold Little to 
less than 100 yards since he became a starter in the third game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Despite quarterback Tony Werbelow's performance against Claremont (11 for 14 
for 198 yards and three touchdowns), Occidental remains last in the conference 
in passing offense (111.8 yards a game). 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers (5-1 overall, 3-0 in conference play) are second in the conference 
behind Redlands in total offense and total defense. Occidental will meet 
Redlands (3-3, 3-0) next week in what figures to be a showdown for the SCIAC 
title. 
</P>
<P>
On the rise: The Northridge men's soccer team took some big steps toward 
winning its sixth consecutive CCAA championship with victories over Bakersfield 
and Cal Poly Pomona last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors' 1-0 win over Bakersfield (13-3-1, 3-2-1) gave CSUN (8-3-3, 5-1-1) 
sole possession of first place in the CCAA. The victory over Pomona allowed 
Northridge to maintain its one-point lead on Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (7-2-6, 
4-1-2). 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield's 2-0 loss to San Luis Obispo last Saturday left the Roadrunners in 
third place, four points behind CSUN, which has three wins and a tie since a 
2-1 overtime loss to Chapman 2 1/2 weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"That game kind of woke us up," forward Bobby Reyes said. "We dominated it, but 
their guy made two incredible shots to beat us. We knew then that we had to 
bear down. We knew then that we couldn't lose any more games in conference and 
still win it." 
</P>
<P>
The CCAA champion earns an automatic berth in the NCAA Division II playoffs. 
The conference runner-up would be eligible for an at-large berth. 
</P>

EL CAMINO REAL UPSETS CHATSWORTH IN VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT BUTWELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coach normally doesn't tell jokes during a timeout huddle in the fifth game 
of a volleyball match, especially when her team is about to pull off an upset. 
</P>
<P>
Believing humor might relax her team, however, El Camino Real High girls' 
volleyball Coach Lori Chandler turned comedian with her team ahead, 8-1, 
against Chatsworth on Wednesday. She even pulled money out of her pocket and 
offered the team pizzas if it won. 
</P>
<P>
After a few laughs, Chandler's strategy proved successful as the calm 
Conquistadores handed the Chancellors their first Northwest Valley Conference 
loss, an 11-15, 5-15, 16-14, 15-3, 15-10 setback at Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
The lighthearted approach enabled El Camino Real (9-2 overall, 6-2 in 
conference play) to snap Chatsworth's eight-match winning streak and hand the 
Chancellors (10-2, 7-1) their first conference loss in two years. Each team has 
two conference matches remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm usually a screaming maniac and yell too much at the team," Chandler said. 
"But that put too much pressure on them and I told them to just have fun 
today." 
</P>
<P>
The jocular side of Chandler was met with approval from captain Jennifer 
Dinaberg, who had a team-high 13 kills. "When she's not constantly yelling and 
screaming at us, the team is not afraid to make mistakes and plays with more 
confidence," Dinaberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Will the Conquistadores really get pizza? "Yes," Chandler said. "Pepperoni." 
</P>
<P>
The Conquistadores weren't laughing after dropping the first two games and 
finding themselves trailing, 14-10, in the third game. 
</P>
<P>
After Chatsworth failed to serve the ball over the net on match point, El 
Camino Real scored the last six points of the third game, two on Dinaberg 
kills, and continued its surge in the fourth and fifth games. 
</P>
<P>
At one point in the fourth game until an 8-1 lead in the fifth game, the 
Conquistadores scored 18 of 20 points.

Sara Lee Corp.: The Chicago-based food company said first-quarter earnings rose 
24% to $93.8 million. The company said improved results were reported despite 
restructuring its food service business, which resulted in an annual loss of 
more than $1 billion in sales. The company said core operations reported solid 
results, with outstanding performance in its personal products businesses. 
Revenue was flat at $2.7 billion.

GM Hughes Electronics Corp.: The Detroit-based firm's third-quarter profit fell 
17.7% to $148 million on revenue of $2.6 billion, unchanged from a year ago. 
The decline was attributed to an 8.4% drop in GM's North American vehicle 
production and also reflects a $24-million non-recurring charge related to its 
plan to cut 6,000 jobs by year-end. GMHE comprises Hughes Aircraft Co. and 
Delco Electronics Corp.

which had 1988 revenue of $13.5 billion, said it financed or leased 676,000 new 
cars and trucks in the United States in the quarter, up 35%, but borrowing 
costs averaged 9.38%, up from 8.45%.

Comprehensive Care: The nation's largest alcohol and drug treatment company 
reported a $4.7-million first-quarter loss, sending the Irvine company's stock 
price down from $8.375 to $3.625 and endangering a critical merger with First 
Hospital Corp. Revenue during the first quarter fell 17% to $44 million; the 
$4.7-million loss contrasts with a $1.6-million profit in the same period a 
year earlier. The company, which operates the CareUnit chain of treatment 
centers, has suffered recently as fewer and fewer people use its facilities and 
those who do aren't staying as long as they once did.

Calfed Inc.: The financial services company reported third-quarter net income 
of $22.2 million, down 47% from the same period last year. The Los Angeles firm 
said a higher cost of funds in its financial services segment and a one-time 
pretax writedown of $15.6 million on the insurance lines generated by a 
subsidiary contributed to its results.

AVON'S NEW REFRAIN; 
</P>
<P>
NOW REPRESENTATIVES CAN SELL WHEREVER THEY PLEASE -- AT HOME OR IN THE 
WORKPLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN STEINBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
With her makeup perfectly applied and her black hair piled high on her head, 
Cathy Ortega stepped confidently from the elevator of a Mission Hills medical 
building, the scent of spring flowers trailing behind her. She nodded to a 
receptionist as she passed through an open door, then headed toward a narrow 
foyer to peddle her wares. 
</P>
<P>
Employees soon clustered around her. Fifteen minutes later, she emerged from 
the office, neatly tucking $120 worth of orders for perfume, cosmetics and 
accessories into her purse. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the world of the modern-day Avon lady. 
</P>
<P>
With women firmly ensconced in the workplace, that old cliched refrain -- 
"Ding, dong, Avon calling" -- has become increasingly rare. 
</P>
<P>
Only eight of the 235 Avon representatives that Vicky Martinez supervises in 
her San Fernando Valley district still sell door-to-door. 
</P>
<P>
"Times have changed," said Martinez, 46, who began working for Avon 21 years 
ago. "Ninety percent of the women are working. It's hard to find them home." 
</P>
<P>
Avon, troubled by declining profits in the early 1980s, revamped its marketing 
strategy. The company adopted a "metro plan" four years ago that allows 
representatives, once assigned to sell door-to-door in specific territories, to 
sell anywhere they please -- to friends, relatives and colleagues -- no matter 
where they live. 
</P>
<P>
"Many were selling that way for some time," said Rolene Dinsdale, who used to 
supervise the division stretching from San Diego to the Valley. "We've just 
recognized it. And we had to change." 
</P>
<P>
Territories, typically made up of 100 homes, still exist in some areas. And 
although anybody can request one, they are generally the domain of veteran 
representatives who have established a steady clientele over the years. Newer 
representatives generally prefer to sell in the workplace, Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent overlap, sellers are prohibited from going door-to-door in someone 
else's territory, although they may sell to friends or colleagues who live 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, we didn't know who our core customer was," Dinsdale said. "But 
research tells us that she's the woman between 24 and 50 with a total family 
income of $30,000 or under and she probably works." 
</P>
<P>
To capture this market, Avon has added designer jewelry, lingerie, videotapes 
and educational toys to its more traditional makeup and gift lines. The company 
even markets its own version of Garfield the cat -- a toy frog called Leapin 
Leonard. Like its popular counterpart, Leonard comes with plastic suction cups 
on its feet so it can be affixed to the windows of a car. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most important, however, has been Avon's attempt to capture the 
Hispanic market. The company advertises on Spanish-language television and in 
Spanish newspapers. It produces purchase orders in Spanish and provides Spanish 
overwraps for its catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
A growing number of Avon employees are also Spanish-speaking -- 60% of the 
representatives in Martinez's district, compared with 10% five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hispanic consumer likes Avon products," Martinez said. "I think they think 
it's a treat." 
</P>
<P>
High-priced cosmetic lines typically found in department stores are beyond the 
reach of many women, Martinez said. Avon, she added, offers comparable products 
at a fraction of the cost, complete with a money-back guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
A tube of mascara that costs more than $10 in department stores was advertised 
in a recent Avon catalogue for $2.99, marked down from the regular price of 
$4.50. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Avon is trying to be competitive," Martinez said. "The products are 
great . . . and the packaging is great." 
</P>
<P>
Avon's modest beginnings date to 1886 when door-to-door book salesman David H. 
McConnell started what was then called the California Perfume Co. in Suffern, 
N.Y., after noticing that his female customers paid far more attention to his 
free fragrance samples than to his books. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. P. F. E. Albee of Winchester, N.H., was the company's first direct sales 
representative, traveling by train and horse-drawn carriage. Since then, more 
than 40 million women, and a small number of men, have sold Avon products, 
generating more than $3 billion in sales for the company last year. 
</P>
<P>
During the same time, Avon's laboratory grew from a room measuring 20 by 26 
feet to a modern assembly line in Suffern that turns out 250 lipsticks per 
minute or more than 300,000 in a single day. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega, 38, is typical of the contemporary Avon representative: a single mother 
who began selling Avon products to supplement her income as a hair stylist. Her 
sales totaled $22,000 last year, and she earned a 50% commission. 
</P>
<P>
A corner of her aunt's My Fair Lady Beauty Salon in Arleta, where she works 
four days a week, is devoted to Avon. The shelves are lined with the company's 
newest attractions, from fragrances to scarfs and other accessories. 
</P>
<P>
"Our Fifth Avenue smells like Giorgio and the Serenade smells like Chanel," 
Ortega said. "But our prices are great." 
</P>
<P>
With her Avon earrings and necklace, her Avon eyeliner and shadow, Ortega is a 
walking advertisement for her employer. 
</P>
<P>
"My nails are always done," she said proudly, displaying 10 perfectly polished, 
rose-colored fingernails. "And my makeup is always on." 
</P>
<P>
Most of Ortega's customers come to the salon to place their orders, although 
she serves two medical buildings in Mission Hills, stopping by about 20 offices 
every other week to drop off Avon catalogues, pick up orders and deliver 
products. 
</P>
<P>
She also manages a staff of six "subsellers" who do business for her in other 
parts of the city. They receive free products or a small commission in 
exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Every six weeks, she arranges a breakfast meeting with her best customers to 
show them what's new. 
</P>
<P>
"For part time, I think I do very well," said Ortega, who has been selling Avon 
since 1983. "I can make $500 a month. That's very good for me." 
</P>
<P>
Delia Thundermeyer, 33, started selling Avon in 1986 when her daughter was 6 
months old. She, too, needed more money, but wanted to work from her Sun Valley 
home. 
</P>
<P>
She sells more than $13,000 worth of products a year, a business boosted by 
advertising in Laundromats and "prospecting" in shopping malls and other public 
places. 
</P>
<P>
After first getting permission, Thundermeyer positions herself near the 
entrance of supermarkets or crowded shopping centers and distributes Avon 
samples and brochures. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from generating new customers, she has recruited 100 Avon representatives 
that way, earning $20 for each recruit. 
</P>
<P>
As one of the Valley's top representatives, Dee Clark of Pacoima sells more 
than $500,000 worth of Avon products a year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to her commission, Clark has won trips to Hawaii, the Bahamas, 
Washington, San Francisco and Orlando, Fla., all courtesy of Avon. 
</P>
<P>
"I started out very small," said Clark, who is entering her 11th year with 
Avon. "My first order was under $50." Today, she manages a staff of 18 
subsellers, has about 200 regular customers and rarely turns in an order of 
less than $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
To assist her subsellers, Clark produces a six-page newsletter chock full of 
product information, sales tips and motivational techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"If they slam the door in your face, don't get upset," she advises. "Don't take 
it personally. Things happen in people's lives. Try again. That's the very 
first thing that was taught to me years and years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"But if they slam the door in your face two or three times, go to the next 
house and forget them. Some people you'll never win over." 
</P>
<P>
Clark, 51, is an Avon representative in the old tradition, catering to a steady 
core of customers in predominantly one area: Sunland-Tujunga. But she's added a 
new twist, operating her home-based business more like a store. Her customers 
come to her. 
</P>
<P>
She has an "open" and "closed" sign that she hangs on her front door, right 
next to her hours, which are 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband thinks I live, eat and breathe Avon," she confided. 
</P>
<P>
Every other Thursday, a white van pulls up to her house and unloads between 60 
and 100 boxes, enough to carpet her entire living room. Then she and a helper 
spend most of the day unpacking, sorting and bagging the products. 
</P>
<P>
On Mondays, Clark and her husband Bob drive through her territory, tossing the 
newest Avon catalogue on doorsteps and delivering whatever merchandise her 
customers have neglected to pick up. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety percent just call this answering machine and leave their order," she 
said. "They know that in two weeks, they will get a card from me that their 
order is ready, then they come pick it up." 
</P>
<P>
The key to her success, she said, is giving regular customers and employees 
small gifts and discounts on their purchases. She even trims the tab for 
customers who pick up their orders so that she doesn't have to deliver them. 
</P>
<P>
"People love to get something for free," she said.

TEACHING OTHERS TO TRACE ELUSIVE JEWISH ROOTS

<P>
Herb Mautner and Geraldine Winerman search for clues the way the best 
detectives do. They ask a lot of questions, consider at length even the most 
remote possibilities and never give up. As genealogists, what they want to 
discover is anything about their families' pasts. 
</P>
<P>
Mautner, 66, a retired industrial engineer, has spent thousands of hours over 
the past 16 years tracking down about 2,000 of his ancestors from the last 10 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
Winerman, 49, has made less progress -- she has been researching her roots only 
since 1983. But, she says, "I've been bitten by a genealogy bug that won't let 
go. 
</P>
<P>
"My mind is whirling on a constant basis. I'm constantly thinking, 'What can I 
do to find this tidbit of information?' " 
</P>
<P>
Mautner and Winerman have started to research their spouses' relatives. "I 
think it's terrific. It's the first time she's been really interested in 
something," said Winerman's husband, Gerald, an administrative law judge. 
</P>
<P>
Mautner's wife of 41 years, Maryanne, is equally enthusiastic. So far, Mautner 
had uncovered the genealogy of Maryanne Mautner's four grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
Mautner and Winerman met by chance through the Los Angeles Jewish Genealogical 
Society. They began teaching a class on Jewish genealogy in the spring of 1988 
at Valley Cities Jewish Community Center in Van Nuys and will be conducting 
another session in early November. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the 12-hour course, presented over five sessions, is to inform 
students of the resources available to help them discover their family 
heritage. Students are also taught how to effectively use these resources. 
</P>
<P>
Many people assume that Jewish genealogy is impossible because many of the 
records have been destroyed, but Winerman says it's just a matter of knowing 
where to look. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most outstanding centers for this type of research is the Los 
Angeles Family History Library in West Los Angeles, which is owned and operated 
by the Mormon Church. 
</P>
<P>
With more than 65,000 reels of microfilm, 30,000 sheets of microfiche and 
12,000 books, the library is the second-largest of its kind in the country. 
(The largest genealogy library, also owned by the Mormons, is in Salt Lake 
City.) 
</P>
<P>
Because of the Mormons' strong belief in keeping the family together, they have 
traditionally tried to preserve genealogical records and assist others in 
learning about their family heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two years, the library in West Los Angeles has seen a 35% to 50% 
increase in the number of people using their facilities, said librarian Dora 
Holt. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this increased interest in genealogy, the library extended its hours 
about a year and a half ago. In addition, Holt added, to accommodate the large 
volume of visitors, the library no longer closes for two weeks in August and 
December as it used to do. 
</P>
<P>
Holt said a recent issue of Reader's Digest stated that genealogy has replaced 
stamp collecting as the No. 1 hobby in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Writing personal histories, which can be passed down from one generation to 
another, has also become popular, and many of the people who visit the Family 
History Library are involved in compiling such documents. When asked why they 
search for their roots, many enthusiasts say they got hooked after talking with 
someone who was already involved in genealogy. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Family History Library acquired documents confiscated by the 
U.S. government in 1928 from Russian consulates in seven U.S. cities. The 
records cover 1870 to 1914 and include valuable information about Russian Jews 
who contacted the consulates during that period. The consular documents were 
transferred to about 145 reels of microfilm in 1986, Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the various reference texts and documents the library houses, 
Mautner and Winerman present a special four-hour session there as part of their 
course. They also make use of a variety of published resources, including the 
Jewish Family Finder, a New Jersey computer listing composed of about 1,150 
genealogists, 7,200 surnames and 4,000 towns. Such publications provide a way 
for those studying genealogy to link up with others across the country who 
share their interest. 
</P>
<P>
When the Los Angeles Jewish Genealogical Society was established in 1979, there 
was only one other organization of its kind, in New York City. Since then, 35 
other Jewish genealogy societies have sprung up, including ones in Holland, 
France and Switzerland -- another indication that interest in genealogy 
continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
One of the major difficulties facing Jewish genealogists is that Jews 
frequently changed their names, especially during times of persecution. Jewish 
family names have only existed about 200 years, Mautner explained. Before then, 
the names were mainly Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
But even if a person's ancestors changed their names, Mautner and Winerman have 
several suggestions for genealogists. 
</P>
<P>
First, they recommend asking lots of questions of the oldest relatives. With 
reference to the town a family came from, it's important to get not only the 
name of the town but also the specific location, since often there were several 
towns by the same name. 
</P>
<P>
Check official documents, such as the census and birth, marriage and death 
certificates. Also, find out if there were rabbis in the family, since rabbis 
keep genealogical records, some as far back as 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
Once people start to gather facts about their families, they'll usually need to 
practice more than a bit of patience, the pair say. When Mautner was working, 
every day during lunch he would write one letter, as part of his search for his 
roots. One time, he contacted the Czechoslovakian Embassy and had to wait about 
two and a half years for a reply. After paying them $200, Mautner received a 
list of 40 of his ancestors. In his opinion, the fee was well worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have a little luck," Mautner said. "But sometimes, you hit a dead 
area. Then you can go for hours, days and weeks and not find anything." 
</P>
<P>
Learning about one's family can be an eye-opening experience, too -- sometimes 
pleasant, sometimes not so pleasant. "We all find skeletons in our closet," 
Winerman said. 
</P>
<P>
When she was investigating her family's past, Winerman learned through an old 
newspaper clipping about one relative who, as a young man, married a woman in 
her 60s. Subsequently, Winerman's relative gambled and lost all his wife's 
money on horses. "Eventually, he became a mailman and settled down," she said 
with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
However, she also learned of ancestors who were Sephardic Jews living in Spain 
in the 1600s. "These people could not openly practice their religion, so they 
had to do it secretly," Winerman said. "If they were caught, they would have 
been persecuted or even executed." 
</P>
<P>
She also learned that some relatives died in Nazi concentration camps. 
"Learning all of this made me feel much more connected with my Judaism. Finding 
out that my family remained Jewish, what they did despite all the persecutions, 
made me proud," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Genealogy seems to lead to stronger family ties. 
</P>
<P>
After taking Mautner and Winerman's class, Eileen Wasserman, 40, of West Los 
Angeles, began to contact relatives she hadn't seen in 20 or 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's brought me much closer to family members I hadn't been emotionally close 
to," Wasserman said. "It's added so much to my life." 
</P>
<P>
And for Dr. Hillel Lazarus, 53, of North Hollywood, the result was much the 
same. After writing an 800-page family history that included 1,100 photos, 
Lazarus planned a family reunion, which was held this past Memorial Day. The 
event attracted 130 guests, some of whom Lazarus had not seen in 30 years. "It 
made me feel great," Lazarus said. "It gave us all a sense of togetherness. It 
was a good way to expose the younger generations to the family."

BENCHES SERVE SWEET PUT-ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An odd advertisement has popped up on some 900 bus benches around Los Angeles 
and Orange counties. "Love Handles," it says. "Fat food to go. (Not available 
anywhere)." There is an accompanying photograph of a piece of chocolate cake 
with a plastic handle on top. 
</P>
<P>
No, "Love Handles" aren't an underground product aimed at countering the diet 
fad. They aren't a convenient way of carrying around a snack, either. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, "Love Handles" don't exist. The ad is part of a market research survey 
being conducted by a company that owns some 14,000 benches in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Coast United Advertising is trying to determine how many people actually notice 
what's written on bus benches. The company tried to create a fanciful, flippant 
product that wouldn't be confused with anything else. 
</P>
<P>
The advertisements were posted two weeks ago, and researchers have been asking 
people on the street if they have seen them. The company hopes to use the 
responses to attract new business. 
</P>
<P>
There isn't any address or phone number listed on the ad, but Coast United's 
phone number is printed on its bus benches, so the "Love Handles" campaign has 
generated an unforeseen response. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been getting phone calls," said Arlan Renfro, the company's president. 
"People are saying 'What's this all about?' "

Shoot My Cat, Please 
</P>
<P>
Among the dozens of 1990 calendars out on the market is one published by 
Recycled Paper Products called, naturally, "Cats," which features portraits of 
the felines in lush, romantic settings. The cat-catching photographer, Koren 
Trygg of Studio City, specializes in shooting animals for greeting card covers. 
</P>
<P>
"Ducks are by far the worst animals to work with," she says. A line of greeting 
cards introduced last year called Wise Quacks (also by Recycled Paper Products) 
features her duck photos. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to work really fast and shoot a lot of film, because they're always 
moving," she explains. "You've got no control, and they respond to nothing, 
like food or simple commands. And these were Hollywood ducks that I worked 
with! I mean, they came from an animal agency!" Complicating the problem of 
constant motion is the problem of constant elimination. The ducks soil the set 
frequently. 
</P>
<P>
Trygg finds dogs the easiest animals to work with. "Dogs almost always respond 
to food, and they follow simple commands," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Straddling the middle ground are cats. "A lot of times they just turn their 
backs to you, because they know what you want. Some cats you can bribe with 
turkey, or you call their name, and when they look up you shoot them. But if 
they don't respond to food, you know you're through for the day," Trygg says. 
</P>
<P>
The photographer likes to use her friends' and family's cats along with her 
own. "The cat sets the pace. Sometimes you won't get the shot that day, so you 
have to set up all over again another day." 
</P>
<P>
She has used one of her own cats as a model so many times, he's even gotten fan 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
Happy 105th Birthday 
</P>
<P>
The first question you have to ask someone who just hit the big 105 is, "What 
is the secret to living a long life?" 
</P>
<P>
Ureva Mann, who lives at the Fallbrook Retirement Center in Canoga Park and 
turned 105 Oct. 11, answers, "I always worked. I always had jobs. I always had 
something to do." 
</P>
<P>
To be fair, longevity runs in her family. She was the youngest child, and five 
of her six siblings lived into their 90s. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, she says she can't read or write or see very well, but she's a 
veritable speed demon in her walker. "I walk like I do everything else: If I do 
it, I do it as quick as I can," she says, adding, "I exercise a lot." Other 
than being hard of hearing, her health is excellent. 
</P>
<P>
She thinks the greatest invention she's seen in her lifetime is the microwave 
oven. 
</P>
<P>
What advice does she have for young people? "I don't think they'd take it if I 
could give it. They're all too independent nowadays," she asserts. 
</P>
<P>
Well, then, what about the shape the world's in? Is it getting better or worse? 
"It hasn't gotten any better, but I wouldn't say it's gotten any worse," she 
waffles. The difference, she says, is that "people were very satisfied with the 
world when I was young. They didn't all go around saying the world was in bad 
shape." 
</P>
<P>
Mann has lived in Southern California since 1952 and moved into the Fallbrook 
Retirement Center when she turned 100. She has one son, five grandchildren and 
two great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
As for vices, hers are limited. "I started smoking cigarettes at 35, and I quit 
at 60. I never drank much. Wine is my hardest drink, and I don't drink it 
often," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Mums in Bloom 
</P>
<P>
The last week of October through November is prime time for blooming 
chrysanthemums, notes Mamoru Tashima, owner of Sunnyslope Mum Gardens in Lake 
View Terrace. "This is my busiest season," says Tashima, whose wholesale/retail 
business has been in the San Fernando Valley for 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
People tend to gravitate toward yellow mums. "Yellow is brighter than the 
bronze, reds, pinks and whites. Those aren't real sharp colors, and they tend 
to fade in the background. But you get a bright yellow, and it stands out -- 
you know it's there," he says. 
</P>
<P>
If you are planting colors other than yellow, put them in a spot that people 
pass by at close range, rather than having to view them from afar, Tashima 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
Mums bloom on short days and warm nights. Some people make the mistake of 
planting them too close to street lights, so that the mums never get the 
requisite hours of darkness they require each night to bloom again the 
following year. 
</P>
<P>
At-Home Dining 
</P>
<P>
The formal sit-down dinner is coming back in style. It's formal in that the 
good china is brought out, but it's not formal in spirit. Instead it's fun, 
relaxed and intimate. 
</P>
<P>
"Because people are investing in homes, they want to use them -- they prefer to 
stay there rather than go out," says Shirley Mae Epps, china and crystal buyer 
for David Orgell, which has stores in Northridge and Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Other retailers point out that couples from the ages of 35 to 40 are becoming 
parents now, frequently for the first time, which is keeping them at home. 
"People are beginning to find that it's much quieter and easier to entertain at 
home than to make all the arrangements to go out," says Robert Lamont, 
executive vice president of David Orgell. 
</P>
<P>
A mix-and-match look for table decor is popular with some couples. "They'll 
still buy the regular five-piece place setting of an expensive pattern, but 
they might also buy extra salad plates in a different pattern. Or they bring in 
some accessories like sugar bowls, creamers or serving dishes in a different 
pattern to change the look of their table," says Renee Singer, owner of Cristal 
Palais in Agoura Hills City Mall. 
</P>
<P>
Couples are also beginning to buy additional patterns of china -- with service 
for only two, four or six people -- that's different from their everyday china 
and their good china. "People in their late 20s, 30s or early 40s are doing 
this," Lamont says. Rather than vary the table linens, these people may vary 
the china for smaller dinner parties. 
</P>
<P>
"A more formal table setting keeps you at the table longer," Epps notes. "In my 
house, we sit around the table for hours, and instead of moving to the living 
room for coffee, we drink it at the table and sit around talking, and then 
everyone goes home." 
</P>
<P>
Overheard 
</P>
<P>
"I spent a lot of time earning these wrinkles. Why would I want to cover them 
up?"

COUNCIL BANS APARTMENTS IN 3 AREAS; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: THE CITY COUNCIL TAKES A SMALL STEP TOWARD ITS GOAL OF CURBING RAMPANT 
POPULATION GROWTH BY ELIMINATING MORE THAN 400 POTENTIAL BUILDING UNITS FROM 
THE GENERAL PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Glendale City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved zoning changes that 
would ban apartment construction in three neighborhoods, eliminating more than 
400 potential building units from the General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, the council took a small step forward in its campaign to curb the 
city's rampant population growth. 
</P>
<P>
City planners say nearly 30,000 building units now allowed will have to be 
eliminated to achieve the council's stated goal of limiting Glendale's 
population to close to the 200,000 recommended in the General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
"That leaves us 29,000 more units to go," Mayor Jerold Milner said. 
</P>
<P>
The council action followed requests by residents of those neighborhoods, who 
complained that further apartment construction would cause traffic congestion, 
parking problems and a strain on available open space. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhoods zoned down to single-family are: 
</P>
<P>
* The 200 blocks of Irvine and Thompson avenues, zoned for horses and small 
apartments. Eighty-six potential new units will be eliminated as a result of 
the downzone. 
</P>
<P>
* A medium-density apartment zone in the 1000 blocks of Grover and Davis 
avenues. The downzoning eliminates the potential for 166 new units. 
</P>
<P>
* The vicinity of Madison Way, Roads End, Heminger Street, Mission Road and 
Colby Drive, which were previously zoned for medium-density apartments. This 
eliminates the potential for 156 new units. 
</P>
<P>
The council still has a long way to go. Under present zoning standards, 
Glendale's population could soar to 300,000 before reaching full occupancy, 
city planners say. 
</P>
<P>
And since Councilman Larry Zarian first asked residents to surrender the rights 
to develop their properties last year, the response has been lukewarm. In 
addition to the three neighborhoods downzoned Tuesday, only two more have done 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
City Planning Director John McKenna said only one more neighborhood is 
contemplating a zone change. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed," Zarian said. "I was hoping that more neighborhoods would 
downzone voluntarily, rather than having the City Council do it for them." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale is in its second year of a moratorium on apartment, condominium and 
townhouse construction, which was adopted to give the council time to study, 
identify and target specific neighborhoods for down-zoning. Such a process 
would be completed by February, at which time the moratorium would be lifted, 
city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said the down-zoning is needed because a population of more 
than 220,000 would put too much strain on the city's streets, schools and other 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Since there have been no indications that many neighborhoods will step forward 
to request down-zoning, the council will be faced in February with the choice 
of either imposing what Zarian has called "wholesale down-zoning," or giving up 
on the council's two-year crusade to prevent a population explosion. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the council held three separate hearings before voting on the 
down-zoning, during which most speakers praised the changes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dream come true," Kathy Crunelle said after the hearing. "Our children 
will have a place to play." Crunelle lives on Grover Avenue and signed a 
petition requesting the down-zoning. Roughly half the homeowners from the three 
neighborhoods signed such petitions. 
</P>
<P>
About one-third of the dozen or so speakers pleaded with the council not to 
take away their right to tear down their houses and replace them with apartment 
complexes.

3 TOLL JUNIOR HIGH STUDENTS SUSPENDED IN BEATING OF YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Toll Junior High School students who police say are gang members were 
suspended last week after being charged with felony assault in the beating of a 
13-year-old student who was walking home after school. 
</P>
<P>
The attack was the latest incident in a wave of gang violence that has hit the 
Glendale school system this year. Last month, Hoover High School, across the 
street from Toll, sealed off its campus to outsiders and increased security in 
response to two gang-related incidents involving non-students. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that gang activity in Glendale has increased 
dramatically," said Toll Vice Principal Tom Vessella. "It's no longer a school 
problem. It's become a problem for the entire community." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of last week's assault, two 13-year-olds and one 14-year-old were 
suspended pending pre-expulsion hearings, Vessella said. The victim, Eric 
Nazarian, 13, was treated for severe cuts and bruises to his face and body at 
Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles on Oct. 18, police reports said. 
</P>
<P>
Nazarian, whose left eye was swollen shut, has yet to return to school, 
Vessella said. 
</P>
<P>
Nazarian told investigators that he was approached by a group of teen-agers, 
who police say are gang members, as he and a friend were walking on Glenwood 
Road about 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The victim identified 11 students from Toll Junior High and four from Hoover 
High School as his assailants, but school officials say they have no evidence 
that all 15 participated in the beating. "At this point we are trying to 
separate the looky-loos from the direct participants," Vessella said. 
</P>
<P>
The three youths identified by police as being the most active participants in 
the beating were arrested on suspicion of felony assault and later released to 
their parents, Glendale Police Sgt. Dean Durand said. 
</P>
<P>
Nazarian told police that he did not know why he was attacked. He said his 
assailants had accused him of cursing their gang.

<P>
There are parties that Ed Tessier doesn't go to, plays he can't see, guest 
lectures he won't hear. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that he doesn't want to. It's because the events aren't accessible to 
wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
Some people might just accept that and move on. But not the 21-year-old 
Tessier. He decided to do something about it -- and make some money in the 
bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Between studying for tests and writing papers at Pomona College, Tessier makes 
a living dealing with the problems he and millions of other disabled people 
face every day. 
</P>
<P>
Three days a week, Tessier leaves campus for a wood-paneled office building on 
the corner of Main Street and Pomona Mall West. The office is the home of 
Designs for Independence, a nonprofit corporation he founded 1 1/2 years ago. 
There, he doles out information and advice to businesses, private homeowners 
and schools on how to make buildings more accessible to the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
His daily experiences have made him an expert in the field. A quadriplegic 
since an accident five years ago, he has been turned down by restaurant maitre 
d's, forced to sit in the back of movie theaters and discriminated against by 
employers who say they don't have the proper facilities to accommodate a 
disabled worker. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a real gap between knowing the code and how best to apply it," Tessier 
said, sitting behind a desk stacked with state and federal building code 
requirements. "I quickly learned I had a point of view the building industry 
wasn't familiar with. I could learn their lingo and translate my practical 
expertise into practical suggestions." 
</P>
<P>
On a typical day at Designs for Independence, Tessier will get a call from a 
college official with questions about designing a wheelchair lift for a 
classroom building. Or a disabled resident whose landlord has renovated part of 
the apartment complex without providing ramps to the second and third floors. 
Or a family redesigning kitchen gadgets for the mother, who started using a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
Tessier said he was dismayed this summer when owners of a Montclair Plaza movie 
theater replaced the old seats but failed to provide access to wheelchair 
users, a violation of the state building code. Tessier had been going to the 
theater for years and sitting in the back, "hoping people didn't trip over me 
or spill things all over." 
</P>
<P>
After Tessier wrote several letters to the theater owners explaining the 
business advantages of providing access, the manager telephoned him to say the 
necessary changes would be made by winter, with input from Designs for 
Independence. 
</P>
<P>
Tessier said he has learned that "the biggest thing that can sell the business 
community to wheelchair access is that access means good business. There are 43 
million Americans with disabilities, the largest portion of whom live in 
California. The ones wanting to get ahead in this game are the ones that are 
going to get the business." 
</P>
<P>
The son of a lawyer, until five years ago Tessier was an able-bodied young man 
who attended a private high school in La Verne. But a bodysurfing accident left 
Tessier paralyzed from the chest down at the age of 16. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors thought there was a possibility he would regain some control of his 
muscles. His neck, broken during the accident, was slowly healing without 
requiring surgery. But two months into his recovery, as Tessier was being moved 
to another hospital bed, a nurse's aide accidentally dropped him, and he broke 
his neck a second time. Tessier said he will now remain paralyzed for the rest 
of his life. 
</P>
<P>
Remembering what it's like to be able-bodied has made Tessier more assertive 
than others when it comes to the rights of the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
After enrolling in Pomona College in 1986, Tessier was struck by how many 
places were closed to wheelchair users: bookstores, government offices, 
fraternity parties, dormitories. He soon became an active member of several 
disabled-rights groups. Now, he chairs the Committee on Disability in 
Claremont, which has awarded him a grant to study accessibility issues in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
His involvement in the community, coupled with the founding of Designs for 
Independence, led to his being awarded Time Magazine's College Achievement 
Award in April. It is given each year to 20 juniors in North America. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Tessier and his fellow recipients were flown to New York City, 
where he gave lectures on rights of the disabled and lobbied members of 
Congress on legislation that would restore Social Security benefits to some 
disabled people who lose disability benefits when they marry. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, Tessier said, clients will shun his advice and go with a cheaper, 
less reliable plan -- for example, wheelchair lifts instead of elevators -- or 
no access plan at all. Although ignoring access codes might be grounds for a 
suit, Tessier said, he refrains from threatening the company because he is 
playing the role of professional consultant, not of activist. 
</P>
<P>
"When a firm decides not to do the legal minimum there's a real conflict of 
interest," he said. "I feel ethically I can't use the knowledge against them at 
that time. But if that lack of access becomes an issue later on, if there's an 
accident for example, I'll be the first to offer my information."

FINANCIALLY STRAPPED OXNARD CHOPS 16 1/2 JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The biggest city in Ventura County is in the throes of a devastating financial 
crisis, with budget cutbacks reducing police patrols, closing fire stations and 
forcing the layoffs of at least four top managers. 
</P>
<P>
With little discussion, the Oxnard City Council voted unanimously this week to 
reduce department budgets and eliminate 16 1/2 city positions to slash this 
year's budget by $1 million and save about $1.5 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
"The medicine to cure the problem is like any other medicine," Councilwoman 
Geraldine Furr said. "It isn't pleasant to take, but it's necessary." 
</P>
<P>
The decision follows the discovery three weeks ago that estimates of revenues 
for the 1988-89 fiscal year were about $2 million too high. It also was 
disclosed that the city had exceeded its 1988-89 budget by $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
City officials scrambled to the reserve fund to replace the $2.8 million -- 
shrinking that fund from $5.8 million to $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The reserve fund, which held more than $12 million just four years ago, is set 
aside for emergency expenses, such as buying a new fire truck should one be 
wrecked or paying for unexpected litigation. 
</P>
<P>
The city hopes to institute the budget cuts and the personnel reductions, eight 
of them managerial, by Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Among the employees who have lost or are losing their jobs are Assistant Fire 
Chief Harold Conley, Assistant Police Chief Richard Staniland, Assistant to the 
City Manager Ken Hampian and Deputy City Atty. David Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
The city will try to transfer other employees, such as public information 
officer Kitty Dill, to different jobs, City Manager David Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
Other cutbacks include reducing residential street sweeping from once a month 
to once every two months, limiting the operating hours of the Carnegie Art 
Museum and discontinuing support of all festivals except the Strawberry 
Festival and the Fourth of July Fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
These decreases followed $1.9 million in cutbacks that the council instituted 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department has been forced since then to occasionally close stations 
because of manpower shortages. The firefighters union's 87 members have worked 
without a contract for about four months, unable to reach agreement with the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
And police response time for top priority calls -- when a suspect is in the 
vicinity, a victim is injured or evidence needs to be preserved -- has risen 
from less than 4.5 minutes during the 1986-87 fiscal year to 5.7 minutes, 
Police Chief Bob Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1986-87 fiscal year, an average of 16 1/2 police units patrolled the 
city of 128,000 people. In the last three months, an average of 12 1/2 squads 
have protected city streets. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Owens said, there are indications that the city's crime rate, 
which has dropped for 10 years, is rising again. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the public ought to be worried," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mora said city residents will not feel the new cutbacks as forcibly as they did 
when the June reductions were imposed. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm gutting here is the organization," Mora said. "I'm getting 
hard-pressed to make any more administrative cuts that don't leave us 
decimated." 
</P>
<P>
Mora said he spent last week briefing employees about the situation, attempting 
to dispel rumors of widespread layoffs that had filled City Hall in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Morale among employees is "zilch," Councilwoman Ann Johs said. 
</P>
<P>
City leaders are worried that Oxnard has a credibility problem with residents, 
Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
In a little-boy-who-cried-wolf scenario, Oxnard officials in 1985 imposed a 
utility tax after telling residents that city coffers were running dry. 
</P>
<P>
But when the city subsequently installed a new computer system, it found more 
than $12 million squirreled away in different funds. One city councilman was 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
This is different, council members warned. 
</P>
<P>
"There really is a shortage of money," said Councilwoman Dorothy Maron. 
</P>
<P>
Levying a new tax is a strong if politically unappetizing possibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's probably the only thing we can do," Johs said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has appointed an ad hoc citizens advisory committee on finances that 
will report to the council in January -- leaving enough time to put a tax 
measure on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The city, which prides itself on being the only local government in the county 
to court development, has yet to see the returns from many of its projects. It 
is going through a transitional phase, Mayor Nao Takasugi said. 
</P>
<P>
But while all involved agree that Oxnard must make some changes, there is 
little agreement on the reasons for the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
For the last four years, the council has made a "conscious decision" to draw 
from the reserves in order to balance the budget, Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
The budgets have increased because of an extensive street repair program, 
according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it came as a complete shock to all of us on the council," Takasugi 
said, referring to the financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Property tax revenues were short by $1.2 million and sales tax revenues were 
short by $700,000 to $800,000. Mora said the city was surprised when the bottom 
fell out of sales tax revenues in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year. 
He said he could offer no explanation for the drop. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Public Works Department overspent its budget by $600,000, and 
the Police Department went $250,000 over budget. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Johs said she blamed financial and management staff. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't keeping their eye on the store with overspending," Johs said. 
"That's gross mismanagement." 
</P>
<P>
Former City Councilman Michael Plisky, who left the council after losing the 
mayoral race to Takasugi in November, called the situation a fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no revenue shortfall that could not have been anticipated," Plisky 
said. "It's total incompetence." 
</P>
<P>
He said Mora was a master of "deceit and deception," offering budgets that 
council members Dorothy Maron, Manuel Lopez and Takasugi blindly blessed. 
</P>
<P>
But Maron said Plisky's claims were "baloney," while Lopez and Takasugi said it 
was Plisky's stumping to end the utility tax that created some of the economic 
hardships. 
</P>
<P>
The city lost $4.5 million to $5 million by eliminating the utility tax -- 
imposed during the last budget crisis -- in 1987, two years earlier than its 
scheduled phase-out. 
</P>
<P>
"First he creates the problem, and then he says it's our fault," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
Mora refused to comment on Plisky's charges. 
</P>
<P>
The city's explanation is that Oxnard lost several major revenue sources, 
including the utility tax, in rapid succession. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard lost $2.2 million a year in federal revenue sharing funds when that 
program was discontinued during the 1985-86 fiscal year, said Bill Mayer, city 
management and budget director. 
</P>
<P>
Another $1.5 million a year was lost when gas prices dropped, reducing the 
franchise tax the city collects on gas sold to Southern California Edison Co. 
for its two power-generating plants. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1988, Oxnard lost another $640,000 per year in drunk-driving fines that 
used to come to the city and now are claimed by the county. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Mora said, a bad deal with the Radisson Hotel continues to suck 
$750,000 annually from city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oxnard's Shrinking Resserves 
</P>
<P>
Even with layoffs and other cost-cutting measures instituted by the city in 
recent weeks, Oxnard's reserve funds will have plunged by nearly $10 million in 
just five years.

'. . . WHEN THE YELLOW-BILLED CUCKOO IS SINGING IN THE SYCAMORES, OUR WORK WILL 
BE DONE.' -- LEWIS MACADAMS; 
</P>
<P>
RIVER DEVOTEE SEEKS A REVIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Through a well-worn hole in a fence near Los Feliz Boulevard, Lewis MacAdams 
makes his way to the banks of the Los Angeles River and pads his way down the 
unnaturally sloped spillway toward a spot where his dream almost comes to life. 
</P>
<P>
Below, for a brief span, the Los Angeles River seems like a real river instead 
of a concrete parody of one. 
</P>
<P>
Ducks paddle among the tall blades of river grass and reeds. A grebe swoops out 
of the sky. A juvenile blue heron hops from boulder to boulder. Or could it be 
an egret? MacAdams may be a poet, a screenwriter and a self-taught student of 
environmental politics, but he makes no claim of knowing the classification of 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
Talking excitedly and almost nonstop, the Silver Lake resident invokes the name 
of one long-gone species almost metaphorically, as part of his poetic vision of 
what the Los Angeles River could be. 
</P>
<P>
"We call it a 40-year artwork," he said. "When the yellow-billed cuckoo is 
singing in the sycamores, our work will be done." 
</P>
<P>
Where politicians see a new truck route and engineers a flood control channel, 
MacAdams sees a concrete-entombed river waiting for resurrection. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to accept the fact that it is a river," insisted MacAdams, a 
44-year-old writer and self-appointed river spokesman who leads a small band of 
river devotees called Friends of the Los Angeles River. "We've just begun 
hassling," he promised, vowing to be a thorn in the side of the powers that be 
as he crusades to get some respect for the much-abused waterway. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we've accomplished very much yet," he conceded, "except raise 
the issue." 
</P>
<P>
Raising it he is. Consider MacAdams' river crusading during recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
He talked to an assemblyman from Los Angeles, representatives of a couple of 
national environmental organizations, a Long Beach city councilman and an aide 
for a Los Angeles city councilman. He complained to Los Angeles County about 
herbicide spraying along the river channel, took a high school class for a walk 
along the river, gave a commentary on a radio talk show and worked on an 
article for a weekly Los Angeles newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
A soft-spoken native of Texas, MacAdams has been preaching the resurrection 
gospel with particular zeal since Assemblyman Richard Katz recently raised anew 
a proposal to turn the concrete-lined riverbed into a freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Katz (D-Panorama City) envisions a river-bottom expressway that would carry 
buses, vans and car-poolers between the west San Fernando Valley and downtown 
Los Angeles, and would transport trucks between downtown Los Angeles and Long 
Beach Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
MacAdams, derisively referring to the "Katz Freeway," has a vastly different 
vision of the 51-mile-long river. 
</P>
<P>
He wishes that the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers would let the river channel's 
cement bottom crumble along vast stretches, giving way to sand and silt that 
would support plants. He wants the concrete sides replaced with rocks, 
advocates a greenbelt from Sepulveda Basin to Long Beach, and says trees should 
be planted in the upper reaches of the river's watershed -- in the San Gabriel 
Mountains -- to reduce runoff and erosion. 
</P>
<P>
He advocates storm-drain ordinances to clean up the street runoff that washes 
rafts of trash and debris into the river. He wants to see sycamore trees 
growing in the river bottom and steelhead trout swimming upstream. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an aberration that people hate a river," MacAdams said. 
</P>
<P>
A veteran of Marin County environmental skirmishes, with no scientific 
training, he moved to Los Angeles in 1980. A few years ago, he walked to the 
river with two friends, at a spot north of downtown Los Angeles, where the 
Arroyo Seco joins the Los Angeles River. "It was very easy to imagine it, at 
one time, one of the most beautiful spots along the river." 
</P>
<P>
Workers were repaving the river bottom, using "all these jackhammers and paving 
machines" as if they were on a runway at the Los Angeles International Airport, 
MacAdams recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked the river if we could be its human spokesmen. We didn't hear a no," 
added MacAdams, who acknowledges that his river philosophy may sound "kind of 
mysterioso." 
</P>
<P>
Moved by the revelation that "here was a concrete ditch that was actually a 
river," MacAdams staged a performance piece about the river and started the 
Friends of the River organization, which has about 300 people on its mailing 
list, nonprofit status and a technical advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles River rises in the southwest San Fernando Valley, where Bell 
and Calabasas creeks come together. It flows eastward along the northern base 
of the Santa Monica Mountains, runs through the narrows at Glendale past 
downtown Los Angeles and through the gritty suburbs of Vernon, Bell, South Gate 
and Compton, finally entering San Pedro Bay in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
It used to meander back and forth across the coastal plain, its mouth moving at 
the whim of a storm from Marina del Rey to the San Gabriel River. But such 
wanderings were annoyingly messy for the immigrants who also spread across the 
Southern California plains. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after World War I, the river's lower reaches were realigned and, 
beginning in the late 1930s, the Army Corps of Engineers started paving the 
riverbed, embarking on a massive flood-control project that moved 20 million 
cubic yards of earth and used more than 3 million barrels of cement. 
</P>
<P>
Now there are only a few miles of bottom that are not covered with concrete, 
between Willow Street and Pacific Coast Highway in Long Beach, a bit in the 
Sepulveda Basin and a stretch north of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The expanses of open concrete, much of it often dry, have proved more inviting 
to film crews and practicing bus drivers than to fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
Except in the rainy season, most of the river's water comes from hundreds of 
storm drains lining its banks and treated water from two sewage plants, 
Glendale and Tillman in the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the river flow has greatly increased in recent years as the Tillman 
plant has taken sewage formerly pumped to the overworked Hyperion sewage plant, 
which discharges into Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The two plants pump about 60 million gallons a day of treated sewage effluent 
into the river, making the Los Angeles River the largest source of fresh water 
emptying into the ocean along the Southern California coast, according to Henry 
A. Schafer, an environmental specialist with the Southern California Research 
Project, which conducts marine research. 
</P>
<P>
The discharge from the two plants approaches drinking water standards, 
according to the state Water Quality Control Board, but there is no consistent 
testing of the river's overall water quality, Schafer said. 
</P>
<P>
MacAdams considers the increased flow from the sewage plants a blessing that 
could help launch the river into a new, if not completely natural, life. "It's 
a typical Los Angeles situation, where you make a new reality. I'm just trying 
to deal with the new reality. It's never going to be like the Thames."

THEIR PICTURES HELP TELL OF PAIN;

<P>
ART: LEARNING-DISABLED STUDENTS TURN TO PAINTING TO EXPLAIN THE HARROWING 
CONDITIONS THEY SOMETIMES CAN'T TALK ABOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gigi Foller is trying to explain what it is like not to be able to count 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Stammering in frustration, the normally articulate 38-year-old moves first one 
way and then the other, gesturing with increasing futility and starting again 
and again before giving up with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
So she points to her painting, and the painting says it all. 
</P>
<P>
Titled "The Adventures of Jellowoman," the witty cartoon in four parts depicts 
a matronly supervisor casually asking Gigi to watch the cash register for a 
minute. Gigi -- depicted in the first panel as a mild-mannered librarian -- 
starts to dissolve, until in the last panel she is reduced to gelatin, her 
horn-rimmed glasses floating on the glutinous mass. 
</P>
<P>
Gigi is a student at Los Angeles Community College, and her painting is part of 
an exhibit of artwork by learning-disabled students at the school that is 
designed to explain their learning problems through art. The 10 artists whose 
work makes up the exhibit have constructed sculptures and paintings that use 
dark humor and harrowing images to depict what it is like to live with 
disabilities that many people do not believe exist. 
</P>
<P>
They are learning disabled, and they suffer from disorders as well-known as 
dyslexia, the reversal of words and letters, and as obscure as dysgraphia, the 
inability to write while thinking. They are all of average or above-average 
intelligence, but their brains have difficulty processing essential 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the artists in the show are adults. They have failed at careers 
or have found niches in professions where their disabilities don't matter. For 
virtually every one, the exhibit is something of a coming out -- the first time 
they have gone public with what they describe as their private nemeses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for me to explain why I have a teaching credential I can't use, why 
I've been careening through my life losing at different careers," Foller said. 
"Up till now I haven't had a hope in hell of telling anyone about this. It's 
been absolute hell since I was 4 years old. So you can see why I sometimes feel 
like the Jellowoman." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit is titled "A Picture Is Worth a Thousand Words," and it opens 
Wednesday. It is the climax of an art therapy program that began in the spring 
when California community college officials gave the learning-disabilities 
program at LACC $4,500 to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Matrenga, director of the 10-year-old tutoring and counseling program at 
the Los Feliz-area college, said she and her colleagues came up with the idea 
after noticing that some of their clients took notes by drawing pictures. After 
discussing the phenomenon with art instructors at the school, they decided to 
collaborate with the art department to seek a grant for an art show. 
</P>
<P>
When they are not organizing art shows, the two learning disabilities 
specialists who run the LACC program spend hours with students designing ways 
for them to learn. They find tapes of books for people who read painfully 
slowly, buy screens and gels for people who have difficulty reading under 
bright light and stock a large selection of audio and visual aides for all the 
students who seek their help -- this year 120 in all. 
</P>
<P>
The program is one of a number of such learning centers dotted throughout the 
California Community College System. Two years ago the system became the first 
in the country to adopt criteria for determining which students are 
learning-disabled. Beginning next fall, community colleges in California will 
ask them to identify themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The show will continue for a month. Matrenga also will hold a workshop in which 
learning-disabled students will explain their work to faculty and staff. 
</P>
<P>
If the experiences reflected in the show are typical, few teachers understand 
the students' difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
There is, for instance, the dilemma of Marianne Skalicky, 32, who suffers from 
an attention deficit disorder, a neurological problem that makes it difficult 
for her to focus on one thing at a time, and from scotopic sensitivity, an 
acute sensitivity to bright light. She said she has been unable to explain to 
teachers for years why she reads best in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
There is Kippen Melville, an actress who said she was so embarrassed about her 
disabilities that for years she didn't feel she had "the right to step on a 
college campus." 
</P>
<P>
And there is Richard Littlefield, a dyslexic who finds reading so painful that 
the painting he is exhibiting depicts a small Richard overwhelmed by a 
monster-size book. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in front of the mural-size work on a recent day, Littlefield read 
aloud a poem within the painting: 
</P>
<P>
 repeating nightmare child 
</P>
<P>
 A small me 
</P>
<P>
 overwhelmed in crushing 
</P>
<P>
 hurting, paranoid emotional devastation. 
</P>
<P>
 A small me 
</P>
<P>
 crying in anxiety 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in a monster 
</P>
<P>
 large book 
</P>
<P>
 knowing I can't get through to the end 
</P>
<P>
 crying in confused pain 
</P>
<P>
 a small me. 
</P>
<P>
 mommy daddy 
</P>
<P>
 save me 
</P>
<P>
"There's a great, big glitch in my computer program," Littlefield said. "I knew 
in my nightmares and in my daytime life that I just couldn't get through this 
great, big, huge book." 
</P>
<P>
The work being set up at LACC's DaVinci Hall Art Gallery draws the stares of 
passers-by. There is a sculpture of black tears, a painting of a woman moving 
her head left and right in a swirl of colors and a mixed-media work of a baby's 
head surrounded by a blur of indistinguishable words. 
</P>
<P>
As the exhibit takes form, however, the students talk not about the pain but 
what they have overcome. There is an intense closeness among students and 
therapist, which those in the program say has to do with gratitude and relief. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to start crying sometimes, crying in the anxiety of being sort of 
locked up within myself," Skalicky said. "But once you know what it is, it's 
like the whole world really opens up to you."

<P>
ASSURING BLACK CATS' SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two black kittens and two black cats now in the Pasadena Humane Society will 
have to wait until after Nov. 1 to find a home because of a moratorium placed 
on the adoption of black cats until after Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary ban on adoptions of black cats -- in effect this year from Oct. 
16 to Nov. 1 -- began eight years ago out of a desire to protect the animals 
from Halloween party-goers or cult members. 
</P>
<P>
The Humane Society advises owners to keep all pets indoors during the holiday. 
Owners are also advised to refrain from giving animals candy and sweets.

SYCAMORES SACRIFICED IN THE NAME OF SOCCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Has anyone noticed the sycamore trees down in the park off Stoney Drive in the 
Arroyo Seco? Well, take notice: the city of South Pasadena is chopping them 
down for the sake of a soccer field. Hundred-year-old trees gone forever so we 
can have another soccer field. 
</P>
<P>
It's not like the city has no place for children to play soccer. For the last 
year, all we have heard about is preservation. Here we have a good example of 
what's important and what's not in South Pasadena. These sycamore trees were 
planted in the 1890s by South Pasadena people for all of South Pasadena to 
enjoy, planted in a park where you would think they would be safe. Gone in one 
day, a living tree destroyed, because they need a few more feet for a soccer 
field, when in fact the children wouldn't know the difference. 
</P>
<P>
These trees took a lifetime to grow. They can never be replaced. We need to 
protect trees 50 years and older, or they will all be gone. What will stop them 
from cutting more down whenever they need to develop just a few more feet? The 
Arroyo Seco in South Pasadena is turning into one big serial baseball, soccer 
field, and we need to appreciate what we already have: a wonderful park with 
beautiful old sycamore trees that should be saved.

6 HEROIC CITIZENS HONORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lee Bibbie of Altadena, who saved a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy last 
August, was among six people whose heroism was recognized Monday in a 
"Courageous Citizens Award" ceremony at the Van Nuys Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Bibbie saved the deputy after an assailant struck him and tried to strangle him 
in a Palmdale bank. The attacker was convicted of forgery and sentenced to four 
years in prison, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Jones, 42, of Pasadena, who jumped into her car and chased a young man 
on a bicycle who had stolen her purse, also was honored. Jones eventually 
flagged down a patrolman, who arrested the thief. 
</P>
<P>
Four men were honored for participating in the capture and disarming of a 
robber: Samuel Luffman, 65, who was with his 97-year-old father when they were 
held up; Steven Kelley, a Sherman Oaks church custodian, and Antonio Perez and 
John Vallejo, employees of a Sun Valley termite extermination company. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner presented the awards.

TEENS WEAR RED IN STAND AGAINST ALCOHOL, DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first glance, it would appear that red ribbons and red medical bracelets are 
a hot new fashion item for local teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
But they're not. Across the country, this is Red Ribbon Week, a national 
campaign against alcohol and drug abuse that is endorsed by the Parent Teacher 
Assn., Mothers Against Drunk Driving and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of students in Long Beach and its surrounding communities are wearing 
red ribbons and bracelets. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not drink or use drugs for the week," is inscribed inside each 
bracelet, along with its wearer's signature. 
</P>
<P>
"They are to serve as a reminder of the countless young people who have been 
hurt or injured due to alcohol or drugs," said Jerry Shults, outreach 
coordinator of New Beginnings Adolescent Unit, a chemical dependency treatment 
center at Doctors Hospital of Lakewood, which is providing the bracelets. 
</P>
<P>
"The color red should represent all the young lives lost due to drinking and 
driving, overdoses, suicides and the many other drug and alcohol related 
deaths," Shults said. "Society cannot endure such an assault on its young 
people. With the red wrist bands serving as a constant reminder, how can one 
forget?"

CHURCH IS PRO-CHOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After months of work and numerous community forums, the governing board of All 
Saints Episcopal Church has adopted a pro-choice position on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The one-page statement affirms a woman's right to abortion as legally granted 
under the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe vs. Wade and states "that no 
law should be enacted to force an unwilling woman to give birth to an unwanted 
child." 
</P>
<P>
"In our efforts to construct a loving society, where unwanted pregnancies do 
not occur, we advocate responsible expressions of human sexuality in the 
context of love and commitment," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the policy Monday will enable the church to become active in 
events such as the Nov. 12 pro-choice march in Washington. The church may also 
take a part in lobbying the state Legislature, said Anne Peterson, executive 
assistant to the Rev. George Regas, pastor of the church. 
</P>
<P>
A pro-choice sermon by Regas in July sparked discussion about the church's 
stand on abortion and resulted in the policy's adoption. By its action Monday, 
All Saints becomes one of the few Protestant churches in Southern California to 
take a leadership role in the abortion issue.

10-SCREEN THEATER PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The developer of the One Colorado Boulevard project planned for Old Pasadena 
has announced that the project will include a 10-screen movie theater complex. 
The new theater would nearly double the number of movie screens in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Project developer Douglas Stitzel recently announced an agreement with AMC 
Theatres Inc., to build the new movie house at the corner of Colorado Boulevard 
and Union Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The One Colorado project is proposed for an entire city block containing 16 
historic buildings and bounded by Colorado Boulevard, Fair Oaks Avenue, and De 
Lacey Avenue, and Union Street. The theater will be in the same section of the 
project that will house three restaurants. Ground breaking for the theater is 
scheduled for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Other movie theaters in Pasadena include the six-screen United Artists theater 
called the Marketplace, in Old Pasadena, and the three-screen Mann Theater in 
Hastings Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
AMC Theatres, based in Kansas City, Mo., operates 284 movie theaters with 1,663 
screens in 27 states and the District of Columbia.

300 POLICE ON PARADE DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to avoid a repetition of last year's riot, an estimated 300 police 
officers have been assigned to cover the annual Halloween Parade on Hollywood 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Michael Woo and Hollywood Division Police Capt. Rick Batson 
said a command post will be set up on the boulevard from which the officers 
will try to exercise greater control of the throngs of people who flock to 
Hollywood for an evening of celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, Captain Rick Batson and I stood in front of smashed windows at the 
Brown Derby and vowed, 'Never Again,' " Woo said. "This year, we're putting our 
police resources on the line to back up that vow." 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 100,000 people took part in last year's celebration, which turned 
ugly when a riot broke out. Nine people were injured, and 28 people were 
arrested. Police said the disturbance caused about $50,000 in damages to a 
dozen restaurants and stores. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect this Halloween will be a return to normal on the boulevard, or as 
close to normal as the boulevard gets," Woo said.

FIRM APPEALS DENIAL OF PERMIT FOR INCINERATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has denied a permit to allow a 
chemical manufacturing company in Lynwood to continue burning hazardous waste 
in a small incinerator the company has operated at its plant for years. 
</P>
<P>
Emission tests show that Cargill Inc. failed to meet stringent federal 
regulations, according to the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which is appealing the ruling, may continue operating until the 
appeal process is concluded. The company is currently operating the plant under 
a permit from the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
Cargill employs 83 workers at its plant, which is in an industrial area on the 
east side of Lynwood, surrounded by residential areas. Cargill manufactures 
resins that are used in plastic and paint products. 
</P>
<P>
Cargill uses the incinerator to burn the waste gases and water generated from 
the resin manufacturing process. The incinerator must be able to destroy 99.99% 
of waste products or organic toxic compounds such as dioxane and formaldehyde. 
</P>
<P>
Test results in 1988 showed that the incinerator completely destroyed one of 
four compounds, said Lori Johnson, company spokesman. Test results were 
inconclusive on the other three, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
More recent test results for 1989 have been submitted to the EPA. The company 
expects the permit will be granted once EPA officials review the latest tests, 
Johnson said.

POLY HIGH SCHOLAR WINS BUSINESS CAREER CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Kim, a senior at Polytechnic High School in Long Beach, already is a man 
of many accomplishments. He is an expert in Korean martial arts, a three-year 
varsity tennis player, an award-winning speaker, a geometry tutor, a volunteer 
landscaper of the Sarah Center for battered and abused women, a summer computer 
operator for the Queen Mary and a talented violinist and concertmaster with 
Poly's award-winning symphony orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
And his resume just got longer. Kim recently walked away with $10,000, the 
first prize in a business career development contest sponsored by Executive 
Women International. He won with the aid of a videotaped interview, conducted 
by a local contest judge, and a notebook he compiled detailing his various 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
The straight-A student hopes his next stop will be one of four universities: 
Harvard, Yale, Stanford or UC Berkeley, where he wants to become an economics 
and pre-law student. His goals include earning a law degree from Oxford 
University as a Rhodes Scholar and later a master's degree in business 
administration from one of this country's top business schools. Kim 
acknowledges his goals are high: "Ambitious? Yes. Impossible? No."

TOXIC DUMPING IS CHARGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Atty. James Hahn has filed criminal charges against officials of a 
Westside furniture-manufacturing company accused of dumping hazardous materials 
near Ballona Creek. 
</P>
<P>
Among those named in the criminal complaint is Donald Lee Alderson, 40, 
president of Don Alderson Associates Inc. The firm makes specialty furniture 
for hotels, other businesses and residences at its facility at 3327 S. La 
Cienega Place. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn's office said charges grew out of an investigation by the Los Angeles 
County Department of Health, which found evidence of illegal dumping of paint 
and paint thinners at the plant after receiving a citizen complaint. 
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy City Atty. Teresa Luhan, who is handling the case, 
inspectors found evidence of illegal dumping on the ground along a chain-link 
fence behind the factory, which is located on an embankment overlooking Ballona 
Creek. 
</P>
<P>
"Paint stains and splatters were visible along the fence line, and paint stains 
were also visible on the creek side of the fence on the vegetation and bushes 
and running down the concrete embankment to the creek," Hahn said. "It appeared 
that the illegal dumping had been going on for some time, since the inspectors 
determined as they were taking samples that the paint contamination had soaked 
six to eight inches deep into the soil." 
</P>
<P>
Illegal dumping of such materials is a crime punishable by up to one year in 
jail and/or a fine of $5,000 to $100,000 per day of such activity.

COMPROMISE SUGGESTED FOR LONG BEACH FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Mr. (Arthur) Flemming's letter published Oct. 19, I am in agreement 
with the extension of the 710 freeway beyond its current terminus and assume 
that it was not originally extended due to the uncertainty of the route 
(through or around South Pasadena). Mr. Flemming raises a point which should be 
given adequate consideration. 
</P>
<P>
The residents of South Pasadena, or at least a very vocal percentage, have 
lobbied to keep the freeway from bisecting their community. Although only 
300-plus people were present for the anti-710 march, out of a city whose 
population is approximately 24,000, I believe the community's sentiment is that 
they would prefer no freeway to any alternative route. 
</P>
<P>
If this is indeed the case, the freeway should be extended to a reasonable 
terminus in an effort to relieve the congestion on many of Alhambra's surface 
streets as well as those of neighboring communities. In Pasadena that point 
seems to have been reached, California Boulevard. I assume very few residents 
of that neighborhood would argue for extension to Columbia Street, roughly 
three-fourths of a mile further south, on the northern border of South 
Pasadena. For Alhambra the situation is somewhat different. 
</P>
<P>
If the freeway was extended from its Valley Boulevard terminus, currently 
within the city of Alhambra, it would run through the East Los Angeles 
community of El Sereno, on the western border of Alhambra. It could be extended 
as far north as Kendall Avenue, on the southern border of South Pasadena, or 
more legitimately to Huntington Drive, a six-lane divided thoroughfare that can 
be traveled safely at 40 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Drive is nearly 1 1/4 miles further north than the freeway's current 
northern terminus and, I assume, could adequately accommodate the additional 
traffic with moderate planning and preparation. This would allow residents of 
Arcadia, San Marino, Pasadena and South Pasadena a route to bypass surface 
streets in Alhambra, San Gabriel, Rosemead and El Monte. The "thru" traffic 
would proceed north as it does currently, along Fremont Avenue or Fair Oaks 
Avenue, to the 710/210/134 on-ramps. 
</P>
<P>
I am sure there are many other issues to be addressed regarding this proposal, 
and I certainly don't expect the residents of El Sereno to adopt it without 
skepticism. But, as a compromise to the residents and commuters in the 
aforementioned communities, I believe it should be given consideration.

GLENDALE SHOULD ENCOURAGE BICYCLE USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As I ride my bicycle through Glendale running errands to the grocery store, 
library and other places, I find no evidence that city government knows of the 
existence of bicycles. I have no knowledge of a single bike path, much less a 
bike lane or even a street designated as suitable for a bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
Recreation and fitness cycling is showing explosive growth. The city fathers 
may not have noticed, but bicycles are no longer only used by children until of 
age to drive an automobile. They are becoming recognized by a growing 
population as the key to fitness. We are beginning to see tentative steps 
toward their use as a serious means of transportation whose obvious advantages 
of reduced traffic congestion and air pollution cannot be denied. 
</P>
<P>
What is needed is to accommodate bicycles on city streets so that their use 
will be encouraged. Other cities have done so. Among them are neighboring 
Pasadena and Los Angeles, which have included the bicycle in their plans. Why 
has the bicycle been ignored during Glendale's urban renewal plans? Why not 
include it?

WORKERS' APPEAL BOARD MOVE ANGERS LAWYERS; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: ATTORNEYS AND JUDGES CONTEND THAT THE AGENCY'S RELOCATION TO AGOURA 
WOULD WORK A HARDSHIP ON MANY INJURED WORKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON FARLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The proposed move of the 30-year-old Ventura Workers' Compensation Appeal Board 
out of Ventura County to Agoura has angered some local attorneys and judges, 
who contend that it would work a needless hardship on most of the county's 
injured workers. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the board's caseload consists of farm workers and other low-income 
residents in the Oxnard area, they say. Many of them are disabled and do not 
own cars, and the circuitous bus ride from Oxnard to Agoura would take at least 
three hours. 
</P>
<P>
Even those who do own cars would suffer, according to some attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"These people can hardly afford gas money to get to Ventura now. There is no 
way these people can get to Agoura," said Louis J. Vigorita, president of the 
Central Coast chapter of the Applicants Attorneys Assn., which represents 
injured workers. 
</P>
<P>
But an official with the state Department of Industrial Relations, the parent 
agency of the workers' compensation boards, dismissed those objections. John 
McGill, the department's director of ancillary services, insisted that public 
transportation would not be that inconvenient. 
</P>
<P>
Critics point out, however, that there is no direct public transit from Ventura 
to the Agoura area, 35 miles away in Los Angeles County. The court's present 
site on Ralston Street is on a bus line and is near the Ventura County 
Government Center. 
</P>
<P>
Getting to Agoura by bus from the west end of the county requires rides on 
three different bus systems. For workers in Fillmore or Simi Valley, there is 
no public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The move, set for April, is part of a statewide restructuring program for the 
board, which holds hearings for employees locked in disputes with employers or 
employers' insurance companies over injury compensation. 
</P>
<P>
McGill said the plan is an attempt to manage the surging caseload in the Los 
Angeles area. An Agoura office would handle many cases overflowing from the 
board's Van Nuys office, as well as all cases handled in the Ventura office. 
Such an arrangement would better service injured workers in both the western 
San Fernando Valley and the Conejo Valley, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But some court officials say Ventura County is large enough to have its own 
board. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see us have an operation in Ventura if we can," said Larry 
Greenblatt, presiding judge for the Ventura board. "That's based on my own 
emotions as far as the injured worker. There definitely should be a state plan 
to serve the needs in Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
Those in favor of the move agree with McGill that a growing population in 
eastern Ventura County and the western San Fernando Valley make Agoura, 
situated between the two, a logical choice for the new office. While the move 
would pose "a gross inconvenience" for workers in Ventura and Oxnard, those in 
Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks would have a shorter commute. 
</P>
<P>
But such workers aren't the ones who need the court the most, said Ventura 
attorney Carmen Ramirez, who represents low-income clients at Channel Counties 
Legal Services. 
</P>
<P>
"Agoura is in the middle of nowhere. Farm workers don't really live in Agoura 
or the Conejo Valley or Van Nuys. They live here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition, headed by Vigorita, has embarked on a letter-writing campaign 
and plans a lawsuit to attempt to block the move. A petition protesting it, 
with more than 300 signatures, was sent to Gov. George Deukmejian earlier this 
month. Vigorita said state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), Assemblyman 
Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) and Rep. Robert Lagomarsino (R-Ojai) have also 
written letters to the governor protesting the removal of the Ventura board. 
</P>
<P>
However, McGill said he doesn't foresee anything deterring the move in April, 
even a lawsuit. "Everybody's free to go into court. If they want to sue, then 
let them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 75-year-old Workers' Compensation Board has recently been under fire 
because it has become a bureaucratic maze. State legislators and administrators 
agree that the system is highly inefficient and look to Assembly Bill 276, 
signed by Deukmejian at the end of September, to overhaul the system. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation will add 12 new judges statewide, two for the proposed board in 
Agoura. Ideally, the new plan will allow judges to concentrate on handling 
trials by providing attorneys and other employees to take over many of their 
arbitration duties.

COMPTON BOARD LETS SCHOOLS CHIEF OUT OF CONTRACT

<TEXT>
<P>
In a special meeting last week, the Compton Unified School District board 
agreed to let Supt. Ted D. Kimbrough out of his contract so that he can become 
head of the Chicago public school system. 
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old Kimbrough has been selected by the Chicago school board to head 
the third-largest school district in the country. He is to assume his new job 
in January and will resign his Compton post the same month, although the exact 
date has not been set. Under his contract, which was good until June, 1991, 
Kimbrough was paid $97,500 a year. In Chicago, his annual salary will be 
$175,000. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released after its closed-door meeting with Kimbrough, the board 
said it would "miss his presence and effectiveness as a superb educational 
advocate" and that it was "deeply proud" of his administrative and educational 
innovations in Compton. 
</P>
<P>
The board did not say how or when it will begin looking for a new 
superintendent, school district spokeswoman Naomi Rainey said.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE DISMISSES CLAIMS BY STUDENTS OVER EXAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge this week dismissed three damage claims filed by students at 
Crescenta Valley High School against a national testing organization that 
invalidated their college placement examinations after some of the students 
cheated on the tests. 
</P>
<P>
In a pretrial hearing Monday, U. S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson dismissed 
students' claims that the decision by Educational Testing Service violated the 
California Education Code, that it denied students due process and that it 
caused the students to suffer emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson is expected to rule Monday on whether to dismiss the three remaining 
additional claims of fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract 
filed by the students against the testing service. The suit is scheduled to go 
to trial Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint was filed after the Princeton, N.J.-based organization 
invalidated the May exams when seven of the 79 students who took them were 
caught cheating. The suit asks for unspecified damages and for reinstatement of 
the test scores of students who did not cheat on the test. 
</P>
<P>
The testing organization agreed in August to pay the costs of readministering 
the test and sent letters to students' colleges explaining the reason for the 
delay.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: YOUTH, 17, HOSPITALIZED AFTER STABBING AT PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old youth remained in stable condition after being stabbed in the 
back during a birthday party at the Glendale Armory, hospital officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The victim told police that he is a former member of a Filipino gang and thinks 
that affiliation was the reason for the attack. At the time of the stabbing, he 
was wearing a black leather jacket with a gang insignia, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth, who is recovering at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Woodland 
Hills, was stabbed while standing in a crowd during a private party in the 
armory in the 200 block of E. Colorado Street at about midnight Saturday, 
police said. No arrests have been made, but investigators are treating the case 
as a gang-related incident. 
</P>
<P>
The stabbing was the second violent, gang-related crime during a Saturday night 
party at the armory in the past six months. A 17-year-old youth was seriously 
injured in a drive-by shooting on the armory sidewalk May 19.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VERMONT AVENUE WORK TO BEGIN WEDNESDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A project to renovate a 1 1/2-mile stretch of Vermont Avenue between the 
Griffith Park boundary and Los Feliz Boulevard is scheduled to begin Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 2 1/2-month project will include reconstruction of the roadway pavement and 
base material, replacement of street lighting, installation of a new curb and 
gutter system, and replacement of broken sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
The area slated for renovation provides one of the main access routes to 
Griffith Park's Greek Theater, Observatory and golf courses. The roadway has 
been refinished several times, creating a relatively uneven surface. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic will be detoured around Vermont Avenue between 7 a.m. and 3 p.m. during 
the project. Visitors to Griffith Park will be asked to use the park's Fern 
Dell Drive and Commonwealth Canyon entrances. Visitors to the Observatory will 
be asked to use the Western Canyon entrance. 
</P>
<P>
One side of the roadway will be under construction at a time. The west-side 
lane will be the first part to undergo renovation. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Vermont Avenue will have access to their homes every night but 
will be asked to move their cars or stay away from sidewalks during certain 
phases of the project.

CRESCENTA VALLEY STAR FALLS FLAT AS FALCONS SLIP PAST PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The play took only a few seconds, but that was more than enough time for 
Crescenta Valley Coach Jim Beckenhauer to ride an emotional roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
Beckenhauer watched in disbelief last Friday as Falcon receiver Aaron Erickson 
caught a 33-yard touchdown pass while lying flat on his back in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The pass appeared to have been intercepted by Pasadena's DeShawn Miles, but the 
ball dropped into Erickson's hands, giving Crescenta Valley a 17-13 win. 
</P>
<P>
"When he (Erickson) first ran the pattern I thought, 'All right, we got em,' " 
Beckenhauer recalled. "Then the kid (Miles) recovered and I thought, 'Oh, 
geez.' 
</P>
<P>
"So when the ball dropped into Aaron's hands, I couldn't believe it. There was 
6:48 left. I remember that distinctly because I looked at the clock and wished 
it was 1:48." 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons (6-1), off to one of their best starts, will play Glendale on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Net results: The La Canada High girls' volleyball team appears to have regained 
the form that helped the Spartans win four consecutive Rio Hondo League 
championships from 1984-87. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada, which finished second last season, was 8-2 overall, 6-0 in league 
play entering Tuesday's match against Temple City. The Spartans, who will play 
host to South Pasadena this afternoon, are 46-4 in league play over the past 
five years and have not lost a league match at home during that period. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best collective talent I've ever had," said La Canada Coach Bobbie 
Estes, who has been coaching volleyball at the school for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada is led by a trio of seniors, including setter-outside hitter Erin 
Weaver and outside hitters Amy Colyar and Jenny Pasqua. 
</P>
<P>
Title run: Hoover senior Eliazar Herrera was the top Glendale-area finisher in 
last weekend's Mt. San Antonio College cross-country invitational. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera placed third in the team sweepstakes race in a personal best of 15 
minutes, 7.4 seconds, finishing behind Agoura's Bryan Dameworth (14:41.8) and 
Arroyo Grande's Luis Quintana (14:45.9). 
</P>
<P>
Herrera's effort will make him one of the favorites in the Southern Section 4-A 
finals Nov. 18 at Mt. SAC. Herrera is expected to be challenged by Abe Valdez 
of Camarillo (fourth in 15:14 at the invitational) and Dave Hartman of Canyon 
(fifth in 15:15) for the title. 
</P>
<P>
Jump start: Tracey Wade of La Canada has qualified for a national equestrian 
competition that will be held next month in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Wade, 16, is one of 15 competitors who qualified for the National Horse Show by 
winning a medal in last month's McLay Western regional championships at the 
Flintridge Riding Club. 
</P>
<P>
Rebuilding blocks: Bill Garrison knew that rebuilding the once-proud St. 
Francis football program was not going to be accomplished in one season, but 
that didn't make last Saturday's 49-0 loss to powerful Loyola any easier to 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week was obviously very difficult to take, but I'm in for the long haul, 
not for just what happens in one year," said Garrison, who is in his first 
season with the Knights. "I do believe the program is continuing to take steps 
forward, though they may be very small steps." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola (6-1, 2-0) limited St. Francis (1-6, 0-2) to minus-three yards on 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Loyola) played football on Saturday," Garrison said. "I don't know what 
we played but it wasn't a whole lot of football. We need to start taking care 
of some of the things we can take care of." 
</P>
<P>
Things won't get any easier for St. Francis. The Knights will meet Notre Dame 
(6-1) on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The sun's going to come up," Garrison said. "That's what everyone keeps 
telling me." 
</P>
<P>
Passing phase: Claremont's game plan against Occidental last Saturday was 
obviously slanted toward stopping tailback Gary Little, the Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference rushing leader. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental Coach Dale Widolff wasn't surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on this year, you have to say, 'Let's make them throw the ball. They 
haven't shown that they can throw it well,' " Widolff said. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental, however, showed it could air things out as quarterback Tony 
Werbelow helped the Tigers to beat Claremont, 44-14. 
</P>
<P>
Werbelow completed 11 of 14 passes for 198 yards and threw three touchdown 
passes to tight end David Grossklaus. 
</P>
<P>
Getting defensive: Prospects don't look too bright for the Whittier Poets, who 
meet Occidental and the Tigers' top-rated defense Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Whittier's offensive line surrendered 11 sacks against Azusa 
Pacific, which cruised to a 31-6 nonconference victory over the Poets (1-6). 
</P>
<P>
Senior linebacker David Hodges has been a consistent performer all season for 
Occidental. The Tigers are also benefitting from the play of freshman 
linebacker Brent Blakeman and freshman safety Rick Mock, who have worked their 
way into the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's game at Whittier is the first of two contests between Occidental and 
the Poets this season. Under SCIAC rules, each team plays one opponent twice so 
Occidental and Whittier will square off again on Nov. 11 at Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like it," Widolff said, "but I like it over the alternative, which is 
either spending a lot of money to play someone out of the area or staying close 
to home and playing Division II schools, which are scholarship schools." 
</P>
<P>
You dropped a bomb on me: Glendale Coach John Cicuto says that there is nothing 
mysterious about his team's 26-10 loss to Los Angeles Southwest last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We had plenty of opportunities to score, but we just didn't execute," Cicuto 
said. "Everything that could go wrong kind of went wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Vaquero receivers had a particularly rough day, dropping seven passes. 
Quarterback Ronnie Lopez finished with nine completions in 23 attempts for 94 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"It was matter of them wanting to do it so bad, they just weren't relaxed," 
Cicuto said. "They make those catches nine out of 10 times."

LOS ALTOS HIGH'S BODEN MAKES RUNNING THE NAME OF THE GAME; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: THE CONQUERORS, LONG KNOWN FOR THEIR PASSING ATTACK, HAVE SWITCHED TO 
THE GROUND GAME ON THE HEELS OF ROGER BODEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the Los Altos High football program, the route to offensive success over 
the years has passed through the air. 
</P>
<P>
Confirmation of that can be found merely by glancing through the CIF Southern 
Section record book, which is blanketed by the names of former Los Altos 
quarterbacks Mike Smith, Dennis Sproul and Randy Hertel. 
</P>
<P>
In the offensive scheme of the Conquerors, the running game has usually taken a 
back seat. 
</P>
<P>
That is, until recently -- since running back Roger Boden joined the varsity 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
In two years, 17-year-old Boden has been among the rushing leaders in the San 
Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
As a junior he rushed for 1,164 yards and seven touchdowns in 172 carries, and 
this season Boden is the second-leading rusher in the valley with 1,082 yards 
and six touchdowns in 149 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Those numbers have brought about a noticeable adjustment in the Los Altos 
offensive philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had great passing teams over the years, but we're not too dumb to 
realize that if we have the running backs we have to let them loose," longtime 
Los Altos Coach Dwayne DeSpain said. 
</P>
<P>
While quarterbacks have generated most of the attention at Los Altos, DeSpain 
says the Conquerors have had talented running backs. 
</P>
<P>
The coach has little doubt where Boden belongs on the list: "We've had some 
great backs over the years and he's as good as any of them." 
</P>
<P>
At 5-11 and 170 pounds, Boden is not going to bowl over defenders. But Boden 
said he has flourished with 4.5-second speed in the 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always had the top speed in my class, but as a running back I rely more 
on my ability to shift balance, make slants and cuts and go across the grain," 
he said. "I can also see in the corner of my eye and know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
Added DeSpain: "He's got good speed but the thing that makes him a good running 
back is the ability to make you miss him. He has great agility and great 
balance and follows his blockers well." 
</P>
<P>
With Boden's increased success this season, and the team's greater emphasis on 
the run, the coach said the running back has been receiving considerably more 
attention from defenses. 
</P>
<P>
"He's more of a target now," DeSpain says. "You can see that they really go 
after him." 
</P>
<P>
Boden credits the experienced offensive line with a major role in his success: 
"I have faith in my linemen, that they're going to do the job. If they do their 
job and make the holes for me, I'm confident about doing my job. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel this year's offensive line is better than last year's. We're more of a 
team, playing better together. So I've been able to get more yardage." 
</P>
<P>
Boden also thinks he has developed: "I feel a little more confident this season 
because I've been here for a year, so I know what to expect. I think I've kind 
of learned what to do and what not to do." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Boden said, he is more instinctive than as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really think about what I do out there," he said. "I just react. Last 
year I'd get the ball and stutter-step a little and think of what to do, and by 
then I'd get tackled." 
</P>
<P>
Boden says he is comfortable with the team's increased emphasis on running, 
although he adds that the pass is still a key element in the offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think we have a lot more passing plays than running plays, but we're 
trying to balance it," he said. "I think the running is starting to catch up 
with the passing." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Boden, he is equally at ease as a pass receiver. As a junior he 
caught 15 passes for 215 yards and two touchdowns and he has 14 receptions for 
95 yards and one touchdown this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Running with the football and catching the football are my two favorite 
things, so I feel comfortable in either situation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That is one reason why DeSpain thinks Boden has the ability to succeed in 
college at the Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got soft hands and I don't think his size will affect him," he said. "I 
look at him as a can't-miss player for somebody." 
</P>
<P>
While college recruiters haven't knocked down his door, Boden said he has heard 
from a handful of schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten about 15 or so letters," he says. "They just write letters and 
wish me good luck." 
</P>
<P>
He said at this point in the season he isn't overly concerned about letters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's flattering to get letters from colleges but it doesn't really matter much 
until after the season is over," Boden said. "That's when you really see how 
much they're interested." 
</P>
<P>
From his perspective, as well as DeSpain's, Boden has played well enough to 
earn an NCAA Division I football scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm doing what I want to do," Boden said. "I want the scouts to 
see a good product, and if they see my game film I think they'll be impressed." 
</P>
<P>
Academically, Boden certainly fits the Division I mold as a solid B student. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping to go on to a Division I school," he said. "My first priority is to 
go to college and get an education because of my ability in football, but if 
I'm not lucky enough for that to happen I'll just go to school and get my 
education." 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, Boden has a more pressing concern: He has his sights set on his 
team's next opponent, Wilson, on Friday night at Wilson. It was the Wildcats 
who handed Los Altos its only defeat (7-0) on the way to a 13-1 season and the 
CIF Division IV championship last year, and the Conquerors are 7-0 and ranked 
No. 1 in Division IV again this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been waiting for this since they beat us last year," Boden said. "Last 
year we didn't really come to play. This time we're going to be ready." 
</P>
<P>
Boden, at least, knows that he will be ready to handle the football frequently. 
</P>
<P>
That's because with Boden in the lineup, the Conquerors no longer consider 
their running game as just a passing fancy.

More than 80,000 spectators are expected this weekend at the 1989 Point Mugu 
Air Show. The annual event Saturday and Sunday will showcase precision flying 
and aerobatic stunts by military and civilian pilots. 
</P>
<P>
The renowned Air Force Thunderbirds will highlight Saturday's schedule with a 
demonstration of flying skills used by Air Force tactical pilots in F-16 
Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's lineup includes a flight demonstration by the California Air National 
Guard and the Armed Forces West Parachute Team. Top civilian pilots will appear 
both days. Featured performers include Earl Cherry and the Roll Models, who 
defy gravity with a wing-walking act akin to 1930s barnstorming, as they 
perform loops and rolls at 170 m.p.h. with a rider on the wing. 
</P>
<P>
Other flying acts include newcomer Team America, a three-plane act that puts on 
a military-style show in red, white and blue Marchetti SF-260 airplanes, and 
Joann Osterud in a high-performance biplane. Osterud recently completed 208 
loops to break the women's and men's world record for outside loops. 
</P>
<P>
Other stunt-flying acts will include the Sierra Aces Aerobatic Team and the 
Skylark North Aerobatic Team, and ex-Navy pilot Wayne Handley will perform 
aerial maneuvers in biplanes and gliders. 
</P>
<P>
Also appearing will be the Los Angeles Police Department's dragster and drag 
racer Les Shockley in his jet-engine-equipped Peterbilt truck, "Shockwave." 
</P>
<P>
Gates open at 8 a.m. each day and close at noon if parking is full. The show 
lasts until 4:30 p.m. both days and is free. Grandstand seats are $3. For 
information, call (805) 989-8786.

AZUSA PACIFIC GRIDDERS AIM AT AN OFFICIAL FOUR WINS IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Azusa Pacific University football team, which has won three games in a row, 
will try to continue its winning ways when it visits Menlo for a nonconference 
game at 1:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa finishes the season with three road games, including Menlo. The Cougars 
play Cal Lutheran and UC Santa Barbara in the following two games. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars will face a Menlo squad that has a 2-4 record. The Oaks have lost 
four games in a row, including a 35-0 setback to St. Mary's last week. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa, 3-2, has actually won five games in a row although only three count as 
official wins by the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics. The Cougars 
had to forfeit a game against Occidental because of an ineligible player. Azusa 
also defeated the Cal Poly Pomona club team, although victories over club teams 
are not recognized by the NAIA. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Cougars have appeared strong in wins over Redlands, La Verne and 
Whittier. The team defeated Whittier, 31-6, last week behind a strong 
second-half passing effort from quarterback Brian Hunt. He completed eight of 
14 passes for 176 yards and two touchdowns, both to wide receiver Keven 
Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Pacific has been led on defense by a strong linebacker corps that 
includes Jeff Gustin and Phil Heppner, the team's leading tacklers. 
</P>
<P>
In other games matching four-year colleges Saturday, Claremont-Mudd-Scripps 
plays host to Redlands and La Verne visits Pomona-Pitzer in 1:30 p.m. games and 
Occidental visits Whittier at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Azusa Pacific men's basketball team has accepted an invitation to represent 
the United States in the annual Cup of the Americas tournament on Nov. 6-11 in 
Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars, a member of the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics, will 
be joined by five teams from Puerto Rico and squads from Brazil and Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
"We think this is a tremendous opportunity to represent the NAIA and our 
nation," Azusa Pacific Coach Terry Layton said. "It's a rare opportunity for 
our kids." 
</P>
<P>
Elon of North Carolina, another NAIA team, won the tournament last year. 
</P>
<P>
Layton said the Cougars were selected because of his experience as an 
international coach, including a season in the Puerto Rican professional 
league, and because most NAIA teams in the East start their season early, 
making the tournament difficult to attend. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona women's soccer team will have a pair of difficult 
assignments when it faces Cal State Dominguez Hills and UC Irvine today and 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, who have struggled to a 5-9-2 record as an NCAA Division II 
independent, will play host to Dominguez Hills at 7 tonight and visit Irvine at 
noon Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona will face a Dominguez Hills squad that entered the week with a 15-2 
record and is ranked No. 2 in Division II. The Toros have an explosive offense 
led by senior forward Kristi White. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine has also struggled with a 5-9-3 record but the Anteaters are a Division 
I team and have played a difficult schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona has been led offensively by midfielder Melissa Rogers and forward Amy 
Johnson.

JOHNSON SPEAKS SOFTLY, UNLOADS MANY BIG STICKS; 
</P>
<P>
CONTRADICTION: VENTURA COLLEGE'S ALL-AMERICAN CORNERBACK HAS DIVISION I 
POTENTIAL BUT HE WOULD RATHER TALK OF ACADEMICS, OR NOT AT ALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's Kyron Johnson's hour at Ventura College. He pulls up a chair, folds his 
hands on the table, and sighs. 
</P>
<P>
Yo, Mr. All-American defensive back, tell us how you're on your way to the big 
time. Next year you'll be playing about 80 miles east of here in the Rose Bowl, 
right? 
</P>
<P>
You say football is fun, but only there to provide you with an education? 
</P>
<P>
 C'mon, show us some of your gold jewelry, your fancy sports car. Surely you 
have a nickname, something like Neon, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
 You just try to play your best? You don't think you're really that talented? 
</P>
<P>
 OK, OK, Kyron. At least tell us about that interception last year during 
Ventura's 12-10 upset of unbeaten and fifth-ranked Moorpark. Defensive 
coordinator Steve Tobias said it was a "gigantic play," a pick that ended a 
Moorpark drive deep in Ventura territory and gave the Pirates the ball for the 
go-ahead score. 
</P>
<P>
 Never really had a good game? Made a couple of good plays against Moorpark, 
but got burned a couple of times, too? 
</P>
<P>
 Meet Kyron Johnson, a sophomore cornerback who is overwhelmingly modest in a 
day of flashy players with dollar-sign earrings. 
</P>
<P>
Secondaries are full of fast-talking, finger-pointing players. But Johnson is 
reserved, polite, and even helps the receiver to his feet after knocking him on 
his back. 
</P>
<P>
"He's kind of mysterious," said Marc Sherman, who coaches Ventura's defensive 
backs. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's ability, however, is obvious. And Ventura's coaching staff is more 
than pleased to see No. 23 roaming the Pirates' secondary. 
</P>
<P>
"He has everything it takes," said Sherman, a former Ventura player who played 
for Brigham Young's national-championship team in 1984 and started for the 
Cougars in '85. "He has good size, good speed, and he works hard." 
</P>
<P>
But three additional qualities impress Tobias, the defensive coordinator. 
Tobias demands his players "get to the ball, strike people, and run the (game 
plan)," and says Johnson accomplishes all three. Not only has it led to a 
defense that allows only 8.7 points a game on a team that is 6-0, but it has 
produced a Division I prospect in Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"Kyron is, by far, the most reliable guy we have when it comes to doing those 
three things," Tobias said. "There is no question about it." 
</P>
<P>
The only question was whether Johnson would wear a Pirate uniform after he 
graduated from Ventura High in 1988. Johnson was All-Southern Section, 
All-Ventura County, and All-Channel League. But, at 5-foot-9, 165 pounds, he 
was all-too-small for major-college football. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I just didn't convince anybody," Johnson said. "I didn't think I 
deserved a scholarship, but when all the hoopla sunk in, I said 'Wow, with all 
this, shouldn't I get something?' " 
</P>
<P>
Not according to the recruiters. Therefore Johnson, admittedly his own worst 
critic, looked in the mirror for answers. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought maybe I wasn't supposed to be playing this game," he said. "I felt 
that I couldn't compete." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was prepared to end his football career and study business at Cal State 
Sacramento. But Sherman used some of his hard-sell tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"He convinced me that I could make a difference and have some fun," Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
That show of confidence in Johnson, something Ventura College coaches say the 
player still lacks in himself, is what lured him. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a little down on himself and wasn't sure where he belonged," Sherman 
said. "I told him that he could do it. If he could believe it, he could do it." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson made an immediate impact as a starter last season and earned 
All-Western State Conference and All-State honors. He was a preseason 
All-American choice this season, another honor that baffles him. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really think I played that well last season," Johnson said. "This 
year I'm not exactly stinking the place up, but I'm not where I want to be." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of Johnson's perception, he is attracting attention. Oregon, 
Washington, Washington State and Colorado are following Johnson. Most of the 
attention derives from game films that show a bigger (175 pounds), hard-hitting 
player who has worked overtime in the weight room. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have proven to the recruiters that I am for real," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
But that's about as much as he will say about himself. Johnson isn't dreaming 
of playing in front of 100,000 fans in the Rose Bowl. He is content with a 
textbook and an opportunity for an education in international business or 
property development. 
</P>
<P>
"Football is just providing me with an education," said Johnson, who maintains 
a 3.24 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
That type of modesty might hurt Johnson in the recruitment battle. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a little bit too conservative for a cornerback," Sherman said. "Kyron 
will just hit you clean and walk away." 
</P>
<P>
But both Sherman and Tobias still feel Johnson will stride into a Division I 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"You sit down with the young man and you're going to like him," Tobias said. 
"You're going to know you're not bringing in a problem. You know this kid has a 
fair chance to play for you and he's going to be solid academically." 
</P>
<P>
And what do you think, Kyron? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, I guess I'm coming along," he said.

ATHLETE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The difficult part of the Frontier League schedule is over for Santa Clara 
High, and quarterback Tim Gutierrez allowed himself to muse about his climb up 
the Southern Section career passing-yardage list. 
</P>
<P>
A season-high 348-yard effort in last week's 45-35 victory over Agoura enabled 
Gutierrez to leapfrog from 11th to seventh on the list. Gutierrez, a 6-foot-2 
senior, has 5,906 yards and should move up to fifth Friday against Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
The top four will be more difficult to reach. They are current USC quarterback 
Todd Marinovich (9,182 yards); former USC and Ram quarterback Pat Haden 
(7,633); current UCLA quarterback Bret Johnson (6,653); and current San Diego 
State quarterback Dan McGwire (6,559). "It feels good being up there with those 
names," Gutierrez said. "They are all pretty much in the news." 
</P>
<P>
Successive victories over Santa Ynez and Agoura have put the Saints alone atop 
the league standings. Gutierrez, who is getting excellent protection from a 
line with only one returning starter, can chase the big names against lesser 
foes. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the most yards Gutierrez has passed for in a single game is 389 -- 
last year against Calabasas. STEVE HENSON

BIG KICK CARRIES EX-SOCCER PLAYER TO WIN; 
</P>
<P>
CROSS-COUNTRY: VENTURA'S ROMAN MORALES GAINS A MAJOR VICTORY IN THE MT. SAC 
INVITATIONAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you didn't hear anything about Roman Morales during the past track season, 
it's because the Ventura High senior spent much of the winter on the bench 
during the Cougars' soccer games. 
</P>
<P>
"As an inexperienced junior he didn't play much," said Bill Tokar, the 
cross-country coach at Ventura, "and didn't do too much (running) between 
cross-country and track." 
</P>
<P>
Now, after a summer of intensive training, Morales sheds his opponents almost 
as easily as he did his shin guards and cleats. 
</P>
<P>
In the Mt. San Antonio College cross-country invitational last Saturday at Mt. 
SAC, Morales won the individual sweepstakes race in a personal-best time of 15 
minutes, 23.6 seconds on the challenging three-mile course. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a good race there," said Morales, whose previous best was 
16:07. "I was just doing soccer for fun." 
</P>
<P>
Tokar said that Saturday's victory was a morale booster for Morales. 
</P>
<P>
"Every race he runs this year he gets more confidence," he said. "We just 
haven't been to a lot of the bigger races." 
</P>
<P>
A lack of big-meet experience didn't seem to affect Morales, however. 
</P>
<P>
After 1 1/2 miles, he pulled away from Paul Eley of Mills High in Millbrae and 
Venice's Danny Jordan to win by 13 seconds. Eley clocked 15:36 for second place 
and Jordan (15:41) faded to fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"From there on I just tried racing myself and my times," Morales said. 
</P>
<P>
While the Camarillo boys' team, ranked No. 1 in the state, was savoring its 
65-117 victory over No. 2 Concord De La Salle in the team sweepstakes race, 
Shannon Brusca, the Scorpions' fifth runner Saturday, was pulling for another 
team. 
</P>
<P>
On their way back to Camarillo, Brusca and Co. listened attentively to a radio 
broadcast of the USC-Notre Dame football game, won by the Fighting Irish, 
28-24. 
</P>
<P>
Brusca, an avid Notre Dame fan, found himself on the opposite side of the line 
of scrimmage from his teammates and Coach Mike Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us have turned into either SC, Pittsburgh or Air Force fans just to 
get to Shannon," Smith joked. 
</P>
<P>
Smith wasn't laughing, though, when he was standing at the finish line at Mt. 
SAC totaling the score of his top five runners. 
</P>
<P>
"You saved us!" Smith yelled at Brusca when the junior, normally Camarillo's 
No. 6 runner, finished in 21st place (16:07.6) -- the fifth and final scorer 
for the Scorpions. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Josh Gerry, who usually runs in the No. 5 position, was hampered by 
bronchitis and finished 108th. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope that Josh gets better before this is all over," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though seniors Abe Valdez (15:14.4) and Derek Kite (15:33.4) recorded 
personal bests at Mt. SAC, and Chad Malesich (15:59.5) equaled his own record, 
Smith said that his Scorpions feel they can run faster. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone is completely satisfied with what they did Saturday," he 
said. "They're hungry. There are some things out there that we want to 
accomplish that we haven't accomplished yet." 
</P>
<P>
Smith was talking about winning 4-A and state Division I titles. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo was third in the 4-A final in 1986 and '87 and second last year. It 
also has placed fourth in the state Division I championships the past two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't think about Mt. SAC that much," Valdez said. "It seemed like just 
another invitational. It wasn't anything. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just gearing up for CIF and state. It seems kind of easy now. I mean, at 
Mt. SAC we killed everyone."

EARTHQUAKE SHAKES UP SERIES PLANS FOR BOWEN 
</P>

<P>
Mike Bowen, a junior wide receiver at Nordhoff High, has tickets to Friday's 
World Series game, but he'll survive if he doesn't attend. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Bowen is happy he lived through his first attempt to see a World 
Series game. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 17, Bowen and his father attended what was supposed to be Game 3 in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
But an earthquake struck Candlestick Park and Bowen had more on his mind than 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been so scared in my life," Bowen said. "It was something I'll 
always remember." 
</P>
<P>
Bowen sat in the lower deck, anticipating the start of the game. He said he 
heard a load roar that he mistakenly thought was the sound of stamping feet. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my first time at the World Series and I was totally ecstatic," Bowen 
said. "I heard the pounding and the roar and I thought the fans were just going 
crazy. It got louder and then it was silent for a second. Then the whole 
stadium shook. It was just insane. 
</P>
<P>
"We were underneath the overhang of the upper deck. I thought it was going to 
come down and we were going to die. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing that happened was that everyone remained calm. They even 
cheered after it was over." 
</P>
<P>
Bowen said he didn't realize the damage the earthquake caused until seeing 
pictures on another fan's portable television. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in the parking lot for a good four hours trying to get out," Bowen 
said. "People were taking home fallen pieces of concrete as souvenirs. You 
could see the fires over the hillside." 
</P>
<P>
And after that experience, Bowen would rather concentrate on football. This 
Friday, Nordhoff, 1-6 overall and 0-2 in league play, will hold its homecoming 
game against Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it will rain and I'll get a chance to see it Saturday," Bowen said of 
the World Series. "But no more earthquakes. I wouldn't wish that on anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Just for laughs: A group of Santa Clara High players cornered sophomore Steven 
Klein and asked if he had any new jokes to tell. 
</P>
<P>
Klein stared at the palms of his hands and replied: "Nothing on hand." 
</P>
<P>
Meet Klein, team manager and punster extraordinaire. 
</P>
<P>
Nicknamed the "General" and "Koolmoedee"' after the rap band, Klein delivers 
one-liners before Coach Larry Lawrence instructs his players at practice. He 
also performs his schtick on return bus trips from away games. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a sample of last week's material: 
</P>
<P>
"Have you heard the joke about the bed? It hasn't been made up yet." 
</P>
<P>
"Have you heard the latest about the sidewalk. It's all over town." 
</P>
<P>
OK, Johnny Carson he's not. But Klein knows how to work his audience for laughs 
-- mostly moans and groans. 
</P>
<P>
"Our manager works hard," Lawrence said. "Koolmoedee tells a couple jokes and 
makes us laugh. He keeps practices from becoming monotonous." 
</P>
<P>
Add Saints: Santa Clara (5-2, 2-0) has plenty to laugh about after pulling off 
its second consecutive upset. The Saints beat Agoura, 45-35, a week after 
surprising Santa Ynez, 24-20, in a Frontier League opener. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints' special teams set the stage for the upset with two touchdowns in 
the first quarter. Kwinn Knight returned a punt 55 yards for Santa Clara's 
first score. Agoura answered with Dave Caramanis' 66-yard scoring run, but 
Knight returned the ensuing kickoff 89 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Medical update: Tailback Jayden Morrison, Nordhoff's leading rusher, is 
expected to play against Agoura after missing three games with a dislocated 
right elbow. . . . Santa Clara played last week without cornerback Danny Lopez 
(broken bone in left hand) and three linemen -- Justin Cajiuat (knee injury), 
Joey Cabrera (knee) and Joey Zargoza (foot). . . . Junior Lewis Cayce of Oxnard 
fractured his pelvis returning a kickoff against San Marcos and will miss the 
rest of the season. . . . Hueneme High might have one of its top offensive 
performers back in the lineup by next week. Tailback Mel Nunnery, out three 
weeks with a torn ligament in his left knee, may return Nov. 3 against San 
Marcos. Quarterback Damon Hicks (bruised right shoulder) and receiver/back Doug 
Brooks (bruised knee) are doubtful to return. 
</P>
<P>
Football miscellany: Nordhoff quarterback Rob Fournier needs 44 yards to erase 
the school's single-season passing record. Jeremy Anthony set the record with 
1,243 yards last season. . . . Trevor Matheson, Fournier's favorite target, 
needs one reception to tie the school mark of 43 set by Steve Blundell last 
season. . . . Al Borderias, a transfer student from Spain, has replaced Johnel 
Turner as the Oxnard kicker. In two games, Borderias has made nine of 10 
extra-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Numbers game: The Western State Conference football race has produced some 
interesting numbers, through most of them look remarkably alike. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, L. A. Southwest and Moorpark are each 1-0 in Northern Division games. 
The Pirates (6-0 overall) are 5-0 in the WSC and Southwest (5-0-1) is 4-0-1. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura is ranked sixth in the state and Southwest is eighth. The teams are 
ranked third and fourth in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura has the state's fourth-best defense (210.5 yards a game) and Southwest 
is eighth (238.2). 
</P>
<P>
Breaking in: After a record-setting career at Santa Clara High, Matt Young has 
been somewhat less prolific as a freshman wide receiver for Moorpark College. 
Last week, however, he caught his first college touchdown pass. 
</P>

In the third quarter of a 44-0 blowout of Harbor College, Young tipped a pass 
to himself to complete an 18-yard touchdown pass from Kris Dutra. "He made a 
tremendous catch," Coach Jim Bittner said. "It was a very nice play on his 
part. He's got very good hands."

Young caught 81 passes as a Santa Clara senior, but at Moorpark he's part of a 
four-receiver rotation. Young alternates possessions on the right side with 
sophomore James Gambrell.

BUSH PESTICIDE PLAN RAISES CONCERN FOR STATE LAWS 
</P>

<P>
President Bush will announce a seven-point package today intended to strengthen 
the nation's laws and regulations involving the use of pesticides on food 
products, but environmental activists expressed alarm that the initiative could 
preempt more stringent state regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which would require legislation to be submitted to Congress later 
this year, was hailed by Administration officials as a move to give regulatory 
agencies authority to move with more dispatch in dealing with food safety 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
Although only a broad outline of the program was available Wednesday, 
environmental officials reacted hotly to a provision that is expected to 
prevent California and other states from adopting standards more restrictive 
than those contained in the proposed federal law. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a wolf in sheep's clothing," said Rick Hind of the U.S. Public Interest 
Research Group. 
</P>
<P>
Similar criticism was voiced on Capitol Hill and by California 
environmentalists, who said that it appeared the package would do more to 
protect food producers than to protect food. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials declined to divulge details of the proposals, but the 
head of the Environmental Protection Agency hailed the initiative as a strong 
step toward speedy action in cases where the use of chemicals could endanger 
food safety. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said, "is responsive to a number 
of problems this agency has had in administering our pesticide law." 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the proposals would sharply reduce the time it takes the 
government to remove a potentially dangerous pesticide from the market and that 
it would allow the EPA to halt the use of agricultural chemicals thought to be 
hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
But environmental groups had hoped the Administration would take a tougher 
stance. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the revisions are likely to become an issue in the gubernatorial 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"The heart of this proposal is to preempt the right of Californians to set food 
safety tolerances," said Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who chairs 
the political and environmental coalition pushing a sweeping 1990 ballot 
proposition that would outlaw any known cancer-causing chemical in foods. 
</P>
<P>
One of the chief authors of the proposition is California Atty. Gen. John K. 
Van de Kamp, who said Wednesday that any plan that would preempt the state's 
ability to act on pesticides and food safety is "simply unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a states' rights issue," Van de Kamp said. "If Californians want to 
ban cancer-causing pesticides, we should have that power." 
</P>
<P>
He called on members of the California congressional delegation to oppose the 
Administration proposals. 
</P>
<P>
One member of the California delegation expected to challenge the 
Administration plan is Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the 
House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the environment. Waxman 
has introduced his own bill, which is far more restrictive than the plan 
expected to be announced by the White House today, and he plans subcommittee 
hearings next month. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for Sen. Pete Wilson, a Republican who is running for governor, 
sharply criticized the move toward preemption of state authority. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to cause an uproar," Wilson Press Secretary Bill Livingston 
said. In San Diego, Wilson spokesman Otto Bos said that if the Administration 
proposal weakens state authority, "Pete Wilson will oppose it as he always has. 
</P>
<P>
"California has tougher laws on pesticides than the nation as a whole, and Pete 
has in the past voted against attempts to preempt the state laws with federal 
law," Bos said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides preventing the state from going beyond federal law, sources said that 
Bush's proposal would provide for a weighing of cancer risk versus the 
perceived benefits of pesticide usage, a standard fiercely opposed by 
environmentalists. Just as the Exxon Valdez oil spill created a furor over 
offshore drilling, the use of the growth-enhancing chemical Alar on apples 
created nationwide concern about food safety earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Although Alar is not a pesticide, public concern over its possible cancer risks 
eventually forced the chemical off the market. The scare passed rapidly, and 
the EPA's Reilly has said that a rapid restoration of public confidence in 
apple supplies is evidence of the credibility of the environmental agency. 
</P>
<P>
As the outlines of the Bush proposals began to circulate Wednesday, Al 
Meyerhoff, a senior attorney for the Environmental Resources Defense Fund in 
San Francisco, said the plan is "nothing more than putting a happy face on a 
program that is already bankrupt." 
</P>
<P>
"This will do nothing to prevent future Alars," he said. "We will have sons of 
Alar for years to come."

CONGRESS VOTES $3.45 BILLION IN QUAKE RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Racing against a midnight deadline, Congress approved a record $3.45-billion 
earthquake relief package for California on Wednesday and sent it to the White 
House as part of a stopgap spending bill to keep the federal government in 
business through Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
The package, which emerged from the Senate with $600 million more than the 
House originally approved, was expected to be signed into law by President Bush 
as soon as it reaches his desk. 
</P>
<P>
"I am advised that the President will sign it," said Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va), 
chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Passed overwhelmingly by a 97-1 vote in the Senate, the package is the largest 
ever appropriated by Congress for reconstruction and relief in the wake of a 
single disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Last-minute back-room bargaining with Rep. Jamie Whitten (D-Miss), the powerful 
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, held up the start of the final 
floor vote in the House. However, in the end the House moved quickly to approve 
the package by a vote of 303-107. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators were working against the clock because the package was part of a 
bill to extend the government's spending authority beyond a midnight deadline. 
The stopgap measure now permits federal agencies to continue functioning 
through Nov. 15, when Congress hopes to have work completed on the 11 still 
unfinished appropriations bills before it. 
</P>
<P>
More generous than the initial House version passed Tuesday, the final 
House-Senate package provides California with $1.1 billion in new federal 
disaster funds, $1 billion in emergency highway funds and access to a 
$250-million discretionary fund to be managed by the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Like the first package, it also provides an additional $500 million in loan 
authority for the Small Business Administration. But unlike the less expansive 
House version, it also raises a $1.2-billion ceiling on SBA emergency loans to 
$1.8 billion -- effectively adding $600 million to the package. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly for Northern California, the package waives several federal 
rules, left intact in the earlier House version, that would have restricted use 
of the money in some cases and required matching state and local funds in 
others. 
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely pleased. We wound up getting nearly everything we asked for," 
a California legislative aide who worked on the package said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the accounting is so complicated that some legislators predicted 
California could end up getting significantly more money out of the package, 
Sen. Alan Cranston said the state "will be eligible to receive immediately 
$3.45 billion." 
</P>
<P>
"We've received what we need for the moment, and if we need more, we'll come 
back later," he said. Congress "sends an important message to Californians when 
the federal government responds so quickly and humanely to such disasters." 
</P>
<P>
Among the restrictions waived in the final version were a $100-million cap on 
federal aid available to any single state for emergency highway repairs, a 
regulation barring toll bridges such as the quake-damaged Oakland Bay bridge 
from receiving federal repair funds, and a deadline that requires states to 
match any federal disaster money that is not spent within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we're changing the law with respect to budget formula and timing," 
said Sen. Pete Wilson, who added that the $100-million road repair cap was 
unrealistic because "repairs on the Nimitz Freeway alone would have exceeded" 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Although the final package was less than the $3.85 billion California initially 
requested, most of the state's legislators said they were fully satisfied with 
the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tremendous amount of good will and we thank all of you," said Rep. 
Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), who led the California delegation's unsuccessful 
fight to get the larger package approved in the House earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
That effort was stalled in the House Appropriations Committee by Whitten and 
Rep. Silvio Conte of Massachusetts, the committee's ranking Republican, who 
balked at accepting all of the sweeping waivers that California sought without 
further consideration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Panel Members Yield 
</P>
<P>
However, with the countdown to a federal shutdown underway, the Senate solidly 
in support of California's requests and the White House signaling its approval, 
the two Appropriations Committee members gave way. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end, they weren't willing to be cast as the Scrooges who shut down the 
federal government and denied urgently needed relief assistance to the 
residents of California, and we were counting on that," one California 
legislative aide said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to go for what you can get, and we've done that," Fazio said. 
</P>
<P>
The appropriation comes on top of the $1.1 billion that Congress authorized 
earlier this month to help the victims of Hurricane Hugo. While some of the 
money in the latest package could also be used for Hugo assistance, the lion's 
share -- more than 90% -- is expected to go to California, where still 
incomplete damage estimates exceed $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Several legislators warned that California may have to come back to Congress 
for more money as the true scope of the disaster becomes clearer. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very likely that the ultimate federal cost . . . may be higher as the 
damage estimates continue to grow," Cranston said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Gordon Humphrey (R-N.H.), who cast the lone negative vote against the 
package in the Senate, said he did so because of fears that it would fuel the 
nation's deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"The Senate should have first identified the source (of the money) before 
spending it," he said.

CHILDREN TO GET AIDS DRUG AZT UNDER NEW RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan is expected to announce 
today that the Food and Drug Administration will make the antiviral drug AZT 
available to children under 13 who are suffering from AIDS or advanced 
infection with the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
The government has been under increasing pressure to make AIDS treatments more 
available to children. Until now, youngsters have not had access to AIDS 
medications because it has been long-standing FDA policy that no drug can be 
tested on or made available to children until it has been tested on and 
approved for adults. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that this will set the stage for the rapid approval of other new drugs 
for children, and that they will not have the 2 1/2 or three-year time lag 
between approval for adults and approval for children," said Susan DeLaurentis, 
co-founder of the Los Angeles-based Pediatric AIDS Foundation, which raises 
money for pediatric AIDS research. 
</P>
<P>
AZT, approved for adults in 1987, has been tested on more than 200 children, 
and some clinical trials are still under way. Once a drug has been approved for 
sale, physicians often prescribe it as they see fit, even for unapproved uses. 
But many doctors have been reluctant to give AZT to children, fearing that its 
side effects might be too severe for young patients. 
</P>
<P>
AZT can cause toxic reactions, including severe anemia that must be treated 
with blood transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
The pediatric trials of AZT have shown that its side effects in children are 
similar to those in adults, according to a Department of Health and Human 
Services source who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The studies also indicated that AZT produces the same benefits in children as 
in adults: It prolongs survival, relieves symptoms and enhances the quality of 
the patient's life, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
The drug will be made available to children as a Treatment IND, or 
investigational new drug, a designation that permits widespread use of a drug 
for compassionate reasons while research continues. 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs Wellcome Co., the drug's manufacturer, said it will make the drug 
available at no cost under the Treatment IND classification. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the children afflicted with AIDS, however, are inner-city minorities 
whose parents may not have insurance or qualify for Medicaid. Such families may 
not be able to afford the high cost of the drug once it receives FDA approval. 
AZT therapy costs about $6,500 a year since a recent 20% price cut. 
</P>
<P>
"Science cannot resolve these social and political problems," said Mathilde 
Krimm, founding co-chairman of the American Foundation for AIDS Research. "The 
best drugs in the world will be worthless unless people can get to them. One 
can doubt, at the present cost of the drug, that it will reach them." 
</P>
<P>
So far, 1,859 cases of AIDS in children have been reported since the disease 
was identified in 1981, and about 800 children currently are living with the 
disease. No reliable estimate of the number of children infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus is available; it has been estimated that perhaps 1.5 
million Americans of all ages may be infected. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been an ongoing desire on the part of the FDA and the company to 
find a way to make this drug available to kids, realizing that the safety 
question is perhaps a more difficult question to address," another Health 
Department source said. "Also, perhaps the dosage size will have to be scaled 
down for kids." 
</P>
<P>
The company recently announced that it soon will make AZT available in a 
strawberry-flavored liquid form that "will make it much easier to give to 
kids," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Pediatric AIDS groups and others applauded the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many children who, up to this point, have been unable to access 
any kind of treatment, so this will be a good thing for those children," said 
Susan Campbell, assistant director of the Washington office of the American 
Academy of Pediatrics and chairman of the Pediatric AIDS Coalition, a group of 
25 national pediatric AIDS organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"It is also a mark of recognition of the exploding problem among infants, 
children and adolescents," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Peters Wilson, director of government relations for the National Assn. of 
Children's Hospitals, said that "many children's hospitals have been . . . 
extremely concerned about their ability to provide the full and most 
appropriate treatment for children -- and will welcome the opportunity now to 
be able to do so." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce 
subcommittee on health and the environment, said that "pediatric AIDS drugs are 
long overdue." 
</P>
<P>
"It may never be a big market, but we have a moral obligation to find out their 
safety and effectiveness," Waxman said. "I hope that these delays won't be 
repeated in the future."

NEW INS CHIEF OPPOSES DITCH ALONG BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In his first public appearance since his Senate confirmation, Immigration and 
Naturalization Service Commissioner Gene McNary said Wednesday that he opposes 
a controversial proposal to dig a 4-mile ditch along the U.S.-Mexican border 
near San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the ditch is a very good idea," McNary said at a press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he favors any form of physical barrier along the Mexican border, 
McNary said that he wants to look at that possibility. But, in another apparent 
reference to the ditch, he added: "Some of the suggestions made heretofore, I'm 
not locked into them." 
</P>
<P>
The new immigration commissioner said also that he plans to visit the Soviet 
Union to determine the extent of persecution of Jews in that country and plans 
to meet with advocacy groups who have been critical of the INS in the past. 
</P>
<P>
His comments on the border ditch appeared to doom the controversial proposal, 
which was supported by former INS Commissioner Alan C. Nelson but condemned by 
immigrant rights groups and the Mexican government. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate decision on the ditch rests with Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, who 
is still considering it as an option, David Runkel, his spokesman, said. "He's 
not made any final determination," said Runkel, who set no timetable for a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ditch would be 14 feet wide and 5 feet deep and would extend along 
a 4-mile stretch of the Otay Mesa, a broad expanse of flat arid land east of 
the port of entry at San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
The concept, originally proposed as an environmental project to catch rainwater 
runoff, was taken over by the INS early this year because of its potential for 
curbing illegal immigration and drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. authorities have said that hundreds of vehicles carrying illegal 
immigrants and drugs go across the border in that region each month. But the 
number has declined considerably since earlier this year, according to 
immigration officials in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Detractors likened the ditch proposal to a U.S. version of the Berlin Wall, 
contending that the physical barrier would emphasize divisions between the 
United States and Mexico at a time when Mexico City and Washington are working 
toward improved relations. 
</P>
<P>
An INS official said McNary's statement means that the agency is unlikely to 
proceed with its plans for the $2-million excavation project. "The idea has 
just died a natural death," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, word of McNary's opposition to the ditch was applauded by some of 
the project's opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm delighted that he has taken that position," said Bob Filner, a city 
councilman who has argued against the project. "I hope we're going in the 
direction of doing something that's acceptable to both governments." 
</P>
<P>
In his comments on Soviet Jews, McNary said that one of his initial priorities 
will be a visit to the Soviet Union to determine if Jews who want to immigrate 
to the West are still being persecuted. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he wants to study the reforms initiated by Soviet leader Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev and assess the level of intimidation experienced by Jews in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Under previous U.S. policy, virtually any Soviet citizen who obtained 
permission to leave the country was granted refugee status and admitted to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
In September, however, the Bush Administration adopted new rules that limit 
immigration to applicants who have parents, children, brothers, sisters or 
spouses living in the United States. Some exceptions are allowed for cases "of 
special concern to the United States." 
</P>
<P>
The new policy was adopted after U.S. officials realized that recent Soviet 
reforms had resulted in more applications by Soviet citizens to enter this 
country than immigration officials could handle. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern is what's happening to those Soviet Jews who want to come to this 
country," McNary said, adding that he wants to determine if the Soviet 
government is persecuting or intimidating those seeking to move to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the things I'd like to go to Moscow to see. I think we need 
first-hand observations of the situation in Moscow." 
</P>
<P>
McNary did not address what policies he would advocate if his observations led 
him to believe that persecution of Jews is not as widespread as once believed. 
</P>
<P>
McNary said his early goals include meeting with advocacy groups concerned 
about the rights of illegal immigrants and grappling with the agency's 
administrative problems.

SEN. TORRES SAYS HE WAS TREATED FOR ALCOHOLISM

<P>
State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), arrested last month on a second 
drunk-driving charge, said Wednesday he is an alcoholic and has completed a 
25-day treatment program. 
</P>
<P>
Torres, 43, an influential political leader in the California Latino community 
and widely considered one of the brightest and most energetic members of the 
Legislature, said he realized after his last arrest that he is suffering from 
alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a recovering alcoholic," Torres said in an interview in his Capitol 
office. "I thought I could control it by myself, but this is a disease that you 
can't control by yourself. I wasn't willing to admit that I had a problem." 
</P>
<P>
The East Los Angeles Democrat became the second state legislator in the last 
three months to publicly acknowledge seeking treatment for alcoholism. Sen. 
Bill Greene (D-Los Angeles) missed part of the legislative session when he 
sought treatment at the end of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said that three days after the Legislature adjourned Sept. 15 he 
enrolled as a day-patient in Starting Point in Sacramento. He said he attended 
therapy sessions for 25 days and returned home at night and on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said he attends meetings of a self-help group as part of his recovery. 
He said drinking did not impair his performance as a legislator. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that it didn't affect my performance," Torres said. "I don't know why. 
Maybe it is because I am so hard-driving or because I am so ambitious about the 
issues I care about." 
</P>
<P>
Torres, elected to the Assembly in 1974 and to the Senate in 1982, has been 
considered a rising political star in California and has been mentioned as a 
potential candidate for governor. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview in his Capitol office, Torres said he has not yet assessed the 
political impact of his second drunk-driving arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not a quitter," he said. "I believe that anything can be overcome if you 
are honest and forthright with people, but at this point I am not really 
considering a statewide run. I can perceive only one day at a time. Time will 
tell whether I am a viable candidate down the road anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Torres said he does not use drugs and seldom consumed hard liquor. He said he 
drank red wine "once or twice and week and on weekends with friends or staff in 
a social setting, usually at the end of a long day." 
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker was first arrested for drunk driving in July, 1987, when his car 
nearly crashed into a Sacramento police vehicle parked with its emergency 
lights flashing. 
</P>
<P>
He pleaded no contest, paid an $827 fine and was placed on probation for three 
years. One condition of probation was that he not refuse to take any future 
chemical tests to determine a blood-alcohol level. 
</P>
<P>
In the early hours of Sept. 6, Torres was arrested on a drunk-driving charge 
after leaving a Sacramento restaurant. The arresting officer said the lawmaker 
refused to take a field sobriety examination, "could not perform" a breath test 
and refused to take any other test. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Steve Masuda said the customary punishment for a second 
drunk-driving conviction is a fine and penalties totaling $1,320, 10 days in 
jail that can be served on weekend work projects and four years of probation. 
</P>
<P>
Torres also faces suspension of his driver's license for two years by the 
Department of Motor Vehicles, an action he said he will fight. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his first arrest two years ago, Torres told colleagues in the 
Legislature that he had made "a mistake and I paid for it" and "now is the time 
for me to learn" that "drinking and driving are a bad combination." 
</P>
<P>
Reminded of those remarks, Torres said people will have to judge him not by his 
words but by the actions he will take "from this day forth."

'90 CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR RACE SEEN AS KEY TO REDISTRICTING 
</P>

Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater said Wednesday that next year's 
California gubernatorial campaign will be the "No. 1 race" in the country 
because of its potential impact on the nationwide struggle for reapportionment 
of congressional seats. 
</P>
<P>
As things stand in the competition for the seat, Republican Gov. George 
Deukmejian will vacate after two terms and U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson is all but 
assured the Republican nomination. Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp is the likely 
Democratic standard bearer, although ex-San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein is 
also given a chance for the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is that reapportionment is our No. 1 national goal," Atwater told a 
Times Washington Bureau breakfast. "I can go to Indiana or South Carolina or 
anywhere else and say our No. 1 national race in the country is the Pete Wilson 
race because the governorship of California has more than any other single 
thing to do with the national reapportionment than anything I can think of." 
</P>
<P>
Republicans see the redrafting of congressional district lines after the 1990 
census as a critical opportunity for gaining ground in the House, which they 
have not controlled since 1954. The biggest change will take place in 
California, which is expected to add five or six seats to its present 
contingent of 45. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans are still smarting from the post-1980 Democratic reapportionment in 
the state, which they claim cost them four or five seats. At that time, 
Democrats controlled the governorship as well as both houses of the 
Legislature. The GOP is hoping to avoid a similar debacle after the 1990 census 
by electing a Republican to replace Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater said that California also could have an important role in the 1992 
presidential election if legislation to move its June presidential primary to 
March is revived in the Legislature next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think California is not a player in the process now," he said. "But if this 
bill passes, then California will go from being a non-player to the absolute 
critical player in the process and it will absolutely change the way the whole 
game is played." 
</P>
<P>
He said that he is uncertain about the long-term impact of the abortion issue 
on Republican strength. In two current gubernatorial races, in New Jersey and 
Virginia, two Republican contenders are being hurt by their opposition to 
abortion. Attention to the issue at the state level increased after the Supreme 
Court in June opened the door for states to restrict abortions. 
</P>
<P>
But Atwater contended: "I think that you'll have to look state by state to see 
how this issue is going to play out. I do not think it will be a driving 
national issue in the 1990 campaign, particularly, and I certainly do not think 
it will be a driving issue in the 1992 campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on another social issue front, Atwater disclosed an apparent 
widening in the rift between him and Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) 
over the party's stance on gay political clubs. Atwater said that he had turned 
down Dannemeyer's request to publicly repudiate the party's giving charters to 
such groups. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer, who for years has campaigned against homosexuality, had asked 
Atwater to come out against chartering of gay GOP organizations after a state 
party convention rejected a Dannemeyer resolution on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I am for civil rights and civil liberties for everyone, period," Atwater said. 
"So I simply was not prepared to acknowledge in a letter to the congressman 
that question (about party sponsorship of gay political groups) one way or the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
Atwater, who talked optimistically about Republican efforts to win increased 
support from blacks, was asked if those efforts were not contradicted by the 
emphasis President Bush placed on the case of paroled convict Willie Horton, a 
black, during the 1988 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I, to this day, will not acknowledge that the Willie Horton matter had 
anything at all to do with race," said Atwater who was Bush's campaign manager. 
"When I heard about Willie Horton, I didn't know the guy was black," he said. " 
I didn't even know his name."

FREEWAY SEISMIC SAFETY NOT 'HIGHEST PRIORITY';

<P>
FUNDING: A NUMBER OF CALTRANS ENGINEERS SAY THEY WERE PRESSURED TO INSTEAD FIX 
ROADS THAT CAUSED FAR MORE DEATHS THAN QUAKES.

<P>
In the 18 years since the Sylmar earthquake toppled a freeway interchange, a 
program to shore up 2,500 of the most vulnerable bridges and elevated roadways 
in California has never been a top state priority -- getting less money, for 
example, than freeway landscaping or sound walls. 
</P>
<P>
State Transportation Director Robert K. Best conceded Wednesday that earthquake 
safety "was not the highest priority in the department for the expenditure of 
whatever funds became available. It's just as simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
However, the slow pace of beefing up bridges had long troubled a number of 
state Department of Transportation engineers, who wanted to get the work done 
before a major quake knocked down other highway structures. These civil 
servants said in interviews with Times reporters that they felt shackled by 
dwindling highway dollars and were under constant pressure to clean up the 
state's many "blood alleys" -- stretches of road that produced far more deaths 
than earthquakes had. 
</P>
<P>
While the engineers blame a general shortage of money for the slow progress 
under three governors -- Ronald Reagan, Edmund G. Brown Jr. and George 
Deukmejian -- several top state officials disagree. They insist that there was 
money available for earthquake safety and that Caltrans got whatever it 
requested for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
With the deaths of at least 39 people caught in the collapse of the Nimitz 
Freeway in Oakland during last Tuesday's quake, officials are being asked 
whether they did enough, quickly enough to head off an earthquake disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Bridge design engineer Oris H. Degenkolb was in charge of the Caltrans 
earthquake retrofitting program until he retired in 1981. It was Degenkolb who 
drew up the list of bridges supported by columns that might fall in an 
earthquake. He said he complained frequently within the agency that progress 
was too slow. But he never put his concerns in writing, and it is unclear 
whether they were forwarded to top Caltrans officials. 
</P>
<P>
"You knew an earthquake was coming," Degenkolb said in an interview. "There was 
going to be a catastrophe coming out of it and something ought to be done about 
it before we get caught with our pants down." 
</P>
<P>
Another retired Caltrans engineer, Arthur L. Elliott, said that Caltrans 
engineers felt lucky to get a commitment of $2 million to $3 million a year for 
earthquake improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all champing at the bit and wanting to get it done," said Elliott, who 
was in charge of bridge design. "The money was the main drawback on why we 
weren't moving faster." 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude was there was only so much money and that's it," said William J. 
Jurkovich, Caltrans chief of special bridge projects. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a leaky roof," he said. "You can't fix it if it's raining. When it 
isn't raining, why fix it?" 
</P>
<P>
During the first five years after the 1971 San Fernando quake, highway 
officials spent $7.7 million to reinforce bridges and elevated roadways for 
earthquake safety. The amount is less than the $8.6 million that the highway 
division spent in one single budget year -- 1971-72 -- on an ambitious tree- 
and shrub-planting program. 
</P>
<P>
By the time of the 1987 Whittier quake, Caltrans had spent most of the $55 
million budgeted for tying down bridge spans to keep them from sliding off 
during a severe quake. 
</P>
<P>
However, the subsequent Whittier quake proved what Caltrans engineers had long 
believed -- that the columns supporting many of the bridges built before 1971 
could be severely damaged and even toppled in a major quake. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1987 quake, James E. Roberts, chief of Caltrans' structures division, 
wrote a memo urging his superiors to accelerate spending on reinforcing bridge 
supports "to prevent the collapse of major structures during an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the memo, Caltrans now has plans to spend $64 million over five 
years in a second phase of earthquake improvements. But the spending plan would 
not have addressed the problems now believed responsible for the Nimitz 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Even under that accelerated spending plan, the total for earthquake safety is 
scarcely more than the $63 million the department has budgeted for new 
landscaping over the same period. It's also less than the $75 million allocated 
for construction and reinforcing of sound walls. 
</P>
<P>
This year alone, Caltrans plans to spend $44.5 million to maintain and care for 
21,000 acres of landscaping along California's freeways, compared to $18 
million budgeted for earthquake improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Allan H. Hendrix, chief of program development for Caltrans highway division, 
said that "there was never an explicit trade-off" made in budgeting money for 
earthquake safety versus budgeting for other programs. The amount allocated for 
earthquake safety, he said, "was the total that our technical experts told us 
was needed." 
</P>
<P>
Top officials with the California Transportation Commission, which generally 
decides how highway money is spent in the state, say they always gave Caltrans 
whatever it requested for safety programs. 
</P>
<P>
William T. Bagley, who stepped down as chairman of the commission earlier this 
year, pointed out that the panel approved spending $64 million for retrofitting 
bridges and other elevated structures, just as the Caltrans staff had 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave them what they asked for, in the face of arguments that we shouldn't, 
that we were in effect stealing $64 million from new construction," Bagley 
said. "Safety does come first when it's on the table in front of you." 
</P>
<P>
State Finance Director Jesse R. Huff pointed out that the state is spending 
from $900 million to $1.3 billion each year on new highway construction 
projects -- sums that dwarf what has been proposed for earthquake safety. 
</P>
<P>
"We put a lot of money into highways -- there has been a lot of rehabilitation, 
a lot of widening, a lot of safety work," Huff said. "So it just doesn't make 
any sense to say there is a chill in the air that has scared people away (from 
requesting funds for earthquake safety). It just doesn't add up." 
</P>
<P>
But other top Caltrans and Administration officials disagree, contending that 
every aspect of highway construction and maintenance has been affected by a 
shortage of gasoline tax funds that began with the Arab oil embargoes of the 
1970s. Changes in gasoline consumption -- brought on in large part by higher 
costs at the pump -- meant a sharp drop in federal and state gasoline tax 
dollars for California. 
</P>
<P>
During the same period, several years of double-digit inflation also cut into 
the number of projects that could be funded each year. 
</P>
<P>
A number of state transportation officials, past and present, have said that 
they found themselves having to choose between earthquake safety and making 
improvements in dangerous stretches of highways -- the so-called "blood 
alleys." 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to other safety problems on the state's highways, William Schaefer, 
chief Caltrans engineer, said at a recent press briefing that even if there 
were more money to spend, "I could not in good conscience say we would focus 
every dime on earthquake safety programs to the exclusion of every other 
program." 
</P>
<P>
A senior transportation official in a previous Administration stated flatly 
that earthquake safety was competing for funds with other safety programs -- 
and usually losing. 
</P>
<P>
The Nimitz Freeway "was always on the watch list of roadways to monitor," said 
the official, who asked not to be identified. "But the debate always was 
whether you worked on a freeway such as this or fixed the blood alleys. The 
blood alleys always won out over questions of structural integrity. It was a 
case of some obscure engineering report that says there may or may not be a 
problem someday versus a freeway where people are getting killed now."

Richard C. Paddock, Virginia Ellis and George Skelton.

MARY MCCARTHY, 77, NOVELIST NOTED FOR FEISTY STYLE, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mary McCarthy, a novelist and essayist who battled the intellectual elite and 
questioned the value of history and even the worth of the novel itself, died 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The author of "The Company She Keeps," "Cast a Cold Eye," "The Oasis" and "The 
Group" -- probably her best known work -- was 77. She died at New York Hospital 
in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press quoted a spokeswoman for Miss McCarthy's alma mater, 
Vassar College, who said the famed literary figure had been battling cancer. 
</P>
<P>
With a steely pen and sharp tongue, Miss McCarthy touched a multitude of 
subjects in a career that began shortly after she was a Vassar student in the 
early 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
There she had hoped to pursue a career in the theater but soon discovered she 
had no acting talent. She chose to write instead, and began reviewing books for 
the Nation and the New Republic. 
</P>
<P>
Even then her willingness to do battle was apparent as she became co-editor of 
a critical book about book critics. 
</P>
<P>
In a McCarthy biography, Doris Grumbach wrote that the McCarthy signature was 
to "attack in every direction, without concern for the barriers of established 
reputation." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years she turned out nine volumes of fiction and two classic books 
about the art and history of Venice and Florence, compiled reports from Saigon 
and Hanoi into two books and wrote of the trial of Capt. Ernest Medina, who 
ordered the destruction of My Lai in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
After visiting Vietnam, she opined that "the worst thing that could happen to 
our country would be to win this war." 
</P>
<P>
She also produced works on Watergate, collected her essays on literature and 
theatrical criticism into several books and turned out memoirs and 
autobiographies. 
</P>
<P>
She wrote about subjects as diverse as the pretentious world of academia ("A 
Charmed Life") and terrorists ("Cannibals and Missionaries"). 
</P>
<P>
Her acidity touched four generations, including the current one. When asked in 
an interview for "Contemporary Authors" whether the women's movement had 
produced any distinguished writing, she answered simply "no." 
</P>
<P>
Although sometimes critical of Miss McCarthy for not stretching her own 
creative abilities further, Norman Mailer once called her "our first lady of 
letters." 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Alfred Kazin, a chronicler of New York's Jazz Age intellectuals, Miss 
McCarthy had an "unerring ability to spot the hidden weakness or inconsistency 
in any literary effort and every person. To this weakness she instinctively 
leaped with cries of pleasure -- surprised that her victim, as he lay torn and 
bleeding, did not applaud her perspicacity." 
</P>
<P>
Although she first made her mark among the brawling New York intellectuals of 
the 1930s, she managed to reach a wider audience only in 1963 with her novel 
"The Group." 
</P>
<P>
The spicy best-selling chronicle of the lives of eight college graduates 
starting out in the 1930s was made into a movie in 1966 starring Candice 
Bergen, Joanna Pettet and Hal Holbrook. 
</P>
<P>
More recently she touched a new generation in a celebrated literary feud with 
Lillian Hellman by declaring, on national television, "Everything she (Hellman) 
writes is a lie, including 'and' and 'the.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hellman sued for libel, but died in 1984 before the suit reached the trial 
which Miss McCarthy had eagerly sought. 
</P>
<P>
Most of her writing was autobiographical, beginning with "The Company She 
Keeps," published in 1942, a series of interconnected short stories about the 
people she knew in New York during the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
"Memories of a Catholic Girlhood," published in 1957 and now considered a 
landmark in autobiographical writing, recounted her sordid childhood in 
Minneapolis, where she was brutally mistreated by relatives after her parents 
died. 
</P>
<P>
Miss McCarthy was born the daughter of Roy Winfield McCarthy and Therese 
Preston McCarthy, who died within a day of each other during the flu epidemic 
of 1918. 
</P>
<P>
Mary, who was 6, and three younger brothers were entrusted to the care of Aunt 
Margaret and Uncle Meyers, whom their ward later described as sadistic and 
miserly guardians who dressed the children like paupers, fed them a diet of 
root vegetables, forbade reading and, at night, taped their mouths shut "to 
prevent mouth breathing." 
</P>
<P>
"How I Grew," published in 1987 as a sequel to "Memories," described her rescue 
at 11 by her maternal grandparents, who took her west to Tacoma, Wash., and 
enrolled her in the fashionable Annie Wright Seminary. The seminary, where the 
contrary student embraced atheism, prepared her for Vassar, where she hobnobbed 
with the bright, wealthy Eastern society girls she used as models for her 
characters in "The Group." 
</P>
<P>
She moved to Paris in 1962 and divided her time between a comfortable Left Bank 
apartment and her home in Castine, Me. In recent years, she occupied a creative 
writing chair at Bard College in Annadale-on-Hudson, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
One week after graduation in 1933, she married Harold Johnsrud, an actor. The 
marriage was brief and in 1938, Miss McCarthy married her professor, the 
eminent critic Edmund Wilson, who encouraged her to write fiction. They had one 
son, Reuel, before a bitter divorce in which each accused the other of battery. 
</P>
<P>
She met her fourth husband, James West, while on a trip to Warsaw, divorced her 
third husband, Bowden Broadwater, and married West in Paris in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Miss McCarthy was often hailed as a feminist before her time. But she always 
refused that label, saying equality between the sexes was unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody has to give more," she told an interviewer in 1987. Her belief was 
simple: women should learn to think for themselves and act accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
Among the dozens of awards she won were the prestigious Edward McDowell Medal 
and the National Medal for Literature. In May, she was inducted into the 
American Academy of Arts and Letters. 
</P>
<P>
Irving Stock, in "Fiction and Wisdom," wrote that "though Mary McCarthy's 
novels are not all equally successful, each has so much life and truth . . . 
that it becomes a matter for wonder that she is not generally named among the 
finest American novelists of her period." 
</P>
<P>
Less sanguine was the author herself. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, at age 74 on the eve of the publication of "How I Grew," she proved 
she could be as cold and hard on herself as she was of others. 
</P>
<P>
Asked for a self-assessment, she replied: "Not favorable."

The Soviet Union said Wednesday that it will shortly devalue its currency by 
90% for some transactions in a bid to curtail the widespread black market 
speculation in hard currencies such as the U.S. dollar.

The new rate of 6.26 rubles to the dollar is a fraction of the present official 
rate of 0.63 rubles per dollar, reflecting the ruble's limited buying power 
both at home and abroad. But it still does not match the current street rate of 
10, 12 or often 15 rubles to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Although the move will have a limited economic impact, it is probably the first 
of a series of "hard, unpopular measures" that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
warned earlier this week would be taken soon in order to pull the Soviet 
economy out of its deepening crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The government newspaper Izvestia bluntly characterized the move as "a jolt," 
and officials at the State Bank of the Soviet Union and the Ministry of Finance 
were so surprised by the government decision that they could not explain 
precisely how the new system would work. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, however limited, is clearly a first step toward a broader 
devaluation of the ruble, fundamental price reforms and the eventual 
transformation of the ruble into a currency that could be bought and sold 
freely on the world's currency exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
The official Tass news agency said the devaluation would not solve all the 
country's economic problems but added that the government viewed the move as 
"an important part of the economic reform, another step towards making the 
ruble convertible." Tass also said the government hoped that "a more realistic 
rate of exchange" would attract more tourists and encourage businessmen to 
spend more here. 
</P>
<P>
Described by the State Bank as simply a "special rate," the new exchange rate 
will be used starting Nov. 1 for the hard currency sold to Soviet citizens 
going abroad, and for hard currency purchased from foreigners, presumably 
tourists and businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
The official exchange rate would continue to be used for other transactions, 
according to an announcement by the State Bank. Most of Moscow's foreign trade, 
however, is conducted in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs, German deutsche marks, 
British sterling or Japanese yen, and more than 3,000 different exchange rates 
are used to make Soviet prices comparable to those on the world market. 
</P>
<P>
The official exchange rate has long been "an absurdity," Izvestia said, 
commenting on the change, for it only tempted visiting tourists and businessmen 
to use the black market, which operates in virtually every tourist hotel and in 
free markets in almost every city. 
</P>
<P>
"A more decisive measure had to be taken against this black market, which has 
sucked up a considerable amount of the hard currency brought into this 
country," Mikhail L. Berger, Izvestia's respected economic observer, said. 
</P>
<P>
Speculators were taking "colossal advantage" of the disparity between the 
ruble's artificially high value and the real buying power of foreign 
currencies, Berger said. The speculators usually buy hard currency at perhaps 
10 times the official rate; use that money to buy prized consumer goods from 
special stores; sell the goods in rubles for upwards of 20 times their cost at 
the official rate, and then start the cycle over, taking a profit at each step. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the black market," a Soviet banker said. "Too much hard currency is being 
lost there. We are going to try to choke off the flow of dollars and capture it 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
An economic commentator for Tass noted that "the Soviet currency has been 
weakened by difficulties arising during the restructuring of the Soviet 
economy, by the growing demand for almost all kinds of goods, the striving to 
get rid of rubles combined with the reduction in hard currency receipts from 
exports." 
</P>
<P>
"It is no secret that many Soviet citizens, and not only those who travel 
abroad on business, are striving to exchange their rubles for dollars, francs 
and yen," Andrei Orlov wrote. "They use the services of the black market, and 
the exchange is certainly not made at the official rate. The state sustains 
considerable material losses at moral inconvenience to its citizens. The . . . 
government's decision is aimed at correcting this situation." 
</P>
<P>
In the context of the overall Soviet economy, the immediate goal is to ensure 
that the state gathers as much foreign currency as it can from tourists and 
other visitors and retains as much as it can to finance imports. 
</P>
<P>
Valery Ovcharenko, a spokesman for the Council of Ministers, which made the 
decision, described the change as an effort to attract more tourists by giving 
them more value for their money and encouraging Soviet citizens to exchange 
hard currency for rubles. 
</P>
<P>
But the main focus, Ovcharenko said, was on the black market. The high prices 
paid for scarce consumer goods there have added to the country's inflation. The 
recent growth of speculation has also undercut the first steps toward economic 
reform and angered many people who see political and moral degeneracy resulting 
from the economic liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
Those likely to be hit hardest, at least initially, by the new system will be 
Soviet citizens who travel abroad, Berger said. At present, they are permitted 
to change 200 rubles into dollars at the official rate, bringing them about 
$320; after Nov. 1, the same 200 rubles will bring only $32. 
</P>
<P>
The underlying difficulty remains the Soviet Union's huge shortage of consumer 
goods and the $480 billion worth of savings held in state banks ready to buy 
anything of value or quality, often regardless of the price. 
</P>
<P>
The new system is also a step toward making the ruble a freely convertible 
currency, a goal set for the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
"Although this exchange rate is being instituted only for non-commercial 
operations, it will undoubtedly influence the exchange rate for foreign trade 
as well," Berger commented. 
</P>
<P>
The auction will be closely watched for indications of the ruble's real value, 
which may be as low as 5 cents, 3 cents or even 2 cents when measured in terms 
of the massive demand here for scarce consumer products such as audio and video 
equipment or gems and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, the Council of Ministers approved a plan for partial 
convertibility of the ruble, starting with a devaluation of 50% on most exports 
in January, 1990. That was tied to price reform and other domestic economic 
decisions, and little has been said about how that decision will be 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
A series of visiting American economists have urged Moscow recently to convert 
to a gold standard, using its massive holdings of gold to make the ruble 
convertible as a way of stabilizing the economy.

HALF-BROTHER TO PURSUE WALLENBERG LEADS 
</P>

After a rare glimpse behind the walls of a Soviet prison, Raoul Wallenberg's 
half-brother said Wednesday he is more convinced than ever that the Swedish 
diplomat credited with saving tens of thousands of lives during World War II 
survived longer than Soviet authorities have admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Guy von Dardel, who has spent much of the last 44 years searching for 
Wallenberg, termed his 10-day trip to the Soviet Union "very exciting" and said 
he plans to return to pursue several leads. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved my brother very much. And I think it would be one of the great 
injustices if we left this alone, without trying to find out what happened," he 
said in an interview hours before leaving Moscow to return to Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Von Dardel said he was pleased by new evidence he gathered during two meetings 
with KGB officials last week and a trip this week to Vladimir Prison, 75 miles 
from Moscow. Scores of prisoners there have said they saw Wallenberg after 
1947, when the Kremlin has said he died in a Moscow jail cell. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet authorities made the surprise offer to allow Von Dardel to visit the 
prison during a meeting five days ago. Von Dardel extended his planned stay in 
Moscow and went into the prison Monday accompanied by Sonja Sonnenfeld, the 
chairman of the Raoul Wallenberg Assn., formed to help investigate Wallenberg's 
fate. 
</P>
<P>
"We were able to look at some prison files and talk to officials," Von Dardel 
said. "We were not able to confirm the sightings we had there, and thus the 
visit was not conclusive. But we never expected that. 
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless it points the way, and it's very exciting for me," he said. He 
declined to elaborate further on the new evidence he collected. 
</P>
<P>
Wallenberg is still revered by many for having saved tens of thousands of 
Hungarian Jews in Nazi-occupied Budapest during World War II -- the estimates 
run from 20,000 to 100,000 -- by helping to place them in safehouses and by 
distributing a special Swedish document that placed its holder under the 
protection of the Swedish government. 
</P>
<P>
He disappeared on Jan. 17, 1945, after going to meet the military commander of 
the Red Army troops who had occupied Budapest behind the fleeing Nazi soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Army confiscated Wallenberg's car and imprisoned both him and his 
driver. The Swedish diplomat is said to have told fellow inmates he was accused 
of being a spy. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union denied any knowledge of Wallenberg's whereabouts until 1957, 
when it said he had died a decade earlier in Moscow's Lubyanka Prison of an 
apparent heart attack. The Kremlin and the KGB security police have both 
apologized for his arrest and subsequent death. 
</P>
<P>
But dozens of former prisoners have reported seeing Wallenberg after 1947, 
including a number in Vladimir Prison. 
</P>
<P>
Von Dardel, noting that new documents relating to Wallenberg's arrest have 
turned up in recent weeks, has suggested that Wallenberg's prison records may 
be similarly lost. 
</P>
<P>
He also has said that Soviet authorities privately noted they would be willing 
to believe that Wallenberg lived beyond 1947 -- and even that he is alive today 
-- if offered convincing proof. 
</P>
<P>
Von Dardel said he believes his brother was held from 1950 until as recently as 
1980 in a special section of Vladimir Prison reserved for foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he said, the special section was turned into a new wing of the prison 
hospital, and inmates held there were dispersed to other locations. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to return to the prison with a bigger delegation, and one with more 
expertise in examining historical records," he said. "They have told us we can 
come again." 
</P>
<P>
He said his first-ever meetings with Soviet authorities during his stay here 
"have made me more convinced than ever that Raoul was alive after 1947," 
despite official denials. 
</P>
<P>
"Beyond that, I wouldn't comment," he continued when asked if he believes 
Wallenberg is alive today, as the Raoul Wallenberg Assn. contends.

REAGAN URGES JAPANESE TO ASSIST POLAND; 
</P>

<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan called on Japan Wednesday to use its economic 
strength to help Poland "make the transition from communism to free 
enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, speaking at a banquet hosted by a Japanese communications conglomerate 
that is paying him $2 million for a nine-day series of appearances, observed 
that Japan is entering a "golden age" with an economy that has "the power of a 
harnessed volcano." 
</P>
<P>
In its new status as the world's largest foreign aid donor, Japan should not 
overlook Poland, a "nation fighting to go democratic," Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. -- because of our already large security commitments to protecting 
freedom around the world and our large budget deficit -- cannot give Poland all 
the economic help it deserves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many nations, many organizations, can play a role, but you above all have the 
economic tenacity, the manufacturing and managerial skills, the financial 
resources," he said. "This is your golden age. Join us in a golden partnership 
for democracy in Poland and around the world." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu told Parliament on Monday that he hopes 
to visit Poland in January, and it is expected that some sort of economic 
assistance package will be announced at that time. Details of the package are 
still being worked out, according to Foreign Ministry officials. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu's predecessor, Sosuke Uno, pledged during the Paris summit of the seven 
leading industrialized democracies in July that Japan would cooperate in 
supporting economic reforms in Eastern Europe. But the powerful bureaucracies 
charged with administering Tokyo's aid program have resisted the idea, partly 
on the grounds that per-capita income in Poland or Hungary is high enough that 
the countries do not qualify for official development assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Japan traditionally has placed a priority on assisting development in 
Asia, where it perceives a greater strategic role for itself. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu had wanted to unveil an economic package for Poland during his visit to 
the United States in September, shortly after he took office, but failed to 
persuade the bureaucrats to support such a move. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that Tokyo has signed a pact to 
allow Poland to extend its debt repayment schedule for about $396.5 million in 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press quoted a ministry aide, requesting anonymity, as saying 
Poland will repay the debts and interest over five years after a five-year 
grace period. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, who is highly revered among Japan's conservative ruling elite as a 
symbol of American strength and a champion of free trade, arrived here Friday 
at the invitation of the Japanese government and the Fujisankei Communications 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
Although Reagan's activities here are ostensibly centered on raising funds for 
his presidential library, the trip is widely regarded as a public relations 
blitz by Fujisankei, which editorially leans heavily to the right. 
Consequently, the trip has been largely ignored by the rest of the Japanese 
media. 
</P>
<P>
So pervasive is the news blackout that the Foreign Ministry persuaded the 
organizers of the tour to allow Reagan to throw out the first pitch Tuesday at 
the third game of the Japan Series, the local equivalent of the World Series, 
so the general public might become aware of his presence. Reagan went to the 
mound in suit and tie and nearly hit the batter with his first throw. 
</P>
<P>
The stunt merited a photo and a brief story in the Yomiuri newspaper, which 
owns the Tokyo Giants, one of the contenders for the championship. Fujisankei's 
flagship newspaper, the Sankei, ignored the baseball episode, however, and 
focused its article on Nancy Reagan's meeting with the nascent Japan chapter of 
her "Just Say No" anti-drug program. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan got his most extensive exposure in a long interview broadcast Wednesday 
night on Fujisankei's television network, during which he looked back at his 
presidency, described his Soviet policy, supported President Bush's cautious 
approach to problems in Central America and explained his peculiar haircut. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's hair is short-cropped because half his head was shaved recently for 
brain surgery. The new look, which appears considerably more gray than his 
characteristically long brown locks, has revived the debate over whether he has 
been dying his hair. A spokesman for Reagan vehemently denied that any 
artificial color had ever been applied. 
</P>
<P>
The gray hair question has rivaled the controversy over Reagan's $2-million 
"honorarium," which is in addition to the $5 million to $7 million that 
Fujisankei is reportedly spending on logistics while the Reagans are in town. 
Fujisankei chartered a private jetliner for Reagan's entourage of about 20 
people to fly directly from Los Angeles; empty seats were filled by 200 
military dependents visiting family stationed in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the cost of Fujisankei's lavish hospitality, however, is being offset 
by receipts for events such as Wednesday night's banquet or the Reagan 
Presidential Library benefit concert on Sunday in a sports stadium in Yokohama. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether any of Reagan's $2-million fee is earmarked for the 
library fund. Neither Reagan's aides nor Fujisankei will comment publicly on 
the compensation, but reliable sources have confirmed that the $2-million 
figure is accurate. 
</P>
<P>
While in Japan, Reagan has attended a state dinner hosted by Kaifu, lunched 
with former Prime Ministers Noboru Takeshita and Yasuhiro Nakasone, and had an 
audience with Emperor Akihito, who awarded him the Grand Cordon of the Supreme 
Order of the Chrysanthemum, one of Japan's highest awards. 
</P>
<P>
A fanfare of trumpets greeted Reagan as he made a majestic entrance into the 
banquet hall at the Akasaka Prince Hotel on Wednesday evening. The dinner was 
attended by an array of business leaders, some of whose companies had purchased 
commercial time during the Reagan interview aired on Fuji Television Network 
later that night. 
</P>
<P>
True to his reputation here, Reagan's public remarks have emphasized bilateral 
friendship and free trade, a reassuring message for the increasing number of 
Japanese who worry about the backlash against Japan's huge trade surplus and 
its aggressive investment practices in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Asked during the Fuji TV interview what he thought of Sony Corp.'s takeover of 
Columbia Pictures, the former Hollywood actor said he thought it might result 
in "some improvements" in the moral standards of American movies, which he said 
have suffered from the loss of studio censorship. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have a feeling that maybe Hollywood needs some outsiders to bring back 
decency and good taste to some of the pictures that are being made," Reagan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan reiterated his advocacy of free trade, blaming Democrats in Congress for 
rising irritability over economic friction with Japan, and said the United 
States should remain open to foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the banquet, Reagan conceded that the two countries have 
differences on trade, "which I'll talk about later in the week," but he added 
that the "ideological basis of our partnership is secure. We see the world much 
the same way."

REAGAN DATA RULING MAY BE CHALLENGED; 
</P>
<P>
IRAN-CONTRA: THE JUSTICE DEPT. MAY TEST A DECISION ALLOWING SUBPOENA OF THE 
FORMER PRESIDENT'S NOTES FOR THE TRIAL OF JOHN M. POINDEXTER.

The Justice Department raised the possibility Wednesday that it might challenge 
a federal judge's ruling that former President Ronald Reagan's notes and 
diaries on Iran-Contra events can be subpoenaed for the trial of his former 
national security adviser, John M. Poindexter. 
</P>
<P>
Department lawyers are reviewing the 67-page ruling of U.S. District Judge 
Harold Greene, said David Runkel, the department's chief spokesman. He added 
that Greene's ruling Tuesday "does raise a serious question regarding the 
institution of the presidency." 
</P>
<P>
Runkel declined to pinpoint the "serious question" that was raised, but 
presumably he meant that the ruling threatens the privacy of a former 
President's notes and diaries. 
</P>
<P>
Any move to head off the subpoena could raise questions left open by the 
Supreme Court's 8-0 ruling in 1974 requiring former President Richard M. Nixon 
to surrender tapes of his conversations for the criminal trial of several of 
his aides. 
</P>
<P>
The decision recognized a "constitutionally based" executive privilege covering 
presidential materials, but said in the Watergate coverup case that it "must 
yield to the demonstrated specific need for evidence in a pending criminal 
trial." 
</P>
<P>
Runkel made clear that the department would make no move without consulting 
with Reagan's personal attorney, Theodore B. Olson, who headed the Justice 
Department's office of legal counsel during Reagan's first term. 
</P>
<P>
Greene's ruling first will be reviewed by the department's criminal division 
and then by Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh's office, Runkel said. 
</P>
<P>
Olson declined comment Wednesday but it is clear that he or the department 
would not move to quash a subpoena until it is issued by Greene for specific 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
Although Greene ruled Tuesday that Poindexter can subpoena Reagan documents, 
Poindexter's lawyer still must submit subpoenas to Greene for "specific, 
relevant documents" in the custody of Reagan or the U.S. archivist. The 
material must be requested by Nov. 23 -- 60 days before the Jan. 22 trial date 
set for Poindexter. 
</P>
<P>
Greene made his decision on the basis of a sealed claim submitted to him by 
Poindexter setting out the reasons for which he needs Reagan's diaries and 
notes. Greene made public Tuesday only that part of Poindexter's claims that 
were necessary to explain the logic of his ruling. 
</P>
<P>
He cited Poindexter's claim that he frequently met alone with Reagan and 
routinely discussed national security matters with him, including various 
aspects of what became the Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan and others took notes on these conversations and these notes or Reagan's 
diary entries "would support his defense to the charges in the various counts 
of the indictment," Poindexter said in his submission to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's personal notes were examined under tight limits by the presidential 
commission headed by former Sen. John Tower (R-Tex.) that evaluated the White 
House national security mechanism as it operated in Iran-Contra, and by the 
congressional committees that investigated the matter. But these panels did not 
have Poindexter providing a roadmap of what he sees as Reagan's involvement and 
knowledge of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Philip A. Lacovara, the former Watergate special prosecution force lawyer who 
argued the Nixon tapes case before the Supreme Court, said Wednesday: "I can't 
imagine why the privacy of an ex-President's notes would be higher than that of 
an incumbent President."

KILLING OF PREGNANT WOMAN STIRS OUTRAGE

Outrage grew Wednesday over the robbery-killing of a pregnant suburban lawyer 
and the wounding of her husband, while their baby, born by Cesarean section, 
struggled for survival. 
</P>
<P>
In housing developments, in posh hotels, in student haunts and in the streets, 
the talk was of the attack on Carol Stuart and her husband, Charles, who were 
abducted Monday night as they left a childbirth class at Brigham and Women's 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Their assailant forced them to drive into the inner city area bordering the 
hospital. There, the assailant robbed the couple and shot Stuart in the 
abdomen, his 33-year-old wife in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart, 29, remained in critical condition Wednesday, a Boston City Hospital 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the day, Police Supt. Joseph Saia said that detectives had been able to 
narrow the list of suspects "down to a chosen few" after speaking to Stuart in 
his hospital room. 
</P>
<P>
"It hit home," Beryl Cohen, a prominent Boston attorney, said Wednesday as he 
made his way through the downtown shopping district, miles from the site of the 
crime. "It's not a suburban story. It's not about rich and poor. It's not 
made-for-television fiction. I just called my son, who takes guitar lessons on 
Tremont Street (near the shooting), and told him to be careful." 
</P>
<P>
In the Mission Hill area, where police officers found the couple shot and 
slumped in their car, 23-year-old Anthony Stanley was standing outside a liquor 
store with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
"The man who did it should be taken out. We got to get the death penalty back. 
The guy was foul. He had no heart," Stanley said. 
</P>
<P>
At a downtown cutlery store, proprietor Arthur Marks said his employees could 
talk about nothing but the crime and its brutality. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost too hard to look," the 73-year-old merchant said, "because of its 
enormity and the fact that it's so needless." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Stuart, general manager of a fur store, used a car phone to call 
police. Family members said the telephone had been installed in Mrs. Stuart's 
car after she became pregnant so she could remain in touch with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours after the shooting, a son, Christopher, was born prematurely. On 
Wednesday, hospital spokeswomen would say only that the infant was alive.

COURT AWARDS $1.3 MILLION TO VICTIMS OF ATTICA ASSAULT

<P>
A New York court awarded almost $1.3 million Wednesday to inmates and the 
survivors of inmates who were shot during the bloody state police assault that 
ended the 1971 uprising at Attica state prison. 
</P>
<P>
The awards ordered by the state Court of Claims range from $35,000 to $475,000 
and include the first damages given to survivors of inmates involved in the 
Attica uprising. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for two inmates' widows said that with interest accrued over 18 years, 
required under the state's wrongful death law, the damages will exceed $2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
In separate decisions relating to seven inmates, Judge Donald Corbett said the 
convicts "neither participated in the uprising nor resisted in the retaking" of 
the prison by state police. 
</P>
<P>
Corbett said the state was liable for damages for injuries "resulting from the 
intentional use of excessive force." 
</P>
<P>
The state will appeal, said James Flateau, spokesman for state Criminal Justice 
Director John Poklemba. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the seven inmates were killed in the 10 minutes of police gunfire on 
rioting prison inmates. Two others have since died of unrelated causes and two 
are still alive. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,200 inmates took control of the maximum-security prison near 
Buffalo for four days, holding guards and civilians hostage. 
</P>
<P>
Police used gunfire and gas to retake the prison on Sept. 13, 1971, killing 39 
inmates and employees and injuring 80 inmates and employees. One guard and 
three inmates were killed during the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
The awards are based on the inmates' pain and suffering, their families' loss 
of money based on their future employment prospects and disfigurement. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no magical or precise mathematical formula for computing damages in 
this type of case, for the award must be based upon intangible . . . losses," 
Judge Corbett said in one of the decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Corbett awarded the largest amount -- $475,000 -- to Brenda West, widow of 
Willie West Jr. He was 26 and the father of an 11-month-old son when he died 
after being shot several times. 
</P>
<P>
Corbett said West could have been released in 1981 and had a promising career 
as a light operator for Columbia Pictures in California ahead of him.

CALTRANS TO INSPECT BRIDGES AND OVERPASSES IN L.A. AREA

<P>
California Department of Transportation officials announced Wednesday that they 
are organizing two teams of engineers to assess the seismic safety of 
overpasses and bridges in the Los Angeles area, including the Harbor Freeway 
transitway now in the early stages of construction. 
</P>
<P>
James E. Roberts, chief of Caltrans' structure division, said one team will 
concentrate on new construction in the Los Angeles area. He said the second 
team will review the design plans on older structures bearing a similarity to 
the mile-long section of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland that collapsed in last 
week's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Of prime concern to the engineers, Roberts said, will be the double-decked 
portions of the Interstate 10 approaches to the Los Angeles River bridge near 
downtown and a two-mile section of the Harbor Freeway transitway that will be 
elevated. 
</P>
<P>
Although state engineers say they are still looking at possible causes of the 
Nimitz collapse, its failure has forced them to focus new attention on 
double-decked, multicolumned freeways. Several University of California 
engineers have said that joints in the Nimitz columns gave way, causing support 
columns to fail and the upper deck of the freeway to collapse on the lower 
deck, killing at least 39 people. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts insisted repeatedly that officials believe that Los Angeles bridges and 
overpasses would not collapse in an earthquake but added that they wanted to 
conduct the additional inspections to allay any fears local residents may have. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a concern obviously in Los Angeles, and so they've asked us to come 
down and reassure them and that's what we intend to do," he said. "We know we 
have to build peoples' confidence again." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans Regional Director Jerry Baxter told the Los Angeles City Council 
Tuesday that he had asked that experts be appointed to inspect the Harbor 
Freeway construction for seismic safety in light of the collapse of the Nimitz 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago said a team of eight engineers will travel to Los 
Angeles for on-site inspections of new construction and their design plans. He 
said the team will include four Caltrans bridge engineers, with a combined 
experience in designing bridges of nearly 100 years, and four private 
consulting engineers, with expertise in the fields of seismic research and 
structural design. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to look at the plans for any new structures in the Los Angles 
area that involve any sort of an elevated highway," Drago said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the second team will work out of Sacramento reviewing the design plans 
of older, existing elevated structures in the Los Angeles area, with particular 
emphasis on those that are double-decked and multicolumned. 
</P>
<P>
He said the team will look at structures built before 1971 for any design 
features similar to the section of the Nimitz Freeway that failed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not doing this because we think there's a problem. We're doing this to 
be cautious and make sure there isn't a problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said the portions of Interstate 10 at the Los Angeles River will get 
attention first because those structures are more like the Nimitz Freeway than 
any other in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, he said he believes that there is enough difference in the design of 
the two structures to make the Interstate 10 bridges safe in an earthquake. The 
Interstate 10 approaches, for example, were built much later than the Nimitz 
Freeway and include much more steel and less concrete in their construction. 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, he said, the new Harbor Freeway construction will be built 
according to a design that is considered state-of-the-art for seismic safety. 
</P>
<P>

Oakland: Stephanie Chavez, Ashley Dunn, George Ramos and Ronald L. Soble. In 
San Francisco: Larry Green, Charisse Jones, Norma Kaufman, Suzette Parmley, 
Tracy Wilkinson and Victor F. Zonana. In Santa Cruz: Charles Hillinger. In Los 
Angeles: Kristen Christopher, Cathleen Decker, Myrna Oliver and Bob Secter.

Col. Moammar Kadafi acknowledged for the first time that Libya had bankrolled 
terrorist groups but said it no longer does so. In an interview with the 
Egyptian government-owned weekly magazine Al Mussawar, Kadafi was quoted as 
saying that "when we discovered that these groups were causing more harm than 
benefit to the Arab cause, we halted our aid to them completely and withdrew 
our support." Kadafi also said he wants no confrontation with Washington.

Israel has secretly joined a partnership to produce a nuclear-tipped missile 
for South Africa, NBC News reported. The partnership reportedly has enabled 
Israel to gain access to a long-range missile site near Overberg, South Africa, 
and to acquire uranium for nuclear warheads. In exchange, Israel reportedly has 
shared missile technology with South Africa that will enable it to become a 
nuclear power.

Investigators searching for the cause of a huge plastics plant explosion in 
Pasadena, Tex., discovered three more bodies of victims in the twisted rubble 
and continued the search for 17 others presumed killed. Phillips Petroleum Co. 
officials learned that one man who had been listed as missing was not at the 
plant at the time of Monday's blast, plant manager Robert Benz said. Assistant 
Secretary of Labor John Scannell, who heads the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration, toured the plant with other federal investigators. OSHA has 15 
investigators, including chemical and structural engineers, at the site.

TRIBE REJECTS PACT TO CURTAIL FISHING

<TEXT>
<P>
A crowd erupted in chants and shouts of jubilation in Lac du Flambeau after 
members of the Chippewa tribe rejected a $35.6-million pact with the state to 
curtail the Indians' off-reservation hunting and fishing. The pact would have 
paid the tribe for not fishing for 10 years. Treaty rights, which courts have 
ruled allow Indians to spearfish off their reservations, have caused 
controversy and sparked some violence. The Chippewa may fish with spears and 
out of season, which other fishermen cannot do.

A state appeals court in Sacramento ruled that regulators illegally approved an 
experiment allowing dental hygienists to treat patients without the supervision 
of a dentist, officials said. Under the test program, administered through Cal 
State Northridge, 16 Southern California hygienists were allowed to treat 
patients without a dentist's supervision. All other hygienists are required by 
state law to work with a dentist. The 3rd District Court of Appeal ruled that 
the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development should have held a 
public hearing on the program before approving the test, which began two years 
ago.

IT'S LIKE SPRING FOR ATHLETICS; 
</P>
<P>
WORLD SERIES: LA RUSSA, ALDERSON TAKE THE A'S TO ARIZONA FOR TWO DAYS TO FIND 
CLEAR SKIES AND A DRY FIELD.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The temperature on a hazy -- and ultimately blustery -- Wednesday afternoon 
here reached the high 70s. 
</P>
<P>
Warm enough for Jay Alves, the publicity director of the Oakland Athletics, to 
wear shorts. A's General Manager Sandy Alderson, showed more discretion, 
arriving in jeans, sun glasses and a casual shirt. 
</P>
<P>
The return of the A's to the Valley of the Sun created the sense of a calendar 
gone haywire. It was suddenly March in October, suddenly spring training again 
except for some significant differences, one of which was cited by Manager Tony 
La Russa when his team finished a workout of almost three hours. 
</P>
<P>
"In spring training, it's always in the back of my mind that we're gearing up 
for six months," La Russa said of the long season. 
</P>
<P>
"It never left my mind today that we're gearing up for two games." 
</P>
<P>
The A's lead the San Francisco Giants, two games to none, in the best of seven 
Series that resumes Friday night at Candlestick Park. It resumes after a delay 
of 11 days caused by the 7.1-magnitude earthquake that rocked Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
So, in gearing up again, in seeking the assurance of a dry field and 
comparatively warm weather, the A's left Oakland on a charter flight Wednesday 
morning and are scheduled to return after working out again today at Phoenix 
Municipal Stadium, their spring base. 
</P>
<P>
La Russa smiled when practice was over and said: "This worked out better than 
we had hoped. We even got the wind of Candlestick." 
</P>
<P>
For $25,000, the approximate price of their trip here, the A's may have 
benefited in other ways as well. The Bay Area's earthquake relief fund 
definitely did. Red Cross volunteers collected about $9,200 from an estimated 
crowd of 6,000 Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
An Arizona TV station announced that it will match whatever is collected in the 
A's two days here. There is a possibility, Alderson said, that the club will 
charge admission to today's workout in an attempt to generate even more 
proceeds. He also said that A's players will soon announce a donation 
independent of that being made by the club. 
</P>
<P>
The size of Wednesday's turnout stunned the A's and generated a sense of game 
atmosphere among some players, who speculated the club might benefit from it, a 
contention La Russa disputed. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's just this crowd, but I think the spirit of the World Series is 
coming back," said pitcher Dave Stewart, who will start Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
Said first baseman Mark McGwire: "I think it surprised everyone that this many 
people came out to watch a practice. I couldn't help but experience a little 
adrenaline flow. We haven't played before this many people in almost two 
weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Is he convinced, then, that the A's will benefit from the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"If we win, we can say, 'Yeah,' but if we lose, people will ask, 'Why did you 
bother to go down there?' " McGwire said. "We've been on a roller coaster for 
so long it's hard to know what to think anymore. It's hard to turn on and off. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, people ask me about momentum now and I have to think there isn't any. 
Nobody knows what's going to happen. It's like going back to square one except 
we're still ahead, two to nothing. We have to win two of five and they have to 
win four of five. If that's momentum, we have it." 
</P>
<P>
The A's scheduled the Phoenix flight after their workout Tuesday at the Oakland 
Coliseum was cut short by rain and a wet field. It was bright and clear when 
they left Oakland Wednesday morning, but the Arizona commitment had been made. 
</P>
<P>
Among those believed to be chagrined was Commissioner Fay Vincent, but the A's 
didn't seek his approval, said Alderson, who added he is confident that 
everyone's perspective -- including that of his manager, coaches and players -- 
will benefit by the decision to come here. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to coast into the World Series. We have a responsibility to 
play as well as we can, and that's the reason we came," Alderson said. 
</P>
<P>
"And if nothing else, the atmosphere here definitely beats what we had in our 
own park yesterday. It's refreshing and satisfying to have this many people 
come out to watch us work after 11 days off." 
</P>
<P>
Said La Russa, taking a different course: "It was a treat to have this many 
people here, but we weren't trying to generate momentum by flying around the 
country. We had to get on the field, that was the key. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is, if we had been guaranteed a dry field and good weather in 
Oakland, we would have stayed. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, it's a plus to see the crowd's enthusiasm, but I'd have rather been in 
Oakland today and I'm sure the players would have as well. 
</P>
<P>
"When you strip everything away, playing for a World Series championship is a 
once-in-a-lifetime proposition, and that alone will get everyone going and 
motivated again." 
</P>
<P>
There are those, of course, who believe the World Series has lost its meaning, 
that it has been delayed too long to be considered a championship test. 
</P>
<P>
La Russa said he doesn't feel cheated by the delay, that he still takes 
satisfaction in the opportunity to win the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the club that wins may have a claim on being more deserving than any 
that's ever played," he said. "Do you have any idea how tough it is for these 
guys to practice like this? I mean, it's Oct. 25 and we're getting ready to 
play Game 3 of the World Series after going to camp in February. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very sensitive to what these players have been through. You keep pushing 
and pushing. You keep asking for more and more. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever can endure all of this and win four games may deserve more credit than 
any team ever, but my point is that I don't care whether you give that credit 
or not. I know in my own mind it'll be a tremendous achievement. Not only that, 
it'll say a lot about what a team can do when pushed to the limit." 
</P>
<P>
In this final push, amid the long delay and the sorting of priorities in the 
earthquake's wake, the challenge is more mental than physical, La Russa said. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball is a game of finesse and execution, and it's tough maintaining that 
in this situation," he said. "But the mind is a wonderful thing if you don't 
give in to it, and I think the A's and Giants will surprise everyone with how 
well they play." 
</P>
<P>
What the A's did Wednesday was strictly spring training. Some batting practice. 
Some infield practice. A five inning intrasquad game that ended when catcher 
Ron Hassey suffered a slightly bruised right shoulder when struck by a foul 
tip. 
</P>
<P>
The loudest cheers went to Jose Canseco, who is hitless in his last 28 World 
Series at-bats, but who put on a big exhibition in batting practice, as he has 
frequently done here in the spring. Among Canseco's shots were two that cleared 
the left-field fence and a bank behind it. 
</P>
<P>
"Jose plays to the crowd and I think this will definitely help him," hitting 
instructor Merv Rettenmund said of the trip here. "He wasn't swinging like this 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, it's an imposition, but I think everyone understands and is happy to be 
here. It was almost like we were living at the Coliseum. It's good to get 
away." 
</P>
<P>
La Russa said of the workout: "Good but not great. About as good as can be 
expected under the circumstances. Everybody is anxious to play." 
</P>
<P>
First, however, there will be one more workout in the park that is the A's 
spring home and also home of the Giants' Pacific Coast League franchise. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a billboard reading "Go Giants" was removed just before the A's 
arrival Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Shows how fast you can get off and on the bandwagon," Alderson said.

The National Football League's owners ended another day of quarreling about who 
should be the next commissioner by appointing another committee Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
This one is a five-man committee whose mission is to decide unanimously in 
favor of either lawyer Paul Tagliabue or football executive Jim Finks. 
</P>
<P>
If that can be done, the rest of the clubs will fall into line, and the new 
commissioner will be selected by noon, other owners predicted. 
</P>
<P>
If it can't be done that quickly, the committee will get six more days to come 
in with a verdict before the NFL's next meeting in Dallas next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In Dallas, if the committee is still split, it would apparently lead to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The end of the line for both Finks and Tagliabue, who have been sharing the 
votes in recent balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The nomination and eventual election of somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
That was Commissioner Pete Rozelle's indication late Wednesday night. He said 
it isn't 100% certain that another candidate would rise from the ashes, "but 
it's likely." 
</P>
<P>
So for the present, in a novel effort to break the impasse, 23 of the 28 owners 
have abdicated, and left their fate up to five of their peers. 
</P>
<P>
The five: 
</P>
<P>
Wellington Mara of the New York Giants and Art Modell of the Cleveland Browns, 
representing the old-guard clubs supporting Finks. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bowlen of the Denver Broncos and Mike Lynn of the Minnesota Vikings, 
representing the league's newer owners who have been fighting Finks' selection 
since July and who have lately embraced Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
The chairman is Dan Rooney of the Pittsburgh Steelers, formerly a Finks backer 
who defected to Tagliabue in the last few days. 
</P>
<P>
"If these five people can agree on one man for commissioner, I'm sure we'll get 
the (required) 19 votes from the other owners," Rozelle said. 
</P>
<P>
If they don't agree unanimously, their work will have been in vain. 
</P>
<P>
A split decision would merely perpetuate the pro-and-anti-Finks stalemate that 
has persisted through four special NFL meetings in three cities in the last 
four months -- with a fifth meeting just over the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
This is a league divided into two major factions -- 12 backing Tagliabue, an 
NFL lawyer, and 11 supporting Finks, the New Orleans Saints' general manager. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of the five other franchises -- Detroit, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Green 
Bay and the Raiders -- don't much care who gets it. Most have either abstained 
in the balloting, or voted without much passion for Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
Two days of wrangling in Cleveland ended when Rozelle proposed the new 
committee as a microcosm of the whole to continue the debating on a smaller 
scale around a smaller table. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't getting much done with 28 people shouting at each other," Modell 
said. "This gets the (fight) down to a manageable size." 
</P>
<P>
It also gets it down to some of the most prominent leaders of the two 
antagonistic factions. 
</P>
<P>
"Finks will never be elected," Bowlen said not long ago in Denver, echoing 
Lynn's view. 
</P>
<P>
Bowlen and Lynn speak for the three other powerful anti-Finks owners, Hugh 
Culverhouse of Tampa Bay, Norman Braman of Philadelphia and Eddie DeBartolo of 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the Tagliabue faction are Dallas, Miami, New England, Seattle, 
Indianapolis, Houston and the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no other qualified candidate but Finks," Mara said not 
long ago in New York, speaking for Modell, Ralph Wilson of Buffalo, Lamar Hunt 
of Kansas City, Ed McCaskey of Chicago and other owners in Washington, 
Cincinnati, Phoenix, San Diego and New Orleans as well as the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Rozelle, however, noted that Rooney, the committee chairman, once agreed with 
Mara and Modell -- but changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hopeful," Rozelle said. 
</P>
<P>
This is the third committee the league has called to work on selecting 
Rozelle's successor. 
</P>
<P>
The first, the original search committee, helped precipitate the current fight 
when it recommended only one candidate, Finks, although it promised to offer 
three or four. 
</P>
<P>
The second committee also recommended Finks but gave the newer owners another 
candidate to rally around -- Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
The third committee has the toughest job yet.

JIM MURRAY: ALL THAT WINNING COMES AT A PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

News item: "South Bend, Ind. -- Football Coach Lou Holtz today apologized to 
the University of Southern California's football team for a pregame brawl that 
erupted in the stadium tunnel before Saturday's USC-Notre Dame on the Irish's 
home field. 
</P>
<P>
"We take full responsibility for that thing occurring," the coach said in 
urging a written apology from his team. "We were completely out of line." 
</P>
<P>
 You can bet the Notre Dame coach is quick with an apology. 
</P>
<P>
It is, of course, easy to be magnanimous in victory. But, the issue goes deeper 
than that. 
</P>
<P>
You would never think it to look at them, their image in films and television 
and story books and the rich lore of collegiate football being what it is, but 
the Fighting Irish often skirt the thin line between ostracism and adulation. 
</P>
<P>
Their crime is evident: They win too much. 
</P>
<P>
If you think this sits well with their victims, you don't know college 
football. 
</P>
<P>
You see, you don't have to play Notre Dame. The Irish don't belong to your 
conference. They don't belong to any conference. You don't have to get through 
them to get to a bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
They are the bully boys of the Midwest. They annually have 80 or 90 of the best 
football players on the planet in their gold and blue (or, sometimes, Kelly 
green). They are the darlings of the subway alumni and the Cadillac Catholics 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Other sectors of the population are able to restrain their enthusiasm. In fact, 
the powers that be in the church have pretty much de-emphasized football at 
other major Catholic schools -- Fordham, the Loyolas, Holy Cross -- at least 
partly because their success tended to exacerbate anti-Catholic sentiment, 
polarize prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
It was all very well for Notre Dame to reign supreme when the Irish had Knute 
Rockne, the Four Horsemen, Hollywood films with Ronald Reagan playing the 
Gipper. They were part of the era of wonderful nonsense. Schoolboys hummed the 
fight song. Outlined against a blue-gray sky was the original America's team. 
</P>
<P>
Rockne was a publicly jovial showman and salesman, a canny old Norwegian who 
looked a little like Santa Claus and had an almost Churchillian wit and charm. 
It was darn near a pleasure to lose to Rockne. 
</P>
<P>
His successors were something else again. Fortunately, Hunk Anderson and Elmer 
Layden didn't win too much. Sometimes, not at all. 
</P>
<P>
But then along came Leahy -- and all the latent anti-Notre Dame sentiment 
surfaced. He gave it an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Leahy was no Rockne. He didn't charm anybody, he just beat them. Teams 
began dropping off the schedule like rats leaving a burning building. The 
storied Army series, the games that gave the country the legend of the Four 
Horsemen, the rivalry that filled Yankee Stadium and Soldier Field, was 
unceremoniously ended after 34 years. Michigan gave Notre Dame a wide berth. 
Woody Hayes at Ohio State wouldn't be caught dead -- or alive -- playing Notre 
Dame. 
</P>
<P>
There was a very real fear that Notre Dame would become the pariah of 
intercollegiate football. So they fired Leahy as a sop to those who contended 
that it was not the college that ticked them off but the coach. They even 
de-emphasized football, which was a mistake for Notre Dame. Their varsity began 
to look less like next year's Chicago Bears than this year's California Bears. 
</P>
<P>
I remember going to USC Coach Jeff Cravath in the critical period before Notre 
Dame dumped Leahy. The concern in South Bend was that they would lose Southern 
Cal, as the West Coast school was always identified in Hoosierland, and this 
would be a catastrophic public relations blow for the school that Rockne built. 
</P>
<P>
Cravath acknowledged that his colleagues were jumping off Notre Dame's schedule 
and trying to talk him into joining them. SC would not join the parade, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be the best if you don't play the best," Cravath told me. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't think Notre Dame was relieved, you underestimate the value they 
put on their Southern California connection, with its proximity to show 
business, sound stages, networks and swimming pool alumni. 
</P>
<P>
Ara Parseghian won just enough to keep the alumni happy -- and lost enough not 
to make the competition unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it's Lou Holtz's turn. He has Rockne's jokes -- but Leahy's teams. So, 
it's back to the tightrope. 
</P>
<P>
It's all very well to get in a pregame donnybrook with, say, the University of 
Miami. Notre Dame prizes the series but Miami's image, rightly or wrongly, is 
that of a bunch of thugs in pads. Harvard, it ain't. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California is something else again. Lou Holtz knows it. Notre Dame 
knows it. Ugly brawls between the two squads do not serve the image of the 
rivalry. Taunting does not serve Notre Dame's image. Too many people worked too 
many years to make the Irish-Trojan game what it has become, an American 
institution, to see it dissolved by a hoodlum rumble. 
</P>
<P>
An apology is a nice start. A cleanup of their act would be more to the point. 
Notre Dame has beaten up SC seven times in a row now. It would seem that the 
Irish could wait till the kickoff. Or, Holtz is afraid, they won't have SC to 
kick around anymore.

CASEY TUNES UP THE CLIPPERS BY KEEPING THINGS UPBEAT 
</P>

Ken Norman was there, and so were Charles Smith and Gary Grant and the rest of 
the Clippers, as expected. Then, the surprise guests materialized in the gym at 
Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Berry, came out of nowhere, followed by Jerry Lee Lewis. Ritchie Valens 
made his entrance, and Bill Haley and the Comets weren't far behind. Mozart 
came by about a week later, followed by the jazzy sounds of Maze. 
</P>
<P>
The first time "Johnny B. Goode" blasted from the loudspeakers, heads whirled 
around in amazement, as if Mr. Naismith himself had walked in. You bet, there 
was a whole lotta shakin' goin' on. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Don Casey didn't flinch, and with good reason. He had ordered the musical 
accompaniment, 1950s style, to a free-throw drill at the end of a recent 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people might have thought it was a bit unusual," said Dave Twardzik, 
Casey's first-year assistant who has spent 17 years in pro basketball as a 
player, broadcaster, front-office administrator and coach. "But when you go to 
games, they're always playing loud music before and then during important 
timeouts near the end, right?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes, but that wasn't the idea behind Casey's orchestrated move. Something 
about keeping the atmosphere loose would be more like it. 
</P>
<P>
So it has been in Casey's first training camp as permanent head coach and his 
first days truly in charge of the Clippers, after running the club for the 
final 44 games of 1988-89 as the interim boss. His imprint has been obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Such as the other day when he arrived at practice wearing a T-shirt given to 
him by his wife, Dwynne, poking fun at Casey's newness to the job. Against a 
gray background, the red lettering queried: 
</P>
<P>
HOW AM I COACHING? CALL 1-800-748-8000 
</P>
<P>
That would be the number of the Clipper offices at the Sports Arena. Casey 
admitted to stuffing the ballot box on the nonexistent survey, having voted 
five times -- all positive, of course. Players had one question before deciding 
whether to respond. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked if we had to leave our names," Joe Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
In all seriousness, his players are giving Casey, who spent nine years as the 
coach at Temple and six more as a National Basketball Assn. assistant, high 
marks nearly three weeks into his first pro training camp as a head coach. They 
say that the difference from Gene Shue, last season's coach, is especially 
evident in conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't do much running last year," Reggie Williams said. "I don't think the 
guys were 100% physically conditioned. All we did was run plays, a lot of 
half-court stuff. It's a lot more running this time." 
</P>
<P>
So they've noticed. "I don't remember last year exactly, but I know we're all 
feeling this now," Wolf said. "Our legs are saying, 'Hey, this is what it feels 
like to be in two-a-day (drills).' " 
</P>
<P>
Casey replaced Shue, a good friend, last Jan. 19, in the midst of a losing 
streak that eventually reached 19 games, equaling the franchise record for 
futility. 
</P>
<P>
Casey emphasized attitude: Don't play to not lose, have fun and ignore all 
comments sounding anything like, "Same old Clippers." 
</P>
<P>
It's the same keep-things-loose atmosphere that carried over to training camp. 
Come Nov. 3, when the Clippers play host to the Houston Rockets at the Sports 
Arena, Casey hopes it continues in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that this is a game," Twardzik said. "It's a job and you 
have to take it seriously, but you don't want drudgery and to get caught in a 
rut. It makes things like practice real difficult. (Casey) is great at keeping 
(the players) loose and ready to go. A lot of that is because of his 
personality, so there is a method to his madness." 
</P>
<P>
That madness helped Casey get a job he probably had little hope of landing 
permanently when he replaced Shue. The players responded by making the finish 
the best part of the season, beating Cleveland, Utah, Golden State and the 
Lakers, among others, to end, for them, on a high note. 
</P>
<P>
The upsets gave Casey an 11-33 record as interim coach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just about having fun," Casey said. "That's part of it, but a lot of 
the fun will come from success. I think you have to have that passion to get up 
and go to work every morning, and there's a lot of tension around here. There 
are guys fighting for jobs, guys fighting for contracts. (Keeping the 
atmosphere light) helps. 
</P>
<P>
"I want things more spontaneous than programmed. . . . We have so many miles to 
go before we can sleep, and I don't want to slack off or lighten up, but I 
don't want to burn them out." 
</P>
<P>
Casey knows the pitfalls all too well after his 44 games last season, when he 
paid close attention to the other head coaches in the league. He doesn't 
pattern himself after any of them but has tried to combine the attributes and 
demeanor of sharp dressers Pat Riley and Chuck Daly, with the folksy 
tennis-shoes approach of Don Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
They are three of the more successful leaders, although they cover quite a 
range in wardrobes. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I went out and bought some new clothes, to hang with Riley and 
Daly," Casey said. "I'll keep my old clothes to hang with Nelson."

</P>
<P>
GOLF: HUGE PURSE FOR SEASON-ENDING TOURNAMENT HAS BIG EFFECT ON FINAL 
MONEY-WINNING STANDINGS.

How much is too much? Some prominent golf pros say the size of the purse for 
this week's season-ending Nabisco Championships distorts the final 
money-winning standings on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they say that too much emphasis is placed on one tournament, negating 
to an extent what they've accomplished in previous months. 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute. Are the pros averse to making money? Hardly. However, the total 
purse of $2.5 million, with its winner's share of $450,000, for the tournament 
at Harbour Town Golf Links is almost twice as much as any other on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
It's a select field that will play in the event that begins today -- only the 
top 30 players on the money-winning list. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Strange became the tour's leading money-winner and the first player to 
earn more than $1 million in a season by defeating Tom Kite in a playoff in 
last year's championships at Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
He was seventh on the money list before the 1988 tournament. By winning, he not 
only became golf's first millionaire for one season, but was also named player 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
So one would think that Strange, currently the No. 8 money-winner, would favor 
the format. 
</P>
<P>
Not so. 
</P>
<P>
"Too much can change in one tournament at the end of the year," Strange said. 
"To play for this amount of money is fantastic. But the money title used to go 
to the guy who has played consistently well over the course of the year. That's 
not the case now. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever is in the top seven, eight, or nine who wins here will probably win 
the money title, and I don't think that's right. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened to me last year and I'm still not saying that's right. I don't 
mean to be critical, but we go through 10 months of playing a lot of hard golf, 
and one tournament decides it all." 
</P>
<P>
Payne Stewart, the leading money-winner on the tour this year with $825,301, 
agrees with Strange. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel so much emphasis should be placed on one tournament," he said. 
"We play all year to get to the state where we are right now. To win $625,000 
in one week is a hell of a year." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the purse for the tournament, the sponsor rewards players for 
season-long consistency with a $1-million total bonus, including a first-place 
prize of $175,000 to the player who is the leading money-winner at the end of 
the season. Thus the $625,000 figure mentioned by Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone can be so-so all year long and then win (this event)," Stewart said. 
"It doesn't necessarily show who is the best player of the year." 
</P>
<P>
"I think to have a big, big event at the end of the year is good," Strange 
said. "But to have something too far beyond the second-biggest purse is too 
much of a gap." 
</P>
<P>
Kite, the second-leading money-winner this year with earnings of $770,278, is 
comfortable with the format. Asked if he thought too much emphasis is placed on 
this tournament, Kite said: "There's no question it's a big tournament and the 
prize money is so much greater than the other tournaments. There is a lot of 
importance placed on this tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it's too much or not depends on opinions. We have been trying to have 
a year-end tournament that carries some weight and has some impact. It wasn't 
until (this event) came around that we were able to determine that." 
</P>
<P>
Earnings are escalating every year on the tour. It's possible that there will 
be two or three million-dollar winners in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Azinger and Greg Norman are third and fourth on the money list, having 
already earned $737,399 and $723,930. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Schulz, the 30th and last qualifier for this week's play, has earned 
$329,855. The 50th player on the money list, Jim Gallagher Jr., has earned 
$265,809. And so it goes. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, like Strange and Stewart, believes the payoff here is excessive. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if you're going to make this tournament the way it is, you shouldn't 
have it on the money list," Norman said. "Make it a special event that everyone 
wants to get in by their consistent performance throughout the year. You're 
talking about a $625,000 first-prize check for a percentage of the guys who are 
here. That's only $100,000 short of what I've won for the year. It doesn't 
balance out." 
</P>
<P>
Will dollar signs be dancing before the players' eyes when they tee off today? 
You bet. 
</P>
<P>
Said Strange: "I said the other day, half jokingly, that I'm going to rearrange 
my priorities this week. I'm in here for the cold, hard cash. How can you not 
think about it? But I'm going to do what I always do, play as well as I can and 
forget about the money until I finish 72 holes. But sometimes it's hard to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Strange ranks the par-71, 6,657-yard Harbour Town Golf Links, a public 
course, among the top five courses in the world -- even though he hasn't played 
well here. He missed the cut at the Heritage tournament last April, and his 
best finish in 10 appearances here is a tie for seventh place. "It tests all 
parts of your game," Strange said. "You have to have a well-rounded game to win 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Norman, the low pro with a 65 in Wednesday's pro-am, was also effusive in 
his praise of the course, saying, "I put it in the top five. If you play well, 
you're rewarded. If you play poorly, you suffer. There isn't any run on the 
soft fairways. It's a driver's course." . . . It has also been called a 
second-shot course because of the small greens that have been enlarged for the 
tournament but are still small in comparison to other greens on the tour. The 
course is lined with pine and live oak trees, with marshes forming a natural 
border on some holes. Even though it's a relatively short course by tour 
standards, it places a premium on shot making. 
</P>
<P>
Strange and Norman have boats docked near the 18th green at Harbour Town. 
Strange has a sportfishing boat aptly named, "Perfect Shot." Appropriately, 
Norman's boat is named, "Aussie Rules." 
</P>
<P>
When Payne Stewart left California in February, he said he and his wife were 
singing the blues. He had earned only $6,000 and had to withdraw from the 
Nissan Los Angeles Open and AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am because of 
recurring back problems. He has since been on an exercise program and has lost 
15 pounds, to 175. Nonetheless, his back is bothering him again and he said he 
has to go to the fitness trailer just to be able to play 18 holes. . . . 
Stewart, 32, won the Heritage tournament here earlier in the year with four 
rounds in the 60s and a record-breaking, 16-under-par 268. Then, Stewart, 
formerly a perennial runner-up on the tour, went on to win the PGA Championship 
at Kemper Lakes in Illinois last August. He said he has accomplished two of his 
career goals, winning a major tournament and being selected to the Ryder Cup 
team. 
</P>
<P>
PGA Tour Commissioner Deane Beman said any tour player who wins the British 
Open will be given a 10-year exemption for tour events starting next year. He 
also said the proposal that foreign players be required to play in 12 tour 
events to retain playing privileges has reverted to 15. . . . The PGA player of 
the year is determined on a point basis with emphasis on winning a major title 
along with position on the money list and scoring average.

IF DESORMEAUX RIDES, HE WINS

<P>
When Jim Bouton, the former pitcher, was a sportscaster in New York, it seemed 
to Bouton that basketball star Rick Barry was always scoring 30 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
One night Bouton started his program by saying: "Rick Barry's team didn't play 
tonight, but Rick still scored 30 points." 
</P>
<P>
If Maryland sportscasters are tempted to make similar announcements about Kent 
Desormeaux, one of them could have said Wednesday: "Laurel was closed today, 
but Kent Desormeaux still rode three winners." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, Desormeaux shouldn't need whimsical wins to break one 
of racing's oldest records: the 546 wins that Chris McCarron registered in 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux has won 489 races, and because of the favorites he frequently gets 
to ride, the 19-year-old jockey is a cinch to replace McCarron in the record 
book if he can avoid injuries and suspensions in the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to root for him because it's a goal that Kent set for himself two 
years ago, and he's worked awful hard to get there," McCarron said. "Last year, 
he was out for the record, too, but he got some suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
"If he gets my record, it'll be like losing a good friend, because for 15 years 
this has been something that I've been able to boast about." 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, McCarron was an apprentice who didn't win the first race of his career 
until Feb. 9. McCarron remembers having only 20 or 30 wins by the end of March, 
but got hot at Pimlico, averaging about two a day for two months. 
</P>
<P>
By then, his agent, Eddie Kinlaw, proposed that they shoot for Sandy Hawley's 
record of 515 wins, set the year before. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Eddie was nuts," McCarron said. "He wanted me to ride seven days a 
week, filling in the dark days in Maryland by going to Delaware Park and 
Monmouth Park." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, McCarron was also riding at Penn National, a night 
track about 100 miles from Baltimore. McCarron rode six winners in a day five 
times that year -- twice at Penn National and once apiece at Pimlico, Bowie and 
Laurel -- breaking Hawley's record on Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Darrel McHargue was second in the standings in 1974 with 405 wins, followed by 
Hawley with 373. Before Hawley set the record in 1973, it was held for 20 years 
by Bill Shoemaker, who won 485. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised my record has lasted as long as it has," McCarron said. "Now, 
with all the racing, a jock can ride seven days a week all year long. 
</P>
<P>
"Those 546 wins are the best thing I've ever done in racing. I've done things 
that were more thrilling, like winning the Kentucky Derby (with Alysheba in 
1987) and getting elected to the Hall of Fame (this year), but I'm awfully 
proud of what I did in 1974, because I did it only having one-fifteenth of the 
experience that I have now." 
</P>
<P>
For years, McCarron had license plates that read: "546 WINS." 
</P>
<P>
McCarron remembers serving three week-long suspensions in 1974, but he still 
rode in 2,199 races, a total not surpassed until Chris Antley appeared in 2,335 
races in 1985, when he led the country with 469 wins. 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux will probably ride in about 2,200 races this year. He has won with 
25.6% of his mounts. McCarron won with 24.8% in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux has a better chance of breaking the record than he has of being 
voted the Eclipse Award for best jockey. Neither Hawley nor McCarron won the 
award -- although McCarron received the honors for best apprentice -- in his 
record-breaking year. Laffit Pincay, whose horses earned an unprecedented $4 
million in purses in both 1973 and 1974, won the Eclipse both of those years. 
</P>
<P>
Eclipse voters -- turf writers, Daily Racing Form representatives and track 
racing secretaries -- usually look toward the jockeys who lead the money list 
and win the major stakes races. Through last Sunday, Desormeaux was ninth on 
the money list with purses of $7.3 million and he hasn't won a major race all 
year. Pat Day was No. 1 in money with $11.7 million, followed by Jose Santos 
with $10.6 million and Pincay with $9.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
All three of those jockeys will be riding several highly regarded horses on 
Breeders' Cup Day on Nov. 4 at Gulfstream Park, where $10 million in purses 
will be at stake. Desormeaux has a couple of mounts in the Breeders' Cup, but 
both will be longshots. 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Ron Hansen is undefeated in six tries while riding Simply Majestic, but 
he won't have the mount when the 5-year-old runs in the Breeders' Cup Mile at 
Gulfstream a week from Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer John Parisella said that Angel Cordero will ride Simply Majestic 
because Hansen wouldn't go to Calder, another South Florida track, to ride the 
horse in his Breeders' Cup prep last Saturday. Hansen, the second-leading rider 
at Bay Meadows, stayed there and finished second on Variety Road in the 
Tanforan Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it when Ron and his agent said he wouldn't come to Florida 
to ride," Parisella said. "They wanted to take off the Calder race but still 
ride in the Breeders' Cup. But it just doesn't work that way. Using Cordero 
isn't exactly going to the bench." 
</P>
<P>
The Calder race was for $150,000, which was $50,000 more than the Bay Meadows 
stake. Herb Castillo, who had a one-race deal with Parisella, rode Simply 
Majestic to victory at Calder. Cordero has won with Simply Majestic before, and 
finished third with him in last year's Breeders' Cup Mile. 
</P>
<P>
When John Henry won a division of the Henry P. Russell Handicap at Santa Anita 
in 1979, it was his first stakes win in California and his first for trainer 
Ron McAnally. Under McAnally, John Henry won two horse-of-the-year titles and 
earned $6.5 million, a record until Alysheba broke it in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Anita will run the Russell Handicap again Saturday and John Henry will be 
there. But as a 14-year-old, he will not be running. John Henry is scheduled to 
arrive today from Lexington, Ky., where he lives at the Kentucky Horse Park, to 
be the grand marshal for a two-day Oak Tree Racing Assn. project called 
Eque-Fest. 
</P>
<P>
Modeled after Belmont Park's Horse Fair, a week-long show that has preceded the 
Belmont Stakes the last two years, Eque-Fest will feature about 90 horses, 
including a variety of breeds other than thoroughbreds. 
</P>
<P>
John Henry, who was retired in 1984, returned to Santa Anita in 1986 and was 
paraded between races on Breeders' Cup day. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sky Classic, who would have been Canada's best hope for a Breeders' Cup win, 
wasn't made eligible for the Juvenile because the 2-year-old colt suffered a 
hairline fracture in his right rear leg. Sky Classic, who had four straight 
wins after second-place finishes in his first two starts, was shipped to 
Florida in preparation for the Breeders' Cup, but was lame after a workout last 
week. . . . Safely Kept, undefeated in eight races this year and a candidate 
for the Breeders' Cup Sprint, was offered at auction at Laurel last Sunday and 
attracted no bidders. The reserve price -- the least she could be sold for -- 
on the 3-year-old filly was $1.2 million. . . . Trainer Ron McAnally will have 
two starters in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile -- Single Dawn and Balla Cove, an 
English-raced colt who will be making his first start on dirt. . . . Akinemod 
won for the fourth time in five starts Wednesday, going wire-to-wire in the 
$82,650 Cascapedia Handicap at Santa Anita. Akinemod, a 3-year-old filly ridden 
by Gary Stevens,paid $5.40, $3.80 and $3.20 and ran seven furlongs in 1:22 2/5. 
Miss Tawpie was second and Hasty Pasty was third.

Five football players at Hart High School in Newhall were arrested on suspicion 
of kidnaping after allegedly forcing a 17-year-old girl into a van and 
abandoning her in a remote canyon, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
In what deputies said appeared to be a prank that went out of control, the 
girl, a senior at the high school, suffered three minor cuts to her right leg 
when she tripped over a chain as she tried to run away from the boys. She did 
not seek medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The boys apparently were trying to send a message that they were angered by a 
series of pranks against them by girls at the school, Sgt. Greg Palmieri said. 
The kidnaped girl was not involved in those pranks, he said. She suffered 
bruises on her arms and upper thighs when the boys grabbed her and forced her 
into the van, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The boys were arrested Tuesday at the high school and were released to their 
parents pending the outcome of an investigation, Palmieri said. The sheriff's 
station was contacted by the girl's father.

An assistant coach and a football player at St. Genevieve High School in 
Panorama City have been suspended for two games and one game, respectively, for 
their involvement in a fight during last Friday's 45-6 loss to Chaminade. 
</P>
<P>
Another player and coach have been reprimanded by St. Genevieve Coach Mark 
Lovett in connection with the fight, which started when a St. Genevieve player 
blindsided a Chaminade punt returner after the latter had called for a fair 
catch and the whistle had blown. The names weren't released.

San Francisco 49er defensive back Jeff Fuller isn't injured as seriously as 
doctors had feared, but it is uncertain whether he will be able to play again. 
</P>
<P>
Fuller was originally diagnosed as having suffered multiple neck fractures and 
damaged nerves in Sunday's game against the New England Patriots, but it has 
since been determined that he chipped three vertebrae in his neck, the team 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fuller has been moved from the intensive care unit at Stanford University 
Hospital, where he has regained some feeling in his right arm.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 25 YEARS TO LIFE GIVEN IN DEATH OF UNBORN 
CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 35-year-old San Pedro woman convicted of deliberately running over a pregnant 
acquaintance and killing her unborn child has been sentenced in Long Beach 
Superior Court to 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Charles Sheldon ordered the prison term for Brenda Sue 
Franklin, 35, on a Sept. 22 conviction of first-degree murder and attempted 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors found Franklin guilty of driving over Barbara Ochoa, who was in her 
early 40s, and dragging the victim six blocks, inflicting massive road burns 
and fracturing her pelvis. Ochoa delivered a stillborn child the next day. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Cynthia Zuzga, said the two women had 
engaged in a angry, drug-related argument on June 10, when Franklin jumped into 
her car, gunned the engine and drove at Ochoa, who was standing near the front 
of the auto. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa, who is still in the hospital, was not called to testify because of her 
injuries and post-birth depression, Zuzga said.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHARITIES SUE UNITED WAY OVER PAYROLL 
DEDUCTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three charities filed a $6-million suit Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court 
against United Way of Los Angeles and United Way of California, claiming they 
have been denied a fair chance to get payroll deduction donations from 
California's state employees. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that United Way used a pledge system that encourages 
contributions to United Way agencies, but which makes it difficult to donate to 
non-United Way charities. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, which also names the state as a defendant, was filed by Combined 
Health Appeal, International Services Agency and Environmental Federation of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
After the suit was filed, the plaintiffs sought and obtained from Superior 
Court Judge Miriam Vogel a temporary restraining order barring United Way of 
Los Angeles from distributing pledge cards to state employees without attaching 
designation cards which allow donors to give to non-United Way charities. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing for a preliminary injunction on the matter will be held Nov. 16. 
United Way attorney Framroze Virjee said in court, "I believe the campaign 
we're running now is fair and in compliance with the law." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles United Way is in the midst of a $95-million fund-raising effort for 
its 350 human service and health agencies.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 70% OF TUNNELING FOR SUBWAY SYSTEM FINISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 70% of the tunneling needed to finish the Rapid Transit District's 
4.4-mile subway system in Los Angeles has been completed, RTD officials 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
After five months of work on the system, contractors completed the tunnel 
segment between the Pershing Square Station and the 7th Street/Metro Center 
Station, RTD General Manager Alan Pegg said. 
</P>
<P>
The project has been running "a couple of months behind schedule because of 
unforeseen delays, including larger than usual rocks and contaminated soil," 
said Greg Davy, an RTD spokesman. Excavations will be completed in early 1990, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 7th Street/Metro Center Station will serve both subway and light rail lines 
that are under construction. RTD is scheduled to begin operating the Los 
Angeles to Long Beach Light Rail Line in July, 1990. The Light Rail will use 
only a small portion of tunneled area, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Opening of the twin-tunnel subway system, which will stretch from Union Station 
to a terminal at the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and Alvarado Street, 
was originally slated for April, 1992. It is now scheduled for September, 1993, 
Davy said.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: L.A. FILES $18.5-MILLION CLAIM FOR ASBESTOS 
WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles city attorney's office filed a claim Wednesday for $18.5 
million from a fund set up by the Manville Corp. to pay some of the costs of 
asbestos cleanup in city buildings. 
</P>
<P>
However, the city expects to recover only 12 to 40 cents on the dollar for its 
claim, filed as part of Manville's bankruptcy case in New York, according to 
Deputy City Atty. Marcia Haber Kamine. 
</P>
<P>
The city should receive the money within six to nine months, she said, and it 
will be used to help pay the costs of asbestos surveys and cleanups in city 
buildings that began in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Manville, which was a major producer of asbestos products, filed a bankruptcy 
petition in 1982 after it became the target of thousands of product liability 
lawsuits. Asbestos has been shown to be a potent carcinogen. 
</P>
<P>
Several special trusts for asbestos cleanup and compensation of victims have 
been established as part of the bankruptcy proceedings. The city funds would 
come from those trusts. 
</P>
<P>
A third of the city's claim involves the cost of removing asbestos from 
Department of Water and Power facilities, where the cancer-causing substance 
was once used extensively as insulation in power plants.

LITTLE MARKET THAT COULD: IT NO LONGER CAN; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: COMPETITION AND FALLING PROFITS SPELL DOOM FOR A VENERABLE 
'MOM-AND-POP' OPERATION. IT WILL MAKE WAY FOR A NEW RETAIL CENTER.

<P>
Dwarfed by modern supermarkets and threatened by shrinking profits, it was the 
little market that could. 
</P>
<P>
Now it can't. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside Market, which has stood at the same North Hollywood intersection for 
more than 40 years, will close early next month. The property is being sold to 
a developer who may replace it with a retail center containing a bank, gift 
shop and real estate brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the end of a neighborhood institution," said Tom Paterson, president of 
the Valley Village Homeowners Assn. "There aren't very many like it around." 
</P>
<P>
Three generations of the Damus family have run the one-story, white grocery 
store at Riverside Drive and Laurel Canyon Boulevard since it opened in the 
mid-1940s. Back then it was an open-air market and offered locally grown 
oranges, corn and apricots. Despite diminishing annual returns -- last year's 
profits plunged to only about $25,000 -- the family has kept the store open 
until 2 a.m. daily, 365 days a year. 
</P>
<P>
Now the market, which was enclosed in the 1950s and has low ceilings and 
exposed rafters, looks half-naked, with its shelves stripped of canned goods 
and freezers sitting empty. 
</P>
<P>
"It was our second home for 40 years, but it can't be helped," said Vic Damus 
Sr., 70, who bought the store eight months before the end of World War II. The 
elder Damus has leukemia and has largely left the closing of the store and the 
dismissal of its 15 employees to his son Mike and other children. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a tough situation all along because of Price Club and the warehouse 
supermarkets," said Mike Damus, 33. "There's a 50-50 chance we'll relocate in 
south Van Nuys or Studio City." 
</P>
<P>
The "mom-and-pop" stores are "a dying breed" and are closing all over the 
state, said Don Beaver, president of the Sacramento-based California Grocers 
Assn. Beaver said his group does not keep such statistics, but he estimates 
that close to half of the state's 20,000 grocery stores are former small 
markets that have been converted to quick-stop convenience stores. 
</P>
<P>
"It's progress," Beaver said. 
</P>
<P>
A woman shopping in the Riverside Market this week agreed, saying she "never 
trusted" the store because its meat and produce is displayed in older cases 
instead of shiny new ones. But longtime patron Roger Knight, a movie set 
dresser in his late 30s, said the store's passing will leave a void in the 
community. Knight was buying rabbit and stuffed pork chops, prepared to order 
by the store's butcher. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of place that if you were short on cash, they'd let you go 
home and bring back the money later," Knight said. "It has a neighborhood feel. 
I wish they'd find another place for that shopping center." 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a little piece of home," said Patt Bellevilli, 28, who moved from 
Detroit to North Hollywood last year. "I hate big grocery stores because you 
never meet your neighbors there." 
</P>
<P>
The property is being bought by Long Beach developer Bob Champion, who declined 
Tuesday to reveal the purchase price. One of the conditions of sale was that 
the market and a nearby florist shop and shoe repair store be vacated, said Tom 
Leanse, an attorney for the Damus family. 
</P>
<P>
Champion said he may raze the stores and build three one-story buildings that 
would be occupied by a bank and other new businesses. Another option is to 
renovate the existing buildings, but he said they are in poor condition. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs, who occasionally shops at the market, 
said he hopes Champion will consult with residents' groups before developing 
the property. If Champion does not, "then to the extent that I have leverage, 
I'll use it" to influence city decisions on development of the site, Wachs 
said.

STUDY OF L.A. RIVER FREEWAY PLAN AUTHORIZED BY COUNTY PANEL; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: USE OF THE WATERWAY IS SEEN AS A WAY TO REDUCE CONGESTION AS 
MUCH AS 20% ON TWO HEAVILY USED ROADWAYS, BUT ENVIRONMENTALISTS OBJECT.

Over the protests of environmentalists, the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission on Wednesday authorized a $100,000 study to determine the 
feasibility of turning 30 or 40 miles of the Los Angeles River into a part-time 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial proposal by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) would create 
exclusive express lanes for buses, car pools and trucks along the winding 
floodway that extends from the San Fernando Valley through downtown Los Angeles 
to Long Beach. Most of the waterway was paved half a century ago to control 
flash flooding and carry waste water. 
</P>
<P>
No one is certain if such a project would work or how much it would cost. But 
according to Katz, chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee, the river 
traffic lanes would relieve as much as 20% of the congestion on the Ventura and 
Long Beach freeways. Critics say the scheme is not practical, would harm the 
environment and would be dangerous when storms send floodwaters raging down the 
concrete channels. 
</P>
<P>
However, the commission's preliminary study found "no fatal flaws" in the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Consultants, after an initial look at the proposal, reported, "With modest 
improvements . . . the Los Angeles River and Tujunga Wash flood control 
channels could be used for transportation purposes between 220 and 300 days a 
year." 
</P>
<P>
As Katz envisions the route, the northern sections from the Valley south to 
Glendale and into downtown would be used by car pools, van pools and buses, 
weather permitting. The southern segments of the river expressway would be 
reserved for trucks running between the harbor and downtown. Trucks now 
primarily use the Long Beach Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, led by the environmental group Friends of the River, contend that 
such construction would destroy the fragile ecosystems that support green 
vegetation and wildlife along some segments of the river channel that are not 
paved. Hiking and equestrian trails near Griffith Park would be adversely 
effected, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of diverting traffic into the river bottom and adding to urban 
congestion and air pollution, Lewis MacAdams, spokesman for the environmental 
group, called for a green belt, parks and more trails along the river, 
returning it to a more natural state. 
</P>
<P>
The issues of safety and liability in the event of flash flooding were raised 
by Commissioner Ray Grabinski, a Long Beach city councilman who is concerned 
that motorists might get trapped in a flood. 
</P>
<P>
"Who is responsible?" he asked Katz, who had spelled out the proposal for the 
commission a few minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said the $100,000 study was needed to answer such questions, adding, "This 
may not be the answer to the transportation crisis in Los Angeles . . . but we 
have to look at what resources we have, see how we can get ourselves out of 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The commission authorized the study on a voice vote and directed that the 
questions of safety and liability be answered. The study will also determine 
how to handle the treated sewage that now flows down the river, an issue raised 
by opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Consultants doing the study will also have to determine if the freeway lanes 
could be built without interfering with the flood control functions of the 
waterway. The freeway work would have to be coordinated with the Army Corps of 
Engineers, which has overall responsibility for the floodway. 
</P>
<P>
A financial plan would also be developed during the study, spelling out how 
much the project would cost and how it would be financed.

$3.1 MILLION TIED TO SYLMAR DRUGS FOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. and Mexican narcotics agents have seized more than $3.1 million in cash at 
northern Mexico houses owned by two men suspected of engineering the sale of 
21.4 tons of cocaine found last month at a Sylmar warehouse, a spokesman for 
the Mexican attorney general's office said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A portion of the money discovered at the residences of Carlos Enrique Tapia 
Ponce, 68, and his son, Hector Tapia Anchondo, 38, was profits from the record 
cocaine stash discovered in the Sept. 28 raid, said attorney general's 
spokesman Rene Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Tapia Ponce of Juarez, Mexico, and Tapia Anchondo of El Paso, Tex., were among 
six men indicted Tuesday in connection with the drug bust. 
</P>
<P>
The money, found buried in three locations near three of the family's houses, 
included $1.7 million in U.S. currency discovered Monday in a cistern near the 
suspects' house in Ciudad Juarez, Hernandez said. In addition, authorities 
found strongboxes packed with $952,000 and $544,000 at the two other houses. 
</P>
<P>
"A large part of this money is from the sale of the cocaine that was found in 
Los Angeles," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
Tapia Ponce and Tapia Anchondo profited only from the "uncut" cocaine that came 
into the United States, said Hernandez, adding that only three tons of drugs 
found in the warehouse were judged pure. 
</P>
<P>
But Hernandez said he did not know exactly how much of the money came from the 
sale of the cocaine found in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
A day after the Sylmar raid, authorities arrested Tapia Anchondo in Mexico and 
Tapia Ponce in Las Vegas. They are being held without bail and are expected to 
be arraigned Monday in Los Angeles.

HONOR AND APPLAUSE FOR TEDDY EDWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a lifetime of labor in jazz, tenor saxophonist Teddy Edwards was honored 
by his hometown Tuesday with a proclamation from Mayor Tom Bradley and a 
lifetime achievement award from the musician's union, a union that once 
wouldn't have him as a member because of his color. 
</P>
<P>
So how does a working musician spend a day that honors him? He spends it 
working -- in this case at the Biltmore Hotel's Grand Ave. Bar, where a packed 
house enthusiastically greeted the saxophonist's brand of straightahead jazz. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh man," said Edwards before his hourlong opening set," in Europe I could work 
all the time. Here it's tougher, but I'm not gonna move to Europe, even though 
they're always telling me I should. I figure I got one big payday here." 
</P>
<P>
Though it's doubtful his big payday was Tuesday, Edwards, the lone horn in an 
acoustic quartet, proved himself once again as the hard-working saxophonist 
whose metier embraces the three Bs of jazz: be-bop, ballads and the blues. 
</P>
<P>
"Jordu," an up-tempo piece by Duke Jordan, served as the set's opener and 
introduced the impressive piano skills of Eric Reed. Edwards, feet firmly 
planted on the stage, closed his eyes and delivered the first of several brief 
solos, limiting his improvised excursions to a couple of choruses. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of Edward's compositions followed: "Get Up and Get It," was a fast-paced 
blues, and "Sunset Eyes," a piece Edwards first performed with the original 
Clifford Brown-Max Roach Quintet in 1954. Both pieces showed Edward's sense of 
innovation as a writer (especially the latter tune, which featured a 
back-and-forth flow of Latin and swing rhythms) and each served as good solo 
vehicles for the saxophonist and pianist. 
</P>
<P>
A contrast of styles was evidenced in Edward's inclusion of Miles Davis's "Half 
Nelson," an easily paced bop tune, and "Going Home," a briskly paced swinger 
that showed a more modernist side. 
</P>
<P>
The set's only ballad inclusion was "You Are Too Beautiful," a gorgeous, 
languid piece in which Edward's sultry tones were given full exposure in an 
unaccompanied cadenza. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Reed proved himself a marvelous soloist throughout the set and provided 
apt accompaniment, easily picking up on Edward's style. Bassist Tom Gargano and 
drummer Ralph Penland also performed well, with the latter spurring the rhythms 
with flawless ease.A. JAMES LISKA

A THOUGHT-PROVOKING SIX-PART 'AMERICA'S CENTURY' ON PBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you've ever known the feeling of returning to an old house you thought you 
knew, only to experience it again as if for the first time, then watching 
"America's Century" (at 10 tonight on Channel 28) will bring that feeling back. 
One of writer-host Lewis Lapham's points in this six-part series is that the 
United States needs to retrieve its own history and, with it, a sober sense of 
its position in the world. 
</P>
<P>
It took the British (Panoptic Productions and Channel 4) to produce one of the 
most remarkable contributions to that cause ever shown on television. 
</P>
<P>
Since the death of Edward Abbey, Lapham is arguably this country's most 
brilliant essayist, holding forth each month in the magazine he edits, 
Harper's. He is almost alone among commentators in rising above ideological 
niches, establishing a firmly personal and informed view that combines a more 
soulful version of Henry Kissinger's Realpolitik with a less caustic version of 
Gore Vidal's anti-imperialism. Like an intellectual alley cat, he slips through 
the 20th Century's violent darkness, making his mark before it's registered in 
the mind. 
</P>
<P>
To write fine essays is one thing; to blend the essay's economy and depth with 
the powerful iconography of newsreel footage is another. Producer-directors 
Susan Crowther and Peter Bate, combining old film and new interviews with a 
wide range of American observers, have managed to put Lapham's ideas into high 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
In the first two episodes screened for review, "Coming of Age" and "Familiar 
Enemies," the overwhelming sense is of an innocent United States, adolescent of 
mind yet adult in economic capacity. Teddy Roosevelt leads the charge 
everywhere: San Juan Hill, the Philippines, anywhere the Navy can travel. 
Millions flee Europe for a big land where they can start a new life. The Old 
World burns, and the New World resembles a big toy store. 
</P>
<P>
Then, like a nightmare after a long slumber, World War I, the Depression and 
Hitler rumble in, with a brief pause for Calvin Coolidge and the Jazz Age. And, 
with our new global role, the Republic gained its own tragic figures, like that 
sublimely stunted idealist, Woodrow Wilson. Watching this, you have to pinch 
yourself: This is one great story. 
</P>
<P>
Like all great stories, Lapham's is full of contradictions and absurdities, 
such as the images of American troops traipsing across the Russian snow, trying 
to defeat the newly victorious Bolsheviks. Or the innocent faces of German 
youth, which so resemble their American counterparts, singing "Our Hitler Is 
Our Lord" in a prim classroom. Or the attempts by the media to depict the 
murderous Stalin to the American public as a father figure. 
</P>
<P>
The archival achievement here cannot be overemphasized. Film footage of Lenin 
and Stalin speaking in Red Square, of passengers leaping like ants off of 
luxury vessels hit by German U-boats, of Nikita Khrushchev watching Shirley 
MacLaine perform "Can-Can," almost threaten to drown Lapham's extraordinary 
narration. 
</P>
<P>
But not narration like this, on U.S. foreign policy in the early part of the 
century: "Nobody entertained the image of overseas American empire. Among the 
privileged and well-educated classes, a few very polite gentlemen entertained 
an eccentric interest in diplomacy. But, for the most part, they were amateurs, 
the kind of people who joined the State Department in order to spare their 
mothers the indignity of a baggage search when passing through foreign 
customs." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, "America's Century," though a powerful critique of U.S. global reach, 
adopts no political line. It can't, when the interview subjects run the gamut 
from George McGovern to Milton Friedman, from Hamilton Fish to Gen. Curtis 
LeMay. There is no substitute for reading, but to miss "America's Century" is 
to miss a piece of history.

'PRIVATE AFFAIRS' TEACHES TEENS TRUST AND RESPONSIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today's "ABC Afterschool Special" for teens is a shining moment for the series. 
In "Private Affairs," at 3 p.m. on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42, best friends learn 
about trust and betrayal and the audience gets a lesson in sexual 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
The primary focus in the script by Brenda Wilson and Neil Baer is Madeline 
(Kerri Greene), a together teen, happily organizing the big school dance. Her 
self-confidence is shattered when she finds out that Dad (Dean Butler) is 
having an affair with Mom's best friend. Should she tell Mom (Kay Lenz)? Should 
she confront Dad? Does it mean divorce? 
</P>
<P>
A sympathetic adult (Lynne Thigpen) offers comfort and the name of a counselor 
to give Madeline a lifeline. Histrionics are avoided; the moments of anguish 
are understated and truthful. The outcome is tentative. 
</P>
<P>
But the vital core of the show is what happens to Madeline's friend Lindy (Amy 
Lynne). She and her first love, Nickel (Christopher Collet), have had sex -- 
without contraception. No, she doesn't get pregnant, but neither of them knows 
that a former girlfriend has given him gonorrhea. 
</P>
<P>
When Nickel finds out, he receives treatment -- and advice -- from an earnest 
doctor (Michael Warren), who lets the unhappy teen know kindly but firmly that 
he must tell Lindy. The doctor cautions him to use a condom in the future, to 
lower the risks of pregnancy and venereal disease. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he gives Nickel a condom to carry. There's no sidestepping. 
</P>
<P>
Can so much Angst and its resolution be delivered, with conviction, in an hour? 
Not without a convenient plot that includes sympathetic adults and peers and 
easily obtainable medical help. The uniformly fine cast, a responsible script 
and sensitive direction from Baer bring it all home. LYNNE HEFFLEY

CATALINA WANTS OUT OF SMOG DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: AVALON OFFICIALS CAN'T SEE BEING LUMPED WITH LOS ANGELES IN CLEAN 
AIR ENFORCEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Avalon city officials and business owners, arguing that Santa Catalina Island's 
air is pristine and does not contribute to pollution in the Los Angeles Basin, 
want out of the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter presented to an AQMD official last week, Catalina Chamber of 
Commerce President George A. Escofie disputed the logic of having islanders 
conform to the district's air quality regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The island's business community, he wrote, "simply fails to understand its 
contribution to the air quality problems of the Los Angeles Basin or the 
inclusion of Catalina Island in the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District." 
</P>
<P>
The letter asks that AQMD boundaries be redrawn to exclude the largely 
undeveloped, 76-square-mile island from the district. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say that although the smog district's geographic boundaries are 
drawn along county lines, Catalina could become part of another, less-urban 
district, or the island's unique location could be considered when permit fees 
for smog-emitting equipment are levied. As a third alternative, they suggested 
forming a new Channel Islands air quality district outside the 41 existing 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got 22 miles of open water between us and the balance of the district, 
and we don't see that we're in the same air basin," City Manager Chuck Prince 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The movement was sparked by recent visits to several island businesses by AQMD 
officials, who have begun notifying small businesses countywide of new permit 
fees and requirements for certain kinds of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the increased attention on the island results from the district having 
redrawn -- in late 1988 -- its list of equipment for which permits are needed. 
Claudia Keith, an AQMD spokeswoman, said a lot of equipment that previously did 
not require permits was added to the list, including restaurant broilers, 
bakery ovens and cleaning equipment at dry-cleaning stores. 
</P>
<P>
In Avalon, an AQMD inspector notified owners at more than half a dozen 
businesses with such equipment that they would have to get permits and pay 
fees. The businesses included the Avalon Hospital, a golf cart rental facility, 
the Southern California Edison electrical generating plant and several 
restaurants, Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
Avalon merchants argued that the fees are exorbitant and wonder how they will 
help clean up the air. 
</P>
<P>
"For our little island it gets to be a pain in the butt, all the rigmarole they 
put us through," said a secretary who fills out air quality reports for a waste 
disposal business on the island. "They're treating us like a big city." 
</P>
<P>
Islanders cite a number of reasons why Catalina is different from everywhere 
else. For example, the number of cars in Avalon is limited by city ordinance to 
about 800. The state Department of Motor Vehicles has already excluded Avalon 
from smog certificate requirements, and about half the residents walk to work 
in the one-square-mile town, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The tourist-oriented island -- 86% of which is preserved by a nonprofit 
conservancy in its natural state -- has virtually no heavy industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the air here is beautiful," said Wayne Griffin, executive director of 
the Catalina Chamber of Commerce.

COLUMBIA S&amp;L PUTS ITS LOSS AT $226.3 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
EARNINGS: THE BEVERLY HILLS THRIFT SAID NEW REGULATIONS AND LOWER PRICES IN THE 
JUNK BOND MARKET FORCED IT TO DEVALUE ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

<P>
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan, the Beverly Hills thrift that has bet heavily on 
high-yield, high-risk junk bonds to produce profits, disclosed a $226.3-million 
quarterly loss Wednesday stemming from the recent hammering of the junk bond 
market combined with the effect of new federal thrift regulations. 
</P>
<P>
In taking the loss for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, Columbia is devaluing 
its junk bonds and other investments by $357 million, a reflection of the 
sagging prices that the bonds are fetching in the market. Columbia executives 
said the thrift's junk bond portfolio is now valued at $3.75 billion, or about 
30% of Columbia's $12.7 billion in total assets. 
</P>
<P>
Under normal circumstances, Columbia would not have to devalue the bonds to 
their market values and suffer a loss, provided that it could make a case that 
it planned to hold the junk bonds until they mature instead of selling them to 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
But Columbia is prohibited from holding most of its bonds to maturity by the 
new thrift legislation signed into law by President Bush in August. That law 
requires Columbia and other thrifts to divest themselves of junk bonds before 
July 1, 1994. About 85% of Columbia's junk bonds mature after that date. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bond prices have suffered in recent weeks from a number of developments, a 
major one being problems surfacing at high-profile, junk bond-financed concerns 
such as Robert Campeau's Allied Stores and Merv Griffin's Resorts 
International. 
</P>
<P>
Investors also are growing reluctant to buy junk bonds because of economic 
uncertainty and the recent stock market turmoil, which tends to chase investors 
away from riskier investments into safer ones. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia, under the leadership of Chief Executive Thomas Spiegel, has forged 
close ties to Drexel Burnham Lambert and its junk bond division, riding the 
boom in junk bonds earlier this decade to huge profits. Columbia for several 
years has been one of the nation's most profitable thrifts, earning $193.5 
million in 1986 alone. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Columbia is pumping $227.3 million into its reserves for losses 
that it expects on its holdings. Beyond that, Columbia is marking down the 
value of its overall junk bond portfolio by an additional $130.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The $226.3-million quarterly loss, a record for Columbia, contrasts with a 
profit of $16.3 million earned a year earlier. In the nine months ended Sept. 
30, Columbia lost $212 million, in contrast with a profit of $48.7 million in 
the year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia is not the only thrift to write down its junk bonds. Imperial Corp. of 
America, the San Diego-based parent of Imperial Savings, earlier disclosed its 
after-tax losses from its junk bond holdings will total $88.9 million for the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Some 200 thrifts nationwide own junk bonds, although none hold anywhere near 
the amount owned by Columbia. Analysts have estimated that thrifts may write 
down as much as $1 billion in their portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
"They might as well step up to the line and take it," said Donald H. 
Livingstone, a partner in Los Angeles with the Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. 
accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia said there was no pressure from regulators to increase reserves for 
the junk-bond holdings. Executives added that they chose to devalue its entire 
portfolio, including those bonds that mature before 1994, to give it 
flexibility in selling them. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss, Columbia executives said the thrift's capital position 
remains strong, well in excess of federal standards required under the new 
thrift bailout. 
</P>
<P>
As of Sept. 30, Columbia's tangible equity as a percentage of its assets stood 
at 3.6%, meaning that the thrift has about $3.60 of its own money invested for 
every $100 in assets. That number, however, is down from 5.2% before the 
accounting adjustments were made. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia said it believes that after it makes it accounting adjustments, it 
will rank third in its percentage of equity to capital among California 
thrifts, behind Great Western and Home Federal. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Columbia executives said the thrift holds valuable assets in the 
form of warrants, options and other securities issued in corporate buyouts and 
restructurings. They said those securities cost $90 million but are expected to 
ultimately produce gains of $200 million to $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia executives said they wrote off about $35.6 million in junk bond 
investments in the quarter, the amount of which was taken out of the reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's reserves against junk bond losses, which act as a cushion, now total 
$300 million, or nearly 7% of its junk bond portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia executives said they believe that amount is more than adequate. 
Accountants and analysts said it is difficult to determine whether the amount 
is enough because Columbia's operation is so different from those of other 
thrifts due to its junk bond activity and the fact its bond holdings are a 
closely guarded secret.

ALLAIS: "WALL STREET HAS BECOME A VERITABLE CASINO."; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETS: NOBEL LAUREATE MAURICE ALLAIS SAYS THE WEAKNESSES ON THE GLOBAL 
EXCHANGES ARE THE SAME AS THOSE THAT LED TO THE 1929 CRASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dan Fisher and Rone Tempest, The questions in the following interview were 
posed by Los Angeles Times London bureau chief Dan Fisher. Allais' responses 
were translated from the French by Times Paris bureau chief Rone Tempest in 
consultation with the economist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Loose credit practices, insufficient margin requirements and computerized 
trading on a nonstop world market have produced the volatile climate that now 
characterizes Wall Street, French economist Maurice Allais said in an interview 
with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wall Street has become a veritable casino," said Allais, 78, a market 
theorist who won the 1988 Nobel Prize for economics. "In fact, the weaknesses 
of Wall Street today are the same as those that led to the crash of 1929. They 
are simply more marked." 
</P>
<P>
 Allais, retired professor at the elite Ecole Nationale Superieure des Mines in 
Paris, is recognized as one of the leading researchers into the functioning of 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Allais is a fountain of original and independent discovery," American 
economist Paul Samuelson said of the French scholar at the time of the Nobel 
award. "Had his earlier writings been in English, a generation of economic 
theory would have taken a different course." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his influence on younger French economists, Allais has rarely been 
interviewed outside France. The questions in the following interview were posed 
by Los Angeles Times London bureau chief Dan Fisher. Allais' responses were 
translated from the French by Times Paris bureau chief Rone Tempest in 
consultation with the economist. 
</P>
<P>
Question: In view of the 190-point drop in the Dow on Friday, Oct. 13, and a 
sharp climb of 88 points on Monday, Oct. 16, do you think the Wall Street 
system has gone mad? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I wouldn't say that Wall Street has gone mad. The reality is that the 
institutional framework in which Wall Street operates is fundamentally 
inappropriate, and it inevitably generates violent fluctuations of the market. 
</P>
<P>
What must necessarily happen, inevitably does. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you see this as reflecting some flaw in the American character? Or are 
the violent swings in the Dow Jones average just a price we have to pay for the 
world's increasingly interrelated financial markets? 
</P>
<P>
A: It is not a flaw particular to the American character. The European and 
Asian markets suffer from the same flaws. 
</P>
<P>
The interrelations between today's nonstop 24-hour financial markets are 
totally excessive and harmful. They are not at all necessary for the working of 
the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
I note, for example, that more than $400 billion is exchanged every day on the 
foreign exchange markets, while the flow of commercial transactions is only 
about $12 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do you see as the main weaknesses of the American markets? 
</P>
<P>
A: First, excessive financing of speculation by means of payment created ex 
nihilo by the mechanism of credit; second, insufficient margin requirements for 
all the futures speculators; third, the continuous trading market, which is an 
aberration from an economic viewpoint and generates a potentially permanent 
instability favoring fraud and manipulation of the market -- I think a single 
daily price quotation in each place for each stock would be by far preferable 
and would benefit both small and large investors, fourth, the automatic 
computerized buy and sell orders associated with continuous trading. 
</P>
<P>
Because of these four factors, Wall Street has become a veritable casino. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the weaknesses of Wall Street today are the same as those which led to 
the crash of 1929. They are simply more marked. 
</P>
<P>
It is understandable that the Fed injects cash to avoid the collapse of the 
stock market, but basically it is bad policy for monetary authorities to 
intervene to save speculators from bankruptcy. This is not their role. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation would be useful if, and only if, these four major structural 
defects I mentioned are remedied. 
</P>
<P>
Today's system is anti-economic and basically unfavorable to the American 
system. It benefits only a very small minority. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do you think about the whole takeover phenomenon? Junk bonds? 
</P>
<P>
A: Takeovers are fundamentally useful, but legislation concerning them should 
be reformed. 
</P>
<P>
It is undesirable that they should be financed by means of payment created out 
of nothing by the banking system, or by the issuing of junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
In principle, junk bonds are basically useful, but they are used excessively 
and irrationally, notably in takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do you think that the American system could be changed to correct its 
flaws? 
</P>
<P>
A: The American system could be reformed in the following ways: 
</P>
<P>
* Making it impossible to create means of payment ex nihilo by the credit 
mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
* Considerably increasing margin requirements on buying and selling. 
</P>
<P>
* Eliminating the continuous trading market and replacing it everywhere with a 
single daily trading price for each stock in each market. 
</P>
<P>
* Ending automatic, computerized buying and selling. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How is the French system, for example, different from the American one? What 
is the impact of Wall Street on the French system? Is it growing or lessening? 
</P>
<P>
A: The European criticisms of the American financial system could be addressed 
just as valuably to the European systems. 
</P>
<P>
The French system suffers from the same defects. They are simply less 
pronounced. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the French imitate the worst aspects of the American market, as 
in, for example, the continuous trading market. 
</P>
<P>
The impact is increasing. The effects are very bad: basically, the creation of 
a potentially permanent instability and the greater and greater disassociation 
of the financial system from the real economy.

FBI PROBING REPORT OF PAYMENT SCHEME AT S&amp;L 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FBI agents are questioning former officers and employees of Irvine-based 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan to determine if top executives were paid excessively 
high salaries with the understanding they would contribute some of that money 
to political candidates, sources familiar with the federal investigation said. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiries involve a larger number and broader group of people than 
previously reported, the sources said. It was reported earlier this week that 
the FBI has quizzed state and federal regulators about their knowledge of any 
scheme to funnel corporate assets to political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Creditors who lost millions of dollars in the April collapse of Lincoln and 
bankruptcy of its parent firm, American Continental Corp. in Phoenix, have 
claimed in lawsuits that political donations helped American Continental 
Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr. wield influence over regulators and keep the 
S&amp;L alive about two years beyond the point it should have been seized. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question there's an extensive investigation going on," said Bradley 
J. Boland, an American Continental spokesman. "At least 30 people we know of 
have been interviewed by the FBI. But they all told us that they said their 
contributions were purely voluntary and that they were not reimbursed at all." 
</P>
<P>
Campaign contributions are expected to be one of the topics at a hearing today 
before the House Banking Committee, which is investigating what could become 
the costliest failure in thrift history. Taxpayers are likely to pay $1.1 
billion to $2 billion to repair the damage. 
</P>
<P>
An American Continental spokesman vehemently denied that executives were paid 
high salaries for the purpose of financing political contributions and 
circumventing campaign laws that limit contributions to $1,000 per person. 
</P>
<P>
He also denied there was pressure on any employee to contribute money to 
politicians, though Keating encouraged them to support the candidates of their 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
Keating and about 75 family members, employees and business associates 
contributed more than $700,000 in campaign contributions to 37 politicians. 
More than $300,000 of that went to Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and four other 
U.S. senators, all of whom intervened with federal regulators on behalf of 
Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Cranston solicited $850,000 from Keating for three voter 
registration groups, including one headed by Cranston's son, Kim. 
</P>
<P>
One of the witnesses expected to testify today before the Banking Committee had 
been quoted in a newspaper report earlier this week as saying Lincoln laundered 
campaign funds illegally. But the witness, William J. Crawford, commissioner of 
the state Department of Savings and Loan, said he was misquoted. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford also said an FBI document referring to his conversation with a Lincoln 
executive contained substantial errors. "I don't know that there was any order 
to pay anything to anyone, and no absolute suggestion that executives had to 
make contributions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford said that if asked, he would explain to the Banking Committee what he 
knows about employee contributions to political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Employees and executives interviewed shortly after Lincoln's collapse said then 
that they were never pressured into making contributions, though they sometimes 
arrived at work to find solicitations from political or religious groups on 
their desks. 
</P>
<P>
"We can categorically deny that people were paid in order to make campaign 
contributions," the American Continental spokesman said. "They were not 
reimbursed and not forced to do it. Any campaign contributions made by 
employees was made absolutely voluntarily."

Stock Baskets OKd: The Securities and Exchange Commission approved plans by the 
New York Stock Exchange and Chicago Board Options Exchange to begin trading 
"stock baskets." The NYSE product, called the Exchange Stock Portfolio, will 
allow institutional investors, but not individuals, to trade $5-million blocks 
of stocks reflecting Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index. The Chicago 
product, also limited to institutional investors, will permit trading in 
$1.6-million baskets based on the S&amp;P 100 index and $1.73-million baskets 
based on the S&amp;P 500 index. The products were recommended in the wake of 
the October, 1987, stock market crash as a means of reducing volatility in the 
markets.

GREAT WESTERN TO MOVE HOME TO SAN FERNANDO VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Great Western Financial Corp., seeking to accommodate an expansion, will move 
its headquarters to a complex in the northwest San Fernando Valley and may sell 
its current Beverly Hills home offices, the thrift said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Great Western will move about 100 employees in 1992 from its Beverly Hills 
headquarters and other locations to a 10-story executive office building to be 
constructed at the new site in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Great Western Financial, parent of Great Western Bank, is the nation's 
second-largest thrift with about $37 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
The new headquarters could accommodate some of the 2,600 people employed at a 
nine-building service center adjacent to the new site, currently the largest 
concentration of Great Western employees. Ground-breaking is scheduled for 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
The company also plans to build five other buildings on the 20-acre site in 
Chatsworth, tentatively scheduled for completion in about 2005. 
</P>
<P>
Great Western said it retained Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. to evaluate the 
possible sale of its Beverly Hills headquarters building, which has an assessed 
value for tax purposes of about $21 million. 
</P>
<P>
But Great Western may keep the 10-story Beverly Hills building, much of which 
it leases to other tenants, Lynn Taylor, public relations director, said. 
</P>
<P>
The company has not decided what to do with the nine buildings it occupies 
adjacent to the new building site in Chatsworth. Great Western owns five of 
those buildings in partnership and leases the other four. The company could 
continue to occupy some of the buildings to accommodate expansion, according to 
Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been planned for quite some time," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
The new buildings will also give Great Western room to accommodate expansion, 
Taylor said. In July, Great Western agreed to buy 63 Florida branches of a 
Miami-based S&amp;L, CenTrust Bank, and plans to expand further in parts of 
Florida and California, according to Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of building at the site would also include an employee center 
with a cafeteria, conference and exercise facilities, as well as a parking 
garage and a child-care center. Later phases call for three six-story office 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Great Western said it had zoning approval for the project from the city of Los 
Angeles but has yet to receive building permits.

COMPUTER FILE: A PROGRAM THAT'S ON THE MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY, RICHARD O'REILLY is director of computer analysis for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Financial planning is virtually a necessity in our complex economy. Doing it 
properly is a daunting task. 
</P>
<P>
First, you have to figure out how you are spending your money and where it has 
gotten you -- the current value of your assets and liabilities. Then you have 
to figure out your major financial goals, such as buying a home, putting 
children through college or having enough money for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Next, you have to factor in predictions for how things will change over the 
years, such as inflation and the rate of return you can expect from your 
investments. After that, you can begin deciding how to get from where you are 
financially to where you want to be. 
</P>
<P>
Such a complicated undertaking can be made much easier by using a computer -- 
if you have the right software program to help you. 
</P>
<P>
Wealth Builder by Money magazine, at $250, is designed to do just what I've 
described. And its colorful design, visible if you have a color monitor, even 
makes the job attractive. 
</P>
<P>
The program, developed by Reality Technologies of Philadelphia in conjunction 
with Money magazine, is available in versions for IBM and compatible PCs and 
for the Apple Macintosh. 
</P>
<P>
There are several aspects to the program. It allows you to define your current 
financial condition and your financial goals. Then you can test various savings 
and investment strategies for reaching those goals. 
</P>
<P>
It also provides a database of performance histories of 400 mutual funds, from 
which you can select appropriate investments. For an additional $100 annual 
subscription, you can obtain quarterly updates of performance records for the 
same 400 mutual funds plus 1,000 others. An additional subscription for data on 
1,500 stocks is also planned. 
</P>
<P>
The power of Wealth Builder comes from all of the financial categories and 
formulas built into it. Basically, you merely fill in the blanks and the 
program does all the work. 
</P>
<P>
It does a particularly nice job of handling the effect of time on money. It 
converts monthly payments to annual amounts, for instance, as well as computing 
the impact of inflation on your investments between now and the time you expect 
to retire. 
</P>
<P>
Wealth Builder contains four main parts, each of which is reached from a 
pull-down menu listed at the top of the screen after you start the program. 
First is the Fact Finder, in which you fill in a series of blanks to create a 
financial profile of you and your family. 
</P>
<P>
Then you set your overall investment philosophy on a sliding scale ranging from 
conservative to risk taking. Instructions on the screen explain how to make the 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
Next comes the more tedious task of creating the balance sheet and your budget. 
The balance sheet provides for six major categories of assets and 36 
subcategories, including primary and secondary residences. The budget section 
is equally detailed with 14 main categories and 36 subcategories. There also 
are "tool boxes" to plan your insurance needs, estimate your income tax and 
plan your estate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Once all of that data is entered, you can move on to the next phase -- setting 
objectives. Three basic objectives are predefined. They are retirement, home 
purchase and educating the children. You can add up to five additional special 
objectives, which generally would be the purchase of some major asset such as a 
vacation home or a boat or a motor home. 
</P>
<P>
Defining each objective requires that you plan how you will pay for it. The 
premise of Wealth Builder, after all, is that the only way you can reach your 
objectives is by investing wisely. 
</P>
<P>
If Wealth Builder went no further than what I have described, it would have 
provided a great service by forcing its users to analyze where they are 
financially and where they want to go. 
</P>
<P>
But there is much more. The next step, and the most interesting part, is 
setting up investment strategies. 
</P>
<P>
Based on your financial profile, your objectives and your investment 
philosophy, Wealth Builder recommends a diversified mix of investment 
categories for reaching each objective. The four basic investment categories 
used are cash, equities, bonds and precious metals. 
</P>
<P>
The investment philosophy behind Wealth Builder, according to the manual, is 
"that a consistent asset allocation held for the long term offers the best 
chance for the average investor to achieve consistent returns." 
</P>
<P>
There are only two investment limitations built into Wealth Builder. One is 
that a minimum of 10% of a portfolio be held in cash and the other is that a 
maximum of 10% be kept in precious metals, which are considered to be a hedge 
against high inflation but are very risky. 
</P>
<P>
The program's recommendations can be overridden by the user at any time. For 
instance, you may not want to buy any precious metals and may not be 
comfortable unless half of your investment is in government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of any investment strategy is displayed graphically as the projected 
value of the investment year-by-year up to the time established for meeting the 
objective. The formulas used to calculate the projections are described in an 
appendix to the manual. 
</P>
<P>
Any shortfall between the desired goal and the investment strategy is instantly 
shown in this "reality timeline" depiction. You can change the investment mix 
and run the graph again and again until you find the right combination. 
</P>
<P>
You also can see a comparison between your current investments and the consumer 
price index and Money magazine's small investor index. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, when the mix of investments is right, you can go to the database of 
mutual funds, and stocks when it is available, to select those offerings that 
best meet your needs. 
</P>
<P>
The mutual fund list is broken into four types of funds -- equity, bonds, 
precious metals and other, with further subcategories. The funds can be sorted 
by nine different criteria including returns and yields for the last four 
quarters as well as five- and 10-year returns. Sales charges is another sorting 
characteristic. You must subscribe to the quarterly updates to keep the data 
current. 
</P>
<P>
To help you get started with an investment program, Wealth Builder includes 
seven hypothetical case histories covering broad categories of individuals and 
families from newlyweds to retired singles. There also is a tutorial guide 
built in to the program. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, a computer program does not guarantee wealth or even modest success 
in investing. But if you are willing to do the work it takes to organize your 
finances, it does provide a coherent picture of what you are doing.

DOW DIPS 5.94; TRADING FRENZY SETTLES DOWN

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wall Street stocks returned to calmer territory Wednesday, falling modestly in 
cautious but steady trading following the market's wild session on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials slipped 5.94 to 2,653.28. 
</P>
<P>
But advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 8 in nationwide trading 
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 784 up, 700 down and 474 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume was 155.65 million shares, down from 237.96 million on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow index plunged about 80 points in early trading Tuesday, then rebounded 
to recoup most of its loss, finishing down 3.69 points. 
</P>
<P>
Traders seemed reluctant to make big commitments in advance of the government's 
report today on the gross national product for the third quarter of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The figures are expected to show a continued slowing of economic growth, 
possibly setting the stage for lower interest rates but also raising questions 
about the outlook for corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
The brokerage firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. estimates that 
third-quarter GNP will show an increase at an annual rate of 1.5% to 2%, after 
adjustment for inflation, down from 2.5% in the April-June quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Du Pont turned in one of the best performances among the Dow industrials, 
climbing 2 1/2 to 117 3/8. The company reported higher third-quarter earnings, 
raised its dividend and disclosed plans for a 3-for-1 stock split. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stocks eased as investors cashed in some of the profits they made during 
last week's advance. The 225-share Nikkei index slipped 84.15 points to close 
at 35,442.40. Losers outnumbered winners 2 to 1 on heavy volume of 1 billion 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices closed modestly higher in London largely on technical factors, 
although the market was underpinned near the end of the session by Wall 
Street's stronger trend. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index 
finished at 2,161.9, up 12.6 points. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices ended slightly higher after pulling back from a rally that was 
stimulated by a successful auction of savings and loan bailout bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year issue rose 1/8 point, or about $1.25 per $1,000 in 
face amount. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, eased to 7.88% from 7.89% 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the midday strength in bonds to the bailout bond auction as 
well as to congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan 
Greenspan and lingering nervousness about the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
The rally faded late in the day after traders concluded that Greenspan's 
comments on inflation and interest rates were nothing new and that the bailout 
bonds would take some time to be absorbed by the market. Also, stocks finished 
mixed, giving traders no reason to shift money into bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.688%, unchanged from late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended mostly lower against major foreign currencies in thin, narrow 
trading following a mixed performance overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said the dollar got an early lift from comments from Fed 
Chairman Greenspan but edged lower mainly on technical factors. They said many 
dealers were awaiting today's release of third-quarter gross national product 
data, which should shed more light on the direction of the economy and interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before Congress, Greenspan hinted that the central bank was 
unlikely to ease credit by lowering interest rates any time soon because the 
current inflation rate of 4.4% was too high to be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Firm rates are seen as bullish for the dollar partly because they make 
dollar-denominated securities more attractive to foreigners, thereby increasing 
the need for those investors to convert their money into the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
fell to 141.55 Japanese yen from 142.10 yen Tuesday. It traded at 141.60 yen in 
London, and at 141.57 yen in New York, up from 141.50 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was weaker against the British pound. In London, the pound rose to 
$1.6090 from $1.6065 late Tuesday. Later, in New York, sterling fetched 
$1.6143, up from $1.6075. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to Tuesday's quotes, included: 
1.8350 West German marks, down from 1.8358; 1.6075 Swiss francs, down from 
1.6095; 6.2270 French francs, down from 6.2370; 1.17545 Canadian dollars, up 
from 1.17135, and 1,345.00 Italian lire, down from 1345.75. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
A steadier stock market and Japanese buying allowed copper futures prices to 
end a three-day decline. 
</P>
<P>
On other futures markets, precious metals were slightly lower, while oil 
products, most grains and livestock were generally higher. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the most active copper contract, for 
delivery in December, moved from its Tuesday low of $1.134 a pound to as high 
as $1.17 in early trading, but slipped back as the day went on. 
</P>
<P>
Copper settled 35 to 45 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in October 
at $1.15 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the Comex, the steadier stock market and stronger dollar sent gold and 
silver futures slightly lower. 
</P>
<P>
Gold settled $1 to $1.10 lower, with the contract for delivery in October at 
$369.10 an ounce; and silver was 3.4 to 3.5 cents lower, with October at $5.114 
an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Futures prices for corn and soybeans climbed higher, but wheat prices sagged on 
the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat settled 1.25 to 6.25 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in 
December at $4.055 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2.25 cents higher, with 
December at $2.4225 a bushel; oats were 0.75 cent to 1.25 cents lower, with 
December at $1.46 a bushel, and soybeans were 3 to 6 cents higher, with 
November at $5.66 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, livestock and pork prices were mostly 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
Cattle settled 0.02 cent lower to 0.03 cent higher, with the contract for 
delivery in December at 75.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.03 cent lower 
to 0.30 cent higher, with October at 83.05 cents a pound; live hogs were 0.10 
cent lower to 0.27 cent higher, with December at 47.80 cents a pound, and 
frozen pork bellies were 0.20 to 0.55 cent higher, with February at 53.32 cents 
a pound.

FED CHIEF DENIES RIFT WITH BRADY OVER DOLLAR POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM REDBURN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan on Wednesday denied that he is at 
odds with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady over Bush Administration efforts 
to keep the dollar from rising. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, appearing before a House subcommittee, described the differences 
between the Fed and the Administration over monetary policy and currency market 
intervention as "relatively minor issues of tactics. . . . To say there are 
problems in this area is just wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Greenspan's denial, Administration and Fed officials have acknowledged 
ongoing tensions, with the Treasury Department repeatedly pressing the Fed 
privately to lower interest rates to help keep the value of the dollar down. 
</P>
<P>
Fed officials, however, have challenged the Administration's emphasis on 
holding down the dollar in an effort to narrow the trade deficit, arguing that 
the Fed's primary mission should be to keep inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
By lowering interest rates, the Fed could help keep the dollar from rising by 
making U.S. securities less attractive compared to foreign investments, which 
carries the risk of adding to inflationary pressures in the American economy. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Fed revealed earlier this month that two of its top officials who 
normally have been Administration allies voted to oppose the Treasury's efforts 
to sell dollars to drive down the value of the greenback in currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
The officials -- Fed Vice Chairman Manuel H. Johnson and Fed Governor Wayne 
Angell -- both voted against raising the Fed's ceiling on sales of dollars 
abroad at a monetary policy meeting in September. 
</P>
<P>
The level of dollar sales is on the rise. Greenspan, in replying to a question 
from Rep. Peter Hoagland (D-Neb.), told the domestic monetary policy 
subcommittee of the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee that the 
combined holdings of foreign currencies by the Fed and the Treasury currently 
exceed $30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said differences over economic policy between the Administration and 
the Fed and inside each institution are normal and contribute to the 
development of generally correct policies. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed chairman was on Capitol Hill to endorse an apparently quixotic effort 
by Rep. Stephen Neal (D-N.C.), chairman of the House subcommittee, to win 
congressional approval of a resolution calling for the Fed to achieve zero 
inflation within five years. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Greenspan vigorously opposed a competing bill sponsored by 
Democratic Reps. Lee Hamilton of Indiana and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota 
designed to rein in some of the Fed's independence. 
</P>
<P>
Neither proposal is expected to make much headway in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, who repeatedly has stated his support for eliminating inflation at 
some point in the future, called Neal's proposal "laudable." He said it would 
be helpful to receive advice from Congress that "directs monetary policy toward 
a single goal -- price stability." 
</P>
<P>
But no matter how desirable it might be to achieve the goal of eliminating 
inflation, Greenspan acknowledged that any such effort would have costs. 
"During this transition period, growth could be reduced for awhile from what it 
otherwise would be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, while nearly all economists agree with Greenspan that keeping 
inflation under control is necessary to promote maximum long-term economic 
growth, it is doubtful that the resolution itself would accomplish much toward 
that goal. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal resembles similar efforts -- such as the 1985 Gramm-Rudman law 
declaring the goal of a balanced budget and the 1978 Humphrey-Hawkins Act 
calling for full employment -- that represent little more than Congress' good 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
While Neal's proposal would provide backing for the Fed's current goals, the 
competing Hamilton-Dorgan plan is aimed at opening up the central bank to 
greater public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the traditional Midwestern populist suspicion that the independent 
Fed is an ally of Wall Street and an enemy of Main Street, the Hamilton-Dorgan 
legislation would require the central bank to consult more closely with the 
White House, disclose its decisions more promptly and open itself to audits of 
its policy moves by the General Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan attacked each of its provisions as an unnecessary threat to the Fed's 
flexibility and independence. "This independence," Greenspan said, "enables the 
central bank to resist short-term inflationary biases that might be inherent in 
some aspects of the political process."

PERSONALITY: BROKER GETS HIS OWN FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Donovan, a former vice president of John Burnham &amp; Co. commercial real 
estate brokerage, has joined with former Burnham broker Craig Irving to start 
the Donovan/Irving Group, a brokerage company specializing in downtown office 
leasing. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan joined Burnham in 1978 and over the next 11 years was involved in lease 
transactions totaling more than $200 million and 1.3 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
"All the things I depended on someone else to do (at Burnham), all of a sudden 
I have to start doing," Donovan said of his business, which began operations 
last month. "It's not a lot of fun, and it can be very time-consuming, but it's 
enjoyable to know that if something goes wrong, we can change it. We didn't 
have that luxury with a large company." 
</P>
<P>
Donovan said he's not out to be the next Burnham or Koll, nor does he want to 
have brokers spread throughout the county. He prefers to stay in the downtown 
niche he carved for himself when he was at Burnham's. 
</P>
<P>
"For the time being, we will just continue to be a firm that works downtown and 
hopefully continues in high-profile projects like in the past," Donovan said. 
"I don't want to get to the point where I manage 50 brokers. You lose control 
of the service that's provided and I don't want to lose control of that." 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Boston University, Donovan has lived in San Diego since 1977. 
Before joining Burnham's, he was an energy management consultant for Honeywell. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan lives in Coronado with his wife and two daughters.

TRENDS: EXTRATERRESTRIAL BEINGS HAVE RECAPTURED THE PUBLIC IMAGINATION -- AND 
NOT JUST IN THE UNITED STATES.

E.T., phone your agent. 
</P>
<P>
 You're big, baby. You're everywhere. Books, movies, TV. Tass! 
</P>
<P>
 Russia! You know you've made the big time when you can get the Iron Curtain to 
go up on your act. Hey, it's getting so people are expecting to run into you or 
one of your pals every time they step out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 You're saturating the market, baby! Keep this up and you'll be bigger than the 
Smurfs! Only thing keeping us from putting you on Burger King glasses is we 
can't agree on what you look like. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. Take your pick: short with big heads, tall and skinny with little 
heads, gray skin, tan skin, big eyes, little eyes, creepy, cuddly, nasty, nice. 
</P>
<P>
It's getting tough to peg an extraterrestrial these days. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody seems to be trying, though. 
</P>
<P>
From the Hollywood sound stage to the Soviet Union, extraterrestrial beings are 
showing up on the A-list. 
</P>
<P>
They star in films, populate television series, zip around in the night sky, 
and allegedly abduct people and return them shaken and dazzled. 
</P>
<P>
And in the Soviet city of Voronezh, they even reportedly take strolls in the 
park and make the evening news. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it's all a cyclical fad, a coincidence or the real thing, Outer Space 
is in. 
</P>
<P>
"I've noticed that the volume of calls I've received has increased 
substantially in the past six months," said Whitley Strieber, a New York author 
who claimed in his 1987 book "Communion" to have been abducted by "visitors." 
</P>
<P>
"People are having more sightings, apparently," he said. "There's always the 
possibility that these stories can be true. Certainly they represent 
perceptions of an unusual nature, and we don't yet know the origins of those 
perceptions." 
</P>
<P>
Even the Soviet news agency Tass was willing to report a recent landing. The 
origin of one prominent sighting, it said, was a park about 300 miles southeast 
of Moscow. There, in the city of Voronezh, a handful of towering, tiny-headed 
creatures emerged from their craft and went for a walk, terrifying several 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
The landing, disclosed early this month, was confirmed by "scientists," said 
Tass, which reported that a large shining ball or disc was seen hovering over 
the park by residents. It landed. They saw up to three creatures similar to 
humans emerge, accompanied by a small robot, said the report. 
</P>
<P>
The aliens, said to be from nine to 12 feet tall, soon re-entered the craft, 
leaving onlookers "overwhelmed with a fear that lasted for several days." 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Lebedev, the Tass reporter who covered the story, said later that he 
had not actually seen the UFO and had based his story on interviews with "about 
10 youngsters aged 12 to 13." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Guessing Game 
</P>
<P>
The Tass report, as well as similar stories in the newspaper Soviet Culture, 
apparently have triggered widespread interest across the Soviet Union. In the 
glasnost era, such nationwide reports are something new. 
</P>
<P>
But back in America -- in the land of Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Superman, 
Flash Gordon, Mr. Spock, Darth Vader, E.T., Buck Rogers and the Blob -- alien 
mania, never far out of fashion, may be hitting one of its periodic apogees. 
</P>
<P>
And once again the guessing game is: What do they look like? 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Johnson thinks they have no hair, larger-than-human heads, no external 
ears, two hearts and reproductive functions that oblige two males to impregnate 
one female. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, creator and executive producer of 20th Century Fox Television's show 
"Alien Nation," also sees them as benign visitors who work at peacefully 
coexisting with Earthlings. 
</P>
<P>
"You see them walking around on the street and it's pretty clear they don't 
come from here," Johnson said. "But in terms of their hearts and souls, they're 
a lot like us. To a limited extent, it's a science-fiction show. What I really 
wanted to do is to show what it's like to be the latest people off the boat -- 
or the spacecraft as the case may be. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are always fascinated by the possibilities that face us when we 
look into the night sky," he added. "Whenever you have someone come here who is 
different from you, you have a lot of opportunity for questioning." 
</P>
<P>
Conflict is also part of the scene, at least across town at Paramount, where 
the television series "War of the Worlds" is being produced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Bad Guys' 
</P>
<P>
Unlike "Alien Nation," "War of the Worlds" is just that, a battle between 
Earthlings and space creatures. And the characters, while advanced 
technologically and biologically, can adopt human appearances, though sinister. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Strangis, the creator of the series and last season's executive producer, 
said he hopes real aliens aren't like his creations. 
</P>
<P>
"For the purposes of drama in TV series, there are certain constraints," he 
said. "You have to have good guys and bad guys, and in this case the aliens are 
the bad guys. My personal feelings are that any intelligent life possessing the 
means and interest to pay us a visit would have much more in mind than to do 
Earth inhabitants any harm." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, much of the current interest in matters other-worldly may 
have its basis here on terra firma. 
</P>
<P>
"In a funny sort of way, it may be a reaction to some of the earthbound 
problems that we have," Strangis said. "Call it alien salvation. They may be 
seen as coming with solutions to our social, economic and spiritual problems. 
Where's the help coming from, since we don't seem to be able to do it 
ourselves? It's the Superman phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wish they'd land in L.A. sometime so I could see them." 
</P>
<P>
He just hasn't been in the right place at the right time, said Tim Beckley, 
editor of UFO Universe magazine, a periodical that reports on sightings, 
abductions and other UFO phenomena. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been many sightings in Los Angeles and New York," Beckley said. 
"Actually, there's a constant kind of underground network that goes on between 
people in various parts of the world who exchange information and 
correspondence and stories about abductions and so forth. It's been going on 
since the early 1950s and it doesn't necessarily coincide with media attention 
on the subject. There isn't any particular part of the world that hasn't had 
UFO sightings." 
</P>
<P>
A sighting in the Soviet Union, he claimed, is not unusual. "The Russians have 
published articles and magazine stories about other sightings before this." 
</P>
<P>
But the appearance of the Voronezh aliens is: "Their looks are unusual in that 
most of the beings are usually seen as relatively human-like. They might be 
able to pass for us, or they may be smaller, from 3 1/2 to 4 feet tall with 
gray skin or very large foreheads. But these tall beings are rarer. They've 
been seen three or four times in South America. They're certainly not the most 
frequent visitors we've had." 
</P>
<P>
But there appears to be uniformity in the purpose of the aliens' visits, 
Beckley said, adding, "If they have one particular message, it seems to be that 
we are in danger of destroying ourselves. Many of those who have seen the 
aliens have seen them as kind of space brothers, godlike, majestic beings come 
to save humankind from annihilation. Then, there are other people who say they 
don't see them as having any particular leaning." 
</P>
<P>
Beckley told of a Soviet pilot who reportedly was forced to parachute from her 
plane and revealed later -- after finding herself safe on Earth after blacking 
out for a time -- that she had been taken aboard a UFO and warned about the 
dangers of nuclear proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think all these people are hallucinating," said Beckley. "They're not 
making up the majority of these stories. In 75%-80% of the cases, they're 
actually reporting what happened to them in a pretty sincere manner." 
</P>
<P>
Beckley, who said he has sighted UFOs in the sky on three occasions, thinks we 
are closer to alien visitors than we may imagine. 
</P>
<P>
"One theory going around that I subscribe to," he said, "is that they look so 
remarkably human because they're related to us. They may have come here and 
seeded Earth millions of years ago and now they're coming back for a look-see. 
They may be curious to see how their children have grown up." 
</P>
<P>
It is a view decidedly not shared by members of the traditional scientific 
community, nor by the American military. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena said all offices at the 
lab routinely refuse comment on UFO stories. 
</P>
<P>
And at the Pentagon, Capt. Sigmund Adams, an Air Force public affairs officer, 
said the agency's official study of UFO phenomena -- "Project Blue Book" -- 
ended in 1969. It investigated 12,500 sightings in the United States, and, said 
Adams, "about 95% were explainable as meteors, satellites, aircraft, 
lightning." The other 5% showed "no indication of technology beyond our 
scientific knowledge or indication of extraterrestrials," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the end of Project Blue Book, the Air Force has not kept records of 
reported sightings and such calls have been infrequent, said Adams. 
</P>
<P>
Still, tales continue to appear that fire the popular imagination. One of the 
most widely known -- and commercially successful -- of these was chronicled by 
author Strieber in "Communion" (he has since published a second book about his 
encounter and its aftermath, titled "Transformation"). 
</P>
<P>
In "Communion," Strieber claims to have been abducted on the day after 
Christmas, 1985, from his secluded cabin in Upstate New York. He called his 
captors "visitors," and did not specify where they came from. Throughout much 
of the abduction, he wrote, he was in a kind of dreamlike state. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled being aware of short beings, perhaps 3 1/2 feet tall, as well as 
others, dressed in gray-tan body suits with faces that featured two eye holes 
and a round mouth hole. 
</P>
<P>
He writes that he was taken to a "messy round room" filled with tiny beings 
that moved quickly around him. One of them, he wrote, smelled like cardboard, 
with a "distinctly organic sourness" and "a subtle overtone that seemed a 
little like cinnamon." 
</P>
<P>
Besides stocky beings, dressed in blue cover-all type suits, Strieber 
remembered others, one type being "about five feet tall, very slender and 
delicate, with extremely prominent and mesmerizing black slanted eyes . . . and 
almost vestigial mouth and nose." Others had round eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"Communion" became a best-seller and Strieber has become a contact for many 
people who say they have encountered aliens. But he insists the beings who 
abducted him may not necessarily have come from space. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote about an unknown experience that was not understood," he said in a 
telephone interview. "All I can say is that there seems to be a strange set of 
perceptions people can have, the source of which is unknown. One hypothesis is 
that these things should not be dismissed out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
And he doesn't. But, he acknowledged, sightings and alien encounters do 
increase after a newspaper report like the recent one from Tass. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A 'Major Unknown' 
</P>
<P>
"When sightings are prominently reported in a paper, that generates reports of 
other sightings," he said. "People who have seen something and have not wished 
to report it are encouraged. There's a fear of ridicule; 99% of the sighting 
cases never appear in the press. For instance, there have been major sightings 
over New York City recently that were not reported in the press. The reports 
have come from so many different people, there must be something extraordinary 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
While Strieber admitted that "the average person can easily be misled by the 
sky -- the night sky is full of illusions," he said that his experience has 
convinced him that "there is a very major unknown waiting to be understood. We 
have to do one of three things: revise our understanding of the way our 
perceptive systems relate to the world around us, revise the understanding of 
our own minds, or recognize that there are nonhuman intelligences moving about. 
</P>
<P>
"It's happening on such a large scale now that it's almost inevitable that we 
are going to find the answer sooner or later."

A HARD SELL TO RESCUE PLANET EARTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early in November, East Coast fund-raiser Roger Craver will dispatch a direct 
mailing to 100,000 environmentalists nationwide, a glossy packet inviting them 
to become co-sponsors of Earth Day 1990 by committing time and money to the 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
Although it may appear to be a routine solicitation, the packet is more: It 
represents a media-savvy, marketing campaign that is a first for the 
environmental movement, traditionally more reflective of Woodstock than Madison 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy is being planned as carefully as a presidential campaign, says 
Craver, whose 20 years of success with Craver, Mathews, Smith &amp; Co. has 
earned him the title of "fund-raising czar." And he's only one of a handful of 
top consultants, many of them veterans of Earth Day I, working on Earth Day's 
20th anniversary plans for minimal fees because they believe in the magnitude 
of the environmental crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Proclaims Los Angeles public relations consultant Josh Baran: "We're trying to 
organize this like the movie 'Batman' so that when Earth Day arrives on April 
22, everybody will know about it. We believe the environmental situation is so 
important that we really want to turn it around. Earth Day can be the booster 
rocket for the next 10 years in making people more receptive in terms of 
changing behavior." 
</P>
<P>
The Earth Day 1990 campaign, now being geared up, includes focus groups, 
questionnaires, videos, a national broadcast and print advertising campaign, 
logos, prototype T-shirts -- all the essentials for the marketing of a 
commercial product or a political candidate. 
</P>
<P>
All this and more is being coordinated out of official Earth Day 1990 
headquarters, a donated storefront in downtown Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got the best people in the country," says Earth Day executive director 
Chris Desser, "and they are working for significantly reduced rates. . . . I 
called them up and said 'Earth Day and I need your help.' They said 'We will do 
it for cheap and we won't hourly-rate you to death.' They've been fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
She dismisses suggestions that sophisticated marketing strategies will produce 
nothing more than a media event. "This issue is so important," says Desser, 
"that if we don't do something about it, nothing else will matter." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Earth Day goal, in the words of chairman Denis Hayes, is nothing 
less than a full-scale revamping of society's behavior. "We want to change the 
world," says Hayes who, as a law student, organized the first Earth Day in 
1970. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, now on leave from a San Francisco law firm, spoke recently by phone from 
London, in the midst of a two-week trip enlisting environmentalists and other 
activists on a sweep of six European countries: "We're getting a huge amount of 
enthusiasm. 'These are global issues and we're trying to create a situation in 
which there is mass public involvement. . . . If it works, we'll have 50 
(million) to 100 million people around the world participating." 
</P>
<P>
This advance drum-beating is a far cry from the original Earth Day in 1970. 
Coordinated by Hayes and a groundswell of student activists essentially to 
protest air pollution, that event rallied more than 20 million people 
nationwide and surprised almost everybody with its scope. 
</P>
<P>
"It came like a shot out of the dark," recalls Craver. "Citizen action in those 
days had been focused on the Vietnam War. People had to go look up the word 
ecology." 
</P>
<P>
Says Desser: "The challenge in 1970 was educating people that the environment 
was an issue. The first Earth Day really did give birth to the environmental 
movement. The challenge now is: What are we going to do about it? How can I 
change my behavior? How can I get corporations, the government, to change their 
behavior?" 
</P>
<P>
While Hayes is mobilizing the world, Desser, a lawyer and seasoned political 
organizer, is concentrating on America. Using phones, faxes and computer 
networks, she oversees a paid staff of 18 and several hundred volunteers: 
"We've raised close to $1 million from foundations and individuals and will be 
seeking $2 million more from individuals and corporations." 
</P>
<P>
For an operation of its scope, $3 million is modest, Earth Day sponsors say, 
noting that Hollywood routinely spends $5 million to $6 million to market a 
humdrum movie. 
</P>
<P>
And this is not a humdrum issue. If Earth Day succeeds, sponsors say, the April 
22 outpouring of rallies, official proclamations, nature walks, pickets, 
tree-plantings, trash-ins and teach-ins, will bequeath a permanent change in 
collective behavior. 
</P>
<P>
It will sensitize consumers to the importance of buying an energy-efficient 
refrigerator, a fuel-efficient car, of protesting excessive plastic packaging, 
of putting pressure on politicians and corporations to respond to environmental 
needs. "We are trying to generate as much interest as we can for people to 
start doing things immediately -- at home, at work and at school," says Diana 
Aldridge, Earth Day communications director. 
</P>
<P>
As a catalyst, a five-point outreach program outlines specific heal-the-earth 
activities for everybody from kindergarten students to corporate executives. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Pacy Markman, who created the award-winning Miller Lite Beer 
account ("Everything you've wanted in a beer and less") among others, is 
already at work on the television, print and radio advertising campaign. He's 
working with designer Scott Mednick, whose Mednick Associates' accounts include 
CBS' national advertising and who designed the green and white Earth Day logo 
already appearing on posters and flyers. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign line will be "Earth Day 1990: Who Says You Can't Change the 
World?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's both empowering and honest," Markman says. "And it is optimistic. Maybe 
you can't do anything about the Brazilian rain forests, but if you can get City 
Hall to mandate curbside recycling. You can make a difference somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
He is designing ads for television commercials, for trailers in movie theaters, 
for magazines and newspapers. "I've never done anything this important," he 
declares. "I've done campaigns for candidates and won, and for initiatives and 
won, but never anything that involved the whole world." 
</P>
<P>
Markman's passion for Earth Day as an event of singular significance is shared 
by other participating consultants, including: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Walter McGuire, whose San Francisco public affairs firm has coordinated 
such events as the 1984 Olympic torch run across the United States and the 1987 
trip of Pope John Paul II to Los Angeles. He is director of field operations, 
creating a grass-roots structure aimed at setting thousands of programs into 
motion. "The enthusiasm out there is terrific," he reports. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cliff Staton, of Staton Hughes' political strategy and communications firm 
in San Francisco, is getting the 17-million-member labor movement involved in 
Earth Day, recruiting union presidents and getting the message out to the 4,000 
union publications in the country. He thinks the time is right: "I made a round 
of calls last week and have nothing but positive responses." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Washington pollster Peter D. Hart, whose clients include NBC, the Wall 
Street Journal and "the Democratic side of the aisle," says that his firm, Hart 
Research Associates, has conducted focus groups, indicating, "There is a 
wellspring of support for doing something about the environment. People care, 
and are willing to commit time, money and change their style of life. I think 
it is the single strongest issue of our time." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Washington's Podesta Associates, a consulting firm specializing in public 
interest organizations, has been working since last March on reaching public 
officials. Says Tony Podesta: "I see it as a launch of environmental activism 
for the last decade of this century. It's the beginning of something. I think 
you're likely to see a spurt of concern by politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Washington's Diane MacEachern, president of Vanguard Communications, is 
concentrating on "generating visibility" (press conferences, interviews and 
Earth Day mentions in magazines and newspapers). That's a must, she says, in 
today's media-driven society, where, "you have to use certain tools to reach 
the maximum audience. That reality didn't exist five years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Although Earth Day is endorsed by most of the country's environmental groups, 
spokesmen in the alternative environmental community are reserving judgment on 
the notion that Earth Day should be marketed like some corporate product. Mark 
Williams, a local coordinator with Earth First, an activist environmental 
group, says: "The mainstream groups are happy with a slick approach -- that's 
all great because it will generate a lot of publicity. But there's a danger of 
co-option. . . . We don't want to just put on a big happy face." 
</P>
<P>
That sentiment is shared throughout the environmental world, where everybody 
thinks the message is too important to be understated. Says Baran: "We are not 
selling a product, we are just turning up the volume on something that is 
important to us all. If you're in a crisis, you have to yell."

Joe Rutkowski's son, Keith, was so frightened by the ghouls and goblins 
arriving at his family's house last Halloween that he refused to go near the 
door. 
</P>
<P>
"He was scared to death of all the kids coming to the door in a costume," 
Rutkowski of Sharon, Mass., said of his then 3 1/2-year-old boy. "He ran. We 
couldn't get him near the door." 
</P>
<P>
Christine Burns' daughter, Elyse, who was eight months last Halloween, was 
afraid of visitors at the door and clung to her mother in alarm when playmates 
crowded into her living room dressed as ghosts, witches and cartoon characters. 
</P>
<P>
"She wanted to be held and reassured. She would just get upset and really 
clingy," said Burns of Wellesley, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
While some children plan their Halloween costume for weeks and work themselves 
into an excited frenzy Oct. 31, others become terrified by the distorting 
disguises and back away from participating. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is common among 2- and 3-year-old toddlers, said Joseph Cunningham, 
a developmental and clinical psychologist at Brandeis University in Waltham, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to do with their developing capacity to understand how people can 
change and remain the same in other respects," Cunningham said. "Alterations in 
the appearance of a person can be frightening because they're still a little 
shaky in their ability to understand how that can happen." 
</P>
<P>
Older children can better distinguish between fantasy and reality. They delight 
in the knowledge they can control a frightening situation simply by removing 
the mask, Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Eichenlaub, a head teacher at Brandeis' Lemberg Children's Center, said 
staffers there soothed fears about a visiting clown's exaggerated facial 
features and "tremendously large red shoes" by having the clown don his makeup 
in front of the children. 
</P>
<P>
Rutkowski calmed his son's fears by having costumed children at the door remove 
their masks -- a response Cunningham recommends. 
</P>
<P>
"I suggest that the parent talk with the child about how they're feeling, maybe 
fill in some of the gaps with something like, 'Boy, that's scary to see Michael 
look like Dracula. He never looked like that before, did he? But you know he 
can take that off and he's still Michael. See?' " 
</P>
<P>
Some children dress up, head out the door and are about to start trick or 
treating when "bingo -- they don't want anything to do with it," Cunningham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is to verbalize what you've seen the child express. 
That they're not sure they want to do this anymore. It's a little scary and 
it's OK if they decide they don't want to do this," he said. "Sometimes that's 
all they need to regather their strength and plunge ahead." 
</P>
<P>
What parents shouldn't do, he said, is dismiss the child's fear with a "Come 
on, all the other kids are doing it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's likely to make them more apprehensive . . . it doesn't give them an 
opportunity to understand what it is they're feeling."

PSYCHIATRIST ANALYZES MURDEROUS IMPULSES

Richard Chase was called the Vampire of Sacramento. Seized by a delusion that 
he had to consume human blood, he killed six people, including a 22-month-old 
baby whose organs he hacked open before drinking the blood. Convicted of six 
counts of first-degree murder, he died of a drug overdose in 1979 while serving 
a life term in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Fumiko Kimura was a housewife and mother of two young children. When she 
learned that her husband was having an affair, she waded into the ocean in 
Santa Monica on a chilly January day with her children and held their heads 
under the waves until they died, then tried to drown herself. She ultimately 
pleaded guilty to a charge of voluntary manslaughter and was placed on 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris met at the California Men's Colony in San Luis 
Obispo. Bittaker was there for robbery and Norris for rape. Within a year of 
their release in November, 1978, they had raped and killed five teen-age girls 
and recorded their screams on tape. Recaptured, Norris is now serving a life 
sentence, and Bittaker is on Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ronald Markman knows them all. He has sat in a room, alone, with each of 
them, sifting the method from their madness, thereby obtaining evidence to help 
the court determine how responsible each killer was for what he or she did. 
</P>
<P>
Markman is Southern California's leading forensic psychiatrist, the expert to 
whom judges turn repeatedly to provide impartial assessments of the mental 
condition of people accused of crimes. He has testified in more than 20,000 
cases, including such celebrated ones as the Hillside Strangler murders and the 
slaying of musician Marvin Gaye. 
</P>
<P>
The public fascination with these cases prompted Markman to write about them, 
and about the murderers and the murdered, to "satiate the morbid curiosity," 
Markman said in a recent interview at his Westchester office. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to know more. There is something inside them (the murderers) that is 
also inside us, and we are attracted to them so that we can find out what that 
something is," writes Markman in his recently published book, "Alone With the 
Devil" (Doubleday). 
</P>
<P>
The book, for which Dominick Basco was co-author, is an anthology of the 
"high-visibility" homicide cases that have marked Markman's career as a 
forensic psychiatrist, a career that began in the late '60s, when Markman was 
teaching in the department of psychiatry at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, Department 95, the mental health court of Los Angeles County, had 
its offices in the psychiatric ward at County-USC. When one of the four 
psychiatrists who regularly consulted for Department 95 died of a heart attack, 
Markman was offered his position. Thus began a career that would bring 
encounters with some of the most dreaded names in California criminal history. 
</P>
<P>
Although each case was unique in its complexities, Markman points out the 
common thread: the unpredictability of the urge to kill. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone can commit homicide," he says, "the person who sits across from you at 
lunch, your partner in business, your partner in bed. The only real difference 
between most of the killers in the book and most of its readers is that most of 
the readers have not killed another human being. We are all capable of killing 
if we feel our existence is profoundly and imminently threatened." 
</P>
<P>
This idea first struck him when he was informed that the person he had bought 
his house from was charged with the murder of his partner. "That showed me we 
are all one step away from being the murderer." 
</P>
<P>
And the idea was reinforced when the father of his son's best friend was killed 
by a robber. "I realized that we are one step away from being an indiscriminate 
victim." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Markman says, the urges in all of us that make us capable of 
killing are offset in normal human beings by the civilizing powers of 
restraint. In some people, however, this restraint is weakened by inherent or 
environmental influences that retard proper psychological growth. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the widely publicized "wilding" incident in New York's Central Park, in 
which a group of teen-agers assaulted and raped a woman who was jogging, 
Markman explains: "These were youngsters without a superego, which is the 
internal policeman of the conscience. They couldn't be talked to in terms of 
right and wrong. They functioned simply on the basis of pleasure. I have run 
into youngsters who have severely injured their playmates, their relatives, 
their peers. But they have no remorse, because they don't have the capacity for 
remorse." 
</P>
<P>
It is the interpretation of this capacity of individuals to appreciate the 
nature of their actions that has yanked psychiatrists from their consultation 
rooms to the courts, Markman says. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that many critics dispute the value of psychiatric testimony, 
Markman insists, "To make inferences from the present state and go backwards is 
not witchcraft, sorcery or poppycock." 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, he outlined the way he works: 
</P>
<P>
"When I have to determine the degree of criminal responsibility, I have to do a 
lot of professional gymnastics. If a person is charged with a robbery committed 
seven months ago and he pleads not guilty by insanity, I first examine his 
present condition. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I ask myself, 'If he committed the crime right at this moment, would he 
be sane?' I take this condition and go backwards and say, 'Is it not likely 
that this condition existed then? Or is it possible that some intervening 
variable, like medication, affected his behavior?' I review this behavior and 
draw the conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
It is a rational, logical process, Markman says, and in concept a simple one. 
But as psychiatry has assumed a growing role in the legal process in the second 
half of the 20th Century, it has brought complications. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Kotler, USC professor of media law and an attorney for the California 
First Amendment Coalition, notes that psychiatric testimony is "based on a 
diagnosis rather than on facts." This, Kotler says, confuses things for the 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
He complains that judges and attorneys do not trust the ability of the jurors 
to interpret the complex issues involved in a case. Hence, "hired guns," such 
as forensic psychiatrists, are brought in. 
</P>
<P>
Markman agrees. "Once the psychiatrist stepped in, terms that were once 
clear-cut became fuzzy." 
</P>
<P>
For example, the interpretation of the words, "deliberation," and 
"premeditation," -- the two most important criteria for establishing 
first-degree murder -- had to be refined once psychiatrists could examine a 
defendant and offer an opinion as to whether he or she was capable of 
deliberating or premeditating, Markman says. 
</P>
<P>
The confusion was compounded when the legal system responded by introducing 
qualifiers, such as "meaningful and mature deliberation" in statutes and 
judicial opinions, Markman adds. 
</P>
<P>
As he traces the history of each case in his book, Markman analyzes the 
limitations of the legal system and their effect on the final verdict. He is 
severely critical of the "discriminatory attitude," of the courts, at one point 
describing them as "immoral and unjust because they are concerned more with 
technicalities than the truth." 
</P>
<P>
To Markman, there is no more classic an example of a murderer who almost got 
off on a technicality than Barry Braeseke, a 20-year-old man from Oakland who 
killed his parents and his grandfather in 1976. He confessed to the detectives 
after telling them that everything he said was "off the record." Later, he 
confessed to the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
At Braeseke's trial, his attorney argued that his client's confessions were 
invalid because they had been obtained without making him aware of his right to 
remain silent and his right to an attorney. But the court upheld his second 
confession, and he was convicted of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
The California Supreme Court and later the U. S. Supreme Court reversed the 
decision on the grounds that the confession was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, when Braeseke confessed to the murders on the CBS program "60 
Minutes," the videotape was used as testimony and Braeseke was sentenced to 
life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Another case that disturbed Markman -- he calls it the most "nagging and 
chilling case I have ever handled" -- was that of Lawrence Bittaker. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Markman's testimony that he was a "significant danger to society," 
Bittaker was released on parole. A year later, Bittaker was charged with the 
rape and murder of five teen-age girls. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard the tapes of the young girls in agony while they were being 
brutalized, I found it difficult to understand the revolving door form of 
justice which arrests, releases, rearrests and releases a criminal. I don't 
think Bittaker should be released. Not that I am a redneck. But I think that he 
has lost the license to live in the society for what he has done." 
</P>
<P>
Such baffling contradictions of the legal system, and the disappointing feeling 
that "I wasn't doing the fullest justice to my patients," prompted Markman to 
go to law school after a decade of practice as a forensic psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
Though Markman emphasizes that law school didn't alter his methods of 
psychiatric examination, "It changed my perspective as a witness, because I 
became aware of questions that shouldn't be asked. I was more in touch with the 
legal machinations." 
</P>
<P>
Further, it gave him an insight into the role of the attorney in the legal 
system: "The lawyer, unlike any other profession, is taught solely to persuade. 
He is not interested in the facts. If you can persuade the jury to disregard 
the facts, you don't have to worry about the facts." 
</P>
<P>
Though he now has a law degree and has joined the American Bar Assn., Markman 
says he does not intend to appear in court as an attorney. "It would color my 
impartiality." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, however, Markman has missed his calling: Over the years, he has 
successfully fought 15 traffic violations. "I won them all on technicalities. I 
wasn't being devious. The cops had signed it in the wrong place or they had 
forgotten to give the date." 
</P>
<P>
But he adds a sobering thought: "If I can get technical acquittals in traffic 
violation cases, imagine the technicalities involved in a criminal case." 
</P>
<P>
Markman declines cases that he finds difficult to approach impartially. When he 
was called to examine Robert F. Kennedy's assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, a Jordanian 
residing in the United States, Markman refused. 
</P>
<P>
"Sirhan had killed Kennedy for his warm feelings toward Israel, and I had come 
from Israel," Markman said. 
</P>
<P>
Born in what was then called Palestine, Markman and his family came to the 
United States in 1939, crossing the Atlantic on the last prewar voyage of the 
Queen Mary. The family lived for brief periods in New York, the Canadian city 
of Windsor and Chicago before settling in Los Angeles in 1945. After high 
school, he attended UCLA as an undergraduate and as a medical student. 
</P>
<P>
Although Markman admits that his job -- with its rapid-fire questions and the 
interaction with people who have been involved in heinous crimes -- can be 
draining and stressful, the psychiatrist says he is able to leave it behind 
when he leaves work. "I don't mix business with pleasure," he says. 
</P>
<P>
This is echoed by Nitza, his wife of 27 years, a teacher of Jewish studies at a 
private school. They first met at George Washington University, where Nitza was 
a student, fresh from Israel, and Markman was working as a psychiatrist in the 
Army. 
</P>
<P>
"He has never brought his work home," Nitza Markman says. "It's our upbringing 
that stresses the importance of the family. He's always there when anyone from 
the family needs him."

EXPERIMENTAL EXHIBIT SHOWS NEIGHBORHOOD'S RICH ETHNIC DIVERSITY 
</P>

A quiet revolution is occurring on the walls of a municipal art center in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Hanging near the flashy yellows and oranges of a youthful black painter are the 
bright pinks and blues of a Mexican mother's crocheting. The sweeping pastels 
of a young Latino spray can artist contrast with the gentle hues of a 
middle-aged Cambodian silk weaver. And the traditional lines of American Indian 
pottery offer stark alternatives to the high-tech electric blinking of an Anglo 
American's modern abstract sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
Yet somehow it all comes together at the Homeland Neighborhood Cultural Center. 
Located near Anaheim Street and Gaviota Avenue, this is a different sort of 
gallery constituting an unusual city experiment. Its mission: to celebrate the 
area's dramatic ethnic diversity by encouraging artistic expression in various 
cultural traditions and providing a single roof under which to exhibit it. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is the international city, then this is the corridor of the world," 
said Dixie Swift, the city's cultural program supervisor and Homeland's 
director. "What we have in common is that we all make art." 
</P>
<P>
Said Earl Birch Smith, a local artist and cultural chairman for Long Beach Area 
Citizens Involved, which has been supportive of the project: "This serves as a 
model. We must have a temple of understanding; if people attend, I believe it 
will establish communication and lead to more acceptance." 
</P>
<P>
Opened late last month, the center grew out of a 1987 cultural needs assessment 
of the city's central "Anaheim corridor" -- a 2 1/2-mile stretch of Anaheim 
Street extending from Long Beach Boulevard to Redondo Avenue. Once dominated by 
Jews and later by blacks, the area in recent years has undergone a dramatic 
demographic shift, becoming Long Beach's most ethnically diverse neighborhood 
with huge clusters of blacks, Latinos, Southeast Asians, Pacific Islanders and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
To create a center reflective of that diversity, the city allocated $35,000, 
the estimated cost of running Homeland for a year. By next June, Swift said, 
the center will be required to pay back the money and to have established a 
firm financial footing of its own. She hopes to attract donations from 
corporations, foundations and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Located in an 1,800-square-foot former artist's studio next to a Southeast 
Asian medical center and a Cambodian tailor's shop, the Homeland center is 
governed by a 25-member advisory council consisting of neighborhood artists 
ranging from a Laotian dancer to a black reggae musician. 
</P>
<P>
The center's current exhibit -- featuring visual arts by people who have lived, 
worked, attended school or "played" in the Anaheim corridor -- will be up until 
mid-November. Future plans, Swift said, call for a multimedia poetry and art 
exhibit in which participants will be invited to paint and draw on the walls, 
and an exhibit depicting the high holidays of various ethnic groups represented 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the regular exhibits, she said, the center offers evening 
workshops in painting and poetry, and hopes eventually to add workshops in 
graphic arts and video. 
</P>
<P>
"The creative process is a healing process," Swift said, alluding to the racial 
tensions that have sometimes flared in the area. Most of the artists seem to 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
"I see a lot of positive things coming out of this," said Alex Castro, 21, an 
accomplished aerosol spray can muralist who until a year ago was still honing 
his skills as an illegal graffiti artist. "This will encourage (young people) 
to do something positive with their work." 
</P>
<P>
Said Maichew Chao, a local needleworker who grew up in a highland Laotian tribe 
called Iu-mien: "It means a lot to me just to let people know who we are and 
what kind of work we've done. No matter where we live, we still want to keep 
our traditions."

SANTA MONICA CONSERVANCY ADDS WRINKLE TO LANDFILL NEGOTIATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
MOUNTAINS: L.A. COUNTY AND A WASTE DISPOSAL FIRM HAVE BEEN DUELING OVER CONTROL 
OF PROPERTY EACH WANTS TO DEVELOP AS A GARBAGE DUMP, BUT THE CONSERVANCY MAY 
HAVE TIPPED THE BALANCE WHILE PURSUING ITS OWN INTERESTS. 
</P>

<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy has boldly injected itself into 
negotiations over a proposed county landfill north of Sylmar in an effort to 
acquire three canyons in the Santa Monicas the agency wants preserved. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy has become involved by allying itself with a private firm to 
get control of land the county needs to develop the proposed Elsmere Canyon 
landfill. Control of that land would give the conservancy a bargaining chip 
that it will try to exchange for the three Santa Monica Mountain canyons -- 
Sullivan, Rustic and Mission -- which could otherwise be developed. 
</P>
<P>
The gambit changes the dynamics of land-swap negotiations among Los Angeles 
County, the city of Los Angeles and other public agencies and private interests 
concerning the proposed Elsmere Canyon landfill, which officials see as a key 
to heading off an impending trash crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The move represents a mutual aid pact between unusual allies: The conservancy, 
which is a state agency that buys parkland in and near the Santa Monica 
Mountains, and BKK Corp., a leading Southern California waste-disposal firm 
that now owns the Elsmere land at issue and wants to develop the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The pact is intended to win the three canyons for the conservancy while 
protecting BKK's interest in owning and operating the dump in lieu of the 
County Sanitation Districts. The landfill could bring the company millions -- 
or even billions -- of dollars in dumping fees over the 30- to 50-year life of 
the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
"It allows us to go along and do our environmental studies and proceed with the 
permitting (of the landfill) without the county coming in and taking the 
project," BKK President Kenneth B. Kazarian said Thursday. "We decided to 
eliminate the hammer from our heads." 
</P>
<P>
The city has pushed for the dump to be publicly owned and operated, in part to 
guarantee that city trash trucks will be able to dump there, Los Angeles Deputy 
Mayor Mike Gage said. A few private dumps, including one operated by BKK, have 
barred city trash. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles city and county officials reacted with surprise and some outrage to 
the disclosure of the secret deal that could block a proposed public landfill 
until three canyons are made parkland. 
</P>
<P>
In the strongest attack, Gage accused the conservancy's executive director, 
Joseph T. Edmiston, of "making a deal with the devil" by aligning with BKK. 
"We've been trying to protect the conservancy's interest, only to have them go 
behind our back and potentially cost the city hundreds of millions of dollars," 
Gage said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement with the conservancy may elevate BKK's bargaining power. The 
county and independent County Sanitation Districts insist that the landfill 
must be publicly owned. BKK faces possible condemnation of the land if it can't 
agree with the county and city on a sale price, and the Torrance-based waste 
disposal firm has rejected an initial offer of more than $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
But the land would essentially become condemnation-proof in the hands of the 
conservancy, because one public agency cannot condemn land held by another. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the deal, BKK will transfer to the conservancy about 500 acres 
near the intersection of the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways, 
Kazarian said. Most of the land would provide access to Elsmere from a new 
freeway interchange. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy is seeking to acquire Rustic, Sullivan and Mission canyons, 
which are located south of Mulholland Drive in the Santa Monica Mountains. It 
has long coveted these 2,300 acres, which are being held by the county and 
Sanitation Districts for possible future use as garbage dumps. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston said it was "clear that the conservancy felt that it had to take . . . 
steps to assure that Mission, Rustic and Sullivan canyons would be part of the 
mitigation package for the landfill in Elsmere Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
The county and Sanitation Districts acquired Mission, Rustic and Sullivan in 
the '50s and '60s for use as landfills. The county dumped trash in Mission 
until 1965. Conservationists, affluent homeowners and the city of Los Angeles 
have expressed intense opposition to dumping in the canyons, but the Sanitation 
Districts still have refused to sell them to the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Rustic and Sullivan, deep clefts on the eastern flank of Topanga State Park, 
are "the most pristine canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains, even though they 
are within the city of Los Angeles," Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
But the conservancy has been unable to secure a promise from city and county 
negotiators that a complicated land-swap needed to establish the Elsmere dump 
will include transfer of Mission, Sullivan and Rustic to the conservancy, 
Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed 190-million-ton landfill would be a major repository of the city's 
trash for the next several decades and is seen by city and county sanitation 
officials as a partial solution to an impending trash crisis stemming from 
dwindling landfill space. The county sanitation agency is also pursuing the 
Santa Monica Mountain canyons as one of five other potential dump sites. 
</P>
<P>
The canyons are a sore point with Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, 
who sent a scathing letter to the Sanitation Districts board last month vowing 
to oppose any land-swap agreement that eliminates Mission, Rustic and Sullivan 
as future landfill sites. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum, a Republican, has four of the 10 active landfills in the county in 
his San Gabriel Valley district. There are no landfills on the heavily 
Democratic, well-populated Westside of Los Angeles, where the three canyons are 
located. 
</P>
<P>
He may be in the minority on the board, however. Three of the five supervisors 
-- Deane Dana, Mike Antonovich and Ed Edelman -- said the canyons should not be 
used as landfills or should be used only as a last resort. They said the number 
of nearby homes made a landfill unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
Dana complained Friday that the conservancy had been deceitful. "I thought we 
had some kind of agreement to communicate and I have found out" that Edmiston 
"had another direction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Dixon, county administrative officer, said he could not understand why 
the conservancy felt left out. "Any version of the deal I've seen meant that 
with relatively little effort on their part and relatively little money, they 
came out a big winner" with Sullivan and Rustic canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and residents near the three canyons applauded the 
conservancy's move. Nita Rosenfeld, head of the neighboring Mandeville Canyon 
Assn.'s government committee, called Edmiston a "sly dog." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Schifferle, regional director for California-Nevada Wilderness 
Society, said she believes that swapping Elsmere for the other three canyons 
"is a fair trade." 
</P>
<P>
All of the properties are part of a proposed massive land exchange begun in 
February in legislation introduced by Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City). 
Berman declined comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
WHAT'S AT STAKE 
</P>
<P>
THE PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
BKK 
</P>
<P>
Has: Control of potential access route to Elsmere Canyon and part of proposed 
dump property. 
</P>
<P>
Wants: To develop and operate Elsmere Canyon landfill or obtain maximum price 
for its holdings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy 
</P>
<P>
Has: No assets to bring to bargaining table, but ability to shield BKK from 
possible condemnation proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Wants: To acquire Mission, Sullivan and Rustic canyons in Santa Monica 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County and County Sanitation Districts 
</P>
<P>
Have: Ownership of Mission, Rustic and Sullivan canyons and power to condemn 
access route to Elsmere Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Want: To operate Elsmere Canyon landfill as public dump. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE DEAL 
</P>
<P>
BKK gives conservancy title to Elsmere Canyon access land, precluding 
condemnation by county because land owned by public agency -- the conservancy 
-- cannot by law be condemned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE EFFECT 
</P>
<P>
BKK's hand is potentially strengthened and the conservancy becomes a player in 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conservancy hopes to obtain Mission, Rustic and Sullivan canyons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BKK seeks to improve its bargaining position on Elsmere Canyon rights by 
preventing condemnation, at least until it has consolidated its landfill 
holdings.

IT'S NO ACCIDENT WHEN BEAN MAKES WORK EASY; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: WITH WORLD TRAVEL, MANY STAGE AND TV PERFORMANCES AND TWO MARRIAGES 
BEHIND HIM, BEAN FINDS FUN IN FO'S POLITICAL SATIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"I made a decision a few years back to never again do anything professionally 
that I didn't want to do," announced Orson Bean. "And I've stuck to that. I 
turned down a TV show ("MacGyver") for a lot of dough 'cause I wanted to do 
this play." 
</P>
<P>
"This play" is Dario Fo's political satire, "Accidental Death of an Anarchist," 
currently at the Odyssey Theatre under the direction of Ron Sossi. In it, Bean 
plays an enigmatic professional fraud, whose past "covers" have included a 
dentist and college professor. Now under arrest, he learns that there's an 
internal police inquiry going on in the jail where he's being held -- and 
decides to impersonate the investigating judge. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm having the time of my life," grinned the actor, lean and dapper at 61. "I 
don't want to go home when (the show) is over. Sure, it's work -- but it feels 
like fun. It was much harder 40 years ago. I used to get nervous then. Now, 
I've learned not to make things a problem. I mean, acting is so easy! I love it 
and I'm good at it. I'm better at it than I was when it was hard. That comes 
from being 61 years old, and from doing it a lot. Anything that's done 
correctly is easy. Not just looks easy, is easy." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Bean (whose past Odyssey appearances include "Symmes' Hole" last 
May and "Hess" in 1984) isn't making a lot of money doing stage work doesn't 
faze him at all. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wrong to make a living off the theater," he said firmly. "Theater should 
be supported, like redwood trees. You should make your living -- whether you're 
a writer or an actor or a director -- in movies or commercials. But you do 
theater out of love. You can always make a living doing the other stuff. I make 
more than a handsome living doing voices for commercials; I hear myself all day 
on the tube. Lately, I'm selling Jeep Eagles and Diet 7-Up and Samsonite 
luggage and La-Z-Boy recliners . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Money is only a problem for those people who decide it's a problem," he 
insisted. "A couple of years ago, I was living in the Palisades, and there was 
a huge fire that came within three houses of us. When the firemen came to 
evacuate us, my kids were saying, 'What about my TV set? What about my 
phonograph?' I said, 'Don't worry, I can spring for a new phonograph.' 'What if 
the house burns down?' I said, 'I don't know -- maybe we'll pitch a tent on the 
beach and live there.' They said, 'Oooh, can we?' " 
</P>
<P>
He smiled. "Once I understood it was all in the attitude, I stopped worrying 
about making a living. And the phone always rings -- as it always has. I always 
get a job, as I always have. The only thing that's left out is the worrying 
about it. And you know, indifference is a great aphrodisiac. If you're not 
needy, you get. If you're overly anxious to have a love relationship, the women 
stay away in droves. If you're genuinely indifferent, they'll follow you 
anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
As for him, after two marriages, the actor is currently -- happily -- without a 
mate. One of his four children lives with him full-time, another part-time at 
his Venice home. "Over a period of 25 years, I was 
daddy-husband-provider-protector," he explained. "And when (the second marriage 
ended), it was agony. But little by little, I've come to see the joy of it: at 
3 in the afternoon, being able to say, 'I'm going to the movies' -- and I don't 
have to ask anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Bean's independence from marital ties is a far cry from the late '60s, when he 
packed up his brood and went to Australia. "I turned 40 and ran away from 
home," he said lightly. "I had a lot of money in the bank and I just spent it." 
After 1 1/2 years, "I came back, pierced my ear, grew a beard, bought an old 
van, threw the kids in the back, and we lived like hippies for three years." 
(This period also included experimentation with LSD, one of many darker 
adventures chronicled in his 1988 autobiography "Too Much Is Not Enough"). 
</P>
<P>
Bean also was well known in the '70s for promoting psychiatrist Wilhelm Reich's 
self-healing theories of the "orgone box" on talk shows and in a book. "As far 
as it goes, it's wonderful," said Bean. "(Reich) was an absolute genius, though 
absolutely bananas. I still hold him in high regard. I don't practice, but I do 
things I learned in therapy, exercises to take anxiety and fear away. I did it 
for three years, and it's over with." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Vermont and reared in Cambridge, Mass., Bean (ne Dallas Frederick 
Burrows) began as a magician, then a stand-up comedian, then an actor. In his 
20 years on Broadway ("In the days when you could go from one show to 
another"), his starring vehicles included "Subways Are for Sleeping" and "Will 
Success Spoil Rock Hunter?" 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoyed it," Bean acknowledged of the success. "But I never took it 
seriously. I made up my mind I was going to walk that thin line between fame 
and oblivion. The only real benefit of being famous is being recognized by head 
waiters and getting good tables at restaurants. The rest is part ego trip and 
part inconvenience. But sure, I love going to Sardi's and seeing if my 
picture's still up -- it is -- or when people come up and say, 'I saw you in 
such and such . . .' 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, (adulation) is one of the reasons you start doing this. It's why I 
stood up in grammar school, made faces and wrote filthy things on the 
blackboard. But once you get past that, the actual craft is there -- and that 
becomes the fun. One day, I made a conscious decision to retire my ego: gave it 
a gold watch, thanked it for many years of service and told it I didn't need it 
anymore. Oh, it still comes around once in awhile, looking to do something. I 
have to remind it that it doesn't live here anymore."

LATINO HISTORY MUSEUM GETS GO-AHEAD GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supporters of a proposed California Museum of Latino History, Art and Culture 
are moving forward with confidence, having hired a consultant to help find a 
site and develop fund-raising plans now that they have received $300,000 in 
seed money from the state legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the legislation and the state grant now establish this museum as the 
museum for Latino history, art and culture in California," Assemblyman Charles 
M. Calderon (D-Whittier), who authored the funding bill, said Tuesday. "It 
provides us now with the credentials that we need to talk to corporations and 
other philanthropists." 
</P>
<P>
As described in Calderon's legislation, the museum is intended to "inform and 
educate the public as to the contributions of Latino-Americans and enhance 
cultural understanding and appreciation." It will house contemporary artworks 
and historical and cultural artifacts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees of the proposed museum have hired David de la Torre, a former director 
of the Mexican Museum in San Francisco, as consultant "to help develop the 
mission for the museum as well as a long-term and short-term development plan, 
which would include fund-raising strategy, site location and development," 
Calderon said. 
</P>
<P>
The legislature's passage of the $300,000 bill came earlier this month after a 
four-year effort by Calderon, Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre and 
other Latino community leaders. The museum was originally envisioned in 1980 by 
historian Antonio Rios-Bustamante, who four years later created a nonprofit 
organization to raise money for it. In 1986, Calderon introduced a bill to 
secure state funds for a feasibility study of the proposed museum. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been long in coming," Alatorre said in an interview Tuesday. "We're on 
our way. . . . What these initial monies will do is provide us the seed money 
to begin." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Los Angeles City Council allocated $50,000 to be used toward the 
building of the museum. 
</P>
<P>
No site has yet been selected, but Mike Burns, Calderon's chief of staff, said 
he was "99% sure it will be in the L.A. area, just because most of the Hispanic 
population is in the area and it wouldn't make sense not to have it there." 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Duarte, Inglewood and Los Angeles have all expressed interest in 
housing the museum, he said, and corporations such as Citibank, Chevron and 
Arco are considering making contributions to the private, nonprofit museum. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Calderon said, he has received about 20 offers to donate money, land or 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"There are cities, counties, private developers that have made offers already," 
Calderon said. "It will cut costs significantly if we can get a donation from 
some municipality for the land. . . . I believe that's entirely possible just 
based on the offers we've had already." 
</P>
<P>
Although no date has been set, Calderon said he believes that ground can be 
broken within the next 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in January, 1991, the museum's board of trustees will report yearly to 
the state legislature on the status of the museum and on how the state funds 
have been spent. 
</P>
<P>
"Passage of this legislation marks a new era of recognition and respect for the 
Latino community," Calderon said. "The importance of the legislation is not 
simply the construction of a museum. Rather, it is the opportunity to educate 
our children and the entire state about a rich and varied culture that has been 
overlooked for too long. With the Hispanic population in California growing so 
rapidly, this small acknowledgment of their far-reaching contributions is very 
meaningful to the entire Hispanic community."

MOCA GIVES ARTISTS NEW VOICE VIA AIRWAVES; 
</P>
<P>
RADIO: 16-WEEK PROGRAM SHOWCASES DIVERSITY WITH A LINEUP OF DANCERS, PAINTERS, 
PHOTOGRAPHERS AND OTHERS.

"I've always been plugged into the wall," Peter Sellars declared. "I love 
radio. It's where I live, where I come from." It's also where the Los Angeles 
Festival's artistic director has been spending some of his happiest creative 
time recently -- as a contributor to "The Territory of Art," a 16-part weekly 
radio series sponsored by the Museum of Contemporary Art and broadcast locally 
on KCRW-FM (89.9). The program begins its third season today at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Sellars has two pieces in the coming lineup -- "Where the Exile Lives" and Jack 
Kerouac's poetry cycle "Mexico City Blues," both products of his recent work 
with UCLA theater students. "I find Kerouac better to listen to at a low 
volume, where you can't quite make things out," he said kiddingly of the 
free-from "Blues." In "Exile," Sellars' adaptation of Ezra Pound's adaptation 
of a Japanese Noh play, the characters are now Vietnam vets living on the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
Sellars firmly believes listeners will get a unique and valuable workout. "You 
don't lose anything," he said of the stage-to-radio transition. "The visual 
loss is a relief. It detaches the slavish link of visual to auditory. It's a 
very pure realm; the images are complex and evoked by sound. Sound provokes 
memory -- and, of course, a sense of the interior experience. So it's 
automatically private because each of us feels sound separately." 
</P>
<P>
During November, the half-hour programs include Armin Medosch's "Radio Subcom 
-- Europa Report," artist Richard Kriesche's "Informationsculpture", 
choreographer Elizabeth Streb's "Airworks," Iris Rose's voice piece "Society of 
Mothers" and composer Carl Stone's Asian-themed "Thonburi." 
</P>
<P>
"The idea has always been to showcase and endorse the diversity of art," said 
MOCA curator Julie Lazar, the executive producer of the series. Hence the 
inclusion of dancers, painters, photographers, musicians, storytellers and 
poets -- from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
"We have new works, individual works, works converted from one form to 
another," she noted. "One of the things I feel most strongly about is that all 
that richness coexists in this small series. People sampled other cultures, 
adapted and adopted them." 
</P>
<P>
For Lazar -- who commissions, supervises, produces and markets the pieces on a 
$150,000 budget (the National Endowment for the Arts and the Rockefeller 
Foundation provide partial funding) -- the primary goal is to have these arts 
voices heard. Although $10 audio cassettes of new and past programs are 
available at MOCA's gift shop, the weekly programs are provided free -- via 
satellite -- to radio stations nationally and internationally. (Locally, 
KUSC-FM is also broadcasting the series.) 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very complicated thing for a couple of people in a museum to be doing," 
Lazar said. "We have a lot of artists from the West Coast, large and small 
organizations, known and lesser-known people; the mix is important. We also 
have two hosts, Ruth Maleczech and Guillermo Gomez-Pena -- who has a strong 
accent, the kind of voice that doesn't regularly make it on radio. We've gone 
against a lot of traditional standards." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of her enthusiasm, Lazar concedes that the ongoing controversy over 
government funding for the arts has worried her. 
</P>
<P>
"What was acceptable before is not acceptable now," she said, noting the 
fundamentalist outcry a few years ago when a sexually explicit drama was 
broadcast on KPFK. "The level of censorship has definitely affected our 
programming. We haven't been censored yet, but the climate has changed. (A few 
tapes carry "language" warnings.) What's ironic is that some of the things the 
artists say are more acceptable in other countries -- where freedoms are not as 
assured as they are here." 
</P>
<P>
Performance artist May Sun, who premiered a portion of her 
"LA/River/China/Town" in "Territory of Art's" kickoff gala Oct. 13 at the Japan 
America Theatre, is first up in the radio series.

In the piece, Sun focuses on the history of the Chinatown community. "So much 
is unknown, unrecorded," said the artist. Talking with area residents and 
immersing herself in historical texts, Sun's piece focuses on the Chinese 
railroad workers who settled here in the 1860s -- with the L.A. River as a 
metaphoric link between the old and new worlds. 
</P>
<P>
Created as an 8,000 square-foot installation, Sun's work (co-conceived by 
director Peter Brosius, with a score by Tom Recchion) was on display last 
winter at the Santa Monica Museum of Art. "The original piece was very visual, 
and it's a shame people can't see that," she said. "But the text did come first 
-- then the music, then the visual. So for radio, we made it more of a journey 
and described the visuals."

Paced by a horror anthology, a movie about Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal and a 
dramatic series about soldiers in Vietnam, HBO dominated the nominations for 
the 11th annual ACE Awards Thursday, the cable industry's version of the Emmys. 
</P>
<P>
HBO grabbed 103 of the 338 nominations from the National Academy of Cable 
Programming, with "Tales from the Crypt," the pay-cable network's series of 
horror stories, leading all programs with 16 nominations. Its movie "Murderers 
Among Us: The Simon Wiesenthal Story," which won an Emmy last month for its 
teleplay, was the second-most recognized program with 10 nominations, while 
"Vietnam War Story" placed third with 8. 
</P>
<P>
HBO's spoof of televangelism, "Glory! Glory!" garnered 6 nominations, including 
acting honors for Ellen Greene, Richard Thomas and James Whitmore. 
</P>
<P>
With "It's Garry Shandling's Show" paving the way with 7 nominations, including 
3 for its writing staff, Showtime's 29 total nominations made it the second 
most-honored cable service. The Disney Channel came in third with 23, Arts 
&amp; Entertainment had 21, CNN and ESPN tied with 18, TNT nabbed 17, Lifetime 
and TBS each tallied 13 and the Discovery Channel rounded out the top 10 with 
11 nominations. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty different cable networks, including local sports service Prime Ticket, 
received at least one nomination. 
</P>
<P>
"Not Necessarily the News' " Lucy Webb, who has won the ACE for best actress in 
a comedy series four consecutive years, picked up yet another nomination. Her 
streak might be in jeopardy this year, however, as she runs up against 
Emmy-nominated Blair Brown, the star of "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd," 
which moved from NBC to Lifetime earlier this year and grabbed 5 ACE 
nominations. 
</P>
<P>
Awards in the high-profile categories will be presented during a ceremony at 
the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles on Jan. 14. About 10 cable networks will

TURNABOUT IN SHOOTING TESTIMONY;

<P>
TRIAL: JOSEPH GROSSO HAS CHANGED HIS EARLIER STORY, TESTIFYING THAT HIS 
CO-DEFENDANT SHOT AND BLINDED MUSTANG BAR FIGURE WILLIAM CARROLL. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph Angelo Grosso, in a turnabout from earlier public statements, told 
jurors Wednesday that his co-defendant -- Los Angeles racketeer Michael Anthony 
Rizzitello Jr. -- shot the chief financier of the Mustang topless bar, who was 
left for dead in a deserted parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso, 46, also admitted for the first time that he was driving the car on May 
1, 1987, when financier William Carroll, seated next to him, was left 
permanently blind from three bullets to the back of the head. But Grosso told 
jurors in his trial for attempted murder that the shooting was a surprise to 
him. He denied prosecution claims that he was a participant in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The Grosso-Rizzitello case has drawn widespread attention among Southern 
California law enforcement officials because of Rizzitello's known role as an 
under-boss in the Milano organized crime family in Los Angeles. Rizzitello, 62, 
has a long history of fraud and racketeering convictions. But this is the most 
serious trouble he has ever faced in a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso's decision to name Rizzitello as the triggerman is viewed as highly 
damaging to the racketeer, whose own trial in the Carroll attack is expected to 
begin in late November. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso told a radically different story of what happened to a Los Angeles Times 
reporter in a jailhouse interview last March. He said then that Rizzitello had 
nothing to do with the shooting. He also denied that he was in the car. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Grosso told The Times that Carroll was shot by Big George Yudzevich, a 
former Mustang bouncer who has since been murdered. "Mike Rizzitello didn't 
shoot nobody," Grosso declared then. Grosso also said in the interview that as 
he, Carroll and Yudzevich were leaving a Costa Mesa restaurant, his pager went 
off and he left to use a pay phone, unaware what Yudzevich was going to do. 
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday, Grosso said on cross-examination that he made up that story 
on orders from Rizzitello, who was also in County Jail. Grosso said Rizzitello 
had threatened to kill him and his family if Grosso testified against him. 
</P>
<P>
"You've told about this shooting a whole bunch of different ways, haven't you? 
How many? 10? 20?" Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans barked at Grosso on 
cross- 
</P>
<P>
examination. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably more than that," Grosso admitted. "It may have saved my life." 
</P>
<P>
"You are a gifted actor, aren't you?" the prosecutor shot back. "When you get 
in a tight spot, you tell a story, don't you?" 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, 57, claims that Rizzitello shot him from the back seat of his car in a 
parking garage near the Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. Carroll 
identified Grosso to jurors last week as the driver who held him down to 
prevent his escape. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello has denied involvement in the Carroll shooting. His attorney, 
Anthony P. Brooklier, will say only that "my client is an innocent man." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that Rizzitello wanted to take control of the Mustang Club 
on Harbor Boulevard, since closed because of two arson fires, and decided to 
eliminate Carroll, who had not been cooperative. Then, prosecutors allege, 
Rizzitello moved in on Gene Lesher, Carroll's successor, with more death 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
Lesher has testified that he gave in to Rizzitello's demands out of fear for 
his safety. He also told jurors that Grosso was part of the conspiracy to take 
over the topless bar. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso, a longtime FBI informant, on Wednesday said that he was only Carroll's 
driver and that he had no relationship with Rizzitello at all. But both Carroll 
and Lesher testified that it was always Grosso who would call them on 
Rizzitello's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony by Grosso on Wednesday bore many similarities to Carroll's version of 
what happened. But there were some exceptions, particularly on Grosso's 
involvement, and on where the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso said the shooting took place in an open-air parking lot near Antonello's 
restaurant in Santa Ana's South Coast Village, not in the parking garage a few 
blocks away where Carroll was found bleeding and left for dead. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll testified that Grosso arranged a meeting between him and Rizzitello at 
Emilia's restaurant in Santa Ana on April 30, 1987, the night of the shooting. 
Grosso admitted that he was at the dinner meeting but denied that he set it up. 
Carroll has testified that he hoped Rizzitello would have information on who 
had shot at him two weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso told jurors Wednesday that Rizzitello was upset that night because 
Carroll had ordered the death of Jimmy Casino, the former Mustang operator, 
without permission from Rizzitello. (Prosecutors insist that Carroll has never 
been a suspect in the Casino shooting, which remains unsolved, and Carroll has 
denied involvement.) 
</P>
<P>
Carroll has testified that Rizzitello and Grosso asked him, after dinner at 
Emilia's, to take them to Grosso's car in the parking garage. Grosso, who had 
driven for Carroll before, got behind the wheel. Grosso testified Wednesday 
that he drove them to Antonello's, rather than the parking garage on Carroll's 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll has testified that Grosso held him down once they reached the empty 
garage so that Rizzitello could shoot him. Grosso testified Wednesday that he 
had just pulled Carroll's car into a side lot near Antonello's, and almost had 
the car parked, when he heard a shot. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso: "I felt something metal hit my head, and I heard a loud boom, a 
tremendous noise, and then a ringing in my ears. . . . I thought I had been 
shot. I ran." 
</P>
<P>
Grosso had an apartment just a few blocks away, and he told jurors that he ran 
there. Afterward, he said, he treated a wound to his head and then headed for 
the Balboa Bay Club, where he spent the next two days. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutor Evans hit Grosso hard, claiming clear contradictions in Grosso's 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Grosso admitted that the FBI was paying him at the time for 
information on Carroll's activities. Yet Grosso told the jurors he deliberately 
tried not to hear anything Carroll said at his meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Grosso told the jurors that Carroll admitted to him that he was 
responsible for at least a dozen murders. But Grosso also said that when he 
drove Carroll on business, the financier made it a point to prevent Grosso from 
knowing what he was doing most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
On direct examination, Grosso said Rizzitello angrily told Carroll in the car: 
"Do you just want to kill everybody?" On cross-examination, Grosso said that 
Rizzitello asked the question at the restaurant. When Evans pointed out the 
discrepancy, Grosso said that Rizzitello said it both in the restaurant and in 
the car. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Grosso indicated to jurors that he went to the Balboa Bay Club to hide 
out because he was too scared to stay in his apartment. But Evans produced 
records to show that Grosso was already checked into the Balboa Bay Club before 
the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso attorney William Yacobozzi Jr. has told jurors that Carroll had numerous 
enemies and that any one of them might have tried to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso denied that he knew anything about an attempt by Rizzitello to take over 
the Mustang. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll included Grosso as one of the attackers because he was upset at 
learning that Grosso had spied on him for the FBI, Grosso speculated on the 
witness stand Wednesday.

NEWPORT WATER, USERS SQUIRMING

NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drawing a bath or filling a glass at the kitchen sink has become an adventure 
for thousands of residents here. 
</P>
<P>
Besides water, tiny green wormlike larvae have been flowing from some taps in 
recent weeks -- an unsavory sight that has spurred complaints and boosted sales 
of bottled water in this tony town by the sea. 
</P>
<P>
County health officials say the half-inch-long insects pose no apparent health 
hazard, even if accidentally ingested. 
</P>
<P>
"Aesthetically, though, I don't blame people for being upset," said Robert E. 
Merryman, director of Orange County's Environmental Health Division. "Fly 
larvae in one's drinking water is unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach utility officials agree, but so far have been unable to eradicate 
the threadlike pest at the source, Big Canyon Reservoir. A few weeks ago, the 
bugs -- harmless larvae of the common midge fly -- began showing up 
sporadically in some sinks, toilets and bathtubs in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"In any given cup of water you could get none or one or five," said Robert J. 
Dixon, the city's utilities director. "Chances are remote any will come out, 
but it can happen." 
</P>
<P>
Just ask David Malone, an 18-year-old student who was at home two weeks ago 
filling a glass through a refrigerator water dispenser when he spotted "a green 
curly thing floating around." 
</P>
<P>
"I took one look at it, tossed the water out and called the city," said Malone, 
who lives with his mother in the 100 block of Scholz Plaza, near Hoag Hospital 
in Newport Beach. "We switched to bottled water right away." 
</P>
<P>
City officials are puzzled by the larvae infestation, especially at this time 
of year. Midges, the troublesome little flies that clog the air by the millions 
every spring and summer, surface around open reservoirs, lakes, streams or 
ponds, where they hatch in the warm sun. 
</P>
<P>
But by early fall, as temperatures cool and the rains return, the flies -- and 
larvae -- usually dissipate as the bugs' sexual appetite wanes, resulting in 
fewer eggs being deposited in the nutrient-rich algae that grows on reservoir 
bottoms or in creek beds. 
</P>
<P>
"An occasional larvae sighting is not uncommon, especially in midsummer during 
the peak breeding season," Dixon said. "Usually it lasts a week or two, at 
most. But this is going on several weeks." 
</P>
<P>
And what started with a few phone calls from bugged residents is now attracting 
widespread attention. Dixon spent most of Wednesday showing reporters and TV 
camera crews samples of live larvae at the Big Canyon Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
"We just want people to know what to look for, and realize there is nothing to 
worry about," Dixon said. "I just wish I knew when this was going to end." 
</P>
<P>
Water supplied to about two-thirds of Newport Beach's 70,000 residents, 
including those living in Corona del Mar, Balboa Island, the Peninsula, East 
Bluff, West Newport and the Hoag Hospital area, comes from Big Canyon 
Reservoir, a 23-acre, open-air basin owned and managed by the city. The 
asphalt-lined reservoir can hold up to 600 acre-feet -- enough water for the 
entire city for six days. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have received nearly two dozen complaints, but none from Hoag 
Hospital, spokeswoman Pam Bolin said. Patients there routinely get bottled 
water, partially as a result of a similar infestation traced to the Big Canyon 
Reservoir in 1981 when larvae were found in hospital's drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
Although the hospital has had no problems, Bolin wasn't so sure about her 
Promontory Point home, so she performed her own tap test when she got home one 
night earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
"First thing I did was fill a glass," Bolin said. "Thank goodness, there was 
nothing in it. The thought makes me uneasy." 
</P>
<P>
That sentiment was shared by managers of the 1,300-unit Park Newport 
Apartments, a upscale, gated complex not far from Fashion Island. The managers 
sent out a notice to their 2,000 residents notifying them of the problem and 
informing them there was ample bottled water at the complex. 
</P>
<P>
The problem has proved profitable for those who sell bottled water. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had about 10 people come in and buy that expensive French water today," 
said Mitch Carr, a convenience store manager near the Newport Pier. "They tell 
me there are worms in the local water. I don't care if there are grasshoppers 
as long as they keep buying that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Utility officials have battled the midge with chemical treatment of the 
reservoir, but so far that has had little effect, Dixon said. Chlorine and 
copper sulfates are used year-round to kill the algae on the reservoir bottom 
and slopes where the midge eggs hatch. But even increasing the chemical dosage 
has failed to curb the problem, Dixon said. Several industrial-size "bug 
zappers," similar to the fluorescent lights on patios that attract and 
electrocute bugs, have been installed around the perimeter of the reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
One solution would be to drain the reservoir and scrub away the algae, said 
Peter Antista, the city's water quality control supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
"But that means dumping $750,000 worth of water, and leaving the city 
vulnerable in the event of an emergency, like an earthquake," Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
The long-term solution, Dixon said, is putting a vinyl cover over the reservoir 
to halt the algae growth, which would virtually eliminate the midge population. 
But that would cost up to $3 million, and Dixon said the city should wait until 
the Metropolitan Water District decides whether to cap the nearby San Joaquin 
Reservoir. Water from the San Joaquin Reservoir is used to refill the city's 
Big Canyon facility. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make sense to cover ours and then accept water from an open-air 
reservoir that may have larvae," Dixon said. What's more, he added, residents 
overlooking the San Joaquin basin have opposed MWD's plans to cap it, 
contending it would spoil their views. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the San Joaquin Reservoir or several other reservoirs in the county are 
experiencing a midge infestation similar to the one in Newport, officials said.

MIDGES AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
RUSS ARASMITH /Los Angeles Times 
</P>
<P>
Larva Adult 
</P>
<P>
MIDGES (Chironomidae) 
</P>
<P>
Where: Midges are flies common worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Life span: 48 hours or less. 
</P>
<P>
Reproduction: Prolific rate. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: Eggs are buried by females in the nutrient-rich algae that lines open 
bodies of fresh water -- reservoirs, lakes, streams and ponds. 
</P>
<P>
Appearance: The threadlike midge larvae is usually green but can be dark, 
almost brown. Often mistaken for a worm. Under a microscope they even look like 
a tiny shrimp or lobster. They are about a quarter- to a half-inch long. 
</P>
<P>
Habits: Once airborne, they travel in swarms. In some parts of the world the 
swarms are so large that from a distance they appear as a low cloud or ground 
fog, at times blocking the sun. Most prevalent in the late spring and summer, 
when temperatures are highest and days longest. Adult midges are often confused 
with small mosquitoes. The hearty insect is resistant to many pesticides. 
Midges are not disease carriers and pose no health hazard, even if ingested.

LAND-USE: A PROPERTY SWAP MAKING ROOM FOR ANAHEIM'S INDOOR SPORTS ARENA WILL 
LEAVE NONE FOR AN EQUESTRIAN PROGRAM FOR DISABLED CHILDREN.

<P>
A widely known equestrian program for handicapped children and 250 horse owners 
face eviction from their long-established stables because of a land swap 
clearing the way for Anaheim's $75-million indoor sports arena. 
</P>
<P>
"We were kind of crushed," said Frosty Kaiser, executive director of the 
American Riding Club for the Handicapped, who learned Saturday that Rancho del 
Rio Stable land was sold as part of the arena deal. "We have so many horses and 
kids to try to locate, it kind of threw us into a panic this weekend." 
</P>
<P>
The riding program for handicapped children is operated by Kaiser and about 25 
therapists, secretaries, teachers and other adult volunteers. Children use the 
facility along the Orange Freeway nearly every day, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"For us to try to find a place in six months is kind of overwhelming," said 
Kaiser, whose 10-year-old operation has served about 100 children and has been 
recognized as the Orange County Special Olympics equestrian program. "We have 
to have wheelchair access and places to put our wheelchair ramps." 
</P>
<P>
This year, the group became the first handicapped children's equestrian unit 
ever to participate in the Pasadena Rose Parade. 
</P>
<P>
The eviction was set in motion last week when the city of Anaheim agreed to buy 
the property of the Phoenix Club, a German social organization, on Douglass 
Street north of Katella Avenue, where the city plans to build its 20,000-seat 
sports arena. As part of that deal, the city agreed to sell to the club a 
portion of the property where the stable is so the club may relocate. 
</P>
<P>
"What am I going to do with 250 horses?" asked stable owner Richard Tozer, a 
retired Anaheim firefighter who said he cannot get a meeting with the mayor to 
discuss the issue. "I can't fight the city of Anaheim, a big construction 
company and 3,000 Germans." 
</P>
<P>
Tozer has owned the stable for about 20 years, but in 1983 he gave a private 
developer an option to buy his property for $1.5 million. Now the developer, 
Sanderson, J.-Ray Development Co., has decided to exercise its option and buy 
the land so it can immediately resell the 9.2-acre parcel to the city for about 
$2.7 million. The Phoenix Club then will buy a portion of the land from the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Tozer says that Sanderson, J.-Ray Development had verbally assured him that the 
stable could stay in business, leasing space on the property if the firm bought 
the land. But now, Tozer says, the stable must go because the city needs the 
land to relocate the Phoenix Club. 
</P>
<P>
Hans Klein, president of the Phoenix Club, said the horse owners "have plenty 
of time" but stressed that the stable will not be allowed to remain on the 
property after the Phoenix Club has built its facility. 
</P>
<P>
"The plans are to start construction in January," Klein said. "We'd like to be 
in before October of next year." 
</P>
<P>
Tozer said that based on verbal promises by Sanderson, J.-Ray Development, he 
had assured his tenants -- which include the American Riding Club for the 
Handicapped -- that they would be allowed to remain on the land even if the 
development company bought the property. 
</P>
<P>
"They assured me all along they were going to keep this a stable," Tozer said 
of the developers. 
</P>
<P>
Tozer said he has an obligation to the people who board their horses at the 
stable. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not talking about legal obligation -- I'm talking about moral obligation," 
Tozer said. "This is like a family out here. We have barbecues. . . . I have 
families that have been here 18, 19 years." 
</P>
<P>
Chase Sanderson, James Ray and his brother, Michael Ray, the partners in the 
Irvine-based development firm, did not return telephone calls from The Times 
Wednesday. Neither did Mayor Fred Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
However, Anaheim Assistant City Manager Jim Ruth said Wednesday that "we're not 
going to be pushing anybody on the street." 
</P>
<P>
Since it became apparent the city would acquire the property, Anaheim officials 
have advised Tozer that they would try to find suitable land to relocate the 
horses, "hopefully in Anaheim, but there's no guarantee on that," Ruth said. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we have a moral obligation . . . and we are definitely working in 
that endeavor," Ruth said. "Our objective is to relocate all the horses." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth said he would meet next week with some of the horse owners. In the 
meantime, he said, the city has begun surveying stables in the area to find 
other available facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"The people I talked to the other day already had a handle on what other sites 
may be available," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth said that even though the developers may have told Tozer the stable could 
continue operating on leased land at the site, the city is "not buying land to 
provide a stable over there, that's for sure. The city is not interested in 
being in that business." 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson, J.-Ray Development, whose principals are campaign contributors to 
several council members, is involved in a complicated land swap that frees up 
the needed land for the proposed arena. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim City Council voted Friday to buy 7.6 acres of industrially zoned 
land on Douglass Street near Katella Avenue for $8 million from the Phoenix 
Club. But the purchase of the Phoenix property hinged on two related land 
deals, approved Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The city also agreed to pay $5.9 million to Sanderson, J.-Ray Development for 
14.5 acres, which includes Tozer's property. The city in turn sold about 8.5 
acres of that property to the Phoenix Club for $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, The city also sold Sanderson, J.-Ray Development another 
14.5-acre site at Weir Canyon Road and La Palma Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Tozer's 9.2-acre site includes about seven acres under high voltage power 
lines, which restricts what can be built there, Ruth said. 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson, J.-Ray Development "told me the part under the (Southern California) 
Edison (Co.) easement has no value for anything except strawberries or horses, 
so we'll keep the horses in there," Tozer said. "They said I could lease it 
back." 
</P>
<P>
But Ruth said Wednesday the property under the power lines will be used by the 
Phoenix Club for parking to serve the club's new meeting facility. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser believes that it will be difficult to find another location for her 
handicapped children's program. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to have something centrally located for most of our kids," Kaiser 
said. "Land is at a premium in Orange County, especially for stables. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the stables in Orange County are slowly being lost to construction or 
housing. We are really in a dilemma on what to do and where to go."

acres, which includes Richard Tozer's Rancho Del Rio Stable. The city in turn 
sold about 8.5 acres of that property to the Phoenix Club for $3 million and 
will keep the rest of the land.

3 SAVED AFTER BOAT CAPSIZES AT SEA ; 
</P>
<P>
RESCUE: COAST GUARD PULLS MEN TO SAFETY AFTER THEIR FISHING BOAT IS SWAMPED BY 
8-FOOT SWELLS OFF NEWPORT BEACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Three fishermen clinging to boards and fearing shark attacks were plucked by 
helicopter from the icy waters of a stormy Pacific Ocean on Wednesday, one hour 
after their 68-foot boat capsized in punishing eight-foot swells and 30-knot 
winds off Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time we thought we wouldn't make it," said 21-year-old Kelly 
Green, a crew member of the Capaz, after the rescue. "We were sitting out there 
on those boards, bobbing up and down, with no one and nothing else in sight. It 
doesn't get much closer than this." 
</P>
<P>
Green, his friend Mark Schones, and owner and skipper Steve Shipkey were 
returning about 4 p.m. from a six-day trip aboard the commercial fishing vessel 
based in Newport Beach when heavy seas covered the boat about 15 miles 
offshore. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Green and Schones said they were asleep in the galley when 
they were awakened by Shipkey's screams. The Capaz had been overtaken by a 
storm caused by a low-pressure system that moved into the California deserts 
Tuesday night, according to the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
"A swell hit us and filled the deck with water," said Schones, 25. "The boat 
became heavy on one side. Then right after, another swell hit us and the boat 
began filling up. Steve was on the radio (to the Coast Guard). He was also 
yelling to us, 'Get the life raft! Get the life raft!' " 
</P>
<P>
Shaken from their sleep, Green and Schones said they managed to inflate the 
raft but could not cut it loose. "I couldn't find a knife," Green said. "And I 
didn't have much time to look because the boat was going down fast." 
</P>
<P>
While the crew members tried to loosen the raft, Shipkey gave the Coast Guard 
their location. 
</P>
<P>
"He was shouting 'May Day, May Day, May Day,' and just when the Coast Guard 
asked how many people were on the boat, we were sinking faster, and he had to 
dive out." 
</P>
<P>
Green was the only one who managed to grab his life jacket. Green and Shipkey 
climbed aboard a piece of what had been the deck of the Capaz, loosened by the 
pounding swells. Schones mounted another. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to paddle away from the boat because we were scared that it would 
topple on us and suck us in when it went down," Green said. The men stayed on 
the boards as the disabled boat and its debris drifted away. In the meantime, 
eight-foot waves driven by 30-knot winds covered the floating pieces of board. 
"We had to stick our head up when the waves went over us," Schones said. "We 
would be hit by a big one, and then as soon as we lifted our head above the 
water, another one would slam straight in our face." 
</P>
<P>
After about 20 minutes, Green said the trio spotted a freighter that was 
heading toward them. 
</P>
<P>
"I took off my life jacket and waved," he said, explaining that the vessel was 
some distance away. "I thought they saw us. But then all of a sudden, it 
changed direction. I said, 'Hey, what's this? Don't leave us here.' " 
</P>
<P>
The next 45 minutes were "sheer mental torture," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
The Capaz was laden with a catch of blue marlin. Both men said they feared 
sharks would pick up the scent of the catch and attack. 
</P>
<P>
"There was shark out there, all right," said Green. During the fishing trip, 
"we would lower our catch in the water to keep it fresh. When we hoisted it up, 
there were large chunks missing . . . shark-bite sizes." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Schones, a five-year veteran fisherman, is nicknamed "Shark" did 
not help. "We had to yell to talk to each other," Green said. "So Steve would 
yell 'Shark! Shark!' and I would look around and say 'Where? Where?' " 
</P>
<P>
Pounded by the icy waters and chilly winds, the men paddled around to keep 
warm. About an hour after they jumped from the sinking boat, they received the 
first real hope that they would be saved. Two planes flew in their direction, 
but apparently did not spot them on the floating boards, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helicopter Arrives 
</P>
<P>
The planes disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
But a few minutes later, a Coast Guard Dolphin HH-65 helicopter arrived in the 
vicinity of the now-capsized boat. The helicopter circled around the boat and 
debris that floated about 100 yards away from the survivors. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't see us," Schones said. "After Kelly waved his life jacket, they 
came our way." 
</P>
<P>
The survivors grabbed a basket lowered from the Coast Guard helicopter, which 
took them to John Wayne Airport where paramedics waited. The men declined 
medical treatment. Green's only visible injuries were skinned knees, while 
Schones said he was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Shipkey left the airport before he could be interviewed by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Petty Officer Dennis Ramirez said two patrol boats, a Falcon jet 
plane, one 41-foot rescue boat and the Dolphin helicopter joined in the search. 
</P>
<P>
"A 600-foot Israeli vessel called the Zimi Beria heard the May Day call first 
and was standing by to help," Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
At last report at dusk, the Capaz was still afloat in about 50 feet of water 
but capsized, Ramirez said. Swells are expected to decrease Thursday, according 
to weather forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
No other distress calls were received Wednesday, according to Ramirez, of the 
Long Beach office of the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
Wrapped in blankets but still shivering, Green and Schones sipped coffee as 
they related the incident to Sheriff's Deputy Ron Harvey at the airport's fire 
station Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Schones said the ordeal hasn't made him give up fishing. He said he will leave 
next week to begin a new fishing job in Kodiak Island, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Green had other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to go home, drink a beer, hug my girlfriend, and think of another 
profession."

FULLERTON AIRPORT REPORT DUE IN WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city expects to receive a report from the Federal Aviation Administration 
in the next week in response to its request for a investigation into the safety 
of nearby Fullerton Municipal Airport, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
After the Sept. 16 crash of a light plane in Buena Park, city officials had 
asked the FAA for statistics on the number of crashes at the Fullerton airport 
compared to other facilities the same size. 
</P>
<P>
The city was told by the FAA that preparation of the final report should be 
completed by next week, according to Ken Griffith, the city's administrator of 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
City officials wrote to Jerold Chavkin, regional administrator with the FAA, 10 
days after the latest Fullerton airport accident when a two-seat Cessna 152 
carrying an instructor and a student pilot crashed at the intersection of 
Artesia Boulevard and Darlington Street in Buena Park.

8 ARRESTED IN DRUG CASE; $236, 000 SEIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Eight people suspected of being mid-level drug dealers, including four 
Colombians, were arrested by Fullerton police after a three-month 
investigation, officers said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a "reverse sting," several of the suspects were preparing to pay $230,000 
cash to undercover police officers for 30 kilograms of cocaine, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects never received the cocaine. Instead, they were arrested and booked 
on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic in narcotics. Police seized five cars and 
a total of $236,000, Police Sgt. Dan Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests late Tuesday capped an investigation that included months of 
negotiations with the suspects to both buy and sell cocaine, Becerra said. 
Patricia Najarro, 33, the only woman among those arrested, flew from her home 
in San Mateo to take part, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests occurred at three locales in Fullerton and one in Anaheim, Becerra 
said. At a motel parking lot, officers arrested Carlos Ortiz, 18, of San 
Fernando; Rudy Romero, 23, of Los Angeles; and Emilio Salgado, 23, of Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, Fernando Montoya, 25, of Laguna Niguel was arrested at a 
home improvement center parking lot. Sergio Cardona, 30, and Humberto Millan, 
36, both of Santa Ana, were arrested at a pizza parlor parking lot. Officers 
arrested Najarro and Ivan Solis, 35, of Hacienda Heights at a Pacific Bell 
telephone facility where he works in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Becerra said Cardona, Ortiz, Millan and Montoya are Colombian citizens while 
Salgado and Romero are Mexican nationals. He said Najarro was on probation for 
a conviction on a possession of drugs for sale charge. CHRIS WOODYARD

6 SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN TRUCK-THEFT TRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A young Garden Grove man and five juveniles were arrested Wednesday on 
suspicion of trying to steal a pickup truck in a housing tract. The arrests 
came minutes after officers had investigated a similar attempted truck theft, 
police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley police officers went to the 10300 block of Morning Glory Avenue 
at about 3:30 a.m. after receiving a report that some men were trying to steal 
a small imported pickup truck. The Toyota pickup showed signs of tampering, but 
no suspects could be found, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Cruising another housing tract, Officer Jim Floren found a man and five 
teen-agers who he said appeared to be trying to steal a similar Toyota pickup 
truck. Arrested were Dung Manh Nguyen, 19, of Garden Grove and five juvenile 
suspects, ages 14 to 17, all from Garden Grove. All were booked on suspicion of 
attempted vehicle theft and auto burglary.

BOARD OKS COMPROMISE TO REDUCE SIZE OF LAGUNA NIGUEL TRACT; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: SHAPELL INDUSTRIES WILL CUT THE NUMBER OF HOMES IN COUNTRY VILLAGE 
BY 291 AND INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF PARKLAND BY ANOTHER FIVE ACRES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After years of bitter fighting, a lawsuit and a grand jury investigation, the 
Board of Supervisors on Wednesday approved a compromise plan allowing 
completion of the largest single housing development in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of a vote next month on cityhood for the area, both developer 
Shapell Industries Inc. and longtime critics of the size of the 
once-controversial venture agreed on a slightly scaled-back plan that includes 
more public parkland. That plan, reducing the number of homes by 291, overcame 
its largest major bureaucratic hurdle when it was unanimously endorsed by 
supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Shapell's Country Village development was the first large housing tract to be 
approved by supervisors under a development agreement, which guaranteed 
building rights in return for contributions toward roads, fire stations, 
libraries and parks. Shapell, of Beverly Hills, has completed about half the 
project on 1,232 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors praised the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"Good people get together and good things can happen," said Supervisor Harriett 
M. Wieder. The action Wednesday represented the first time the supervisors have 
made a change in any of the more than 20 development agreements they have 
signed since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very important action," said Thomas B. Mathews, executive assistant 
to County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, whose district includes Laguna Niguel. 
"The significance is in the timing as Laguna Niguel is on the eve of 
incorporating. . . . It's my impression (that) if it becomes a city in November 
it will have its hands full. It's good that they get this resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"The action today is an outstanding gift from a major developer and the 
existing leaders in the community. There was a lot of hard work that went into 
this," Mathews said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in Laguna Niguel will vote next month whether to incorporate into a 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have cleared all the major hurdles now," said Tom Wilson, the head 
of the Laguna Niguel Community Council. "We did not want to have this as an 
issue during the transition from a community to cityhood." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal approved by the supervisors Wednesday would: 
</P>
<P>
* Decrease the maximum number of dwelling units by 291, from 4,777 to 4,486. 
</P>
<P>
* Strengthen requirements for parkland within the project and increase the 
amount of regional and local parkland by five acres. 
</P>
<P>
* Allow residential uses in a business park district. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors will vote next week to include the changes made Wednesday in Laguna 
Niguel's area plan. But the vote Wednesday was considered the critical hurdle 
to the development. The county is also going to ask Shapell for 3.95 acres of 
land for wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
William D. Ross, an attorney for Shapell, said a major hurdle was cleared 
Wednesday. "Any time you get the board to vote on a project you have jumped a 
hurdle," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime project critic Cindy O'Neal, a member of the Laguna Niguel Community 
Council, reminded supervisors Wednesday of her many appearances complaining 
about the development. At times, she said, she was particularly upset because 
of the inaccuracies in the acreage figures of the project in the different 
documents controlling the size and density of Country Village. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the meeting, O'Neal, once among the most vocal opponents, 
said she dropped her three-year fight against the project because of two 
important concessions from the developer and a new spirit of "consensus 
planning" by both county officials and Shapell executives. "I hope consensus 
planning becomes the norm and not the exception," O'Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
She said Shapell dropped plans to build 144 apartments behind a Vons shopping 
center, instead designating the site as parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Also, she said, over the years the company has agreed to drop a total of 955 
units overall, which she said is beneficial in a community that has had 250% 
growth in the past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"I started fighting on this issue three years ago," she said. "For the last 2 
1/2 years I've devoted my life to it. I've been a little single-minded. But 
today, how do I feel? I feel like people can sit down and work out their 
differences. At times I wanted to give up out of sheer exhaustion, but I never 
did because I knew I was right and I was not prepared to give up." 
</P>
<P>
The Country Village project was the first large housing tract approved in 1987 
in Orange County under what is called a development agreement. The agreements 
are contracts in which the county agrees to freeze zoning and other land-use 
restrictions for specific developments, guaranteeing developers that they will 
be able to build in the future according to current plans. In return, the 
county gets the developer to build public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was investigated by the Orange County Grand Jury, which 
criticized the supervisors, saying the board had granted development rights 
without the land having been properly zoned. The supervisors stood firm on 
their earlier decision. 
</P>
<P>
Another group in Laguna Niguel filed suit alleging the county had breached its 
contract because promised roadwork was not being done on Alicia Parkway.

L.A. COUNTY UPS ANTE FOR TRAIN TERMINUS; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: SYLMAR ENHANCED IN COMPETITION WITH ANAHEIM TO BECOME THE 
SOUTHLAND LINK TO LAS VEGAS, CONNECTED BY A FUTURISTIC HIGH-SPEED RAIL LINE. 
</P>

<P>
Los Angeles County on Wednesday sweetened its offer in the competition with 
Anaheim to become the Southern California terminus of a futuristic high-speed 
rail system to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
To raise the chances of a northern San Fernando Valley terminus, the Los 
Angeles County Transportation Commission voted Wednesday to study speeding up 
construction of a light-rail line linking Los Angeles International Airport to 
Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials said that link would significantly increase 
ridership on a Sylmar-to-Las Vegas line because it would tie the high-speed 
system to the county's network of rail lines, three of which are under 
construction, with several more in the planning stage. 
</P>
<P>
The rival terminal station site is in Anaheim and is supported by officials 
from Orange and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
Ridership on the high-speed train has emerged as a key issue following release 
of a consultant's report two weeks ago that said an Anaheim-to-Las Vegas line, 
also stopping in Ontario, would draw 6.5 million round-trip passengers 
annually. A Sylmar-to-Las Vegas line, also stopping in Palmdale, would generate 
only 2.3 million round trips a year, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
However, a separate commuter system operating on the same tracks would draw 
nearly equal numbers of riders -- 433,000 round trips a year between Anaheim 
and Ontario versus 418,000 annually between Palmdale and Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
The California-Nevada Super Speed Ground Transportation Commission, created by 
the two states' legislatures, is to vote Friday on a Southern California 
terminus. 
</P>
<P>
But Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who heads the bistate commission, 
suggested late Wednesday that both Sylmar and Anaheim might survive Friday's 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that it was "conceivable the bistate commission might designate 
Anaheim as the terminus but leave open the possibility of getting there through 
Palmdale and LAX" by traveling through the San Fernando Valley and Westside on 
the San Diego Freeway right of way. 
</P>
<P>
Katz, who also chairs the Assembly Transportation Commission, agreed that the 
16-member bistate commission is leaning toward Anaheim but said "the final 
decision rests with the California Legislature, not the bistate commission." 
</P>
<P>
Although the $4-billion system would be built with private funds, legislative 
approval is needed because the trains would travel along the shoulder of 
interstate highways. 
</P>
<P>
Following the Transportation Commission vote to authorize $225,000 to study the 
LAX-to-Sylmar rail line, which hitherto was not scheduled to be built for a 
decade or more, Ray Remy, who represents Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley on the 
commission, expressed confidence that Los Angeles' bid for the high-speed line 
would not be voted down Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope and expect that what we will see is a decision to conduct further study 
on both proposals, especially in light of action taken here today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles International Airport is close to capacity and "must be relieved or 
we will face real serious problems," said Los Angeles City Council President 
John Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
In another development Wednesday, Palmdale officials released a report that 
conceded that a high-speed train passing through their desert city en route 
between Sylmar and Las Vegas would not generate the ridership of a route 
originating in Anaheim but said that the Sylmar line would be 45% less 
expensive to build. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a line traveling through Palmdale would have fewer environmental problems 
and could be built in less time than one traveling through San Bernardino and 
Orange counties, according to the report, which the city commissioned. 
</P>
<P>
The report projected 3.76 million round-trip riders annually on a Sylmar-to-Las 
Vegas line, about 50% higher than the bistate commission's consultant 
projected, but still much less than the predicted Anaheim ridership.

TURF SQUABBLE STIRRED ON EXPANDING LAFCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A turf battle among government agencies will come to a head next week when a 
vote will be held on a proposal to expand the agency, which rules on 
annexations and cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
Fast-growing South Orange County is particularly interested in the struggle 
because several of its communities are seeking cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would become harder for communities to become cities" under the 
proposed change, Dana Point Mayor Eileen Krause said. "And I can tell you it's 
already hard enough." 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the proposed expansion of the Orange County Local Agency Formation 
Commission (LAFCO) from five to seven members. The added two would represent 
independent agencies, such as water and sanitation districts. 
</P>
<P>
Most California counties have LAFCOs, agencies that are generally little known 
to the public but wield considerable power. They have the authority to approve 
or block votes on cityhood and control proposed municipal boundaries. The 
agencies also have authority over annexations and formation or dissolution of 
special districts. 
</P>
<P>
The existing LAFCO is made up of two county supervisors, representing the 
county; two city members, representing urban areas, and one member of the 
public at large. 
</P>
<P>
"We think independent agencies ought to be represented on LAFCO because it 
would be equitable and logical," said Ray Woodside, general manager of the 
Tri-Cities Municipal Water District in South Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Woodside, however, conceded that the expansion proposal has an uphill fight. 
"These things can be pretty political," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County cities are lining up in opposition, saying their power on LAFCO 
would be eroded. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO's staff has recommended the expansion, and 29 of the 38 independent 
agencies in the county are strongly pushing for representation. Most of the 
agencies in the county forced LAFCO with petitions to schedule a vote on the 
question, which is scheduled for Wednesday at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Special districts need representation, Woodside said. The new members would be 
"neutral," according to Woodside, and would not be anti-urban, as some county 
cities have predicted. 
</P>
<P>
But 13 of the county's 28 cities disagree with Woodside's argument. Thirteen 
cities have passed resolutions opposing the expansion. Garden Grove is in 
favor, and Irvine took a neutral position. 
</P>
<P>
Such solid municipal opposition leaves Wednesday's vote very much in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the special districts will have an uphill fight trying to get their 
two representatives," said Evelyn R. Hart, a Newport Beach councilwoman who is 
chairwoman of LAFCO. 
</P>
<P>
"I see this opposition from the cities, including the League of Cities, and it 
certainly tells me a message about how I should vote as one of the two 
representatives of the cities on LAFCO," Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
She is not persuaded by the independent districts' claim that they need 
representation on the LAFCO board. "The special districts are already 
represented because many city councilmen, myself included, also serve on 
special districts," Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
The LAFCO staff, in recommending expansion, said in a report that such new 
members could bring in "a new and unique perspective that could be valuable to 
the commission's deliberations." 
</P>
<P>
But Phillip R. Schwartze, president of the county division of the League of 
Cities, said he sees no reason to expand LAFCO. Schwartze is a San Juan 
Capistrano City Council member and a former member and chairman of LAFCO. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes no mathematical genius to see that cities wouldn't have as much 
representation if LAFCO is expanded from five to seven members," he said. "We 
see no reason for special districts needing to be on the board." 
</P>
<P>

MISSION VIEJO RECALL ELECTION FORCED BY SLIM MARGIN; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: A WELL-FINANCED DRIVE GOT ENOUGH PETITIONS SIGNED TO REQUIRE AN 
ELECTION IN AN EFFORT TO OUST COUNCILMAN ROBERT A. CURTIS.

<P>
After two days of uncertainty, foes of Mission Viejo City Councilman Robert A. 
Curtis on Wednesday narrowly won their battle to force a recall election. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased," Helen Monroe, chairwoman of the Coalition to Recall 
Councilman Curtis, said after the final tally of signatures on recall 
petitions. "We started out cold turkey on this, and now we're going to have a 
vote." 
</P>
<P>
But Curtis appeared confident that he will prevail in the recall election. 
</P>
<P>
"The final count clearly shows that they do not have popular support for the 
recall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The recall campaign features several of the county's most prominent developers 
in a well-organized and well-financed effort to unseat Curtis and promises to 
be a ferocious political battle. Already, observers agree that it could become 
the young city's most trying and divisive struggle since it was incorporated in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
The city clerk announced Wednesday afternoon that county officials finished 
their tally and had counted 7,960 valid signatures among the 12,001 signatures 
turned by recall proponents on Sept. 28. Proponents needed 7,770 signatures to 
qualify the issue for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the recall coalition anxiously had awaited results of the "second 
pass" through their petitions after city officials revealed Monday that the 
first screening had left them 477 signatures short of the required number. 
Preliminary totals from Tuesday's second count added several hundred 
signatures, many of which turned up only on the second check because residents 
had signed petitions using nicknames rather than their legal names. 
</P>
<P>
But even after the early results of the second pass, some petitions were 
discounted because they were distributed by circulators who had incorrectly 
completed affidavits. 
</P>
<P>
As final numbers were released Wednesday, it became clear how close the 
coalition had come to falling short. Of the 7,960 valid signatures, 154 to 160 
were distributed by circulators with invalid affidavits. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the victory for recall proponents came amid unconfirmed reports of 
forgery on some petitions. But regardless, both sides agreed that a recall 
election is virtually assured. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis claimed some signatures on the petitions were forged and said he would 
check those allegations. Mayor William S. Craycraft, who often supports Curtis 
and who contributed to the councilman's anti-recall campaign, said he too had 
heard reports of forged signatures but could not confirm them. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard that some signatures may have been forged, and I'm very concerned 
about that," Craycraft said. "But I don't have the authority to order an 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Monroe said she was unaware of any suspect signatures. "Obviously, we would not 
condone that in any way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some lingering questions about the petitions, the City Council is 
expected to move quickly to set a special election date. Craycraft and others 
predicted that the council will vote on the matter Nov. 13 and likely would 
schedule the election for late February or early March of next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I would look forward to putting this on our agenda and moving ahead as quickly 
as possible," Craycraft said.

CHAPMAN UPSETS NO. 1 RIVERSIDE

There were many times Wednesday night when the Chapman College women's 
volleyball team looked ready to fold. And that would have been understandable. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the Panthers are the fifth-ranked team in the nation according to the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division II poll. But on Wednesday, they 
were playing No. 1 UC Riverside -- a team that had lost only once all season 
and had won 11 consecutive matches. 
</P>
<P>
But when all was said and done, the Panthers looked more like No. 1 than No. 1 
did. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman withstood every challenge in the final two games to defeat Riverside, 
12-15, 15-2, 8-15, 15-10, 15-10, in a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
match in front of 300 spectators at Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
The victory left the Panthers (22-2 overall, 6-0 in CCAA play) alone in first 
place in the conference and should improve their national ranking. 
</P>
<P>
But more than that, it may have been a moment when Chapman's players realized 
how good they can be. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were able to hold off Riverside in Game 4, I think we started to 
believe in ourselves a little more," Chapman Coach Mary Cahill said. "I told 
the girls to be ready in the next game, because they were going to come after 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Riverside did, taking a 4-1 lead. The Highlanders were still in front, 6-4, 
when the Panthers made their move. 
</P>
<P>
"All I could think about was we had to play tough," said Chapman's Dana 
Beardsley, who had a game-high 25 kills. "We just had to hang on." 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers did. Rather tenuously at times, but they did hang on. 
</P>
<P>
Rena Strange made three blocks as Chapman took a 10-8 lead. Karen Burley then 
finished Riverside off with two blocks and a kill. 
</P>
<P>
"We are such a close team, that no one can keep us down," Beardsley said. "We 
kept telling each other that all through the match." 
</P>
<P>
After splitting the first two games, the Highlanders (15-2, 5-1) looked every 
bit the No. 1 team in Game 3. The Highlanders trailed, 8-5, but scored 10 
unanswered points behind the play of Sheri Benson, who had 22 kills in the 
match. 
</P>
<P>
But the Panthers held on in Game 4. They saw a 10-4 lead evaporate, but with 
the score tied 10-10, Debi Waller (15 kills) scored on a kill, then made two 
blocks to force a fifth game. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Riverside took us too seriously," Cahill said. "I don't mean 
that in a bad way. But they never saw us play, never scouted us. We saw them 
and knew what to expect. I think we got a little more respect tonight."

<P>
The Division II Panthers will play the Division I Tigers, led by Chris Jackson,

The owners of the Orange Coast Daily Pilot are negotiating to sell the daily 
newspaper to former Chicago Sun-Times publisher Robert E. Page, who is 
reportedly interested in building a string of community newspapers in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Cheyfitz, president of the publishing division of Adams Communications 
Corp., which purchased the Pilot last year from Ingersoll Publications Co., 
confirmed that the company was negotiating the paper's sale. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been having some talks with Bob Page, and we might be able to conclude 
a transaction in the near future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheyfitz emphasized that a sale was not yet certain, and said that no 
discussions had taken place with any other potential buyer despite the fact 
that Adams had received "no fewer than a dozen calls from people wanting to 
buy" the Pilot. 
</P>
<P>
Cheyfitz added that Page, who heads a Boston-based company called Page Media, 
was "in a unique position" to profit from ownership of the paper, but he 
declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Page, who was a publisher of the Boston Herald and the Chicago Sun-Times and 
led a management buyout of the Chicago paper from its former owner Rupert 
Murdoch in 1986, could not be reached for comment. He previously has expressed 
interest in acquiring community newspapers in California. 
</P>
<P>
A source who asked not to be identified said Page was also seeking to acquire 
the Glendale News-Press, which is owned by game-show impresario Mark Goodson 
and managed by Ingersoll under a contract whose termination was announced on 
Tuesday. News-Press publisher Judy Kendall declined all comment on the report. 
</P>
<P>
Goodson's newspaper operations are reportedly strapped for cash after the 
purchase of the Morristown Daily Record in New Jersey two years ago for $155 
million. Goodson announced Tuesday that he was selling the New Haven Register 
and terminating the longstanding agreement under which Ingersoll manages his 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Coast Daily Pilot, which primarily serves the Costa Mesa-Newport 
Beach area, has struggled with declining circulation and advertising revenue 
over the past decade, but Cheyfitz said a turnaround had begun since Adams 
purchased the paper. 
</P>
<P>
Circulation, which had dropped to 20,000 last year from 40,000 in 1982, has 
rebounded by about 3,000, Cheyfitz said. Display advertising and classified ad 
revenues were also up, Cheyfitz said, but he could not provide figures. 
</P>
<P>
The Pilot, which until 1983 was owned by Times Mirror Co., publisher of The 
Times, switched to morning publication earlier this year, and Cheyfitz said 
Adams was "really happy with the progress" that had been made since the 
acquisition. He noted that the weekly community newspaper operations that were 
purchased with the Pilot -- the Huntington Beach Independent and the Fountain 
Valley Independent -- were also doing very well. 
</P>
<P>
Adams has launched new "Independent" weeklies in Newport Beach and Costa Mesa 
and has won its battle with Baker Communications, which recently closed the 
weekly Newport Beach Ensign. 
</P>
<P>
Adams Communications, founded by soft-drink entrepreneur Stephen Adams in 1982, 
is based in the Minneapolis suburb of Wayzata and has holdings in radio, 
television, magazines and outdoor advertising, in addition to newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
When the Pilot was sold to Adams last year, the paper was reportedly losing 
money, and the purchase price was not disclosed. Cheyfitz said that if the sale 
to Page was completed, it would be for "significantly more" than the price 
Adams had paid. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Churchman, publisher of the Pilot, could not be reached for comment.

Supermarket ATMs: Five Stater Bros. markets have been chosen to test automated 
teller machines, including the store on Baker Street in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The machines, which will be located in well-lit areas in front of the 
supermarkets, are intended to provide more convenient service for customers, 
according to the Colton-based chain. "We feel the machines are a step to 
providing a convenient location for our customers to perform banking 
transactions," said Jack J. Brown, Stater Bros.' chairman, president and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
According to Stater Bros., the ATMs are able to handle transactions for more 
than 95% of all bank cards held by consumers in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The six-month pilot program is expected to begin by December. In addition to 
the Costa Mesa store, the test will be at stores in Grand Terrace, Rancho 
California, Pomona and Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
Stater Bros. has 101 stores, 15 of them in Orange County.

ILLINOIS TEACHERS' PENSION FUND BUYS COSTA MESA CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Illinois teachers' pension fund bought the Costa Mesa Courtyards shopping 
center at the corner of Harbor and Newport boulevards for $38.75 million, the 
center's manager said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The three-year-old shopping center was sold by BHI-Dover, a Newport Beach 
concern which buys and manages shopping centers. The company will stay on to 
manage the center. 
</P>
<P>
While other pension funds -- including the California teachers' fund -- have 
made some large purchases in Orange County, this is thought to be the first 
large purchase in the county by the Teachers' Retirement System of the State of 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many shopping centers of similar size, Courtyards has no single large 
anchor tenant like a supermarket or department store. The land there was so 
expensive that developers didn't want to give over so much of it to one large 
retailer, according to Harold Hofer of BHI-Dover. The developers thought they 
could make more money at the busy street corner by building a larger number of 
smaller shops. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Health Club Biggest Tenant 
</P>
<P>
So far that strategy appears to have worked. About 95% of the center's 171,000 
square feet is leased, BHI-Dover said. 
</P>
<P>
The largest tenant is a health club, with 37,000 square feet, and the 
next-largest stores are a drugstore and home furnishings shop, each with 9,000 
square feet. A record store, a computer software store and a clothing store are 
among the other tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The original developer was Pacific Savings Bank, which began construction in 
1985 but sold the new center a year later, before the problem-ridden thrift was 
seized by federal regulators. The thrift has its headquarters across the street 
in the same Spanish architectural style as the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Pension funds once bought only what the real estate industry calls "trophy" 
buildings, office towers in big cities and enormous regional malls. 
</P>
<P>
But as competition intensifies for those buildings, the pension funds, 
insurance companies and foreign investors are looking farther afield. 
</P>
<P>
BHI-Dover is a joint venture of two Newport Beach concerns, Bonutto Hofer 
Investments and Dover Investment Properties. BHI-Dover owns about 20 smaller 
shopping centers, most in the Los Angeles area. The largest is a 
275,000-square-foot center in Upland.

STOCK TAKES DIVE AS COMP CARE LOSES $4.7 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
MERGER: THE QUARTERLY LOSS AND THE MARKET TAILSPIN MAY DOOM THE PLANNED 
CONSOLIDATION WITH FIRST HOSPITAL, ANALYSTS SAY.

<P>
Comprehensive Care, the nation's largest alcohol- and drug-treatment company, 
reported a $4.7-million loss Wednesday for its fiscal first quarter, sending 
the beleaguered company's stock price into a tailspin and endangering a 
critical merger. 
</P>
<P>
The company also revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission that it cannot stay in business unless it completes the merger with 
First Hospital Corp. of Norfolk, Va., or obtains an extension on its sizable 
debt obligations. 
</P>
<P>
"The continuation of (Comp Care) is dependent upon either the completion of a 
reorganization or resolution of short-term operating and liquidity problems," 
the company said in the SEC filing. 
</P>
<P>
Comp Care's announcement sent its stock falling 57% from $8.375 to just $3.625 
during extremely heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.17 
million shares of Comp Care's 10.2 million shares changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess time will tell whether the people who took their action today were 
panicky or emotional . . . or smart," said Robert C. Viso Jr., chief financial 
officer of First Hospital Corp. in Norfolk, Va." 
</P>
<P>
In its financial report, the company said revenue during the first quarter 
ended Aug. 31 fell 17% from $53 million to $44 million. Its $4.7-million loss 
contrasts with a $1.6-million profit in the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The company also said it does not have enough cash to meet its debt 
obligations. And stock market analysts said the planned merger with First 
Hospital now is uncertain because of Comp Care's deteriorating financial 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
Because the merger with First Hospital has hit some snags, Comp Care -- which 
is best known for its CareUnit treatment facilities -- is desperately trying to 
negotiate an extension of its $23 million in bank debt, which was due Oct. 18. 
</P>
<P>
"The deal with First Hospital is dead in the eyes of most arbitragers," said 
Margo Vignola, analyst with Salomon Bros., the New York investment banker. "If 
the deal doesn't happen and the banks get nasty, we're talking about a very 
precarious situation." 
</P>
<P>
Comp Care has scheduled a board of directors meeting Tuesday in the event the 
merger is canceled. The company has several options, including trying to take 
itself private, agreeing to a takeover at fire-sale prices or filing for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors, according to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
But First Hospital officials said Wednesday that they plan to go ahead with the 
takeover. Today, a key First Hospital financier is expected to decide whether 
it will support the merger. 
</P>
<P>
"We have every intention of trying to merge with them," said Viso. "We are 
committed to the transaction." 
</P>
<P>
If the deal does go through, some analysts said it will be at a lower price 
than what was recently negotiated -- $3 a share in cash plus notes and shares 
of First Hospital stock. 
</P>
<P>
Comp Care officials refused all comment, and Viso would not speculate about his 
company's future plans. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1969, Comp Care has suffered recently as fewer and fewer people use 
its facilities because of increased competition and changing attitudes about 
alcohol and drug use. Meanwhile, those people who do check in to Comp Care 
facilities aren't staying as long as they once did, largely because of stricter 
insurance requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The average occupancy rate for the company's free-standing facilities has 
continued to plummet in recent months. For instance, the occupancy rate was 62% 
during the first quarter of fiscal 1989 but was only 46% in the same period 
this year. And since then, it has dropped to 38%. 
</P>
<P>
Comp Care was once the industry's trend-setter and attracted such noteworthy 
patients as former Los Angeles Dodger pitcher Steve Howe. 
</P>
<P>
Several analysts said Wednesday that some members of Comp Care's management 
appear to have given up on the company. Chairman B. Lee Karns is rarely seen in 
the office nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems like there is lack of pressure on making things work right," said 
Jeffrey Kilpatrick, president of Newport Securities Corp. in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"The management has let the company drift during this period," said Vignola. 
"And that's a kind word -- drift. I don't think they have been minding the 
store." 
</P>

REDKEN SUBSIDIARY OFFERS HAIR PRODUCTS WITH GLACIER WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There seems to be something about the grandeur of glaciers that makes 
entrepreneurs think big. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, a Saudi Arabian prince proposed hauling glaciers and 
icebergs to drought-ravaged countries in the Middle East. Nothing happened with 
that idea. More recently a couple of companies have begun bottling and selling 
melted glacier water, touting the freshness and purity of the water to the 
Perrier generation. Another firm ships plastic bags of glacier ice cubes to 
Japan and makes vodka using glacier water. 
</P>
<P>
And now Redken Laboratories, the big Canoga Park hair care products company, is 
bankrolling a fledgling company called Alaska Glacier Products that sells a 
line of shampoos and hair conditioners containing none other than Alaskan 
glacier water. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Glacier vice president Neil Wallach said, "Glacial water is the freshest 
water on the planet," and so is ideal for shampoos and the like since it 
doesn't junk up the hair with chemicals and minerals found in other water. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics could say the only thing fresh about glacier water in shampoos is the 
gimmick. But then John Sebastian, president of the Woodland Hills-based hair 
care company Sebastian International, says gimmicks are what make or break hair 
care companies. "Everyone is going to have what is called in the industry a 
'hook' or a 'handle' -- something that's going to make their products much more 
appealing than other products." 
</P>
<P>
In the fiercely competitive $4.5-billion a year hair care products industry, 
shampoo peddlers use anything they can to to distinguish themselves, as 
companies vie for customers who are as loyal to shampoos as they are to this 
year's fashions. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Glacier's new line of products, called Glacial Fresh, has been available 
in beauty supply shops since June and Wallach expects the company to break even 
or turn a small profit in the fiscal year that ends July 31, on sales of about 
$1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
But is being different enough to make it in the hair care business? 
</P>
<P>
At Art Spector Beauty and Barber Supply in Sepulveda, there are dozens of 
exotic products available. "Everyone has a gimmick," said co-owner Marilyn 
Spector, who isn't carrying the Glacial Fresh line. "One has papaya from New 
Zealand. One has molecular or nucleic protein. There's lots of new ones that 
come out and very few of them make it." 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Abramovitz, manager of Sunshine Beauty Supply in Canoga Park, is carrying 
Glacial Fresh, but says the new line hasn't sold well yet. She keeps a close 
eye on this sort of thing and if a product doesn't sell, she puts something 
else on the shelf. "I rotate, rotate, rotate," she said. Some shampoos she 
sells contain concoctions such as "golden seal root," "a botanically fortified 
polymeric acid balanced pH3 keratin enhancer" and a "Belgian formula." 
</P>
<P>
Sunshine was among the first of the 800 beauty supply stores that handle 
Glacial Fresh, but Abramovitz believes a new series of advertisements in People 
magazine will help boost sales. "Advertising is the key," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Glacier's ad budget isn't setting Madison Avenue on fire. So far it has 
spent about $50,000 on trade ads and $100,000 on consumer ads, Wallach said. 
That's not much compared to the multimillion-dollar ad budgets of the large 
hair care companies. 
</P>
<P>
But then Alaska Glacier is something of a marketing departure for Redken 
Laboratories, which has more than $120 million in annual sales, and is the 
largest manufacturer and distributor of hair care products sold in beauty 
salons. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Redken has zealously cultivated its status as a supplier of upscale 
products sold only in hair salons. But Alaska Glacier will be sold only through 
beauty supply stores -- another fast-growing segment of the hair care market 
that sells to the public and to professional hair stylists. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Geller, a consultant specializing in cosmetics and toiletries at the 
market research firm Kline &amp; Co. in Fairfield, N.J., says this could be a 
risky move for Redken. "If they're not careful about merchandising the two 
lines separately, they run the danger of denigrating their history with the 
salon." Redken's name, though, doesn't appear on the boxes of Glacier Fresh, 
and Alaska Glacier stresses that Redken's other products are still marketed 
solely to salons. 
</P>
<P>
There are now about 7,000 beauty supply shops in the United States and they 
sell anything from the cheap drugstore brands to the pricey salon products. At 
$4.99 for each nine-ounce bottle, the Glacial Fresh line is far from the most 
expensive of hair care products on the market, but it's not bargain-basement 
either. 
</P>
<P>
"In the overall scheme of things, it's a relatively expensive product line," 
Wallach said. But he hopes to cash in on the increasing focus on the 
environment, and maintained that the products will have strong appeal to 
consumers who eschew man-made chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Redken, which was taken private last year in a leveraged buyout by founder 
Paula Kent Meehan and her husband John E. Meehan, won't divulge the size of its 
investment in Alaska Glacier. But the new company's offices are located at 
Redken's Canoga Park headquarters and its products are formulated and 
manufactured by Redken. And there's more than just glacier water; the shampoo 
also contains juniper, heather, mistletoe and flaxseed to underscore the 
natural theme. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Glacier is the brainchild of Rick Thornton, an Anchorage hair care 
products distributor and glacier buff. About two years ago, Thornton, who 
describes himself as "a country boy from Alaska," heard about Wetco, an 
Anchorage company that was selling two-pound bags of glacier ice cubes in Japan 
for $7. "That struck a chord in me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska's glaciers are scattered over thousands of miles of pristine wilderness, 
and Thornton thought that if he could combine his hair care business with the 
appeal of the glaciers he'd have a unique product. "I wanted to have a story 
that no one else has," he said.

NEW MAGAZINE FOR BLACKS TAKES ON BIG COMPETITORS;

PUBLISHING: BLACK JOURNALISTS WRITING ON BLACK ISSUES FOR BLACK READERS IS THE

<P>
If you admire someone who doesn't run from fights, no matter how big of the 
opponent, then you have to like Wilmer C. Ames Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Ames is the founder and publisher of Emerge magazine, whose inaugural issue has 
hit the newsstands. 
</P>
<P>
Emerge is aimed at the burgeoning black middle class, a group seemingly already 
served by stalwart publications like Ebony, Jet, Essence and Black Enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
But Ames, who has set the rather modest circulation goal of 150,000 (compared 
with Ebony's 1.8 million, Essence's 850,000 and Black Enterprise's 230,000), 
believes there is more than enough room on the block for his magazine to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm segmenting the black audience into 150,000 black readers who want a 
serious sort of issues-oriented magazine," Ames said during a recent visit 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see anybody who subscribes to my magazine having to cancel a 
subscription to any of the other black magazines. I hope that I complement 
those magazines, and I hope that makes us successful." 
</P>
<P>
Ames, a former reporter for Sports Illustrated and Time, says that Emerge -- 
whose initial issue contains a profile on "60 Minutes" correspondent Ed 
Bradley, a piece on whether blacks are better athletes and if it really 
matters, and an analysis of the increase of white musical artists on the black 
music charts -- will be "somewhere between Time and Newsweek and a Vanity 
Fair," and a place where black intellectuals can express themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"What I say to my staff every day . . . is our goal is not just to go out and 
hire the Maya Angelous to write for us. They've already reached their success. 
Our goal is to go out and find the young, talented black people who are a 
little frustrated because they have something to say and no place to say it. 
That's what we look for. That's our mission," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are really some powerful black intellectuals and thinkers and writers 
around the country. No one has provided them with one outlet where all of their 
voices could be brought together and heard and read. That's part of the 
definition in our slogan, 'Our Voice in Today's World.' " 
</P>
<P>
Emerge's voice was almost permanently stilled early in the process of getting 
the magazine started. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine was initially planned to appear last September, but financing fell 
through a month before publication. Ames owed creditors $850,000 and his 
attorneys suggested that he file for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he delayed publication long enough to get financing from a variety of 
sources, including Black Entertainment Television and his former bosses at 
Time-Warner Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Ames has vowed to keep the financiers away from editorial decisions. He waited 
until close to the publication date before sending them a prototype of the 
magazine, just so they would have an idea about what was being printed without 
having time to try to influence it. 
</P>
<P>
"My premise has always been that Emerge magazine has to be an independent 
venture from any of its backers. I'm trying to deliver a journalistically sound 
product, and you can't have that if I have to leave an editorial meeting and I 
have to call the backers or have a meeting and tell them, 'This is what we're 
planning to put in the magazine. Is this agreeable to you or is it offensive to 
your friends?' " Ames explained. 
</P>
<P>
"There's none of that here. There's a little jibe at Time Inc. in one of those 
stories, which didn't come from me. It came from an independent, unbiased 
writer, and that is not going to be edited out of this magazine just because 
Time is a backer. We'll get what the writer has to say."

Beneath the moonlight, as she slowly emerges from the sea, a loggerhead turtle 
cuts a mysterious figure on the foaming shoreline. On steamy summer nights from 
Virginia to Texas, thousands of these puzzling creatures are poking their 
scaly, barnacled shells out of the surf. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks a little like an invasion of tiny army tanks," says Larry Woods, 
curator of the Juno Beach Turtle Museum here. He is on the beach at 7 each 
morning to make sure the nocturnal turtle visits have gone smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
Digging their flippers in the sand, the loggerheads inch their 300-pound bodies 
across the beach to deposit some 100 leathery eggs the size of Ping-Pong balls 
in three-foot sand pits -- their gift to the future. It is the only reason a 
turtle comes out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
But not all is well with the turtle, Woods is quick to point out. Sea turtles 
have rapidly become an endangered species. From the Caribbean to the Atlantic, 
and from the Mediterranean to the Pacific, whole populations of these giant 
reptiles are disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
It is a story of accident and exploitation, a clash with people -- and a 
phenomenally fast fall for a species as old as the dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
Sea turtles are most at risk during the summer, when they swim ashore to nest. 
They get tangled in fishing nets and become easy prey for hunters. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, the world's oceans were brimming with turtles. Centuries ago, 
ships' logs said the Caribbean was so full of them one could be guided toward 
an island by the clacking of their shells knocking together. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this century, "you couldn't row a boat in front of nesting beaches," 
says Jim Richardson, a turtle expert at the University of Georgia. "Turtles 
would kick the oars out of the oarlocks." 
</P>
<P>
No one knows exactly how many sea turtles exist today because they are sea 
travelers. But on Mexico's Rancho Nuevo beach, where 40,000 Kemp's ridley 
turtles nested en masse on a single day in the 1940s, just 400 or 500 nest 
today. South Carolina's barrier islands have registered an alarming 26% decline 
in loggerheads nesting just in this decade, says Sally Murphy, the state's 
chief turtle biologist. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia's Cumberland Island National Seashore, nesting beach for 150 turtles 25 
years ago, gets about 20 nesters a year now, Richardson says. 
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia and Malaysia, hunters who once found their shores flush with 
quarry must head out to sea. In the Maldives and Cayman Islands, wild turtles 
have vanished. 
</P>
<P>
Recent efforts in the United States to rescue the sea turtle have spawned 
perhaps the biggest wildlife debate since the 1978 brawl over the snail darter 
and Tennessee's Tellico Dam. 
</P>
<P>
The major turtle killer in U.S. waters is the net of shrimp fisherman, 
according to environmentalists. After years of pitched debate between them and 
the shrimp industry, Congress bought the environmental argument and ordered 
shrimpers to put "turtle excluder devices" in their trawling nets. Legislators 
say that could save 12,000 turtles a year. 
</P>
<P>
The regulation took effect May 1. But after wide civil disobedience by shrimp 
fishers, it was scrapped, at least temporarily. Atlantic fishermen on the whole 
complied with the regulation, but thousands of fishermen in the Gulf of Mexico 
are fighting it tooth and nail. 
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, the chief threat to the turtle is international trade. Sometimes 
legally, but often not, African, Asian, and Caribbean turtle hunters supply 
Asia's huge appetite for turtle-shell jewelry and turtle leather accessories. 
The eating of turtle eggs and meat has helped deplete populations too. 
</P>
<P>
"The sea turtle," says Michael Weber of the Center for Marine Conservation, "is 
probably the most salable animal in the world. All its parts can be sold for 
meat, soup or shell." 
</P>
<P>
Japan is reportedly ending its stuffed-turtle trade, and there are some 
treaties and laws intended to help endangered animals. But so far, there has 
been little success enforcing the measures. 
</P>
<P>
The Endangered Species Act, the prime U.S. animal protection tool, "is strong 
on paper," says Michael Bean, chairman of the Environmental Defense Fund's 
animal protection program. "The problems are with the willingness of the 
agencies responsible for implementing the legislation to use their authority 
effectively." 
</P>
<P>
Regulations were enforced in the Gulf only about two of the 11 weeks they were 
in effect. Commerce Department spokesmen say suspension of the rule leaves time 
to develop a program that is enforceable. Environmental groups are concerned 
that the suspension is a precedent and "punches a hole in the Endangered 
Species Act for all wildlife," says Steve Moyer, a lobbyist for the National 
Wildlife Federation. 
</P>
<P>
The chief international means for preserving turtles is the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species, signed by 100 countries to limit 
trade in endangered plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
The record on compliance is not good. Indonesia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Panama, 
Belize, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Tanzania and Kenya are engaging in 
large-scale turtle selling. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Canin, a biologist with Greenpeace, and other ecologists are especially 
worried about Mexico and Indonesia, perhaps the world's two most important 
turtle-nesting countries. Both have regulations governing wildlife but 
reportedly are sliding backward on actual protection. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists acknowledge that it is difficult to tell Third World 
countries that they should restrict turtle hunting. Turtles are a cheap, local 
source of food; one animal can provide a poor family's major source of income 
in a year. But ecologists insist that nations must learn to take fewer eggs and 
turtles today if they are to have any turtle supply in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Seven turtle species still roam the seas. They range from the half-ton, 
jellyfish-eating leatherbacks, which explore earth's colder oceans, to the 
80-pound Kemp's ridleys, which stick mostly to the warm Caribbean.

POP BEAT: HALLOWEEN A YEARLY TREAT FOR OINGO BOINGO IN O.C.; 
</P>
<P>
PREVIEW: AS ALWAYS, IRVINE MEADOWS WILL BE PACKED FOR THE LOS ANGELES-BASED 
BAND'S ANNUAL APPEARANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Just as Halloween is a time for kids to indulge their fantasies and become 
Presidents, Transformer robots and such, so it is that the reasonably 
successful members of Oingo Boingo get to become megastars for a brief span 
each witching season. The long-lived Los Angeles-based group rarely hits the 
charts and typically plays mid-size concert halls even in its home town, yet 
many more-famous acts would be hard pressed to sell the 30,000 seats Boingo has 
for this year's annual two-night Halloween bash at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah, it's personally my favorite holiday of the year," said Boingo bassist 
John Avila. "I think we are one of the perfect Halloween bands, and Irvine is 
the biggest night of the year for us." 
</P>
<P>
While he largely credits the sold-out shows Friday and Saturday to the group's 
years of building up a county following, Avila said the Halloween lure of 
Boingo's comically macabre dance music isn't limited to the local geography. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County has always been a big Boingo area, but we've found that a lot of 
people come from out of town. It's become a real tradition. In San Francisco we 
had people telling us, 'We'll see you in Irvine.' We just heard the same thing 
in Salt Lake City, 'See you in Irvine. We're flying in for that show.' " 
</P>
<P>
If the shift between the band's everyday level of success and the Olympian 
status bestowed on it yearly at Halloween weren't enough, Avila and drummer 
Johnny (Vatos) Hernandez have yet another identity to contend with. Along with 
non-Boingo guitarist Michael Tovar, the pair make up Food for Feet, a band that 
has been causing its own ruckus this year on the Southland club scene. The 
group's self-titled EP, released recently on Orange County's Dr. Dream Records, 
has been garnering airplay on KROQ and more than 100 other stations nationwide. 
The trio will appear on Nov. 9 at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old bassist describes Food for Feet's music as "very aggressive, 
loud and hard. You'll hear influences from all different parts of the world: 
King Sunny Ade would be the main one on the African side, and there are Latin 
influences too, along with the obvious love for rock. And it is music for feet. 
Food for Feet is really what the music is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Tovar has worked with performers from Otis Blackwell (composer of 
several Elvis hits) to the German progressive band Triumvirat. Avila's credits 
include work with that band and with East-L.A.'s El Chicano, while Hernandez's 
pre-Boingo credits range from be-bop jazz to Helen Reddy. 
</P>
<P>
Although Boingo front-man Danny Elfman's busy schedule scoring films (his 
recent work includes "Batman," "Midnight Run" and "Scrooged" and he is 
presently scoring a Clive Barker film) has allowed Avila and Hernandez the time 
to get Food for Feet moving this year, it is far from a new band. 
</P>
<P>
"Johnny, Michael and I have known each other from way before Boingo, from when 
we were all growing up in San Gabriel. The three of us all liked to get 
together to play, and we started out jamming in each other's garages. We 
started working as a group in 1983, playing underground clubs on the eastside 
and Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
Along with Elfman's recent film projects allowing them more time, Avila also 
feels 1989 was fated to be Food for Feet's year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in the first two years we played as a band, we made $85 each, total, 
and we're talking about some 50 gigs to make that amount. The way we looked at 
it, we were playing for free. That was the exciting part, the attitude of 'If 
you're not going to pay us anything, then we're going to play anything we 
want.' 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, when we'd be packing up to leave a club at 2:30 in the morning, 
our little joke was to always say, 'Well, it could be a hit in '89.' 'How much 
money did we make? $5? Well, it could still be a hit in '89.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then '89 actually comes around. The band had gotten a lot more focused, and 
was sounding a lot better. We'd played almost a whole decade, and we thought it 
was finally time to document it. That became the EP." 
</P>
<P>
Avila doesn't feel that Oingo Boingo's Orange County popularity had any bearing 
on Food for Feet signing with a county label. 
</P>
<P>
Avila admits that his and Hernandez's being in both groups has caused some 
confusion. "Because we're doing Food for Feet there's this rumor that Boingo is 
breaking up, and that couldn't be further from the truth. Both bands are alive 
and well." 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen how alive and well Avila and Hernandez will be after this 
coming year, when both band's schedules promise to heat up. Boingo has an album 
due out early next year (new songs "Lights Go Out," "Peel Away the Skin" and 
"Breakdown" will probably be featured in this weekend's shows) and is planning 
video projects and a large tour to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Oingo Boingo will play Friday and Saturday at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, 
8800 Irvine Center Drive, Irvine. Friday's show is sold out. Lawn seating for 
Saturday's performance (at 8 p.m.) is still available for $19.50. Parking: $5. 
Information: (714) 855-6111.

JOSEPH N. BELL: HE'S AN ODDS-ON FAVORITE TO NEVER WIN LOTTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I gamble whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
In high school in Ft. Wayne, Ind., poker was our favorite pastime after sports 
and girls. In flight training, I used to bet with the guy sitting next to me in 
chapel whether the next hymn would be an odd or even number. In college, my 
roommate and I ran a football card operation briefly -- until two men wearing 
snap brim hats pulled up in front of our rooming house in a black sedan and 
suggested we cease and desist or we might get our legs broken. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the most fortuitous thing that has happened to me in recent years is 
the escalating air fare to Las Vegas that has limited my trips there to two or 
three a year. 
</P>
<P>
With a weakness like this, it would seem to follow that I am sorely tempted to 
put the mortgage money at risk by plunging it into the California Lottery. 
</P>
<P>
But actually I'm not tempted. I seldom play the lottery -- and never the Lotto 
game -- and don't read those periodic newspaper stories about the janitor in 
Garden Grove or the waitress in Anaheim who won $50 million or some such 
staggering sum by correctly guessing six random numbers. I demand two things 
when I gamble: a game that requires some small element of skill and a game in 
which the odds give me at least a fighting chance of winning. Since neither of 
these conditions prevail in the California Lottery, I don't play it. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't stop me from being fascinated by the psychological 
manipulation that goes on to pull more players into the game. And the most 
recent ploy has puzzled as much as it has intrigued me. I'm talking about the 
decision on the part of the people who run the California Lottery to increase 
the bank of numbers to be drawn from their Lotto game. This has the 
simultaneous effect of reducing even further the almost astronomical odds 
against the players while increasing the jackpot prize because it won't be 
claimed as often. 
</P>
<P>
From my perspective, it would seem that the best way to increase the number of 
players would be to shrink the bank of numbers and divide the prize pool into 
smaller but much more numerous prizes, thus materially increasing the chance of 
winning. But the people who buy Lotto tickets apparently don't think that way. 
And sales figures strongly support this assumption. 
</P>
<P>
When the Lotto jackpot hit $55 million recently, two men brought four $5,000 
cashier's checks into a liquor store and spent the whole day punching 20,000 
tickets. They lost. Ticket retailers in Orange County reported that sales were 
from five to 15 times the normal amount because of the record jackpot. 
Thousands of workers went without lunch to stand in line and buy tickets. One 
of them was quoted in The Times saying: "Where can you go in this world and 
possibly come away with $50 million. This might be my lucky day." 
</P>
<P>
The odds are about 14 million to 1 that it won't. 
</P>
<P>
The question that baffles me is: Why is it that when the Lotto odds go up, the 
number of players increases? And in our society today, when such a question 
arises, you go to a shrink. So I did. 
</P>
<P>
I asked this question of Dr. Edward R. Kaufman, a practicing psychiatrist in 
Orange County and professor of psychiatry at the UCI Medical School who 
specializes in addictive behavior. Kaufman points out, first of all, that 
people addicted to gambling are usually addicted to other things as well -- and 
that this addictive behavior probably doesn't apply to most of the people who 
buy lottery and Lotto tickets each month. 
</P>
<P>
"The average lottery player," he said, "is probably relatively poor and hoping 
to pull down the big money. The small bettor figures, 'What the hell, it's only 
a buck.' So he gives them his buck or two or three 52 times a year. He doesn't 
look at the odds. To him, the size of the jackpot is all that's important. 
</P>
<P>
"People like that, you offer to bet them 10,000 to 1 for a million dollars and 
2 to 1 for five bucks, they'll take the long odds every time. How else can they 
get rich? Their fantasy is 50 million bucks, not $500." 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman didn't, however, preclude real gamblers from going for the big Lotto 
killing. He said that the man who bought 20,000 tickets "sounds like a true 
compulsive gambler, out of control." And he described a patient who, after 
prolonged treatment, "has given up all his compulsions -- drugs, drinking, even 
his weekly poker game. But the one thing he hasn't given up is the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
"He thinks he has control. The compulsion is dormant but he satisfies it for 
the moment with the lottery. But once he allows this kind of thinking, there's 
a great danger he'll be headed right back where he was. Gamblers gamble for the 
high and for the fantasy. And most people look at the big money and not at the 
odds. This is part of the self-destructiveness of gamblers." 
</P>
<P>
Now don't get me wrong. I have no objection to winning $50 million. It would 
probably blight my life, but I'm willing to give it a shot. It's one of those 
life conundrums that I'd be perfectly willing to risk. But even for a buck, I 
can't bring myself to think this way. It isn't that I could put the buck to 
better use someplace else; that's not why I'm holding back. It's just that I 
react badly to scams, and 14-million-to-1 odds is a colossal scam. 
</P>
<P>
So I'll play blackjack in Vegas and pick a few football point spreads here and 
there and play poker whenever anyone invites me -- as long as they don't play 
one-eyed jacks and red queens wild. I'll never make $50 million that way, but 
I'll also never have to go to sleep at night trying to remember a half-dozen 
sets of numbers that aren't going to win anyway.

HIS POETRY PAYS TRIBUTE TO SOLDIERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hung Cuong, who has always kept a pen and paper handy, has written poems under 
the pen name of Nhat Quoc Tam. Like the songs he sings, his poetry is laced 
with patriotic tributes to soldiers, refugees and the people of his beloved 
South Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
To him, the South Vietnamese people are the innocents; communism, the beast. 
Many receive his praise, like former Gen. William Westmoreland, and hardly 
anyone escapes his barbs, especially Jane Fonda. He accused the Oscar-winning 
actress of spreading the "Stalin virus" during her controversial trip to Hanoi 
in 1972. He wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 How can you kiss men who the day before killed innocent people and set on fire 
so many innocent villages? 
</P>
<P>
 All of you have helped build another Berlin wall, and it is a tribute, a 
monument for the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 You betrayed 50,000 American soldiers who have sacrificed themselves for 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of his poems are nostalgic reminders of how South Vietnam was before the 
surrender to the North Vietnamese in 1975. Some recall the old path home and 
tell of walking down a sodden path near where the river turns into the village, 
and of happy children riding water buffalo that feed near the bamboo-edged 
river banks. 
</P>
<P>
Others pay homage to refugees who fled Vietnam by boat or land and now find 
themselves stuck in a refugee camp with their futures in limbo. For example, 
"In the Refugee Camps" reads: 
</P>
<P>
 Are the people here refugees or prisoners? 
</P>
<P>
 Young children . . . roam aimlessly, crying out pitifully from the depths of 
their souls. 
</P>
<P>
 A child tells of his mother's and sister's death because cruel and heartless 
pirates raped and tortured them. 
</P>
<P>
 But there will always be Vietnamese people ready and willing to sacrifice 
themselves once more for our country and heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 For Cuong, old soldiers never die. The battle against Communism is not over, 
which is his premise for the song, "Sound of the Battle Zone": 
</P>
<P>
 Let me go back to my homeland 
</P>
<P>
 So I can hear the crying voices of my people 
</P>
<P>
 Let me go back to the war zones 
</P>
<P>
 To visit the freedom fighters who are fighting to save my country 
</P>
<P>
 They have been fighting for 10 years, and now is the time for all the 
Vietnamese people to come together and free their Motherland from the clutches 
of Communism 
</P>
<P>
 Let me go back and wake up the people who are still asleep 
</P>
<P>
 And have forgotten their homeland is in turmoil.

ASK THE VET: FEVERISH CAT MAY SUFFER VIRAL INFECTION 
</P>

Q. In the past three months, our 2-year-old male cat has had frequent episodes 
of fever during which he stops eating for one to three days, is listless and 
seeks places to hide. He later snaps out of it and starts to act normal again, 
playing and eating well. We had him vaccinated about six months ago when we had 
him neutered. Could the surgery have caused some sort of problem to develop? We 
had him examined one time, and the vet started him on some antibiotics and 
Nutracal, which seemed to help him quite a bit. What could be the cause? He's 
the only cat that we have and is fed Crave dry food and a variety of canned 
foods. What do you think? 
</P>
<P>
Jenny Gilbert, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
A. Frequent or reoccurring fever episodes are generally associated with viral 
infections or chronic diseases. To determine if your cat really has a fever, 
you need to use a child's rectal thermometer and take your cat's temperature 
rectally. The normal range is usually between 101 and 102.5 degrees, depending 
on the age and activity of the cat. If your cat is truly running increased 
temperatures and they are frequent, it is wise to have him examined by your vet 
again. The doctor will probably take a blood sample to do a Complete Blood 
Count (CBC) and a chemical profile to evaluate organ functions. The cat should 
definitely be tested for leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunosuppressive virus 
(FIV) and feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). 
</P>
<P>
The examination should also include a urinalysis to help determine if your cat 
is suffering from urinary disease. If the CBC is markedly abnormal and 
indicates a bacterial infection -- and no other causes can be determined -- a 
series of blood cultures may be necessary. Antibiotics may be given for several 
weeks, and follow-up examinations and tests may be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Do not give your cat any aspirin or Tylenol-like products. They can be very 
toxic and possibly fatal. I doubt that the surgery would be the cause for such 
persistent episodes but do have your kitty examined. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Regarding the cat with continuing diarrhea, our Siamese started having this 
trouble about a year ago. After much veterinary study, it was found that she 
was (or became) allergic to milk (when in the food). When we cut out all food 
with dried milk products, the diarrhea stopped. She's about 12 years old, and 
we found that this is possible in older animals. 
</P>
<P>
Now, what do you do with a cat that has a hairball in the stomach? Lots of 
Laxatone isn't working. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Glunt, Los Alamitos 
</P>
<P>
A. It is true that milk or milk products will cause soft stools to fluid 
diarrhea in most dogs and cats. This is because they do not have sufficient 
enzymes in their digestive systems to break down the milk proteins. These 
undigested products will start to draw fluid from the intestinal tract and 
cause diarrhea. Also the proteins can induce allergic conditions, which can 
upset the digestive tract and prevent absorption of the other nutrients, 
leading to diarrhea. This is true for kittens and puppies as well as adult 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
If your cat does have a hairball lodged in the stomach that she cannot pass, it 
may be necessary to anesthetize her and have her stomach examined with an 
endoscope to identify the problem. The hair might have to be removed in 
fragments with an instrument passed in the scope. If it is too large to remove 
this way, abdominal surgery will be necessary to open the stomach and remove 
the obstruction. Radiographs (X-rays) should be taken before any of the 
procedures are done to determine if they are necessary.

Psychologists were called to Fairfax High School today to help students and 
faculty deal with the death of a 17-year-old youth who fatally shot himself in 
a school restroom in front of two fellow students on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Poindexter, an 11th grader in his first year at Fairfax, was pronounced 
dead several hours after he shot himself about 9 a.m. He apparently had been 
suffering from depression. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses saw Poindexter bring a handgun to school. Some students reportedly 
knew the youth was considering suicide but did not warn teachers, said 
Principal Warren Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg said the two students who witnessed the shooting were not 
acquaintances of Poindexter. Classes were not otherwise interrupted at the 
2,100-student campus west of downtown Los Angeles.

Aid to Poland and Hungary will be delayed and perhaps killed by a Republican 
attempt to inject capital gains tax reductions into the aid debate, Senate 
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the capital gains issue has nothing to do with aid to Eastern 
Europe," the Maine Democrat told the Senate. "Obviously the only effect can be 
to delay and perhaps kill aid to Poland and Hungary." 
</P>
<P>
He called the GOP's decision to inject capital gains into the aid debate one of 
a series of "unwise and almost baffling" steps that President Bush and the 
Republicans have taken.

Charles Ng, wanted in California to face 13 murder charges in a string of 
grisly sex-torture slayings, has been ordered extradited by Justice Minister 
Doug Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
But Ng, who lost one previous round of appeals in the courts, still has legal 
avenues open to challenge the ruling handed down today by the minister. 
</P>
<P>
Ng, a former U.S. Marine, is accused in a series of torture murders that 
occurred in 1985 at a remote mountain home in Wilseyville, about 150 miles east 
of San Francisco, owned by the family of Leonard Lake, Ng's companion. 
</P>
<P>
Ng and Lake have been linked to two dozen slayings. The evidence includes at 
least one videotape of a murder victim. 
</P>
<P>
Ng was captured by Canadian authorities in July, 1985, and imprisoned there for 
attempted murder, stemming from a shoplifting attempt at a downtown Calgary 
department store. Lake had committed suicide the previous month.

OC'S STATE SEN. CAMPBELL, GOP POWERHOUSE, RESIGNS; 
</P>
<P>
WILL BECOME PRESIDENT OF TRADE GROUP

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights), an influential legislator for 
two decades, abruptly announced today that he will resign his seat in January 
to become president of the California Manufacturers Assn., a major trade group 
with extensive lobbying operations in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, whose district stretches from southern Los Angeles County through the 
eastern half of Orange County, said in a morning press conference that he will 
abide by the spirit of proposed ethics reforms that would ban former lawmakers 
from lobbying the Legislature for a year after they leave office. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he intends during an upcoming special legislative session aimed at 
providing earthquake relief to steer clear of any votes that may even have "the 
perception of a conflict of interest" with his new job. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, 54, who won the Republican nomination for state controller in 1986 
but lost to Democrat Gray Davis, acknowledged that part of the reason he is 
leaving the Legislature after 23 years is that his immediate prospects for 
moving up in office are dim. 
</P>
<P>
"Things (opportunity for higher office) started getting farther and farther 
into the future and thus more unattainable," said Campbell. "And so . . . when 
I met with the California Manufacturers Assn. and they made this offer and they 
worked out the details of it, it was an offer I couldn't refuse and probably 
the best thing for me." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell -- a glib public speaker who is in high demand on the toastmaster 
circuit -- said his decision to leave the Legislature was not influenced by 
proposed ethics rules to ban the acceptance of speaking fees. Those fees netted 
him $46,900 last year. He also said he was not influenced by recent news 
stories about how his wife and chief aide made thousands of dollars from a 
series of women's conferences sponsored by Campbell's office. 
</P>
<P>
Today's announcement immediately touched off speculation about who would 
replace Campbell in the 31st Senatorial District, a Republican enclave. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of Campbell's announcement, Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier) 
announced his intention to run for the spot after Campbell resigns during the 
first week of January. Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) also was 
reported considering a bid for the Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell was first elected to serve as an assemblyman from southern Los Angeles 
County in 1966, the youngest Republican in the Legislature. He quit in 1972 to 
run unsuccessfully for the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, returning 
to the Assembly in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
He moved over to the Senate in 1976, where he was later voted minority leader, 
a prestigious post he held until deposed in 1983. Three years later, he ran a 
losing campaign for state controller in a race and still has $400,000 in debt 
from that campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Campbell has carried legislation aimed at clearing government 
regulation for private industry and he said today that his new post would be a 
"good marriage." 
</P>
<P>
The trade group represents about 70% of the state's manufacturers.

EAST GERMAN LEADERS TALK TO OPPOSITION;

REFORM: NEW FORUM ACTIVISTS ARE CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC AT DIALOGUE SEEKING AN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Communist leaders in East Berlin and Dresden met opposition activists today for 
the first substantive talks on how to end East Germany's worst political 
upheavals in 36 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party leader in the capital, Politburo member Guenter Schabowski, 
conferred with two scientists who helped found New Forum, which claims 26,000 
members and is the largest opposition group. 
</P>
<P>
In the southern industrial city of Dresden, party leader Hans Modrow organized 
a conference with opposition supporters and other local citizens. Modrow is 
reputed to be the leading advocate of reform in the political establishment. 
</P>
<P>
After his two-hour meeting with Schabowski, scientist Jens Reich told reporters 
he believes the authorities are serious about starting a dialogue with the 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"We will see, but I would say cautiously that I have a positive impression," 
Reich said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Schabowski had hinted at more competitive elections and a new law 
permitting street demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
But he said Schabowski had told him and fellow scientist Sebastian Pflugbeil 
that it was outside his authority to legalize New Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The authorities are trying to overcome a crisis in which hundreds of thousands 
of people, inspired by changes in the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary, have 
demonstrated for democracy this month in all big East German cities. 
</P>
<P>
More than 120,000 of East Germany's 16.6 million people have fled to the West 
this year, about half of them by crossing Hungary's border with Austria, open 
since mid-September, or by seeking refuge in West German embassies in Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The unrest is the worst since Soviet forces suppressed a workers' uprising in 
1953. It prompted the replacement of Erich Honecker as party leader last week 
by Egon Krenz, who has pledged dialogue with everyone who respects East German 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz promised this week that all East Germans would soon have passports and 
the right to travel without restrictions to Western countries and West Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
But members of New Forum, a group embracing a wide spectrum of non-Communist 
activists, have made clear that free travel to the West will not be enough to 
satisfy their demands for change. 
</P>
<P>
They want the lifting of media censorship, an end to official privileges, 
legalization of opposition groups, a relaxation of the rigid ideological 
discipline in education and free, competitive elections. 
</P>
<P>
In East Berlin, East Germany's official lawyers' organization today demanded 
liberal changes to the criminal code.

Former First Lady Nancy Reagan today presented her "Just Say No" anti-drug 
campaign to television viewers in relatively drug-free Japan. 
</P>
<P>
In a live 25-minute interview, she talked about a problem that is incomparably 
worse in the United States than in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese police confiscated less than a ton of marijuana and stimulants in 
1988, whereas U.S. authorities often confiscate many tons of marijuana in 
single arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Arrests in Japan for as little as a gram of cocaine and less than an ounce of 
marijuana still make headlines in national papers. 
</P>
<P>
While the Reagans were in the White House, despite Mrs. Reagan's efforts, drug 
use in urban America grew from a problem to a crisis, former President Ronald 
Reagan said in a televised interview. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans are visiting Japan for nine days as the guests of the Japanese 
government and Fujisankei Communications Group, which is reportedly paying them 
$2 million.

A China Airlines' Boeing 737 carrying 54 people crashed into a mountain and 
burned today just after taking off from the eastern city of Hualien, and all 
aboard were feared dead, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
All were Taiwanese except for a passenger identified as a businessman from 
California. The airline gave his name as J. W. Philips. It did not provide a 
hometown. 
</P>
<P>
The jet was en route from Hualien to Taipei, 93 miles away. Witnesses on a 
nearby highway said they could see the flames from the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
Hualien police said about 130 rescuers rushed to the crash site near Chia Min, 
a village of about 2,000 people. The site was accessible only by foot. It was 
expected to take them hours to reach the plane, and they were slowed by rain 
and darkness. 
</P>
<P>
The jet left Hualien at 6:54 p.m. and crashed five minutes later, according to 
officials of the airline, Taiwan's national flag carrier. It said there were 47 
passengers and seven crew members. Airline spokesman Lodge Lo said all were 
believed killed. 
</P>
<P>
It was raining when the plane took off, but the cause of the crash was not 
known. No other details were immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, where Boeing is based, Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Tom 
Cole identified the aircraft as a 737-200 delivered to China Airlines in 
December, 1986. He had no other details. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's worst air disaster was in 1981, when 110 people died in the crash of a 
Far Eastern Air Transport Boeing 737.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev pledged today to pull out all Soviet 
Golf-class nuclear submarines from the Baltic Sea by 1991 and proposed an 
East-West agreement to make the region a nuclear-free zone. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, in a speech on the second day of a state visit to Finland, also 
announced that all Soviet tactical nuclear missiles in the northwest of his 
country had been redeployed to put targets in Northern Europe out of their 
range. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Baltic Sea area, the Soviet Union is about to proceed unilaterally to 
eliminate certain classes of sea-launched nuclear weapons," the Soviet leader 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"As has been reported, the Soviet Union started by removing from operational 
status two Golf-class submarines, and before the end of 1990 it will destroy 
the four remaining submarines of the same class," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said the submarines' nuclear weapons will also be destroyed and there 
were no plans for their replacement. 
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to come to an agreement with all the nuclear powers and the 
Baltic states on effective guarantees for the nuclear-free status of the Baltic 
Sea," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader was speaking in Finlandia Hall, where the 1975 European 
Security and Cooperation agreement was signed by then-Soviet leader Leonid I. 
Brezhnev and President Gerald R. Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said the Soviet Union had taken a number of unilateral steps in the 
last two years in support of Finnish proposals to remove all nuclear weapons 
from Northern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"As of now, we have no medium- or shorter-range missiles on operational status 
in areas adjacent to the north of Europe. Soviet tactical nuclear systems are 
now deployed in areas from which they cannot reach Northern Europe from any 
given site in Soviet territory," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Along with his disarmament proposals, the Kremlin chief also called for greater 
economic cooperation with the West and in particular with the European 
Community and the European Free Trade Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the various integration groups are moving ahead at a different 
pace need not stand in the way of our quest for common ground, especially since 
we already have quite a few problems in common," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
He said one way of achieving such cooperation would be through a tripartite 
European Commission of experts from the European Community, the European Free 
Trade Assn. and the Eastern trade bloc, Comecon, to discuss compatibility and 
the harmonization of economic mechanisms. 
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, which he described as "the main purpose" of his visit 
to Finland, Gorbachev expressed satisfaction with developments since the 
friendship and cooperation treaty was signed.

Warning of a national work force crisis, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole 
announced plans today for a commission, an advisory board, a conference, a 
clearinghouse, a volunteer network and an awards program seeking to better 
prepare American workers. 
</P>
<P>
In her annual state of the work force address, Dole said the products of these 
efforts would include national competency guidelines for workers and an 
accreditation program for employees in service industries. 
</P>
<P>
"America faces a work force crisis. Simply put, America's work force is in a 
state of unreadiness -- unready for the new jobs, unready for the new 
realities, unready for the new challenges of the '90s," Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
"The assembly-line jobs that once required only hand-eye coordination are 
headed the way of the dinosaurs," she told a gathering of state teachers and 
principals of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Over half the jobs in our economy will soon require education beyond high 
school," she said.

ECONOMY UP AT ANNUAL 2.5% RATE IN SPITE OF TRADE DROP, HURRICANE

<P>
The U.S. economy grew at a moderate annual rate of 2.5% from July through 
September despite the poorest trade performance in six years and a $4-billion 
income loss from Hurricane Hugo, the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the increase in the gross national product, the 
broadest measure of economic health, matched a 2.5% rise in the April-June 
quarter. Third-quarter growth was aided primarily by a boom in consumer 
spending that resulted from heavy car sales. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation showed a marked improvement in the third quarter, with a price index 
tied to the GNP climbing at an annual rate of just 2.9%, down significantly 
from a 4.9% annual advance in the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Darby, undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs, said the 
moderate economic growth and lower inflation offer encouraging signs that the 
nation's record peacetime expansion will extend into the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
The lower inflation rate is "creating appropriate conditions for stronger 
non-inflationary growth as the decade of the 1990s unfolds," Darby said. 
</P>
<P>
Through the first nine months of 1989, the economy has grown at an annual rate 
of 2.9%, exactly on target with the Bush Administration's forecast for the 
whole year. 
</P>
<P>
But many analysts are predicting that growth will slump dramatically in the 
final three months of this year in the absence of the auto sales boom that 
spurred consumer spending from July through September. 
</P>
<P>
Many economists predict the country will flirt with a possible recession over 
the next 12 months because of expected weakness in such areas as trade and 
business investment. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of deterioration were evident in the third quarter as the U.S. trade 
deficit, as measured by the GNP, surged by $22.9 billion. It was the worst 
trade figure since the second quarter of 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Trade had been one of the economy's brightest spots as a boom in export sales 
spurred a rebound in U.S. manufacturing. However, economists have warned for 
some time that hefty increases in the value of the dollar threatened to derail 
the trade improvement by making American goods more expensive on overseas 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, imports shot up at an annual rate of 15.1% while exports 
did not grow at all, the poorest showing since early 1986.

WARNINGS ON LINCOLN SAVINGS IGNORED, 2 REGULATORS TESTIFY

Regulators who recommended in 1987 that the government seize Lincoln Savings 
&amp; Loan Assn. told Congress today they were "shot in the back" by superiors 
in Washington who allowed it to continue to pile up millions of dollars in 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Patriarca, principal supervisory agent in the San Francisco branch of the 
Office of Thrift Supervision, and William Black, district counsel in San 
Francisco, told the House Banking Committee that they saw no reason why top 
thrift regulator M. Danny Wall rejected their 1987 recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
The committee conducted the second of four scheduled hearings into the failure 
of Irvine-based Lincoln, which is expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion, making 
it the nation's costliest thrift collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Patriarca and Black said they tried to have Lincoln closed to stop its losses 
but were thwarted by the vigorous lobbying of its owner, Phoenix millionaire 
Charles H. Keating Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The government did not take over Lincoln until this April, allowing the 
institution to pile up millions in additional losses. 
</P>
<P>
The panel is focusing on a decision by Wall, director of the thrift office, to 
take Patriarca and Black off the case and transfer it to Washington-based 
examiners, who subsequently recommended against a government takeover.

General Motors Corp. is seeking U.S. regulatory clearance to purchase up to 15% 
of Jaguar PLC, a GM spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar, which wants to remain independent and faces a possible takeover bid 
from Ford Motor Co., has been talking with GM about a cooperation agreement 
that would involve GM, the world's biggest auto maker, buying a minority stake 
in Jaguar. 
</P>
<P>
GM's filing for regulatory clearance was within the context of those talks, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The GM spokesman, reached in London, confirmed the company had made a filing 
with the Federal Trade Commission, which must approve major share acquisitions 
involving U.S. companies under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh demanded greater help today from bankers and 
lawyers in uncovering money laundering by drug dealers and demolishing "the 
house that crack built." 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities now are adept at discerning patterns of cash recycling by 
criminals, Thornburgh said, but face a "pattern of increasing sophistication" 
by the cocaine cartels and other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. banking and legal communities are the main line of defense against the 
dealers' $100-billion annual U.S. drug revenues, he told a seminar on the drug 
money laundering problem. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh told the bankers and lawyers that the annual cash intake of U.S. 
crack cocaine and other street drug deals, mostly represented in $20 bills or 
less, weighs 26 million pounds. So drug cartels' main dilemma is, "How do you 
push 26 million pounds of these 20s through a bank window . . . without 
attracting attention?"

Jockey Patrick Valenzuela was refused permission to ride today as the Board of 
Stewards for the Oak Tree meeting at Santa Anita continued an investigation 
into what one of them called the rider's drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, who rode Sunday Silence to victory in the Kentucky Derby and 
Preakness Stakes last spring, was taken off his scheduled mounts by the 
stewards for three days: today, Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, 27, has not ridden since calling in sick Oct. 13. He took a drug 
test Friday, and it was reported initially that the results were negative. 
</P>
<P>
But apparently there was disagreement between the initial report and the 
written report, which stewards subsequently received. 
</P>
<P>
Steward Pete Pedersen said the written report sent to the California Horse 
Racing Board by BPL Toxicology Laboratory of Tarzana showed a positive result 
for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela met with the Board of Stewards today, and the immediate result was 
the continuation of the board's refusal to allow him to ride. Pedersen said he 
and the other stewards will determine a penalty for Valenzuela, "hopefully by 
10 a.m. tomorrow."

TAGLIABUE ELECTED NFL COMMISSIONER AS STALEMATE ENDS

<P>
Paul Tagliabue was elected commissioner of the NFL today, seven months after 
Pete Rozelle announced his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Rooney of the Pittsburgh Steelers, chairman of the five-man committee 
appointed Wednesday night to break the stalemate among the 28 owners, said the 
committee unanimously recommended the selection of Tagliabue as commissioner 
for five years. 
</P>
<P>
"We come out of this meeting as one," Rooney said. "I think everybody just felt 
it was time to do the job, and it was in the spirit of doing the job for the 
league." 
</P>
<P>
The vote of the league's owners was believed to be unanimous after a long 
deadlock. In recent weeks, a bloc of owners repeatedly denied the required 
majority to Jim Finks, the early favorite and recommendation of the original 
selection committee. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Finks, president of the New Orleans Saints, came within three 
votes of election. 
</P>
<P>
"My congratulations go to Paul," Finks said in a statement released from New 
Orleans by public relations man Rusty Kasmiersky. "He will be an outstanding 
commissioner and should serve the NFL for many years to come." 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue was en route from his Washington office to Cleveland at the time of 
the announcement and was not immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Art Modell of the Cleveland Browns, a staunch Finks supporter, said that within 
the last 48 hours, Finks was offered a job of president of the NFL in charge of 
football operations. However, he declined the offer. 
</P>
<P>
"The intention was to bring both Paul Tagliabue and Jim Finks into leadership 
roles," Modell said. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue, 48, is an NFL counsel and partner in the prestigious law firm of 
Covington &amp; Burling. He's been a quiet but powerful league insider for 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFL Players Assn., said that players are 
glad to see the selection process completed and that Tagliabue is not unknown 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
"We've met in the antitrust arena and on issues including drug testing," Upshaw 
said in Washington. "I find him to be very straight-forward and he wants to 
solve problems. He understands things have to be done and has never been 
opposed to taking action to solve problems."

TAGLIABUE A LOW-PROFILE BUT POWERFUL NFL FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE GOLDBERG, AP FOOTBALL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It became a regular routine the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
Every time a sticky problem faced the NFL, Pete Rozelle summoned his top aides 
to discuss a solution. After everyone was heard, Rozelle asked one more 
question: 
</P>
<P>
"What does Paul think?" 
</P>
<P>
Paul, in this case, is Paul Tagliabue, the self-effacing, low-profile lawyer 
who was selected today to succeed Rozelle. 
</P>
<P>
It's ironic in a way that the 6-foot, 5-inch former Georgetown basketball 
player, who from 1960 to 1962 wore the "33" later worn by Patrick Ewing, 
emerged as the candidate of the dissident owners who in July blocked the 
election of Jim Finks, the president and general manager of the New Orleans 
Saints. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue has been a quiet but powerful NFL insider for 20 years -- a voice 
that counts in the league office and a man whose role in the last few years has 
expanded beyond legal counsel to all-around adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Finks, by contrast, has been a team executive, a breed sometimes given to 
complaint about highhandedness emanating from the New York headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
But Tagliabue is hardly highhanded. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, he is self-effacing, friendly but reserved, a man whose 
athletic prowess was demonstrated primarily on the tennis court -- against 
Finks, among others. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he did not know he was the seventh-leading rebounder in Georgetown 
history until he went to a game a few years ago with his son, Drew, who thumbed 
through the program, then turned to his father and asked: "Hey, Dad, did you 
know your name's in here?" 
</P>
<P>
He also has a sense of humor, one that emerged after he met with the owners at 
a meeting in Grapevine, Tex., where they were trying to resolve the deadlock 
over who should be the new commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't promise them 'a chicken in every pot,' " he said later. "Read my 
lips, 'No free agency.' Read my lips, 'More television money.' I'm not George 
Bush running for an office." 
</P>
<P>
But, most often, he is cautious, lawyerly. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very controlled, very logical," said Michael Chernoff, general counsel 
for the Indianapolis Colts. "But he's not just a pin-striped suit. I've seen 
him in Docksiders with no socks." 
</P>
<P>
"I've never believed that Paul is interested in prolonging conflict," said Gene 
Upshaw, NFL Players' Assn. executive director. "In fact, if the situation were 
different, I wouldn't mind having a beer with him," said. "He realizes that in 
sports there are many things to do beyond litigation."
