Noting that two other nightclubs have been taken to court for denying entrance 
to unflashy dressers, the Hollywood spot Spice hired two comics to portray 
nerdy doormen this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
They're the Morris Bros., who will be decked out in eye glasses mended with 
masking tape, pockets stuffed with pens, mismatched socks, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Don't get the wrong idea, though. Spice will also continue its policy of 
slamming the door in the face of the unglamorous. 
</P>
<P>
"We have very, very beautiful people coming in every night," spokeswoman Ilene 
Proctor confided. She added that if Spice permitted the entry of "people that 
don't look the part, it would damage our image." 
</P>
<P>
Thank goodness we don't look the part. 
</P>
<P>
If you're not lucky enough to qualify as the kind of celeb that Spice can 
stomach, you can literally dress like one on Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
The CTG Costume Shop in downtown L.A. is renting costumes worn by the stars of 
local productions at prices ranging from $25 to $200 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Available are outfits that were custom-made for such performers as Mick Jagger 
("The Nightingale"), Bernadette Peters ("Sleeping Beauty") and Herve 
Villechaize ("Circus of the Stars.") 
</P>
<P>
Villechaize's white tuxedo from "Fantasy Island" is not among the items. As 
Tatoo would have put it, "Sorry, boss." 
</P>
<P>
Dafna Promotions Inc., a dream-interpretation service in Beverly Hills, would 
like to help President Bush. But it needs more information on Iraqi leader 
Saddam Hussein's reported dream that included an appearance by the prophet 
Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein, for instance, did not offer such symbolic details as "whether Mohammed 
came to him driving in a car, walking or riding a horse," Dafna said. 
</P>
<P>
All is not lost, though. The company says it will interpret a dream by mail for 
$21 and by fax for $31. 
</P>
<P>
The next move's up to you, Saddam. 
</P>
<P>
You may recall the victory some weeks ago of Walter Pierce and his Northridge 
group ROOSTER (Rural Outcry over Sexist Tactics to Eliminate Roosters). 
</P>
<P>
ROOSTER persuaded the county to drop a proposed ordinance that would have 
banned those noisy cock-a-doodle-doers from yards of one acre or less in 
unincorporated L.A. County. Chickens would have been exempted. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the triumph hasn't been forgotten. The other day, someone opened the door 
to Pierce's janitorial services company and threw in a live rooster. 
</P>
<P>
"A gift, or retribution, depending on how you look at it," Pierce said, 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
He added that he gave the rooster to a friend who has three lonely chickens. 
</P>
<P>
Only in L.A., it should be noted, foresaw this rooster incident in a recent 
dream. It took place at Spice. Tatoo was there, in his tux. Hussein tossed the 
rooster through the front door, past the bouncer. The fax is on the way, Dafna. 
</P>
<P>

11.

JOSEPHSON ON ETHICS OF YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It must be nice to sit in an office in Marina del Rey pontificating about 
what's wrong with the world while engaging in sanctimonious hyperbole about the 
decay of an entire generation of American youth. 
</P>
<P>
Josephson does not even identify what his role as a harbinger of ethical 
platitudes is. 
</P>
<P>
Is he a parent, a teacher, a worker, a manager or a business leader? Or is he 
just a brow-beater of the first order, ready in theory but lacking in 
implementation? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Josephson ought to spend more time in the front lines of life acting as 
a role model for my misguided generation. Then maybe he would look twice at 
himself before attacking people he doesn't even know or care to know.

In response "Young America Is Looking Out for No. 1," by Michael Josephson 
(Commentary, Oct. 16): 
</P>
<P>
I will concede that the ethics of my generation tend to be lax. Now, I'd like 
you to consider where we've been getting our ideas from. 
</P>
<P>
When President Reagan gave tax breaks to the rich so the money would "trickle 
down" to the poor, who came first? 
</P>
<P>
When members of Congress voted themselves a raise as the national debt climbed 
to its highest in our country's history, who came first? 
</P>
<P>
When President Bush asked the country to read his lips, was he telling a little 
white lie or just pretending he could do whatever he wanted? Now he's trying to 
protect the rich from higher taxes. It seems we've heard this song before. 
</P>
<P>
Who caused the Iran-Contra scandal, the HUD scandal, the savings and loan 
scandal, the billions in misappropriated defense funds? And who will be paying 
for all this well into the next century? It's the working population ages 
18-30. 
</P>
<P>
We've gotten a pretty strong message from the men and women who have been 
setting examples for us. We've learned that when it comes to ethics, rich and 
poor are the only delineations made by the people who make the laws in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Before we are told our ethics "will cause significant future harm," examine the 
code of ethics handed down to us by the past two generations of leaders.

CONDUCTOR BERNSTEIN

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I assume that anyone who was ever touched by the genius of Leonard Bernstein 
will have his own memory of the Renaissance man of music, as you aptly 
described him (Part A, Oct. 15). 
</P>
<P>
Mine dates back to October, 1948, when I was serving as an American volunteer 
in the Israeli army during the country's War of Independence. 
</P>
<P>
With a two-day pass in hand, I hitchhiked to Jerusalem, where the Israeli 
equivalent of the USO scrounged up a ticket for the evening's performance of 
the Israel Philharmonic, with Bernstein as the guest conductor. 
</P>
<P>
The audience was a mix of black-tie patrons and soldiers dressed in fatigues. 
Bernstein raised the baton for Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, emotional at any 
time, but never more so than for a people engaged in a life-and-death struggle. 
Toward the end of the first movement, machine-gun fire started crackling from 
the old city, held by the Jordanian Legion, and continued intermittently 
through the rest of the symphony. What would have been a distracting 
disturbance at any other time, melded, with the music as entirely appropriate 
to the mood and circumstances of the occasion. Lenny and the orchestra, never 
missed a beat.

ANOTHER ELECTION RERUN: YOUR UNCHALLENGED CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a variety of reasons, it's almost impossible to defeat an incumbent member 
of Congress. To be fair, that's not all bad. California voters have learned 
that in recent years as key members of the state's 45-person House delegation 
have garnered the political clout that comes with seniority on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not all to the good, either. It makes for a Congress that is perceived 
by many citizens as unresponsive, aloof and maybe even elitist. It makes for 
members of Congress who are locked into cozy relationships with the 
special-interest groups that so generously donate to their campaign coffers. 
</P>
<P>
The public interest lobby Common Cause, for example, reports that the 405 House 
members seeking reelection this year have raised more than $177 million to run 
for reelection, while all their challengers have raised less than $15 million. 
That kind of financial imbalance makes even weak incumbents well-nigh 
invincible. 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite the fact many incumbents can hold seats in Congress until they die 
or walk away from them, that hasn't made them more farsighted or courageous. On 
the contrary, many members of Congress seemingly become paranoid about losing a 
nice job with so many perks. They become fearful of angering key interest 
groups or constituents. The result in Washington is political gridlock like 
that seen on the federal budget deficit. The result at home is growing voter 
disaffection and frustration. 
</P>
<P>
But barring a political earthquake like federal term limits, nothing is going 
to shake up Southern California's congressional delegation this year. The 
advantages of incumbency are too great -- not just the money and visibility, 
but districts designed through reapportionment to be as safe as possible. 
</P>
<P>
That is why The Times has decided to be even more selective in its endorsements 
than in the recent past. For some time now we have not endorsed in every 
congressional race in Southern California, or even Los Angeles. This year we 
endorse in only two. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say there are not local members of Congress doing a commendable 
job on Capitol Hill. Indeed, as noted above, the advantages of seniority -- and 
the fact that most in Los Angeles County are Democrats and thus members of the 
House majority -- have put several in key positions where they've had an impact 
on national policy and local issues. 
</P>
<P>
Among them are Anthony C. Beilenson of Beverly Hills, a member of the Select 
Committee on Intelligence; Edward Roybal of Los Angeles, who chairs the House 
Select Committee on Aging; Howard Berman of Sherman Oaks, who serves on the 
Foreign Affairs and Judiciary committees; Mel Levine of Los Angeles, a member 
of the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee; Julian Dixon of Los Angeles, who 
chairs the House Ethics Committee; Glenn Anderson of San Pedro, who has brought 
many federal benefits to the Los Angeles-Long Beach Harbor, and Henry Waxman of 
Los Angeles, who led the fight for a Clean Air Bill and on key health issues 
like AIDS treatment and research. A Republican in a similarly important 
position is Jerry Lewis, of Redlands, ranking minority member on the House 
Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
None of these men faces a serious electoral challenge this year, so endorsing 
them would be pointless. Let it simply be noted that they are valuable 
lawmakers who by and large are making very positive contributions to the 
democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
The two local congressional races where we are endorsing are in districts east 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In San Bernardino and Riverside counties, veteran Rep. George E. Brown Jr., a 
Democrat, is facing only the latest challenge the Republican party has waged 
against him. That's because Brown's 36th Congressional District is a suburban 
area that, by most reckonings, should vote Republican. His opponent this year 
is San Bernardino County Supervisor Robert L. Hammock, a practical and moderate 
Republican. But Brown is usually reelected because of the service he's rendered 
as a member of the House's Science, Space and Technology Committee. His support 
for scientific research benefits not only his district but all California. He 
deserves another term. 
</P>
<P>
The same cannot be said for the incumbent in the San Gabriel Valley's 30th 
Congressional District. Democratic Rep. Matthew (Marty) Martinez is an 
embarrassment whose lack of achievement in Congress has been chronicled by 
publications as disparate as trendy Spy Magazine and the staid Almanac of 
American Politics. That's why we recommend that district voters cast their 
ballots for Reuben Franco, an energetic young businessman who describes himself 
as a "Jack Kemp" Republican. Martinez can argue that a political neophyte will 
wield nowhere near the influence for the 3Oth District that an incumbent does 
-- except that by almost everyone's account Martinez has done little of any 
significance since being elected in 1982. The 1990 Almanac tellingly dismisses 
him as "close to a zero in terms of activity or influence." The people of the 
30th District can't do much worse than that by electing Franco. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Congressional Bottom Line: 
</P>
<P>
405 House members seeking reelection this year have raised more than $177 
million to campaign. 
</P>
<P>
All their challengers together have raised less than $15 million.

I give Bernstein much of the credit for my lifelong appreciation of good music. 
</P>
<P>
Many years ago, when I was very young, I watched his lectures on "Omnibus" and 
thought he was just the coolest thing I'd ever seen. He convinced this 
schoolgirl, on her relentless quest for hipness, that you could love classical 
music without being square. I'm sure I'm joined by millions in being immensely 
grateful for the wonderful gift that was Leonard Bernstein. Thanks, Lenny, and 
Godspeed.

Myrna Oliver's obituary on Leonard Bernstein (Oct. 15) contained a phrasing 
that perpetuates a negative stereotype of gay men and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining the 1987 published biography of Bernstein which documents his 
relationships with men, she writes "Although . . . Bernstein had many 
homosexual affairs . . . there was no question that he adored his family." The 
implication is that homosexuals cannot adore their families or even have 
families. Many gay men and lesbians do indeed have families and many are 
adored.

WITH FLORIDA ST. ABOARD, IT'S A WHOLE NEW ACC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE BRENNAN, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A month ago, Florida State joined the Atlantic Coast Conference, and eight 
football coaches shuddered. 
</P>
<P>
The men who are in charge of the existing eight ACC football teams said they 
were pleased to have such fine competition, but they also know what they are in 
for when the Seminoles begin playing a conference schedule in 1993 or 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State has finished in the top three of the Associated Press poll in 
each of the past three seasons. Only once in those three years has an ACC team 
finished in the top 10; Clemson was ninth in 1988. (Virginia, of course, is 
ranked No. 1 now, with FSU 12th.) 
</P>
<P>
The decision to invite Florida State into the ACC was couched in the flowery 
language of academia, but the real reason the Seminoles were brought into the 
fold, from the ACC's vantage point, is that they play great football. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it was football-driven," said Duke Athletic Director Tom Butters, 
who joined Maryland in voting against FSU's entry into the league. "The ACC 
looked at other factors, but the decision was driven by football." 
</P>
<P>
However, there is much more to Florida State's athletic portfolio than 
football. The ACC hasn't simply invited a football bully to move onto the 
block. It has brought in an industrial-strength athletic juggernaut that could 
dominate the rest of the conference in many of the 16 sports the school plays. 
</P>
<P>
Some in the ACC see this as a positive, a chance to raise the level of play 
throughout the league by having a strong competitor to play against. Others are 
not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"At a time in which there is supposed to be reform, when we are concerned about 
time pressures on our student-athletes, the number of games they are playing 
and the hours they are practicing, we've just raised the price of the game by 
putting in place a very powerful athletic institution in the league," Maryland 
Athletic Director Andy Geiger said. 
</P>
<P>
"For the Olympic sports like baseball, tennis and swimming, we've got a steep 
mountain to climb. Don't get me wrong. We're going to go after them, we're 
going to compete. But the point is they're very good and we're not so good and 
we need to address that. We've got a lot of work to do." 
</P>
<P>
The refrain is being heard around the ACC. Florida State, recruiting and 
playing in the sunshine and warm weather that has attracted hundreds of 
blue-chip prospects over the years, brings the largest enrollment (28,077) and 
the second largest football stadium (60,519 to Clemson's 79,854) to the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
The school sent 12 of its 16 teams (or individuals from those teams) to NCAA 
postseason play in the 1989-90 season. The Seminoles baseball team, which has 
reached the College World Series three of the last five years and has qualified 
for the NCAA regionals 13 consecutive seasons, made the regional finals and was 
ranked seventh in the nation last year. The women's softball team tied for 
third in the College World Series. The women's track team was 13th at the NCAA 
championships. The men's golf team was eighth in the NCAAs. 
</P>
<P>
"They provide formidable competition in many areas, but I welcome that," said 
Butters, whose objection in the conference vote was to ACC expansion, not to 
Florida State. "To me, that's not negative. We will not allow Florida State's 
program to change the philosophy of what we do here at Duke, but the fact that 
their teams are so good may help our programs." 
</P>
<P>
That is the hope of Tom Bradley, a Maryland alumnus who has returned home after 
coaching the baseball team at Jacksonville University the last 12 years. The 
former major league pitcher is taking over a team that finished last in the ACC 
last season and has just 7 1/2 scholarships to Florida State's 13. 
</P>
<P>
"The addition of Florida State is going to make it tougher for the Dukes, 
Marylands and Virginias to get into a regional tournament," Bradley said. "It's 
going to make it tougher for us to get a bid down the road, when we turn things 
around here. There are five powerhouse schools in the ACC in baseball: North 
Carolina, Clemson, North Carolina State, Georgia Tech and Florida State. The 
addition of Florida State will raise the stature of the league, but it will be 
tougher on us." 
</P>
<P>
What effect Florida State will have on the crown jewel of the conference -- 
basketball -- is anyone's guess. Coach Pat Kennedy's team was 16-15 last season 
and was not selected for the NCAA tournament for the first time in three years. 
The Seminoles will begin conference play in 1991-92, and most observers expect 
them to be strong contenders within a few years. 
</P>
<P>
As schools jump regional barriers and conferences continue to shift and 
realign, Florida State's leap from football independent and Metro Conference 
member to the ACC makes as much sense as any of the recent high-profile moves. 
</P>
<P>
The ACC studied the state of Florida as it negotiated with the Seminoles and 
found some statistics very much to its liking. There are about nine million 
homes with televisions in ACC states. There are 5.5 million homes with TVs in 
Florida alone. Also, there are more newspapers with circulation of 200,000 or 
more in Florida than there are in the five other states combined that have ACC 
members. 
</P>
<P>
"This brings us into the state of Florida," ACC Commissioner Gene Corrigan said 
when the decision was announced Sept. 15. "That's the key, I think. That may be 
the thing more on our people's minds than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
"We've opened up the state of Florida," Geiger said. "The major networks could 
be expected to be much more excited about ACC football now." 
</P>
<P>
There is something in this for Florida State, too. The Seminoles were talking 
with the Southeastern Conference, but football coach Bobby Bowden said bluntly 
he didn't think he could win a national title playing a murderous SEC schedule. 
Bowden knows what it takes to win the national title, even if he hasn't won it 
yet. What it doesn't take is three or four losses. 
</P>
<P>
"With the SEC, we'd really be sectionalized if we played there, played a 
schedule of Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia and so and so," Bowden said in a recent 
interview. "You can't afford to take on all of them and Notre Dame, Miami and 
Florida unless you want to go 7-4 every year, at the best." 
</P>
<P>
Florida State did not need the football identity of the SEC. It already had it. 
</P>
<P>
But Butters wonders if the ACC did not make a decision based too heavily on 
that sport. 
</P>
<P>
"I have great respect for what Florida State is in football, but that doesn't 
necessarily last forever," Butters said. "You only have to go back 15 years to 
the pre-Bowden days (when FSU won four games in the three seasons prior to 
Bowden's arrival). That leads to a question for reasonable men and women to 
ponder: What happens post-Bowden?" 
</P>
<P>
Until that moment, if not after, the ACC possesses one of the great football 
programs of our day. And Florida State finally owns, as one player put it, a 
certain mystique. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good deal for both of us," said FSU senior tight end Dave Roberts. 
"What they're gaining is one of the top football powers in the country, a 
school whose basketball program is on the rise and who has stable programs in 
all its sports. The main thing we're gaining is future financial stability and 
the ACC mystique. When you say an Ivy League school or an ACC school, that has 
a connotation about it that sheds a good light. It's going to be nice to be 
able to say, 'I'm going to an ACC school: Florida State.' "

Olympic silver medalist Riddick Bowe remained undefeated Thursday night by 
stopping Bert Cooper at the end of the second round of their scheduled 10-round 
heavyweight fight. 
</P>
<P>
Bowe knocked Cooper down late in the second round, then again as the bell 
sounded, prompting referee Richard Steele to move in and stop the fight at 3:09 
of the second round. 
</P>
<P>
The fight was the featured bout on the undercard of the undisputed heavyweight 
championship fight between James "Buster" Douglas and Evander Holyfield at the 
Mirage Hotel and Casino. 
</P>
<P>
Bowe, winning his 20th straight fight as a pro and 18th by knockout, started 
slowly but began finding the range with right hands in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
With about 20 seconds left in the round, Bowe landed a big overhand right that 
buckled Cooper's legs, then followed with another right that put him down. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper was up at the count of five, but Bowe, 230 of Brooklyn, N.Y., was on top 
of him quickly and landed a series of blows that put him down for the second 
time as the bell sounded to end the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Steele counted to five before waving the fight to a close. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, 208 of Philadelphia, fell to 22-7. 
</P>
<P>
It was Cooper's second straight loss to a member of the 1988 Olympic team. In 
August, he dropped a 12-round decision to heavyweight gold medalist Ray Mercer. 
Bowe fought in Seoul as a super-heavyweight. 
</P>
<P>
Another Olympic teammate, light-heavyweight Andrew Maynard, also won Thursday 
night, scoring a unanimous eight-round decision over Keith McMurray of Las 
Vegas.

NHL ROUNDUP;

MULLEN GIVES RANGERS AN ASSIST IN 5-3 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Rangers spent the off-season brooding over their failure to 
advance past the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
They vowed to prove that it was no fluke they won the competitive Patrick 
Division title last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Now they are off to a fast start. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Mullen assisted on four goals Thursday night at New York as the Rangers 
came from behind to beat the Philadelphia Flyers, 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers' sixth consecutive victory at Madison Square Garden matches their 
best home start. In 1983, they also won their first six home games. The 
Rangers, who have won seven of their last eight, are 8-3-0 and with 16 points, 
are the overall leader in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers, trying to get above the .500 mark on the road, led, 3-2, going into 
the third period. But in the first minute, former King Bernie Nicholls 
converted a goalmouth feed from Mullen into the tying goal. 
</P>
<P>
With a little more than six minutes remaining, Kevin Miller took a cross-ice 
pass from Mullen and beat Ken Wregget with a quick shot. 
</P>
<P>
Darren Turcotte set up the Rangers' second goal to extend his scoring streak to 
all 11 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 8, Toronto 5 -- Hot-shooting Brett Hull became the first player in 
Blues' history to have back-to-back hat tricks. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night at Toronto Hull scored his third goal midway through the third 
period. In this game at St. Louis, he had three goals after 21:14 of play. 
</P>
<P>
The first was a fluke when the puck bounced into the net off his skate, but he 
blasted home the other two to give him 13 in 10 games this season. He led the 
league last season with 72 goals. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third loss in a row for the Maple Leafs. The Blues scored 16 goals 
in the two-game series. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 3, Washington 2 -- Eight seconds after the overtime faceoff at Chicago, 
Steve Larmer stole the puck and scored his ninth goal of the season to give the 
Black Hawks their seventh victory in 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
Larmer also scored Chicago's first goal in the opening minute of the second 
period. But most of the night the Capitals dominated. 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals, who never trailed until overtime, led, 2-1, until defenseman 
Chris Chelios tied it in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary 4, Edmonton 2 -- Mark Hunter scored twice at Calgary and the Flames 
moved to within one point of the Kings in the Smythe Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers, who are 0-3-1 on the road this season, are in last place, nine 
points behind the Kings. It was the third loss in a row for the Stanley Cup 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 5, Buffalo 1 -- The home teams are enjoying a big advantage in the 
early going this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Devils, with Kirk Muller getting a goal and two assists, improved to 6-0-1 
at home and kept the pressure on the Rangers. The Devils (7-3-1) trail the 
Rangers by only a point. 
</P>
<P>
The Devils broke the game open with three goals in three minutes midway through 
the last period. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Terrari stopped 28 shots to win for the sixth time in his last seven 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 4, Vancouver 2 -- In a recent four-game trip, the Bruins were outscored, 
26-4, so they were happy to return home. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Canucks challenged in the closing minutes, the Bruins ended the 
four-game losing streak with their third victory without a loss at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Lemelin had a 3-0 lead and was bidding for his 12th career shutout, but 
gave up a goal to Trevor Linden with 2:48 to play. A minute later, the Canucks 
scored again after pulling goalie Troy Gamble. An empty net goal ended the 
rally with four seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 6, Quebec 3 -- Kevin Stevens had a hat trick and the Penguins scored 
on their first four shots at Pittsburgh to end a four-game winless streak. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie goaltender John Tanner left after Stevens' first goal made it 3-0 at 
12:45 of the first period. Stevens' second score was on the Penguins' first 
shot at Tanner's replacement, Ron Tugnutt. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens scored his other goal halfway through the second period. DAN HAFNER

Irvine High School had to struggle with itself and visiting San Clemente before 
emerging with a 24-22 penalty-plagued victory in front of a homecoming crowd of 
3,500 in South Coast League play Thursday at Irvine High School. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros (6-2, 2-1 in the league) fell victim to 11 penalties for 111 yards 
and trailed at halftime, 14-10, before junior quarterback Jason Minici took 
charge in the second half and drove his team to a 24-14 fourth-quarter lead 
over the Tritons (4-4, 0-3). 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente jumped to a first-half lead behind the passing of quarterback Ken 
Dolan. 
</P>
<P>
The Tritons drove 69 yards with the opening kickoff to score on Dolan's 
one-yard run, but Irvine's Tim Meehan returned the kickoff 50 yards to set up a 
tying touchdown on Scott Seal's four-yard run. San Clemente scored with 14 
seconds left in the half when Morgan Bannister held on to Dolan's 25-yard pass 
in the end zone just long enough for the halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Deron McCoy's fumble recovery set up Irvine's go-ahead touchdown with 1 minute 
17 seconds left in the third quarter on Minici's 10-yard pass to Chris Perry. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Kang's pass interception on the Triton 34 set up the final Irvine score, 
a six-yard run by Seal with 1:14 remaining. San Clemente drove for a score on a 
19-yard pass from Dolan to Bannister with 28 seconds left and added a two-point 
conversion. TOM BIRSCHBACH

In a Century League game: 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park 29, Canyon 22 -- Officials flagged Canyon High School for 17 
penalties amounting to 168 yards as Villa Park won at El Modena High. 
</P>
<P>
With a 14-0 lead at halftime, Villa Park (5-3, 2-1 in the league) took the 
second-half kickoff and went 71 yards in nine plays, scoring on Don Bladow's 
15-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park scored less than three minutes later on Ellis Williams' three-yard 
run, his second touchdown of the game. Williams gained 85 yards in 20 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 27-0, Canyon tried to get its offense moving by employing the 
"Polecat" formation. This sent nine players close to the sideline, leaving 
running back Jeff Brunswig to snap the ball to quarterback Darren Lish seven 
yards behind the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
It helped spark the Comanches, who rallied for 22 fourth-quarter points, mostly 
against Villa Park reserves. Brunswig led Canyon with 115 yards and a touchdown 
in 12 carries. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

INJURY STOPS SAVANNA'S 26-15 VICTORY WITH 2:16 LEFT

An injury to Anaheim High School linebacker Say Iemsisanith prompted officials 
to end Thursday night's game with two minutes 16 seconds remaining and Savanna 
leading, 26-15. 
</P>
<P>
Iemsisanith, a team captain, was injured while assisting on a tackle. 
</P>
<P>
He remained on the field at Western High School for 45 minutes before being 
taken by ambulance to Humana Hospital-West Anaheim for X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
"The X-rays were negative," said Dan Miller, boys' athletic director at 
Anaheim. "There's no spinal cord injury. He was given some pain pills and is 
being kept overnight. The doctors will check him in the morning and probably 
release him." 
</P>
<P>
Vince Flores caught two touchdown passes to lead Savanna to the Orange League 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Flores caught a nine-yard touchdown from Brad Belanger early in the first 
quarter. He added a 13-yard touchdown catch in the second quarter to make the 
score 14-7 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim's Brian Diaz, who scored twice, had an 86-yard fumble return that tied 
the score at 7-7 in the second quarter. Diaz's other touchdown came on a 
two-yard run in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna (4-2-2, 1-1-1 in league play) interceptedfour passes and forced two 
fumbles. Linebacker Paul Glomba intercepted two passes, returning one 53 yards 
for a touchdown to put Savanna ahead, 23-7. Leon Landry scored on a 30-yard run 
in the fourth quarter. Anaheim is 3-5, 1-2. SCOTT JONES

El Toro High School suffered its only loss in the South Coast League girls' 
volleyball race three weeks ago when the Chargers were swept in three games by 
Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers returned the favor Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro, ranked fifth in Orange County, pulled into a tie for the league lead 
with a 15-0, 17-15, 15-9 victory over fourth-ranked Capistrano Valley at El 
Toro. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the Chargers (12-3, 7-1 in league) a shot at the league title 
with two games remaining. Capistrano Valley dropped to 13-5, 7-1. 
</P>
<P>
Marta Bickert had 12 kills, Michelle Mauney 10 and Jamie Smith added nine in a 
balanced El Toro attack. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we had six girls kick some serious (butt)," El Toro Coach Mike Jagd 
said. "Everything we've been working on the last few weeks came together." 
</P>
<P>
After sweeping the first game, El Toro fought back from game point, 15-14, to 
win the second game. Smith and Wendy Bault each had a kill as El Toro pulled 
ahead by one, and the game ended on a Capistrano Valley hitting error. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro took control early in the third game, building a 7-2 lead behind the 
hitting of Bickert and Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Jagd said he was at fault in El Toro's earlier loss to Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I screwed up because I went with a different rotation every game," he said. 
"That confused us and we went out hesitant. 
</P>
<P>
"But right now, we're playing as well as can be expected. We have beaten Mira 
Costa, Laguna Beach and lost to Corona del Mar in five games." 
</P>
<P>
Tobi Roquemore and Tanya Mitchell each had nine kills and Allyson Carpenter 
added eight for Capistrano Valley. MIKE REILLEY

Greg Norman, who has played poorly for three months, dominated the par-five 
holes Thursday in a five-under-par 66 that gave him a share of the first-round 
lead with Tim Simpson in golf's richest tournament, the Nabisco Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, who holds the money-winning lead with $907,977, played the three 
par-five holes four under. 
</P>
<P>
He holed a 40-yard sand shot for eagle-3 on the fifth hole and birdied the 
other two. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson had seven birdies in his trek over the Cypress Creek course at 
Champions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's 7,400 yards if it's an inch," Simpson said of the par-71 layout that is 
listed at 7,187 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The players are chasing $3.5 million in individual prize money in the last 
official event on the PGA Tour schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Price overcame a double-bogey 6 on the 11th hole and was tied for third at 
68 with Jodie Mudd. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Mayfair and Chip Beck were next at 69. Davis Love and Peter Jacobsen, at 
70, were the only others to break par on the course that served as the site of 
the 1969 U.S. Open.

BEHIND THE WHEEL: SATURN; 
</P>
<P>
DETROIT FIGHTS BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Saturn cars -- General Motors' $3.5-billion gamble to stall Asian car sales 
and, conceivably, stay some fatal crumbling of the domestic auto industry -- 
advanced into the front line of Southern California this week. 
</P>
<P>
A brief but intense test drive forms a solid premise: That Saturn's three stars 
-- two shovel-fronted sedans priced from $7,995 and a handsome if generic 
sports coupe for $11,775 -- will play well. 
</P>
<P>
They will win new owners from that unhappy lot currently limping and rattling 
along in base Chevrolet Cavaliers, leftover Oldsmobile Omegas and other little 
domestic lumps that sacrificed performance and handling for the presumed 
economies of low price and high gas mileage. 
</P>
<P>
They will repatriate those who once truly wanted to Buy American but defected 
to Toyota, Honda, Mitsubishi and Nissan because Detroit knew nothing about 
building spirited and interesting compacts. 
</P>
<P>
On price alone -- $1,500 less than the Honda Civic DX and a full $2,000 below 
Toyota Corolla DLX -- Saturn is a three-car price war. 
</P>
<P>
They will certainly besot anyone who never expected to find such pleasantries 
as a multivalve engine and speed-sensitive steering and certainly not 
120-m.p.h. performance from a car costing $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Saturn -- by the amount of technology (vertical body surfaces of ding-resistant 
polymer) squeezed into budget surroundings -- clearly is the finest small car 
built by the American automobile industry since the 1933 Chevy Roadster. 
</P>
<P>
It is very good. 
</P>
<P>
But the best of Spring Hill is only as good as the cars the competition is 
shipping from Tokyo, Yokohama and Toyota City. 
</P>
<P>
It is not better than the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
And if the durability of Saturn should fail, if recalls occur, if its 
good-neighbor approach to customer assistance turns into a nightmare on Elm 
Street, Saturn will be quickly consigned to that Vehicle Valhalla wherein rest 
the smoldering remains of Edsel, Corvair and the Cadillac Cimarron. 
</P>
<P>
Such negativism, however, was far from the red, white and blue buoyancy that 
bounced from the cover of Time magazine and network newscasts this week as 
Saturn rolled into California dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
The debut was more of a dribble. 
</P>
<P>
Despite dozens of early orders, said general manager Mike Smith, just seven of 
the compact cars went to Saturn of Santa Ana. Six vehicles were delivered to 
Saturn of El Cajon. Only 11 of 45 cars ordered arrived at Saturn of the Valley 
in Sepulveda. Single-digit deliveries to California's five other Saturn dealers 
were the norm. 
</P>
<P>
The trickle, explained a spokesman, was deliberate. Saturn's production line in 
Spring Hill, Tenn., was slowed to squash petty eleventh-hour glitches with the 
cars. Better that vehicles be delayed, he said, than crucial first customers be 
dismayed. 
</P>
<P>
"It is just a matter of careful quality control," said Richard (Skip) LeFeuve, 
president of Saturn Corp. "The whole idea here was to begin to produce so that 
we could say: 'Look, the car's out there. You can go see it. You can go drive 
it and get some idea of what you want.' 
</P>
<P>
"You know, it's interesting. Everybody wants to talk quantity. All we want to 
do is talk quality. And if quality comes along, quantity comes with it." 
</P>
<P>
LeFeuve noted that for too long, automobile purchasers have functioned on a 
single basis: Buyer beware. With Saturn, he said, there is a fresh and total 
commitment: Customer rest assured. 
</P>
<P>
And if all that sounds like the death of the stereotypical car salesman, he 
continued, consider this: There are assembly line teams at Saturn that want to 
adopt dealerships "so that they can go visit . . . and if a problem comes up, 
the dealership can call direct to the team." 
</P>
<P>
Such tradition-smashing comes easily at Saturn, where the management philosophy 
leads to a production psychology that is best described as Hari Krishna meets 
Alvin Toffler. 
</P>
<P>
There is no hierarchy at the Saturn plant, only one team of 2,800 partners. 
Workers call their president Skip and everybody wears Saturn polo shirts to 
work. From LeFeuve to first gofer, all employees are salaried. Group hugging is 
encouraged more than coffee breaks and further tensions can be worked out on a 
Delta Force obstacle course. Remaining pressures may be eased through a 
"Decision Day" off, with pay, to contemplate the good, the bad and the 
profitable of life on Saturn. 
</P>
<P>
During this opening week in Southern California, the new Saturn division of 
General Motors (the first family addition since Chevrolet was born in 1918) 
continued to run over sacred cows: 
</P>
<P>
It introduced a line where there are no emblems, no designations separating 
base models from the top of the line. Call it inconspicuous consumption. "I 
don't know if we have destroyed a class system," LeFeuve said. "But we've sure 
taken a heck of a swat at it." 
</P>
<P>
Despite an official press rollout day in Tennessee, there were no meetings on 
either coast to introduce the Saturn line to local media. No local press drives 
were volunteered. Not even in California where, division officials agree, 
Saturn faces its toughest corps -- a die-hard market where imports comprise 50% 
(compared to 28% nationally) of new car purchases. 
</P>
<P>
"We just kind of took things as they were naturally happening and that included 
media when the opportunity came along," LeFeuve added. 
</P>
<P>
Our opportunity came along at a reunion of GM retirees who gathered on the new, 
hot and almost empty asphalt at Saturn of El Cajon for a first look at what 
their old firm has been up to. 
</P>
<P>
Saturn's initial offering -- but programmed to grow into the full inventory of 
wagons and convertibles -- starts with the SL/SL1 sports sedan at a base price 
of $7,995. The four-cylinder, single cam 1.9-liter engine develops 85 
horsepower. The entry-level SL is equipped with manual transmission only and 
the SL1 is stickered at $8,595. 
</P>
<P>
Next up is the SL2, which is much better trimmed (plastic wheel covers replaced 
by cast alloy wheels) and comes with the 16-valve, twin-cam engine and 123 
horsepower. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the obligatory SC sports coupe ($11,775) that has a slinkier look 
but mechanicals identical to the SL2. 
</P>
<P>
Saturn expects sales to be an even, three-way split. But if there is any 
customer leaning, said a representative, it should be toward the SL2 sports 
sedan. So we borrowed a blue one. 
</P>
<P>
In one major respect, Saturn is far from being a GM car. 
</P>
<P>
It was conceived eight years ago with designers doodling on a clean legal pad. 
The engine and transmission and chassis are new and uniquely Saturn. Unlike the 
flagrant parts-swapping of Chevrolet, Pontiac and Oldsmobile, no Saturn 
moldings, panels, suspension setups or internal accessories are cloned from 
existing GM vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Saturn, unmistakably, is a GM car. 
</P>
<P>
The front of the sedan slopes, reaches and sniffs, similar to the nose of the 
Pontiac Firebird. The rear window is Oldsmobile Cutlass. And is this sports 
coupe silhouette a Beretta we see before us? Or a Geo Storm? 
</P>
<P>
So the overall look is typically Detroit and that's about as predictable and as 
daring as the Erie Canal. 
</P>
<P>
The interior is pleasant, convenient, sensible and very well organized. In 
fact, it succeeds in all of the basics that GM's small cars have lacked since 
the Vega. 
</P>
<P>
Seat backs are better curved for upper body comfort and lower back bracing. The 
steering wheel is set further forward and is much better positioned for the 
longer of reach. Both placements are a direct contradiction of GM's design 
norms. 
</P>
<P>
Somebody did a lot of sitting and thinking and real driving in this quite 
spacious cabin. Consequently, oft-used radio controls are mounted high on the 
console. Lesser-used heating and climate controls are set lower. The east-west 
spokes of the three-pronged steering wheel curve downward so the analog dials 
receive maximum visibility. 
</P>
<P>
The turn signal stalk makes a click, not a crack. Release catches for the trunk 
and gas cap are on the floor, down and to the left, exactly where they belong. 
If that sounds reminiscent of the ideal Japanese car, then so be it. 
</P>
<P>
But Saturn does manage to go just one better. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has used a motorized shoulder belt system knows one psychological 
vagary: When the belt slides into place, drivers and passengers will almost 
always forget to use the double security of the lap belt. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturn, the shoulder belts slip snug. There is a five-second delay. Then a 
soft chime reminds occupants to buckle the lap strap and the reminder is hard 
to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
Then Saturn falls back a notch. 
</P>
<P>
An anti-lock brake system is an $895 option and air bags, said a Saturn 
representative, will not be on the cars until 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Saturn's mistake, he admitted. But air bags weren't an enormous consideration 
when the car was first designed. Now it's too late to work some simple, quick, 
inexpensive retrofit. 
</P>
<P>
The final cleverness of Saturn, however, is with the performance of the SL2. 
And not with what it can do but with what it is unable to do. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't do 160 m.p.h. It doesn't accelerate from zero to 60 in a sniff. It 
cannot be slung furiously around corners without ends slipping and protesting. 
</P>
<P>
Because, said president LeFeuve, the car was built for the Indiana family and 
not the Indianapolis hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
"We're almost paranoid about the Saturn consumer, the (product research) 
sessions we had with them and trying to give them exactly what they wanted," he 
explained. "This way, your engine can be simpler. That gives you higher 
reliability. And obviously, we're talking (lower) cost." 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is nothing dull about the handling and performance flexibility of 
Saturn. 
</P>
<P>
Mid-range acceleration on the freeways isn't an ear-flattener -- but you won't 
be left straining at the ramp or getting into embarrassing passing situations. 
</P>
<P>
Don't expect to be first away from every stoplight -- but you will be ahead of 
anyone in a pickup, van, most sport utilities and any Chevy Corsica. 
</P>
<P>
Do expect a nimbleness of steering and solid braking. The suspension is stiff 
enough to suggest a great predictability of handling. 
</P>
<P>
And when that suspension is being tested, when the car is hunkering on a line 
and doing something naughtier than normal, the Saturn is thoroughly 
well-behaved. 
</P>
<P>
Early trade magazine critiques of Saturn have noted much wind noise around 
doors and windows. We heard nothing, and that was one result of all that 
last-minute glitch-fixing at Spring Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Another carp concerned the buzziness of the Saturn engine, particularly when 
the car was being driven hard. We certainly cringed before that. Worse, the 
noise was coming from up front, where tappets and chains and metallic things 
slap and rattle. Not from the rear, where a good exhaust engineer might be able 
to convert it into some performance sound. 
</P>
<P>
In Detroit's frantic pursuit of automotive excellence as pioneered by Japanese 
cars, one objective has remained particularly elusive. Harmony. Oneness. That 
sense that a car was designed by consensus until all mechanical functions were 
in balance, all control pressures were equal and a driver's performance became 
relatively effortless. 
</P>
<P>
The Ford Escort, after several decades, was the first domestic car to make that 
mystique. 
</P>
<P>
Saturn is second and from an assembly line geared to improve as it goes. So the 
best of Saturn may be yet to come.

Still Not Satisfied: Marla Maples is not happy with the major profile of her in 
the current issue of Vanity Fair because the magazine used Cher on the cover. 
Maples claims she was promised the cover, and she felt the story was cut in 
half so the Cher story would fit. Vanity Fair Editor Tina Brown said she made 
no promises: "We tried it as a cover. In light of the gulf crisis, we thought a 
brunette was more appropriate."

Going Strong: James Michener says he plans to keep on writing five hours a day 
while he spends his winters teaching. The author said Wednesday that he and his

often fatal . . . . I try to keep my mind active." The author of "Hawaii" and 
"Centennial" said earlier this year he had written his last big book.

Sleep Rhythms: Comedian Jay Leno says he has become so good at his routine he 
can do it in his sleep. "When I do two two-hour shows . . . I get into the

<P>
Frail, neurasthenic Lily Van Velsen is a gemologist who specializes in the 
cutting of pearls, an exceedingly delicate art at which her great-uncle 
Mordecai was the grand master. Now that even the most costly pearls are 
cultured by introducing a bead into oysters' shells, pearl cutters are 
virtually extinct; their services required only when a rare antique gem must be 
matched. 
</P>
<P>
By peeling away the multiple skins of a natural pearl layer by layer, these 
highly trained experts can uncover a series of tints -- rose, green, blue, 
cream -- each exquisite, but only a phase in the revelation of the hidden 
pure-white globe. 
</P>
<P>
One slip of the miniature tools, one minuscule step too far in the search for 
perfection, and a magnificent pearl could dissolve into gray dust. 
</P>
<P>
Pearl cutters learn to contemplate before they cut, visualizing what lies 
beneath each successive color. Such recondite and fascinating lore has clearly 
captured the imagination of author Amy Wallace, who uses it as the matrix of 
"Desire," a novel as multilayered and mystical as the process itself. 
</P>
<P>
Mordecai Van Velsen, the aristocratic semi-invalid old man who lives with his 
equally ancient manservant, Chen Li, in a musty mansion in San Francisco's 
Pacific Heights has retired from Van Velsen Jewelers. Now he devotes himself to 
literature and philosophy, leaving the still-flourishing concern in the capable 
hands of Alan Purdue, Lily Van Velsen's devoted but stolid fiance. 
</P>
<P>
Orphaned in early childhood, Lily was brought up under the attentive 
supervision of her great-uncle, growing even closer to him as she matured; 
becoming his spiritual as well as his professional heir. She visits often, 
never leaving without an armful of books selected -- actually assigned -- by 
her great-uncle. 
</P>
<P>
When the novel opens, her reading material includes transcripts of letters 
written in 16th-Century France; fragments of Van Velsen family history. At that 
time and in that place, a young woman who became pregnant by an unsuitable 
young man was dispatched to a convent where she eventually went mad and died of 
thwarted love and grief. 
</P>
<P>
Thoroughly modern Lily is overcome by a psychic affinity for this tragic 
creature, and on an otherwise routine errand for Van Velsen Jewelers, she 
herself falls victim to a sexual obsession. 
</P>
<P>
The object of her passion is an arrogant sculptor with the power to awaken 
erotic desires never aroused by her gentle and affectionate fiance. Completely 
unstrung by her enslavement to the sculptor, Lily is afflicted by symptoms 
eerily similar to those of the 16th-Century French girl. In the throes of her 
anguish, unable to eat, sleep or work, Lily trails her great-uncle's manservant 
on his mysterious rounds of the city, finally to an opium den. 
</P>
<P>
This discovery leads her to a bout of opium addiction, and eventually, by an 
extremely circuitous route, to aspects of her great-uncle's history never 
suspected. Along the way, we're regaled with Mordecai Van Velsen's adventures 
as a young man, compelling in themselves and enlarging greatly our already 
expanded knowledge of pearls, but doing little to give this ambitious novel the 
cohesion it desperately needs. 
</P>
<P>
Just at the point when the entire invention might shatter like an overly worked 
pearl, a fragile connection is established. 
</P>
<P>
Though the realistic scenes in contemporary San Francisco are only functional, 
Amy Wallace is wonderfully adept at the far more demanding job of evoking the 
atmosphere of medieval France, re-creating the remote world of pearl divers in 
Ceylon, and imagining the atelier of the pearl maestro where Van Velsen learned 
his skills. 
</P>
<P>
There, in exotic and unexplored territory hundreds of years and thousands of 
miles from Van Velsen's shop at Maiden Lane and Grant Avenue, the author is 
truly at home.

Canada announced a plan to substantially boost immigration over the next five 
years while liberalizing rules to attract skilled workers to help fill critical 
shortages. Ethnic groups praised the increase, saying the Ottawa government is 
moving toward their demand to increase immigration to roughly equal 1% of 
Canada's population of 26 million. Immigration Minister Barbara McDougall

100,000 small shops and enterprises that were nationalized during four decades 
of Communist rule. The process is a key part of reforms aimed at transforming 
Czechoslovakia's centralized economy into a Western-style one guided by market 
forces. Vendors staged nationwide strikes last month demanding they be given 
first crack at buying the shops; instead, they will be sold off in a

EL CAMINO KICKER PEREZ IS STRUGGLING TO GET POINTS ACROSS; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNITY COLLEGES: FORMER CARSON HIGH STANDOUT SAID HE FEELS PRESSURED TO 
REGAIN HIS WINNING FORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When analyzing his career as a kicker at El Camino, sophomore Louis Perez feels 
like he is watching a tape of his football career at Carson High. 
</P>
<P>
"There's lots of pressure here just like at Carson, so I'm not doing as good 
this season," Perez said. "I came in this season with too much pressure on me." 
</P>
<P>
It is basically a rerun of high school where Perez did great as a sophomore and 
junior but struggled as a senior. Perez broke virtually every Carson record. He 
holds school records for career kick scoring (136 points) and points after 
touchdowns (103). 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore in 1986 he helped Carson win the City 4-A Division title by 
making all of his PATs. As a junior in 1987 he was an All-City selection. 
Carson lost to Granada Hills in the City 4-A final. 
</P>
<P>
Perez said he struggled early in his senior year although he came back to set a 
school single-season PAT (51) record. Carson won the City 4-A championship, but 
Perez did not make the All-City team. 
</P>
<P>
"I got off to a real shaky start," he said. "I was expected to do as well as I 
did in 10th and 11th grade and I didn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
He said the same thing is happening to him at El Camino, where he earned 
All-Mission Conference and All-State honors as a freshman when he made 38 of 40 
PATs and 11 of 15 field goals. The Warriors finished 10-1. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, 19, believes everyone expected him to repeat the feat this season. He 
started football practice 15 pounds overweight and his concentration has not 
been sharp. More than anything, he feels pressured. 
</P>
<P>
His high school coach, Ishmal Ordonez, said other kickers go through the same 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Kickers are lonely players," said Ordonez, a former soccer player in his 
native Mexico who has coached the kickers at Carson since 1977. "They stand 
there watching the other guys and when they need him, he has to do the job and 
he can't mess up. He's always expected to make it. A quarterback can miss a 
pass but, a kicker is not supposed to miss, ever. That's a lot of pressure for 
a young kid." 
</P>
<P>
This season Perez has made 28 of 30 extra points, but he's struggled with field 
goals, making only five of 10. In El Camino's 31-24 loss to Fullerton, Perez 
missed back-to-back field goals from 41 and 43 yards. He also missed two field 
goals against Saddleback and one against Rancho Santiago in Mission Conference 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I was nervous," said the 5-foot-11, 180-pound Perez. "I got blocked in 
my first field goal attempt in the first game against Ventura and from then on 
I've been getting nervous. I've been afraid of getting blocked." 
</P>
<P>
Last week Perez got rid of the nervousness. He made all four PATs and two field 
goal attempts in El Camino's 38-14 victory over Cerritos. The victory snapped a 
two-game losing streak for the Warriors, who are 5-2 overall and 3-2 in 
conference action heading into Saturday's game against Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Warrior Coach John Featherstone believes a combination of factors are 
responsible for Perez's accuracy problems. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not applying himself in as determined a manner as last year," 
Featherstone said. "Louis is not as dedicated as he was a year ago. I think 
that has to do with the fact that he's not being pushed. There's no competition 
for him on the team. He's our only kicker." 
</P>
<P>
Perez said: "Last year if I missed they had someone else. This year if I miss 
there's no one else to go in, so I know I'll always play." 
</P>
<P>
Featherstone also believes that playing soccer is hurting Perez's football 
career. Perez is in his second season as a midfielder on the El Camino soccer 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"He's overworked and he's tired," Featherstone said. "His leg is tired and his 
feet are tired. He runs up and down the field during soccer games and he's 
tired for us, but I can't force him to quit." 
</P>
<P>
Perez disagrees: "The mistakes I've made, the downfall I've had, has nothing to 
do with soccer, that's for sure. I proved it last week. It's all mental. My 
mistakes have been mental mistakes, not physical ones." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino soccer Coach Norm Jackson sides with Featherstone. He suggested to 
Perez that he stick to one sport. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he is getting worn out, to be honest with you," Jackson said. "He 
could be a very good soccer player, but we need to have him full time. At the 
moment he's not fit to play soccer. My recommendation is that he stay with 
football because he has a chance of getting a scholarship in football." 
</P>
<P>
Perez has played in American Youth Soccer Organization leagues since he was 13 
and has also competed on several South Bay 19-and-under clubs, but he too 
believes his future is in football. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior at Carson he was recruited by several colleges including Washington 
State, Oklahoma, Oregon State and Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
He ended up at El Camino because he failed to score 700 on the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test. Under Proposition 48, athletes who don't score 700 on the SAT 
can get scholarships to four-year colleges but they cannot play as freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
Ordonez said it was unfortunate because Perez was one of the state's hottest 
kickers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a chance to coach some pretty good kickers and he's one of the best 
and most powerful," Ordonez said. "I'd put my hand in the fire for him. He's a 
powerful kicker who can do the job at any major college." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino defensive coordinator Walt Justice agrees. He works with Perez and 
said several Southeastern Conference and Big Ten schools have expressed an 
interest in the kicker. 
</P>
<P>
"He definitely has the leg and if he concentrates on football the sky is the 
limit for him," Justice said.

CITY BASKETBALL TEAMS FACE EARLIER START FOR 1991-92 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A school calendar scheduled to be implemented in July throughout the Los 
Angeles Unified School District might force City Section league basketball 
seasons in 1991-92 and beyond to be completed before an eight-week recess for 
most schools begins in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that we must reschedule basketball season," City Section 
Commissioner Hal Harkness said. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of the new calendar on winter sports would be severe, Harkness told 
City basketball and soccer coaches this week. 
</P>
<P>
Under a proposal, the basketball season would begin the first week of November 
-- three weeks earlier than usual -- and playoffs would be held the first two 
weeks in January even though a majority of the City's 49 high schools would be 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
Because the basketball season would begin during the fall, teams would be 
ineligible for the state basketball playoffs, which begin in March. 
</P>
<P>
Other problems with the new schedule are apparent, according to Dick Browning, 
a district administrator and member of a committee that studied the effect on 
athletics of the new school calendar. 
</P>
<P>
"Facilities problems are major," Browning said. "Soccer and football, which use 
the same fields, would overlap. So would basketball, wrestling and volleyball, 
which all use gymnasiums. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no obvious answers. Things are real complicated. We are seeking 
input from coaches or anyone who has some ideas."

A TIGER'S TRAIL; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER MOVING FROM SCHOOL TO SCHOOL, PRIZED BACK LEONICE BROWN DISCOVERS HE 
BELONGED AT SAN FERNANDO ALL ALONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
All that was visible was a helmet, shoes the size of those that some folks hang 
from their rear-view mirrors, and a football. Somewhere, encased in all that 
equipment, was the body of a 7-year-old running back bent on reaching the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
Or so it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids are so small you can't tell the linemen from the backs," Leonice 
Brown said as he surveyed a practice of the San Fernando Braves, a youth team. 
"They're all the same size." 
</P>
<P>
A dozen years ago, Brown was a mighty mite running back too. Same team. Same 
field. Same feeling. He gets a mite wistful thinking about it. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was little, I broke a 99-yarder," Brown said with a wave of a hand. "I 
still remember it. I took it straight up the middle and sprinted. All the way 
from there to there." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past three seasons, Brown has been there and back, although it was 
never in an end-zone beeline. From his home in Pacoima to Westlake Village. 
From Westlake High to Crespi in Encino. From Crespi to San Fernando High, where 
a Pop Warner practice prompted a flood of memories. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's blood had been spilled on the field long before Leonice cut his teeth 
with the Braves. His half-brother, Charles White, was an All-City Section 
player for San Fernando in 1974 and '75. His nephew, Russell White, starred for 
the North Valley Golden Bears before breaking the state rushing record at 
Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
You see, San Fernando is steeped in tradition. A wall in the coach's office has 
photos of several former All-City players -- 54 have been honored in the 
school's 75 seasons of football -- and the team consistently draws the biggest 
crowds on the Valley floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I love this field," said Brown, whose Tigers will play host to rival Granada 
Hills in a key Northwest Valley Conference game tonight at 8. "I grew up here." 
</P>
<P>
Maturity is a continual process. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is the kind of running back who makes defenses palpitate. As a 
ninth-grader, Brown ran 200 meters in 22.8 seconds; he has been timed at 10.9 
in the 100 meters and is the fastest member of the Tiger team. San Fernando 
Coach Tom Hernandez says most of the schools west of the Rockies are sending 
mountains of mail to Brown, who has been described as mobile, elusive and 
agile. 
</P>
<P>
He runs darn well with a football too, which is what started Brown's odd little 
odyssey in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Naivete can be brutal and Leonice Brown knows it. For a time, he believed he 
had stumbled on the silver spoon. Eventually, the main course started tasting 
peculiar. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was one of four Pacoima sports standouts who moved in with Westlake 
Village businessman Buzz Holcomb in the summer of 1988. Others included Mukasa 
Crowe, now at Chatsworth High, and Ontiwaun Carter, now at Kennedy. Brian 
Brison, the fourth member of the group, enrolled at Alemany and later 
transferred to San Fernando. He now attends school in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Holcomb assumed legal guardianship of the athletes and planned to enroll them 
at Westlake High, prompting a storm of criticism from several coaches, 
including Hernandez. They accused Holcomb of recruiting the group for athletic 
purposes. Holcomb said he merely was offering the boys a chance to escape the 
mean streets of Pacoima, much of which happens to fall within San Fernando 
High's attendance boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
A Southern Section inquiry exonerated Holcomb of the recruiting charges and 
cleared the way for the group's eligibility, but by then the plan was coming 
apart at the seams. Carter bolted the Holcomb fold during the investigation, 
returned to Pacoima and registered at Kennedy. Crowe left Westlake soon 
thereafter and enrolled at Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the plan was flawed from the beginning and conceded that the four 
had not adapted to the affluent Westlake environment. In fact, Brown said he 
would routinely head home on weekends to hang out with Carter and other 
schoolboy friends from Pacoima's Maclay Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big mix-up," Brown said. "I met Holcomb, he had my mind going. I 
wanted to go to Westlake, but then I saw the school and I just didn't like it." 
</P>
<P>
Holcomb suggested that Brown enroll at Crespi, where Russell White -- whose 
father Roosevelt is Brown's half-brother -- was rewriting the state record 
book. Brown said he dreamed of making fans cry uncle. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I had seen Crespi play, with all the crowd and all the big linemen, I 
thought, 'Yeah!' 
</P>
<P>
"I was up in the stands thinking, 'That could be me when (Russell) leaves.' I 
thought it was the right choice." 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Brown's travels ended in travail. As a sophomore at Crespi, Brown 
rushed 25 times for 122 yards and served primarily as White's caddy. Meanwhile, 
Carter rushed for 1,190 yards as a sophomore starter at Kennedy, and the seeds 
of discontent had been sown. Brown now calls his decision to attend Crespi a 
"mistake" and "a waste." 
</P>
<P>
"That year hurt me, I mean, it made me really think about things," he said. "It 
made me want to quit. (After) growing up playing, sitting on the bench the 
whole time was just a waste." 
</P>
<P>
After White graduated, Brown was installed as the Celts' starting tailback in 
1989 and he gained 1,097 yards and scored nine touchdowns. By season's end, 
however, Brown was on the ropes. And back on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on who tells the story, Brown left Crespi because he either was 
facing academic ineligibility or was unhappy with the way he was utilized by 
the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I get one version from him and another from other people," said White, now a 
sophomore at California. "I hear he just wasn't doing the (academic) work, but 
he says he had some other problems, that he just wasn't happy there." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he was not in hot academic water when he left Crespi -- school 
officials won't comment on Brown's scholastic standing -- and believes that he 
should have been allowed to carry the ball more often. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's itinerary would include a third stop in as many years, and, after he 
transferred to San Fernando last spring, his high school career had come full 
circle. 
</P>
<P>
A City Section committee ruled that Brown had satisfied the California 
Interscholastic Federation's criteria for financial hardship and granted him 
athletic eligibility at San Fernando -- the public school that many of his 
boyhood friends attend. 
</P>
<P>
To hear Brown tell it now, this is where he should have been all along. 
</P>
<P>
"If your address is to a school, go straight to that school," Brown said. 
"Don't change your mind. Don't. That's a big mistake." 
</P>
<P>
It did not take long for Brown to do it right as a San Fernando ballcarrier. 
Late last season, Hernandez decided to reinstitute the Tigers' storied 
wishbone, which once was fueled by Leonice's half-brother, Charles White. 
</P>
<P>
After six games, Brown has rolled up a team-high 484 yards and eight touchdowns 
in 71 carries and he could become the first Tiger back to top the 1,000-yard 
plateau since Chris Richards in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Richards was the most recent of San Fernando's many big-play backs, a legacy of 
which Brown is both aware and leery. Before Richards there was brother Charles, 
who won a Heisman Trophy at USC and an NFL rushing title with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
The blood that pumps through Brown's heart also makes it race, for like his 
nephew Russell, his relationship with Charles has been disappointing. Brown, in 
fact, prefers not to discuss his famous brother. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, I feel that he should have come home and visited my mother more," Brown 
said as he stared straight ahead. "Sometimes I see my mother hurting, I know 
she's hurt. She tries not to show it, but I know. 
</P>
<P>
"I promised myself that I'm not going to go his way. It's like we're talking 
now, when people bring up his name, I'm always (saying,) 'Change it.' I don't 
want to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
But Brown and his two younger brothers, Johnnie and Jerry, have thought about 
it -- at length. 
</P>
<P>
"We love him, he's our brother and everything, but when he comes around . . . 
It's basically, 'Hey, how you doing?' " 
</P>
<P>
Yet Brown wears No. 12, the number worn by Charles while at San Fernando and 
USC. Johnnie, a sophomore at San Fernando, likely will wear No. 12 when Leonice 
graduates. Jerry, an eighth-grader, also likely will wear the jersey when 
Johnnie graduates. 
</P>
<P>
"I wore No. 25 when he was with the Cleveland Browns and I went to No. 33 when 
he was with the Rams," Leonice said of his decision to copy Charles' choice of 
uniform number. "But when he stopped coming around, I went my own way and got 
my own number at Crespi, No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got back here, I went to No. 12. It's the family tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Russell disrupted the tradition when he decided to attend Crespi, a private 
parochial school. Like Leonice, Russell had been a San Fernando High ball boy 
as a kid and was viewed as salvation in cleats. But Russell chose Crespi partly 
because it offered a better academic curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, White questioned the wisdom of Brown's transfer to San Fernando -- on 
athletic and academic grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Wood shop doesn't satisfy college requirements," said White, who was a 
Proposition 48 casualty as a freshman. "Being a T.A. (teacher's aide) doesn't 
satisfy college requirements. He's gonna find out out that colleges won't take 
you because of your name. 
</P>
<P>
"And if he's only carrying the ball eight times (actually, nearly 12) a game, I 
don't see that. . . . I hope it works out like he wants it to." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said he is trying to work out the kinks in Brown's academic portfolio 
and predicts that the NCAA-required core classes will be completed. Brown has 
yet to score 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test -- required by the NCAA to 
gain eligibility as a college freshman -- but will retake the exam next 
weekend, Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
It did not take long for Brown to fall in step philosophically. He says 
tonight's game against Granada Hills is the most important of his career. 
Kennedy tailback Carter, whom he considers his best friend, long has chided 
Brown about the difficulty of playing against faster and more explosive City 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
"He's like, 'Yeah, you played St. Francis. Why don't you come to a City league 
and see what you get?' 
</P>
<P>
"I can't wait to get Granada on this field," he said, breaking into another 
smile. "It is the biggest game of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Judging by Brown's fervent tone, Hernandez has found himself a real Tiger. This 
time, the end zone marked the terminus of Brown's trail. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been through a lot," Brown said, rubbing a hand across his mouth. "I've 
been from city to city. Man, I know the freeways. I learned you should always 
stay home." 
</P>
<P>
Brown took another long look at the Braves as they skittered about the San 
Fernando High field, looking like a collection of ceramic sports dolls, the 
kind whose oversized heads bounce from side to side on springs. You know, the 
kind of doll that some folks place in their car's rear windows. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's thoughts were as easy to read as the dive plays the Braves were running 
a few feet in front of him. Things sure were simple then. 
</P>
<P>
Even at age 18, it isn't easy to look back. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had to do it all over again, I would go to San Fernando High School," he 
said. "I would be a Tiger. This is where I belonged in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
He swears it's his last place. 
</P>
<P>
"Home sweet home," he said.

TORRES JOINS LIST OF INJURED BACKS AT CANYON BUT A STARTER RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After enduring the losses of running back David McDivitt and backups Mark 
Santos and Craig Reiter to injury, Canyon High suffered another blow when it 
was learned that fullback-turned-tailback Mike Torres sustained ligament damage 
to a knee during last week's win over Antelope Valley and must sit out 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really down," Canyon Coach Harry Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of Torres was partially cushioned by the news that McDivitt, Canyon's 
first-string tailback who was injured in a Sept. 7 win over Hart, tonight will 
be making his first start since that game. 
</P>
<P>
McDivitt, who has been sidelined for five weeks because of a deep thigh bruise, 
should carry the ball 10 to 15 times against Palmdale if all goes well, Welch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's gonna start and he's gonna limp," Welch said. "He'll be a shadow of 
himself but will carry it for us if he doesn't get injured. He's gotta stay 
healthy." 
</P>
<P>
That seems to be no easy task for Canyon running backs these days. 
</P>
<P>
Opportunist: St. Francis wide receiver Pat Escamilla does not often carry the 
ball, but he has made the most of his opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Escamilla has rushed for 164 yards in only six carries -- all coming on 
inside-reverse counter plays. In the first game of the season against 
Burroughs, Escamilla carried twice and scored on 61- and 26-yard runs. 
</P>
<P>
Last week against El Segundo, he ran 55 yards for a score in his only carry. 
</P>
<P>
"He's predominantly a strong safety," St. Francis Coach Bill Garrison said. 
"And when we do put him in at wide receiver, it's primarily for blocking. It's 
just a freak thing. We've had other wide receivers run the same play and they 
haven't been able to break it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that whenever the other team sees No. 29 coming in from now on, 
they'll be watching for him." 
</P>
<P>
Injuries: Chaminade junior Travis Hall, a starting defensive back who also 
split playing time with Jeff Meyer at quarterback, is out for the season after 
sustaining a broken collarbone last week. . . . Chaminade all-purpose player 
Ted Corcoran suffered a broken rib in the Eagles' 41-7 loss to Alemany on Oct. 
12 but that didn't keep him out of last week's game against Crespi. Corcoran, 
the team's leading scorer with 15 points, has played at kicker, punter, 
fullback and linebacker, but he will play exclusively on defense for the rest 
of the season. . . . Monroe's Fabian Speights, a two-way starter at tight end 
and linebacker, also will miss the rest of the season. Speights, a senior, 
suffered a torn knee ligament in the Vikings' 21-6 loss to Sylmar on Oct. 5.

<TEXT>
<P>
Tonight, USD's soccer season really begins. It could also end. 
</P>
<P>
USD plays host to No. 6 Santa Clara, NCAA co-defending champion, in a 7:30 game 
at Torero Stadium that could decide the West Coast Conference championship and 
the automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Toreros (14-1-4, 1-1) are ranked No. 16, their highest ranking ever, and 
have won eight in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos (10-2-3, 1-1-0) last year pinned a 5-0 loss on USD and have won 
four in a row. They are led by senior midfielder Jeff Baicher, who has assisted 
on 12 goals this year and scored four others. Junior goalie Chris Bauer has a 
0.80 goals-against average and five shutouts, including four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Toreros have six players who have reached double figures in scoring: junior 
forward Paul Gelvezon (nine goals, seven assists -- 25 points), senior 
midfielder Leo Ronces (6-7 -- 19), senior midfielder Ton Crane (6-6 -- 18), 
sophomore forward Charles Adair (5-8 -- 18), sophomore midfielder Phillip 
Button (7-2 -- 16), and freshman midfielder Toby Taitano (3-9 -- 15). JIM

Intel Seeks Action in AMD Dispute: Intel said it would seek court action to 
prevent an arbitrator from awarding substantial monetary damages to Advanced 
Micro Devices in the controversy over the 386 microprocessor. The arbitrator 
ruled earlier this month that Intel had breached a licensing contract with AMD 
and said a clause in the contract barring most monetary damages was invalid. 
AMD is seeking $500 million and the rights to the 386.

'PALACE' MENU HAS A PRIME SARANDON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the searingly well-acted "White Palace" (throughout San Diego County), ad 
man Max Baron (James Spader), very drunk and not a little sorry for himself, 
seeks out a blue-collar bar on his way home from a St. Louis bachelor party. 
</P>
<P>
It's already been a bum night. He's had a sudden, tangible reminder of his 
young wife, Janey, dead for barely two years. He has had a stinging exchange 
with a waitress at White Palace, a fast-food joint that shortchanged him on the 
bulk order of burgers he was to bring to the party. 
</P>
<P>
At the bar, that same waitress, Nora Baker (Susan Sarandon), her surliness 
softened by the amount she has had to drink, picks him up with an offer to bury 
the hatchet. It's astonishing the gradations of distaste that Spader can convey 
in less than a minute, from aversion to repulsion to polite contempt, but she 
won't be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Her string of personal questions finally makes him blurt out that his wife 
hasn't left him, she died. While this registers, Max waits for Nora's mortified 
apology. Instead, after a long moment, she laughs, an earthy, utterly 
uninhibited laugh at the sheer craziness of life -- his, her own, everyone's. 
</P>
<P>
It's as shocking to Max, who is fishing for sympathy, as it is to the audience 
and a signal that this movie about the capricious nature of sexual attraction 
is going to be nicely unpredictable -- at least until its last reel. It's also 
a grand introduction to Nora, one of life's straight-shooters, and probably 
Sarandon's most complex, blazingly vibrant performance, topping even the magnum 
women of "Bull Durham" and "Atlantic City." 
</P>
<P>
Nora is the living equivalent of that towering, earth-planted, melon-breasted 
bronze by Gaston Lachaise, who surveys her gaping onlookers with such absolute 
assurance. Mercifully, director Luis Mandoki doesn't want Sarandon to play a 
life force; he wants a raunchy, fallible, wounded real person -- different 
enough from anyone Max has ever encountered to snap his head clear around. 
Sarandon obliges with gusto. 
</P>
<P>
For Max, their first lovemaking is primal, full of smells and sounds and 
sensations unlike any in his 27 years. She likes it just fine too. Director 
Mandoki, who was equally lucid about the sexuality of his cerebral-palsied 
heroine in "Gaby -- a True Story," stages this cataclysmic encounter with a 
touching coda the next morning: Nora, muzzily half-asleep on the sofa bed, 
certainly real and also exquisitely beautiful in cinematographer Lajos Koltai's 
painterly lenses. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the easy stuff. Attraction is simple; it's life that's hard. Never 
expecting to see her again, Max is drawn back and gradually out of his 
little-old-man shell. She tells him forthrightly she's 43; he tells her he's a 
total wreck without her -- and a different kind of total wreck with her. But 
what to do about the man who loves Mozart and the woman whose heart is with the 
Oak Ridge Boys? With the self-proclaimed "Hoosier" in her greasy apron and the 
fastidious yuppie? 
</P>
<P>
Is there a chance for such mismatches, once they come up for air? More so in 
the complex book than in the movie. In restricting this relationship as much as 
they have, screenwriter Ted Tally and Alvin Sargent give them less of a chance 
than Glenn Savan's original novel did. 
</P>
<P>
The screenwriters are good at the boredom that inevitably surfaces, even with 
couples this physically enthralled. They are deft at sketching Max's crowd, all 
Jewish, all aggressively yuppified -- some might call them stereotyped. They 
are clear about the embarrassment Max feels about bringing Nora into this 
crowd, with her tacky clothes and forthright, unpredictable mouth. 
</P>
<P>
So, why doesn't he do something about bridging the gap? Unsurprisingly, she's 
furious when he brings her household gadgets, and she's proud; is there some 
rule that he couldn't get her a sweater, a decent coat? Could he try "Opera 
Goes to the Movies" to introduce her to the music he loves? It's kitschy enough 
to hook any romantic. 
</P>
<P>
With Sarandon as Nora, audiences want more from Max, more of an effort, more 
steel, less moral puppy fat. She's enough to make one see that youth, by 
itself, or even youth and money, isn't quite all there is. 
</P>
<P>
The novel, making clear his background, his relationship with his working-class 
mother (Renee Taylor), made Max exist in far less of a vacuum and gave us a 
greater sense of his capacity to become something quite beyond the rest of his 
friends. His mother's friendship with Nora was a nice note, too -- quite gone 
in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
Max's clear sign of change comes at the end of a touching scene with Eileen 
Brennan, marvelous as Nora's estranged older sister, a woman with genuine 
mystical gifts. Touched by the insight he's been given into Nora's past, Max 
warms up almost tangibly, for the first time loving her, frailties and all. 
Although peculiar casting, Spader is fine throughout and terribly moving in 
this scene. It's not exactly the rainbow bridge to the movie's hyper-romantic 
ending, with its overtones of "An Officer and a Gentleman," but it's a start. 
</P>
<P>
"White Palace" (rated R for its uninhibited love scenes and Nora's coarse 
language) is more than a start for director Mandoki, who was sturdily launched 
with "Gaby"; it's a continued indication of a sure and powerful sensitivity. 
Producers Mark Rosenberg, Amy Robinson and Griffin Dunne, with executive 
producer Sydney Pollack, have seen to it that the film has a flawless mounting: 
Koltai's lush cinematography; Jeannine C. Oppewall's production designs, 
perfect at both the high and low ends of St. Louis; Lisa Jensen's witty, 
unexaggerated costumes and Carol Littleton's succinct editing. Among this 
excellent cast, fans of "Gaby" will be pleased to see its star, Rachel Levin, 
here as the bubbly bride and tireless matchmaker also named Rachel.

Freudian Fever: Native son Sigmund Freud is still loved in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Advance ticket sales for the new musical "Freudiana" have been brisk, even 
outpacing early sales for Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Cats" 7 years ago. The 
musical, based on the life of the father of modern psychology, opens Dec. 19. 
More than 59,000 tickets -- 47% of the available seats for the first four 
months of performances -- were snatched up in the first 30 days. CLAUDIA PUIG

Boycott, He Urged: The co-chairman of Proposition 140, Lewis K. Uhler, is 
calling for a viewer boycott of the CBS mystery "Murder, She Wrote" and its 
sponsors if a commercial with its star, Angela Lansbury, opposing Propositions 
131 and 140 remains on the air. Uhler's ire was raised after Lansbury said in 
the ad that if Propositions 131 and 140 pass, "millions of your tax dollars 
will go to politicians' campaigns" -- an apparent reference to provisions of 
Proposition 131 that would set up a system for public financing of campaigns. 
However, Proposition 140 has nothing to do with campaign financing. CLAUDIA

No Horse Jumps, Says Barker: Game-show host and animal-rights activist Bob 
Barker wants people to boycott a film in which horses jump from a 10-foot 
platform into an 11-foot-deeptank of water. "Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken," 
which is being filmed in Myrtle Beach, S.C., is about a woman who rode the 
famous Steel Pier diving horse in Atlantic City, N.J., during the 1930s. Lou 
Philips, production executive for the movie, said that producers have exceeded 
American Humane Assn. standards.Claudia Puig

AT THE GALLERIES: A TALE OF 2 STUDENTS AT PALOMAR COLLEGE GALLERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEAH OLLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Louise Kirtland-Boehm, director of Palomar College's Boehm Gallery (no 
relation) is what all good curators should be: a talent scout. In addition to 
mounting shows of such established local artists as Ernest Silva, Faiya Fredman 
and Raul Guerrero, she has made a habit of canvassing schools for emerging 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, she organized a group show of students working toward their master of 
fine arts degrees at San Diego State University and UC San Diego. The show 
helped introduce new work to the community while testing the integrity of the 
work outside its own native academic environment. By presenting a variety of 
work reflecting a breadth of approaches, the 1988 "MFA/SDSU/UCSD" show also 
helped dispel stereotypes associated with the two universities' art 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Kirtland-Boehm has selected just one student each from the two 
schools for a show (through Nov. 21) with the same title as its precedent. Both 
M. Luera of SDSU and UCSD's Gary Boswell show promise, a consideration of 
primary importance in this type of show. Both have achieved a respectable 
technical maturity and an interest in evocative themes, but neither manages yet 
to present a rich, enduring and fully evolved body of work. 
</P>
<P>
The figures in Luera's series of paintings, collectively titled "Invented 
Lives," loom larger than life in scale and in their glowing, cinematic 
vibrancy. They press against the edges of each canvas, creating a visual 
tension that Luera matches with ambiguous and often unsettling visions of men 
in conversation, in communion and in conflict. 
</P>
<P>
In "Men in Boat," two shirtless men flank a central, fully dressed passenger. 
The man in the immediate foreground seems to be whispering affectionately into 
the ear of the man in the middle, while the figure in the rear shifts his gaze 
to the side and continues to row. 
</P>
<P>
"Men in Suits with Youth" also shows a man sandwiched between two others, but 
this time the younger man in the center wears no shirt, and those in front and 
back wear matching suits. Here also, it is the man in the foreground who makes 
contact with the central figure, but his gesture is less gentle than that of 
the man in the boat. He presses his hand against the youth's jaw, and though 
the young man smiles, his expression seems forced and uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
A similar confrontation takes place in "Men with Fish," where two men, 
waist-deep in water, share an ambiguous, awkward moment. One of the figures 
wears an expression midway between a scowl and a laugh as he pulls back a 
younger man's head by his hair. By painting the younger man's eyes closed, 
Luera denies his face an easy read and instead gives it the simultaneous 
expression of passion and pain. 
</P>
<P>
Luera borrows much of her strategy of subverting familiar images and ordinary 
relationships from the New York painter Eric Fischl. Like Fischl, she paints 
large, lifelike figures in casual but ambiguous situations, mixing the clothed 
and the semi-nude, the young and the older for suggestive effect. Her men have 
tremendous physical presence, but she doesn't consistently endow them with 
enough psychological depth to sustain that presence. As a result, the paintings 
verge on the superficial and sensational. 
</P>
<P>
Boswell's neighboring installation, "Semaphore Horizon," deals more with the 
cerebral than the sensual, perhaps to a fault, but the work does induce a 
physical self-consciousness that slows the pace and prompts new perceptions. A 
semaphore, the signaling device commonly used on railways, never appears in a 
literal form, but other modes of marking location and direction fill the 
gallery's walls and floor. 
</P>
<P>
A compass is mounted on one wall, an arch of cutout, painted arrows hovers high 
on another, near a formation of drawings of eyes, in the shape of the big 
dipper constellation. A painting of blue, hazy sky with a single feather 
attached to the surface alludes to determinations of wind direction and force. 
Newspaper pages, strewn across one long wall, are covered with stenciled text 
repeating a phrase about the various positions of the body during sleep. On a 
tree branch, covered in gold leaf, hangs a piece of cloth, as if a marking of 
one's path in the woods. 
</P>
<P>
None of these navigational systems is functional here -- the compass is fixed 
to the wall, and the feather to the painting -- but all of them do evoke an 
acute awareness of one's position in space, one's movement and direction. By 
presenting these systems outside of their normal, useful context, Boswell draws 
attention to them as abstract notations, symbolic languages in themselves. They 
become abstract, poetic phrases punctuating the austere gallery walls, 
important clues with no real meaning of their own. 
</P>
<P>
ARTISTS' OPPORTUNITIES: 
</P>
<P>
Sushi Gallery is issuing an open call for proposals for its sixth annual public 
art program. For "StreetSites '91," Sushi will commission several temporary, 
site-specific projects at public locations within the city. The program is open 
to all artists living in San Diego County. Selected artists will receive $2,000 
to create their work. For more information, call Sushi (235-8466) or attend a 
"technical assistance" meeting at the gallery (852 8th Ave., downtown) on 
Monday, Nov. 5, at 7 p.m. The deadline for proposals is Monday, Nov. 26 at 5 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Carlsbad Arts Office is seeking proposals from local artists interested in 
participating in two of its annual programs. The Grants program will award 
$20,000 this year to fund cultural and artistic projects in Carlsbad. Artists 
in all media and not-for-profit institutions are eligible, but individual 
artists must be sponsored by a not-for-profit organization. Grant applications 
must be received by Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Proposals are also sought for Carlsbad's Artist-in-Residence program, which 
aims to involve Carlsbad citizens in creative experiences. Projects will be 
conducted in schools or community organizations. Last year, residency grants 
were awarded for a dancer and a storyteller, who conducted three-month-long 
projects in Carlsbad schools. Proposals must be received by Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
For more information about applications and eligibility for both programs, call 
the Carlsbad Arts Office at 434-2920.

REPORTER INFILTRATES TABLOID IN 'THE MAN INSIDE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took writer-director Bobby Roth 10 years to make "The Man Inside" -- a 
fact-based melodrama about West German reporter Gunter Wallraff and his 
infiltration of a reactionary tabloid -- and the effort shows. 
</P>
<P>
There's something worked-over, almost perfunctory about the film (AMC Century 
14 and Beverly Center Cineplex). It's sleek, it's fast, but it has a hollow, 
exhausted feel. It's less a film than a dream of a film, an obsession that 
eluded Roth, but which, with incredible stubbornness and will power, he kept 
seizing and renewing. 
</P>
<P>
Set in 1975, it's about the efforts of left-wing, "outlaw" investigative 
journalist Wallraff (the movie's only non-fictitious name) to crack the shield 
of West Germany's most influential tabloid, Der Bilt -- here called "The 
Standard." 
</P>
<P>
Wallraff, played by Jurgen Prochnow of "Das Boot," is a specialist in false 
papers and disguises. Here, he smuggles himself into the paper and becomes, 
with unusual rapidity, one of its ace reporters, the darling of its scowling, 
Sturm und Drang editor Schroeter (Dieter Laser), who helps school him in the 
art of slick, shoddy, callous reporting and flagrant propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
The Standard has ties to West Germany's security chief, and it's hinted that a 
neo-fascist conspiracy fuels its editorial policy. Wallraff burrows into that 
conspiracy even as the Standard and the security apparatus are outside, unaware 
of his penetration, systematically trying to hunt him down. 
</P>
<P>
The movie has the rhythm and shape of docudrama, but the look and sound of 
stripped-down kitsch. The Standard -- supposedly West Germany's most popular 
tabloid -- has unusually Spartan quarters. Four star reporters, including 
Wallraff and fellow ace Henry Tobel (Peter Coyote), are grouped around a sort 
of mass conference desk, where they're constantly subjected to the perfervid 
abuse and menacing affections of editor Schroeter, who dispenses his favors 
through story length ("20 lines" is a mild rebuke, "40 lines" a reward), orders 
his staff to attack the poor and different, hail the rich and link up every 
conceivable strain of dissent with the Baader-Meinhof Gang. 
</P>
<P>
Like Costa-Gavras -- a heavy influence here -- Roth likes to suggest homosexual 
motivations in his villains; both Schroeter and Tobel seem to fall in love with 
Wallraff on sight. Coyote seizes on this undercurrent. In a cast loaded with 
top international names, including Prochnow, Nathalie Baye, Monique van de Ven 
and Philip Anglim, his is the only performance with surprises. When Tobel 
seizes Wallraff's hand after a chess game, there's something startlingly raw in 
his face, grim and wolfish against the racy chrome of the film's plot. 
</P>
<P>
In "Heartbreakers," also with Coyote -- and an actor, Nick Mancuso, who 
somewhat resembles Prochnow -- Roth zeroes in on similar, if subconscious, male 
bonding in the Los Angeles art world. "Heartbreakers" was serious and offbeat, 
but it had a major flaw, repeated here: incredibly sparse dialogue -- so spare 
it becomes almost purely functional. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Man Inside," where the characters are supposed to be journalists and 
writers, this terseness seems even more willed and anachronistic. People don't 
talk this way -- in laconic four- or five-word sentences and bursts of 
exclamatory exposition -- unless they're in "Dragnet," a post-1980 movie script 
or they've just come from the dentist. 
</P>
<P>
The movie, shorn of its topicality, probably had to revive itself by 
emphasizing the psychological drive at its core: the mingled terror and 
fascination of a man embraced by people he's convinced are his enemies, the 
dilemma of a rogue of integrity loose in the belly of the beast. But "The Man 
Inside" (rated PG, despite adult themes) doesn't get far enough inside itself. 
Initially idealistic and gutsy, it's become a metallic husk: the movie outside.

FALK LIFTS A WEARYING 'TUNE IN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Movies about the fine line between reality and fantasy are usually arty, 
self-conscious horrors. "Tune In Tomorrow . . ." isn't in that category. Its 
faults are of a reverse sort; it makes so little of the mystery of the 
reality-fantasy interchange that it comes across like a great big rambunctious 
cartoon. Fantasy knocks reality out of the box. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the 1977 Mario Vargas Llosa novel "Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter," 
the film is about what happens when a dotty, inspired radio writer named Pedro 
Carmichael (Peter Falk) is hired by WXBU, "the Voice of New Orleans," to spark 
its low-rated soap-opera. This he does, and, in the process, sparks the lives 
of his co-workers -- specifically the 21-year-old Martin (Keanu Reeves), an 
aspiring radio writer who is in love with Julia (Barbara Hershey), his 
35-year-old, twice-divorced aunt by marriage. 
</P>
<P>
The film's scenario whittles down Vargas Llosa's narrative, in which real-life 
chapters alternated with Pedro's soapsuds fantasies. The film settles on one of 
Pedro's plot lines: a complicated story compounding adultery, incest, mistaken 
identity -- the works. (Such well-known faces as Henry Gibson, John 
Larroquette, Dan Hedaya, Hope Lange, Elizabeth McGovern and Peter Gallagher 
turn up in this story line.) 
</P>
<P>
The film's not-too-subtle conceit is that the romantic entanglements of Martin 
and Julia inspire Pedro's perfervid imagination; he sets up liaisons between 
them and then, employing various disguises ranging from charwoman to rabbi, 
eavesdrops on their dialogue, which then ends up in his radio drama, 
influencing the couple's real-life affair. 
</P>
<P>
For Pedro, writing isn't just a job, it's a mission. When he directs the actors 
in the radio studio, he whips them into a frenzy to match his own. "I want your 
souls to enter the microphones," he says, and he means it literally. Pedro may 
appear to be a hack, but, in the film's terms, he is also the soul of creation. 
His soaps are low-grade but they're entertaining as hell; they fulfill the 
first requirement of any story -- we want to know what happens next. 
</P>
<P>
And Pedro goes a step further; he uses his dramas as a way of making reality 
happen. At one time or another all writers probably feel like they're playing 
God. Pedro actively courts godliness. He's the writer as cosmic matchmaker. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro's antics are more entertaining than the soap opera that we see, or even 
Julia and Martin's budding romance. The soap sequences are lively camp but 
they're overblown; even though the film (selected theaters) is set in 1951, the 
scenes have the floridness of some of the more batty episodes of "Dallas" or 
"Dynasty." A more straightforward approach to these sequences might have worked 
better. Jon Amiel, who directed from a script by William Boyd, doesn't seem to 
recognize that soaps already contain a built-in component of self-satire. He 
overdoes what was overdone to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
Keanu Reeves has some problems with his New Orleans accent, but he has a 
breezy, engaging presence and a winning, hangdog lyricism whenever his 
love-struck Martin is moping about the beloved Julia. Barbara Hershey makes his 
love for her believable. Although born in New Orleans, she's currently a New 
York refugee, and we can see how her brittle, citified ways might stir him up. 
</P>
<P>
Julia's tough-gal cynicism is pretty transparent, though, and Martin spots her 
frailty. It's what finally wins her over to him. Hershey is one of those 
comparatively few performers whose talents have deepened with age. Julia isn't 
a major role, but Hershey attacks it as if it were. This is the same actress 
who was so extraordinary in "A World Apart" and, on television, "A Killing in a 
Small Town." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Falk has a small field day as Pedro. Even though his scenes are scaled to 
be funnier than they actually are, he sashays into his multiple roles with 
glee. But Amiel doesn't encourage him to bring out the nightmarish quality in 
the changeovers, the way, in "Lolita," Kubrick and Peter Sellers collaborated 
to bring out the creepiness in Nabokov's Clare Quilty. (That's still probably 
the greatest multiple-personality performance ever.) The film is so resolutely 
jokey that Falk never has a chance to demonstrate the scary potential in 
Pedro's cosmic matchmaking. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas Llosa's novel, which was set in Lima, Peru, and based on his own early, 
scandalous marriage to his aunt, had a denser, more mysterious texture. "Tune 
In Tomorrow . . ." (rated PG-13) is a gagster's movie, and, like most gag 
fests, you sit back and sort out the good skits from the bad. You learn to 
settle for less. 
</P>

'SIBLING RIVALRY' LACKS ADEQUATE INSANITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sam Elliott may have discovered a new metier. In "Sibling Rivalry" (citywide), 
he makes a great, grinning corpse. Stretched out on stiff hotel sheets, 
seraphic smile under a rakish walrus' mustache, Elliott radiates dumb, 
narcissistic savoir-faire without moving a muscle. 
</P>
<P>
In the movie, he's been dispatched by a fatal one-afternoon stand. His partner, 
Kirstie Alley, as supermarket pickup Marjorie Turner, is left to burble and 
wail for the rest of the picture, trying to keep this alarming assignation 
secret from her husband, family, the police -- everyone except her lewd-mouthed 
sister, Jeanine (Jami Gertz). Elliott has it luckier. He gets his laughs by 
playing, and staying, dead. 
</P>
<P>
Is graveyard humor in a resurgence? Usually confined to William Castle-style 
horror comedies, it's lately nudging into yuppie satire -- as in last year's 
"Weekend at Bernie's," with hapless Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman 
trying to palm off their boss' cadaver as a jaded, taciturn partygoer. 
</P>
<P>
"Sibling Rivalry" is really two movies -- a macabre farce about a repressed, 
dutiful wife who pays hideously for her one infidelity, haunted by the ghost, 
or corpse, of her sins; and a more conventional, and less interesting, 
sentimental sitcom about the family problems of cross-class marriages. This 
second plot should feed into the first. It doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
You can practically sense when the movie splits in two -- right after Alley's 
opening memoir vignettes, in the scene introducing Bill Pullman's nerdy 
vertical-blind salesman, Nicholas Meany. Pullman operates in a different comic 
key than most of the other actors. He's manic, disheveled, frenzied. His 
flopping hair, twisted shirt tail and herky-jerky body language are exactly 
right for the kind of guy, who, trying to fake someone else's suicide, would 
help pour laxatives and vitamins down the corpse's throat. 
</P>
<P>
Pullman immediately raises the laugh levels, but, though Alley again 
demonstrates her flair for comic hysterics, he's out of phase with most of the 
other actors. More than likely, they should have been adjusted to him. 
</P>
<P>
Screenwriter Martha Goldhirsch has the right idea. She's loaded up "Rivalry" 
with complications, cross-purposes and preposterous coincidences. But she's not 
strong on dialogue, and she doesn't build up to the right paroxysm. There's no 
pungency to the movie's confrontation scenes; when the revelations come, they 
always seem 5 minutes too early and several shades too mild. 
</P>
<P>
The cast is largely wasted. As Marjorie's in-laws, Carrie Fisher, Frances 
Sternhagen and John Randolph offer a few slim cameos of acerbity, snobbery and 
fuddle-headedness; Scott Bakula is perhaps too convincing as the de-sexed 
husband; and Ed O'Neill, as the investigating cop, seems to have wandered over 
on his way to a "Barney Miller" remake. 
</P>
<P>
Director Carl Reiner doesn't necessarily miss the laughs here, but he may have 
taken too genial a tone. He doesn't crank the movie up to manic spontaneity; he 
can't disguise the flatness or shallowness of the family scenes. And perhaps 
Carrie Fisher, with her post-"Postcards" aura of hip skepticism and comic 
inflammability, should have played the bad-mouthed swinger of a sister, rather 
than the smug in-law. 
</P>
<P>
But, even though "Sibling Rivalry" (MPAA rated PG-13 for sexual situations and 
profanity) is an embarrassing misfire -- except for Pullman's schnook turns, 
most of its better laughs are contained in its trailer -- it still has one 
imperishable image: Sam Elliott as the man who died smiling. What the movie 
doesn't have is the courage of its own bad taste. It's an over-the-edge farce 
that keeps tiptoeing away from the brink. 
</P>

STAGE BEAT: A POST-NUCLEAR WORLD IN 'RIDDLEY WALKER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Ain't that a larf?" asks the hero of Russell Hoban's "Riddley Walker" at 
CalRep. He's talking about the world 3,000 years after the explosion of the 
"one big one" in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
The larf is on the human race. It hasn't learned a thing. It's back at square 
one, trying to find the "numbers" that will produce primitive explosives. 
</P>
<P>
The plot is no more extraordinary than your generic post-holocaust B-movie, but 
Hoban's fable-like structure and his imaginative invention of a language that 
is all that remains of good English (its decline is already starting in 
pre-holocaust 1990) make the evening fascinating. It only takes a minute to 
tune in -- the leader is the "Primintser" and the dread Usa (U.S.A.) controls 
the "puterlite" (computer elite). 
</P>
<P>
Ashley Carr's staging on D Martyn Bookwalter's intriguing primitive grotto 
setting is notably colorful, and Craig Rovere's wide-eyed Candide of a Riddley 
Walker gives the action a backbone and fine comic shading. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cal State Long Beach, 1250 Bellflower Blvd.; Fridays and Saturdays, also 
Oct. 24-27, 8 p.m.; call for Nov.-Dec. schedule; ends Dec. 15. $10-$14; (213)

STAGE BEAT: SARGENT DOUBLE BILL 'FURY' AT THE OLIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The generic '90s mythic hero of Michael Sargent's striking plays, "Big Boy" and 
"I Hate" -- young, beautiful and passionless -- pops up again in his one-act 
"Rat Songs," the second half of "Fury" at the Olio Theatre. This time he's 
lusted after by his roommate in a youth detention center, his partner in a 
daring escape and a Genet-esque search for the siren rats of his friend's 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
But Sargent's aim is not as sharp here. Other characters seem totally 
extraneous and don't advance the central theme. Kergan Edwards' direction helps 
-- as would stronger focus -- and Eric Close and Michael Vaccaro perfectly 
capture the emotional hunger and desperate search for identity of the hero 
Robbie and his doomed friend. 
</P>
<P>
The opener is another Sargent one-act, "When Esther Saw the Light," but it's 
derivative and silly, far from Sargent at his best. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3709 Sunset Blvd., Silver Lake; Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; ends 
Nov. 17. $15; (213) 466-1767.

STAGE BEAT: THEATRICAL TRICKERY IN 'DELICACIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Delicacies" is a restaurant that's high tech in more ways than one, as is 
Laura Shamas' play of the same name at Carpet Co. Stage. The maitre d' knows 
his customers, and the individualized menus reflect the personalities of the 
three married women who are wining and dining their dream men while their 
hubbies are tending to business. 
</P>
<P>
The tables are turned a few weeks later when the wives bring their spouses to 
Delicacies. The maitre d' knows exactly how to gauge the evening, and the 
length of the fuses of the diners. 
</P>
<P>
It's a fascinating piece of theatrical trickery, particularly as the same three 
actors play the boyfriends and the husbands. If only the couples themselves 
were as fascinating. They're a dull lot, even under Bruce Whitney's able 
direction, which matches the ambience of the cafe. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the performances enliven the couples. Kat Sawyer-Young is excellent as 
a sculptor with a roaming eye for a painter, only to find her real passion in 
the jealousy of her husband. David Mingrino and understudy Loren Lester give 
interesting color to the two sides of their characters, and Alice Vaughn and 
Lily Mariye shade the other two wives as much as the script allows them. Kelley 
Hinman misses as the painter, but recovers nicely as his opposite number, while 
Jeff Witzeman's maitre d' oozes wisdom and savoir-faire. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5262 W. Pico Blvd.; Fridays through Mondays, 8 p.m.; ends Nov. 26. $13.50;

STAGE BEAT: 'RUNNING OF GRUNIONS': DELICATE CREATURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A good title is suggestive. "The Running of the Grunions" is about neurotic 
creatures of habit. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning playwright Lori Romero's drama centers on two quirky sisters, a 
ne'er-do well but loving brother, and their mom, who suffers from Alzheimer's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
The production at the Flight Theatre is sensitive and well researched in its 
depiction of Alzheimer's. As the disoriented mother, Mary Boucher negotiates 
memory lapses with credibility, and director David J. Partington's cast 
captures the nervous fear that grips the disease's second victims, the families 
who must deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
Alzheimer's is really a leitmotif for the emotional stress of the sisters. One 
is annoyingly fatuous, and the role's mannered cuteness is badly overplayed by 
Shari Ballard. The other sister is a genuine wreck who makes you wince in a 
terrific portrayal by Juli Donald. 
</P>
<P>
The brother (nice job by understudy Christopher Marcantel at the performance 
attended) is a cliche role too reliant on smart one-liners. A divorced husband 
who pops up (an earnest Walter McDowell) gives the production a momentary 
masculine ballast it desperately needs. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6476 Santa Monica Blvd., today and Saturday, 8 p.m., ends Sunday at 7 p.m. 
$12. (213) 464-2124.

DELICATE SHANGHAI SPECIALTIES IN AN OPULENT SETTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Upscale Chinese is a tough sell, especially in restaurant-rich Los Angeles. 
Most of us think in terms of cheap and casual whenever it comes to Chinese 
restaurants, and our wealth of good little cheap/casual Chinese places goes a 
long way toward maintaining the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
That's the only reason I can think of why Harvest Inn, the swankest Chinese 
restaurant ever to hit downtown Glendale, is not playing to a packed house 
every night. 
</P>
<P>
True, it's still rather new, open around two months, but you'd think more 
people would have discovered it by now. With its high style -- and high ceiling 
-- it would seem to have everything needed for success: striking decor, careful 
service, wonderful food and competitive prices. Maybe the name Harvest Inn is 
part of the problem. I must say I half expected to find New England boiled 
dinner on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
When you walk into the elegant, relaxing dining room, your eyes are immediately 
drawn upward, to that high ceiling. It's a Post-Modern masterpiece, almost 20 
feet high, with a pyramidal structure of wooden beams projecting down for 
several feet. 
</P>
<P>
The main floor is impressive and vast, almost big enough to ride a horse around 
in. As a matter of fact, it's carpeted in rich moss green, the color of healthy 
turf at a race track. You sit at plush booths with dark banquettes, embroidered 
in a Chinese fan motif, and listen to the mercifully quiet music of the pi-pa, 
or Chinese zither. Across the room, catch a glimpse of the well-dressed Chinese 
families, dishing up mysterious delicacies in the semiprivate banquet rooms. 
They'll be too busy to notice you. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are, it's because of the Shanghainese specialties they are eating. 
Shanghainese is the dominant cuisine of this restaurant, and that means, in 
principle, lots of cold dishes, seafoods and light sauces. Both the owner (late 
of Shanghai Winter Garden on Wilshire) and the chef (a man named Chung who was 
recruited from Paris) are Shanghai natives, and the spirit of their cuisine 
runs the gamut of this menu. But you'll also find dozens of Cantonese and 
Peking-style specialties on their thoroughly bilingual menu. 
</P>
<P>
Hot and spicy dishes are noticeably absent. If you crave hot food, you'll have 
to rely on extra spoonfuls of the chef's homemade chile paste, which you'll 
find in little glass vials on every table. I think that does this chef a 
disservice, though. His food stands on its own. 
</P>
<P>
Bypass the hot appetizers, mere clones of the usual Cantonese cliches (egg 
roll, shrimp toast), and head right into those Shanghainese cold dishes. 
Vegetable goose, made of rolled tofu skin stuffed with bamboo and minced 
mushrooms, is marvelous. It gets its name merely from a resemblance to the 
cooked neck of a goose, not any similarity of taste to goose, and chef Chung's 
version is the best I've had in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Wine-marinated chicken, flavored with loads of garlic, rice wine and Chinese 
liquor, is also terrific, though admittedly not to everyone's taste. The 
chicken is chopped and cooked to a degree somewhere in the no man's land 
between sashimi and medium rare, and the faint tinge of blood, still present, 
may put some people off. 
</P>
<P>
You can't go wrong if you order from the section titled "Harvest Inn 
Specialties." The very first listing is a hybrid of French and Chinese: oyster 
baked in French sauce. It's an absolute must. The chef bakes oysters in the 
shell with a delicate garlic butter, then finishes them with shallot and 
cilantro. They are so rich I recommend you limit yourself to one -- but you 
have to order a minimum of six. Bring friends. 
</P>
<P>
Also from this section, anything called sweet and pungent is recommended. This 
means a light batter (and I do mean light) with a hint of coconut, and a sweet 
vinegar-infused sauce that is never cloying. 
</P>
<P>
That's the thing about this food that really impresses me. Most Chinese chefs 
simply do not take the time to reduce their sauces, but instead cut corners 
with lumps of cornstarch. This chef obviously disdains that method. 
</P>
<P>
A dish such as his sliced fish in special wine sauce with garlic is a good 
illustration of his style. Slices of fresh sole and shreds of tree ear 
mushrooms virtually float in a sweet wine sauce that clings like a satin dress, 
but leaves no aftertaste. 
</P>
<P>
You might also try anything with black bean sauce. If you've ever suffered a 
starchy black bean sauce at the hands of a less experienced chef, the 
difference will be immediately apparent. 
</P>
<P>
There are so many dishes to try here, it's hard to narrow them down to a few 
standouts. Quail, not on the menu but available if ordered in advance, is 
wonderful, roasted in a dark brown sauce and served whole. Tangerine beef is 
delicate and crisply fried, served with the peel and fiery red chili. 
</P>
<P>
The house mu-shu, a pancake stuffed at the table with an array of julienned 
carrot, cucumber, bean sprouts, shredded egg yolk and intelligently sauced 
pork, elevates the dish far above its mundane counterparts in most local 
restaurants. And even something as simple as pan-fried noodles can soar here. 
They're oil-free, crisped on the bottom and softly al dente in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant attempts to take wine seriously, making a big show of the ice 
buckets and the service. A serious-looking fellow in a tuxedo comes by to open 
the bottle and insists upon your tasting it, just as if you were in an upscale 
Western restaurant or something. 
</P>
<P>
Some nerve, because Tsing-Tao beer goes so much better with this food. Next 
thing you know, they'll be charging $30 an entree as they do at the tonier 
restaurants on the Westside, instead of the $10 or less most of them cost now. 
Then who'd come? 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: vegetable goose, $7.50; assorted cold cuts, $22 and $28; 
oyster baked in French sauce, $1.50 apiece (minimum six); house mu-shu, $9.50; 
fish fillet in special wine sauce with garlic, $11.95; sweet and pungent 
shrimp, $11.95. 
</P>
<P>

3 p.m. daily; dinner 4 to 10 p.m. daily. Full bar. Validated parking in garage

LAUGHING THROUGH THE PAIN OF AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Susan Oglesby learned that her husband, Steven, had AIDS, she found 
herself dealing with the trauma through humor. She'd laugh at the doctors and 
the government and the stupid things people said to Steven. 
</P>
<P>
So when AIDS Project Los Angeles offered a stand-up comedy workshop, Oglesby 
decided to attend. She and Steven worked on material together at home. 
</P>
<P>
"For my act, I didn't have to make things up," Oglesby said. "I just talked 
about things that happened." 
</P>
<P>
In class, speaking to the microphone stand as if it were her thin and ailing 
husband, she did an impression of visiting friends: "Oh, you look so-o-o 
great." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, Oglesby and 15 other new-found comedians will take the stage 
at L.A. Cabaret Comedy Club in Encino. All of the stand-up students performing 
in this showcase have been affected by AIDS: they are people with the disease, 
friends, family or APLA staff and volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrific mixture of comedy and poignancy," said Judy Carter, a 
professional comedian who taught the workshop. "These people are getting their 
revenge through humor." 
</P>
<P>
One student, who is blind and Jewish, begins his monologue: "I know what you're 
thinking . . . another blind Orthodox Jewish gay with AIDS comic." 
</P>
<P>
Another recounts visiting his mother at Christmas and revealing that he is gay 
and has AIDS. The next thing, he tells the audience, she has wrapped everything 
in the house in vinyl. Friends come over to admire his gifts and inquire about 
his will. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all about their lives," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
Carter agreed to teach the seven-week class at the suggestion of a friend who 
is an APLA volunteer. The comedian -- who works the stand-up circuit and has 
opened for such rock 'n' roll acts as Kenny Loggins and Prince -- has been 
teaching comedy for years, but approached this workshop as an entirely new 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I was absolutely petrified because one of the rules of comedy is, 'Don't talk 
about cancer and don't talk about AIDS,' " she said. "I thought, 'How can we 
take one of the biggest tragedies of the 20th Century and convert it to humor?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
The students, too, were shy about the subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
"At first they were doing stuff about being tall or shopping at K mart," Carter 
said. "After the third week, I got mad and told them 'You've got to talk about 
AIDS.' " 
</P>
<P>
The result was a comedy-writing support group. There were tears mixed with 
laughs, jokes with words of sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
"In clinical terms, we would call it a cathartic experience," said Carl Lukes, 
who is APLA's community mental health specialist. "If we really sat down and 
thought about the horror of AIDS, it would be too much for most of us to deal 
with. You need an outlet. . . . Comedy or creative avenues are a good way to 
deal with the emotions." 
</P>
<P>
In class, the students ran through exercises: Carter would ask them to recite 
lists of things they liked or hated. She'd give them a topic and have them 
stand in front of class and talk, ramble. 
</P>
<P>
From such train of thought and free association, jokes were born. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'Oh, it's going to be fun,' " said a student with AIDS who asked 
not to be identified. "But I wrestled with it. Judy teaches you to draw on the 
difficulty and pain in your life." 
</P>
<P>
So he told jokes about the endless doctors appointments and medical tests: "I 
don't have time to have a life-threatening illness." He talked about 
co-workers: "All the ladies in my office think it's so wonderful that I can eat 
so much and stay so thin." 
</P>
<P>
Amid the laughter, though, a harsh reality hit home several weeks ago when 
Steven Oglesby died. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept on going to class," Susan Oglesby said. "It was a place where I was 
understood." 
</P>
<P>
Other class members offered support and said they took inspiration from 
Oglesby. She turned her routine into a tribute. 
</P>
<P>
"Now half of my act is about the cremation process," she said, "which is not a 
knee-slapper, but there are some things about it that were so ridiculous that 
you have to laugh." 
</P>
<P>
She is looking forward to Monday night's performance, the proceeds from which 
will benefit APLA. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't find the humor in these things," she said, "you go insane." 
</P>
<P>
 LA Cabaret Comedy Club is at 17271 Ventura Blvd., Encino. The show begins at 8 
p.m. Admission is $10 with a two-drink minimum. For information, call 501-3737.

Improvisation With an Edge 
</P>
<P>
The audience yelled out improvisation suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
A situation: Two people visiting their psychiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
A relationship: A milkman and his customer. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately, actor Anthony Ross became a milkman lamenting that 25 women a day 
are throwing themselves at him and his wife is asking, "Honey, would you sleep 
with a woman just to keep up your milk quotient?" 
</P>
<P>
Instantly, stand-up comic Stefanie Gaines transformed herself into a Jewish 
housewife with five children who giggled about "that clean white uniform that 
makes me squirm!" 
</P>
<P>
Director Darin Garrett called an end to their funny, yet poignant scene and 
commented, "That's it, you're on the edge." 
</P>
<P>
The Edge, the Valley's newest cabaret improvisation troupe, is made up of eight 
comedians, singers, actors, writers and musicians from across the country. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike many other improv teams, this group tries to capture actual 
real-life scenes with performances that can evoke tears, sighs and groans just 
as easily as they evoke laughter. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying something innovative with improv," Garrett said. "We're taking a 
risk with our craft to create atypical characters and avoiding the typical 
stereotypes." 
</P>
<P>
The cast of The Edge, which debuts Saturday at the West End Playhouse in Van 
Nuys, plans to use audience suggestions to spontaneously entertain people for 
90 minutes. They will also encourage members of the audience to join them on 
stage for some of the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing improv helps us with our individuality and our acting," said Linda 
Scamardi, who moved to Los Angeles after doing commercials and industrial films 
in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated with their slow-moving acting careers and their own improvisation 
instructors, the eight performers -- ranging in age from 18 to thirtysomething 
-- have linked up to form their own group. They met in improv companies, 
through their daytime jobs and, in one case, at a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Scamardi, Gaines from New York and Ross from Indiana, the group 
includes Stacey McCall from Georgia; William Michael Jordan, a Valley 
teen-ager; Jay Lacopo, who performs at the Comedy Store; and John Cullen, a 
musician and actor now working on a movie with Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett, 27, moved to Los Angeles a year ago after reuniting with Ross, a 
fellow acting student from the University of Evansville in Indiana. He formed 
the troupe six months ago and performs with them. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to create characters with a twist to them, like viewing a slice of 
life through a keyhole," Garrett said. "So you won't see a foul-mouthed slob 
truck driver from us, you'll see a truck driver who quotes Shakespeare." 
</P>
<P>
During rehearsal this week, Gaines talked about a comedic old lady she watched 
chain-smoking and tearing up napkins at a local Carl's Jr. restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"I was captivated with her," Gaines said. No doubt, that real-life character 
will appear in one of Gaines' future improvisations. 
</P>
<P>
McCall is a co-producer of The Edge along with Chris Jordan, who owns a paper 
distribution company and is the father of the youngest member of the troupe. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the cast has some professional stage, television or film experience, 
and most have day jobs in the entertainment industry. Some hope to use The Edge 
to "get discovered" for their creative talents and others just want to have 
fun. A scripted play is already in the works for the company, but until then 
they will do strictly off-the-cuff performances. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, we are trying to show casting directors that there is more to us than 
our physical appearance," Garrett said. "We have talent too." 
</P>
<P>
Their role playing is different from other improv groups because the director 
doesn't cut the scene until a story and a resolution develop. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the idea that people will come to laugh, and maybe they'll cry or 
experience some other emotion they never expected," Gaines said. "That's being 
innovative." 
</P>
<P>
"That's being on the edge!" added some of the others in unison. 
</P>
<P>
 The Edge performs at 10:30 p.m. Saturdays at the West End Playhouse, 7446 Van 
Nuys Blvd., Van Nuys, beginning tomorrow and continuing through December. 
Tickets are $5. Call (818) 906-6782.

LEGISLATOR GUILTY OF SELLING VOTE IN FBI STING

<P>
A jury Thursday convicted a state lawmaker of selling his vote on parimutuel 
betting for $4,300, ending the first trial stemming from an FBI undercover 
sting labeled Operation Lost Trust. 
</P>
<P>
The sting so far has resulted in indictments charging 10 legislators with 
bribery. 
</P>
<P>
Four have resigned and pleaded guilty. One of the 10 lawmakers pleaded guilty 
to drug charges earlier this month, as did a lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. District Court jury convicted state Rep. Luther Taylor, 40, a Democrat 
from Columbia, on all six counts against him of violating the Hobbs Act, a 
federal anti-bribery law. An indictment accused him of accepting five separate 
bribes and of conspiring to solicit those bribes in exchange for his support of 
a parimutuel betting bill. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor voted for the bill in committee during the last legislative session. The 
bill never made it to the state House or Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The conviction carries a maximum penalty of 120 years in prison and a 
$1.5-million fine. No sentencing date was set. 
</P>
<P>
Videotapes and lobbyist Ron Cobb dominated the prosecution's case. Cobb, a 
former Democratic House member who had become a lobbyist, testified that he 
worked under cover for the FBI after getting caught trying to buy cocaine from 
federal agents.

NAACP VOWS ACTION AGAINST WILSON ON VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles branch of the NAACP is gearing up to ensure that Sen. Pete 
Wilson is "held accountable" in the upcoming gubernatorial election for his 
role in sustaining President Bush's veto this week of a major civil rights 
bill, the branch president said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Duff, president of the National Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People branch, would not say exactly what actions the group would take 
against Wilson, the GOP candidate, but vowed that the NAACP and its supporters 
statewide will "make it clear to voters he is against civil rights." 
</P>
<P>
Duff said details of the strategy against Wilson, Duff said, will be formulated 
this weekend in Riverside at a previously planned meeting of NAACP officials 
from California. 
</P>
<P>
Other local activists, including an officer of the Los Angeles chapter of 
National Organization for Women, said they are urging their supporters to 
deluge the president and Congress with letters, telegrams and phone calls 
protesting the actions of the president and the U.S. Senate, which Wednesday 
that failed to override Bush's veto of the Civil Rights Bill of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he vetoed the measure, which would have reversed or altered six 
recent Supreme Court decisions, because he felt it would have led to hiring 
quotas for women, African Americans and other ethnic groups that have 
traditionally been the victims of employment discrimination. Supporters of the 
bill have assailed that position as dishonest. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Wednesday upheld the veto, falling a single vote short of the 
two-thirds majority needed to override. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the bill, and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne 
Feinstein, are criticizing Wilson for upholding the veto, with Feinstein 
charging that he cast "the deciding vote against this historic measure." 
</P>
<P>
James Lee, a Los Angeles-based spokesman for Wilson's campaign, said Wilson 
"did not vote to uphold the veto of a civil rights bill. He voted to uphold the 
veto of a quotas bill." 
</P>
<P>
Latino activists said they are planning a series of meetings on how to deal 
with elected officials when a revived version of the civil rights measure is 
introduced in Congress, some hope as early as next year. A day before the 
Senate override vote, a coalition of Latinos held a news conference in Los 
Angeles at which they denounced Wilson for not supporting the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Alicia Maldonado of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund 
(MALDEF) said Wilson "could have been the key vote" in overriding the 
presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Ridley-Thomas, director of the local branch of the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference, said Wilson has sent "a very clear message" to women and 
members of ethnic groups. "We ought to respond to it accordingly and cause him 
to live with the consequences in ways that he will never forget." 
</P>
<P>
Lee, asserting that Wilson's record on civil rights is unassailable, said the 
wrath now directed against him in the governor's race is no more than "partisan 
politics."

The Lebanese government said Thursday it has seized $25 million of public money 
held by toppled Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun and two aides and is looking for an 
additional $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
A government official said the seizure of Aoun's money was part of a drive by 
President Elias Hrawi to reunite Beirut and regain state resources, utilities 
and money lost to armed groups during the 15-year civil war. Aoun was toppled 
Oct. 13 by a Syrian-led assault on Beirut's Christian enclave. 
</P>
<P>
Six Lebanese banks handed over the money of Aoun and aides Edgard Maalouf and 
Issam abu Jamra to the Central Bank after the government froze their Beirut 
accounts, the official said.

Seven years after two boys were killed by an artillery shell that exploded when 
they were playing in a Tierrasanta canyon, officials are launching the final 
phase of a cleanup that has become the largest of its kind.

The Army Corps of Engineers recently awarded a $4-million contract to a

30-month sweep expected to be finished about April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
"The aim here is to protect human lives," said Bob Nore, Army Engineers project 
manager for the Tierrasanta canyon. "We are concerned enough about it to want 
to go in and clear it." 
</P>
<P>
Although applauding the action, local residents say the government years ago 
should have scoured the land, once used as an artillery range, before turning 
it over to developers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something that should have happened 20 years ago, when the government 
first sold the property," said Jim Madaffer, chairman of the Tierrasanta 
Community Council. "Tierrasanta has been a guinea pig. Hopefully, no other 
community is going to have to wait so long. Hopefully, no other community is 
going to have to suffer the loss of life before something happens." 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, two 8-year-old boys -- Corey Alden Peake and Matthew Smith -- were 
killed while playing with a military artillery shell that exploded. The boys, 
with a group of their friends, were building a fort when they came across the 
shell. 
</P>
<P>
Matt's mother, Suzanne Gillick-Pew, received a phone call telling her there had 
been an accident in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"I really thought he'd been hit by a car maybe, or fell out of a tree," she 
told The Times in an interview at the time. "When I arrived, Matt was already 
in a body bag. I asked to see him, and they wouldn't let me." 
</P>
<P>
The cleanup sweep will cover 1,600 acres, 1,200 publicly owned and 400 
Navy-owned. The area will be defined by California 52, Interstate 15, Friars 
Road, and the San Diego aqueduct. Some of the land hugs private residences, and 
work will start in those areas first, said Judy Wilson, a spokeswoman for the 
Army Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the final phase, the land will not be completely risk-free, experts 
caution. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we could ever say any area that had ordnance in it could be 
completely, 100% safe," Nore said. "But we can make it safe to the best of our 
knowledge and abilities." 
</P>
<P>
As the land erodes, explosives buried long ago gradually creep to the surface. 
In fact, ordnance is found monthly -- though most is not live, Madaffer said. 
Nore and others believe that much of what remains in the soil will be uncovered 
in this final cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
But Don DeSisto, an attorney who sued the city and developers on behalf of the 
Peake family, said: "If I were living in the area, I'd be really concerned 
about my kids playing in open spaces. I don't know that they can get all that 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
In the years since the boys' deaths, the Navy has orchestrated several sweeps 
of the area. In 1984, 178 pieces of ordnance were found; in 1985, 215 were 
uncovered, said Jeanne Light, a spokeswoman for Southwest Division Naval 
Facilities Engineering Command. In those two sweeps, which involved masses of 
enlisted men walking through the canyons and cost $76,000, 100 rounds of 
ammunition, most of it live, were found. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, during another sweep from June 12 to Aug. 1, 41 items were found -- 
four were deemed unexploded "high explosives," Light said. That sweep, in which 
383 acres of roads, paths and trails were electronically monitored, cost the 
Navy $95,000, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tierrasanta, a community of condominiums and single-family homes, was 
constructed in the 1970s. It sits in an area that had served as an artillery 
range for the 43-square-mile Marine Corps Camp Eliott during World War II. The 
land was later transferred to the Navy and to developers. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the city of San Diego and developers agreed to pay $6.3 million 
to the families of the boys. Signs warning of possible live ordnance have been 
posted. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, the Department of Defense is authorized to restore former 
and active military sites. And the Huntsville, Ala.-based Army Corps, which is 
responsible for implementing the DOD's Defense Environmental Restoration 
Program, has been preparing a cleanup plan for Tierrasanta. Besides looking for 
explosives, the experts will have to work carefully, avoiding the nesting 
habitats of two endangered birds -- the black-tailed gnat catcher and the least 
Bell vireo. 
</P>
<P>
First, the Corps of Engineers conducted a $600,000 feasibility study of the 
area in 1987. It prepared a contract and solicited bids -- a process that cost 
another $300,000, Nore said. Finally, last month, ECC was awarded the contract 
for scouring Tierrasanta. 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference Tuesday, officials expect to unveil details of the 
cleanup. The actual work will begin in November, when teams of workers will 
sweep the entire 1,600-acre area on foot. The workers will "cover every square 
inch of surface" to find any ordnance, Nore said. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the teams will clear the brush to allow magnetic detectors to be brought 
into the area for a "subsurface" sweep. During this process, the detectors will 
uncover ordnance buried as deep as 3 feet. Studies found that 95% of the 
materials discovered in the area were within 6 inches of the surface, Nore 
said. The other 5% was found within the top 3 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"So we are reasoning that, if we go to 3 feet, we are going to have a very 
clean site," said Nore, who added that officials expect that most uncovered 
materials will not be hazardous, or explodable. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Corps of Engineers routinely cleans artillery ranges, this will be 
the first time that experts have worked on a range that is being used for 
housing, he said. "Other times, the aim was to clear up a mess -- not saving 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
Once the final phase is over, the community will keep the warning signs posted. 
But there will be one change, said Madaffer of the Tierrasanta Community 
Council. The small sign cautioning that the area has not been swept for live 
ordnance will be removed.

UCSD BACKTRACKS ON ENDING PRENATAL PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stinging from criticism of its plan to close a prenatal care program for the 
poor, UC San Diego has begun intense efforts to find a way to keep the program 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD Medical Center officials did not return phone calls to ask about the 
negotiations Thursday, but the talks were confirmed by a UCSD spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
"The medical center administration is working with the reproductive medicine 
department and the community clinics to work something out. Any details beyond 
that I don't know," Nancy Stringer said. 
</P>
<P>
She declined to comment further, explaining that "there has been a lot of 
misinformation generated as a result of trying to discuss this while it was in 
process." 
</P>
<P>
Stringer also denied that anyone had ever made a final decision to close the 
Comprehensive Perinatal Program, despite an Oct. 16 memo to that effect and 
confirmation Tuesday by Dr. Robert Resnik, head of reproductive medicine at the 
medical school. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a draft memo that was not for release," Stringer said. "It was in 
process. It was still being discussed." 
</P>
<P>
She would not comment on what pressures may have come to bear on the medical 
center since Resnik's closure plan was publicized this week. 
</P>
<P>
However, among the calls to the hospital was one from county Supervisor Brian 
Bilbray. Bilbray characterized the UCSD decision as "myopic" and expressed hope 
that the university would reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just a university issue. The university is part of the community, and 
it has to understand that they can't walk away from the community's needs," 
Bilbray said. 
</P>
<P>
"I really can't believe that, when they look at all the realities that we have 
in San Diego County . . . that they will really continue with this sort of 
myopic approach of shutting it down." 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray and Supervisor Leon Williams constitute a supervisors' subcommittee 
that has been trying to find a way to augment existing programs that provide 
prenatal care to poor women in the county. 
</P>
<P>
They had prepared a proposal that was to have been presented to the supervisors 
for consideration Nov. 6, when the UCSD perinatal program shutdown was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
With the closure, the county's efforts would just be backfilling the void, 
rather than increasing access for poor women, Bilbray said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego had nearly 4,000 births last year to women who had no prenatal care, 
and thus were more likely to have sick or premature babies. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Shubert, director of the San Diego Council of Community Clinics, said 
he is involved with UCSD in the negotiations on how the clinics could help 
rescue the Comprehensive Perinatal Program. 
</P>
<P>
He hinted that the entire episode may have been caused by staffs at the medical 
school and the hospital, which technically are separate, not communicating with 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that there are ways that the medical center and the school of 
medicine can accommodate each other -- once they decide they will accommodate 
each other," Shubert said. "And my hope is that they do that right away." 
</P>
<P>
In a state-funded project that was later judged a success, the Comprehensive 
Perinatal Program gave pregnancy care and did the deliveries at UCSD for up to 
130 women a month for the last several years. The state used the UCSD model as 
a basis for increasing reimbursement rates for prenatal care and delivery more 
than a third under the Medi-Cal program. It ended the grant a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Resnik said in his Oct. 16 memo that the loss of the state grant made the 
program no longer financially viable. It would have cost $250,000 to $300,000 a 
year in unreimbursed fees to obstetrical faculty at the medical school, and 
$100,000 in administrative costs, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD officials were asked Tuesday to explain how those figures were arrived at 
and what alternatives were considered. They still hadn't done so by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Told earlier this week that UCSD was planning to shut down the perinatal 
project, state officials expressed puzzlement. 
</P>
<P>
The higher reimbursement rates have been found acceptable by other doctors all 
over the state, said Dr. Rugmini Shah, chief of the maternal and child health 
branch of the state Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
Stringer said the university disagrees with state officials on what the 
reimbursement rates are for Medi-Cal deliveries, but she was not specific. 
</P>
<P>
The total potential fees for a normal delivery, including reimbursement for 
special prenatal care, is $2,155.20, said Jim Taylor, chief of the Medi-Cal 
provider rate section for the health services department. However, the fees are 
broken down into many smaller items, any of which can be denied by Medi-Cal.

EX-PADRES' SLUGGER NATE COLBERT INDICTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the same day that he was fired as a minor-league coach for the San Diego 
Padres, former Padre slugger Nate Colbert was indicted Thursday on 12 felony 
counts involving fraudulent loan applications. 
</P>
<P>
Colbert, 44, the Padres' all-time home run leader with 163, was indicted by a 
federal grand jury on eight counts of bank fraud and four counts of making 
false statements on loan applications, according to U.S. Atty. William Braniff. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. William Q. Hayes said that Nathan Colbert Jr., who during 
his playing days was always known as Nate, "knowingly listed as assets real 
estate he did not own on loan applications." 
</P>
<P>
Under counts 1 through 8, Colbert could be sentenced to a total of 40 years in 
prison and a $2-million fine, Braniff said. The maximum penalty under counts 9 
through 12 is eight years in prison and a $1-million fine. 
</P>
<P>
Padre officials confirmed Thursday that, among a number of managerial changes 
this week, Colbert was relieved of his duties as a coach with the team's Class 
A franchise in Riverside. The firing was apparently unrelated to the 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Colbert now faces "a surrender date" with the FBI, "or he could be arrested, 
although he isn't under arrest now," said Hayes, who's prosecuting the case. 
"But no court date or surrender date has been established at this time," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes said Colbert had been under investigation by a federal grand jury in San 
Diego "for some time." The indictment charges that, between Feb. 10, 1988, and 
December, 1989, Colbert made false statements on four separate Cuyamaca Bank of 
Santee loan applications for the purpose of influencing the bank to approve or 
extend eight loans totaling about $138,000. 
</P>
<P>
Colbert is alleged to have listed as an asset on four applications 16 acres in 
Maine that he did not own at the time the applications were submitted to the 
bank, the indictment says. On the applications, he valued the Maine real estate 
at between $150,000 and $198,000, Hayes said. The indictment also alleges that 
Colbert understated a liability owed on 50 acres of Texas real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes said Colbert has no criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-foot-2 and 209 pounds, first baseman Colbert entered the major leagues 
with the Houston Astros in 1966. He spent his last six seasons in San Diego. He 
established a major-league record on Aug. 1, 1972, by hitting five home runs 
and driving in 13 runs during a double-header. 
</P>
<P>
A congenital back problem ended Colbert's major-league career, a spokeswoman 
for the Padres said Thursday. He had just finished his fourth season as a coach 
with the Riverside Red Wave. 
</P>
<P>
Colbert, who the Padres say lives with his wife and children in Sandy, Utah, 
was unavailable for comment late Thursday.

GROUP SEEKING THE OUSTER OF BERNHARDT NEEDS 3,000 MORE SIGNATURES; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: IT HAS A MONTH TO GET THE NAMES TO PUT THE MEASURE ON THE BALLOT; 
BERNHARDT REMAINS CONFIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Edging San Diego closer to its first City Council recall election, the city 
clerk's office announced Thursday that a group seeking to oust Councilwoman 
Linda Bernhardt needs to collect about 3,000 more signatures on recall 
petitions over the next month to qualify the issue for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Verification of the 11,823 signatures turned in by the Recall Bernhardt 
Committee on Oct. 9 showed that 8,265 were valid, leaving the group 2,975 names 
short of the 11,240 signatures needed to force a recall election early next 
year, according to City Clerk Charles Abdelnour. 
</P>
<P>
With nearly 4,000 new signatures collected over the past two weeks already in 
hand, the recall leaders confidently predicted Thursday that they will easily 
surpass the 11,240-name target by the Nov. 23 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing is a done deal -- there will be a recall election next year," 
political consultant Jack Orr said. "And, once it's on the ballot, Linda 
Bernhardt is done." 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt, however, said she believes that there still is an "outside chance" 
that the recall effort will fail to qualify for the ballot. Even if her 
opponents collect enough signatures, Bernhardt added, the quirk in local law 
giving the recall forces the additional month to circulate their petitions 
could be challenged in court. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't concede the election as being inevitable," Bernhardt said. "If they 
thought I was aggressive in fighting this before, they'll find me being even 
tougher this time around." 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating that the signature verification, which generally results in 25% or 
more of the names being declared invalid, would leave them short of their goal, 
the anti-Bernhardt group began circulating so-called "supplemental petitions" 
after turning in the first batch 2 1/2 weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Under procedures governing recall elections, groups also receive an additional 
30 days to gather names after the city clerk declares that not enough 
signatures have been collected. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Gaustad, chairman of the anti-Bernhardt group, said the additional 6 1/2 
weeks will permit the recall committee to be more meticulous in its signature 
gathering than it was during the initial 39-day circulation period. The group 
has begun conducting its own name-by-name verification check, and also plans to 
collect signatures outside the polls on Election Day next month to guarantee 
that only registered voters sign. 
</P>
<P>
Even if only the 70% validity rate found in the first 11,823 signatures holds 
for the supplemental petitions, the additional 4,000 names already gathered 
would put the group near the 11,240-name goal, which represents 15% of the 
registered voters in Bernhardt's district. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt at all we'll make it," Gaustad said. "We'll leave ourselves a 
big cushion just to be safe." 
</P>
<P>
Saying that many people "sign these things without thinking," even Bernhardt 
expressed doubt about her ability to prevent her opponents from collecting an 
adequate number of signatures. Even so, Orr conceded that Bernhardt's 
mobilization of her supporters has made the signature gathering more 
challenging than he first envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
"I've contended all along you could get people to sign petitions saying they'd 
shoot themselves in the left foot," Orr said. "But, I'll give them credit -- 
they've done a pretty good job of freezing the deck and questioning the whole 
process." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 11,823 signatures checked in Thursday's tabulation, 3,558 were declared 
invalid by the county registrar of voters, most because they came from people 
who do not live in Bernhardt's 5th District or are not registered to vote. 
Bernhardt's supporters also collected 747 signatures on "rescission" forms, in 
which individuals asked that their names be removed from the pro-recall 
petitions, but only 55 of those names proved to be valid. 
</P>
<P>
Should Gaustad's committee eventually collect enough signatures, the City 
Council must schedule a recall election -- and a tandem race to determine 
Bernhardt's possible successor -- within 60 to 90 days. That timetable probably 
would produce an election between February and April. 
</P>
<P>
A simple majority vote would determine Bernhardt's political fate. If she 
received more than 50% of the vote, Bernhardt would retain her post, rendering 
the outcome of the companion election on successors moot. However, if Bernhardt 
were ousted, the candidate drawing the most votes in the other race would serve 
the rest of the four-year term to which she was elected last November in a 
district stretching from Mira Mesa to Mission Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Recall leaders have cited a number of factors as the impetus behind what would 
be the first recall election since the City Charter was approved early this 
century. Prominent among the reasons is their dissatisfaction with Bernhardt's 
approval of a controversial redistricting plan that would shift several 
high-growth neighborhoods from her district into another council district. 
</P>
<P>
Her opponents also have complained that, since her election, Bernhardt has 
accepted campaign contributions from developers after pledging not to do so in 
last year's campaign and also fault her for hiring her roommate as her City 
Hall chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the recall effort "politics at its very worst," Bernhardt professes 
optimism that she could defend the seat that she won by upsetting two-term 
Councilman Ed Struiksma last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm exactly what I said I was 10 months ago, and once that message gets out, 
I'll win this thing," Bernhardt said. "I've done what I said I was going to do 
-- manage growth, protect the environment and respond to neighborhoods. The 
bottom line is the people running this (recall) are the same ones who backed my 
opponent last year. Voters will see through that." 
</P>
<P>
The estimated $120,000 cost for a special election also might give some voters 
pause about signing the recall petitions, or generate a backlash favoring her 
in an election, Bernhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
Disputing that theory, recall supporters argue that their major hurdle is 
simply qualifying the issue for the ballot. Believing that voters in low 
turnout elections -- as the recall could be, given that it would be the only 
race on the ballot -- tend to be motivated more by anger than by satisfaction 
with the status quo, Bernhardt's opponents contend that this is one campaign 
that literally could be over before it begins. 
</P>
<P>
"Our major battle is getting this on the ballot," said Perry Beaird, one of the 
recall effort's leaders. "If we do that, I think we'll win. We're probably 
going to end up with more signatures than the votes she got last year. That 
says a lot."

NEW PLAY BRINGS CHARITY TO THE DOOR; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: CALARTS PRODUCTION ON CITY'S HOMELESS WILL INCLUDE A RED CROSS DISPLAY 
AND PLEAS FOR CLOTHING AND FOOD ASSISTANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The whole thing began with a telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
Edward and Mildred Lewis, well-known for writing or producing successful 
Hollywood movies such as "Spartacus" and "Harold and Maude," had written a play 
about homeless people in Los Angeles and were looking for somewhere to premiere 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The husband-and-wife playwrights called Ruben Sierra, the artistic director of 
the Seattle Group Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"People had talked to them about me and the kinds of things I was interested 
in," Sierra said. "I thought it was a great play." 
</P>
<P>
But Sierra was leaving Seattle to become dean of the theater school at 
California Institute of the Arts in Valencia. He persuaded the Lewises to let 
him direct the play with students -- a perfect example of the kind of 
professional-student interaction that CalArts prides itself on. 
</P>
<P>
So, tonight, "Zone D" will premiere in the institute's Modular Theatre and will 
continue this weekend and next. But there's more to the story. The play has 
inspired a flurry of charity at the hilltop campus. 
</P>
<P>
At each performance of "Zone D," a Red Cross display will be stationed outside 
the theater doors. Audience members will be encouraged to donate clothing or 
contribute to feeding homeless people. Furthermore, there's a chance that a 
group of homeless will be bused from Los Angeles to see the play. 
</P>
<P>
The credit for all this goes to Ruthi A. Yoda, who is earning a master's degree 
at CalArts. Yoda was in charge of designing costumes for the play and, as part 
of her work, made an appointment with Red Cross officials at their Weingart 
Center downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"I started out trying to research costumes," Yoda said. "But I also asked them 
what kind of donations they might need." 
</P>
<P>
Food and clothing, the Red Cross officials answered. 
</P>
<P>
So, people who attend "Zone D" can drop off clothing or buy food coupons from 
the Red Cross display. The coupons are redeemable for meals at the Weingart 
Center's Homeless Cafe and can be dispersed in two ways: Audience members can 
keep the coupons and give them to panhandlers on the street or the coupons can 
be returned directly to the Red Cross to pay for meals served at the center. 
</P>
<P>
"At our 600-bed hotel, only 80 beds are funded for meals," said Elizabeth 
Bailey, vice president of development and public relations at the Weingart 
Center. "With these coupons, we're able to give more people food." 
</P>
<P>
The value of "Zone D," however, goes beyond donations, Bailey said. The drama 
takes place in the near future of the city, which is filled with homeless 
people who are banished to a special area. 
</P>
<P>
"The play reaches a whole different audience than we normally reach," Bailey 
said. "It helps us educate people about the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
CalArts donated a block of tickets to the Red Cross, which is seeking to 
transport homeless people from downtown to Valencia to see the play. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CalArts students outside the theater department have joined in the 
spirit of generosity. At this year's Halloween party, students will be asked to 
donate clothes for admission. 
</P>
<P>
"People here are getting inspired," Sierra said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Yoda: "The whole process has been really rewarding. We feel like we can 
help the homeless." 
</P>

GWYNN HASN'T QUIT THE RACE; 
</P>
<P>
DRAG RACING: DESPITE PARALYZING CRASH, HE STILL HAS SENSE OF HUMOR AND INTENDS 
TO KEEP WORKING. DRIVERS RAISE MONEY FOR HIS BILLS.

The last time Darrell Gwynn was in Pomona, he was going 280 m.p.h. with 4,000 
horsepower pushing him down the Fairplex drag strip in his gold and white 
top-fuel dragster. That was in February. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn is back at Pomona again this week, but when he goes down the drag strip 
it will be in a wheelchair, pushed by his father, Jerry, or his fiancee, Lisa 
Hurst. 
</P>
<P>
On Easter Sunday, Gwynn was making an exhibition run at Santa Pod Raceway in 
England when his car broke in half and smashed into a guardrail. The impact was 
like a 240-m.p.h. whiplash that snapped Gwynn's neck, paralyzing him from the 
chest down. 
</P>
<P>
The car flipped on its side and slid along the pavement with Gwynn's left arm 
hanging out. The abrasions led to massive infections that necessitated 
amputation at the elbow. He needed 23 pints of blood in the first two days 
after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't eat or drink for more than 10 days, but his waist bloated from 32 
inches to 38 as his kidneys and liver shut down. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a month Gwynn hovered between life and death. When he was flown 
home to Miami on May 20, 14 seats on a 747 were needed to accommodate medical 
personnel, life-support equipment and a bed specially designed to absorb the 
shock of landing and in-flight turbulence. Fellow driver Kenny Bernstein raised 
$35,000 from the Professional Racers &amp; Owners Assn. to finance the flight. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the accident, Gwynn was at the peak of his career. He had just 
won the Gatornationals at Gainesville, Fla., and set a National Hot Rod Assn. 
record of 4.909 seconds for a quarter mile from a standing start at Baytown, 
Tex. He had a 100-point lead in his quest for a first Winston top-fuel 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
He was 28 years old, called "The Kid" by veteran drivers on the NHRA circuit, 
and was engaged to the Orange Bowl queen. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody likes to go out on top, but that wasn't the way I had it in mind," 
Gwynn said over breakfast Thursday before heading for the Fairplex, where he 
won three Winston Finals and one Winternationals top-fuel championship between 
1986 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day is a new surprise for me in what I can do, and what I can't do," he 
said. "I guess life is always a learning experience, but I never thought I'd be 
learning how to brush my teeth and comb my hair and talk on a telephone again." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn has regained partial use of his right arm, but still has no strength in 
his grip. 
</P>
<P>
One thing he has not lost is his sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
When his doctor started to show him how to hold a pen to sign his name, Darrell 
feigned shock and said, "Anything but that. Then everyone will be wanting my 
autograph." 
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, when a bomb threat forced evacuation of a rehabilitation 
center, Gwynn said, "I bet it was Amato." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Amato was one of Gwynn's chief rivals in top-fuel racing and is the current 
points leader going into this weekend's Winston Finals, final event of the NHRA 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn is here, not just to be on hand when Frank Hawley, a former funny-car 
champion, drives Gwynn's family-owned top fueler this weekend, but also to 
handle a myriad of business deals. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a working trip," he said. "I'm not here to stay holed up in a hotel 
room and make an occasional visit to the track. 
</P>
<P>
"I have two top priorities in my life now. One, as it was before I was hurt, is 
my car. The other is the Miami Project (to Cure Paralysis). Both need funding 
and I see that as my major role now. 
</P>
<P>
"Funding for the Miami Project is especially important to me because as I look 
at it, that offers me the only possibility of walking again. Right now, with 
the type paralysis I have, there would seem to be no chance, but I will always 
have hope that scientists and doctors will find a way. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a gut feeling that the breakthrough in spinal-cord injuries may come 
before things like cancer or AIDS. If it does, I want to be a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Miami Project is something Gwynn and his family had been 
involved with since it was founded in 1985 after Marc Buoniconti, son of former 
Miami Dolphin linebacker Nick Buoniconti, was paralyzed by a football injury 
while playing for the Citadel against East Tennessee State. 
</P>
<P>
"Back when I started racing for Coors, they encouraged their drivers to become 
involved with a charity, so when they asked me, I suggested the Miami Project," 
Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just around the corner from us and I've often gone over there and had 
talks with the guys in wheelchairs and taken my car over for them to see. Then, 
whoa, six months later, I'm one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"(Nick Buoniconti) got the ball rolling and I want to take it from there and 
get it to snowballing. Nick hit the sports community (for sponsorship), but I'm 
going to start a project in my name with hopes of helping raise $13 million a 
year for the project. I'm going to make the Forbes 500 my project. I think when 
they hear my story, I'll get some serious donations." 
</P>
<P>
One dramatic moment in Gwynn's rehabilitation occurred June 10 when Hawley, 
driving the Gwynn car for the first time, won the Springnationals at Columbus, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"From the first minute that I could communicate with my dad in the hospital in 
England, I told him I wanted to keep the team together and the car running," 
Gwynn said. "Before I realized how bad I was hurt, when I was laying there 
inside the wreck, one of my first thoughts was that the boys (in the crew) back 
home were getting ready to pack up for Atlanta and I was going to miss the 
race." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Gwynn, Darrell's father and crew chief since the day he built his son a 
40-m.p.h. dragster when he was 8 or 9, had mixed feelings about returning to 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say my heart was in it, but I decided that whatever Darrell wanted, 
that was what we would do," Jerry said. "And he was determined that the team 
would continue. I know at first he felt he would be back driving, but even when 
that prospect waned, he never lost his enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
Hawley, a two-time funny-car champion who had dabbled briefly in top-fuel 
dragsters for Larry Minor in 1988 and 1989, was in Gainesville running his drag 
racing school when he was asked if he would like the seat in Gwynn's car. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first heard about Darrell's wreck, I was stunned, just like everyone 
else in racing," Hawley said. "It was like a pall at Atlanta when Darrell 
wasn't there. I was down there for my school and I gave Shirley (Muldowney) a 
note to give him because I knew she was flying over there to see him. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea they would run the car again, but a couple of weeks later I got 
a call from Jerry asking me if I'd drive for him. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I got to Columbus, I never felt such pressure in my life. It seemed like 
everyone was watching me. I was sort of between a rock and a hard place because 
my only options were to do OK or to screw up. Everybody knew the car was fast." 
</P>
<P>
Hawley did OK. He was fast qualifier and defeated Amato in the final round. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I cried all day after I heard that Frank won," Darrell said. "I knew 
it was going to be tough on everyone. My crew had been a bunch of pals since we 
were teen-agers and I knew it would be tough on them with a stranger driving. 
And my dad was spending so much time with me that he didn't give the car as 
much attention as usual. It was unbelievable when Frank won the first time 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Hawley also won two weeks ago at the Texas Motorplex when he beat Eddie Hill in 
the final round. In the semifinals, he defeated defending series champion Gary 
Ormsby, preventing Ormsby from catching Amato before this weekend's final 
event. 
</P>
<P>
Next season, Hawley will continue to drive the Gwynn machine. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to become the first driver to win world championships in top fuel and 
funny car," Hawley said. "That gives me a little extra incentive, as if I 
needed any driving this car for Gwynn. There's a certain aura about being in 
his car that sort of defies description. But from a personal standpoint, I'd 
like to have my own category in the history books." 
</P>
<P>
The closest anyone has come is Don (Snake) Prudhomme, who won four funny-car 
championships from 1975 to 1978 after a top-fuel career in which his highest 
finish was runner-up to Benny Osborne in 1967. Hawley won funny car titles in 
1982 and 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank was the obvious choice, as far as I was concerned," Gwynn said. "I 
wanted someone I wouldn't have to worry about, who wouldn't have to have his 
hand held. Not many drivers were available, and of the ones who were I knew 
Frank was the only one I wouldn't have to baby-sit. When he won at Columbus, I 
knew I'd made the right choice because it's always tough to fill someone else's 
shoes. And he did it." 
</P>
<P>
Another emotional outing for Gwynn involved a softball game in Reading, Pa., 
arranged by Bernstein and John Ernesto of the Reading Eagle, between drag 
racers, there for weekend competition, and NASCAR stock car drivers, who were 
in nearby Dover, Del., for a race. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't surprise me to see all the drag racers there, but I couldn't believe 
it when every stock car driver I'd ever heard of was there, too," Gwynn said. 
"Outside of a half dozen, I didn't know any of them, but they'd all come to the 
game on my behalf. It was sort of overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
"Every major team in racing seemed to have someone there. Ones who didn't play 
were in the stands. Even Bill France (president of NASCAR) was there. And the 
stands were filled, too." 
</P>
<P>
The drag racers beat the stock car drivers, 21-20, with a five-run rally in the 
bottom of the ninth. A crowd estimated by city officials to be 15,000 filled 
Reading Municipal Stadium, whose capacity for its minor league professional 
team is closer to 7,500. 
</P>
<P>
"There were people lining the outfield eight to 10 deep," Jerry Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
The event, which included autograph sessions and auctions of sports gear, 
raised $150,000 to help defray Gwynn's mounting medical expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing before ever brought drag racers together like that," Hawley said. "We 
all have friends in the business, but most of our time is spent rooting against 
each other. I know I never rooted for Amato or Bernstein to do well, but that 
night when Dick LaHaie hit a home run, I found myself jumping up and screaming 
like it was the World Series. Until then, the only time I'd get excited 
watching LaHaie was when he smoked his tires. 
</P>
<P>
"All the guys had their arms around one another, cheering and yelling. It had 
almost a Hollywood atmosphere to it. It couldn't have been scripted any more 
exciting. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I'd see the day when a drag race took second billing to a 
softball game, but the next day when we were qualifying for the Keystone 
Nationals, all anyone was talking about was the softball game. 
</P>
<P>
"When (funny-car driver) Kenny Koretsky hit that single to score the winning 
runs with two out in the bottom of the ninth, you'd have thought all of us had 
won the Winston Finals." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn, his eyes sparkling at the memory of it all, listened as Hawley described 
his feelings, and added: "Winning is winning. . . . It's what it's all about, 
in drag racing or softball."

HOLYFIELD POPS BUSTER'S BALLOON;

<P>
Evander Holyfield caught Buster Douglas flush on the mouth with a short, 
powerful, right hand in the third round, knocked him cold, and became the 
undisputed heavyweight champion of the world at the Mirage hotel Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield won boxing's most valuable prize with a counterpunch. Douglas, who 
had lost the first two rounds, threw a wild, sweeping right uppercut at 
Holyfield that missed badly. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield then stepped in with the punch that would make him champion, a short, 
jolting right that snapped Douglas' head back. Douglas then toppled over onto 
his left side and rolled over on his back. He rose to one elbow, feebly touched 
his face with his right glove as if to see if he were bleeding, then his head 
went back to the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
Official time: 1:10 of the third round. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas was on his back for several minutes. Holyfield's cornermen nearly had 
to leap over Douglas when they poured into the ring, where they celebrated 
wildly before a crowd of 16,100. It was a stunning finish to a fight that 
pitted a flabby, 246-pound champion in his first defense of a championship that 
he won as a 42-1 underdog last February in Japan, when he knocked out Mike 
Tyson. Holyfield, at 208 pounds, was never troubled by Douglas' superior size 
or his vaunted left jab. In fact, Holyfield won the first two rounds on the 
strength of his own jab. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas had punished Tyson with a thumping jab for 10 rounds in Tokyo, but not 
once did he even interrupt Holyfield's rhythm Thursday. By early in the third 
round, Holyfield was even triple-jabbing Douglas with a lead left punch that 
some might call a half-hook. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield went off as an 8-5 favorite, making Douglas only the 12th heavyweight 
champion to enter the ring as an underdog. And Douglas, who earned $19,075,000, 
looked like it as he lay on his back, staring blankly at the night desert sky. 
</P>
<P>
It was the end of a long wait for Holyfield. He had been the No. 1 contender 
for more than a year and was scheduled to meet Tyson in a title bout in 
Atlantic City, N.J., last June. 
</P>
<P>
But Douglas, in Tokyo, ended that plan. Holyfield then had to endure a long, 
complicated lawsuit last summer -- involving Don King, Douglas and Steve Wynn, 
president of the Mirage hotel -- before the Douglas-Holyfield fight date could 
be set. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield is the strong, silent type. But not Lou Duva, his 67-year-old 
trainer. 
</P>
<P>
A friend of the late Rocky Marciano, Duva waddled into the ring to embrace 
Holyfield. Then the trainer went to a neutral corner, pointed to the sky and 
yelled at ringsiders: "This was for Rocky, that's who this was for -- this was 
for Rocky Marciano!" 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath, Holyfield, uncharacteristically animated, paid tribute to 
Jesus, his entire training staff, his strength coach, his promoter and his 
mother, to whom, he said, he had dedicated the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield's promoter, Dan Duva, then indicated that Holyfield, having just 
knocked out a 246-pound heavyweight, would next take on 260-pound, 42-year-old 
George Foreman. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield, 28, who earned $8,025,000 Thursday, is looking at a purse in the 
$20-million range for a Foreman fight. Mike Tyson? "He'll have to get in line, 
like everyone else -- he'll get his chance," Duva said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Holyfield-Foreman would be held next March or April. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, who was 231 pounds when he stopped Tyson eight months ago, said his 
weight wasn't a factor, but acknowledged that Holyfield was. 
</P>
<P>
"I got caught with a good shot, and by the time I picked up the count, it was 
over," said the 30-year-old Douglas, who was the 17th heavyweight champion to 
lose the title in his first defense. "I was hoping to get some rounds under my 
belt, to get some rhythm. My weight had no bearing on it, and I'm not 
embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield (25-0 with 21 knockouts, the last 13 in a row) did not dominate 
Douglas (30-5-1, 20 knockouts), and never really hurt him before the knockout 
punch. But he was the superior boxer. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas apparently wasn't exactly trembling with fear in the dressing room, 
shortly before the fight. They had to wake him up for the pre-fight meeting 
with the referee, Mills Lane. 
</P>
<P>
"We went into his room, and one of his trainers had to shake his arm, to wake 
him up," Nevada boxing commissioner Duane Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
The oddest aspect of this matchup was the 6-foot-2 Holyfield's ability to reach 
the 6-4 Douglas with his jab/hook. 
</P>
<P>
Both started off with caution, and Holyfield would later credit his patience 
for his victory. Early in the first round, he caught Douglas as he was backing 
up with a medium-velocity left hook. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield stung him again seconds later with a short hook that made the 
champion stumble as he came off the ropes. And at the bell to end the first 
round, Holyfield caught Douglas with a running right hand. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield clearly won both the first and second rounds. In the second, he 
increased the tempo with his jabs. Also in the second, Douglas, although he had 
not been truly hurt yet, was breathing through an open mouth. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the second, Holyfield seemed to be in command. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the third, he drove Douglas into the ropes with a left hook to the 
ribs and a right hand to Douglas' biggest target, his belly. Then, at center 
ring, as Douglas missed badly with a right uppercut, Holyfield stepped in with 
the short, explosive punch that gave him the heavyweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
The punch snapped Douglas' head back, and then his legs left him. He crumpled 
softly to the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
As Douglas' cornermen surrounded their fighter, co-trainer John Russell softly 
massaged Douglas' face to revive him, then rubbed his face with a wet sponge. 
In two minutes, he was sitting up, then he sat on a stool. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield won with confidence, smoothness and efficiency. Some wondered if he 
had fought his best fights in beating Michael Dokes and Alex Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
It did not appear that way Thursday. Holyfield knocked out the man who knocked 
out Mike Tyson. And it didn't surprise him in the least, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He was asked 30 minutes later if winning the title had sunk in yet. 
</P>
<P>
"It has," he said. "I felt going into the fight I would be the champion of the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
On the undercard, Riddick Bowe knocked out Bert Cooper in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Bowe, 6-5 and 230, a 1988 Olympic silver medalist who grew up in Tyson's 
Brooklyn neighborhood, improved his record to 20-0 with his 16th knockout.

What do you want to say was the biggest heist in history? 
</P>
<P>
The Brink's robbery? 
</P>
<P>
John Dillinger's holdup sprees? Bonnie and Clyde's? The theft of a Van Gogh 
from a Paris art gallery? The looting of the art treasures of Europe by Nazis? 
The S&amp;L swindles? 
</P>
<P>
How about the Buster Douglas Caper? 
</P>
<P>
James (Buster) Douglas pulled a heist here Thursday that, for its sheer 
audacity, pales all these others by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Buster walked off with almost $20 million by the mere expedient of showing up 
with a satchel (not to mention the one around his middle), scooping up the 
money and running. 
</P>
<P>
Buster slickered the American sporting public and the promoters as surely as 
any embezzler who ever took a plane to Rio with the bank's receipts. W.C. 
Fields would be open-mouthed with admiration. So would anyone who ever 
absconded with a widows and orphans fund. 
</P>
<P>
You'd have more respect for him if he did it with a gold brick -- or a gun. He 
did it with a smile and a wink. He got almost $20 million for pulling off the 
most elaborate practical joke and swindle in the annals of the heavyweight 
fight division. 
</P>
<P>
You see, Buster, for his millions, had made a compact with the public that he 
would show up in some kind of physical shape and make an honest effort to 
defend the heavyweight title he won so shockingly from Mike Tyson in February. 
</P>
<P>
Buster Douglas entered the ring looking like something that should be floating 
over a Thanksgiving Day parade. He ran a crooked wheel, is what he did. He 
dealt from the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
You know, when an actor agrees to play Hamlet, he doesn't show up and do baggy 
pants shtick. If a guy agrees to sing "Carmen" and shows up drunk singing 
Irving Berlin, they throw eggs at him. And refund the money. 
</P>
<P>
It's very clear Buster Douglas had little or no intention of doing any real 
fighting Thursday night. He came into the ring as out of shape as King Farouk 
and went through the motions. Jack Johnson put up a better fight against Jess 
Willard -- and that fight was in the bag. 
</P>
<P>
You knew there was going to be no fight when Buster stood on the scales 
Wednesday afternoon in the hotel ballroom and they topped out at 246 pounds. 
Now, that's OK for sumo wrestlers or a major league umpire, but it doesn't work 
when you have to get into the ring with a fighter who looks like something they 
found in a Greek ruin. 
</P>
<P>
Buster took us, ladies and gentlemen. He made suckers of us all. He just sat 
there and lapped up the calories and lived the good life and took the suckers 
for everything they had -- or almost $20 million, which is close enough -- and 
laughed all the way to the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
He got annihilated by a guy he outweighed by 38 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Lots of guys drank their way out of the heavyweight championship. Buster ate 
his way out of it. 
</P>
<P>
He had a compact with the public and he mocked it. In the old days, they would 
hold up the purse when things like this happened, when one guy showed up in no 
shape to fight. 
</P>
<P>
Buster has a history of this kind of hanky-panky. You look on his ring record 
and there is a telltale "NC" on it for a fight in Columbus in 1984. "NC" stands 
for "No contest" and it indicates a bout where the referee threw both 
contestants out for not trying or otherwise making a travesty of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
Buster had his second No Contest at the Mirage Hotel here Thursday night. Only 
this time, his opponent would have none of it. Evander Holyfield came to fight, 
all right. He cuffed Buster around at will from the opening bell. It was almost 
as if Buster hadn't shown up, just his shadow. In effect, that was correct. 
Evander wasn't even breathing hard when the fight came to its sudden but 
predictable end when Holyfield threw a short but explosive right hand in 
Buster's fat mouth. 
</P>
<P>
In the shape he was in, Buster probably couldn't have gotten up at 10 if he 
tripped over his own shoelaces. But if he made any effort to get up, it didn't 
show. He appeared to find it very comfortable on the floor, like a hammock, and 
the suspicion lurks he'd spent plenty of his time prone since he won the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Did he just run into a buzz-saw? Well, Evander Holyfield is not exactly The 
Brown Bomber or the Manassa Mauler himself. He has 20 knockouts in his pro 
career, but the likes of Tyrone Booze and Eric Winbush have gone the distance 
with him, to say nothing of Lionel Byarm. Dwight Qawi went 15. 
</P>
<P>
Evander Holyfield liked the sensation of punching a fat old party around. He 
announced after the fight his next opponent would be George Foreman. It's too 
bad Elsa Maxwell or Orson Welles aren't with us anymore. They might get a shot. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I guess it was a triumph for clean living, hard work and a lean cuisine. 
Horatio Alger would approve. So would Frank Merriwell. Buster could have set 
dieting back 100 years and bankrupted the country's fat farms if he prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't prevail. The worst part of it was, he obviously knew he wouldn't. He 
was observed doing roadwork two days before the fight on a golf course and he 
looked like a guy chasing a slow bus. Buster had the look on his face of a guy 
dreaming of chicken and gravy. 
</P>
<P>
The only way he could have beaten Evander Holyfield Thursday night was to eat 
him.

NEW POSITION A SNAP FOR MONTOYA

Guard Max Montoya is learning another position, long snapper, and the Raiders 
plan to use him in that capacity if Dan Turk, their No. 1 snapper on punts and 
field goals, is injured. "I did it back in 1986 at Cincinnati," Montoya said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just doing it for emergency situations. Hopefully, I'm the backup to the 
backup's backup." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are also using quarterback Jay Schroeder as a backup holder on 
field goals. Punter Jeff Gossett normally holds for field goals. Schroeder is 
also the backup punter. 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Mike Dyal, who suffered a pulled hamstring in the Raiders' 17-13 
victory at Seattle last month, hopes to return for next week's game at Kansas 
City. 
</P>
<P>
But the Raiders don't appear to be as confident as Dyal, having signed Ken 
Whisenhunt, who was cut by the Washington Redskins last month. "I was surprised 
when the Raiders called, but I was very happy," Whisenhunt said. 
</P>
<P>
A 12th-round draft pick from Georgia Tech in 1985, Whisenhunt spent four 
seasons with the Atlanta Falcons before signing with the Redskins as a Plan B 
free agent last year. 
</P>
<P>
Whisenhunt apparently impressed the Raiders with his performance in the 
Falcons' 12-6 victory over the Raiders in 1988.

WELCH FILES FOR FREE AGENCY; JACK CLARK OFFERED ARBITRATION 
</P>

From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Welch of the Oakland Athletics, the first 27-game winner in the major 
leagues since Steve Carlton 18 years ago, filed for free agency Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Among the others filing were Juan Agosto of Houston, Tom Browning and Rick 
Mahler of Cincinnati, Randy Bush of Minnesota, Don Carman of Philadelphia, Ron 
Kittle of Baltimore and Dave Schmidt of Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
That puts the total of players filing for free agency at 59. The Orioles have 
until Dec. 15 to exercise a 1991 option on Kittle. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Padres prevented first baseman Jack Clark from becoming a free 
agent by offering him salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Jack Morris' agent said that the pitcher did not exercise his 
$2.1-million option for 1991 so as not to jeopardize his position in the third 
collusion case. The Tigers had offered him arbitration.

ANGELS WILL NOT OFFER DOWNING ARBITRATION; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: DECISION COULD MEAN END OF DESIGNATED HITTER'S CAREER WITH THE CLUB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that probably signals the end of Brian Downing's Angel career, the 
club announced Thursday that it won't go to arbitration with the 40-year-old 
designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Downing, whose strong second-half performance carried him to a .273 batting 
average, 14 home runs and 51 runs batted in during his club-record 13th season, 
can file for free agency. He can also re-sign with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Downing, who has been undergoing treatment for the side-muscle injury that has 
hindered him the past two seasons, could not be reached for comment Thursday, 
and his wife, Cheryl, said she did not know her husband's plans. Downing had 
said during the season that he was considering retirement, but his sentiments 
changed when his playing time increased and his batting average rose. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Mike Port said the announcement does not preclude a return for 
Downing, who is the Angels' leader in games played, at-bats, runs, hits, 
doubles, home runs, RBIs, extra-base hits and total bases. Port and Dan 
O'Brien, the Angels' senior vice president for baseball operations, met with 
Downing Thursday in a session Port characterized as "cordial" without 
disclosing the outcome of their discussion. 
</P>
<P>
"What this will mean as far as the relationship between Brian and the Angels is 
unknown at this point," Port said. "I have to say that only time will tell. 
It's difficult to say at this point whether he would fit into our plans for 
next season. We, like a number of clubs, are going through our roster 
situation, what with free agency, free-look free agency (which could be granted 
a number of players affected by baseball's third collusion case) and trades. 
It's difficult to address until the rosters are closer to being set . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We just felt this was a situation that called for a face-to-face meeting. What 
he may choose to do is something I would not prefer to comment on." 
</P>
<P>
In a formality, the Angels also announced that they won't go to arbitration 
with pitcher Greg Minton, who announced his retirement after the final home 
stand of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Donnie Hill filed for free agency Thursday, but it's expected that the Angels 
will re-sign him. Hill signed with the Angels as a free agent in January. He 
served as a backup infielder, hitting .264.

TV-RADIO: DOUGLAS DIDN'T GIVE THE VIEWERS MONEY'S WORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well, that sure wasn't worth $40, or whatever it cost. 
</P>
<P>
Indications are the pay-per-view take will break all records, but Buster 
Douglas was as big a pay-per-view bust against Evander Holyfield as Michael 
Spinks was in 1988 when he lasted only 91 seconds against Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
Showtime, which paid more than $2 million for the delayed rights to Thursday 
night's illusion at the Mirage, should demand a refund. 
</P>
<P>
Telecast host Jim Hill made a good point when he noted that Douglas didn't even 
try to get up. Hill reminded viewers that Tyson said Douglas was a quitter and 
added that was what a lot of people are going to be saying. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps commentator Ferdie Pacheco had the quote of the night when, in the 
first round, he said of Douglas: "You can see the jelly in his body, especially 
in his breasts." 
</P>
<P>
Pacheco came across as very pro-Holyfield, but obviously not without reason. 
</P>
<P>
Buster Douglas turned this $40 fight into one that wasn't worth a nickel. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Chandler, an NFL wide receiver for 12 seasons, knows something about 
amazing games. 
</P>
<P>
He once played two quarters with a ruptured spleen. Adrenaline kept him going, 
masking that he was in critical condition. He almost died in a hospital that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The former USC star's whole career was somewhat amazing. He played nine seasons 
with the Buffalo Bills and three with the Raiders despite nine major operations 
along the way. Now he is again involved in amazing games. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler is the host of a new show, "Amazing Games," which makes its debut on 
ESPN Sunday at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The first of five planned shows takes viewers on a tour of Thailand and a look 
at such sports as elephant soccer, Thai kick-boxing and an incredible game 
called sepak takraw, a form of volleyball played by using the feet. 
</P>
<P>
The well-produced, fast-paced one-hour program also takes a look at two 
"amazing" U.S. sports, Frisbee football and horse pulling. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler this week returned from the Soviet Union, where he filmed another 
segment. One sport that left an impression was motoball, which is soccer played 
on motorcycles. "I'm really surprised it hasn't caught on here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The country left an impression too, but not a good one. "I met a lot of good 
people, a lot of great people, but this is a country that is falling apart," he 
said. "It's broken, and nobody knows how to fix it." 
</P>
<P>
Chandler and some members of his crew did eat out one night -- at the Moscow 
McDonald's. "Believe me, that was a real treat," he said, "although we had to 
stand in a line that was 100 yards long." 
</P>
<P>
Add Chandler: The new show marks a return to television for the personable 
Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
He worked as a football commentator for NBC in 1983, then as a sports reporter 
for Channel 7 for one year, before a two-year stint with Channel 2's "Two on 
the Town." 
</P>
<P>
After that, he became the marketing and publicity director of the Ritz-Carlton 
hotel chain, working for his friend Leo Hart, a former Bill quarterback who is 
a Ritz-Carlton vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler, who has a law degree, is now a West Coast representative for a New 
York-based investment firm, the Noel Group, which allows him to take 10 days 
off at a time to shoot "Amazing Games" segments. He went to Japan in September 
and has a trip planned to New Zealand and Australia in January. 
</P>
<P>
College snafu: ABC is in somewhat of a jam this Saturday. In March, the network 
committed to televising USC at Arizona State, which is OK if you're a Trojan 
fan. But the big game in the Pacific 10 is California at Washington. 
</P>
<P>
ABC spokesman Mark Mandel said his network tried to get permission from the 
Pac-10 to switch games, but Commissioner Tom Hansen suggested that ABC instead 
televise both games on a regional basis. ABC, because of production costs, 
declined that offer. 
</P>
<P>
The Bear-Husky game won't be on Prime Ticket, either. If Prime Ticket did the 
game, it would have to be switched to 3:30 p.m., because ABC owns exclusive 
rights to the 12:30-3:30 time period. 
</P>
<P>
But a 3:30 start would mean lighting would be needed before the game was over, 
and the University of Washington, when it added an upper deck to Husky Stadium 
in 1988, made an agreement with area residents that it would not use lights 
this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
So Prime Ticket instead will show Oregon State at UCLA at 3:30 p.m. and 
Washington State at Arizona at 7 p.m., and Cal-Washington goes untelevised. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about a dedicated father. Announcer Bob Miller of the Kings will miss 
Wayne Gretzky's attempt at scoring his 2,000th point tonight so that he can 
attend his son Kevin's graduation from Brooks Institute of Photography in Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"I made the commitment in August," said Miller, who hasn't missed a game since 
1984, when his mother died. 
</P>
<P>
So radio announcer Nick Nickson will fill in, with the Prime Ticket telecast 
becoming a simulcast. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ticket did some recent juggling and took tonight's game at Winnipeg off 
its schedule, then had to put it back on. 
</P>
<P>
World Series aftermath: Tim McCarver's popularity seems to have dropped. The 
main problem was he somehow picked up Dan Dierdorf disease, excessive talking. 
</P>
<P>
He made some good points, but he also tended to ramble on. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, he got carried away trying to tell viewers that you can't watch 
the wind. "You can watch the effects of the wind, but you can't watch the 
wind," he kept saying. 
</P>
<P>
Who cares? 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
NBC's 4 1/2 hours of Breeders' Cup coverage Saturday begins at 10:30 a.m. Dick 
Enberg and Tom Hammond are again the hosts, and Tom Durkin is again the race 
caller. Santa Anita's Trevor Denman will be part of the telecast, but only as a 
contributing analyst. That's like having Joe Montana on your team and using him 
only on special teams. . . . SportsChannel America offers a three-hour 
Breeders' Cup preview tonight at 8:30 and a two-hour review Sunday at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Add horse racing: "Thoroughbred Nightly," the Southland's only nightly radio 
talk show about horse racing, is in its second year on Anaheim's KORG (1190). 
The program, with John Hernandez and Bruno DeJulio, is on every racing day at 9 
p.m. weeknights and 8 p.m. weekends. KORG is also the Los Angeles outlet for 
"Thoroughbred Connection," a five-minute nationally syndicated show with Jim 
McKay. . . . Channel 18 offers a preview of the $1-million California Cup 
Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., with Denman serving as host and Gil Stratton providing 
features on the seven races. The California Cup will be run at Santa Anita on 
Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
With the Raiders off and the Rams not playing until Monday, Los Angeles gets an 
extra NFL game Sunday. The lineup: Minnesota at Green Bay at 10 a.m. on Channel 
2, with Dick Stockton and Merlin Olsen, followed by Washington at the New York 
Giants, with Pat Summerall and John Madden; Cleveland at San Francisco on 
Channel 4 at 1 p.m., with Charlie Jones and Bill Walsh, and then Cincinnati at 
Atlanta on TNT at 5 p.m. Jones is filling in for Enberg because of his 
Breeders' Cup assignment. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Raiders are off, Joe McDonnell's Sunday KFI radio talk show 
will run from 4 to 8 p.m. . . . Plans for radio broadcasts of Loyola 
Marymount's basketball games to be carried on KIEV have reportedly fallen 
through. . . . Meanwhile, UC Irvine has made a deal with KWIZ-FM (96.7). Bill 
Macdonald of Prime Ticket and Rob Halvaks will share play-by-play duties, with 
former coach Tim Tift doing commentary. 
</P>
<P>
The Great Shootout, a new tennis event, will be televised by ABC Nov. 11 from 
Milan, Italy. Eight of the world's top tennis players will play a series of 
tiebreakers for a first prize of $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
"NBA Inside Stuff," NBC's new weekly basketball show, makes its debut Saturday 
at 10 a.m. Ahmad Rashad and Julie Moran are the hosts. . . . FNN Sports 
handicapper Wayne Root, who is 27-10 after correctly predicting four of five 
games last weekend, has a new show, "Huddle Up," which makes its debut Saturday 
at 7:30 p.m. . . . George Foreman will be profiled on "American Chronicles" on 
the Fox network Saturday night at 9:30. . . . ABC's Keith Jackson will be a 
guest on the conversation segment of ESPN's SportsCenter Sunday night at 8.

Jamelle Holieway, the former University of Oklahoma quarterback accused of 
using cocaine during a federal trial in Oklahoma City last week, Thursday was 
reinstated a week after being fired as a walk-on assistant football coach at 
Long Beach City College. 
</P>
<P>
Holieway was released the day after his former roommate Charles Thompson 
testified that the two used cocaine together while playing for the Sooners. 
Holieway, a star at Banning High in Wilmington, was a member of the Oklahoma 
team from 1984 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Holieway said he received a letter from Long Beach officials saying the firing 
had nothing to do with Thompson's allegations.

Long Beach officials could not be reached Thursday night. ELLIOTT ALMOND

Larry Todd, a former wide receiver and running back for the Oakland Raiders, 
died recently of cancer in an Oakland hospital, it was announced. He was 50. 
</P>
<P>
Todd was recently diagnosed with myeloidosis, a form of cancer, and died Oct. 
17. 
</P>
<P>
Todd was troubled by injuries during his six seasons with the Raiders from 1965 
to 1970. One of his best games came during his rookie season when he rushed 20 
times for 134 yards and one touchdown against the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
He was limited by a broken arm in 1968 and played out his career as a running 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Todd kept quiet about playing with the Raiders while working for the Alameda 
County Social Services department, said George Hewitt, head of management 
services. "When I asked him if he was the person who played for the Raiders, he 
replied, 'Yeah, I did,' but he didn't elaborate," Hewitt said.

IF UNDEFEATED MEADOW STAR FINISHES FIRST AGAIN, CHARITY IS BIG WINNER

If Meadow Star, the undefeated 2-year-old filly, wins her Breeders' Cup race at 
Belmont Park Saturday, the monetary winners as usual would be her jockey, her 
trainer and the bettors who supported her. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest winner of all would be the Children's Rescue Fund, which 
provides assistance for abused and homeless children. Carl Icahn already is a 
winner, just for a promise. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn, the TWA chairman, owns Meadow Star, and a week ago he announced that his 
share of all the filly's future earnings will be donated to the fund. This 
could be a substantial windfall for the charity that Icahn founded, since the 
winner's cut of the $1-million Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies is $450,000, 
minus 10% apiece for the trainer and the jockey. 
</P>
<P>
There have been previous instances of horse owners donating money to charities, 
but veteran racing officials cannot recall a proposition as potentially 
beneficial as Icahn's. Meadow Star has won six consecutive races, all of them 
by comfortable margins, and at 3-5 on the morning line she is the heaviest 
favorite for the seven Breeders' Cup races. 
</P>
<P>
A victory Saturday would also make Meadow Star one of the favorites for next 
year's Kentucky Derby, and although only three fillies have won that race, one 
of them -- Genuine Risk -- was trained by Le Roy Jolley, and he says he plans 
to nominate Icahn's horse for the 1991 Triple Crown races. 
</P>
<P>
"I was down at Laurel (in Maryland) for some races last weekend," Jolley said. 
"And the reaction to Mr. Icahn's offer of the Meadow Star purses struck a very 
warm chord among racing people and fans there. Many people I had never met came 
up to me and wished me luck. It was a unique experience." 
</P>
<P>
Icahn, 54, grew up in New York, in the borough of Queens. The son of a lawyer 
and a schoolteacher, he was not underprivileged. After graduating from 
Princeton, he dropped out of medical school because he was more interested in 
corporate affairs. His philanthropic interests are widespread: He belongs to 
hospital and library boards, does work for the blind and founded a program for 
the prevention of child abuse at New York Hospital. The Children's Rescue Fund 
builds houses, provides social service programs and helps mothers with drug 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see some strange things happening if you take a look around," Icahn 
said. "You can see kids hungry and struggling at one end of the street, and 
then at the other end you can see people doing well and throwing parties. This 
program (the children's fund) is designed for the end of the street that's 
doing poorly." 
</P>
<P>
Icahn came into racing in 1985, immediately spending millions of dollars on 
broodmares, and he boards more than 40 mares at two farms in Central Kentucky. 
He was a partner with Peter Brant in the ownership of Gulch, who won the 
Breeders' Cup Sprint in 1988, and last year, Icahn's Rose's Cantina was fourth 
in the Distaff. 
</P>
<P>
Brant, who this year received a three-month prison sentence over tax 
irregularities, took his horses away from Jolley in 1988 and sent them to Wayne 
Lukas, who saddled Gulch for his winning Breeders' Cup race. Icahn, however, 
didn't sever his racing relationship with Jolley, and after Meadow Star, a 
daughter of Meadowlake and Inreality Star, was bought for $90,000 at a yearling 
auction, she was sent to the trainer who won the Kentucky Derby with Foolish 
Pleasure in 1975 and Genuine Risk in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Meadow Star made her debut at Belmont in June, winning by more than five 
lengths in a five-furlong clocking of :58 4/5. Since then, she has five stakes 
victories, the most recent on Oct. 6 at Belmont, where she ran as far as a mile 
for the first time and won the Frizette by 14 lengths. The Breeders' Cup race 
is only one-sixteenth of a mile farther. 
</P>
<P>
"The way she's running, next year she will beat the colts," said Jose Santos, 
who rides Meadow Star. 
</P>
<P>
Champagne Glow was second in the Frizette and is running in the Breeders' Cup, 
but her trainer, Joe Pierce, has no delusions. "Our filly is a nice filly," he 
said after the Frizette, "but we'll be running for second in the Breeders' 
Cup." 
</P>
<P>
In comparing Meadow Star with Genuine Risk, Jolley suggests that there's no 
comparison. "This filly (Meadow Star) is stronger physically and more durable," 
Jolley said. "Genuine Risk was more delicate, and she gave so much of herself 
every race that you had to be protective of her. Meadow Star has a great 
mentality, a great positive attitude. I think she would run the same no matter 
who she ran against." 
</P>
<P>
If Go for Wand beats Bayakoa in Saturday's Breeders' Cup Distaff, she would 
probably thrust herself into a two-way battle with Criminal Type for 
horse-of-the-year honors. Criminal Type's season, and probably his career, is 
over because of an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
However, if Go for Wand doesn't win, and Meadow Star does, Jolley's filly would 
also become a horse-of-the-year candidate. When Secretariat was a 2-year-old in 
1972, he was voted horse of the year, but it's been much longer since a 
2-year-old filly took the national championship. Moccasin, the only one, shared 
the award with Roman Brother in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn's charity cannot benefit from the voting, since the horse-of-the-year 
title is not a monetary award. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Besides donating Meadow Star's purse money, Carl Icahn said he will also match 
any contributions that are made to the Children's Rescue Fund in the filly's 
name. . . . Rambling Willie, the pacer in retirement at the Kentucky Horse Park 
in Lexington, Ky., earned $2 million, and his ownership contributed 10% of the 
purses to a church in West Mansfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Le Roy Jolley has won with one of 12 Breeders' Cup starters, Manila 
taking the Turf in 1986. Jose Santos rode Manila. Gulch was sixth and seventh 
under Jolley in the Breeders' Cup before he won the Sprint for Wayne Lukas. . . 
. Don LaPlace, the Belmont Park handicapper who made the morning lines for the 
Breeders' Cup, said he never had a stakes favorite as high as 4-1 until he hung 
that price on Dispersal in the $3-million Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Craig Perret, who won the Juvenile last year with Rhythm, said the same 
colt, who is running in the Classic, gives him the best chance Saturday for 
another Breeders' Cup victory.

A SLOW BURN OVER LIBRARY CLOSURE; 
</P>
<P>
ASBESTOS: A REMOVAL PROJECT IS TAKING LONGER THAN EXPECTED, FORCING VALLEY 
COLLEGE STUDENTS TO USE OTHER FACILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The 20,000 students at Valley College have not been able to use the campus 
library since classes began in September because an asbestos removal project 
has taken weeks longer than planned. 
</P>
<P>
Originally scheduled to reopen last month, the library has remained closed 
because workers found more asbestos than anticipated and have had difficulty 
reaching asbestos in crawl spaces in the ceiling. As a result, students have 
had to go to other college and city libraries to study and do research. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is really angry," said Alaine Jelsvik, president of the school's 
Associated Student Union. Jelsvik said students may organize a study-in protest 
in the Administration Building to show their displeasure at being without a 
library during midterm exams, which are scheduled for next week and the week 
after. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes without saying that it's an impossible situation," librarian Cynthia 
Siskin said. Siskin and 10 other library staff members have been working out of 
cramped quarters near the cafeteria while the 120,000-book collection remains 
wrapped in plastic. 
</P>
<P>
The delay has been caused in part by bureaucratic tangles within the Los 
Angeles Community College District and environmental regulations that restrict 
the pace at which work can proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos is a cancer-causing fibrous mineral once widely used for insulation. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators don't expect the library to reopen until mid-November because 
crews are still making repairs to the 18,000-square-foot building. P.W. 
Stephens Contractors Inc. was hired for $300,000 to remove asbestos at the 
campus. Company officials told the vice president of administration, Mary Ann 
Breckell, that their crews would be out of the building by late next week. It 
will take an additional week or so for librarians to prepare the library for 
student use, Siskin said. 
</P>
<P>
Lonnie Briggs, branch manager of P.W. Stephens, said work is proceeding "as 
fast as is safe." Briggs said asbestos in the building was removed by late 
September and crews now are replacing the ceiling and electrical parts that 
were removed during the process. 
</P>
<P>
Briggs said that some of the delay occurred because subcontractors such as 
electricians could not enter the building to prepare a work plan until the area 
received clearance from an independent inspector. And David Ogne, building and 
grounds administrator at the college, said work was further complicated because 
the building has been remodeled three times, cutting off access to some areas. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the project got off to a bad start. Cleanup was originally scheduled 
to begin in June, but the district had problems issuing the contracts needed 
for work to commence. And when the contracts were issued and work began in 
August, college employees had not removed furniture in the library, which was 
part of the deal, district chancellor Donald Phelps said. 
</P>
<P>
Briggs said workers found more asbestos than expected, much of it in hard to 
reach places. "You don't know what you've got until you get up there," he said. 
Once the problems were found, Briggs said, his company and the college agreed 
to waive the September deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a Murphy's Law situation: If there were things that could go wrong, 
they did," Phelps said. 
</P>
<P>
As workers put finishing touches on the library, students are using city 
libraries and libraries at Pierce and Mission colleges and Cal State 
Northridge. Many complained Thursday that not having a library on campus is a 
major inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
"Something needs to be done because this is ridiculous," said Erica Hauck, a 
commissioner on the executive council of the school's Associated Student Union.

OFF-DUTY OFFICERS LINKED TO ILLEGAL BINGO ACTIVITIES; 
</P>
<P>
INQUIRY: POLICE ORDER AN INVESTIGATION OF WITNESSES' ALLEGATIONS THAT LAWMEN 
AND THEIR WIVES RECEIVED FAVORS AND PAY FROM THE WOODLAND HILLS OPERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A spokesman said Thursday that the Los Angeles Police Department will initiate 
an internal inquiry into accusations that off-duty officers and their wives 
were aware of alleged illegal activities at the city's biggest bingo parlor and 
enjoyed financial favors there. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses testifying at a hearing Thursday afternoon that could lead to the 
revocation of the bingo license of Identity Inc. in Woodland Hills told a 
reporter outside the hearing room that the wives of two officers were on the 
payroll of the bingo operator. They said the spouses of other officers got to 
play for free at the games. All the involved officers were working off-duty as 
security guards at the bingo parlor. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman William Booth said in an interview with The Times, "There's an 
appearance of possible impropriety here that warrants an inquiry by the 
department." He said he would "initiate an appropriate preliminary inquiry" 
today. 
</P>
<P>
But the police officers are expected to testify later that they saw nothing 
improper. An attorney for the bingo parlor said the accusers are lying and 
stole money. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations were made in interviews with The Times by three witnesses who 
testified Thursday on behalf of the city's Department of Social Services, which 
is seeking to revoke the bingo license of the nonprofit corporation. 
</P>
<P>
The charity raises funds from its bingo games -- conducted three times a week 
-- to help disabled people. City records show Identity's bingo proceeds since 
1982, when the organization first employed the game of chance for fund raising, 
have amounted to $28.7 million. That is 19.7% of the total bingo proceeds 
earned by all other charities in the city over the same period. 
</P>
<P>
The city's complaint against Identity states that the nonprofit corporation 
violated state law by paying its workers from its bingo proceeds. As part of an 
effort to keep bingo charitable, state law bars bingo operators from paying 
their workers. 
</P>
<P>
One former Identity worker, Sylvia Dean, who also sat on the group's board of 
directors, testified that she was paid $900 a week in cash by Edith Ryan, 
Identity's founder and president. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan has denied that she paid her workers and says that she is the victim of a 
plot by disgruntled former workers. Her attorneys, during cross-examination 
Thursday, accused Ryan's accusers of lying and stealing money from her -- not 
getting paid by her. 
</P>
<P>
The city's case against Identity does not implicate the officers or their wives 
in any wrongdoing -- rather the witnesses have done so on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was aware of allegations that police officers may have known about 
improprieties, Robert Burns, Social Services Department general manager, said, 
"No comment." 
</P>
<P>
The charity, which was the target of an unsuccessful license revocation 
proceeding in 1984, plans to call as defense witnesses several officers who 
worked off-duty as security guards, according to Ryan's attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
The license revocation hearing will be a "big credibility contest" between Ryan 
and her police officer allies and Ryan's accusers, said J. Patrick Francis, 
Ryan's other attorney. 
</P>
<P>
But the license question may eventually take a back seat to the kinds of 
allegations made Thursday by the city's three main witnesses -- all former 
Identity workers. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Houseman, one of the three, told The Times that she and her co-workers 
talked about getting paid within hearing range of the officers. "We talked 
about it in front of them," Houseman said. 
</P>
<P>
"They couldn't help but know," Dean told The Times. "They knew that 'Go get 
your paperwork' was the code word for picking up our pay." 
</P>
<P>
Dean also testified under oath that there was "constant" talk about the illegal 
payments among the workers, including Sharon Brosnon, the wife of Officer Bob 
Brosnon. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Brosnon worked at Identity's bingo games as did Mindy Brazner, wife of 
Officer Steve Brazner. City records show Mindy Brazner and Sharon Brosnon 
worked at Identity as "volunteers" while their husbands were working as 
security guards for the charity. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the hearing, Houseman and Deborah Basham said they had seen both 
Brazner and Brosnon being paid. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen current and retired Los Angeles officers were named by the city's 
witnesses as having worked for Identity. It is legal for a bingo operator to 
contract to pay for security from bingo proceeds. And there is no law or Police 
Department rule that forbids off-duty officers from working as security guards 
at bingo games. 
</P>
<P>
However, police spokesman Booth said his concern was whether Police Department 
personnel knew of possible illegal payments. 
</P>
<P>
Dean also told The Times that she was instructed by Ryan not to charge 
admission to the wives of other officers who were also working on Identity's 
security detail. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Basham, another city witness, said "all the security wives played for 
free, and all the volunteers wives or husbands played for free too."

PANEL OKS INDUSTRIAL PARK PLANS NEAR CASTAIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County planning commissioners gave tentative approval Thursday to 
plans by Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co. to build a 12-million-square-foot 
industrial park near Castaic, setting aside protests by homeowners who live 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors of the proposed Valencia Commerce Center complained that the park 
would generate intolerable traffic and noise, and urged the company and 
Regional Planning Commission to redesign the project. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, which approved the project on a 3-2 vote, instructed Newhall 
Land officials to work with county planners on new designs that would make the 
project more compatible with an adjacent residential neighborhood known as Live 
Oak. The park would be built on 1,436 vacant acres west of the Golden State 
Freeway and north of California 126. 
</P>
<P>
But members of the Live Oak Community Assn. said they doubted that Newhall Land 
would address all their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the points we want pushed will be pushed hard enough," 
association member Mary Aurit said. 
</P>
<P>
The project must still be approved by the Board of Supervisors, and Aurit said 
the homeowners plan to continue their fight before the board. 
</P>
<P>
Aurit also complained that Newhall Land has been unwilling to work with 
residents on new designs, a charge that company officials denied. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been working with the homeowners for several months," said Marlee 
Lauffer, Newhall Land spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The Valencia Commerce Center would include manufacturing and office space, and 
Newhall Land officials predict that it will create at least 20,000 jobs. Among 
the major tenants will be the U. S. Postal Service, which plans to build a 
$26.8-million processing center to handle mail in northern Los Angeles County.

RESIDENTS FEAR EYESORE, WANT TERMINAL TO RESEMBLE EARLY 1900S STATION

A group of Chatsworth residents told local officials Thursday night that they 
want a planned commuter terminal to be a replica of the original, 
turn-of-the-century Chatsworth Park train station that was torn down nearly 30 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing that the bus and train transportation center being proposed could 
become a graffiti-covered, stucco eyesore that would attract undesirables, 
members of Citizens for Chatsworth unveiled their own plan for a wood-paneled 
depot flanked by a shopping mall with western facades and a wooden boardwalk.

"We want something that will revitalize the community and revitalize the 
heritage of Chatsworth," said Susan Amerikaner, one of the group's leaders. "We 
have a lot of exciting history in Chatsworth." 
</P>
<P>
Group members meeting with transit officials at Lawrence Junior High School 
said the transit and retail center would commemorate the area's history as a 
small ranching community of the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
It also would celebrate its popularity as a filming location for Western movies 
in more recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"We had both the real West and the Hollywood West here," Amerikaner said. "It's 
amazing to me that there is nothing here to recognize that." 
</P>
<P>
City and transportation officials have proposed building a transit center that 
would be located in the heart of the Chatsworth commercial district on a 
13-acre site that the county transportation agency has agreed to buy as part of 
a $450- million property purchase from Southern Pacific Railroad. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Pacific had planned to construct a lumber transfer station on the 
long-vacant property, but its city building permits were revoked in September 
after residents protested that the center would pose a traffic and safety 
hazard. 
</P>
<P>
Community leaders were initially thrilled when they learned of the planned 
property sale, which is scheduled to be closed in six months. 
</P>
<P>
But, they said, they now want to be sure that the transit center does not turn 
into something worse than the lumberyard. 
</P>
<P>
The original depot, built in the 1890s, was torn down in 1962 because of lack 
of use. 
</P>
<P>
About 70 Chatsworth residents attended the meeting, and when asked if they 
supported plans to build a replica of the old depot almost all of them raised 
their hands. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth organizers believe that creating an attractive multiuse center that 
would draw visitors day and night would discourage transients from 
congregating. 
</P>
<P>
Nikolas Patsaouras, president of the Rapid Transit District's board of 
directors, told the citizens that county planners are willing to develop a plan 
that they will be happy with. 
</P>
<P>
He said "we will consider" the proposal to design the new station as a replica 
of the original, built in the 1890s.

MAN SLAIN AFTER CAR THEFT WENT AWRY, JURY TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A North Hollywood man who was selling his sports car was shot and killed last 
year when he tried to prevent two other men from stealing the car after a test 
drive, a prosecutor told a jury Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Derek Parrish, 22, of West Los Angeles shot Richard Ronald Davis, 19, last 
Sept. 17 after his plan to steal the car without using violence failed, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Darlene Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
The trial of Parrish's alleged accomplice, Ronald Lewis Fort, 21, of Culver 
City, began Thursday in San Fernando Superior Court. The two men are being 
tried in the same courtroom before separate juries. Opening statements in 
Parrish's case are expected today. 
</P>
<P>
Both men have pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish was arrested on Oct. 5, 1989, after police stopped the stolen Datsun 
240-Z sports car for a traffic violation in West Los Angeles, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Fort was taken into custody the next day. He told police that he and Parrish 
called Davis after seeing an ad for the car in the newspaper. Fort, who took a 
test drive with Davis, said he planned to divert Davis by asking him to go into 
his house after the ride to get a glass of water. Fort planned to steal the 
car, according to Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis returned too quickly with the glass of water, Douglas said, and the 
men tried a second plan. They told Davis that they would discuss buying the car 
while he waited inside the house, Fort told police. 
</P>
<P>
Fort's lawyer, David Mann, told jurors that Parrish asked Fort to shoot Davis. 
"I'm not touching that gun," Fort replied, according to the attorney.

MOTORCYCLIST SHOOTS WOMAN IN PARKING LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 42-year-old Encino woman was critically wounded by a motorcyclist who 
followed her into a North Hollywood parking lot and shot her Thursday morning, 
Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Green was listed in critical condition at an undisclosed hospital, 
Detective Mike Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman drove her Corvette into a parking lot behind her husband's tax 
consulting business in the 12000 block of Oxnard Street about 10:20 a.m. A 
motorcyclist who had been following her for an unknown period of time shot her 
once in the torso before she could get out the car, Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the gunman was riding a Suzuki racer motorcycle and wearing a 
helmet, Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
Police had not established a motive and there were no suspects.

WEST VALLEY GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks to reporter Leslie Berger for her article bringing attention to the 
terrible traffic in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
An inaccuracy should be clarified. The population of the Encino Hills has not 
grown since the last traffic report was done in 1978, but there has been 
tremendous growth of population in the West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
We need more cross-mountain traffic routes. It is imperative that the Reseda 
Boulevard extension be completed and that Mulholland Drive be paved between 
Reseda Boulevard and Encino Hills Drive to the east. We need to move the heavy 
flow of cars, and ensure the health and safety of the Encino Hills 
neighborhood.

AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traveling through east Sepulveda/Panorama City the other day, I noticed a large 
amount of construction going on. I was pleased to see some revitalization 
taking place. 
</P>
<P>
However, I was also disappointed to learn that seemingly none of it was set 
aside for lower-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
I feel there is a tremendous need for affordable housing in the San Fernando 
Valley, particularly in the northeast. The area between Sepulveda and Van Nuys 
boulevards has plenty of open space to provide some decent, inexpensive 
housing. I hope Councilmen Joel Wachs and Ernani Bernardi or city housing 
officials have looked or will look into this possibility. It would be a shame 
if this "New Sepulveda" was completed five years from now without taking into 
consideration all of its citizens.

ASSEMBLY CANDIDATE BOLAND ASSAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I continue to be amazed! When will these politicians learn that we the people 
put them in office or remove them from office? 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 10, I was one of the 20 or so people who demonstrated against Paula 
Boland, the Republican candidate for the 38th Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
Boland and her anti-choice position are the reasons that I -- a registered 
Republican since 1958 -- have re-registered as a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
To quote Boland: Her position on abortion is "a dumb story. I've given all the 
time I'm going to give those airheads down there. This is my governor's 
luncheon." 
</P>
<P>
The last time I heard such offensive, stupid language regarding Americans 
making a political statement was from the infamous Spiro Agnew, who said of the 
Kent State protesters: "They are nothing but a bunch of effete intellectuals. 
They are all Johnny One Notes, single-issue people that do not represent the 
silent majority in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew underestimated the depth and the seriousness of 
that "single issue." Obviously, Boland is not bright enough to see the 
correlation. Perhaps she should talk to the people whose privacy and rights she 
would deny; perhaps she should feel the depth of their commitment; perhaps she 
should have been out with our group in our nonpartisan effort to register 
voters. We registered 670 voters, of which more than half were Republican women 
switching parties. Not only does this airhead vote, I also organize. I, for 
one, will work as hard and as actively as I can against Boland and the 
Republican Party.

MOSQUE EDITORIAL AN EYE-OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial on "The mosque no one wanted" should open the eyes and minds of 
the City Council members who misused their authority to interfere in the 
constitutional rights of religious freedom. If the design of a religious 
building is subject to the council's whims and fancies, then very soon 
Christian churches would be required not to install a cross on the building in 
order to blend with the surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
Your thought-provoking editorial and Mayor Tom Bradley's justified action to 
reconsider the City Council policy in regard to the design of religious 
buildings are landmark expressions of faith in the religious freedom granted by 
our Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
I congratulate The Times for this timely editorial, and we Muslims are very 
proud to have a newspaper in the area that stood with us in exposing the 
infringement of the constitutional freedom of religion by the City Council 
members.

COPING WITH THE PROSPECT OF HIGHER TAXES; 
</P>
<P>
TAX-FREE BONDS ALLURING, BUT WHOLESALE INVESTMENT SWITCHES SEEN AS UNLIKELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ink on America's new budget proposal is not yet dry, but well-heeled 
investors are already pouring money into tax-free municipal bonds to avoid the 
higher tax rates that the budget plan portends. 
</P>
<P>
Net sales of tax-free municipal bond funds have jumped by about $220 million 
during the first eight months of 1990, according to the Investment Company 
Institute. And the change has been even more dramatic in the past month since 
budget talks began, investment experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Fidelity Investments, one of the nation's biggest mutual fund companies, has 
seen a 60% increase in investments into its California tax-free bond funds 
between September and October, said spokeswoman Patricia Harden. Investments in 
other tax-free mutual funds sponsored by Fidelity have also soared, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a market shift toward municipal bonds," added Michael P. 
Buckley, vice president and municipal credit analyst at T. Rowe Price in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
The shift to tax-free investments started months ago because it became clear to 
investors that the rich would get hit with higher rates, investment experts 
said. The budget deal proposes about a 3% tax hike on the wealthy, from 28% to 
31%. However, it sets a separate maximum tax on capital gains of 28%. 
</P>
<P>
The new capital gains rate would provide a break to wealthy individuals who are 
active in the stock market and could spur additional market activity next year 
when it goes into effect, investment experts said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is clearly going to direct more people into equities than before," Greif 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the same provision is likely to cause a decrease in market activity 
this year, particularly among upper-middle-income taxpayers who are in the 
so-called bubble bracket. These individuals currently pay 33% in federal tax. 
They are likely to put off triggering any capital gains to avoid paying tax at 
their 33% ordinary income rate this year. The current tax proposal also expects 
to burst the bubble bracket, presumably next year, by making the top federal 
rate about 32%. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the tax increases and breaks proposed in the current budget plan 
are not significant enough to spur wholesale changes in investment patterns, 
said Gregg Ritchie, partner at the accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, when tax laws changed to eliminate the 20% capital gains rate, 
investors rushed to sell anything that would trigger such a gain, causing a 
flurry of activity at year-end. However, since most taxpayers would see only an 
increase of about 3% in their federal tax rate, and less than a 5% break on 
capital gains, they are not likely to act with as much vigor, Ritchie noted. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not going to be some wholesale flight" of capital, he added. "The 
difference is not that significant." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, although there has been a big increase in the tax-free market, 
investors continue to be cautious about what they are buying, Buckley said. 
Although the changes could effectively hike the after-tax yield for many 
investments, the difference is not big enough to overlook investment risk. 
</P>
<P>
"I think investors will be looking at municipals, but they will make sure they 
are buying high-quality bonds," he said. "I think you will see investors being 
much more conservative in jumping into deals where the (bond issuers) have 
known financial problems."

CONSUMER AFFAIRS: DEBACLE PROS WTD. S&amp;L EXPER. A MUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By S.J. DIAMOND

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Companies promoting security systems have for some time been hiring as experts 
the very people who made careers of breaking through them. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-burglars advised 7-Eleven stores on anti-robbery measures; one even became a 
company spokesman and a Johnny Carson regular. A New York ex-thief promoted his 
door alarm system as the invention of a "crime expert." A Los Angeles security 
firm offers consumers tips from its in-house "ex-con." 
</P>
<P>
Thus consumers benefit from a life misspent, and a former crook uses his 
expertise to finance a life gone straight. In a way, he returns some of what he 
took from consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The gambit suggests wide application. Why draw on outside analysts when one can 
get an actual operator fresh from the action? 
</P>
<P>
Take our savings and loan system, which has somehow been robbed blind. Right 
now, there are only suspects, not certified criminals, but it's clear that 
there has been some pillage. The names scroll by, followed by big figures -- 
how much it cost or could cost the government, and taxpayers, to settle things. 
Vernon Savings &amp; Loan, Silverado, CenTrust Bank, Lincoln Savings. A billion 
dollars here, two billion there. 
</P>
<P>
It's clear also that there's no other money available. Federal officials are 
starting to ask -- for $41 million from former Lincoln chief Charles H. Keating 
Jr., $23 million from Columbia S&amp;L's Thomas Spiegel and $31 million from 
CenTrust's David L. Paul -- and are suing Neil Bush and 10 Silverado colleagues 
for $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
But nobody has any money. They had money, but they don't have it now. Spiegel, 
who took $1 million-plus in salary and other compensation in 1989 while his 
institution lost almost $600 million, earns a token $1 a year. Keating had an 
estimated $100-million fortune; now his son-in-law says he's "not worth 40 
cents." Even Neil Bush's business associate Bill Walters, who defaulted on $100 
million in Silverado loans, says his former estimated net worth of $100 million 
is now "a negative net worth." 
</P>
<P>
One thing's for sure. Wherever the money went and whether these men are 
ultimately judged guilty of fraud and theft or exonerated as poor misguided 
naifs, guilty only of bad management, the government won't get much from them. 
</P>
<P>
But there may be a way. Like the ex-burglars, the ex-S&amp;L players have 
knowledge to share. They can consult. It's not classy, but it's a job. 
</P>
<P>
With their intimate knowledge of how an S&amp;L looks when it is near failure 
-- its last-throes marketing, its loan portfolio -- they could serve both 
government and industry by fingering the next possible collapse. Given the 
number of their loans that went sour, they should instantly recognize other 
loans likely to default and guess the time it will take. 
</P>
<P>
They can even serve consumers, who as customers, small investors and taxpayers 
are most hurt by these S&amp;L debacles. Ordinary folk might like to know where 
these people kept their own savings. Well aware of the deposit money draining 
away, they'd scarcely have chosen their own institution. Given their skill in 
hiding such leakage, they could cast a discerning eye on other institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Inclined themselves to spend rather than save (or even lend), they could also 
teach the art of corporate purchase. Usually described as "high-fliers," they 
did it with corporate planes, world travel, big cars, bigger parties. 
</P>
<P>
Not that they eschewed collectibles. Several bought art. One bought a library 
of magic. Some bought gold and in forms that suggest innovative investment 
theories: CenTrust Chairman David Paul bought gold leaf, which he kept on his 
ceilings and walls, and gold plate, which he kept in the bathrooms, covering 
both fixtures and "waste pipes." Spiegel had a gun collection, big on automatic 
assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
There is much to learn here, but these men are now revealing a more novel 
expertise -- the ability to live on nothing, a kind of alchemy that will 
doubtless become familiar as the S&amp;L investigations progress. Keating still 
has property and a good life, though penniless; his children put up their homes 
as collateral for his bail. Walters, equally penniless, still enjoys three 
homes (town, beach and desert), at least two Mercedes and (a favorite news 
note) an $800-a-month gardener. 
</P>
<P>
Their wives and families seem to be key: They are unusually wealthy and 
absolutely independent, even unsharing. Walters's wife owns all those assets, 
alone. Even Neil Bush, a beginner at spinning gold from straw, has a wife with 
a $550,000 house in her own name. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, their penniless is not our penniless. If everyone can learn how to 
do this, no one will be hurt. Even the homeless problem will be solved. 
</P>
<P>
If ex-burglars can share their expertise as consultants, so can S&amp;L 
insiders. They may profit, as usual, by doing so. But, at least, so would we.

COPING WITH THE PROSPECT OF HIGHER TAXES; 
</P>
<P>
LEVIES ON GASOLINE, BOOZE, LUXURY GOODS GET MIXED RECEPTION FROM BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Federal budget proposals to impose new taxes on gasoline, liquor and such 
luxury items as furs, jewelry and yachts have so far received a mixed reaction 
from businesses that would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
While some business people vigorously opposed the measures, others thought a 
healthy economy -- if the new budget could bring it -- would be more important 
to their businesses, particularly in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
The tax proposals "may not help you, and they may not hurt you," said Michel 
Glouchevitch, a general partner in Los Angeles-based Riordan Venture 
Management. "They may just create a more stable (economic) environment. . . . 
We have neglected the budget for so many years now that we're going to have to 
hurt for a while, in the short run." 
</P>
<P>
The proposals, still being negotiated, include a variety of so-called "sin 
taxes." These include raising the current 16-cent tax on cigarettes to 20 cents 
next year, and to 24 cents in 1993. The 16-cent tax on a six-pack of beer would 
double, and levies on wine and spirits would also go up. 
</P>
<P>
At Trader Joe's Co., the South Pasadena-based retailer with 37 California 
outlets, CEO John Shields called the proposed tax on liquor "regressive." 
</P>
<P>
More than 90% of the wines he sells are priced under $5, Shields said. But the 
tax would be a uniform tax per unit. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were a wine seller on the West Side, selling $25-a-bottle wines, the tax 
wouldn't have as much impact," Shields said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed gas tax hike -- at least 5 cents a gallon -- would come on top of 
already high oil prices from the Persian Gulf crisis, a particularly onerous 
prospect to some owners of large delivery fleets. 
</P>
<P>
United Parcel Service Chairman Kent C. Nelson has vigorously lobbied 
congressional leaders to avoid adding new taxes at a time "when the whole 
industry is struggling to cope with the steep escalation in fuel prices." 
</P>
<P>
A 5-cent increase in the gas tax would cost United Parcel an additional $12 
million for fuel over the next year, according to a company spokesman. The 
package delivery company already is paying $900,000 a day more for fuel because 
of the Kuwait invasion. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Federal Express Corp. is less concerned. Spokesman Armand 
Schneider said they expected they would be forced to pay $250,000 more for the 
5 million gallons of fuel the firm consumes every month. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a $7-billion company," Schneider said. "Our financial people think that 
for a company our size, we don't consider that a very heavy hit." 
</P>
<P>
Among luxury merchants, reaction was similarly mixed. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, nobody wants taxes," said Edd Jacobs of Somper Furs Inc. in Beverly 
Hills. "But I think everyone knows we have problems, and they're going to cost 
us whatever they cost. If a $10,000 coat is going to be another $500 -- I think 
people will live with that. As long as everybody is doing the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Taxes are also proposed on yachts costing $100,000 or more, which in the 
already depressed economy have not been selling well as it is. 
</P>
<P>
"Our sales are down, and I don't think (new taxes) are going to help any," said 
Finlay G. Scott, owner of Bayside Marine Sales in Newport Beach. "When they put 
a sales tax on used boats, it had a negative effect," he said. "People resented 
it. But they get used to it, and they pay it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Finlay noted that advertisements have already begun to appear in 
yachting publications, urging people to buy now and save the expected 10% tax. 
</P>
<P>
Many jewelers are concerned that customers will wait for the opportunity to buy 
jewelry overseas, avoiding any new tax imposed here -- something not so easily 
done with a yacht. And other luxury goods manufacturers also warned that the 
people most directly hurt may be the workers who make such products. 
</P>
<P>
"People forget that poor people make those luxury items," said Michael Pappas, 
owner of Los Angeles-based Michael's Furs, a manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
"This industry has already been hit by the recession: furs, jewelry, cars, 
boats, vacations -- anything a person could cut back on. This is bad news. This 
is going to make things even worse."

Upland Man Indicted: Real estate developer William E. Crowder was indicted by a 
federal grand jury in Los Angeles on 33 counts of submitting false tax returns 
and financial statements to two New York banks -- Dollar Dry Dock Bank and Bank 
of New York -- and the former Home Federal Savings in Phoenix. Crowder 
allegedly tried to obtain $200 million in commercial real estate loans from the 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
Also indicted for assisting in the alleged scheme was John Gary Willett of 
Fullerton. Crowder faces up to 87 years in prison and a fine of up to $7.75 
million. Willett faces up to eight years in prison and up to $1 million in 
fines. Crowder's lawyer could not be reached for comment.

UNISYS POSTS $357-MILLION LOSS IN PERIOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Raising fears that its very survival may be at stake, Unisys Corp. on Thursday 
reported a $357-million third-quarter loss and said it expects more red ink in 
the closing months of the year, even as it aggressively trims its work force 
and sheds operations. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's third-largest computer maker -- which has lost nearly $1 billion 
in the last 21 months following an overly ambitious expansion effort and poor 
electronics sales -- also announced that it would reduce its work force of 
75,000 by 5,000 in the coming months. That's the third such cut in the last two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Unisys said, W. Michael Blumenthal has stepped down as chairman 
nine months after giving up the chief executive post. Blumenthal, a former 
Treasury secretary, guided Unisys' creation four years ago from the merger of 
Burroughs and Sperry and then designed its bold but ill-fated expansion drive. 
</P>
<P>
Unisys said Blumenthal, 64, stepped down to devote full time to his 
international investment banking career at Lazard Freres, one of the companies 
Unisys said it recently retained to step up its efforts to sell operating 
units. The sales are designed to generate cash needed to pay down its 
staggering $3.9-billion debt. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of news sent the company's stock, which had traded as high as 
$30.50 a share about 20 months ago, down again on the New York Stock Exchange. 
It closed at $3.375 per share, down 12.5 cents for the day. The news also 
prompted Standard &amp; Poor's to lower by one notch its rating of $4 billion 
in Unisys debt. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street analysts, skeptical about the company's prospects for months, said 
the latest reports underscore Unisys' precarious position, particularly as the 
economy continues to slide and the company remains burdened by a debt load more 
than double the industry average. 
</P>
<P>
The major remaining question, analysts said, is whether James A. Unruh -- who 
took over as chief executive from Blumenthal early this year and now replaces 
him as chairman -- can move quickly enough with the asset sales to prevent 
further damage. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is whether they can get enough breathing space," said Stephen Cohen, 
a technology analyst with Soundview Financial in Stamford, Conn. "This business 
can shrink itself and find a vital core, but it has to move quickly." 
</P>
<P>
With other troubled electronics companies, such as Wang Laboratories and 
Control Data, aggressively trying to shed unwanted operations, Unisys may not 
be able to find buyers for its assets, analysts said. Although Unisys has not 
said what units are for sale, analysts said operations on the sales block might 
include Unisys' defense unit, which two years ago was among the aerospace 
companies caught in the federal government's defense fraud probe, Ill Wind. 
Also said to be up for sale are Unisys' one-third stake in Japanese computer 
marketer Nihon Unisys Ltd. and its Timeplex Inc. data transmission unit. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the slump, Unisys said Timeplex, its defense unit and sales in Asia and 
the Pacific were doing well. It also said cash flow had increased significantly 
over last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We remain confident of our course toward restoring the company to 
profitability and reducing its debt load," chief Unruh said. 
</P>
<P>
The company's latest loss compared to a loss of $648 million in the year-ago 
third quarter. Sales in the quarter were $2.4 billion, up 2% from the $2.35 
billion posted a year ago.

PROSECUTORS FINISH MILKEN PRE-SENTENCING CASE; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITIES: WITNESSES GIVE CLOUDY AND CONFLICTING TESTIMONY ABOUT WHETHER THE 
EX-JUNK BOND KING ENGAGED IN INSIDER TRADING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The government case against Michael Milken in pre-sentencing hearings ended on 
an uncertain note Thursday as prosecution witnesses gave ambiguous and 
sometimes contradictory testimony on the most egregious conduct Milken is 
accused of: insider trading for his own benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, a former Drexel Burnham Lambert bond salesman testified that Drexel 
and Beverly Hills-based Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn. had an illegal 
arrangement to secretly hold securities for each other, a practice known as 
"parking." The salesman, James Dahl, said Milken and former Columbia Savings 
Chief Executive Thomas Spiegel were directly involved in the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers said they were to decide by late Thursday night whether to call 
their own witnesses, possibly including Milken himself. If they don't, the 
hearings, which began Oct. 11, are over. U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood 
hasn't said when she will sentence Milken, who faces up to 28 years in prison. 
The purpose of the hearings was to establish if the former junk bond wizard 
committed more crimes than the six to which he pleaded guilty in April. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged insider trading, which took up most of Thursday's testimony, had to 
do with purchases in 1983 of Caesars World junk bonds. Dahl testified that 
Milken, without explaining, ordered him in early July, 1983, to contact two 
customers who held large quantities of the bonds. Milken, he said, ordered him 
to persuade the customers to sell the bonds back to Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
The government contends that Milken had advance knowledge that Drexel's 
corporate finance department was about to make a bonds-for-stock exchange offer 
for Caesars that would make the bonds significantly more valuable. Prosecutors 
charge that Milken had Drexel buy large quantities of the bonds and that he had 
the junk bond department put Caesars bonds with a face amount of $3.2 million 
in his personal retirement account before the exchange offer was publicly 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, through his lawyers and spokesman, has long emphatically denied that he 
ever participated in insider trading. None of the six felony counts to which he 
pleaded guilty in April involved such illegal trading. 
</P>
<P>
Although the testimony Thursday was ambiguous, one piece of evidence submitted 
to the judge isn't disputed: Milken was present at a June 29, 1983, meeting 
between Drexel's corporate finance staff and Caesars executives in which Drexel 
proposed the exchange offer. At least some, and possibly all, of the 
department's efforts to buy the bonds for its own account or Milken's took 
place after that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Dahl said that, after persistent calls, he did ultimately persuade two 
reluctant customers, high-yield mutual funds run by Prudential-Bache and the 
Colonial group, to sell. He said he was severely embarrassed when an exchange 
offer was announced just after the trades took place. He said his customers, 
particularly Colonial, were extremely angry. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked like a jerk," Dahl said, because he had insisted that they sell just 
before an announcement that made their bonds much more valuable. Colonial 
refused to make good on its trade. 
</P>
<P>
But under cross-examination, Dahl said Milken never said anything to him about 
an exchange offer. After looking at records supplied by defense lawyer Arthur 
L. Liman, Dahl said he believed that the reason Milken wanted him to buy back 
the Caesars bonds was so that the customers would be able to buy new junk bonds 
that were just then being issued for two other companies. Dahl said persuading 
customers to "swap" old bonds for new issues was standard practice at Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
Dahl, a government witness with immunity from prosecution, cast doubt on the 
government's contention that Milken arranged to buy the bonds because he knew 
the exchange offer was coming. Dahl testified that it would have been out of 
character for Milken to get customers to sell bonds knowing that a significant 
event was about to be announced. He said this would have alienated important 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
Dahl's testimony that he attempted for two weeks to persuade Colonial to sell 
was contradicted by another government witness, Prescot Crocker, the Colonial 
executive who dealt with him. Crocker said he was contacted by Dahl about the 
Caesars bonds only once, on the day before the exchange offer was announced 
July 15, and Crocker agreed almost immediately to sell. Defense lawyers contend 
that this is significant because Milken had been out of the country on vacation 
since July 6. 
</P>
<P>
Dahl also said that on a Sunday in 1986, two days after it was publicly 
disclosed that admitted inside trader Ivan F. Boesky was cooperating with the 
government, Milken summoned Dahl to the office for a talk. It was Boesky who 
later implicated Milken in wrongdoing. Dahl said Milken called him into the 
Drexel men's room, turned on the water to thwart potential eavesdropping and 
said: "There haven't been any subpoenas issued. Whatever you have to do, do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Dahl said he never understood what Milken meant. He didn't take it to be an 
instruction to destroy documents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony on a "parking" arrangement with Columbia Savings was the first 
public evidence that such an arrangement existed. Spiegel, through his lawyers, 
has denied any illegal activity. It has long been known publicly, however, that 
Spiegel has been under investigation by federal prosecutors for his relations 
with Drexel. Columbia was one of Drexel's largest customers for junk bonds.

RTC Oversight Board OKs Major S&amp;L Sale Plan: Officials of the Resolution 
Trust Corp.'s oversight board approved a plan to sell or close about 192 failed 
savings and loan institutions over the next six months. Officials of the 
oversight board said its implementation would bring to 479 the total number of 
thrifts whose financial problems have been resolved by liquidation or other 
actions since Aug. 9, 1989. But they noted that the plan is subject to the 
congressional appropriations process and cannot be completed unless it receives 
full financing.

VIOLENT STRIKE AT N.Y. DAILY NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Eight out of the 10 unions at the New York Daily News went on strike Thursday 
night over a labor grievance that had sparked violence during a truck drivers' 
walkout earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
The action climaxed a bitter, month-long standoff between the money-losing 
tabloid and its unions, which have been without a contract for six months as 
they have resisted the News' demands for work-rule changes and wage cuts worth 
at least $50 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether the newspaper would be able to print an edition this 
morning, despite management's contingency plans for a strike. 
</P>
<P>
Picket lines went up outside the newspaper's Manhattan office and its three 
outlying printing plants. Police in riot gear patrolled the areas to prevent a 
recurrence of the violence. The scene at the Brooklyn printing plant was 
described by one observer as "very tense." 
</P>
<P>
The drivers' union was first to strike. Their action was to protest the 
replacement of drivers by about 60 non-union substitutes following the walkout 
early in the day, which had begun when a driver at the Brooklyn plant refused 
to abide by a supervisor's order to work standing up. The driver contended that 
a disability entitled him to perform the work sitting down. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the newspaper's 10 unions followed the drivers' lead, said George 
McDonald, head of the Allied Printing Trades Council, the umbrella group for 
the unions. A ninth union, the Newspaper Guild, said it would honor the picket 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
The 10th union, the typographical union, had said it would not strike because 
it has lifetime-guaranteed jobs for its 200 members. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 workers are on strike. The Newspaper Guild, whose members planned 
to meet today, has about 800 members. 
</P>
<P>
When the drivers first walked out of the Brooklyn plant about 2:30 a.m. 
Thursday, management declared the walkout a strike and announced that the paper 
would begin hiring the specially trained replacement drivers. 
</P>
<P>
According to the company, roughly 200 drivers then attacked vehicles at the 
plant, burning two delivery trucks and damaging about 40 others by puncturing 
tires and poking holes in radiators. Police said two workers were cited. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Allied Printing Trades Council met with management 
Thursday afternoon at the Daily News headquarters. But management turned down 
the unions' request that the company put all 200 workers on the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
A Daily News spokeswoman said it was "unfortunate" that the violence came while 
the intermittent contract talks continued. 
</P>
<P>
Early Thursday evening, union officials said they planned to have the drivers 
show up at the plant for their regular shifts. However, when the shift began at 
9 p.m., the drivers appeared at the Brooklyn facility but did not enter it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at the bridge," said Michael Alvino, the drivers' union president. 
"We're officially on strike for unfair labor practices." 
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the walkout earlier in the day had been forced when the 
printing plant supervisor "pushed the drivers out by firing . . . somebody who 
was crippled on the job." 
</P>
<P>
The Daily News has been training members of management and others for two years 
in how to operate the plant in the event of a strike, and officials of the 
company had vowed that they would have no trouble continuing production in the 
event of a full or partial strike. 
</P>
<P>
The unions' strategy had been to try to avoid a strike that would force the 
issue. And some members of management -- and the unions -- said Thursday that 
the drivers union may have blundered into a test of strength. 
</P>
<P>
"The union screwed up," said a Daily News manager, who asked to remain 
unidentified. "They did what the company wanted them to do." 
</P>
<P>
The News is the nation's second-largest metropolitan daily newspaper, with a 
circulation of 1.18 million. Last year it nearly broke even, but over the past 
decade it has lost $115 million and watched circulation fall by 700,000. 
</P>
<P>
The strike at the News could provide a major boost to other New York papers, 
including the loss-soaked New York Post, and New York Newsday, the city edition 
of the big Long Island daily. Newsday is owned by Times Mirror Co., publisher 
of the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
The Post said it planned to boost Friday's press run by as much as 50% over the 
usual 600,000 copies. But Jerry Nachman, the Post's editor, insisted that the 
added production was not entirely because of the News' potential problem; the 
Post had planned to increase its run by 30% because of Thursday night's 
heavyweight championship bout, Nachman said.

MARKET BEAT: STOCK BUYBACKS MAY BE A PLACEBO, NOT A REAL CURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You're the chief executive of a mid-size company. Your stock has plunged to $2 
from $12 this year, even though you believe that your business is going well. 
What do you do? 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, many small and medium-size Southland firms have decided that 
if no one else wants their stock, they'll buy it themselves. Such buybacks have 
multiplied as more area stocks have fallen to embarrassing "penny" levels of $5 
or less. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate stock buybacks aren't new, of course. But the practice is more 
controversial now, because some executives question the wisdom of draining 
company cash to retire stock on the eve of what could be a deep recession. 
Also, experts caution that if management's goal is to stop its stock from 
sliding, a buyback program may prove futile in a severe bear market. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, many of the recent buyback announcements are aggressive. Beverly 
Hills-based Salick Health Care, which runs cancer treatment centers, said on 
Oct. 15 that it would spend as much as $5 million to buy back stock or its 
7.25% convertible bonds or some combination of the two. If the money were spent 
solely on the stock, Salick would retire 19% of its shares. 
</P>
<P>
The key phrase in most buyback announcements is "up to" -- as in, up to 500,000 
shares. That doesn't mean that the firm will buy the entire sum. In fact, some 
companies that announce plans to buy never do. That was frequently the case 
after the October, 1987, market crash: Many buybacks planned then never 
happened, because stocks stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, as smaller stocks in particular are deserted by investors, more 
of those companies say simple financial analysis suggests a buyback. "For us, 
the best use of cash is to put it back into the company," argues Michael Fiore, 
senior vice president at Salick. 
</P>
<P>
Companies reason this way: 
</P>
<P>
* If a firm expects to grow at an annual rate of 15% or better, management can 
argue that buying its own equity is a smarter use for cash than leaving it to 
earn 7.5% in a money-market fund. 
</P>
<P>
* Likewise, when a stock's price is below the company's book value per share -- 
the net value of its assets -- a buyback allows the company to reinvest in 
itself at an extraordinarily cheap price. 
</P>
<P>
Those examples simplify the thought process, but the bottom line is that 
retiring stock can easily be justified mathematically by many firms. 
</P>
<P>
From the shareholders' point of view, the benefits are easy to see as well. As 
stock is retired by the company, the remaining shareholders own more of the 
business, and future earnings are spread over fewer shares. Your slice of the 
pie grows. Also, there is at least the expectation that the company's purchases 
in the open market will help support the stock price. 
</P>
<P>
But experts warn shareholders against counting on company buybacks to put a 
floor under stock prices, beyond some temporary psychological support 
immediately after a buyback announcement. Lloyd Greif, corporate finance chief 
at brokerage Sutro &amp; Co. in Los Angeles, notes that federal rules allow 
companies to buy their shares only after "upticks" -- a rise in the price from 
the previous trade. So, in a free fall, a buyback plan can't even be 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Whitten, chief financial officer at El Monte-based electronics 
distributor Marshall Industries, says his firm isn't considering a 
500,000-share buyback to keep the stock price up but rather because "it's a 
question of what we feel would be a good use of the company's resources." As 
for the stock, he says, "I think the market is going to do what it's going to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
What about concerns that management ought to be conserving cash for the 
recession ahead? The companies that are most aggressive with their buybacks 
contend that they will leave plenty of funds for operations. "We'll have enough 
cash to continue to grow the business," Salick's Fiore says. "We feel we can do 
both." 
</P>
<P>
The companies in the best shape to buy back stock are those with no debt and no 
pressing need for their cash. Canoga Park-based New Image Industries, for 
example, is debt-free, and its cash hoard alone is worth almost $3 a share. The 
stock trades for $2.875 a share. So the market is barely valuing the 
computer-imaging systems company for its underlying cash, let alone for the 
value of its property and its franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the new wave of buybacks may actually be detrimental to smaller 
companies' stocks over the long term: As shares are retired, already-volatile 
small stocks may become more volatile in their price swings because there will 
be fewer shares to trade. "Our stock is thinly traded now, and we're trying to 
(fix) that. Our buyback is contrary to that goal," one Southland executive 
admits. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, it's a sad commentary on the stock market and the economy that 
many young companies will end up spending their dollars on their own paper 
rather than on new research or expansion. Buybacks may make corporate officers 
and shareholders feel better, but they won't do much for the nation's long-term 
economic picture. 
</P>
<P>
STOCK BUYBACK MANIA 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the Southland companies that have recently announced plans to 
buy back some of their shares, as the stocks' prices have plunged:

SMALL BUSINESS: SPRUCING UP THE NEIGHBORHOOD CAN PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Small business owners have a hard enough time getting customers in the door. 
But the merchants of West Washington Boulevard in Venice had an even tougher 
time because there are several other Washington streets or boulevards around 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd given directions to enough people through the years to be very 
frustrated," said Carol Tantau Smith, who has been selling jewelry and gift 
items on the boulevard for about eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Tantau Smith helped spearhead a successful drive to rename the 
street Abbot Kinney Boulevard, in honor of the wealthy landowner who founded 
Venice and built canals resembling their Italian counterparts in the early 
1900s. 
</P>
<P>
The name change was the catalyst for an overall effort by business people to 
spruce up the district in hopes of boosting business. 
</P>
<P>
Changing the character of your neighborhood isn't easy, but business owners 
nationwide are teaming up to rub out graffiti, clear trash from vacant lots and 
brighten their surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
Every dollar invested in fixing up your business district can generate up to 
$17 in additional income, according to Matt Hussman, a program associate for 
the National Trust for Historic Preservation in Washington. Over the past 10 
years, the Trust's Main Street Center has helped 661 communities from Boston to 
Hollister, Calif., revitalize their commercial streets. 
</P>
<P>
"The projects across the country have generated thousands of dollars and 
created thousands of jobs," said Hussman. 
</P>
<P>
Involving local residents who shop in your store is critical to insuring the 
success of any revitalization plan, according to Mark Futterman, director of 
urban design and planning for Urban Innovations Group in Westwood. He also 
recommended contacting local city planners and politicians to gain support. 
</P>
<P>
Futterman, who chairs the urban design committee for the Los Angeles chapter of 
the American Institute of Architects, said AIA chapters around the country can 
serve as resources for business owners seeking help. 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment experts say what is happening along Abbot Kinney Boulevard is 
typical of revitalization projects elsewhere. Once the physical area is 
improved, rents go up and the caliber of businesses generally improves. 
</P>
<P>
Although the street is still tricky to find, the general feeling along Abbot 
Kinney Boulevard is that business is perking up. 
</P>
<P>
"It just feels different," said Tantau Smith. "There is a real energy." 
</P>
<P>
Within five short blocks, visitors can find a plumber, travel agency, grocery 
store, liquor store, barber and beauty shops, a kick-boxing school, several 
antique stores, a contemporary lighting gallery, a vintage clothing store, a 
myriad of art galleries and a millinery shop. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of palm trees are due to be planted along the parkways to soften the 
harsh lines of many of the older brick and concrete buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"The quality of merchants is a clear cut above what we've had here before," 
said Richard Rosenthal, principal broker and real estate consultant for Richard 
Rosenthal and Associates. "The energy along the boulevard is created by the 
rehabilitation and new construction." 
</P>
<P>
Sunya Currie, a jewelry designer and antique dealer, bought the old Elk's Club 
building at 1130 West Washington Blvd. in 1968. In the 1970s, she ran her 
antique business in the airy space. In 1981, when the boulevard's energy 
reached a low ebb, she moved to Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Currie returned to Abbot Kinney Boulevard in September, determined to be part 
of the renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had a feeling this area was ready to take off," said Currie. "There is 
a feeling of the original Venice here, with artists living and working in the 
same space." 
</P>
<P>
Lori Henle, a modern-day milliner who specializes in traditional techniques, 
said she is very busy with retail customers when she opens her door on Saturday 
and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
She moved her studio to Abbot Kinney Boulevard in July and is about to move 
into an apartment behind her workshop. "Everybody on the street is really 
pulling together," said Henle, who worked as a fashion stylist before turning 
her skills to hat making. "I'm just happy to be down here." 
</P>

Chamber of Commerce Slates Outlook Session 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce's 42nd-annual Business Outlook 
Conference is set for Nov. 9 at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in downtown Los 
Angeles. All aspects of the local economy will be addressed by experts in 
various fields. The session runs from 7:30 a.m. until lunch time. Kent Kresa, 
chairman and chief executive of Northrop Corp., is the featured speaker. The 
fee is $120 for Chamber members, $140 for non-members and $25 for students. The 
luncheon alone costs $50. For information, contact the Chamber at 404 S. Bixel 
St., Los Angeles, 90051-1696. Or call (213) 629-0619.

<P>
* If you don't have one, try to form a merchants association. 
</P>
<P>
* Talk to other business owners who have spruced up their businesses to gather 
names of competent architects and planners. 
</P>
<P>
* Ask your customers how you can improve your neighborhood. Would they like 
more parking spaces? Better night lighting? 
</P>
<P>
* Ask local government officials if there is any state or federal grant money 
available for community rehabilitation and revitalization.

PEOPLE: LITTON'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE WILL STEP DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roland O. Peterson will step down as president and chief operating officer of 
Litton Industries on Nov. 1 to take an interim position as part of his plan for 
early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
The board selected Alton J. Brann, a Litton vice president and group executive, 
to succeed Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
Brann, 48, will also be a candidate for director at the annual shareholders 
meeting in December, replacing Peterson, who decided not to seek reelection. 
The management shift came as a surprise to analysts. Litton said it was made 
because Peterson, who will be 59 next January, plans to retire soon. Peterson 
wants to retire before he becomes 65, the mandatory retirement age for Litton 
executives, said Robert Knapp, a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson will be a senior vice president and group executive of Litton's 
Components and Industrial Products business until he retires. The group 
includes divisions that produce components for computers and microwaves. 
Peterson will also assume the office of chief scientist at Litton, replacing 
Charles Bridge, who retired last month. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson has a 30-year history at the Beverly Hills-based firm, which supplies 
advanced electronic equipment for the military and manufactures microwave 
components and industrial automation systems. He was first elected president in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Taking this step toward retirement has allowed the board to select my 
successor early, which will result in better management continuity," Peterson 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Brann, who heads the Components and Industrial Products group, joined Litton in 
1973. He was formerly president of Litton's Guidance &amp; Control division, 
which supplies the military, and was elected a corporate vice president in 
1984. GEORGE WHITE

Garth Ancier, president of network television production at Walt Disney Co., 
resigned suddenly after he clashed with senior management over what he called 
"autonomy issues." 
</P>
<P>
Ancier, 33, was only 18 months into a five-year contract at Disney. 
</P>
<P>
He became widely known as the first programming head at Fox Broadcasting Co. 
when it started in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Frank, president of Walt Disney Studios, said Ancier had "done a terrific 
job in building up the TV operation here." Frank explained: "We just reached an 
impasse over management style. It was best for each to go his own ways." 
</P>
<P>
Disney over the past two years has made a big push into television and has been 
one of the studios bidding up the fees paid to writers and producers. The 
studio started the fall season with six series on the air, but one has been 
cancelled and the other is on hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
Last month Disney decided to stop making one-hour shows, which are more 
difficult to sell as reruns and less likely to make a profit. But Ancier said 
that was not a factor in his decision to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Frank will oversee the network TV division until a new head is named. "We will 
definitely restructure it or bring in someone from the outside, but I don't 
know which at this point," he said. JOHN LIPPMAN

SURGE IN OIL PRICES SENDS DOW DOWN 20

<P>
Rumors of a Mideast war Thursday drove oil prices up by more than $3 a barrel, 
overriding Wall Street's relief over a budget compromise in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index sank 20.05 points to close at 2,484.16, joined 
in its fall by the broader market, which had been going its own way in recent 
days. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered advances by about 
4 to 3, with 624 up, 851 down and 487 unchanged. Big Board volume came to 
141.46 million shares, against 149.29 million Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The oil-sensitive Dow Jones index of transportation stocks fell sharply, down 
15.72 points or 1.8%, to 851.33. Higher oil prices are bad news for 
transportation firms. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said stocks were buffeted by a rumor in the morning, later denied, 
that President Bush had given Iraq an ultimatum to get out of Kuwait. Near the 
close, rumors that the United States had actually invaded Kuwait sent stocks 
into another tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
"There were all kinds of rumors," said one trader, "plus oil was up three 
bucks." Crude oil for December delivery rose $3.17 to $34.25 a barrel on the 
New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The near-completion of a federal budget package after five months of wrangling 
gave shares an early lift. Barring unexpected glitches, the deficit-reduction 
plan should be passed by Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Higher oil prices -- and awful profit reports -- combined to send airline 
stocks tumbling. Delta fell 3 1/8 to 58 5/8 after it reported a first-quarter 
loss of $1.27 a share. USAir dropped 5/8 to 16 after reporting a quarterly loss 
as well. Meanwhile, Federal Express fell 1 to 34 5/8 and HAL, parent of 
Hawaiian Air, tumbled 2 to 8 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
Also, UAL stock dropped 7/8 to 96, partly on news that AMR, the parent of 
American Airlines, had offered to outbid UAL's $400-million deal for Pan Am's 
core London routes. AMR fell 1 to 46 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
* MCA rose 7 to 57, recovering from a selloff Wednesday on concern that 
takeover talks with Matsushita Electric were stalled. Matsushita said the talks 
are progressing. 
</P>
<P>
* Among financial stocks, Coast Savings rose 1/2 to 3 1/8 after it announced it 
will omit its dividend. The news was expected. But S&amp;L and bank stocks in 
general continued to drop. Manufacturers Havover tumbled 1 1/2 to 20, First 
Interstate fell 1 to 19 1/2 and BankAmerica slipped 1/4 to 19 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Unisys lost 1/8 to 3 3/8. The company released a raft of bad news, including 
a $357-million loss for the third quarter. Among other technology stocks, Bell 
Industries fell 1 to 13 1/2 on disappointment over an 8% quarterly profit gain. 
</P>
<P>
* Tiffany slumped 2 1/4 to 31 1/8. The company said its domestic sales are 
slowing because of an "extremely cautious consumer." 
</P>
<P>
* Among consumer stocks, Quaker Oats gained 1 1/2 to 48 1/4. Traders cited 
Goldman Sachs' decision to add the stock to its recommended list. In the drug 
sector, most stocks were lower, but Agouron Pharmaceuticals of La Jolla rose 1 
1/4 to 6 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
* Oil stocks were mostly higher, but Tenneco fell 3 1/4 to 41 1/4 after it 
reported surprisingly weak third-quarter profits. Transco Energy dropped 2 7/8 
to 39 7/8 after it delayed third-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
Prices rebounded sharply on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, recouping the previous 
day's losses in a resumption of a rally that started almost two weeks ago. The 
Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, which shed 421.42 points Wednesday, jumped 
475.75 points to 25,352.63. 
</P>
<P>
In London, a late drop alongside Wall Street weakness pushed stocks down 
nervously in a market already depressed by high oil prices and lower corporate 
profits. The Financial Times 100-share index closed down 21.8 points at 
2,088.7. 
</P>
<P>
German share prices ended mixed in thin, cautious trading after Wednesday's 
turbulent session sent many participants to the sidelines. The 30-share DAX 
index closed up 3.76 points at 1,497.58. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT: Bond Prices Rise on Budget News 
</P>
<P>
The near-completion of the budget-reduction package helped bond prices advance 
moderately in light trading. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 9/32 point, or about 
$2.81 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which falls when the price rises, 
slipped to 8.75% from 8.77% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bond investors were heartened by the budget news because it could open the door 
for lower interest rates. The Federal Reserve has made passage of an agreement 
a prerequisite for an easing of its credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said bond prices also got a boost from a Labor Department report that 
initial claims for state unemployment insurance rose 26,000 on a seasonal basis 
in the week ended Oct. 13. The news indicated a further weakening of the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 8%, up from 7.875% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY: Dollar Makes Up Some Lost Ground 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rebounded on world currency markets to recoup steep losses posted 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
As the session unfolded, a flurry of rumors about U.S. military intentions in 
the Persian Gulf swept the market. The rumors encouraged investors to seek a 
safe haven in the dollar -- the currency of choice in times of turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a stop-and-go market," said Bob Morrissey, trader at the Bank of 
Boston. "There were constant rumors." 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was also supported by the budget agreement. "The market is saying 
that it has a little more faith in the whole process, in the validity of the 
budget," said Zlatko Glamuzina, chief dealer at Banco di Sicilia. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar settled at 128.25 yen, up from 126.49 on Wednesday. 
Against the German mark the dollar rose to 1.518 from Wednesday's 1.506. The 
British pound fell to $1.950 from $1.959 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: Gold Futures Rise; Silver Prices Drop 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices continued to climb as the resurgent oil market fanned inflation 
fears. But platinum prices dropped sharply, reflecting declining Japanese 
investor interest and worldwide economic jitters. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, grain and soybean futures retreated, and livestock 
was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures settled $2.30 to $2.40 higher on New York's Commodity Exchange, 
with the contract for spot delivery at $375.80 an ounce. The increase marked 
gold's sixth advance in the last seven sessions. It plunged to a three-month 
low of $360 on Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Silver futures settled 1.9 to 2 cents lower, with the spot price at $4.20 an 
ounce.

COAST SAVINGS' QUARTERLY LOSS IS $24 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coast Savings Financial Inc. on Thursday became the latest California thrift to 
report problems this month, posting a $24.4-million third-quarter loss and 
eliminating its dividend. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Los Angeles-based firm, at the urging of regulators, said it 
will file a plan showing how it will meet tougher federal standards for capital 
that are being phased in through 1994 -- as required by last year's thrift 
bailout law. The action is unusual because Coast is in compliance with the 
standards, albeit barely. Normally, plans governing capital -- the financial 
cushion that institutions maintain to protect against losses -- need to be 
filed only by thrifts failing to meet the standards. 
</P>
<P>
Coast, parent of Coast Federal Bank, said the plan is being filed to assure 
regulators that it will meet the standards -- which get tougher Jan. 1. The 
thrift's capital is thin, and it has posted losses recently. Through the first 
nine months of the year, it lost $47.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Coast's quarterly loss was caused mostly by $61 million that it set aside for 
losses that may occur on loans that turn bad in the future. The action was 
suggested by regulators at the Office of Thrift Supervision and Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. Regulators are increasingly concerned about how the softening 
economy and deteriorating real estate market will hurt institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The money that Coast is allocating is called a "general loan-loss reserve." 
That's something banks have done for years, but it's relatively new to the 
thrift industry, which is being forced to adopt more bank-like standards. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, thrifts set aside money to cover specific problem loans. The 
FDIC, which is examining thrifts -- as required by last year's savings and loan 
bailout law -- is putting them through tougher examinations. Thrift regulators 
also have tightened their standards. As a result, industry executives expect 
that other thrifts will be forced to take similar actions. 
</P>
<P>
Coast, the state's 10th-largest thrift, is the third major California S&amp;L 
this month to cut its dividend. CalFed and Glenfed cut their dividends sharply. 
Coast was paying shareholders a quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Chief Executive Ray Martin said a proposed sale of 27 branches with $1.2 
billion in deposits is moving quickly and there is more than one interested 
buyer. The sale would give a much-needed boost to Coast's capital. 
</P>
<P>
In the year-earlier third quarter, Coast posted a $92.2-million loss caused by 
a major restructuring.

UAL NET DIPS; DELTA, USAIR POST LOSSES

<P>
UAL Corp. said Thursday that its earnings fell slightly in the third quarter, 
largely due to rapidly rising jet fuel prices and costs associated with a 
failed employee takeover effort. 
</P>
<P>
Delta Air Lines Inc. and USAir Group Inc. posted quarterly losses. 
</P>
<P>
The quarter is traditionally one of the strongest for the industry, which has 
been dogged this year by weak demand in an uncertain economy. 
</P>
<P>
The parent company of United Airlines had a profit of $106.1 million, compared 
to $110.9 million in last year's third quarter. Revenue rose to $2.97 billion 
from $2.58 billion. 
</P>
<P>
UAL said the buyout effort, which was rejected Oct. 9 after a union-led group 
failed to get financing, cost the company $30 million, which was charged 
against third-quarter earnings. The fees included a $9-million payment to 
Gerald Greenwald, the ex-Chrysler vice chairman who led the failed buyout 
effort, and fees to the unions' lawyers, bankers and public relations firm. A 
failed 1989 effort by management and pilots to take over the airline cost the 
company $76 million, which was charged earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The fees have generated controversy among UAL shareholders, and are the subject 
of lawsuits against UAL in Chicago and Wilmington, Del. In an interview 
Thursday, assistant general counsel Kayla Gillan said the California Public 
Employees' Retirement System was considering taking part in two suits that 
concern the latest buyout fees. The retirement system, one of the nation's 
largest and most influential pension funds, already is a plaintiff in suits 
that involve fees associated with the first buyout attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The suits contend that the fees should have been paid by the buyout groups, not 
the company, and that the payments are an improper use of corporate funds. 
</P>
<P>
UAL's third-quarter profit was also hurt by jet fuel costs, which rose to an 
average of 73 cents a gallon from 61.3 cents. "Moreover, we expect the average 
price to be significantly higher in the fourth quarter," Chairman Stephen M. 
Wolf said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said the company's results were better than expected. 
"Compared to the group, the numbers were excellent," said Edward Starkman, an 
analyst at Paine Webber. 
</P>
<P>
UAL said its third-quarter earnings picture was brightened by a gain of $93 
million from the sale of property, mainly aircraft. In last year's third 
quarter, UAL posted similar gains of $45.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
UAL said the number of miles flown by its paying passengers rose to 21.63 
billion from 19.34 billion in last year's third quarter. The airline's load 
factor fell to 70.8% from 71.9%. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine months that ended Sept. 30, UAL earned $218 million, compared to 
$317.4 million in the first nine months of 1989. Revenue rose to $8.23 billion 
from $7.43 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta-based Delta said it lost $51.6 million, compared to net profit of 
$133.1 million in last year's third quarter. Revenue for the quarter was 
virtually flat at $2.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Delta's passenger traffic was down during the quarter, with a passenger load 
factor of 61.3%, compared to 65.7% in the comparable quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
A Delta statement said the airline also faced increased competition from rival 
Eastern Air Lines Inc., whose operations were largely reduced by a strike in 
the year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
Delta also announced that it will raise domestic fares by 5.8%, effective 
Wednesday, in response to fuel costs that have more than doubled since July 31. 
</P>
<P>
Arlington, Va.-based USAir posted a loss of $120.3 million, compared to a loss 
of $77.7 million in last year's third quarter. Revenue rose to $1.64 billion 
from $1.53 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The company blamed high fuel costs for the poor performance and noted that 
passenger traffic increased more than 6% in the period.

KCET MAY RECONSIDER DROPPING 'AFRICA NOW'; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: COMMUNITY GROUPS AND ITS OWN ADVISORY PANEL CRITICIZE HALT TO 
PUBLIC-AFFAIRS SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Under fire from community organizations and its own Community Advisory Board, 
public-television station KCET Channel 28 on Thursday opened the door slightly 
to the possibility that it would reconsider the decision to halt broadcasts of 
the news-magazine "South Africa Now." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, two local cable systems have stepped in to try to fill the 
void. Cencom Cable, which serves the Pasadena and San Gabriel Valley areas, and 
Century Cable in Los Angeles said that they will begin carrying "South Africa 
Now" when it leaves KCET. 
</P>
<P>
KCET station manager and programming chief Stephen Kulczycki, who last week 
decided to drop the program, said Thursday that he stands by his original 
objection that the program was slanted in favor of the African National 
Congress but that he will monitor it in coming weeks to see if it becomes more 
balanced. 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to monitor the series on the satellite feeds and try to get 
some sense of whether the concerns we've expressed might show up in the 
program," Kulczycki said. "If (the producers) address the concerns we have 
talked about, we might reconsider the choices we have made." 
</P>
<P>
"South Africa Now" producer Danny Schechter said that he was pleased Kulczycki 
had opened the door to reconsideration but that he will not do anything 
differently because he feels the program has always been fair. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's going to monitor, he'll find that the same program he rejected will 
have a balanced presentation of what's going on in South Africa," Schechter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, "South Africa Now" remains scheduled to leave KCET after the 
last installment of the current 13-week batch runs Sunday at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
KCET's decision not to renew the program has enraged members of the Los Angeles 
African-American community and anti-apartheid groups, who have threatened to 
picket the station. 
</P>
<P>
Several brought their complaints to the regularly scheduled meeting of KCET's 
Community Advisory Board on Wednesday, and the board, whose volunteer members 
are appointed to provide community feedback to station management, took up the 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory board issued a statement Thursday demanding that " 'South Africa 
Now' be returned to the air with a discussion panel or other vehicle to broaden 
the range of issues covered; and/or (that KCET) immediately provide additional 
(regular) programming on South Africa and the entire continent of Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Unhappiness with KCET's decision increased after a conservative media watchdog 
organization claimed credit for having brought the show's alleged bias to 
KCET's attention. David Horowitz, chairman of the Committee on Media Integrity, 
met with station executives as many as half a dozen times and conducted a 
yearlong letter-writing campaign against "South Africa Now" and other programs 
broadcast on KCET. 
</P>
<P>
KCET has vigorously denied Horowitz's contentions, but relations with community 
members did not improve when the station canceled a scheduled meeting with 
concerned leaders that was to have been held Wednesday. That evening, the 
organizers who had planned to meet with Kulczycki and KCET president William 
Kobin appeared instead before the Community Advisory Board. 
</P>
<P>
"African Americans are appalled," said Quincy Beaver, representing the 
California Democratic Council. "We are stunned." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Zinzun, the executive director of Friends of the African National 
Congress and Front Line States, disputed Kulczycki's contention that because 
there was no longer a press blackout in South Africa, the program was no longer 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"It has just been 24 hours since George Bush vetoed the Civil Rights Act," 
Zinzun said. "We are not in a position where we can let down our guard about 
racism." 
</P>
<P>
In its statement Thursday, the advisory board said that it wanted to be 
consulted about future programming decisions that might affect the community 
and requested that the meeting with community leaders be rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
The board also said it did not believe that Horowitz had in any way influenced 
management's decision regarding "South Africa Now." 
</P>
<P>
Kobin said Thursday that he could not respond to the board's demands because he 
had not yet read the statement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really gratified that they believe we acted for the reasons we said we 
acted," Kobin said. "Obviously, I'm disappointed that they don't agree with the 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
The move by the local cable systems to pick up "South Africa Now" comes at a 
time when cable -- through its non-commercial community access channels -- is 
taking more of a role in airing alternative programming. 
</P>
<P>
"If the end result is that a program that doesn't have any other outlet can 
turn to cable, that works out for the common good," said Craig Watson, general 
manager of Cencom Cable.

S.F.'S FESTIVAL 2000 FACES BANKRUPTCY; 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: THE 23-DAY, MULTICULTURAL ARTS FESTIVAL IS $500,000 IN DEBT. ITS BOARD 
MET WEDNESDAY TO CONSIDER CHAPTER 11.

Festival 2000, a Bay Area multicultural arts festival running through Sunday, 
is $500,000 in debt and is strongly considering bankruptcy. But many of the 
presenting organizations in the $2.3-million festival are going ahead despite 
the loss of financial backing. 
</P>
<P>
Al Williams, vice president of the Festival 2000 board of directors, said the 
organization's outstanding financial obligations include $170,000 in contracted 
fees to a variety of arts groups. Among them are American Conservatory Theatre, 
which is owed $32,000, and the American Indian Dance Theatre, owed $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the board of directors met Wednesday to consider filing for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but no announcement had been made by Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers from the Indian Dance Theatre have contacted the board of Festival 2000 
regarding fees owed for its performance at the opening night gala Oct. 6. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been informed they intend to file legal action," Williams said. "If we 
find ourselves being sued by a number of people we may have no recourse but to 
file for bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
But Williams also said: "The board has not resigned itself nor thrown up its 
hands over this debt. We're still looking for ways to meet our obligations." 
</P>
<P>
The festival, billed as "one of the most comprehensive celebrations of the arts 
ever held in an American city," was slated to present during its 23-day run 
more than 200 performances and a total of 54 performing and visual arts events, 
primarily by African-American, Asian-American and Latino artists. The city 
endorsed the event with a contribution of $500,000 from the Grants for the Arts 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
But Oct. 17, after 11 days of events, executive producer Lenwood Sloan 
announced that the festival had "suspended operations as a presenting and 
producing organization" due to a "shortfall" in fund-raising, 
lower-than-expected box-office receipts and a 5%-10% cost overrun. 
</P>
<P>
Sloan, who was on an undisclosed salary until that date, then volunteered his 
services. When contacted Wednesday, Sloan said only that the festival had run 
out of funds and that "there's a very strong movement in action by the board to 
meet their responsibilities." Sloan referred all other questions to Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Sloan is scheduled to become the director of the $4.4 million Inter-Arts 
Program at the National Endowment for the Arts in November. Kathy Christie, NEA 
press officer, read an NEA statement that concluded: "Mr. Sloan has our respect 
and complete confidence." 
</P>
<P>
"We are familiar with the financial difficulties experienced by Festival 2000. 
. . . While it appears the scale of Festival 2000 might have been 
overambitious, and certain support planned for it did not materialize, its 
performances and exhibitions have received widespread acclaim for their 
artistry and creativity," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
"To our knowledge, the financial problems of Festival 2000 were due to a number 
of circumstances and were completely beyond the ability of any one individual 
to control." 
</P>
<P>
Kary Shulman, executive director for S.F. Grants for the Arts, said her agency 
launched the festival effort two years ago with a $500,000 grant and the hiring 
of Sloan, a New York based arts consultant producer and the former deputy 
director of the California Arts Council. 
</P>
<P>
"We made the initial $500,000 investment and then it seemed clear the festival 
needed its freedom," Shulman said. "Other than putting in the money, we 
actually did very little. Perhaps we should have done more."

SELLARS CALLS 'BOTCHED' FEST A 'MIRACLE' TOO; 
</P>
<P>
ASSESSMENT: LOS ANGELES FESTIVAL DIRECTOR REPORTS STAGING PROBLEMS BUT ALSO 
ARTISTIC ACHIEVEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a surprisingly candid assessment of September's Los Angeles Festival, 
festival director Peter Sellars said Wednesday night his staff had "botched" 
much of the mechanical and technical aspects of staging the 17-day arts 
extravaganza but declared the artistic achievements and "feelings" produced in 
the city a "miracle." 
</P>
<P>
"There were many, many moments that were embarrassing and deplorable," Sellars 
said during a public "Post-Partum Los Angeles Festival" discussion at the 
Pacific Design Center. "But we had very, very limited money. For the same 
amount of money we could have done very beautifully 1/10th the things we did. 
But instead we decided to do 10 times more things . . . and we were under the 
illusion that we could do these things justice." 
</P>
<P>
The festival succeeded, Sellars said, by providing new cultural experiences and 
a "fixable" model that could be easily improved for the next festival, planned 
for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
"The things that were good I've never seen so good anywhere else," he said. 
"And the things that were bad are things that are done everywhere else, pretty 
well, nearly every day of the week. So it's things that are fixable." 
</P>
<P>
Those fixable things were problems such as a virtually unreadable ticket 
brochure, inaccessible performances and poorly paid artists, whom Sellars said 
are always "cheated" at festivals and that this one was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
Both Sellars and festival executive director Judith Luther, who attended but 
did not address the 200 people at Wednesday's event, said final tallies on 
accounting and attendance figures will not be compiled until near the end of 
the year. The 1990 festival will not even receive its final grants until 
December, Luther said, and many bills still have to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know (what the final figures will be), but I think we'll just 
squeak by," Luther said. "There probably won't be a nest egg, but we've already 
started raising money (for 1993), so that will be our nest egg." 
</P>
<P>
Sellars did not discuss concrete changes he will make for his next festival but 
noted that this time around, "It was too hard -- I'd like to make it less hard 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Most specifically," he said, "we were late (with major decisions such as 
programming and funding), and it was because the festival was not capitalized 
until the last moment. There was never the sense that (we) knew what (we) were 
doing, right up to the point where we designed the festival so that nobody 
(else) knew what we were doing. . . . And we didn't make it easy to get to. You 
really had to go out of your way. 
</P>
<P>
"The miracle is that it did happen," Sellars continued. "We were told every day 
that it would not happen, even right up through the festival itself. . . . It 
was like a lab experience, some things blow up, some things foam over, and the 
idea is to do it better next time." 
</P>
<P>
Although attendance was half of that expected, the listeners were enthusiastic 
and at times broke into spontaneous applause. Many were eager to laud the 
festival and discuss their personal experiences at the public session 
concluding the discussions.

WHITE OAK PROJECT PREVIEW A TRIUMPH 
</P>

"It was nice that he wasn't classical," a dancegoer at Wang Center for the 
Performing Arts remarked in a surprised tone to her companion as Mikhail 
Baryshnikov's White Oak Dance Project adjourned for intermission. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Wednesday evening's preview performance, in effect the debut of 
Baryshnikov's elite mini-troupe of 10 dancers, was extravagantly nice and 
classically unclassical. Harnessing Baryshnikov's handpicked team to Mark 
Morris's ingenious creations turned out, not unexpectedly, to be a master 
stroke, and it was rewarded with a roaring, standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
As Baryshnikov has said he wishes, White Oak is an egalitarian band of prime 
movers, most of them veterans from ballet and modern dance. Beginning with 
"Going Away Party," whose music -- by Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys -- 
cannot obscure its smart stepping, White Oak's dancers were individually as 
well as collectively compelling. 
</P>
<P>
Baryshnikov, of course, is more equal than the others; even though he is 
standing in the back of the group as they wave a howdy in "Going Away Party," 
he manages to capture attention. 
</P>
<P>
Here, he cuts a mean diagonal as a lovelorn cowboy figure, a perfectly tumbling 
tumbleweed. With his hair slicked back, wearing denim and fringe and white 
boots, Baryshnikov is the odd man out as the good ol' boys and girls recapture 
a bygone spirit of innocent lechery on the plains. 
</P>
<P>
What's equally fun is Morris's lighthanded evocation of other dances. As 
couples join hands and shuffle-step, they're outlining a Texas two-step. Morris 
makes a square dance's Grand Right and Left by having two people switch places, 
making us see, in that quote, a whole, turning circle. 
</P>
<P>
The voluptuous -- no kidding -- Morris and the slender Baryshnikov were a tangy 
contrast in the charming, flicker-footed "Pas de Poisson," set to Satie's 
"Entr'acte Symphonique de Relache," with Kate Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Baryshnikov again played babe-in-the-wood, acting bemused by the intricacies of 
performance, responding gamely to the moment of the actual pass of the poisson. 
Here they're rubber and the trio passes them into the wings. Then he wilts, 
sinking eloquently into the floor, eyes wide in panic, as Johnson and Morris 
leave him standing out there alone. 
</P>
<P>
But Baryshnikov's panicked pose was just that. His solo "10 Suggestions," set 
to Alexander Tcherepnin's "Bagatelles," which Morris himself had danced last 
year, this time offered a glimpse of a brilliant dancer creating movement 
rather than a brilliant choreographer dancing. As Baryshnikov worked with the 
props, from a hoop to a pith helmet, they seemed not as funny as they had when 
Morris used them; now they were things that made us see how a dancer uses 
space. 
</P>
<P>
"Motorcade," a new work for the group, set to Saint-Saens Septet, and performed 
by eight dancers costumed in dark-hued velvet pants, was the most classically 
oriented of all the pieces. It offered Promethean poses, glimpses of dancers 
Rob Besserer and Peggy Baker in ravishing turns, and moments when Besserer and 
Baryshnikov were borne aloft like statues on a feast day. 
</P>
<P>
Couples raced across the floor as if on wings; quartets reached toward each 
other as they filled the stage on the diagonal. In its moments of light and 
darkness, "Motorcade" magnificently captured the dynamic of the human spirit in 
the way that always sets Morris' work apart.

HOME TECH / VIDEO: A LOOK BACK ON HORROR FILMS OF THE '80S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A complaint heard quite often around Halloween is that they don't make horror 
movies like they used to. Translation: Horror movies in the last decade or so 
are too graphic and grisly. 
</P>
<P>
Styles indeed have changed. Some of the horror classics, like "Frankenstein, " 
"Dracula" and "The Wolf Man," now seem very dated, partly because the special 
effects were comparatively crude and there wasn't much gore. 
</P>
<P>
What happened in the '70s is that gore took over, a trend that continued into 
the '80s as filmmakers tried to appeal to the teen audience, which regarded 
splatter movies as very hip. Many of that decade's best horror movies are 
extremely bloody and also have a high schlock quotient. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the best horror movies of the '80s -- all easily available on 
video: 
</P>
<P>
* "The Fog" (Nelson Entertainment, 1980). Though more arty than gory, director 
John Carpenter's movie is hailed by some fright-flick connoisseurs as possibly 
the scariest movie of the '80s. Starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Adrienne Barbeau, 
it's about the ghosts of an 1800s' shipwreck haunting a California town, which 
is fog-enshrouded, of course. If this one doesn't give you chills, you're 
immune to chillers. 
</P>
<P>
* "Child's Play" (MGM/UA, 1988). After seeing this, you'll never trust a doll 
again. Six-year-old Andy (Alex Vincent) is given a doll, named Chucky, who's 
possessed by the soul of a killer. As the bodies pile up, only Andy knows that 
cute little Chucky is secretly a homicidal maniac. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Nightmare on Elm Street" (Media, 1984). Freddie Krueger has become such 
a cult figure -- and such a ham in the string of sequels -- that you tend to 
forget that he once was a genuinely scary and ingenious character. This 
disfigured maniac invades the nightmares of high school kids, killing the 
dreamers. The sequels, which focus too much on Freddie the cult hero and overdo 
the campy humor, aren't as scary. 
</P>
<P>
* "Aliens" (CBS-Fox, 1986). Directed by James Cameron, this is one of the few 
sequels that surpasses the original. The first one (1979) features a monster 
that wipes out a space-ship crew. In the sequel, a squadron headed by the lone 
survivor of the first movie (Sigourney Weaver, a best-actress Oscar nominee) 
finds a planet crawling with the slimy creatures. The shock-filled second half 
will keep you on the edge of your seat. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Fly"(CBS-Fox, 1986). A version of the beauty and the beast tale that's 
both horrifying and touching. Jeff Goldblum, a best-actor Oscar nominee for his 
portrayal, plays a scientist who winds up part man, part fly when an experiment 
goes awry. As the fly genes slowly take over, the scientist turns into a 
pathetic monster, with only his girlfriend (Geena Davis) to console him. If you 
can't find this one at your video store, don't settle for the awful sequel, 
"The Fly II." The original (CBS-Fox, 1958), which seemed scary in the '50s, 
looks tame now. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Hitcher" (HBO, 1986). A young student (C. Thomas Howell) is stalked by a 
vicious hitchhiker (Rutger Hauer), who's been hacking up his victims. You never 
know what's eating away at this cold-blooded murderer but that makes him an 
every more horrifying figure. 
</P>
<P>
* "Re-Animator" (Vestron, 1985). In this nifty B-movie, based on an H. P. 
Lovecraft tale, a medical student discovers a potion to revive the dead. 
Zombies run wild. So do severed body parts. The black -- and blue -- humor adds 
spice to director Stuart Gordon's gorefest. 
</P>
<P>
* "Scanners" (Nelson Entertainment, 1981). Bringing new meaning to the phrase, 
"using your head," director David Cronenberg's often terrifying movie is about 
a group of supernatural beings, called scanners, with brainpower so potent that 
they can make people's heads explode. You can imagine the fun the 
special-effects crew had with this movie.

JUDGE UPHOLDS FINE IN USE OF BANNED FARM TOOL; 
</P>
<P>
OXNARD: A CONTRACTOR MUST PAY $7,500 FOR ALLOWING WORKERS TO USE SHORT-HANDLED 
KNIVES, WHICH CAN CAUSE CRIPPLING BACK INJURIES. 
</P>

<P>
A $7,500 state fine against an Oxnard contractor cited twice by the state for 
providing field workers with short-handled tools has been upheld on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Molina Labor Services Inc. in March provided a crew weeding a celery field with 
the type of short-handled knives banned for two decades because they cause 
crippling back injuries, an administrative law judge found last week in 
upholding the stiff state fine. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Jacqueline S. Drucker found the violation to be serious and willful, 
since it followed a similar citation against the company last October. 
</P>
<P>
In her decision, Drucker cited the testimony of company President Jose A. 
Molina Sr. 
</P>
<P>
"We got caught," Molina testified during a September appeals hearing. He 
testified that it was the company's fault that the violations had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Cal/OSHA, the state worker-safety agency, said the fine is 
unusually large for a farm violation. It is also rare that a large fine is 
upheld in full on appeal, said Rick Rice, spokesman for the California 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The state's case against Molina was built partly through photos and testimony 
from California Rural Legal Assistance workers in Oxnard, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
After a CRLA complaint in October, the state found Molina's company had allowed 
laborers to use short-handled knives to weed a parsley field in Somis and 
declared the incident a serious violation of health and safety law. The fine 
was $250, which Molina did not appeal. 
</P>
<P>
In March, CRLA community worker Emanuel Benitez again spotted a Molina crew 
working with short-handled knives at a Hueneme Road farm near Oxnard, according 
to hearing testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Benitez testified that a crew member told him that workers were instructed by 
the Molina foreman to use long-handled tools when they were near the edge of 
the field and could be easily seen by passersby, but to revert to short-handled 
knives in the middle of the field. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows a callousness, a disregard for the workers," farm worker lawyer Lee 
Plisou said. "It suggests that they are not treated as human beings but as 
machines. And when the machines break down, they just get new ones." 
</P>
<P>
Molina, testifying under subpoena, said laborers prefer to use the 
short-handled knives to weed fields because it is easier. 
</P>
<P>
In the March incident, Molina testified, the farm owner wanted his crew to use 
the short knives. He added that the foreman allowed use of the shorter tools. 
Molina also testified that he thought short-handled knives were routinely used 
by other field crews in the county.

BUSING FAILS TO EASE LOAD ON SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: MORE THAN 20,000 STUDENTS ARE STILL TRANSPORTED FROM NEIGHBORHOOD 
CAMPUSES BECAUSE OF OVERCROWDING. MEASURES OPENED SEATS IN DISTRICT, BUT FEW IN 
AREAS HIT BY ENROLLMENT GROWTH. 
</P>

<P>
Despite taking measures last spring to increase classroom space at 109 
elementary schools, the Los Angeles Unified School District is still busing 
more than 20,000 students from overcrowded neighborhood campuses, the school 
board was told Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The plan to ease overcrowding generated 17,526 additional elementary seats in 
the district this semester by putting 64 schools on year-round schedules and 
letting another 45 add portable classrooms or increase class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
But few of those seats were in the neighborhoods hit hardest by enrollment 
growth this fall, meaning the 625,000-student district must continue to bus its 
overflow students to suburban-area schools with empty seats. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Wohlers, head of the district office that coordinates use of classroom 
space, told the board that 6,000 students who were bused last year were able to 
return to their neighborhood schools this fall because the overcrowding plan 
gave the district twice as many available elementary seats as last year. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, if the board does not take more drastic steps to create space at 
all elementary, junior and senior high schools, another 24,000 students will be 
crowded out of their local schools and onto buses in the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
Wohlers predicted that ultimately all 600 district schools will have to operate 
year-round, multitrack schedules to accommodate enrollment growth estimated at 
about 15,000 students per year. "We see that as an inevitability," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, 170 district schools operate year-round, most of them on multitrack 
calendars which divide students into groups with staggered attendance 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Multitrack plans generate about one-third more classroom space because one 
group of students is always on vacation. Such plans have been used by the 
district since 1974, but remain controversial because of criticism by parents 
who fear families and friends would be split by different schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, the board voted to put all the district's schools on a year-round 
schedule by 1991. Classes would begin at most schools in mid-August and last 
through the end of June, with a six-week mid-winter break. All students would 
attend at the same time. Most schools would likely not have to convert to 
multitrack until districtwide enrollment outstrips available seats, which could 
happen by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to start planning for that now because if we don't, we're going to 
be up against a rock in three years," said board member Mark Slavkin. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning next month, the board will consider a series of options aimed at 
increasing capacity at all the district's schools, including converting some 
schools to multitrack and adding more portables to others. 
</P>
<P>
The focus has shifted from getting students into their neighborhood schools to 
merely finding enough space to seat them anywhere in the district. The district 
has been hamstrung by funding constraints in efforts to build new schools and 
faces unrelenting growth in its most overcrowded areas. It has become clear, 
Wohlers said, that some of the district's children will never have the chance 
to attend their neighborhood schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really see where the answer is going to come from," said board member 
Roberta Weintraub.

CASE AGAINST BRANDO ERODES; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: THE PROSECUTION REFUSES TO NEGOTIATE A SETTLEMENT IN MURDER CASE -- SO 
FAR. BUT THE INABILITY TO SUBPOENA CHEYENNE BRANDO IS REGARDED AS A MAJOR 
HURDLE.

<P>
The murder case against Marlon Brando's son, Christian -- once described by 
authorities as airtight -- has been unravelled significantly by the 
prosecution's inability to subpoena a key witness and introduce as evidence a 
taped interrogation of the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
With the trial scheduled to begin Nov. 5, the district attorney's office is 
holding fast to its position of refusing to negotiate a settlement with young 
Brando in the high-profile case. But there are growing signs of concern among 
prosecutors about proving a murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old welder, Brando's eldest son, is charged with murdering Dag 
Drollet, his sister's lover, last May in the actor's hilltop compound on 
Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The defense has tried a plea bargain reducing the charge to voluntary 
manslaughter. But the case appears inexorably headed for trial. Santa Monica 
Superior Court Judge Robert Thomas has ordered in 255 prospective jurors. Each 
who is not excused for hardship -- the trial is expected to last several months 
-- will be asked to fill out a long questionnaire before being interviewed 
about what they know of the case, their view of the defendant's movie star 
father and their personal use of alcohol and drugs, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
The problem haunting the prosecution is what most participants concede is 
bumbled police work, which has rendered the defendant's taped statements 
inadmissible and allowed his sister to travel home to Tahiti, beyond the reach 
of U.S. law. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, however, have said that a plea bargain might be misconstrued by 
the public as favoritism toward a Hollywood legend, thus complicating efforts 
to resolve the case without a trial. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner was ill Thursday and could not be reached for comment on 
his position on a possible plea bargain. However, Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Greg 
Thompson said through a spokesman that while prosecutors are "ethically bound 
to discuss disposition of the case" with the defense, "our present efforts are 
focused on getting our key witness, Cheyenne, back to Los Angeles to testify." 
</P>
<P>
If that effort fails, prosecutors said they might be more amenable to a plea 
bargain. But by then, the defense may prefer to take its chances by going to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gamesmanship," grinned Deputy Dist. Atty. Bill Clark. 
</P>
<P>
If prosecutors decide to go to trial, they must make a host of other strategic 
decisions: Should they call Marlon Brando as a witness before the defense does? 
Can they force Christian Brando to take the stand by keeping out testimony from 
a policeman who might support his "accident" defense? Can they establish 
through other witnesses that Brando threatened Drollet previously? Would 
Brando's girlfriend be an asset or a liability as a witness? 
</P>
<P>
Cheyenne Brando was the last person to see Drollet alive, other than the 
defendant. She took a flight to Tahiti last June after telling police that the 
shooting was "not an accident. It was a murder, in case you don't know it." She 
has since told authorities in Tahiti that her father and her brother's 
girlfriend also were involved -- and even suggested to a French judge that he 
view "The Godfather" to understand the story. But none of her statements is 
admissible unless defense attorneys can cross-examine her. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities here made no move to prevent her from leaving the country, they 
said, because Marlon Brando assured them that she would remain in Los Angeles 
for the birth of Drollet's and her child. Once home in Tahiti, she was charged 
by the French government as an accomplice in the death of Drollet, a French 
citizen, and forbidden to leave. 
</P>
<P>
After being rebuffed by state or federal courts, prosecutors have now requested 
that the U.S. State Department ask the French for help. Without her, 
prosecutors say privately, they have little chance of proving even murder in 
the second degree. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get into the area of murder, you're looking at (the defendant's) 
state of mind," said Clark. "Cheyenne is the key, and we're not optimistic 
about getting her back." 
</P>
<P>
Another setback involves a statement Christian Brando gave police. Prosecutors 
intended to use it to prove that the shooting was premeditated. In it, Brando 
said he had stopped off at his girlfriend's apartment to retrieve the 
.45-caliber semiautomatic pistol used in the shooting minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
However, because the police detective conducting the interview did not properly 
advise him of his Miranda rights, the entire statement has been ruled 
inadmissible. 
</P>
<P>
Should the case go to trial, it is certain to produce a legal spectacle, even 
though Marlon Brando will be barred because he is expected to be a witness. 
</P>
<P>
Already, pretrial hearings have attracted paparazzi from around the world. The 
crush of spectators has led to reserved seating for reporters and roped-off 
areas for cameras at Santa Monica's small courthouse. The magnet? Appearances 
by Marlon Brando, once reclusive but now made garrulous by his son's legal 
predicament. 
</P>
<P>
Not all spectators are Brando fans. A contingent from Tahiti, including the 
victim's parents, has attended some pretrial hearings and plans to attend in 
hopes of seeing the killer punished. 
</P>
<P>
Jacques Drollet, Dag's outspoken father, told The Times in a telephone 
interview that he is incensed his son is being portrayed as a woman-beater and 
Cheyenne Brando as his unfortunate victim. 
</P>
<P>
"We are aware that the closer we get to the trial, the more desperate Marlon 
Brando will feel and the more dirt and mud he will shovel on my son and his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
"He told police that Dag had never beaten Cheyenne; he knows Dag is a very 
gentle young man. But maybe he had to sing another song or change the words for 
the benefit of his case." (The elder Brando now contends he has proof that his 
daughter was beaten, a crucial part of the defense.) 
</P>
<P>
"Brando is an actor and even in his private life he is always acting. He can 
cry and lie like a horse can run. But this is Mr. Marlon Brando in his worst 
role, his worst scenario. I think he is making the whole case his own case." 
</P>
<P>
Drollet said that although Cheyenne has been hospitalized twice in Papeete for 
drug detoxification, she appears to be in fine fettle: 
</P>
<P>
"She is now out having a good time. She is roaming about in Papeete, the main 
town of Tahiti, where she has been seen shopping with her mother, Tarita, and 
her infant son, Tookie," Drollet said. "She is also going out to the beaches 
and the nightclubs with her new Italian boyfriend." 
</P>
<P>
Drollet expressed hope that the case would go to trial. "The procedure for 
murder shouldn't be stopped along the way -- the American and French justice 
system must go to the end of the road."

HOUSING MEASURE GETS WIDE SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's $100-million housing bond measure has attracted so many endorsements 
from disparate groups that campaign experts are using "unprecedented" and 
"historic" to describe its rise from obscurity in a season of hotly competing 
bond measures. 
</P>
<P>
The county Republican Party is featuring Proposition K on its slate mailings 
next week, and party officials glowingly refer to the measure as a "Jack 
Kemp-style" housing initiative that embraces low-income home ownership and 
development of affordable housing by nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles and San Fernando Valley Boards of Realtors say Proposition K is 
"an issue you can't argue with" and the Realtors' statewide political action 
committee has given the campaign a hefty $40,000 to prove their point. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, left-leaning tenant activists such as the Coalition for 
Economic Survival, which helped write some segments of Proposition K, are 
leafletting hundreds of low-income buildings to get out the vote. The county 
Democratic Party and major homeowner organizations also have lent their names 
to the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if the stars were all lined up in the sky or what, but we have an 
unprecedented mix of backers that nobody in the city can recall occurring on a 
bond measure before," said Gary Squier, a developer and expert on affordable 
housing measures. 
</P>
<P>
The innovative measure would provide $80 million for nonprofit groups to buy 
and rehabilitate 6,000 low-income apartment units that are at risk of being 
lost to earthquakes, demolition or gentrification. Another $10 million would 
build shelters for the homeless, and $10 million would provide loans for 
low-wage home buyers shut out of the costly Los Angeles market. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a bond issue Los Angeles can't afford to lose," said Barbara Grover, 
campaign consultant to Proposition K's committee, Taxpayers to Save the 
American Dream. "This isn't a library bond issue or something else that would 
be nice to have. It's critical." 
</P>
<P>
However, because Proposition K would increase property taxes -- by about $4.95 
per year for the average homeowner -- the measure needs two-thirds voter 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
The only public figure to step forward in opposition to the housing measure is 
City Councilman Nate Holden, who wrote the ballot argument against it. 
</P>
<P>
Holden was out of town and could not be reached for comment, but has complained 
recently that "voters approve too many bond measures" and that such city 
housing problems should be handled by the state and federal government. 
</P>
<P>
For Mayor Tom Bradley and the rest of the City Council, which overwhelmingly 
supports Proposition K, the most crucial need is for earthquake renovation 
funds. Today, about 40,000 of the city's poorest residents live in aging brick 
buildings that engineers say would become death traps in a major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about 40,000 or more homeless overnight -- if they survive the 
quake," said Michael Bodaken, Bradley's housing coordinator. "The mayor is 
asking the public to back this badly needed measure." 
</P>
<P>
Carl Deppe, the city's earthquake safety chief, said his agency has fought to 
get the city's thousands of brick buildings reinforced since the 1971 Sylmar 
earthquake that killed 65 people and wreaked havoc on brick structures. 
</P>
<P>
After years of prodding, most apartment owners have finally complied with a 
1981 city law requiring seismic strengthening, which can cost as much as 
$10,000 per apartment unit. 
</P>
<P>
According to Deppe, 25,372 units have been reinforced -- but amid a worsening 
housing shortage, the city has lost 6,014 low-rent brick units that were torn 
down by exasperated owners. More ominously, nearly 11,000 endangered units 
still stand, their owners unable or unwilling to comply. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just intransigent owners; it is owners who really need financial help 
to do it," Deppe said. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition K has been endorsed by the Central City Assn. of downtown business 
interests; the Countywide Alliance of HUD-Subsidized Tenants; the Coalition for 
Economic Survival; the Sierra Club; the Hillside Federation of Home Owners 
Assn.; the Lakeview Terrace Home Owners Assn.; the United Paramedics of Los 
Angeles and the Los Angeles Countywide Coalition for Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The business sector, which virtually ignored a similar housing bond measure 
that failed by just 2% last year, is giving generously to Proposition K, mostly 
in $1,000 and $2,000 amounts, resulting in a campaign chest of $132,000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to $40,000 from real estate groups, major contributions include: 
$10,000 from Maguire Thomas Partners' Nelson Rising, co-chairman of the 
measure's finance committee; $10,000 from Arco, whose president, Robert Wykoff, 
is also co-chairman of the committee; $10,000 from Maguire Thomas Partners; and 
$5,250 from the campaign of state Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti 
(D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Proposition K's eclectic support proves that nobody wants to see Los Angeles 
deteriorate "into a place of have and have-nots," said Bodaken. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Bradley and other proponents are somewhat worried that Holden's 
opposition could hurt the measure's chances. Some campaign consultants believe 
that the very existence of an opposition ballot argument, regardless of merit, 
can draw thousands of votes away from an otherwise popular measure. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time Holden has played the role of spoiler. He infuriated 
city officials and neighborhood leaders in 1988, when he acted as the lone 
dissenter on a bond measure to upgrade and build city libraries -- including 
libraries in his own district. The measure failed that year. 
</P>
<P>
In the housing measure's favor, however, is the fact that a similar bond 
measure was on the ballot in 1989, so voters will be somewhat familiar with 
earthquake safety issues. That 1989 housing bond measure, supported by 
contributions of only $21,000, failed by just 3,500 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Analysis of that defeat has shown that San Fernando Valley voters gave it a 
lukewarm yes vote of less than 60%. In contrast, many areas of the city -- 
including Holden's 10th District -- racked up yes votes of well over 70%. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign committee hopes to change the Valley's soft voter attitude toward 
the housing crisis. Councilman Hal Bernson, a Valley Republican and fiscal 
conservative, has become a leading proponent of Proposition K. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the nearly 11,000 earthquake-unsafe units that could be improved 
in part by Proposition K, the measure makes funds available to save some of the 
city's more than 26,000 federally protected apartments whose rent controls 
expire in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Without a program to buy out owners of these units, most officials expect 
gentrification and steep rent increases in areas where the buildings are 
concentrated -- Hollywood, Venice, San Pedro and the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"The lack of supply is driving up the prices and we can't take any more," said 
Alice Callaghan, founder of the nonprofit Skid Row Housing Trust, a group that 
renovates flophouses to create attractive studio units for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
The message is much the same from the county Republican Central Committee, 
which voted 76-2 to endorse Proposition K, the only local bond measure it 
endorsed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a detective here in the Rampart Division and I deal with a huge homeless 
population," said party Vice Chairman Robert Thoreson. "I see children sleeping 
in cars with parents, and while I'm not the type of guy who wants government 
getting too much into housing, I feel government, in part, has driven up 
housing costs with regulations and fees. Now government should help resolve 
it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposition K: The Housing Crisis 
</P>
<P>
Rents are skyrocketing in the West, but Los Angeles has borne some of the worst 
increases, with the city's poor paying 50% to 70% of their income on rent. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition K would rehabilitate 6,000 low-income apartments that would 
otherwise be lost to earthquake-safety deficiencies, demolition and 
gentrification. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would cost an average homeowner $4.95 a year in property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles average rents 
</P>
<P>
Compared with other regions of the country, adjusted for inflation and 
expressed in 1988 dollars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nearly 11,000 units housing the city's poorest residents are in brick buildings 
that would become death traps in the event of a severe quake. Although city law 
has required since 1981 that buildings be renovated, many owners cannot afford 
the costly work. Under Proposition K, owners could be bought out and buildings 
fixed. The funds could also be used to maintain lowrents on some of the 26,000 
low-income units in the San Fernando Valley, Venice, Hollywood and San Pedro 
that are under federal rent control due to expire in the 1990s.

BILL BOYARSKY: RETAKING AVALON GARDENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Giving up on the political system doesn't mean giving up. 
</P>
<P>
I got that lesson in persistence this week at Avalon Gardens, a housing project 
in the poorest part of South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The predominantly black residents -- faced with gangs, drugs, poor schools, 
dropouts and unemployment -- have plenty to gripe about. As they see it, they 
have been failed by the police, the courts, the social welfare bureaucracy and 
all the traditional instruments of government. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of the Brotherhood Crusade, which supports a variety of 
self-help, education and health activities in the black community, they have 
launched a movement called Taking Our Neighborhood Back. Its goals: Stop gang 
violence, drug sales and crime. Beautify the community. Make the neighborhood 
safe. And, save the children. 
</P>
<P>
They began with a rally in August, 1989. Avalon Gardens residents marched to a 
nearby park that was controlled by gangs. Gang members were surprised to see 
them. But they caucused in the gym and agreed not to interfere. Avalon Gardens 
is like a small town and the marchers were the gangbangers' neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Today, life's not much better in Avalon Gardens. Economic hard times have hurt. 
</P>
<P>
But the mood wasn't gloomy Wednesday when I attended the first meeting of 
Taking Our Neighborhood Back's new youth leadership project, in a small kitchen 
of the Avalon Gardens apartment that the organization uses as its headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The gathering began with a shout from the kids. "The Batmobile's here." The 
Batmobile is an old, big-fin Cadillac Coupe de Ville. Their Batman wears blue 
sweat pants and a Lakers T-shirt and has a beard tinged with gray. He's 
50-year-old Cliff McClain, the Brotherhood Crusade's representative in Avalon 
Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen boys and girls joined him in the kitchen. They ranged in age from 10 to 
16. He explained he'd picked them because he thought they'd be good leaders. 
"You picked me?" said Michael Smith, 11. 
</P>
<P>
Michael, short, bright-eyed and active, is the kid who drives teachers nuts. He 
restlessly poked and pushed the kids around him. So did some of the others. As 
I watched, I thought this do-good scheme was doomed from the start. 
</P>
<P>
But McClain was patient, talking softly where I would have shouted. "Excuse 
me," he said, when the children interrupted. "This is serious stuff. I won't be 
taking something from you. I'll be giving you something. It doesn't matter to 
me if you don't take it." 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, the tide turned in his favor. Even Michael paused briefly in his poking 
to listen. McClain began his sermon. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people choose to lose," he said. "There are people walking around in the 
project, they've decided to lose, they've just given up. They may be very 
bright. They may have gone to college. It may be drugs. It may be something 
else. But they've just given up." 
</P>
<P>
McClain counts the school system among those he believes have given up. He 
illustrated his point in his dialogue with the kids: "One of the things I want 
to talk to you about is what you want to do for your vocation." He turned to a 
high school student and asked, "What do I mean by vocation." The boy didn't 
know. "I don't want to get on your case," said McClain, "but you're in the 11th 
grade and you should understand everything I'm saying." 
</P>
<P>
McClain is bringing in tutors to make sure the leadership group knows reading, 
writing and mathematics. The tutors also will be role models, mentors. Two of 
them were there that night -- Renaldo Wodley, 23, from the South L.A. Baptist 
Church, and LeAndre Miles, a 21-year-old woman from West L.A. who studies 
nursing and education at Pierce College in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
As the unruliness at the start of the meeting showed, it's not easy to get a 
bunch of teen-agers and preteens interested in self-help. McClain knows that. 
That's why he's got some rewards -- a weekend camping retreat in the Angeles 
National Forest, a trip to Magic Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
There are other problems beyond education that Taking Our Community Back has 
targeted for self-help. Drugs, gangs, unemployment are among them. I don't know 
how all the activity will turn out. Neither does McClain. But there was a lot 
of hopefulness in that kitchen. Read. Write. Speak. Pick a career. If you can't 
beat the political system, go around it. You can't change the world that way, 
or even the city. But you can make life better in Avalon Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
"You can be a nurse like LeAndre, you can be a reporter like Bill over here," 
McClain said, pointing to Miles in the back of the room, and to me, standing by 
the stove. "You can be what you want. Just don't give up."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EDELMAN'S TRY TO RELEASE AIDS MONEY IS 
BLOCKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two conservative members of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors this 
week blocked a proposal to reduce the long waiting period AIDS patients face at 
County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Ed Edelman had proposed that the 22-week waiting period be cut by 
immediately spending $500,000 that was set aside to staff a new AIDS outpatient 
clinic at the hospital next spring. 
</P>
<P>
But supervisors Pete Schabarum and Mike Antonovich opposed the motion, arguing 
that by using the funds now the county would not have the money to hire the 
staff needed at the new clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman, a liberal who has consistently urged his conservative counterparts to 
increase AIDS funding, maintained that "the need is now." But Antonovich and 
Schabarum told Edelman he was counting on federal and state funds that may not 
be forthcoming.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIERRA CLUB CHAPTER ENDORSES FERGUSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reversing its decision to stay out of congressional politics, the area chapter 
of the Sierra Club has decided to support Democrat Anita Perez Ferguson in her 
bid to unseat Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura). 
</P>
<P>
After weeks of holding out, one member of the Sierra Club's Los Padres chapter 
executive board switched positions to provide the pivotal vote in favor of 
Ferguson, said Beverly Full, the chapter's political action chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the chapter's recommended endorsement was forwarded to the Sierra 
Club's national political committee in Washington for ratification. "An 
endorsement is under consideration right now. . . ," said Betsy Loyless, 
assistant political director in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, a Santa Barbara education consultant, said she was "terrifically 
pleased" that the Sierra Club has joined a number of other environmental groups 
endorsing her. "This gives us the right amount of time to get the message out 
that the environmental community supports my candidacy." 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino said he was surprised by the decision of the chapter, which has 
6,000 members in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think they are misinformed or strictly political because I have done 
a heck of a lot for the area," Lagomarsino said. 
</P>
<P>
One major accomplishment that he noted was his role in strengthening air 
pollution controls over diesel generators on offshore oil rigs. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the Sierra Club's decision is shortsighted. "I sit in a very 
important position on the Interior Committee and plan to stay there. We handle 
more environmental legislation than any other committee." 
</P>
<P>
Full said most area Sierra Club leaders decided not to endorse Lagomarsino 
because he has received consistently low marks on a score card of environmental 
votes kept by the League of Conservation Voters. KENNETH R. WEISS

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRM ORDERED TO PRODUCE WORKER SAFETY VIDEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year after one of its employees was killed in a cargo handling accident, a 
Wilmington container company has been ordered to produce a bilingual worker 
safety video in the hope it will help reduce injuries and deaths in one of the 
nation's most dangerous industries. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence, imposed this week in Los Angeles Municipal Court against Martin 
Container Services Inc., is similar to others issued around the country that 
emphasize preventive rather than punitive actions, according to federal safety 
officials and local prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
In the Wilmington case, Martin Container Services was placed on three years' 
probation and ordered to produce the video for the container industry after the 
company pleaded no contest to three violations of the state Labor Code. The 
violations stem from the death on April 28, 1989, of Adrian Sanchez Jacinto, 
21, a welder from Long Beach who was crushed by a 5,000-pound container that 
fell from a forklift.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COURTS DELAY TICKETS FOR MIDEAST MILITARY

<TEXT>
<P>
Military personnel stationed in the Middle East with outstanding citations for 
traffic violations or other misdemeanor crimes will not have to appear in court 
until they return from active duty, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Superior and Municipal courts will allow families of the 
personnel to contact base representatives who will notify the court. 
</P>
<P>
Putting the cases on hold will avoid the cost and inconvenience involved in 
issuing arrest warrants, said Sheila Gonzalez, the courts' executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
Until families begin notifying officials, the court will not be able to 
calculate the actual number of people with outstanding citations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to accommodate them," Gonzalez said. "We don't want them to have 
to worry about their court cases at this time. It's a courtesy." 
</P>
<P>
The program is patterned after a similar one in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not matters of monumental significance," said Municipal Judge Lee E. 
Cooper. "We're talking primarily about traffic violations." KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

TORRES CALLS FOR RENEWED WAR ON GANGS IN EAST L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Flanked by mothers who have lost sons to gang violence, state Sen. Art Torres 
on Thursday called for more money and resources to combat rising gang activity 
in East Los Angeles, where gang experts predict that as many as 30 homicides 
could occur this year, compared to none in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic lawmaker, in whose district the largely impoverished and 
unincorporated Eastside is located, blamed the increased gang activity on the 
diversion of federal, state and local funds and resources to other gang hot 
spots, principally South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But Torres, careful not to stir up the race question when it comes to gangs, 
did not ask that the resources, which have gone to largely black sections of 
South-Central Los Angeles, be returned to the Eastside. Instead, he asked for a 
parity on how moneys are spent. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the homeowner who has a leaky roof or a washing machine that doesn't 
work," he said. "What do you fix first? East Los Angeles is in a crisis with 
gangs." 
</P>
<P>
Torres pointed out that about $4.4 million in gang-prevention funds have been 
allocated since 1982 to South-Central Los Angeles, while the Eastside has 
received roughly half that amount. 
</P>
<P>
That point was emotionally driven home by members of Concerned Parents, a group 
formed 16 years ago as a support group for Eastside residents who have lost 
sons and daughters to gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
"When I read my son's letters when he was in the Marines, I still cry," said 
Margaret Gomez, whose 38-year-old son, Sam Chavez, was killed in a drive-by 
shooting early this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I miss the hugs." 
</P>
<P>
East Los Angeles has been a traditional breeding ground for Chicano gangs, with 
some groups tracing their beginnings to the 1920s and 1930s. When gang-related 
homicides in East Los Angeles reached what was then considered an all-time high 
-- 24 in 1978 -- increased resources and moneys turned the tide to the point 
where no homicides were reported two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Today, with cocaine-fueled gang activity virtually out of control elsewhere, 
much of anti-gang agencies' resources have been diverted. For example, the 
intervention staff of Community Youth Gang Services in the Eastside was cut in 
1988 from 11 to two, partly because it was believed that the area's problem was 
solved. 
</P>
<P>
But last year, 11 gang homicides were recorded in the area -- generally bounded 
by Indiana Avenue on the west, the San Bernardino Freeway on the north, 
Atlantic Boulevard and Garfield Avenue on the east and the Santa Ana Freeway on 
the south. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, 18 gang-related killings have occurred in East Los Angeles. 
An estimated 260 gang-related killings have been recorded in the city of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Torres called on private corporations as well Los Angeles County, the Los 
Angeles Unified School District, the state and other public agencies to finance 
gang-prevention efforts and parenting programs to fight growing gang violence. 
He praised the parenting program offered by the Soledad Enrichment Action 
program, financed by Catholic Charities, as a good way to help parents steer 
sons and daughters from gangs. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he would introduce a measure in January that would set aside 5 
cents from each sale of a gun in California for gang-suppression purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Experts in the gang-prevention field said it was not clear whether a diversion 
of resources back to East Los Angeles is a good idea since some positive 
results in South-Central Los Angeles have been reported. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Valdivia, executive director of the East Los Angeles-based Community 
Youth Gang Services, said increased intervention by his agency in two areas 
targeted by the Los Angeles Police Department -- the 77th Street and southeast 
patrol areas -- has produced a 40% drop in gang-related homicides in the last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"The embers were going in East L.A. but the fire was raging in South-Central, 
so we moved," Valdivia said. "I'm not wanting to make the same mistake (by 
going back to the Eastside). The numbers will come back once we leave. 
</P>
<P>
"I've taken a lot of flak in East L.A., believe me."

BULLETPROOF VEST SALES CURBS SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rookie Downey Police Officer Joel Willis was working the graveyard shift the 
morning of Oct. 9 when the call came across his squad car radio that a robbery 
was in progress at a local discount department store. 
</P>
<P>
Speeding through the darkness, Willis, driving alone, arrived at the PACE 
Membership Warehouse, where he positioned himself to cover the store's front 
door. 
</P>
<P>
Within moments, he recalled, "rounds were flying all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
Willis was shot three times from behind, but spun and emptied his gun in the 
direction of the fire he saw streaming from the gun barrels of his assailants, 
who escaped. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing caught us by surprise," the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
Willis, who has been a police officer for only a year, reticently recounted his 
frightening confrontation with a gang of apparently highly professional 
criminals at a news conference Thursday, during which he called for 
restrictions on the sale of bulletproof vests of the type apparently worn by 
the six gunmen who invaded PACE. 
</P>
<P>
The conference was called by a manufacturer of the vests, Santa Fe 
Springs-based U.S. Armor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the Downey incident, the company said it would seek 
legislation that would severely restrict who could purchase the vests. 
</P>
<P>
"We need it, it's obvious," Willis said, holding a crutch. "They were wearing 
vests and they got away." 
</P>
<P>
Willis was one of two Downey officers wounded in the wild shoot-out with the 
robbers, who were armed with an arsenal of semiautomatic rifles and carried 
two-way radios. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Randy Ewing, 36, is still hospitalized, recovering from his wounds. 
</P>
<P>
One suspect was captured after the attempted robbery, but later released. 
Downey police are still seeking the others, who left behind their weapons and 
thousands of dollars in their hasty escape. 
</P>
<P>
Downey Police Capt. Dennis Chelstrom said investigators are working with other 
law enforcement agencies to determine if there is any connection between the 
sophisticated robbery attempt and others. He declined to elaborate on what, if 
anything, police had uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult for me to say that right now without blowing a whole lot of 
stuff," Chelstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Armor Corp. officials are proposing that the sale of bulletproof vests be 
restricted to police officers, court and probation officials, military 
personnel, private investigators and private armed security guards. The company 
is also calling for a law requiring a three-year mandatory jail sentence for 
anyone who commits an armed felony while wearing body armor. 
</P>
<P>
Bulletproof vests sell from $200 up to $1,500, and can be easily purchased in 
uniform stores. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in business to protect police officers. That's what we do," said 
company president Stephen Armellino. "Having an armed felon, shot by a wounded 
police officer, get up and run away, as may have been the case with Joel, 
cannot be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
The company's efforts are supported by the Police Officer's Research Assn. of 
California. Joe Flannagan, an official of the 35,000-member lobbying 
organization, said the group will press state legislators to act on the issue 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to do is curb the crooks from wearing body armor," 
Flannagan said. ". . . I know we have laws on the books restricting people 
buying guns and this is right along that line." 
</P>
<P>
Willis, who expects to be back at work in two or three months, said he went 
into shock after being wounded and does not remember much of what happened. 
Afterward, he said, he learned that bullets had hit him in the buttocks and a 
hip, while another went through his right arm before being stopped by his vest. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Downey Police Department does not require officers to wear 
vests, Willis, who has been given a new one by U.S. Armor, said it is a matter 
of routine for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I wear my vest every time I wear my uniform," he said.

IT'S AUTUMN -- BUT THE BEACH ISN'T OUT OF REACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
I was meandering along Ocean Front Walk in Venice on Thursday, trying to figure 
out how some people steal a midweek day at the beach -- especially a hot, 
autumn, cliche-of-a-Southern-California day. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on the walkway near where Venice Boulevard dead-ends into the Pacific, I 
spied four teen-age girls from North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, what about school? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the bad one," said a 16-year-old from North Hollywood High School. "I was 
the one who first said, 'C'mon, let's ditch.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was late October, she explained, the sky was baby blue, and temperatures 
were 90-plus. The weather is expected to stay warm through the weekend. But the 
beach-going foursome couldn't wait for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
I approached Todd Pulvino, 28, an engineer from Culver City who said he was 
taking a day off from his job. He worked that out, he said, by telling a 
supervisor the night before that he wanted to relax a bit after coming home 
late from a business trip to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"The nice weather doesn't hurt, either," he said as he unloaded his 1-year-old 
daughter, Christa, from the back seat of his bicycle. He was with his mother, 
Carol Pulvino. The 53-year-old schoolteacher, visiting from Madison, Wis., 
marveled at the opportunity to wear short pants in the late fall. 
</P>
<P>
Not everybody in Pulvino's family made it to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife is a financial analyst," he said. "She had to go to the office at 
about (6:45 a.m.). I think she was calling me a lazy bum when she left." 
</P>
<P>
Then there were others snatching just an hour on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Geier and co-worker James J. Burke, in shirts and ties, sat on the 
basketball court bleachers on Ocean Front Walk eating hot-link sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
"Being inside felt like being in a cave," said Burke, a contracts specialist at 
a Culver City electronics company. "The weather and the cramped feeling made me 
want to get outside." 
</P>
<P>
Geier, whose tie remained snug around his collar, said: "I've been working in 
Culver City for about six years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time I've actually gone out and had lunch at the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Then there was Mike Blumenthal, a wholesale candy and tobacco distributor who 
didn't have time to take lunch. Armed with a clipboard binder, stuffed with 
yellow invoice forms and accompanying carbon copies, he said he had a dozen 
stops to make at shops along the walkway. 
</P>
<P>
His determined stride relaxed a bit when I asked if he ever took time off from 
his rounds to enjoy a balmy day. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I don't think that I work any less if the weather is good," he said, 
implying that he was no slacker. "Let's just put it this way: If the day is 
nice, I walk a little slower." 
</P>
<P>
OK, OK, I thought, knowing that my time at the beach was just about up. Even 
though I knew I had to go back to the office, I walked a little slower too.

SACRIFICING AIR QUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I like the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area. The facilities never seem 
too crowded and it's usually a pleasant afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
I probably hike in one of the park units, with my family, four or five times a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
However, my family and I breathe the air in the Conejo Valley. We face the 
gridlock on our roads. The thought of sacrificing our air quality and quiet 
lifestyle for a few more acres of parkland is frightening. What is the point of 
having parkland with Stage 1 smog alerts? 
</P>
<P>
I do not support the Bob Hope, developer-motivated, land swap.

'WANNA-BE BIRDS' ARE BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stand back, voters! Here come the "wanna-be birds" again. Like swallows 
returning to Capistrano, these birds appear regularly, but only at election 
time. 
</P>
<P>
With loud crowing and squawking, they promise to cure all of our many problems, 
be they fiscal, social, foreign, domestic or imaginary. Wanna-be birds are 
especially adept at curing imaginary problems. 
</P>
<P>
Forget that these birds have done nothing of much importance to date. Just give 
them a chance and they will solve the world. 
</P>
<P>
Are you willing to risk your vote on any of these ambitious pretenders? 
</P>
<P>
I'll wait patiently until these birds have finished their puffing and 
posturing. Then I'll vote for the competent, dedicated and proven legislators 
we have in this area. 
</P>
<P>
Congressman Elton Gallegly in the 21st Congressional District is such a 
legislator. Or if you are in the 19th Congressional District, Congressman Bob 
Lagomarsino is also an outstanding representative. Assemblyman Tom McClintock 
in the 36th Assembly District is another fine legislator. 
</P>
<P>
They don't puff and strut and crow. They are much too busy just doing 
outstanding jobs, representing the people of Ventura County.

COUNCILMAN ISSUES APOLOGY FOR ARREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura City Councilman James Monahan on Thursday apologized "if I have caused 
any embarrassment to the city or my constituents," in his first public 
statement since he was arrested early Wednesday for allegedly driving under the 
influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, councilmen are people too, and they make mistakes," Monahan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Monahan was arrested at 1:28 a.m. Wednesday while headed south on the Ventura 
Freeway near South Rose Avenue after a California Highway Patrol officer 
noticed that the councilman's car was "swerving back and forth between the lane 
and the right shoulder," CHP spokesman Brian DeMattia said. 
</P>
<P>
Monahan said the incident took place while he was driving toward a home he owns 
in Camarillo after working at his office and eating dinner at Carrow's 
restaurant on California Street. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Monahan had spent the day at a League of California Cities 
conference in Anaheim, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Upon returning to Ventura that evening, he learned that a close friend had died 
and headed toward The King and I restaurant on East Main Street in Ventura to 
meet with and console the widow and her relatives, Monahan said. 
</P>
<P>
At the restaurant, he ordered one vodka and soda and a second drink was sent to 
him by a friend, he said. About 9:30 p.m., he left the restaurant and went to 
work at his Ventura office. After stopping at the Carrow's restaurant for a 
late meal and two cups of coffee, he got on the freeway and headed home, 
Monahan said. 
</P>
<P>
Monahan said a preliminary alcohol level test taken at the scene showed he was 
0.01% above the state's legal limit for drivers of 0.08%. DeMattia confirmed 
that a preliminary breath test was conducted, but said he did not know the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
DeMattia said that a urine test was also conducted and that results of that 
test -- which has far more legal weight than the preliminary test -- will be 
available in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Monahan said he made an error of judgment in assessing his condition before 
deciding to drive and added that a series of unforeseen circumstances 
contributed to his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
First, he said, he would have never been drinking had it not been for the news 
of his friend passing away. "It was a shock to me," Monahan said. Also, Monahan 
said, he was driving his newly acquired 1984 Cadillac, which has a much tighter 
steering system than the car he previously owned. 
</P>
<P>
His unfamiliarity with the vehicle, Monahan said, made it more difficult for 
him to keep it in a straight line. "It just feels like a different car," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, when he noticed the patrol car behind him, Monahan reached down to 
readjust his seat belt and at that moment his car swerved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel embarrassed about the whole thing," he said. "I don't drink and drive. 
I just misjudged the situation. I didn't think there was so much alcohol in my 
system." SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

TRIAL: A CONVICTED MONEY LAUNDERER TESTIFIES THAT SHERIFF'S NARCOTICS OFFICERS 
STOLE $65,000 AND ABUSED HIM WHILE HE WAS HANDCUFFED DURING A 1988 DRUG RAID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A convicted money launderer who claims Los Angeles County sheriff's narcotics 
officers stole $65,000 from him testified Thursday that deputies beat him while 
he was handcuffed and one officer placed a revolver to his head in a mock 
execution during a 1988 drug raid. 
</P>
<P>
Arturo Rojas Zavala, 22, told a Los Angeles federal court jury that deputies 
Terrell H. Amers and Eufrasio G. Cortez -- who are on trial with five other 
sheriff's officers for alleged money-skimming -- roughed him up after he was 
stopped by members of their narcotics investigation team. 
</P>
<P>
Rojas, who used the alias Carlos Luis Soto, testified that the deputies had 
taken him back to his West Covina motel, where he was beaten while handcuffed 
for reportedly refusing to give officers the combination to his locked 
briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
"They put me on top of the bed, put a pillow on my back and Amers got on top of 
me and hit me," Rojas said in Spanish while pointing to his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
Rojas, through an interpreter, said he was pummeled by Amers and then kicked in 
the face by an unidentified deputy before he was taken from the room. When he 
refused to sign a disclaimer form disowning $200,000 found in his pickup truck, 
Rojas said Cortez socked him in the stomach before he finally signed the 
document that allowed the deputies to seize his cash. Rojas said he later 
learned that only $135,000 of the money was turned in to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Rojas, who pleaded guilty to a money-laundering charge, said the cash was 
earmarked for a cocaine deal. And he acknowledged that he worked for a Mexican 
drug ring that had stored 311 kilos of cocaine in a nearby warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
But as he was being driven to that warehouse by Amers, the deputy "took his gun 
out and put it up to my head . . . and looked like he was going to fire it," 
Rojas testified. "Then he took it away." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for both Amers and Cortez declined comment on Rojas' testimony, 
citing a gag order imposed this week by U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie. 
</P>
<P>
But in cross-examining Rojas, Cortez's attorney, James Riddet, suggested that 
the drug dealer had lied about the beatings and was cooperating with federal 
prosecutors after his prison sentence had been reduced from a maximum of nine 
years to two years. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another admitted drug dealer claimed in testimony Thursday that the 
defendants had stolen $70,000 during a 1988 raid at his Wilmington duplex. But 
when asked if he could identify any of the deputies, the man pointed to a 
defense attorney and one defendant -- Macario M. Duran -- who was not at the 
raid. 
</P>
<P>
The other defendants include Ronald E. Daub, Daniel M. Garner, James R. Bauder 
and John C. Dickenson. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the drug dealers, prosecutors Thursday called a string of 
witnesses to show that some of the deputies had paid thousands of dollars -- 
much of it in cash -- for vacation homes, satellite dishes, furniture, boats, 
helicopter flying lessons and a share in a race horse. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Earl Harp, a real estate agent from Bullhead City, Ariz., testified that 
Cortez made a $5,000 deposit in cash for some property near the Colorado River. 
"We were in the garage because the wind was blowing, and it was hard to hold 
onto the money," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
When questioned by Cortez's attorney, however, Hart acknowledged that there was 
nothing illegal about paying in cash and that the deputy never tried to conceal 
his ownership or method of payment. 
</P>
<P>
A witness subpoenaed by the government to testify against Amers sparked a 
heated moment in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Virgil Bartlett, who prosecutors said is "a subject of the federal 
corruption investigation," told jurors that he had sold his 19-foot boat to 
Amers for $18,000 in cash and acknowledged that the government had agreed not 
to prosecute him for any statement he made in court. 
</P>
<P>
But when Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas A. Hagemann routinely asked Bartlett if 
the government had made any other promises, Bartlett shot back: "More threats 
than promises." 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination by defense attorneys, Bartlett claimed that Hagemann 
had threatened to take him before the grand jury unless he testified against 
Amers -- an assertion that was challenged by the prosecutor.

MAN ADMITS ATTACKING WOMAN AND DAUGHTER; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE TWO-DAY SPREE OF KIDNAPING AND VIOLENCE BEGAN IN PORT HUENEME AND 
ENDED AT A LAS VEGAS CAR DEALERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A Port Hueneme man charged with kidnaping, battering and sexually assaulting a 
woman and her 7-year-old daughter pleaded guilty Thursday to avoid risking a 
stiffer prison sentence and dragging the victims through a trial, his attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Justo Dungca, 34, admitted his role in the rampage of July 19 and 20 because he 
feared being sentenced to more than the 30 years he now faces and because he 
wanted to spare the victims from testifying, Deputy Public Defender William 
Perryman said. 
</P>
<P>
Dungca admitted prosecutors' allegations that he sexually assaulted the mother 
and child, bundled them into a car to drive them to Orange County, then drove 
the girl to Las Vegas after her mother escaped. When Las Vegas police finally 
closed in, he banged the girl's head on the floor of a car dealership. 
</P>
<P>
Dungca went on the spree of violence because "he became very, very emotionally 
distraught over the loss of his girlfriend and somehow or other felt that in 
some way the victims were partly responsible for that," Perryman said Thursday 
after Dungca's plea. 
</P>
<P>
But the victims apparently played no role in the breakup of Dungca and his 
girlfriend two weeks before the incident, Perryman said. Dungca has no known 
prior criminal record and never showed signs of instability, Perryman said. "At 
that time, his emotional state was such that he wasn't viewing things in the 
proper perspective and he just kind of went off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Vincent J. O'Neill Jr. said there were indications that 
Dungca drove the mother and child to Orange County because he wanted to see his 
former girlfriend, but there was no explanation for the violence, O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
Dungca was captured July 20 after he tried to trade in the mother's 1986 Toyota 
Camry for a Mustang and $1,000 cash at a Las Vegas car dealership, O'Neill 
said. When the car dealers noticed that his name was not on the Toyota's title, 
they called the California Department of Motor Vehicles. The DMV contacted 
police when an all-points bulletin about the kidnapings appeared in their 
computers, O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
As police closed in, Dungca laced his fingers in the girl's hair and banged her 
head on the floor several times before they could stop him, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Dungca appeared late Thursday afternoon before Ventura County Superior Court 
Judge Kenneth R. Yegan after negotiating his plea for at least two weeks with 
his attorney and O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the promise that he would receive a 30-year sentence and be 
eligible for parole by the year 2005, Dungca admitted to two counts of 
kidnaping and one count each of committing a forcible lewd act on a child, 
sexual battery by restraint and false imprisonment of a hostage. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also agreed to drop two counts of sexual battery in connection with 
assaults on the mother, one count of child molestation and one count of 
attempted murder. And Clark County, Nev., police have agreed not to prosecute 
Dungca with the understanding that he would plead guilty in Ventura County, 
O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 21.

ASSEMBLY: 35TH DISTRICT;

<P>
QUESTIONNAIRES WERE DISTRIBUTED TO CANDIDATES AND RETURNED THIS MONTH. ANSWERS 
LONGER THAN SPACE ALLOTTED HAVE BEEN EDITED TO FIT THE AVAILABLE SPACE.

<P>
Family Sick Leave 
</P>
<P>
Q. Gov. Deukmejian recently vetoed legislation that would have granted workers 
as much as four months of unpaid leave every two years to care for sick 
children, spouses and other family members without fear of losing their jobs. 
Do you favor this type of legislation? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell: I supported the recent bill that would require family leave for 
larger employers of 25 or more people. 
</P>
<P>
O'Shaughnessy: No. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teacher Salaries 
</P>
<P>
Q. The Legislature approved a 4.7% cost-of-living raise for school employees, 
and Gov. Deukmejian reduced it to 3%, placing the difference in an account for 
special education programs. Should this money be used for salaries? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell: As the voters dictated when they passed Proposition 98, the full 
4.7% COLA should go to school districts, so that those local districts can 
spend funds according to their own localized priorities. 
</P>
<P>
O'Shaughnessy: Yes. Teachers are still underpaid, and special programs now are 
so numerous that they get in the way of the basics. Current graduates are not 
as well versed in the basics as they should be. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Green 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 128, the so-called "Big Green" initiative on the November 
ballot, seeks to eliminate ozone-depleting chemicals by the year 2000, phase 
out pesticides known to cause cancer and require that trees be planted in all 
new developments. Do you support this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell: Yes. While it is not a perfect piece of legislation, it is an 
ambitious attempt at setting comprehensive environmental policy for California. 
</P>
<P>
O'Shaughnessy: No. The bill tries to do too much with too few financial 
resources. Also, it is unclear what the full cost will be, and how it is to be 
fully covered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tree-Cutting 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 130 on the November ballot would restrict clear-cutting of 
forests, allow the sale of $710 million in bonds to preserve ancient redwood 
forests and provide $32 million to retrain unemployed loggers. Do you support 
this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
O'Shaughnessy: No. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited Terms 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 131 on the November ballot, authored by Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp and Common Cause, would limit most statewide elected officials to eight 
consecutive years in office, and senators and Assembly members to 12 years. 
Proposition 140, sponsored by Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, is 
more stringent, limiting lifetime service to eight years in the Senate and six 
in the Assembly. Do you support limiting the number of terms state legislators 
can serve? If yes, how long should the limits be? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell: No. I agree with former President Reagan that all voters should 
continue to have the option to support whomever they believe is best 
representing their interests. 
</P>
<P>
O'Shaughnessy: Yes. I agree with 140, with limits of eight and six years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sales Tax 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 133 on the November ballot would raise state sales and use taxes 
by 0.5% for four years to raise $7.5 billion for drug enforcement and 
treatment, anti-drug education, and prison and jail construction and operation. 
Do you support this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
O'Shaughnessy: No. I am against all new taxes. The objective is noble, but 
there is so much fiscal waste in Sacramento that eliminating the waste would 
pay for it. If addicts can afford drugs, they can afford treatment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Liquor Tax 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 134 on the November ballot would substantially raise taxes on 
beer, wine and liquor, and dedicate the revenue from the tax hike to programs 
for the treatment of drug and alcohol abuse. Do you support this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
O'Shaughnessy: No. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inmate Laborers 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 139 on the November ballot would allow private companies to hire 
state prison and county jail inmates as laborers. Do you support this 
initiative? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell: No. I supported a more equitable and moderate prison workfare 
measure in the Legislature last session. Proposition 139 is not the best 
approach because it allows prisoners to work off-site, creating potential 
security and public safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
O'Shaughnessy: Yes, assuming half the compensation would go to defray the costs 
of running the prisons and jails. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Death Penalty 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support capital punishment? If so, do you think it should be imposed 
on those convicted of importing or selling drugs? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell: Yes, I support capital punishment. I support the death penalty for 
drug dealers when it involves the biggest kingpins of the drug underworld, who 
should be held directly responsible for causing so much pain and anguish as a 
result of peddling their deadly wares. 
</P>
<P>
O'Shaughnessy: Yes, I support capital punishment. Yes, I support capital 
punishment for importers and sellers of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handgun Controls 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support additional limits on handgun purchase or possession in 
California? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell: The Legislature and the governor last year successfully beat back 
the gun lobby to pass landmark gun control measures -- an effort that resulted 
in unsuccessful recall attempts being launched against me and some of my 
colleagues. I believe the Legislature should now take some time to properly 
review and evaluate the effectiveness of those measures. 
</P>
<P>
O'Shaughnessy: No. The current laws are not being enforced now. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Abortion Rights 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support a woman's right to unrestricted abortions within the first 
three months of pregnancy? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
O'Shaughnessy: Yes. This is not even an issue for government to be concerned 
about, in my opinion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Abortion Funding 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support government funding of abortions for women who cannot afford 
them? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
O'Shaughnessy: Partial funding: 50%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Day-Care Services 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe the state should require private employers to subsidize 
day-care services for employees who request them? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell: I have supported, and will continue to support, measures designed to 
provide incentives for employers to provide child care. This is in the best 
long-term interests of the businesses involved because employer-sponsored child 
care has been shown to increase employee morale and productivity, as well as 
reduce absenteeism. 
</P>
<P>
O'Shaughnessy: No. A private employer is a private employer. However, some 
consideration should be given to employers for this. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
War on Drugs 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe our present strategy of criminal prosecution, interdiction of 
supplies and imprisonment of users and dealers will ever significantly reduce 
the level of drug use in the United States? If no, what should be done? 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell: Yes. But I would add the strong argument that we all must strive to 
educate our youth about the perils of drugs in order to reduce the demand for 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
O'Shaughnessy: No. We need more enforcement. We need much more anti-drug 
education. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drug Decriminalization 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would you consider supporting the decriminalization of drug use? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell: No. 
</P>
<P>
O'Shaughnessy: No. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oil Exploration 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think the present Mideast crisis justifies opening up additional 
parts of the California coastline to oil exploration? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell: No. The small amount of oil available, as well as the fragile nature 
of the California coastline, does not make this source a viable alternative to 
disrupted Mideast oil. Instead, the U.S. needs a comprehensive national energy 
policy to best utilize present resources as well to develop new sources of 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
O'Shaughnessy: Yes. Our oil business is in shambles, thanks to importation of 
too much foreign oil. Let's restrict imports, as we have the second biggest oil 
facility ready to operate, at Point Arguello, but is hamstrung due to Mickey 
Mouse-style environmental trifles. Alternative fuels research is fine for the 
long term, but we need oil now, not blackmail in the East. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parkland Exchange 
</P>
<P>
Q. Should the National Park Service exchange 50 acres in Cheeseboro Canyon in 
southeastern Ventura County for about 1,100 acres of the neighboring Jordan 
Ranch owned by entertainer Bob Hope, permitting park agencies to buy another 
4,600 acres of Hope's land in the Santa Monica and Santa Susana mountains for 
$10 million? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell: This is an issue of local control best decided at the local level, 
and I will oppose any effort at preemption by the state. 
</P>
<P>
O'Shaughnessy: Yes, but don't raise taxes to do it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mandatory Ride-Sharing 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you favor mandatory ride-sharing in an effort to meet government air 
pollution standards? 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell: Pollution caused by automobiles necessitates our looking at ways to 
reduce their use. We must look to enhanced ride-sharing incentives (private and 
public), and to mass transit to help break our dependence on the automobile. 
</P>
<P>
O'Shaughnessy: No. The real problem is underpromotion. Make it enticing and 
people will ride-share. Use positive incentives. Mandates irritate voters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Funding 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support full or partial public funding of political campaigns? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell: In order to level the playing field for all potential political 
candidates, and to remove any questions of impropriety, at least partial public 
funding, coupled with spending limits, should be available. 
</P>
<P>
O'Shaughnessy: Yes, provided it were on a matching basis: raise so much, get so 
much. The public funding must be limited to amounts paid into a special fund by 
taxpayers on a voluntary basis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Income Disclosure 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are you willing to publicly release your income tax returns and those of 
your spouse prior to the November election? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
O'Shaughnessy: Yes, subject to confidentiality controls, and my opponent's 
willingness to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
Water Pipeline 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support a new pipeline linking Ventura County to the state water 
system that brings water from Northern California? 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell: While much of Ventura County is already connected to state water, I 
support other local purveyors' rights to connect to state water if local 
citizens decide that is most desirable. 
</P>
<P>
O'Shaughnessy: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drug Users' Tent City 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support the Ventura County sheriff's proposal to incarcerate 
"recreational" drug users in a tent city on an area Navy base and require them 
to attend extensive counseling, drug-education sessions and monthly drug 
testing? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell: I believe we must make every effort to convince the casual drug 
user, as well as the drug dealer, to stay away from drugs. 
</P>
<P>
O'Shaughnessy: Yes.

<P>
As truck driver Dave Brown, 32, lined up to apply for jobless benefits at a San 
Diego unemployment office one day last week, the cross-country food hauler 
looked uncomfortably around the quiet room. 
</P>
<P>
"This is such a terrible feeling," said Brown, who lost his job earlier this 
month, leaving him out of work for the first time since he started earning a 
living 12 years ago. "I'm about as close to the economy as a lay person gets, 
and I think something bad is going to happen soon." 
</P>
<P>
For Brown and thousands of other Southern Californians caught in the rising 
tide of unemployment, something bad is already happening. 
</P>
<P>
After creeping upward all summer long, jobless rates jumped in September in all 
six Southern California counties except Los Angeles, according to figures 
released Thursday by the state Economic Development Department. Though the 
unemployment level in Los Angeles County fell to 6.1% from 6.6% in August, it 
-- like the other counties' -- was higher than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Most troubling is that fundamental segments of the economy that seemed healthy 
until recently -- manufacturing, services and transportation -- now are 
faltering as an eight-year economic expansion loses steam. 
</P>
<P>
And the outlook is none too bright: Observers from Oxnard to San Diego see the 
job picture worsening over the next 12 months as the nation slides into a 
recession that would only deepen if oil prices continue to escalate or if war 
breaks out in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing brings home the reality of bad economic times like the loss of a job. 
And recent visits to area unemployment offices found anxious, pessimistic job 
seekers, acutely aware it was not a good moment to be looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm seriously thinking of moving East, away from the Coast, to find cheaper 
rents," said Tami Cunningham, 28, who was laid off earlier this month by an El 
Toro travel agency only a week after being hired as manager. "Things are just 
slowing up," Cunningham said during a wait at the Santa Ana office of the state 
Employment Development Department. "My roommate's out of work. "My next door 
neighbor's out of work." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Smith, a design technician laid off a month ago by a San Diego marine 
engineering firm, said he may have to change professions to get back to work. 
</P>
<P>
With the slowing of growth in defense spending, Smith, 38, had watched his 
department shrink from 34 workers to three in the space of six months. But 
Smith -- a married father of two with savings enough for just one more mortgage 
payment -- held on "to the bitter end," getting his walking papers after his 
firm's final naval repair contract expired. 
</P>
<P>
"Others saw the writing on the wall but I kept hoping some new contract would 
come along," he said during an interview at a San Diego unemployment office. 
"Nothing shook loose, and so here I am." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Severn, 24, knows he lost his job this month at the Mandalay Beach Resort 
in Oxnard because the tourist trade had precipitously declined. What frustrates 
the Camarillo man, the hotel's food and beverage room-service manager for 16 
months, is the unsettling sense that he is a victim of economic forces beyond 
his control. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I'm not sure where the economy's going. You hear so much about Saudi 
Arabia and the recession," said Severn, interviewed at the Oxnard unemployment 
office. "What I'd really like to do is finish my final year at UCLA. But I was 
a history major. I'd probably have to change that if I want to make myself 
employable." 
</P>
<P>
Economists note that unemployment rates in California and nationwide, at 5.8% 
and 5.7% respectively, do not approach the worst levels seen during the 1981-82 
recession, when joblessness exceeded 11%. Many experts are hopeful the current 
slowdown will be relatively mild -- some believe a recession can be avoided 
altogether -- and that employment trends will not deteriorate much further. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the gloom is far from universal in the job market. Certain kinds of 
jobs continue to be created in abundance in the region, especially in fields 
that ride the tide of Southern California's population growth, from accountants 
to dry cleaners, janitors to retail clerks. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, even some industrial sectors have added jobs this year, notably 
food processing and distribution, petroleum manufacturing and air 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
But the seepage of job losses beyond the industries that had been suffering in 
California for a year or more -- beyond the collapsing savings and loans, the 
overbuilt housing market, the belt-tightening aerospace companies -- is, 
undeniably, troubling. 
</P>
<P>
"People in the companies we deal with feel less confident," said Philip Bohan, 
economic development manager of the Ventura County Job Training Council, a 
nonprofit group that trains and places economically disadvantaged workers under 
the federal Job Training Partnership Act. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a reduction in anticipated new hires for truck drivers, shipping and 
receiving people, food services, light manufacturing," Bohan said. "In the last 
couple of months, the job orders are down about 30% compared to the same period 
a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing layoffs have hit throughout the region. In Oxnard, Raytheon 
recently shuttered a defense electronics plant employing 400. In Santa Ana, 
A&amp;E Systems, which makes awnings and other equipment for recreational 
vehicles, closed down in August, laying off another 400. In Los Angeles, Orange 
and San Diego counties, there were fewer manufacturing jobs in August, the last 
month for which such data are available, than a year before. 
</P>
<P>
George Lopez, 43, interviewed at the Oxnard unemployment office, had worked 
three years as an assembler at Everest &amp; Jennings, the Camarillo-based 
wheelchair manufacturer, when he was laid off in December. Since then, he says, 
he has been unable to find a job at which he would earn enough to support his 
wife and three children, including a newborn. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some jobs around, but nobody wants to pay anything," said Lopez. "I 
figure I need to make at least $7.50 to $8 (per) hour if we're going to live at 
all comfortably. But nobody wants to pay more than $5.50 or $6. I'd like to see 
them support a family on that." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, job hunters throughout the region have fewer and fewer options. 
Help-wanted advertising, considered a key indicator of hiring, has been 
declining at all the area's major newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
For the 13 weeks ended Oct. 7, employment advertising linage in The Times was 
down 25% compared to the same period last year. The Orange County Register said 
its September help-wanted ads were off 25% from the same month in 1989. The San 
Diego Union reported a 13% drop in help-wanted ads on a year-to-date basis. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting worried," said Manuel Hernandez, 28, who has been looking for work 
for three months since he quit his job as a busboy at a downtown Los Angeles 
restaurant rather than take a cut in his already low pay. "I'm looking, but I 
can't find anything." 
</P>
<P>
Jobs in construction -- a bellwether industry that grows and contracts with the 
economy as a whole -- have been dwindling all year. Statewide, 24,000 jobs have 
been lost since February, according to the Construction Industry Research Board 
in Burbank, and another 60,000 -- fully 10% -- are likely to disappear over the 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Housing is completely shot down. Construction is real slow," said Roland 
McReynolds, an out-of-work plumber seeking benefits at the Santa Ana 
unemployment office. During good times, McReynolds said he typically goes two 
weeks between jobs. But he now has been unemployed since the end of July. 
</P>
<P>
While others waiting in line had their newspapers open to the help-wanted 
section, McReynolds scanned his for word of new housing developments. He has 
made his living installing plumbing in new homes for 25 years, the last eight 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But work has never been harder to come by, he said. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 150 additional members of his union, Pipefitters Local 582 in 
Santa Ana, also looking for work, McReynolds said. Demand for heating and 
air-conditioning installers is about as low as for plumbers. 
</P>
<P>
White-collar workers are not immune to the downturn. 
</P>
<P>
Standing out amid a sea of faded blue jeans and T-shirts at the unemployment 
office in Escondido was Craig Lenberg, 40, an out-of-work mortgage banker 
dressed in a gray suit and tortoise-shell glasses. He is one of 122 Great 
American Bank employees statewide who have lost their jobs since mid-summer. 
</P>
<P>
Lenberg, who formerly earned a salary of $70,000, says he is still optimistic 
about his job prospects. But after two frustrating months looking for work, he 
said he soon may be putting his house in Poway on the market, swimming pool and 
all. 
</P>
<P>
An unemployment check of $190 per week, said Lenberg, "doesn't quite cover the 
bills."

U.S. WILL INCREASE TROOPS IN ARABIA BY UP TO 100,000; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: CHENEY LINKS THE BUILDUP TO EXPANDED IRAQI FORCES IN AND NEAR 
KUWAIT. EMPHASIS IS EXPECTED TO BE ON BRINGING IN HEAVY ARMOR FROM EUROPE.

<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Thursday that he may send as many as 100,000 
more troops to join the 210,000 American personnel already deployed in Saudi 
Arabia to counter an expanded and increasingly fortified Iraqi force. 
</P>
<P>
A major element of the buildup is expected to be heavy armor units, many of 
them likely to be rotated from Europe, to match up against a huge force of 
Iraqi tanks now in defensive positions in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not at the point yet where we want to stop adding forces," Cheney said 
in a series of interviews on the four television networks. He linked the 
expected American buildup to the growth of Iraq's force in and near Kuwait, now 
numbering more than 430,000. "We've never set an upper limit" on the U.S. 
contingent, he declared. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney and military analysts have said that the troops already in place are 
adequate to defend Saudi Arabia, but the defense secretary avoided linking the 
buildup to any U.S. plans for offensive action against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"Our mission is today . . . to deter further aggression, to defend Saudi Arabia 
and enforce the sanctions," Cheney said. "We also have the capability, 
obviously, to give the President a range of other options should another option 
be necessary. And we haven't ruled out other options." 
</P>
<P>
He also warned that the increasing pinch of economic sanctions may prompt Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein to lash out militarily at Saudi Arabia or at Israel 
before shortages of tires, spare parts and fuel sap his forces. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to continued "aggression" against Kuwait, such actions would 
constitute provocations that would leave the United States and its allies "no 
choice but to respond," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
He also addressed, for the first time publicly, the issue of potential 
casualties, which has become a sensitive factor in the Bush Administration's 
decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
"No one should underestimate the cost of conflict," Cheney warned. "No one 
should assume that such a conflict would be cheap or easy." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's comments appear to reflect a growing consensus within the Bush 
Administration that nothing short of a military offensive will budge Iraqi 
troops from their trenches. Echoing an assessment Thursday by CIA Director 
William H. Webster, Cheney said that Saddam Hussein "gives no indication 
whatsoever, in spite of the public talk . . . that he has any indication of 
withdrawing from Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary of State James A. Baker III was considering a trip to 
Saudi Arabia, other Persian Gulf states and Europe, perhaps as early as next 
week, to shore up the multinational alliance against Iraq, a senior State 
Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
United Press International reported that Baker's purpose would be to seek Saudi 
approval for offensive military action if the trade embargo does not force Iraq 
to pull out of Kuwait. However, the State Department official said he was 
unaware of such a purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Saudi government's official public position is to oppose the use 
of its territory for offensive military action, Saudi officials are known to 
have told Baker and other American officials in private that they would support 
the use of force if sanctions fail to work. 
</P>
<P>
Baker is spending a long weekend at his ranch in Wyoming. Cheney plans to join 
him there, ostensibly to go fishing. The senior State Department official said 
that Baker is not expected to make a final decision to travel to the gulf until 
early next week. 
</P>
<P>
The possible deployment of more troops probably would occur simultaneously with 
a plan to replace some American personnel already in Saudi Arabia with fresh 
troops from the United States and Europe. The rotation and expansion would take 
months to complete, Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In early January, the elite 82nd Airborne Division may be withdrawn from Saudi 
Arabia, Cheney said. The lightly armed division of paratroopers was the first 
ground unit to arrive in Saudi Arabia, and Cheney said that it could be 
replaced with a more heavily armed tank or infantry division. 
</P>
<P>
Decisions on which new units to send to Saudi Arabia and how to enlarge the 
force are expected to come early next week after meetings in Saudi Arabia this 
week between Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and 
Lt. Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of Operation Desert Shield 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
The diversion of substantial U.S. Army forces from Western Europe to Saudi 
Arabia would remain a politically sensitive move even though East-West tensions 
in Europe have eased and calls for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the 
continent have increased. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has a little more than 200,000 troops based in Germany. 
Cheney said armored and infantry divisions -- the kinds now based in Germany -- 
"are the most useful forces" to face a heavily armed tank force of the type 
that Iraq has fielded in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the kinds of forces we like to have in the area and we may well send 
more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to budget pressures and political changes in Europe, Congress has 
directed the Pentagon to withdraw 50,000 U.S. troops from Western Europe this 
year. Cheney said that "we might simply transfer some of those to Saudi 
Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon analysts said that option would be cheaper and faster than dispatching 
such forces from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Pentagon sources cautioned that it could take months before the new 
ground troops could be in place with their equipment, even if they came from 
Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said that in drafting their rotation plans, the military 
services have ruled out the use of combat forces from the National Guard and 
Reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Without congressional authorization extending the length of time that the 
President can call reserve troops, Cheney does not want to use the 10 National 
Guard Army divisions based in the United States.

SOARING DEFICIT LURKS IN WINGS FOR NEW GOVERNOR

<TEXT>
<P>
It's the issue neither gubernatorial candidate wants to talk much about, but it 
is likely to dominate the new governor's first months in office: a growing 
state budget deficit that is soaring past $1 billion and could go considerably 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
State fiscal experts say California's dreary financial situation is getting 
worse every day and threatens to overwhelm some of the campaign pledges 
advanced by both Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republican Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
With the economy lagging, state revenues have fallen $138 million short of 
forecast levels for the first three months of this fiscal year, the legislative 
analyst's office reported this week. A business recession would give state 
government a double whammy -- a decline in tax receipts and an increase in 
welfare and other costs that increase in bad economic times. 
</P>
<P>
Even before that report, the analyst's office had estimated that the new 
governor's first budget would be out of balance by nearly $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The deficit would grow even larger if the California economy continues to 
weaken and if voters approve any of a number of Nov. 6 ballot measures that 
would tie up future tax revenue and require additional spending on new 
programs. Some Sacramento sources say the prospective deficit for next year 
already is approaching an estimated $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Having a balanced budget by July 1 -- the first for the new governor -- would 
require either major cuts in spending, higher taxes or a combination of both. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and Feinstein have talked about convening sessions immediately after the 
election to begin grappling with the potential deficit. Both have proposed 
general budget reforms that would free them of some of the restrictions written 
into state law and the Constitution over the last three decades. As a result of 
these restrictions, at least 85% of the state budget -- more than 90%, Gov. 
George Deukmejian contends -- is funneled into specific programs beyond the 
control of the Legislature and governor. 
</P>
<P>
But Thomas J. Dooley, the chief deputy legislative analyst, said that any hope 
of achieving far-reaching reforms by the start of the next fiscal year is 
illusory at best. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein and Wilson have been reluctant to address the state's fiscal problems 
in detail because that could involve talking about new taxes. Political experts 
say both may want to avoid the tangled trap of endorsing tax increases, which 
has doomed many a candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has refused to rule out a tax increase, but has opposed any change in 
state income tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said she would avoid higher taxes until all other budget savings have 
been tried. Then, she said, she would favor restoration of the 11% bracket for 
those earning $200,000 a year or more. The top bracket is now 9.3%. Feinstein 
has argued that tax reforms of recent years unfairly favored the wealthiest 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Steven A. Merksamer, who headed Deukmejian's transition team in 1982, said the 
new chief executive must be prepared to move on the budget crisis immediately 
if there is any hope of correcting the flaws in the system that are pushing 
spending up faster than the tax revenues can rise to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
Merksamer, who was Deukmejian's first chief of staff, said in an interview that 
the structural problems that underlie the deficit go back almost 30 years, and 
that resolving them could occupy as much as 90% of the chief executive's time 
in the early months of the new administration. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a massive undertaking," Merksamer said. "How the governor 
handles it in the first four months will set the course for (the 
administration) for the next four years. It did for George Deukmejian." 
</P>
<P>
But Merksamer said the fiscal situation facing Wilson or Feinstein will be even 
worse than the one that greeted Deukmejian. With a freeze on all spending, the 
state took two years to grow out of the $1.5-billion deficit that Deukmejian 
inherited. 
</P>
<P>
That no longer is possible, Merksamer said, because spending has been cut to 
the core since 1983 and billions of dollars in additional expenditures have 
been earmarked by voter initiatives in subsequent elections. This would give 
the new governor and Legislature even less latitude to target scarce fiscal 
resources to the state's most pressing priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say a recent initiative with the broadest effect on the budget was 
Proposition 98, a 1988 measure that requires about 42% of the state's General 
Fund go to public schools. Of the roughly $47 billion needed in 1991-92 to 
maintain present programs at existing levels, nearly $19 billion would be 
guaranteed for public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein has pledged to uphold Proposition 98. Wilson has said that all state 
spending, including that for education, should be on the table when he attempts 
to negotiate a solution to the budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Deukmejian first learned of the magnitude of the impending budget 
shortfall in briefings conducted for both campaigns several months before the 
election, Merksamer said. Deukmejian announced his appointment of a chief of 
staff and finance director the day after the election, allowing them to get to 
work immediately on the budget. 
</P>
<P>
But neither the Feinstein nor Wilson campaign has asked the Finance Department 
for a budget briefing, a state Finance Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian and the Democratic-controlled Legislature fought bitterly this year 
over the current budget. Deukmejian failed to repeal state laws that grant 
automatic cost-of-living adjustments in certain entitlement programs like 
welfare. The final agreement, reached a full month after the constitutional 
budget deadline, provided for a one-year spending freeze and the imposition of 
a "trigger" device in future budget years that would roll back spending if 
revenues fell below a certain level. 
</P>
<P>
The state Finance Department advised state agencies this week that the 
"trigger" will take effect in the 1991-92 fiscal year, prompting automatic 
budget cuts of up to 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Budget experts say the resolution of the summer's big budget battle did little 
but postpone the coming fiscal crisis. 
</P>
<P>
There are major uncertainties other than the economy, including a lawsuit that, 
if lost, could force the state to pay $600 million more each year to support 
county health programs. That is the result of a dispute over an often-ignored 
statute requiring the state to pay for new duties that the Legislature imposes 
on counties. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has promised to veto any program mandated on local government by the 
Legislature that does not include state money to finance it. On Tuesday, 
Feinstein told the California League of Cities that the state should give 
cities and counties a new source of revenue to help them become more fiscally 
independent of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Voters could add millions more to the looming deficit by the ballots they cast 
on Nov. 6. Passage of Proposition 134, for example, the so-called 
nickel-a-drink alcohol tax, would cost the state $181 million more than it 
would bring in during the present fiscal year and more than $300 million in 
1991-92, Dooley said. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature already is at work on its own budget reforms, according to 
Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento). The Joint Legislative Budget 
Committee was ordered to report by Jan. 1 on a plan for reorganizing the state 
and local fiscal structure, including creation of a constitutional revision 
commission. The resolution declares that the ability of the Legislature and 
governor to budget wisely "has been seriously impaired by a number of court 
decisions, federal mandates, initiative constitutional amendments and 
statutes." 
</P>
<P>
Isenberg said the governor and Legislature will have to overcome a sour 
political mood left by a bitter election campaign. "None of this is very 
possible without some reaching out by a new governor to the Legislature," he 
said in an interview this week. 
</P>
<P>
Isenberg was not optimistic that the state budget problem will be straightened 
out soon. "I think it will take us 20 years to untangle what has taken 25 years 
to get into," he said. "I don't know how we'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
The Deukmejian Administration is putting together a basic 1991-92 budget, 
holding state departments and agencies to no increases over current spending 
levels. The governor-elect will have about seven weeks to refashion the 
spending plan before its submission to the Legislature Jan. 10.

HOUSING OPERATOR IN BANKRUPTCY; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: SANTA MONICA-BASED FIRM'S FAILURE RAISES ISSUE OF WHO WILL TAKE 
OVER ITS GOVERNMENT-SUBSIDIZED PROPERTIES, INCLUDING THREE IN THE L.A. AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
One of the nation's largest managers of government-subsidized housing has 
declared bankruptcy and abandoned its projects, raising questions about who 
will operate the properties, a top federal housing official said in Washington 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The chairman of bankrupt Santa Monica-based Housing Resources Management, A. 
Bruce Rozet, said he has other corporations willing to take over the projects. 
But federal housing authorities must approve any transfer, and that has yet to 
take place. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a positive message," Housing and Urban Development general counsel 
Frank Keating said of the bankruptcy. "They in effect have tossed the keys out 
the window and walked away." 
</P>
<P>
Executives of Housing Resources Management filed for bankruptcy Oct. 18. On 
that day, they also lost a bid to have an order overturned in which HUD, citing 
irregularities in the management operation, had barred them from taking over 
additional housing projects. The order is to remain in effect pending the 
outcome of an investigation of various people associated with the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Keating predicted that as a result of the bankruptcy, filed in Los Angeles, 
there will be some "dislocation to tenants." He said other firms will be able 
to manage the projects better than Housing Resources Management has. But there 
will be "a period of time before that can be fully implemented." 
</P>
<P>
"They have an absolute legal right to (file for bankruptcy)," Keating said. 
"But it is disappointing to us that they don't intend to work with us to fix 
the problems that they've created." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Rozet is trying to sell another major portion of his business 
to a New York firm, New Communities of America. In that part of his business, 
he acts as general partner in limited partnerships that own low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
"We are essentially going out of the business of operating HUD properties," 
Rozet said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he plans to continue consulting in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Robert De Monte, regional director of HUD in San Francisco, said the housing 
agency, which also has the authority to approve sales of property it 
subsidizes, has yet to authorize the sale. 
</P>
<P>
The fall of Housing Resources Management and the apparent sale of Rozet's 
syndication business amounts to another dramatic aftershock of the scandals at 
HUD. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Rozet nor the firms were named by congressional committees that 
investigated the troubled housing agency last year. But HUD Secretary Jack Kemp 
singled out a Rozet-controlled project in Washington last year as an example of 
how owners have allowed HUD-subsidized projects to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
Rozet, a Democratic fund-raiser who has allied himself with such politicians as 
Jesse Jackson, says Kemp singled him out in an effort to shift blame from 
Republicans who allegedly used undue influence during the tenure of former HUD 
Secretary Samuel R. Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, Rozet pulled out of the housing business and transferred 
many of his assets when he ran afoul of federal regulators. Later, in 1987, 
Rozet's main company, Associated Financial Corp., had assets of $121 million, 
and he was influential on Capitol Hill, serving as an expert on legislation 
affecting low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
"HUD has made it impossible for us to carry out any kind of reasonable role to 
maintain the properties, operate the properties or to assure their well-being," 
Rozet said in an interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
As the battle between Kemp and Rozet progressed, some housing officials voiced 
concerns that the agency might find itself forced to take over Housing 
Resources Management's portfolio of 80 projects nationwide, something it is ill 
equipped to do. 
</P>
<P>
Rozet said he hopes to turn over his management operation to a firm based in 
South Carolina that manages 55,000 units nationally. 
</P>
<P>
"We have done what they in fact wanted us to do, which is to divest ourselves 
of any interest and involvement in these properties," Rozet said. 
</P>
<P>
Rozet said there will be no impact on the tenants -- "unless HUD creates the 
disruption." But Keating said the housing agency has no desire to "trade one 
nag for another nag." 
</P>
<P>
At its height, Housing Resources Management had 700 employees and operated 100 
housing projects with 20,000 individual apartments. The firm now has 14 
projects in California, including three in the Los Angeles area. Earlier this 
month, HUD seized one of its most troubled projects, the 300-unit Ujima Village 
near South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In the bankruptcy, Housing Resources Management listed assets of $452,838 and 
liabilities of $663,552. The company filed under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy 
code, which suggests that the operation is being dissolved.

MOTHER DONATES PORTION OF LUNG TO AILING CHILD; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: THE STANFORD OPERATION IS THE WORLD'S FIRST SUCH TRANSPLANT FROM A 
LIVING PERSON, SURGEONS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In what surgeons say is the world's first lung transplant from a living donor, 
doctors at Stanford University Medical Center on Thursday removed one-third of 
the right lung of a 46-year-old woman and transplanted it into her 12-year-old 
daughter in a dramatic effort to save the girl. 
</P>
<P>
The child suffers from a rare, invariably fatal lung disease known as 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia. She was listed in good condition after a four-hour 
operation, and physicians hope the procedure will enable her to live a normal 
life. Without surgery, she would probably have died in 12 to 18 months, the 
medical center said. 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons cautioned that it will be days until they know if the operation was 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
"At the present time, things look very good," said Dr. David Latter, who 
assisted in the surgery. "The surgery was very smooth and the patient is awake 
in the intensive care unit." 
</P>
<P>
The surgery is considered highly experimental because less than 20 lung 
transplants have been done in children worldwide and because of the potential 
risk of the operation to the donor. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of the family, names and personal details about the mother and 
daughter were not released. The child is expected to remain in the hospital for 
about three weeks and, if all goes well, to resume normal activity within a few 
months, her physicians said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the surgery, she was experiencing breathing difficulties and infections 
and required oxygen at home. 
</P>
<P>
The extension of live donor transplants to the lung is likely to raise anew 
discussion of the ethics of the procedure, which requires that the risks to a 
parent or other family member, including major complications or death, be 
balanced against the potential benefits to a severely ill family member. 
</P>
<P>
"Live donations of lobes or pieces of solid organs is really steering into 
uncharted water," said Arthur Caplan, the director of the Center for Biomedical 
Ethics at the University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"I am personally not ready to do this yet," said Dr. Chip Bolman, who directs 
the University of Minnesota's lung transplant program. "If anybody is going to 
try this, the (Stanford surgeons) are as well qualified as any." 
</P>
<P>
Kidneys have been successfully transplanted from living donors since the 1950s, 
and the first successful liver transplant from a living donor was performed at 
the University of Chicago last November. There have also been a handful of 
living donor pancreas transplants at the University of Minnesota within the 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
In total, 12 liver transplants from living relatives, in which a segment of the 
liver is removed, have been performed at the University of Chicago in the last 
year and 11 of the recipients have survived, a medical center spokesman said. 
The first liver donor lost her spleen; the other liver donors have not had 
serious complications. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Vaughn A. Starnes, the head of Stanford's heart-lung transplant program, 
said a living related donor was used, instead of a dead unrelated donor, "with 
the hope of lessening the high rate of intense life-threatening rejection 
children have encountered in transplants involving the lungs." 
</P>
<P>
An equally important issue is the lack of suitable lung donors for children. 
</P>
<P>
Although both of the girl's lungs were damaged, the surgeons believe that 
replacing one lung with one lobe of an adult lung should sustain a healthy 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Laboratory testing involving animals suggests that the transplanted lung tissue 
can increase in capacity and keep up with the girl's growth, Starnes said. "The 
lobe is expected to function as an entire lung." 
</P>
<P>
The surgeries on the mother and daughter took place nearly simultaneously. 
First, the right upper lung lobe and related blood and breathing vessels were 
removed from the mother and flushed with cold solutions that helped to preserve 
their function. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after the daughter's right lung was removed, the lung lobe was attached. 
This involved connections of the lobe's arteries and veins and the breathing 
tube known as the bronchus. 
</P>
<P>
The child's illness, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, causes scarring and high blood 
pressure of the lungs. It sometimes develops in premature infants with immature 
lungs who must be supported for long periods on a respirator. 
</P>
<P>
For her mother, who has healthly lungs, the loss of the right upper lobe of her 
right lung will probably "mean nothing in the long term," Latter said. "Once 
she has recovered from the surgery, I don't think she will notice any 
impairment." 
</P>
<P>
Latter, who is a chief resident in cardiothoracic surgery at Stanford, 
explained that humans are born with "a remarkable excess of pulmonary function 
for day-to-day activities. We don't come close to using our full capacity." 
</P>
<P>
Since the first successful lung transplant was performed in Toronto in 1983, 
there have been several hundred such surgeries performed worldwide. But all of 
the organs have been taken from cadavers and very few have been in children. 
</P>
<P>
Adults who receive lung transplants have a one-year survival rate of between 
70% and 80%. But, according to Starnes, children appear to be more likely than 
adults to reject a transplanted lung, perhaps because their immune systems are 
more active and anti-rejection drugs are less effective. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-operative testing showed that "the mother was a far closer tissue match 
than could have been expected from an unrelated donor," Starnes said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the same blood type, mother and daughter shared four of six 
markers of tissue compatibility, known as antigens. Typically, unrelated 
cadaveric donors share two or fewer such markers with potential lung 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
"All in all, it just seemed a perfect situation to apply the concept (of living 
related lung donation)," Latter said.

VIOLENCE PROMPTS CALL FOR INCREASED SECURITY AT INGLEWOOD SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Inglewood residents called on school board members during an emotionally 
charged meeting Wednesday night to beef up campus security to insulate students 
and employees from street violence. 
</P>
<P>
The outcry was prompted by the deaths of three high school students in two 
off-campus shooting incidents earlier this month and a previously undisclosed 
holdup of cafeteria workers on a junior high school campus last week. 
</P>
<P>
Board members agreed to revive an anti-gang task force made up of community 
members and to participate in a march Saturday morning protesting the recent 
incidents of violence. 
</P>
<P>
Board members said budget constraints make the hiring of more security officers 
difficult, but parents and employees insisted that something must be done. 
</P>
<P>
"We need more security," said Leah Stephens, president of the PTA at Inglewood 
High School. "How would you feel if you had to fight gang members to get to 
your office? How would you feel if when you left at 5:30 in the evening, you 
had to fight gang members up and down the street? This is what our children 
have to deal with on a daily basis." 
</P>
<P>
School employees described an incident in which a masked man armed with a 
shotgun held up 15 Monroe cafeteria workers shortly before 6:30 a.m. Oct. 16. 
The man pointed his gun at the women, who were preparing meals for the day, and 
demanded their purses. 
</P>
<P>
Cafeteria manager Susie Martin said she distracted the gunman, allowing the 
other workers to run to the back of the kitchen. As the workers fled, the man 
fired a shot into the ceiling, then ran out of the cafeteria without taking any 
valuables. There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel safe," Martin told the board. " . . . I'm not here for sympathy. 
I'm here for security." 
</P>
<P>
Johnnie Thomas, the district's security chief, said school police officers 
patrolled the Monroe campus on the morning of the holdup as they usually do. 
The gunman arrived on campus after an officer had made his early-morning check 
of the school. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said that his department is understaffed but that the answer to the gang 
problem must begin in Inglewood's homes.

"The biggest problem is getting someone at home who cares," he said. "If the 
parents don't teach them, the streets will teach them." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said parents must prevent their children from adopting the skewed value 
system of the street. 
</P>
<P>
"When a kid goes to juvenile hall, he comes back to the 'hood beefed up from 
pumping iron, and his friends respect him even more," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Inglewood Police Chief James Butts told board members that the upswing 
in gang violence is a countywide phenomenon and that officers are working to 
bring it under control. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Lois Hill-Hale invited the community to a meeting at 9 a.m. 
today to revive a communitywide anti-gang task force that was first formed in 
1987. A march planned for 8 a.m. Saturday to commemorate Red Ribbon Week, a 
national anti-drug program, will also protest street violence, Hill-Hale said. 
Both events will take place at the district's headquarters at 401 S. Inglewood 
Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Hill-Hale said the school officials ought to work more closely with the city 
and its Police Department to provide alternatives to gangs. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, Mayor Edward Vincent said he would revive an 
intergovernmental relations committee of city and school officials to work out 
problems jointly. Vincent, who is facing four challengers in his reelection 
attempt, said that after next month's election, he plans a major offensive 
against gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to take care of the gang situation," he said. "You can quote me on 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Owen, an English teacher at Inglewood High, was skeptical that the 
board went far enough in addressing the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think a candlelight vigil or memorial service is going to cut it," she 
told the board. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day, I tell students, gang members who are in my classes, to pull up 
their pants, remove their belts and take out their shoelaces," Owen said in an 
interview later, referring to gang attire. "You ask the class how many have 
been affected by gang violence and everyone raises their hands."

FIRM'S SENTENCE FOR FATAL ACCIDENT IS TO MAKE VIDEO; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: INNOVATIVE PENALTY FOR A WILMINGTON CARGO CONTAINER FIRM IS AIMED AT 
PREVENTING MORE MISHAPS IN A HAZARDOUS INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A year after one of its employees was killed in a cargo handling accident, a 
Wilmington container company has been ordered to produce a bilingual worker 
safety video in the hope it will help reduce injuries and deaths in one of the 
nation's most dangerous industries. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence, imposed this week in Los Angeles Municipal Court against Martin 
Container Services Inc., is similar to others issued around the country that 
emphasize preventive rather than punitive sanctions, according to federal 
safety officials and local prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, they said, an East Coast shipyard was required to establish a 
comprehensive safety program, and a Los Angeles television producer convicted 
of wife beating was ordered to produce a documentary on domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
Federal and state safety officials -- who welcome the bilingual educational 
tape -- said the sentence comes at a time when they are focusing greater 
attention on improving safety in the containerized cargo hauling industry. 
</P>
<P>
In the Wilmington case, Martin Container Services was placed on three years 
probation and ordered to produce the video for the container industry after the 
company pleaded no contest to three violations of the state Labor Code. The 
firm separately paid fines imposed by the federal Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration (OSHA). 
</P>
<P>
The violations stem from the death on April 28, 1989, of Adrian Sanchez 
Jacinto, 21, a welder from Long Beach who was crushed by a 5,000-pound 
container that fell from a forklift. 
</P>
<P>
The accident, authorities said, occurred just before noon when Jacinto, his 
brother, Francisco, and foreman Antero Rodriguez were inspecting the bottom of 
the container at the company's repair yard at 1402 E. Lomita Blvd. The 20-foot 
container, suspended eight feet off the ground, slipped off the forklift and 
fell, crushing Jacinto, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Though agreeing soon after the incident to pay $3,000 in fines to OSHA, Martin 
Container Services has maintained that both Jacintos were violating the 
company's written safety policy when the accident occurred. Specifically, 
company President Nick Martin has said the surviving brother, who operated the 
forklift, was not trained or authorized to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Martin said this week that he accepts the sentence imposed by Los 
Angeles Municipal Court Commissioner Barry Kohn. 
</P>
<P>
"I am happy to do it," said Martin. "I feel it is something that is very needed 
in the industry." 
</P>
<P>
Martin's company, which has operated in Los Angeles Harbor for 15 years, is 
among the largest of the 30 container companies in the port, moving about 5,000 
containers a month. Los Angeles Harbor handles more cargo containers than any 
other port in the nation -- more than 2.1 million from July 1, 1989, to June 30 
of this year. 
</P>
<P>
The accident that killed Jacinto is Martin Container Services' only fatal 
accident, officials said, and that fact, coupled with the need for increased 
safety in the industry, led to the court's innovative order. 
</P>
<P>
"A punitive sentence wasn't going to help anyone. It wasn't going to bring 
(Jacinto) back," said Tracy Webb, the deputy Los Angeles city attorney who 
prosecuted the case. "What I wanted was to prevent something like that from 
ever happening again. And hopefully this will." 
</P>
<P>
The sentence calls for the company to produce the video by April 2 and provide 
no less than four hours each month of safety training to all its employees -- 
including showing them the 30-minute video. If the video is not produced by the 
deadline, the company will face fines. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the video originated with Martin and his attorney, Patrick Larkin, 
during discussions with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that rather than simply penalizing Martin, why not work out something 
that benefits not only that company but the industry?" Larkin said. 
</P>
<P>
They came up with the proposal for a video that must last at least 30 minutes 
and be produced in Spanish as well as English to accommodate the high 
percentage of dock workers who are from Central and South America, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to be sure the material was presented in both languages because we 
are seeing a real problem with employers producing information that is not in 
the language of many of their employees," said Marcia Gonzales, who supervises 
the city attorney's special enforcement unit that prosecuted the Martin case. 
</P>
<P>
The video, officials said, is expected to cost at least $60,000 to make and be 
good enough to use on local cable television and Southern California's 
Spanish-language stations. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Martin is required to distribute the video to Southern 
California's booming container industry, which over the years has seen numerous 
serious injuries and deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Though statistics were not immediately available, Gabe Gillotti of OSHA said 
the cargo handling industry, including container companies, has been one of the 
targets of a national task force on injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that cargo handling 
operations in 1985 and 1986 had a lost-workday injury rate six times greater 
than the national average for all workers. "Cargo handling operations are among 
the most hazardous activities in the nation's workplaces," the bureau 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, federal officials have noted the steady increase in the 
containerized cargo industry and are concerned that "a number of fatalities 
have occurred during the past few years" in companies moving the huge 
containers, according to a recent OSHA report. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's increased attention to the industry was evident last week when 
Stevedoring Services of America was charged with two violations of safety 
standards at the company's yard in Long Beach. The OSHA violations could carry 
penalties totaling $8,700. 
</P>
<P>
"This industry is one we are very concerned about," said Jack Rhodes, district 
supervisor for federal OSHA.

REMEMBERING 'THE GREATEST FIGHTER PLANE IN THE WORLD'; 
</P>
<P>
AIRCRAFT: JEAN-LUC BEGHIN FIRST SAW THE P-51 MUSTANG IN THE SKIES OVER EUROPE 
DURING WORLD WAR II. THUS BEGAN A LOVE AFFAIR THAT HAS LASTED 46 YEARS. 
</P>

<P>
Though 46 years have passed, the moment remains vivid to Jean-Luc Beghin. He 
can still see the planes chasing each other in the skies over war-torn 
Brussels. The German plane, he remembers, was dark and menacing. The other, an 
American fighter, its engine thundering, was brightly decorated with huge white 
stars on its wings and fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a dogfight," Beghin says of that spring day in 1944. "I was in 
kindergarten and all the kids wanted to watch." 
</P>
<P>
Beghin does not remember much about the German plane. "I was only 5 years old 
at the time," he explains. But he recalls every detail about the American 
fighter and especially the words of one teacher who joined her students staring 
up at the sky. "I remember her saying, 'That's a Mustang.' " 
</P>
<P>
The P-51 Mustang. Just the name brings a smile to Beghin. For it was, he says, 
more than a fighter plane. It was a symbol. Proud. Flashy. Powerful. "It was my 
image of America," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Beghin lives in Westchester, only a mile or so from the former North 
American Aviation plant where the P-51 was born and built. And Beghin is among 
those celebrating the 50th anniversary today of the fighter's first test flight 
over Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old artist is completing a pen-and-ink rendition of the aircraft's 
cockpit for the French aviation magazine, Info Pilote. The publication's 
six-page tribute to the P-51 will be among many celebrations worldwide, 
including air shows and exhibits this weekend from Santa Maria, Calif., to 
Duxforth, England. 
</P>
<P>
But none of the anniversary tributes will be any more personal than Beghin's. 
For the P-51 Mustang inspired Beghin as a boy and launched a love affair with 
aviation that continues today, particularly in his pen-and-ink drawings of 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my main purpose in life," he says. 
</P>
<P>
From his days as an aviation illustrator for the Belgian Air Force to his 
employment today as a flight coordinator for Air France, Beghin's life has 
revolved around aviation. 
</P>
<P>
His works, displayed at the Smithsonian Institution and NASA's Houston Museum, 
depict aircraft subjects ranging from Charles Lindbergh's "Spirit of St. Louis" 
to the Apollo cockpit. In all, about 20 renderings by Beghin have been 
commissioned for aviation exhibits and publications. 
</P>
<P>
Now, those works will be joined by Beghin's drawings of the P-51, an aircraft 
originally commissioned by the Royal Air Force only months before the United 
States joined World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1940, the British were short of fighter planes and came to North American 
Aviation, which had built the AT-6 trainer for England," says Beghin, who has 
followed the P-51's history since his youth. 
</P>
<P>
Given four months to design and build a new fighter for England, the aircraft 
company (later absorbed by Rockwell International) unveiled the P-51 Mustang, a 
sleek, soaring aircraft faster than any fighter before it. Soon, the aircraft 
established itself as the finest American-built fighter used by the Royal Air 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the United States began purchasing the fighters, the RAF had 
replaced the Mustangs' unreliable first engines with 1,600-horsepower engines 
built by Rolls-Royce. Later, the same engines, built in the United States by 
Packard, were installed in the P-51s commissioned by the U.S. Army Air Corps. 
</P>
<P>
The new engines allowed the P-51 a top speed of 487 miles an hour. And the 
addition of auxiliary fuel tanks extended its flying range enough for the 
aircraft to escort American bombers all the way from England to Berlin. Those 
bombers included the B-17, whose exploits have been popularized in the current 
movie, "Memphis Belle." 
</P>
<P>
"It became the greatest fighter plane in the world," says Beghin. 
</P>
<P>
After Germany unveiled the world's first jet fighter, it was a P-51, flown by 
the soon-to-be-famous test pilot Chuck Yeager, that downed a Messerschmidt 262. 
</P>
<P>
And of course, when Beghin was a boy, it was a P-51 that he remembers helping 
to liberate his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, he says, his fascination with the aircraft has never waned. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, he spoke with the P-51's designer, Edgar Schmued, who lived in Rancho 
Palos Verdes and died in 1985. And two months ago, Beghin took his first flight 
in a P-51 during a trip to Paris. "When we took off, I had some tears in my 
eyes," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Someday, Beghin adds, he will finally finish a book on the P-51 Mustang. "I've 
been working on it for some time," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he will continue his drawings. And, he says, there are plenty 
of memories of the P-51 that will forever connect him to his youth. 
</P>
<P>
Like the time, just after the war, when Beghin bought package after package of 
Belgium chocolate bars, just to collect an aviation history card of the P-51 
Mustang. "Some of my friends had the card and I kept buying the chocolate just 
to get one. I don't remember how many bars I finally ate," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Or the moment, after Belgium's liberation in September, 1944, when Beghin got 
his first close look at one of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a Mustang on display in the public square. I remember going up and 
touching the bare metal and seeing the plane up close. The bright colors and 
that white star. 
</P>
<P>
"It was," he says, "like Disneyland before its time."

WEEKENDER: PARKS OFFER 'SAFETY AND A SUPER TIME' FOR CHILDREN ON HALLOWEEN.

All dressed up and nowhere to go for Halloween? 
</P>
<P>
Concerned parents looking for alternatives to the trick-or-treat street scene 
for their children can chose from a wide range of activities at South Bay 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
Starting as early as today, parks are setting up their own twilight zones of 
ghosts, goblins, witches and other out-of-this-world creatures for kids of 
various ages. Young-at-heart parents are welcome to join the fun. 
</P>
<P>
Participating parks will also sell sodas, hot dogs, pizzas and other fare. And, 
of course, sweet treats are part of the goody packages that will be given to 
the kids. 
</P>
<P>
Fun but safe is the name of the game, park officials said as they set up 
carnivals, haunted houses, game booths and costume parades. 
</P>
<P>
In Inglewood, said Rhonda McIntosh of Rogers Park, the push is "to keep the 
kids off the streets." 
</P>
<P>
"We want them to know there's more to life than just hanging out," McIntosh 
said. "They can come to the park and join in the activities that we have." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers Park, 400 W. Beach Ave., has scheduled two dances for area students. 
Today, from 3 to 6 p.m., for 50 cents, fifth- and sixth-graders can groove to 
the music at a costume dance in the senior citizen auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
From 7 to 10 p.m., students from Inglewood's La Tijera, Parent, Warren Lane, 
Crozier and Monroe junior high schools can show off their garb and fancy 
footsteps at the park's annual Junior High School Halloween Dance in the main 
gymnasium. Admission is $1. 
</P>
<P>
In Manhattan Beach, on Saturday, Manhattan Heights Park, at 1600 Manhattan 
Beach Blvd., promises a day of fun-filled horrors for children ages 6 to 12. 
Prizes will be awarded for the most original, attractive, scariest and funniest 
costumes. Admission is free. 
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the festivities will be the haunted house, which is a must-see, 
said recreation supervisor Idris Al-Oboudi. 
</P>
<P>
The theme of the house is a secret, Al-Oboudi said. "We're keeping the lid on 
it, but it's pretty scary. It does not border on anything that is torturous . . 
. just kinda funky and freaky." 
</P>
<P>
The park has also built a "fun house" for children 5 and under, who can be 
initiated into the world of fright by "putting their hands on Jell-O and 
spaghetti in the dark," Al-Oboudi said. "Everything in this house is friendly." 
</P>
<P>
After the weekend's activities, there will be more events on Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
In Inglewood, from 6 to 9 p.m., preschoolers to sixth-graders can brave the 
Rogers Park haunted house before or after they play in the carnival of fun and 
games or march in the costume parade. Admission is 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
In Lawndale, the Rotary Club is throwing a Halloween youth party at Alondra 
Park, 3850 Manhattan Beach Blvd. for children 13 and under. County Supervisor 
Kenneth Hahn has turned over his field office for the party, which starts at 6 
p.m. and features games, a costume contest, hot dogs and soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage children to go home afterward rather than trick-or-treat 
door-to-door, the Rotary Club will try a twist on a traditional lottery. 
</P>
<P>
After the party ends at 8:30 p.m., the Rotary Club will give the children 30 
minutes to get home, and then draw names and phone the winners. The children 
must be at home to win the prizes. A 10-speed bicycle will be given to the 
first child who answers at his home phone no later than 9 p.m. Other prizes 
will include a basketball, a football and boxed games. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to prevent the kids from going door-to-door," said Craig Burris, 
the club's director for community services. "With the major prizes, they'll 
have an incentive to get home at an early time." 
</P>
<P>
In San Pedro, Peck Park, 560 N. Western Ave., will host a carnival and costume 
parade featuring face painting by an artist from a Hollywood makeup studio. 
</P>
<P>
"Fun, that's what Halloween is," said Phil Orland, director of Peck Park 
Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
He said children of all ages should know that city parks are there for them to 
enjoy, and that on a holiday such as Halloween, "enjoyment, fun, safety, and a 
super time" can be had by all. 
</P>
<P>

END PCH PARKING FOR SAFETY REASONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was "deja vu all over again" as I read your article about removing parking 
during the afternoon rush hour in Hermosa Beach (Times, Oct. 14). The pathetic 
posturing by the City Council, staff and Caltrans was lame beyond excuse. 
</P>
<P>
As a former member of the Hermosa Beach City Council, a decade ago, we did 
remove the parking for several weeks on a trial basis. Accidents did decrease, 
driving time did improve, fewer commuters snaked their way through our narrow 
residential streets, and the "chicken littles" were proven wrong -- the sky did 
not fall on the local businesses. A subsequent City Council reinstituted that 
parking, and Caltrans, without a whimper, meekly folded its tent and skulked 
into the sunset. 
</P>
<P>
As to the current discussions: Where is the current City Council's concern for 
the residents who must confront the daily intrusion of commuter traffic (that 
should be on PCH) into our neighborhoods? Should a literal handful of 
businesses cloud your vision of the safety and sanity of all Hermosans? To 
ignore the proven safety and environmental risks of your "do-nothing" approach 
is blatant malfeasance of your public trust. 
</P>
<P>
How many potential customers is the Chamber of Commerce sacrificing by its 
position? Do you honestly believe that consumers will stop at a local business 
during rush hour when they fear the all-too-frequent sideswipe while trying to 
park, or return on the weekend to patronize a business after sweating five days 
of absurd gridlock? 
</P>
<P>
Why is the Hermosa School Board's voice mute concerning the safety of our 
children trying to return home while competing with irate commuters? With 
crossing guards providing safe passage across PCH, why your silence about the 
safety of our kids along Valley Drive, Ardmore Avenue, Hermosa Avenue, Prospect 
Avenue, etc? 
</P>
<P>
Since Caltrans knows the safety, liability and environmental realities, where's 
its guts? Since Hermosa Beach officials and staff lack the fortitude, torque 
your own courage and do what needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
With heads firmly placed in the sand, I fear the current charade will only 
continue. Parking along PCH during the afternoon rush hour should be removed, 
not because it is the answer to traffic congestion, but because it is a 
necessary and reasonable local response to the regional traffic congestion 
puzzle and to the peace of mind that we deserve in Hermosa Beach.

COASTLINE MUST BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL

<P>
I was walking along the bluffs in Rancho Palos Verdes some weeks ago when I 
came upon a fantastic sight. In one of the small bays below Berryhill Drive I 
saw pelicans diving for fish. 
</P>
<P>
Not just a few pelicans but dozens and dozens of them. The sky above the bay 
was filled with circling and diving pelicans. The surface of the bay was dotted 
with more pelicans splashing, diving, surfacing and trying to swallow their 
catch. 
</P>
<P>
What a sight! I had never seen so many pelicans in one small bay before. It was 
difficult to count, since scores of pelicans were arriving as others were 
leaving . . . but I would guess there were about 80 to 120 pelicans in this 
feeding frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
It was an incredible and absorbing show, and I stood and watched for perhaps 15 
minutes as the feeding went on and on. This spontaneous bird show is a key 
reason why all citizens must have easy access to our coastline. In addition to 
sheltering whales and dolphins and seals and cormorants and gulls and many 
other sea and shore creatures, the coastline is a bountiful resource which must 
always be available for kids, adults and seniors. Fantastic sights and 
marvelous bird, fish and mammal sightings may be lost if we allow the coastline 
to be overdeveloped and do not allow for hiking and biking trails and coastal 
roads. Be sure to tell your city council members that coastal access for all 
comers must be guaranteed.

ETHNIC NOVELS JOIN FITZGERALD, FAULKNER ON SCHOOL BOOK LISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY YARBER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I browse through the writers' names in my English textbooks, I see mostly 
white males. But when I look out at my students, I see males and females, 
Asians, Latinos, blacks, and other ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
The ethnic makeup of Southern California is becoming ever more diverse, and, 
although Hemingway, Faulkner, Fitzgerald and the others are still valid 
recorders of the "American experience," they can't do it alone anymore. 
</P>
<P>
To help your child understand and get along with other kinds of people, several 
local experts in ethnic literature have helped me make a list of books that are 
authentic and fun to read. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are dozens of cultures shaping our society, three are especially 
noteworthy by virtue of their numbers in Southern California and their 
contribution to American literature: blacks, Latinos and Asian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Latino literature offers a variety of novels for teens, but here are three 
consistent favorites: 
</P>
<P>
* "Pocho," by Antonio Villareal, gets its title from the derogatory term used 
by native Mexicans to label American-born Mexicans. "It gives the reader a 
fairly detailed, accurate, and interesting picture of what the life of a 
typical Hispanic in L.A. or anywhere else might be like," said Ernest Garcia, 
an English teacher at Santa Monica High School. It is aimed at junior high 
school readers. 
</P>
<P>
* "The House on Mango Street," by Sandra Cisneros, is also suggested by Garcia 
for junior high readers. Written in an easy and conversational style, the book 
traces the life of a young, inner-city Latino girl and discusses a variety of 
problems that any student can understand. 
</P>
<P>
* "Famous All Over Town" is the hottest Latino novel among students at Venice 
High School, according to English teacher Wendy Fairbanks. In it, author Danny 
Santiana presents a Latino boy whose friends have all moved or been jailed or 
killed. "It's a strong portrait of a lonely, displaced kid," said Fairbanks. 
"It's stunning -- it just knocks the kids out." 
</P>
<P>
Black American literature has a long tradition that, many people are surprised 
to learn, began well before the Civil War. But the most powerful and popular 
works are more recent: 
</P>
<P>
* "Black Boy," the unforgettable autobiographical account of Richard Wright's 
life and struggle against racism in the South, is one of the most controversial 
works read by Westside students. Some teachers criticize the detailed violence, 
while others say it's no worse than what students see on TV or the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we stop talking about these things, we'll really have problems," said 
Judy Wong-Nichols, English teacher at Westchester High School, where "Black 
Boy" is required reading. 
</P>
<P>
* Toni Morrison's "Beloved" is also in demand; it traces an ex-slave's life and 
her fight to conquer her own past. " 'Beloved' will be taught 20 years from now 
as required reading right next to Faulkner," predicted Carol Jago, English 
teacher at Santa Monica High School. "Its message is equally as vital for 
Americans to understand who they are." 
</P>
<P>
* "Hoops," Walter Myers' story of a black youth obsessed with basketball, will 
please even the pickiest readers, says Fairbanks. "I give it to boys who refuse 
to read books, and they read it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Asian-American literature covers many separate cultures and languages, but 
three groups seem to dominate -- Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese. Here is one 
book from each: 
</P>
<P>
* "The Joy Luck Club" put author Amy Tan atop the New York Times' paperback 
bestseller list last summer, and deservedly so. Jago insists that these stories 
of conflict between Chinese mothers and their Americanized daughters "should be 
required reading for any child who lives in two worlds and is trying to adjust 
to life in America." Sophisticated junior high and average senior high students 
will enjoy Tan's book. 
</P>
<P>
* "Farewell to Manzanar," Geanne Houston's story of her Japanese-American 
family's World War II internment in California, was my own first glimpse of 
Asian-American life. Houston's account of being viewed as an enemy in her own 
country is painful but necessary. It's also timely, since some internment 
survivors received checks from the U.S. government earlier this month. 
"Farewell" is good for junior and senior high readers. 
</P>
<P>
* Much of Vietnamese-American literature deals with the voyage to America in 
the 1970s and '80s, and "The Girl in the White Dress" is one of the best. In 
it, Peter Townsend describes the arrival of a young girl who is the sole 
survivor of her family. This is a popular Asian-American novel at Palisades 
High School, English teacher Russell Smith says. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, new books representing these ethnic groups are published frequently, 
and nearly any teacher can add personal favorites. 
</P>
<P>
This brief list will, however, give your child a fundamental and respectful 
insight into the widely differing people who make up a significant part of the 
diverse society we live in.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOBIL WEIGHS APPEAL OF FIRE RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mobil Oil Corp. officials have not decided whether they will challenge a 
decision by a panel of four Superior Court judges that the company and one of 
its contractors must stand trial on criminal charges stemming from a 1988 fire. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate panel overturned a ruling by South Bay Municipal Court Judge 
Thomas Allen that dismissed 171 misdemeanor counts filed against the oil 
company by Torrance City Prosecutor J. D. Lord. 
</P>
<P>
Allen had ruled that Lord did not have jurisdiction to file the charges because 
the alleged violations at Mobil's Torrance refinery already were being handled 
by inspectors from the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
</P>
<P>
OSHA inspectors launched an intensive survey of the refinery after an Aug. 5, 
1988, fire that injured two contract workers from Irwin Industries, which also 
faces criminal charges. Several of the counts charge that Irwin employees 
mistakenly opened an incorrect valve, allowing hot oil to spill out and ignite 
on a heated pipe. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate judges concluded that both Lord and OSHA have jurisdiction 
because the refinery could be in violation of both OSHA regulations and the 
state's Labor Code. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil has until Nov. 9 to decide whether to ask a state appeals court to hear 
the issue.

<P>
SWIMWEAR: THE BUST GETS TOP BILLING IN 1991. DESIGNERS RAISE IT, LOWER IT, 
REVEAL IT AND CONCEAL IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE-MARIE TURK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The word for 1991 swimwear is magic. Two-piece suits convert to one piece with 
the flick of a waistband; peek-a-boo mesh inserts are intriguing and 
concealing; sexy suits are fashioned from girdle-strong fabrics; textured 
surfaces are made to look like velour or corduroy, and there are endless ways 
to increase, decrease, raise, lower, conceal and reveal the bust. 
</P>
<P>
The trends surfaced recently at the California Mart, where swimwear companies 
held this year's International Swimwear/Activewear Market (ISAM) in their 
showrooms. The exception was Israel-based Gottex, whose cruise '91 collection 
hit the runway during a "Fashions for Peace" benefit Wednesday at the Regent 
Beverly Wilshire Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The bosom gets top billing from everyone, including Miriam Ruzow, president of 
Gottex, who discussed the next most important issue: fabrics. At Gottex, they 
include "an unexpected match of patterns and textures; beautiful, bright colors 
and some psychedelic prints; artist-inspired prints and the influence of the 
ecology." With many companies, including Gottex and E. Stewart, offering 
Pucci-inspired '60s prints, there is every chance of Pucci overkill by summer. 
The environment is another prevalent theme. Baja Blue, for example, adds subtle 
touches -- a suit done in "Jacques Cousteau" blue and a suit with fish swimming 
across the front. 
</P>
<P>
Baja Blue, a fresh line from Beach Patrol Inc., is one of several promising 
newcomers. Another, Juice, a junior/contemporary line from Cole of California, 
makes its first splash with suits trimmed in raffia, shells, sequins or rubber. 
Dive Boy, a Miami-based company, is offering some of the thinnest, most sensual 
fabrics and some of the sexiest designs. 
</P>
<P>
In a season of unusual cuts, colors and fabrics, the names are almost as 
fascinating as the products. Huit uses a suede-finish fabric so soft and 
clinging that it is called "Peau de Peche," or peach skin. But no one seems to 
have as many captivating titles as Anne Cole, who has changed Cole Jr. to Hot 
Coles and peppered her collections with styles called "Bosom Buddy," "Twin 
Peaks," "Two-Car Garage" and "Lunch Box." Lori Ovington, a Cole sales 
representative, speculated the lunch box reference means "you can put 
everything inside."

STREET SCENE: AS DINING BECOMES FOCUS OF L.A. NIGHT LIFE, RESTAURANTS 
INCREASINGLY SET THE TONE -- DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY -- FOR WHAT THEIR

Food and fashion, fashion and food. In Los Angeles the two are as synonymous as 
automobiles and smog. 
</P>
<P>
People have always dressed for a night on the town. 
</P>
<P>
But as traditional forms of entertainment like movies, theater and dancing 
become increasingly cost prohibitive, spending the evening at dinner has 
evolved into a new form of L.A. night life. 
</P>
<P>
And Angelenos are treating these eateries as the nightclubs of the 1990s, often 
dressing to suit the environment. 
</P>
<P>
At Beverly Hills-based Bice, for instance, the streamline moderne decor of the 
restaurant evokes an evening aboard a luxury cruise liner. And the patrons 
dress accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
"They look like the just stepped off the Queen Mary," said one bar patron when 
asked to describe the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Across town at Border Grill in Santa Monica, dressing for margaritaville 
includes pretty petite floral dresses, bright blazers, short skirts and, in 
some cases, spiked hair. 
</P>
<P>
"It's trendy, hip and young," offers one customer. "On a scale of one to 10, 
it's an eight. But ask me again when I've had another margarita." 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the atmosphere and attitude at Chaya Venice, located off Main 
Street in Venice, is weird, funky and a little yuppie. 
</P>
<P>
At quick glance, Chaya Venice appears to be the ladies-who-lunch crowd. But a 
regular at the recently opened restaurant more accurately describes the 
clientele as "celebrity wanna-bes who work in boutiques." 
</P>
<P>
At Atlas Bar &amp; Grill, owner Mario Tamayo cultivates the more avant-garde 
restaurant patron. 
</P>
<P>
Live jazz and Caribbean-inspired food entice one to dress up in everything from 
short, floral backless dresses and casual jeans to gold lame cocktail dresses 
and tailored Italian suits. 
</P>
<P>
"You come to Atlas to be seen," says one bar customer. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what it's all about. It's what we live for." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. 
</P>

EX-HOSTAGE SAYS: DON'T FORGET OTHERS; 
</P>
<P>
RELEASE: A SANTA ANA MAN FREED BY IRAQ BECAUSE OF HIS PHYSICAL CONDITION SAYS 
HE HOPES TO HELP THOSE LEFT BEHIND.

Exhausted but elated, a Santa Ana man freed from Iraq after nearly three months 
in captivity touched down in Southern California on Thursday evening with words 
of thanks. But Jack Frazier said of the fellow captives he left behind: "We 
can't forget them -- it's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
"I know in their hearts, they were asking, 'Why not me?' " said the 53-year-old 
Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
The reason Iraqi officials gave in releasing Frazier earlier this week was his 
physical condition: He is a diabetic who takes oral medication and has a 
history of heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
His release, along with 13 other Americans with medical conditions, was seen by 
U.S. diplomats as a "goodwill gesture" by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, aimed 
at defusing opposition to his regime under the guise of humanitarianism. 
</P>
<P>
But when Frazier got off his plane shortly before 6 p.m. at Los Angeles 
International Airport with his three children and grandchild, he did not want 
to discuss politics. Instead, after greeting several in-laws and other family 
members with tearful hugs, his focus was on the remaining hostages -- or 
"special guests," as their Baghdad captors term them. 
</P>
<P>
He pledged to make their release his highest priority now that he is back in 
the United States. They must be kept "on the front burner," he said, in order 
to "get them home." 
</P>
<P>
Frazier, a construction supervisor at a Bechtel Corp. refinery project in Iraq, 
had arrived in New York late Wednesday and spent the night there. Drinking a 
beer with his two sons was one of his first acts as a free man, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers from New York who shared Frazier's plane stepped into the airport 
terminal in a daze as they were met by TV cameras and photographers. 
</P>
<P>
During a 10-minute press conference, Frazier said he appreciated all the media 
attention but was too tired to talk at length. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been on an emotional roller coaster along with a thousand other people 
for the last 2 1/2 months, seven days a week, 24 hours a day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The nights were the toughest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
While free to move about the "safe house" where he stayed, Frazier said: 
"There's no such thing as eight hours' sleep. . . . You have no control of the 
night. . . . You really don't know what to expect. You don't feel very 
comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, he holds no animosity toward the Iraqi people. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no reason to be mad at them," he said. And when asked about his 
treatment in the Middle East, he said: "I want to make that very clear -- I was 
not mistreated at all." 
</P>
<P>
Frazier said his future plans are somewhat uncertain. He said he hopes to 
return to work at Bechtel and will know more about his physical condition today 
after he goes to the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Family members, meanwhile, said they want to do everything they can to keep him 
close to home. His fiancee, Deanna Frizelle, who had driven from Montana to 
meet the plane, had even joked about bringing a minister to the airport to tie 
the knot right there. In tears at the airport, a relieved Frizelle said: "I 
have him physically but not quite mentally -- his mind is still back with his 
friends."

<P>
There were conflicting reports on the magnitude of the quake, which was felt as 
far away as New Delhi, the Indian capital.

<P>
Russ Needham, a spokesman for the the U.S. Geological Survey's National 
Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., said it had a magnitude of 5.6. 
Pakistan's meteorological center initially reported a 7 reading, and India's 
meteorology department recorded a 6.5 reading.

RED STAR OVER ORANGE COUNTY

<TEXT>
<P>
In conservative Orange County, where the well of good feeling toward 
Republicans runs deep, it's small surprise that President Bush would enjoy 
higher-than-average approval ratings. 
</P>
<P>
But a new Times Orange County Poll finds that Bush shares the local popularity 
limelight with an unlikely counterpart: Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
Bush and Gorbachev, in fact, polled identical favorable ratings in the 
600-voter survey, each winning the approval of 77% of those interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
A January, 1989, Times Orange County Poll also found that about seven out of 10 
voters had favorable impressions of both leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of what Gorbachev has done are things that are in the American populist 
tradition, shaking up the system," said Mark Baldassare, the pollster who 
conducted the survey for The Times Orange County Edition. "He's very strongly 
identified with political reform and hope for world peace." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's economic reforms, many of which are aimed at introducing elements 
of the free market into the highly centralized Soviet system, may find an 
especially receptive audience in conservative areas of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Gorbachev, who received the Nobel Peace Prize last week, racked up his 
highest ratings among Orange County's richest residents. Two-thirds of voters 
who make less than $35,000 a year viewed the Soviet president favorably, but 
fully 86% of those making more than $75,000 held a positive impression. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, although Gorbachev is the best-known Communist Party member in the 
world, it doesn't seem to hurt him in one of the United States' most famously 
anti-Communist counties. Orange County Republicans actually like him more than 
Democrats do, and more than seven out of 10 members of both parties have a 
favorable opinion of the man who commands thousands of nuclear missiles aimed 
at American targets. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't face the partisan political problems that an American president 
does," Baldassare said. "Bush can be happy about being as popular as 
Gorbachev."

RICHARD HUBLER, 14, GETS 17 YEARS TO LIFE;

<P>
SENTENCING: HE WILL, HOWEVER, PROBABLY SPEND NO MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS IN THE 
CALIFORNIA YOUTH AUTHORITY FOR THE FATAL SHOOTING OF HIS SISTER.

<P>
Despite emotional pleas from his family and friends for a brief stint in 
Juvenile Hall, 14-year-old Richard Hubler of Anaheim was sentenced Thursday to 
17 years to life in the California Youth Authority for the fatal shooting of 
his younger sister. 
</P>
<P>
Hubler, who begged for leniency, tearfully told the court that he would never 
touch a gun again and blamed his interest in firearms on watching a lot of 
television. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, "I just want to get out and go to my sister's grave." 
</P>
<P>
But Superior Court Judge Robert E. Thomas rejected a commitment to Orange 
County Juvenile Hall, saying Hubler should serve time in the CYA to "develop a 
self-discipline he answers to." 
</P>
<P>
The judge's decision brought emotional gasps and sobs from Hubler's parents, 
brother, grandmother, and three rows of seats filled with his supporters. Some 
had requested that the youth receive no more than a year in Juvenile Hall for 
the June 14 slaying. 
</P>
<P>
"He did a terrible thing. He realizes that," said James Hubler, who asked the 
court to be merciful with his son. "I've talked to him many times since this 
happened. He has told me many times he wished it had been him that died instead 
of his sister." 
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's hearing, Deputy Dist. Atty. Brent F. Romney told the court 
that he understands how unusual the case is and how the Hublers must be torn 
because of their love for both their son and their daughter, who was the 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
Romney, however, argued that Hubler still refuses to face up to what happened, 
continuing to call the shooting an accident. The prosecutor also argued that 
the youth has a history of run-ins with authorities because of his fascination 
with guns and cannot not be trusted on probation. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's going to be rehabilitated, he's going to have to be more restricted 
than what the local authorities can do," Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
Hubler, who called 911 after the shooting, initially told police that intruders 
shot his sister, Gema Marie, in her bedroom at their Anaheim Shores home. 
Confronted by the possibility of tests that would show whether he had fired a 
gun, he then said that he accidentally shot Gema while playing with a 
.22-caliber rifle. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors introduced evidence that the brother and sister had argued 
vehemently just before the shooting. Among other things, a girlfriend with whom 
Hubler had been talking on the telephone heard him tell his sister to shut up 
or he would shoot her. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Gema was mortally wounded in the head and died four days later, never 
regaining consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Hubler was on probation at the time for two previous incidents in which he 
possessed guns. Five days before the shooting, his father threatened to report 
him to a probation officer when he discovered that the boy had another gun. 
Hubler's parents took that weapon away, but the youth obtained still another 
one, a .22-caliber rifle. 
</P>
<P>
If Hubler had not violated his probation and disobeyed his parents, "Gema would 
be alive today," the judge said during sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Thomas convicted the youth of second-degree murder under the 
"implied malice" theory, stating that Hubler was aware that the rifle was 
defective when he took it to his sister's room and pointed it at her. Hubler 
had sawed off the stock the night before and damaged the feeding mechanism for 
the ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
Although he handed down a 17-years-to-life sentence, the judge told Hubler's 
friends and family that the youth would probably serve no more than seven years 
under CYA guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, the defense asked for a one-year commitment to Juvenile Hall to 
be followed by probation. 
</P>
<P>
Hubler, in a tearful speech to the court, said, "I know what I did was wrong, 
but to send me to (the CYA) . . . I just won't get much out of it." He then 
complained that the authorities did not let him attend his sister's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand why this is happening to him. This was just a tragic 
accident," Virginia Alvarez, the mother of Hubler's girlfriend, told the court. 
</P>
<P>
But Thomas said the CYA would give the boy time to make good on his promise to 
the court and his family that he would straighten up his life. 
</P>
<P>
"Good luck to you. . . . Listen to what they have to say," Thomas said.

CUTOFF DATE LIMITS DISCLOSURE OF COSTS

A series of "message" signs posted along Laguna Canyon Road and a slick, color 
brochure dropped in the mailboxes of Laguna Beach voters Thursday were among 
the latest campaign gimmicks employed by supporters of the city's $20-million 
bond measure on the Nov. 6 ballot to help save part of the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
But the costs of the costly campaign tools were not disclosed by the Committee 
to Save the Canyon in the latest campaign finance disclosure statement filed 
Thursday because the expenses were incurred after the Oct. 20 cutoff date for 
reporting expenses. 
</P>
<P>
State law does not require another report to be filed until January. 
</P>
<P>
According to the statement filed Thursday, the Committee to Save the Canyon has 
raised $72,852 and spent $22,677 since the start of the campaign earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
The single largest donor listed in the report is the Irvine Co. -- the owner of 
the land the bond money would help buy -- with a total contribution of $15,300. 
</P>
<P>
A two-thirds majority vote by Laguna Beach citizens in favor of Measure H would 
authorize a $20-million bond issue that would go toward the $78-million 
purchase price for land scheduled for development by the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
Not included in the report was a major donation by the Hotel Laguna, which 
sponsored a major fund-raising dinner earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The only organized opposition to the bond measure -- the Laguna Beach 
Taxpayer's Assn. -- was unaware until Thursday that it was required to file a 
report and asked the city clerk for an extension of the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
However, association treasurer Art Casebeer, said he did not think the group 
had spent more than $1,000 before the reporting period ended. GEBE MARTINEZ

BOAT RUNS AGROUND IN FOG; 2 UNINJURED

<P>
Two South County boaters escaped to shore unhurt early Thursday after their 
27-foot cabin cruiser ran aground in heavy fog on a rocky point just off posh 
Irvine Cove. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Darryl Parker, 27, of San Clemente, and Timothy Sheldon Durso, 30, of San 
Juan Capistrano, a co-owner of the boat, told sheriff's deputies the heavy fog 
caused them to lose track of where they were going, according to Sheriff's 
Department Lt. Richard Olson. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were cited for possession of less than an ounce of marijuana and 
released after deputies found a small amount of the drug, Olson said. Olson 
declined to say where the drugs were found but added that the incident remains 
under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The two men had traveled from Dana Point to Newport Beach for dinner and ran 
aground on the return trip to Dana Point about 2:30 a.m., Olson said. The pair 
managed to walk to the beach of a gate-guarded community and call for help, 
Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
The boat, a 1990 Regal Commander 265 twin screw outboard worth about $55,000, 
was towed to Newport Harbor for repairs, said Stephen J. Vogt of San Juan 
Capistrano, another of the boat's co-owners. The rocks tore a hole in the 
bottom of the boat and broke one of the outboard engines, said Randall D. 
Durso, Timothy's brother and another co-owner.LEN HALL

CANDIDATE'S MATERIAL TAKEN AT PRINTER'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two large boxes of a City Council candidate's political literature have been 
missing since a mystery man picked up thousands of mailers from a downtown 
printer and drove away, campaign officials reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an act of sabotage," charged Bill O'Hare, candidate Ann Christoph's 
campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
The literature consisted of campaign letters and cards soliciting donations and 
volunteer help, O'Hare said. Because it was immediately reprinted, Christoph's 
campaign did not suffer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The printed material was taken Wednesday from Copies Now at 240 Beach St., but 
O'Hare said he waited a day before reporting the incident to the city clerk, 
hoping the boxes would reappear. 
</P>
<P>
"We allowed the afternoon to pass, hoping this was some sort of terrible 
mistake," O'Hare said. "It's hard to figure. . . . Why would someone do it? I 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
The printer, who opened in Laguna just three months ago, said a man believe to 
be an imposter left with the boxes of copied material about 2 p.m., less than a 
minute before a bona fide campaign worker arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'I need the job for Christoph for Council, so we gave him the job," 
Mehdi Zahedi recalled. "Then about 30 seconds later here came someone from 
Christoph for Council and said, "Where is the job?' and I said, 'Somebody just 
picked it up.' " 
</P>
<P>
Zahedi said the man was in his mid-40s and drove a burgundy-colored new car 
similar to a Cadillac or Lincoln Continental. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Verna L. Rollinger said Thursday that she cannot recall other such 
incidents in Laguna. Campaign workers were stunned, considering what O'Hare 
called a "relatively low-key" campaign to this point. 
</P>
<P>
He said the literature could not have been taken accidentally. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like you just picked up somebody's sunglasses at a lunch counter and 
stuck them in your pocket," he said. "This is a lot of stuff. I can't read it 
any other way than someone purposely making some attempt to disrupt the 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach police Sgt. Lance Ishmael declined to say Thursday whether a crime 
had been committed or whether a mistake was made. 
</P>
<P>
Christoph is one of nine candidates. LESLIE EARNEST

GROUPS SUE TO BLOCK 1,800-HOME PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Homeowners who filed suit against the city this week to stop an 1,800-home 
development hope a precedent set in Los Angeles will help save 727 acres of 
rolling hills in northeast Orange. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Altadena residents won a suit against Los Angeles County and halted a 
272-home project in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. A judge ruled 
that the environmental impact report for the project was invalid because the 
county had allowed the developer to conduct the environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Deborah S. Bucksbaum, who represents the Mabury Ranch Homeowners Assn. 
and the Peralta Hills Alliance in their suit against the city, also represented 
the Altadena residents. 
</P>
<P>
Bucksbaum said the Los Angeles court determined that state regulations require 
environmental studies to be prepared "directly by or under contract to" the 
city or county agency. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners' effort to reverse City Council approval of the Serrano Heights 
project is similar to the Los Angeles suit, Bucksbaum said, because the city 
allowed the Woodcrest Development Co. to hire a consultant to prepare the 
environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
"The city is relying on someone who has a financial stake in the project to 
determine what the environmental hazards are," Bucksbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
But Frank Elfend, president of Elfend &amp; Associates, the consulting firm 
that conducted the environmental review, said it is not unusual for a city to 
allow a developer hire the consultant to conduct preliminary environmental 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
Elfend said his company drafted only an initial report and then turned the 
information over to the city for changes, in accordance with state regulations. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Furman B. Roberts said late Thursday that his office still had not 
reviewed the homeowners' suit. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the homeowner groups said the lawsuit is a way to draw attention to 
their concerns about preserving wildlife and one of the city's last remaining 
ridgelines. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite all the opposition (to the project), the City Council still voted for 
this," said Lisa Lewis, whose Anaheim Hills home is near the development site. 
"So this was the next logical step. Had they given credence to what we had to 
say, we maybe wouldn't be here now." 
</P>
<P>
The plan, years in development, calls for massive grading of a ridge north of 
Mabury Ranch and south of Anaheim Hills and would require moving some 12 
million cubic yards of earth, according to planning reports. Some hills may be 
cut by up to 150 feet, while canyons may be filled up to 170 feet, according to 
planning reports. 
</P>
<P>
The project also guarantees 476 acres of permanent open space, a fully 
developed four-acre park and the extension of Serrano Avenue, providing a 
four-lane street connecting Orange and Anaheim. MARY HELEN BERG

WILLIAMS BARRED FROM USING 'MAYOR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor W.E. (Walt) Donovan has won a temporary restraining order that bars his 
opponent, City Councilman and former mayor J. Tilman Williams, from using the 
phrase "re-elect Mayor Williams" on campaign signs, with a new round in court 
scheduled today. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan said he successfully sought the order Wednesday after a woman called 
him at home and asked to speak to "Mayor Williams." 
</P>
<P>
Said Donovan: "I told her that I'm the mayor, and I'm Walt Donovan." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Superior Court Commissioner Julian Cimbaluk issued the 
restraining order that bars Williams from "publishing, circulating, (or) 
displaying" any campaign material that says he is the mayor. Williams has twice 
served as Garden Grove's elected mayor, first in 1976-78 and then in 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan was first elected mayor in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Williams denied that the large red, white and blue signs claim that he is the 
current mayor, and calls the lawsuit "another one of Walt Donovan's dirty 
tricks." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said he doesn't believe the order requires him to make any changes in 
signs now posted in the community. 
</P>
<P>
A formal Superior Court hearing on the dispute was scheduled for Oct. 31, but 
given Williams' interpretation of the order, said Richard Levine, Donovan's 
lawyer, he will be back in court today seeking enforcement of the 
commissioner's decree.JIM TORTOLANO

</P>
<P>
LEGISLATURE: VETERAN LAWMAKER SPEAKS AGAINST PROPOSITIONS THAT LIMIT TERMS, 
SAYING HE IS JUST WARMING UP. INCUMBENTS IN TWO LOCAL RACES ARE EXPECTED TO 
WIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eighty-year-old state Sen. Ralph C. Dills does not take kindly to talk of 
legislative term limits. 
</P>
<P>
A candidate for reelection on Nov. 6, the Gardena Democrat spent a decade in 
the Assembly and now has served in the Senate for nearly a quarter of a 
century. And Dills says he's just warming up. 
</P>
<P>
"I have legislators coming to me all the time for advice, saying, 'How did you 
guys do this?' and 'How did you guys do that?' " Dills said, citing his 
firsthand knowledge of numerous state legislative sessions. "I think that kind 
of experience is important to have in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
Dills, who faces Republican Timothy Poling in next month's balloting, is one of 
two South Bay state senators up for reelection this year. 
</P>
<P>
The other, Diane E. Watson (D-Los Angeles), is virtually unopposed. Her only 
challenger, Ivan William Kasimoff of the Peace and Freedom Party, could not be 
reached by telephone and is reported to have moved out of the district. 
</P>
<P>
Although Dills drew a GOP challenger, he does not appear in danger of losing 
his seat. Poling, a 25-year-old engineer with McDonnell Douglas, is a political 
novice who is short on name recognition and campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are sharp contrasts between the two candidates in the mostly 
blue-collar 30th Senate District, which encompasses Carson, Gardena, Harbor 
City, Wilmington, Paramount, Lynwood and parts of Long Beach and San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
A key arguing point is term limits, which are proposed in two of the questions 
on the Nov. 6 ballot -- Propositions 140 and 131. 
</P>
<P>
Poling supports Proposition 140, the toughest of the term-limit measures. "It 
will be healthy," he said. "It's like what we do at the national level with 
presidents." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of state legislators, Proposition 140 would limit senators to two 
four-year terms, or eight years in office, and Assembly members to three 
two-year terms, or six years in office. The limits would apply to anyone 
elected on or after Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Dills argues that if experienced lawmakers are forced from office, the 
Legislature will lose much of its institutional memory. That, he says, would 
deprive the Assembly and Senate of important guidance. 
</P>
<P>
He cites his participation in debate this year on child care policy. He says he 
drew heavily on his experience as an assemblyman during World War II, when 
child care programs were created so women could take factory jobs to bolster 
the war effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the same type of programs then so Rosie the Riveter could go to work," 
said Dills, who served in the Assembly from 1939 to 1949 and has held a seat in 
the state Senate since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Poling asserts that term limits are the only way to break the incumbents' grip 
on power, which he says has stifled electoral competition and contributed to 
voter apathy. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Dills is right that there's a potential to lose a lot of experience," 
Poling acknowledged. "But right now, incumbents are almost guaranteed to win." 
</P>
<P>
The candidates also disagree on education policy. Poling says the current 
public education system is wasting taxpayers' money. He advocates a program 
under which the government would give parents vouchers to send their children 
to public or private schools. 
</P>
<P>
"This is America, where we believe in freedom of choice and free enterprise," 
Poling said. "If public schools can't compete with the private schools, maybe 
they would change their ways or go out of business." 
</P>
<P>
Dills says the voucher system would ultimately hurt students from low-income 
families by crippling the public school system. "It's an elitist kind of thing 
that goes under the headline of parental choice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nor do Dills and Poling agree on Proposition 128, or "Big Green," the vast 
environmental initiative aimed at removing toxics from California's food, water 
and air. 
</P>
<P>
Poling opposes the measure, calling it too costly and complex. Dills supports 
it -- with some reservations about how tightened environmental controls will 
affect the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"We all like fresh air and water," Dills said, "but there is something we have 
to look at: the impact on jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Such debate is absent in the 28th Senate District, which includes Inglewood, 
Hawthorne, Lawndale, part of South-Central Los Angeles, Marina del Rey, Playa 
del Rey, Westchester and part of Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
Although heavy Democratic voter registration in the district is considered a 
key reason for the absence of competition, Watson, the incumbent, says voter 
satisfaction may also be a factor. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, Watson has emerged as a strong proponent of causes including 
abortion rights and child care. 
</P>
<P>
This year, she authored a proposal on the Nov. 6 ballot -- Proposition 151 -- 
that would allow the state to sell bonds to raise $30 million for the 
construction and renovation of child care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Her tenure has also been marked by controversy over finances. In December of 
last year, Watson agreed to pay the state more than $21,000 in fines rather 
than face a civil lawsuit alleging that she put campaign funds to her personal 
use. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, Watson has drawn praise and criticism for her role in negotiations 
that followed a student walkout in the Centinela Valley Union High School 
District in March. Critics, including district officials and the teachers 
union, have accused her of interfering in district affairs, but others see her 
activism as an effort to ease racial tensions in the district. 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried to serve the district well, to relate to every area of the 
district," said Watson, who is seeking a fourth term. "I hope that is what 
accounts for the lack of (campaign) opposition." 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;

<P>
CANDIDATES' FORUM ON SPECIAL EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight Ocean View School District board candidates speaking before parents of 
special education students proposed ways of bringing those students into the 
mainstream and improving communication with the students' families. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates' forum held Wednesday was the first ever sponsored by the West 
Orange County Special Education consortium, which represents five school 
districts in northwest Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Hunt, a nine-year board member seeking election to an unexpired, 
two-year term, said she advocates "mainstreaming these children into as many 
activities as possible," including lunchtime events and other extracurricular 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt's only challenger, Steve Buhrig, said he believes that can best be 
accomplished by channeling more money into special education programs and 
establishing a network among parents of those students. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Vanderhook, one of nine candidates for three full four-year terms being 
contested, agreed that the special education consortium should expand 
interaction among parents. But, he added, given the statewide budget 
constraints, the group should not rely only on dwindling funds from individual 
school districts. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the parents said that networking among themselves is difficult because 
districts cite privacy laws in refusing to provide names and addresses of 
parents who have special education students. 
</P>
<P>
To help improve communication, candidate Tracy Pellman said she favored holding 
district forums among parents and board members -- an idea proposed at a 
previous candidates' forum by challenger Carolyn Kanode. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's meeting, Kanode suggested that when parents agree to accept 
special education programs for their children, they fill out address cards to 
be distributed to a parents' consortium and other advocacy groups. 
</P>
<P>
Challenger Julie Engquist suggested that the district establish parent contacts 
at each school to deliver information to other parents of special education 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Challengers Lottie Hobbs and Flint Morrison also stressed communication. 
</P>
<P>
Hobbs, referring to her involvement in Ocean View's debate last spring over 
closing three schools, said that "all parents were frustrated with the 
process." When the question is addressed again next spring, she said, parents' 
specific concerns will be better addressed because firm solutions will be 
directly proposed by district staff members. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison said he supports on-site, school intervention teams to deal with 
special education problems. 
</P>
<P>
Absent were board president Charles Osterlund, a 15-year member who is seeking 
re-election, and challengers James M. Ball and Randall J. Clifford. JOHN PENNER

HIT-AND-RUN VICTIM, WITNESS TESTIFY IN DRUNK-DRIVING HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Huntington Beach woman testified Thursday that she suffered three broken ribs 
and a slashed knee when a suspected drunken driver rammed her car with his 
pickup truck and then sped away. 
</P>
<P>
Marsha Andersen, 44, credited witnesses to the July 25 accident with following 
the pickup to a nearby convenience store and then calling the police, who 
arrested David E. Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the laws are real lenient about (drunk driving)," Andersen said. "It's 
just Russian roulette driving out there." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who has a string of drunk driving arrests dating back to 1978, is 
charged with 12 felonies and seven other offenses, including giving police 
officers false names, leaving the scene of an accident, driving with a 
suspended license, and driving while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
He has done at least two stints in Orange County Jail for drunk driving, but 
was released after four separate drunk driving arrests last summer because he 
gave police false names, according to police and court records. A fingerprint 
technician finally linked Wilson's aliases and prints, and a warrant was issued 
for his arrest in August. Wilson was arrested in September in Orange, sober but 
still behind the wheel of his pickup. 
</P>
<P>
"I was appalled and surprised that . . . I was the only one he has hit so far 
-- that they know about," Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday was the second day of a preliminary hearing to determine whether there 
is enough evidence to bind Wilson over to Superior Court for trial. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's attorney, John Zitny, has indicated he will challenge the validity of 
the fingerprints and other identification. Wilson is being held in Orange 
County Jail on $100,000 bail, an unusually high amount for a drunk driving 
case. 
</P>
<P>
In other testimony Thursday, Julie Bradley of Long Beach said she saw the 
pickup leave the scene of the accident. She followed the truck for about a mile 
until it stopped at a 7-Eleven store, and then called police. 
</P>
<P>
A blood alcohol analyst for the Huntington Beach Police Department testified 
that a sample of Wilson's blood showed an alcohol level of 0.24. This is three 
times the legal limit. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors intend to prove the four drunk driving cases this summer as well as 
six prior offenses. If convicted, Wilson could face more than five years in 
state prison, Deputy Dist. Atty. James F. Bacin said.

Four people suspected of running a laboratory capable of producing more than $2 
million worth of methamphetamine were arrested Thursday evening during a drug 
raid at a house, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange police, assisted by the Inland Empire Clandestine Lab Task Force, 
obtained a search warrant and used a battering ram to enter a house in the 500 
block of South Hilda Street about 6:30 p.m., said Orange Police Sgt. Robert 
Gustafson.

<P>
Based on a tip from an informant, investigators recovered enough chemicals at 
the scene to produce methamphetamines with a street value of about $2.4 
million, Gustafson said. He added that the lab had the capacity to manufacture 
eight pounds of the drug daily, at a street value of $8,000 to $10,000 per 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
"We had information that there was a methamphetamine lab at that location," 
Gustafson said. "The four suspects were in the room where the lab was located." 
</P>
<P>
Arrested for manufacturing methamphetamines were Ricky Lee Traywick, 32, who 
lives at the house; Michael Edward Crownover, 32, address unknown; Randall Esau 
Baca, 29, of Garden Grove; and Vera Normand Henry, 33, also of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
All four were booked into Orange County Jail on $100,000 bail each. Traywick 
resisted arrest and was subdued by officers, Gustafson said. 
</P>
<P>
Recovered from the rundown, stucco tract home in a middle-class neighborhood 
were explosives, including blasting caps and a dummy mortar round, a sawed-off, 
16-gauge shotgun and four handguns. 
</P>
<P>
Glass beakers, flasks and test tubes used to produce the crystallized form of 
amphetamines were strewn across the front lawn as police searched the house. 
Investigators crawled on their hands and knees, dusting the equipment for 
fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
One task force officer, who asked not to be identified, said that disposing of 
the hazardous chemicals used to make the drug would cost taxpayers about $8,000 
for the estimated seven-hour cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a small toxic dump here," the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
The house will be sealed off and toxic chemicals will be destroyed by a private 
firm, Gustafson said. 
</P>
<P>
Police recovered a five-gallon water bottle that was full of a substance known 
as "meth-oil," the final stage of the drug before it is converted into a 
crystalline form. 
</P>
<P>
The Inland Empire Clandestine Lab Task Force is composed of officers from the 
Department of Justice, the DEA, CHP, and San Bernardino and Riverside County 
Sheriff's departments.

With less than two weeks to go in her bid to upset County Supervisor Harriett 
M. Wieder, Westminster Councilwoman Joy L. Neugebauer has raised just $25,055, 
according to a campaign finance statement filed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Of that amount, Neugebauer has just over $7,000 to carry her through the final 
week of the campaign. Still, Neugebauer, who has won most of her local 
political races with meager amounts of money, said she is not dismayed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm optimistic," she said. "I haven't even sent out my one flyer, and my 
support is snowballing. I do not intend to win this election on developer 
dollars. I will win it on my qualifications and grass-roots support." 
</P>
<P>
Wieder's latest campaign finance statement was not available. Her previous 
campaign statement, which included contributions and expenditures through Sept. 
30, showed total contributions of $259,952, and available cash of $62,380. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an incentive to work harder when . . . the incumbent will exceed a half 
million dollars," Neugebauer said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 72nd Assembly District race, Democratic candidate Tom Umberg is fast 
approaching the $500,000 mark. His latest report shows total contributions of 
$433,478, with cash on hand of $11,944. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg's overall fund raising is outpacing that of his opponent, Assemblyman 
Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), who has raised $315,719 and has $24,092 on hand. 
</P>
<P>
But Pringle, who had a fund-raiser Thursday morning featuring former White 
House security adviser Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, pointed out that Umberg had to 
raise and spend a sizable portion of his war chest during a tough primary 
battle and that the candidates are spending roughly equal amounts during the 
fall campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole issue is what's left -- cash on hand -- and I'm glad I've got more 
than he does," Pringle said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, supporters of Measure M, the proposed countywide half-cent sales tax 
for transportation projects, said their report would not be available until 
Friday. They had raised $220,000 through Sept. 30 and are hoping to finish with 
about $600,000. Opponents of the measure have not raised any money so far and 
have not filed any finance reports. 
</P>
<P>
In the race for county superintendent of schools, incumbent Robert Peterson cut 
into challenger John Dean's lead in available cash by loaning himself about 
$15,000 during October. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson has now raised $67,950 and has $6,797 remaining; Dean has raised 
$86,783 and has $7,585 left. 
</P>
<P>
In the district attorney's race, Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. Enright has 
raised $80,312 in his effort to unseat the appointed incumbent Michael R. 
Capizzi. Capizzi's campaign would not make available his figures Thursday, but 
he had raised more than $222,000 through Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of Capizzi's contributions, however, were received before the June 
primary, while Enright has received most of his money during the current 
campaign.

DEFENDANT'S MURDER CONVICTION OVERTURNED; NEW TRIAL IS LIKELY

<P>
An appellate court has overturned the first-degree murder conviction of a Los 
Angeles man found guilty in the shooting death of an acquaintance whose body 
was dumped in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling means that Luther Austin Edmonson will probably get a new trial if 
the Orange County district attorney's office decides to pursue the case. 
</P>
<P>
In a decision issued Tuesday, the 4th District Court of Appeal found that 
Edmonson was unfairly denied a request to continue his trial after being 
granted permission to represent himself by Orange County Superior Court Judge 
David H. Brickner. 
</P>
<P>
"We hold the court abused its discretion in refusing to hear the continuance 
motion," the appellate decision read. "The motion itself was based on good 
cause . . . a legitimate need for time to obtain the defense file, prepare the 
defense case and consult with newly appointed counsel." 
</P>
<P>
Edmonson, who was 41 at the time of the March, 1988, incident, was convicted of 
shooting to death Eddie Jerome Greene, 55, of Los Angeles and dumping his body 
in a ditch near Rancho Viejo Road in north San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors claimed Edmonson killed Greene over a stolen wallet. Court records 
show that Greene was shot four times in the head and twice in the shoulder and 
that blood was found in Edmonson's car. 
</P>
<P>
Dissatisfied with his defense attorney, Edmonson in February, 1989, received 
permission to represent himself in the trial with the help of a court-appointed 
legal adviser. The day the adviser was appointed, Edmonson requested that the 
trial be continued for another week, allowing the new attorney to familiarize 
himself with the case and giving Edmonson time to complete further research of 
the evidence from jail. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Brickner denied the request. The Court of Appeal found the denial 
inappropriate because the new attorney was not able to effectively 
cross-examine witnesses.

TALE OF TWO ARGONAUT BROTHERS IS FILLED WITH HIGHS AND LOWS; 
</P>
<P>
PREP FOOTBALL: ADRIAN IOJA CONTINUES TO ADD SOME KICK TO GARDEN GROVE'S 
OFFENSE. BUT HIS BROTHER, BOB, HAS LOST HIS STARTING QUARTERBACK SPOT.

GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The talented but young Garden Grove High School football team likely will 
remember this season as a bittersweet one, and perhaps nobody will see it that 
way as much as the Ioja brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Things looked good at the start. Bob Ioja, a senior, was returning as the 
starting quarterback, and Adrian, a junior, would be defensive tackle, tight 
end and kicker. 
</P>
<P>
They were billed as a talented tandem, and the Argonauts looked as if they 
might compete for the Garden Grove League title if their youth movement panned 
out. 
</P>
<P>
But since then, the brothers have been heading in opposite directions: Adrian 
has ascended, Bob has been on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
In Garden Grove's opener, a 28-24 victory over Savanna, Bob threw three 
touchdown passes, including the game-winner with four minutes to play. But in a 
10-7 loss to Mayfair, Bob struggled and split time with Simon Fuentes. Bob 
threw for a touchdown to Adrian in a loss to Laguna Hills, then had good 
statistics but not much else in a 27-14 loss to La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
At 1-3 after four games, Garden Grove was looking for changes, and Fuentes 
became the starter. He has done well enough to keep the quarterback job away 
from Bob. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Adrian has been helping to kick the offense into gear. 
</P>
<P>
He kicked two field goals, the second from 26 yards with 11 seconds left, to 
give Garden Grove a 6-3 victory over Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
The next week, he scored 23 points in Garden Grove's 35-7 victory over Los 
Amigos. 
</P>
<P>
In a 13-10 loss to Bolsa Grande, Adrian contributed a field goal and an extra 
point. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Garden Grove (3-4, 2-2 in league) is 2-1 in the past three games and 
still has a shot at the Southern Section playoffs. If the Argonauts get there, 
they can thank Adrian Ioja. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's our big play man," Garden Grove Coach Jeff Buenafe said. "He's 
come through with some big catches, he's had big tackles, and he even picked up 
a fumble and ran it for a touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Adrian's imprint matches his 6-foot-3, 220-pound frame. He has six 
touchdowns, 14 extra points and three field goals for a total of 59 points. In 
the 3 1/2 games he has played defensively, he has 27 solo tackles, eight sacks, 
two fumble recoveries and two deflected passes. He says the toughest part for 
him is going through special teams drills in practice. 
</P>
<P>
The toughest part for Bob Ioja is sitting and watching. 
</P>
<P>
This week will be his fifth in a row on the sideline when the offense is on the 
field, although he will be the first situation-substitute linebacker. Perhaps 
the toughest thing to deal with is having something you want, then having it 
taken away. But Bob admits he was not getting the job done at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't that great," Bob said. "Contributing factors? Probably it was just 
me. I don't know what happened. . . . We only throw 12 times a game; penalties 
and other things would put us in obvious passing situations, and most of the 
time (the throws) weren't on mark." 
</P>
<P>
This admission comes from someone who had been contacted by USC and UC Davis 
about his quarterbacking skills. At 6-3, 195 pounds and with a strong arm, Ioja 
showed plenty of potential. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 3 1/2 games, Bob completed 17 of 33 passes for 218 yards and three 
touchdowns. In the next 3 1/2, Fuentes completed 26 of 41 for 467 yards and 
nine touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes, a junior with quick feet and the ability to throw on the run, has been 
able to take advantage of open-field skills. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to drop back and throw," Bob Ioja said. "Our offense isn't designed for 
that necessarily. Our line is averaging about 185 pounds, so we do a lot of 
rollouts. I want to play, but I don't want to ask him (Buenafe). It's hard, but 
my brother encourages me." 
</P>
<P>
Said Buenafe: "I think it has been tough on Adrian, but he's a pretty classy 
guy. He's only 16. Bob's still doing his job too. He's playing the linebacker 
spot, and he hustles all the time. He's taken his leadership role as a team 
captain. 
</P>
<P>
"What would we be like without them? We'd be very small," he said with a laugh. 
"They're our two biggest kids."

<P>
Tackle Rick Rice and free safety Axel Paner are the long and short of Marina 
High School's defense. 
</P>
<P>
Rice, a 6-foot-3, 260-pound senior, leads the team with 45 tackles and four 
sacks, 10 quarterback pressures and blocked a field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best down lineman in the Sunset League and one of the best in Orange 
County," Marina Coach John Seely said. "I coached Joe Garten at Valencia, and 
he compares to Joe in physical skills and attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Garten is an Outland Trophy candidate at Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Paner, who barely tips the scales at 5-3 and 115 pounds, is the cornerstone of 
a secondary that has allowed only 595 yards and four passing touchdowns in 
seven games. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually give kids a chance when they come into the program as freshmen," 
Seely said. "But I took one look at Axel and said, 'This kid can't play. He's 
too small.' " 
</P>
<P>
The unlikely pair has helped establish Marina as one of the best defensive 
teams in the county. The Vikings have allowed only 45 points, second only to 
Loyola (32 allowed) in Division I play. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our goals is to be the No. 1 defensive team in Division I," Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
Another is the Sunset title. Marina (5-2, 2-1 in league) is the last obstacle 
for Edison (6-1, 4-0) in its quest for the league championship. Edison can 
clinch with a victory at 7:30 tonight in Orange Coast College's LeBard Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Marina's prospects of challenging for the title were once as remote as those of 
Paner becoming a varsity starter. Only two years ago, Marina was 0-10 and was 
held to fewer than seven points in seven games, prompting assistant Larry Doyle 
to say, "We couldn't score against air." 
</P>
<P>
Marina struggled through a 16-game losing streak and won only one game in the 
1987 and '88 seasons combined. 
</P>
<P>
"You took a lot of criticism in the classroom if you were a football player in 
those days," Paner said. "The stands were empty, and a lot of the guys wouldn't 
come out for football. It was sad." 
</P>
<P>
Rice, who was brought up to the varsity for the final game in his sophomore 
year, said the program hit rock bottom in 1988, when it allowed an average of 
28.7 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
"The program is back to the way it was when Dave Thompson was coaching here 
(1973-85)," Rice said. "If you told me two years ago that we'd be playing 
Edison for a chance at the league title, I would have said, 'No way.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rice's athletic career mirrors Marina's program. He played on a winless team in 
1988 and then experienced some success last year as a junior, when the Vikings 
tripled their victory total of the previous two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
A promising wrestling season ended when Rice was declared academically 
ineligible in March for the Southern Section championships. As a sophomore 
wrestling in freestyle tournaments for the California Jets, Rice finished 
second in the state and ninth nationally. 
</P>
<P>
But he had to buy a ticket to watch the state high school championships at 
Stockton because of his ineligibility. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurt to watch knowing I had beaten three of the four finalists in the 
heavyweight division," Rice said. "I realize I made a mistake by not taking my 
school work seriously. I never realized I could play college ball until my 
junior year." 
</P>
<P>
Paner's 4.15 grade-point average would be attractive to any college recruiter. 
But he is smaller than Seely's 11-year-old son, who serves as one of the team's 
ball boys. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't measure Axel's ability by his size," Seely said. "I'm sure most 
coaches come into a game against us thinking they're going to expose Axel's 
size. But it never turns out that way." 
</P>
<P>
Ask Foothill. Last year, Paner helped defend Jamal Duff, Foothill's 6-7, 
225-pound tight end. This year, he drew wide receiver Sean Amos, a 6-3, 
190-pound wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
"Foothill tried to run a lot of slant patterns against us," Seely said. "They 
threw a pass to Amos, and Axel put a hit on him that you could hear throughout 
the stadium." 
</P>
<P>
Paner says he has never given much thought to his size when he's on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have time to measure yourself up to other guys," he said. "I never 
think about how big the other guys are, I just try to make the tackle. My size 
was never a factor until I got to the varsity, because everybody was small and 
nobody knew how to hit on the lower levels."

NEWPORT HARBOR CAN'T HOLD TUSTIN

TUSTIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that Tustin High School's football team has cast Newport Harbor aside, the 
lingering question is: Who can beat the Tillers? 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night's game against Newport Harbor was supposed to be the biggest 
game on the Sea View League schedule for Tustin. It was, for about a half, then 
Tustin pulled away for a 25-7 victory before 3,000 fans at Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
The Tillers' method of operation was the same as in seven other victories this 
season. Contributions came from all directions. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Ron Goods gained 135 yards in 17 carries, quarterback Andy Borza 
completed seven of eight passes for 99 yards, and linebacker Aaron Gutridge 
returned an interception 10 yards for a touchdown. And Tustin turned a 7-6 
halftime deficit into a runaway. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward came the news from Tustin Coach Marijon Ancich that Tustin had never 
been 8-0 in the 68-year history of the school. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoa, this was a big win for us," Ancich said. "We have to look a little 
tougher now. Everybody's playing a little tougher against us." 
</P>
<P>
Tustin, top-ranked in the Southern Section Division VI and third-ranked in 
Orange County, is 8-0, 3-0 in league play. Newport Harbor, fighting to stay in 
contention for a playoff berth, is 5-3, 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
It was a game of odd swings. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor controlled the ball for 18 plays, taking almost nine minutes on 
its first drive, and scored on a one-yard dive by quarterback Steve Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Walker's short-range passes were flawless early. He completed his first nine. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin managed a 14-yard touchdown pass from Borza to Keve Love on its first 
drive, but Michael Stipe blocked Matt Coo's extra point try and Newport Harbor 
still led, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
But the game collapsed all around Newport Harbor in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Visko Ancich scored on a two-yard run and Borza added a one-yard quarterback 
sneak for a 18-7 Tustin lead at the end of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Stuck at his own five-yard line and aware the game was slipping away, Walker, 
who had misfired on four consecutive passes after his hot start, dropped to 
throw on first down. 
</P>
<P>
His swing pass went straight into Gutridge's waiting hands at the 10. He raced 
untouched into the end zone, the index finger on his left hand pointing No. 1 
and the ball secure in his right. 
</P>
<P>
Coo's kick made it 25-7 with 10:46 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We played a great first half," Newport Harbor Coach Jeff Brinkley said. "We 
just didn't block and tackle in the second half. It's basic fundamentals and we 
didn't do it."

UNEMPLOYMENT IN O.C. HITS HIGHEST LEVEL IN 3 1/2 YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
JOBS: THE COUNTY'S JOBLESS RATE ROSE TO 3.8% LAST MONTH WHILE JOB GROWTH FELL 
TO AN ANNUAL RATE OF 1.1%, THE SLOWEST SINCE 1982-83. LACK OF CONSTRUCTION AND 
RETAIL POSITIONS BOOSTED THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.

<P>
Unemployment in Orange County rose to its highest level in more than 3 1/2 
years in September, while job growth was the slowest since the 1982-83 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
In another strong signal that the local economy is sputtering, the county's 
jobless rate rose to 3.8% last month from 3.3% in August, the state Employment 
Development Department reported. Last month's rate, however, was still the best 
of all the state's major job centers. 
</P>
<P>
The September rate was the highest in the county since the 4.1% jobless figure 
recorded in January, 1987. Job growth in the county fell to an annual rate of 
1.1% last month. 
</P>
<P>
The sagging employment scene bolsters predictions that the county is unlikely 
to escape a national recession that economists say has either already begun or 
will do so by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in joblessness in the county last month was driven by a plunge in 
construction and retail jobs, as builders stopped launching new projects and 
retailers and tourist-related businesses laid off seasonal workers after a 
disappointing summer. 
</P>
<P>
Construction employment in the county fell by 1,200 jobs from August to a total 
of 68,400 positions in September, said Eleanor Jordan, an EDD labor market 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
The construction industry has lost 7,500 jobs since September, 1989, a 10% drop 
in total jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Retail employment, led by a decline of 1,000 jobs in retail clothing stores in 
the county during the month, fell by 2,100 positions to a total of 226,700 jobs 
from 228,800 in August, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
And tourism-related employment was off 2,200 jobs to 136,500 positions in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
But Janet Strand, an administrator with the EDD's Orange County-Inland Empire 
office in Anaheim, said there are indications that a weak summer, particularly 
among retailers, will have a lasting impact that includes less holiday hiring. 
</P>
<P>
"We just aren't seeing the early winter season hiring that usually starts about 
now," Strand said. 
</P>
<P>
Regional economists differ on how serious the local downturn will be, but they 
generally agree that the near-term trend is not favorable. 
</P>
<P>
The slowing of the county's population growth means job growth also will 
continue to decline next year, said Phillip Vincent, a vice president and 
economist for First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a weakening economy should push unemployment somewhat higher, 
he said. Vincent is predicting a 3.4% annual jobless rate for the county this 
year and a 3.5% annual rate in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said increasing unemployment has a greater impact on the economy in 
Orange County than it does in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
That's because increases in the jobless rate sometimes occur when out-of-work 
people move into an area to find jobs, swelling the labor pool. In those cases, 
however, current residents aren't necessarily losing their jobs and are still 
putting money into the economy. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, however, the labor pool is not growing, so people who lose 
their jobs are those who already live here. And that means they spend less to 
support the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman College economist James Doti says this so-called ripple effect is 
likely to be felt during the first half of next year and may be more damaging 
than Vincent and some other economists anticipate. 
</P>
<P>
Doti, who defines a local recession as a sustained period of employment 
shrinkage, said he expects one to begin no later than the first quarter of 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
He said declines in local construction will drive the economic slump and 
cautioned that the drops in construction employment in August and September 
portend deeper troubles in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
The brunt of a construction decline isn't felt for several months after it 
begins, he said, because it takes that long for the impact to ripple through 
the economy.

Downtown Riverside is getting a face-lift, and Hopkins Development Co. of 
Newport Beach is the latest Orange County developer to get a piece of the 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins, a specialist in redevelopment projects, recently won permission from 
the city to build 14,000 square feet of shops over a newly constructed 
underground parking garage near the historic Mission Inn and the city's 
convention center. 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins is also building 84 apartments and for-sale flats in the 
one-square-block area along with Wilmore City Development. 
</P>
<P>
It's the first redevelopment project in downtown Riverside to include a large 
amount of housing. That is one of the latest trends in development in Southern 
California: putting housing closer to jobs, which makes the downtown 
neighborhoods livelier at night and cuts down on automobile traffic.

The Management Game: If brokers are having to work harder for business in this 
slow real estate market, so are developers. 
</P>
<P>
One thing they're doing is turning more to managing other people's buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The latest wrinkle is a marriage between the Wolff Co., an Irvine developer, 
and the Seeley Co., a Los Angeles broker. The two formed a new company to 
manage commercial buildings and apartments in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas U. Wall is president of the new partnership, called the Seeley/Wolff 
Property Management Co., which is headquartered in Irvine. Wall had been senior 
vice president at Wolff in charge of operations and property management.

DENVER'S EXETER BUYS PINSEEKER GOLF, LARLEN 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Denver investment group said Thursday that it has hooked two small Santa Ana 
golf-products companies -- Pinseeker Golf Corp. and Larlen Inc. -- to get a 
slice of the action on the increasingly popular sport. 
</P>
<P>
The Exeter Group said it paid more than $4 million to acquire Pinseeker, a 
manufacturer of golf clubs and related equipment sold nationally through golf 
specialty shops. The Santa Ana firm has annual sales of about $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Pinseeker has been solely owned since 1976 by Michael Metzgar Sr. and has 
slowly established itself as one of the better-known small makers of golf 
clubs. Metzgar, Pinseeker's chairman, said he decided to sell the 50-employee 
company because the price was right. 
</P>
<P>
"The Exeter Group has been after me for 20 months," he said, adding that his 
company has been courted by European and Japanese firms for about five years. 
Metzgar, a former Army officer whom employees call "the Colonel," said he 
preferred to sell to an American company. 
</P>
<P>
Metzgar and his wife, Victoria, who is the company secretary and treasurer, 
will remain with the company as consultants for five years. 
</P>
<P>
Exeter acquired Larlen, a designer and importer of sportswear marketed under 
the Dache brand and sold in golf specialty stores, in a stock swap deal. Larlen 
officials declined to provide additional financial details of the sale, and 
Exeter officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Larlen has 20 employees and annual revenue of $5 million. Larlen President 
Lawrence Spitz said there will be no change in the company's management. 
</P>
<P>
The golf industry has been experiencing growing sales in recent years as the 
sport gains popularity, especially among the baby boom generation. 
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate that these acquisitions will offer numerous marketing and other 
opportunities for the combined companies and . . . will produce a stronger, 
more diversified competitor in the golf industry as golf continues its growth 
and popularity in the 1990s," said Larlen Chairman Jack Butler. The two 
transactions are expected to close around Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
The Exeter Group, founded in 1988, is a private investment group with 
principals in Los Angeles, Denver and New York.

O.C. HOME RESALES, PRICES FALL SHARPLY; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: REALTORS GROUP ATTRIBUTES SLUMP IN COUNTY AND STATE FIGURES TO FEARS 
OF RECESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In yet another indication of the slumping housing market, the California Assn. 
of Realtors reported Wednesday that sales of used single-family homes in Orange 
County slumped 31.6% in September from the same month a year ago and 17.4% from 
August. 
</P>
<P>
The association attributed the sharp drop in resales largely to a loss of 
consumer confidence stemming from fears of a recession brought on by the crisis 
in the Persian Gulf, which began in early August. 
</P>
<P>
Similar sharp drops in house sales were reported elsewhere in the state. 
Statewide, the realtors group said sales of existing single-family homes -- new 
homes are not included -- fell 27% from September, 1989, and 22.5% from August, 
1990. The statewide figures are seasonally adjusted, but county data is not. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate report Wednesday, the National Assn. of Realtors reported that 
housing resales dropped 8%. Sales were down in all regions including the West, 
where sales of existing homes plunged 8.8%. 
</P>
<P>
The California report came just two days after another survey found that sales 
of all housing units in Orange County had fallen 18.5% and prices 5.6% in 
September from the same months a year ago. TRW Real Estate Information Services 
reported Tuesday that only 3,373 housing units were sold last month and the 
average price was $246,022. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials generally have attributed the sales slump to recession fears 
that have been exacerbated since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, touching off an 
international crisis. The continuing stalemate has caused some consumers to 
stop buying big-ticket items. 
</P>
<P>
"Sales have slowed throughout California, largely because of consumer 
uncertainty resulting from the Persian Gulf crisis," said CAR president Jim 
Antt Jr. "Many potential buyers stayed out of the market in August after the 
Middle East crisis erupted." 
</P>
<P>
Another underlying weakness in the market, though, is high home prices, which 
means relatively few Californians can afford to buy a house. That's especially 
the case in Orange County, one of the nation's most expensive markets for 
single-family houses. 
</P>
<P>
In the highest price ranges, sales have slowed dramatically, the realtors group 
said. Compared to a year ago in Orange County, September's home sales fell 
31.6%. For the state, the drop was 26.5%. 
</P>
<P>
The median price of a single-family house in the county was an estimated 
$240,280 in September, up slightly from August's $239,649 but down 3.4% from 
last year's $248,610. 
</P>
<P>
Home prices statewide are falling, too. The median-priced house in September 
cost $190,350, down 1.5% from August's $193,292 and 4.2% from a year ago, when 
the median price reached nearly $200,000. It was $198,740. 
</P>
<P>
RESALE HOUSING SLIDE 
</P>
<P>
Single-family home resales are off substantially from a year ago in all regions 
but the Palm Springs area. Median prices also fell in a majority of regions, 
including Orange County.

It didn't take long Wednesday at the Forum to see that the peroxided rocker 
with the sexiest sneer since Elvis has lost little of his spunk. It was the 
opening show of Idol's first Southern California concert swing since his right 
leg was crushed in a near-fatal motorcycle accident in February in Hollywood 
(the tour stops at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa on Saturday). 
</P>
<P>
The first thing that caught your eye as you entered the 18,000-seat arena was a 
massive, mechanical fist above the stage. Painted across the fingers were the 
words "R-U-D-E D-U-D-E." 
</P>
<P>
When it was time for Idol to come onstage, the fist began slowly rotating until 
it was palm up. The joke was obvious by now. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the crowd roared with laughter as the strategic finger in the prop 
slowly started rising into the symbol that is perhaps second only to the stop 
sign in terms of international recognition. 
</P>
<P>
With the fans still cheering, Idol walked on stage in his black leather finery, 
supporting himself with a cane. The immediate suspicion was that Idol had 
overestimated his recovery powers and gone on the road too soon after his 
extensive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Within seconds of starting the first song, however, Idol raised the cane above 
his head and eventually hurled it away -- moving about the stage triumphantly 
on his own. 
</P>
<P>
If Idol's spirit was willing, however, the flesh was sometimes weak. 
</P>
<P>
Idol didn't appear to be fully recovered from the accident during the 90-minute 
performance. His mobility seemed limited -- he often skipped or hopped, as if 
regular walking were too painful -- and that took away from the energy and 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor contributing to the occasional coldness in the show was the 
absence of the old interaction between Idol and longtime sidekick Steve 
Stevens, the guitarist who left Idol's band to form his own group. 
</P>
<P>
Though the physical problem and change of band members clouded matters, the 
deeper suspicion is that this "Charmed Life" tour offers less celebration than 
past Idol visits because Idol is yet another veteran rock artist in transition: 
someone torn between having to do the obligatory old numbers (which leaves them 
a touch mechanical) and moving forward to more challenging material. 
</P>
<P>
For several years now, he has been talking about reaching beyond his colorful 
if cartoon-like image as a rock hellion to explore songs with a wider range of 
personal emotions. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the most effective moments Wednesday were unaffected by pacing or 
physical limitations: the slower, more thoughtful material from his last two 
albums. Two of those songs, in fact, served as the evening's artistic 
highlights. 
</P>
<P>
The first, "Prodigal Blues," is an affecting look at relationships and 
commitment, while "Trouble With the Sweet Stuff" is a moody, anxious reflection 
on obsession. 
</P>
<P>
While Idol is unlikely to ever abandon his sheer rock celebration,this more 
probing side is likely to play an increasingly important part of his 
repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
But it occupied a small part of Wednesday's show, not enough to allow the tour 
to live up to its promise of being the best arena double-bill since the 1988 
Aerosmith-Guns N' Roses combination. 
</P>
<P>
But the blame wasn't all Idol's. 
</P>
<P>
The package promised to be a battle of different rock generations and 
attitudes. Whereas Idol, whose own rock hero is Elvis, subscribes to the 
larger-than-life tenets of rock-star tradition, opening act Faith No More 
laughs at rock-star tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Faith No More is part of a growning number of bold and important bands that 
explore rock from so many angles -- an imaginative mix of punk independence, 
metal aggression, rap insistence and art sensibilities -- that they are 
virtually reinventing the music. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to "Epic," a song that is one of the best expressions of teen-age 
frustration since the Rolling Stones' "Satisfaction," Faith No More has made 
impressive strides toward reaching the same mass rock audience that Guns N' 
Roses found after "Sweet Child o' Mine." 
</P>
<P>
But FNM's manner at the Forum was largely indifferent, possibly because only a 
fraction of the crowd was in the seats when the band started, and most of those 
fans, judging from the T-shirts, seemed totally in Idol's camp. So Faith No 
More just seemed to get it over with. Not exactly the killer instincts you'd 
like in an up-and-coming group. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Idol and Faith No More play Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at the Pacific 
Amphitheatre, 100 Fair Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $19.50 (lawn only). 
Information: (714) 634-1300.

SINGING THE BLUES OVER SUNSET PUB'S CLOSING; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: THE SMALL BARROOM, 'THE EPITOME OF A CLUB GIG' FOR MANY MUSICIANS, WILL 
CLOSE DEC. 17. THE OWNER HAS DECIDED NOT TO RENEW THE LEASE.

<P>
The Sunset Pub, a sweaty little barroom that has been one of Orange County's 
steadiest and most active venues for live blues, rock and reggae music, is 
scheduled to close Dec. 17 when its lease runs out. 
</P>
<P>
The Pub's manager, Gabe Tellez, said Wednesday that the building's owner has 
decided not to renew the nightclub's lease, and will instead develop a new 
restaurant on the property. Property owner Anthony Plascencia could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Tellez said that he and Clint Oberholzer, the club's proprietor, are trying to 
find a new location to re-establish the Pub. The down-home, wooden-floored 
roadhouse at 16655 Pacific Coast Highway has been presenting live music for the 
past eight years, Tellez said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the band members are all looking, because they're all bummed out" about 
the Pub's imminent closing, Tellez said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pub's operators hope to find a new building somewhere between Costa Mesa 
and Long Beach, where they can try to recapture some of the flavor of the 
92-capacity bar that specialized in earthy music played in close surroundings 
on portable sound systems brought in by the acts themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Blues guitarist Coco Montoya, who has performed at major international music 
festivals as a member of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, is among Southern 
California musicians with a fond spot for the cozy Pub. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the epitome of the club gig," said Montoya, who performed monthly at 
the Sunset Pub when not touring with Mayall. "It had no stage, no PA, just a 
carpet on the floor and a big post right in the way. You'd have a pile of 
people dancing, knocking microphones over, but everybody was having a good 
time. It was a good place to get in front of a crowd that was always behind 
you. I hope they find another place, but I don't think they'll find one like 
that. It was magic, and I hate to see it go." 
</P>
<P>
Tellez said that musicians who have played at the Pub over the years have been 
lobbying for spots on its closing-night bill. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody and their mother's been calling and saying 'We want to be there to 
play the last night at the Pub," he said. "We may have to have 25 last nights 
to accommodate everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere on the club scene, activity has been sporadic, at best, for the 
independent promoters whose once-a-week concerts had for a time formed the 
backbone of the underground, alternative-rock scene in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The Rat Trap, which had presented bands every Friday night at Sargenti's in 
Costa Mesa, went on an indefinite leave of absence over the summer. Craig 
McGahey, who ran the Rat Trap with partner Steve Wagoner, said that attendance 
had slackened for the weekly shows, and that he and Wagoner became too involved 
with other business and career pursuits to keep the Rat Trap going. 
</P>
<P>
"The novelty wears off and the clubs die down. Attendance was dragging a little 
bit," McGahey said. He held out the possibility that he and Wagoner might 
resume the Rat Trap some time in the future, or promote occasional shows with 
bigger names than the grass-roots local bands that were featured at the Rat 
Trap. 
</P>
<P>
Another weekly alternative-rock club, Club Tangent, has been out of commission 
since the summer, when promoters Kitty Bash and Oct Rock lost venues at the 
Marquee in Westminster and the Pink Cadillac in Anaheim. Tangent resurfaces for 
one night tonight at the Marquee, with a Halloween party featuring Tender Fury, 
Big Drill Car and Johnny Monster &amp; the Nightmares. The promoters, however, 
have no immediate plans to resume regular shows. 
</P>
<P>
Another weekly alternative-rock soiree, Club Cannibal, will return to action 
next month with a series of Saturday night concerts at the Meadowlark Country 
Club in Huntington Beach. Promoter J.P. Boquette said that Cannibal shut down 
for about two months because of business differences with the Meadowlark's 
operators, as well as declining interest in the club, which he attributed to 
the nightclub audience's craving for new venues. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the club burned itself out. We all take turns -- everyone has their 
time. For a while the Meadowlark did (well). Now Night Moves is doing well. 
It's a big circle. (The fans) keep hopping around because they get bored. They 
need the change of atmosphere," Boquette said. 
</P>
<P>
Cannibal will resume with a Nov. 3 concert by Rikk Agnew's Yard Sale (Agnew, 
former guitarist of the Adolescents and DI, has just released a solo album on 
Triple X Records), Shattered Faith and Mother Fist. Also booked are a Nov. 10 
show with Medicine Rattle, Joyride and Root Doctors, and a Nov. 17 show with 
Trashcan School, Henchmen and Dead, White &amp; Blue. Boquette said he plans to 
shut Club Cannibal again for the holiday season, then resume shows in January.

TROUPE LEADER SEES LESSON OF HOPE IN 'EDUCATING RITA'; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: DON LAFFOON OF THE STOP-GAP DRAMA-THERAPY GROUP SEES THE COMEDY AS 
SHOWING HOW TO GO FROM VICTIM TO SURVIVOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Rita, the nearly illiterate but spirited London hairdresser of Willy Russell's 
"Educating Rita," is a woman hemmed in by circumstance. Uneducated, unexplored 
and with a husband who prefers a wife at home and pregnant, she lives a life of 
noisy desperation. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Rita's the type of woman that Don Laffoon and Stop-Gap, the Santa 
Ana-based drama therapy troupe he runs, can relate to. 
</P>
<P>
By choosing "Educating Rita" as Stop-Gap's latest production (opening a 
two-week run today at the Curtis Theatre in Brea as part of the Festival of 
Britain arts-retail promotion), Laffoon hopes to send a message to troubled or 
disadvantaged women that life is not as bleak as they may think. The group's 
work with Orange County clinics for battered women was inspirational in 
deciding to mount the play, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Rita is a valuable symbol because she finds a chance for fulfillment by 
aggressively pursuing higher learning, which Laffoon believes is as good a 
start as any. 
</P>
<P>
"To me it's all about women making choices," he said. "We can choose between 
sitting down and feeling sorry for ourselves or moving from victim to survivor. 
I'm not saying it's easy, but you have to take that first step." 
</P>
<P>
In "Educating Rita" -- which had its London premiere in 1980 and became a film 
starring Michael Caine and Julie Walters in 1983 -- Rita eagerly enrolls in a 
tutorial program where her mentor and tormentor is the sodden Frank, a 
professor and burnout case if ever there was one. It's something of a take on 
the "Pygmalion" tale, played for both humor and pathos. 
</P>
<P>
Rita finds self-awareness and opportunity, while Frank is rejuvenated by her 
earthiness and determination. There's sexual tension and a hint of romance, but 
it's all ambiguous and doesn't get in the way of Russell's main theme of 
personal expression and social and educational snobbery. 
</P>
<P>
"Educating Rita" maintains an amusing tone, a fact Laffoon finds refreshing. 
Stop-Gap (and Laffoon, who directs the productions) is associated with 
primarily serious (some might even say didactic) "message" plays, but Laffoon 
believes "Educating Rita" can't be placed in that category. 
</P>
<P>
"Happily, it's a comedy. You know, we're famous for doing plays on topics like 
incest, and I can hear people saying something like 'Oh no, Laffoon is doing 
something depressing again.' Well, this isn't anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Laffoon has been careful not to gloss over the play's implications. To 
underscore the challenges Rita faces, he has cast a black actress (Kendahl 
Thompson of Los Angeles) in a role customarily played by a white. Her co-star, 
Christopher Ward of Los Angeles, is white. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it changed the play, but added a welcome, more interesting 
texture," Laffoon explained. "'Educating Rita" was first done in the early 
'80s, but now it's the '90s, a time when all women are emerging, but especially 
minority women. To me, it was a decision that made perfect sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Willy Russell's "Educating Rita" will be performed Friday and Saturday at 8 
p.m. and Nov. 1 through 3 and 8 and 9 at 8 p.m., with 2:30 p.m. matinees Sunday 
and Nov. 4 at the Curtis Theatre, 1 Civic Center Circle, Brea. Tickets: $12 and 
$15. Information: (714) 990-7722.

RANDY LEWIS: ORANGE COUNTY ARTISTS FACE MONSTERS ALL YEAR LONG; 
</P>
<P>
LOOK AROUND ORANGE COUNTY AND YOU'LL QUICKLY SEE THAT HALLOWEEN IS BUSTING OUT 
ALL OVER.

At the top of the list is Knott's "Scary Farm's" annual Halloween Haunt, a 
three-weekend affair expected to draw maybe half a million customers to Buena 
Park, where they'll pay $25 a head to be horrified by assorted witches, 
monsters and cadavers in various stages of decay. (Rather a waste of money, I'd 
say, as the same thrill is available free with admission to the congressional 
public balcony.) 
</P>
<P>
That's only the tip of the Tootsie Pop. Anaheim is having a Halloween Parade, 
Placentia is hosting a Halloween art contest and costume parade, Tustin is 
holding a Halloween carnival, the Discovery Museum of Orange County will 
re-create a Victorian Halloween . . . even the Santa Ana Zoo is getting in on 
the antics with an animal show and trick-or-treat party. 
</P>
<P>
But I have a feeling that people in the Orange County arts community may be 
inclined to snap off the porch light, flip on the TV and say "bah, humbug" to 
Halloween this year. 
</P>
<P>
What's the point of dressing up like a monster for a night when local 
government has been treating you like Frankenstein's wayward creature all year 
long? 
</P>
<P>
It seems that the specter of taxpayer support of the arts has mysteriously 
transformed artists, who once helped enlighten our lives with their insights, 
into creepy members of the living dead. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at South Coast Repertory and the Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse probably 
would get a more hospitable reaction from their City Council if they made their 
grant requests while dressed in flowing black satin capes, rivulets of blood 
trickling from the corners of their mouths. 
</P>
<P>
Would anyone be surprised to see Costa Mesa Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis (the 
one who handed out Hostess Twinkies as part of her "Let Them Eat Cake" award 
when another councilman requested $20,000 in arts money) cast her "no" vote on 
future arts grants by driving a wooden stake through the request forms? 
</P>
<P>
While the Grove Shakespeare Festival has been given an infusion of new life 
with a $10,000 check from one anonymous arts angel, I can picture Garden Grove 
City Councilman Raymond T. Littrell stitching a new necklace of garlic cloves 
to keep off those artsy werewolves at bay. 
</P>
<P>
And what, pray, will crusaders who oppose government funding of the arts have 
to say about the city-run Fullerton Museum Center's use of tax dollars tonight, 
to help pay for back-to-back screenings of such blatantly sacrilegious films as 
"Dracula," "The Wolf Man" and "Frankenstein"? 
</P>
<P>
The way these officials act when musicians, actors and artists want a share of 
their tax tithes to be used for something besides parking meters and shopping 
malls, you'd think you couldn't hurt them more by chomping into their jugulars. 
</P>
<P>
Use a paint brush? Burn at the stake. 
</P>
<P>
But rather than give up on this spookiest of all holidays, arts folks ought to 
study it more closely and tap the potential benefit it holds. 
</P>
<P>
First, you need to remember that Halloween is a holiday that adults largely 
have purloined from the kiddies. While youngsters' trick-or-treat routes rarely 
extend these days beyond the last door at the end of the hallway, the big kids 
are throwing ever-more costly parties. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Halloween is the one time when it's acceptable -- expected, even -- 
to go around demanding something for nothing from your neighbors. The rest of 
the year, strangers who show up asking for handouts are shooed away, or simply 
have their bags of goodies confiscated by the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Struggling artists should exploit this philosophical loophole by ringing 
doorbells in our ritzier neighborhood and politely requesting greenbacks 
instead of Cracker Jack. 
</P>
<P>
A few guidelines, though: Pick a costume that doesn't appeal predominantly to 
the prurient interest, having no redeeming social, scientific or artistic 
value. 
</P>
<P>
This is to say, don't dress up as a Robert Mapplethorpe photograph, or as a 
winged Icarus (unless you include at least one airplane somewhere on your 
person). And whatever you do, don't paint your face in two different colors and 
go out as a biracial Romeo or Juliet if you want to get anywhere in this 
county. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean there's no room for creativity. My costume this year is a 
white bedsheet with two eyeholes and the words "This Is Not an Artist" written 
across the chest. 
</P>
<P>
It might be better still just to don a beard, grab a surfboard and go 
door-to-door as Orange County Republican Congressman Dana R. Rohrabacher 
saying, "Trick or treat -- Sponsorship, Not Censorship!" 
</P>
<P>
Now there's a scary way to spend an evening.

ALBANIAN REGIME EMBARRASSED AS WRITER DEFECTS, BALKAN NEIGHBORS URGE REFORMS; 
</P>
<P>
STALINISTS: TIRANA'S COMMUNIST LEADERS ARE ACCUSED OF EMPTY PROMISES.

TIRANA, Albania 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Europe's last Stalinist leadership suffered two devastating blows Thursday when 
Albania's most influential writer and reformer "demanded" asylum in France and 
its Balkan neighbors put it on notice to loosen the nation's political 
shackles. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail Kadare, a revered poet, writer and reform advocate, accused Tirana's 
Communist leaders of disillusioning the people with empty promises of change. 
Kadare, 54, is the most famous man in Albania after President Ramiz Alia, and 
his decision to give up on his homeland undermines official attempts to present 
Albania as a nation poised for democratic change. 
</P>
<P>
His action was especially embarrassing for the Tirana government as it 
coincided with the first prominent international conference in Albania. Also, 
it occurred in the rare presence of foreign journalists in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
The tightly controlled state news media made no mention of Kadare's defection, 
but word of it was expected to reach Albanians through Western television and 
radio broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
Some fear that Kadare's departure could spark further unrest among Albanians, 
the poorest people in Europe. Theirs is the only European nation still 
subjected to a rigid and repressive form of communism. More than 5,000 people 
seeking to leave the country stormed foreign embassies last July after hopes 
dwindled for a promised relaxation of totalitarian rule. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials' first reaction to Western media reports of Kadare's 
request for asylum was to denounce them as lies and provocations. Prime 
Minister Adel Carcani professed not to know of any such development. Foreign 
Minister Reis Malile suggested it was a "setup" timed to discredit the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Kadare had been at the forefront of a cautious social movement for 
liberalization in Albania, a nation of 3.3 million. His earlier historical 
works had been sanctioned by dictator Enver Hoxha, who died in 1985. Hoxha's 
acceptance gave him broader license than would have been accorded other writers 
in Albania. 
</P>
<P>
His metaphoric novels were the first shades of criticism against the entrenched 
Communist regime, and in recent interviews with the Albanian media he openly 
attacked the bureaucracy and the once-unmentionable Sigurimi secret police. 
</P>
<P>
Kadare's move, which came as a shock to Albanian officials and to the few 
citizens who had managed to learn of it, could devastate the fledgling forces 
for reform in Albania who had seen Kadare as a spiritual leader. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there will be a feeling of resentment toward him," said Mirlinda 
Angoni, a journalist with ATA, the official news agency. "He was free to 
express himself here. If they want to fight, they should stay here and fight." 
This was a reference to cultural figures capable of leading the quest for 
change. 
</P>
<P>
A delegate to the Balkan conference that ended here Thursday speculated that 
Kadare was trying to provide the people of Albania with a catalyst for change. 
</P>
<P>
"My view is that this is a move by Kadare to become the next (Vaclav) Havel," 
he said, referring to the Czechoslovak playwright, now president, whose dissent 
gave focus to that nation's pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
Albanian officials denied that Kadare had made any appeal for asylum. 
</P>
<P>
"These reports are all lies," a Foreign Ministry official, Chale Fatmia, told 
reporters. "We expect him to come back. He has said nothing against conditions 
here." 
</P>
<P>
But in Paris, a spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry, Daniel Bernard, said 
that Kadare has "demanded political asylum." He gave no other details. 
</P>
<P>
Kadare's French publisher issued a statement from the writer that said, "For 
me, the disillusionment has been more unbearable than the repression." 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, President Alia announced vague plans for reform in Albania, but a 
new election law published this week made it clear that one-party rule by the 
Communists will continue. 
</P>
<P>
"President Ramiz Alia could become the Albanian Gorbachev," Kadare said in his 
statement, referring to the Soviet president, whose reforms allowed East 
European states to break with communism last year. "People are convinced that 
if he democratizes only a little, the regime will crumble." 
</P>
<P>
Word of Kadare's appeal to the French government was spread by representatives 
of the Western media just as the foreign ministers of the six Balkan countries 
were concluding a two-day conference at which Albania joined in a declaration 
of commitment to freedom and democratic ideals. 
</P>
<P>
While Albanian participation was unprecedented, the host nation failed to win 
unconditional support from its neighbors for its effort to rejoin Europe. 
</P>
<P>
After 15 years of snubbing the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, Albania recently applied for and received observer status and has been 
lobbying for full membership. The forum dedicated to political, economic and 
human rights includes the United States, Canada, the Soviet Union and all 
European states except Albania. 
</P>
<P>
Tirana wanted the Balkan ministers to pledge their support for its membership, 
which would facilitate foreign aid and investment needed to rescue Albania's 
creaking economy. 
</P>
<P>
But the ministers made it clear that they remain unconvinced of Albania's 
commitment to democracy and want to see improvements before taking it into the 
community of nations. 
</P>
<P>
"The ministers welcomed the request of Albania for full participation in CSCE 
and expressed the wish to see it realized," the conference communique said, 
then went on to tie membership to progress on human rights.

Isolated behind the last remaining stretch of Iron Curtain, Albanians are still 
forbidden to travel or associate with foreigners. Police and soldiers are 
omnipresent in this dreariest of East Bloc capitals, and the few foreign 
diplomats in Tirana say that physical abuse of anyone expressing dissent 
continues unabated. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from Paris said Kadare had sent a message to Alia on Wednesday 
explaining his decision to leave Albania. The president, who made a splashy 
display of gregariousness at the conference opening Wednesday, was absent from 
the final session. 
</P>
<P>
Kadare was reportedly accompanied to Paris by his wife and two children. 
</P>
<P>
His novels include "Chronicle of Stone," "General of the Dead Army," "The Box 
of Shame" and a recent work, "Palace of Dreams," an allegorical denunciation of 
Stalinism about a state that monitors the dreams of its citizens.

Irish police Thursday questioned eight men arrested after IRA "human bomb" 
attacks in Northern Ireland killed six British soldiers and a civilian who was 
forced to drive a car full of explosives to an army checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
They were picked up just hours after the synchronized proxy attacks inflicted 
the heaviest casualties on the British army in Northern Ireland in two years. 
</P>
<P>
Five soldiers were killed at the Londonderry checkpoint along with a father of 
three who was forced to drive a bomb-packed car while his family was held 
hostage. He was blown to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
A 65-year-old pensioner used as the driver in the car bombing of a border post 
at Newry escaped with a broken leg after shouting a warning. A 21-year-old 
soldier died in that blast. 
</P>
<P>
A third man, tied to the seat of a car packed full of explosives, managed to 
wriggle free and escape at an army camp. The bomb failed to detonate.

Seven blacks were killed, at least one by police, and 45 people were injured 
Thursday when simmering tension in a black township near Cape Town erupted in 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
Police opened fire repeatedly during the day as crowds of up to 10,000 blacks 
gathered illegally in demonstrations demanding the resignation of Mali Hoza, 
the black township mayor of Khayelitsha. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, the main black 
opposition group, accused Hoza of corruption and of siding with President F. W. 
de Klerk's white minority government. 
</P>
<P>
Tension has been high in Khayelitsha since last week's slaying of Momsa 
Mapongwana, wife of an anti-apartheid leader in the township 20 miles east of 
Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the violence broke out shortly before midnight Wednesday when an 
explosion started a fire at the town council building. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters extinguished the blaze, but police said township residents then 
began hurling stones at police officers, who fired back with tear gas, rubber 
bullets and birdshot.

KASPAROV AND KARPOV AGREE TO A DRAW IN 6TH CHESS GAME

Champion Garry Kasparov and challenger Anatoly Karpov agreed to a draw Thursday 
in Game 6 of the world chess match. 
</P>
<P>
Kasparov enters today's scheduled seventh game with a 3 1/2-2 1/2 point lead 
over Karpov. 
</P>
<P>
Game 6 was adjourned Wednesday night after 41 moves. Kasparov's delegation 
notified the chief arbiter Thursday that he was offering a draw, and Karpov's 
delegation accepted before Kasparov's sealed last move, Re8, was put on the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Until Karpov, playing black, made a knight retreat on the ninth move Wednesday, 
the sixth game duplicated the opening sequence of the second and fourth games. 
In the earlier games, however, Karpov chose to develop a bishop on the ninth 
move. 
</P>
<P>
On moves 12 and 13, Kasparov exchanged a pair of pawns and a pair of rooks. On 
move 14, he advanced his queen pawn, which clogged up the center of the board. 
With his 17th move, Kasparov launched an attack against one of Karpov's 
weakened queen-side pawns. 
</P>
<P>
Kasparov sacrificed one of his pawns on move 25 to get more active play for his 
pieces, particularly his white squared bishop. This piece was important to his 
attack on Karpov's king side.

SENATE PANEL DENIES TALK OF IMMUNITY FOR KEATING; 
</P>
<P>
ETHICS: LAWMAKERS CALL REPORTS OF SUCH DISCUSSIONS INCORRECT. THE COMMITTEE 
INVESTIGATING FIVE SENATORS ASKS FOR A PROBE INTO DOCUMENT LEAKS. 
</P>

<P>
Leaders of the Senate Ethics Committee denied Thursday that the committee has 
ever considered granting limited immunity from prosecution to former savings 
and loan executive Charles H. Keating Jr. to obtain testimony about his links 
to five senators. 
</P>
<P>
With public hearings set for next month in the politically charged case, the 
committee issued a statement saying it "has at no time discussed or considered 
granting immunity" to the former head of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of 
Irvine, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"Reports to the contrary are incorrect," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The Times, citing unnamed sources on the committee, reported Thursday that the 
possibility of giving court-approved immunity to Keating was under 
consideration but that members of the panel recognized that such a step would 
endanger any future federal prosecution of Keating. 
</P>
<P>
These sources insisted on Thursday that their original information was correct, 
explaining that the idea had been considered by some members of the committee 
and key staff aides, although views on the idea apparently were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said that many in the group felt that while Keating's testimony 
might be desirable and dramatic, it was not essential to the upcoming hearings 
-- and therefore was not worth imperiling the prosecution of a man whose 
alleged fraudulent management of Lincoln may wind up costing taxpayers an 
estimated $2 billion. The failed thrift has been seized by the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The committee statement Thursday reflected the fact that Chairman Howell Heflin 
(D-Ala.) and Vice Chairman Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.) had rejected the immunity 
notion "out of hand" without letting it come before the panel for official 
consideration, according to one source. 
</P>
<P>
"They felt it was a terrible idea," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Keating had been summoned before the panel earlier this year in closed session 
and, upon the advice of his attorney, had refused to testify. He cited his 5th 
Amendment protection against self-incrimination at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has the legal authority to compel such testimony by applying to a 
federal judge for a grant of immunity protecting the subject from being 
prosecuted on the basis of any information he discloses to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department must be given 30 days notice before such a grant is 
given to allow the department time to persuade a congressional panel to abandon 
its request. Such grants often complicate or thwart later prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the committee said it had asked the General Accounting Office to 
investigate leaks of sensitive committee documents relating to its 
investigation of the five lawmakers, including Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
The panel said "an outside organization" such as the GAO, the auditing and 
investigating agency of Congress, would be best suited to conduct the leak 
probe because "some of these disclosures may have come from the committee 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
The panel said it "will not speculate upon motives, but does observe that such 
conduct discredits the individuals responsible and violates the committee's 
rules." 
</P>
<P>
The investigative materials that surfaced last week showed that three of the 
senators -- Cranston, Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and Sen. Donald W. Riegle 
Jr. (D-Mich.) -- had taken more extensive actions to petition federal thrift 
regulators on Keating's behalf than previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
Cases against the other two lawmakers -- Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) and Sen. John 
McCain (R-Ariz.) -- are considered weaker. Because McCain is the sole 
Republican under scrutiny and because the leaked documents focused on Cranston, 
DeConcini and Riegle, some Democrats have charged that the leaks were motivated 
by partisanship. 
</P>
<P>
In rules to govern the hearings that the panel issued Thursday, each senator 
will be afforded a chance to make an opening statement. Witnesses to be 
presented by Robert S. Bennett, the committee's special counsel, may be 
cross-examined by lawyers for all of the senators. 
</P>
<P>
Each senator also may present witnesses on his own behalf.

Jon Grunseth, the gubernatorial challenger in trouble over reports he swam nude 
with teen-age girls in 1981, announced late Thursday he will stay in the race 
after planning earlier to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here tonight to withdraw from this race," Grunseth told about 100 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"But there has been just an incredible outpouring of love . . . and prayer for 
this family that has overwhelmed both Vicki (his wife) and me. We are going to 
press forward no matter (what)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said earlier that Grunseth would 
withdraw on the condition that the party's 325-member state central committee 
name his successor on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Grunseth kept reporters and anxious supporters waiting for hours as he huddled 
with advisers far past 7 p.m., the time he set for a news conference at which 
he had been expected to announce his withdrawal from the race. 
</P>
<P>
Grunseth had been running close to Democratic incumbent Rudy Perpich before 
Oct. 15, when two women charged in sworn statements that Grunseth encouraged 
them to join him in a nude swim in 1981, when they were 13 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
Grunseth, 44, denied the allegation but had been under increasing pressure from 
his party to quit the race. He had consistently vowed to remain on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The source in the Grunseth camp said Grunseth would throw his support to Cal 
Ludeman, a Tracy farmer and former state legislator who was the Republican 
candidate for governor in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Ludeman scheduled a news conference for later Thursday in the same Bloomington 
hotel, but it was never held. 
</P>
<P>
The Grunseth partisan said Grunseth did not want to automatically hand the GOP 
spot on the ballot to Arne Carlson, who launched a write-in campaign on Monday 
after losing to Grunseth in the Sept. 11 primary. 
</P>
<P>
Grunseth, who considers himself a moderate-conservative, had said Carlson, a 
leader of the moderate wing of the party, is not acceptable to him as the 
party's candidate.

LAS VEGAS MAGLEV RAIL PLAN ABANDONED; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: INCREASED COSTS, DELAYS ARE BLAMED FOR THE DECISION. ORGANIZERS 
SAY SOUTHLAND PROJECTS COULD BE HIT BY SIMILAR PROBLEMS.

<P>
A plan to build a mile-long magnetic levitation rail line in downtown Las Vegas 
to demonstrate the utility of the new technology has been abandoned, the victim 
of unexpectedly high costs and bureaucratic delay. 
</P>
<P>
The demise of what would have been the first maglev line in the Far West comes 
as uncertainties are being expressed about the feasibility of much larger 
proposed maglev projects, including a Las Vegas-to-Anaheim high-speed line and 
one between Los Angeles International Airport and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Las Vegas plan was not linked to those, its organizers say they 
encountered many of the problems that could dog the larger efforts. 
</P>
<P>
In a magnetic levitation system, trains riding on a slight cushion of air are 
propelled along a guideway by electromagnetic forces. Plans call for speeds 
exceeding 200 m.p.h. on high-speed lines, but the maximum speed on the short 
Las Vegas line would have been about 45 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview this week from his offices in Pittsburgh, John Kapala, 
president of Magnetic Transit of America, a subsidiary of AEG-Westinghouse 
International, said the decision to break off construction in Las Vegas, 
leaving a few barren columns and a single nearly completed station, was made by 
German entrepreneurs who recently bought into AEG. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been working on this program for five years," Kapala said. "There were 
a lot of delays that increased the costs of the program. It took a long time to 
get the approval of the Nevada Public Service Commission. We also had trouble 
with rights of way and local approvals. . . . It just got to the point where it 
was no longer economically viable to proceed." 
</P>
<P>
Kapala said the cost originally was projected at $56 million. He would not say 
what the projected cost was at the end, but knowledgeable sources in Las Vegas 
said it was more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Just as with the proposed maglev projects in California, the Las Vegas train 
was supposed to be funded entirely through the private sector, with the 
government contributing only rights of way. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, some private promoters have said that because of the tight economy, 
now is not the best time to solicit investments for largely untried new 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
But promoters say fast government approvals are needed to keep costs from 
soaring because of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Only two weeks ago, at a meeting of the California-Nevada Super Speed Train 
Commission, which is charged with the Las Vegas-Anaheim high-speed train, an 
official of the Bechtel Corp., the franchisee designated to build that project, 
warned that expedited legislative and other approvals are needed if that line 
is to secure investors. 
</P>
<P>
Before Bechtel could go ahead, approval of the California and Nevada 
legislatures would be necessary. The company has been given about a year to 
study the feasibility of the Las Vegas-Anaheim line. 
</P>
<P>
Kapala said that Las Vegas city authorities were as helpful as possible to the 
would-be builders of the one-mile line, but county officials and the business 
community on the Las Vegas Strip were less helpful. A proposed eventual 
extension of the downtown line down the middle of the strip did not win 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the area itself, Las Vegas, the county, the businessmen, are in 
unison on how to proceed with traffic projects, and until they are, I don't 
think anyone will be successful," said Kapala. 
</P>
<P>
A Japanese-owned firm, the HSST-Nevada Corp., has proposed a larger local 
maglev project serving the strip and the McCarran Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Most city officials declined comment on the downtown line. Tom Graham, the 
city's director of design and development, said only, "The company had rights 
to terminate, if it was determined it wasn't feasible, and they so determined."

ACTIVISTS BLAST WILSON OVER RIGHTS BILL VETO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local black and Latino activists and leaders of women's groups on Thursday 
directed their wrath over the death of a major civil rights bill toward Sen. 
Pete Wilson, whose vote to uphold a presidential veto of the bill proves, they 
contended, that he is not fit to be governor of a multicultural California. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Duff, president of the Los Angeles branch of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People, said his organization is gearing up to ensure 
that Republican candidate Wilson is "held accountable" in the upcoming 
gubernatorial election for his role in sustaining the veto, which was upheld by 
one vote on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The NAACP does not endorse candidates and we are not partisan" said Duff. "But 
we will make it clear to voters that he is against civil rights." 
</P>
<P>
Duff said details of the strategy will be formulated this weekend in Riverside 
at a previously planned meeting of California NAACP officials. 
</P>
<P>
James Lee, a Los Angeles-based spokesman for Wilson's campaign, said Wilson 
"did not vote to uphold the veto of a civil rights bill. He voted to uphold the 
veto of a quotas bill." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the bill, and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne 
Feinstein, are criticizing Wilson for upholding the veto, with Feinstein 
charging that he cast "the deciding vote against this historic measure." 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Bruce, president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Organization 
for Women, said she is urging NOW supporters to deluge the President and 
Congress with letters, telegrams and phone calls protesting the actions of the 
president and the U.S. Senate, which failed to override Bush's veto of the 
Civil Rights Bill of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he vetoed the measure, which would have reversed or altered six 
recent Supreme Court decisions, because he believed it would have led to hiring 
quotas for women, African Americans and ethnic groups that traditionally have 
been the victims of employment discrimination. Supporters of the bill have said 
that assessment is inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
Latino activists said they are planning a series of meetings on how to deal 
with elected officials when a revived version of the measure is introduced in 
Congress, some hope as early as next year. A day before the Senate override 
vote, a coalition of Latinos held a news conference in Los Angeles and 
denounced Wilson for not supporting the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Alicia Maldonado of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund 
(MALDEF) said Wilson "could have been the key vote" in overriding the 
presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Ridley-Thomas, director of the local branch of the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference, said Wilson has sent "a very clear message" to women and 
members of ethnic groups. "We ought to respond to it accordingly and cause him 
to live with the consequences in ways that he will never forget." 
</P>
<P>
Lee, asserting that Wilson's record on civil rights is unassailable, said the 
wrath now directed against him in the governor's race is no more than partisan 
politics.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Elements of the ad, with analysis by Times political writers Cathleen Decker 
and Bill Stall 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The race: Governor. Whose ads? Democratic candidate Dianne Feinstein. Cost: The 
campaign would not say, but a single display of a 30-second ad in the Los 
Angeles market costs from $20,000 to $40,000, depending on air time. Producer: 
Bill Carrick and Hank Morris. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein launched three new 30-second television commercials this week that 
attack Republican Sen. Pete Wilson on his voting record in the Senate and his 
handling of sewage treatment facilities while mayor of San Diego. They also 
promote Feinstein's record against violent crime while mayor of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Elements of the ad, with analysis by Times political writers Cathleen Decker 
and Bill Stall: 
</P>
<P>
Ad: Tom Noble, president of the California Assn. of Highway Patrolmen, tells 
the viewers, "The California Assn. of Highway Patrolmen and over 40,000 law 
enforcement officers endorse Dianne Feinstein because of her record on crime." 
As a list of endorsements scrolls across the bottom of the screen, he adds: 
"According to the FBI, when Dianne Feinstein was mayor, she reduced violent 
crime by 20%. The FBI also looked at Pete Wilson's record, and found that 
violent crime increased by more than 100% when he was mayor of San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: The 40,000 officers cited in the commercial include members of major 
police labor organizations that have endorsed Feinstein, including the Highway 
Patrol association, the California Organization of Police and Sheriffs and the 
Southern California Alliance for Law Enforcement, an umbrella organization. The 
endorsement of the groups' leaders does not, however, guarantee the vote of the 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has also earned an armload of police endorsements; his staff has 
distributed a three-page list of endorsements from police officers' 
associations, correctional officers' groups and sheriffs' agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The crime statistics cited in the advertisement come from annual FBI summaries. 
The FBI did not specifically "look at Pete Wilson's record." 
</P>
<P>
According to the FBI numbers, crime overall went down in San Francisco by 27% 
during Feinstein's tenure. Violent crime -- murder, manslaughter, rape, robbery 
and aggravated assault -- went down more than 21%. During Wilson's terms in San 
Diego, the FBI statistics showed, crime went up overall by 25.5% and violent 
crime went up 115.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: The commercial opens with an empty red chair. The word "absent!" flashes on 
the screen. "How does Pete Wilson vote?" an announcer asks. "Not enough. On the 
Souter Supreme Court nomination? Absent. On the Iraqi crisis? Absent. On three 
different death penalty votes? Absent. Pete Wilson has the worst attendance 
record in the U.S. Senate." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: The vote to confirm David Souter to the Supreme Court and two 
measures dealing with the Iraqi crisis occurred earlier this fall, when Wilson 
was campaigning in California. The death penalty votes occurred on primary 
election day, when Wilson was in California to vote, and in 1988, when he was 
campaigning in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, citing the Congressional Quarterly as her source, said that Wilson 
has cast only 226 of 297 votes through Oct. 22, for a 76% voting record, the 
worst in the Senate. Congressional Quarterly said Wilson voted 91% of the time 
in 1987, 85% in 1988, and 92% in 1989, a figure Wilson uses in his own campaign 
commercials. However, that 92% is a relatively poor record, since many senators 
are in the 98% range. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "He says he votes when it matters. Like Wilson's tie-break vote to cut your 
Social Security benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: That mention is a direct attack on a Wilson ad that praises the 
senator's voting record, noting that he voted even when he had to be wheeled in 
on a stretcher after an emergency appendectomy. The Wilson ad does not mention 
-- and this ad does -- that the stretcher vote was one to eliminate a Social 
Security cost-of-living adjustment. The vote did not break a tie -- it created 
one, which then-Vice President George Bush broke by voting to cut the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: As a copy of a Los Angeles Times article appears on the screen, the 
announcer says, "But this month he couldn't stop campaigning long enough to 
cast a tie-breaking vote to kill an anti-choice abortion amendment." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: The reference is to an Oct. 12 motion to kill an amendment that would 
require parental notification for some abortions. Wilson said he would have 
voted against the amendment, but he was in California campaigning. The senator 
has said that his staff did not have enough advance notice of the vote to 
enable him to get back to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: The screen flashes the words "Pete Wilson's $2.3-billion mistake" and shows 
a photo of San Diego Bay with the blue water turning to red. The announcer 
says, "Pete Wilson's $2.3-billion mistake. Mission Bay, San Diego. It's a sea 
of red ink because Pete Wilson ignored San Diego's sewage problems and tried to 
avoid the federal Clean Water Act." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: While Wilson was mayor, he objected to Environmental Protection 
Agency requests that San Diego build a secondary sewage treatment facility that 
would remove about 90% of the solids from waste water before ocean disposal. 
Wilson cited Scripps Institute scientists as saying secondary treatment was 
unnecessary, a view supported by the San Diego chapter of the Sierra Club. San 
Diego obtained a temporary waiver from this requirement of the Clean Water Act. 
The city now is planning a new treatment plant. Originally, the plant was 
estimated to cost $500 million. Estimates now run up to $2.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: Flashing on the screen: "Pete Wilson's Legacy: Ignored Sewage Problems. 
Avoided Clean Water Act. 1,800 raw sewage spills. Quarantined, one day in 
four." The announcer says, "The result: 1,800 raw sewage overflows in five 
years. And a bay that was quarantined one day in four." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Wilson did not necessarily ignore the city's sewage problems but 
sought a waiver from the Clean Water Act, as did many other American cities. 
The U.S. Department of Justice and the regional state water quality control 
board said that more than 1,800 sewage spills occurred in the San Diego system 
in a five-year period after Wilson had left the mayor's job. The spills were 
attributed to a variety of causes.

AD RE-ENACTS POLL GUARD CONTROVERSY; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: COMMERCIAL ENCOURAGES LATINOS TO VOTE. IT CRITICIZES 1988 INCIDENT IN 
WHICH ORANGE COUNTY GOP HIRED GUARDS WARNING NON-CITIZENS AGAINST VOTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Voting isn't supposed to be scary. 
</P>
<P>
But it was for some Latinos in 1988, when 20 uniformed security guards hired by 
the Republican Party in Orange County stood guard at polling places in some 
predominantly Latino neighborhoods. Some guards held signs written in Spanish 
and English warning those who were not citizens that it was illegal to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Now, some hard-edged advertising is taking a second look at the controversy. 
The campaign, created by a Los Angeles production company and filmed in Santa 
Ana, encourages Latinos to vote in the Nov. 6 election. It makes its point in 
both Spanish and English versions by essentially re-creating the events of two 
years ago that have since resulted in civil and criminal actions. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-second commercial, which began airing this week on several 
Spanish-language and cable TV stations in Los Angeles and Orange counties, 
shows Latino voters who are confronted by ominous-looking security men at the 
polls. A narrator states, "In 1988, some politicians tried to prevent you from 
voting by scaring you away from the polls." 
</P>
<P>
Then, the narrator says, "What's next?" The ad then shows stern-faced security 
guards watching over Latinos at hospitals, schools, and even keeping tabs on 
children at a playground. 
</P>
<P>
"We fought back and won," the narrator says, in reference to the $400,000 that 
the Orange County Republican Party paid to five Latino voters in a settlement 
of a civil lawsuit after the incident. "Don't be afraid. Please come out and 
vote." 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs donated some of the damages from the suit -- nearly $50,000 -- to 
pay for the ad campaign. Besides the black-and-white TV ads, there also are 
radio spots and billboards. 
</P>
<P>
The man who directed, filmed and co-wrote the TV spot said he had a 
particularly strong motivation. "I was born in South Africa," said Michael 
Oblowitz. "And I was never a fan of this kind of intimidation. I brought a lot 
of my experience into play in this commercial." 
</P>
<P>
Oblowitz, who may be best known in the United States for directing music videos 
for Carly Simon and Smokey Robinson, directed an award-winning 1979 documentary 
on Nelson Mandela -- long before many Americans were familiar with the leader 
of the African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The rather grainy, stark look of the commercial is similar to that in 
videotapes of the 1988 incidents that Oblowitz studied before creating the ad. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, filming of the commercial at Santa Ana High School was 
abruptly halted when some school officials objected to the school becoming the 
commercial set for what they felt had become a political issue. The commercial 
was completed at a nearby church. 
</P>
<P>
Why is this commercial running two years after the incident? 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned that some people who heard about this incident might be scared 
away from voting," said Lowell Finley, partner in the San Francisco law firm 
Remcho, Johansen &amp; Purcell, which filed the suit on behalf of the Latino 
voters. "If this were to fade from memory, there's nothing to stop it from 
seeping back into future elections."

LIQUOR INDUSTRY TO COMPLY WITH RULING ON ADS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under pressure from the state's Fair Political Practices Commission, alcoholic 
beverage interests agreed Thursday to revise their political advertisements so 
they disclose that their major backers are beer, wine and liquor interests. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the industry said the radio and television ads opposing Proposition 
134 and supporting Proposition 126 will be re-edited to include the financing 
interests. Proposition 134, backed by health and law enforcement groups, 
substantially increases beer, wine and liquor taxes. The industry's Proposition 
126 only modestly increases the taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to fully comply with the FPPC's order even though we don't agree 
their order is legally correct," said campaign spokesman John Jervis. 
</P>
<P>
The industry's decision came as the controversy over political advertisements 
that fail to disclose their true backers heightened with several campaigns 
filing lawsuits and others making formal complaints to the commission, which 
acts as the state's political watchdog. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy erupted this week when the alcohol industry, through its 
political organization, Taxpayers for Common Sense, used an apparent loophole 
in the state law to avoid disclosing its backing of the commercials on 126 and 
134. Although the law generally requires that the disclosure be made in ballot 
measure advertisements, lawyers contended full disclosure could be avoided if 
the content of the ad dealt equally with two initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
However, the commission ruled Wednesday that the industry had to make full 
disclosure because it was not dealing with two initiatives as set by the law 
but with an initiative, Proposition 134, and a measure placed on the ballot by 
the Legislature, Proposition 126. 
</P>
<P>
Once the alcohol industry's ads hit the airwaves, other campaigns moved quickly 
to air similar commercials. The commission has said it will examine those ads 
but has yet to make any additional rulings. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of Propositions 131 and 140, measures limiting the terms of 
lawmakers, aired spots featuring actress Angela Lansbury that failed to show 
major financing was being provided by incumbent legislators and political 
committees organized by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and 
Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Political advertisements by supporters of Proposition 130, an environmental 
measure, omitted identifying their prime backer as millionaire investment 
manager Hal Arbit. The ads also mentioned Proposition 138, a rival measure 
backed by the timber industry. 
</P>
<P>
And most recently, anti-tax groups began running commercials on Propositions 
136 and 137 without naming the alcoholic beverage industry as a major financial 
backer. Proposition 137 requires a public vote on any changes in laws governing 
initiatives and Proposition 136, among other things, rewrites tax law to 
mandate a two-thirds vote by the people to raise special, or single-purpose, 
taxes. If Proposition 136 passes it could nullify the vote on Proposition 134, 
the tax measure opposed by the alcohol industry, providing that proposal does 
not receive a two-thirds vote. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, an author of Proposition 131, 
filed suit against the campaign backed by Brown and Roberti and against 
television stations KGO in San Francisco and KCBS in Los Angeles. The lawsuit 
complained that the ads as aired by the two stations were illegal because it 
was not the intent of the law to provide any loophole to avoid disclosure. 
Furthermore, the suit said, even allowing for a loophole, the ads violated the 
law by devoting a majority of their content to Proposition 131. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the suit was announced, KCBS officials said they were suspending 
broadcasting of the advertisement until the legal questions are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the Truth in Initiative advertising act should not apply to 
broadcasters, but rather to committees and individuals who act in support of or 
opposition to initiatives," said Robert Hyland, station vice president and 
general manager. He said he was confident of a court victory because "the First 
Amendment would prohibit its application to broadcasters." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, opponents of Proposition 136 filed a complaint with the 
commission contending that about 85% of the ads for that campaign were devoted 
to 136 and only 15% to Proposition 137. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the proponents of Proposition 136) are masquerading as ma and pa 
homeowner who are being overtaxed when really they are ma and pa Coors who 
don't ever want to pay their fair share of taxes," said Steve Hopcraft, of 
Californians Against Initiative Fraud, the campaign against 136.

GOLDEN STATE FWY. SNARLED BY CAR-TRUCK ACCIDENT IN NEWHALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One person was injured and southbound traffic on the Golden State Freeway 
backed up four miles this morning in Newhall when a car slid underneath a big 
rig trailer and then crashed into another truck, the California Highway Patrol 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The 8 a.m. accident just south of Calgrove Boulevard forced the closure of 
three lanes for about an hour, CHP Officer A. J. Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP said Michelle LeClair of Valencia was driving south on the freeway at a 
high speed when she swerved to her right to avoid a slower-moving car in her 
lane. LeClair's convertible Ford Mustang crossed one lane and then went 
underneath the trailer of a tractor-trailer rig driven by Ron Read, 38, of 
Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
"She went completely under the trailer and through and then hit a truck that 
was next to it," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
The second tractor-trailer rig was driven by Willie Mann, 57, of Ontario. The 
Mustang rebounded from the collision and partially went back underneath the 
trailer driven by Read, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustang was dragged underneath the trailer, which was carrying a load of 
frozen pies, about 100 feet before it came to a stop. LeClair was trapped in 
the wreckage for about 20 minutes before being removed by Los Angeles County 
firefighters and taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital for treatment of 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The accident closed the southbound freeway to one lane for nearly an hour. 
Torres said traffic backed up to McBean Parkway before two lanes were reopened 
about 9 a.m. The fourth lane was opened about 10 a.m.

BUSH URGES VOTERS TO SET TERM LIMITS; 
</P>
<P>
AT IRVINE STUMP, HE BLASTS DEMOS FOR BUDGET WOES 
</P>

<P>
As Congress approaches a resolution to the budget negotiations that have 
strained voters' patience, President Bush said in a breakfast visit to Orange 
County this morning that the way to avoid the same problem in the future is to 
limit the terms of politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts the power back into the hands of the people," he told an audience in 
Irvine gathered to raise money for Republican gubernatorial candidate Pete 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"That is one way to correct the abuse of power and the unbridled influence of 
an entrenched congressional staff," he said. "I say it's an idea whose time has 
come." 
</P>
<P>
Like Wilson, Bush called for support of Proposition 140 on the Nov. 6 
California ballot. Fueled by public frustration with the budget controversy as 
well as recent political scandals in Sacramento and Washington, polls indicate 
Proposition 140 has tapped a well of frustration among the electorate and 
appears likely to pass. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, a career politician and the son of a U.S. senator, added that the same 
policy should be applied to members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1988 Republican platform supports limiting the terms of members of 
Congress," he said. "That was 1988, we're not just jumping on the bandwagon; 
that was in our platform." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who was still in Washington to vote on the budget agreement still being 
negotiated in Congress, did not attend the breakfast in his honor. But he 
talked to the audience through an amplified telephone. 
</P>
<P>
And like Bush, he praised Orange County as the seat of California's Republican 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a political party, like a nation, should have an elite fighting 
force," Wilson said. "Well, in California for Republicans, ours is in Orange 
County." 
</P>
<P>
Bush repeatedly blamed the Democratic-controlled Congress for the budget 
problems facing the nation and said several times that the only solution is to 
elect more Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"So my appeal to you is -- you in this county who hold so much of the fate of 
all these statewide candidates in your hands -- let's get out our vote on Nov. 
6 and let's make Pete Wilson the next great Republican governor in the state of 
California," Bush said. "Go to work, get out and vote." 
</P>
<P>
The President was joined at the head table by three other Republican statewide 
candidates: state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), running for 
lieutenant governor; Treasurer Thomas Hayes and Matt Fong, nominee for state 
controller. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was scheduled to attend a luncheon fund-raiser for Wilson in Los Angeles 
today and then travel to Hawaii tonight. He is scheduled to appear once more 
for Wilson in San Francisco on Monday before returning to Washington.

JAIL FOR D.C. MAYOR BARRY; 
</P>
<P>
6-MONTH TERM, $5,000 FINE IN DRUG CASE 
</P>

<P>
A judge sentenced Mayor Marion Barry today to six months in jail and a $5,000 
fine for his conviction on a cocaine possession charge, saying the chief 
executive of the nation's capital gave "aid, comfort and encouragement to the 
drug culture." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered the three-term mayor to one 
year on probation after his release from prison and ordered him to undergo 
periodic drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
Because he was convicted of a misdemeanor, Barry will not be forced to 
relinquish his office before his term ends Jan. 2. Under city law, he can also 
continue his bid for the at-large City Council seat in the Nov. 6 elections. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, asked later by telephone about his sentence, said: "I should have 
been shocked and stunned, but I'm not. I understand that there are different 
sets of standards for different people, and that's the American injustice 
system." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would continue his bid for a city-wide council seat, Barry 
responded, "Absolutely. Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
Jackson found that Barry engaged in a "willful attempt to obstruct justice" by 
lying to a grand jury about his drug use, a charge that makes jail time 
mandatory under U.S. sentencing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he will let the government decide in which prison Barry will be 
incarcerated. He allowed Barry to remain free on his personal recognizance. 
Barry's lawyers said he will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
As he stood before the judge, Barry said, "I stand here remorseful, and I ask 
this court to impose community service as a sentence." 
</P>
<P>
Before the sentencing, Barry told the judge that he was nervous. 
</P>
<P>
"My stomach is in knots," he said. "I am prepared and have been prepared to 
take full responsibility for my actions. These actions were out of character." 
</P>
<P>
He admitted his former dependence on alcohol, Valium, an anti-depressant and 
cocaine, saying, "I believe I've led an exemplary life since Jan. 18," the day 
of his arrest. He said it was the 279th day he was free of any drug. 
</P>
<P>
The sentencing ended a 10-month legal drama that began with the mayor's arrest 
Jan. 18 in an FBI sting operation that caught him on videotape smoking crack 
cocaine with a former girlfriend.

Germany's new Communist Party admitted today that its treasurer had secretly 
transferred abroad $70 million, trying to save it from being confiscated by the 
Bonn government. 
</P>
<P>
The treasurer, Wolfgang Pohl, took responsibility for the transfers to a Soviet 
front company and has resigned, party spokesman Hanno Harnisch told the ADN 
news agency. 
</P>
<P>
The unauthorized movement of the money prompted a police raid on the party's 
headquarters last week. 
</P>
<P>
The vast property and financial holdings of the Party of Democratic Socialism 
(PDS), successor to the Socialist Unity Party (SED) of the former East Germany, 
have been placed under control of a government trustee agency. 
</P>
<P>
The Bonn government and Berlin justice authorities said the PDS had broken the 
law by transferring cash to accounts in the Netherlands and Norway without the 
agency's permission.

A gale blew a dredge into the only bridge to Hatteras Island today, severing 
the span and stranding thousands of people without power. 
</P>
<P>
The island's estimated 5,000 residents and an unknown number of tourists had no 
way off the island. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry connections via neighboring Ocracoke Island could not be used because 
winds were gusting to 60 m.p.h., creating waves of five to seven feet in 
Pamlico Sound. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported in the crash, which collapsed a 250-foot section of 
the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge, severed utility lines that run along it and 
grounded the dredge Northerly Island. Another 50-foot section of the bridge was 
in danger of falling, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The 2 1/2-mile-long bridge connects Hatteras Island with Bodie Island to the 
north along North Carolina's Outer Banks. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way to get across that bridge. It's gone, collapsed," said Gwen 
White, Dare County public information officer. 
</P>
<P>
The accident knocked out electrical and telephone service to Hatteras Island 
and to most of Ocracoke Island, located to the south and accessible only by 
ferry. 
</P>
<P>
Renee Hoffman of the state Emergency Management Division said authorities were 
trying to figure out how to get temporary electrical service set up. It was 
hoped that ferry service could be re-established within 24 hours, she said this 
morning. Repairing the bridge could take months. 
</P>
<P>
Dare County Commissioner Gaskill Austin, who lives on Hatteras Island, said 
residents were "literally in the dark out here" but were used to minor power 
outages because of the frequent storms. 
</P>
<P>
"A big need will be generators . . . and to save as much foodstuffs as we have 
here in the stores," he said via ham radio. "That and the water is my primary 
concern."

Thousands of demonstrators marched on Parliament late today to protest the 
proposed dispatch of troops to the Persian Gulf, in the latest expression of 
anger over the government bill. 
</P>
<P>
Chanting "Protect the peace constitution," the marchers walked about 1 1/2 
miles through busy downtown boulevards before gathering in front of the Diet, 
or Parliament. They were led by members of the opposition Socialist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said 30,000 had been expected, but police put the number at about 
10,000. The demonstrators were kept near the curb by a large detail of police 
and marched peacefully.

Democratic and Republican leaders in the House struggled today to persuade 
their members to vote for large tax increases, little more than one week before 
congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
The taxes are part of a five-year, $500-billion deficit reduction package that 
was expected to come to the House floor late today or early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The package, which is aimed at cutting $40 billion from the deficit this year, 
encountered last-minute disagreements between Democrats and Republicans over 
increases in costs for Medicare health insurance and several other issues. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not there yet, but I believe we will be able to reach agreement," Senate 
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said. 
</P>
<P>
House Democratic Caucus Chairman Steny Hoyer of Maryland said Democrats could 
not push the budget through on their own and were counting on help from the 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is close," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some congressional sources warned that if the final agreement does not reach 
the floor by late today, the precarious majority being assembled in the House 
might begin to fall apart. 
</P>
<P>
This would be a major blow for both Congress and President Bush and plunge the 
entire budget negotiations into disarray.

House and Senate negotiators early today agreed to give President Bush the debt 
relief he seeks for Egypt but at the same time defied the President by slashing 
aid to El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
After an all-night and often stormy bargaining session, the two sides set up a 
difficult choice for Bush: swallow a 50% cut in military aid to El Salvador or 
lose his bid to have Egypt's $6.7 billion in past military debt forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
Both provisions are part of a $15.5-billion foreign-aid bill for the fiscal 
year that began Oct. 1. The bill covers economic and military support for U.S. 
friends and allies around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The erasure of Egypt's debt, intended to reward Cairo for its leadership in the 
Arab response in the Persian Gulf crisis, was offered as a powerful incentive 
for Bush to accept the package.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev traveled to Spain today and immediately 
embarked on negotiations to receive about $1-billion worth of credits in 
Spanish consumer goods desperately needed by the beleaguered Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, accompanied by his wife, Raisa, landed shortly before 1 p.m. at 
Madrid Airport, where he was received by socialist Prime Minister Felipe 
Gonzalez and Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the main subject of business will be an estimated $1-billion 
credit package that would be used by the Soviets to buy Spanish consumer goods 
and industrial equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish newspaper El Pais said the Spanish side has offered to increase the 
sum to $1.5 billion, but officials at Gonzalez's office declined to comment on 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
The six-day European swing will also take Gorbachev to France, and to underline 
his intent on active European diplomacy, the Soviet leader was accompanied by 
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared and want to share actively in all European issues, including 
the new security structure, and pan-European system of interaction in the 
economy, ecology, energy, information and culture," Gorbachev told El Pais.

A senior European Community official said that Japan's trade barriers are 
costing European producers $3 billion a year in lost exports and warned that if 
the obstacles remain, they could hurt Japan's auto exports to the EC. 
</P>
<P>
Horst Krenzler, director-general of external relations and trade policy, spoke 
at a news conference today after two days of high-level talks with Japanese 
officials on trade, economic problems and science and technology. 
</P>
<P>
"We pleaded strongly that Japan push forward with more market-opening. Only 
this would create a favorable climate to solve other problems such as auto 
imports into the EC after the single market in 1992," Krenzler said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the EC's chronic trade deficit with Japan was intolerable and that 
Japan's response in the talks had been disappointing. No concrete steps had 
been taken to remove Japanese obstacles to imports, he said. 
</P>
<P>
EC figures show the Japanese trade surplus with the Community in the first nine 
months of the year was $13.1 billion, compared with a $19.8-billion surplus in 
all of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The EC wants Japan to abolish the trade restrictions and cut import tariffs on 
processed food, fish products and leather.

Daily News managers published and tried to distribute a newspaper today using 
non-union replacement drivers who ran a gantlet of protesters throwing rocks 
and bottles. 
</P>
<P>
Police reported at least two minor injuries and at least 11 arrests, including 
two men held after a delivery truck was firebombed. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of today's paper, reduced to only one edition, were trucked out of the 
printing plants -- about three hours late -- under police escort. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known how many were printed and delivered, but the News 
was absent from some mid-town Manhattan and suburban railroad station 
newsstands during rush hour. The paper said 920,000 copies were distributed 
Thursday morning, down from its normal daily circulation of 1.18 million. 
</P>
<P>
Half a dozen pickets marched outside the News headquarters this morning, and 
union leaders stood outside to direct workers to go home. 
</P>
<P>
The strike called Thursday night at the nation's second-largest metropolitan 
daily newspaper capped a 10-month dispute over management's efforts to gain 
more control over money-losing operations. 
</P>
<P>
Police in riot gear escorted delivery trucks out of a Daily News printing plant 
in Kearny, N.J., through hundreds of strikers and their supporters hurling 
bricks, stones, eggs and bottles. 
</P>
<P>
One truck was firebombed in neighboring Harrison, N.J., but no injuries were 
reported. Two men were arrested shortly afterward in Kearny on charges of 
possession of three Molotov cocktails. 
</P>
<P>
Another man was arrested for allegedly throwing rocks at a truck at the Kearny 
plant. "He was the only one we could catch," Kearny police Capt. Anthony 
Gouveia said. "It was ugly out there." 
</P>
<P>
Strikers broke the windows of a News truck in Brooklyn, and the driver was 
taken to a hospital for treatment of facial injuries, a police spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She said other strikers pelted a News truck in Manhattan, causing the driver to 
lose control and hit two parked cars. A security guard inside the truck 
sustained minor injuries in a scuffle with two strikers. 
</P>
<P>
Six people were arrested, mostly on charges of disorderly conduct, outside the 
Long Island plant, and two were arrested outside the Brooklyn plant, where a 
fireworks-style explosive was ignited beneath a truck. 
</P>
<P>
Eight unions with about 1,800 members went on strike, and the Newspaper Guild 
said its 800 members would honor picket lines, including one at the main News 
offices in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Management crews produced today's edition. Its lead headline concerned a police 
crackdown on drug dealing near city schools, but a smaller headline beneath it 
said "Unions Strike News" and had a picture of a News delivery truck burned 
after a dispute Thursday that triggered the strike. 
</P>
<P>
Contracts for all 10 of the newspaper's unions ran out in March, and 
negotiations have stalemated. 
</P>
<P>
John Sloan, Daily News vice president for labor relations, said replacement 
workers from other Tribune Co. papers in Orlando, Fla., and Chicago were being 
flown to New York. 
</P>
<P>
New York's other two tabloids planned to increase their press runs today. The 
New York Post, which normally prints about 625,000 copies, expected a press run 
of 850,000 to 860,000. New York Newsday was expected to increase its press run 
from about 250,000 to about 400,000.

Milwaukee Brewers left-hander Teddy Higuera, who filed for free agency earlier 
this week, had a small bone chip removed from his right kneecap during an 
operation this morning at Sinai-Samaritan Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery was performed by Brewers team physician Paul Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
Higuera was bothered by injuries during the 1990 season and finished 11-10 with 
a 3.76 ERA in 27 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Higuera, a 20-game winner in 1986, will be hospitalized overnight. He 
reportedly turned down a three-year, $9-million contract from the Brewers 
before filing for free agency. He made $2.125 million in 1990.

Born in San Antonio, Texas, Sanders was involved in football most of his life.

Buster Douglas -- bigger than life, much bigger than life -- fell with an awful 
thud Thursday night. Once the hope of every underdog, Douglas will now be 
remembered as a fluke, a fraud, a bloated myth. When his bubble burst, you 
could hear the sound for miles. 
</P>
<P>
It was an awful thing to watch, Douglas lumbering into the ring, all 246 pounds 
drooping from every part of his body. You could see Evander Holyfield's eyes go 
wide at the sight of this slow-moving, ponderous target. 
</P>
<P>
This was the conqueror of Mike Tyson? 
</P>
<P>
Well, no. They kept telling us you never knew which Douglas would show up on a 
given night, and the one we saw Thursday night was a guy who obviously got lost 
on the way to the 99-cent, all-day breakfast. This was the guy who lost to Mike 
White, to Jesse Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Douglas gave away his title in favor of chicken necks, his meal of 
choice. With the heavyweight title and millions of dollars at stake, Douglas 
couldn't make himself get up from the table. No wonder he couldn't get up from 
the canvas, although it seemed that he might have struggled to his feet. 
Douglas, who has been accused of quitting, will hear the accusations again. 
</P>
<P>
Was that February night in Tokyo when Douglas knocked out Tyson really a fluke? 
Now, we'll never know. We won't know if a fit Douglas, who came in at 231 
against Tyson, could have beaten Holyfield. We know that a fat Douglas was no 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
There could not have been more of a contrast between the fighters, who, when 
standing beside one another, looked like a before-and-after ad for Gold's Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas hit Holyfield only once in three rounds. Everyone figured he would lean 
on Holyfield, using his weight to his advantage, but he couldn't get close 
enough. Holyfield kept beating him to the jab, aiming at the ample gut. And 
when Douglas missed with a wild uppercut, he left himself wide-open for a short 
Holyfield right hand that sent Douglas crashing to the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas lay flat on his back, the only way he could be lying flat. He kept 
rubbing his face, although it couldn't have been in disbelief. From the opening 
bell, this result seemed assured. It took Douglas two minutes to rise, just 
before the paramedics' specially built crane arrived. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Douglas didn't even bother to apologize. He said he wasn't 
embarrassed, and explained that he didn't get into his rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping to get some rounds under my belt," said Douglas, who did, 
however, get everything else under his belt. 
</P>
<P>
"If you live by the sword, you die by the sword." A sword? How about a steak 
knife?

Canadian singer Gordon Lightfoot sent a check for $2,500 after a group raising 
funds for a new ice-skating and hockey arena asked for an autographed item for 
a celebrity auction. 
</P>
<P>
Superior made Lightfoot an honorary citizen when he performed last year at 
nearby Duluth, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Herb Bergson said it would have taken quite a few items to produce as 
much money for the Superior Amateur Hockey Assn.'s arena as Lightfoot's check 
did. 
</P>
<P>
Bergson said the city was honoring Lightfoot for his song "The Wreck of the 
Edmund Fitzgerald." Residents of Superior died in 1975 on the ore-carrying 
ship. 
</P>
<P>
The hockey association needs about $60,000 to put the finishing touches on the 
arena, Bergson said.

LIZ SMITH: SPIELBERG RUMORED TRYING TO SALVAGE 'BONFIRE' FILM

"CONSEQUENCES, shmonse-quences, as long as I'm rich," said Daffy Duck. 
</P>
<P>
HOLLYWOOD IS roiling with rumors about Warner's movie "The Bonfire of the 
Vanities." It was bought and filmed to great hoopla from the famous Tom Wolfe 
book of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
Now, those who've seen first cuts of the Bruce Willis-Tom Hanks starrer say 
either that it is "brilliant" or "weird." Purists who appreciated the novel 
will be in an uproar of dismay. (Well, hell, we already knew that.) And the 
final rumor is that Steven Spielberg has been called in to re-edit it. The film 
was directed by Brian De Palma. 
</P>
<P>
STEVE FORBES, now the head of the family clan, is settled into Daddy Malcolm's 
mantle. He and his brothers will host a big one this Sunday aboard the Forbes 
yacht Highlander to honor former President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan. The focus of 
the occasion is again the building of the Reagan Library. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the Forbes boys tried to give this party, Reagan was having brain 
surgery and could not attend. He and Mrs. Reagan will be there in person this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
RAN INTO the adorable Blair Brown the other day at NBC where she was getting 
ready to brave being on the Letterman show. Blair is both glad and rueful that 
her series "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd" is winding down. The final 13 
episodes will be seen beginning in January on the Lifetime Channel. What Blair 
liked best about doing "Molly Dodd" was that the work kept her in New York near 
her 8-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
What I can report about Blair, an uncommonly intelligent and sensitive actress, 
is that her romance with publisher-tycoon Mort Zuckerman has come to an end 
along with "Molly Dodd." Now they'll just be friends. 
</P>
<P>
LET'S GET serious! William Safire wrote of the budget mess and Congress vs. the 
President and vice versa: "The current impasse is no cause for national 
embarrassment; on the contrary, it is the overdue surfacing of basic political 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Well, OK, Bill -- though I'm not sure the loss of world confidence in the 
dollar and the economic blow to U.S. prestige is "no cause for national 
embarrassment." I do, however, want to quote a thoughtful and major financial 
brain who prefers to remain nameless. He said to me recently: 
</P>
<P>
"Give George Bush more credit and a little time. The so-called budget mess had 
to happen. The U.S. economic picture has to grow this dark, this dim, this 
threatening. It's the only way, after all the selfish profligate bingeing and 
excesses of the '80s. Think of it all as slamming the brakes on at 80 m.p.h. 
Unpleasant, but necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"Only really dramatic events could bring us up short to convince us that the 
Ronald Reagan free ride is over. It is indeed darkest before dawn. Now we can 
get serious and start recovering; now we can get real about taxing and cutting 
spending by the government." 
</P>
<P>
THE ODDEST and most endearing book in your bookstores is William Morrow's 
"Shirley and Marty," the story of actress Shirley Jones and her wacky hubby, 
Marty Ingels. (He is a onetime actor, comic and now an entrepreneur of 
celebrity endorsement.) These two have quite an opposites-attract tale to tell. 
I loved it.

BATMAN HAS A NEW BOY WONDER WEARING A BRAND NEW WARDROBE

Rest easy, Gothamites, Batman has a new Robin. The Caped Crusader, who saw his 
sidekick blown to bits by the Joker two years ago, has found somebody to fill 
the Boy Wonder's shoes -- although the footwear and the rest of his outfit are 
new. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Drake, who turned up at stately Wayne Manor one year ago, is now Robin No. 
3. Drake joins Bruce Wayne's alter-ego this month in Batman comic No. 457, 
where he manages to rescue Batman and Vicki Vale from the clutches of the 
psychotic Scarecrow. 
</P>
<P>
The third Robin, you say? Yes. The original, of course, was Dick Grayson, who 
now works as a solo super-hero called Nightwing. His successor, Jason Todd, was 
murdered in Batman No. 428. 
</P>
<P>
Like his predecessors, Drake is an orphan taken in by millionaire Wayne. "I 
think it's part of the job description," DC Comics spokeswoman Martha Thomases 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Drake -- who used his powers of deduction to figure out that Bruce and Batman 
were one and the same -- has been hanging around the Batcave for the last year 
handling the more mundane aspects of crime-fighting. 
</P>
<P>
But the folks at DC Comics decided the time was right for a replacement Robin. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the last year, he has proven himself mentally, morally, spiritually and 
physically capable of taking over," Batman editor Dennis O'Neil said Thursday. 
"Today is his rite of passage." 
</P>
<P>
Robin should also help Batman psychologically. The crime-fighter "would soon 
skew into a nasty insanity if he did not have someone . . . to maintain a link 
with common humanity," O'Neil said.
