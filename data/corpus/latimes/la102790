Photo, Safe Deposit: A police officer searches one of two men arrested Friday 
morning after they were seen speeding through Canoga Park, dragging a 
6,000-pound safe behind their car in a shower of sparks. The locked safe, taken 
from the sidewalk in front of a closed lock shop, was empty, police said. The 
suspects told police they had heard rumors that the safe contained $6,000.

NO LONGER SO COUNTED OUT; 
</P>
<P>
CENSUS BUREAU AGREES TO NEW PROCEDURE FOR ADDING UP ASIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time since 1860 when the Census Bureau began counting Asians in 
the United States, the federal government is finally making a long-overdue 
effort to get a more accurate measure of America's fastest-growing ethnic 
group. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau recently disclosed it will break out Asians as a distinct 
category in data recently collected to adjust for undercounts of minorities in 
the 1990 Census. 
</P>
<P>
This change is particularly important to western states, especially California, 
where Asian and Pacific Islanders account for about 9.5% of the state's 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials routinely conduct what is called a "post-enumeration survey" 
after the formal census is completed. The purpose of the survey is to identify 
undercounts in states and big cities. Asian-American activists had voiced 
strong objections to the Census Bureau's original decision in June to confine 
undercount efforts to three categories: blacks, non-black Hispanics and all 
others. The bureau initially argued that Asians and Pacific Islanders compose 
such a small percentage of the total U.S. population -- about 3% -- that an 
undercount would not be detected. 
</P>
<P>
But that was wrong. Census officials changed their tune after they found that 
the recently completed survey of 150,000 households nationwide yielded a larger 
sample of Asian and Pacific Island households than expected. 
</P>
<P>
The survey will help identify undercounts of these groups in California, 
Oregon, Washington, Alaska and Hawaii, as well as New York City. These counts 
are crucial in ensuring that Asians get their fair share -- particularly in 
federal funding and in representation in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980 Census significantly undercounted minorities: almost 10% of the Latino 
community; 9% of African-Americans and 7% of Asians. The new efforts should 
narrow such discrepancies. Now it's up to the secretary of commerce to go ahead 
and incorporate the undercount data in the final 1990 Census report. He should.

DETECTIVE KUSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to take this opportunity to thank The Times for the tributes paid 
my husband, Detective Russell Kuster. I would also like to thank all the many 
friends and strangers who have sent cards, flowers and donations to the Russell 
Kuster Foundation and the Los Angeles Police Memorial Fund. 
</P>
<P>
My thanks, also, to Chief Daryl Gates who, I think, dies a little himself every 
time he loses one of his policemen, and my thanks as well to the entire police 
network. They have been my lifeline. 
</P>
<P>
My Russ was my heart. This man, who described himself as a "simple, basic man," 
was passionate in his love for his family, friends, Police Department and his 
country. Wasn't everyone? 
</P>
<P>
I recently received a letter from a reporter who had interviewed Russ about a 
case he was working on. He said he asked Russ if he was ever afraid for his 
life. Russ' response was, "I would rather give my life than be afraid to give 
it." That was Russ. 
</P>
<P>
He was the bravest man I ever knew -- he was always my hero! My thanks again to 
all the caring people. Care enough and maybe it won't have to happen again.

THE CRUEL POLITICS OF THE BUDGET; 
</P>
<P>
SO LITTLE HAS BEEN PRODUCED BY SO MANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the never-never land called Washington, late into the deep of last night, 
Congress was still debating the merits of the latest federal deficit reduction 
plan. Which one was it again? The one that socked it to the rich? The one that 
had lower capital-gains tax rates that were said to make the rich even richer? 
The one with higher tax brackets and the same personal exemption schedule? Or 
the one that allowed fewer exemptions? 
</P>
<P>
You can't remember? Well, don't develop an inferiority complex. There were 
probably at least a few politicians last night who couldn't remember, either. 
It's not Alzheimer's disease you're suffering from but Budgetheimer's: This is 
the progressive, arguably irreversible Washington disease characterized by 
degeneration of economic brain cells. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that if Washington isn't shaken by the many months of tortuous 
budget politicking, the country may be. Even voters with a low expectation of 
politics must be struck by a process that has produced so little by so many 
over such a long period of time. Are there any lessons? 
</P>
<P>
For the Republicans, the lesson is that the fairness issue is a potent one in 
American politics. The genial Ronald Reagan, in his genius, managed to skirt 
its raw power but the less charming George Bush is now feeling its sting. The 
distinguished commentator Kevin Phillips, whose page one essay in tomorrow's 
OPINION section lays out Bush's problem very well, recently published a book 
that described the pent-up earthquake of the fairness issue. Its force is not 
such to suggest that America is tending toward the kind of ideology-bound 
society that suffocated Eastern Europe until recently. But it is to suggest 
that the notion of tax progressivity is a strong one and the politician who is 
any less of a wizard than Reagan ignores it at his peril. 
</P>
<P>
Another lesson is that the President needs better, basic, hard-core 
in-touch-with-reality domestic political advice than he has been getting from 
his handlers. Washington correspondents reported this last week that the 
President enlisted the counsel of long-time trusted adviser James Baker, who of 
course has been serving as the U.S. Secretary of State. Perhaps the pragmatic 
but clearheaded Baker was able to set the President straight. His current 
domestic staff is not up to the task. 
</P>
<P>
Rooting for the president to regain control of his political destiny is not to 
side with one political party over the other. It is to express the wish that 
the nation not have to endure the prospect of yet another failed Presidency. No 
doubt many Democrats are gleeful over the writhing of the Republicans in their 
political agony. And all's fair, one supposes, in love, war and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But with more than 200,000 American troops on an Arabian peninsula facing a 
well-armed and arguably fanatical military foe, it would be comforting to think 
of the White House in terms other than besieged, faltering, troubled. The 
relationship between domestic and foreign politics is never remote.

FARRELL'S VOTE ON SMOKING BAN IN RESTAURANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With their vote against a smoking ban, members of the Los Angeles City Council 
place restaurateurs' wealth concerns above their constituents' health concerns 
(Part A, Oct. 17). If the restaurant owners said the only way they could make 
money was to use plates made from cheap uranium waste that would keep food warm 
without using expensive energy, or perhaps asbestos napkins that would last a 
long time and survive careless flambeau chefs, would the council still side 
with the owners? The risks are probably no worse than tobacco smoke. 
</P>
<P>
The argument that people will dine somewhere else might have had some 
legitimacy in Beverly Hills where it's hard to be more than two miles from the 
border, but that is not the case in Los Angeles. Our city should set the 
example which would allow smaller cities the freedom to follow suit.

Since the proposed smoking ban in Los Angeles restaurants was defeated because 
of anticipated economic hardships, perhaps Los Angeles nonsmokers should stop 
patronizing their local eateries for awhile.

I wonder how long area restaurants would stay in business then.

STATE TAX POST; 
</P>
<P>
SHERMAN'S WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Equalization is an obscure but powerful state agency whose 
innocuous name doesn't come close to describing its many purposes. The four 
elected members of the board, joined by the state controller, administer major 
tax laws, including sales, cigarette, alcoholic beverage and motor-vehicle fuel 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The board sets assessments for utilities and railroads, determines the degree 
of property- tax conformity among the counties and sits as the nation's only 
elected tax-appeals board, hearing personal and corporate appeals from the 
Franchise Tax Board. It is specialized work, demanding specialized skills. 
</P>
<P>
There are two major candidates running for a four-year term in District No. 2, 
which takes in all or part of 16 counties from Los Angeles to San Francisco. 
Both candidates are energetic and indicate a keen interest in tax issues. 
</P>
<P>
Claude Parrish, 43, the Republican candidate, is a former small business owner 
who is now an independent investment banker and real estate broker. Brad 
Sherman, 36, is a tax lawyer, a certified public accountant and a tax-law 
specialist. Parrish has previously been a candidate for Congress, school board 
and the Board of Equalization. Sherman, a longtime Democratic political 
activist and advocate of consumer rights and tax reform, is making his first 
run at elective office. 
</P>
<P>
Our choice, in a close call, is Brad Sherman. He has shown an impressive 
familiarity with the often arcane details of tax law, and he would undoubtedly 
bring a high level of professionalism, vigor and integrity to the board.

FOR SECRETARY OF STATE: EU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's secretary of state interprets and enforces election laws. The 
state's chief elections officer also handles the filing of numerous corporate 
documents. Secretary of State March Fong Eu has handled all of these diverse 
responsibilities well enough that she should be returned to office. 
</P>
<P>
Eu and her capable staff are especially knowledgeable about voter registration 
and have worked to make the process more convenient. Under her leadership, 
California became one of the first states to adopt registration by mail. Eu 
also advocated, although unsuccessfully, automatic registration at the offices 
of the Department of Motor Vehicles and state agencies. She remains committed 
to accessible voter registration. 
</P>
<P>
As overseer of the California State Archives, Eu persevered to finally persuade 
the Legislature and governor to replace the leaky, old storage area with a new 
state archives building to house irreplaceable documents. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these accomplishments, there is room for improvement and more vigorous 
leadership. Eu's most prominent challenger, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan 
Milke Flores, has pointed out that Eu has relaxed most of the fines assessed 
for late campaign reports. Most fines have been levied against novices and 
third-party candidates who do not file late intentionally. The fines have been 
relaxed across the board; in fact, one of Eu's challengers got a fine reduced 
from $100 to $10. In spite of the broad reductions, Eu's office has collected 
$400,000 in fines during her tenure but the office could -- and should -- 
collect more. 
</P>
<P>
There is also the troubling matter of fines assessed against Eu's own campaign. 
As Eu has admitted, there is simply no excuse for late filings from a secretary 
of state. There is the even more troubling reduction of Eu's penalties. To 
avoid a possible conflict, Eu's chief deputy has refrained from ruling on those 
fines; a civil servant has made those decisions. To avoid even the appearance 
of a conflict, Eu's campaign should pay full freight on all future fines. 
</P>
<P>
On balance, March Fong Eu has done a credible job since she was elected to the 
post in 1974. We recommend Eu for another term.

Novak instructs us to quit "bashing the rich" since "most people got richer" 
last decade. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't agree more that we should "cut the hypocrisy." 
</P>
<P>
Since The Times reported July 24 that the richest 1% of Americans got 87% 
richer last decade while the poorest 20% got 5% poorer (making the widest 
rich-poor gap in 40 years), I suggest we do a lot more than bash the rich and 
the political system that supports them. Let's cut the hypocrisy and find a way 
to disenfranchise the selfish rats so that our country can care for its 
desperate needs. Then they can "put up or shut up."

Your headline said that the "rich" were to be taxed by the proposed House 
budget. After reading the article, I found that the "rich" were those people 
making more than $50,000. Just whose definition of rich is this? The idea that 
anyone making above $50,000 a year is rich is a lie.

<P>
Well, I want to thank Dave for clearing things up for me. I was under the 
misconception that teams like the A's, Reds and Yankees of the '70s were great 
teams simply because they consecutively won World (Series) championships. But 
now, Dave, I'll have to change my view. You've made it obvious that winning 
isn't the indicator of true greatness, but rather how often a team gets into a 
position to win a championship.

What must we faithful Dodger fans do to get Darryl Strawberry dressed in blue? 
I read he wants to come to the Dodgers and then I heard it from his own mouth 
on television. Surely the Dodger front office can come up with a solution that 
will make Strawberry, the Dodgers and the fans extremely happy in 1991.

Rick Zombo and Sergei Fedorov scored goals eight seconds apart in the third 
period, lifting Detroit past Minnesota, 8-6, keeping the Red Wings undefeated 
at home and the North Stars winless on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit had a season-high 47 shots against goaltender Kari Takko, who was 
recalled Monday from Kalamazoo of the International Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
Takko was 4-0-1 with a 2.00 goals-against average at Kalamazoo. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings (6-3-2) tied a club record set in 1962 with their sixth 
consecutive home victory to start a season. They are 0-3-2 on the road. The 
North Stars (2-7-2) are 0-5-1 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Zombo's first goal, at 4:42, broke a 4-4 tie. Jimmy Carson started the play 
with a shot from inside the blue line that Takko blocked. Bob Probert's rebound 
also was stopped but Zombo scored off the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
Fedorov took a pass from Brent Fedyk and shoveled it past Takko from between 
the circles for his fifth goal.

Pete Sampras, playing in his first ATP Tour event since becoming the youngest 
U.S. Open champion in history Sept. 9, defeated David Wheaton, 7-6 (7-3), 5-7, 
6-4, Friday to reach the semifinals of the $1.1-million Stockholm Open. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras has been sidelined by shin splints. 
</P>
<P>
Other quarterfinal winners included Stefan Edberg and Boris Becker. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, the world's top-ranked player, outlasted No. 7-seeded Brad Gilbert, 
6-4, 3-6, 6-1, before 12,350 at the Globe Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, who has lost only one indoor match this fall, to third-ranked Ivan 
Lendl in Japan early last month, beat No. 9-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of 
Yugoslavia, 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras will play Alexander Volkov of the Soviet Union in the semifinals. 
Volkov beat 1989 world junior champion Nicklas Kulti of Sweden, 6-2, 6-1, in a 
match between unseeded players. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Jennifer Capriati defeated qualifier Maria Strand- lund of 
Sweden, 6-1, 6-4, to advance to the semifinals of the $150,000 Puerto Rico Open 
at San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
No. 6 Gigi Fernandez defeated Audra Keller, 6-1, 4-6, 6-4, to set up a 
Capriati-Fernandez semifinal today. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Zina Garrison outlasted No. 8 Ann Grossman, 7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 6-1, and 
unseeded Carrie Cunningham also advanced when she defeated upstart Argentine 
Florencia Labat, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati defeated Meredith McGrath, 6-3, 6-2, in a match postponed Thursday 
because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf defeated Nathalie Tauziat, 6-2, 6-4, to advance to the semifinals 
of a WITA indoor tournament at Brighton, England. 
</P>
<P>
In today's semifinals, Graf meets Catarina Lindqvist of Sweden, who beat 
Italy's Cathy Caverzasio, 6-2, 6-3. Third-seeded Helena Sukova also moved into 
the semifinals with a 6-1, 6-1 victory over Sara Gomer of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Debbie Graham saved three match points against UCLA's Kimberly Po 
and went on to join two Stanford teammates in the semifinals of the 
All-American Championships at the Riviera Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, the 1990 NCAA singles champion, beat Po, 6-3, 3-6, 7-5, in the second 
round. Po led 5-4 in the third set and was ahead 40-15 in the 10th game before 
Graham rallied. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, who had match point against Monica Seles before losing in the 
semifinals of an exhibition tournament last summer, then beat Caryn Moss of 
Georgia, 6-4, 6-3, in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Graham will face Emilie Viqueira of California in today's semifinals. The other 
match will pit defending champion and second-seeded Sandra Birch against 
Heather Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Birch, the 1989 NCAA champion, eased to victories over Iwalani McCalla of UCLA, 
6-2, 6-3, and Lisa Albano of California, 6-2, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Willens upset fourth-seeded Shannan McCarthy of Georgia, 4-6, 7-6 (8-6), 6-3, 
in the second round and then beat qualifier Sakolwan Kacharoen of San Diego, 
4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Viqueira defeated No. 3-seeded Trisha Laux of USC, 5-7, 7-5, 7-6 (7-5), in a 
four-hour marathon in the second round and then beat Kansas' Eveline Hamers, 
6-0, 6-1, in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Fromberg, a clay-court specialist, and John Fitzgerald were named to a 
preliminary Australian team for the Davis Cup final against the United States 
Nov. 30-Dec. 2 at St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
They join Pat Cash, a former Wimbledon champion, Wally Masur, Darren Cahill and 
Mark Kratzmann, who were members of the Australia team that defeated Argentina, 
5-0, in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Fromberg is the highest-ranked Australian singles player at 28th on the ATP 
Tour computer, and has won two clay-court tournaments this year. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald gets another chance after missing the semifinal against Argentina. 
He played in the first two rounds, against France and New Zealand, both on 
grass courts. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Stoltenberg, Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde were dropped from the 
eight-man squad which prepared for Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
Cash and Masur will probably play singles against Andre Agassi and Michael 
Chang on the clay surface being prepared for the final. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Leach and Jim Pugh will team in doubles for the United States.

RANCHO BERNARDO SAVINGS BANK PUT INTO RECEIVERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal Office of Thrift Supervisions on Friday placed long-struggling 
Rancho Bernardo Savings Bank into receivership and created a new federally 
chartered S&amp;L that will assume many of the failed institution's assets and 
liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
The failed savings bank that had $119 million in assets on Sept. 30 reported 
nearly $5 million in losses during the past two years. Most of the losses were 
generated by a subsidiary's involvement in a troubled residential development 
in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
The regulatory action dashed a planned recapitalization by Orange County thrift 
consultant Jim Gough, who had served as Rancho Bernardo Savings' president and 
chief executive since June. Government thrift officials on Friday said that the 
S&amp;L's financial woes predated the arrival of Gough. 
</P>
<P>
The Rancho Bernardo-based savings bank, along with its branch offices in Rancho 
Penasquitos and Escondido, on Friday began operating as Rancho Bernardo Federal 
Savings Bank. The new institution is being run by the Resolution Trust Corp., a 
federal agency that disposes of failed institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Deposits of up to $100,000 in the S&amp;L are insured by the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp., but shareholders have no ownership stake in the new 
institution, federal regulators said. Rancho Bernardo Savings had slightly more 
than 5,000 depositors, according to Resolution Trust. 
</P>
<P>
As of Sept. 30, the S&amp;L was deficient in all three minimum capital 
requirements applied by regulators. Its tangible capital, the most stringent of 
the three capital tests, had fallen to a negative $808,953. 
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Friday, Gough said that the institution's net worth 
evaporated when the OTS ordered Rancho Bernardo Savings to set aside $1.9 
million in loan-loss reserves in connection with a troubled residential 
development in Escondido. The savings bank previously had recorded $2.9 million 
in reserves and writedowns in connection with the problem-plagued residential 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Thrift Supervision officials, in a press release issued Friday, described 
Rancho Bernardo Savings as too dependent upon its troubled real estate 
subsidiary. The institution "had no viable alternative strategy" to lessen that 
dependence, according to government thrift officials. 
</P>
<P>
The institution also "had not provided enough loan loss reserves to cover its 
non-traditional assets," such as commercial mortgages, construction loans and 
direct real estate investments that accounted for 58% of its total assets, 
Thrift Supervision officials said. Creating suitable reserves would have 
"further crippled (the savings bank's) capital position and future earnings 
potential," according to the release. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure came eight months after federal regulators had ordered the troubled 
institution to severely restrict new loan activity. 
</P>
<P>
Gough became involved with Rancho Bernardo Savings early this year through the 
Thrift Supervision's San Francisco-based Capital Enhancement Group. The group, 
which tries to match potential investors with cash-hungry S&amp;Ls, has 
arranged nearly 20 successful deals in California, Arizona and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
In late June, Gough's investment group signed a definitive agreement that would 
have pumped $2.5 million into the savings bank. The group's investment was 
contingent upon the completion of a private offering that would have raised an 
additional $6.5 million. As part of that agreement, the Office of Thrift 
Supervision in June took the unusual step of allowing Gough to serve as Rancho 
Bernardo Savings' president and chief executive, even though the cash infusion 
had not yet been completed. 
</P>
<P>
Gough, during an interview earlier this year, expressed confidence that the 
private offering would have been completed by the spring.

EL SALVADOR CONTROVERSY

It appears that Rosenberg's sympathies are with the communist FMLN in El 
Salvador and not with the elected Christani government.

I am not condoning the murder of those priests. But at a time when communism is 
disintegrating in many parts of the world, I fail to understand his logic. He 
is out of step.

EL SALVADOR CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I completely agree with Howard Rosenberg's Oct. 10 article, "Standards Double 
When Controversy Strikes," in which he scolds a number of TV stations for 
banning an ad calling for an end to U.S. military aid to El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Not only do these stations promote public ignorance on such important issues, 
they also help our government censor the media. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. taxes pay for Army ads that glorify the cause of killing innocent people; 
at the same time, the media reject an ad encouraging us to condemn the crime of 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
If in November our country again has a low voter turnout, we can blame it on 
the networks and their stations that wouldn't show "controversial" issues.

JELLYFISH RECYCLE THE '70S WITH APLOMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember those floppy crocheted hats with panels made from cut-up Coors cans 
that some people wore in the '70s? If that gives you a kick, you probably would 
have liked seeing Jellyfish at the Roxy on Thursday. If you're still wearing 
one, you're probably in the band. 
</P>
<P>
Bassist Chris Manning was indeed so becapped on Thursday, and if that doesn't 
give you a good enough picture, how about "Alice in Wonderland"-meets-"H. R. 
Pufnstuf" stage decor and finery and a song selection that included the MTV 
theme (all 10 seconds of it), an old Big Mac jingle (15 seconds) and 
affectionate versions of songs by Styx, the Archies, Badfinger and Wings? Don't 
laugh . . . for these four young Bay Area boppers, that's the cultural 
equivalent of rappers sampling James Brown and Funkadelic. As for what that 
says about the respective cultures, well, make up your own mind. 
</P>
<P>
OK, do laugh. The crowd did; the band did too. (Like they were gonna dress and 
play like that and expect to be taken seriously.) What makes this a band worth 
laughing with, though, is the fact that it's actually quite talented and 
imaginative in its original material and presentation, as 
thrift-store-derivative as it is. 
</P>
<P>
Tricky harmonies and complex but catchy arrangements were all executed with 
aplomb that transcends the campy '70s nostalgia, giving hope that Jellyfish can 
someday bury that nostalgia and progress on its own '90s terms if it so 
chooses. And the only thing that weakened the joke was that L.A.'s Redd Kross 
has already done it. STEVE HOCHMAN

PYLON: PURITY BUT WITH TOO LITTLE PURPOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the spirit of the early B-52's and Talking Heads, Pylon plays minimalist 
rock that snaps and cracks with purity and power. After a hiatus of seven 
years, the Georgia undergrounders are back in action, with a new album, 
"Chain," and a tour that brought them to Club Lingerie on Thursday (they'll 
also be at the Spirit in San Diego tonight). 
</P>
<P>
Three lean, serious men and a plump woman singer, Pylon returned with a show 
whose individual components were breathtaking, but whose overall effect was one 
of spinning their wheels. Guitarist Randy Bewley casually deployed an 
inventive, resourceful bag of R&amp;B-derived riffing, and bassist Michael 
Lachowski stirred in some melodic and textural embellishments. But intense, 
animated drummer Curtis Crowe is the real hero of the group, the one you keep 
turning to for bearings. He's the kind of drummer you're happy to surrender to, 
knowing that the ride will be flawless and surprising. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Pylon's stage personality is also minimalist. Vanessa Briscoe 
Hay's deadpan vocals and detached manner add an overlay of ironic melancholy to 
the hard stomp, but don't provide an entertaining focus. If Pylon's skills were 
harnessed to a compelling vision -- a sensibility that controlled and directed 
the riffs instead of the other way around -- the band might be inspired to 
escape the repetition and recycling that kept the set at one level from start 
to finish.RICHARD CROMELIN

HIGH FEES CITED AS MURDOCK DROPS PLAN TO SELL LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Billionaire David H. Murdock, developer of the posh new Lake Sherwood Country 
Club, has abandoned plans to sell the lake to longtime area homeowners, 
apparently ending a dispute that has divided the picturesque community for 
months and which prompted a grand jury investigation last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Murdock announced his decision at a meeting with lake-area property owners 
Wednesday evening. It was endorsed Friday by an association representing owners 
of 121 houses and 47 vacant lots around the lake but outside the boundaries of 
the Murdock development. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Murdock has brought back a solution that is acceptable to all of us," said 
Carl Price, a Lake Sherwood Community Assn. official. "It does end the 
controversy." 
</P>
<P>
Murdock had wanted existing homeowners to buy Lake Sherwood from him for $2.6 
million or to join a new community-service district into which they would pay 
lake maintenance fees. He dropped the plan because the fees were higher than he 
anticipated and unreasonable, said a spokeswoman for the developer. 
</P>
<P>
County estimates released last week show that service-district fees would have 
been $1,500 to $2,200 a year for current homeowners, Murdock spokeswoman Elaine 
Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
The fees were higher than expected, Freeman said, because only 140 of 600 lots 
at the new country club -- far fewer than anticipated by Murdock -- have been 
recorded for sale and subject to the fee. That means that there are fewer lots 
among which service fees can be divided. 
</P>
<P>
So for now, Murdock will keep the lake and pay to maintain it, Freeman said. 
Owners of the 600 luxury homes planned at the 1,900-acre country club will take 
over that responsibility once sales begin to close, she said. Twelve of the 20 
houses under construction are in escrow, having sold for about $1 million each, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Murdock also has begun negotiations with the Conejo Recreation and Parks 
District about the possibility of giving the lake away and making it public, 
Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
In either case, existing residents would not have to share in the purchase of 
the lake or pay new fees for its maintenance, she said. They currently pay 
lake-use fees of about $550 a year. 
</P>
<P>
This week's decision by Murdock is the latest twist in his up-and-down 
relationship with lake residents. It follows by just a month a push by the 
developer to create a special district to buy the lake from him with a $4,000 
levy against each property owner. 
</P>
<P>
The county Public Works Agency endorsed Murdock's proposal in September as a 
way to force longtime homeowners to assume their fair share of lake-maintenance 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the developer agreed to reimburse the $4,000 lake assessments if 
existing home and lot owners agreed to join his new community-service district 
for the country club. 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors delayed action on the proposal after angry 
homeowners protested, claiming that Murdock was reneging on promises he made in 
1987 to give Lake Sherwood to the public. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors were cool to the developer's lake-purchase proposal, since the 
county was embroiled last spring in its own dispute with Murdock over whether 
he had agreed to give the lake to the community as a condition of the 
supervisors' 1987 approval of his development. 
</P>
<P>
County lawyers concluded that while Murdock pledged to "dedicate" the lake to 
the community, dedication was too vague a term to lock the developer legally 
into giving it away. 
</P>
<P>
Murdock's proposal to sell the lake led to a county grand jury investigation 
last spring into whether the developer was breaking promises made to the Lake 
Sherwood community. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury, in a June report, faulted county officials for an alleged lack 
of communication with the developer over whether he could sell the lake. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury said that Murdock first mentioned selling the lake in early 
1988. But it was not until May, 1990, that county officials sought to clarify 
his legal position. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury also strongly questioned why county officials would support 
Murdock's proposal for a special tax district to assess existing residents for 
Lake Sherwood. Such a district would benefit only Murdock and could be used to 
pressure homeowners outside his development into joining a community-service 
district controlled by buyers of his new homes, the grand jury said.

AMNESTY OFFICE SHUTS; PROGRAM NEAR END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In May 1987, there were balloons, confetti, official proclamations, upbeat 
speeches and giveaways of cake and soft drinks to mark the inauguration of a 
U.S. immigration amnesty office along Mission Village Drive in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the place had a half-deserted look and staffers wondered aloud about 
how to pack up boxes of official forms, drab furniture, musty archives and 
other material. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 3 1/2 years and more than 52,000 successful applications after its 
much-publicized debut, the San Diego office served its last client Friday, its 
anticlimactic closing an outgrowth of budget reductions, a diminishing caseload 
and neighborhood complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 3 p.m, the doors closed, the computers went down and amnesty 
applicants were being told to come back next week -- to the Escondido office, 
where the center's paperwork is being transferred. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'll have to try to find a ride up there," said Luisa Gonzalez, an 
applicant awaiting permanent legal status. She was among those shut out when 
the doors were locked in mid-afternoon, although the office reopened later and 
was not officially closed until 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The shutdown of the San Diego amnesty office is the latest in a series of 
closures nationwide of sites that were opened in mid-1987 to handle the 
anticipated glut of applications from foreign nationals eligible under the new 
program. Congress created the amnesty initiative as part of the sweeping 1986 
Immigration Reform and Control Act. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, according to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, the 
amnesty, or legalization, program resulted in granting temporary legal status, 
the first step toward permanent residency, to some 3.1 million foreigners, more 
than half of them residents of California. Most were citizens of Mexico, 
although residents of dozens of nations benefited. 
</P>
<P>
The great majority of the 3.1 million are ultimately expected to achieve 
permanent legal U.S. residence, which grants beneficiaries the right to work in 
the United States and can lead to citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
But why shut down the amnesty office in San Diego and retain the Escondido 
site? 
</P>
<P>
Budget restraints mandated that one of San Diego County's two amnesty centers 
had to close, according to Vicki Quainton, the INS deputy district director in 
San Diego. Authorities targeted the city office, she says, primarily because 
most of the region's remaining amnesty caseload involves farm laborers who most 
likely live closer to Escondido. All San Diego files are being sent to 
Escondido, to ensure continuity, Quainton said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our workload is mostly agricultural, so it made sense to keep open the office 
that serves most of that population," Quainton explained. "But no one is being 
left out in the cold." 
</P>
<P>
Also figuring in the decision, Quainton acknowledges, were the office's high 
costs -- rent was about $18,400 a month, compared with $14,500 in Escondido -- 
and the many complaints from neighborhood residents annoyed by the traffic, 
clutter or crowding associated with the amnesty office. (Because of the 
complaints, Quainton says, the INS spent $3,000 a month for security guards at 
the San Diego site and $500 a month for additional trash collection.) 
</P>
<P>
From the outset, however, the amnesty office shutdowns were an inevitable 
result of the process. 
</P>
<P>
The amnesty offices were created with the explicit expectation that all would 
ultimately be closed as amnesty beneficiaries attained permanent legal 
residence status and their need for contact with the INS diminished. The 
Escondido office and other amnesty sites nationwide are scheduled to close 
March 31. 
</P>
<P>
And, as the amnesty effort winds down, the application fees that have funded it 
are also diminishing, thus adding some urgency to the need to close the offices 
and reduce staff. (The San Diego-area amnesty staff has been pared from a high 
of 119 to 24, according to the INS.) 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that Congress was adamant about was that no taxpayer dollars 
be expended on this program," noted Virginia Kice, an INS spokeswoman in Los 
Angeles, who said the fees imposed on applicants had thus far met the program's 
operating expenses. "If we're going to meet that mandate, it's going to be 
necessary for us to close offices." 
</P>
<P>
While Luisa Gonzalez and others were clearly not happy about the inconvenience 
of having to schlep up to Escondido, 40 miles to the north, all agreed that 
maintaining and extending their cherished micas -- legal U.S. residence 
documents -- would be worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I get my papers, I don't care if they told me that I had to go to 
Canada," said Gadier Uriarte, a 30-year-old citizen of Mexico who now works in 
a San Diego supermarket. "We'll go anywhere for the papers." 
</P>
<P>
Added Luis Galicia, a 45-year-old Mexican man, "I'll go wherever they send me." 
</P>
<P>
In practice, the benefits of amnesty have been extended to two broad groups -- 
some 1.8 million so-called "general amnesty" applicants, who had to prove that 
they had been living the United States illegally since 1982; and 1.3 million 
agricultural laborers who were had to demonstrate that they had performed at 
least 90 days of field work in the United States during 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
Most beneficiaries granted temporary legal status under the general amnesty 
program have already applied for permanent residence status in the United 
States; most farm-worker applicants are still in the temporary-residence stage. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, the busiest amnesty offices nationwide were all in the Los Angeles 
area: The East Los Angeles site granted temporary legal residence to 122,000 
applicants; an additional 92,000 were processed in the El Monte site and 90,000 
successfully filed their applications in Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
At the San Diego office, the 52,000 applicants granted temporary residence 
included 27,000 general amnesty-seekers and 25,000 agricultural workers. 
Escondido has serviced some 45,000 applicants, the great majority of whom -- 
more than 35,000 -- were agricultural laborers.

HALLOWEEN TRICKS CAN LEAD TO COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stories of pins in apples and other hazards are common to Halloween, but there 
is a lesser-known concern for parents on the annual fright night: getting sued. 
</P>
<P>
Mischief -- from the vandalism of breaking windows to causing a traffic 
accident by throwing eggs at cars -- can result in a parent going to court. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, children like to get into trouble on Halloween and that can 
come back to haunt (their parents)," said Vaughn de Kirby, a personal injury 
attorney in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In California, parents are not usually liable for their children's actions 
unless there is a specific law pertaining to that action, but there are four 
major exceptions and each is applicable to Halloween mischief. 
</P>
<P>
Parents may be held liable if they know their child is likely to cause trouble 
but take no precautions; if the child deliberately does something he or she 
knows is wrong; if the child has access to firearms; and if the child causes 
damage and injury while driving the family vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Courts have ruled that a parent is not liable -- unless negligence is involved 
-- for their children's "friendly play" that results in injury or damage. But 
when children purposefully do something wrong, their parents are liable for up 
to $10,000 for each person injured or for damaged property. 
</P>
<P>
De Kirby mentioned a case in which a 5-year-old child pushed and injured his 
baby-sitter on Halloween. The parents never told the baby-sitter about the 
child's behavior problems and thus were liable for the baby-sitter's injuries, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be anything from throwing eggs and water balloons to typical Halloween 
mischief that turns into vandalism," de Kirby said. "I've found that a lot of 
parents are simply not aware of their liability under the law, and the chances 
for something like this happening are greatly increased on Halloween." 
</P>
<P>
Halloween also is a prime night for teen-agers to go celebrating in cars, 
creating an especially dangerous situation with so many costumed children 
trick-or-treating, de Kirby added. 
</P>
<P>
Under California law, parents are liable for their children's negligence, 
wrongful acts or omissions when operating the family vehicle, even if the child 
does not get the parents' permission to take the car. Damages are limited to 
$15,000 for injury or death of one person and $30,000 for more than one person. 
Property damages are limited to $5,000 per accident. No one is liable for 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
For the types of dangers more typically associated with Halloween, a few 
hospitals in the San Diego area continue to offer free X-rays of candy and 
other goodies on Halloween, but many hospitals have dropped the service, saying 
it is ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
X-rays do not detect many foreign objects, poisons and other contaminants in 
fruit, candy and other edible treats, said Children's Hospital spokesman Mark 
Morelli. 
</P>
<P>
"It lulls parents into a false sense of security. A better precaution is good 
common sense," including parental supervision of their children while 
trick-or-treating and inspection of all goodies, Morelli said. 
</P>
<P>
While there have been no confirmed incidents of children being injured by 
tainted candy in San Diego in recent years, each Halloween a few children are 
struck by vehicles or suffer other injuries due to masks that hinder their 
vision or costumes that restrict movements, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's very important -- a mask that doesn't block a child's view," Morelli 
said. "There are usually a couple of traffic accidents where the child is all 
excited and runs into the street and doesn't see the car (because of the 
mask)." 
</P>
<P>
An alternative to masks are cosmetics, which allow greater creativity than a 
mask and will not block a child's vision, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Because Halloween safety concerns are emphasized in school, many children 
already know to use common sense when trick-or-treating, said Eileen Callahan, 
spokeswoman for the UC San Diego Medical Center. The San Diego Regional Poison 
Center, a unit of the medical center, sends staffers into schools to educate 
children on the dangers of Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
Halloween safety tips include: 
</P>
<P>
* Young children should trick-or-treat before dark and always be accompanied by 
an adult. 
</P>
<P>
* Costumes should be light-colored, fitted to prevent tripping, have reflective 
tape if worn after nightfall and be flame resistant. (Remember this means the 
material can catch fire but will resist burning.) 
</P>
<P>
* Children should carry a flashlight and stay in their neighborhoods, visit 
only the homes of people they know and avoid houses with no lights on. 
</P>
<P>
* No unwrapped candy should be accepted and goodies should not be eaten until 
examined by an adult. 
</P>
<P>
* Discard any candy not in its original wrapper or in a wrapper that might have 
been tampered with. 
</P>
<P>
* Children should observe basic safety precautions and be especially cautious 
when crossing the street. 
</P>
<P>
* Motorists should be on the alert for trick-or-treaters. 
</P>
<P>
* Those expecting trick-or-treaters should remove objects from their yards that 
are a hazard to children, such as sprinklers and garden tools. 
</P>
<P>
* Dogs should be kept in the house or otherwise restrained. 
</P>
<P>
* Alternative treats include nuts, raisins, sugar-free candy, stickers, finger 
puppets and other inexpensive novelty items.

BUSH TO PUSH FOR WILSON IN VISIT TO COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President George Bush, in a last-minute effort to get out the vote for 
Republican gubernatorial candidate Sen. Pete Wilson, is scheduled to appear at 
a campaign rally next Saturday in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was invited to speak at California Lutheran University by members of the 
Republican Students Speakers Bureau, said Jean Sandlin, university public 
information director. 
</P>
<P>
Sandlin said Wilson's campaign representatives contacted university officials 
Thursday about the presidential visit, but are still completing plans. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is scheduled to appear with Wilson at a morning rally in the university 
gym, a Wilson campaign spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The last-minute appearance by the President is expected to give the senator 
extra visibility in what has become a tight race for the governor's seat. 
Wilson is in a dead heat in the race for governor with his Democratic opponent, 
former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has scheduled a series of last-minute appearances across the country to 
stump for GOP candidates before the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, campaign spokesmen for Congressmen Elton Gallegly (R-Simi 
Valley) and Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) said they did not know if the 
candidates would attend the rally. Both were still in Washington to participate 
in the congressional debate over a new budget. 
</P>
<P>
One GOP candidate who said he expected to attend Wilson's rally at Cal Lutheran 
is Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks). 
</P>
<P>
McClintock said Wilson has differed with the President on raising taxes. But 
Bush's visit might boost the senator's political ratings at a critical time in 
the campaign, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If a presidential visit draws more attention to hear Pete Wilson, so much the 
better," McClintock said. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), however, said the impact of Bush's 
visit on voters will depend heavily on whether Congress passes the federal 
budget before the election. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a mixed bag for a simple reason: Everyone's really concerned 
about what's going on with the budget," Wright said. "If there's taxes included 
in the budget, there's going to be some fallout on that." 
</P>
<P>
Wright said she did not expect the presidential visit to affect her bid to 
retain her seat in the 37th District. McClintock is favored to win his race in 
the 36th District. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Bush's trip to Cal Lutheran will be the first presidential visit 
in the 31-year-history of the campus, university President Jerry Miller said. 
The visit is expected to draw a bipartisan audience from throughout the county 
and from among the university's students. 
</P>
<P>
"I imagine most Republican candidates within 50 miles of the Cal Lutheran 
campus will seek to get involved in this event," Miller said. "I suspect that 
this will be an exciting political experience for our students."

<P>
A Point Mugu man stalled his pickup truck on railroad tracks in Camarillo 
Friday afternoon, jumping from the cab seconds before an oncoming freight train 
smashed the truck into a post, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Joseph Alarcon, 46, was driving south on Las Posas Road, the sun in his 
eyes, approaching East Fifth Street when he noticed the railroad crossing arms 
were down, said California Highway Patrolman Brian Demattia. 
</P>
<P>
Alarcon tried to brake, but his foot slipped onto the accelerator, Demattia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After crashing through one of the crossing arms, the truck stalled and Alarcon 
could not restart it, Demattia said. 
</P>
<P>
A Southern Pacific freight train traveling west smashed the truck into a 
control box post, scattering the camper shell and its contents along the 
tracks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alarcon suffered minor injuries from his jump. Officials closed Las Posas Road 
for about 45 minutes while the accident scene was cleared. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

SALE OF NATIVE PLANTS PLANNED BY SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once wild-and-weedy native plants are making a place for themselves in home 
gardens, according to the California Native Plant Society, whose members are 
sponsoring a plant sale in Ventura today. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, many native plant species have been developed into 
tidier, more compact varieties, said Patt Wilson McDaniel, president of the 
Ventura County chapter of the nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
While society members have long found indigenous species desirable, popularity 
has swelled because of the new varieties and their water-saving habits, so CNPS 
plans to offer twice as many plants as in last year's sale, McDaniel said. 
</P>
<P>
Members will be on hand to share their expertise on cultivating the plants and 
will have literature available on local planting conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The one-day sale will run from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Ventura High School 
stadium parking lot off Poli Street west of Seaward Avenue. KATHLEEN WILLIAMS

MAIL HOLIDAY PACKAGES TO MIDDLE EAST EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego community groups, businesses, schools and individuals should mail 
Christmas packages and cards early to San Diego-based military personnel in the 
Middle East to avoid the traditional mailing crunch during the holidays, postal 
and military officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Packages to the Middle East should be mailed by Nov. 16. Christmas cards and 
letters should be sent by Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Express mail deadlines are a few weeks later, but senders should remember that 
overseas express mail costs can be prohibitive, postal officials said. All 
parcels should be properly packaged and addressed to avoid delays. 
</P>
<P>
To offset mailing costs, San Diegans can contact a few local businesses paying 
postage expenses for Christmas goods being sent to U.S. troops in the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Desert Shield, the code name for the deployment of U.S. troops in 
response to Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait, has put an added holiday 
burden on the postal service and last-minute Christmas mailings will worsen 
that problem, said San Diego Postmaster Margaret Sellers. 
</P>
<P>
People are reminded not to send perishable foods -- such as the traditional 
Christmas fruit cake -- that will spoil under the desert heat or during delays 
in postal handling. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended gifts include board games, audio tape cassettes, books, hobby items 
and personal hygiene items such as eyedrops, cotton swabs and insect repellent. 
Sweat shirts would be useful since desert temperatures drop at night. 
</P>
<P>
Camp Pendleton is advising Marine families to send Christmas packages now. Many 
dependents, already accustomed to delays involved with overseas mailings, have 
done so already, said spokeswoman Sgt. Vicki Turney. 
</P>
<P>
Schoolchildren and others supporting Operation Desert Shield are asked not to 
earmark all their Christmas gifts for San Diego-based Marines and sailors so 
that military personnel from across the country can receive items, Turney said. 
</P>
<P>
Many local elementary schools that have been corresponding with Marines and 
sailors since August are preparing to send holiday greetings to units and 
servicemen they have adopted. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to send our Christmas items in the next couple of weeks," said Dawn 
Sullivan, a fifth-grade teacher at Zamorano Fine Arts Academy in the San Diego 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Mass quantities of gifts should continue to be sent through the Defense 
Logistics Agency, which can be reached at (703) 274-3561. 
</P>
<P>
Postal spokesman Ken Boyd said that the recent increase in mail to troops in 
the Middle East likely is Christmas-related. 
</P>
<P>
"We think people are getting the message and mailing their Christmas packages 
early, but we can't tell if a package sent to the troops in the Middle East is 
a Christmas present or just a regular package," Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
In respect to the Islamic government of Saudi Arabia, packages should nor 
contain liquor, drugs, weapons, explosives, pork products, photos of nudity or 
semi-nudity, sexually oriented literature or materials, or Christian and Jewish 
items, postal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi postal and customs officials will confiscate or censure such materials, 
including Bibles, crosses and magazines with pictures of women in bathing 
suits, underwear and other garments considered unacceptable by the Saudis. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard of one case where a guy's wife sent him a picture of herself in a 
bikini, and all he got was her head (with her body cropped from the 
photograph)," said Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
A good guideline is adhering to American standards of "good taste," Turney 
added. "Photos of women and girls are OK. I'm not saying the women have to be 
in snow gear, but you should use good judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Locally, there are a few ways that San Diegans can support troops without 
having to pay full postage. 
</P>
<P>
Mail Boxes Etc. will pay mailing costs on up to 2 pounds on two packages under 
its "Operation Desert Santa," which runs to Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which mailed 300 packages in its first three days in October, is 
drawing the most response from its stores near military bases. The stores are 
expecting to absorb up to $1,000 each in mailing costs. 
</P>
<P>
"We think this is a terrific project and we're supporting it wholeheartedly," 
said Beverly Selby, administrative director of the Navy League, a civilian 
organization of supporters of Navy personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Mail Boxes Etc. also will ship up to 700 pounds of morale-boosting gifts under 
"Operation Desert Cheer," a project organized by the San Diego chapter of the 
National Speakers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Postal Annex Plus, with support from HomeFed Bank and Travel Center Downtown, 
has been paying postage for Christmas packages and cards throughout October. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. in Horton Park, the companies will sponsor 
"From the Heart of San Diego," during which senders can have mailing costs 
covered on packages up to 25 pounds and 15 inches square. Postal Annex Plus 
expects to pay at least $1,200 in mailing costs in San Diego, said company 
spokesman David Wilkey. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's event will be videotaped and sent to San Diego-based military 
personnel in the Middle East as a video Christmas card, said Bob Zimmerman, the 
organizer of "Operation San Diego Cares," which has supported U.S. troops since 
the initial deployment in the Persian Gulf crisis.

JUDGES MIGHT TESTIFY AT BRODERICK TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Superior Court judge presiding over Elisabeth Anne (Betty) 
Broderick's double murder trial ruled Friday that two other local judges could 
not be automatically excluded from testifying at the trial simply because they 
were on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
But, Judge Thomas J. Whelan said, the two judges, who issued rulings in 
Broderick's bitter divorce with her ex-husband, would not be allowed to testify 
about any decisions made in the course of the divorce proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
If Judges William J. Howatt Jr. or Anthony C. Joseph were called to testify, 
Whelan said, they could testify only about what they knew independently about 
Betty Broderick or her ex-husband, Daniel T. Broderick III, or what they 
perceived as they watched the couple in their courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling concluded the first week of Broderick's double murder trial. There 
was no testimony Friday in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick, 42, faces two counts of murder in the shooting deaths last Nov. 5 of 
her ex-husband and his new wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick. If convicted, she 
could be sentenced to life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Broderick was a prominent medical malpractice lawyer and a former county 
bar president. 
</P>
<P>
During and after the bitter divorce, which began when the couple separated in 
1985 and took four years, Betty Broderick accused her husband of using his 
legal influence to cheat her out of her fair share of his seven-figure annual 
income. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, Howatt conducted the divorce trial. Joseph handled 
two contempt citations Daniel Broderick brought against Betty Broderick in 
connection with the divorce case. 
</P>
<P>
Both Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells, the prosecutor in the murder case, and 
defense lawyer Jack Earley have issued subpoenas for the two judges to testify 
in Betty Broderick's criminal trial, Whelan said Friday. In response to the 
subpoenas, the two judges, through a county lawyer, asked Whelan Friday to rule 
they were ineligible to testify. 
</P>
<P>
The issuance of a subpoena -- a notice to appear -- does not mean that a person 
will actually testify. Further, it was not clear why the judges have been put 
on alert since both said in court filings that they did not know Daniel or 
Betty Broderick socially. 
</P>
<P>
Whelan ruled before the murder trial began that the propriety of judicial 
rulings in the divorce action would not be discussed in the criminal case. 
Deputy County Counsel R. Mark Beesley argued Friday that Howatt or Joseph were 
flatly ineligible to testify, since they had nothing to talk about besides 
divorce case rulings. 
</P>
<P>
Beesley also said that it would be "dangerous" to "put a judge in a position 
where the weight of his office might appear to support one party or another." 
</P>
<P>
Whelan, however, said that he could not automatically assume that either judge 
had nothing to offer other than the reasoning behind rulings in the divorce 
action, and so he refused to rule them ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Earley nor Wells disclosed Friday why they had issued subpoenas for the 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
Before either judge -- or any other judge that might be called in the case -- 
took the stand, Whelan said Friday he wanted to be told in advance what they 
would talk about. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony in the case is due to resume Monday. Wells expects to finish her case 
on Monday and Betty Broderick is due to testify in her own defense.

COUPLE CONVICTED OF THEFTS FROM MAN WHO IS FEARED DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two former Santa Monica teachers were convicted Friday of stealing the motor 
home and life savings of a retired Glendale accountant who mysteriously 
disappeared a year ago while traveling in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
A 12-member jury in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas found Stanley Alan 
Hershey, 46, and his wife, Jan Vicki Fine, 38, guilty on all 18 counts of 
conspiracy, transportation of stolen vehicles across state lines and illegal 
use of automated banking cards. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing was set for Jan. 11 before U.S. District Judge Philip Pro. Hershey 
and Fine have been held without bail in a Las Vegas jail since their arrest 
March 1 by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
The couple were convicted of stealing a $219,000 motor home, a four-wheel-drive 
Suzuki and $120,000 in savings that belonged to Gordon T. Johnson, 62. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe that Johnson, who traveled with his dog, Rocky, was 
murdered during a stopover at a campground at Lake Shasta in Northern 
California. While local authorities are continuing a murder investigation, 
Johnson's body has not been found and no charges have been filed. There is no 
murder charge under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
Fine, who is expecting her first child in two weeks, appeared visibly shaken as 
the verdict was read. The stoical expression maintained by Hershey during the 
six-day trial did not change. 
</P>
<P>
Fine testified that she and her husband, both teachers with master's degrees, 
practiced "channeling," in which they relied on spirits to guide their destiny. 
She said she believed her husband had a special connection with a spirit guide. 
</P>
<P>
She also testified that Hershey told her Johnson gave them permission to use 
his motor home and funds to support their spiritual work, but did not say what 
that work entailed. The couple traveled extensively, including a trip to 
Tahiti, and spent large sums on expensive clothing, such as silk Italian suits 
purchased in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Fine's defense attorney attempted to portray her client as a 
timid woman with low self-esteem who did not question the actions of her 
husband. Fine cried during closing arguments Thursday when her attorney 
depicted Hershey as a diabolical, domineering man who exercised mind control 
over his submissive wife. 
</P>
<P>
Journals written by Hershey and Fine in which they supposedly wrote down 
directives from spirits were presented by both Fine's attorney and the federal 
prosecutor during final arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Public Defender Franny Forsman argued that journals written by Hershey 
since 1986 reveal his quest for money and power over others. She maintained 
that Hershey had plotted to victimize Fine, whom he married in 1988, by 
controlling her actions and spending her $95,000 inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant U.S. Dist. Atty. J. Gregory Damm used journals written by both 
Hershey and Fine to show that they schemed together to steal from Johnson. 
After Hershey and Fine met Johnson in September, 1989, at a motor home park in 
Minneapolis, Fine wrote: "The plan is in action and ready to be executed." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hershey, in a passage that specified "Gordy (Johnson) and his 
assets," wrote a supposed directive from spirits that said: "No act or word or 
thought from either of you that could be judged as 'harmful' from your cultural 
vantage point accrues any karmic consequence for you. There are no limits or 
prohibitions."

<P>
A fire caused by a freak accident gutted the caretaker's house at Matilija Dam 
in the foothills near Wheeler Springs on Friday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Dam tender Donald James Logsdon was using a saw about 10:30 a.m. to cut through 
concrete when he hit a pipe that connects a propane tank to his house, said 
Denis Miller, a dispatcher for the Ventura County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
The saw sparked a fire that traveled up the pipe and into the house, Miller 
said. Logsdon was not injured, Miller said, but the blaze caused $100,000 in 
structural damage and destroyed $30,000 in contents. 
</P>
<P>
The house is owned by the Casitas Municipal Water District, which leases the 
dam from Ventura County and runs it, said Richard Hajas, assistant general 
manager of the district. CAROL WATSON

Narcotics officers arrested eight people and seized almost 6 pounds of cocaine 
in a drug bust that began in Santa Paula and ended in Los Angeles County, 
authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests resulted from an investigation of two suspected Santa Paula drug 
dealers that was begun a month ago by the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, 
Lt. Guy Inglis said. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Paula men delivered 2.2 pounds of cocaine, worth about $25,000, to an 
undercover narcotics agent in a parking lot at Palm Avenue and Harvard 
Boulevard Thursday about 3:45 p.m., Inglis said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Rodriguez, 40, and Ricardo Perez, 22, were arrested on suspicion of sales 
of cocaine and conspiracy to distribute cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
They were being held on $100,000 bail each at Ventura County Jail, Inglis said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies then served a search warrant at Perez's house in the 200 block of 
Ventura Street where they seized $500, a handgun and paperwork concerning drug 
sales, Inglis said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies served two more search warrants at houses in Los Angeles County, 
Inglis said. 
</P>
<P>
At a house in Lynwood, law enforcement agents found paraphernalia that 
indicated drug sales were taking place, he said, and at a house in Paramount 
deputies found 3 1/2 pounds of cocaine and a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
Six residents of the Paramount house were arrested. CAROL WATSON

$15-MILLION SCIENCE CENTER FRAUGHT WITH PROBLEMS; 
</P>
<P>
CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE: INSTRUCTORS REFUSE TO MOVE INTO THE BUILDING BECAUSE THEY 
SAY EQUIPMENT IS DEFECTIVE. VIBRATIONS MAY MAKE SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS UNUSABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The much-heralded $15.4-million science center at Cal State Northridge faces so 
many problems that some professors have refused to move in when it opens later 
this year, and others are demanding changes before they give up the out-of-date 
facilities they now occupy. 
</P>
<P>
As described by disappointed faculty members, the problems range from 
laboratory benches that swell by 50% when they get wet, to vibrations from the 
climate control system that threaten to render useless the sensitive scientific 
equipment the center was built to house. 
</P>
<P>
Fingers are being pointed every which way, and even those administrators who 
remain optimistic that corrections can be made agree that the lingering 
problems highlight failures in the way the state university system manages 
construction. They say some of those same obstacles may have led to 
installation of an inadequate air conditioning system in CSUN faculty offices 
built in 1984 and to the cave-in of a music building roof at Cal State Long 
Beach last month. 
</P>
<P>
"Somewhere along the line, the process collapsed, and I suspect it was when 
dollars became important," said CSUN chemistry professor Ricardo Silva, who a 
year ago was appointed liaison between the science faculty and campus planners. 
"There should have been a lot more consultation with the people who were going 
to use the facility." 
</P>
<P>
Construction and outfitting of the three structures that make up the new 
science center -- two filled with laboratories and offices and a third 
containing a 105-seat planetarium -- have been financed largely by state 
higher-education bonds. The bonds were approved by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The largest outstanding -- and most disconcerting -- problem with the center 
appeared earlier this month, when one of the three ventilation fans was turned 
on. Faculty and administrators on hand for the test said they could feel mild 
vibrations in the building. When they told their colleagues, panic erupted. 
</P>
<P>
"There had been a general feeling of let's get in the building and we'll be 
able to fix the glitches," said chemistry professor Henry Abrash. "But when it 
came to the vibration, a whole wave of concern went through the faculty that 
this is just not something we could patch up." 
</P>
<P>
For microbiologist Edward Pollock, witnessing the vibrations made his run-down 
facilities in one of the 1950s-era science buildings suddenly more attractive. 
More than half of a floor in the new center was dedicated to his laboratories 
and classrooms, yet he is among a handful of faculty members who have already 
indicated they plan to stay put. 
</P>
<P>
"We were supposed to get a good science building and we're getting a disaster," 
Pollock said. 
</P>
<P>
Pollock and his students rely on the magnifying powers of the electron 
microscope, which enables them to view objects as small as the fibers on a 
tumor cell. Even now, in its location in a large closet down the hall from his 
office, there are days when the microscope is unusable because movement in the 
old building blurs its images, Pollock said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Chatham, vice president in charge of facilities planning at CSUN, blamed 
problems in the new building on poor communication among the various parties 
involved in building at the state universities: the faculty, campus planners, 
state university system engineers and the site's architect and contractor. And 
Chatham said the state formula used to forecast building costs produces 
estimates that often are unrealistically low, forcing plans to be put out for 
bid numerous times with quality cutbacks made each time. 
</P>
<P>
The science building was put out for bid three times before a contractor made a 
bid within the $14.6-million budget, said Peter Ruppel, a representative of the 
project's architect, Leo A. Daly. Compromises were made at each stage, such as 
the quality of wood used in the cabinetry. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get into a scenario of pointing fingers, because I don't have 
enough fingers to point," he said. "But there was not a lot of feedback to say, 
'We can't do what you want. Is this going to be satisfactory?' " 
</P>
<P>
Even an independent review, first required in 1985 to avoid structural flaws 
that could lead to disasters such as the music building collapse at Long Beach, 
never was intended to include review of ventilation systems and cabinet 
materials, said Richard Esgate, the consultant hired to critique most state 
university construction plans. 
</P>
<P>
A walk through CSUN's existing science buildings illustrates the need for the 
new center, faculty said. Insect storage cabinets line the hallways, safety 
showers drip on classroom floors, modern equipment is squeezed into supply 
closets, and some faculty offices are in portable classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) who fought for three years to obtain 
funding for the new science center, said he had not heard about the problems 
before Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"After all we had to go through to get the money for that building, if they 
screwed it up by cutting corners or not supervising or hiring the wrong 
contractor, I'm going to be really mad," Katz said. "There are hundreds of 
bureaucrats in the state university system whose job it is to make sure 
taxpayers' money is not wasted, and if they're not doing their job, then it's 
time for them to be replaced." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, construction costs are more than $600,000 over the original 
$14.6-million budget, according to statistics supplied by the CSU system and 
the Assembly subcommittee on higher education. Only about $100,000 remains in a 
contingency fund set up for last-minute changes. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery of the new center's shortcomings was gradual. Some faculty recall 
voicing concerns when architectural drawings first came to them for review five 
years ago. Others said they didn't realize there were glitches and gaffes until 
construction started in 1987. Still others said their first hint that things 
were not as they should be emerged last summer during tours of the partly 
completed center. 
</P>
<P>
All faculty interviewed said they trusted the Omaha-based architectural firm 
the campus has used for many of its construction projects to see that their 
often unusual needs were accommodated. Other projects done by the Leo A. Daly 
firm include the renovation and expansion of the UCLA School of Engineering and 
Applied Science and design of the Earth and Space Science Laboratory at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, astronomy professors found that seats in the new planetarium were 
installed at a permanent incline, making use of the building as a lecture hall 
uncomfortable if not impossible. Biology professors found their classrooms were 
equipped with lighting that automatically turns on when someone enters the 
room, which precludes darkening the room to project slides or films. Chemistry 
professors found ventilation hoods installed over student experiment stations 
lacked the necessary electrical outlets or sinks. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Skovlin, chairman of the chemistry department, took a piece of the 
pressed-wood material used for two-thirds of the science benches back to his 
laboratory and immersed it in a beaker of water. He said it expanded by half 
overnight, and even when dried out again it remained swollen by 30%. 
</P>
<P>
"You can imagine what's going to happen in a laboratory environment," Skovlin 
said. "We're going to have problems down the line and we'll be expected to 
replace those cabinets out of our department budgets." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the errors have been corrected and many more are slated to be, said Don 
Bianchi, dean of the School of Science and Mathematics. No complete tally has 
been made, but so far some of the costs have been borne by the contractor and 
subcontractors, some by the university, and others have yet to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
The specter of perpetual vibrations is the most serious of the remaining 
problems, Bianchi said. 
</P>
<P>
The electron microscope is not the only vibration-sensitive instrument 
scheduled to go into the new buildings, faculty said. Modern college science 
instruction and research relies on lasers, balances, tissue slicers and a 
myriad of other precise equipment. Even standard microscopes could be affected 
if the movement is violent enough. 
</P>
<P>
What perplexes Pollock is that he vividly recalls numerous conversations during 
the past two years concerning the need to avoid any vibrations. 
</P>
<P>
Pollock said that at one point the architect's representative, Ruppel, assured 
him that a separate foundation would be poured for the sensitive equipment 
area. He said he didn't realize that the specification had been changed or 
overlooked until the day the foundation was poured. 
</P>
<P>
Bianchi and other campus administrators hold out hope that the movement 
occurred primarily because the fans were not balanced properly. A second 
ventilation test is scheduled in early November .

Family Sick Leave 
</P>
<P>
Q. Gov. Deukmejian recently vetoed legislation that would have granted workers 
as much as four months of unpaid leave every two years to care for sick 
children, spouses and other family members without fear of losing their jobs. 
Do you favor this type of legislation? 
</P>
<P>
Hart: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers: No. Once again the Legislature is trying to force small businesses to 
bear the financial burden of family planning and personal family problems. 
Choosing to take time off to care for family members is the employee's decision 
and responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Wood: No. Unfair to employees hired to fill the four-month gap and to the 
employer for losing training investment.

<P>

Teacher Salaries 
</P>
<P>
Q. The Legislature approved a 4.7% cost-of-living raise for school employees, 
and Gov. Deukmejian reduced it to 3%, placing the difference in an account for 
special education programs. Should this money be used for salaries? 
</P>
<P>
Hart: This is a decision for each local school board. Personally, I would like 
to see some of the money used to reduce class size, but that is a question for 
each district to decide. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers: Yes. If the need in special education programs is for teachers' 
salaries, it should be used for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Wood: The money should be returned to the taxpayers -- they are not receiving 
value for their funds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Green 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 128, the so-called "Big Green" initiative on the November 
ballot, seeks to eliminate ozone-depleting chemicals by the year 2000, phase 
out pesticides known to cause cancer and require that trees be planted in all 
new developments. Do you support this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Hart: I support Proposition 128 and believe that we can implement it 
effectively and economically. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers: No. Proposition 128 gives too much power to one person and one agency. 
It could also destroy our agricultural industry. And if we eliminate all 
pesticides, are Californians willing to buy produce with worms and flies -- or 
will they buy more perfect fruit from other states and countries with no 
restrictions on pesticides? 
</P>
<P>
Wood: No. General rule: If you don't understand the initiative, vote NO. Do not 
be influenced by emotional "stars" pleading one way or the other. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited Terms 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 131 on the November ballot, authored by Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp and Common Cause, would limit most statewide elected officials to eight 
consecutive years in office, and senators and Assembly members to 12 years. 
Proposition 140, sponsored by Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, is 
more stringent, limiting lifetime service to eight years in the Senate and six 
in the Assembly. Do you support limiting the number of terms state legislators 
can serve? If yes, how long should the limits be? 
</P>
<P>
Hart: I don't support term limits. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers: Yes. I support Proposition 140 in its entirety-especially in limiting 
terms to eight years in the Senate and six in the Assembly-and limiting the 
legislative staff! 
</P>
<P>
Wood: Yes. Two terms in each house max. Problem; The bureaucrats will run 
everything they now don't control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sales Tax 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 133 on the November ballot would raise state sales and use taxes 
by 0.5% for four years to raise $7.5 billion for drug enforcement and 
treatment, anti-drug education, and prison and jail construction and operation. 
Do you support this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Hart: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers: No. We don't need any increases in sales and use taxes. When the 
Legislature stops wasting the taxes we're already paying, we'll have more than 
enough to win the war against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Wood: No. Raising taxes has never solved any problem! Read history and tell me 
if I'm wrong. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Liquor Tax 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 134 on the November ballot would substantially raise taxes on 
beer, wine and liquor, and dedicate the revenue from the tax hike to programs 
for the treatment of drug and alcohol abuse. Do you support this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Hart: I support Proposition 134. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers: No. It is too much of an increase in the taxes on wine. It would put 
many small wineries out of business. In addition, it spends more money than it 
raises, and these additional funds would come from our already overburdened 
general funds. 
</P>
<P>
Wood: No. The administrative bureaucrats will get the largest share of the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Death Penalty 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support capital punishment? If so, do you think it should be imposed 
on those convicted of importing or selling drugs? 
</P>
<P>
Hart: No. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers: Yes. Especially for child abusers and murderers -- and I would like to 
see it enforced! Yes. Selling drugs to minors and importing cocaine and heroin. 
</P>
<P>
Wood: Yes, in cases involving the death of others. No -- not the way to solve 
the drug problem. Take the profit out of drugs and the problem is reduced to a 
fad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Abortion Rights 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support a woman's right to unrestricted abortions within the first 
three months of pregnancy? 
</P>
<P>
Hart: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers: Yes. No one has the right to interfere with a woman's decision to have 
an abortion -- or to become a mother. 
</P>
<P>
Wood: Yes, as long as the state does not pay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Abortion Funding 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support government funding of abortions for women who cannot afford 
them? 
</P>
<P>
Hart: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers: No. 
</P>
<P>
Wood: No. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Day-Care Services 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe the state should require private employers to subsidize 
day-care services for employees who request them? 
</P>
<P>
Hart: No. I authored California's child-care tax credit to provide incentives 
for employer-sponsored child care. I believe that incentives are a more 
appropriate and efficient method to increase the availability of child-care 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers: No. Employers are not responsible for their employees' decisions to 
have children and they should not be forced by government to provide day care. 
I would support tax credits and incentives to employers to provide subsidized 
day care. 
</P>
<P>
Wood: No. This amounts to a state-mandated pay raise to a select few. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
War on Drugs 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe our present strategy of criminal prosecution, interdiction of 
supplies and imprisonment of users and dealers will ever significantly reduce 
the level of drug use in the United States? If no, what should be done? 
</P>
<P>
Hart: I am not confident that our present strategy will significantly reduce 
drug use. We certainly have to continue our law enforcement efforts, but the 
only way to really reduce drug use is through education, through treatment and 
public health programs, and by changing values to make drug use unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers: No. If we enforced our drug laws aggressively, instead of letting so 
many criminals plea bargain and buy their way out of jail, we could 
significantly reduce drug sales. And if we were educating everyone adequately 
about the dangers of drug abuse, plus providing children with an education that 
enabled them to lead productive, useful lives, we would reduce drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Wood: No. Take the profit out of drugs! 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oil Exploration 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think the present Mideast crisis justifies opening up additional 
parts of the California coastline to oil exploration? 
</P>
<P>
Hart: No. Conservation is a more efficient way to reduce our dependence on 
foreign oil. New drilling takes years to produce oil; conservation can save far 
more oil immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers: No. The current Mideast crisis has not yet actually produced oil 
shortages (in spite of the price-gouging that is going on) -- and there is 
plenty of oil in reserves and in Texas and Alaska to keep our supplies stable 
until the crisis is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Wood: An excuse is not needed. Isn't it amazing how politicians can turn any 
situation to an advantage? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parkland Exchange 
</P>
<P>
Q. Should the National Park Service exchange 50 acres in Cheeseboro Canyon in 
southeastern Ventura County for about 1,100 acres of the neighboring Jordan 
Ranch owned by entertainer Bob Hope, permitting park agencies to buy another 
4,600 acres of Hope's land in the Santa Monica and Santa Susana mountains for 
$10 million? 
</P>
<P>
Hart: Yes. On balance, I agree with the Sierra Club that this land exchange 
would provide a tremendous opportunity to acquire thousands of acres of 
valuable lands in the Santa Monica Mountains (in my district). However, even 
though Jordan Ranch is outside my Senate district, I am concerned about the 
impact of development in that area and believe that the land swap should not be 
conditioned on approval of development. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers: No opinion. I am not informed enough about this exchange to answer. 
</P>
<P>
Wood: I don't know enough, but the deal seems good. Private ownership of land 
preserves more than government ownership. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Funding 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support full or partial public funding of political campaigns? 
</P>
<P>
Hart: Yes. I believe that partial public funding of campaigns will reduce the 
influence of powerful special interests, increase political competition and 
give the public more control over politics. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers: Absolutely not! I am opposed to any government funding of campaigns and 
feel we should lift all limits on funding by individuals. The result of all the 
so-called campaign reform in the past decade has been to make the PACs 
all-powerful and the incumbents literally unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
Wood: NO!! 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Senate District 18 
</P>
<P>
More registered Democrats than Republicans are in the district, which stretches 
along the coast from northern Santa Barbara County to Malibu in Los Angeles 
County and also includes Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CONTENDERS 
</P>
<P>
Gary Hart, 47, a Democrat from Santa Barbara, is chairman of the Senate 
Education Committee. He was first elected to the state Senate in 1982 after 
serving eight years in the Assembly. He was a teacher with the Santa Barbara 
schools before becoming a legislator. 
</P>
<P>
Carey R. Rogers, 49, a Santa Barbara Republican, sells home and business 
security and fire alarm systems. She is a member of the Santa Barbara County 
Republican Central Committee and an officer of G.A.L.S., a Republican women's 
club. 
</P>
<P>
Jay C. Wood, 57, a Libertarian, is the owner of a small business that sells 
office machines. Wood, who recently moved to Fillmore from Port Hueneme, has 
been active in the Libertarian Party for 10 years. This is his second time 
running for the state Senate seat.

OCEANSIDE MAN CHARGED WITH SMUGGLING OSTRICH EGGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unemployed Oceanside man was indicted Friday on federal charges of smuggling 
more than $300,000 worth of fertile ostrich eggs into the United States from 
Mexico, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
The three-count indictment against Roger L. Jacobson, 52, alleges that he 
imported 327 eggs through the San Ysidro port of entry, Assistant U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Michael G. Wheat said. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 19, Jacobson reportedly tried to sneak 110 eggs, hidden in his car, 
past U.S. Customs inspectors, Wheat said. An inspector found the eggs, however, 
and called Customs agents, who retrieved 217 eggs that previously had been 
brought into the U.S., Wheat said. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife and quarantine laws prevent importation of the eggs, according to the 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charged Jacobson with one count of smuggling and one count of 
importing wildlife. The third count said that Jacobson was convicted in Los 
Angeles in 1964 of grand theft and charges him with being a felon in possession 
of a firearm, a loaded .44-caliber Magnum revolver. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all charges, Jacobson could draw 20 years in federal prison and 
up to $750,000 in fines, Wheat said. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson is to be arraigned Nov. 2, Wheat said.

ELECTIONS 18TH SENATE DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
HART CHALLENGER HAS RUN OUT OF CAMPAIGN CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republican Carey Rogers is frustrated that her sluggish campaign to unseat 
state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) has fallen far short of the cash 
needed to capitalize on the growing voter dissatisfaction with incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
"The surveys show that a woman running against a male incumbent has an 
automatic 10% advantage," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Rogers, a security alarm saleswoman in Santa Barbara, her 
campaign is broke. After nearly $11,000 in expenses, financial records show her 
campaign had $130 in cash and $3,500 in debts as of Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating her quest is the massive size of the 18th Senate District with 
326,000 registered voters stretching from Woodland Hills in Los Angeles County 
north to Santa Barbara County. Furthermore, Democrats hold a commanding edge in 
the district, with 21,000 more voters than the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Hart has decided to run a low-key campaign. "My opponent has not shown her face 
in most parts of the district," Hart said. "We spend as much time and money as 
we need to. We haven't had to spend much." 
</P>
<P>
Also on the ballot is Libertarian Party candidate Jay C. Wood, an office 
machine salesman in Fillmore who is making his second run against Hart.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CARLSBAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The parents of a Carlsbad man murdered in January, 1989, by his estranged wife 
were awarded $1.2 million in a wrongful-death lawsuit decided by a Vista 
Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
The assessment was made by Judge Franklin Mitchell against Roberta Pearce, who 
was convicted of first-degree murder for enlisting the help of two teen-age 
boys in stabbing to death Robert (Wayne) Pearce outside his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The two boys were ordered to share part of the assessment. 
</P>
<P>
But Dennis Atchley, the attorney for the victim's divorced parents, Charles 
Pearce and Rita Church, said it was unlikely the Illinois couple will ever 
collect more than $40,000, which was her share of the equity of the couple's 
Valley Center home before the murder. Roberta Pearce, a one-time teacher's aide 
at Escondido's Orange Glen High School, has since declared bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
She was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, and the 
two boys, Isaac Hill and Anthony Pilato -- who were 15 at the time they stabbed 
Pearce to death -- are in the custody of the California Youth Authority until 
they turn 25. 
</P>
<P>
Pearce's attorney, Thomas Nares, called the award "pretty much meaningless. It 
could have been for $5 million," he said. "It wouldn't make much difference. 
It's all kind of moot."

BIDS SOLICITED FOR LANCASTER PRISON DESPITE PENDING SUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State corrections officials will begin accepting bids Monday for construction 
of the $50-million housing unit of a planned state prison in Lancaster. 
Construction is scheduled to begin by January, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Prison opponents criticized the decision to proceed with bidding on the west 
Lancaster site, saying the state is risking taxpayer money because the prison 
still faces legal challenges. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court hearing is set for Nov. 14 on lawsuits by the city 
and Los Angeles County challenging the constitutionality of prison-siting 
legislation. The city and county also plan to appeal a judge's decision last 
month rejecting lawsuits that challenged the environmental review of the site. 
</P>
<P>
But corrections officials said the prison has already been delayed by the legal 
fight and said the judge's decision made it clear that they can move forward. 
Bids for the $50-million contract will be opened Dec. 6, officials said. The 
2,200-bed, maximum- and medium-security prison is scheduled to open in 1992.

INCUMBENTS HAVE PLENTY OF FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County's two congressmen have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars 
more in campaign contributions than their challengers, according to recent 
reports, further bolstering their reelection prospects despite the much-touted 
anti-incumbent mood sweeping the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) has raised $324,368 this year and has 
$211,798 on hand. His opponent, Democrat Richard D. Freiman of Agoura, reports 
raising $9,035. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura), the county's other congressman, has 
raised $273,831 and has $155,279 in cash to finance radio and television ads 
and campaign mailers in the final days before the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino's opponent, Democrat Anita Perez Ferguson, has done better than 
most challengers by raising $115,127 through Sept. 30. Yet, expenses had 
reduced her cash to $22,730 for her final appeal to the voters, according to 
finance reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Rodriguez, Ferguson's campaign manager, said his candidate has attracted an 
infusion of contributions in recent weeks since she filed the campaign report. 
He said Ferguson has about $70,000 for campaign mailers, radio and television 
ads. 
</P>
<P>
But Bob Wickers, a consultant to Lagomarsino's campaign, said he and his staff 
have found no evidence that Ferguson has bought any significant amount of radio 
or television time to broadcast her message. 
</P>
<P>
Lopsided spending in congressional races is not unique to Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Common Cause, the political reform group, reported that 
only 23 of the 405 House members seeking reelection face opponents who had 
raised even half of what the incumbents could spend. Of the rest, 78 have no 
major party opposition and 218 have opponents who raised less than $25,000 as 
of Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
With a 98% average reelection rate, most congressional incumbents represent 
districts considered so safe and face so little active opposition that they 
spend only a fraction of their large stockpile of funds. 
</P>
<P>
Some dip into their treasuries for non-campaign costs, such as travel, staff 
meals, charitable donations and contributions to other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
In large part, the incumbent advantage comes from special-interest money 
channeled through political action committees, or PACS. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Gallegly received $74,987, or 23% of his total, from PACs. The 
list of these corporate donors includes $3,000 from Litton Employees PAC and 
$1,500 from the American Medical PAC. He also received $1,000 from the Aircraft 
Owners PAC; BUILD PAC; the Cooperative of American Physicians PAC; the National 
Restaurant Assn. PAC; Transamerica Insurance PAC and the Women's Alliance for 
Israel PAC. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino also received a large number of contributions from PACs, including 
$3,000 from Raytheon's PAC; $1,400 from Pacific Gas &amp; Electric's Federal 
Good Government Fund; and PAC donations from the employees of Hughes Aircraft, 
General Dynamics, Dow Chemical, Manville Corp., Bank of America and Philip 
Morris.

VISITORS GET A FEEL FOR ARTWORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visitors to the Antelope Valley College Art Gallery say you don't just see the 
latest art exhibit, you experience it. And that's exactly what Cynthia Minet, 
29, had in mind when she created it. 
</P>
<P>
Minet, who teaches art history, painting and drawing at the school, said she 
believes art should be a participatory experience. Combining sculpture and 
painting, she creates three-dimensional reliefs that invite the viewer to make 
aesthetic decisions by manipulating the works on display. 
</P>
<P>
For example, one piece contains a working scaffold that allows viewers to 
adjust the height by pulling on cords. Another work has a trap door. 
</P>
<P>
"If the viewer can manipulate aspects of the artwork, then they can really 
participate in the piece to a greater degree than just having to stand there," 
Minet said. 
</P>
<P>
Minet credits part of the evolution of her style to environment. She spent most 
of her childhood in Rome. It was there that she became enamored by art that 
spanned centuries and seemed to be everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Rome also was the home of Dmitri Hadzi, a family friend and an internationally 
renowned sculptor. "I remember going to see his studio when I was little, and 
he was in the midst of this huge plaster mold. It was enormous and he was 
standing up inside it. I thought that was the neatest thing," Minet said. 
</P>
<P>
While a student at a West Los Angeles high school, Minet met Susan Weinberg, a 
Santa Monica artist and teacher who helped nurture her budding talent in 
painting and drawing. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until nearly a decade later, after she earned a master's degree 
in fine art from San Francisco State University, that Minet merged sculpture 
with painting and drawing. 
</P>

"Once I finished school, I began working out of a much smaller room. Out of 
necessity, my work became smaller," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, because storage was a problem, hanging the work on the wall provided an 
answer. "And since I respond better, three-dimensionally to things, I started 
building the pieces out from the wall," she said.

Her work will be shown until Wednesday at the college during regular art

ASBESTOS REMOVAL IS CONTINUING

<P>
Asbestos, a fire retardant mineral that has been shown to cause lung cancer, is 
being removed from the Pierce College campus. 
</P>
<P>
A 1982 Certified Laboratory Inc. test showed asbestos to be in 76% of the 
Woodland Hills college's buildings. 
</P>
<P>
It is now being removed from the boiler room of the machine-automotive 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos already has been removed from the agricultural-science building, the 
business education building and the school's cafeteria, said Kelly Simpson, who 
is in charge of the removal for Long &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
There will be more asbestos removal projects in the future, Simpson said. "It's 
an ongoing process." 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos removal projects are precarious because during such removal, there is 
a potential danger of releasing the fiber into the air, the very thing such 
projects try to prevent, Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the work was done during the summer when the buildings were not in use. 
Also, because of the danger, removal projects are initiated only when leaving 
the mineral in place represents a greater danger than its removal, Simpson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of the removal, many of the buildings will still contain 
asbestos, but only two, the automotive laboratory and the men's gym lobby, will 
still contain "friable" asbestos, Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
Friable asbestos is asbestos that can easily be crumbled and has a greater 
danger of being released into the air. DAN DOW

PREP FOOTBALL: MISSION VIEJO BEATS SECOND-RANKED CAPISTRANO VALLEY, 28-13, TO 
SET UP SHOWDOWN WITH NO. 1 EL TORO.

<TEXT>
<P>
Mission Viejo High School Coach Mike Rush worried all week about Capistrano 
Valley's big-play offense. The Cougars, he knew, not only scored a lot of 
points, but they had the ability to score them quickly. 
</P>
<P>
But Rush's concerns were put to rest Friday night. When all was played an done, 
it was the Diablos who had made the big plays. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo turned Cougar mistakes into points in the second half and came 
away with a 28-13 victory in front of 6,000 at Mission Viejo High School. The 
victory sets up a showdown for first place in South Coast League next week when 
Mission Viejo (7-1, 3-0) faces El Toro, the No. 1-ranked team in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how tough this league is," said Rush, whose team is ranked sixth. "We 
got El Toro next week, so we have to start planning tomorrow. We don't have 
much time to celebrate this one." 
</P>
<P>
Rush might find a moment to acknowledge the performance of quarterback Tim 
Snowden, who overcame early mistakes to throw two touchdown passes. Or maybe 
Rush will stop to admire the Diablo defense, which controlled a potent 
Capistrano Valley offense and forced two key turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
But undoubtedly Rush will find time to relish the running of Marcellus 
Chrishon, his senior tailback. 
</P>
<P>
Chrishon gained 165 yards rushing in 26 carries. Although hounded by the Cougar 
defense, he got stronger as the game progressed, gaining 99 yards in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Chrishon also scored on runs of 39 and 23 yards in the fourth quarter to help 
the Diablos break open a close game. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt we could wear Capo down," Rush said. "In the second half, our kids 
could see it in their eyes." 
</P>
<P>
That was a fact that not even Capistrano Valley Coach Eric Patton could deny. 
</P>
<P>
"Plain and simple, they kicked our butts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The score was tied, 7-7, at halftime, but the Diablo defense turned things 
around early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars drove to the Mission Viejo eight-yard line on their second 
possession of the third quarter. However, on a second-and-two play, Jeremy 
Brion fumbled and Beau LeBreton recovered. Three plays later, Snowden, who 
finished 10 of 17 for 176 yards, hit Anthony Ramirez for an 87-yard touchdown 
pass to break the tie. 
</P>
<P>
"The fumble was the play that really hurt us," Patton said. "I think that had a 
bad psychological effect on our team." 
</P>
<P>
A blocked field goal attempt by Kurt Neuhausen only deepened the depression. 
The Cougars had driven to the Mission Viejo 25, but on fourth down, Neuhausen 
broke through the middle of the line to block Tomek Mikler's 42-yard field goal 
try. 
</P>
<P>
Neuhausen recovered the ball at the Capistrano Valley 39. On the next play, 
Chrishon burst through the line and sprinted untouched for a 39-yard touchdown 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley, ranked second in the county, did cut the deficit to 21-13 
midway through the fourth quarter. Quarterback Tony Solliday, who had 291 yards 
passing, threw a swing pass to Brion, who weaved his way through the Diablo 
secondary for a 65-yard touchdown. The Cougars went for two, but Brion was 
stopped short of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo clinched the game with a 75-yard drive, which ended with Chrishon 
going 23 yards to score his second touchdown.

MORNING BRIEFING: WHEN DID PROBLEMS BEGIN? IT'S ACADEMIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If you're still catching up on those copies of Sports Illustrated piled next to 
your night stand, you might want to skim ahead to Page 56 of the Sept. 3 issue, 
near the end of Douglas S. Looney's cover story on USC quarterback Todd 
Marinovich. 
</P>
<P>
Looney wrote that Marinovich could turn professional early, adding: "Another 
indication that he might not stay at USC for the full term is that, as his 2.23 
grade-point average attests, he has little interest in being a student." 
</P>
<P>
Add Marinovich: Tuesday, he was suspended by Coach Larry Smith and will not 
play in today's game against Arizona State at Tempe, Ariz., partly because, 
Smith said, Marinovich violated a team rule by repeatedly missing classes. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sports Illustrated story, Marinovich told Looney: "One of the first 
things the older guys laid on me when I got here was that C's get degrees, and 
sometimes D's." 
</P>
<P>
Smith told Looney: "(Marinovich's) biggest academic weakness is getting up." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What do the Boxing Hall of Fame, the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame and 
the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Hall of Fame have in common? 
</P>
<P>
Cutting class, Part 2: We won't know until this afternoon whether Brigham Young 
quarterback Ty Detmer snatched victory from the jaws of defeat Friday. 
</P>
<P>
During a zoology lab session, Detmer was dissecting a shark when his scalpel 
slipped, opening a cut in the palm of his left (non-throwing) hand that 
required two stitches. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer practiced with the Cougars Friday but had no trouble taking snaps. And 
he's expected to have less trouble with New Mexico today than he had with the 
shark. 
</P>
<P>
No need: The Denton (Tex.) Record-Chronicle recently reported that during a 
girls' under-12 soccer game between the Lewisville Blaze and the Denton 
Solhers, the fathers of two Denton players became so frustrated with the 
outstanding play of Lewisville's 10-year-old goalie, Natasha Dennis, that they 
asked league officials to verify Natasha's gender. 
</P>
<P>
Said Natasha: "I think they should go somewhere and check and see if they have 
anything between their ears." 
</P>
<P>
Buhdeeuhbuhdeeuhbuhdee: Tom Archdeacon of the Dayton Daily News, reporting on 
Evander Holyfield's third-round knockout of Buster Douglas, began his story: 
"As one Porky now should say to the other: 'That's all, folks!' " 
</P>
<P>
Expert commentary: Before Thursday night's heavyweight championship bout, Times 
staff writer Thomas Bonk briefed his 3-year-old son, Tanner, on the names of 
the fighters. 
</P>
<P>
Friends came over to watch the fight, and Tanner joined the group. 
</P>
<P>
Friday at breakfast, Bonk pointed to the photo on Page 1 of The Times' sports 
section, which showed Douglas lying on the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
Bonk asked: "Who's this guy?" 
</P>
<P>
Said Tanner: "Buster Gutless." 
</P>
<P>
She's no whiner: After her Independence (W. Va.) High School girls' basketball 
team had lost to Princeton High this week, Coach Kathy Daniels said: "It's a 
little ridiculous. I'm upset about it." 
</P>
<P>
Princeton won, 116-7. 
</P>
<P>
Add girls' basketball: Asked about the halftime discussion in the Princeton 
locker room, assistant coach Robin Beamer said: "There's not a whole lot to go 
over when you're up 59-1." 
</P>
<P>
Princeton Coach Debbie Ball denied that she was trying to run up the score, 
adding: "I could've put them in a full-court press." 
</P>
<P>
With good reason: From the Associated Press, previewing one of today's eastern 
college football matchups: "First things first. While a date with Notre Dame 
looms ever closer, Navy will not be looking past James Madison toward next 
week's encounter with the third-ranked Fighting Irish." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: None of them has a building. 
</P>

Quotebook: Montreal Expo third baseman Tim Wallach, on being named the team's 
most valuable player for the second consecutive season: "I don't know if it's

Foothill High School scored first but failed to score again, remaining winless 
as it fell to Orange, 12-7, Friday night at Tustin High School. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill's Sean Saunders broke free and ran 56 yards to put the Knights on the 
scoreboard early in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Keo Powell kicked the extra point. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange fought back, with quarterback Josh Belovsky running 37 yards for a 
touchdown late in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Remmel put Orange in front in the second quarter when he ran 25 yards for 
a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill quarterback Tim Chaix was sacked three times by the Panther defense, 
and threw an interception with two minutes left to play. 
</P>
<P>
Belovsky completed seven of 13 passes for 65 yards and Remmel gained 60 yards 
in 16 carries to pace Orange (4-3-1 overall, 1-1-1 in Century League play), 
while Foothill (0-7, 0-2) was led by Saunders' 117 yards in 15 carries. MARGIE

Valencia High School's offense displayed textbook ball control as the Tigers 
stayed undefeated with a 28-7 Orange League victory over Western Friday at 
Handel Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Led by the backfield trio of John Fewell, Ryan Roskelly and Willie Barnes, 
Valencia gained 370 yards on the ground and limited the Pioneers to one 
possession in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes and Roskelly gave the Tigers (8-0, 3-0) a 14-0 second-quarter lead on 
runs of 18 and eight yards. But Western (3-5, 1-2) made the score 14-7 with 17 
seconds left in the first half on a five-yard pass from Gil Brito to Alfredo 
Villegas to cap a 10-play, 69-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia put the game out of reach with two second-half touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The first was an eight-yard pass from Marc O'Brian to Korey Alexandar in the 
third quarter. The final score, a three-yard run by Fewell with 8:27 to play, 
capped a 65-yard drive of 11 plays, all of which were runs. SCOTT JONES

Backup quarterback Kirk Pierce connected on a 51-yard desperation pass to 
Enrique Gonzalez with two seconds left to give Westminster High School a 23-17 
victory over Huntington Beach in a Sunset League game Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach (5-3, 2-3) had taken the lead 51 seconds earlier when senior 
Alex Acocello hit a 22-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions (3-4-1, 2-1-1) took the kickoff and moved to their own 49. Then 
Pierce entered the game. 
</P>
<P>
With 10 seconds left, Pierce threw an incompletion, but with two seconds left, 
he connected with Gonzalez in the right corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster led, 10-7, at halftime. The Lions' Lucas Jones ran 13 yards for a 
touchdown with 10:10 left in the second quarter, and Ken Scott kicked a 37-yard 
field goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers scored on a 20-yard pass from Mike Chavira to Gabe Stupin. 
</P>
<P>
Gabe Houston's one-yard run put Huntington Beach up, 14-10. 
</P>
<P>
With 6:37 left, Vance Senteno ran for six yards to put Westminster back in 
front, 16-14. The PAT failed after a bad snap. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach took the ensuing kickoff and kept the ball for almost five 
minutes before Acocello's field goal. HEATHER SMALLEY

SUNNY HILLS RUNS OVER SLUMPING LA HABRA

<P>
The prospects of a promising season continued to fade for La Habra High 
School's football team Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The La Habra fans among the 2,800 on hand for the school's 34th homecoming game 
had little to celebrate. Sunny Hills rolled up 239 yards rushing and breezed to 
a 26-0 victory in a Freeway League game that all but eliminated La Habra from 
postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra (4-4, 0-3) has been outscored, 80-0, in its past two games. Only three 
weeks ago, La Habra concluded nonleague play with a surprising 4-1 record and 
appeared to be a strong contender for the league title. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunny Hills (5-3, 3-0) will have the distinction of the playing for the 
league championship next week against Fullerton (7-1, 3-0). 
</P>
<P>
La Habra Coach Jack Nichols thinks Sunny Hills' simple approach will carry the 
Lancers to their second consecutive league title. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not very fancy, but they don't make mistakes," Nichols said. "They 
keep everything simple and just execute. They're the best team in the league." 
</P>
<P>
Running backs Kenny Overby and Mike Sullivan proved Nichols' point. Both were 
at their blue-collar best with Sullivan gaining 130 yards in 17 carries and 
Overby adding 93 yards in 15 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Tim Devaney did try to add a new wrinkle to Sunny Hills' basic offense, 
but it wasn't exactly a huge success. Quarterback Hakiem McKenzie went to a 
rollout passing attack, but completed only four of eight pass attempts for 37 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still a little ways away," Devaney said. "We tried rolling out McKenzie, 
because we think that's what he can do best. At times, I thought it worked 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Few could find fault with Sunny Hills' running game, though. The Lancers had 
136 yards rushing in the first half as Overby, Sullivan and McKenzie took turns 
dashing through holes in La Habra's line. Sullivan scored Sunny Hills' first 
touchdown, slanting off left tackle and running untouched for a 35-yard score. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive back Brent Howes set up Sunny Hills' second touchdown when he 
recovered a fumbled punt return at La Habra's 15-yard line. Four plays later, 
Overby scored on a one-yard run but the conversion kick failed and the Lancers 
had to be content with a 13-0 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra mounted its only sustained drive of the game in the final 1:13 of the 
first half. Quarterback Greg Mitchell, who was ineffective most of the game, 
completed a 19-yard pass to Steve Busch for a first down at midfield, but the 
half ended as kicker Bryan Cierley's 47-yard field goal attempt fell just 
short. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell was five for 17 for only 37 yards and completed only one pass in the 
second half. La Habra played without tailback Jason Johnson, the county's 
second-leading rusher with 978 yards. Johnson sat out the game with bruised 
ribs suffered in last week's 54-0 loss to Buena Park.

Troy High School's vaunted passing attack was no match for the unpretentious 
option running of Fullerton, which wound up with a 14-7 Freeway League football 
victory Friday night at Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
The decisive touchdown came after Troy's punter, Chad Hartford, bobbled a high 
snap, and Fullerton's Matt Milligan recovered the ball at the Troy 49. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (7-1, 3-0), scored 10 plays later on David Chacon's two-yard run with 
3:59 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's defense sacked Troy quarterback Greg Windle five times for minus 38 
yards and applied enough pressure to take away any advantage one of Orange 
County's leading passers might have had. 
</P>
<P>
Windle completed 12 of 26 attempts for 148 yards. He entered the game with more 
than 1,500 yards passing. 
</P>
<P>
Troy (3-5, 1-2) took a 7-0 lead when Windle hit Steve Friedrich for a five-yard 
touchdown on the opening possession. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton tied the score on the opening possession of the second half, using 
six minutes to go 62 yards to D.C. Olsen's one-yard run. DENNIS KAISER

La Quinta High School broke open a tight Garden Grove League game by scoring 
four fourth-quarter touchdowns to remain undefeated with a 43-14 homecoming 
victory over host Bolsa Grande Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 15-14, with 10 minutes remaining, the Aztecs (8-0, 5-0 in league) got 
the break they needed when Don Hopkins recovered a Matador fumble on the Bolsa 
Grande 17-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Hopkins hit halfback Walter Dawkins with a 21-yard scoring 
pass with 9:06 remaining for a 21-14 Aztec lead. 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa Grande (2-6, 1-4) stayed close until failing on a fourth-down play on its 
own 24-yard line with 5:22 remaining to set up Hopkins' 10-yard scoring pass to 
Justin Sogoian with 3:07 left. The Aztecs turned the game into a route with 
pass interception returns of 51 yards by George Sanchez and 45 yards by Dawkins 
for late scores. 
</P>
<P>
For Bolsa Grande, Maurice Wilson ran for 134 yards and one touchdown in 18 
carries and Marcus Wilson added 88 yards and another touchdown in 23 carries. 
Hopkins led the La Quinta offense with 14 pass completions in 22 attempts for 
two touchdowns. TOM BIRSCHBACH

Rob Johnson threw three touchdown passes to lead No. 1-ranked El Toro to a 33-6 
victory over Dana Hills in a South Coast League game at Dana Hills Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro (8-0, 3-0 in league) scored 21 consecutive points in the fourth quarter 
after Dana Hills (3-4-1, 0-3) surprised the Chargers by trailing by just 12-6 
after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Johnson's touchdown passes were in the fourth quarter. The first went to 
Bret Sanders for 30 yards, and the second went to Wade Jackson for 26 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson completed 15 of 21 passes for 192 yards and threw one interception. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders was the game's leading rusher with 93 yards in 16 carries and one 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers drove 66 yards for the game's first touchdown midway through the 
second quarter. Brad Hulse caught a 17-yard pass from Johnson for the score. 
Shaun Coleman blocked the extra-point attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills then drove from its own 20 to the El Toro eight before settling for 
a 21-yard field goal by John Ashley to make it 6-3 with 1 minute 30 seconds 
left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
But El Toro's James Rios returned the ensuing kickoff 52 yards to the Dana 
Hills 35, and following a 24-yard pass from Johnson to Jackson, Sanders scored 
from the one.

ESPERANZA BEATS EL DORADO, BUT NOT CONVINCINGLY

He looked at the final numbers on the scoreboard Friday night, but Esperanza 
High School Coach Gary Meek knew they don't always tell the whole story. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll take 26 points anytime," Meek said. 
</P>
<P>
Meek left out was the "but . . . " But you could tell he was thinking it. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza scored enough to beat visiting El Dorado, 26-10, in an Empire League 
game at Valencia High. But the game matching the top-ranked team in Southern 
Section Division III against the league's cellar-dwellers was closer than the 
scoreboard suggested. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Esperanza (8-0, 3-0 in league), the county's fourth-ranked team, outgained 
its crosstown rival by a mere 15 yards (290 to 275). 
</P>
<P>
 -- El Dorado (1-7, 0-3), which hasn't won since the season opener, had to 
settle for one successful field goal and three missed ones at the end of four 
solid drives. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado scored its only touchdown on a seven-yard pass from Jason Bluth to 
tight end Mike Roth. Bluth passed for a season-high 163 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza scored on its first play, a 10-yard run by Garrick Emry after Jason 
Perez's interception on El Dorado's first possession. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs stretched the lead to 13-3 in the first quarter on a 32-yard pass 
from Keith McDonald to Reid Pullen, who holds Esperanza's record for career 
touchdown catches. STUART MATTHEWS

Senior running back Quoc Pham ran for 199 yards and two touchdowns to lead 
Costa Mesa High School to a 51-14 Pacific Coast League victory over Laguna 
Beach Friday night at Guyer Field. 
</P>
<P>
Pham, a 5-10, 170-pound senior, got his yardage on only 17 carries and was 
taken out of the game early in the third quarter after suffering a hamstring 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa (4-4, 2-1) broke the game open early after junior cornerback Matt 
Jaglowski picked off a pass at the Laguna Beach 35-yard line on the third play 
of the game. Three plays later, Pham scored his first touchdown from three 
yards out, the first of 21 Mustang points in the opening quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach (2-6, 0-3) scored in the second period when junior wide receiver 
Eric Fegraus caught a 10-yard pass from quarterback Morgan Lanchantin. 
</P>
<P>
But Costa Mesa came right back with another touchdown on an eight-play, 86-yard 
drive, capped by Pham's 35-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs added nine points in the last 40 seconds. Adam Hernandez tackled 
Lanchantin in the end zone after a bad snap from center, and senior running 
back David Phillips then scooped up a loose ball on the ensuing kickoff and ran 
45 yards for the game's final score. LEN HALL

Kelly Roda led Irvine High School to the girls' South Coast League 
cross-country championship, and Daniel Niednagel of Dana Hills won the boys' 
race and helped the Dolphins to the co-championship Friday at Laguna Niguel 
Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine girls, who placed four runners in the top 10, had 40 points to Dana 
Hills' 63. El Toro was third with 76. Roda, a sophomore, won in 18 minutes 12 
seconds for the three miles; teammate Jennifer Gillis was second (18:34). 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the teams' regular-season league record and league-meet finish, 
Irvine advanced to the Nov. 10 Southern Section prelims at Mt. San Antonio 
College as the South Coast's No. 1 team, followed by Mission Viejo and Dana 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro won the Friday's boys' race with 38 points. Dana Hills was second (50) 
and Mission Viejo third (71). El Toro and Dana Hills shared the league 
championship, followed by Mission Viejo. All three teams advanced to the 
Southern Section meet. 
</P>
<P>
Niednagel, the top boys' runner in the county and one of the best in the state, 
ran unchallenged, winning the three-mile race by 200 yards in 15:17. El Toro's 
Rick Matson was second in 15:47, and teammate Blake Rothschild was third 
(16:00). 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills ran without its No. 2 runner, Brendan Sullivan, who was diagnosed 
Monday as having a stress fracture of his left femur. 
</P>
<P>
Niednagel, a senior who hopes to advance through Southern Section prelims and 
finals to the Nov. 24 state meet, said he wanted to run close to 15 minutes 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed some fast races to prepare for the next few weeks of competition," he 
said. "So I needed to get a real fast one in today." 
</P>
<P>
The Dana Hills girls, ranked second in the county, were led by Raja Espinosa's 
fourth-place finish in 18:56. Dana Hills, which had early-season problems with 
injuries, won one league meet during the season, its first in two seasons.

TODAY'S CARD A MARATHON SESSION

<TEXT>
<P>
Today isn't a day for faint-hearted horseplayers at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
There will be 14 races on which to wager, beginning with the seven Breeders' 
Cup events at 10:55 a.m. After the Breeders' Cup Classic, there will be seven 
races run locally. 
</P>
<P>
The feature, which will be run as the 13th race, is the $84,600 Morvich 
Handicap at 6 1/2 furlongs on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
Oraibi is the probable favorite in the Morvich, which has attracted 10 other 
starters. 
</P>
<P>
Third in the Legend's Last Ride in February, Oraibi was injured in the race and 
went to stud for a time at agent Tony Matos' farm in Llano. Oraibi, trained by 
Richard Mandella, has won six of his 18 starts, but only one of his victories 
has been on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he has never been worse than third on the grass and he was second to 
Shirkee in his comeback two weeks ago on the course. Julio Garcia will ride 
Oraibi, who is the high weight at 118 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Other probable contenders in the Morvich include Frost Free, Snipledo, Robyn 
Dancer, Doyouseewhatisee and Sam Who. 
</P>
<P>
The beaten favorite in the Budweiser Breeders' Cup Handicap at Bay Meadows last 
month, Frost Free will be looking for his second victory in three turf starts 
for trainer John Sadler. The gelded son of It's Freezing worked six furlongs in 
1:12 4/5 Sunday and Jorge Velasquez has the mount. 
</P>
<P>
Snipledo's six-race winning streak ended when he ran fifth in the Ancient Title 
Handicap and he will be making his grass debut. Robyn Dancer is a late threat 
who was fourth behind Oraibi two Saturdays ago, Doyouseewhatisee handled a 
lesser field on the layout Oct. 4 and Sam Who is trying to remember how he used 
to do it. A starter in the Breeders' Cup Sprint last year, he is winless in 
seven 1990 starts and has been the beaten choice four times. 
</P>
<P>
Others scheduled to go include Go On In, Gallant Sailor, Yes I'm Blue, Sulaymi 
and Waterscape. 
</P>
<P>
Stylish Star, who won the Autumn Days Handicap on opening day, heads a field of 
12 fillies and mares in Sunday's $114,600 Louis R. Rowan Handicap at a mile on 
the turf. 
</P>
<P>
Stylish Star, a four-year-old, ended a six-race losing streak with her 
come-from-behind victory in the Autumn Days. Her last two successes have been 
at 6 1/2 furlongs, but she has won around two turns. Eddie Delahoussaye rides 
for trainer Dan Hendricks. 
</P>
<P>
Oeilladine, who didn't have clear sailing when third behind Sweet Roberta and 
Brown Bess in the California Jockey Club at Bay Meadows three weeks ago, is the 
filly to beat. She has won two of four starts on the Santa Anita grass and is 
reunited with Gary Stevens, who was aboard for both of those victories. 
</P>
<P>
The other Rowan entrants are Baba Cool, who won the race last year, Polar Bird, 
Estrella Fuega, Mystical Lass, Petalia, Spectacular Face, Kikala, Something 
Comfy, Chispa Brava and Island Jamboree. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Gates will open at 8 a.m. at Santa Anita. . . . Favored Sexy Slew easily won 
the $61,250 Dark Star Handicap Friday at Santa Anita. Ridden by Kent Desormeaux 
and trained by David Hofmans, she defeated Tis Juliet and four other fillies 
and mares, covering the seven furlongs in 1:21 2/5.

Morse's football team is so good that its quarterback, Teddy Lawrence, showed 
up with a stiff back Friday afternoon and then led his team to a 40-13 thumping 
of Point Loma in the City Eastern League's version of Holyfield-Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
This game was the subject of a heaping spoonful of buildup. If there was a team 
capable of toppling Morse, surely it was the second-ranked Pointers (6-1, 1-1). 
And Point Loma Coach Bennie Edens assured everybody that his group did indeed 
have a chance against the neighborhood bullies. 
</P>
<P>
But a crowd of about 3,000 at Point Loma High saw Morse (8-0, 2-0) dismantle 
its hosts in methodical fashion, overcoming a talented defense to amass 363 
yards total offense and leave Pointer running back Marlon Manassa asking for 
help at the day's end. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody says that I'm the heart of the offense," said Manassa, who finished 
with 15 carries for 49 yards. "If it's true that I'm the heart of the offense 
then there's something wrong with our team. I don't like that title. If it's 
true, we have to come up with something else." 
</P>
<P>
While they do that, Morse players and coaches will continue to field this 
question: Is Morse one of San Diego's best high school teams ever? 
</P>
<P>
Here's the opinion of Morse lineman Salua Poutoa: "This is the best team in San 
Diego history. I think we should be No. 1 in the nation. But we can't let our 
heads get big yet." 
</P>
<P>
And now for something slightly more objective. 
</P>
<P>
"They're one of the better ones," Edens said. "It's hard to compare years. I 
feel they're as good as any team in the state." 
</P>
<P>
The only thing missing is a crisp passing attack. You needed only to see 
Lawrence attempt to throw on a muffed PAT in the first quarter to realize he is 
not the next coming of John Elway. The ball floated like a punt, though, in all 
fairness, it carried farther than most of Point Loma's punts. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Lawrence doesn't really need to throw the ball. He runs so well that a 
passing attack would almost be overkill. Friday he had an off day. He rushed 
eight times for 121 yards. Yes, that's an off day. The average per carry is 
only 15.1. He entered the game with a 20.1-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nobody like him," Morse Coach John Shacklett said. "I've never coached 
anyone like him." 
</P>
<P>
Hard to stop a guy who thinks like this: "On most of our plays," Lawrence said, 
"if I get past the line of scrimmage I'm going to score." 
</P>
<P>
That didn't exactly hold true, but Lawrence put the Tigers ahead, 26-0, with a 
59-yard keeper in the third quarter. Then, after the Pointers scored twice to 
make it 26-13 with 9:20 to play, Lawrence threw a rare pass to receiver Tommy 
Bennett, who plucked the ball over cornerback Shaun Grove for a 23-yard 
touchdown. Lawrence wrapped his day in the final minutes with a 38-yard 
touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma's passing game was noticeably absent, which can partially be 
attributed to a wrist injury in the second quarter to quarterback Toby Gault. 
He was taken for X-rays, but returned in time to lead the Pointers to their 
only touchdown drive of the day in the third quarter. That covered 87 yards in 
five plays, Gault finding yardage on three consecutive screen passes and 
capping it with one-yar run. 
</P>
<P>
The Pointers, who managed only 111 yards total offense, scored their other 
points in the fourth quarter after defensive end La'Roi Glover stripped the 
ball from running back Gary Taylor (16 rushes, 103 yards) at the Morse 11 and 
returned it to the five. Two plays later, Gault hit tight end Charles Ensey in 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The Pointers were through, though Manassa let all his Morse pals know afterward 
that Point Loma is looking forward to seeing them in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll see you all in a few weeks," he said. "That was the first half."

James Casebere is one of a generation of photographers whose work eschews fact 
for fiction. 
</P>
<P>
Sculptors and dramatists as much as photo-technicians, these artists apparently 
have been influenced more by the narratives of film and television than still 
photography. The larger-than-life glossies of one-shot dramas by Casebere, 
Cindy Sherman, Nic Nicosia, Laurie Simmons and a slew of other artists in their 
mid-to-late 30s and early 40s first came to light during the early 1980s. And 
after their first big splash in museum shows and national magazines, their 
works have had varying degrees of critical success. 
</P>
<P>
Among these artists, the New York-based Casebere, 37, is one of the least 
interesting. Virtually a one-note purist, Casebere has created colorless, 
unpeopled images of dramatic settings that are badly in need of something to 
say. A selection of Casebere's photographs made since 1985 opened this week at 
the Museum of Photographic Arts in San Diego, along with a room-sized 
sculptural installation. The show continues through Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the black-and-white medium that makes these pictures so monochrome. 
It is the repetitive theme of desolation. Alone, the images seem pristine, 
simple, perhaps even evocative. Grouped together they are simply empty. 
</P>
<P>
With the massive wood sculpture "Tree 
</P>
<P>
Trunk with Broken Bungalow and Shotgun Houses," 1988, as its centerpiece, this 
show evidently is an attempt to highlight the artist's move from behind the 
camera lens into the realm of three-dimensional staging. All of Casebere's work 
involves sculpture; for the photos, he crafted elaborate landscapes with 
houses, trees, fences and more. He also made still lifes with bowls, boards and 
artificial plants -- all of which show up in the photos in the same shade of 
gray. 
</P>
<P>
The construction of the objects in the photographs -- their smooth surfaces and 
unadorned shapes -- suggest the careful craftsmanship of a potter or toy maker. 
Often, they are quite beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
What is surprising, then, is the rough-hewn nature of the actual 
three-dimensional work that so dominates this show. It was designed by Casebere 
as an extension of his photographic images, but was constructed by carpenters 
for a show two years ago at the University of South Florida in Tampa. Big, 
bulky and boring, it lacks even the minimal mystery and controlled drama of the 
photos. 
</P>
<P>
An image of the calm after a storm, the wreckage after a hurricane, the 13 
1/2-foot-high sculpture is a pile of stuff scrunched together, including a 
house, boat, wagon wheel, surf board, and some surveillance cameras. Its 
holocaust theme, however, tends to explain the meaning behind some of the other 
works here. Dark and dramatically lit in the photos and in the gallery, 
Casebere appears to be suggesting that all of his works represent the aftermath 
of something utterly horrible. 
</P>
<P>
Just what that event was, however, is never made concrete in any way. Casebere 
depends far too much upon our imaginations. The work lacks all sense of 
humanity, so its hard to care what happened. The objects have no character or 
peculiarities, so they can't be identified with an individual owner, even an 
anonymous one. 
</P>
<P>
On every level, these works make it hard to care about them. It is hollow 
drama, art without heart.

FACES . . . : SNIPES IS RISING FAST WITH ROLES IN 'KING OF NEW YORK,' 'JUNGLE 
FEVER' 
</P>

Wesley Snipes gets fifth billing in the new ultra-bloody, ultra-violent "King 
of New York." He plays one of several cops out to stop a self-styled Robin Hood 
drug kingpin (Christopher Walken) who's determined to distribute his ill-gotten 
wealth to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
But remember Snipes' name -- it's rising fast. 
</P>
<P>
He gets top billing in "New Jack City," directed by Mario Van Peebles and due 
out early next year from Warner Bros., portraying a sophisticated, ruthless 
drug lord. 
</P>
<P>
And Snipes is starring in Spike Lee's "Jungle Fever," now shooting in New York 
City. Snipes, who portrays an upwardly mobile architect involved in a 
relationship with his white secretary, admits to some trepidation about the 
role. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been concerned about how to pull it off," he says of the acting stretch. 
"I'm very grass roots, he's a yuppie. I'm not a yuppie at all. I'm hard-core -- 
rough, man, rough. I grew up in the South Bronx." 
</P>
<P>
For all his professed street toughness, Snipes, 28, has plenty of professional 
polish. He appeared as a villain in Michael Jackson's "Bad" video, as an 
aspiring boxer in the film "Streets of Gold" and as a speedy baserunner in 
"Major League." 
</P>
<P>
But his strongest critical plaudits were earned in Lee's last film, "Mo' Better 
Blues," in which Snipes portrayed a jazz saxophonist whose cool demeanor belies 
a deeper caring and complexity. 
</P>
<P>
"The response to my work has been wonderful," says Snipes. "It's nice, because 
they comment on my work, rather than personal (aspects). They seem to respect 
me as a young cat who's a versatile actor coming up." 
</P>
<P>
He'd like to do more action films -- "the more action, the better" -- but he's 
also pleased with his rise to stardom. 
</P>
<P>
"I got no complaints," he says, while keeping his success in perspective. 
"We'll see how long it lasts." JOHN M. WILSON

FACES . . . : FREEMAN UPHOLDS BADDIE IMAGE IN 'WILD AT HEART,' 'MILLER'S 
CROSSING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

E. Freeman is getting recognized a lot these days. But people can't really 
place his face. "They don't know from where they saw me," he says, "but they 
know it's bad." 
</P>
<P>
Real bad. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, Freeman has played the baddest of the baddies. He was 
the villain in the CBS miniseries, "Fresno," a psycho in the Bette Midler 
comedy "Ruthless People," and a vicious gangster pursuing Nicolas Cage and 
Laura Dern in David Lynch's "Wild at Heart." He currently can be seen 
committing murders and creating devious mayhem in Joel and Ethan Coen's 
gangster melodrama "Miller's Crossing," as the Dane, a menacing hit man. 
</P>
<P>
"It was such a joy to read the script," says Freeman. "It had so many 
dimensions. I did the first scene at the audition for them (the Coen) and then 
they asked me to do all of my scenes. I even died on the sofa for them." 
</P>
<P>
Freeman defends the movie's brutal violence. "If you want to be true to the 
period (1929) you can't not be violent," he says. "I don't think there was any 
gratuitous violence. I did find it a little strange how Tom (the film's lead 
played by Gabriel Bryne) kept getting beat up and had no bruises." 
</P>
<P>
The actor got his part in "Wild at Heart" at the last minute. "They originally 
cast a musician," says Freeman, "and just before they were going to shoot, the 
musician went into the (recording) studio and wouldn't come out. On the first 
day, David Lynch just sat down with me and worked with me line by line. I had 
never done that with a director. They were ready to shoot and he made the crew 
wait." Freeman didn't start acting until 15 years ago at age 30. He signed up 
for a writing class in college, only to discover he was the only male among 15 
women. "I just didn't want to be the only male in that class," he says. So 
Freeman opted for a TV dramatic lab. The class changed his life. "Acting 
immediately put me in control of my own life. You have the words, you know what 
the emotions are and besides, I like the attention." SUSAN KING

CHILINGIRIAN QUARTET OPENS GUILD SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On the occasion of its appearance on Wednesday to open the new season of Music 
Guild concerts in the Wilshire Ebell Theatre, the Chilingirian String Quartet 
faced up to one of the mightiest challenges in the repertory. Schubert's vast 
Quartet in G, D. 887, is notorious locally for being programmed numerous times 
in recent seasons and ultimately replaced by less taxing -- of performers and 
listeners -- and familiar fare. 
</P>
<P>
Schubert's technical demands here make even those of the late-Beethoven 
quartets pale in comparison and it is structurally among the most intractable 
works in the repertory as well. This rapturous monster remains, however, one of 
the glories of Romantic chamber music, and the London-based ensemble -- 
violinists Levon Chilingirian and Mark Butler, violist Louise Williams, cellist 
Philip De Groote -- played it with a thrilling blend of rugged intensity and 
full-throated songfulness, boldly projecting its often grating harmonies even 
at the occasional expense -- well-warranted -- of ensemble elegance. All this 
in the face of nagging competition from the Ebell's new,all-too-audible 
air-conditioning system. 
</P>
<P>
With atmospheric problems successfully dealt with during intermission, musical 
problems surfaced during the evening's second large work, the F-minor Piano 
Quintet of Brahms, which the quartet will repeat in Laguna Beach tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Given Gerald Robbins' self-effacing, unincisive pianism -- an exception being 
his reasonably heated contribution to the Scherzo -- at an instrument that 
seemed to be heard through several layers of cotton batting, Brahms was hardly 
given his due. 
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, too much burden was placed on the strings, whose 
frequently strident, uncoordinated playing did not jibe with the secure, 
rich-toned and handsomely nuanced execution displayed in the big Schubert 
quartet and in the same composer's brief, potent C-minor "Quartettsatz," with 
which the very long evening had begun. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chilingirian String Quartet plays Brahms' F-minor Piano Quintet plus 
Haydn's Quartet in D, Opus 71, No. 2 and Prokofiev's Quartet in F, Opus 92 
tonight at 8 p.m. in the Laguna Beach High School Auditorium, 625 Park Ave., 
Laguna Beach. Tickets: $20. Presented by the Laguna Beach Chamber Music 
Society. Information: (714) 494-2822.

ALARMING TREND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a Costa Mesa resident, I am saddened by the outcry of certain residents and 
some of our council members to the production of "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains 
It All for You" (at the Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse). 
</P>
<P>
It reflects an alarming trend throughout our nation to judge and take offense 
to the method of presentation (of social commentary), rather than to look at 
the issues that commentary is addressing. Troubling and offending art is a 
symptom of things awry in social institutions; art is not the cause of the 
failure of these institutions. 
</P>
<P>
In reference to the play, some Catholics feel very well served by their church; 
others do not. "Sister Mary" is by one such Catholic who does not feel served. 
</P>
<P>
We have residents, council members and, sadly, even the Archdiocese of Orange 
feeling attacked and demanding the play not be (supported with) city funding. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the strength of any society or group comes from being able to acknowledge 
what does not work (even when brought to its attention in an uncomfortable and 
challenging way), and then to look for solutions. Playwright Durang's work 
should be accepted as a warning signal to the church and the community (which 
should seek) not to stop his message, but to ask how his disillusionment could 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
And let's not disguise this as a "not-with-taxpayer's-dollars" issue. 
</P>
<P>
We learned in the 1930s, from the Nazis, that today's "not with my money" is 
tomorrow's "not in my country" censorship and repression. The playhouse has 
presented more than 100 plays, only one of which has been considered 
controversial. That's less than 1%! To discredit the Playhouse over one 
production is irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest we take a poll and see, first of all, if anyone wants to contribute 
taxes to the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who do, determine the percentage that wants non-controversial and 
easy-viewing work, and the percentage that wants probing, challenging works, 
and then funds accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
Many of us, though not all, have the sense and maturity to see and hear satire, 
humor, beauty, repulsiveness or whatever is presented -- to look at why that 
message exists, and to commit ourselves to resolving it.

With the NBA regular season still six days away, football has the sports 
television weekend almost all to itself, with horse racing and hockey in the 
periphery. 
</P>
<P>
USC and UCLA fans may well have to summon plenty of patience today as they 
watch their troubled teams. The Todd Marinovich-less Trojans meet Arizona State 
at 12:30 p.m. on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42. UCLA (3-4), seeking to avoid 
back-to-back losing seasons for the first time since 1964-65, plays host to 
Oregon State for a 3:30 p.m. Prime Ticket telecast. The Beavers' 1-6 record may 
be of little solace to Bruin fans, who recall Oregon State's 18-17 upset win 
over UCLA last season. 
</P>
<P>
Both Notre Dame and Miami (Fla.), which met in the finale of their 
often-contentious series last Saturday, are on the air again this week. The No. 
3 Fighting Irish face Pittsburgh live at 5 p.m. on ESPN with an 8:30 p.m. 
delayed broadcast on SportsChannel, while the No. 8 Hurricanes visit Texas Tech 
at 10 a.m. on Prime Ticket. 
</P>
<P>
In other telecasts involving teams ranked in the Associated Press Top 25: No. 
12 Florida State plays host to LSU (9:30 a.m., TBS); No. 22 Oklahoma meets No. 
10 Colorado (11 a.m., Channels 2 and 8) and No. 23 Arizona faces Washington 
State (7 p.m., Prime Ticket). 
</P>
<P>
With the Raiders having a bye and the Rams playing on Monday night against the 
Pittsburgh Steelers, Los Angeles-area viewers will have three NFL games to 
choose from Sunday afternoon. That is a rarity in these parts because NFL rules 
permit only two Sunday afternoon telecasts on those days when either the Rams 
or Raiders are playing at home. 
</P>
<P>
KCBS Channel 2 begins an NFL doubleheader at 10 a.m. with the underachieving 
Minnesota Vikings (1-5), visiting the Green Bay Packers (2-4). 
</P>
<P>
The NFL's last two undefeated teams both play at 1 p.m. The New York Giants 
(6-0) play host to the Washington Redskins (4-2) at 1 p.m. on Channels 2 and 8. 
The Giants defeated the Redskins 24-20 on Oct. 14. The San Francisco 49ers 
(6-0) seek to extend their winning streak to 15 when they face the Cleveland 
Browns (2-5) at 1 p.m. on Channels 4 and 36. 
</P>
<P>
One of their most intense coaching feuds of recent years gets another renewal 
when Sam Wyche's Cincinnati Bengals (5-2) meet Jerry Glanville's Atlanta 
Falcons (2-4) at 5 p.m. on TNT. This is the first regular season game between 
the two since Cincinnati's 61-7 victory over Houston last December when 
Glanville was still coaching the Oilers. STEVEN HERBERT

WRONG ABOUT KIDS

<P>
I'm sorry to say so but the article you wrote on the New Kids concert was very 
bad. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the fans enjoyed the concert. Also maybe we enjoy wasting our money on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Another thing I'd like to see is you get up on stage and try to sing after 
dancing and trying to catch your breath. Just because you don't like their 
music doesn't mean you can put them down. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people think the New Kids are great, so if you don't have anything 
nice to say about them, why don't you just shut up?

4 ARRESTED IN KIDNAP, GANG-RAPE OF WOMAN; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: SAN FRANCISCO WOMAN WAS ABDUCTED AS SHE WALKED TO BUY FORMULA FOR HER 
BABY, AUTHORITIES SAY. ONE SUSPECT IS A SCHOOL SECURITY GUARD. 
</P>

<P>
A Long Beach school security officer and three other men were arrested Friday 
in the kidnaping and gang-rape of a San Francisco woman who was abducted as she 
walked to buy formula for her baby, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old woman, visiting the Los Angeles area with her husband and 
child, was intercepted on her way to a store early Friday morning, forced into 
a car and driven several blocks to where she was raped, Sheriff's Sgt. Bob 
Olmsted said. 
</P>
<P>
After an hourlong ordeal, she was rescued by two sheriff's deputies who 
happened onto the scene, Olmsted said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies assigned to patrol the Metro Rail Blue Line spotted the car -- its 
license plate covered with tape and plastic bags -- and approached two men 
standing alongside it. As the two men started to walk away, deputies saw a gun 
tucked into one man's waistband. 
</P>
<P>
The two men were detained and when the deputies reached the car, they found 
another man holding a semiautomatic pistol to the woman's head in the back 
seat. A fourth man was sitting in the front seat, Olmsted said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect in the back seat was identified as Victor Lopez Jr., 27, a security 
officer for the Long Beach school system and a reserve-duty Los Angeles County 
Parks and Recreation safety officer. The three other men were identified as 
gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Olmsted said the woman was apparently abducted near the intersection of Martin 
Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway about 1 a.m. The men drove 
her to the 1300 block of Lime Avenue, a row of commercial buildings and 
residences near Polytechnic High School, where Lopez was waiting. 
</P>
<P>
The car and both guns were registered to Lopez, authorities said. One of the 
guns -- a 9-millimeter Beretta -- was Lopez's county-issued weapon. 
</P>
<P>
All four men were booked at the Carson sheriff's station on suspicion of rape, 
conspiracy to commit rape, sodomy, forced oral copulation and assault with a 
deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez's boss said he was shocked at the allegations and described Lopez as a 
reliable employee who never caused trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been a dependable officer," said Joe Romero, chief of security for the 
Long Beach school system. "He's real quiet and just goes about and does his 
job." 
</P>
<P>
He said Lopez had worked for Long Beach for 2 1/2 years. Lopez is single and 
lives with his mother in Burbank, Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
As a school security officer, Lopez's duties included responding to fire or 
burglary alarms at any of Long Beach's schools. He was not on duty at the time 
of the alleged kidnaping and rape. 
</P>
<P>
The other suspects arrested with Lopez were identified by authorities as Oniva 
David Tautolo, 21; Owen Fuimaono Jr., 22, and Lau Talo Jr., 22, all of Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez was being held in lieu of $50,000 bail, while bail was set at $30,000 for 
the others. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, whose name was not released, was treated at a local hospital. She, 
her husband and their child had been staying at a Long Beach motel for several 
weeks while visiting relatives in Los Angeles.

BLUE LINE BEEFS UP SAFETY MEASURES AS OFFICIALS TRY TO AVERT COLLISIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BRAUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County transportation officials, seeking to stem a rash of fatal 
collisions between Blue Line trolleys and automobiles, announced Friday that 
new lights would be added to the trolleys as part of a series of safety 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
The new train lights, called "cyclops lights," will be installed at the top of 
trolley engines so that they will be visible above picket fences along the 
line, said Neil Peterson, executive director of the county's Transportation 
Commission, which oversees the safety and security of the 22-mile commuter 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson and other county officials said there also will be new public service 
announcements, toughened security at rail crossings -- to prevent cars and 
pedestrians from ignoring lowered rail guards -- and requests to railroad 
freight companies to alter their train schedules. 
</P>
<P>
At least 17 accidents -- and three fatalities -- have occurred since the Los 
Angeles-to-Long Beach line began running last August. Transit officials and 
trolley engineers have complained that the high-speed trolleys are obstructed 
each day by cars accelerating through closed intersections, pedestrians and 
bicyclists illegally crossing the tracks and vehicles parked in front of 
oncoming trains. 
</P>
<P>
The new lights will cost $100,000 and will be installed "as soon as possible," 
said Norman Jester, the commission's vice president of operations. 
</P>
<P>
While announcing the new safety measures, transit officials defended the rail 
system's existing safeguards. 
</P>
<P>
"Every possible action that we could have taken has been taken," Peterson said. 
"The (state) Public Utilities Commission sets strict safety standards and we 
have exceeded those standards." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said that the new safety measures were "short term," and might be 
expanded when a safety evaluation is completed by Nov. 12. He said that the 
county also hopes to build a network of volunteer crossing guards to monitor 
dangerous Blue Line intersections on Halloween night. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue isn't whether our safety devices are adequate," Peterson said. "It's 
educating the public and making them aware that these trains run up to 50 
m.p.h. and can be very dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
But earlier Friday, an attorney for the family of a woman who was killed by a 
Blue Line train on Sept. 19 leveled new criticism at rail officials in the form 
of a lawsuit. The suit seeks $22 million in damages from the county and state. 
</P>
<P>
Donald H. Cohen, a lawyer for the 11 children of Rosa Cebellos, a Watts woman 
who was struck and killed by a trolley as she crossed tracks near her home, 
claimed that the rail line provided only "inadequate notice, inadequate 
warning, malfunctioning lights and gates and dangerous conditions." Cohen said 
that "no danger or pedestrian signs are located at the crossing" where Cebellos 
was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Transit officials have said that some motorists try to slip through closed rail 
crossings on the assumption that they are maneuvering past slow freight trains. 
Instead, they risk collisions with the trolleys. 
</P>
<P>
That was the case Wednesday night, investigators said, when Graciela Marinero, 
26, of Los Angeles, and Willie Torres, her 4-year-old son, were killed when 
their car was struck at a crossing near 41st Street and Long Beach Avenue. Only 
12 hours later, four Cambodian immigrants were hurt when their car collided 
with a trolley on Burnett Street. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Line engineers have complained repeatedly about illegal crossings, 
claiming that they have witnessed as many as six on a single Los 
Angeles-to-Long Beach run. On one Thursday afternoon trolley round trip, there 
were eight illegal crossings or violations, ranging from pedestrians hurrying 
across a closed intersection to two vehicles parked on the tracks.

LAPD DECLINED TO PROBE CHARGES AGAINST DIPLOMAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department twice declined requests by prosecutors last 
month to conduct a follow-up investigation into the alleged sexual assault of a 
hotel maid by a foreign dignitary, the city attorney's office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had asked police to gather photographs and other evidence in the 
case against Guinean Ambassador Moussa Sangare, but detectives and a police 
captain declined because Sangare is protected by diplomatic immunity, spokesman 
Mike Qualls said. 
</P>
<P>
Qualls said it was "not unprecedented, but somewhat unusual" for a police 
administrator not to pursue a criminal investigation at the request of 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials defended their work on the case. They said that department 
policy prevented them from continuing to pursue the matter because they had not 
yet received approval from the State Department to do so. As a result, Sangare 
was permitted to stay in his hotel room at the Biltmore for five nights after 
the alleged attack without being interviewed or photographed by investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, however, said that they had been instructed by State Department 
officials to handle the case like any other and pressed ahead with a probe of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
As an ambassador, Sangare enjoys full diplomatic immunity, although Guinea can 
waive the protection and allow prosecutors to bring their case to trial. If the 
country does not waive immunity, the State Department can insist that he leave 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Sangare, 50, the highest-ranking Guinean diplomat in the United States, was 
charged on Thursday with misdemeanor sexual battery and false imprisonment for 
allegedly attacking a maid on Sept. 4 while she turned down his bed for the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Sangare denied the accusation, saying the woman "imagined the whole thing." He 
faces a maximum of 18 months in jail and a $3,000 fine if convicted on the two 
charges. Sangare is scheduled to be arraigned on Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
According to one law enforcement official assigned to the case, police 
investigators were told by William Elkins, a top aide to Mayor Tom Bradley, not 
to interview Sangare after the incident because of his diplomatic immunity. 
</P>
<P>
Although other police officials said Elkins had discussions with officers 
involved in the case, they denied he attempted to influence the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Said Police Cmdr. William Booth: "Elkins issued no directions or instructions 
-- and cannot -- to this department." 
</P>
<P>
Sangare and a visiting delegation of other West African ambassadors had 
breakfast at the Biltmore with Bradley on the day of the alleged attack. 
Elkins, who escorted the delegation in Los Angeles, declined to be interviewed 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The police contacted the mayor's office during their investigation to ask a 
few questions about the delegation," said Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler. 
"Those questions were answered. There was no further involvement by this 
office." 
</P>
<P>
He declined to discuss Elkins' role in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's office came under criticism last spring when a concessionaire and 
airport police decided to drop a felony theft complaint against a Japanese 
dignitary after conferring with another top aide to Bradley. After the incident 
was made public, the city attorney's office pressed charges against the 
Japanese official, but the case was dismissed by a judge. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence that led to the filing of charges against Sangare was gathered by 
the city attorney's office. The hotel maid told police on the night of the 
attack that Sangare approached her from behind and "with each hand he grabbed 
my breasts." She said she ran out of the room after Sangare attacked her a 
second time. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, police filed a report saying that the maid was no longer 
interested in prosecuting the case. It was not until she was revisited by 
investigators from the city attorney's office that she agreed to testify 
against Sangare, said Deputy City Atty. Dennis Jensen, who is prosecuting the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Gloria Allred demanded on Friday that Police Chief Daryl F. Gates 
launch an investigation into the reasons why his detectives failed to pursue 
their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Often, the victims of sexual battery do not go to police at all," Allred said 
when contacted by The Times. "It is demoralizing to other victims to hear that 
when someone finally has the courage to report, she is not encouraged by the 
system." 
</P>

KCET REVERSES ITS RULING AGAINST S. AFRICA SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON BERNSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under increasing pressure from community groups, members of its own staff and a 
major public-television station in New York, KCET Channel 28 reversed itself 
Friday and said that it will continue to broadcast the news magazine "South 
Africa Now." 
</P>
<P>
Station manager Stephen Kulczycki, backed by president William Kobin, said in a 
statement that he had screened an upcoming segment of the program and was 
"delighted" to determine that he no longer found it biased or unbalanced. 
</P>
<P>
When he had announced a week earlier that KCET was dropping the series, which 
is carried on 80 stations nationwide, Kulczycki had charged that it was slanted 
in favor of the African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have concerns, but based on what we have seen today, it appears that 
the producers are making a good-faith effort to address our needs," Kulczycki 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Emily Kasriel, a producer on the show, denied that any changes had been made to 
suit KCET but said: "We're tremendously pleased with this decision, and we 
think it represents a tremendous victory for objective news reporting about the 
issues in Southern Africa." 
</P>
<P>
David Horowitz, whose conservative media watchdog group, the Committee on Media 
Integrity, had claimed responsibility for raising the issue of the show's 
alleged bias with Kulczycki, called the reversal "political and moral 
cowardice." 
</P>
<P>
"Whereas the previous decision was made not under pressure, as a matter of 
judgment of the show's indefensible nature, this one was steamrollered by a 
political juggernaut from the left," Horowitz said in a telephone interview 
from Cape Town, South Africa, where he is researching a magazine article. 
</P>
<P>
But community activists and the program's producers saw the decision to 
reinstate "South Africa Now" as a victory for the grass-roots efforts of those 
who had protested the near loss of the program in the nation's second most 
populous metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it really shows that any time the community begins to mobilize in its 
own defense, there are no obstacles we can't overcome," said Michael Zinzun, 
who had organized protests over KCET's decision. 
</P>
<P>
People ranging from City Councilman Robert Farrell to anti-apartheid activists 
to USC professors who use "South Africa Now" in the classroom had pleaded with 
KCET officials to keep the program on the air. One group appeared before the 
station's Community Advisory Board on Wednesday and persuaded that body to 
issue a statement reprimanding station executives for pulling the show. 
</P>
<P>
Kulczycki said that KCET had agreed to pick up at least another six weeks of 
the program. Whether it then takes the other seven installments that the 
producers are planning to make this season depends on their continuing to be 
"unbiased," he said. 
</P>
<P>
KCET said that it would run "South Africa Now" only because the show's 
producers, Danny Schechter and Rory O'Connor, had promised that it would not be 
biased, and had visibly changed their approach for the last program of the 
current 13-week series run, due to be broadcast here Sunday at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the station said, it had received assurances from officials at 
station WNET in New York, which assists in the production of the show and is 
its sponsor in the public-television system, that they would monitor "South 
Africa Now" for fairness. 
</P>
<P>
Schechter and O'Connor, who had denied the accusations of bias, could not be 
reached for comment, but Kasriel disputed Kulczycki's contention that the 
program had been altered. "The show has not been changed," she said, adding 
that the standards used in the program Kulczycki screened Friday had been 
applied throughout the show's previous five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"If people think bias is covering things other people don't cover, that's a 
strange idea of bias," Kasriel said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TIP ON EXPLOSIVES CACHE FORCES EVACUATION 
OF 200 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 200 Norwalk residents were evacuated from their homes Friday morning 
while authorities searched a house for explosives in the investigation of the 
Oct. 9 armed robbery of a PACE store in Downey, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Downey detectives, acting on a tip, wanted to search the house in the 12700 
block of Kalnor Avenue for evidence related to the robbery, Downey Police Lt. 
Bill Lund said. 
</P>
<P>
They called in sheriff's bomb experts because the tipster said explosives may 
have been stored at the house, but no explosives were found. 
</P>
<P>
Residents within a 150-yard radius were evacuated for more than an hour as a 
precautionary measure. 
</P>
<P>
Downey detectives removed some undisclosed possessions from the house for 
further investigation, police Capt. Lt. Dennis Chelstrom said. No one has been 
charged in the robbery, which left two policemen wounded.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WITNESSES GIVE DETAILS OF DEPUTIES' 
SPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An array of bank officers, real estate agents, car salesmen and other business 
representatives took the stand Friday in a federal money-skimming trial as 
prosecutors sought to show the spending habits of seven Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The narcotics officers, accused of skimming $1.4 million during drug raids, 
allegedly spent much of that money on vacation homes, automobiles, jewelry, 
landscaping and other luxuries, according to prosecutors, who also subpoenaed 
numerous bank records and invoices. 
</P>
<P>
But in questioning witnesses, defense attorneys contended that although 
deputies made tens of thousands of dollars in purchases -- much of it in cash 
-- they did nothing illegal and made no effort to conceal those financial 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants, all veteran narcotics deputies, have pleaded not guilty to 
conspiracy, tax evasion and other federal charges. Their trial resumes Tuesday.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REDEVELOPMENT GETS MIXED REVIEWS IN 
HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The people of Hollywood have given the Community Redevelopment Agency decidedly 
mixed reviews over its handling of the massive redevelopment of the city's 
movie capital over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
During a state-mandated biennial field hearing at the Hollywood Roosevelt 
Thursday evening, redevelopment agency officials heard speeches and critiques 
from more than 75 residents, activists, city administrators and advisers about 
the agency's performance in engineering the planned restoration. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA's seven commissioners also approved a landmark social plan to earmark 
up to $92 million over the 30-year life of the plan to deal with the most 
pressing needs in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
But, as expected, the more than 300 people who showed up at the sometimes 
raucous meeting were there to speak their minds about the redevelopment plan, 
perhaps the most beleaguered renewal project in the agency's history. 
</P>
<P>
Several scuffles erupted when recalcitrant speakers refused to yield the 
microphone and were led from the podium by police, with one confrontation 
spilling out into the posh hotel lobby. Protest signs such as "CRA: 
Blood-sucking leaches" (sic) were prominently displayed, but attendees were 
mostly well-behaved, in contrast to the noisy, jeering crowd that shouted down 
CRA supporters at the first biennial meeting in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Some at Thursday's meeting sharply criticized the CRA for failing to respond to 
residents' concerns about the crime, violence and general urban decay that has 
plagued the 1,100-acre section of Hollywood that makes up the redevelopment 
district. 
</P>
<P>
But others said redevelopment is needed to restore Hollywood to its former 
glory, and that the CRA is doing its best to engineer the renewal in the face 
of contentious protest groups who have filed lawsuits to block it. JOSH MEYER

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DIDN'T NEGLECT TENANTS, OWNERS OF HOUSE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owners of a house involved in a fatal fire in South-Central Los Angeles 
said Friday that their elderly and poor tenants were not neglected -- despite 
neighbor's comments that some of the house's occupants appeared skinny and 
infirm. The owners, Leonard and Grace Fagan, both 77, live next door to the 
fire-ravaged house. 
</P>
<P>
They said the home was merely a "guest house" for people they knew who needed a 
place to stay. Rent was about $50 a month for a room, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities concluded that the fire on South Laurel Street near Watts was 
accidentally caused by a smoldering cigarette on a mattress. One tenant, 
Charles Smith, 67, died and four others were hospitalized, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department of Social Services requires a board-and-care license for 
commercial residential facilities providing non-medical care and supervision 
for the elderly. The Fagans said they did not have a license and did not need 
one. "We didn't have no rest home," Grace Fagan said.

SMITH RALLIES CRESPI PAST ALEMANY, 21-10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crespi High, which confined its scoring to the middle quarters Friday night, 
rallied to post 21 consecutive points and defeat Alemany, 21-10, in a Mission 
League football game at Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany took a 10-0 lead on its first two possessions, but the Indian defense 
could not contain Crespi quarterback Cody Smith, who threw two third-quarter 
touchdown passes and completed 15 of 22 passes for 194 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was quick to call the win a team effort, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I had all day to throw the ball; the line did a great job," he said. "And 
(Ryan) Kieling and (Frank) Romano were coming back for the ball all night." 
</P>
<P>
Kieling's 32-yard touchdown catch gave Crespi a 14-10 lead less than a minute 
into the second half. Kieling caught six passes for 99 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Romano's seven-yard touchdown grab on Crespi's next possession gave the Celts a 
comfortable 21-10 lead with 4 minutes 27 seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Romano finished with five catches for 73 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany wasted little time in getting on the scoreboard to start the game. 
Crespi's Dereck Williams fumbled while running back the opening kickoff and 
Vince Zacone fell on the loose ball at the Crespi 37. 
</P>
<P>
It took the Indians just two plays to get into the end zone. Quarterback Adam 
Romandi threw a 24-yard pass to Richard Dice, who was wide open in the left 
flat. 
</P>
<P>
From there, running back Terry Barnum took the ball into the end zone on a 
13-yard dash to give Alemany a 7-0 lead 69 seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians scored again on their next possession after their defense forced 
Crespi to punt after three plays. Travis Russell's 38-yard field goal made it 
10-0. 
</P>
<P>
Dice, a 6-foot-3, 200-pound tight end, caught 10 passes for 116 yards. Romandi 
completed 17 of 35 for 208 yards and one interception. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi (7-1, 4-0 in league play) cut Alemany's lead to 10-7 when Torie Lee 
scored on a one-yard run on the first play of the second quarter. Lee finished 
with 63 yards in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Barnum rushed for a game-high 72 yards in 16 carries for Alemany (4-3, 3-2).

WASHINGTON LEADS WAY AS GRANADA HILLS PREVAILS, 54-34 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Granada Hills High co-Coach Tom Harp looked at the scoreboard, then at his 
watch. 
</P>
<P>
Then the most incredulous look crossed his face. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like it was never gonna end," Harp said. "Every time we thought we 
put it out of reach, boom, they were right back in it." 
</P>
<P>
For Granada Hills and San Fernando, it was boom, boom, out go the lights as the 
Highlanders rolled to a 54-34 victory in a Northwest Valley Conference 
shoot-out at San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
The teams combined for 752 yards, but Granada Hills fullback Brett Washington 
was the difference, rushing for 198 yards in 23 carries and scoring four 
touchdowns. Washington also recovered two fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it was barely enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to straighten out the D," said Washington, who also starts at 
linebacker. "We got some work to do." 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 33-18, with 11 minutes 31 seconds remaining, the Tigers seemingly 
climbed back into the game when halfback Leonice Brown broke loose for a 
63-yard scoring run. The play was nullified by an illegal-block penalty, 
however, and the Tiger drive stalled. 
</P>
<P>
After Granada Hills regained possession at the Tiger 42-yard line, Washington 
scored on the first play to give the Highlanders a 40-18 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers hardly rolled over, however. Three plays into San Fernando's next 
possession, tight end Dwight McDuff caught a pass from quarterback Cruz Trevino 
in the flat, turned and tossed a 59-yard scoring pass to LaKarlos Townsend. 
Trevino hit McDuff on the conversion to bring the Tigers within 40-26 with 7:35 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Washington scored from seven yards for a 47-26 lead, but if the double-pass 
works once. . . . After receiving a toss from Trevino, McDuff connected with 
Brown on an 81-yard touchdown to pull San Fernando within 47-34 with 3:57 left. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills tailback Derrick Stewart (49 yards, two touchdowns) scored from 
eight yards with 31 seconds left to complete the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 19-0, San Fernando scored 10 points in 31 seconds to scratch its way 
back into the game before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers drove 69 yards in 14 plays to the Highlander six, whereupon Jose 
Servin nailed a 24-yard field goal to make it 19-3 with 2:30 left in the half. 
Those were the first points the Highlander defense had allowed in 15-plus 
quarters -- and they earned the defense an earful from the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
On Granada Hills' first play from scrimmage on its ensuing possession, Martin 
was hammered as he threw over the middle and the ball was intercepted by 
linebacker Luis Perez, who returned it 14 yards to the Granada Hills 10. 
</P>
<P>
On San Fernando's first play, Townsend took a pitch and scrambled around left 
end for a touchdown, bringing San Fernando within 19-10 with 1:59 left in the 
half. It was only the second touchdown allowed by the Granada Hills defense in 
4 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
For the first few minutes, the game seemed destined to be a rout. Granada Hills 
won the coin toss and elected to kick off, and San Fernando went three plays 
and out. Waaaay out. 
</P>
<P>
On fourth and six from the 24, Curt Hulshizer broke through the middle and 
blocked Servin's punt. Stewart recovered in the end zone for a 7-0 lead with 
10:39 left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills stopped the Tigers on their next possession, and on the fifth 
play of the Highlanders' first offensive possession, Washington rumbled 51 
yards on a pitch play for a 13-0 lead with 7:08 left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
After he recovered a Tiger fumble at the San Fernando 34, Washington gave the 
Highlanders a 19-0 lead with a one-yard run with 8:56 left in the half. During 
the drive, Martin was hit in the lower back and removed from the game. 
</P>
<P>
To the surprise of no one (except perhaps the San Fernando defense), backup 
quarterback Edgar Vasquez handed off to Washington on first down at the Tiger 
32 and the 220-pound senior cruised 27 yards to the five. Washington scored 
three plays later. 
</P>
<P>
Martin returned after missing one play.

AGOURA GIRLS CHARGE TO COUNTY TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Agoura High took its well-worn path to the girls' title in the Ventura County 
cross-country championships Friday, but Channel Islands broke from a pack of 
talented teams to claim the boys' title at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
Deena Drossin of Agoura won her fourth consecutive title in leading the 
Chargers to their fourth team championship in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Drossin toured the three-mile route in 17 minutes 24 seconds, eclipsing the 
course record of 17:26 set by Newbury Park's Melissa Sutton in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't go into the race with the record in mind like I did at Mt. 
SAC," said Drossin, referring to her record-tying effort last Saturday at the 
Mt. San Antonio College invitational. "I knew it was going to be a fast pace 
and that the record would be right in there." 
</P>
<P>
Drossin is undefeated this fall with eight wins in invitational and dual-meet 
races. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake's Jeannie Rothman and Channel Islands' Veronica Barajas offered 
competition until Drossin started pulling away just before the one-mile mark. 
</P>
<P>
Rothman, who finished second to Drossin for the fourth time this season, 
clocked a personal-best 17:36. Barajas was third in 18:02. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura tallied 43 points, handily beating runner-up Buena (93) and third-place 
finisher Nordhoff (99). 
</P>
<P>
Agoura is undefeated heading into next week's Marmonte League finals at 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
While Agoura, the second-ranked girls' team in the nation, had seemed almost 
assured of another county title, the boys' championship was wide open. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first year I can think of that three or four teams have a chance 
to win it," Camarillo Coach Mike Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands, fourth in the Division I rankings, totaled 84 points to claim 
its first county title and keep alive the Marmonte League's string of boys' 
team championships dating to the meet's inception in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura (94) and Camarillo (121), ranked first and second in Division II, 
finished second and third. Fillmore, Division IV's second-ranked team, placed 
fourth with 143 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders won even though two runners competed despite injuries. Stewart 
Ellington (knee injury) finished eighth in 16:02 and James Darpino (broken 
hand) was 19th in 16:32. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Fernando Mendoza timed 15:50 in placing fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"This and our (double) dual meet with Camarillo and Agoura (which the Raiders 
won by one point) have been just crazy," Channel Islands Coach Tom Kiddie said 
of the close scores. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo, which lost its top four runners from last year's state Division I 
championship team, had won the past three county titles. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Wilson of Newbury Park outlasted Agoura's Ryan Wilson and Fillmore's Jorge 
Barajas to win boys' individual honors in 15:25. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Wilson, a sophomore, clocked 15:36 to finish second and Barajas was third 
in 15:43. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm stoked. I've never done anything like this before," Jeff Wilson said.

INSIDE LINEBACKER TAYLOR PLAYS KEY ROLE FOR CSUN DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Terrell Taylor, Cal State Northridge's man in the middle, might as well be 
wearing a bull's-eye on his chest. 
</P>
<P>
Every play he seemingly is the target for a hostile fullback or lineman. Their 
goal: to turn Mr. Taylor, No. 13 in your program, No. 1 on the Matador tackle 
chart, into a 6-foot-2, 220-pound divot. 
</P>
<P>
The faint of heart need not apply at inside linebacker. It can be a daunting 
position even when behemoth blockers miss on their charge. 
</P>
<P>
"Say you're running and you don't see them, but for some reason they just miss 
you," Taylor said. "The wind you feel when they go by is enormous. It's power. 
It's like, 'Somebody was just trying to kill me a second ago.' " 
</P>
<P>
Even minor jolts can hurt when delivered by men with 22-inch biceps. 
</P>
<P>
"Little elbow points that hit you when they skate by? It's pain," Taylor said. 
"You just say, 'My goodness, these guys are serious.' " 
</P>
<P>
None, however, are any more so than Taylor, Northridge's resident film star. 
</P>
<P>
If one thinks that Chuck Norris elicits grunts and groans on the big screen, 
one should hear the reaction in CSUN's film room when Taylor leaves the imprint 
of his face mask in the chest of a running back. Talk about making a lasting 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Burt, Northridge's coach, recalls one hit worthy of a rerun. "It was like 
the next-to-last play against Portland State. They threw to No. 24 and Terrell 
just took him out of there," Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Don Finkbonner wears No. 24 for Portland and he gained five 
yards -- about the same distance he traveled airborne after Taylor smacked him 
as he tried to make his way down the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, a senior, leads Northridge with 47 tackles and he also has left his 
mark in several other categories. He has three tackles for losses, one sack, a 
fumble recovery, two interceptions and four pass deflections. 
</P>
<P>
He is even busy between plays, calling signals for CSUN's very un-Matador-like 
defense, which is rated among the nation's best. 
</P>
<P>
"Terrell is the leader of the defense," Burt said. Taylor relishes the role. 
"I've wanted to be the signal-caller ever since I can remember," Taylor said. 
"When I'm talking in the huddle, everyone else has to shut up. I get to take 
over. It makes me feel like the boss and that makes me play harder because you 
know everybody is watching you." 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Taylor was the one doing most of the watching. At the start of the 
season, he was temporarily ineligible while waiting for a makeup grade to be 
recorded. After being ineligible for the first game, he played mostly on 
special teams before gradually earning more playing time as backup to inside 
linebacker Rod Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
It was a frustrating time. "I felt like I was just as good as the rest of the 
guys, but my being late. . . . Once you play a game with people, everybody gets 
into a little groove and they get comfortable playing with whoever is next to 
them," Taylor said. "That hurt, plus I didn't know the pass defense. And in 
this conference, you cannot play without knowing the pass defense." 
</P>
<P>
In hindsight, Burt concedes that Northridge probably started the wrong 
linebacker much of last season. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an example for a lot of guys who may not play as much as they think they 
should as juniors," Burt says. "When they get their chance, they need to make 
the most of it. This season was his chance." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor established himself early this time, putting a hold on a starting 
position during spring practice. But the same work ethic that placed him in 
that position almost kept him from staying in it. 
</P>
<P>
Back home in Atlanta for the summer, Taylor was weight-training twice a day. 
Then he tried to do a little too much in a squat lift and pulled a back muscle. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to impress some of the girls," Taylor said. "These bodybuilders 
were there and they were acting like the weight was so heavy and I was like, 
'Oh, I can play with that.' I went out there and played with it, but I also 
hurt myself." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was unable to do much training during the last month of the summer, but 
he kept his starting job anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 7, Taylor once again is back in familiar terrority -- this time 
showing off his team. Northridge, 6-1 and ranked ninth in Division II, will 
meet Santa Clara (5-3) in a Western Football Conference game at Buck Shaw 
Stadium, only a short distance from where Taylor played junior college football 
at San Jose City College. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor is among 12 players on Northridge's traveling squad returning to 
Northern California where they played in junior colleges before signing with 
the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to have a harder time getting a kid out of Pierce or Valley than we do 
out of Contra Costa or San Jose," Burt said. "It's the old 'familiarity breeds 
contempt' thing." 
</P>
<P>
Burt credits several Bay Area products from past seasons for spreading a good 
word. "Guys who are happy with their situation go back and tell other guys," 
Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was helped along the way to CSUN by Clayton Bamberg, a former San Jose 
teammate who starts at strong safety. Taylor had his heart set on playing at 
the Division I level, but when Northridge's scholarship offer was the only one 
offered on signing day, he took it. 
</P>
<P>
Now he finds he has come full circle. 
</P>
<P>
"I've talked to guys at JCs and they're like, 'Northridge, huh? A Division II 
school. . . .' They look down on you, but they just don't know. This is serious 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
Take it from the man in the middle.

scoring pass to Vinnie Orlando, leading the Knights (5-2-1, 3-0-1) at St. 
Bernard (2-6, 1-4). 
</P>
<P>
It was Malieitulua's first game since spraining his right knee two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Malieitulua scored the Knights' first touchdown on a 23-yard run late in the 
first quarter. In the second quarter, he scored from seven yards after his 
64-yard run five plays earlier put the Knights in position for the score. ADAM

Saugus scored on its first possession when quarterback Jason Bobby capped an

when Freddie Edwards dashed 55 yards for a touchdown and then ran in the 
two-point conversion. 
</P>

The Centurions regained the lead for good in the third quarter as David Doyle

Channel Islands 13, Agoura 10 -- An inspired Channel Islands defense stopped 
Agoura running back Kurt Klotz on the one-foot line with one minute to play, 
preserving a victory at Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
With five minutes to play, Agoura drove from its 31 to the Channel Islands' 
five and seemed ready to seize the lead. 
</P>
<P>
But three consecutive running plays only moved the ball to the one, setting up 
the final attempt.

Lamont Pearson dashed 79 yards for the Raiders' go-ahead touchdown late in the 
third quarter. Pearson finished with 106 yards in 11 carries.

Agoura (5-3, 2-3) took a 10-7 lead with 3:51 to play in the first half on a

In another Northwest Valley Conference game: 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth 24, Cleveland 20 -- Chatsworth chalked up its first league victory 
behind the running of tailback Rayna Stewart, who rushed for a game-high 126 
yards in 18 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Brandon Ruedy completed five of 13 passes for 59 yards and two 
touchdowns for Chatsworth (2-4, 1-3). 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland quarterback David Erhardt returned after missing two games because of 
a separated shoulder. He completed 14 of 24 for 179 yards and one touchdown, 
and also scored on a one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Erhardt couldn't overcome the Cavaliers' mistakes, however. Cleveland was 
penalized 14 times for 163 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland (0-5-1, 0-4) trailed, 14-0, in the first quarter when Erhardt entered 
the game. The Cavaliers were forced to punt on that possession, but they scored 
on the ensuing one, capped by Erhardt's one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Ibn Bilal gained 83 yards in 12 carries for Cleveland, and caught two passes 
for 20 yards and a touchdown -- a 21-yarder with 2:21 left. STEVE WILLIAMS

<P>
Sean Boldt's controversial 29-yard touchdown reception with 5 minutes 52 
seconds left capped El Camino Real High's 14-7 comeback victory over Reseda in 
a Northwest Valley Conference game Friday night at Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
With El Camino Real facing fourth and 21 at the 29, quarterback Evan Howland 
threw to Boldt, who broke from two Regent defenders and made the reception as 
he rolled over in the corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very fortunate to win tonight," El Camino Real Coach Mike Maio said. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda Coach Joel Schaeffer saw the game's deciding play differently. 
</P>
<P>
"The man pushed off. It was obvious offensive pass interference," Schaeffer 
said. "My two kids both said (Boldt) trapped the ball. The referee said 
otherwise. It's a tough way to lose a ball game." 
</P>
<P>
Reseda (3-3, 1-3 in league play) opened the scoring after Maurice Stepter 
intercepted a Howland pass in the first quarter. A seven-play, 18-yard drive 
aided by a 15-yard roughing the kicker penalty on a field-goal attempt was 
capped by Stepter's four-yard scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real tied the score after junior defensive tackle Herbert Cosey 
recovered a Reseda fumble at the Regent 19. Three plays later, Chris Griggs ran 
for a 10-yard touchdown to tie the score at 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real (5-1, 3-1) limited Reseda to 23 yards. Griggs led El Camino Real 
with 83 yards in 17 carries and backfield mate Ryan Marine carried 24 times for 
83 yards. GARY HYNES

SYLMAR SHOWS ITS DOMINANCE IN SHOWDOWN, 48-0

<P>
This might have been a matchup of the Valley Pac-8 Conference's two best teams, 
but Birmingham High did not have a leg to stand on against Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
And the specific leg the Braves were lacking belonged to quarterback Vince 
Lampkin, sidelined because of an injured left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Deprived of Lampkin's running and passing talents, Birmingham found itself 
playing defense for most of the game and lost at home, 48-0. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar (6-0, 4-0 in league play) scored in the air and on the ground, with 
trick plays and straightforward football. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Daniel Terry ran for two touchdowns and threw for another. Running 
back Tobaise Brookins carried 22 times for 172 yards and two scores. 
</P>
<P>
"Now people will know how good we really are," Terry said. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham (4-2, 3-1), meanwhile, might not want many people to know about this 
game. The Braves were held to 84 yards as replacement quarterback Noah 
Kirshbaum completed only seven of 18 passes for 37 yards and threw an 
interception. Birmingham's star running back, Darrell Moore, was held to 30 
yards in eight carries. 
</P>
<P>
The scoring began quickly. On Sylmar's fourth play, Terry threw a lateral to 
wide receiver Brian Roberson who, in turn, lofted a pass to fellow receiver 
Da'ron Comier. The play covered 59 yards and gave the Spartans a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
And any questions about how Birmingham would respond to losing Lampkin were 
also soon answered. On the Braves' first possession, Kirshbaum -- who started 
several games at the beginning of the season -- threw an interception. 
</P>
<P>
Five plays later, Terry turned a broken play into a nine-yard touchdown run. 
The score was 14-0 after the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
As the Braves struggled to find an offensive rhythm, Sylmar continued to beat 
on them like a drum. Terry scored from one yard to cap a 46-yard drive midway 
through the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the half, Girmar Johnson returned a Birmingham punt 27 yards, 
and, on the next play, Terry threw a 30-yard touchdown pass to Comier, who made 
a juggling catch. The score was 28-0 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
The second half opened with a brief glimmer of hope, and a brief offensive 
drive, for Birmingham. But, near midfield, Kirshbaum fumbled a center's snap 
and Sylmar recovered. The Spartans stuck mostly to the ground after that. 
Brookins ran 23 yards for a touchdown at the beginning of the third quarter. He 
ran six yards for a touchdown at the end of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar's Rick Hagins closed the scoring with a three-yard touchdown run in the 
fourth quarter.

Wayne Gretzky couldn't bear to look. 
</P>
<P>
It was late in the first period Friday night of a game the Kings would 
eventually lose to the Winnipeg Jets, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, who had taken the ice with a career total of 1,999 points, had just 
received the puck from Marty McSorley. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in the right circle in his own zone, Gretzky spotted linemate Tony 
Granato free at mid-ice. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky whipped him the puck with the speed and crispness that had already 
earned him 1,315 assists and 684 goals in his 12-year NHL career. 
</P>
<P>
Granato never hesitated when he saw that Tomas Sandstrom was ahead of two 
defenders and skating furiously down the slot. 
</P>
<P>
The puck got to Sandstrom well ahead of the defensemen. 
</P>
<P>
Sandstrom was alone, racing toward the crease with only goalie Bob Essensa 
standing between him and Gretzky's unprecedented 2,000th point. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Gretzky dropped his eyes to the ice. He already had enough false 
alarms. He couldn't watch another. 
</P>
<P>
Granato stood at mid-ice praying. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking, please put it home, Tom," Granato said. "It would be nice to 
get it behind us. It would be nice not to have to feel bad anymore for the 
shots we missed that could have given it (2,000 points) to him." 
</P>
<P>
This one didn't miss, Sandstrom ramming the puck between Essensa's pads. 
</P>
<P>
"When I looked up," Gretzky said later, a grin on his face, "the puck was in 
the back of the net." 
</P>
<P>
And Gretzky was back in the record book with yet another seemingly unattainable 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he broke Gordie Howe's NHL record by scoring his 1,851st point. 
</P>
<P>
And now this. Two thousand career points. 
</P>
<P>
"My part was not a big thing," Sandstrom said. "He got 1,999 points without 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky can still remember his first, back in the 1979-80 season when he was an 
Edmonton Oiler. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a pass out of the corner to Kevin Lowe," he recalled. "He fired at the 
net and beat Tony Esposito. It was in Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Gretzky never dreamed that 1,999 more points would follow. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember thinking that night after the game that it would be nice just to 
stay and play in the NHL," Gretzky said. "I think all kids think about that." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky will long think about Friday night, but he doesn't rate it as his 
greatest moment on ice. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't compare anything to your first Stanley Cup," he said. "Individually, 
I would rate breaking Gordie Howe's record and this the highest." 
</P>
<P>
But he admitted breaking Howe's record was a bigger thrill than Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, it was more dramatic. Gretzky broke the record by scoring a 
game-tying goal against his former team, the Oilers, in Edmonton with 53 
seconds to play. He then won the game with an overtime goal. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a more important goal," he said. "And that was different. I was 
chasing somebody else. Now, I'm chasing myself." 
</P>
<P>
What's next, 3,000? 
</P>
<P>
"When I got my 1,000th point," he said, "I told people, 1,500 was reachable, 
but 2,000 was out of the question. Now, I say 2,500 is reachable, but 3,000 is 
out of the question." 
</P>
<P>
Not necessarily, considering Gretzky is 29. 
</P>
<P>
While Friday was a night for Gretzky and the Winnipeg Arena crowd of 15,566 to 
remember, it was a game the Kings would like to forget. 
</P>
<P>
They already trailed, 2-0, when Gretzky reached the 2,000 plateau 14:32 into 
the game, thanks to Winnipeg goals by Phil Housley and Fredrik Olausson, the 
third of the season for each. 
</P>
<P>
Before it was over, Pat Elynuik, Phil Sykes, Randy Carlyle and Paul Fenton 
would also score. 
</P>
<P>
This was the first of a six-game trip for the Kings, who have been on one of 
the hottest season-opening streaks in club history. 
</P>
<P>
But after Gretzky's moment, they faded faster than Buster Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, so was their five-game winning streak, their six-game 
unbeaten streak, their unbeaten record on the road, and their chance to equal 
the 8-1-1 start of the 1980-81 team, the best start in club history. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Kings fall to 7-2-1, their record on the road dropping to 1-1, but 
they remain on top of the Smythe Division by one point over the Calgary Flames. 
</P>
<P>
For the Jets, it was their third victory in a row, after losing six in a row, 
to improve to 4-6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Essensa was making his third start in goal after recuperating from a pulled 
groin muscle, suffered in the exhibition season. In all, he faced 27 shots, 
making several brilliant saves. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Hrudey had a much tougher night in the Kings' net, giving up six goals on 
26 shots. 
</P>
<P>
But the only number that most people will remember from this night is 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the game, a couple of us were sitting around in the clubhouse wondering 
if any of us had 2,000 points in our whole life, including youth hockey," 
Granato said. "I know I don't. And I don't think any of the others do either." 
</P>
<P>
And it may well be that no one will ever again score 2,000 in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The other Kings' goal was scored by Bob Kudelski, his seventh. . . . No 
Gretzky, No telecast: Originally, Prime Ticket had planned to televise Friday's 
game. Subsequently, it was scrubbed when the telecast schedule was revised. But 
when it became clear this would be the night that Wayne Gretzky would probably 
reach the 2,000 mark, the game was hastily put back on the schedule.

USC: SUN DEVIL QUARTERBACK PAUL JUSTIN IS EXPECTED TO MAKE RETURN FROM SHOULDER 
INJURY. MARINOVICH STAYS HOME.

<TEXT>
<P>
Quarterback Todd Marinovich, leader of the offense, is home in Los Angeles, 
serving out a suspension. Linebacker Scott Ross, leader of the defense, is 
wearing a cast in his broken right hand and is not expected to start. 
</P>
<P>
USC won't be at full strength today when it plays Arizona State at Sun Devil 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It's of little solace to the Sun Devils, who have had 10 starters out with 
injuries at one time or another this season and have not handled it well. 
</P>
<P>
Since opening the season with victories over Baylor and Colorado State, they 
have lost four consecutive games, the last three since senior quarterback Paul 
Justin dislocated his left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
The Sun Devils are 0-3 and last in the Pacific 10 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just trying to find a way to be respectable," Coach Larry Marmie said. 
</P>
<P>
The return of Justin, listed by one preseason magazine as the nation's No. 1 
quarterback, may help. Two other starters are also expected back. And with only 
four starters out, Arizona State is as close to being at full strength as it 
has been in several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But Justin, who completed 51.9% of his passes for 577 yards before he was 
injured last month in a 30-9 loss to Missouri, spent two nights in a hospital 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at first feared that he was suffering from appendicitis, but Justin's 
ailment later was diagnosed as a gastrointestinal problem. He lost 17 pounds in 
48 hours and at practice Monday, he became ill and almost had to leave. 
</P>
<P>
He regained his strength later in the week, but Marmie isn't counting on him to 
return to form in one game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to have him back, but he hasn't played in a month," Marmie said of 
Justin, who passed for 2,591 yards and 17 touchdowns as a junior. "It's not 
like he's going to step back in there and be as crisp and as sharp and all 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Justin will take control of an offense that ranks eighth in the Pac-10 and has 
scored one touchdown or less in three of Arizona State's last four games. 
</P>
<P>
The Sun Devils ran more than they passed in Justin's absence, to the delight of 
tailback Leonard Russell, a junior from Long Beach Poly High School and Mt. San 
Antonio College. Russell has averaged 70 yards a game. Two weeks ago, he ran 
for 186 yards and two touchdowns in a 31-24 loss to California. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, Arizona State ranks seventh in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
And the Sun Devils' standing won't necessarily improve after today, Marmie 
said, even though they will face a USC offense minus Marinovich, who ranks 
third in the Pac-10 in passing efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich was suspended by Coach Larry Smith this week for academic reasons, 
leaving seldom-used backup Shane Foley as the Trojans' starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Marmie didn't seem especially encouraged by the news. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel like they're going to run the football at us, anyway, regardless of 
who their quarterback is," he said. "That doesn't mean they're not going to 
throw it, but it looks like, in the past couple of weeks, the running game is 
what they've hung their hat on." 
</P>
<P>
It probably didn't go unnoticed by the Trojans that Washington ran for 329 
yards against the Sun Devils and Cal ran for 271. 
</P>
<P>
ASU tightened its defense last week, limiting Oregon to 289 total yards and one 
offensive touchdown in a 27-7 loss at Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Marmie said: "The challenge is to play like that week after week. I 
don't know if we can do that or not. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to find a way to come out from under it, and certainly with a 
team like USC staring at us, it's not going to be an easy task. It's not going 
to be easy for us against anybody." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach Larry Smith opened the competition at all but a few positions this 
week, and Friday he announced several changes in the starting lineup. Those who 
lost their starting positions were sophomore split end Larry Wallace and two 
seniors, linebacker Craig Hartsuyker and strong safety Marcus Hopkins. All 
three will be replaced by freshmen -- Johnnie Morton at split end, Willie 
McGinest at linebacker and Howard McCowan at strong safety. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans' starting lineup is expected to include six freshmen and three 
sophomores. Only seven seniors are expected to start, including Foley.

<P>
Phil Simms, 34, can look back on a Super Bowl championship and an assortment of 
other triumphs in his 12 years at quarterback for the undefeated New York 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent triumph, for instance, Simms, with three blockbuster passes, led 
the Giants past the Washington Redskins, the team that will be at Giants 
Stadium again Sunday, resuming a storied rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
Simms, though, scored his pivotal personal triumph long ago -- long before he 
turned pro. 
</P>
<P>
It happened during a television interview, of all things, in the winter of his 
senior year in high school. 
</P>
<P>
Talking about it the other day, the Giants' quarterback, a Kentucky tobacco 
farmer's son, recalled that with one game left, he not only had not won a 
college scholarship anywhere, he had not even been recruited by anybody. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving in Louisville for the state final as the quarterback of his high 
school team, Simms was interviewed on local television the night before his 
last game. 
</P>
<P>
And after the program, as he tells it now, he got a telephone call at his 
hotel. The caller was an assistant coach at nearby Morehead State, Vince 
Semary, who asked him where he was going to college. 
</P>
<P>
"I may not go to college," Simms said. "I haven't been recruited." 
</P>
<P>
Said Semary: "I'll be honest with you, we've never seen Phil Simms play 
football. But you showed so much poise in that interview that we'd like to have 
you here. How about it?" 
</P>
<P>
And that's how it happens that Simms owns a college letter jacket or two. The 
letter is M. 
</P>
<P>
"We played our hearts out that year in the state finals, but we lost," he said. 
"I never did get another college offer." 
</P>
<P>
But he has never lost his poise, either. 
</P>
<P>
It still identifies him both as a person and as an athlete, Giant center Bart 
Oates said after a recent game in which the veteran quarterback was blitzed by 
a linebacker and all but knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to the huddle on rubbery legs, Simms looked at his teammates through 
glazed-over eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we better call time out," Oates said. 
</P>
<P>
"Never," Simms said. "I wouldn't give that . . . linebacker the satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Simms called an audible on the next play, and threw for a first down. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, sir, he's everything you'd want in a quarterback," said the club's 
assistant general manager, Harry Hulmes. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants -- the players as well as management -- are dismayed that Simms is 
so often booed at Giants Stadium. For, beginning in the early '80s, they became 
a conspicuous winner only after having passed up Joe Montana and other 
All-Americans to draft Simms first in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the NFL's historic teams," Hulmes said. "But as everyone knows, 
we weren't a 1970s power." 
</P>
<P>
To the contrary, the club experienced eight consecutive awful seasons before 
the arrival of its big three: George Young, general manager; Lawrence Taylor, 
linebacker, and Simms. 
</P>
<P>
The most famous of these is Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"When you think of the 49ers, you think of Joe Montana," Simms said. "When you 
think of the Denver Broncos, you think of John Elway. When you think of the New 
York Giants, nobody thinks of the quarterback; you think of Lawrence Taylor." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the dozens of touchdown passes that Simms has thrown for the Giants in 
12 years, despite the 27,000 yards he has gained passing, despite the bunch of 
games he has won, he has lived in Taylor's shadow -- and it hasn't seemed to 
bother him at all. 
</P>
<P>
"Phil knows who he is," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
"Put it this way," Simms said. "Taylor couldn't have done it without me." 
</P>
<P>
That's poise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE NEW MAN 
</P>
<P>
Super Bowl XXI was memorably lopsided. To this day, many Giant fans remember 
the final score as Lawrence Taylor 39, John Elway 20. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Simms somehow completed 22 of 25 passes for an NFL record that could 
last into the next century. And so, afterward, he was hot stuff for a while in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
One day, a prosperous Manhattan firm offered him $5,000 to make a 15-minute 
appearance at an office party. 
</P>
<P>
"Sold," said Simms. "On one condition. Give me $4,000, and let me bring one of 
my teammates, (nose tackle) Jim Burt. Maybe Jim isn't as notorious as me, but 
he played as well as me, and you can give him the other $1,000." 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, bring him along," the company president said. "But you pay him -- 
anything you want." 
</P>
<P>
"No, that would be demeaning to Jim," Simms said. "You pay him, or it's no 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
And, said Simms' agent, David Fishof, who tells that story, "They did it that 
way -- because that's the way Phil is. 
</P>
<P>
"He always puts the team first, and I don't say that about all my clients. I've 
seen the time that Phil turned down a $10,000 appearance (fee) just because it 
interfered with his off-season workout program." 
</P>
<P>
Said Young: "Phil's secret weapon is the way he pushes himself in the weight 
room. There isn't a tougher quarterback, and that's because no quarterback 
works harder. We only have one other (player) who spends as much time (with the 
weights) as Phil does." 
</P>
<P>
One consequence of the workouts is that he has built himself into a new man. 
Once a gawky, 170-pound college quarterback, Simms, who stands 6 feet 3, is now 
a firm 220. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Valencia, who trains boxers and football players in New Jersey, said: 
"Phil is so tough and flexible today, he'd be a killer in karate." 
</P>
<P>
If Montana and Simms are the game's two most successful quarterbacks -- they 
have a showdown coming up Dec. 3 at San Francisco that could be a matchup of 
unbeaten teams -- they aren't much alike physically. 
</P>
<P>
Montana, 195, looks frail in or out of his clothes. He doesn't even appear to 
be 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Simms, who appears to be more than 6-3, is probably the NFL's best-built 
quarterback, although, seated across from him at a dinner table, you'd never 
guess he was even a professional athlete. 
</P>
<P>
Fair-haired, fair skinned, youthful for his many years in a stressful calling, 
he has the look of a kid singing in a choir in Oslo, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
Though his background is Irish-English, the features are Nordic. The manner is 
serious, the aptitude for football extensive. 
</P>
<P>
"(Simms) can throw every pass there is," Giant Coach Bill Parcells said. "A 
good quarterback is a guy who (is so consistent that) the defensive backs over 
in the other hotel can't sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all scared of Phil now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RIGHT MODELS 
</P>
<P>
Long before he became a pro quarterback, the Giants' passer picked the right 
role models -- Terry Bradshaw and Roger Staubach, two of the toughest -- which 
might be one reason that his opponents have trouble sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
"The best compliment I ever had, I got in high school," Simms said. "A teammate 
told me, 'You throw like Bradshaw.' " 
</P>
<P>
Riding the team bus in Washington earlier this month, Simms was discussing 
quarterbacks with team chaplain Dave Bratton, who remarked that Staubach's 
comebacks were even more impressive than some of Montana's. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you about a Giant-Cowboy game back in the '70s," the chaplain 
exclaimed as nearby passengers listened in. "We had Dallas beat by two 
touchdowns in the fourth quarter, and Staubach brought 'em back to win. Can you 
imagine that?" 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine it!" Simms said. "I was there. That was 1979, and I was the rookie 
that Staubach did it to. I'd never seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
Simms remembers standing entranced on the sideline in the late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say, 'Oh, look at that pass,' " he recalls. "I'd say, 'Man, look at that 
one.' There I was, losing to Staubach, and all I could do was admire him. He 
made it look so easy." 
</P>
<P>
So did Bradshaw. 
</P>
<P>
And now Simms. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after he and Bratton got to the stadium that day, Simms easily carved 
up the Redskins, whose coach, Joe Gibbs, winner of two Super Bowls, has lost 
five straight to the Giants going into Sunday's series renewal. 
</P>
<P>
"A great quarterback is a guy who makes everyone around him better," Gibbs 
said. "And I think that's the best way to describe Simms." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor has another way. 
</P>
<P>
"Simms is a natural leader of this team," the all-pro linebacker said. "He 
holds the offense together. He's a cocky son of a gun. That's what makes him 
great." 
</P>
<P>
That isn't quite the way Simms sees it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just a lunch-pail kind of a guy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ANCIENT LINE 
</P>
<P>
One hard thing about growing up on a tobacco farm is that the fields have to be 
plowed. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' quarterback was in first grade when he learned that, he said on a 
quiet recent evening. 
</P>
<P>
"I came home from school one day and my father said, 'Let's go,' " Simms 
remembers. "He started off on the tractor, and I trudged along behind. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a two-man job -- two persons. He sat there comfortably on the tractor 
plowing up the weeds, and I crawled along in the dust behind him, on my hands 
and knees, keeping the plowed-up weeds off the tobacco plants. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked until dark, and we did it all summer -- every summer. You've got to 
believe me, football is more fun." 
</P>
<P>
The family, however, has been in tobacco longer than football. In fact, Simms 
is the only pro athlete in a long line of farmers. 
</P>
<P>
His forebears came over from England in the late 18th Century to grow tobacco 
in Maryland, his father, William, said. 
</P>
<P>
After moving to Kentucky, the Simms family had a little trouble with wild 
turkeys first, and then with another wild bunch, Quantrill's Raiders, a Civil 
War guerrilla band. 
</P>
<P>
"There were turkey crossings all through the county in those days, and the 
turkeys had the right of way over the farmers," William Simms said from his 
home in Louisville. "It was the law in Kentucky, you can look it up. 
</P>
<P>
"So my granddaddy took to trading. He was a successful mule trader and horse 
trader when Quantrill's Raiders came through on a surprise raid and stole 
everything he had. They even took his clothes, and left him standing there in 
his underwear." 
</P>
<P>
Back on the farm, the Simmses dug in and stayed until after Phil's parents had 
produced five sons and three daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Because replacements were far away on other farms, Phil's three older brothers 
needed him, at age 3, to fill out the sides for baseball. Not surprisingly, he 
ruined every game by failing to hit the ball, so to avert a family crisis they 
took to rolling it up to him. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time Dominic rolled me the ball, I hit it, and I'll never forget the 
feeling I had running to first," Phil said. "It was sweeter than a touchdown 
pass." 
</P>
<P>
At 8, the year he was promoted to pitcher, the family suddenly left the 
homestead. 
</P>
<P>
"My father and his father were in the farm together, and they were making a go 
of it before they had a run-in," he said. "That same day my father packed up 
and moved us all to Louisville." 
</P>
<P>
Through the rest of his school days, his parents worked for the Brown and 
Williamson Tobacco Co., his mother as a machine operator on the night shift. 
</P>
<P>
"The (night job) was easier than running a house with eight kids," Barbara 
Simms said. "But I did get a lot of help at home from all eight of them." 
</P>
<P>
Phil's chore was to keep the bathroom clean. 
</P>
<P>
"He wiggled out of it when he had to pitch or something," his mother said. "But 
if you could get him in there, Phil was the best I had on the bathroom shift. 
The toilet was always the cleanest when he scrubbed it." 
</P>
<P>
The Simms' back yard was adjacent to the schoolyard in the Okolona section of 
Louisville, and Phil only had to walk across the football field to school, 
fantasizing all the way. 
</P>
<P>
"I see my kids in the lap of luxury today," he said of sons Christopher and 
Matthew and daughter Deidre. "And it's sometimes necessary to remind them how 
lucky they are. All I need to say is, 'When I was your age, I had to walk to 
school.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RIGHT MODEL 
</P>
<P>
Matthew Simms was the baby of the family a few years ago when he fell ill one 
afternoon and worried Phil sick. 
</P>
<P>
Though both recovered in a day or so, Phil, fretting miserably the first night, 
kept taking the child's temperature every hour or so. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Simms, Phil's wife, remembers being roused from a sound sleep at 3 in the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
"What is it, Phil?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Matthew is too hot," he said. "I think we better get him to the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
And, though it turned out to be only an inconsequential virus, they all rushed 
off in Phil's car. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe any other father would have done the same, but I couldn't help but 
admire the way he took over," Diana said. 
</P>
<P>
Up close and personal, she has concluded, Phil is, basically, an asset around 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
"He's understanding and gentle -- such a gentleman -- and he's a darling with 
the children," she said. "But he doesn't like to cut the yard, and he has to be 
reminded to take out the trash. He's a country boy who acts like he's from a 
very wealthy family." 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Marymount University in Arlington, Va., Diana is a tall, blonde 
former model. 
</P>
<P>
"It was runway modeling -- designer show lines and all that," she said of her 
first career. "I loved it because it was a fast way to good money. But after I 
met Phil, well, I don't think he'd care to be married to a working girl." 
</P>
<P>
As do many of the Giants' families, the Simmses live in New Jersey, near the 
team's practice field. Theirs is a two-story colonial house on a cul-de-sac in 
Franklin Lakes, a village that Phil calls "a nice little town with a nice 
little Main Street -- very New England." 
</P>
<P>
Their vacation home is on a golf course near Palm Beach, Fla., where Phil tries 
to improve his putting enough to keep up with Lawrence Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"Golf is OK, but taking the kids to the ocean is the best," Diana said. 
</P>
<P>
Are they contemplating retirement from football to Florida? 
</P>
<P>
Not immediately, his wife said, then added: "I think he'll stay in football 
long enough to say, 'I've had enough, I can't take it anymore.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE CATALOGUE 
</P>
<P>
Party time at the Simms house is whenever Dec. 31 falls in the middle of the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
And the guest list typically includes their close friends and neighbors, many 
of them Manhattan commuters: the contractor who lives across the street, the 
man next door who runs a fresh-fish store and goes to market every morning, the 
former minor league ballplayer who specializes in dishware, a jeweler, a 
stockbroker, and others on the block. 
</P>
<P>
They were celebrating as usual a few years ago -- playing charades after a big 
dinner -- when Diana, noticing that midnight was approaching, signaled Phil. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been blessed with a very supportive wife," he said, recalling that 
evening. "With a big game coming up, she knew I should be in bed, and very soon 
I was." 
</P>
<P>
His can be a hard life. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't drift off for 15 or 20 minutes," he said. "Downstairs they were 
laughing and joking, and I lay there envying them." 
</P>
<P>
He is more familiar with lying in pain, but something as minor as the sprained 
ankle that forced Simms out of last week's game is not even worth mentioning. 
He's expected to play Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Phil has practiced all week," a Giant spokesman said. "He hasn't limped at 
all. He's played with a lot worse (injuries)." 
</P>
<P>
The thing that makes Phil tick, in Diana's view, is his self-control. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be very surprised if there's a more disciplined player in the league," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For a quarterback, self-discipline is essential. 
</P>
<P>
What are the additional requirements? What sets Simms and Montana above most 
other NFL quarterbacks? 
</P>
<P>
"Our teammates," Simms said. "And coaching." 
</P>
<P>
What else? 
</P>
<P>
"It takes so much (to play quarterback) that you don't want to hear it all," he 
said. "But I could mention four things that I think are important." 
</P>
<P>
So he mentioned them: confidence, competitiveness, few and minor injuries, and 
what he calls "the minimum physical equipment." 
</P>
<P>
The Simms catalogue: 
</P>
<P>
Ability -- "You don't need the world's strongest arm to play in the NFL, or 
overpowering size, or sprinter speed, but when you fall below the average in 
those (areas), you're in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"If your arm is suspect, you can't take advantage of the opportunities that 
come up for a quarterback -- and you can't build the confidence you've got to 
have to play well. 
</P>
<P>
"I see young guys every year (in the exhibition season) who are good 
quarterbacks, good leaders, but don't quite have what it takes physically." 
</P>
<P>
Competitiveness -- "Every veteran NFL quarterback I've ever known has been 
extremely competitive. 
</P>
<P>
"(To) quarterbacks, football isn't just a pastime (in which) they take pride in 
throwing or (scrambling) brilliantly. They're really only out there to win. 
</P>
<P>
"That isn't true, incidentally, of every guy in the league. Many NFL players 
aren't that competitive. Some of them are just out there putting in time, 
making a living, enjoying it. 
</P>
<P>
"Pro quarterbacks are all competitors." 
</P>
<P>
Confidence -- "You've got to have confidence in yourself because that's what 
relaxes you. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say that confidence is the single biggest factor in (quarterbacking). The 
game is very hard to play if you don't feel good about yourself. You tighten 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"It almost always takes a supportive coach to make you feel confident. If they 
don't say anything, or say the wrong things to (a reporter), they're not going 
to have a confident quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"The funny thing is that, one little supportive sentence is all it takes -- 
maybe only one a year, or one in your lifetime, or one every now and then. Not 
many coaches realize that. 
</P>
<P>
"The one certain way to gain confidence during the game is to complete your 
passes. Especially the first pass or two. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't so important if the team is planning to win with their running game 
that day. But if I were a coach and knew I was going to need some passing, I'd 
make absolutely sure that my guy could complete at least his first two, even if 
they lost 10 yards." 
</P>
<P>
Physical condition -- "You need a strong constitution to be a quarterback 
because you're always bouncing back from a beating. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing you fear is being incapacitated -- being out, benched with an 
injury. Our first Super Bowl season, I was beaten up a lot but never 
incapacitated, and I think that was a key. 
</P>
<P>
"Monday and Tuesday are the most important days of the week. You do whatever it 
takes to get well enough to participate when practice starts Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The league is so much more physical than it was 10 years ago that it doesn't 
feel like the same game. The (problem) isn't so much that the defensive players 
are bigger and stronger, it's that they're better football players. 
</P>
<P>
"They also gamble more now. They don't mind giving you a big play once in a 
while if they can beat you up on the next play. The name of the game was always 
get the quarterback, I guess, but they're getting better at it." 
</P>

INCONSISTENT OREGON STATE MEETS BRUINS; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA: BEAVERS WERE GOOD ENOUGH TO BEAT ARIZONA AND GIVE NEBRASKA A BATTLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If UCLA Coach Terry Donahue seems wary of Oregon State, the Bruins' opponent 
today at the Rose Bowl, it's understandable. 
</P>
<P>
Come again, one might say. Is this a joke? 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers are 1-6 overall and 1-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference. They have 
been beaten by Montana, Kansas and Nevada Las Vegas -- and that was the soft 
part of their schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, their one victory was a formidable achievement: They beat Arizona, 35-21, 
on Oct. 13 at Corvallis, Ore., and it wasn't a fluke, either. To put it in 
perspective, the Wildcats have already defeated UCLA and USC this season. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Oregon State extended Nebraska, trailing only 10-7 in the fourth 
quarter before losing, 31-7, on Sept. 29 at Lincoln, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers are baffling. After beating Arizona, they lost to Washington State, 
55-24, at home. 
</P>
<P>
No one is more baffled than Coach Dave Kragthorpe, who has struggled to bring 
respectability to a football program that has been down for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, there was a glimmer of hope when the Beavers won four games in each of the 
1988 and 1989 seasons. That's almost a major breakthrough considering that 
Oregon State had averaged only 1.6 wins through 16 previous seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a confusing season for us." Kragthorpe said. "We're not an outstanding 
team by any stretch of the imagination. But we're certainly somewhere between 
the way we played against Arizona and the way we played against Washington 
State." 
</P>
<P>
The losses to Montana, Kansas and UNLV still puzzle Kragthorpe. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were must wins for us if we were to have any kind of a season," he said. 
"And the way we played against Washington State is unexplainable." 
</P>
<P>
Kragthorpe, who was the offensive coordinator at Brigham Young for 10 years, is 
in his sixth season at Oregon State, the longest tenure there since Dee Andros 
was there from 1965 through '75. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured that we would be 3-4 now, and that's respectable for us," he said. 
"We lost some good players, but we had some good players returning. I thought 
we would be a little more successful because we have a favorable schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen of Kragthorpe's first 22 players are freshmen or sophomores. That 
allotment is not by choice. "We don't have a strong base of upperclassmen," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So, the struggle continues in Corvallis, and even Kragthorpe says he wasn't 
aware of the magnitude of his task when he became the Beavers' coach. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're down and fighting from the lower echelon in this league, every 
game you win is a major upset," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Recruiting is an ongoing problem for Oregon State. "It's difficult from the 
standpoint that we don't have any population base in our area," Kragthorpe 
said, adding that he is recruiting against the University of Oregon for the 
high school talent in the state as well as other Pac-10 schools. 
</P>
<P>
"So it's imperative we go out of state, and there again we're up against the 
same competition from Pac-10 schools." 
</P>
<P>
Kragthorpe has had to rely on junior college transfers so he will have the 
necessary numbers to compete. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries have also weakened the Beavers. Jason Kent, the team's best wide 
receiver, didn't recover sufficiently from a broken leg suffered late last 
season against Oregon. And the Beavers lost nose tackle Esera Tuaolo for the 
first three games because of a knee injury. Tuaolo, a 6-foot-3, 262-pound 
senior who grew up in Honolulu, was voted the outstanding defensive lineman in 
the Pac-10 last season. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State is also playing without its No. 1 quarterback, Matt Booher, who 
missed the Arizona and Washington State games because of a sprained left thumb 
and a hairline fracture of a bone in his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
His status is questionable today. Fred Schweer Jr., a redshirt freshman from 
Woodbridge High in Irvine, has performed more than adequately as a replacement. 
He led the Beavers to the upset victory over Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Injury report: UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said offensive guard Vaughn Parker 
(ankle injury) and defensive end Mike Chalenski (shoulder injury) are expected 
to play today. So is defensive tackle Brian Kelly, who had been expected to 
miss two games because of an ankle injury. On the questionable list are outside 
linebackers Arnold Ale and Randy Cole, with ankle and groin injuries, 
respectively.

<P>
Carson 31, Crenshaw 15 -- The Colts set a school record with 615 yards in total 
offense in the Pacific League win at Carson. The Colts, the Times' 
second-ranked City team, were led by senior quarterback John Walsh, who 
completed 23 of 45 passes for 470 yards and four touchdowns. His touchdown

<P>
A look at today's seven Breeders' Cup races at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1-MILLION SPRINT 
</P>
<P>
Distance: 6 Furlongs 
</P>
<P>
This race is frequently not won by a true sprinter, but by a horse such as 
Precisionist, who was dangerous up to distances of 1 1/8 miles. Dancing Spree, 
winner of last year's Sprint, fits that mold, coming into today's race off a 
couple of non-winning starts at 1 1/8 miles. Dayjur, the English sprinter, is 
favored, and he worked sensationally the other day, running half a mile in :45 
3/5, but he has the No. 13 post and is running on dirt for the first time. The 
locals are giving short notice to Corwyn Bay, despite his two convincing sprint 
victories in California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1-MILLION JUVENILE FILLIES 
</P>
<P>
Distance: 1 1/16 miles 
</P>
<P>
On a day when there is a dearth of sure things, Meadow Star appears to be a 
sure thing. Picking the second horse is the challenge. Three California-based 
entrants -- Garden Gal, Lite Light and Beyond Perfection -- have chances as 
good as any others' to be runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1-MILLION DISTAFF 
</P>
<P>
Distance: 1 1/8 miles 
</P>
<P>
The surprise would be if anyone but Go For Wand and Bayakoa formed the exacta. 
Gorgeous, injured Friday, has been scratched, and that probably makes Colonial 
Waters, winless in five starts this year, the third choice. Bayakoa, not 
nominated for the Breeders' Cup, has been supplemented for the second 
consecutive year at $200,000 as she tries to repeat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1-MILLION MILE 
</P>
<P>
Distance: One mile on turf 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Francois Boutin, who won this race twice with Miesque, the French 
filly, could hit the winner's circle today with Priolo, who comes from off the 
pace. Steinlen won the Mile last year, then was voted America's grass champion, 
and although he is a lukewarm favorite today, not many trainers fear him. "The 
European horses are the ones to beat," says Mack Miller, who trains Who's To 
Pay, an 8-1 shot. "The course will be soft, and they're used to that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1-MILLION JUVENILE 
</P>
<P>
Distance: 1 1/16 miles 
</P>
<P>
Fly So Free, winner of the Champagne at Belmont three weeks ago, and Best Pal, 
winner of the Del Mar Futurity and the Norfolk at Santa Anita, are the top 
horses. Deposit Ticket, who finished last as the Champagne favorite, is seeking 
redemption. Best Pal has been supplemented into the race for a fee of $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$2-MILLION TURF 
</P>
<P>
Distance: 1 1/2 miles 
</P>
<P>
Nine horses from France's Arc de Triomphe have come to the Breeders' Cup and 
failed, but this year the Turf has Saumarez, the Arc winner owned by Bruce 
McNall, the owner of the Kings, and Wayne Gretzky, his best-paid employee. If 
not Saumarez, another European-based horse should win, because the Americans 
are weak on the grass this year. Golden Pheasant, who would have run as 
Saumarez's entrymate, is out with an injury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$3-MILLION CLASSIC 
</P>
<P>
Distance: 1 1/4 miles 
</P>
<P>
California-based horses -- Wild Again, Skywalker, Ferdinand, Alysheba and 
Sunday Silence -- have won this stake five out of six years, but with Sunday 
Silence and Criminal Type retired, that trend could be interrupted today, 
unless Flying Continental has a Jockey Club Gold Cup encore in his system. 
Rhythm won the Travers at this distance, on a hot August day when Go And Go, 
the Belmont winner, had a terrible return trip from Europe and ran badly. This 
time, Go And Go has arrived without mishap and the cool weather should be more 
to his liking. Dispersal and Unbridled, the Kentucky Derby winner, are good 
horses who are stuck on the outside in this cluttered field. Izvestia, the 
Canadian Triple Crown champion, would appear to have a good post, No. 1, but he 
doesn't like running inside horses. BILL CHRISTINE

<P>
Gorgeous, who finished second to Bayakoa in last year's Breeders' Cup Distaff, 
will miss a chance to reverse that outcome today because of a training injury 
Friday at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
Gorgeous suffered a chipped bone in her left knee, an injury that was 
discovered when she was X-rayed after a gallop. 
</P>
<P>
Gorgeous, who was going to be retired after today's race, will go to the 
breeding shed with a record of eight victories, four seconds and one third in 
14 starts. She earned $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Half of Gorgeous' six losses came in races won by Bayakoa. Gorgeous handed 
Bayakoa one of her three defeats this year, beating the Argentine-bred mare in 
the Apple Blossom Handicap at Oaklawn Park in April. 
</P>
<P>
Go for Wand, winner of seven of eight starts, is the even-money favorite in the 
Distaff. Bayakoa is 6-5 on the morning line. BILL CHRISTINE

</P>
<P>
HOLLYWOOD PARK: FURTHER REDUCTION OF BOARD'S MEMBERSHIP COULD AID POWER BID OF 
HUBBARD, WHO SUES FOR MORE TIME TO PREPARE FOR SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The battle for control of Hollywood Park continued to go through preliminary 
posturing as Lodwrick Cook, chairman of the Hollywood Park Operating Company, 
resigned and R.D. Hubbard, who is attempting to gain track control, filed suit 
against the track. 
</P>
<P>
Cook resigned by letter Wednesday, citing the need to devote more time to his 
business. Cook is chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based Atlantic 
Richfield Company. Cook could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Cook's resignation becomes important to Hubbard should anyone else resign from 
the board. Hubbard would then need only five votes to gain control of the then 
nine-person board. Under the current 10- or 11-person board, six votes are 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hubbard has said that if he can't gain control of the board, he will 
force a proxy fight among the shareholders. A proxy fight probably would cost 
each side about $2 million, with the shareholders paying to defend the track. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard met last week in Los Angeles with the board of directors and individual 
committees and, according to sources close to the negotiations, made a 
compromise proposal that was unacceptable to Marje Everett, chief operating 
officer of Hollywood Park and the person that Hubbard has asked to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
Neither side would talk about the compromise plan. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park then announced Wednesday that Jan. 28 would be the date of the 
shareholders' meeting and, according to by-laws, Hubbard has until Oct. 31 to 
file a proposed slate of directors and any information he wished to be given to 
the shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard's suit, filed in Hollywood Park's incorporation state of Delaware 
Friday, is asking for more time to file such information. The suit alleges that 
seven days is not a reasonable amount of time. 
</P>
<P>
The second part of the suit deals with the "poison pill" law, which is designed 
to protect shareholders in the event of a hostile takeover by limiting the 
rights of the party attempting the takeover. Hubbard is seeking to not be 
recognized as a group, thus affording him the rights accorded any long-standing 
stockholder. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard, in New York for the Breeders' Cup, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"The by-law provisions are relatively commonplace and in place at most 
corporations," said Bob Forgnone, an attorney for Hollywood Park. "It is our 
judgment that the legality of those by-laws will be upheld. We feel similarly 
with respect to the shareholders' rights plan (in regard to voting rights in 
what is perceived to be a hostile takeover.)" 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park announced Wednesday that it would pay shareholders a 
third-quarter dividend of 12.5 cents and 15 cents for the fourth quarter. A 
statement by the company cited "increased efficiencies in on-track operations, 
strong simulcast revenues and a greatly reduced debt load" as the reasons for 
the profit.

Macy Considers Equity Sales: Retailer R. H. Macy &amp; Co. is considering the 
sale of a significant equity stake to help reduce debt. Macy, which already has 
sold small stakes to finance buybacks of some of its bonds, said it was 
considering more equity sales and was "exploring the possibility of selling a 
more substantial equity interest to a buyer who shares our view of Macy's value 
and future." The retailer disclosed its plans in a letter to stockholders but 
did not identify any prospective investors.

JUDGE UNSEALS KEATING GRAND JURY TESTIMONY; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: DEFENDANTS IN THE SECURITIES FRAUD CASE CLAIMED IT WOULD HURT THEIR 
CHANCE OF A FAIR TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles County judge Friday ordered the public release of nearly 4,500 
pages of grand jury testimony that led to the state securities fraud indictment 
of former thrift magnate Charles H. Keating Jr. and three co-defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito rejected a defense request to keep the 
documents secret. The testimony, transcripts of which will be released next 
Friday, provides the basis for the 42-count indictment against the former 
operators of the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen C. Neal, Keating's attorney, said after the hearing that he did not 
plan to appeal Ito's ruling. Defense attorneys had argued that release of the 
transcripts could hurt their clients' ability to get a fair trial. All the 
defendants have pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, though, Neal said he would be willing to talk to federal authorities 
about limited immunity for his client in exchange for Keating's testimony 
before the Senate Ethics Committee, which is investigating the conduct of five 
senators who intervened on Keating's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly would receive or return a phone call" from ethics committee 
members, Neal said. His comments came in the wake of an article in The Times 
this week revealing that the committee had considered offering Keating immunity 
in exchange for testimony against the senators, including Alan Cranston 
(D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
The committee has denied that it ever discussed granting immunity for Keating, 
an act that would severely damage a federal criminal investigation into one of 
the nation's biggest thrift disasters. Lincoln's collapse in April, 1989, is 
expected to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In court Friday, defense attorneys argued that the release of grand jury 
testimony from 94 witnesses would fuel further damaging publicity in the case, 
provide one-sided stories on the prosecution's claims and limit the number of 
potential jurors who have not been influenced by continued news reports. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for The Times and the Orange County Register argued that any stories 
arising out of the release of the transcripts would constitute only an 
incremental increase in the amount of information on the case. 
</P>
<P>
Ito pointed out that The Times has been putting Lincoln stories in the business 
section, "which frankly not a lot of people read." He found that the defense 
failed to provide enough facts showing that release of the grand jury 
transcripts would prejudice the defendants' right to a fair trial.

AETNA TO TRIM 2,600 JOBS IN REORGANIZATION 
</P>

HARTFORD, Conn.

<TEXT>
<P>
Aetna Life and Casualty Co. Friday reported a 51% fall in its third-quarter 
earnings and said it will cut 2,600 of its 45,500 jobs in a reorganization 
costing $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Hartford-based insurance company said it will disband its three domestic 
insurance divisions and form new divisions, which will be put in place in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
After deducting for the reorganization, Aetna earned $88.6 million, or 80 cents 
a share, in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In last year's period, it earned $182.6 million, or $1.63 per share, including 
a gain of $27.2 million on the sale of Federated Investors Inc. and a 
$15-million tax credit.

Revenue in the period was $4.84 billion, off slightly from $4.90 billion in the 
1989 quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue was hit by a $57.8-million capital loss, against a $166-million gain 
last year.

Industry analysts said they were concerned about Aetna's mortgage portfolio and 
the profitability of its property and casualty divisions. 
</P>
<P>
"While the numbers are better than expected, I still want to know more about 
their mortgage portfolio," said Herbert Goodfriend, first vice president, 
Prudential-Bache. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Culbert, analyst with the Firemark Group, said, "The issue of Aetna's 
mortgage portfolio was not addressed." 
</P>
<P>
Aetna said its pretax net additions to reserves for mortgage loans and real 
estate writedowns totaled $58 million in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"The real issue, though, is whether there are more mortgage problems 
developing," said Tom Sargent, Conning &amp; Co.

MOSBACHER STUMPS FOR MEXICO PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher and his Mexican counterpart, Jaime 
Serra Puche, ended a weeklong tour of the United States in Los Angeles on 
Friday, selling the upcoming free trade talks between their nations to 
businesses already eager to find new markets and reduce trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations, which will begin next year and may include Canada as well, 
are aimed at eliminating the many remaining trade barriers between Mexico and 
the United States. The result, government officials hope, will be a North 
American trading block that will be better able to compete against Europe and 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials see Mexico -- America's third-largest trading partner -- as a 
nearby source of lower-cost labor and a market of 82 million consumers. Mexico 
considers the U.S. a major source of investment and a lucrative market for its 
growing export industries. 
</P>
<P>
The five-city U.S. tour "has been very successful," Serra said in a press 
conference with Mosbacher during a daylong trade seminar in Los Angeles. "The 
reaction (from business) has been enthusiastic." 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher, in response to previous criticism that a trade agreement would shift 
U.S jobs to Mexico, said a stronger Mexican economy would boost demand for U.S. 
products and create jobs here. 
</P>
<P>
"When (U.S.) companies go . . . into Mexico, it creates jobs in the U.S.," 
Mosbacher said. "That's not true anywhere else in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Some business people at the seminar said they hoped that a trade agreement 
would address what they see as unfair advantages held by their Mexican 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"An American tuna vessel has an impossible task of fishing in Mexican waters," 
said a Southern California fishing industry executive who asked to go unnamed. 
"It's the age-old question of having an even playing field. And we don't have 
that right now." 
</P>
<P>
Many at the seminar said an accord would help stabilize the often tumultuous 
relations between the nations that have stunted U.S. investment in Mexico. The 
agreement would also ease fears that future Mexican governments might abandon 
the current administration's efforts to open Mexico to foreign investment and 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the overriding fears is, 'What about tomorrow?' " said Crawford F. 
Brubaker, a Glendale-based import-export consultant, expressing his clients' 
concerns. "A free-trade agreement would set things in concrete. It would make 
them hard to change." 
</P>
<P>
While Mexico has reduced trade barriers and tariffs, many restrictions and 
differences remain. For example, AST Research, an Irvine-based computer maker 
that entered the Mexican market this year, finds itself in court trying to win 
back the right to use its trademark after a Mexican competitor copyrighted it. 
</P>
<P>
"We are fighting a legal battle to get our name back," said AST President Safi 
Qureshey. "These are things that could easily discourage companies" from doing 
business in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Business people working on the Mexican side of the border also see benefits to 
the trade agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Javier Sustaeta, who owns a real estate development firm in Tijuana and an 
import-export firm in San Diego, said his plans to build a dinnerware plant in 
Mexico will prove even more lucrative should the U.S. eliminate a 7% 
value-added tax on certain imports. Additionally, larger flows of investment 
into Mexico might help his real estate business.

BUDGET: THE PACKAGE IS RUSHED TO HOUSE FOR A VOTE. LEADERS OF BOTH PARTIES AND 
THE PRESIDENT'S AIDES BACK THE NEW MEASURE. IT FALLS $10 BILLION SHORT OF 
EARLIER $500-BILLION GOAL.

<P>
Senate and House negotiators reached formal agreement Friday on a trimmed-down 
version of a compromise budget deficit-reduction plan and sent it to the House 
floor for approval only 10 days before the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in the House Speaker's office, after two full days of additional 
wrangling following months of partisan discord, congressional leaders of both 
parties and President Bush's own representatives gave their blessing to the 
package. 
</P>
<P>
The House was expected to approve the package, albeit narrowly, sometime early 
today, and the Senate would then vote on the accord later in the day. Bush 
Administration officials said there was no doubt that the President would sign 
the new measure. 
</P>
<P>
The five-year budget plan falls $10 billion short of the $500-billion 
deficit-reduction goal that the two sides had set in an earlier accord, which 
had been worked out at a 4 1/2-month-long summit between the White House and 
congressional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, it contained a sizable tax increase, designed to hit hardest at the 
rich. And it included substantial cuts in spending on agriculture and other 
government benefit programs. 
</P>
<P>
The accord came as the Treasury Department disclosed that the federal deficit 
for fiscal 1990, which ended on Sept. 30, jumped to $220.39 billion, the 
second-worst showing ever. The record -- $221.2 billion -- was reported in 
fiscal 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Economists predicted that the budget deficit for the current year, fiscal 1991, 
would soar to the $275-billion range, even with the deficit-reduction plan that 
is expected to be signed into law this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the endorsement of the plan by House and Senate negotiators Friday, 
approval by the full House early today was not a certainty. 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) predicted that the House would pass the 
legislation, but his top lieutenants reportedly were worried that 
election-conscious House Democrats might balk. Analysts figured that Democrats 
must provide 80% of the 217 votes needed for passage. 
</P>
<P>
Most Republicans in the House -- defying President Bush's support for the plan 
-- had indicated they would oppose any compromise that raises taxes. House 
Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) had promised no more than 40 to 50 
votes from GOP ranks to help pass the package. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, however, leaders of both parties were more confident that the 
budget plan would be approved with bipartisan backing. 
</P>
<P>
House Democratic leaders, fearing that further delay might erode support for 
the compromise agreement, rushed to bring it to the House floor late Friday 
night or in the wee hours today as one of the last acts before Congress quits 
for the year. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators gave final approval Friday to tax increases totaling $164.6 billion 
over the next five years and tax breaks worth $27.4 billion, mainly to "working 
poor" families with incomes under $20,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
There also would be $2.5 billion in tax relief for the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, revenues would contribute $137.2 billion to deficit reduction, with 
spending reductions of $185 billion for the defense industry and a $100-billion 
cutback in mandatory benefit programs. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the $490-billion package would consist of estimated savings in 
interest payments on the debt, now amounting to $264.8 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most tax packages of the last decade, the plan presented to the House 
would tilt sharply against those making more than $200,000 a year through a 
combination of rate increases, limitations on deductions and a phase-out of the 
$2,050 personal exemption. 
</P>
<P>
People in this income category would see their taxes raised by an average 6.3%, 
compared to an increase of roughly 2% for those making between $20,000 and 
$200,000 a year and tax cuts of 2% or 3% for those below the $20,000 level. 
</P>
<P>
The new budget package would raise the tax rate on the highest-income brackets 
to 31%, from 28% now. It would also limit itemized deductions for wealthy 
taxpayers, reduce the benefit from personal exemptions and impose the Medicare 
payroll tax on higher incomes. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the compromise contained a 5-cent gasoline tax increase, starting 
Dec. 1, and higher taxes on cigarettes, beer, wine, alcohol and a limited 
number of luxury goods, such as high-priced cars, boats, planes, jewelry and 
furs. 
</P>
<P>
The gasoline-tax issue is particularly sensitive in California because the 
state already has raised its gasoline tax by 5 cents a gallon, with additional 
penny-a-gallon increases scheduled each January through 1994. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise package contained few surprises, since most of its tax 
provisions were telegraphed in advance during several days of semi-public 
bargaining by negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
It did include a tax break for parents of new babies -- a tax credit of up to 
$340 for low-income taxpayers with children under 1 year old, effective Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
A new child health insurance credit of 6% was added for working families with 
incomes under $20,000. And the existing earned-income tax credits were more 
than doubled, with larger credits or federal payments to families depending on 
the number of children they have. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest single revenue-gainer, however, would come from applying the 
existing 1.45% health insurance tax to the first $125,000 of wages, or 
salaries, instead of using the $51,300 cutoff in effect this year. It would 
raise $26.9 billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
The alternative minimum tax rate would be lifted from 21% to 24%, affecting 
relatively few high-income people who otherwise would pay no tax at all because 
they have so many legal deductions. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the changes in individual tax rates would raise more than $40 billion 
toward the deficit-cutting goal. 
</P>
<P>
In a concession to investors, the tax on capital gains was set at 28% -- a cut 
for those now in the 33% marginal rate category but merely preserving the same 
rate for the very rich, who now pay 28% on ordinary income. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise would raise airline ticket taxes to 10% from 8% and extend the 
federal telephone tax for another five years. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to sweeten the package, the Senate-House negotiators decided to 
extend for one year a series of popular tax breaks for business, including a 
research and experimentation tax credit and a low-income housing credit. These 
provisions would lose $5.8 billion in revenue over the next half-decade. 
</P>
<P>
New taxes on insurance companies, however, would raise $8 billion. A 
controversial plan to impose Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes on 
state and local public employes who do not participate in a public employee 
retirement system was added to the package. It would yield about $9.2 billion 
in revenue.

BUSH BACKS PROP. 140 ON TERM LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER and CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, the son of a senator and a professional politician for 24 
years, Friday endorsed Proposition 140, saying he wanted to "limit the terms of 
permanent politicians." 
</P>
<P>
Bush made the announcement in Southern California on the first of what aides 
have vowed will be an 11-day, "Harry Truman-style" campaign to reverse the 
recent slide of GOP candidates nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The endorsement was partly intended to bolster the campaign of Republican 
gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson, who is locked in a dead-even race with 
Democrat Dianne Feinstein and has embraced the term-limiting measure as proof 
that his candidacy represents change. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, GOP candidates increasingly are turning to the issue as they search 
for a way to move the campaign debate away from the budget and taxing the rich 
-- issues on which Democrats have prospered for a month. 
</P>
<P>
In comparing Bush's tour to the famous "Give 'em hell, Harry" 1948 campaign, 
aides to the President were looking back to the come-from-behind win that 
Truman carried off by ceaselessly lambasting the Republican-controlled 
"do-nothing" Congress. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush, who has spent the last two years seeking bipartisan agreements with a 
Democratic-controlled Congress, has never quite been able to adopt the Truman 
style. 
</P>
<P>
And so, speaking to a $500-a-head Republican fund-raising breakfast in Irvine, 
Bush blamed the Democrats for "bigger and bigger government with more and more 
spending" but also praised Democratic leaders for "working cooperatively" and 
"very hard" to get a budget agreement. 
</P>
<P>
He touted the federal budget deal that he and Democratic leaders have worked 
out, then said the only reason he had to raise taxes was "because the 
Democratically controlled Congress simply has been on an uncontrolled spending 
binge." 
</P>
<P>
And he said Republicans "stood for strength at home and strength abroad" then 
quickly added that "partisanship . . . stops at the water's edge." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, at a $1,000-per-person Wilson-for-governor lunch -- which 
Wilson addressed by a satellite hookup from Washington -- Bush took a somewhat 
harder tack. Congress "would rather issue feel-good proclamations than address 
the real problems of the country," he said. "It's nice to be out of 
Washington," he added. "I'm getting warmed up." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's mixed message drew a somewhat mixed response. At the morning fund 
raiser, organizers brought in 200 college-age supporters to line the walls in 
the back of the hall and cheer Bush on. By contrast, the approximately 750 
paying guests, many of whom had worked in Bush's 1988 campaign -- and most of 
whom will have their taxes go up noticeably because of the budget deal -- 
seemed polite, friendly, but subdued. 
</P>
<P>
Although many GOP candidates around the country have endorsed term limits, 
Bush, whose career has been built on his extensive government resume, has been 
slow to embrace the issue, despite prodding from Vice President Dan Quayle and 
other advisers. They argue that term limits is an issue that can help 
Republicans focus voters' anti-incumbent mood on the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Even Friday, as he endorsed Proposition 140, Bush hesitated. Term limits are 
"one way to correct the abuse of power," he said. "I say it's an idea whose 
time has come." But he never said outright that he thought it was a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
Bush implied, but did not say, that he would support term limits for Congress 
as well, something that would require a constitutional amendment. Bush spent 
two terms in the House of Representatives and much of the remainder of his 
government career in appointed offices. The 1988 Republican platform, Bush 
noted, endorsed term limits for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
While the President specifically mentioned Proposition 140, he did not endorse 
a competing term limits measure, Proposition 131, which is less Draconian than 
140 and includes provisions for public financing of elections. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 140, in addition to limiting terms of state officeholders, would 
eliminate their state-financed pensions and require a 50% cut in the 
Legislature's operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of Proposition 140 greeted Bush's endorsement with glee, saying that 
the move would put the initiative back in the news. 
</P>
<P>
"We're delighted. He puts himself in good company," said Lee Phelps, co-author 
of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Phelps said Bush's endorsement would make voters more inclined to take a look 
at the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"Our problem has always been -- working with a minimum of money and maximum of 
volunteers -- getting that great segment of the public who weren't aware of us 
made aware of us," he said. 
</P>

But others questioned whether Bush's endorsement of Proposition 140, coming 
soon after endorsements from Wilson and Quayle, would make the measure appear 
more partisan. Its backers, and those of Proposition 131, have emphasized the 
bipartisan nature of their support. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little bit concerned there is a partisan gloss on this, with Republicans 
seeking to grab a citizens' issue for their own," said Jim Wheaton, organizer 
of the yes-on-131 campaign.

CONFEREES STRIP DEATH PENALTY FROM CRIME BILL 
</P>

Congressional negotiators stripped from a massive anti-crime bill Friday night 
controversial death penalty and assault rifle provisions that many lawmakers 
had hoped to use in campaigns before the Nov. 6 elections. 
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic showdown, Senate and House conferees threw out of the bill 
altogether a proposed ban on semiautomatic assault firearms and a major 
expansion of the federal death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Senate negotiators had refused to scrap the assault firearm ban, and House 
conferees had blocked the death penalty expansion by insisting on a key 
safeguard for defendants being sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides deadlocked also on sweeping proposals to limit appeals by Death 
Row inmates and to increase the ability of prosecutors to use illegally seized 
evidence at trial, and they removed those items from the bill as well, 
retaining only a collection of far less controversial, though significant, 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
The stripped-down omnibus crime bill, expected to be passed before the 101st 
Congress adjourns this weekend, will furnish more tools to fight savings and 
loan fraud, authorize $900 million for local police agencies, provide $300 
million for states to develop alternatives to overcrowded prisons, add hundreds 
of federal law enforcement agents and prosecutors, increase penalties for child 
pornography and crack down on athletes' use of steroids. 
</P>
<P>
The action by conferees on differing Senate and House crime bills was a major 
setback for President Bush. Since early 1989, he has pushed for an expansion of 
the federal death penalty, a limitation on habeas corpus appeals filed by 
prisoners who face execution and a liberalization of rules governing evidence 
seized by police, particularly in drug cases. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), the prime 
sponsor of the Senate crime measure, sought to present the outcome in the best 
possible light. 
</P>
<P>
"The stuff police really want was left in the bill," Biden said. "For example, 
though I offered the death penalty amendment, the fact is that local police 
don't care much about the federal death penalty. It doesn't affect much of 
anything, in all honesty. Everything else, from law enforcement money to child 
pornography, is still in the bill." 
</P>
<P>
Biden added that "next year, we're going to go back at it" or go over the 
jettisoned provisions covering the death penalty, habeas corpus appeals, 
assault weapons restrictions and the so-called exclusionary rule on illegally 
seized evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The leading conservative sponsors of anti-crime legislation, Sen. Strom 
Thurmond (R-S.C.) and Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), expressed bitter 
disappointment at the conferees' action. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disgrace that this conference has not passed out a crime bill to 
protect this country from criminals," said Thurmond, telling proponents that 
"you're deceiving the people if you call this a crime bill." 
</P>
<P>
McCollum said it was so "outrageous" that he might urge Bush to veto the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
The main stumbling block to an agreement was the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The government has been without a broad death penalty since 1972, when the 
Supreme Court struck down all capital punishment laws because they left too 
much discretion to juries in sentencing. The court prescribed certain 
procedures for the penalty to be restored. 
</P>
<P>
The new procedures were adopted by Congress in listing two crimes for the 
federal death penalty in 1974 and 1988: airline hijackings that result in death 
and drug-trafficking murders. 
</P>
<P>
But about 30 federal crimes that were knocked off the death penalty books in 
1972, including the intentional killing of the President, have never been 
reinstated. This year's crime bills would have done so. 
</P>
<P>
However, the House version carried a provision that would let defendants escape 
execution if they could prove that their sentence had been imposed because of 
racial discrimination. Bush vigorously opposed this provision, called the 
Racial Justice Act, contending that it would virtually negate capital 
punishment because it would be nearly impossible for prosecutors to rebut 
race-based statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), House negotiators insisted on keeping 
this "safeguard," which the Senate refused to accept, creating the deadlock.

ANOTHER FIGHT TO INTEGRATE;

THE DISABLED ARE BEING 'MAINSTREAMED' WITH NEW FERVOR IN SOME SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
MANY TEACHERS AND PARENTS SAY EVEN THE SEVERELY HANDICAPPED FARE BETTER IN 
REGULAR SCHOOLS.

When Sarah Engelman talks about the education of her blonde-haired, blue-eyed 
daughter, her speech is peppered with the vernacular of the civil rights 
struggles of decades ago. She wants her daughter taught in an "integrated" 
setting, she says, instead of the segregated classrooms she was offered by the 
Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
But Engelman is not concerned about race. For her and millions of other parents 
of handicapped youngsters across the country, "integration" means putting their 
children on regular campuses alongside children without disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"A segregated classroom leads to a segregated life. And I want Alexis to be 
part of the real world," said Engelman, whose 6-year-old daughter has a 
chromosomal anomaly that limits her mental and physical development. 
</P>
<P>
Once called mainstreaming, the idea of putting disabled children in regular 
classes is not new. 
</P>
<P>
But the push for integration has been taken up with a new fervor in some school 
systems by teachers, parents and advocates for the disabled, who cite scores of 
studies showing that even profoundly handicapped children fare better on 
regular campuses. 
</P>
<P>
They make friends and learn social skills from other children, the research 
shows. And many of their parents have decided that is more important than the 
practical skills they might learn in the cloistered atmosphere of special 
education schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I would love it if Alexis could learn to read and write and handle money so 
she could have a job," said Engelman, "but realistically what I want for her is 
to get along with people, to learn to speak up for herself, to be able to enjoy 
herself at her sister's birthday party." 
</P>
<P>
While some California school districts such as San Diego and San Francisco have 
embraced the notion of full inclusion of handicapped students, others like 
those in Los Angeles and Orange County are moving more slowly, responding to 
specific parent requests, but doing little to push alternatives to their 
special education schools. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, as the integration movement picks up steam, some states, such as 
Vermont, Colorado, Oregon and Iowa, are closing their separate special 
education schools and placing handicapped students at regular schools -- some 
in small, separate classes made up only of children with similar disabilities, 
and others sprinkled among nonhandicapped children in regular classes. 
</P>
<P>
Students in both of those settings are considered "integrated" because they 
have opportunities to interact with non-handicapped children, either in class 
or during activities such as lunch or recess. Research cites benefits of 
placing handicapped children in either regular classrooms or in separate 
classrooms on regular campuses as long as they are allowed to interact with 
other students. 
</P>
<P>
Still "segregated" are the children who attend separate special education 
schools, which handle students with the most severe physical, mental or 
emotional problems -- children who were, as recently as 15 years ago, often 
denied a public school education at all. 
</P>
<P>
For some of their parents, the separate schools represent a hard-won victory 
and a refuge from rejection and hostility. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a split among parents," said Bonnie Clemans, whose teen-age, mentally 
retarded son attends a special education school in Azusa. "Some of us are still 
very protective; we feel it would be just as limiting to put a child with a 
peer group he can't compete with and doesn't identify with." 
</P>
<P>
There is no one right way to educate all handicapped children, contends Phillip 
Callison, assistant superintendent for special education for the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. "We've got everything from students who need just a 
little help with speech, to ones who are on a gurney and need somebody to check 
on them and see if they're still breathing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these children are not going to get all the services they need in a 
regular classroom. When a regular teacher has to spend 40% of her time trying 
to teach a child who's not going to learn anything anyway, everyone suffers." 
</P>
<P>
Required by a 1975 federal law to educate handicapped students, districts 
around the country created "special education" departments, with separate 
schools and programs for youngsters whose disabilities ranged from almost 
imperceptible learning problems, to severe mental and emotional disturbances, 
to physical handicaps, such as deafness or blindness. 
</P>
<P>
Today in California about half of the most profoundly disabled children attend 
segregated schools. 
</P>
<P>
In the 625,000-student Los Angeles district, more than 58,000 students are 
enrolled in special education programs. Of those, 5,000 attend the district's 
18 special education centers. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County -- which teaches about 1,000 of its 31,900 special education 
students in schools for the handicapped -- took a major step toward integration 
with the opening in September of a San Juan Capistrano school built 
specifically to accommodate all students, including those who are severely 
handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego School Board voted last year to try to move all of the district's 
handicapped students onto regular campuses by the 1995-96 school year in a 
comprehensive effort touted as a model for the rest of the state. 
</P>
<P>
And in Ventura County, the Conejo Valley school district was ordered by state 
education officials in 1988 to transfer all 65 students from a county-run 
special education school to regular schools to provide integration 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Most school districts offer a range of educational options, with each child's 
placement determined annually after an assessment by teachers, psychologists 
and parents, who devise a plan that spells out such things as what the child 
should learn and how much time should be spent with non-handicapped students. 
</P>
<P>
But some parents say they are not told about the option of putting their 
children in regular classes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like you go to a restaurant and you're given a menu, but there are 
choices available that are not on the menu so you don't know to ask for them," 
said Eileen Cassidy, who heads the local office of the Developmental 
Disabilities Board, a state agency that monitors programs for people with 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Placement decisions must be approved by school officials and parents, but 
Cassidy said administrators often tout the advantages of segregated placement, 
with its small, intimate classes and specialized instruction and services. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very inviting," said Engelman. "The whole idea that she's better 
protected, she'll get more attention. . . . They feed you into the special ed 
system, leading you to think it's better for your child." 
</P>
<P>
Keeping her daughter in a busy classroom with up to 30 other students has "been 
rough at times," admits Engelman, who hired an aide to help Alexis in her 
kindergarten classroom when the district refused to provide one. 
</P>
<P>
"School is hard for her. She's all right when she's there, but sometimes she 
gets in the car (after school) and starts sobbing and I wonder if I'm doing the 
right thing." 
</P>
<P>
But experts say the evidence is irrefutable that disabled children taught in 
integrated settings display better social development and a higher mastery of 
skills than segregated students. 
</P>
<P>
"Prior to 1978, if a child was severely disabled it was felt he should be 
taught whatever you could teach him in a secure environment, then when he 
reached 21, hand him over to a day activity program where he could make baskets 
or ceramics," said Wayne Sailor, a San Francisco State professor recognized 
nationally as an expert on integration. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we realize that by enhancing a child's social development, you maximize 
his chances to learn more sophisticated skills." 
</P>
<P>
Connie Lapin of Northridge said she bought the separate-is-better argument 17 
years ago and kept her autistic son "isolated" in special education classes all 
his life. The youth, now 22, lives in a group home with several other autistic 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the biggest mistake I could have made," said Lapin, who heads state 
schools Supt. Bill Honig's advisory committee on special education. "The small 
classes, the extra attention . . . it all sounded so good. But what are the 
kids going to learn in a situation like that, with six other autistic kids as 
models? 
</P>
<P>
"If I'd had him in a normal environment, my son wouldn't have been cured, but 
he would have been a lot happier. Can you imagine how good it would have felt 
for him to just make a friend?" 
</P>
<P>
In practice, the integration of handicapped children is often difficult. Some 
are disruptive, others out of touch with what goes on around them. Many need 
aides to keep them tuned in to classroom activities and others need medical 
assistance or help with physical tasks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just a matter of having ramps and special restroom facilities," 
explained Carol Arnesen, director of special eduction for the Orange County 
Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's special medical equipment, changing tables for older children 
who are incontinent, specialized cafeteria services because many are tube fed. 
. . . It's like running a mini-hospital and in many cases it's just not 
practical to (adapt) a regular classroom." 
</P>
<P>
But in San Diego, school officials are working to do just that, as they try to 
move even the most severely handicapped students onto regular campuses. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first proposed it three or four years ago, there was panic," recalled 
Jack Fleck, the district's assistant director of special education. "Principals 
wanted to know what they were going to do with these (handicapped) kids and how 
the regular ed kids were going to react." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, there has been little opposition expressed by either regular education 
students or their parents in San Diego and other districts. 
</P>
<P>
School officials say that is because they typically meet with teachers and 
parents to explain the integration process. And parents of handicapped students 
often go out of their way to smooth their children's paths -- offering to meet 
with PTAs and student groups to answer questions and dispel parents' fears. 
</P>
<P>
But other parents say their disabled children are sometimes made scapegoats by 
parents of non-handicapped students for problems that arise in regular 
classrooms. "If their kids start having problems, it's because the teachers 
gave that handicapped kid too much time," Clemans said. "No one wants to say it 
to you, but you know that kind of resentment exists." 
</P>
<P>
Young children seem to accept their new handicapped classmates well, but it is 
sometimes difficult for teen-age students to find acceptance, unless they have 
been in regular classes over the years and already made friends among their 
non-handicapped peers, parents and teachers say. 
</P>
<P>
"At Alexis' age, the kids notice that she's different, but they don't hold it 
against her," said Engelman, whose daughter receives the same birthday party 
invitations her non-handicapped classmates do. "What I hope is the friends she 
makes now will still be her friends when she's 16." 
</P>
<P>
Even some pioneering parents confess, however, to doubts about the wisdom of 
integration. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult and it's scary," said Karen Pekarcik, whose 6-year-old daughter 
with Down's syndrome spent kindergarten in a special education class with eight 
other retarded children in the Pomona School District but moved to a regular 
first-grade class this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always included Molly in everything our family's done," said Pekarcik. 
"But our daughter is mentally retarded; there's no way we can say she's like 
the other kids." 
</P>
<P>
The initial cost of adapting schools to accept handicapped children is high -- 
particularly given the small number of disabled children who benefit from the 
changes and the competing needs faced by financially strapped districts. 
</P>
<P>
But studies show that in the long run it is more cost-efficient to educate all 
handicapped children at regular schools, minimizing costly bus service to 
special programs and the need for a student-teacher ratio that often approaches 
3 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles district recently agreed to build a ramp at an elementary 
school to settle a lawsuit on behalf of a wheelchair-bound 4-year-old who was 
barred from attending her neighborhood school and was to be bused to a school 
three miles away -- one of 40 in the district equipped for wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
But Callison said it would cost the district $1 billion to make all 600 of its 
campuses wheelchair accessible, and millions more to equip the schools with all 
the services severely handicapped students need. The district last year spent 
$490 million of its almost $4-billion budget on special education services, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another stumbling block in California's move toward integration is what to do 
with the special education centers that would no longer be needed. The state 
was a national leader 25 years ago in providing expensive, specially equipped 
schools for its handicapped children. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Los Angeles Board of Education, prodded by complaints that the 
district was not moving quickly enough to integrate all handicapped students, 
appointed a team to study its special education system. Its report is due out 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
But Callison said it is unlikely Los Angeles will attempt to close its special 
education centers or equip all campuses to handle disabled students. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a pendulum (that) swings back and forth," he said. "Stick around for 
a while. You'll find all the school districts . . . that closed their (special 
education) schools are wishing they'd left them open."

The Navy decommissioned the battleship Iowa on Friday, retiring the World War 
II-era ship that became a casualty of Pentagon budget cuts after an April, 
1989, gun turret explosion that killed 47 crewmen. 
</P>
<P>
The Iowa, decommissioned for the third time, is being mothballed six years 
after a $348.7-million renovation returned it to active duty. 
</P>

Thomas Root, the lawyer who was found to have suffered a gunshot wound after 
his airplane crashed in the Atlantic Ocean, pleaded no contest Friday to 364 
counts of securities fraud, conspiracy and related charges. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plea bargain, Root agreed to a 15-year prison term and a $5,000 fine, 
which will be imposed in January. 
</P>
<P>
He agreed also to testify against others indicted in an alleged securities 
scam. 
</P>
<P>
The state dismissed 91 other charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
Root, who faced up to 1,812 years in prison if convicted of all 455 charges, 
called the agreement an "offer so attractive to me that I could not refuse it." 
</P>
<P>
"I continue to suspect that my name was included in the indictment not because 
of my culpability but rather because my notoriety from my ill-fated airplane 
flight in July, 1989, ensured the prosecution of getting plenty of press 
attention for the indictments," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Root, 37, who is a Washington, D.C., lawyer, passed out in the cockpit of his 
single-engine plane during a flight from Washington to Rocky Mount, N.C. The 
plane, which was followed by military planes, eventually crashed in the ocean 
off the coast of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Root was pulled from the ocean after the crash, and rescuers discovered that he 
had been shot in the abdomen. Root has insisted that a pistol he kept in the 
plane discharged during the crash, but experts have questioned his explanation 
of the wound.

5,000 ISOLATED AS BARGE STRIKES HATTERAS ISLAND BRIDGE IN STORM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Near hurricane-strength winds slammed into the North Carolina coast Friday, 
knocking out a bridge to the Outer Banks and leaving 5,000 people isolated on 
Hatteras Island. 
</P>
<P>
The storm, which moved northward with wind gusts of up to 92 m.p.h., prompted 
gale and coastal flood warnings along the state's Outer Banks or coastal 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
Seas were reported running as high as 16 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Wind gusts of 90 m.p.h. ripped a dredge from its moorings, and the vessel 
rammed a bridge that is the only land link between Hatteras Island and the 
mainland, tearing a 300-foot section from the structure. Five thousand people 
were cut off from the mainland, but no injuries were reported, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina officials tried to set up emergency ferry service between the 
mainland and the island. The bridge may be closed for months, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The bridge carries telephone and power lines to Hatteras, and the accident left 
some of those lines dangling over the inlet. Power was out on Hatteras and on 
much of nearby Ocracoke Island, home to more than 500 people. 
</P>
<P>
A Dare County spokeswoman said the county hoped to restore electricity within 
48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard plucked four people from a sinking fishing ship that had 
radioed for help about 20 miles off False Cape, N.C., near the Virginia-North 
Carolina border. 
</P>
<P>
Along the Virginia coast, trees were knocked down and power was out to many 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service reported stiff gusts as far inland as Newport

GORBACHEV ORDERS RUBLE DEVALUED BY 69%; 
</P>

SQUEEZE STATE SUBSIDIES FROM PRICES.

<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, moving Friday to implement his economic 
reforms, ordered devaluation of the Soviet currency, the ruble, by 69% in an 
effort to force the country's industry to become more productive and to begin 
wringing state subsidies out of the price system. 
</P>
<P>
In another major economic decree, Gorbachev authorized foreign companies to 
establish wholly owned subsidiaries in the Soviet Union on an equal footing 
with Soviet enterprises and with the right to reinvest or transfer their 
earnings abroad. 
</P>
<P>
In a third decree, which also lays the foundation for the major changes ahead, 
Gorbachev permitted Soviet banks to increase the interest they pay on long-term 
deposits. The Finance Ministry and the Soviet State Bank immediately raised 
their maximum rates from 3% and 4% to 9% and 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, speaking to a trade union congress, said 
more steps will quickly follow as Gorbachev introduces his long-delayed 
economic reforms, with the aim of building enough momentum to overcome likely 
resistance to the changes. 
</P>
<P>
All three measures were included in the reforms approved in outline last week 
by the Supreme Soviet, the country's legislature, to develop a market economy 
here in place of the old system of state ownership, central planning and 
bureaucratic management. Gorbachev signed them before leaving Friday for a 
visit to Spain. 
</P>
<P>
The ruble's devaluation is effective next Thursday for all commercial 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Although endorsing step-by-step changes, Ryzhkov again argued against moving 
too boldly, too fast. He said the transition cannot be accomplished in 500 
days, as advocated by radicals, but will require five to eight years of hard 
work. 
</P>
<P>
He said price reform, a key element in developing a market economy here, will 
be undertaken gradually. Although virtually all wholesale prices will be 
raised, only 40% will be allowed to respond to market forces of supply and 
demand, he said. At the same time, retail prices on basic consumer goods will 
be maintained next year through state subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
The devaluation of the ruble, which will be worth 56 cents instead of $1.81, is 
aimed at encouraging Soviet enterprises to export more goods and to discourage 
imports by making foreign goods more expensive, Ryzhkov said. 
</P>
<P>
But the measure will also begin the process of rationalizing the Soviet price 
system, essential to fundamental economic reforms, by squeezing out some of the 
subsidies that have long been hidden in the complex system of "coefficients" -- 
in effect, more than 2,000 separate exchange rates, used in financing Soviet 
imports and exports. 
</P>
<P>
According to government estimates, about 90% of Soviet exports will be 
"profitably priced" at the new commercial rate. 
</P>
<P>
The devaluation will be followed in January by more moves to develop a regular 
foreign-exchange market. This is part of the long process of making the ruble a 
convertible currency that can be bought and sold on international markets and 
used to purchase Soviet goods or to invest here. 
</P>
<P>
But even at 56 cents, less than a third of its previous official value, the 
ruble is still badly overpriced. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists can now buy rubles officially for 18 cents each, and black market 
dealers here and banks abroad buy and sell rubles at 5 to 7 cents each. For 
expensive imports, such as videocassette recorders and computers, a ruble is 
often worth no more than 3 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's decree permitting full foreign ownership of enterprises is aimed at 
attracting investment from Western companies, many of which have insisted on 
complete ownership and management control of any subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, foreign companies were forced to form joint ventures with Soviet 
partners, who until recently held at least 51% of the shares, and to make 
barter deals to take out their profits. 
</P>
<P>
The decree does not say how profits can be repatriated, leaving that to later 
legislation. It also stops short of permitting foreign firms to buy land, 
permitting long-term leasing instead. 
</P>
<P>
But it does promise that "foreign investments on Soviet territory enjoy legal 
protection, and their conditions cannot be less favorable than those existing 
for the property of Soviet enterprises, organizations and citizens." 
</P>
<P>
"Profits of foreign investors, obtained in the Soviet Union in Soviet currency, 
can be freely reinvested and used on Soviet territory . . . " according to the 
decree. 
</P>
<P>
Some Western firms offering goods and services for local purchase, such as 
McDonald's, Pizza Hut, Estee Lauder and Benetton, are earning large amounts of 
rubles that, until now, have had to be spent in the Soviet Union. The new 
currency market envisioned by the decree devaluing the ruble may be one way to 
convert local earnings into U.S. dollars, German marks or other hard 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, the devaluation and new rules on foreign investment are likely 
to encourage Western companies to enter the Soviet consumer market, which has 
been woefully undersupplied. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in interest rates is meant to absorb more of the hundreds of 
billions of rubles of personal savings, using it to finance the government's 
huge deficit and reducing inflation by taking it out of the Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
Official estimates put inflation at 8% to 9% a year, but non-government 
economists put it at nearly 80% when black-market prices are taken into 
account.

SOVIET MOLDOVA IMPOSES STATE OF EMERGENCY OVER ETHNIC UNREST 
</P>

<P>
The Parliament of Moldova on Friday imposed a state of emergency in the divided 
Soviet republic's southern region to block attempts by a small ethnic group, 
the Turkic-speaking Gagauzi, to hold elections for their own breakaway state. 
</P>
<P>
As Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev left Moscow on a state visit to Spain, 
official media and residents of Moldova reported a dramatic increase in 
tensions in the largely agricultural land between the Ukraine and Romania, 
officially known as Moldavia until last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency said army paratroopers had been moved to the town of 
Komrat, in the Gagauz area. Moldova's president, Mirca Snegur, accused the 
military of violating a pledge of non-interference that he said he obtained 
from Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov. The units reportedly were 
withdrawn later. 
</P>
<P>
As the Gagauzi, who make up about 3% of Moldova's 4.3 million people, began 
their unsanctioned elections, about 20,000 vigilantes answering calls to 
safeguard Moldova's territorial integrity massed on the borders of the area 
that proclaimed its independence in August, Soviet television said. 
</P>
<P>
The highly charged atmosphere was reminiscent of how other Soviet ethnic 
clashes in the Transcaucasus or Central Asia have begun. Tass, the official 
Soviet news agency, said Gorbachev telephoned Snegur before flying to Madrid to 
warn that "violence and confrontation are impermissible." 
</P>
<P>
To reassert its control over the "Gagauz Republic," but also to forestall any 
bloodshed, Moldova's Parliament met in extraordinary session and declared a 
two-month state of emergency in the Gagauz districts of Vulkaneshty, Komrat and 
Chadyr-Lunga. It also suspended the operations of government councils there. 
</P>
<P>
A provisional committee, headed by First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Sangeli, 
was ordered to enforce the state of emergency in the districts where more than 
150,000 Gagauzi live. 
</P>
<P>
The decree also bans public gatherings and restricts travel in and out of the 
Gagauz area, where polling began Thursday despite a request from Snegur that it 
be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the minority acted after Moldova's Parliament asserted the 
republic's "sovereignty" from the Moscow-based national government in June. The 
Gagauzi, who charge that the nationalistic leadership of Moldova discriminates 
against them, are related ethnically to the Turks. 
</P>
<P>
The Moldovans are related to their Romanian neighbors. Their land was forcibly 
annexed by the Kremlin from Romania in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Gorbachev issued an appeal for calm in Moldova, which has become 
an example of how ethnic divisiveness threatens his attempts to keep the Soviet 
Union together.

2 LEADERS OF FORMER EAST GERMAN COMMUNIST PARTY ARRESTED; 
</P>
<P>
SCANDAL: THEY ARE ACCUSED OF EMBEZZLEMENT IN THE TRANSFER OF $71 MILLION TO 
MOSCOW TO HIDE PARTY RICHES.

Two top officials from the restructured East German Communist Party were 
arrested Friday after admitting they secretly transferred 107 million marks 
($71 million) to Moscow in an attempt to hide party riches from the newly 
united German government. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Pohl, vice chairman and treasurer of the party, now known as the Party 
of Democratic Socialism, admitted his guilt and resigned hours before Berlin 
police arrested him along with party finance director Wolfgang Langnitschke. 
</P>
<P>
Both were accused of embezzlement. 
</P>
<P>
Coming to light just five weeks before national elections in Germany, the 
scandal threatens to destroy the reformist party, which emerged from the ruins 
of the powerful Stalinist regime that ruled East Germany for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The party, which claims about 350,000 members among 12 million German voters in 
the east, represents itself as an opposition voice in united Germany. The 
current, mostly young leadership has attempted to disassociate itself from the 
corrupt regime that was toppled in a bloodless revolution last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Party Chairman Gregor Gysi, who also is a deputy of the Bundestag, or lower 
house of Parliament, was expected to offer his resignation today. 
</P>
<P>
Pohl issued a statement before his arrest saying that his sole motive was "to 
help the party" by protecting funds from possible confiscation by the 
government task force investigating vast property and financial holdings of the 
East German Communists. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately disclosed whether the transfer took place before or 
after the two Germanys merged Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
The usually feisty Gysi was clearly distraught as he faced reporters after the 
embarrassing revelations. 
</P>
<P>
"The transaction was undertaken . . . without the knowledge and without the 
approval of the party presidium and chairman," Gysi said. "We have ruled out 
any motive of personal enrichment on the part of both these comrades." 
</P>
<P>
The scandal was exposed last week when about 80 plainclothes police raided 
party headquarters in Berlin without a search warrant, raising sharp protests 
by the party that it was being politically persecuted. 
</P>
<P>
When authorities announced that the party was under suspicion of embezzling 
millions through a phony Soviet firm and through bank accounts in Norway and 
the Netherlands, Gysi heatedly insisted the transactions were legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
He contended that the funds were transferred to honor a commitment to sponsor 
students in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
After an emergency visit to Moscow on Thursday, Gysi returned to Germany and 
told investigators he had learned otherwise, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The party's holdings, reported last June to be worth 3.1 billion marks ($2 
billion), are under control of a government trustee agency. Officials said the 
law was broken when the party failed to seek permission for the transfer. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Communist Party on Friday denied any knowledge of the German party's 
illegal transactions, according to the Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
Mainstream political rivals were quick to attack the Democratic Socialists, who 
hold a handful of seats in the Bundestag, and had been expected to secure 
enough votes Dec. 2 to win representation in the first elected pan-German 
government since the Third Reich. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Socialists are a party "with a terrible past and a corrupt present 
as well," said Volker Ruehe, general secretary of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 
conservative Christian Democrats.

HUSSEIN READY TO NEGOTIATE, FRENCH TV SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: BUT THE MITTERRAND GOVERNMENT CANNOT CONFIRM THE REPORT. KUWAIT 
REFINERIES ARE WIRED WITH EXPLOSIVES, U.S. SOURCES SAY.

French television said Friday that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has told 
President Francois Mitterrand he is ready to discuss Kuwait, but government 
officials said they could not confirm the report. 
</P>
<P>
And in Washington, Bush Administration sources said the Iraqi invaders have 
wired Kuwait's refineries with explosives so they could be blown up if the 
Iraqis are forced out of the emirate. 
</P>
<P>
The network La Cinq reported in Paris that Hussein sent a letter to Mitterrand 
ahead of the French leader's scheduled talks with Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev in Paris on Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But a Mitterrand aide said he could "find no trace of a letter" from the Iraqi 
leader, whose troops took over Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Ambassador Abdul Razzak Hashimi said he had no comment on the report or 
on the French government reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi president said he hoped Francois Mitterrand and Mikhail Gorbachev 
will spare no effort to find a solution to all the problems of the region, in 
particular the Palestinian problem," the television report said. 
</P>
<P>
"He added that he is open to all ideas, to all comments by Mitterrand and 
Gorbachev on the situation in the region, including the problem of Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
It quoted Saddam Hussein as saying: "You will find Iraq ready henceforth to 
respond positively to the international community to find a just and peaceful 
solution." 
</P>
<P>
It said Hussein had reiterated his "initiative of Aug. 12," which has been 
rejected by the international community. It calls for a global solution to all 
major Middle East problems but fails to promise an Iraqi withdrawal from 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Administration sources said Iraq has wired Kuwait's four oil 
refineries with plastic explosives capable of knocking out the emirate's entire 
refining capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq also has placed explosives at other key Kuwaiti oil installations, 
including pipeline pumping stations, oil-processing centers and oil wells along 
the Persian Gulf, said the sources, who spoke on condition they not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
The moves appear to be part of a "scorched earth" strategy by Hussein to 
devastate Kuwait's economic base in the event his occupying army is forced to 
withdraw by the U.S.-led multinational forces in the region, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq also is removing large quantities of chemicals, pipes, meters and other 
oil-processing and production materials from storage areas in Kuwait for 
apparent use in Iraq, the sources said. There is no evidence, however, that the 
Iraqis are dismantling oil refineries by removing operational parts, the 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the exiled Kuwaiti government have said their country's oil industry 
is being severely damaged by Iraqi forces, but few details had come to light. 
</P>
<P>
One Administration source said U.S. spy satellites had provided photographic 
evidence of Iraqi forces moving Kuwaiti oil industry equipment and materials 
across the border into Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wholesale cannibalizing," said one American oil industry source who 
requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The plastic explosives attached to Kuwait oil facilities would, if detonated, 
knock out all refining capability for at least six months, the sources 
estimated. It would take at least two years to get the facilities back to full 
capacity, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Details about the installation of plastic explosives at refineries and other 
Kuwaiti oil facilities have come from Kuwaitis who escaped into Saudi Arabia 
and from released foreign hostages, the Administration source said.

U.S. CALLS FOR 'GENEROUS' AID FOR JORDAN; 
</P>
<P>
SANCTIONS: AMMAN IS NOW IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE U.N.-IMPOSED EMBARGO 
AGAINST IRAQ, THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS.

<P>
Jordan, once regarded as a massive gap in the trade-sanctions ring around Iraq, 
now is in full compliance with the U.N.-imposed embargo and is entitled to 
"generous" economic aid from the world community, the Bush Administration said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The new assessment is a dramatic reversal of the Administration's earlier 
complaints that Jordan, for years Washington's closest Arab ally, had thrown in 
its lot with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"We now consider Jordanian compliance with sanctions to be good," State 
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. "When we have made our concerns 
known to Jordan, Jordan has addressed them and taken steps to meet them. 
Jordan's economy is being particularly hard hit by this crisis; we believe that 
Jordan's compliance warrants generous support." 
</P>
<P>
Boucher's comments came as Michel Marto, deputy governor of the Central Bank of 
Jordan, was visiting Washington in search of support for his nation's fragile 
economy, which was devastated by the loss of its traditional markets in Iraq 
and Kuwait. The U.N. Security Council imposed the trade embargo shortly after 
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Although Marto conceded that it took some time for the Amman government to wind 
down its commerce with Iraq, he insisted: "We are now 100% . . . adhering to 
the sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
Marto said Administration officials who gave him a chilly reception last month 
now demonstrate an "understanding of our problems." He said he was assured that 
"it is in the interest of the United States to have stability in Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the U.S. endorsement, however, Jordan still faces deep economic 
problems. Congress has approved $35 million in U.S. economic aid. However, 
Saudi Arabia, once the source of massive assistance, is not yet ready to 
forgive Jordan's King Hussein for his diplomatic flirtation with Iraq's 
Hussein. (The two are not related.) 
</P>
<P>
Before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Jordan was exporting 500,000 tons of fruit 
and vegetables -- a substantial share of its total production -- a year to 
Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, Marto said. Moreover, Jordan was receiving about 
$500 million a year in economic aid from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other gulf 
states. After the invasion, that trade and aid ended. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Marto said, before the invasion about 400,000 Jordanians were 
working in Kuwait, most of them sending part of their pay home to extended 
families in Jordan. Today, 150,000 of those workers have returned home in the 
face of rising unemployment. Those who stayed are being paid in Iraqi dinars, 
an unconvertible currency that is virtually worthless outside Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The economy will certainly contract, Marto said. If Jordan gets massive foreign 
aid, the decline will be about 10%. Without such a transfusion, the skid could 
reach 40%, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said the United States will urge other international donors to increase 
their support for Jordan. He noted that the United States is acting as a 
coordinator for donors, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, 
Japan, Germany, the 12-nation European Community and the exiled government of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In response to questions, Boucher said Washington would support a resumption of 
Saudi aid and trade with Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
But Saudi sources said there is little likelihood that the two kingdoms will 
patch up their dispute any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
"The Saudi grievances are a lot bigger than that embargo," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, he noted that the Jordanian government allowed pro-Iraqi 
Jordanians to buy advertisements in Jordanian newspapers while refusing to 
permit pro-Saudi Jordanians to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
King Hussein angered both the U.S. and Saudi governments by touring the Arab 
world in search of an "Arab solution" to the gulf crisis that would not require 
Iraq's total and unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait. Washington and Riyadh 
have ruled out "partial solutions" that would leave Iraq anything to show for 
its aggression. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why Jordan, which has suffered more than any nation except Kuwait from 
the Iraqi invasion, would support measures that would give Saddam Hussein a 
partial victory, Marto said: "We have always been encouraged to negotiate. The 
United States always tells us to negotiate." 
</P>
<P>
Marto confirmed reports that in the early days of the crisis, the Central Bank 
of Jordan accepted a $50-million payment intended for Iraq. But he denied that 
the bank was laundering money for Baghdad. Instead, he said, the money was 
applied to Iraq's debt of more than $300 million to Jordan resulting from loans 
during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War. 
</P>
<P>
"The $50 million has been frozen," he said. "But we took it as payment. They 
(the Iraqis) owe us a lot of money."

An international observer team gave its tentative seal of approval Friday to 
Pakistan's disputed national elections, saying it found no proof of widespread 
ballot rigging or fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has repeatedly charged that the 
military-backed caretaker government used "massive fraud" to crush her populist 
party in Wednesday's parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered "abuse and manipulation" and violence did occur, the team reported, 
including the abduction and arrest of local party officials and the assaulting 
and killing of several candidates and party workers. 
</P>
<P>
But the elections "were generally open, orderly and well-administered," 
according to the 40-member delegation, led by the Washington-based National 
Democratic Institute for International Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The group's verdict was probably Bhutto's best and last hope of challenging the 
legitimacy of her political rivals in the right-wing Islamic Democratic 
Alliance, who appear to be headed for a two-thirds majority in the National 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The observer team said it "saw no evidence on election night" to back Bhutto's 
charges that ballot boxes were switched and polling agents illegally expelled 
from booths, according to a three-page preliminary report. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Wollack, executive director of the National Democratic Institute, said 
ballot tampering on a scale sufficient to cause the anti-Bhutto landslide 
"would be very difficult but not impossible." 
</P>
<P>
"But we do not believe it was (sufficient)," he told reporters at a briefing 
here. 
</P>
<P>
The team's co-leader, former Turkish Foreign Minister Vahit Halefoglu, agreed. 
"This is not enough to alter the balloting or the vote," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gross disparities in local vote margins, compared to the 1988 election that put 
Bhutto in power, appeared suspect because no one, including the winners, had 
predicted the virtual rout of Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party. 
</P>
<P>
The National Democratic Institute will further analyze election returns before 
preparing its final report, especially the returns from former Bhutto 
strongholds in Sind and Punjab provinces, where her opponents won by 
suspiciously lopsided margins. For now, no evidence "substantiates allegations 
concerning irregular vote totals," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Aides said Bhutto was in tears after the unexpected defeat. Her campaign had 
drawn huge, enthusiastic crowds, and she had predicted a strong comeback 
victory 11 weeks after President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed her 20-month-old 
government for alleged corruption and misrule. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Bhutto's confident election day prediction of winning 110 to 120 of the 
217 seats in the Assembly, her party won only 45, losing more than half its 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
Her opponents in the Islamic Democratic Alliance won 105 seats overall. In 
Punjab, which has 63% of Pakistan's people, they won 91 of the 114 seats at 
stake. Bhutto's party won only 14. 
</P>
<P>
Other parties and independents quickly offered support to the winners, giving 
the anti-Bhutto coalition enough strength to amend the constitution and enact 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
The observer team was made up of representatives from 17 countries. They 
visited about 500 polling booths in 30 constituencies on election day, Wollack 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is eager to reach an agreement with the new government on 
curbing Pakistan's nuclear weapons program. Continuing work on the program 
caused the Bush Administration to suspend all economic and military aid to 
Pakistan on Oct. 1, pending the outcome of the elections. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, interim Prime Minister Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi insisted that 
there is no change in Pakistan's nuclear program compared to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the freeze is under review.

Thousands of students, some hurling eggs and others smashing windows, marched 
nationwide Friday in the largest protests in two weeks of strikes over violence 
and overcrowding in French high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Michel Rocard promised to create thousands of new jobs to 
improve crumbling, crime-ridden high schools. 
</P>
<P>
But a student leader said Rocard had failed to address basic demands for more 
teachers and security guards. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are asking for is to have toilets where we can go without being 
hassled by five guys," said one Paris student, a 16-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
After listening to a delegation of student leaders, Rocard issued a statement 
pledging to create 6,000 new slots for teacher assistants and 3,000 monitors. 
He also promised 1,000 new maintenance posts.

DIFFICULTIES COLLECTING ON METZGER SUIT TOLD

Now that Tom Metzger and his white supremacist organization have been ordered 
to pay nearly $9 million for inciting the murder of an Ethiopian student in 
Portland, Ore., the victim's family faces a task that might be even more 
formidable than winning the judgment -- collecting it. 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that Metzger and the White Aryan Resistance -- his organization 
to promote racial hatred -- have $9 million. Metzger lives in a modest 
Fallbrook home worth little more than $100,000, according to estimates. He 
drives two older cars, and from all appearances, his television repair business 
has not made him rich. 
</P>
<P>
But no one knows just how much Metzger and WAR are really worth. The 
organization collected most of its revenue in cash or money orders, and there 
is no telling how much of that money has been spent or stashed away. 
</P>
<P>
State law says that whatever goes uncollected in 20 years will remain beyond 
the grasp of the law. 
</P>
<P>
"For 20 years, Tom Metzger and his son, John, are going to have me or someone 
else following them around with our hands out," said James McElroy, the San 
Diego lawyer who is assisting civil rights attorney Morris Dees in collecting 
the award ordered on Monday by a Portland jury. 
</P>
<P>
"Our top priority is to compensate the family of the decedent. We want to give 
them some money. A side benefit of that is that, if we can shut down Mr. 
Metzger's hate business, he'll no longer be preying on these 15- and 
16-year-old skinheads. He won't be selling hate to them, and reaping the 
rewards from their violent acts," McElroy said. 
</P>
<P>
In what was cast as a major setback to the white supremacist movement, the jury 
awarded $12.5 million to the family of Mulugeta Seraw, a 27-year-old Ethiopian 
immigrant living in Portland who was beaten in the head with a baseball bat 
when he was attacked by skinheads in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The jury found that the two assailants who pleaded guilty in the slaying were 
incited by the Fallbrook-based Metzgers and WAR's racial hate campaign. Tom 
Metzger, 52, was ordered to pay $5 million in punitive damages; his son, John, 
22 -- who heads WAR's youthful skinhead faction -- was ordered to pay $1 
million; WAR was assessed $3 million, and each of the two skinheads was told to 
pay $500,000 each. Each of the five also was ordered to pay 20% of the 
$2.5-million balance, which represented compensatory damages. 
</P>
<P>
Because Metzger's actions were found by the jury to be willful, he cannot file 
bankruptcy to avoid the judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Metzger -- who was not criminally charged in the slaying -- did not return 
telephone calls. But after the jury's verdict last week, Metzger said the 
judgment elevated him as a martyr to white America and that, with nothing else 
to lose, he was free to promote his cause. 
</P>
<P>
So what happens next? 
</P>
<P>
The Portland judgment will be transferred to San Diego Superior Court so it can 
be executed locally. The necessary filing of documents is expected on Monday, 
McElroy said. 
</P>
<P>
Within several weeks, the two Metzgers will be subpoenaed to testify as to 
their assets. Then, with a judge's permission, the San Diego County marshal's 
office could seize personal assets -- ranging from the television business 
equipment, to a trailer used for Metzger rallies, to the cars. They could be in 
authorities' hands within weeks, to be sold at auction. 
</P>
<P>
The Fallbrook house would be appraised and sold at auction. This should happen, 
McElroy said, within "the next several months." However, no matter how much 
money the house fetches, Metzger, under the state's homestead laws, gets to 
keep $45,000. 
</P>
<P>
Next, a judge will determine how much of the income from Metzger's television 
business should go to paying off the judgment. Metzger would be allowed to keep 
some money to support himself and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Getting WAR to pay will be more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Among the possibilities, McElroy said, "is to create a receivership and 
actually take over WAR, and then the receiver would have the key to the box."

N.Y. DAILY NEWS STRIKE TURNS INTO WAR; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: THE EDITORIAL WORKERS' UNION JOINS EIGHT OTHERS IN WALKOUT. VIOLENCE 
FLARES AS THE PAPER CONTINUES TO PUBLISH WITH SUBSTITUTE EMPLOYEES. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The union representing editorial employees at the New York Daily News joined 
eight other unions Friday in striking the financially troubled tabloid, 
creating an all-out labor war that has been marked by violence and threatens 
the paper's survival. 
</P>
<P>
About 800 members of the Newspaper Guild of New York cast their lot with about 
1,800 other striking union members as the Daily News' management began 
importing substitute newsroom workers from newspapers owned by its parent firm, 
the Tribune Co., in Chicago and Orlando, Fla., to help keep the paper going. 
</P>
<P>
The Newspaper Guild had originally planned simply to honor picket lines, 
including the one at the News' headquarters in Manhattan. But management issued 
an ultimatum Friday: "Come in (to work) quickly or you will be considered 
striking and will be replaced," as Daily News spokeswoman Lisa Robinson put it. 
</P>
<P>
With that threat, said local Guild President Barry Lipton, the editorial 
employees decided almost immediately at an afternoon meeting to go on strike 
rather than to work with any "imported scabs and goons." 
</P>
<P>
Daily News executives vowed to continue publishing the paper despite the 
massive walkout, which was precipitated early Thursday by a dispute at the 
paper's Brooklyn printing plant over a worker's right to perform his job while 
sitting down. 
</P>
<P>
By using members of management and replacement workers, the newspaper produced 
611,000 copies of an abbreviated edition on Friday, News spokesmen said. The 
normal daily circulation is almost 1.2 million, the second highest for a U.S. 
metropolitan daily after the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
But distribution of the 48-page single edition -- less than half its normal 
size -- was spotty throughout the city as non-union drivers leaving the paper's 
three separate printing facilities were forced to run gantlets of protesters 
pelting their trucks with bricks, stones, bottles and eggs. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan is to improve performance each day until normal distribution is 
reached," newspaper executives said in a statement. "We have tremendous support 
from city and state police authorities. We are confident that the . . . 
violence by these strikers can be contained." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of both management and labor said that no negotiations between 
the two sides were in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
Several striking employees said they feared an escalation of the violence. "The 
only way the unions can hurt the paper is to thwart it from being delivered," 
said a reporter who asked to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
At least 11 arrests have been made since the strike started, including those of 
two men in connection with the firebombing of a delivery truck. No major 
injuries have been reported, however. 
</P>
<P>
The strike capped a 10-month dispute over management's efforts to gain more 
control over wages and working conditions at the paper. The Daily News has lost 
about $115 million over the last decade and has seen daily circulation slip by 
about 700,000. 
</P>
<P>
But labor leaders contend that management wants to break the unions and was 
determined to provoke a strike to achieve that end. 
</P>
<P>
The unions have been working without a contract since the end of March, and 
negotiations had stalemated. 
</P>
<P>
Theodore W. Kheel, an adviser to the Allied Printing Trades Council, a 
coalition representing all 10 unions at the News, contended that replacement of 
striking workers at the paper effectively forecloses any labor settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if the unions agreed to 100% of what the paper wanted, those people who 
have been replaced could not go back to work, and that would be totally 
unacceptable," he said. "This paper is dead. It's only a matter of time before 
the funeral ceremonies are held." 
</P>
<P>
Only the typographers' union, whose 200 members have lifetime guaranteed jobs, 
is not involved in the strike. 
</P>
<P>
The strike was started by the drivers' union Thursday after a walkout prompted 
by an incident in which a supervisor told a driver to stand as he worked on a 
machine that bundles newspapers. The driver claimed that a leg injury prevented 
him from standing and that the job could be performed as easily while sitting.

7TH CHESS GAME IS ADJOURNED; KARPOV APPEARS TO HAVE EDGE

The seventh game of the world championship chess match was adjourned Friday 
night when challenger Anatoly Karpov wrote down his 44th move and sealed it, to 
be opened when play is resumed today. 
</P>
<P>
Karpov appeared to have a significant advantage over champion Garry Kasparov 
when the game adjourned because he had an extra pawn and observers felt he was 
in a winning position. 
</P>
<P>
Kasparov had entered Game 7 with a 3 1/2-2 1/2 point lead, but, if Karpov wins 
the game, the score in the match will be tied. 
</P>
<P>
Kasparov could agree to concede before play is resumed. 
</P>
<P>
Kasparov's victory in the second game was worth a full point. Each player got 
one-half point for draws in the other games, including a draw for Game 6, which 
both players agreed to Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The first player to reach 12 1/2 points wins the championship. Kasparov, who 
dethroned Karpov in 1985, will retain his title if the match ends in a 12-12 
tie. 
</P>

Here are the moves of Game 7, with Karpov playing white:

BATTLESHIP IOWA MOTHBALLED; VICTIM OF BUDGET, EXPLOSION

The Navy decommissioned the battleship Iowa on Friday, retiring the World War 
II-era ship that became a casualty of Pentagon budget cuts after an April, 
1989, gun turret explosion killed 47 crewmen. 
</P>
<P>
The Iowa, decommissioned for the third time, is being mothballed just six years 
after a $348.7-million renovation returned the ship to active duty. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like burying one of your people," said Dusty Curtis, 67, of Lansing, 
Mich., who served aboard the Iowa from 1943 to 1945. "You wonder what they 
spent all the money for. Now it's going to waste." 
</P>
<P>
Critics have argued that the nation's four remaining battleships were 
strategically outdated and should have remained in mothballs. 
</P>
<P>
The powerful vessel was retired by a reluctant skipper, who addressed hundreds 
of former Iowa crewmen, their families and relatives of those who died in the 
blast during a shipboard ceremony at Norfolk Naval Station. 
</P>
<P>
"As commanding officer, I find this process of inactivation most painful," said 
Cmdr. John P. Morse. "To a man, we are reluctant to give up our ship." 
</P>
<P>
Morse and other officers, speaking under gray skies as wind and rain whipped 
the crowd gathered on the Iowa's wooden deck, said they were optimistic the 
Iowa will return to active duty. 
</P>
<P>
"Iowa will not be scrapped but will continue to stand as a symbol of our 
resolve to keep the 'big stick' available," said Adm. Jerome L. Johnson, vice 
chief of naval operations. "If we need her again, she will be there." 
</P>
<P>
The Iowa is being retired along with the battleship New Jersey, based in Long 
Beach, Calif., which is slated to be taken out of service in February. 
Retirement of the two vessels will leave the United States with two active 
Iowa-class battleships, the Wisconsin and the Missouri.

PANEL OKS PHASE-OUT OF NOISY OLD PLANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
House and Senate negotiators agreed in last-minute discussions Friday to 
require the federal government to phase out flights of noisy older aircraft and 
dampen the racket in the skies over the nation's airports by the turn of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
The accord, expected to receive final congressional approval today, will allow 
Los Angeles International Airport, Orange County's John Wayne Airport and other 
regional airports to retain existing local noise controls and possibly to 
impose new ones. 
</P>
<P>
The conference committee agreement would also allow local airport officials to 
levy a "head tax" of up to $12 per round trip to pay for expansion or 
construction projects. The so-called passenger facility charges are expected to 
generate as much as $1 billion nationally every year for airport improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner hailed the compromise bill, saying 
it "represents the strategic vision this country needs to boost our economy and 
meet consumer demand in the 1990s and into the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
Both the noise policy and the passenger charges were key parts of the 
Administration's legislative agenda, as outlined in Skinner's national 
transportation policy last spring. The compromise agreement, which will be 
folded into the broad federal budget package scheduled for final action today, 
brings to a close a week of talks between Senate and House negotiators on 
legislation to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise, the government will be required to develop a federal 
noise policy that would force out older and noisier "Stage 2" aircraft by Dec. 
31, 1999. About 2,000 of the nation's airplanes are classified as Stage 2, 
which denotes a second-generation plane with engines that are noisier than more 
recently developed Stage 3 planes. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-noise policy would permit the Transportation Department to review -- 
and apparently accept or reject, at its discretion -- future local restrictions 
on Stage 3 aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, regional airport officials have imposed varying restrictions 
governing Stage 2 aircraft noise in their communities. Those local policies 
have become a recent source of irritation between federal and local aviation 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials and airline carriers have said that the "patchwork" of local 
noise policies has made it difficult to manage the national air transit 
network. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise would allow existing noise ordinances at local airports to 
remain in place under a grandfather clause included in the legislation. 
Officials from LAX and John Wayne have lobbied lawmakers not to do away with 
their noise policies. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would also allow local officials to impose new restrictions on 
Stage 2 planes, although it would require them to provide the FAA with 180 days 
advance notice. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would require that the fleets of the nation's carriers must be 
85% Stage 3 planes by July 1, 1999, and 100% by the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
The provision of the legislation authorizing passenger facility charges will 
change existing federal law, which prohibits airport officials from collecting 
a passenger tax to finance local construction projects.

CONFEREES OK BILL REMOVING ALMOST ALL CURBS ON NEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A House-Senate conference committee voted Friday night to accept the House 
version of an appropriations bill for the National Endowment for the Arts that 
removes nearly all restrictions on the content of government-supported art. 
</P>
<P>
The committee agreement on the nearly $12-billion Interior Department 
appropriations bill for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 provides $175 million 
for the endowment. 
</P>
<P>
Also approved was a three-year extension of the life of the arts agency, which 
makes grants to artists and art institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The measure requires the NEA to recoup any grant funds used for art that is 
subsequently held by a criminal appeals court to be obscene, but it drops 
language that banned obscene work and art that the endowment judged to be 
sadomasochistic or homoerotic. 
</P>
<P>
The version adopted by the conference committee appeared to promise to remove 
most of the provisions of the fiscal 1990 legislation that had led to rejection 
of more than two dozen grants by major arts organizations and the filing of 
three lawsuits against the NEA. 
</P>
<P>
The conference committee bill also specifically bans use of a written 
anti-obscenity certification, which NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer had moved 
to require earlier this year. The measure incorporates a House-originated 
provision to increase the share of NEA funding that is channeled to state arts 
councils from 20% this year to as much as 35% by the end of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some good things and some bad things in this," said Liz Robbins, a 
lobbyist for a coalition of writers' organizations fighting pressures from 
conservatives to clamp new restrictions on the NEA. "I think Frohnmayer can 
handle the bad things." 
</P>
<P>
The bill must still be accepted by the full House and Senate. Floor votes are 
expected today.

An emergency operator told a 7-year-old girl to "get off the phone" when the 
child called to report that her brother was being beaten, a newspaper reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Troy and Jane McCants pleaded guilty Thursday to involuntary manslaughter in 
the June death of their 6-year-old son, Antwon Dumas. Records showed that their 
daughter's 911 emergency call was ignored, the Detroit News said. 
</P>
<P>
Jane McCants called for an ambulance five minutes later, according to the tape, 
but the boy was dead when the ambulance arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The Wayne County prosecutor said the operator has been disciplined but would 
not disclose what measures were taken.

Congress approved legislation Friday to give consumers more nutritional 
information about the foods they purchase, sending the bill to President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The House approved the bill setting specific standards for nutrition labels and 
requiring them to be on packaged foods. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, passed by the Senate on Wednesday, also mandates that bulk 
food in bins, raw fish and fruits and vegetables be displayed with a sign or 
brochure providing nutritional information. 
</P>
<P>
Food sold by restaurants, cafeterias, hospitals and grocers with annual sales 
of less than $500,000 is exempt. 
</P>
<P>
Labels would be required to display: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Serving size. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Number of servings per container. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Calories per serving and number of caloriers from fat. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Amount of fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrates, 
complex carbohydrates, sugars, dietary fiber, protein. 
</P>
<P>
The measure requires the Department of Health and Human Services to publish 
draft regulations 12 months after enactment, and final regulation six months 
later.

NEW CLEAN AIR ACT PASSED BY HOUSE AFTER 10 YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: SENATE APPROVAL LIKELY TODAY. BILL IS CALLED THE MOST SIGNIFICANT 
SUCH LEGISLATION OF CENTURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The House set aside long-standing divisions between rival interests and regions 
Friday and passed a new Clean Air Act hailed by its supporters as the most 
significant environmental legislation of the century. 
</P>
<P>
One of the longest and most bitter legislative struggles of the last decade 
appeared near an end as the House voted 401 to 25 to pass the Clean Air Act of 
1990. The Senate, where passage was considered certain, was expected to approve 
the bill today. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a red-letter day that was 10 years in the making," said Daniel Weiss, 
a lobbyist for the Sierra Club. "There is no question that, 10 years from now, 
the air will be cleaner because of this bill." 
</P>
<P>
As its myriad regulations take effect over the next few years, the bill will 
have a major impact on companies and consumers across the country -- and 
nowhere more so than in Southern California, home of the nation's smoggiest 
air. 
</P>
<P>
Although state officials were disappointed that provisions dealing with 
automobile pollution were not tougher, the bill "goes a long way toward giving 
California the federal support it needs" to implement its own strict clean air 
program, said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
"We are passing . . . one of the major environmental bills of this generation," 
said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), echoing Waxman's assessment that 
the 700-page bill constitutes "historic . . . landmark legislation" for the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
The bill divides the nation's dirtiest cities into four categories, according 
to the severity of their smog problems, and sets deadlines ranging from three 
to 20 years to achieve federal clean air standards. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, which has the worst smog in the nation, is the only city given the 
full 20 years to attain the federal standard. 
</P>
<P>
Turn-of-the-century deadlines are established for achievement of the bill's 
other ambitious goals: the virtual elimination of acid rain through a drastic 
reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions by power plants, a 90% reduction in 
cancer-causing toxic chemicals released into the air by a variety of industrial 
sources and a complete phase-out of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons. 
</P>
<P>
For pro-environment lawmakers like Waxman and Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.), final passage represents the culmination of a decade-long 
struggle to enact stronger air pollution laws over the objections of industries 
and lawmakers representing regions where the regulations are expected to have 
adverse economic impact. 
</P>
<P>
The compromises that were finally struck, in thousands of hours of intensive 
negotiations over the last year, succeeded in bridging these differences in a 
way that generally satisfied environmentalists and most industries. 
</P>
<P>
The changes were also considered acceptable by the White House, which 
originally had wanted to hold the cost of the legislation to about $20 billion 
a year. Most estimates indicate the cost of the bill as passed will eventually 
rise to $25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The California Air Resources Board had hoped for tighter deadlines in the 
bill's motor vehicle section and was especially upset by a provision that 
prevents the state from imposing pollution curbs on small construction and farm 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Without those controls, the board has said, vehicles that emit the pollution 
equivalent of 10 million cars will go unregulated. 
</P>
<P>
But Waxman and other lawmakers who sought to protect California's interests in 
the bill argued that it addresses most of the concerns raised by state air 
quality officials. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most important provisions mandates the sale of alternative fuels for 
ultra-clean "low emission vehicles" in California. Production of the vehicles 
will be required under the state smog-control plan approved by the Air 
Resources Board last month. But under pressure from oil companies, the board 
was forced to drop a provision requiring production and marketing of special 
fuels for these vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Another provision primarily benefiting California is a requirement that 
offshore oil rigs and the vessels that service them meet the same stringent 
pollution limits as onshore sources. Sponsored by Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa 
Monica), it also transfers responsibility for enforcing offshore pollution 
regulations from the Interior Department to the Environmental Protection 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
But the most important benefit for California, environmentalists said, is 
indirect. 
</P>
<P>
California already has adopted tight tailpipe emissions standards for 
conventional cars contained in the clean air bill. But they did not apply to 
the one in four cars in California that comes from out of state. By extending 
those standards to the rest of the country, "the bill makes it much easier for 
the state to attain clean air, because it gets the cars that California could 
not control on its own," the Sierra Club's Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
Other requirements, such as a provision mandating the sale of cleaner-burning 
reformulated gasoline in the nation's smoggiest cities, also will help the 
state by getting emissions reductions from older cars already on the road, 
environmentalists said. 
</P>
<P>
Giving Waxman the lion's share of the credit for waging the 10-year battle to 
get a new clean air bill passed, environmentalists erupted into applause as he 
left the House chamber after the vote. "Henry Waxman is the man who made this 
possible," Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), one of Waxman's sparring partners in the 
conference negotiations that produced the final bill, put it slightly 
differently. "Henry is tougher than boiled owl," he said.

CAMPAIGN TRAVEL MADE A RELIC BY TECHNOLOGY; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIA: FEINSTEIN, WILSON WOO VOTERS MOSTLY THROUGH COMMERCIALS, TELEPHONE AND 
FAX. FEW REPORTERS FOLLOW THE CANDIDATES TO EACH AND EVERY STOP.

Two weeks before California was to elect a new governor, the top story on 
Channel 9's nightly news in Los Angeles was about Humphrey the wayward whale. 
Next came stories about a megamouth shark in Orange County and a deformed 
dolphin floundering in the surf off Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? Pete Wilson and Dianne Feinstein did not campaign in public that 
day. If they had, few of the state's political reporters -- for TV or 
newspapers -- would have been there anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The days are over when would-be governors Ronald Reagan and Jerry Brown rode 
small planes and cramped sedans around the state to kiss babies and give stump 
speeches, trailed by packs of reporters who noted the reaction of local folks. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and Feinstein are campaigning for the country's biggest non-federal 
political job mostly by telephone, fax and television commercials. When the 
candidates do venture out to see actual voters, they often stay in the Los 
Angeles area and are accompanied by just a handful of reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The shift of campaign geography to Los Angeles makes sense for the candidates, 
who want to stay near the state's biggest mass of voters. It also plays to the 
desire of editors and TV news producers, who have less money for travel this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
For Wilson and Feinstein, the equation is simple: The easiest way to reach 
California's 13.1 million voters is by television, and more voters live within 
sight of Los Angeles' TV signals than anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than traveling around, the candidates find their time is better spent 
making phone calls to potential donors of the money needed for TV commercials. 
When the candidates desire to make news with a remark or speech, it is more 
productive to do it here in the state's largest TV market than in Redding or 
Chico. 
</P>
<P>
"Chico is a beautiful place, but it is one-half of 1% of the electorate. You do 
an event in Los Angeles and you cover 41% of the electorate," said Dee Dee 
Meyers, spokeswoman for Feinstein's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
As the Nov. 6 election closes in, Feinstein and Wilson will make final trips up 
the state. In fact, Feinstein was in Chico on Friday after all. But, said Otto 
Bos, campaign director for Wilson, "both candidates are going to spend a lot of 
time in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Whether on the road or in Los Angeles, the flock of journalists following 
Wilson and Feinstein has dwindled to a covey. Reporters are staying in the 
office more and writing their stories based on telephone reporting. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, when she was helping Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley campaign for 
governor, Meyers said there were "half-dozen reporters with us everywhere we 
went." But now editors and reporters are being more selective to save money, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Many newspapers and television stations have reduced their travel budgets and 
other expenses as part of an industry-wide financial retrenchment. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the need to save money and keep an eye on the candidates in Los 
Angeles, the Sacramento Bee this year rented an apartment in the Wilshire 
district for its reporters covering the race, said William Endicott, capital 
bureau chief of the Sacramento Bee. 
</P>
<P>
The apartment saves on hotel bills, and the reporters stay over a Saturday 
night to qualify for discount airline tickets or fly home via Oakland because 
there are more special fares to the Bay Area, Endicott said. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Douglas, the political editor of KNBC, Channel 4 in Los Angeles, used to 
be one of the few TV correspondents to travel with candidates, but she says the 
station's cutback in traveling has not detracted from her coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"Once in a while you miss something in the Central Valley," Douglas said. "But 
I have not been agitating to travel. I think we are very well covered." 
</P>
<P>
The main reason, she said, is a satellite that allows network stations such as 
KNBC to swap news footage with their affiliated stations in San Francisco, 
Feinstein's home base, or San Diego, Wilson's hometown. 
</P>
<P>
Both Douglas and Rollin Post, political reporter for KRON-TV in San Francisco, 
said their TV stations are airing as much campaign news as they feel is 
necessary. "I get on as much as I have to, or want to or need to," Post said. 
</P>
<P>
But air time and newspaper space for election coverage has been tighter this 
year, in part because of the financial pinch -- which has reduced the number of 
pages newspapers publish -- and in part because of other major news stories. 
</P>
<P>
The Persian Gulf situation and the budget stalemate in Washington have 
commanded much of the media's attention. The appetite for news of the 
governor's race has also been diluted by the lengthy ballot of initiatives and 
other races. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we're competing with some other things out there," said Bos. "We are 
often not the lead on the evening newscast." 
</P>
<P>
Also, neither Wilson nor Feinstein is seen as having the charisma of Reagan or 
Brown, and public interest in the race seems lower than in past years. Just 68% 
of the eligible adults have registered to vote, the secretary of state said -- 
the lowest share ever in a governor's race. Registration, which used to climb 
for gubernatorial elections, is down about 835,000 voters since the 1988 
presidential election.

3 BALLOT INITIATIVES SEEN ADDING TO FISCAL PROBLEMS; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: EXPERTS SAY APPROVAL OF PROPOSITIONS 128, 129 AND 134 WOULD INCREASE 
STATE COSTS $460 MILLION THE FIRST YEAR, $900 MILLION THE NEXT.

<P>
The state budget, already heading toward a sea of red ink, would take on an 
additional $460 million in costs if three initiatives dealing with the 
environment, law enforcement and the alcohol tax are approved by voters, a 
legislative budget committee learned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Director Jesse R. Huff, in a briefing to the Joint Legislative Budget 
Committee, said the new costs would come from spending requirements contained 
in Proposition 128, the so-called "Big Green" initiative; Proposition 129, a 
drug enforcement and prison bond measure; and Proposition 134, the 
"nickel-a-drink" alcohol tax proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Huff said the cost of the three initiatives would nearly double next year, 
soaring to $900 million. 
</P>
<P>
Although the propositions include increases in taxes or fees to pay for 
mandated programs, the new revenues will not cover all the costs, Huff and 
other experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Various tax increase proposals contained in Proposition 129 have already been 
enacted by the Legislature and the money is being used to finance non-law 
enforcement programs. So support of the programs called for by the law 
enforcement measure would have to come from general purpose tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Proposition 134, the tax increase on alcoholic beverages would 
generate at least $500 million a year in new revenues. But that money is 
earmarked for special programs and cannot be used to support general state 
programs. At the same time, the measure mandates minimum levels of state 
financial support for a wide variety of health and welfare programs, so money 
for those programs would have to come out of general purpose tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Huff complained that initiative sponsors did not focus "on the big picture," or 
the state budget as a whole. "No one has bothered, in thinking of these 
initiatives and drafting them, how that fits into the context of our budget 
situation," Huff said. 
</P>
<P>
Legislative Analyst Elizabeth G. Hill, while falling generally in line with 
Huff's estimates on the cost of the three propositions, told the committee that 
annual interest and principal payments on the 14 bond measures on the ballot 
would be more than $450 million if all are approved. 
</P>
<P>
The money to pay the additional costs during the current year would come from 
the budget reserve -- and in future years from general tax revenues used to 
finance school, human services and law enforcement programs. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian's budget for the 1990-91 fiscal year, which began last 
July 1, anticipated a $1.3-billion reserve. 
</P>
<P>
But in reality the reserve may only be half that and seems to be shrinking 
almost weekly. Tax collections on which the governor based his reserve figure 
were already $138 million less than expected after only three months into the 
fiscal year. And the governor's budget counted on the state ending the last 
fiscal year with $700 million left in the reserve. A preliminary accounting by 
Controller Gray Davis indicated that the balance was closer to zero. 
</P>
<P>
Hill told the committee that the budget problem was not going to get easier 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
She said current expectations are that next year's budget will be at least $1.1 
billion short of what will be needed to cover state services. Hill said: "We 
think these estimates are very conservative. (The gap) could very well grow." 
She said the $1.1-billion estimate did not take into account the effects of the 
crisis in the Persian Gulf, the weakening of the national economy since August 
or ballot measures that may pass in the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Hill also told lawmakers that the various budget problems and a change in the 
California Constitution approved by voters in June have left the state roughly 
$2.7 billion below the state spending limit. As legislators were quick to note, 
that means the Legislature could raise taxes by that amount. 
</P>
<P>
"So, if the chairman wanted to raise taxes, he could, I guess," said Sen. 
Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach). 
</P>
<P>
"The chairman" he referred to is Sen. Alfred E. Alquist (D-San Jose), head of 
the budget committee. Alquist each year carries a major tax bill, but in recent 
years he has been stymied both by the political climate in the Legislature as 
well as the spending limit.

CORPORATIONS PUMP MONEY INTO BALLOT CAMPAIGNS

<P>
With the election only 10 days away, corporate interests fearing higher taxes 
and stricter regulation have poured $45 million into campaigns to defeat 
several ballot measures and to promote proposals of their own to change state 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Reports filed with the secretary of state on Friday show that oil, timber, 
agriculture and alcoholic beverage industries have far outspent the advocates 
of tougher environmental rules and increased liquor taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The industries argue that they are fighting for their lives and that they have 
no choice but to spend vast amounts to protect their interests. 
</P>
<P>
"When the very survival of your industry is at stake, there is no greater 
priority," said David Fogarty, a spokesman for the campaign to defeat 
Proposition 130 and enact its rival measure, Proposition 138. He said forestry 
interests have invested heavily in the effort because the so-called "Forests 
Forever" initiative, Proposition 130, would devastate their businesses and 
destroy their livelihoods. 
</P>
<P>
But those who find themselves battling big industry argue that the companies 
and trade groups are simply trying to protect their own narrow interests and 
that their real aim is to discourage future initiatives that might threaten 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Said Leo McElroy, a media adviser to Proposition 134, the "nickel-a-drink" 
initiative, and other campaigns: "It's an attempt to try to defuse this wave of 
citizen initiative activism. If they can up the ante and manage to defeat a 
number of initiatives, they feel they can cool down this kind of initiative 
fever that's running in California." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the motive, required campaign disclosure reports show that California 
continues to be a battlefield for ballot measures, where the major weapon is 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 20 days of this month, for example, opponents of Proposition 128, 
the so-called "Big Green" environmental initiative, collected $4.2 million -- 
more than $200,000 a day in contributions. That included $270,000 from Chevron 
USA, which has now contributed $800,000 to defeat the measure. The total 
contributions in the effort to defeat the measure now total more than $9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the groups supporting the sweeping environmental initiative raised 
$1.2 million in the Oct. 1-20 reporting period. 
</P>
<P>
As the Nov. 6 election approaches, most of the money spent in the various 
initiative campaigns will be used in a massive onslaught of television 
advertising likely to leave viewers baffled over what interests are paying for 
the ads and confused over the real purposes of the ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
The records show, for example, that liquor and tobacco interests are 
contributing heavily to Proposition 136, a measure that would virtually 
immunize the two industries from increases in the special excise taxes on their 
products. If the measure passes, such tax increases would require a two-thirds 
vote of the people and could be no higher than 1% of the value of the item. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative would also wipe out a steep "nickel-a-drink" tax increase 
contained in another measure on the ballot, Proposition 134. 
</P>
<P>
During the Oct. 1-20 reporting period, the liquor and tobacco companies and 
trade groups raised almost $3 million seeking to pass Proposition 136 -- 
bringing the total collected for the year to $7.7 million. The largest single 
contribution reported was $1 million from the Beer Institute in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Because television and radio commercials promoting Proposition 136 do not 
identify the liquor industry as the major source of the measure's funds, 
opponents charge that advertising and the measure itself are fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
"The Proposition 136 campaign is hiding the fact that their funding comes from 
the liquor industry," said Lenny Goldberg, director of the opposition campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The liquor industry has also led a campaign that has raised $10.2 million 
through Oct. 20 in an effort to defeat the nickel-a-drink initiative, campaign 
reports show. 
</P>
<P>
In the battle of initiatives, the timber industry has raised more than $10 
million in its effort to defeat Proposition 130, a forest protection measure, 
and to promote its own less stringent counter-initiative, Proposition 138. 
Among the biggest contributors to the timber industry campaign fund is industry 
giant Louisiana-Pacific Corp. with $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of Proposition 130 have been able to raise more than $4 million this 
month alone, almost all of it from two wealthy contributors -- investor Harold 
Arbit and Disney Co. President Frank Wells. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers and food industry groups paid $4.8 million into the campaign to pass 
Proposition 135, a measure intended to offset highly restrictive new 
regulations on pesticides contained in the "Big Green" initiative. Among the 
largest contributors were Philip Morris USA, a conglomerate that has alcoholic 
beverages and tobacco holdings and that has spent $210,000 on the campaign so 
far. Nicotine, a byproduct of tobacco, is a widely used pesticide that would be 
banned by "Big Green." The California Farm Bureau Federation has contributed 
even more, $285,000. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, special-interest contributions were also reported going into 
campaigns to defeat the two term-limit measures on the ballot, Propositions 131 
and 140. Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and Senate President 
Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) have raised more than $2.7 million to 
fight the two initiatives. Most of that money has come from businesses and 
professional groups with an interest in matters before the Legislature.

<P>
The races for state attorney general and treasurer are neck-and-neck and appear 
to be going down to the wire on Election Day, but incumbents in three other 
statewide contests are running comfortably ahead, the Los Angeles Times Poll 
has found. 
</P>
<P>
In another race, for the new elective office of state insurance commissioner, 
the Democratic nominee is holding a respectable lead. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a lot of fuzziness in voters' minds about these contests. Roughly 
four in 10 people still have not decided whom to vote for. 
</P>
<P>
In the tight races for attorney general and treasurer, Democrats outnumber 
Republicans among the undecided by 4 to 3. This presumably represents a 
potential boost for the Democratic candidates. There is no similar party 
advantage among undecided voters in the other contests. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the standings in these races have not changed significantly since 
August, various Times surveys have shown. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest survey, the Times poll interviewed 1,941 registered voters by 
telephone over six days ending last Wednesday night. The margin of error is 3 
percentage points in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
This is what the poll found, by contest: 
</P>
<P>
Treasurer: Kathleen Brown (D) 28%, incumbent Thomas W. Hayes (R) 28%, "some 
other candidate" 1%, undecided 43%. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, the sister and daughter of two former governors -- Edmund G. (Jerry) 
Brown Jr. and Edmund G. (Pat) Brown -- does not appear to be benefiting from 
any "gender gap." Women are supporting her by 7 points over Hayes, but men are 
backing the male incumbent by 6 points. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Brown's slight edge among women could result from party choice as 
well as gender bias, since women register significantly more as Democrats than 
they do as Republicans. Men split about evenly between the two parties. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats are supporting Brown by 4 to 1, while Republicans are backing Hayes 
by 6 to 1. Independents are divided about evenly. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who once was an elected member of the Los Angeles Board of Education, is 
leading in Los Angeles County by 3 to 2. But Hayes, appointed treasurer by Gov. 
George Deukmejian to fill a vacancy, is ahead in the rest of Southern 
California, and 2 to 1 in Orange County. The candidates are virtually tied in 
the San Francisco Bay Area and the rest of Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks are supporting Brown by 8 to 1. So are Latinos, by 3 to 2. Anglos lean a 
bit toward Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
Union members prefer Brown by 3 to 2; management people Hayes by 3 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney General: Daniel E. Lungren (R) 29%, San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo 
Smith (D) 28%, "another candidate" 1%, undecided 42%. 
</P>
<P>
Although both candidates support the death penalty, the Republican is preferred 
4 to 3 by people who favor capital punishment. And supporters of the death 
penalty make up three-fourths of the electorate. The one-fifth of voters who 
oppose the death penalty overwhelmingly support Smith, by 3 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans are backing attorney Lungren, a former congressman from Long Beach, 
by 6 to 1. Democrats support Smith by 4 to 1. Independents are split about 
evenly. 
</P>
<P>
In this race, Lungren could benefit slightly from a low turnout on Election 
Day. Traditionally, Republicans are more apt to cast ballots than Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is ahead by 3 to 2 in his home San Francisco Bay Area, but the candidates 
are tied in the rest of Northern California and Los Angeles County. Lungren is 
leading by 3 to 2 in the remainder of Southern California, and almost 2 to 1 in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is being supported 7 to 1 by blacks and 3 to 2 by Latinos. Union members 
back him 3 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant Governor: Incumbent Leo McCarthy (D) 37%, state Sen. Marian Bergeson 
(R) 20%, "another candidate" 1%, undecided 42%. 
</P>
<P>
In this contest, women voters strongly favor the male candidate, by 2 to 1. Men 
back him by less, 3 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
In large part, this substantial female bias for McCarthy could be because women 
lean more toward the Democratic Party than the GOP. Democrats back McCarthy by 
8 to 1. Independents support him by 3 to 1. Republicans support Bergeson by 5 
to 2. 
</P>
<P>
But Bergeson's anti-abortion stand also may have hurt her among women. Voters 
who believe that "the decision to have an abortion is a choice that must be 
made only by the woman herself" -- and they make up 80% of the California 
electorate -- support McCarthy by 2 to 1. The small percentage (12%) who say 
that "the government has a legitimate right to regulate abortion" are divided 
about equally between the two candidates. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy, a former state assemblyman from San Francisco, leads by nearly 4 to 1 
in the San Francisco Bay Area and 2 to 1 in the rest of Northern California. 
The Democratic incumbent holds a 5 to 2 lead in Los Angeles County. But the 
candidates are running even in most of the rest of Southern California. In 
Bergeson's home of Orange County, she is slightly ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance Commissioner: State Sen. John Garamendi (D) 33%, Wes Bannister (R) 
20%, "another candidate" 1%, undecided 46%. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi, a legislator from the Sacramento River Delta who has run 
unsuccessfully for statewide office, is leading by 2 to 1 in Northern 
California and 3 to 2 in Southern California. Bannister, an Orange County 
insurance agent, is running even with the Democrat in his home county, but 
trailing 5 to 2 in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats support Garamendi by 7 to 1; Republicans back Bannister by 5 to 2. 
Independents are split. 
</P>
<P>
Union members back Garamendi by 5 to 2, but management people are about evenly 
divided. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State: Incumbent March Fong Eu (D) 44%, Los Angeles Councilwoman 
Joan Milke Flores 20%, "another candidate" 1%, undecided 35%. 
</P>
<P>
This is a rare statewide contest in which both major candidates are women. And 
women voters are backing the veteran, three-term Democratic incumbent by 5 to 
2. Men also support her by 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Eu is being supported by Democrats 7 to 1 and independents 5 to 2. Flores is 
narrowly backed by Republicans, 4 to 3. 
</P>
<P>
Eu also is favored by blacks 10 to 1 and by Latinos and Anglos 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbent leads 2 to 1 in Los Angeles County, 3 to 2 in the rest of 
Southern California, 4 to 1 in the San Francisco Bay Area, where she once was a 
legislator, and 3 to 1 in the remainder of the North. 
</P>
<P>
Controller: Incumbent Gray Davis (D) 42%, Matt Fong (R) 19%, "another 
candidate" 1%, undecided 38%. 
</P>
<P>
Davis leads among Democrats 8 to 1 and independents 5 to 2. Fong, son of the 
Democratic secretary of state, is favored by Republicans 5 to 3. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic incumbent is backed by Anglos 2 to 1, Latinos nearly 4 to 1 and 
blacks 12 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Regionally around the state, Davis lopsidedly leads Fong, a Los Angeles 
attorney, by ratios of at least 5 to 3. 
</P>

RICK DU BROW: BIG THREE PLOT STRATEGY FOR NOVEMBER RATINGS SWEEPS;

PAPER-THIN LINEUP.

A Los Angeles earthquake. Teen sex on "The Cosby Show." Stephen King's 
nightmare miniseries, "It." And Laura Palmer's killer, revealed at last. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to TV's November ratings sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
It begins Thursday. And rarely will viewers have a better chance to understand 
the Big Three networks -- their strengths and weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
A classic education in TV strategy, the match-up offers a textbook example of 
powerful NBC at work -- from the four-hour miniseries "The Big One: The Great 
Los Angeles Earthquake" to shrewdly conceived special episodes of regular 
programming, from "Cheers" to "The Cosby Show" to "Quantum Leap." 
</P>
<P>
At the opposite pole is ABC, which will offer "It," King's four-hour fright 
show -- but, with an extraordinary degree of confidence, is sticking almost 
exclusively with its regular series as it stalks NBC for the top position. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is suddenly deflated CBS, in mourning over the huge sums it lost 
because of its brief World Series, and badly exposed by a paper-thin November 
lineup that depends heavily on such widely seen motion pictures as "Fatal 
Attraction" and "Moonstruck." 
</P>
<P>
Some viewers may get a kick out of watching CBS Entertainment President Jeff 
Sagansky help out one of his sitcoms when he appears Nov. 8 in "Doctor, 
Doctor." But that's strictly for Hollywood. They won't care in Peoria. 
</P>
<P>
Barring a surprise, CBS could well be finished for the season by the end of the 
sweeps. Among its publicized highlights, for instance, are the season premiere 
of "Dallas" on Friday -- with daytime soap star Susan Lucci appearing -- and 
Burt Reynolds shaving his mustache on his "Evening Shade" sitcom the same 
night. Things can't get much more desperate. 
</P>
<P>
From the opening moment of the monthlong Nielsen ratings sweeps, NBC is aiming 
to simply blow away the competition. Thursday, as it happens, is NBC's 
strongest night, and it will lead off the sweeps with a special one-hour "Cosby 
Show" about teen sex, demurely entitled "Just Thinking About It." 
</P>
<P>
In the episode, a young woman who is a cousin of obstetrician Cliff Huxtable, 
the Cosby character, turns to him for a prescription for birth-control pills 
when she is under pressure to prove her affection for her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
With this hour, NBC clearly hopes to take immediate and overpowering control of 
the sweeps and demolish such competition as Fox TV's "The Simpsons." 
</P>
<P>
It is notable that NBC's "The Big One" and ABC's "It" are both relatively brief 
miniseries, and that such past, long-form ventures as "Lonesome Dove" and "War 
and Remembrance" are simply too expensive for today's soft national economy. 
</P>
<P>
All three networks are under terrific pressure from the new TV competition. And 
the advertising slump that has affected virtually all media has made them 
tighten their belts even more. 
</P>
<P>
CBS was really devastated by Cincinnati's four-game blowout of Oakland in the 
World Series. Analysts figure that the hard-pressed network, which may have 
lost $100 million on baseball this year, could have sharply reduced that 
deficit with the income from the remaining three contests. 
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, Reynolds' mustache doesn't seem too significant a 
cure. 
</P>
<P>
CBS does, however, have a Nov. 12 special, "The Honeymooners Anniversary 
Special," with Art Carney and Audrey Meadows reminiscing about the great series 
that starred the late Jackie Gleason. And the network clearly hopes it will 
emulate the extraordinary ratings success of last season's special about "I 
Love Lucy." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the "Honeymooners" special has been scheduled against the final 
hour of NBC's "The Big One," which will be seen Nov. 11 and 12. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's strategy of just driving ahead with its week-in, week-out series will be 
interrupted significantly only a few times. "It," which concerns seven old 
friends who reunite in their hometown to confront an evil force they thought 
they had destroyed 30 years earlier, will be broadcast Nov. 18 and 20. The 
notable cast includes Harry Anderson, John Ritter, Tim Curry, Richard Masur, 
Annette O'Toole and Tim Reid. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 10, meanwhile, ABC's "Twin Peaks" promises yet again -- if anyone still 
cares -- that the solution of Laura Palmer's murder is upon us. "The identify 
of Laura Palmer's killer is finally revealed," says a network announcement. 
</P>
<P>
But if "Twin Peaks" doesn't really deliver the goods this time, it could well 
alienate many of its fans -- even those who long ago stopped really being 
concerned with the solution and simply enjoy the exotic atmosphere of the 
series. 
</P>
<P>
ABC also has one other intriguing special during the sweeps -- "Call Me Anna," 
a Nov. 11 production starring Patty Duke in a dramatization of her 
autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
But almost as intriguing as ABC's sweeps philosophy is its shrewd cash-register 
thinking as a corporation. One of the reasons it is sticking faithfully with 
its series, with few changes expected before year's end, is that any move of a 
show enables an advertiser to pull out. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, for instance, if "China Beach," now sold out on Saturdays despite low 
ratings, switched places with "Cop Rock," which is seen on Wednesdays, it could 
cause ABC to suffer a multimillion-dollar loss. 
</P>
<P>
Patience has turned out to be a virtue for ABC as second-year series such as 
"Doogie Howser, M.D.," "Life Goes On" and "The Young Riders" have gotten 
stronger. 
</P>
<P>
Who would have thought, for instance, that "Life Goes On," a drama involving a 
young man with Down's syndrome, would beat out a high-spirited NBC musical 
about teen-agers, "Hull High," which was bumped from the schedule this week? 
</P>
<P>
Still, NBC is where most of TV's muscular moves will be noticeable during the 
sweeps, which help set ad prices for local stations. Though struggling in 
recent years as a creative force, NBC is an often-irresistible company simply 
because of its sense of showmanship under Brandon Tartikoff, an astonishingly 
buoyant, Barnum-like impresario. 
</P>
<P>
Consider some of the special events NBC has created out of its regular series 
during the sweeps. The 200th episode of "Cheers," TV's highest-rated series, 
will be commemorated with an hour show Nov. 8. And then the 200th episode will 
be broadcast Nov. 15 -- which is getting a lot of mileage out of one program. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Scott Bakula, the time-traveling, character-changing hero of 
"Quantum Leap," will be transformed into a 1958 female beauty pageant 
contestant in next Friday's show. And then he will be thrust into the Watts 
riots on Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
"The Big One" is described as "what could happen when a seismologist has reason 
to believe a cataclysmic earthquake will hit Los Angeles in a few days' time." 
The cast includes Joanna Kerns and Ed Begley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 5, NBC offers "On Thin Ice: The Tai Babilonia Story," about the 
champion skater. On Nov. 19, the network presents Mary Tyler Moore and Tony 
Curtis in "Thanksgiving Day," a black comedy about how a quirky family copes 
after the father drops dead at the holiday dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's NBC's promotable 100th episode of "Matlock" Nov. 6. And NBC gets 
the most out of Robert Stack on Nov. 7 when he follows his hit show "Unsolved 
Mysteries" with a guest shot immediately afterward on "The Fanelli Boys." 
</P>
<P>
Fast ball. Curve. Slider. 
</P>
<P>
It's the sweeps.

POP BEAT: REVOLUTIONARY CZECH BAND PULNOC TO MAKE L.A. DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
Saturday will be a post-Red-letter day for Eastern Bloc rock-watchers in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
After enduring a seemingly endless stream of corporate-rock wanna-bes and 
preciously dissonant dissidents, they'll get to see Czechoslovakia's Pulnoc -- 
perhaps the one truly great band from Eastern Europe -- finally make its 
Southern California concert debut at Al's Bar downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Pulnoc (pronounced POOL-notes and meaning midnight) was founded by three former 
members of the Plastic People of the Universe, the most celebrated Eastern Bloc 
underground band of the '70s. But even those familiar with the Plastic People 
were unprepared for the musical sophistication and power Pulnoc showed during a 
brief U.S. tour in the spring of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
A show at San Francisco's Kennel Club revealed the septet as a bold musical 
entity, combining monolithic riffing (part art-rock, part Velvet Underground) 
and the operatic vocals of young Michaela (Misha) Nemcova. Village Voice critic 
Robert Christgau went so far as to name a bootleg tape of a Pulnoc show in New 
York show as the best album of 1989. But Pulnoc was unable to arrange an Los 
Angeles date then. 
</P>
<P>
A lot has happened in the meantime, not the least of which was the November 
revolution in Czechoslovakia that gave Pulnoc founder Milan (Mejla) Hlavsa 
artistic freedom for the first time in his 20-year rock career and elevated his 
longtime associate, playwright Vaclav Havel, to the country's presidency. 
</P>
<P>
But fans need not fear that the new Czech politics have diluted Pulnoc's music. 
</P>
<P>
"The revolution didn't influence us at all," Hlavsa, 39, said through a 
translator by phone from San Francisco, where Pulnoc opened a short U.S. tour 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We just go on making music," he said. "The only thing now is we don't have to 
be afraid that there should be problems after concerts. Secret policemen used 
to come to the shows. These problems are over now." 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of post-revolution living for Hlavsa, as much as seeing his 
friend become president, was getting a chance to meet and perform with his 
idol, Lou Reed. Reed was in Prague to interview Havel for Rolling Stone 
magazine and joined Pulnoc in performance at a small art gallery. Later, Pulnoc 
was the opening act for a one-time reunion of Reed's Velvet Underground in 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"That was like a dream come true," Hlavsa said of the Prague concert with Reed. 
"He was surprised we knew all the Velvet Underground songs. Whatever song he 
chose, we knew it." 
</P>
<P>
Hlavsa, a leader in the long struggle for artistic freedom, has looked on as 
other bands have tried to capitalize on the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"Many groups and artists who didn't do anything before the revolution to fight 
for freedom are now trying to present it like they were fighters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We never wanted to be political," he said. "But our existence was at times." 
</P>
<P>
Hlavsa remains in contact with Havel, who he said has come to see Pulnoc more 
often since becoming president than he did before, but Hlavsa has no desire to 
serve in the government with him. "Maybe if Havel would make a rock 'n' roll 
(office) I would do it," he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Hlavsa has little interest in taking on the pressures of stardom. For 
now, he is content playing regularly but still makes his living as he has since 
before the revolution, manufacturing plastic bags at home. 
</P>
<P>
"We prefer not to be professional musicians," he said. "It would influence our 
music in a bad way. We would have to play too often and we are afraid the music 
wouldn't be so good and we wouldn't enjoy it as much." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Pulnoc is looking for a U.S. record deal and hopes to have an album 
recorded within six months. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot say I wouldn't like (having success here), of course," he said. "But 
we don't try to do that. We care more about artistic considerations than 
financial." 
</P>
<P>
So far, though, the band's experience in the United States -- two small-club 
tours on shoestring budgets -- has not made a great impression. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't like to come back home as a good, well-trained homeless person," he 
said, half-jokingly.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: WHY ROSE BOWED OUT TWO MONTHS AFTER SHOW'S START; 
</P>
<P>
NEWS: THE VETERAN ANCHOR SOUGHT TO REACH A NEW AUDIENCE WITH 'PERSONALITIES.' 
HE DIDN'T. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He's interviewed world leaders, entertainers, literary figures, Nobel Prize 
winners, athletes and politicians, getting rave reviews for his work. When it 
comes to asking questions and eliciting information, one on one, the man is 
tops, the cream, a pro's pro. 
</P>
<P>
So . . . . 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of his quitting as anchor of "Personalities" -- less than two 
months after the debut of this syndicated series, which he had dubbed "solid, 
compelling nonfiction television" -- what would Charlie Rose ask Charlie Rose? 
</P>
<P>
A pause. But only a short one, for the 48-year-old Rose didn't spend nearly six 
years conducting blue-ribbon interviews on CBS' "Nightwatch" without learning 
how to give answers too. 
</P>
<P>
He replied: "I'd ask me, 'What went wrong, why did you do that show 
('Personalities') in the first place and was it hard to give up all that money 
(Rose says his contract paid him $500,000 annually) to be true to yourself?' " 
</P>
<P>
And? "It was a chance to do something different and, yes, it was hard giving up 
the money. I don't have to sell my car tomorrow, but I can't go two years 
without working, either, and I have no options." 
</P>
<P>
As for why Rose abandoned the classy wee-hours "Nightwatch" for a series that 
echoes the style, resonance and shrill shallowness of tabloid TV? Flashback. 
</P>
<P>
"Did I really say this was 'solid, compelling nonfiction television?' " Rose 
asked. Actually, the entire quote, attributed to Rose in a press release for 
the Twentieth Television series, was as follows: "This is solid, compelling 
nonfiction television, a broadcast with the right mission whose time has come. 
The quality of our research and the nature of our storytelling enables us to 
bring the world's most interesting people to life." 
</P>
<P>
Another pause from Rose. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, that was clearly written before we started. I believed that at the time, 
and that's why I came here (from Washington). I viewed this as an opportunity 
to reach a different audience with a daily magazine show that would take a 
small amount of time and be not about issues or analysis but about people who 
make news, influence our life, attract our curiousity, entertain us, all of 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at Time or Vanity Fair, the focus is about people -- Saddam 
Hussein, George Bush, Jim Bakker, Rupert Murdoch, Evander Holyfield and all of 
those people. That's what I wanted the broadcast to be. But we ended up with 
too many stories, samples of everything and meals of nothing, once over lightly 
and little new." 
</P>
<P>
It's the comings and goings of the rich and famous -- in large part 
entertainment celebrities -- that preoccupy "Personalities." Janet Zappala 
"tells all" from her gossipy Update Desk, and the tape segments themselves 
generally fill space with fluff. 
</P>
<P>
An excerpt from Zappala's narration of a profile on supporting player Jim 
Carrey of Fox's "In Living Color" reflects the level of reporting: "Jim is 
right at home in 'In Living Color' and admits he's loving every minute of it." 
Yes, and a good time is had by all. 
</P>
<P>
"Personalities" is an extension of the tabloiding of TV. Airing locally at 7 
p.m. weekdays on KTTV Channel 11, it comfortably dissolves into the show that 
follows it, "A Current Affair," which is largely indistinguishable from "Hard 
Copy," which looks a lot like "Inside Edition," which in many respects 
resembles "Entertainment Tonight," whose elements are cloned by local newscasts 
and also by "Personalities." 
</P>
<P>
All of this is what Rose calls the "MTV instinct": Sound bite, clip, sound 
bite, clip, sound bite, clip. A music track to hype emotion. A pace tailored to 
a 3-year-old's attention span. 
</P>
<P>
On "Nightwatch," his interviews averaged 20 minutes and sometimes went to an 
hour. Although he believes that every "Personalities" episode should contain a 
"defining" piece of up to 10 minutes, his longest "Personalities" interview -- 
with "In Living Color" creator Keenan Ivory Wayans -- went only 7 1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to Walter Cronkite for 25 or 30 minutes, and the show cut it to 3 1/2 
minutes. I talked to Steven Bochco (co-creator of 'L.A. Law' and 'Cop Rock') 
and they cut it to 6 minutes. I talked to Grant Tinker (former NBC chairman and 
now head of GTG Entertainment, which produces 'WIOU') for a long time, and it 
ended up being 3 1/2 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, tabloid TV didn't invent sound-bite journalism, witness the 
obsession with brevity on traditional newscasts and the network morning 
programs. "I don't think we respect the concentration threshold of the 
audience," Rose said. "Everybody is obsessed with being fast-paced, but 
fast-paced can come within the body of a piece too." 
</P>
<P>
Rose said that he repeatedly lobbied for change with executive producer Joel 
Cheatwood and senior producer Mark Toney. "I wrote memoranda. I talked to them, 
and they listened. But they look at the numbers ('Personalities' ranks 63rd out 
of 152 syndicated shows in the Nielsen ratings). They said to me that people 
want to know about the rich and the famous and Madonna, and I agree that they 
do. I'm not saying the producers are wrong. They are a couple of hard-working, 
decent guys who are going to do what they think is right. But that's not what I 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, but wasn't Charlie wearing rose-colored glasses when he went into this 
venture? Before "Personalities," after all, Cheatwood had been executive 
producer of the now defunct "Inside Report," the tawdriest tabloid of them all. 
</P>
<P>
Rose said that he had not been aware of that, and pleads guilty to naivete. 
"Maybe I'm to blame. I've never seen 'Inside Report.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rose, who will be replaced by Bill Sternoff, said that his worst moment at 
"Personalities" came when it did a story that also was headlined that day by 
the trashy Star and National Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
His proudest moment on the show? This time he paused for a very long time 
before replying. "I think when I realized I was gonna give it up." 
</P>
<P>
And a good time was not had by all.

FALL SHOWS ABOUT KIDS, FOR KIDS AND STARRING KIDS HAVEN'T NECESSARILY ATTRACTED

Network programmers had high hopes for high ratings for high school programming 
when the TV season began last month. So far, however, the four new campus 
entries are all receiving failing marks from viewers -- and not much better 
from some educators. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, one of them -- NBC's musical "Hull High" -- was canceled this week 
after drawing paltry ratings that left it ranked 86th among 90 prime-time 
series that have aired on the four networks this season. Two others -- Fox's 
drama "Beverly Hills, 90210" and its comedy "Parker Lewis Can't Lose" -- are 
only a couple of notches higher. "Ferris Bueller," NBC's version of the film 
comedy about a high school boy who knows all the angles, ranks 50th in the 
Nielsen season averages, a passing grade only when based on a curve. 
</P>
<P>
Call it Remedial Programming 101. 
</P>
<P>
"Awful" is the way Carole Rosen-Kaplan, an English teacher at Birmingham High 
School in Van Nuys, sums up the shows. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just sex-ploitation for kids, and that's wrong," she said. "They do it in 
films and that's bad, but these are TV shows. It's hard enough being a high 
school kid today, and to present shows like these is inexcusable." 
</P>
<P>
"They make students all look like bubble heads," said Mike Morrill, who teaches 
English and Humanities at Roosevelt High in Boyle Heights. "I teach remedial 
and I teach gifted kids, and (they have) more values than reflected here. 
Overall, I don't think there were people in touch with education involved in 
these shows." 
</P>
<P>
Network executives thought they had stumbled upon the first great programming 
trend of the decade when they developed these shows, hoping they could attract 
a demographically desirable young audience while at the same time not 
alienating older viewers. 
</P>
<P>
The continuing success of ABC's "Head of the Class," now in its fifth season, 
and the more recent ratings rise enjoyed by "The Wonder Years," though about 
the junior high years, were no doubt motivating factors for the onslaught of 
school-oriented shows. 
</P>
<P>
Another impetus, executives say, was the belief that to lure the video 
generation back to the networks, TV must appeal to them on their level. 
</P>
<P>
"Youth is an important audience to cultivate, and high school is a great arena 
in which to appeal to that audience," said Paul Stupin, the Fox network's 
executive vice president of series programming. "There is something universal 
about the high school experience, and no matter how old you are, you can still 
appreciate what it's like to go through it, and where you were at the time." 
</P>
<P>
And although the evidence seems clear that shows about kids, for kids and 
starring kids don't necessarily attract kids, the networks haven't given up on 
the concept. Fox already has picked up "Parker Lewis" for the full season, and 
even NBC, in canceling "Hull High," blamed its failure on the musical elements. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that the music and production numbers in 'Hull High' were beautifully 
executed under Kenny Ortega," said Perry Simon, executive vice president for 
prime-time programs at NBC, "but apparently the experiences of both 'Hull High' 
and 'Cop Rock' (which is getting low ratings on ABC) indicate there's not much 
of an appetite for large-scale music production numbers in the context of a 
one-hour show. In the future, we will be less inclined to do big, full-blown 
musical production numbers, but will find ways to integrate music in a more 
organic fashion." 
</P>
<P>
If the networks are learning that shows about kids, for kids and starring kids 
don't necessarily attract kids, they probably should have known it already, 
given the track record of high school shows during the last decade. There's 
only been one success, ABC's "Head of the Class," since the days of "The White 
Shadow" and "Welcome Back, Kotter," and a notable list of failures including 
"Square Pegs," "Bronx Zoo," "TV 101" and "Fast Times at Ridgemont High." 
</P>
<P>
But, armed with loads of research, executives thought that by presenting shows 
in a fresh manner, they could attract the MTV generation. Lose the soap box 
that characterized many of those past efforts, research said, and the networks 
could find the alienated youth. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids don't like to be told lessons on TV," "Hull High" executive producer Gil 
Grant had said before his show got the ax this week. "Kids today are used to 
seeing the real deal with MTV, and they're not going to settle for a television 
version or a middle-aged adult version of what high school used to be." 
</P>
<P>
That's why most of the high school shows are decidedly lighthearted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a comedy -- a teen-age fantasy with adult sensibilities -- and not to be 
taken as anything more than that," said John Masius, executive producer of 
"Ferris Bueller." "The show is not mean-spirited; Ferris cares about his 
friends, his family, and I think there are different ways to have role models. 
He is a good person and he's honest -- he doesn't take life that seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Philips, executive producer of "Parker Lewis," sees his show the same 
way. "We acknowledge and embrace the opportunity to inform them (young 
viewers), but you can't moralize or preach because that's not entertainment," 
he said. "We will deal with more serious issues, but first we have to win the 
trust of our audience -- we want people to laugh and be entertained." 
</P>
<P>
Only "Beverly Hills, 90210" has taken a more serious approach, attempting to 
deal with what executive producer Charles Rosin calls "issues of the heart," 
such as rejection, betrayal, substance abuse of a parent, race relations. "That 
is what kids are facing today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But "Head of the Class" producers Richard Eustis and Michael Elias think 
programmers are "misinterpreting" the reason for the success of their show and 
that of "The Wonder Years." 
</P>
<P>
"These new shows are aimed at senior high school audiences, and the only people 
who identify with lives and problems and lingo of contemporary high school 
students are contemporary high school kids," Eustis said. "The trouble is that 
high school kids are out doing other things -- renting videos, going to the 
movies -- and just are not home watching television." 
</P>
<P>
"Our whole idea is to show teaching and learning and knowing stuff in a 
positive manner, and we get parents and younger kids who want to see education 
shown in a positive light," Elias said. "We show kids enjoying themselves and 
getting great fulfillment from academic enterprises and competitions rather 
than sports competition. They enjoy doing research, debating, but they're still 
funny." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers Morrill and Rosen-Kaplan simply think the producers and programmers 
involved with the four new shows are out of touch. 
</P>
<P>
"In most of the shows, the kids have fast cars, lots of money and no jobs, and 
that's not the way it is, at least here," said Morrill, who has taught for 25 
years at Roosevelt. "And yes, male students do think about sex, but it's not a 
preoccupation; the kids I deal with have a preoccupation with survival skills, 
getting into college and working, and none of that was dealt with (in the 
episodes of the four new shows that he has seen)." 
</P>
<P>
Rosen-Kaplan, who has taught at suburban Birmingham since 1964, said that she's 
a fan of "Wonder Years" and "Head of the Class." "The principal (on the latter 
show) is an idiot, but a fun idiot, and all the other adults are good," she 
said. "The kids are just outlandish enough where you can still believe it, and 
it deals with realistic problems in realistic ways." 
</P>
<P>
But she is angry when the new shows take a cavalier attitude toward tardiness 
and truancy, as happens regularly on "Ferris Bueller" and "Parker Lewis." And 
she is incensed by the portrayal of authority figures. 
</P>
<P>
"To have the principal blackmailed because they have a sex tape on her is not 
tolerable," she said about the debut episode of "Parker Lewis." "If only they 
had some decent adults around." 
</P>
<P>
Fox's Stupin sees nothing wrong. "What we want to do is have fun with and 
satirize things everyone has been through," he said. He pointed to "Beverly 
Hills" as a show intended to have a more realistic base. 
</P>
<P>
Morrill conceded that it has. "I liked the way they picked up a newspaper and 
at least had some values, and it was good the way they picked up on someone 
using a fake address at the school -- people do that." 
</P>
<P>
But Morrill feels NBC had a better mix with "Hull High." "I think it's the best 
of the lot, more what the kids are like," he said. "Even though it was a 
fantasy with music, kids are into rap, and at least it had some minority kids 
in it."

ADVENTISTS VOTE TO UPHOLD BAN ON WOMEN CLERGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seventh-day Adventists in the large Southeastern California Conference have 
decided not to defy their denomination and authorize the ordination of women. 
</P>
<P>
At a special meeting last Sunday in Riverside, delegates voted 440 to 274 
against a task force recommendation to authorize women pastors. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Mostert Jr. of Thousand Oaks, who is president of the denomination's 
regional body that includes the conference, warned delegates that authorizing 
ordinations would create "chaos" in the church. A spokesman said Mostert was 
relieved the motion was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
"The debate was very orderly," said Jocelyn Fay, spokeswoman for the 
conference. "There was a lot of talk about unity and not creating divisions." 
</P>
<P>
The Adventists' international convention last July endorsed the relatively new 
practice of licensing women to perform most ministerial tasks, but rejected 
full ordination largely because of opposition to female clergy outside of North 
America. U.S. members number only 750,000 within the 6.2-million-member church. 
</P>
<P>
Some leaders in the influential Southeastern California Conference have hinted 
for a year that it might act because of the "inequality" of a male-only clergy. 
The conference's Gender Inclusiveness Task Force recommended Sunday that 
qualified women be ordained for service strictly within the five-county region. 
</P>
<P>
The Riverside-based conference embraces more than 100 churches in Riverside, 
San Bernardino, Imperial, San Diego and Orange counties. Last June, the 
conference became the first in North America to surpass 50,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
After rejecting the motion, delegates voted 370 to 128 to direct Southeastern 
California Conference administrators to request a new vote on women's 
ordination in October, 1991, by the denomination's Annual Council.

MEETING OF EVANGELICAL THEOLOGIANS TO DISCUSS SHIFT IN CONCEPT OF DEITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An array of noted evangelical theologians will begin a three-day conference 
Thursday at Christ College Irvine to discuss a what is termed a major trend in 
conservative Christian thinking away from an angry, justice-meting God to a 
loving, forgiving deity. 
</P>
<P>
"All evangelicals would want to say . . . that God is both friend and judge," 
said the Rev. Michael Horton of Anaheim, president of the conference-sponsoring 
Christians United for Reformation. 
</P>
<P>
But the emphasis has been shifting toward preaching and teaching about God's 
love, said Horton. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking for the new perspective will be Clark Pinnock of McMaster Divinity 
College, Ontario, Canada, Robert Webber of Wheaton College and Richard Rice of 
Loma Linda University. 
</P>
<P>
Talking about the older theology are Robert Strimple and W. Robert Godfrey of 
Westminster Theological Seminary in Escondido, Rod Rosenbladt of Christ College 
and Horton. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting will begin 9 a.m. Thursday. Registration is $50.

COMPUTAINMENT: 'VETTE!' BRINGS MILES OF SMILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANE deCOSTER and DAVID CROOK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You wouldn't expect two people who spend three hours a day commuting to and 
from work to get a kick out of playing at racing through city traffic. But 
that's just what Spectrum HoloByte's "Vette!" is all about. 
</P>
<P>
And there's something downright appealing about it. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's the chance to trade the real-life Tempo in for a gas-guzzling, 
insurance rate-busting muscle car. Or maybe it's just the overall righteousness 
of major miles-per-hour on the streets of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, this unpretentious little game fulfills a standard urban fantasy with 
relative simplicity, pretty good graphics and considerable technical 
sophistication. 
</P>
<P>
You drive one of four Corvettes on a street race through The City. You compete 
against the computer driving one of four other high-performance cars along 
courses that very closely duplicate the actual street layout of San Francisco. 
That's it. You win or lose based on your driving, nerve and ability to follow a 
map. 
</P>
<P>
And this no-brainer game is as much fun -- if not more -- if you forget about 
the race and just try your hand at maneuvering the city. For even if you are 
not especially into racing, you have to be taken by "Vette's" electronic 
mapping, which really sets this driving simulation apart from some similar 
games now hitting the game market. 
</P>
<P>
The attempt to replicate the street grid of San Francisco is impressive. Not 
perfect and not so advanced as to photographically reproduce every block of 
town, but few other games show so well both the reality and the potential of 
computer entertainment technology.

BUSH'S SUPPORT OF TERM LIMITS TURNS UP HEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's endorsement of term limits for state legislators and members 
of Congress could reshape the politics of the issue, accelerating its 
transformation from a populist struggle between insiders and outsiders into a 
partisan battle between Democrats and Republicans, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
With that possibility in sight, some leading term limit supporters expressed 
mixed emotions over Bush's endorsement Friday of a limit-setting initiative on 
the California ballot. 
</P>
<P>
On one hand, advocates welcomed the increased visibility that presidential 
support brings to the issue. But many worry that his high-profile involvement 
will allow opponents to characterize term limitations as a Republican attempt 
to accomplish through procedural reform what the party has been unable to do 
through direct elections: dislodge Democratic majorities in Congress and most 
state legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no need for the President to get involved in it," said Eddie Mahe, a 
GOP consultant who has backed term limitation efforts, "because it adds a 
partisan tone to the cause that does it no good." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, partisan tones already have begun to color the issue, if unevenly. 
Though polls show overwhelming public support for limiting congressional terms, 
a recent New York Times/CBS survey showed the margin of support was only about 
half as great among rank-and-file Democrats as among Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of prominent Democrats and liberals have endorsed term limitations, 
among them consumer activist Ralph Nader, Massachusetts gubernatorial candidate 
John R. Silber, Texas gubernatorial candidate Ann Richards, Colorado Senate 
nominee Josie Heath and California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, who launched 
one of the two term limit initiatives on next month's state ballot. 
</P>
<P>
But more leading Republicans have signed up for the cause, which was endorsed 
in general terms in the GOP's 1988 platform. The initiative Bush endorsed 
Friday was launched by Republican Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum. 
In Colorado, Republican state Sen. Terry Considine led the drive that put a 
term limit initiative on this year's ballot. Mahe, the GOP political operative, 
has organized a group called Americans to Limit Congressional Terms to support 
grass-roots drives around the country, and other Republican strategists have 
expressed interest in encouraging such efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle backed the idea weeks before the President. Florida 
Gov. Bob Martinez has endorsed term limitations, as have Sen. Pete Wilson and 
Clayton W. Williams, the GOP gubernatorial candidates in California and Texas, 
respectively. Four GOP Senate challengers -- all of them current or former 
congressmen -- are also calling for limits. 
</P>
<P>
Though some Republicans, such as former President Ronald Reagan, don't like the 
idea, opposition has been much more intense among Democrats. Organized labor 
fought the limit initiative that Oklahoma voters approved last month. In 
Colorado, Democratic Rep. Patricia Schroeder has been among the most outspoken 
opponents of the state ballot initiative, which attempts to limit the terms not 
only of local legislators but the state's congressional delegation as well. In 
California, the campaign against the term limit initiatives is being bankrolled 
and organized by Democrats in the state Legislature, and gubernatorial nominee 
Dianne Feinstein has joined them in opposing the measures. 
</P>
<P>
None of this is difficult to understand: With control of more than two-thirds 
of all state legislative chambers, and majorities in both houses of Congress, 
Democrats have the most to lose from any reform that diminishes the advantages 
of incumbency. 
</P>
<P>
But with Bush's endorsement, some believe, the possibility grows that opponents 
may persuade voters that Republicans are pushing term limits in their own 
self-interest. That debate will begin in the last days of this campaign, but it 
is more likely to emerge in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Mahe predicts, measures to limit the terms of state legislators could 
be on the ballot in as many as 12 to 15 states. And if courts uphold Colorado's 
attempt to fix a limit for its federal legislators in state law, "that could 
also be on the ballot in a number of states," Mahe said. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the ballot in 1992, of course, will be President Bush, who many believe 
has raised the issue to begin distancing himself from public disgust with 
Washington. Reagan neatly managed the trick of running against the government 
he headed. But most analysts anticipate that will be more difficult for Bush, 
whose resume reads like a condensation of the Federal Directory. 
</P>
<P>
"George Bush is a prep school, patrician, political insider and that severely 
limits his ability to tap grass-roots resentment across the country," said Stu 
Rothenberg, publisher of the Political Report, a Washington-based campaign 
newsletter.

SCHOOL DOES DOUBLE TAKE OVER ITS NUMEROUS TWINS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During a pickup football game at Sierra Intermediate School last year, Moroni 
Rodriguez burst into the clear and found himself wide open for a pass, ready to 
lead his team to victory. 
</P>
<P>
But as he signaled for the ball, his team's quarterback threw a perfect pass to 
a player on the opposite side. Though costly, the mistake was understandable: 
The opposing player was Rodriguez's twin bother, Jared. 
</P>
<P>
For Sierra eighth-grader Zuly Garcia, though, having a twin offered an 
opportunity for mischief rather than mishap. When Zuly didn't feel like 
attending her history class one day last year, she sent her twin sister, 
Xochilt, in her place. The teacher didn't detect the switch, much to the 
delight of several giggling students who did. 
</P>
<P>
Such is life these days at Sierra Intermediate School, where 10 sets of 
identical twins and one pair of fraternal twins are enrolled, a circumstance 
that has students, teachers and administrators performing a year of double 
takes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're thinking of changing our name to 'Twin Peaks,' " said Vice Principal 
Cathy Gach, herself a fraternal twin. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never seen this many twins in one place," Gach said. "It can get a 
little confusing when it comes time for grades. Teachers have to sort it all 
out and make sure credit is given to the right people. And when it comes to 
discipline, you sometimes have to say, 'Now, which one are you?' " 
</P>
<P>
Just having 11 sets of twins among 1,050 students is not by itself all that 
extraordinary, said Manuel Porto, associate professor of obstetrics and 
gynecology at UC Irvine Medical Center. Porto cited statistics that show that 
one out of every 80 pregnancies in which fertility drugs are not used results 
in twins. 
</P>
<P>
"But of those twins, only about 20% are identical," Porto added. "Ten sets of 
identical twins in a school that size is very unusual," Porto said. "At the 
most, you would expect to have maybe two or three sets of identical twins." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the occasional confusion, Sierra's twins said they enjoy their unusual 
pairings because of the extra attention they get. And most, like Ricardo and 
Fernando Lopez, say they have learned to take the cases of mistaken identity in 
stride. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked into music class on the first day of school and the teacher looked at 
me funny and said, 'Why are you here again?' " said Ricardo, 13. 
</P>
<P>
Unsurprisingly, the teacher had mistaken Ricardo for his brother, Fernando, who 
had been in her class an hour earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The Lopez brothers say they not only look alike, but think alike as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's weird being a twin," Fernando said. "Like, if I'm hungry for french 
fries, I'll walk in the kitchen and he'll be making some. That happens all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Diana and Adriana Casimiro, 12, are so physically alike that their own father 
and siblings can't tell them apart. Complicating their introduction to their 
twin-filled school is the fact that the girls are recent immigrants from Mexico 
and speak no English. School officials have departed from standard twin 
procedure and enrolled them in the same courses to avoid confusion for 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"The only person who can tell them apart is their mother," said school 
counselor Maria Colmenares. 
</P>
<P>
Sixth-graders Marsha and Marlene Zazuetta may look alike, but the 11-year-olds 
say they are as different as night and day. One prefers the "Simpsons" while 
the other watches "Cosby." One likes the music of MC Hammer while the other 
will listen only to Young MC. 
</P>
<P>
"We never agree on anything," Marsha said. "We even have different voices and 
carry different-colored folders." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia and Leticia Brito, 12, on the other hand, are so close that when one 
is punished, the other often cries. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts your feelings when your twin gets punished," agreed Jorge Lopez, 11. 
</P>
<P>
Colmenares, who has been a counselor at the school for eight years, said she is 
fascinated by the twins phenomenon at Sierra. After spotting the pairs 
throughout the first few weeks of the school year, she decided to find out just 
how many sets were enrolled at the school. She said she was astonished by her 
discovery. 
</P>
<P>
Colmenares' research also revealed that two pairs of identical twins graduated 
from the school last year and a pair of identical twins served as co-student 
body presidents during the school's first year, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Those twins, Jeff and Christopher Pratt, went on to Santa Ana High School, 
where Christopher Pratt was student body president and Jeff was vice president. 
Both now are sophomores at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't know better," Colmenares said, "I would think that someone is 
cloning the students of Sierra."

PSYCHOLOGIST FACES SEX MISCONDUCT, SATANIC CHARGES

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State medical regulators took action this week to revoke the license of a 
Laguna Beach psychologist, accusing her of being mentally ill, guilty of sexual 
misconduct and using satanic rituals to treat a patient. 
</P>
<P>
A complaint filed by the Medical Board of California alleges that Dr. Clara Mae 
Etheridge told a female patient who was diagnosed as having a multiple 
personality disorder that "dark forces" and "evil spirits" were tracking her 
through her jewelry. The psychologist prescribed rituals, including "the use of 
lemon juice after showers," and advised her patient to burn "her mother's 
Bible, all pictures and letters," the complaint contends. 
</P>
<P>
"In my 15 years of handling cases for the Medical Board, this is the most 
bizarre behavior I've seen," said Deputy Atty. Gen. Barry D. Ladendorf, who is 
representing the state regulators. "This mixture of witchcraft and satanic 
cults with psychotherapy creates serious questions about her practice. 
'Bizarre' is the only word to describe it." 
</P>
<P>
When contacted Friday, Etheridge told The Times, "This is the first I've heard 
about this. I don't know anything about it. Thanks for telling me, I certainly 
have to check it out." 
</P>
<P>
Pam Kuehn-Thatcher, a Newport Beach attorney representing the psychologist, 
later said that Etheridge denies all the allegations. Kuehn-Thatcher declined 
further comment, saying she had not seen a copy of the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
The case against Etheridge was turned over to the attorney general after a 
yearlong investigation by the Santa Ana office of the Medical Board. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Schmidt, a senior special investigator, said the inquiry was launched 
after officials received a complaint from a psychologist who subsequently 
treated Etheridge's former patient, identified in the complaint only as "E.G." 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt said Etheridge -- who has been practicing for 17 years -- was 
confronted with the charges several weeks ago and denied them. But 
investigators have obtained statements from a medical doctor and two other 
psychologists that tend to corroborate the alleged victim's claims, Schmidt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is common for these accusations to be a case of 'my word against yours,' " 
the investigator said. "But not so here. The entire case is fairly unique. I've 
been with board for 18 years and I have never seen a case in which mention of 
the occult is so heavily involved." 
</P>
<P>
The complaint charges that Etheridge is also known as Clara Mae Riley, and that 
she treated E.G. from Feb. 3 to April 5, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
During one therapy session, Etheridge allegedly held her female patient for two 
hours while lying on the floor, and "during this time (Etheridge) kissed E.G.'s 
cheek and forehead, caressed her hair and placed E.G.'s hand on her 
(Etheridge's) genital area." 
</P>
<P>
The complaint contends that Etheridge "used occult, satanic rituals and 
concepts intermingled with psychotherapy," and discouraged hospitalization for 
her patient by warning that E.G. "would be programmed to kill herself" if she 
was admitted to a hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Etheridge allegedly told her patient that all psychiatric hospitals in Orange 
County were unsafe because they were infiltrated by the occult. And she once 
placed E.G.'s earrings and jewelry in salt, the complaint alleges, so "dark 
forces could not track her."

MAN GETS 25 YEARS IN SHOOTING THAT KILLED 2 AND WOUNDED 6

<P>
A judge sentenced Roman Gabriel Menchaca to 25 years to life in prison Friday 
for conspiracy in a gang-retaliation shooting last year that left six people 
wounded and two dead, one a 17-year-old and the other a 4-year-old on the way 
to the movies with his family. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in the back of Superior Court Judge Tully H. Seymour's courtroom were 
two rows of young Menchaca supporters, dressed alike in bright, white T-shirts 
imprinted with large black letters that read: "Not Guilty." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have called the Sept. 16, 1989, shooting in Garden Grove the worst 
gang-related incident in the county. Two young men in the back of a pickup 
truck opened fire on La Bonita Avenue just after dark, causing more than a 
dozen people to flee or duck for cover. 
</P>
<P>
Killed were 4-year-old Frankie Fernandez Jr., sitting in the back of his 
family's car, and Mike (Smokey) Navarro, 17, who may have been a primary target 
of the assailants. Prosecutors claim that Menchaca and other 5th Street gang 
members were retaliating against the 17th Street gang, which includes La Bonita 
in its turf, for an earlier shooting of a 5th Streeter. 
</P>
<P>
Convicted of murder in the shooting were Louis P. Valadez, 28, and Robert P. 
Figueroa, 20, who face automatic prison terms of life without parole when 
sentenced next Friday. Also convicted of murder in the incident was a 
15-year-old juvenile, scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The juvenile and Menchaca, now 20, were accused by witnesses of being the two 
gunmen. However, a jury deadlocked on the murder count and instead convicted 
Menchaca of conspiracy to commit murder, which carries an automatic 25-year 
term unless modified by Seymour. 
</P>
<P>
Micki Comacho, mother of the slain Navarro, made an impassioned plea at 
Friday's sentencing: 
</P>
<P>
"I've known Roman since he was 8 or 9 years old; why did he want to hurt me 
this way," she said. Then she turned to Menchaca and added, "If you wanted to 
hurt my son, why didn't you take me instead. Then he would have hurt, then he 
would have suffered." 
</P>
<P>
Menchaca attorney C. Thomas McDonald also made a brief but biting statement to 
the judge. 
</P>
<P>
"This verdict is based on the perjured testimony of rival, vindictive gang 
members who will say or do anything to convict a rival gang member," the 
defense lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef told Seymour that "the only way to educate 
these gang members is to give them the maximum sentence and publicize it to 
their cohorts." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities feared that the shooting incident would go unsolved until three 
young women who had been a part of the 17th Street gang came forward -- 
breaking the gang's "code of silence" -- to identify the attackers. 
</P>
<P>
Security in the courtroom was heavy because of a bitter verbal confrontation 
between the rival gangs and their families when the three were convicted two 
months ago in Harbor Court in Newport Beach. But Friday, most of the people 
present supported Menchaca. 
</P>
<P>
The families of the two victims left the courtroom without incident. 
</P>
<P>
At the trial in Harbor Court, the victim's supporters said that it would be up 
to 5th Street gang members to decide if a war between the two communities was 
to continue. But Friday, the 5th Street supporters complained that 17th 
Streeters have been the only ones to retaliate, spray-painting their gang name 
all over the neighborhood.

PERSIMMON SEASON AND STAND OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to growing persimmons in Orange County, there are two local 
producers. Rancher Bill Bathgate is the biggest, which isn't saying much except 
for the produce stand his family opened Friday. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 15 years, the Bathgates have sold persimmons, oranges and 
avocados from a ramshackle wooden building off Camino Capistrano, and its first 
day of business every year is the official beginning of persimmon season. 
</P>
<P>
And as long as the Bathgates have persimmons to sell, the stand will stay open. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the success of other years, that will probably be about two months 
-- and they don't even advertise. Instead, the family sends out a newsletter to 
customers who sign up at the stand. 
</P>
<P>
"The power of the grapevine can be very great," Bathgate said. "Of course, it 
doesn't hurt that we're right by the freeway and people can see us." 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, a reporter drove from Los Angeles to do a story for the 
Korean News. That story still brings customers to San Juan Capistrano, Bathgate 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I still see people arriving, holding the story in their hands," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bathgates never intended to have the stand off Camino Capistrano, but the 
high demand for their produce finally nudged them into business more than 50 
years after the family bought 75 acres of ranchland in the northernmost part of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to sell all our produce in L.A.'s wholesale markets," Bathgate said. 
"But there were so many people who kept wandering onto the ranch, we finally 
had to open up a stand." 
</P>
<P>
The family sells Fuyu (the Japanese word for winter) persimmons, a 
sweet-tasting orange fruit that resembles an apple, at $20 for a 25-pound box. 
Bathgate estimates that he has about 1,000 persimmon trees on his ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Bathgates don't own the ranch anymore. 
</P>
<P>
It belongs to the Rev. Robert H. Schuller's family. 
</P>
<P>
Schuller, who bought the land last year, has plans to eventually put a cemetery 
and a center for senior citizens on the property. 
</P>
<P>
But until then, the Bathgates continue to farm avocados, oranges and persimmons 
-- the three crops that have been staples since his family bought the property 
in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
The Schullers pay Bill Bathgate to remain as a caretaker. 
</P>
<P>
The Bathgates started out selling English walnuts. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, the ranch shifted to oranges, at least partially because of the husk 
fly, a pest that can destroy the walnut harvest. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time we pulled the walnuts out, people said there was more money in 
oranges," Bathgate said. "Of course, it hasn't always worked out that way." LEN 
HALL

FOG DELAYS FLIGHTS AT WAYNE AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than a dozen early morning flights out of John Wayne Airport were delayed 
by heavy fog Friday, and meteorologists predicted that conditions will remain 
virtually unchanged throughout the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials reported delays of 15 to 35 minutes on 16 flights, but some 
passengers said they waited about an hour for the fog to burn away. Still, most 
travelers seemed unfazed by the delays and passed the time either admiring the 
new terminal design or grumbling about airport parking costs. 
</P>
<P>
"The delays I expect, but the parking . . . it's outrageous!" said Frank Cier 
of Diamond Bar, referring to new terminal parking charges that run as high as 
$14 a day. 
</P>
<P>
The higher parking charges went into effect last month when the $310-million 
terminal opened to the public. Long-term parking lots north of the terminal are 
expected to continue operating at least through early December at $7 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Cier and his wife, Pam Eversole, who were bound for Miami on vacation, were 
told their flight would be 20 to 25 minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be mad if we miss our flight in Dallas," Eversole said. 
</P>
<P>
Slumped in her seat at an American Airlines gate, Sera Oxner of Mountainside, 
N.J., seemed more impressed with the design of the new terminal than upset by 
the wait. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very comfortable," she said. "Everything is very clean -- a very 
nice-looking airport." 
</P>
<P>
While early-morning air travelers can expect delays as long as the fog lasts, 
meteorologists agree the pattern should be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasts through Sunday call for the system of stable high pressure to 
continue its dominance over much of Southern California, bringing with it 
late-night and early-morning fog. 
</P>
<P>
"This pattern is just right to hold the pollution in there too," said Steve 
Burback, a meteorologist for WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The 
Times. "But the morning heating should break it up very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Burback said a break in the pattern and cooler temperatures could arrive by 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Davies, area supervisor for the Federal Aviation Administration, said 
the fog presented "minimal impact" Friday, adding that much of it had burned 
off by about 7:20 a.m. KEVIN JOHNSON

ARTIST TO DO REPLICA OF HIS POPULAR MURAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For almost two weeks, Emigdio Vasquez has spent most of his time outside the 
Santa Ana Transit Terminal with a paintbrush in his hand, re-creating the 
history of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old artist has begun work on an ambitious mural filled with images 
of the county's past. For a canvas, he is using an 85-foot-long stretch of 
terminal wall that runs alongside Santa Ana Boulevard between Broadway and Ross 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
"People walk by and give me the thumbs up sign," Vasquez said. "Some honk, or 
just smile. A lot of them tell me they think there should be more murals around 
like in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez, who lives in Orange, has created 20 murals during his 30-year career. 
He said he enjoys creating the enormous works of art, but this particular 
project is one he has mixed feelings about, mainly because he has painted it 
once before. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, while Vasquez was the artist-in-residence at Bowers Museum in Santa 
Ana, he painted an almost identical 100-foot-long mural on a wall at the 
museum. Earlier this year, he was told that it would have to be demolished to 
make way for the museum's $12-million expansion project. 
</P>
<P>
"The mural has been very, very well-received in the community and has a lot of 
loyalty attached to it," said Jose De Falla, museum director. "We are very 
pleased to be able to work out an arrangement so that the mural will continue 
its life." 
</P>
<P>
Extracting the mural from the wall would have been too costly, according to 
museum officials, so they opted to find another location for it to be redone. 
Vasquez will be paid $16,000 for the replica, which will require about 20 
gallons of acrylic paint. 
</P>
<P>
The new project has helped ease the pain the artist said he felt when he 
learned the original work was going to be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, I was devastated," Vasquez said. 'But, I'm happy to some degree 
that I'm going to get to do a replica of it. And, more people will get to see 
it here because it's in a much more visible location." GREG HERNANDEZ

SENTENCING: THE SANTA ANA RESIDENT WAS CONVICTED IN JUNE OF BEATING TO DEATH 
HIS GIRLFRIEND'S 11-MONTH-OLD DAUGHTER.

<P>
Steven Delgado, the 22-year-old Santa Ana man convicted of second-degree murder 
in the beating death of his girlfriend's 11-month-old daughter, was sentenced 
Friday to serve 15 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the sentence, Superior Court Judge Ragner Engebretsen recommended 
against probation for Delgado. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not think that there is an appropriate case for probation here," 
Engebretsen said, "especially considering the extremely serious nature of the 
conviction, as it involved an 11-month-old child." 
</P>
<P>
Delgado, who was present for the hearing, did not react. 
</P>
<P>
The sentencing followed a complicated two-day hearing on a defense motion for a 
retrial, based in large part on a written confession to the crime submitted by 
the girl's mother, Elizabeth Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
In denying the request for a new trial, Engebretsen said he was convinced that 
the jury had considered the possibility of other suspects, including the 
mother, during its deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Engebretsen ruled on a second issue raised by Delgado's lawyer in 
the motion for a new trial. Frederick McBride, Delgado's attorney, objected to 
an exchange between the judge and jurors during the jury's deliberation, 
arguing that a clarification that jurors had sought should have been delivered 
in writing rather than orally. 
</P>
<P>
Engebretsen said, however, that his comments had been clarified in a written 
note to the 12 jurors and that he did not feel the exchange had damaged 
Delgado's right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
The trial, which took place in June, was notable in that the 5-year-old brother 
of the victim took the stand for the prosecution. During one especially 
dramatic moment, the child pointed out Delgado as the man he had watched kill 
his infant sister. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the proceedings, Ruiz made contradictory statements regarding the 
events that took place the night of the murder. After the judge ruled that her 
post-conviction confessions were not substantial reasons for a new trial, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert C. Gannon Jr. said he was not surprised by Ruiz's 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
"Her changing story had created additional concern during the investigation, 
and we worked extremely hard on the case because of the fact that we had some 
conflicts from someone who had been an eyewitness to some of the events," 
Gannon said. "Our appraisal that much of what she said was either inaccurate or 
untrue was confirmed by the jury." 
</P>
<P>
McBride said he expects to appeal the conviction. "It's probably not over yet," 
he said.

Five male peach fruit flies, usually found in India and Southeast Asia, have 
been found in traps in residential back yards, state agriculture officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the insects were found in a single trap in a pineapple guava tree and 
the others were found in traps in avocado and orange trees, located on nearby 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural officials said the flies will be eradicated using the "male 
annihilation" method, which involves applications of a pesticide with an 
attractant to tree trunks and utility poles. 
</P>
<P>
The treatment will be repeated every two weeks, officials said.

SUSPECTS FOUND 2 YEARS AFTER COSTA MESA SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A man and a woman who eluded Costa Mesa police for nearly two years were 
arrested early Friday in Riverside in connection with the shooting death of the 
woman's husband, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Tovar Ramirez, 40, and Graciela Delacruz, 42, both formerly of Santa 
Ana and now living in Perris, were arrested at 2 a.m. after police staked out a 
Greyhound bus terminal in Riverside and found them on a bus bound for the East 
Coast, said Costa Mesa Police Sgt. Ron Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez was being held in the Costa Mesa Jail on suspicion of murder, and 
Delacruz was being held in Orange County Jail on charges of aiding and abetting 
a suspected felon, Smith said. Each is being held in lieu of $250,000. They are 
to be arraigned Tuesday in Harbor Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the couple fled after the Dec. 26, 1988, shooting death of 
Delacruz's husband, Jeremias Diaz Delacruz, 41, of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The husband, who was driving a vanload of friends through Costa Mesa, had 
spotted his wife in Ramirez's car. He followed Ramirez to a cul-de-sac, and 
when the men got out of their vehicles, Ramirez allegedly fired two fatal shots 
at Jeremias Delacruz and shot twice more at the passengers in the van. No one 
else was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Based on a tip on the suspects' whereabouts Thursday, police first went to 
their home in Perris, only to find that they had been warned and had left a few 
hours earlier, said Smith, who heads the department's homicide investigation 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the couple apparently traveled from Perris to Los Angeles and then 
boarded a cross-country bus. 
</P>
<P>
Police staked out local bus stations and arrested the couple without incident 
when they arrived at the Greyhound depot in downtown Riverside about 2 a.m. 
Friday.

A 35-year-old Torrance man was killed Friday afternoon when a car struck him as 
he was using an emergency call box on the San Diego Freeway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuk Hyon Ka was pronounced dead at the scene of the 1 p.m. accident, said a 
coroner's office spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Ka stopped on the southbound shoulder of the freeway after his car broke down 
near the eastbound junction of the Garden Grove Freeway and the Bolsa Chica 
Road off-ramp, said California Highway Patrol Sgt. Jack Skaggs. 
</P>
<P>
As Ka was using the emergency call box to telephone for help, he was struck by 
a Hyundai that veered onto the shoulder.

MEXICAN GLASSMAKER GETS FOREIGN LOAN; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: JUST ONE U.S. FIRM IS PARTICIPATING IN THE $126-MILLION VITRO DEAL. 
</P>

MONTERREY, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the largest new commercial bank loan to a Mexican company since the Third 
World debt crisis began eight years ago, 16 international banks and an arm of 
the World Bank agreed this week to lend glassmaking giant Vitro $126 million 
for up to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the International Finance Corp., the World Bank unit that extends 
credit to private companies, said it will invest $10 million in the company's 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
The loan and new stock issue are expected to cover most of the $150-million 
cost of a new plant, which will double Vitro's production of glass for the 
automotive, construction and furniture industries. Plant construction in this 
city in northeastern Mexico is scheduled to take two years. 
</P>
<P>
Vitro is Mexico's largest glassmaker, with 1989 revenue of $1.7 billion, and 
owns Anchor Glass, a major U.S. bottle maker. From its Monterrey plant, Vitro 
also supplies about 8% of the glass used in the windshields and windows of 
U.S.-made cars. 
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Martens, Vitro president, said the expansion is needed to keep up with 
growing demand and would not have been possible without the international loan. 
Long-term credit is virtually unavailable in Mexico, and interest rates on 
short-term credit are 35% or more annually. 
</P>
<P>
Already among the strongest companies on the Mexican Stock Exchange, the 
corporation is considered a likely candidate to begin trading on U.S. markets 
through American Depository Receipts, the equivalent of shares for foreign 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
The loan was made to Vitro's flat-glass production company, Vitro Flotado, 
which is 35% owned by Pilkington PLC of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The banks agreed to lend Vitro the money at a favorable interest rate of 2 
percentage points over the London Interbank Rate. 
</P>
<P>
The International Finance Corp., which organized the loan, will supply $25 
million. The rest of the borrowed money will come from 15 European banks and 
First City Texas-Houston. 
</P>
<P>
In the last eight years, U.S. banks have set up reserves and written off 
billions of dollars in Latin American debt, contributing to large losses.

Mercury S&amp;L Lawsuit: A New York investor filed a lawsuit Friday alleging 
that former directors and officers of the failed Mercury Savings &amp; Loan 
Assn. committed securities violations. The suit, which seeks class-action 
status, accuses Leonard Shane, Mercury's former chairman and nine others of 
releasing "materially false and misleading information" about Mercury's 
revenues and loan portfolio. The suit is the second shareholder complaint 
against former executives of Mercury, which was taken over earlier this year by 
federal regulators.

TASTING: IN COSTA MESA, A MONDAVI DIRECTOR SPONSORS AN EVENING WHEN $150 BUYS A 
CHOICE OF RECENT VINTAGES, A GOURMET DINNER AND THE ACTOR WHO TAKES HIS CUES 
FROM POE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eric Hansen had been plying Vincent Price with wine for months. Thursday night, 
just in time for Halloween, those bottles of pinot noir finally paid off. 
</P>
<P>
Making a rare public appearance, Price came to Costa Mesa to be the centerpiece 
for Hansen's upscale answer to trick-or-treating. The director of the Robert 
Mondavi winery's Southern California outpost, Hansen had organized an evening 
when $150 bought a grab bag of recent vintages, a gourmet dinner and the 
presence of Price, who read a sampling from his favorite poet. In order of 
descending importance, the black-tie affair was titled "Price, Pinot and Poe." 
</P>
<P>
Charged with upgrading the image of wine in a culture more familiar with Night 
Train Express than Chateau Rothschild, Hansen reasoned that the presence of the 
famed actor would add a touch of class to the business of drinking. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to associate fine wine with the artistic community, and the man is 
truly an artistic treasure," Hansen said of Price, who has appeared in films 
ranging from "Laura" to "Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine." 
</P>
<P>
"But more than that," Hansen said, "he is a great connoisseur of fine food and 
wine." 
</P>
<P>
Price, whose viticultural expertise once led President Lyndon B. Johnson to 
seek his advice on California wines, opened his remarks with a crowd-pleaser: 
Poe, he recalled, "could juggle the book and the bottle with equal dexterity." 
</P>
<P>
He then launched a 20-minute discussion of the appropriately disturbing poesy 
of Poe, beginning with "The Conqueror Worm," a comment on mortality as well as 
the title of one of Price's many Poe-derived films. 
</P>
<P>
The actor continued with such works as "The Bells" and concluded with what 
might be considered Price's own signature piece, "The Raven." 
</P>
<P>
Would he read it again? "Nevermore," he answered. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Price had more current terrors on which to comment. He made pointed 
reference to the crusades against artistic freedom led by Sen. Jesse Helms 
(R-N.C.) and others. 
</P>
<P>
The chilling of free speech particularly concerns Price, who recalls that when 
he started making movies in the 1930s, filmmakers were severly restricted in 
what they could show. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd gotten so far since then. We emerged as the most creative nation on 
earth," Price said. "Then we get set back by some fool trying to make his name 
in politics. It's such a shame." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Price said he was heartened by the recent acquittals in the 
obscenity trials of Contemporary Arts Center officials in Cincinnati and the 
rap group 2 Live Crew. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will all pass eventually, just like it did before," he said, 
referring to the McCarthy era. "Somebody will finally say no (to censorship), 
just like the people on that Cincinnati jury did." 
</P>
<P>
He had less faith, however, that the audience at hand would see the linkage of 
Poe, Luther Campbell and the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it went straight over their heads. It's Orange County. You're never 
sure what they'll get down here," the Yale-educated actor said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, this was not a group that was ready to discuss 19th-Century poetry, 
1990s rap or, for that matter, the Roger Corman exploitation pictures that 
etched Price his place in film history. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, like children lining up to meet a shopping center Santa Claus, the 
stemware-clutching sophisticates waited eagerly to have their pictures snapped 
with the macabre legend. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps in testimony to the potency of the evening's treats, they amused Price 
with somewhat inaccurate attempts to compliment him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased to hear you knew Sinclair," said a local developer, apparently 
confusing Price's reference to Sinclair Lewis, the author of "Babbitt," with 
the novelist-politician Upton Sinclair. Price nodded politely. 
</P>
<P>
When a woman forthrightly asked Price his age, the 79-year-old actor deviously 
replied, "90!" 
</P>
<P>
"You know," she said reassuringly, "my grandmother lived till 96." 
</P>
<P>
Price smiled at the woman, before making an aside: "These people are so full of 
it. They'll swallow anything." 
</P>
<P>
To be fair to the 100-odd folk who came to experience the good life with Price, 
few had any pretensions of expertise. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good idea to bring fine wine and fine acting together," said Yorba 
Linda drapery company owner Rick Ashbrook, 43. "But I certainly didn't 
appreciate these things in my 20s. I grew up as a surfer in California. What 
did we appreciate? Probably nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Some confessed that they didn't even have that much familiarity with Price 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even know he acted," said Darci Davis, one of the youngest at the 
affair. The 17-year-old from Dana Point, who came with her father, a Mondavi 
employee, remembered just one exposure to Price's distinctively diabolical 
voice. 
</P>
<P>
"The only time I ever heard him was on the 'Thriller' record," she said, 
referring to the Michael Jackson song that features Price's narration. 
</P>
<P>
Price may be cultivated, but he's no snob. 
</P>
<P>
"People kidded the pants off me when I did that," he said. "But it's a good 
album. I listened to it the other day, and it really holds up." 
</P>
<P>
So, it seems, does Vincent Price.

COLLEGE'S TRIBUTE TO AN ENDURING TV SERIES: 'LASSIE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lassie can't talk, but her actions speak volumes. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 50 years she's been boys' best friend, and the tributes are 
starting to roll in. The Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery in 
Washington is heralding the occasion with a special exhibit to honor the 
popular pooch and her creator, Eric Knight, author of the 1940 novel "Lassie 
Come Home" that launched the legend. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Orange County, Rancho Santiago College will salute Lassie's place in 
broadcast history Sunday night at its annual "Tribute to a Television Classic." 
The 7 p.m. fund-raiser in Phillips Hall on the Santa Ana campus is in keeping 
with the Sunday night time slot the original series occupied for 17 years on 
CBS from 1954-71. It aired three more years in first-run syndication. 
</P>
<P>
The show returned to television last season -- again in first-run syndication 
-- marking 21 years of production and making "Lassie" the longest-running 
dramatic episodic series in history. 
</P>
<P>
Lassie buffs know that Knight first introduced the famous collie in the 
December, 1938, issue of the Saturday Evening Post. Nine feature films, a 
national radio show, comic book series, and both live-action and animated 
television shows followed. Her enduring popularity is reflected in the No. 1 
ratings "The New Lassie" garners in major markets from Atlanta to New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
"People tune in because they want to feel the same things they felt as 
children," says actress Dee Wallace Stone (of "E.T." fame), who co-stars in 
"The New Lassie." 
</P>
<P>
At Sunday's tribute, old and new cast members will reunite to swap Lassie 
stories, sign autographs for fans and answer the audience's questions. The 
current Lassie, a seventh-generation descendant of the original collie, is 
billed as the night's special guest and will be accompanied by his trainer, Bob 
Weatherwax, son of the original Lassie's owner and trainer, Rudd Weatherwax. 
Lassie is expected to offer fans his "pawtographs." 
</P>
<P>
A special 21-minute video salute to the collie and her various human co-stars 
will be screened. It notes, among other tidbits, that while Lassie the 
character is a girl, she has always been portrayed by male dogs. (More such 
facts can be found in trivia books that will go to the first 250 attendees.) 
</P>
<P>
"Working with Lassie was just wonderful," recalls Tom Rettig, who played the 
boy Jeff Miller from 1954-57. He remembers the original black-and-white series 
as a mix of humor and adventure. "There were three stories: Lassie saves the 
boy, the boy saves Lassie or they both saved someone else, and frequently that 
someone else was another animal -- a lion, a fox or a raccoon. You name it, 
Lassie saved it." 
</P>
<P>
Now 48 and living in Marina del Rey, Rettig left acting years ago for a career 
as a writer. He's known in computer circles as the author of programming books, 
magazine articles and columns, but is breaking into commercial television with 
original scripts for -- what else -- "The New Lassie." 
</P>
<P>
An episode he co-wrote, "The Computer Study," is set to air in mid-November. In 
it, he also reprises his role as Jeff Miller, only this time he's a grown-up 
professor of computer science, who teaches Lassie how to use the modern marvel. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night, Rettig will join the entire cast of regulars from "The New 
Lassie," including Jon Provost, who has a recurring role as Uncle Steve. 
Provost, however, is best known for the seven seasons he played the 
dimple-faced Timmy Martin from 1957-64. Those episodes currently air on cable 
television's Nickelodeon channel. 
</P>
<P>
Like Rettig before him, Provost eventually grew weary of the television grind 
(and of eternal boyhood) and left the double Emmy-winning show to seek "a 
normal life." 
</P>
<P>
"I literally grew up with Lassie," said the 40-year-old in a telephone 
interview from his home in Santa Rosa. "I started when I was 7 and finished 
when I was 14. When I left the show in '64, half my life had been with Lassie." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, he never really let go. Through the years of college, marriage and raising 
a family, Provost kept track of the property. "Each time it changed hands, I 
contacted the new owners," he said. "I always knew that something would happen, 
and I would get back into show business." 
</P>
<P>
He had hoped to consult on any new version of the series. "I wanted to see . . 
. were they going to destroy my memories?" 
</P>
<P>
But after meeting with Al Burton, TNL's executive producer, and others who 
noticed how much he looked like the show's husband and father, Christopher 
Stone, Provost struck a deal for an on-screen role as Stone's brother, Steve. 
</P>
<P>
Now when TNL is in production, he commutes to Los Angeles and bunks with 
relatives. "It works out great for me," said Provost, who spends more time 
selling real estate in Northern California, where he's often recognized as 
Lassie's longtime companion. 
</P>
<P>
He also acts informally as the show's "walking encyclopedia" answering 
historical questions for the writers, producers and publicists. 
</P>
<P>
The series has taken its cues from the soaps to weave intricate story lines 
that explain the many cast changes, including Provost's return as 
Timmy-turned-Steve. You see, he was a runaway orphan who was taken in by the 
Martins and . . . well, it's all wrapped up neatly in the video retrospective 
Al Burton Productions produced especially for Sunday's tribute. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a treasure in itself," says Terry Bales, organizer of the event and chair 
of Rancho Santiago College's telecommunications department. (The night's 
proceeds will fund equipment and scholarships for the department.) 
</P>
<P>
The video uses film and television clips to trace the history of Lassie and 
salute its creator, trainers and co-stars -- from Roddy McDowall and Elizabeth 
Taylor to June Lockhart and Jimmy Stewart. (A shorter version of the tape was 
sent to the Smithsonian for its exhibit, which continues through Jan. 27.) 
</P>
<P>
Both McDowall and Lockhart have "come home" to the Lassie series. Lockhart, who 
played Timmy's mom from 1958-64, guest-starred in a special reunion show that 
aired last season, and she is due back next year. Meanwhile, McDowall, who 
played the 11-year-old boy in the very first Lassie film in 1943, has returned 
to play a writer of children's stories in a character modeled after 
Lassie-creator Knight. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's in-person lineup includes the Stones, who are married to one another 
in real life and on the series; Wendy Cox, who plays their teen-age daughter; 
and Will Nipper, the son and newest boy in Lassie's life. 
</P>
<P>
The tribute will mark the first time that all three television "Lassie" boy 
co-stars will be together for a public appearance. 
</P>
<P>
And like the other boys before him, 11-year-old Nipper enjoys playing with the 
collie between takes. "There are a lot of places to go on the back lot at 
Universal Studios," said Nipper. "When we shoot outdoors, I can ride my bike 
and he runs along behind." 
</P>
<P>
To hear those associated with "Lassie" tell it, the show has not strayed far 
from its beginnings in the Miller household in the Midwestern farm town of 
Calverton to its present-day setting in the suburban Glen Ridge, Calif., home 
of the McCulloch family. 
</P>
<P>
Mom has swapped her skirts for slacks, the checkerboard kitchen tablecloth is 
gone, and the wind-up telephone has given way to a push-button model, but the 
concept remains the same. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Lassie' remains basically a boy and his dog," said Burton, who noted that 
new scripts feature an expanded role for the daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the old 'Lassie' in its heart," said Dee Wallace Stone, "but in its 
style, it's a brand new show for today's audiences. It's family programming 
that we desperately need right now." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bales: "The scripts are full of humor and pathos and the usual things that 
make you laugh and cry a little bit, with a moral lesson that doesn't hit you 
over the head." 
</P>
<P>
Added Burton: "She represents a warmth and a caring and a togetherness in 
family life that is fast disappearing from television." 
</P>
<P>
 "Lassie" airs on Nickelodeon twice daily. "The New Lassie" airs at 9:30 a.m 
Fridays on KCOP Channel 13. Tickets to "Tribute to a Television Classic" are 
$12 for adults and $10 for children and seniors and are available at the box 
office. The event will be held Sunday at 7 p.m. at Phillips Hall Theatre, 
Rancho Santiago College, 17th and Bristol streets, Santa Ana. Information:

When it opened in October of 1975, "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" was met with 
about as much enthusiasm as Ozzy Osbourne at a church revival. But over the 
years, its growth in popularity has made it the granddaddy of midnight movies, 
a standard-bearer among cult films. 
</P>
<P>
In acknowledgment of this triumph and to celebrate 12 years locally of midnight 
rendezvous with Frank-n-Furter, Riff Raff and the rest of the "Rocky" gang, 
Midnight Insanity, a local troupe of amateur actors and "Rocky" enthusiasts, is 
presenting special anniversary and Halloween screenings of the movie tonight 
and Wednesday at the Balboa Landmark Theatre, 709 E. Balboa Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
There'll be birthday cake tonight and balloons and costume contests both 
nights. Prizes include a CD soundtrack from the film, posters and buttons, and 
tapes of "Rocky" radio spots, and renditions of "Rocky" songs from a variety of 
live theater productions. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's party starts at 11:30, with the screening itself scheduled for 12:45. 
Wednesday's times are 11 and 11:45. Admission each night is $6. Information:

I'm the parent of a teen-ager who dearly loves the New Kids.

As a parent, I'm glad to have a group that sings, dances and entertains in a

have such a refreshing young group come to the forefront of the music world.

PROTECTING A HOUSE FROM BURGLARY DURING VACATION

From Do It Yourself 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the joys of traveling is coming home. 
</P>
<P>
Reduce the risk of finding that your house has been burglarized by following 
these tips before leaving: 
</P>
<P>
* Ask a trusted neighbor to collect the mail, newspapers and deliveries and to 
check the house from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
* Arrange to have the lawn mowed. 
</P>
<P>
* Put valuables and documents in a bank safe-deposit box. 
</P>
<P>
* Lock all doors and windows, including those in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
* Light all entries. Burglars avoid bright areas. 
</P>
<P>
* Instead of leaving interior lights and appliances on all the time, set timers 
to simulate normal use. 
</P>
<P>
* Turn down the bell on the telephone. A nonstop ringing phone tells a burglar 
that no one is home. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't store empty trash cans outside. Hide them in a locked garage or out of 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
* Leave a car in the driveway or ask a neighbor to park there. 
</P>
<P>
* Remove anything that shows names or addresses from a car that must be left at 
the airport. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't announce vacation plans in the local paper. 
</P>
<P>
* Remember that the goal is to create the illusion that the house is occupied 
as usual. Take some time before departure to analyze the home's vulnerable 
areas and eliminate anything that could make it an easy target for burglary.

CONTROLLING THE HEAT BY REMOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON GASBARRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In hot weather you want to flop on the couch and not move. Mitsubishi Electric 
has an air conditioner with a remote control that lets you cool down without 
getting up. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the Mr. Slim series of wall-mounted and ductless cooling units, the 
wireless remote lets you change the temperature and air direction as easily as 
flipping a TV channel. 
</P>
<P>
The remote controller, called the "I Feel Control" feature, uses a 
microprocessor and LCD readout to indicate the mode you are in. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you just came in from work and want to quickly cool a room, put 
the fan speed on high. If you want the room at 70 degrees, you can program it 
and the unit will remember the setting from day to day. 
</P>
<P>
You can also tell the system to kick on before you come home, and the room will 
be cool when you get there. 
</P>
<P>
"The air conditioner itself has a heat pump system that can also be used for 
warming a room in the winter," says Richard Trethewey, the plumber on "This Old 
House" on PBS and an air-conditioning contractor in Boston. "Instead of burning 
gas or oil, the Mitsubishi draws heat energy from the surrounding air." 
</P>
<P>
The Mr. Slim is priced steeply -- from $2,500 to $3,000 installed for 9,000 to 
14,500 BTUs, and you need a professional air-conditioning contractor to do the 
work. Energy efficiency ratings for the line are excellent, ranging from 9.0 to 
10.6. 
</P>
<P>
Panasonic's new L-shaped air conditioners look unusual. But their special shape 
makes them quieter, and they use less window space. 
</P>
<P>
The compressor and other main components hang outside and below the window. Its 
cross-flow fan directs cool air inside while the roar of the motor stays 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
"Compared to standard air conditioners, the front panels of these L-shaped 
models are about 6 inches high, eliminating blocked views and blocked 
sunlight," says Ian Brydon, national marketing manager of Panasonic's home 
appliance division. Standard units of comparable BTUs (6,000 to 8,000) are 
about 11 inches high. 
</P>
<P>
Ideal for an upstairs room or a bedroom, the L-shaped Panasonics cost $475 to 
$600, depending on the model. The energy efficiency rating is 9.1.

HAUTE INERIOR; 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN: FARI'S INSISTENCE ON PERFECTION FRUSTRATES SOME, BUT HAS WON HIM A 
DEVOTED CLIENTELE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN O'HAREN, Maureen O'Haren is a regular contributor to Home Design. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Half a dozen 22-foot king palms had just been planted in front of the Big 
Canyon home of Clifford Heinz when Fari changes his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't right," said the Iranian-born interior designer, who, like his 
famous brother Bijan, goes by his first name only. "They weren't perfect. Yes, 
the crane was there, money was pouring out and it's my money." 
</P>
<P>
But Fari decided queen palms would better complement the house, and so out went 
the kings. They became another casualty in the 39-year-old designer's feverish 
pursuit of what he calls "this look." 
</P>
<P>
Another example: Once, while a client admired the mirrors just installed on a 
living room wall 45 feet wide and two stories high, the craftsman began taking 
the mirrored panes down. Fari's orders. 
</P>
<P>
"The seams weren't right," Fari explained offhandedly. "Installation." 
</P>
<P>
His insistence of perfection sometimes frustrates his business partner and 
wife, Melinda Pakzad, but it has earned Fari International Inc. a devoted 
clientele among Orange County's elite. 
</P>
<P>
"Clifford Heinz saw me tearing all those big palms out and he said, 'Fari, why 
do you do it?' " Fari recalled. "I said, 'It's not perfect.' He said, 'I just 
tell you one thing: Don't change. Don't ever change.' " 
</P>
<P>
Fari has no intention of changing. 
</P>
<P>
For 15 years he has worked to build his business, beginning with a furniture 
and accessory shop in Laguna Beach, where he began cultivating a following, in 
part by telling prospective clients not to buy the chairs or door-pulls he sold 
because they "weren't right." 
</P>
<P>
"We really wanted to make a reputation more than make a sale," Fari said. "We 
were convinced that if you really do good, money will come." 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, the clients he'd advised not to buy came back to buy -- and have 
their homes redesigned so those door-pulls would look right. Fari took on 
interior design jobs, then minor remodelings and major renovations. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't content with small windows or low ceilings or confining walls. So he 
knocked out walls and put in large bay windows, added sculptural ceilings, put 
in paneling and new stair railings. 
</P>
<P>
"You've spent $3 million or $4 million for an outdated house right on the 
ocean," Fari explained. "Two dingy little windows. So you open up (the wall) to 
that ocean, put the bed on the other side (of the room) so you can see the 
ocean while you're lying in the bed. Why did you buy this house to start with?" 
</P>
<P>
His ability to transform rooms into opulent and refreshing environments led to 
complete reconstructions, and finally full design, construction, furnishing and 
landscaping of multimillion-dollar estates. He takes the project from the 
empty-lot stage to fine china on the dining room table. He now has a full-time 
staff of eight, including architects, project managers and a staff contractor 
who work on home-building jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, Fari International has built six or seven homes, one 
Fari said was the highest-priced home sold in Orange County. His clients 
include Heinz, grandson of ketchup magnate H.J. Heinz and a retired 
industrialist and Richard Rodnick, president of the Geneva Cos., who has 
commissioned Fari for a third project. 
</P>
<P>
Though Fari won't reveal the firm's revenues, a full home project can cost up 
to $5 million. Interior design for an entire home can cost up to $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
And Fari knows that every dollar is for "this look," the rich style he creates 
painstakingly by calculating the effects of a hammered gold ceiling over a 
black lacquer table and the compatibility of granite slab floors and rift oak 
paneling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult for someone to understand what's gone into it," said Melinda, 
his 30-year-old wife. "Every single element that you see (in a room) -- be it 
the color or a wall texture or the shape of a pillow or the corner of a table 
-- has been thought out. A decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
"Fari is so demanding," Melinda added, toying with a teacup. "He agonizes over 
ever single detail. If this is a teacup he's trying to decide on for a house, 
he could sit here and analyze it for two hours." 
</P>
<P>
While his brother Bijan, the flamboyant fashion designer, caters to the nouveau 
riche from his boutiques on Rodeo Drive in Los Angeles and Fifth Avenue in New 
York City, Fari works relatively inconspicuously in homes in exclusive local 
neighborhoods, such as Big Canyon, Harbor Isle, Linda Isle and Irvine Cove. 
</P>
<P>
Fari and Melinda, who live in Corona del Mar with their 6-year-old daughter, 
are selective about for whom they work. They can afford to be; last year, Fari 
International had a four- to six-month waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
"And we don't advertise anywhere," Fari said. "It's all word of mouth." 
</P>
<P>
The look Fari's clients seek is best illustrated by the photographs hanging in 
his Costa Mesa showroom. No matter which house a photo depicts, the same 
classic lines and modern surfaces dominate, surrounded by the soft sparkle of 
silk and the glow of the lights that peek from corners and moldings and 
soffits. 
</P>
<P>
Fari labels it classic contemporary. 
</P>
<P>
"We're mixing the old with the new," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The chairs and sofas he and his wife have designed during the past 2 1/2 years 
for the Fari Classic Collection are adapted from English Regency and other 
antique styles. But the carved-wood chairs are less ornate and the down-filled 
upholstery is in plain silks -- no heavy brocades or floral patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Fari works primarily in naturals: ivory, bone, ecru, ebony. Color in a Fari 
interior is subtle -- mere splashes in the fresh flowers, a painting, the 
firelight, reflections on the mirrored wall. 
</P>
<P>
Fair sees an interior as a canvas. 
</P>
<P>
"Color is a very sensitive issue to me," he said. "When somebody says, 'I want 
lots of color,' I think of Denny's restaurant and Las Vegas, and that's 
definitely not something we do." 
</P>
<P>
Far more important to the wiry designer are textures, fabrics, shapes, lighting 
and architectural detail -- and innovative ways of blending them all in an 
exciting and surprisingly practical environment. 
</P>
<P>
In one home, for example, he installed 8-by-8-foot skylights, framed by soft 
lighting, that open with the touch of a button. In another, he covered one wall 
of a dining room with mirrors so guests sitting with their backs to the window 
saw the reflected view of the ocean and city below. Bronze beveled mirrors on 
wall sections also reflected city lights. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like you're sitting in a jewelry box," Fari said of the room. 
</P>
<P>
His search for unique materials and accessories takes him all over the world. 
Silks are imported from China and Thailand. Chairs designed by Fari are hand 
carved at a factory in Valencia, Spain. Tables with mother-of-pearl inlay are 
finished in the Philippines. Leather for one chair was custom-dyed in Italy. 
And pure wool, hand-woven rugs were imported from Tibet; one sold for $45,000. 
</P>
<P>
The materials give the furniture and accessories a look of richness and 
quality, but that's not Fari's pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
"Quality is not the issue," he said. "Quality is a given. What we are selling 
is this look, this flair." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps as important as the "look" is the relationship Fari and Melinda have 
with their clients. Before taking any job, Fari and Melinda sit down with a 
prospective customer and talk to see if they can work together. The Pakzads 
want to like their clients, particularly if the job is full home construction, 
which takes up to two years. 
</P>
<P>
"At least nine of 10 customers we talk to we don't end up taking," Fari said. 
"It's with a handshake. That's unheard of." 
</P>
<P>
Fari promises to deliver the job on time "on the budget or under the budget." 
They guarantee the cost up front so clients pay for neither overruns nor 
delays. The policy has not only earned Fari several repeat customers, but 
appreciative clients who lavish the couple with gifts -- once it was a 
chartered Learjet to San Francisco for a weekend of pampering. 
</P>
<P>
The Pakzads treat their clients likewise. In some cases, they finish a two-year 
home construction job with a catered dinner or black-tie party at the fully 
furnished home. For one client, they threw a birthday party at the construction 
site when the house was still in the framing stage. Guests were asked to come 
in jeans and hard hats. 
</P>
<P>
"Fari has an ability to see things in a scale that I can't see," Melinda said. 
</P>
<P>
But his visions are constantly refined as a room takes shape. 
</P>
<P>
"By the (end the rooms) are perfect," he added. "But yes, I change it 10 
million times in my mind."
