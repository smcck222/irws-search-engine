British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's popularity sank to the lowest level 
of her 10 years in power in two new polls. Only 24% of 935 voters sampled in a 
National Opinion Poll said they were satisfied with her performance, and 61% 
blamed her for last Thursday's sudden resignation of Chancellor of the 
Exchequer Nigel Lawson. Thatcher is lukewarm toward fully joining the European 
Monetary System, while Lawson supports it. A Harris poll found 50% of the 
respondents in favor of the opposition Labor Party and only 37% backing 
Thatcher's Conservative Party, with the others favoring minor parties.

Bowing to growing international pressure to protect Africa's endangered 
elephants from extinction, Japan formally banned all imports of ivory. Japan 
has been the world's largest consumer of ivory. The decision was announced 
after high-ranking officials of government ministries and agencies concerned 
with ivory trade endorsed an earlier agreement reached by Cabinet ministers.

An engine failed as an America West jetliner took off from Orange County's John 
Wayne Airport, but the pilot of the Boeing 757 was able to circle back and land 
safely. An airline spokesman said the 157 passengers aboard the Phoenix-bound 
plane were never endangered and that the landing was uneventful. The pilot 
radioed the tower to call out airport fire crews, but the plane was able to 
taxi to the gate without incident. Some witnesses reported hearing a bang or 
small explosion just after the twin-engine jet climbed off the runway. When the 
pilot realized there was a problem, he shut down the Rolls-Royce-manufactured 
engine on the plane's right side and banked to return for landing.

ERMAL CLEON FRAZE; INVENTED PULL-TAB OPENER FOR CANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ermal Cleon Fraze, 76, who invented the pull-tab opener used on beer and soft 
drink cans. Fraze, an engineer, was born on a farm near Muncie, Ind., and moved 
to Dayton, Ohio, where he assembled novelties for Cracker Jack boxes. In 1950, 
he started Dayton Reliable Tool &amp; Manufacturing Co. Nine years later while 
on a family picnic, Fraze had to use a car bumper to open a can of beer because 
he had no opener. Thinking there must be an easier way to open cans, he came up 
with the pull tab. Fraze obtained the first patent for a pull-tab can in 1963 
and said then that he was not the first to envision an easy-open can but that 
he was the one who developed a way to attach the tab to the top of the can. 
According to figures provided by his company, which receives royalties from the 
tabs' manufacturer, Aluminum Co. of America, about 150 billion easy-open cans 
were used last year. In Dayton on Oct. 26 of a brain tumor.

Count Alberto Marone Cinzano, 60, chairman of the noted vermouth and Spumante 
aperitif firm. The Cinzano family's labels date to 1757, when the aromatic 
liquor that years later was called vermouth first was produced in the back room 
of a small wine shop in Italy. The family's sparkling white wine, Spumante, 
became a major part of Cinzano's exports after World War II. Spanish police 
said Cinzano died in a crash near Cordoba on Friday when his car failed to

A woman in the Tulare County community of Pixley smashed a window in her 
family's burning mobile home and tossed her 2-month-old infant out to safety, 
but two other children were trapped inside and died, authorities said. The 
bodies of 3-year-old Steve Lenox Jr. and his 8-year-old sister, Amy, were found 
a few feet from the front door, county fire officials said. The children's 
mother, Sandra, had crawled through the broken window after throwing her infant 
out, deputies said. But when she and her husband, Steve, tried to get back into 
the burning structure to save the others, the flames held them back. Lenox was 
in serious condition at a Fresno hospital, and his wife was treated for minor 
burns and released.

RELIEF WORKERS ARE RELEASED IN MOZAMBIQUE; 
</P>
<P>
AFRICA: CONFLICTING REPORTS SURROUND EVENTS THAT LED TO THE DETENTION OF SIX 
MEMBERS OF A CARLSBAD-BASED HUMANITARIAN AID GROUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Six medical relief workers and their two guides were released without charge 
Monday by Mozambique amid conflicting reports about what country they were in 
and what they were doing when they were captured. 
</P>
<P>
Officials for the the Carlsbad-based Christian Emergency Relief Team maintained 
Monday that the volunteers, including a Chula Vista minister, were abducted 
last Tuesday while delivering medical aid in Malawi, the landlocked nation that 
neighbors Mozambique in southeastern Africa, said David Courson, president of 
the sponsoring agency. 
</P>
<P>
But Mozambique told U.S. Embassy officials there that the group had been 
"detained," not forcibly captured, for illegally entering the country, a U.S. 
State Department official in Washington said. And Mozambique's official news 
agency said one of the guides is a Briton linked to a group spying for 
anti-government rebels. 
</P>
<P>
The discrepancies seemed likely to engender even more controversy for CERT, a 
politically conservative aid agency. Although many private groups providing aid 
throughout the world attempt to refrain from taking sides in military and 
political disputes -- and Courson has said his group does not discriminate 
while handing out aid -- Courson has said his agency's efforts have keyed 
mostly on assisting victims of communist regimes. 
</P>
<P>
The six Americans were released to U.S. Embassy officials early Monday morning 
in Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, after each was "individually 
interrogated" by officials of the Mozambican government, Courson said. 
</P>
<P>
All six, including Ken Daugherty, the Chula Vista minister, were reported to be 
"physically OK," said Mike Pate, CERT's operations administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Daugherty's wife, Barbara, said Monday she was "very relieved" to hear the news 
of her husband's release, "like a ton is off my shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
Pate said the volunteers voted to return to Malawi, to finish their mission. 
The group is due back in the States on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
CERT officials have described the group's mission as providing medical 
assistance to refugees from Mozambique in Malawi. Last week, Courson said the 
volunteers were "there to help the civilian population of Mozambique, many of 
whom are fleeing a communist regime that has been supported by the Soviet 
Union." 
</P>
<P>
The Americans were supposed to have met Sunday morning in Maputo with U.S. 
Ambassador Melissa F. Wells, but that meeting never occurred, Courson said. 
Instead, the six were questioned through Sunday and Monday, then released to 
U.S. Embassy officials, Courson said. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department confirmed that the Americans had been released and were in 
good condition, spokeswoman Frances Jones said Monday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Daugherty, the group consists of surgeon Fred Leist, 48, and his 
wife, Lucille, 43, from Seattle; John Cannon, 69, a dentist from Davenport, 
Iowa; Steven Sherrill, 48, a paramedic from Stroudsburg, Pa., and Carol 
Roberts, 26, a paramedic from Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Courson last week identified the two guides as South Africans Peter Hammond and 
George Bezedenhout. According to Associated Press reports Monday, the official 
Mozambique news agency AIM quoted its foreign ministry as identifying 
Bezedenhout as a South African citizen but Hammond as a British citizen who 
lives in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Pate said he understands that Hammond and Bezedenhout were released to their 
respective embassies. Wire service reports said the two had been released. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond, AIM said, "runs a far-right, quasi-religious outfit called Frontline 
Fellowship, which is openly supportive of South African-backed bandit 
organizations such as UNITA in Angola and the MNR in Mozambique." 
</P>
<P>
Ian Grey, an Australian missionary who served 17 months of a 10 1/2-year prison 
sentence after confessing to entering Mozambique illegally, said after his 1988 
trial that right-wing American preachers were flown into guerrilla-controlled 
parts of Mozambique, via Malawi, after contacts with Hammond, the Associated 
Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond's brother, Derek, confirmed Sunday night on South Africa's state-run 
television that his brother founded the Frontline Fellowship but denied it was 
a front acting as a link to the right-wing Renamo guerrillas, who have waged a 
crippling war against the socialist government in Maputo, according to 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
Courson said Monday that he was "aware of (Hammond's) background. He has been a 
very good guide for CERT. And he is a missionary, first and foremost." 
</P>
<P>
The Americans met in London on Oct. 21 and flew to Malawi, Pate said. 
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, they were "detained because they entered Mozambique illegally," 
State Department spokeswoman Jones said, quoting information provided U.S. 
embassy officials by the Mozambican government. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Hammond confirmed that version of events in the Sunday night South 
African television interview, saying the group had "strayed across the border 
into Mozambique amongst the villages." 
</P>
<P>
According to United Press International, military sources said Saturday that 
the Americans were found traveling with supporters of the right-wing Renamo 
guerrillas. Officially, however, the government said only that they were 
detained after illegally entering the country. 
</P>
<P>
But Courson said the group had been "abducted" in Malawi by forces allied with 
the Frelimo party -- the ruling party -- in Mozambique, a former Portuguese 
dependency. That account, he said, came from "very reliable sources in South 
Africa" whom he declined to identify. 
</P>
<P>
"We are gravely concerned that we understand they were abducted in Malawi by 
Mozambican government forces," Courson said. 
</P>
<P>
Courson said he had a 20-minute phone conversation Monday with Daugherty, but 
the two did not discuss where the group was when they were taken. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Daugherty said she also spoke with her husband but they did not discuss 
the location of the capture. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't ask him that," she said. "I really didn't get into details about 
that. It was more of a relief type of call, 'Hi, how are you,' that kind of 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
The group was believed to have been flown Saturday from Tete in northwestern 
Mozambique to Maputo, Courson said. 
</P>
<P>
Courson was scheduled to leave San Diego on Monday afternoon, en route to 
Africa to join the group.

SOVIET ARTS FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
EMIGRES HAVE FAINT PRAISE FOR FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gula Yakhnich, who moved to the United States from the Soviet Union 11 years 
ago, said the Soviet arts festival can best be described with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
At least, she said, that's the feeling of one emigre. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm from Moscow, born and raised there," said Yakhnich, who with her husband 
opened a barbecue restaurant in Mira Mesa six years ago before selling it to 
play the stock market. "I've seen more and better stuff back there. Besides, it 
should have been called the Georgian arts festival, since that's what it is, 
isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
But Michael Hyat, a financial planner who moved from Kharkov in the Ukraine 
nine years ago has "only the most positive feelings" about the festival. 
</P>
<P>
"For Americans, it raises their awareness of and interest in the arts of the 
Soviet Union," he said, "and that is a very good thing." 
</P>
<P>
Some say ticket prices are absurdly high and the panoply of opera, dance, 
theater and puppetry has done little to assuage what, if any, homesickness 
still exists. Others complain bitterly that the office of Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor did little to include them in the festival, as participants or 
observers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the kind of festival that only the wealthy can take part in," said Lois 
Bloom, who resettles Soviet emigres for Jewish Family Service of San Diego. 
"They're saying it's for the community as a whole, but it just isn't so. It's 
far too expensive. A lot of emigres who wanted to go are out in the cold -- 
priced out." 
</P>
<P>
Bloom said that when representatives of Jewish Family Service called the 
mayor's office several months ago wanting to volunteer emigres in the planning 
of the festival, and to check on discount tickets, the immediate response was 
easy to figure out: 
</P>
<P>
It felt decidedly like a cold shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"A few ended up working -- unpaid -- as interpreters," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Downey, a spokesman for O'Connor, said, "Every group that contacted the 
mayor's office was treated equitably and equally" and that the nature of the 
festival work force was "strictly volunteer." 
</P>
<P>
Downey added: "We have well over 500 volunteers working in this endeavor. We 
took anybody who wanted to work, especially those who understood the language, 
the culture, the customs. . . . In fact, those people were sought out. I don't 
feel anyone's been excluded. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as tickets go, I had to buy my tickets. And, yes, much of the festival 
was Georgian by design. That doesn't mean it isn't a Soviet arts festival, 
which is how it's been advertised." 
</P>
<P>
Dolores Miller, co-owner of The Little Cafe, a restaurant downtown, grew up in 
Moscow as Rya Dolores Groodski. Miller's local mandolin orchestra volunteered 
its music for Super Powers Sunday, but, several months ago, she offered to be 
an interpreter and called the appropriate person, to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason," she said, "I never heard back -- from anyone. I hear now 
that some of the translators are being paid, that they were brought in from the 
outside. Maybe they thought San Diegans just weren't smart enough." 
</P>
<P>
Helen Kaminsky, who helps resettle the ever-growing community of Soviet emigres 
in her work with the Jewish Community Center in East San Diego, said she and 
"most of the people I know" are "disappointed and disillusioned" with the 
festival, known officially as "San Diego Arts Festival: Treasures of the Soviet 
Union." 
</P>
<P>
Kaminsky said most emigres wanted to participate because "a part of their 
hearts" remains in the motherland." 
</P>
<P>
"We all have roots there; we don't want to lose our ties completely," said 
Kaminsky, who moved from the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan nine years ago. "The 
good things still hold a place in our hearts. It's so easy to destroy, so 
difficult to build. We're trying to maintain our history, our culture, our 
language, and at the same time, we want to be Americans. We love it here. We're 
grateful to be here." 
</P>
<P>
Kaminsky said she had seen "Boris Godunov" and "loved it," but at a dinner 
Sunday night, she and other emigres complained about ticket prices they just 
can't afford. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of us are left out," she said. "The mayor's lavish festival is 
just not for us." 
</P>
<P>
Kaminsky said several months ago she contacted the mayor's office, hoping 
emigres could be involved in the festival, or at the very least, see its 
offerings at reduced rates. 
</P>
<P>
She said the answer was no to both. 
</P>
<P>
"At 4 p.m. Friday, two days before Super Powers Sunday, they finally 
acknowledged my request by saying I could have 150 tickets to the Georgian 
dancers," she said. "By that time, it was too late. What could I do on short 
notice? I did receive 100 free tickets for the emigres to see the Red Army 
Choir, but of course, that isn't handled by the mayor's office. I received 
those in plenty of time, and everybody's thrilled to be going." 
</P>
<P>
Hyat, the financial planner, said, "I went to see the San Diego Symphony's 
presentation of 'Alexander Nevsky' the other night, and thought it was 
wonderful. For me, as an emigre, it brought forth a momentous discovery -- that 
we, as San Diegans, have a right to be proud of an excellent symphony." 
</P>
<P>
Hyat said that "many in the emigre community feel excluded by the festival, but 
I can't say that I'm one of them. I'm only 25, so I relate more to being 
American, but many have deeper ties to the Ukraine, or Russia or Georgia, where 
so much of this art is from." 
</P>
<P>
Hyat said he had been to several events and found the Russian translations 
"hilarious and sadly lacking." He said the translators were capturing the "raw 
bulk" of the language but missing "most, if not all, of the subtleties." 
</P>
<P>
Phil Favelukis, who came to San Diego seven months ago from a work camp in 
Siberia, said he's been working as an interpreter. He said the opera and the 
play "Brothers and Sisters" were "marvelous" examples of the best of Soviet 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, he does not feel homesick. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, I applied to leave the Soviet Union, to come to America," 
Favelukis said. "Immediately, they fire me from my job in Odessa (near the 
Black Sea), remove me from my wife and children and send me to Siberia. I stay 
there for 10 years, waiting for the exit visa. 
</P>
<P>
"So the answer to the homesick question is no, 100% no. 'Brothers and Sisters' 
is a nice play, but it will never make me miss the place. Nothing will."

PORT CHIEF HURLS ROCKS FROM EXXON VALDEZ INTO FRAY OVER BAYFRONT ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After years of debating what kind of art belongs alongside San Diego Bay, Louis 
Wolfsheimer wonders if the answer might be right under the port commissioners' 
seven noses. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer, the San Diego Unified Port District board chairman, isn't sure how 
to put a price on the two Volkswagen-sized boulders that were recently 
extracted from the damaged hull of the Exxon Valdez. But pound for pound or ton 
for ton, he said Monday, the district would likely pay Exxon Shipping Co. a 
tidy sum for the chance to make one of the rocks into what he calls an 
"environmental monument." 
</P>
<P>
"Every time our people come up with a piece of art, the commission says it's 
too avant-garde," Wolfsheimer said, noting that the district has more than $1.5 
million set aside for public art expenditures, but has rejected most proposals. 
"I think a boulder in its natural state might work, even with a little oil on 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer's whimsical proposal would secure a final resting place for one of 
the rocks, which became embedded in the Valdez's steel hull March 24 when the 
ship ran aground off Alaska. But Exxon Shipping Co. officials, who are facing 
extensive litigation over the largest oil spill in U.S. history, say they 
aren't selling. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, it's not for sale," said Les Rogers, an Exxon Shipping Co. 
spokesman, who said he knew of no plans to put either the 6-ton or the 10-ton 
boulder on display. "I wouldn't see any particular advantage to the company in 
doing that. Exxon intends to maintain possession until litigation is over, 
years down the road. Then, who knows." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon's resistance to making the boulders available is consistent with the Port 
District's foiled attempts to buy public 
</P>
<P>
art. Last year, the Port District's arts advisory committee, a six-member, 
blue-ribbon panel, resigned en masse. Their gripe: in four years, the advisory 
committee had recommended three artworks, all of which the port commissioners 
either rejected or revised so drastically that the artist withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Port District accepted two sculptures without its art 
committee's help. Hugh Davis, director of the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary 
Art and a former member of the arts committee, called one of the pieces, a 
bronze casting of Charles Lindbergh, a "gratuitous piece of kitsch." 
</P>
<P>
By offering to mount the boulder on a pedestal, Wolfsheimer said, he meant no 
affront to the art world. And, to environmentalists like Rick Nadeau of 
Greenpeace Action, who said he chafes at the idea of turning the Exxon Valdez 
into a tourist attraction, Wolfsheimer responded: "It was supposed to be fun, 
educational, historical -- a way to remind people what can happen when you're 
not careful." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Wolfsheimer questioned how Exxon can claim ownership of what he 
calls "the most famous boulders in the last century," which are being stored in 
locked steel boxes at the National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co., where the 
Valdez was built and now is being repaired. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine how they own it," he said. "The Exxon Valdez was built in San 
Diego, it is being repaired in San Diego -- there's a great connection between 
San Diego and the ship. If we don't get (the boulder), it should be placed in 
Alaska, where the Valdez picked it up." 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer imagines that, if the Port District paid, say, $50,000 for a 
massive piece of history, the money could go toward cleanup of the spill. But, 
if Exxon won't part with it, he said, he's not going to fight. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't my life's work," he said. "There's a lot of things we have to 
accomplish at the port, and one of them is not suing Exxon."

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUPLE DIES WHEN CAR CAREENS OFF FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A car went out of control and rolled down a 70-foot freeway embankment south of 
Palmdale Sunday night, killing a man and woman, the California Highway Patrol 
reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were unaware of the accident until Monday afternoon, when the 
wreckage was sighted in thick brush east of the Antelope Valley Freeway near 
the Pearblossom Highway off-ramp, officials said. The crash apparently occurred 
at 8:54 p.m. Sunday -- the time and day on the dead driver's watch, which was 
broken in the accident, Officer Ruben DeAvila said. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the victims, both Lancaster residents, were withheld until 
relatives could be notified. The driver, a man about 36 years old, and the 
44-year-old female passenger apparently died instantly, DeAvila said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators determined that the driver drifted into the dirt-covered center 
while headed north on the freeway and lost control, with the car rebounding 
onto the freeway at a 45-degree angle. It went over the side of the freeway, 
became airborne and flipped end-over-end upon landing, coming to rest on its 
wheels, DeAvila said.

A moving-van fire killed a 31-year-old San Diego man, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The body of employee Robert William Knauer was discovered by firefighters, who 
extinguished the 10:12 p.m. fire Sunday in the back of a Starving Students 
Movers truck, parked in the 5100 block of Viewridge Court, a San Diego police 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of the victim said Knauer climbed into the back of the truck and fell 
asleep while smoking a cigarette, spokesman Dave Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire investigators said the fire was accidental and started when a smoldering 
cigarette ignited.

SUSPECT HURT AFTER DRUG SALE GOES AWRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego man suspected of selling methamphetamine was seriously injured 
Monday afternoon after attempting to flee federal drug agents when an 
undercover purchase in Pacific Beach went awry. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Anderson, 32, of San Diego was listed in serious condition Monday night 
at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, but it was unclear whether his head 
wound resulted from one of four shots fired at him by federal Drug Enforcement 
Administration agents or from being tackled as he tried to escape, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
No agents or passers-by were hurt in the 3:15 p.m. incident along the busy 1100 
block of Garnet Avenue in Pacific Beach. 
</P>
<P>
An undercover agent had arranged to purchase four pounds of methamphetamine for 
$30,000 in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant along Garnet Avenue, said 
Charles Hill, DEA special-agent-in-charge in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hill, other agents positioned nearby, who were listening to the 
conversation transmitted by a hidden microphone worn by the undercover officer, 
heard the suspect say that, if any problems developed, he would shoot the 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
When the agent flashed the arrest signal to his colleagues, the suspect tried 
to flee in a Volkswagen sedan, DEA agent Jim Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks said other agents gave chase immediately, one using his car to smash into 
the suspect's car and force it into the parking lot of another fast-food 
restaurant in the same block. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, another agent running up alongside the car saw a gun in the 
(hand of the) suspect so fired twice but missed as far as we know," Hicks said. 
The suspect jumped out of his car and ran through the restaurant parking lot as 
a second agent fired two shots before tackling the suspect, Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know whether the suspect was (wounded) by broken glass from the car 
crash or from being tackled" or from being shot, Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
Agents later went to the suspect's apartment in San Diego, where they found a 
dismantled methamphetamine lab, Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of evidence at the apartment, agents were fanning out to other 
locations late Monday, and Hicks expected that there would be more arrests. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still unfolding," Hicks said Monday night.

CHILDREN'S MUSEUM PLAN IS CONFIRMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan to make the Children's Museum of San Diego the primary tenant in Balboa 
Park's historic House of Charm was formally approved Monday by the San Diego 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The museum will occupy most of the 48,000 square feet in the 74-year-old 
building when renovations to the crumbling structure on Balboa Park's 
prestigious Prado are completed between 1991 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Art Institute will take up 7,500 square feet, 4,000 of it on the 
ground floor, and the Old Globe Theatre will use a 16,600-square-foot 
sub-basement, to be excavated at city expense, for rehearsal space. The city 
will pay for the work because it will bolster tourism, said Dave Twomey, 
assistant director of the city's Park and Recreation Department. 
</P>
<P>
The 9-0 vote, which formalized a plan endorsed by the council Oct. 16, fulfills 
a pledge made by Mayor Maureen O'Connor during her January State of the City 
address to create a children's museum and workshop in the House of Charm as 
part of a 1989 "Year of the Child." 
</P>
<P>
It also ends a sometimes bitter competition among city cultural institutions 
for coveted space along the park's well-traveled main boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Renovations to the House of Charm are part of a massive overhaul of the park 
being financed by a 1-cent increase in the city's hotel-room tax. The total 
cost of park renovations will exceed $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Under the council-approved plan, the San Diego Hall of Champions has 180 days 
to decide whether it will move to the park's Federal Building, where it would 
undergo a major expansion financed by a $4-million donation. If that happens as 
expected, the Mingei International Museum of World Folk Art would then move 
into the Hall of Champions' vacated space in the Casa de Balboa. LEONARD

DUMPED GRAVEL SLOWS SIMI VALLEY FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A truck dumped 20 tons of gravel on the Simi Valley-San Fernando Freeway in 
Simi Valley on Monday, closing two westbound lanes and causing a slow morning 
commute for some motorists, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries in the 6 a.m. accident, which occurred near the Tapo 
Street overpass, said CHP Officer Jim Utter. 
</P>
<P>
The gravel was dumped when the bottom doors of a tractor-trailer rig came open, 
Utter said. The driver's name was unavailable and officers late Monday had not 
determined why the doors opened. 
</P>
<P>
The gravel spilled across all three westbound lanes, but only two lanes were 
closed during the cleanup, which lasted more than an hour. Utter said traffic 
slowed, but the backup was minimal because most morning rush-hour traffic in 
the area is eastbound.

OFFICER COMES HOME TO 4 BURGLARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An off-duty California Highway Patrol officer returned to his Palmdale house 
Monday and surprised four burglars, shooting one of them in the arm, 
authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
The officer, his wife and two children, whose names were not released, came 
home shortly after 6 p.m. to find the draperies, which they had left open, 
drawn shut, CHP Officer Jill Angel said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer instructed his wife to take the children and call Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputies. He then entered the house, Angel said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer ordered the two male and two female burglars to freeze, Angel said. 
When one of them reached for his waistband, the officer fired two shots, 
hitting one of the men in the arm. All four dropped to the floor and 
surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded man, who was not seriously hurt, was taken to Palmdale Hospital 
Medical Center. The other three were in custody at the Antelope Valley 
sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
The officer and his family were uninjured. The suspects were not identified.

More than 3,500 people homeless, 1,500-plus homes destroyed, 24 businesses 
employing 500 people displaced and at least 7,000 mature trees destroyed in El

You should be ashamed for endorsing such destruction without first doing your

to be much more effective in moving people and goods, cost much, much less and 
that don't destroy the integrity of 100-year-old commmunities, like freeways 
do.

MURKY WATER ISSUE NEEDS CLEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Old-style fears and jealousies are threatening to unravel a critical water 
agreement that would benefit farmers in the Imperial Valley and urban dwellers 
throughout Southern California. Both the Imperial Irrigation District and the 
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California must realize that they have 
too much to lose if their pact of nearly one year ago falls apart. 
</P>
<P>
The 500,000-acre Imperial district is under order from the state to conserve 
water. Metropolitan has agreed to pay $223 million to Imperial to construct the 
needed conservation facilities. In return, Metropolitan would receive 100,000 
acre-feet of the conserved water, which is part of California's apportionment 
of Colorado River supplies. 
</P>
<P>
A group of dissident farmers has raised new questions about the agreement, 
including fears of liability for environmental damage that the program might 
cause and the potential loss of control over their supplies to the giant urban 
water agency. The farmers are pressuring the Imperial board of directors to 
reopen negotiations with Metropolitan. 
</P>
<P>
Another complication is that the Coachella Valley Water District, which draws 
on the same Colorado sources, wants assurance that its rights will not be 
impaired. The Metropolitan-Imperial deal expires Dec. 31 if the two agencies 
fail to agree on implementation of the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The Imperial board will hold a special hearing on Friday to hear from the 
dissident farmers and consider a proposal to safeguard Coachella's rights. The 
Coachella board will meet next Tuesday and the Met board on Nov. 14. The 
agencies should make every effort to settle their differences by the end of the 
year or the issue could become embroiled in legal action that might ultimately 
jeopardize everyone's claim on California's Colorado River supplies. This water 
fight should be settled at the negotiating table, not at the bar.

STILL A HARD LINE IN EAST GERMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
East German officials invited people to speak their minds this week, and scores 
who did so at the East Berlin City Hall responded with a jolting five hours of 
indignation, abuse and demands for political change. The public forum, one of a 
number in different cities, was meant to be a controlled alternative to the 
demonstrations that have swept the country in recent weeks. Authorities, 
however, could hardly have anticipated how intense an outpouring of scorn and 
bitterness they would be subjected to. Sunday's rally, and Monday's mass 
protests in Leipzig and other cities, leave no doubt that East Germany has 
become a land of seething discontent. 
</P>
<P>
What will it all lead to? Beyond some safety-valve measures already promised by 
Egon Krenz, the new head of the Communist Party, it's hard to discern any signs 
of impending major change. Travel restrictions, including those imposed after 
the mass flight to the West by East German travelers to Hungary and 
Czechoslovakia, are to be eased. The party is prepared to engage in more 
"dialogues" with non-party groups and individuals. And that for now is pretty 
much it. At Sunday's meeting, Gunter Schabowski, East Berlin's Communist Party 
boss, drew an unambiguous line. "The leading role of the party will remain," he 
pledged, and on that there will be no discussion. 
</P>
<P>
The party will not, in short, accept the course of reform forced upon its 
sister parties in Poland and Hungary. It intends to try to stand firm against 
the historic tide of change that is washing over the Soviet Union and other 
East European countries. 
</P>
<P>
The risks of sticking to such a course, if they aren't already apparent, are 
likely to be explained in detail to Krenz when he sees Soviet leader Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev this week in Moscow. Gorbachev has been advising more liberal 
policies in East Germany, and has become something of a popular hero there as a 
result. It would be surprising against this background if Krenz's trip didn't 
raise expectations among his countrymen of better times to come. 
</P>
<P>
The real surprise would be if those expections were realized to any significant 
degree, given the party's seemingly implacable determination to maintain its 
monopoly on power, no matter what it hears from the people it claims to 
represent.

The Times' editorial "A Gap That, Sadly, Must Be Filled" (Oct. 18) sounds like 
crocodile tears for the residents of South Pasadena and El Sereno, shed by the 
people living to the north of them. Why are people in inner areas always asked 
to sacrifice for the convenience of people in the outer areas? 
</P>
<P>
It is not that the residents of the impacted communities are unwilling to have 
people from other areas passing through -- just that they do it in a more 
civilized manner. The residents have made it clear that they would support rail 
freight instead of trucks, and light rail for commuters instead of highway 
lanes for cars. 
</P>
<P>
The editorial builds the best possible case for the link, but the case is 
inherently weak. How could this link not generate additional traffic? Whether 
or not more growth will occur around the gap is irrelevant. The trips originate 
in the hinterlands where growth is occurring; the freeway link would stimulate 
further growth to generate the trips to more than fill the new freeway link. 
</P>
<P>
Even the idea that free-flowing traffic generates less pollution is fanciful. 
</P>
<P>
Inclusion of mass transit in plans for the freeway should be recognized for 
what it is: a sugar coating for a bitter pill. A real mass transit solution 
would omit the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The Times has an excellent record of support for endangered species, but the 
freeway is a dinosaur that has caused enough problems already. Extinction is a 
fitting end.

GOVERNMENT GASPS ITS LAST AS DEBT AND POLITICS THRIVE; 
</P>
<P>
NATION: THE PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS POSTURE FOR THEIR OWN POLITICAL 
BENEFIT WHILE OUR FEDERAL SYSTEM BLEEDS DRY. NOTHING WORKS BECAUSE THERE'S NO 
MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID S. BRODER, David S. Broder is a syndicated columnist in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few years back, one New Yorker remarked that for 25 years, "the New York 
Times had reported everything that happened in the New York City schools except 
that they were collapsing." The same thing can be said of most of the 
Washington press corps and the national government today. 
</P>
<P>
Truth is, few Washington reporters know much, or care much, about what goes on 
inside government. We write about scandals when they are gamy enough and about 
the handful of policy fights that pit the White House against Congress, like 
the battle over capital-gains taxes. But the question of whether government is 
working well -- or working at all -- is not one that usually draws our 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
Today, by almost any measure, government is working very badly, so badly in 
fact that even journalists are beginning to notice it. When Stanley W. Cloud, a 
veteran reporter and editor, took over recently as Washington bureau chief of 
Time magazine, he persuaded his editors to do a cover story headlined "Is 
Government Dead?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer, Cloud's story said, is that if government is not dead, it 
increasingly "looks like a costly irrelevancy today . . . . Under the shadow of 
a massive federal deficit that neither political party is willing to confront, 
a kind of neurosis of accepted limits has taken hold from one end of 
Pennsylvania Avenue to the other." Whether the challenge is an oil spill in 
Alaska or a hurricane in South Carolina, an abortive coup in Panama or a 
democratic revolution in Eastern Europe, the government's response is slow, 
grudging and massively inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
When confronted by a crisis or even an unexpected opening, it fumbles. And on 
the larger, long-term challenges -- things like the decline of the schools, the 
deterioration of our transportation system, the scourge of drugs and the steady 
accumulation of unpaid debt -- its tendency is to postpone hard choices and 
posture rather than produce. 
</P>
<P>
The explanation is twofold. What we choose to call a government is no such 
thing. In our era of debilitated political parties, Washington is run by 536 
individual political entrepreneurs -- one President, 100 senators and 435 
members of the House -- each of whom got here essentially on his own. Each 
chooses the office he seeks, raises his own money, hires his own pollster and 
ad-maker and recruits his own volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Each of them is scrambling to remain in office, no matter what. And each of 
them has commitments and objectives he considers paramount. When George Bush 
says, "Read my lips," each member of Congress replies, "I want mine." And the 
result is the paralysis of which Time wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The second part of the story is laid out in the October issue of a magazine 
called Government Executive, a sort of trade paper for the bureaucracy. In a 
piece called "Hollow Government," writer Mark L. Goodstein cites example after 
example of how the budget cuts of the 1980s have left "federal agencies 
increasingly unable to perform the missions for which they were created." 
</P>
<P>
His story is a compendium of examples of government struggling with outmoded 
equipment and inadequate staffing. A former Internal Revenue Service 
commissioner says the IRS computer system "is somewhere in the Ice Age." At a 
time when the nation is aging and new programs for the elderly are being 
enacted, the Social Security Administration has had a 20% cutback in personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The root of this problem is that Presidents and Congresses in this decade have 
lacked the courage to ask people to pay for the government services they 
receive. This year's budget fiasco compounds the hypocrisy. When the political 
cowards in the Bush Administration and on Capitol Hill decided last month it 
was easier to admit failure than to reach agreement on a budget, that triggered 
automatic, across-the-board cuts in hundreds of domestic and military programs. 
</P>
<P>
No one seems to know or care what the $16 billion in cuts will do to the people 
who depend on those services. The President and Congress are engaged in a 
conspiracy of silence to keep the public from putting the blame where it 
belongs. 
</P>
<P>
But those cuts guarantee that a "hollow government" will be further drained of 
the talent, the energy and the equipment it needs to do its job. When the 
complaints come in, the politicians will do what they always do: Blame the 
bureaucrats. "Is government dead?" The answer is that it might as well be, so 
debilitated and demoralized has it become.

THIS PENCIL-PUSHER WITH A BADGE WANTS TO HIT THE STREETS AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
POLICE: THE UNION'S EFFORT TO PREVENT CHIEF GATES FROM ASSIGNING DESK COPS TO 
UNIFORM WORK GIVES THE WHOLE FORCE A BLACK EYE WITH THE PUBLIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MEYER, Greg Meyer is a senior detective with the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Please let it be a Halloween nightmare. Wake me when it's over. The cops can't 
do police work because their union won't let them. 
</P>
<P>
This is the city. I carry a badge. And a gun. And I make more than $50,000 a 
year to sit at a desk at Parker Center. Three months ago I wrapped up a tour 
working the burglary detail at Hollywood. Put a lot of deserving folks behind 
bars. But I can't do police work any more. Got promoted (more money). Got 
better hours and a big desk at Parker Center. With an in-box, even. 
</P>
<P>
I have more than 13 years of police experience and just about that many 
different assignments as a uniformed cop, a detective, a supervisor and a 
pencil-pusher. So a casual observer might think that I and those like me are 
ready, willing and able to do whatever police work needed to be done, wherever 
and whenever our services were required. A lot of us, in fact, pride ourselves 
on the fact that we can still get out on the street, at age 40-plus, and mess 
with them that need messing with. 
</P>
<P>
So comes the time that Chief of Police Daryl Gates has the radical idea that in 
order to get more working cops on the street, he will require a good number of 
us indoor types to get out of the office a couple of times a month, put on the 
uniform and do basic police work. Help people. Crush crime. Put bad guys in 
jail. All that stuff we used to do that motivates every rookie cop who puts on 
the badge. 
</P>
<P>
Chief, how could you be so naive? Did you really think that well-trained, 
highly paid desk cops would be allowed to put down their pencils and do . . . 
police work? Sorry, Chief. Life isn't that simple in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Our union, the Los Angeles Police Protective League, whose motto is "Protecting 
Those Who Protect and Serve Others," has gone to war with Gates to keep us off 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
The union even went to court and tried (though it failed) to block Gates from 
putting hundreds of extra officers on the streets tonight to prevent a repeat 
of last year's Halloween near-mayhem in the Hollywood area. 
</P>
<P>
Well, union, though the benefits you have negotiated for us over the years are 
appreciated, I'm not feeling real protected right now. And a lot of my friends 
aren't, either. And the public . . . well, you union folks are supposed to 
protect the cops, not the public, so what do you care? 
</P>
<P>
The past few days I've listened. In the elevator, in the hallway, out in the 
woods at a tactical training day. What I hear is a little grumbling about the 
chief's plan and the words he chose to chastise those who don't want police 
work to interfere with their personal lives. But mostly I hear, "The union blew 
this one." 
</P>
<P>
I can't speak for all non-uniformed cops. Some of them really do have jobs that 
are so critical (or so undercover) that it would make no sense for them to 
participate in an occasional uniformed assignment. 
</P>
<P>
And I won't speak for those few who have the attitude that "they can't do this 
to me: I don't even have a uniform any more." (Never mind that every officer is 
required to maintain a uniform. Never mind that the Los Angeles Police 
Protective League negotiated into our contract a tax-free check paid each June 
to every officer to maintain uniform and equipment, said check having been $550 
this year.) 
</P>
<P>
My union directors have decided that the chief is in violation of some 
administrative law about wages, hours and working conditions when he orders 
police officers to do police work. 
</P>
<P>
Did the chief say we have to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week? Did he say 
we can't have meal breaks? Did he say we have to work overtime for free? No. He 
just said we have to put on the uniforms we're supposed to have, and go out and 
do what we swore to do when we raised our right hands. For that, our union gets 
a court order to stop him, the rationale being that the chief didn't consult 
the union first. 
</P>
<P>
I can't speak for everyone, but I can speak for me. Attention, union: This 
stinks. 
</P>
<P>
Any able-bodied, able-minded, badge-carrying, gun-carrying police officer who 
chooses to hide behind a bunch of misguided union officials and their lawyers 
moaning about requirements to "meet and confer" before I go out to do police 
work, will do so without my support. And stand by while the public burns our 
behinds next time we ask for more benefits. 
</P>
<P>
This is worse than a nightmare. It's a professional embarrassment.

REFURBISHED ARMORY TO BECOME ART CENTER; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: SCHOOLCHILDREN AND PROFESSIONAL ARTISTS WILL SHARE FACILITIES IN THE 
FORMER NATIONAL GUARD BUILDING IN PASADENA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The roof leaked, a thick layer of tar blacked out the skylights, rust coated 
the steel support beams overhead. The wooden floor buckled, trash festered in 
piles, and now and then a ceiling tile broke loose and smashed onto the floor 
22 feet below. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a hole, a pit," Elisa Crystal said. 
</P>
<P>
She was talking about the California National Guard building on Raymond Avenue 
in Pasadena. But after $638,000 worth of renovations and plenty of 
gallery-white paint, the structure, built in 1934, opens to the public Thursday 
as the spiffy Armory Center for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Crystal, executive director of the center, presides over an airy, two-story, 
21,000-square-foot building rehabilitated in a fashionable blend of High Tech 
and Art Deco. 
</P>
<P>
The renovated building is graced with skylights, a specially built maple floor 
perfect for dance performances, a 2,800-square-foot art gallery and a warren of 
sunny offices overlooking Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
The building is home to the former Pasadena Art Workshops, a 43-year-old 
children's art program that has adopted the center's name. 
</P>
<P>
"For years we have wanted a permanent site like this," Crystal said last week, 
as the pounding of hammers and the smell of fresh paint filled the building. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Crystal and others wheeled giant yellow plastic bins filled with art 
supplies into the north half of the building, where schoolchildren will take 
art classes. Meanwhile, artists and photographers streamed into the building's 
south half to ready an inaugural exhibit that will coincide with the building's 
opening Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Fellows of Contemporary Art and scheduled to run through Jan. 
31, the exhibit features works by 13 Los Angeles-area artists. Five of the 
pieces were specially designed for the exhibit at the center and will be 
dismantled after it ends. 
</P>
<P>
The Fellows held a preview party Monday with artists and the show's curator, 
Noel Korten, director of the USC Atelier Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Running the gallery represents a new challenge for the art program but one that 
Crystal said will benefit the children because of the "wonderful reaction to 
seeing art and making it." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the exhibition was a lucky break for the center, which planned no 
exhibits for at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fellows had a show planned that didn't work out, and we were finishing a 
building and needed a show," said Susan Caldwell, president of the center 
board. "It was kind of serendipity." 
</P>
<P>
So, while the Fellows planned the show, the center tackled other tasks. Among 
them was raising more than $1 million for the building's rehabilitation and for 
an endowment fund to cover annual operating costs. Those costs are expected to 
reach $500,000 at the new center, a $150,000 annual increase. 
</P>
<P>
Previously operated out of extra space in a school gymnasium, the art program 
served 20,000 schoolchildren last year with lessons at the gym, at various 
community centers in low-income areas and on school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
"Schools don't have a budget for the arts anymore," Crystal said. "Since 
Proposition 13, there are no longer art teachers in the elementary schools. 
They have in general one art specialist for the whole district." 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of the number of children served by the art program and needing a 
cultural center to complement the burgeoning retail development in nearby Old 
Pasadena, the city's Community Development Agency, which owns the armory, 
approached program operators four years ago. The agency proposed that Crystal's 
group renovate the old building and run its program and a new art gallery there 
in exchange for free rent. 
</P>
<P>
The deal wasn't as appealing as it sounded. 
</P>
<P>
The building, in a run-down neighborhood, had deteriorated without regular 
maintenance. In addition, the Pasadena Badminton Club, which had been renting 
space in the building for more than 50 years, objected to relocating and filed 
a lawsuit against the city. 
</P>
<P>
After the city agreed to pay the club's relocation cost, renovations proceeded. 
</P>
<P>
Center officials plan to celebrate the opening with a street festival from noon 
to 5 p.m. next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"In so many ways, it's more beautiful than what we envisioned," Caldwell said.

FOUNDATION FOR DISABLED RECEIVES $1-MILLION GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN S. SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Vista Hill Foundation has received a $1-million grant from a retired 
frozen-food entrepreneur to modernize its Vista Los Ninos Education Center. 
</P>
<P>
Sam and Rose Stein of Poway will be honored by the foundation in January when 
it renames the center in the Steins' honor. The center will receive $500,000 
for renovations and a $500,000 endowment for operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, nearly 200 disabled clients received one-on-one care in the 
deteriorating converted Grantville Elementary School on Decena Drive, which the 
center has called home for four years. 
</P>
<P>
The center, which began 19 years ago teaching 10 autistic preschoolers at St. 
Luke's Episcopal Church in North Park, cares for children and adults with 
developmental disabilities, including cerebral palsy, epilepsy and mental 
retardation. 
</P>
<P>
The center will use the million-dollar grant, the largest in its history, for 
remodeling and other improvements, said Liz McInnis, the center's executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
The private center, whose $3-million annual budget is mostly 
government-subsidized, allows disabled children and adults to remain in the 
community and out of state institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"The children at the center cannot be served in the public school system," said 
Marsha Alex Lubick, director of community affairs for the Vista Hill 
Foundation. "They are multiply handicapped children. Our goal is to reintegrate 
them back into the public schools' special-education programs if it is 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
"We place five to six children a year, and for us that's a success story," 
McInnis said. "Because we are here, we are keeping children out of state 
institutions and help keep these kids in the community." 
</P>
<P>
With a staff of 130 consulting psychiatrists, occupational therapists, 
psychologists and teachers, the center boasts a teacher-student ratio of 1 to 1 
for most of its special education, after-school recreation and adult day-care 
programs, McInnis said. 
</P>
<P>
The adult program, launched in 1980 with about six clients, grew out of a need 
to "serve disabled adults who needed more supervision than traditional programs 
were able to provide," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Today the adult program teaches more than 90 clients, ages 18 to 64, how to 
handle leisure time and basic living skills.

THE PREPS: THIS ISN'T JUST ANOTHER GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When comparing high school football rivalries in Southern California, there are 
few bigger than the one between Garfield and Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, they will meet for the 54th time before an expected capacity 
crowd of 25,000 in the East Los Angeles Classic at East Los Angeles College. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of the oldest prep football series in the state -- Roosevelt leads 
it, 28-19-6 -- and it attracts turn-away crowds every year. 
</P>
<P>
For East Los Angeles, the game is more than just a game between two local prep 
football teams, it is a weeklong event. 
</P>
<P>
Reunions, dinners, dances and fund-raisers bring together the community and 
returning alumni. 
</P>
<P>
But most of all, the game gives people a chance to show their pride in either 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"The game is a longstanding tradition in terms of family," Roosevelt Coach 
David Endow said. "When it is time for this game, you are either a Roosevelt 
supporter or Garfield. 
</P>
<P>
"I know of stories where a husband and wife attended the game together but sat 
on opposite sides because of their school pride." 
</P>
<P>
There have been many upsets and spectacular individual performances. In 1961, 
for instance, Mike Garrett, destined to become a Heisman Trophy winner at USC, 
scored six touchdowns for Roosevelt against Garfield. 
</P>
<P>
Garfield Coach Steve Robinson said: "I tell my players that they're playing 
family because they all know each other. It will be a game that they will 
remember the rest of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
This year's matchup, though, has a special twist. For the first time in 20 
years, a league title is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Garfield is tied for first with Huntington Park in the Eastern League with a 
4-1 record, 5-1 in overall play. Roosevelt is in third place with a 3-1-1 
league record and 3-3-1 overall mark. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time since 1969, this game will be for the league championship," 
said Robinson, whose team had a bye last week. "We both need to win in order to 
win the league title." 
</P>
<P>
Garfield, which lost an early-season game to defending City 3-A Division 
champion South Gate, 7-6, is led by standout senior running back Hilario 
Espinosa, who has 987 yards this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to get Espinosa over the 1,000 yard mark early," Robinson said. "We 
have had many great 1,000-yard rushers here at Garfield over the years, but he 
has a chance to be the first to do it in only seven games." 
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt is coming off a last-minute, 6-3 loss to Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, we go into this game progressing . . . getting better each week," 
Endow said. "But, I am very skeptical for this game. We are still looking for 
personnel." 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way for Roosevelt will be running back David Isiah and the passing 
combination of quarterback Javier Lopez and receiver Robert Cervantes. 
</P>
<P>
Endow, who played for Roosevelt in the middle '60s, knows that the Roughriders 
will have to stop Espinosa in order to win. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been sputtering on offense in our last two games," Endow said. "We 
have to be able to control the ball better to combat Garfield's relentless 
ground attack. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be an uphill battle for us, but regardless of the records of 
the teams going in, with this game, anything can happen." 
</P>
<P>
After seven weeks of play, there are five undefeated football teams in the 
City. One surprise on the list is Venice of the Western League. 
</P>
<P>
A big reason for the Gondoliers' success this season has been the versatility 
of Louis Jones. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-2, 200-pound senior has done it all for Venice. In the Gondoliers' 
20-14 win over Manual Arts last Friday, Jones, who starts at quarterback, 
passed for nearly 100 yards and rushed for a team-high 93. This season, he has 
already scored touchdowns as a running back and wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
On defense, Jones started at safety and made several touchdown-saving tackles 
of Toiler runners. He also recorded a key quarterback sack in the fourth 
quarter from a defensive end position. 
</P>
<P>
Jones also handled Venice's kicking chores with two extra points and a 40-yard 
average on four punts. 
</P>
<P>
It was only fitting that his second interception of the game clinched the 
Gondoliers' victory with one second left. 
</P>
<P>
According to City Athletic Director Hal Harkness, four schools requested league 
alignment changes for the 1990-91 school year at an open meeting last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A City committee meeting Thursday will consider the requests made by Narbonne, 
Canoga Park, Garfield and Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have a closed meeting to decide if there will be any moves made 
regarding their proposals," Harkness said. "If we do, any schools that will be 
affected by the changes will have a chance to respond Nov. 27." 
</P>
<P>
Narbonne, Canoga Park and Dorsey asked to be moved from the leagues they are 
in, and Garfield requested a major conference realignment involving Garfield 
and Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
In the Southern Section, Loyola will appeal a recent Catholic Athletic Assn. 
releaguing proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the addition of Santa Margarita, a 3-year-old Catholic school in 
Rancho Santa Margarita, the CAA came up with a redesigned league proposal for 
the Southern Section's committee, which will be submitted Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
In the proposal, Santa Margarita is in the large-school division with Bishop 
Amat of La Puente, Mater Dei of Santa Ana, St. John Bosco of Bellflower, 
Servite of Anaheim and Loyola, located near downtown Los Angeles; along with 
all-girls schools Rosary of Fullerton and St. Joseph of Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
The smaller-schools division consists of Alemany of Mission Hills, Bishop 
Montgomery of Torrance, Chaminade of Canoga Park, Notre Dame of Sherman Oaks, 
St. Bernard of Playa del Rey, Crespi of Encino and St. Paul of Sante Fe 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Jon Dawson said Loyola will appeal because of possible 
academic problems for its students. 
</P>
<P>
"We are appealing for the students' concern first and not for competition 
reasons," Dawson said. "The travel demands just do not make sense. 
</P>
<P>
"We are 65 miles from Santa Margarita, one-way, and 45 miles from Mater Dei. In 
the old alignment, St. John Bosco was our furthest trip and now it is our 
closest." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola, which competes in the Del Rey League, will have a chance to appeal by 
Dec. 5.

CHANG LOOKS AT HOME IN PARIS

<TEXT>
<P>
The last time Michael Chang played in Paris, he surprised nearly everyone by 
winning the French Open championship. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't surprising anyone anymore, but Chang is still winning impressively. He 
took just more than an hour to beat defending champion Amos Mansdorf of Israel, 
6-3, 6-2, Monday in the Paris Open. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Stefan Edberg of Sweden also advanced easily, beating Andrei 
Chesnokov of the Soviet Union, 6-2, 6-3. It was the heavily favored Edberg who 
lost to Chang in the French Open final in June. The crowds then belonged to 
Chang, but not this time. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was kind of a mixed crowd," Chang said. "Some were for Amos 
because he won here last year, and some were for me because I won at Roland 
Garros." 
</P>
<P>
Chang next plays Henri Leconte of France. Leconte, a wild-card entry because 
his ranking has dropped to 37th in the world, survived three set points in the 
first set and coasted to a 7-6 (10-8), 6-0 victory over Richard Matuszewski. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be easy against Henri," Chang said. "He is a guy with so 
much talent. I played him twice and lost to him twice. I just hope everything 
turns out well." 
</P>
<P>
Leconte had a back operation that sidelined him for almost six months. 
</P>
<P>
In other matches, sixth-seeded Aaron Krickstein had no trouble with Mikael 
Pernfors, winning, 6-1, 6-3, as the Swede made numerous unforced errors. Martin 
Jaite of Argentina defeated West Germany's Carl-Uwe Steeb, 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3). 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Zina Garrison needed only 46 minutes to beat Patty Murren, 6-2, 
6-1, in the Virginia Slims of New England tournament at Worcester, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Murren was a last-minute entry replacing Gigi Fernandez, who had to withdraw 
because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-seeded Conchita Martinez of Spain defeated Peanut Harper, 6-2, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Katerina Maleeva defeated unseeded Tami Whitlinger, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, 
in the first round of the Virginia Slims of Indianapolis. Whitlinger is a 
former standout at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"I got tentative and nervous after the first set and I wasn't letting myself 
play my game," said Whitlinger. "I was encouraged to know I could play that 
well against a great player, but I still have a lot of room for improvement."

COLLEGE DIVISION;

<P>
IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY LONG TRIP FOR AZUSA PACIFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Azusa Pacific University will travel a long way to open its men's basketball 
season. 
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars will represent the United States in the annual Copa de las Americas 
(Cup of the Americas) international tournament Nov. 6-11 in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-team tournament, which will also include five teams from Puerto Rico 
and teams from Belgium and Brazil, will be played in Rio Piedras, Mayaguez and 
Arecibo. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Pacific, a member of the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics, 
will play the University of Brussels in its opener Monday, then will play 
Mayaguez Tuesday and Arecibo Nov. 8 in pool play. 
</P>
<P>
Tournament officials have always invited an NAIA team to represent the United 
States, but Azusa Pacific is the first school from the West Coast to be 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked for a top 10 (NAIA) team and we're not a top 10 team but most of 
the top teams on the East Coast start their season earlier and couldn't fit it 
into their schedule," Coach Terry Layton said. 
</P>
<P>
Elon of North Carolina, an NAIA power, won the tournament last year. Azusa 
Pacific struggled to a 12-19 record in Layton's first year as coach last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Layton says his team was invited because of his association with Steve Veal, 
the NAIA director of championships who is also the NAIA liaison to 
international basketball. Layton is also on the national games committee. 
</P>
<P>
"(Veal) knew I spoke fluent Spanish and when he found out they had an opening 
in the tournament, he asked me when our season opener was and he said he might 
have an opening for us," Layton said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the trip to Puerto Rico will be a first for the rest of the team, 
Layton is no stranger to the Caribbean island. Two summers ago, he coached the 
Isabela squad in the 16-team Puerto Rican professional league that includes a 
few National Basketball Assn. players and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last 20 years, he has also coached internationally in 26 nations, 
among them Guatemala, Venezuela and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The coach said that each of the Azusa players contributed $150 toward the trip 
and the school raised most of the rest of the money necessary to play in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Although the emphasis during the trip will be on basketball, Layton said he is 
hoping it will be important to the team from a broader perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try to make it as educational as possible," he said. "We'd like 
to win the games but that's not the important thing." 
</P>
<P>
Layton has scheduled side trips to the world's largest radio telescope in 
Arecibo and to a fort, and the team will also give two basketball clinics. 
</P>
<P>
The players will not forsake their schoolwork while they are in Puerto Rico, 
either. The Cougars will take two hours a day for study hall and hope to use 
the computer system at the University of Rio Piedras to transmit their 
homework. During the trip, they'll be based at the school's hotel near the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
Not to leave out their fans back home, Layton said, a videotape of the team's 
tournament opener against Brussels will be flown back for a showing next 
Wednesday at the Azusa Pacific student union. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to share this experience with our students as much as possible," 
Layton said. "We think (the videotape) will give our students a taste of 
international basketball." 
</P>
<P>
But the basketball team figures to benefit the most from the experience. 
</P>
<P>
Layton said that using international rules will be a challenge for his team. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult, but it is a good kind of difficult," Layton said. "You can 
play good international teams and not have it count against your record. The 
international game is also different to play and that's a good experience. 
Being from the West Coast, we don't have an opportunity to travel 
internationally much." 
</P>
<P>
Layton said that the trip should also help develop team camaraderie for the 
rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's a real big factor," he said. "I think it can't help but help us 
down the line. When you're together overseas and you're living in the same 
rooms and traveling on the bus together, you really get a chance to know all 
the guys. There's nothing like a trip like this to get a team closer." 
</P>
<P>
The Occidental football team, which appeared to have the best opportunity of 
any college division team in the Southland of advancing to postseason play, 
might have lost that chance by losing to Whittier in a Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
It was a Whittier team that had been struggling with a 1-5 record, but the 
Poets defeated the Tigers, 26-16. The Poets were led by running back Ryan 
Rowlands, who rushed for 124 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped Occidental to 5-2 overall. 
</P>
<P>
The result was also surprising, considering Occidental's impressive wins over 
the University of San Diego and Claremont-Mudd the previous two weeks. The 
Tigers had been ranked No. 5 in the West among National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. Division III teams but figure to drop considerably. 
</P>
<P>
Now Occidental will have to set its sights a little lower. The Tigers will play 
host to Redlands, 4-3 overall and unbeaten in the SCIAC, Saturday night in 
quest of at least a share of their third consecutive conference title. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a return encounter against Whittier on Nov. 11 at Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
The most impressive college division football team this season may be UC Santa 
Barbara, which will take a five-game winning streak into its game against Menlo 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara, an NCAA Division III independent with a 6-2 record, scored its 
biggest win of the season last Saturday, a 51-3 rout of the University of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego had been 6-1, having suffered its only previous loss to Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State San Bernardino women's volleyball team is hoping to earn a berth 
in the NCAA Division III playoffs when the teams are announced later in the 
week. The Coyotes, who have a 22-8 record, have been led by junior middle 
blocker Tinette Vaillancourt, who was named most valuable player of the 
Occidental tournament last week. Vaillancourt is among the Division III leaders 
in blocks per game and kill percentage.

ROCKET FIRM LAYS OFF WORKERS AFTER LAUNCH FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Rocket Co., a Camarillo company whose first attempt to launch a 
58-foot-tall rocket failed when the rocket caught fire on the launch pad Oct. 
5, has laid off about 40 workers since the incident. 
</P>
<P>
But the company is looking for long-term financing and plans to develop and 
launch a second rocket, said company president James Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the laid-off workers, about 45% of American Rocket's work force, were 
hired as the company began flight preparations early this year. After the 
launch, the firm had no work for them, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
The new version of the rocket would build on the lessons the company learned 
assembling and designing the first rocket, which was destroyed when a faulty 
liquid oxygen valve led to a fire just as the vehicle was to lift off from 
Vandenberg Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
If that launch had succeeded, the American Rocket would have become only the 
third company to launch a private rocket. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said the new rocket will probably be simpler to operate and be more 
marketable to aerospace customers than the first, which was designed to give 
American Rocket information that would help in developing subsequent models. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said the company is talking with several potential customers who would 
pay to place payloads on the new rocket. The original rocket carried 
experiments for the Defense Department's Strategic Defense Initiative and the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
Among the changes being considered, Bennett said, is one that could save 
American Rocket tens of thousands of dollars it must pay the U.S. government 
for use of a launch pad and tracking facilities. Those costs totaled about 
$100,000 on launch day alone, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
Feeding liquid oxygen into the rocket's motor using a pump -- instead of 
relying upon pressure to force the oxygen into the engine -- would be less 
costly, Bennett said, because pressurizing the liquid oxygen before liftoff 
uses precious time while the rocket is on the launch pad. 
</P>
<P>
American Rocket might also develop a system for saving a new rocket in case of 
a fire like the one that destroyed the original. 
</P>
<P>
Like the first rocket, the new one will probably be designed for suborbital 
flight. And the rocket's propulsion module -- essentially the rocket minus the 
guidance system and the body -- could be used to form a multistage orbital 
rocket. 
</P>
<P>
The first rocket was named the "Koopman Express" for the company's co-founder 
George Koopman, who died in an auto accident in July. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said that, like that rocket, "whatever we fly next will have George's 
name on it."

FIRM AIMS TO CLOSE IN ON PACEMAKER SALES LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In mid-August, Siemens-Pacesetter Inc., a Sylmar manufacturer of heart 
pacemakers, got federal approval to start selling its latest pacemaker, the 
Synchrony. 
</P>
<P>
The device, which costs doctors $6,300, is the most sophisticated and expensive 
pacemaker Siemens-Pacesetter has yet designed. Chairman Alfred E. Mann believes 
that Synchrony will enable his company, the industry's No. 2 player with about 
25% of the $1.2 billion in annual worldwide pacemaker sales, to grab an 
additional 4% to 5% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
A big jump on the competition? Hardly. Before you could say "cardiovascular 
system," Medtronic Inc., the industry leader with about 43% market share, got 
federal approval to start selling its Synergist II pacemaker, which competes 
head-on with Synchrony. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Siemens-Pacesetter's ability to bring new products to market in 
tandem with Medtronic reflects its rapid growth over the past decade. 
Siemens-Pacesetter, a unit of the West German conglomerate Siemens AG, expects 
to post sales of $250 million for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, compared 
with $10.8 million in 1979, Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
Its surging sales lifted Siemens-Pacesetter from an also-ran to second place in 
the industry, and its growing stature forces Medtronic -- and the half a dozen 
or so smaller pacemaker companies -- to stay on their toes. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody views Siemens-Pacesetter as the competition," said Bernard F. 
McDonagh who follows the industry for the investment firm Piper Jaffray &amp; 
Hopwood in Minneapolis. "You've got Siemens behind them with deep pockets and a 
long-term commitment." 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: Siemens, with $30 billion in annual sales, gave 
Siemens-Pacesetter the go-ahead to build a $30-million, 208,000-square-foot 
plant about a mile from its headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Mann said that "our ambition is to catch up with Medtronic," but he 
acknowledged that "we have a way to go." Although Medtronic's sales, which 
totaled $742 million in the fiscal year that ended April 30, have slowed from 
their double-digit growth rate of the mid-1980s, they are still growing. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Medtronic, a publicly held company that must report its financial 
results, earns about 23 1/2 cents per dollar of sales before taxes, an 
exceptional profit margin that makes it easier to finance research and 
development of new products. Mann declined to divulge his company's earnings. 
But he said Siemens-Pacesetter enjoys about the same margin, which indicates 
its pretax operating income in fiscal 1989 totaled about $59 million. 
</P>
<P>
Carol D. Winslow, an analyst with the brokerage firm Dain Bosworth Inc. in 
Minneapolis, where Medtronic is based, said that while Siemens-Pacesetter has 
taken some business away from Medtronic, it is mostly snaring market share from 
smaller competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Siemens-Pacesetter is "probably hurting Medtronic, but they are not eating 
Medtronic's lunch by any means," Winslow said. 
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Americans will get pacemakers this year; another 18,000 of the 
500,000 who have them will need replacements. 
</P>
<P>
Pacemakers, which cost doctors between $2,000 and $6,500, help the heart 
maintain a steady beat by electrically sending pulses to the heart. Normally, a 
part of the heart called the sinus node conducts the heart's rhythm, slowing it 
down or speeding it up to match blood flow -- and thus oxygen needs -- to a 
person's activity. But when the sinus node's ability to pace the heart fails, a 
pacemaker is often needed. 
</P>
<P>
Early pacemakers (the first one was implanted in a human in 1958) simply kept 
the heart at a constant rate of 70 to 75 beats per minute, regardless of 
whether the patient was running or sleeping. They were "single-chamber" 
devices, meaning that their pulses were sent only to the lower half of the 
heart, where the main pumping activity occurs. 
</P>
<P>
About 75% of pacemakers sold today remain single-chamber devices. But the new 
versions can adapt the pacemaker's rate to the patient's activity level. Many 
do so with sensors that pick up the body's muscle activity. 
</P>
<P>
The other 25% of pacemakers are "dual-chambered" products, which send pulses to 
the upper and lower chambers of the heart for patients that need such help. And 
the Cadillacs of the business are the dual-chambered, activity-responsive 
pacemakers such as Synchrony and Synergist II. After they are implanted, 
doctors use a table-top computer to program the pacemakers, thus synchronizing 
the upper and lower chambers of the heart. 
</P>
<P>
Although filled with electronic wizardry, most pacemakers are smaller than a 
pocket watch and weigh just a few ounces. They are typically implanted between 
the breast and the collarbone, and doctors send a thin "lead" from the 
pacemaker through a vein and to the heart. The operation, which once took 
hours, can be done in 30 minutes, Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
McDonagh said it is too early to tell whether Seimens-Pacesetter's Synchrony or 
Medtronic's Synergist II is the market leader in the dual-chamber market. But 
Winslow said the Synchrony is technologically superior. 
</P>
<P>
Synchrony is "easier for the physician to program, it has a few more 
programming options and it's a little smaller," she said. Mann claimed that 
"our technology substantially surpasses" that of Medtronic. "It's concluded, 
even by Medtronic, that Synchrony is a superior product," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baloney, Medtronic said. The company's Synergist II is fully competitive and is 
even "outselling the Synchrony at the present time," said spokesman Dick Reid, 
although he declined to disclose sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
Medtronic has sued Siemens-Pacesetter in federal court in Chicago, alleging 
that Synchrony and one of Siemens-Pacesetter's single-chamber devices, called 
Sensalog, infringe on Medtronic's patents. Siemens-Pacesetter, which has 731 
employees, denies any wrongdoing. The trial is likely to start early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, 63, started the company as Pacesetter Inc. in 1969 with Johns Hopkins 
University, whose Applied Physics Laboratory was searching for ways to improve 
the longevity of pacemakers. After more than a decade of development, 
pacemakers still lasted only about 18 months before they had to be replaced. 
Today they typically last between five and 20 years, depending on the model and 
the patient's needs. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, a Portland, Ore., native, was running two Los Angeles companies that he 
had founded -- Spectrolab and Heliotek, which made power systems for spacecraft 
-- when he started Pacesetter. He had sold the two companies to Textron, with 
his share of the proceeds totaling $10 million, but continued managing them 
until turning his full attention to Pacesetter in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
His attention couldn't prevent the company from a run-in with the law in 1983. 
Pacesetter, its former president and two other executives -- not Mann -- were 
indicted on federal charges of paying kickbacks totaling up to $140,000 to 
doctors who used Pacesetter's pacemakers. The company and the executives later 
pleaded guilty or no contest and were fined between $2,000 and $40,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
Mann said most of the charges related to a program in which Pacesetter gave 
doctors discounts on Pacesetter pacemakers if they used the devices to replace 
patients' pacemakers, even if they were rival brands. Mann said he approved the 
program, and "we still don't think it was unethical, but it's technically a 
violation of the Medicare statutes." He said some of his competitors offer 
similar programs. 
</P>
<P>
The other charges involved some of the Pacesetter executives allegedly paying 
doctors in advance for clinical evaluations of their products. Mann said he was 
not involved in those incidents, which "were totally contrary to my 
directives." 
</P>
<P>
Brian M. Mann, Mann's son and Siemens-Pacesetter's chief operating officer, 
said the kickback case "had a negative effect, but not a major effect" on the 
company's sales growth. But he said it was not the reason that Siemens, which 
had made several unsuccessful attempts to invade the U.S. pacemaker market, 
bought its way in by purchasing Pacesetter in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Mann declined to disclose the purchase price. But sources said it was 
between $100 million and $200 million, with just under half going to Mann for 
his stake. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Siemens' backing, Mann won't predict whether his company can surpass 
Medtronic's sales before he retires -- or even when his retirement might be. 
But one thing is certain: For now, the company remains more than a heartbeat 
away from becoming the industry leader.

VALLEY EARNINGS: SOFTWARE TOOLWORKS POSTS BIG GAINS IN SALES, INCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Computer-game producer Software Toolworks said its fiscal second-quarter 
earnings and sales more than doubled from year-earlier levels. 
</P>
<P>
The Chatsworth-based concern said net income in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 
rose to $1.35 million from $579,000, and its sales rose to $5.77 million from 
$2.42 million. For the first half of its fiscal year, Software Toolworks' 
earnings totaled $2.20 million, up from $798,000, and its six-month sales 
soared to $9.94 million from $3.77 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company attributed the gains to continued strong demand for its computer 
games and other entertainment software, and to higher revenue from its software 
packaging subsidiary.

EX-SUN-TIMES EXECUTIVE SEEKS DAILY PILOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owners of the Orange Coast Daily Pilot are negotiating to sell the daily 
newspaper to former Chicago Sun-Times publisher Robert E. Page, who is 
reportedly interested in building a string of community newspapers in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Cheyfitz, president of the publishing division of Adams Communications 
Corp., which purchased the Pilot last year from Ingersoll Publications Co., 
confirmed that the company was negotiating the paper's sale. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been having some talks with Bob Page, and we might be able to conclude 
a transaction in the near future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheyfitz emphasized that a sale was not yet certain. He said that no 
discussions had taken place with any other potential buyer although Adams had 
received no less than a dozen calls from people wanting to buy The Pilot. 
</P>
<P>
A source who asked not to be identified said Page was seeking to acquire the 
Glendale News-Press, which is owned by game-show impresario Mark Goodson and 
managed by Ingersoll under a contract whose termination was announced Oct. 24. 
News-Press Publisher Judy Kendall declined all comment on the report. 
</P>
<P>
Goodson's newspaper operations reportedly are strapped for cash after 
purchasing the Morristown Daily Record in New Jersey two years ago for $155 
million. Goodson announced on Oct. 24 that he was selling the New Haven 
Register and terminating the long-standing agreement with Ingersoll to manage 
his newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Page, who heads a Boston-based company called Page Media, formerly was 
publisher of the Boston Herald and the Chicago Sun-Times. In 1986 he led a 
management buyout of the Chicago paper from its former owner Rupert Murdoch. 
Page could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Coast Daily Pilot, which primarily serves the Costa Mesa-Newport 
Beach area, has struggled with declining circulation and advertising revenues 
over the past decade. But Cheyfitz said a turnaround had begun since Adams 
purchased the paper. 
</P>
<P>
Circulation, which had dropped to 20,000 last year from 40,000 in 1982, has 
rebounded by about 3,000, Cheyfitz said. Display advertising and classified ad 
revenues also were up, Cheyfitz said, but he could not provide figures. 
</P>
<P>
The Pilot, which until 1983 was owned by Times Mirror Co., publisher of The 
Times, switched to being a morning publication earlier this year. Cheyfitz said 
Adams was "really happy with the progress" that had been made since the 
acquisition. He noted that the weekly community newspaper operations that were 
purchased with The Pilot -- the Huntington Beach Independent and the Fountain 
Valley Independent -- also were doing very well. 
</P>
<P>
Adams has launched new "Independent" weeklies in Newport Beach and Costa Mesa 
and won its battle with Baker Communications, which recently closed the weekly 
Newport Beach Ensign. 
</P>
<P>
Adams Communications, founded by soft-drink entrepreneur Stephen Adams in 1982, 
is based in the Minneapolis suburb of Wayzata and has holdings in radio, 
television, magazines and outdoor advertising in addition to newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
When the Pilot was sold to Adams last year, it reportedly was losing money, and 
the purchase price was not disclosed. Cheyfitz said that if the sale to Page 
was completed, it would be for significantly more than the price Adams had 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Churchman, publisher of The Pilot, could not be reached for comment.

Cultural institutions in the Bay Area earthquake disaster area have been given 
an extension on applying for grants from the federal government's Institute of 
Museum Services. The deadline for applications for money from the institute's 
largest program -- for general operating support -- was Friday, but it has been 
changed to Nov. 17. Meanwhile, the National Endowment for the Arts expects to 
establish an earthquake-disaster relief grant application for arts institutions 
there. The money -- $100,000 to $200,000 -- would be channeled through the 
California Arts Council. ALEENE MacMINN

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN;

<P>
YOUTHFUL GERMAN QUARTET SPARKLES ON A SOVIET GEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though the program book was not emblazoned with the now-familiar red logo of 
the San Diego Soviet arts festival, Saturday evening's Auryn Quartet concert at 
UC San Diego's Mandeville Auditorium did feature a minor treasure of the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
The youthful, visiting ensemble from Cologne, West Germany, opened the 15th 
season of UCSD's chamber music series with a compelling performance of Alfred 
Schnittke's Third String Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1934, Schnittke is considered one of the leading Russian composers from 
the generation after Shostakovich. At last year's Soviet arts festival in 
Boston, Schnittke's Requiem Mass for chorus and orchestra was one of the major 
musical performances of that cultural exchange. This UCSD event was not part of 
the current Soviet Arts festival, but the performance of Schnittke's work 
expands the festival's portrait of contemporary Soviet music. 
</P>
<P>
Schnittke's three-movement quartet, written in 1983, revealed that the composer 
is keenly aware of trends in Western European composition. Although his idiom 
is demanding, it is not daunting. Like Western composers who have taken their 
cues from Edgar Varese, Schnittke values sound for its own sake and tends to 
use sonic clusters as motivic building blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Though this approach made the Third Quartet's droning, modal first movement 
seem unusually static, the rest of the work was replete with contrasting ideas 
organized by a recurring dissonant chorale theme. The composer even included an 
agitated, highly motoric section that sounded like an homage to Shostakovich. 
If Schnittke's structure was elusive on a first hearing, surely his dense 
concentration of feeling was unmistakable. 
</P>
<P>
The Auryn Quartet (violinists Matthias Lingenfelder and Jens Oppermann, violist 
Steuart Eaton and cellist Andreas Arndt) followed the usual practice and 
surrounded this unknown contemporary work with two familiar offerings, 
Beethoven's A Major Quartet, Op. 18, No. 5, and his F Major Quartet, Op. 135. 
Neither performance shed new light on these works, although the A Major Quartet 
was notable for unusually clean delineation and a sunny balance among the 
players. Beethoven's Op. 135, however, received a perfunctory and sometimes 
ill-tuned reading. 
</P>
<P>
All that jazz. Although the surprises in the world of music resulting from 
glasnost cannot compete with the startling political events unfolding in 
Eastern Europe, they are worth noting. Tonight at Elario's in La Jolla, two San 
Diego Symphony guest soloists in town for the Soviet arts festival will hold a 
unique jam session. Russian pianist Nicolai Petrov and U.S. clarinetist Richard 
Stoltzman will play a program of American jazz for 150 friends and supporters 
of the symphony. 
</P>
<P>
These two soloists can be heard in their usual context Nov. 2-3 at Symphony 
Hall, when Petrov will play the West Coast premiere of Rodion Shchedrin's 
Second Piano Concerto and Stoltzman will perform American composer John 
Corigliano's 1977 Clarinet Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Batting 0 for 2. The San Diego Symphony has not been having any luck thus far 
importing guest conductors for the Soviet arts festival. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Soviet conductor Evgeny Kolobov failed to show for the orchestra's 
"Alexander Nevsky" production. Now this week, Soviet conductor Pavel Kogan 
canceled his Nov. 2-4 symphony concerts on account of illness. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Jansoug Kakhidze, San Diego Opera's guest conductor for its "Boris 
Godunov" production, was able to fill in for Kogan on short notice. One of the 
featured works on Kogan's program is Rodion Shchedrin's Second Piano Concerto, 
a work performed only a few times in this country. In an interview before 
"Boris Godunov" opened, Kakhidze noted that he was well acquainted with 
Shchedrin's concerto, and in fact had conducted it last year in Boston as part 
of that American city's Soviet arts festival. Kakhidze, creative director and 
principal conductor of Georgia's Tbilisi State Opera Theatre, received high 
accolades for his conducting of the San Diego Opera orchestra in "Boris 
Godunov." Local culture vultures eagerly await Kakhidze's symphony debut here. 
</P>
<P>
Music and the future. In the 19th Century, Richard Wagner immodestly claimed 
that he was composing the music of the future. Since Wagner's time, most 
composers have been content to write for their own era. UC San Diego's Center 
for Music Experiment, however, regularly works on the frontiers of tomorrow's 
music. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the center's current research will produce the next generation of 
musical computers, according to F. Richard Moore, the center's director. 
</P>
<P>
"These will be the first computers to have their musical capacity built in 
rather than added on," explained Moore, who will lecture on these new 
electronic tools and on the related topic of psychoacoustics (the perception of 
sound) at the La Jolla Athanaeum Nov. 6 . 
</P>
<P>
"Technology in Music and Art," the La Jolla library's current lecture series, 
began last night with a lecture by UCSD's Pulitzer Prize-winning resident 
composer Roger Reynolds. One of the founders of the center, Reynolds has 
composed many of his works using the center's computer facilities. On Nov. 13, 
UCSD art professor Harold Cohen will talk about his computer-collaborated 
artwork, and all three men will participate in a panel discussion on Nov. 20. 
</P>
<P>
According to Moore, in the last decade -- he came to the center in 1979 -- the 
most significant thing researchers have learned is how little they really know 
about musical processes. 
</P>
<P>
"At one time, it was common wisdom that, by analyzing the works of great 
composers, we could get a computer to write, say, Beethoven's 10th Symphony. 
This was one of many early misconceptions," Moore said. He further noted that 
breaking down seemingly simple musical expressions into the requisite series of 
step-by-step instructions needed for programming computers has usually turned 
out to be much more complex than originally thought. 
</P>
<P>
Though he was a composer before he became the center's director, composing has 
taken a back seat to his research and administrative chores. Moore now 
describes himself as a musical engineer, a term Wagner probably never 
contemplated when he was looking into the music of his future.

Tri-Star's "Look Who's Talking" has not quieted down yet. The romantic comedy 
finished No. 1 again with $11.5 million -- down 18% from last week -- for a 
whopping $45.4 million since its opening three weeks ago. Universal's Halloween 
offering "Shocker," directed by Freddy Krueger creator Wes Craven, grossed $4.5 
million on 1,783 screens. In its U.S. debut, Tri-Star's "The Bear" did not 
break the box offices records that it did in Europe last year. But the animal 
adventure story opened well on 858 screens for $3.6 million, a per-screen 
average of $4,285. 
</P>
<P>
* TV's "Family Ties" creator Gary David Goldberg made his directorial film 
debut to mixed reviews with Universal's "Dad." The bittersweet family drama 
took in $535,504 on 107 screens.

The Library of Congress has received $40,000 from the family of motion-picture 
pioneer Edwin Thanhouser to be used for the preservation of pre-1920 silent 
films and provide greater access to them for film scholars and the public. The 
Thanhouser Co. was founded in 1909 in New Rochelle, N.Y., and produced more 
than 1,000 silent films. The films have been found in private collections in 
the United States and in archives in Britain and Holland. ALEENE MacMINN

BAD CHECKS: While bouncing a check in Orange County usually costs $10 to $12 in 
extra fees, that's chicken feed contrasted with the $30 some Eastern banks 
charge (D6). . . . Local banks make up for it with some of the highest interest 
rates in the nation. One industry newsletter says a two-year unsecured personal 
loan costs an average of 20% here, highest in the United States. Rick

COURT REVERSES O.C. DRIVER'S MURDER RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An appellate court announced Monday that it has reversed the murder conviction 
of a drunk driver who killed a Fullerton mother and all three of her children 
five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The 4th District Court of Appeal ordered that the jury conviction for Michael 
W. Reding, now 31, automatically be reduced to vehicular manslaughter unless 
the Orange County district attorney's office decides within 30 days to retry 
him for murder. 
</P>
<P>
In their opinion, the justices stated, jurors never should have heard about the 
driver's possible cocaine use that day. "The prejudicial effect of drug use on 
a jury cannot be overestimated in today's war-on-drugs climate," Justice Thomas 
F. Crosby Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision drew strong criticism Monday from Robert F. Trueblood, who lost 
his wife and three children in the Fullerton collision. "I obviously feel the 
appellate court has made a tremendous mistake," he said. "The appellate court 
is not really interested in justice being served. They are just dealing with 
legal technicalities in court. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I have not read the transcripts of the case. But I've followed the matter from 
day one. I've been to court every day. I have witnessed the whole thing. The 
matter should be appealed to the state Supreme Court or retried. The D.A. 
should make sure that justice is done." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, greatly disappointed at the ruling, said they have not yet decided 
whether to retry Reding, and it is unclear what affect Monday's decision would 
have on how much prison time Reding will serve. 
</P>
<P>
"My inclination right now is to think we will retry him for murder. But it's 
premature to say just what we will do," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas M. 
Goethals, in charge of its writs and appeals section. 
</P>
<P>
Reding was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison in 1986 after he became the 
first drunk driver in Orange County to be convicted of second-degree murder in 
a vehicle collision. The trial became a focal point for groups seeking tougher 
jail sentences for drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Reding admitted that he had been drinking on the night of Oct. 23, 1984, when 
his car plowed into an oncoming vehicle on State College Boulevard, near 
Bastanchury Road in Fullerton. Killed were the other driver, 36-year-old Pamela 
Trueblood, and her children, Eric, 11, Kerry, 9, and Scott, 8. Two other 
children in the car with the Trueblood family survived serious injuries. Reding 
also has recovered from his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Reding testified that he had just changed a tape on his car stereo when he 
looked up and saw that he was approaching the car ahead of him too quickly. 
Witnesses said Reding was driving at a speed of more than 70 m.p.h. in a 45 
m.p.h. zone and tried to pass the car on the right shoulder. They testified 
that he then cut back sharply left to avoid going over an embankment, and 
struck the Trueblood car head-on. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he had coped since the collision and death of family, Robert 
Trueblood said Monday: "I draw my strengths from the Bible and through the Lord 
Jesus Christ. They both last an eternity. Without them, I don't know where I 
would have been." 
</P>
<P>
Trueblood said he has also been active with the Mothers Against Drunk Driving 
organization, which monitored the hearings and "kept me apprised all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Reding's lawyers did not try to dispute that their client was drunk at the time 
of the collision. But a hotly disputed issue was whether he also had taken 
cocaine that day. While cocaine-related chemicals were found in his system, 
there was evidence he might have taken the drug at an earlier date. 
</P>
<P>
Reding's prosecutor, Mike Jacobs, who has since left the district attorney's 
office, agreed before the trial not to raise the cocaine issue unless the 
defense did something to make it necessary in rebuttal. 
</P>
<P>
But Jacobs brought it up during cross-examination of Reding, claiming that it 
was a legitimate issue to impeach his testimony that he was able to drive 
safely. Superior Court Judge James L. Smith agreed to admit the evidence for a 
limited purpose: to determine if cocaine might have affected Reding's sketchy 
memory of the day's events. 
</P>
<P>
On rebuttal, Judge Smith allowed testimony of a drug expert who inferred that 
chemicals found in Reding's system showed he had probably taken some cocaine 
that day. Reding denied any cocaine use before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments, Jacobs told jurors that cocaine use made Reding more 
dangerous and speculated that he was probably on his way to buy more cocaine 
when the crash occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"The prosecutor effectively sank the defendant in a sea of white powder," 
Justice Crosby said. While Crosby called Jacobs overzealous, he also attacked 
Reding attorney Heidi Mueller for not raising more objections over the cocaine 
issue. While Crosby scolded both of them, he added that "this was both a 
difficult and emotional trial." 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court decision to reverse the murder conviction was unanimous. 
But Presiding Justice Harmon G. Scoville wrote a dissenting opinion because he 
disagreed with Crosby and Justice Sheila Sonenshine that the lawyers' errors at 
the Reding trial reached a level of "unprofessional conduct." 
</P>
<P>
The justices upheld Reding's conviction on a lesser charge of felony drunk 
driving at the same trial. 
</P>
<P>
Reding, an engineer at Northrop Corp., said in interviews before his conviction 
he thought that he should be punished for what he had done but that murder was 
too steep a charge for his conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Smith could have sentenced Reding to consecutive terms for each of the 
four deaths, amounting to 60 years in prison. But prosecutors did not ask for 
anything beyond 15 years to life, citing Reding's lack of any criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Goethals said a re-sentence on four counts of vehicular manslaughter 
ordered by the appellate court could amount to a sentence of as much as 15 
years. But the difference is, it would be a specific sentence, instead of the 
broader "15 years to life" that a murder conviction carries.

POSTERS: The latest news in AIDS education is an unusual high school poster 
contest sponsored by the Red Cross and Cal State Fullerton. . . . Promos take a 
jovial tone, featuring a smiling cartoon of "Andi-Body," who combats the AIDS 
virus. . . . But the purpose couldn't be more serious. Contestants must 
research "How Do We Stop AIDS?" -- which by last month had killed 719 people in 
the county. Because the topic is a sexually transmitted disease, students need 
parental permission to enter. . . . The contest deadline is today. Rick

SMALL YARDS: One reason that Orange County residents are sacrificing their 
yards to make room for ever-bigger homes on ever-smaller lots (D1) may be that 
gardening is less popular locally than elsewhere. . . . People here are 8% less 
likely to list gardening as a favorite activity than the national average. . . 
. In general, residents embrace such "good life" activities as real estate 
investments, foreign travel and collecting wine, while shunning such pursuits 
as automotive work, crafts, sewing -- and gardening. Rick VanderKnyff and Lanie

NURSES ACCUSE UC OF MISSPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Union nurses accused University of California hospital administrators Monday of 
misspending $29 million last year -- including $5.9 million at UCI Medical 
Center -- to hire temporary registry nurses. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders in the California Nurses Assn., representing all 6,000 UC nurses, also 
complained that the five university medical centers were willing to pay up to 
$43 an hour for temporary help while they paid their staff nurses only $15.50 
to $18.42 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the situation "a case study in how not to recruit and retain nurses," a 
union leader charged that fees paid to registries had increased at an 
"astounding" rate -- 640% over the previous year at UCI, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
According to the union, UCI's registry use jumped from $22,714 in 1986-87 to 
$791,141 in 1987-88. That figure increased to $5.9 million last fiscal year, 
union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital, which posted an $11.6-million deficit in the last fiscal year, 
has a regular staff of 837 nurses and a 21% turnover rate, the nurses' union 
said. Administrators at the medical center in Orange have blamed the deficits 
on the increasing cost of treating indigent patients. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief response, administrators at UCI Medical Center said they "do not 
believe that paying nurses more will eliminate the need for registry nurses" 
because registries are used for "short-term and sometimes spontaneous needs." 
</P>
<P>
Also, they attributed 60% of the "dramatic increase" in registry fees at UCI to 
a sharp increase last year in maternity deliveries and postpartum care. 
</P>
<P>
They also noted that the medical center's pay scale, which has nine graduated 
levels, was a response to the market, as well as to "our desire to reward 
long-term professional nurses." 
</P>
<P>
The administrators issued the prepared statement through medical center 
spokeswoman Elaine Beno but declined to reveal their names. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the nurses' union made their complaints one day before they are 
scheduled to hold a key bargaining session in Berkeley with UC negotiators. 
They said they had "uncovered" the registry budget figures during recent wage 
negotiations. Earlier this month, the nurses reopened their two-year contract 
negotiations, seeking a more generous maternity leave as well as wage hikes. 
</P>
<P>
According to the nurses, UCLA Medical Center spent $12 million last year on 
registry nurses, UC Medical Center San Francisco spent $5.5 million, UC Davis 
spent $3.7 million and UC San Diego spent $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
They complained, however, that "registries are meant to be used to fill 
short-termgaps, not as a regular staffing option," UC Davis nurse Katherine 
Sweeney said. At UCI, nurse Karen Fuchek warned: "They (administrators) should 
realize if they don't increase wages, a lot more nurses are going to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Fuchek said that UCI nurses had recently been offered a 3.5% raise in November 
and another 3.5% raise in May when "nurses really want 10% up front." 
</P>
<P>
She argued that using temporary nursing help was "wasteful" not only because of 
the expense but because "there's no continuity of care. They put them (nurses) 
on one floor for four hours, then another floor for four hours and mistakes can 
happen," she warned. "Medication errors, a lack of follow-through. An order 
written and the registry nurse doesn't see it." 
</P>
<P>
Rose Ann DeMoro, chief negotiator for the nurses' union, said the temporary 
nurses typically get paid time and a half for overtime and double time after 
midnight, whereas UC nurses are paid only straight time during those hours. A 
UC nurse may enjoy the high standards of a teaching hospital, DeMoro said, but 
frequently, after the nurse works alongside a registry nurse, the staff nurse 
may decide to quit and join the registry. 
</P>
<P>
Fuchek noted: "It's an easy solution to offer nurses more money to keep them. 
They spend so much on the registry. Why don't they spend it on staff nurses?" 
</P>

BREA COUNCILMAN TO TELL SENATE DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Brea City Councilman Ron Isles said Monday that he is "95% certain" he will run 
for state Sen. William Campbell's (R-Hacienda Heights) seat in a special 
election next spring following Campbell's announced resignation in January. 
</P>
<P>
Isles, who said he would reveal his final decision about the race on Wednesday, 
is the third Republican to express an interest in the seat, which straddles the 
boundary between Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
The others are Assemblymen Frank Hill (R-Whittier) and Gil Ferguson (R-Newport 
Beach). 
</P>
<P>
Although he has held only local office, Isles, 51, could be a strong contender 
because he is willing to spend up to $500,000 of his own money on the campaign, 
he said. Isles, a lawyer and former congressional candidate, said he expects 
the race to cost at least $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Isles also indicated that political ethics may be an issue in 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
"At a time when ethics and morals are high in the minds of the American people, 
it is my opinion the candidates who decide to enter this contest better not be 
carrying any political baggage," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Isles said the statement was not aimed at either Ferguson or 
Hill, both of whom have been accused of ethical violations. "All I'm saying is 
that anyone who goes for the seat is going to come under close scrutiny," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hill is under investigation by the FBI in connection with its Capitol Hill 
sting operation last year that involved influence peddling. Ferguson was 
accused in 1988 of not properly reporting some of his personal income. 
</P>
<P>
The three would be vying for the 31st District seat, stretching from Whittier 
to Mission Viejo. Campbell, the influential incumbent, announced last week that 
he will resign in January to take a job as head of the California Manufacturers 
Assn.

Isles has served about four years on the Brea City Council. He was elected in 
1980 and left in 1983. He was reelected to the council last November. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Isles was a declared candidate for U.S. Rep. William Dannemeyer's 
congressional seat when Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) indicated that he would not 
seek reelection. Isles said he withdrew his candidacy when Dannemeyer 
reconsidered and ran.

Isles also was considered by the governor in 1987 to fill a vacancy on the 
County Board of Supervisors when Bruce Nestande resigned. Deukmejian instead 
appointed Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez.

Mola Development Corp. has decided to meet most of the conditions in Seal 
Beach's revised plan for a 15-acre park the company will build for the city, 
Mola project director Kirk Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
The park would be built adjacent to the wetlands on part of the Hellman Ranch 
property, where Mola has plans for a 355-unit residential project. Mola is 
developing the park and is dedicating an additional 50 acres of nearby property 
to Seal Beach as part of that deal. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Recreation and Park Commission and Mola were expected to finalize 
plans for the park last week. But modifications requested by the commission 
would have cost about $80,000 more than the $1.1 million Mola is obligated to 
spend on the project, according to the company. 
</P>
<P>
Mola's agreement with the city included the stipulation that the company would 
accept changes in the plan as long as they didn't "drastically increase the 
cost," Evans said. Asking Mola to build a $1.9 million park was not fair, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After speculating that Mola's cost estimates might be inflated, commission 
members asked for another analysis by Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
But since then, Evans said, "We've done some rethinking on it. The commission 
loved our plan; they just didn't understand the cost ramifications. Instead of 
having them go through the cost breakdown, we've decided if that's the park 
they want, we'll go ahead and do it." 
</P>
<P>
The park will include tennis, volleyball and basketball courts, a community 
building and other amenities. 
</P>
<P>
Mola will present its terms to the commission at its meeting Wednesday.

FOR STUDENTS, FLYING HIGH IS THEIR REWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Haggert and Chris Miller of Esperanza High School went off campus for 
lunch Friday. Way off campus. 
</P>
<P>
The two boys flew in a four-seat Cessna plane to Big Bear for the day as part 
of the school's "Get High on Life Program," which rewards youths for staying 
off drugs. 
</P>
<P>
And since the plane had dual controls, the students had a chance to actually 
fly the plane for a short time. 
</P>
<P>
Haggert, a senior, said he had been in a small plane before but never had had 
the opportunity to sit at the controls. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, my friends were jealous," he said. "But they support me. They know 
my beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, a freshman, said he never thought he would win the opportunity to fly 
in the plane. "I just filled (the pledge card) out. None of my friends did, but 
I thought it was a good idea. They probably wish they did now." 
</P>
<P>
Timed to coincide with Red Ribbon Week, students were encouraged to sign cards 
pledging their belief in, and support of, a drug-free school and society. The 
two students were then selected at a pep rally to take the plane trip. 
</P>
<P>
Through an arrangement with Liberty Aviation Services of Fullerton and the high 
school, students receive recognition and free flight lessons for campus 
involvement. Jac Nelson, president of the aviation company, said opportunities 
to give students alternatives to drugs through programs like this are arare and 
worth the effort. For the school, the program is a "visible incentive" to stay 
drug-free, said Vice Principal Mark Jackson, who presented the program to 
Nelson. "It's an attempt to recognize those kids that have said they really 
want to make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
For the students, the results are as obvious as the excitement in their voices. 
</P>
<P>
"One friend said I was the luckiest guy in the world," Haggert said. 
</P>
<P>
A member of Peer Support, a campus counseling group, Haggert works locally with 
junior high and elementary school youth, educating them about staying off 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Peer Support also provides support for new students or students who are "just 
having a hard time fitting in," Haggert said. 
</P>
<P>
"I might talk with them, have lunch or just sit with them at an assembly." 
</P>
<P>
Peer Support members have been rewarded with flight lessons as a motivational 
bonus, Jackson said, but this is the first time the school has done anything 
that involves the whole campus. JULIE ESPY

HEARING SET ON PLAN FOR OFFICE BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dana Point Planning Commission next Tuesday will hold a public hearing on a 
proposal by the Stein-Brief Group Inc. to build a 27,000-square-foot, two-story 
headquarters building at the northwest corner of Ritz-Carlton Drive and Pacific 
Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
The public hearing will begin at 7 p.m. at 34052 Del Obispo St. "All persons 
either favoring or opposing this proposal are invited to present their views at 
this hearing," said Edward M. Knight, director of Dana Point's Community 
Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
Stein-Brief proposes building a "modernistic structure" with two levels of 
subterranean parking for its headquarters office, Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago architect Helmut Jahn has been commissioned to design the building. The 
structure would have an exposed steel frame with sides of teak and clear glass.

CITY HOPES ITS LARVAE WORM HAS TURNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials are keeping their fingers crossed in hopes that an infestation 
of tiny green wormlike larvae in the city's primary drinking water supply has 
peaked. 
</P>
<P>
City utilities director Robert J. Dixon said Monday that it has been a week 
since officials have received a complaint about a "sighting" of the threadlike 
insect in a sink, bathtub or shower. During warm summer months, Dixon said, it 
is not uncommon for the half-inch-long pests -- which pose no apparent health 
hazard, even if accidentally ingested -- to get into a glass of water or a 
bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, complaints were received almost daily from city residents 
about the harmless midge fly larvae, prompting city officials to triple the 
dosage of chemicals added to the Big Canyon Reservoir, the suspected source. 
</P>
<P>
But Dixon said it apparently took a spate of cooler weather and light showers 
last week to slow the reproductive habits of the adult midges and reduce the 
number of larvae embedded in the algae on the slopes and at the bottom of the 
reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of the city's 70,000 residents get their drinking water from 
the open-air reservoir that covers 23 acres near San Joaquin Hills Road and 
Marguerite Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems that little cold spell may have done in their mating cycle," Dixon 
said. "The wind and rain probably discouraged them some." 
</P>
<P>
What puzzled city officials most was the lengthy stay of the midges and their 
larvae at the reservoir, and their large numbers. By early fall, the insect -- 
which is often encountered in large swarms near open bodies of fresh water -- 
has normally dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
One bayside restaurateur welcomed the news of the diminishing larvae by saying: 
</P>
<P>
"Let's hope it's over. All of our drinking and cooking water here is bottled. 
But some customers don't believe it unless they get a tour of the kitchen. This 
is hardly the kind of thing to boost business." STEVEN R. CHURM

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Ana Police Department hopes to woo recruits Wednesday evening at an 
orientation seminar that is open to anyone interested in a career in law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to be hiring continuously over the next three years," said 
Officer Marty Shirey, who is leading the recruitment. He added that the 
department needs to fill at least 10 to 20 vacancies a year for the next three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
At the orientation, recruiters will answer questions about the application 
process, academy training and benefits. A video titled "Life on the Streets" 
will be shown. 
</P>
<P>
The orientation will be conducted at 7:30 p.m. at City Hall Annex, 23 Civic 
Center Plaza in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
As of Jan. 1, new police officers in Santa Ana will be paid $38,552 a year.

VOTERS WILL DECIDE ON LEASE EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters next week will decide whether Newport Beach should extend the lease on 
property at Pacific Coast Highway and Newport Boulevard to encourage private 
redevelopment of the site. 
</P>
<P>
Measure R on the Nov. 7 ballot would authorize the city to extend the lease of 
the property, which now expires in 2008, for 10 years. An extension would 
provide incentive for a real estate firm to improve the property, according to 
Barry Permenter, who manages real estate for the county. 
</P>
<P>
"People can expect a full redevelopment of a property that's been an eyesore 
for a number of years, and it won't cost them anything in terms of tax 
dollars," Permenter said. 
</P>
<P>
The land and a five-story building on it are owned by Newport Beach and the 
county. Haseko-LSW, a Los Angeles-based firm, now leases the building. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few years, the renovation could increase the minimum rent charged from 
$200,000 to about $350,000, he said. Plus, when the lease expires, all 
improvements to the land revert to the city and county, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Measure R passes, the lease extension is not automatic, Permenter said. 
The county will renegotiate the lease with input from Newport Beach. JON NALICK

<P>
ROAD TO BE WIDENED FROM 2 TO 6 LANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Commuters who sit in traffic every day on Villa Park Road soon may find the 
trip is easier. Villa Park officials plan to award a contract in November for a 
$1.2-million widening of the road into four and eventually six lanes, City 
Engineer Jeanette Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
Construction is expected to begin in January. 
</P>
<P>
The project will also include a median and permanent lights to replace blinking 
red lights where Villa Park intersects Center Drive and Lemon Street. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental report said noise on the road will increase only slightly, but 
traffic will be 12 feet closer to homes lining the route. Parking along the 
road will be eliminated when it becomes six lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park will receive about $50,000 from the state and $1 million in federal 
funds for the project.

DRUG-AFFECTED BABIES EXPECTED TO DOUBLE; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: THE ORANGE COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES OFFICE INTERVENED IN 1988 FOR 171 
INFANTS WITH SIGNS OF EXPOSURE. THE FIGURE REACHED 175 BY JULY, 1989.

<P>
About 300 drug-affected babies will probably be born in Orange County this 
year, a number nearly double the officially reported figure for 1988, according 
to figures provided Monday by county drug treatment officials. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic increase is attributable both to more widespread drug use and to 
better reporting, especially of crack cocaine, among pregnant women, said Shoni 
Welsh-Davis, director of the Orange County Perinatal Treatment Program, based 
in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Welsh-Davis made the remark in an interview after her testimony before the 
health and environment subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee, whose chairman is Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), is 
considering legislation that would authorize $700 million in new federal 
spending for alcohol and drug abuse treatment by the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and 
Mental Health Administration. Monday's hearing focused on the problems of 
pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Welsh-Davis said that in 1988 the county Department of Social 
Services formally intervened in cases involving 171 infants who were born with 
signs of drug exposure. The figure for 1989 had reached 175 by the end of July, 
she said, "which means we're going to double those numbers this year." 
</P>
<P>
A department spokeswoman said Monday that the 1988 figure had been recently 
adjusted to 179 after a review of records and that the total for 1989 had 
reached 222 as of Sept. 30. If the current trend continues, the actual number 
of county babies born in 1989 who had been exposed to drugs in the womb will 
probably reach about 300. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 38,670 babies were born in the county in 1987, the latest year for which 
figures were immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
The incidence of babies born to drug-addicted mothers "certainly isn't low" in 
the county, Welsh-Davis said: "I think we have a huge problem across the 
nation, in small towns and big towns." 
</P>
<P>
Operated by the county government, Welsh-Davis' clinic each year offers 
outpatient treatment for about 400 drug-addicted mothers or mothers-to-be. 
About 150 women are enrolled in the 36-week program at any given time, she told 
the subcommittee. It is the only non-residential drug treatment program in 
California tailored to meet the needs of pregnant women and the mothers of 
small children, she testified. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing provided another forum that showcased the continuing disagreement 
over public health policy between Waxman and Rep. William E. Dannemeyer 
(R-Fullerton), who also sits on the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
In an opening statement, Waxman said: "In some cities, anger has led to a 
disturbing trend where mothers are sent to jail rather than treatment. Jail is 
not the answer. . . . Jail is not going to teach an addict how to be a good 
mother." 
</P>
<P>
But Dannemeyer suggested that law enforcement agencies should not allow 
drug-addicted mothers to escape prosecution: "We have a law that says we're not 
to use drugs. If we don't prosecute people . . . we're a short way removed from 
the legalization of drugs, aren't we?" 
</P>
<P>
Welsh-Davis disagreed: "You have to be able to replace their (drug-addicted 
mothers') coping mechanism with something more effective. Sending them to jail 
and sending them back to (the environment) . . . they're used to all their 
lives is only reinforcing their behavior." 
</P>
<P>
On another front, Dannemeyer asked whether religion can play a role in recovery 
from drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is of interest," he said, "because some people have observed and 
written that the reason that people resort to drugs is because they're seeking 
. . . to reconnect that breach between their creator, God in heaven . . . and 
the lives they're leading." 
</P>
<P>
However, Welsh-Davis said she does not believe that turning to religion helps 
in overcoming drug addiction in the long run, although it may have positive 
short-term effects. 
</P>
<P>
"If I may speak frankly from my own experience," she said, "I find that to be 
substituting one addiction for another because what these women need to do is 
stand on their own, independently, without needing something to rely on." 
</P>
<P>
Later, however, Welsh-Davis said religious beliefs that support involvement 
with a formal self-help program, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, can help 
recovering addicts. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, Congress has already appropriated the $700 million to pay for the 
new Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration programs. However, the 
Waxman panel is still working on a formal authorization bill because some 
members want to change the way the money will be spent, a source close to the 
subcommittee said. 
</P>
<P>
The spending bill already approved provides for $415 million in block grants, 
over which state and local governments would have wide discretion. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, the source said, wants to reduce the size of the discretionary funds 
and instead require that states spend a significant amount of the money to 
programs that would directly benefit drug-addicted women, particularly those 
who are pregnant.

Asked if he had any thoughts about Sunday's 10-7 loss at Seattle and his 
uncertain status as the team's starting quarterback, McMahon said, "I have 
none." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought he would play against the Eagles after watching Tolliver 
take his place in the starting lineup against the Seahawks, McMahon said, "I 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to talk about the problems McMahon and the Chargers had utilizing the 
clock on their final futile possession at Seattle, McMahon grew completely 
silent. Then he walked past his questioner, pressed one nostril closed with his 
finger and blew out of the other. "There's an answer for you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon completed nine of 12 for 82 yards and one touchdown after coming off 
the bench against the Seahawks in the fourth quarter. Tolliver completed just 
six of 17 passes for 41 yards and never got the offense past midfield. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I thought I was better than I actually was," Tolliver said politely and 
patiently. Tolliver said he didn't expect to find out until Wednesday who next 
Sunday's starter would be. 
</P>
<P>
Henning, whose Chargers have staggered to the halfway point of the season with 
a four-game losing streak, said he would probably decide today. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a little bit torn," Henning said. "Billy didn't play as well as we 
thought he would Sunday. But he didn't have much help. Jim gives us the best 
opportunity to win at this point in time. But we have to get Billy ready to 
play at some point in time." 
</P>
<P>
It was hard to tell which way Henning was leaning. But it was clear the 
decision will send a message on whether Henning considers the rest of the 
season to be a rehearsal for 1990 or an attempt to salvage a respectable record 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Henning also said he was considering wholesale changes on offense, where 
injuries, new personnel and the complexities of the Henning system have slowed 
the team's progress. 
</P>
<P>
Henning wouldn't specify the changes and said they could be made as late as 
Saturday. He did say he learned a lot about Tolliver, even in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"I found this out," Henning said. "He's a rookie. He was rustier than I thought 
he would be after the layoff. He does not panic. And he does not let mistakes 
bind him for the next play or the future." 
</P>
<P>
The Seattle game was not only Tolliver's first regular-season NFL start, it was 
also his first regular-season appearence. And it was his first live action of 
any kind since breaking his left collarbone in the final exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy about the way I played," Tolliver said, "but I'll live through 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The activation of quarterback Mark Vlasic now appears out of the question. 
Vlasic injured his knee late last season. And Henning said he will probably 
remain on the Physically Unable To Perform list the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, whose offense has scored just four touchdowns in its last four 
games, have dropped to 26th in NFL offense and 27th in passing. Their 129 first 
downs are the fewest in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
Charger fans aren't the only ones suffering. This letter to the sports editor 
appeared in the Sunday edition of the Seattle Times/Post Intelligencer: 
</P>
<P>
"I am a die-hard Seahawk fan, but after the loss to Denver (24-21 in overtime 
Oct. 22) my neighbors found me with my head under my bed in the fetal position. 
I just can't take it any more; it is too hard to be a Seahawk fan. 
</P>
<P>
"It is so much easier to be a 49er fan because you know they are going to win. 
It is even easier to be a Lions fan because you know they're going to lose. At 
least they are consistent." 
</P>
<P>
Another letter on the same page: "I am sick of excuses. I am sick of cliches. I 
want action. I want results. Good or bad, it is time to do something. The 
Seahawks are broken and somebody better fix them." 
</P>
<P>
If the Seahawks (4-4), are broken, what are the Chargers (2-6)? 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake, though, Seattle and San Diego are two distinctly different 
places. Another headline in the same Seattle sports section read: "Miserable 
Weather May Bring 'Super' Elk Season." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Charger Coach Dan Henning said the status of H-back Rod Bernstine is "up in the 
air" for Sunday's home game against the Eagles (6-2). Bernstine is still 
recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his left knee and has missed the last 
three games. . . . The Chargers' average margin of defeat in their last four 
games is 4.25 points. . . . One measure of how bad the Charger offense is is 
reflected in a defensive statistic: The Chargers have allowed 54 third-down 
conversions, most in the league. The reason: The average time of possession for 
the Charger offense is 27:01 minutes per game, fourth-worst in the league. . . 
. Philadelphia, Sunday's Charger opponent, leads the league in interceptions 
with 19 and fumble recoveries with 13.

LOYOLA, TO AVOID HITTING THE ROAD, WILL APPEAL RELEAGUING PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Loyola High School Athletic Director Jon Dawson said Monday his school will 
appeal a recent Catholic Athletic Assn. releaguing proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the addition of Santa Margarita, a three-year-old Catholic school in 
Rancho Santa Margarita, the CAA came up with a redesigned league proposal for 
the Southern Section's committee, which will be submitted Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
In the proposal, Santa Margarita is in the large-school division with Mater 
Dei, Servite, Bishop Amat of La Puente, St. John Bosco of Bellflower and 
Loyola, located near downtown Los Angeles; along with all-girls schools Rosary 
of Fullerton and St. Joseph of Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
The smaller-schools division consists of Alemany of Mission Hills, Bishop 
Montgomery of Torrance, Chaminade of Canoga Park, Notre Dame of Sherman Oaks, 
St. Bernard of Playa del Rey, Crespi of Encino and St. Paul of Sante Fe 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are appealing for the students' concern first and not for competition 
reasons," Dawson said. "The travel demands just do not make sense. 
</P>
<P>
"We are 65 miles from Santa Margarita, one-way, and 45 miles from Mater Dei. In 
the old alignment, St. John Bosco was our farthest trip and now it is our 
closest." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola, which competes in the Del Rey League, will have a chance to appeal by 
Dec. 5.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: TRADITION KICKS IN AGAIN FOR GIRLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By LAURA PALMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
the past three years, Mia Labovitz made the headlines as one of the county's 
better field goal kickers. She graduated from San Diego High, but there's a new 
girl across town continuing the tradition of female kickers in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Simona Prochaska became El Cajon Valley High's field goal kicker in much the 
same way that Labovitz began kicking for San Diego. Prochaska played on the 
Braves' soccer team when Coach Kurt Madden recommended to football Coach Don 
George that he take a look at Prochaska. 
</P>
<P>
In her first year on the football team, Prochaska, a junior, has kicked four 
field goals, the longest a 37-yarder against Mount Miguel. She had field goals 
of 26 and 22 yards in the Braves' 32-0 victory over Coronado Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a real team member," George said. "We stress a lot on teamwork. All the 
boys like her and cheer for her. It's a good situation." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of flying back to Philadelphia after Sunday's victory over Denver, the 
Eagles headed straight to San Diego to prepare for Sunday's game against the 
Chargers. They chose Torrey Pines High School for their practice facility. 
They've taken over the locker room and even kicked Coach Rik Haines out of his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a great facility," Haines said, "in our stadium and practice field." 
</P>
<P>
Because it's late in the high school season, Haines said the Eagles' invasion 
is not a distraction. 
</P>
<P>
"We moved practice time back a little," he said. "No big deal. We're late in 
the year and tone down practice. It's a nice distraction for the kids. Their 
football practice is closed except for us." 
</P>
<P>
Kendall Webb, San Diego Section commissioner, said he received a letter on 
Monday from Tony Clark's parents, formally appealing Webb's decision to enforce 
the transfer penalty. Clark, an all-county basketball player from Valhalla, 
transferred to Christian this year, but has been ruled ineligible by Webb to 
play on Christian's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Webb said a three-person committee will be appointed from the Board of Managers 
to hear the Clarks' appeal, hopefully by next week. 
</P>
<P>
El Cajon Valley was forced to forfeit its victories over Christian and Mountain 
Empire because senior running back Jack Snyder, who recently transferred from 
Bakersfield, was found academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, El Cajon Valley drops to 1-7. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we're concerned, we won the games," Coach Don George said. "That's 
the attitude we're taking. That's behind us now and we're concentrating on the 
rest of the season." 
</P>
<P>
George said Snyder could be eligible to play in the final league game against 
Grossmont Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder had been fourth in the county in rushing, averaging 137 yards a game, 
and ninth in scoring with 48 points in four games. 
</P>
<P>
The Mira Mesa water polo team set a San Diego Section record for most points 
scored in a game when it defeated Patrick Henry, 43-5, last week. The previous 
record was set in 1976 when Crawford defeated Mission Bay, 42-3. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Mt. Carmel's homecoming floats turned into a giant bonfire Friday night 
after one of the floats began burning and caught another one on fire. The 
floats were at the end of the field by the scoreboard and nothing else was 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't be 100% sure, but the best we can figure is there was a battery 
hooked up in one of the floats that sparked the decorations," said Bob 
Speights, Mt. Carmel vice principal and athletic director. "A lot of that stuff 
on the floats is flammable." 
</P>
<P>
The game wasn't interrupted and Mt. Carmel defeated Orange Glen, 31-20, but 
there was commotion among the fans. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids went crazy in the stands," Speights said. "It flared up pretty good."

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
TITAN GOALIE GUARANTEES SHUTOUTS, IF NECESSARY 
</P>

<P>
FULLERTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jay Nettekoven didn't exactly point a bat toward the center-field bleachers, 
but he made his point just the same. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton needs to win its final two soccer games -- the second 
against sixth-ranked Fresno State -- to feel confident of securing a berth in 
the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament. Nettekoven is the Titans' 
goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
"If we score, we'll win," Nettekoven said. "I feel that strongly." 
</P>
<P>
What he's saying is shutout, guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton would prefer it didn't come to that, but Nettekoven says he is 
prepared to do what is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not working for shutouts (in the statistics), I'm working to win," he 
said. "But my job is to keep zeroes on the board." 
</P>
<P>
Some of Nettekoven's talk may be goalkeeper's bravado. But for the past two 
games, he has backed it up. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans traveled to Las Vegas Friday to play Nevada Las Vegas, a team they 
hadn't beaten on the road since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton scored twice, and Nettekoven had seven saves. The result was a 2-0 
Titan victory. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton played at UC Irvine Sunday, and scored only one goal. But Nettekoven 
had a four-save shutout, and the Titans won again. 
</P>
<P>
That's two consecutive shutouts. Nettekoven would like to make it four. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans, 11-6-1 overall and in second place in the Big West Conference with 
a 5-2-1 record, play at San Jose State Friday and at Fresno State Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs are 14-2 overall, 8-0 in the Big West. Fresno State defeated 
Fullerton, 2-1, in the teams' first meeting this season. 
</P>
<P>
A victory over Fresno State would give Fullerton a good shot at making the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
A loss? 
</P>
<P>
"Then our name would be tossed around, like in the lottery," Nettekoven said. 
</P>
<P>
Nettekoven, a junior, is facing a different sort of challenge this year than he 
did last season, when a weak Titan defense forced him to make 120 saves, more 
than six a game. 
</P>
<P>
This season, with a stronger defense, Nettekoven has made 81 saves, with two 
games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
But early in the season, Nettekoven says he struggled. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't coming up with the saves that had to be made," he said. "Last year I 
was getting shellshocked. Now it's practically stagnant. Now I'm used to the 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
Even though his record last season was 6-11-2, Nettekoven was recognized for 
his work in goal, earning second-team Big West honors. 
</P>
<P>
This season, his goals-against average has dropped from 1.6 to 1.2. But that 
isn't low enough to suit Nettekoven. 
</P>
<P>
"To get recognition, you need to be below a 1.0," he said. "It's like a 
pitcher's earned-run average. That's the stat people look at." 
</P>
<P>
And just think what two more shutouts would do for that stat. 
</P>
<P>
Tap on the Wrist: Gene Murphy, Fullerton football coach, said he received a 
private reprimand from Big West Conference Commissioner Jim Haney after 
complaining publicly about the officials' calls in the Titans' 33-19 loss to 
Fresno State Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches are not allowed to publicly criticize conference officials or officials 
of other member schools, according to conference by-laws. 
</P>
<P>
Haney said the situation "was addressed." 
</P>
<P>
As for the disputed calls, a conference observer reviewed films of the game and 
reported to Jack O'Cain, supervisor of football officials. 
</P>
<P>
O'Cain's response to the three calls that Murphy disputed on Fresno's 
victory-clinching fourth-quarter drive: 
</P>
<P>
Roughing the Kicker: Fullerton's Terry Tramble was called for roughing the 
punter, giving the Bulldogs 15 yards and an automatic first down. Fullerton 
coaches contend that contact wasn't blatant, and that the penalty, if any was 
called, should have been five yards for running into the kicker. 
</P>
<P>
"A judgment call," O'Cain said. "I won't comment on whether that should have 
been five yards or 15." 
</P>
<P>
The Fumble: After a Fresno State fumble, the referee quickly and decisively 
signaled Fullerton's ball, but the call was reversed. 
</P>
<P>
"On the fumble, we made a mistake in signaling the wrong decision," O'Cain 
said. "The call when finished was probably correct." 
</P>
<P>
O'Cain said, as did Fresno State Coach Jim Sweeney, that a Fullerton player sat 
on the ball, which should not have been ruled a recovery. A Fresno State player 
later pulled the ball away, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Personal Foul: Looking at the film, a personal foul call against Terry 
Tramble seemed unwarranted. But O'Cain said the call was for an incident after 
the play ended that was not on the film. O'Cain said an official reported that 
the penalty was for "a striking blow to the helmet," and that the official did 
not correctly report the reason for the penalty to Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
After a week off, the football team plays New Mexico State at 1 p.m. on 
Saturday at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Always scary," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton remains the only Big West team to have lost to New Mexico State, 
losing to the Aggies in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State is winless this season after eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton is trying to win its final three games, which would give the Titans a 
6-4-1 record, their first winning season since 1985.

BARGEMAN TURNS TABLES ON CSUN AT HOMECOMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was homecoming at North Campus Stadium Saturday night, but someone forgot to 
tell Travis Bargeman that Cal State Northridge was supposed to do the 
celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
Bargeman, a former Alemany High standout in football and track, pulled the plug 
on Northridge's party plans by catching two touchdown passes for Santa Clara in 
the Broncos' 21-20 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I get up to do good against the home team," he said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Bargeman did much of the same playing for Alemany, but at 5-9, 160 pounds, he 
simply didn't measure up to the physical standards of major college recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Malley, Santa Clara's coach, is thankful for that. Had Division I scouts 
graded Bargeman strictly on performance as opposed to his physical attributes, 
Malley would be minus one of the Western Football Conference's most explosive 
offensive players. 
</P>
<P>
Against Northridge, Bargeman had only two catches, but they went for scores 
covering 63 and 47 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"He's as competitive and intelligent a receiver as we've had here," said 
Malley, who is in his fifth season as coach of the Broncos after five as an 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows how to find the open holes and he catches in a crowd. Even if he 
knows he's going to get hit, he'll go up for it." 
</P>
<P>
Bargeman is in his third season as a starter for Santa Clara. He is among the 
WFC leaders with 34 receptions for 798 yards (23.5 yards per catch) and nine 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Against Cal Lutheran two weeks ago, he caught four passes for 127 yards, 
including a 60-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Bargeman started to assert himself near the end of last season. In Santa 
Clara's final three games, he caught 13 passes for 322 yards and three 
touchdowns. Included was a game against Northridge in which he made four 
catches for 139 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Catching attention: Bargeman wasn't the only receiver from a Valley-area high 
school to burn a local team on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Brooks, a sophomore from Monroe High, led Santa Barbara City College 
with seven catches for 80 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks was interfered with on his touchdown but still managed to catch a 
25-yard scoring pass from quarterback Sam Levitz. It was only the fourth 
passing touchdown the Moorpark defense has surrendered all season. 
</P>
<P>
Nighthawks: Moorpark's 34-10 victory over Santa Barbara was its third win at 
night. In night games this season the Raiders have outscored opponents, 104-20. 
</P>
<P>
That might be taken as an argument for lights, which were expected to have been 
installed at Moorpark stadium this fall but probably won't be ready for the 
remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Dunham, Moorpark's athletic director, reports that the light standards are 
ready and waiting to be installed. "We're trying to get volunteers from 
companies to put them up," Dunham said. 
</P>
<P>
The lights, like the rest of the stadium's construction materials, were 
purchased with donated funds. "When you depend on donations sometimes it takes 
longer, but otherwise we wouldn't have them at all," Dunham said. 
</P>
<P>
No hurry. The Raiders have been just as impressive in daylight, outscoring 
opponents, 157-35, in afternoon games. 
</P>
<P>
On the run: For the first time in school history, three Glendale College 
running backs each rushed for more than 100 yards in the same game. 
</P>
<P>
In the Vaqueros' 62-26 win over Harbor, sophomore tailback Sean Hampton had a 
game-high 146 yards while sophomore tailback Doug Dragomer rushed for 110 yards 
and freshman fullback Wes Bender added 103 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Bender has 13 touchdowns this season, tying the school-record set by Henry 
Longoria in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Maimed Marauders: Antelope Valley was in third place in the Foothill Conference 
standings three weeks ago, but after consecutive losses to East Los Angeles 
(31-20) and San Bernardino Valley (44-14), the Marauders are in fifth and 
falling fast. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley has been hurt by two key injuries -- only one of which was 
sustained by a player. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Mike Dalley's season ended Oct. 7 when he sustained torn ligaments 
in his left knee during a 24-9 victory over Chaffey. 
</P>
<P>
The following week the Marauders lost Dick Curtis, their defensive coordinator, 
to a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley is 0-2-1 since Dalley went down, and the once-proud Marauder 
defense been pounded in the last two games without Curtis on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"We've definitely missed Mike's leadership and physical abilities," Antelope 
Valley Coach Brent Carder said. "He was a starter last year and gave this 
year's team -- which is young -- some needed experience." 
</P>
<P>
Although Antelope Valley has called the defensive signals by committee the last 
two weeks, Carder said that fundamental mistakes have done more damage to the 
Marauders than coaching miscues. 
</P>
<P>
"We're missing tackles and assignments," Carder said. "We're just making a lot 
of mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Third time is a charm: Although Pierce's 24-13 victory against Santa Monica on 
Saturday was the Brahmas' second win in a row, Coach Bob Enger said that 
consecutive win No. 3 would be a real charm. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two milestones I still have left to achieve," Enger quipped. "The 
first one is a victory against Valley and the second one is death." 
</P>
<P>
Enger has a 0-2 lifetime record against the Monarchs, having lost to them once 
as coach at East L. A., and again last season at Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
Still in limbo: Pierce quarterback Jamie Grossman missed Saturday's game with a 
knee injury and is expected to be out of action again this week against Valley. 
</P>
<P>
However, he may not be lost for the season, as Enger once feared. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still not sure how badly the knee is hurt," Enger said. "It's improved, 
but we won't know until next week what condition it is in." 
</P>
<P>
Grossman's knee was initially examined last week, and will be tested again next 
week before a decision is made about possible surgery.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jonathan McMurtry believes that if he and Alan Turing -- the British 
mathematician he plays in "Breaking the Code" at South Coast Repertory -- had 
ever met at a cocktail party, the encounter would have been unpleasant for both 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't have liked him personally," McMurtry says. "I would have found him 
too self-centered. He was rather opinionated. And he could be very biting, 
especially with people who didn't understand his work. I probably would have 
said, . . . what's wrong with him?' " 
</P>
<P>
Willful, stubborn, unkempt -- Turing was that, too. Though brilliant, he 
stammered like a schoolboy and bit his nails obsessively. Yet when you ask what 
pleasure McMurtry gets from playing such a character, he notes that Turing's 
disagreeable traits presented the sort of challenge that has always drawn him 
to difficult roles. 
</P>
<P>
This paradox amuses him. "I like doing unattractive people," says the star of 
Hugh Whitemore's biographical drama, which opened Friday on the SCR Mainstage. 
"I don't like to play heroes." 
</P>
<P>
Among his more than 100 roles at San Diego's Old Globe Theatre, for instance, 
the slightly built, sandy-haired actor particularly relishes Iago in "Othello," 
whom he interpreted as a compulsive liar and sociopath in the guise of a 
seemingly honest hail-fellow-well-met. 
</P>
<P>
This time, far from portraying a consummate dissembler, McMurtry gives us 
someone who is constitutionally unable to keep up any pretense whatsoever. Even 
the exchange of mere social pleasantries is a hurdle for Turing, who feels 
friendlier toward his computer prototypes -- "thinking machines" he called them 
-- than toward people. 
</P>
<P>
There was considerably more to Turing than his defects, of course. A genius at 
cryptography, he cracked the secret German military code during World War II. 
Turing's work, championed by Winston Churchill, enabled the Allies to counter 
German U-boat attacks, thereby gaining a naval advantage in the North Atlantic 
without which the war could have been lost. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the absence of sham in Turing's iconoclastic personality -- which 
ordinarily might have been a virtue -- proved disastrous. In what turned out to 
be his worst mistake, he told the police investigating a petty burglary at his 
home that he was having a homosexual affair. The voluntary admission brought 
about his arrest for moral turpitude, eventually led to his expulsion from 
academia and ultimately precipitated his suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the hardest role I've tackled," McMurtry maintains, sipping coffee 
from a Styrofoam cup during a recent interview at SCR. "I've never played this 
kind of man. He is a genuine eccentric. It's exciting to be in his body, to see 
what makes him tick. I almost live the character. I've never bitten my nails, 
and now I find myself doing it all of a sudden." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the actor's nails look manicured, and he seems entirely composed. 
Casually dressed in a plaid shirt, blue pullover and corduroy pants, he gives 
not the slightest hint of Turing's excitability or of his overweening 
self-absorption. 
</P>
<P>
At 50, McMurtry lives in San Diego with his wife, Terri, and has played leading 
roles at most of California's major theaters, including the Mark Taper Forum in 
Los Angeles, the American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco and the Los 
Angeles Theatre Center. He last appeared at SCR in 1986 as the melancholy 
Jacques in "As You Like It." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Detroit, McMurtry says he grew up "in the trunk" because both of his 
parents were show-biz dancers. They toured so often that he eventually went to 
live with his grandparents in Southern California. Not surprisingly, he shunned 
the idea of making a theatrical career at first and preferred the idea of 
becoming a painter. 
</P>
<P>
But he changed his mind around 1960 at Los Angeles City College, where he won a 
nationwide audition for a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 
London. After training there for two years, "I came back ready to lick the 
world," he recalls. "I thought I could do anything. And of course I couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, McMurtry is a great believer in British stage technique. Too many 
"American actors are lazy," he contends. They have the impression that "if you 
think right and feel right, it will come out right," he says. "Well, it doesn't 
work that way." 
</P>
<P>
To prepare for his role in "Breaking the Code," McMurtry says he consulted a 
speech therapist to explore the cause of Turing's stammer. He also sought the 
advice of a university professor to understand the mathematical meaning of 
various terms that figure in Turing's theories, one of which is given at length 
in a monologue running to more than three pages. 
</P>
<P>
But for all the surface dryness of Turing's favorite topics -- such as the 
interface between electronics and higher logic -- McMurtry brings the man to 
life with a strikingly visceral performance. His portrayal of a lonely, 
abstract thinker resonates with a subterranean force remarkable for its 
repressed energy. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually try to find what the body does first," the actor explains, "because 
the rhythms and speech patterns depend on that. A stammer comes from an 
emotional place. It has a lot of explosive stuff behind it. 
</P>
<P>
"In Turing's case his mind just works faster than his mouth. He can't catch up 
with himself. So he gets mad and irritated that his words are not coming out. 
And he is most passionate when he is talking about his ideas. That's when he 
gets really emotional." 
</P>
<P>
As for Turing's homosexuality, McMurtry purposely avoids the use of effeminate 
gestures. Although the character candidly asserts his sexual orientation -- and 
several scenes show Turing's predilection for rough young men -- McMurtry gives 
scant physical indication of the obvious. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not limp-wristed or anything like that," McMurtry says. "If he were, 
I'd play that. It's not a problem. I've played raging queens, salad boys, total 
faggots. But Turing is not an old poof, even though that is how he describes 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the most intriguing aspect of the character resides elsewhere. For 
Turing seems, above all, a tragic figure in the classic sense, driven by pride 
and overtaken by events beyond his control. 
</P>
<P>
"I see him almost as a Creon image," McMurtry says, "an exile in a land that 
doesn't work the way he works." 
</P>
<P>
"Breaking the Code" by Hugh Whitemore continues on the Mainstage at South Coast 
Repertory through Nov. 30. The theater is at 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. 
Curtain Tuesday to Saturday at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 7:30 p.m.; matinees Saturday

MASTER CHORALE OUTDRAWS PACIFIC CHORALE BY 800

<P>
The Master Chorale of Orange County outdrew the Pacific Chorale by almost 800 
ticket-buyers over the weekend as both groups kicked off their seasons at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Master Chorale drew 2,400 to its performance of Stravinsky's "Symphony of 
Psalms," with the Lewitzky Dance Company, and Orff's "Carmina Burana" on 
Friday, according to chorale board chairman John Rhynerson. About 200 
admissions were complimentary -- to high schools and senior citizen centers, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Chorale drew 1,807 people to its program of Beethoven's "Missa 
Solemnis" on Sunday, according to executive director Bonnie McClain, who said 
380 were complimentary admissions to local schools and church choirs. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Master Chorale's 2,200 (minus the complimentary tickets), the breakdown 
was 807 season subscribers and 1,393 single-ticket buyers, according to 
Rhynerson, who attributed the single-ticket figure to a "big marketing push" 
that included the mailing of "around 30,000 flyers" to local dance companies 
and departments at colleges and high schools. "The assumption was that the 
Lewitzky Dance Company would bring in a different audience," Rhynerson said. 
</P>
<P>
'It also was our first Friday (night) concert in the Center in quite a while, 
and that helped . . .," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The Master Chorale's next concert will a Christmas program with Shirley Jones, 
Dec. 3 at the Center. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Pacific's 1,427 (minus the free tickets), 1,137 were season subscribers 
and 290 were single-ticket buyers, McClain said. "I am not unhappy with the 
attendance figures," she said. "Of course, I would have loved 1,500 
subscribers. . . . I'd like to sell 3,000 season tickets. But our 
season-tickets sale started slow, which is always the case. . . . In the last 
two and three weeks, it picked up." 
</P>
<P>
McClain also said that the Center failed to insert flyers announcing the 
Pacific's Dec. 18 "Messiah" Sing-Along into Sunday's program booklet, as 
requested. "I don't know what the problem was," she said. "I was not thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
A Center spokesperson acknowledged that "it is our responsibility to put flyers 
into the programs" and said the error was "due to a miscommunication." 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for those of us with small staffs," McClain said. "I wish it could 
be made easier for us. I was not happy that those (flyers) did not get stuffed. 
The 'Messiah' Sing-Along is not a season-subscriber event. We want people to 
know that they have to buy other tickets. Those kind of stuffers are a good way 
and inexpensive way to let people know." 
</P>
<P>
"We corrected the problem as soon as we found out about it and gave the flyers 
to the ushers to hand out at the door," the Center spokesperson said. "As far 
as we know, most of the people got them." 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific's next concert will be a holiday program Dec. 2 at the Center.

<P>
It was a rather unusual Halloween celebration -- no costumes or 
jack-o'-lanterns, no cobwebs hanging in the doorways. Only a woman strumming 
her dulcimer and singing traditional ballads. She seemed more ethereal than 
sinister. 
</P>
<P>
But when she sang, the spirits of the past came alive. And, at times, it was 
haunting. 
</P>
<P>
Those who heard Holly Tannen sing at the Shade Tree on Friday night were 
reminded that the Celtic tradition of Halloween is not just about 
trick-or-treating but getting in touch with the spirits of ancestors -- a 
ritual performed with stories and songs about magic and the supernatural. 
</P>
<P>
"Halloween is a celebration for keeping our ancestors alive, both our genetic 
and our spiritual ancestors," Tannen explained to the audience of about 40 (a 
full house). The holiday derives, she said, from the old festival of Samhain 
(pronounced sow-en), which is Gaelic for "the end of the summer," when cattle 
were brought in from their summer pastures, the harvest was completed and the 
spirits of the ancestors were invoked. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, youngsters were impersonating the souls of their ancestors when they 
went house to house for handouts, spawning the trick-or-treating practiced by 
children today. 
</P>
<P>
Songs at the Shade Tree included ones about a woman who must rescue her lover 
from the evil "fairies" of the forest who had kidnaped him when he fell from 
his horse ("Tam Lin"); a deceased lover who comes back from the grave to 
complain when his beloved's constant tears disrupt his sleep ("The Unquiet 
Grave"), and a woman, accused of being a witch and about to be burned at the 
stake, who calls upon the spirits of air, water, fire and earth for protection. 
</P>
<P>
Tannen's humorous songs included the tale of a man who, in an attempt to get in 
touch with his spirituality, gives up his polyester pants for a silver fox 
loincloth and a Navajo drum, and proclaims: "Once I was a husband but a cave 
bear I am now." Another, by Mark Graham, lamented mankind's lack of respect for 
the dinosaur ("All we say is 'their brains were small and they died.' ") 
</P>
<P>
Tannen sang her Scottish, Irish, English and Appalachian songs in their 
respective dialects, with her eyes closed, as if yielding to the voices of the 
past, acting as a kind of ancestral medium, a channel through which these 
spirits could communicate. At times, the audience was encouraged to sing along, 
which added a campfire feel to the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Tannen's own ancestry is Russian and Romanian-Jewish. She said, "We (the 
Jewish) have tended to play the music of the countries we've gone to . . . like 
Gypsies." But she emphasized that the songs really are universal. "The music is 
passed down from generation to generation, so they are in a sense our 
ancestors." 
</P>
<P>
Tannen, who was born in New York, first began playing at 17 when she received 
her first Appalachian mountain dulcimer from a boyfriend who made it for her 
after seeing Jean Ritchie perform at a Berkeley folk festival. She drew early 
inspiration from Greenwich Village, where she heard such performers as Carly 
Simon, Joan Baez, and Peter, Paul and Mary. 
</P>
<P>
She went to England in 1974, living and traveling in a mini-van for about five 
years as she studied the country's traditional folk music. She recently took a 
master's degree in folklore, concentrating on the songs and stories of the 
"traveling people of Scotland." She lives in Mendocino, where she teaches 
folklore and anthropology at the College of the Redwoods. 
</P>
<P>
Tannen has recorded two albums, "Between the Worlds" and "Invocation," which 
includes a note on the back of the jacket: "For best results, this album should 
be listened to by candlelight."

LEFKOWITZ IN GARDEN GROVE RECITAL

GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Sunday night, at the cozy little Gem Theatre, violinist Mischa Lefkowitz 
presented the first of two recitals he will offer under the auspices of the 
Garden Grove Symphony. It was a meat-and-potatoes program, with Beethoven, 
Bloch and Brahms as the main courses. 
</P>
<P>
While technical feats were consistently well done, expressive nuance was a bit 
too rare. Brahms' Third Sonata suffered most from blandness, the quiet, 
suspense-fraught passages of the Allegro reduced to mere posturing, the 
undercurrent of pained Angst smoothed to a calm sureness in the Adagio. 
</P>
<P>
Lefkowitz did, however, muster an exciting level of energy for the closing 
Allegro vivace. That complemented the contained dynamism of his accompanist 
Brent McMunn, whose command of romantic intensity, direction and phrasing 
contrasted with the soloist's shortfalls in earlier movements. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch also suffered from over-reliance on technical authority. With little 
attention given to dynamic shape and overall cohesion, the Prelude to his Suite 
No. 1 for solo violin tended to ramble and the Andante tranquillo seemed 
uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
But all was not bleak. Beethoven's First Sonata emerged unscathed from the 
violinist's matter-of-fact approach. Here, with McMunn's able assistance, 
Lefkowitz offered a secure and stylish reading of this more straight-forward 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Lefkowitz filled out his program with musically uncomplicated, physically 
demanding miniatures by Wienawski, Sarasate and Dvorak, all sparkling with an 
impressive facility. It is a facility that will serve the Garden Grove Symphony 
well, as the orchestra begins its fifth season with Lefkowitz as the new 
principal concertmaster (replacing Liane Mautner).

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRUNKEN TRUCKER GETS 8 YEARS IN FATAL CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A truck driver who slammed his asphalt-hauling big rig into a stalled pickup 
truck while drunk, killing two people and injuring four others, was sentenced 
Monday to eight years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Antoine Love, 28, who pleaded guilty Oct. 16 to two counts of vehicular 
manslaughter and one count of drunk driving, was sentenced by Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge John Reid. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Oscodar said Love, while drunk last Nov. 23, crashed 
his tractor-trailer rig into a pickup that was stalled on the shoulder of the 
westbound Santa Monica Freeway near Arlington Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Two men in the pickup, Florentino Lopez and Marvin Escovar, were killed. Four 
other passengers were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Oscodar said that since late 1985, Love has been cited 12 times for moving 
violations, five times for expired registration, four times for equipment 
violations, and once for driving without a license.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STAR WITNESS IN MURDER CASE BALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The star prosecution witness in the case of two brothers charged with 
masterminding the murders of their elderly parents refused to testify Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Dominguez, 30, of Las Vegas, who pleaded guilty in 1986 to two counts 
of first-degree murder in the case, had agreed to testify against the other 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Although Dominguez testified at two preliminary hearings, when called Monday to 
testify at the trial of one of the brothers, Stewart Woodman, he repeatedly 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Cooper found Dominguez in contempt of court 
for refusing to testify and fined him $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez said he refused to testify because prosecutors might want to use his 
testimony to bolster unspecified charges they were preparing against him, an 
allegation denied by Deputy Dist. Atty. Pat Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper ordered Dominguez to remain in custody in Los Angeles County until the 
trial is over or he agrees to testify. 
</P>
<P>
Woodman, 39, and his brother, Neil Woodman, 45, are charged with hiring several 
reputed hit men to gun down their elderly parents in the garage of their luxury 
Brentwood condominium in 1985 after a bitter dispute involving the family's San 
Fernando Valley plastics firm.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE CHIEF FIRED OVER MANAGEMENT POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Baldwin Park City Council on Monday fired Police Chief Richard A. Hoskin, 
saying that his his management philosophy was incompatible with that of the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department had been troubled by low morale and a protracted labor 
dispute that left officers in the 70-member police union without a contract for 
part of last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Hoskin, 43, had been on administrative leave since Oct. 5. He joined the city 
as a police officer in 1968, and was named chief in December, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Carmine Lanza has been named acting chief. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-1 vote to dismiss Hoskin follows resignations by the city manager, the 
director of housing and the director of community services -- all of whom have 
either quit or been forced to resign in the last six months.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 400 PROTEST SUSPENSION OF DEAN OF STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 400 students at Dominguez High School in Compton staged a four-hour 
walkout Monday that was so peaceful the principal lent them his sound system 
and, at his request, the protesters picked up their trash before returning to 
class. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of mostly juniors and seniors at the 1,800-student school was 
protesting the suspension last week of the dean of students, Cornelia Davis. 
The reason for the suspension was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
School district officials said Davis has been suspended without pay pending an 
investigation by the school board. They declined to comment further, saying it 
was a personnel matter. 
</P>
<P>
The students assembled on the front lawn of the school at 9:30 a.m. and 
returned to classes at 1:30 p.m., shortly after student leaders met with 
Principal Ernie Roy. 
</P>
<P>
Davis could not be reached for comment. She was described by several protesting 
students as a mother figure at the school. "She's like a motivator to all of 
us," said senior Kimberly Wilson, Dominguez's liaison to the Compton Unified 
School District Board of Trustees.

L.A. SCHOOL BOARD WARNED OF CUTS AHEAD; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: DISTRICT OFFICIALS SAY THE 1990-91 BUDGET MAY HAVE TO BE TRIMMED BY 
UP TO $180 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE WOO, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with sharply rising teacher and administrator salaries, the Los Angeles 
Unified School District will be forced to make deep budget cuts -- perhaps as 
much as $180 million -- in the 1990-91 school year, district officials warned 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
District chief financial officer Robert Booker told the Board of Education that 
the cuts will be needed because these expenditures have risen faster than the 
state's allowance for inflation increases. Another reason for the steep cuts is 
that the board used funds to balance the 1989-90 budget that will not be 
available next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The district has serious problems," Booker said, which means the board will 
face "difficult choices" when it begins preparing next year's spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
Booker said the estimate of cuts next year could be as low as $115 million or 
as high as $180 million, depending on the amount of money received from the 
state lottery and from Proposition 98, the voter-approved initiative that 
guarantees schools a stable spending base. 
</P>
<P>
The grim budget prediction was sparked by a discussion of a motion by board 
member Roberta Weintraub calling for an immediate freeze on spending in six 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub's proposal, which is scheduled for a vote Monday, asks the board to 
reject spending on new programs, such as on an ambitious district plan to end 
low achievement. It also would freeze all travel paid out of the general fund 
"except for travel related to legislative, legal and financial matters." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, job vacancies in central and regional offices would be left 
unfilled unless approved by a special freeze committee formed last year by 
Supt. Leonard Britton. All job reclassifications requiring salary raises would 
also be frozen. Moreover, renewal of district membership in outside 
organizations would be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
Booker estimated the freezes would save $1 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub said she hoped that the motion would have a "chilling effect" on 
board members and encourage extreme caution on spending the district's money. 
"We have reached the bottom of the barrel as far as money is concerned, or 
darned close," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The board cut about $40 million to balance this year's nearly $4-billion 
budget. Those cuts were necessary, district officials said, because of the 
salary increases the board gave teachers -- who staged a nine-day strike in May 
-- and administrators. Teachers and school-based administrators received a 
three-year, 24% raise, while Britton and other senior managers were given a 16% 
increase over two years. 
</P>
<P>
Several board members were critical of the motion, calling it inadequate and 
premature. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good beginning but it's just not of the magnitude needed," board member 
Rita Walters said.

GARDENER RAISES BUMPER CROP OF GHOULS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hands that actually move reach up from the graves in Florencio Morales' front 
yard in Montecito Heights. Eerie background music sets the mood for the ghosts, 
goblins, witches, skeletons and werewolves lurking about. 
</P>
<P>
The macabre production has made Morales a legend in his neighborhood, and his 
holiday decorations attract visitors from as far away as Mexico and Italy to 
his home at 4225 Griffin Ave., creating small traffic jams -- especially on 
Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
Morales, 40, began the tradition of decorating his front yard on holidays eight 
years ago with a single, grisly figure -- a hanged man -- on Halloween. Each 
year, the displays have become more elaborate. Morales, a gardener, digs into 
his own pocket to foot the bill for putting up the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
His Halloween display -- overseen by a huge devil atop his house -- has led 
some superstitious visitors to call him brujo, witch in Spanish. A 
fundamentalist minister prayed for his salvation after seeing the decorations. 
</P>
<P>
Morales, who dons a Dracula costume as part of his show, explained to the 
minister that he also puts up decorations at Christmas and other holidays. And 
Halloween is as much a time for laughter as anything, he said. How else to 
explain the cigar in his werewolf's mouth? 
</P>

JURY RECEIVES 1988 GANG KILLING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY BANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 1988 Westwood gang shooting that took the life of an innocent bystander and 
galvanized the city in its fight against gang violence was portrayed in court 
Monday as an attempted pay-back murder that went awry. 
</P>
<P>
In his closing argument, prosecutor Michael Duarte told the jury that defendant 
Durrell Dewitt Collins was trying to kill rival gang member Tyrone Swain, on 
Jan. 30, 1988, when he fired across a busy Westwood street, hitting Karen 
Toshima in the head as she strolled with her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
The jury begins deliberations today after a monthlong trial that included a 
change in prosecutors, when Deputy Dist. Atty. Sandra Goen-Harris bowed out a 
week into the trial to give birth. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, 23, is charged with the murder of Toshima, 27, and the attempted 
murder of Swain, who Duarte said had recently been released from jail, where he 
was being held for shooting at a member of Collins' gang. 
</P>
<P>
The case hinges on eyewitness identification. During the trial, Duarte 
presented four witnesses who had picked Collins out of police photos or a 
lineup and testified they saw him fire the fatal shot, but defense attorney 
Paul Takakjian cited inconsistencies in their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Takakjian implied that the shooting could have been committed by another of the 
many gang members in Westwood that night, and argued that even if the jury 
believes Collins fired the fatal shot, they should convict him of manslaughter 
-- not murder -- because the killing occurred "in the heat of passion" as Swain 
advanced on Collins with a plastic milk crate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's horrific, it's an outrage and anybody who has half the sense God gave a 
goat has to be stunned by what happened to Karen Toshima," he said. But "it 
would be very easy . . . and it would just as surely be very wrong" to convict 
Collins of murder, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Collins did not testify during the trial, but Takakjian put on two of Collins' 
friends who testified that he was in a Westwood video arcade at the time of the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte contended Monday that the witnesses lied to save Collins, and he 
painstakingly led the jury through large charts listing discrepancies in the 
accounts of the alibi witnesses, as well as similarities in the prosecution's 
eyewitness accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no great conspiracy in this case to convict an innocent man," he said.

HIGH SCHOOLS GIVING TV GOOD REVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
PREP SPORTS: WHILE CRITICS QUESTION THE EFFECT OF NATIONAL TELEVISION EXPOSURE, 
SCHOOL OFFICIALS SEEM PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The annual big game between Carson and Banning high schools, which will be 
shown live Nov. 9 on cable television to a potential 8.5 million homes across 
the country, is bigger than ever this year. But is it better? 
</P>
<P>
That's the question being asked by critics who oppose the TV contract 
engineered by the National Federation of State High School Assns. -- governing 
body of prep sports -- with cable's SportsChannel America to televise 25 high 
school events this season, including 12 football games. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say that TV will put additional pressure on players and coaches and 
expose them to the kinds of temptations that created a monster in the college 
ranks. As Sports Illustrated's Rick Reilly complained in a column before the 
season: "Why does high school America want to go big time when big time has 
already been proven to smell like old game socks?" 
</P>
<P>
That high school football -- basketball starts in December -- now has its own 
national television package shouldn't surprise anyone who has been following 
prep sports in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
USA Today calls it "the new age." Big corporations are paying millions to 
sponsor state championship events and influence players to wear their products. 
TV stations are buying rights to local games for as much as $1.5 million a 
year, and, although the national federation doesn't recognize them, there are 
even national football and basketball "champions," the teams that finish first 
in USA Today's rankings. 
</P>
<P>
But with the first season of nationally televised football drawing to a close, 
have the critics' fears been realized? What kind of impact have the televised 
games had on everyone involved? Have TV timeouts compromised the sport? Are 
local fans staying home to watch in their living rooms? Is anyone? Who besides 
college recruiters and players' relatives are watching? 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the national federation send a representative to every telecast 
and have "not had one negative report," said Warren Brown, assistant executive 
director of the Kansas City-based organization. "It's been a very positive 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
So is the $250,000 that the federation is getting in each year of its five-year 
contract. Brown negotiated that deal with SportsChannel a year and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
Each school that makes a TV appearance gets $1,200, a token payment that "does 
not corrupt," said Dwight Thomas, football coach and athletic director at 
Escambia High in Pensacola, Fla. "If a coach is going to instigate immoral or 
illegal practices, he is going to do so without the influence of television." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the five-year contract, the federation will probably lose money, after 
paying the production costs of public-service announcements, Brown said. The 
announcements promote the values of sports participation, the support of local 
teams, sportsmanship and drug education. 
</P>
<P>
A typical spot: "When you support activities that turn kids into adults, 
everybody wins." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to go on national TV "was not a money-driven thing," said the 
federation's Helen Upton. "It's principle driven," a chance to show the "good 
side" of high school athletics. 
</P>
<P>
High school sports became attractive to cable TV because the beast is always 
hungry. When SportsChannel decided to challenge cable heavyweight ESPN -- which 
has 58 million subscribers -- it went from a three-days-a-week service to seven 
and needed things to show. Look at Carson-Banning as an alternative to 
Australian football. But nobody really knows if the high school telecasts are 
catching on, since ratings won't be available until SportsChannel is in 15 
million homes. 
</P>
<P>
SportsChannel, which also televises National Hockey League games, spends only 
about $50,000 to produce a high school football game but still manages to give 
each telecast a professional look. Four or five cameras are used, along with 
instant replay, snappy graphics and close-ups of cheerleaders and fans. The 
federation, however, will not allow players to be interviewed before or during 
a telecast. 
</P>
<P>
SportsChannel is permitted to have one 60-second and one 90-second TV timeout 
each quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The announcers, 24-year-old Bob Papa on play-by-play and analyst Glenn 
Blackwood, former Miami Dolphin defensive back, provide the basic down and 
distances along with player tidbits, culled from questionnaires, such as 
favorite pro player and career goals. 
</P>
<P>
But no blemishes ever show. No mention of players being caught using steroids 
or having disciplinary problems or going to summer school to regain athletic 
eligibility. The football experience is presented strictly as a wholesome 
activity, "a slice of Americana," says the federation's John Gillis, who 
attends most games. 
</P>
<P>
But whose version of Americana? 
</P>
<P>
Escambia Coach Thomas, who likes to say "nobody can out-promote me," wanted to 
have a flag-carrying parachutist land on the field before his team's game 
against cross-town rival Pine Forest on Sept. 15. It was a promotion he had 
used before. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going to show America what football was all about," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
But the federation found out and killed the idea. It wanted bonfires and pep 
rallies, "normal kinds of things," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them, 'This is normal for us.' Boy, we would've lit up some people's 
eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas is also involved in what may be the biggest problem in televising high 
school games: creating a super division of high school teams, as the colleges 
have done with Notre Dame, USC, Miami and others. But the federation, Gillis 
says, is aware of that possibility and is taking steps to make sure it doesn't 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to repeat the same teams more than once every four or five 
years," Gillis said. "And we're looking for strong games, not necessarily for 
great teams. We want good matchups in terms of great traditional rivalries." 
</P>
<P>
But the decision of which schools get on the tube is being left to 
SportsChannel, which wants the most attractive games for obvious reasons. This 
creates an opening for enterprising coaches. When Thomas read a blurb in the 
federation newsletter last winter about the deal with SportsChannel, he said to 
himself, "I'm going to go after this for me." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas lobbied to get Escambia included on the TV schedule. Not only did he 
write letters to federation officials, but he created a matchup too tempting 
for Sports-Channel to turn down: Escambia, one of the country's top teams in 
1986, when it had star running back Emmitt Smith, vs. Pine Forest, last 
season's and this season's No. 1 team in the USA Today poll. 
</P>
<P>
"Coaches are competitive," said Thomas, whose team lost the TV game to Pine 
Forest, 17-11. "They're going to see another coach on TV and say, 'How can I 
get me on there?' So they're going to be working harder and doing more, which 
will upgrade football." 
</P>
<P>
SportsChannel's schedule-maker is Happy Fine, former columnist for an Eastern 
basketball magazine. Fine didn't have much time to put together a schedule this 
season -- he wasn't able to start until last spring -- but did talk to prep 
writers at almost every metropolitan daily in the country. 
</P>
<P>
In the L.A. area, the annual Carson-Banning game -- perhaps the most heated 
rivalry in Southern California -- was at the top of everyone's list, a natural. 
But Fine also wanted to schedule teams with nationally known blue-chip players, 
so he picked Cleveland St. Ignatius, the defending state champion in Ohio that 
has a prize quarterback named Joe Pickens. 
</P>
<P>
College recruiters, of course, are using the national games to scout potential 
college players. And even though SportsChannel "goes out of its way to avoid 
hyping a player," says spokesman Dan Martinsen, it's difficult not to keep 
mentioning a player when he's making tackles all over the field or, in the case 
of standout linebacker Oliver Gibson of Romeoville, Ill., making tackles and 
homecoming king. 
</P>
<P>
"The game definitely marketed and promoted our athletes," Thomas said. "Every 
college recruiter in the country had his VCR turned on. It's going to help our 
players." 
</P>
<P>
But is there something slightly wrong about this? Are players from schools 
whose teams haven't been on television at a disadvantage? 
</P>
<P>
No, said announcer Papa. "Everybody can open up a USA Today to see who's the 
best running back." 
</P>
<P>
So far, no players have been reported slashing their wrists after fumbling on 
the potentially winning touchdown run on national TV, or acting like a prima 
donna after getting a fan letter from somebody in Boise. 
</P>
<P>
"Pressure on kids happens without TV," suggested SportsChannel's Martinsen. 
</P>
<P>
And there seem to be residual benefits from being on the game of the week. 
Before their game, Thomas said, the community paid for a face lift at the 
Escambia stadium to make sure the national audience didn't see any peeling 
paint. And in small towns, the mere fact that their game is going out to the 
nation is a reason for residents to feel good about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real honor for the kids," said Coach Allan Cox, whose Paducah (Ky.) 
Tilghman Tornadoes defeated longtime rival Mayfield in September, 16-7. The 
Paducah Sun treated the telecast reverentially, a headline declaring 
"SportsChannel Exposes Community Pride," and the story even quoted a 
sportswriter who had come to Paducah to do a piece for a big New York 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Tilghman-Mayfield rivalry goes all the way back to 1911, this 
year's game is different, "remembered as the one on national television," Cox 
said. And "in a few years, most people won't even remember the score, just that 
it was on TV." 
</P>
<P>
One of the concerns of some high school officials is that fans will stay home 
to watch a game on television, hurting local gates. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get people to get out to our games on Friday night," said 
Thomas Byrnes, executive director of the California Interscholastic Federation, 
which belongs to the national federation. "We should be protecting Friday 
night." 
</P>
<P>
But there is no evidence that the high schools are being hurt by the TV games. 
Just the opposite seems to be happening in the towns where the games are 
played. At Pensacola, for instance, attendance nearly doubled for the 
Escambia-Pine Forest game because, Escambia Coach Thomas speculated, fans 
wanted to be there on national TV. Then, he theorized, they went home and 
watched tapes of the game on their VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
Television definitely creates a new dimension. 
</P>
<P>
"Having the game on TV gives me more incentive to play well," Carson 
quarterback Armin Youngblood said. 
</P>
<P>
And, said Thomas: "Who doesn't want to go on national TV and say 'Hi, Mom,'?"

SENIORS CAN STOP THEIR COMPLAINING; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TOURNAMENT IS SWITCHED TO A COURSE THAT SHOULD PLEASE 
THE PLAYERS ON THE 50-AND-OVER TOUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As a rule, members of the Senior PGA Tour don't often complain. They are too 
busy enjoying this bonanza that has made them rich and given them something to 
do in their autumn years. 
</P>
<P>
But they have complained loud and long about the courses used for Southern 
California tournaments since the tour started holding an event here a few years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Neither MountainGate Country Club, where the tournament was staged in 1985 and 
1986, nor Wood Ranch in Simi Valley, site of the next two, met with approval 
from the 50-and-older set. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the GTE West has moved to the Ojai Valley Inn &amp; Country Club, 
there are not likely to be many complaints about the $350,000 tournament, which 
begins with a pro-am Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
The 6,252-yard layout in the hills above Ventura is the perfect setting for a 
senior tournament. It is a fair test and not too long. 
</P>
<P>
Although such seniors as Arnold Palmer, Jim Dent and Chi Chi Rodriguez can hit 
the ball within range of players on the regular tour, some of the older seniors 
can't. Because a large number of pros over 60 compete, the seniors look for a 
tight course rather than one that favors long hitters. Ojai is a par 70, and 
there are some tough par fours. But for the most part, even the older golfers 
will be able to reach the greens in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
The characteristics that caused complaints about MountainGate and Wood Ranch 
are not apparent on this course. 
</P>
<P>
MountainGate, a hilly course built on landfill, had greens slick as glass. One 
year when the pros were complaining about the difficulty of putting at Augusta 
National during the Masters, Billy Casper, who had just played in the senior 
tournament at MountainGate, was asked about the greens. 
</P>
<P>
"Compared to MountainGate, these are easy," Casper said. "It is impossible to 
putt on those greens." 
</P>
<P>
The problem at Wood Ranch was the wind. On what passed for a mild day, the wind 
often blew 15 to 20 m.p.h. On some occasions, there were gusts of 40. The wind 
dried out the greens and made them extremely hard and fast. It often was cold, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Neither MountainGate nor Wood Ranch was good for spectators, either. The 
terrain made walking difficult, and there was little room around the 18th 
holes. Those problems don't exist at Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Henning won the last senior event in the area, at Wood Ranch in March 
1988. The South African, who was one of the first players to use a long-handled 
putter, hasn't won a tournament since, although he's among the money leaders 
this year with more than $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
Henning says he likes the Ojai course, which is located 73 miles northwest of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Although I won at Wood Ranch, I didn't enjoy playing there that much," he 
said. "It's tough to play in wind, and when it's blowing as hard as it did 
there, it is really difficult to play well. 
</P>
<P>
"I like what I've seen of this course, and I know most of the seniors are 
anxious to play here. I haven't been playing well lately, but despite not 
winning, I've taken a lot of ammunition home. 
</P>
<P>
"A few years ago we played this tour just for laughs. It was a social occasion 
where you renewed old friendships. There are so many tournaments and there is 
so much money, the seniors are getting serious again. 
</P>
<P>
"We keep adding a good player every week or so. Recently Larry Ziegler and 
George Archer joined and immediately became threats to win. Lee Trevino can 
hardly wait. He'll play the week after Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
"Next year Jack Nicklaus will join us for some tournaments. Trevino and 
Nicklaus may be in for a surprise. As good as they are, they won't dominate 
every week. There are too many good players out here now." 
</P>
<P>
The Ojai Valley Inn &amp; Country Club, which stages an invitational tennis 
tournament each spring, was built in 1923. The course was designed by Billy 
Bell and George C. Thomas Jr., the latter also the course architect of Riviera, 
Los Angeles and Bel-Air country clubs. 
</P>
<P>
In June 1988, under the direction of Jay Morrish, the course underwent a $3 
million resurfacing, part of an overall $35 million restoration and expansion 
project. 
</P>
<P>
When Ojai learned that the PGA was looking for a site to stage a senior 
tournament, it made a pitch and was successful. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Gary Player, who has returned home to South Africa, all the top 
seniors will be there for the 54-hole tournament, which ends on Saturday, Dec. 
2.

NEWSWIRE: PINIELLA INTERESTED IN REDS, BUT IT'S UP TO GEORGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lou Piniella says he is interested in becoming the Cincinnati Reds' manager -- 
if New York Yankee owner George Steinbrenner will let him. 
</P>
<P>
Piniella managed the Yankees in 1986, 1987 and part of the 1988 season and is 
under contract to the Yankees as a special adviser to Steinbrenner at a 
reported salary of $400,000 for the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I would like to have that job -- definitely," Piniella said. "That's a 
good ballclub. But a few things would have to fall into place." 
</P>
<P>
During this past season, Steinbrenner effectively blocked the Toronto Blue Jays 
from talking with Piniella by asking for player compensation. 
</P>
<P>
"This might be a different situation in that it is a National League team," 
Piniella said. "But, honestly, I don't know how George would react." 
</P>
<P>
The Reds refused to say whether they are pursuing Piniella as a candidate, 
although they've mentioned almost everyone else who is available. 
</P>
<P>
WHIO-AM radio in Dayton reported Monday evening that Piniella was in Dayton on 
Monday to talk with Reds' officials, and that he was offered the managing job 
during the visit. 
</P>
<P>
Reds spokesman Joe Braude, contacted after the report was aired, said the team 
had no comment about it. "I don't know anything about anybody visiting," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Reds General Manager Bob Quinn said he interviewed Reds' interim manager Tommy 
Helms, planned to interview at least two more candidates and considers former 
Houston Manager Hal Lanier and ex-Cleveland Managers Pat Corrales and Doc 
Edwards to be among candidates.

University of Mississippi free safety Roy Lee (Chuckie) Mullins remained in 
critical condition after five hours of spinal surgery, and doctors said it was 
unlikely he will regain the use of his arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
Mullins, 20, was paralyzed from the shoulders down when he broke his neck 
Saturday as he crashed into Vanderbilt receiver Brad Gaines while trying to 
break up a pass at the two-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Clarence Watridge, a surgeon at Baptist Memorial Hospital, said Mullins 
suffered four fractured vertebrae. Watridge and fellow surgeon Marvin Leventhal 
operated on Mullins to realign his twisted spine and fuse the broken vertebrae. 
</P>
<P>
Watridge said it was too early to estimate Mullins' chances of regaining the 
use of his arms or legs, but he said the probabilities of such a recovery are 
slight. 
</P>
<P>
The doctors said Mullins was able to breathe without a respirator, but was 
being closely watched in case he lost that ability.

MARKETING: ARE ADS SPAWNED BY HUGO, EARTHQUAKE TASTEFUL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several days after Hurricane Hugo ripped through Charleston, AT&amp;T rushed a 
production crew there to film a promotional video. Originally, the video was 
supposed to be seen only by AT&amp;T employees -- as a way to show team spirit 
during a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
But the film footage of the devastation aftermath was so graphic, and in the 
case of one misty-eyed AT&amp;T supervisor, so heart tugging, that the company 
took a different path. It decided to wrap the timely film footage into its 
national ad campaign about the reliability of the phone company in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
"It was that once-in-a-lifetime vehicle," said Burke Stinson, media relations 
manager at AT&amp;T in Basking Ridge, N.J. "We had a major show coming up in 
roughly the same time frame of a major tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T also sent a film crew to the Bay Area after the earthquake earlier 
this month. After all, AT&amp;T knew that it had gobs of ad time to fill during 
Sunday night's airing of "The Final Days" on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
Allstate, too, had film crews in Charleston and the Bay Area. Allstate's ads 
from Charleston actually show its agents handing checks to several homeowners 
who filed claims. The insurer says it could have its earthquake commercial on 
the air next week. 
</P>
<P>
But some advertising experts wonder if all this is a bit too ghoulish. For the 
sake of selling some property insurance or telephone systems, are some 
advertisers insensitive to people still suffering in the aftermath of these 
disasters? 
</P>
<P>
"From a marketing standpoint, a great case can be made that the timing of these 
ads is perfect," said Stan Freberg, a Los Angeles advertising consultant and 
president of Stan Freberg Ltd. "But from a standpoint of taste, I think it's 
terrible for any company to seize upon a disaster to toot its own horn." 
</P>
<P>
Others strongly disagree. "It's very appropriate for a company to sometimes 
remind people, 'Hey, we told you we'd do this, and guess what -- we did,' " 
said Gene Cameron, president of the Los Angeles office of BBDO Worldwide. "Of 
course, all this has to be done in good taste." 
</P>
<P>
This sort of "disaster aftermath" advertising can directly result in new 
business, said John Czepiel, professor of marketing at New York University. 
"You can bet there are people who see those Allstate ads and wonder what their 
insurance companies would do," Czepiel said. "For that matter, some people have 
to be asking themselves: Why isn't my insurance company running ads like 
these?" 
</P>
<P>
Executives from Allstate and AT&amp;T insist that they're only letting people 
know about their excellent services during times of crisis -- and are not 
trying to take advantage of the situations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're showing people that we've perfected how to deal with catastrophes," said 
John Flieder, vice president of product advertising at Northbrook, Ill.-based 
Allstate Insurance Co., which eventually expects to pay more than $250 million 
in claims related to Hurricane Hugo. "When you have a disaster that will be on 
people's minds for a long time, that's worth talking about." 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago ad agency Leo Burnett has made similar "disaster" commercials for 
Allstate for more than 20 years. In fact, some stand-up comedians have even 
been known to parody these ads in their skits. "If Saturday Night Live wants to 
make a parody ad of what we do, that's fine with me," Flieder said. "Just so 
they spell our name right." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Fred Ayoub probably wouldn't find a parody ad very funny. After all, 
Ayoub's home in North Charleston, S.C., was virtually demolished when a 
300-foot radio tower came crashing through it during the hurricane. The 
36-year-old Ayoub -- standing among the ruins of his home -- is featured in a 
recent Allstate commercial. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as what they say is true, I don't see anything wrong with these kinds 
of ads," said Ayoub, in an interview. He said Allstate has paid him three 
installments of the $58,000 he will eventually receive to completely rebuild 
his home. 
</P>
<P>
In the commercial, Ayoub states just how pleased he is with Allstate's service. 
"They didn't pressure me or put any words into my mouth," said Ayoub. "The 
whole thing took me by surprise. No one even told me a commercial crew was 
going to come by the house." 
</P>
<P>
But Freberg, the consultant, said the Allstate ad is terribly offensive. "It 
makes me think that they have a special division that waits around for 
disasters to happen," said Freberg. "I suppose they have a vice president of 
earthquakes and another vice president of hurricanes." 
</P>
<P>
The three-minute "disaster" ad that AT&amp;T aired Sunday night -- featuring 
scenes from the recent hurricane and earthquake -- was originally supposed to 
be just about Hurricane Hugo. "We were looking for something that would show 
our responsiveness as a corporation," said Stinson, of the commercial that was 
created by the agency NW Ayer. Then, days after the Hugo films were completed, 
the Bay Area earthquake occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"The earthquake was even a greater test for AT&amp;T," said Stinson. "In the 
ad, we're trying to politely blow our own horn. We're showing that by being 
fast afoot in a tragedy, we can also be speedy during a communications problem 
that is not caused by an act of God." 
</P>
<P>
What about those people in Charleston and the Bay Area who, after the separate 
tragedies, have complained about going for days without AT&amp;T long-distance 
service? "There might be people who have those complaints," said Stinson. "But 
on the whole, the record we exhibited with our fast response was exemplary." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T Sponsorship of 'Final Days' Zapped 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T says there will be no Watergate-style cover-up over the flak that it 
receives for sponsoring ABC's Sunday night telecast about Richard Nixon's last 
days in office -- "The Final Days." "Call volumes to our customer service 
centers were up 15% to 20% on Monday," said Burke Stinson, media relations 
manager at AT&amp;T. On the East Coast, alone, more than 1,000 calls were 
received by AT&amp;T officials -- about 50% of them from unhappy customers. 
Stinson said that many customers said they would switch to competing 
long-distance carriers -- just as an angry Nixon, himself, switched to MCI in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of people who called said they didn't even watch the show," Stinson 
said. "They said they had read about it over the weekend and didn't want to see 
it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lottery Looking for New Ad Shop 
</P>
<P>
Don't make any bets yet, but the California State Lottery -- one of the biggest 
advertisers on the West Coast -- is seriously looking at changing agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The lottery's annual ad budget is $60 million -- and lottery officials are 
reviewing agencies. A decision is expected by early December. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, lottery officials quietly named four finalists for the lucrative ad 
business -- including incumbent Daily &amp; Associates. Also in the running are 
BBDO Los Angeles, Chiat/Day/Mojo and the San Francisco office of J. Walter 
Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese auto makers aside, the lottery is among the most sought-after ad 
accounts on the West Coast. Explained Gene Cameron, president of BBDO Los 
Angeles, "Everything else that big has four wheels on it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coen Teams With 2 Under a New Name 
</P>
<P>
Once again, a "new" advertising agency has arrived on the Los Angeles scene. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Coen, Kalis &amp; Moiselle isn't entirely new. It was formerly 
Raymond Coen &amp; Associates, an agency that may be best known locally for its 
ads for Oh Boy! Frozen Foods. Now, Coen has taken on two partners and hopes to 
expand his business well beyond its current annual billings of $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The Los Angeles advertising jungle isn't being enlarged," said Coen, "it's 
just being improved." 
</P>
<P>
And so is Coen's agency. Joining him as partners are Murray Kalis, who was 
formerly creative director and executive vice president at HDM/LA, and Ed 
Moiselle, whose agency, Seidman and Moiselle, was acquired by Admarketing. At 
HDM, Kalis helped create those familiar ads for Nissin brand noodles, including 
the spot for Hardy Cup O' Noodles that features an Oliver Twist-like character 
who asks for more noodles. 
</P>
<P>
"We're already pitching against the big boys," said Coen, whose agency this 
week will go up against J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather for a local 
packaged goods advertiser. Coen said his agency will specialize in consumer 
retail businesses with annual ad budgets of $1 million to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a trend among advertisers to not necessarily go with the big-name 
agencies," Coen said. "Instead, they're going with agencies that can generate 
sales." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latino Ad Agency Links Up With HDM 
</P>
<P>
What is the best way for a Latino advertising agency to grow? 
</P>
<P>
Some have merged with big agencies and entirely lost their identities. But 
recently the North Hollywood ad shop Castellanos Latina Advertising announced 
an unusual "affiliation agreement" with HDM Worldwide -- and will remain 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been searching for a partner whose spirit and philosophy matches our 
own," said Julio J. Castellanos Sr., president of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, HDM will introduce Castellanos to many of its big clients, 
such as Westin Hotels, Peugeot and Nintendo. If -- and when -- Castellanos 
creates any Spanish-language ads for HDM clients, HDM will receive an 
undisclosed "cut" of those billings, said Julio J. Castellanos Jr., senior vice 
president of the 3-year-old agency. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no intention or inclination to sell the majority of our company," said 
Castellanos Jr., whose agency creates Spanish-language ads for the Broadway and 
Pic N Save. "We're in it for the long haul." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of this agreement, Castellanos Jr. said his agency -- which has 
annual billings of about $7 million -- expects to pick up $5 million in new 
business over the next year. "This is a great way of opening doors with new 
clients."

TOYOTA WILL DOUBLE IMPORTS TO JAPAN OF ITS U.S.-BUILT CARS

<P>
In an apparent effort to help reduce trade friction between Japan and the 
United States, Toyota plans to more than double its imports of U.S.-built cars 
and other products into Japan over the next three years, the company said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota, Japan's largest auto maker, said that by 1992, its imports of American 
products into Japan will total $2.1 billion, up from $1 billion in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota said it will ship up to 40,000 U.S.-built cars a year from its new 
American assembly operations back to Japan by the early 1990s. The cars, to be 
produced at Toyota's new Georgetown, Ky., assembly plant, will be Camry compact 
models equipped with right-hand drive, which is standard in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Toyota said that, beginning next year, it will export 600,000 
catalytic converters for use in its Japanese-built cars from its highly 
automated factory in Long Beach; by 1992, those exports will rise to 750,000 
annually. Also in 1992, the company will begin exporting 100,000 engines a year 
to Japan, from a new engine plant in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
The actions mark a major change for Toyota, which was initially more reluctant 
than other Japanese auto makers to commit to building cars in the United 
States. Traditionally, Toyota has produced virtually all of its cars and parts 
in Japan, with most of its manufacturing operations concentrated around its 
Toyota City headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, Toyota officials say the firm is taking a more global outlook. 
</P>
<P>
"We are at the stage now with our overseas operations, particularly in the 
U.S., where we can begin to experiment with model sharing, and parts and 
component sourcing on a more global level," said Toyota Executive Vice 
President Tsutomu Ohshima. "This is our first real step, and we expect there 
will be others to follow." 
</P>
<P>
To expand its purchases of American parts, the company said it will spend $144 
million on its U.S. research and development activities, tripling the size of 
its Ann Arbor, Mich., technical center, and adding a new technical headquarters 
in Torrance, near the headquarters of its U.S. sales and marketing operations. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota said one of the main functions of the expanded technical staff will be 
to evaluate American parts suppliers and parts, which the firm said its U.S. 
operations have not been equipped to do in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Among its first major purchases have been U.S.-built machine tools, according 
to a report in an industry trade journal. Toyota has become the first Japanese 
auto maker producing cars in this country to buy tooling and equipment for its 
new U.S. factory from American machine tool makers, Metalworking News reported 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Toyota officials have also visited nine U.S. semiconductor makers as 
part of an effort to increase the company's use of American computer chips in 
its cars. On Monday, the company said it plans a "sevenfold" increase in its 
use of American chips by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota is not the first Japanese company to export U.S.-built cars back to 
Japan, however. 
</P>
<P>
Honda currently ships 6,000 Accord Coupes a year from its Marysville, Ohio, 
assembly plant to Japan and plans to increase those exports to 50,000 a year by 
the early 1990s. A proposed Accord station wagon, which is to be built only in 
Marysville -- and not Japan -- beginning in 1991, is also considered a likely 
candidate for export back to Japan, company officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The Ford Probe, which is built by Mazda in the company's Flat Rock, Mich., 
assembly plant, is also exported to Japan. Exports of the new Mitsubishi 
Eclipse, produced by Diamond-Star Motors, a joint venture between Chrysler and 
Mitsubishi in Bloomington, Ill., will begin in December. 
</P>
<P>
In order to avert strict limits on direct Japanese imports into Taiwan, several 
Japanese operations here have also begun shipping cars to Taiwan. Toyota 
currently exports Camrys from Kentucky and Corolla subcompact models from its 
joint venture with General Motors for the Taiwanese market. Toyota said Monday 
that it will increase shipments of U.S.-built Camrys to Taiwan from 4,000 a 
year to 10,000 annually by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota also announced several smaller purchases of American products. Most 
notably, it said it is buying a second U.S.-made supercomputer for use in its 
engineering and design offices in Japan from Minneapolis-based Cray Research.

BANK PANEL CHIEF ASKS BUSH TO FIRE S&amp;L REGULATOR; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: IN A LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT, REP. HENRY B. GONZALEZ CITED TESTIMONY 
ALLEGING THAT M. DANNY WALL INTERFERED WITH A LINCOLN SAVINGS &amp; LOAN 
INVESTIGATION.

<P>
The chairman of the House Banking Committee on Monday called on President Bush 
to fire M. Danny Wall as the federal government's chief thrift regulator for 
his alleged improper interference with a probe of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Bush, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) noted that the Banking 
Committee has heard testimony that Wall blocked efforts by federal regulators 
in San Francisco to collect evidence of misconduct at Lincoln in 1987. 
Testimony also showed that Wall met with Lincoln owner Charles H. Keating Jr. 
while the thrift was a target of the federal probe. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez reminded Bush that government seizure of Lincoln last April created 
the biggest savings and loan failure in the nation's history. It is estimated 
that insured depositors will receive $2 billion from the U.S. Treasury as a 
result of the action. 
</P>
<P>
He also recalled that the President had assured the nation that it would be 
spared another savings and loan crisis under his Administration, and added: "I 
question that the assurance has meaning while Mr. Wall remains in office. In 
view of your commitment to not let those responsible for these costly failures 
remain in positions of authority in your Administration," Gonzalez wrote, "I 
believe it would be reassuring to the American taxpayers who have been asked to 
pay for this regulatory failure if Mr. Wall steps aside." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez has long been a critic of Wall, director of the Office of Thrift 
Supervision, and has previously suggested that he step aside temporarily while 
the committee investigates his actions in the Lincoln case. However, Monday was 
the first time that the chairman had sought Wall's permanent dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez has been upset since members of the Senate Banking Committee demanded 
last August that Wall retain his position as part of a House-Senate compromise 
over legislation designed to bail out the ailing thrift industry. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the Office of Thrift Supervision was created as the successor 
agency to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which Wall had headed since July, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
At a House Banking Committee hearing last Thursday, federal regulators from San 
Francisco testified that Wall had "shot them in the back" by blocking a timely 
federal takeover of Lincoln in 1987, when the thrift was found to be making 
risky loans. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Wall has acknowledged that he met personally with Keating in 1987, 
about the same time that he was considering the recommendation of San Francisco 
regulators that Lincoln be seized. The two men knew each other before Wall took 
over at the FHLBB. 
</P>
<P>
Wall and Keating have been subpoenaed to testify before the committee next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez told Bush that Wall's continued presence at the thrift supervision 
office is impeding the committee's investigation of the Lincoln case. He noted 
that Wall had summoned two employees from the San Francisco office to a meeting 
at the agency's Washington headquarters before their testimony. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the most honest, straightforward witness finds it difficult to give the 
committee the full benefit of their knowledge while Mr. Wall has control over 
their future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it appeared that members of the House Banking Committee may be 
moving toward a decision to hear testimony from Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) 
and four other senators who intervened with the FHLBB in 1987 on behalf of 
Keating, who was a major contributor to their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
It would be unusual, but not unprecedented, for a House committee to request 
testimony from members of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Committee sources said Rep. Toby Roth (R-Wis.) has decided to present the 
committee with a resolution requesting testimony from the five senators if 
Gonzalez does not arrange for them to appear voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Black, a spokeswoman for the committee, said Gonzalez opposes issuing a 
subpoena to the senators, as he has done with all of the other witnesses who 
have appeared before the committee. But she did not rule out the possibility of 
an informal arrangement under which the senators could speak to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said he would oppose issuing 
subpoenas to the senators. "I consider it unusual in the extreme, and a 
practice that I think should be avoided," he said. "(But) it doesn't mean that 
members cannot appear, obviously." 
</P>
<P>
In a private meeting with Gonzales on Oct. 3, Cranston offered to cooperate 
with the House probe, but he did not volunteer to testify, according to a 
Cranston spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The five senators are also under scrutiny by the Senate Ethics Committee, which 
has asked them to respond to charges filed against them by Common Cause, the 
self-styled citizens lobby. Common Cause has accused them of bringing improper 
pressure to bear on the FHLBB on behalf of Keating. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Ethics Committee has asked all five senators to respond to the 
charges in writing, sources cautioned that the panel has not decided to launch 
an investigation. "It is not a preliminary investigation," emphasized a Senate 
aide. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, according to these sources, committee employees are collecting 
information to be presented within the next few weeks to Chairman Howell Heflin 
(D-Ala.) and Vice Chairman Warren Rudman (R-N.H.), who then will decide whether 
to hold a meeting of the full committee to discuss the allegations raised by 
Common Cause.

QUOTRON TO CUT 16% OF STAFF OVER NEXT 9 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Quotron Systems, the nation's largest provider of stock price quotations, said 
Monday that it will fire 400 people, or about 16% of its work force, as it 
tries to streamline the company in the face of belt tightening in the 
securities industry since the October, 1987, crash. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based company, which has dominated the market since it launched 
the first electronic stock price quotation system nearly 30 years ago, also is 
battling intense competition at a time when wild swings of the market are 
leaving stock traders clamoring for more and faster information. 
</P>
<P>
Quotron will be laying off employees at all job levels and in all of its 
geographic areas, spokeswoman Ellen Fish said. The company did not reveal how 
many people will be let go in each office, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Quotron employs about 1,500 people in Los Angeles and 2,500 worldwide, she 
said. The layoffs will occur during the next six to nine months, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"This action will continue to keep operating expenses in line with revenues in 
response to changing conditions in the retail securities industry, which has 
been contracting during the two years since October, 1987," said J. David Hann, 
Quotron's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Quotron controls 50% of the stock quote market with about 100,000 terminals, 
which can be seen in brokerage offices nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
But Automatic Data Processing of Roseland, N.J., has been catching up and now 
has about 60,000 terminals. Smaller competitors include Reuters, which has a 
near lock on foreign exchange quotes, and Telerate, which almost monopolizes 
the business for bonds and other fixed-income securities. 
</P>
<P>
Some major Quotron clients -- primarily Merrill Lynch and Shearson Lehman 
Hutton -- have signed contracts to switch to ADP systems but are still using 
Quotron as well. 
</P>
<P>
The overhaul at Quotron is not a reaction to those defections, Fish said. "This 
is a response to overall industry conditions, not in response to individual 
contracts," she said, adding that Quotron has also lured away some former ADP 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
Quotron, which is owned by Citicorp, the New York banking giant, does not 
reveal its financial results. But Citicorp has said the company earned a small 
operating profit last year. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of the year, Citicorp's information business segment, 
of which Quotron is the major component, saw its net loss increase 63% to $117 
million, its revenues fall 7% to $213 million and its operating expenses rise 
17% to $390 million. The business segment's expenses have been rising partly 
because of business development costs. 
</P>
<P>
"During the past two years, we have committed extensive company resources to 
improving systems and processes to support our core business, including network 
backup capabilities, centralized customer support and automated field service 
dispatch," Hann said. "These investments have all been made to improve the 
quality of our service and to better support customers." 
</P>
<P>
Quotron will continue its expansion plans, Fish said. They include a 
soon-to-be-introduced foreign exchange system as well as bond quotes. The 
company has said it also wants to add customers overseas. 
</P>
<P>
One embarrassing moment for Quotron came Oct. 16, when the market gyrated 
wildly and for about 30 minutes the stock price quotation system couldn't get 
the Dow Jones industrial average right. The company insisted that individual 
stock prices and volume figures were accurate throughout the incident.

Bush Signs Farmer Relief Bill: President Bush signed legislation that gives a 
break to farmers who are growing substitute crops on land where drought 
destroyed or damaged earlier plantings. The measure eases restrictions that 
were part of a previous federal farm-disaster aid package. The revision 
protects winter wheat and cotton farmers who otherwise might have been denied 
disaster payments for their lost crops under a USDA plan -- even though the 
producers expect to earn little or no profit on replacement crops such as grain 
sorghum or soybeans.

Unocal Corp.: The Los Angeles energy company reported third-quarter earnings of 
$79 million, down 19% from the year-ago period. Revenue totaled $2.82 billion, 
up 8%. The firm said the earnings decline was due principally to lower refining 
and marketing earnings, higher dry hole expense and increased domestic oil and 
gas production costs.

WARNER BLASTS SONY OVER GUBER-PETERS CONTRACT; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: THE MOVIE COMPANY SAYS THE PRODUCERS' CONTRACT WITH COLUMBIA 
PICTURES REPRESENTS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In an ongoing legal battle for Hollywood's hottest producers, Warner Bros. on 
Monday lambasted Sony Corp.'s contention that Peter Guber and Jon Peters can be 
hired as chief executives of Columbia Pictures Entertainment without violating 
their exclusive movie production deal at Warner. 
</P>
<P>
"That suggestion is not possible from a practical or ethical viewpoint. Guber 
and Peters would have intolerable conflicts of interest in decision-making," 
said Warner Bros. Chairman Robert A. Daly in a new affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
In a similarly frosty tone, Warner Bros. President Terry Semel denied that he 
ever orally agreed to let Guber and Peters terminate their written agreement if 
they got the chance to own or operate another studio. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is Sony's hiring of the producers of "Batman" and a string of other 
hits to run Columbia Pictures, which Sony is acquiring in a $3.4-billion tender 
offer set to expire today. Guber and Peters accepted their new Columbia posts 
on Sept. 27 without obtaining a release from Warner. 
</P>
<P>
Sony and Warner are due to square off Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court, 
where Warner is seeking a preliminary injunction to bar Guber and Peters from 
"reneging" on their five-year contract signed seven months ago. Warner contends 
that it has already invested or committed $13 million in 50 new projects being 
developed by Guber and Peters. 
</P>
<P>
Sony, for its part, argued in its response last week that "California courts 
look down upon injunctions limiting a person's employment opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
In an 11-page statement attached to Sony's filing, CBS Records President and 
Chief Executive Walter R. Yetnikoff detailed his behind-the-scenes role for the 
first time. Sony acquired CBS Records last year, and CBS Records and Warner's 
three record companies have continued a fierce rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
In his sworn statement, Yetnikoff accused Time Warner Co-Chairman Steven J. 
Ross of bias against the Japanese or Sony dating back to 1987, when Sony 
decided to bid for the record company. According to Yetnikoff, Ross "even 
offered to act as my personal adviser to help construct a deal that would avoid 
a sale to Sony, and in fact attempted to do so." 
</P>
<P>
Yetnikoff also insisted that Sony never set out to "raid" Warner, although the 
CBS Records executive said he, Guber and Peters had "long shared a hope of 
working together some day." 
</P>
<P>
According to Yetnikoff, Sony approached three other candidates to head Columbia 
while Yetnikoff was "in resident treatment at a health facility in Minnesota" 
in August and early September. After leaving the Minnesota facility Sept. 10, 
Yetnikoff said, he decided to call Guber and did so four days later. In 
describing subsequent meetings, Yetnikoff said, "Guber and Peters assured us . 
. . that Warner presented no problem whatsoever. . . . They also assured us 
that they would have no trouble in obtaining a written release from Warner." 
</P>
<P>
The CBS Records president said he never saw the Warner contract during the 
September negotiations. By Oct. 3, however -- one week after Sony's bid for 
Columbia was announced -- "it became apparent that Guber and Peters were having 
difficulty with Warner" and Sony asked "for the first time" to hear the 
contract's relevant language, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Yetnikoff -- who is a lawyer -- said he concluded that a formal release from 
Warner was not necessary since Guber and Peters were being hired as chief 
executives and not as movie producers. (Sony contends that the Warner contract 
is limited to movie production.) 
</P>
<P>
In Warner's supplemental filings Monday, longtime studio chief Daly took strong 
exception to the notion that Guber and Peters could work at two studios 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
"As chief executives of a studio, they would be heavily involved in creative 
decisions. For example, if Guber and Peters had a new concept for a film or 
were able to attract a promising new literary work or a star actor or director, 
to which studio would they allocate the asset?" Daly asked. 
</P>
<P>
Daly also took issue with Guber's claim that Guber kept his negotiations with 
Sony secret for fear that there might be premature disclosure "and presumably 
trading on inside information, since Columbia and Guber-Peters Entertainment 
Co. are both public companies." The Warner Bros. chairman pointed out that he 
had respected Guber's confidence in the past when Guber confided that he 
intended to make large investments in two other publicly traded entertainment 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Semel, the No. 2 executive at the Warner studio in Burbank, refuted Guber and 
Peters' contentions that he was willing to let them out of their Warner 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not make oral agreements to terminate written agreements, especially when 
they involve key talent and millions of dollars," Semel said in his latest 
filing. According to Semel, Guber was told that Warner would not release him 
from the five-year contract in a phone call on Sept. 25 -- "two days before 
Guber and Peters signed their agreement with Sony." 
</P>
<P>
In that same phone conversation, Guber told Semel that he had "negotiated 
secretly because he feared Mr. Ross would have called (Chairman Akio) Morita of 
Sony and that would have put an end to his negotiations," the Semel affidavit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And Ross, in a new declaration filed Monday, vehemently denied any 
anti-Japanese bias, noting that he had entertained Morita in his home. Ross 
said he never counseled against the sale of CBS Records to a Japanese company, 
although he did suggest a tax-free spinoff to CBS shareholders as most 
beneficial.

Construction Rebounds in September: Contracts for new construction rebounded in 
September from an August slump, making the performance for the third quarter 
equal to the second-quarter rate, F. W. Dodge Group reported. Commercial and 
industrial building joined forces with public works construction to lead 
September's 8% gain in newly started projects to an annualized rate of $274.2 
billion, the division of McGraw-Hill Information Services Co. said. The Dodge 
index (1980 equals 100) climbed to its high for the year of 175 in September.

Interest Rates Up on T-Bills: Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities 
rose at the latest auction. The Treasury sold $7.8 billion of new three-month 
bills at an average discount rate of 7.78%, up from 7.52% last week. Another 
$7.8 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 
7.62%, up from 7.5% last week. The new discount rates understate the actual 
return to investors -- 8.05% for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,799.00 and 8.04% for a six-month bill selling for $9,610.50. The 
discount rate reflects the price discount received when government securities 
are purchased at less than face value.

LABOR: SURPRISE ADMINISTRATION MOVE MAY HELP MINERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What goes on here? 
</P>
<P>
All of a sudden, the anti-union Bush Administration seems to be riding to the 
rescue of the badly crippled United Mine Workers of America, which is embroiled 
in a crucial struggle against what has been an implacable foe, Pittston Coal 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
For six months the Administration callously ignored the bitter and costly 
miners strike. It has disrupted the economies throughout Virginia, West 
Virginia and Kentucky and resulted in the arrest of nearly 4,000 union members, 
mostly for acts of civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Administration intervened last week and now there seems to be a 
good chance of ending the UMW's struggle for survival. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole appointed the remarkably 
successful Bill Usery as "super-mediator" in the war that was showing no signs 
of an early peace. 
</P>
<P>
But Usery, who has had 40 years of experience in labor-management relations, 
says he hopes a settlement can be reached soon enough for the miners to go down 
into the mines again before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
The super-mediator could fail, of course. But those who know Usery well believe 
that some behind-the-scene conversations must have led him to his optimistic 
prediction, even though no one is saying exactly what those conversations might 
have been or who took part in them. 
</P>
<P>
However, here are what might be called some educated guesses: 
</P>
<P>
Dole is a bright, politically ambitious Republican herself, as is her husband, 
Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), the Senate minority leader who ran for President in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
It's unlikely that she would have jumped into the Pittston fray without some 
pretty clear signals that her move would bring political kudos and sighs of 
relief from both sides in the exhausting battle. 
</P>
<P>
One faint signal that the Administration's intervention might help end the 
strike could have come from the company, because the walkout has been effective 
and a serious economic drain on the company. 
</P>
<P>
But Pittston has shown no public sign of a willingness to make even a gesture 
of compromise so far and instead apparently remains intent on breaking the 
strike, if not the union. 
</P>
<P>
Pushing the Administration into its belated intervention is the real 
possibility that Congress may soon pass a bill that would force Pittston to 
retreat on a key issue in the dispute: health-care benefits for miners who 
retired before January, 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed measure was introduced by Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) and 
several other influential Democratic and Republican senators from coal states. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would require Pittston to resume contributions to a multi-employer 
fund that provides health-care benefits for those retirees. The company stopped 
paying into the fund in February, 1988, thereby giving it a competitive 
advantage over other coal companies whose contributions may have to increase to 
make up for the loss from Pittston. 
</P>
<P>
If Pittston is able to keep that advantage, the other companies would almost 
certainly try to drop out of the fund, too, probably sparking a nationwide coal 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed law could avert that threat, but so would a settlement of the 
dispute by the union and company, and the Administration would get credit for 
that achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Some cynics may feel that Dole may be using Usery, with his national reputation 
as a peacemaker, only as a public relations gesture to show that the 
Administration is concerned about the impact of the strike. 
</P>
<P>
But that is unlikely because Usery isn't gullible, and, in fact, the most 
interesting reason for believing that the damaging strike could end soon is the 
personal and business philosophy of Usery. 
</P>
<P>
He is a true believer in the idea that America is best served when labor and 
mangement work cooperatively, and he has said repeatedly that he would never be 
involved in helping a company destroy a union. 
</P>
<P>
After serving for 16 years as a staff executive of the International Assn. of 
Machinists, Usery moved into government service and held such posts as 
secretary of labor and director of the Federal Mediation Service during the 
Republican administrations of Gerald R. Ford and Richard M. Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
Now he is a private labor relations consultant for management, but his clients 
know that while he will drive a hard bargain for management, he will take their 
cases only if they want peace, not war, with labor. 
</P>
<P>
That personal philosophy also helps him gain clients, because most labor 
consultants for management will work either for peaceful settlements of labor 
disputes or to break unions, depending on the clients' orders. Usery doesn't 
play both sides of management's game. 
</P>
<P>
So when he accepted Dole's assignment as a super-mediator in the lengthy coal 
strike, it is almost certain that he had some assurance that Pittston is 
finally ready to end its stubborn resistance to any compromise and negotiate a 
contract settlement with the embittered mine workers. 
</P>
<P>
The strike is hurting the company and causing serious economic and emotional 
problems for members of the union that was founded a century ago by the 
legendary labor leader John L. Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the motives were for the Bush Administration and Dole to intervene in 
the dispute, they will deserve praise if Usery succeeds in his mission to end 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration would be entitled to even more praise if it then moved to 
help resolve the efforts by Frank Lorenzo to break the unions at Eastern Air 
Lines.

BIDDER EMERGES FOR AILING DETROIT PAPER

An investor group has offered to buy the Detroit Free Press for $68 million as 
lawyers prepared for oral arguments in the U.S. Supreme Court in a case 
involving a joint operating agreement with the Detroit News. 
</P>
<P>
William D. McMaster, head of the Michigan Investor Group, made the bid to buy 
the Free Press in a letter Sunday to James K. Batten, president of 
Knight-Ridder Inc., which owns the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"The Michigan Investor Group, if successful in purchasing the Free Press, will 
continue the 158-year-old Detroit Free Press as an ongoing enterprise and will 
convert the editorial format to a 'statewide community newspaper,' " McMaster 
said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of the two newspapers, Gannett Co. and Knight-Ridder, have said the 
JOA would force layoffs and a price increase. Knight-Ridder has said it will 
sell the Free Press or close it if the JOA is denied. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Knight-Ridder's Miami headquarters were reviewing McMaster's 
letter this morning and could not immediately comment on it, corporation 
spokeswoman Heidi Etzold said. 
</P>
<P>
Oral arguments were heard Monday in the JOA case. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the time when all the elements of the case will converge, all the people 
involved will be together for the last time," said William Schultz, an attorney 
for JOA opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court justices may vote on the JOA this week, but their decision 
isn't likely to be made public until next summer. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the nine justices will vote. Justice Byron R. White withdrew from the 
case citing personal reasons. A 4-4 tie would uphold the JOA. 
</P>
<P>
The court may uphold two lower-court approvals of the JOA, reject the merger or 
instruct Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to reconsider the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz represents Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press, a group of 
readers, advertisers, weekly newspaper Publisher W. Edward Wendover, former 
News columnist Matt Beer and state Sen. John Kelly (D-Detroit). 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit Free Press, which declared itself a failing newspaper in May, 1986, 
filed under the Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970 for permission to merge with 
the Detroit News. A JOA allows newspapers to combine business operations but 
maintain editorial independence. 
</P>
<P>
McMaster said he hoped to complete the purchase of the Free Press by the end of 
the year, provided the newspaper supplied the group with statements on its 
operations and assets. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say the merger is prompted by greed and would hurt smaller area 
newspapers. Some question the independence of the two papers under a JOA. 
</P>
<P>
"If this JOA is upheld, we will see the end of competitive journalism in this 
country by the end of the century," said Louis Mleczko, a News reporter and 
president of Local 22 of the Newspaper Guild.

PACEMAKER FIRM TAKES COMPETITION TO HEART; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: SYLMAR'S SIEMENS-PACESETTER HAS UNDERGONE ENORMOUS GROWTH TO BECOME THE 
INDUSTRY'S NO. 2 COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In mid-August, Siemens-Pacesetter Inc., a Sylmar manufacturer of heart 
pacemakers, got federal approval to start selling its latest pacemaker, the 
Synchrony. 
</P>
<P>
The device, which costs doctors $6,300, is the most sophisticated and expensive 
pacemaker Siemens-Pacesetter has yet designed. Chairman Alfred E. Mann believes 
that Synchrony will enable his company, the industry's No. 2 player with about 
25% of the $1.2 billion in annual worldwide pacemaker sales, to grab an 
additional 4% to 5% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
A big jump on the competition? Hardly. Before you could say cardiovascular 
system, Medtronic Inc., the industry leader with about a 43% market share, also 
got federal approval to start selling its Synergist II pacemaker, which 
competes head-on with Synchrony. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Siemens-Pacesetter's ability to bring new products to market in 
tandem with Medtronic reflects its rapid growth over the past decade. A unit of 
the West German conglomerate Siemens AG, Siemens-Pacesetter expects to post 
sales of $250 million for its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, compared to $10.8 
million in 1979, Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
Siemens-Pacesetter has fought to overcome the effects of a 1983 scandal in 
which the company, a former president and two other executives -- but not Mann 
-- pleaded guilty or no contest to federal charges of paying kickbacks totaling 
up to $140,000 to doctors who used Pacesetter's pacemakers. The company and the 
executives were fined between $2,000 and $40,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
Since that low point, Siemens-Pacesetter has continued growing from an also-ran 
to second place in the industry, and its rising stature now forces Medtronic -- 
and the half-dozen or so smaller pacemaker companies -- to stay on their toes. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody views Siemens-Pacesetter as the competition," said Bernard F. 
McDonagh, who follows the industry for the investment firm Piper Jaffray &amp; 
Hopwood in Minneapolis. "You've got Siemens behind them with deep pockets and a 
long-term commitment." 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: Siemens, with $30 billion in annual sales, gave 
Siemens-Pacesetter the go-ahead to build a $30-million, 208,000-square-foot 
plant about a mile from its current headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Mann said "our ambition is to catch up with Medtronic" in leading the industry, 
but he acknowledged that "we have a ways to go." Indeed, although Medtronic's 
sales -- which totaled $742 million in the year ended April 30 -- have slowed 
from their double-digit growth rate of the mid-1980s, they are still growing. 
</P>
<P>
Carol D. Winslow, an analyst with the brokerage firm Dain Bosworth Inc. in 
Minneapolis, where Medtronic is based, said that while Siemens-Pacesetter has 
taken some business away from Medtronic, it is mostly snaring market share from 
smaller competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Siemens-Pacesetter is "probably hurting Medtronic, but they are not eating 
Medtronic's lunch by any means," Winslow said. 
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Americans will get pacemakers this year; another 18,000 of the 
500,000 who already have them will need replacements. The devices cost doctors 
between $2,000 and $6,500, Mann said. The cost to patients, after the doctor 
and hospital have added their fees, is substantially higher. 
</P>
<P>
Pacemakers help the heart maintain a steady beat by electrically sending pulses 
to the heart. Normally, a part of the heart called the sinus node conducts the 
heart's rhythm, slowing it down or speeding it up to match blood flow -- and 
thus oxygen needs -- to match a person's activity. But when the sinus node's 
ability to pace the heart fails, a pacemaker is often needed. 
</P>
<P>
Early pacemakers (the first one was implanted in a human in 1958) simply kept 
the heart at a constant rate of 70-75 beats per minute, regardless of whether 
the patient was running or sleeping. They also were "single-chamber" devices, 
meaning that their pulses were sent only to the lower half of the heart, where 
the main pumping activity occurs. 
</P>
<P>
About 75% of pacemakers sold today remain single-chamber devices. But the new 
versions can adapt the pacemaker's rate to the patient's activity level. Many 
do so with sensors that pick up the body's muscle activity. 
</P>
<P>
The other 25% of pacemakers are "dual-chambered" products, which send pulses to 
both the upper and lower chambers of the heart for patients that need such 
help. And the Cadillacs of the business are the dual-chambered, 
activity-responsive pacemakers such as Synchrony and Synergist II. After they 
are implanted, doctors use a tabletop computer to program the pacemakers, thus 
synchronizing the upper and lower chambers of the heart. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, 63, started the company as Pacesetter Inc. in 1969 with Johns Hopkins 
University, whose Applied Physics Laboratory was searching for ways to improve 
the longevity of pacemakers. After more than a decade of development, 
pacemakers then lasted only about 18 months before they had to be replaced. 
Today, they typically last between five and 20 years, depending on the model 
and the patient's needs. 
</P>
<P>
A Portland, Ore., native, Mann already was running two Los Angeles companies 
that he had founded -- Spectrolab and Heliotek, which made power systems for 
spacecraft -- when he started Pacesetter. He earlier had sold the first two 
companies to Textron, with his share of the proceeds totaling $10 million, but 
continued managing them until he turned his full attention to Pacesetter in 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983 came the kickback scandal. Mann said most of the charges related to a 
program in which Pacesetter gave doctors discounts on Pacesetter pacemakers if 
they used the devices to replace patients' current pacemakers, even if they 
were rival brands. Mann said he approved the program, and "we still don't think 
it was unethical, but it's technically a violation of the Medicare statutes." 
</P>
<P>
Other charges involved some of the Pacesetter executives allegedly paying 
doctors in advance for clinical evaluations of their products. Mann said he was 
not involved in those incidents, which "were totally contrary to my 
directives." 
</P>
<P>
Brian M. Mann, Mann's son and Siemens-Pacesetter's current chief operating 
officer, said the kickback case "had a negative effect, but not a major 
effect," on the company's sales growth. But he said it was not the reason that 
Siemens, which had unsuccessfully made several attempts to invade the U.S. 
pacemaker market itself, bought its way in by purchasing Pacesetter in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Mann declined to disclose the purchase price, but sources said it was 
between $100 million and $200 million, with just under half going to Mann for 
his stake in the company.

JACK SMITH: HITTING SOME HIGH NOTES IN CONDUCTING THE CLASSICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JACK SMITH

<TEXT>
<P>
In writing the other day about Andre Previn's frank conversation with bright 
students after a Philharmonic concert, I probably exposed my musical ignorance 
and my awe of big-time conductors. 
</P>
<P>
They are the ultimate authoritarians; who else can command the exquisite and 
simultaneous response of 100 artists merely with a flick of a baton? Who else 
can decide what novel interpretations to give to Mozart's music, and then do 
it? 
</P>
<P>
Previn is a young man; but if he runs true to form, he will still be conducting 
in his 80s, and will probably live into his 90s. Longevity seems to be a reward 
of life on the podium. Arturo Toscanini lived to be 90; Leopold Stokowski, 95; 
Eugene Ormandy, 86; Bruno Walter, 86; Sir Thomas Beecham, 82; Pierre Monteux, 
89; Arthur Fiedler, 85. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know what accounts for this phenomenon. Probably the act of conducting 
itself, which requires a vigorous exercising of the upper body, promotes good 
health and, consequently, a long life. 
</P>
<P>
Or it may be that a constant exposure to great music in itself has both an 
invigorating and a soothing effect on the conductor's emotional health, 
producing and relieving stress at the same time. I suppose that most musical 
illiterates, like me, have wondered whether the orchestra would play just as 
well if the conductor were not conducting. We all remember that Harry James, 
Glenn Miller and most of the other big-band maestros used to turn their backs 
on their bands periodically, producing no noticeable disorder. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, an orchestra of 40 or 100 musicians, depending on the piece 
being played, surely needs a conductor to avoid the anarchy that many 
individual artists would undoubtedly slide into if left to themselves, and to 
work them into a cohesive and harmonious whole. 
</P>
<P>
I remember seeing a movie in which the fine British actor Ralph Richardson was 
an eccentric old gentleman who played classical records constantly and went 
about his home conducting. He was incredibly inept. None of his motions were at 
all synchronized with the music. So, obviously, not just anybody can do it. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there is a popular notion that the conductor is unnecessary. 
Milton Narwitz sends me a clipping from the sports section reporting that when 
Pittsburgh Steeler Coach Chuck Noll was asked to guest-conduct the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra he sent Steeler business manager Joe Gordon to ask the 
orchestra members what was expected of him. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon reported back: "I asked them what you'd have to know, and they said, 
'Nothing.' The musicians don't pay any attention to the conductor anyway." 
</P>
<P>
"Sounds like football," Noll said, and took the job. 
</P>
<P>
"It confirms what I have maintained for 60 of my 80 years," says Narwitz. "The 
orchestra before the conductor are all experts and -- in following the score -- 
will get the same result." 
</P>
<P>
That is, of course, an attitude that is easily espoused by us ignoramuses. But 
anyone who has ever watched Zubin Mehta work an orchestra into a frenzy with 
his herculean calisthenics has to believe they couldn't do it without him. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, Duke Russell sends me a clipping from The Tidings, which shows that 
music has its Casey Stengels. Music critic Henry Roth recalls a number of non 
sequiturs and syntactical gems collected by members of the Philadelphia 
Orchestra from the lips of Eugene Ormandy. 
</P>
<P>
The maestro is said to have inquired, "Who is sitting in that empty chair?" 
Also, "Why do you always insist on playing when I'm trying to conduct?" And 
this: "If you don't have it in your part, leave it out, because there is enough 
missing already." 
</P>
<P>
It is perhaps irrelevant to this subject, but I'm afraid that if I don't tell 
this story now I will never be able to work it in. Recently, condensing the 
plot of "Tosca," I noted that in the end the soprano jumps off a parapet to her 
death, out of sight. I guessed that she jumped into a net. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver McBain recalls a performance of Tosca (he thinks it was Scottish Opera) 
in which the management had arranged for Tosca to jump down onto a trampoline, 
instead of into a net. "In an unusual twist to Puccini's original intentions," 
he writes, "Tosca bounced back for one final look at her beloved Caravadossi." 
</P>
<P>
I'd rather have seen that than to have heard Caruso sing "O Sole Mio."

YOUR BODY: 'MARRYING UP' COULD BE THE BEST DIET FOR WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY

<TEXT>
<P>
Women who "marry up" to men with greater education tend to be leaner, stay 
leaner and become even thinner over time than women who "marry down" to men of 
lower educational levels, finds Stanley M. Garn, a professor of nutrition in 
the University of Michigan's School of Public Health. "The higher the husband's 
educational level," says the researcher who correlated weight and educational 
degrees of more than 1,000 husbands and wives, "the leaner the wife." 
</P>
<P>
Garn, who published his findings in the current American Journal of Clinical 
Nutrition, speculates peer pressure plays a vital role in weight control: Women 
who marry up are more likely to be surrounded by lean women than those who 
marry down. 
</P>
<P>
Although the nutritionist found the husbands' weight wasn't influenced by their 
wives' education, Jody Lander Spector, a dietitian who directs a weight-loss 
program at St. Vincent Medical Center, counsels several couples who obviously 
got fat together. "I blame it on getting too comfortable with each other,"she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Next on Garn's research agenda: To investigate whether second wives of highly 
educated men stay as thin as spouse No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Infant Sleep 
</P>
<P>
To sleep-deprived parents of newborn babies, it's a promising bit of folklore: 
Feed them cereal at bedtime, and they'll sleep through the night. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Clinic Foundation researchers tested this homespun advice by 
comparing the sleep habits of more than 100 infants fed bedtime cereal starting 
at five weeks and at four months of age. Parents kept track of their kids' 
fussiness, crying and sleep times. In the end, the Ohio researchers found no 
significant differences in sleep habits between the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
They concluded what some parents have always suspected: kids sleep through the 
night when they're developmentally ready -- regardless of their bedtime snack. 
</P>
<P>
According to a spokeswoman, the Committee on Nutrition for the American Academy 
of Pediatrics recommends holding off on solid foods such as bedtime cereal for 
five or six months. "Introducing foods too early may decrease a baby's interest 
in nursing and increase an likelihood of allergies if there's a family 
history,"says Audrey Naylor, San Diego pediatrician affliated with the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the news for sleep-weary parents isn't all bad. The Ohio researchers 
discovered their subjects, however fussy, eventually let their parents get some 
shut-eye. By age 12 weeks, most of the babies slept six straight hours and, by 
age 20 weeks, eight hours at a stretch.

ART BUCHWALD: BEWITCHED, BOTHERED, BEWILDERED

<TEXT>
<P>
Lots of strange things happened in the White House during the Reagan years. It 
has been confirmed that both the President and the First Lady ran the country 
by astrology. What is not known is that they also consulted a Halloween witch. 
</P>
<P>
At least, that's the story I heard from a lady who flew into my office on a 
broom the other day. She was wearing a mask, a large orange and black pointed 
hat and a Bill Blass black cape. She was also chewing a wad of tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all of this, I was skeptical that she was really the Reagans' witch. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the wicked witch of the upstairs," she cackled. "I only came down on 
Halloween, but I was in the house all the time, scaring the hell out of Al 
Haig. The Reagans depended on me for every decision." 
</P>
<P>
She threw sand on my desk and waved a cat's paw over my fax machine. "I used to 
fly around the Reagan bedroom every night giving them advice. I'm talking now 
because Nancy left me out of her book." 
</P>
<P>
"She may have had her reasons for that, but why did Don Regan leave you out of 
his book too? He put everyone else in." 
</P>
<P>
She smiled and her black teeth dazzled me. "Regan was not aware of my 
existence. He just knew about the stargazer. The rat became suspicious once 
when he saw an astronomical White House bill for frogs' gizzards, which I was 
using to figure out U.S. defense needs. Fortunately, Nancy told him that they 
were part of her dog's diet." 
</P>
<P>
"Why would the Reagans need a witch to run the country when they already had an 
astrologer?" 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Reagan always insisted on a second opinion. That's what made him such a 
great President. The astrologer studied the heavens, while I depended on 
Valentino scraps." 
</P>
<P>
"Valentino scraps?" 
</P>
<P>
"They came from one of Nancy's dressmakers. Every night Valentino swept the 
floor and sent the scraps over to me. I mixed them with Elizabeth Taylor's 
perfume and smeared the concoction all over my arms and legs. It was very 
helpful when I had to make decisions about the deficit." 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a put-on," I told her. "I have heard of astrologers who made 
vital decisions affecting this country, but I've never heard of a witch being 
involved with national policy." 
</P>
<P>
"Who do you think shredded Ollie North's papers?" 
</P>
<P>
"Ollie and Fawn." 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted you to think that. I went over there and dumped all the evidence 
into a caldron. Then I added some Paul Newman spaghetti sauce and made a stew." 
</P>
<P>
"The stew was never mentioned at the trial." 
</P>
<P>
"The White House wouldn't allow it," she said. "Are you aware that Reagan asked 
me to put a curse on Noriega?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, I'm not. What did you do?" 
</P>
<P>
"I made a potion of Coor's beer, yogurt, Weight Watchers sweet potatoes and 
United Airlines macadamia nuts. After all the members of the National Security 
Council drank some, they decided that Noriega was dead." 
</P>
<P>
"What was the real reason you came out of the closet at this time?" I asked 
her. 
</P>
<P>
"The astrologer was taking all the credit for Grenada, and it was my idea. I 
mentioned it to the President on Halloween." 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to believe that the country would be in the hands of someone 
involved in witchcraft. Did anyone apart from the Reagans know?" 
</P>
<P>
"George Bush -- which is why he told everybody that Reagan was hooked on voodoo 
economics."

ERMA BOMBECK: HOW TO DRESS TO EXPRESS HALLOWEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since fashion has become deregulated and anything goes, it has become harder 
and harder to dress for Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
Say a guy is standing at the door with long hair, a bandanna on his head and a 
ring in his ear. Is he a pirate? In your dreams. He's your daughter's date, 
better known as a Maalox Moment. 
</P>
<P>
Slinking in the darkness is a kid wearing baggy pants, a nylon stocking over 
his face and a sweat shirt. Is he a bum looking for a treat? No, he just ripped 
off someone's tape deck. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street is a girl with a pillowcase, dressed in stone-washed jeans, 
cowboy boots and a 10-gallon hat. Is she dressed as a cowgirl begging for a 
treat? Get real. She's Maxine and Ed's daughter bringing her laundry home from 
college. 
</P>
<P>
What constitutes a "costume" has changed with the years, but the one thing that 
never changes is that most people wait until the 11th hour to come up with one. 
Since our grown kids perceive our closets to house the greatest collection of 
period costumes (vintage 1970) outside the Smithsonian, the decision of what to 
wear to a Halloween party starts here. 
</P>
<P>
"Mom, where's that corny little dress with the drop waist? I could put a ribbon 
in my hair and go as Alice in Wonderland." (I'm wearing it.) 
</P>
<P>
"Mom, do you still have that apron you used to wear when we were kids? I could 
dress as a maid." 
</P>
<P>
"Mom, loan me a white wig and pearls to look like Barbara Bush." 
</P>
<P>
"Wait a minute. Two pillows under your favorite T-shirt and I could be a 
pregnant Fergie." 
</P>
<P>
"Where are Dad's wild golf pants? It's a great mid-life crisis disguise." 
</P>
<P>
For the last three years my son has gone to a party as Gandhi. It's an easy 
decision. Only at our house could he open Pandora's box and find such instant 
treasures as a clean sheet, dark make-up and granny glasses. However, I think 
last October was his last fling. Someone approached him at a party and thought 
he was Charlton Heston. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between adults and children at Halloween is that most adults 
wouldn't dream of wearing a store-bought costume. It's like admitting you don't 
have the imagination of a food processor. And maybe therein lies the challenge. 
Are you dressed as Madonna or did you just come from work? 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, my husband and I answered the doorbell and a small ghost and a 
witch pointed their fingers at us and said, "We got it. He's a football coach 
and you're a plumber." My husband was wearing his sweats and I was lounging 
around in a jumpsuit. We gave them each an apple. They reached in their bags 
and gave us two popcorn balls.

GEORGIANS ARE ABOUT TO GIVE SAN DIEGANS A WHIRL; 
</P>
<P>
DANCE: THIS TROUPE, PART OF WHAT IS ARGUABLY THE SOVIET UNION'S NO. 1 CULTURAL 
EXPORT, WAS THE FIRST ATTRACTION IN THE ARTS FESTIVAL TO SELL OUT, AND A 
PERFORMANCE WAS ADDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that the Soviet arts festival is well under way, more and more San Diego 
audiences are discovering the beauty, power and diversity of treasures from the 
Soviet Union. From contemporary theater to traditional puppetry -- and, of 
course, the much-ballyhooed Faberge eggs -- the Soviet arts are firmly 
entrenched on San Diego soil. 
</P>
<P>
But Soviet dance, arguably the country's No. 1 artistic export, has yet to make 
a full-scale formal debut on a San Diego stage. That welcome event is scheduled 
for 8 p.m. Wednesday, when the Georgian State National Singing and Dancing 
Ensemble -- an ethnic troupe composed of 87 dancers, singers and musicians 
representing various regions of Soviet Georgia -- bows in at the Spreckels 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The Georgian dancers will perform nine shows at the Spreckels before the last 
curtain call Sunday night, as well as the 70-plus performances planned for 
outreach programs in local schools, colleges, military bases and senior citizen 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Although Georgian folk forms are far less familiar to American audiences than 
Russian ballet (which, ironically, is not among the art forms included in the 
festival), the Georgian troupe was the first to sell out in San Diego. In fact, 
as Tatiana Popova, local liaison for the troupe, noted, "It was sold out at the 
very beginning, and we had to add three matinees." A fourth matinee has since 
been added for 11 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Popova selected the slate of dance offerings on the company's San Diego 
program, opting for a mix that would "give people a taste of every style of 
Georgian dance." 
</P>
<P>
Because Georgian dance is unique in many ways, most local aficionados will be 
surprised at what they see, especially the dancing from the mountain regions. 
Black-booted macho men pounce vigorously on pointe, then crash down to a hard 
landing on their knees, in sharp contrast to the ethereal beauty of balletic 
pointe work (performed only by female dancers). 
</P>
<P>
Georgian women, on the other hand, glide gracefully across the floor, hardly 
moving their feet and looking more like ice skaters than dancers. The sexes 
never touch, not even when they pair off for the obligatory couples dances. 
</P>
<P>
The Georgians "are the only ones in the world to do male pointe work," Popova 
acknowledged. "And they dance only on the soft tips of their boots. The women's 
gliding is done by other races, but it reached its pinnacle with the 
Georgians." 
</P>
<P>
Georgian men and women dance together, but they are careful to avoid physical 
contact, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the reason the men wear very long sleeves, so the women can hold the 
fabric during the dancing. They can never actually touch, and the women can 
never do anything to attract the men's attention. The women's eyes are always 
looking down. 
</P>
<P>
"The dancing reflects their culture," Popova said. "It's been that way for 
centuries. There are three ways to say 'no' (in Georgian) and only one word for 
'yes.' That tells you something about the way they are." 
</P>
<P>
The late George Balanchine, New York City Ballet's resident genius and the 
doyen of modern ballet, professed that ballet is woman. And he made the 
feminine ideal the centerpiece of his neoclassic style. 
</P>
<P>
As the Georgian State National Singing and Dance Ensemble's administrative 
manager, Kaizer Kasradze, noted in an interview last week: "That is a national 
idea of Georgia, which Balanchine put into modern dance. The woman is always 
the center in Georgian dance. You know Balanchine was a native of Georgia, and 
his brother (a musician and composer) still lives there. 
</P>
<P>
"There is probably a Georgian influence in Balanchine's development of modern 
ballet," Kasradze said through an interpreter, with a warm laugh. "All 
Georgians adore women. They are put on a pedestal." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, folk dancing conjures up negative images in the American mind 
set, Popova lamented. 
</P>
<P>
"The American stereotype of a folk dancer is an amateur, dancing for 
recreational purposes. They do not appreciate it as a viable art form," she 
said. "But not only is ethnic dancing considered an equal to ballet, it has a 
higher priority (in the Soviet Union) because it is of the people. 
</P>
<P>
"It has had an important influence on ballet as well -- in the character 
dancing," she said. "And the ethnic dancing that is presented on stage is all 
very high-caliber. The dance companies in the Soviet Union are always very well 
trained, including the amateurs." 
</P>
<P>
You have to start learning the male pointe dancing when you're 5 years old -- 
even 3 years old," said Kasradze, who started his career with the troupe as a 
singer. "It's in your genes and in your blood. It dates back thousands of years 
in our history, and it probably started because they were mountain people, and 
there were very narrow places, so they danced on tiptoe." 
</P>
<P>
Included in the Georgians' arsenal of kinetic tricks is some stirring sword 
play for the men -- all performed while they hurtle through space in vigorous 
leaps or twirl around in dizzying spins. But they have no trouble recruiting 
male dancers for these swashbuckling acrobatics. And men dancers outnumber the 
women more than 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Every Georgian male wants to dance," Kasradze said, flashing a knowing grin, 
"because the best dancers get the girls." 
</P>
<P>
In this troupe, however, the singers share the kudos, and Kasradze pointed out 
proudly that "the dances (represent) only part of the experience. We have 
different styles of dancing from seven regions in the show, and there are 
different styles of singing from each, too. Our music is very polyphonic -- 
Bach style, but the Georgians had it centuries before." 
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, local dance buffs saw a few of the dances headed this way, 
when another authentic troupe from Georgia made a whistle stop in San Diego. 
But this extended residency for the Georgians and their 22-member children's 
group (which will perform at public venues around town) should bring the 
ancient art form to 65,000 schoolchildren, as well as the 12,000 people who 
attend performances at the Spreckels. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Area Dance Alliance, spearheaded by executive director Tom 
Corcoran, is sponsoring the troupe's stay in San Diego. That represents a 
departure for an organization that was created to promote local dance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time we've ever done anything like this, but it should be a big 
benefit to local dance," Corcoran said. "We're providing workshops and master 
classes for San Diego dancers. We also feel we're serving the city in producing 
the festival in a first-class manner, and, at the same time, we're heightening 
an awareness for the dance alliance. We're showcasing four or five local 
companies with the Georgians, and that's a wonderful opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets agree. 
</P>
<P>
"We're happy to work with the American dancers, and we're planning to have 
lessons in American dances," Kasradze said. "We think very soon in the future 
we'll be showing one of the American numbers in our Georgian performances."

ROCKEFELLERS SELL JAPANESE MOST OF REALTY UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Mitsubishi Estate Co., one of Japan's leading real estate concerns, announced 
here today that it has invested $846 million for a 51% stake in the Rockefeller 
Group, making the firm a major partner in such American icons as New York 
City's Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Rockefeller Group said that, although the purchase gives 
Mitsubishi Estate controlling interest in the group, the tie-up is expected to 
be treated as a "partnership" without any significant changes in management 
objectives or personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the deal is steeped with symbolic significance. It marks the transfer to 
a foreign buyer of control over high-profile vestiges of the historic 
Rockefeller family's economic might, built by the legendary John D. Rockefeller 
in the late 19th Century through his powerful Standard Oil trust. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Estate's purchase follows a string of acquisitions of landmark U.S. 
properties by Japanese investors. In downtown Los Angeles, Mitsubishi Estate is 
one of the developers of the Citicorp Plaza high-rise complex at 8th and 
Figueroa streets, and Japanese investors have acquired other big chunks of 
prime real estate elsewhere in Los Angeles, New York and other major U.S. 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
The Mitsubishi-Rockefeller deal also was announced amid controversy over other 
conspicuous Japanese investments in the United States, including Sony Corp.'s 
re cent agreement to buy Columbia Pictures for $3.4 billion. It is not clear 
whether the Rockefeller deal will engender the same kind of negative backlash, 
however, because the mechanics of the transaction appear to differ from many of 
the recent Japanese acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than directly purchasing property, Mitsubishi Estate obtained 627,000 
shares of common stock in the Rockefeller Group, which was privately held by 
various Rockefeller family trusts controlled by an independent trust committee. 
The group owns and manages 14 office buildings in New York, including 
Rockefeller Center. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Woodhull, a real estate analyst for Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. in Tokyo, 
said the fact that Mitsubishi Estate purchased shares in the buildings, rather 
than the properties themselves, might serve to shield the company from 
criticism that it is "buying the heart of America," one of the charges leveled 
at Sony during the highly emotional reaction to its planned Columbia takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Burstein, the New York author of "Yen: Japan's New Financial Empire and 
Its Threat to America," raised similar points, adding that the form of the 
purchase "is a response and reflection on the Japanese side that Americans 
don't want the perception that their companies and businesses are being sold 
lock, stock and barrel to Japanese investors." 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's a very intelligent and sane approach. The money is going to 
come to this side of the Pacific. That's sort of inevitable. The question is: 
What is the way to (invest) that doesn't get American backs up?" 
</P>
<P>
Amy Trotta, spokeswoman for the Rockefeller Group, said that a 51% stake in the 
group was sold to Mitsubishi Estate because that was the amount of the shares 
that needed to be sold off to meet the "fiduciary duties" of the Rockefeller 
family trust, which had too much capital concentrated in one part of its 
holdings. 
</P>
<P>
With the purchase, however, Mitsubishi Estate apparently indirectly acquired 
only a 14.5% share in Rockefeller Center. The Rockefeller Group divested itself 
of 71.5% of the center in 1985 in a public offering of shares, and it retained 
only a 28.5% interest at the time of the Mitsubishi deal, according to Trotta. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no business address in the world that has the same cachet as 
Rockefeller Center," Jotaro Takagi, president of Mitsubishi Estate, said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old Rockefeller Center is a 19-building, 22-acre Art Deco complex 
that includes such landmarks as the Radio City Music Hall and the old RCA 
building, now known as 30 Rockefeller Plaza. The center, opened during the 
Depression, has been immortalized in songs, such as George and Ira Gershwin's 
1937 ditty, "They All Laughed," which goes: "They all laughed at Rockefeller 
Center, now they're begging to get in." 
</P>
<P>
Rockefeller Group's holdings include Rockefeller Center Management Corp., which 
runs Rockefeller Center; Rockefeller Center Development Corp., which owns 
developments in New York and New Jersey, and Rockefeller Group 
Telecommunications Services, which provides telecommunications services for 
tenants of Rockefeller Center and other customers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Rockefeller Group owns Radio City Music Hall Productions, an 
entertainment production company that not only stages the annual Christmas 
spectacular at Radio City Music Hall but also planned such extravaganzas as the 
anniversaries of the Eiffel Tower and the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Another holding is an 80% interest in New York-based Cushman &amp; Wakefield 
Inc., one of the nation's largest real estate brokerage firms. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockefeller family empire dates to John D. Rockefeller, America's first 
billionaire, who was born in 1839 in modest circumstances. He rose from a job 
as a bookkeeper to build what became known as the Standard Oil trust, which 
eventually was broken up in 1911 by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
John D. Rockefeller's son, John Jr., went on to build Rockefeller Center. The 
Rockefeller Group that has held the center has been controlled by the trusts 
that John Jr. established in 1934 to provide for his six children and their 
descendants, now numbering about 85. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes magazine recently estimated the family's fortune at more than $5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Estate is a member of the Mitsubishi Group, one of Japan's leading 
conglomerates, and is the custodian of much of the vast landholdings assembled 
by the former zaibatsu, as pre-World War II family-owned industrial monopolies 
are known. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi typifies the business practices -- interlocking directorates, 
cross-shareholdings and tight group loyalties -- that are currently being 
criticized by U.S. officials as posing structural impediments to free trade 
with Japan. Mitsubishi and five other major financial-industrial combines 
together control 25% of the Japanese economy, according to a report issued 
earlier this year by the Japan Fair Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Sales for the real estate company in the fiscal year ended March 31 were about 
$2 billion, while after-tax profits totaled $250 million.

<P>
Exclusivist Japan suddenly has become a beacon of hope for tens of thousands of 
poor Asians. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the number of illegal foreign workers in Japan was about 100,000. 
But now, "it may be as many as 300,000," said Mitsuaki Yoshimen, who heads a 
Labor Ministry unit dealing with foreign workers. "We don't know what the real 
number is. It keeps increasing steadily." 
</P>
<P>
Police are arresting and deporting illegal foreign workers at a rate of more 
than 18,000 a year. The illegals have been found in all but two of Japan's 47 
prefectures (states). Most of them come from Pakistan, the Philippines, 
Malaysia and South Korea. Since May, about 1,700 Chinese, mostly from Fujian 
province in the People's Republic of China, have arrived by boat posing as 
Vietnamese refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The initial official reaction was in line with the Japanese instinct to protect 
their country's homogeneity. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's Cabinet tightened 
screening of "boat people" and other illegal immigrants and reaffirmed a ban on 
foreigners taking unskilled jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But for a nation rated among the world's most exclusionary, Japan has displayed 
a surprising -- and growing -- degree of receptivity to the flow of foreigners. 
For instance: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Three Cabinet ministers have argued for a new policy of accepting foreign 
workers for specified periods. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A poll by the Justice Ministry found that 47% of the respondents supported 
accepting foreign workers for unskilled jobs if the positions could not be 
filled by Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In a survey by the Tokyo metropolitan government, 64% said they believed 
they could work smoothly with foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Small Enterprises Agency of the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry (MITI) reported in an annual white paper that nearly 60% of the 
nation's small-business people want to employ unskilled foreign workers. Japan 
already accepts skilled foreign workers, and their numbers, too, have been 
increasing without stirring up any controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Most astonishing of all in a country often condemned as a closed society, 
NHK, the semi-government radio and television network, devoted three hours of 
evening prime-time TV to a debate on whether Japan should accept unskilled 
foreign labor. Two "open door" advocates were pitted against two "closed 
nation" proponents. 
</P>
<P>
The major impetus for the change has come from an increasingly severe domestic 
labor shortage, particularly in what Japanese are now calling "three-K" jobs. 
Average Japanese, employers complain, don't want to do anything that is kitanai 
(dirty), kitsui (hard) or kiken (dangerous). 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's is now offering $7.14 an hour as starting pay for workers at some of 
its restaurants in Tokyo, compared to the average of $4.60 that the hamburger 
chain pays its employees in the United States. Bars and nightclubs post 
advertisements in their bathrooms for part-time waiters and waitresses. Some 
fast-food and family restaurant chains have been forced to curtail their hours 
of operation because they can't find enough workers. 
</P>
<P>
On average, four jobs go begging for each person seeking part-time employment. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as last year, there was no visible sentiment at all in favor of 
accepting unskilled foreign labor. 
</P>
<P>
That exclusionary attitude was so marked that in August, 1979, even Japan's 
prime minister lamented the closed nature of his country's society. After the 
Indochinese refugee issue was a major topic at that year's Tokyo economic 
summit, Prime Minister Masayashi Ohira, in a nationally televised interview, 
said that "all Japanese have a desire to lead an existence as a homogeneous 
society with a single language," adding, "A country with this kind of nature is 
not good." 
</P>
<P>
The late prime minister declared that he personally would like to see Japan 
become a nation in which "people from all nations could reside and make a 
living" but said that "we have a long way to go" before that could happen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Met by Silence 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Ohira's comments produced no reaction. But now, some Japanese are 
beginning to echo them. 
</P>
<P>
In an editorial, the Japan Times said recently that "as an outstanding economic 
power (with) a past of committing wrongs in this part of the world, (Japan) 
should be more positive toward sharing part of the fruits of its economic 
success with its Asian neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima of Nagasaki urged acceptance of foreign workers and 
said his city would accept them for humanitarian reasons. Scholars also have 
supported admitting unskilled labor as a form of aid to Japan's neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the illegals come into Japan armed with visas as language students or 
tourists and then take jobs. Many, including those who enter the country 
legally on visas as entertainers, remain beyond the period they are legally 
permitted to stay. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1.7 million Asians are expected to enter Japan legally this year, 
compared to about 1.4 million last year. Descendants of Japanese immigrants to 
South American countries, who are allowed to spend as long as three years 
"visiting relatives," also are arriving by the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
Other countries in the Pacific from which illegals are coming to Japan -- 
including Australia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and even South Korea -- also 
report a growing influx of illegal workers. But even low wages here so outstrip 
the average pay in developing countries that Japan is a special target. 
</P>
<P>
It is no deterrent that word has spread widely of the ill-treatment that the 
illegals often receive here. For example, illegal male workers, about 
three-quarters of the total, often have to pay part of their wages to gang 
leaders who arrange for them to come and then sell their labor to Japanese 
companies. For many foreign women, prostitution is the fate that awaits them 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the newspaper Asahi told the story of one Brazilian of Japanese 
descent brought here by a Japanese company whose executives were later arrested 
for violating a law regulating employment agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese-Brazilian said the company arranged wages for him that were 20 
times what he earned in Brazil -- and provided an apartment to boot. The 
employment agency, which was estimated to have earned $48.6 million in 
supplying foreign laborers to auto parts manufacturers over the last three 
years, raked off $4.23 for every hour he worked, but he still took home $7.14 
an hour. 
</P>
<P>
In its monthly economic report for September, the Economic Planning Agency 
declared that "the shortage of labor is becoming increasingly serious." 
</P>
<P>
Mitsuru Takahashi, a Labor Ministry employment planning officer, said the 
shortage is reaching serious proportions in the construction, service and 
retailing industries. 
</P>
<P>
Construction firms are unable to find 34% of the labor they need, he said. In 
particular, riggers -- who lay scaffolding for construction work -- are so 
scarce that more than half of the jobs available for them go unfilled, he 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
"No young people are entering that trade any more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The shortage, Takahashi added, also is hurting such industries as automobile 
and auto parts manufacturing and metal and steel fabrication. 
</P>
<P>
With the nationwide unemployment rate at only 2.2%, an average of 132 jobs are 
available for every 100 workers seeking employment. As recently as June, 1988, 
workers seeking employment outnumbered the jobs available, a situation that has 
prevailed for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Predictions Wrong 
</P>
<P>
The turnabout also has defied predictions made by MITI. Overseas investment by 
Japanese manufacturers, the ministry predicted in 1987, would strip 600,000 
jobs from the manufacturing sector in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, nearly 1.2 million new jobs have been created in the last 12 months, 
with 580,000 of them in manufacturing, in addition to 540,000 new jobs in 
service industries. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionalists such as Eiji Suzuki, chairman of the Japan Employers Federation 
(Nikkeiren), continue their reflexive rejection of unskilled foreign laborers. 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki argues that the government "should send the refugees home. Unskilled 
foreign laborers must not be allowed. The increase in illegal foreign workers 
is already causing trouble. The construction industry, which is suffering the 
worst shortage, should persevere," reducing the pace of its projects, if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Ultra-rightists have staged rallies and argued that unskilled foreign workers 
would destroy the "identity" of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Many average Japanese, too, have expressed fears that unskilled foreign 
laborers would bring crime and slums to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
So frequently has West Germany been held up as an example of "failure" in 
welcoming immigrant labor that Bonn's ambassador to Tokyo, Hans Joachim 
Hallier, felt the need to contradict the image publicly, declaring that 
immigrant labor in West Germany, in fact, has been a success. Its contributions 
to West Germany's economy, he said, outweigh the temporary problems that arose 
when the country's economy slowed down. 
</P>
<P>
If West Germany did make a mistake, it was in failing to limit the stay of 
foreign workers, Hallier said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal that appears to be gaining support in Japan would avoid that 
shortcoming. Last May, an advisory commission of the Economic Planning Agency 
recommended that the government accept unskilled foreign laborers but impose 
restrictions on their numbers and their length of stay. Agreements would be 
negotiated with other nations to fix quotas for unskilled labor from each 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Already, both the Philippines and Malaysia have offered to provide laborers and 
guarantee their return within a specified period. 
</P>
<P>
"Preparations must be made to handle foreign workers not just as providers of 
labor at cheap wages but to treat them as human beings. We must consider not 
just their labor but also their livelihood, especially such things as housing 
and medical insurance," said Yoshimen of the Labor Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ministry Opposed 
</P>
<P>
But he added that the ministry remains opposed to admitting unskilled foreign 
workers even with specific limits. 
</P>
<P>
"Will they really go home at the end of the period they are allowed to stay? 
Employers also may wish to retain them a little longer because, by the time 
their period of stay is expired, they would have learned their jobs well," 
Yoshimen said. "Japan would have to provide the social facilities to support 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Pressure upon the government to accept unskilled foreign laborers, he said, has 
increased as a result of a boom in domestic demand. 
</P>
<P>
"But no one knows how long economic conditions will remain good, and when they 
turn downward, the demands for foreign labor will ease," he warned. 
</P>
<P>
Only three years ago, the official noted, the economy was in a doldrums, 
unemployment rose to 3.2% and "the Labor Ministry was criticized for not 
developing a better employment policy. No one was advocating opening the labor 
market to foreign workers then," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pinch that many industries are feeling, the worker shortage has not 
yet swept through the entire labor market. Yoshimen pointed out that it is 
focused on a demand for young workers and is concentrated in large urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
"There are few companies seeking older workers," he said, noting that for every 
100 men 55 and older seeking employment, only 20 jobs are being offered. By 
contrast, 277 jobs are available for every 100 youths 19 or younger. 
</P>
<P>
Nor has the labor shortage spurred inflation, thanks to productivity increases 
that have enabled employers to more than cover wage increases, the Labor 
Ministry's Takahashi said. 
</P>
<P>
In the short term, the ministry plans to try to cure the imbalance between 
supply and demand of labor, he said, by promoting the use of women and older 
workers, re-training labor and combatting regional gaps in employment. 
</P>
<P>
In the longer term, however, a labor shortage that Japan has never experienced 
is on the horizon. It will start in 1995 and last at least 10 years as Japan's 
population between the ages of 15 and 64 drops drastically, Takahashi said. 
</P>
<P>
That's when a debate on foreign labor will be unavoidable, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
The number of Japanese between the ages of 15 and 64 is rising -- an increase 
of 4.6 million is expected between 1985 and 1995. But after that, it is 
expected to decline sharply -- by 2.3 million in the decade beginning in 1995. 
In an age group crucial for the job market, the ranks of 15- to 29-year-olds 
will shrink by more than 4.4 million. If economic demand in Japan is as strong 
then as it is now, Japanese may have to choose between stagnation or accepting 
foreign workers. The likely decision is foreign workers.

COURT OKS SHARED LIABILITY OF DRUG FIRMS IN DES CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The Supreme Court Monday let stand a state ruling that allows victims of a 
dangerous drug to collect a share of damages from all of the drug's makers and 
sellers, even those that can demonstrate they did not provide the drug to a 
particular patient. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, a company is required to pay damages only to individuals who used 
that firm's product. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the case of DES, a drug sold to many pregnant women to prevent 
miscarriages until the government banned it in 1972, the victims said that they 
could not always trace the companies that made and sold the drug. DES was 
banned after it was linked to cancer in both the mothers who took the drug and 
their daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the New York courts took a different approach in determining 
liability. In a practice upheld by the state's high court last April, they 
proposed to assess each company according to its share of the DES market, 
regardless of whether it was involved in the manufacture or sale of the drug in 
a particular case. 
</P>
<P>
It was this ruling, by the New York Court of Appeals, that the Supreme Court 
let stand by refusing to hear the appeals filed by three drug companies (Rexall 
vs. Tigue, 89-168, and E. R. Squibb vs. Hymowitz, 89-204). Eli Lilly &amp; Co. 
joined in the Rexall suit. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court's action was the latest in a series of decisions in which the 
court, despite its conservative tenor, came down against business and on the 
side of the state courts. 
</P>
<P>
The New York courts' approach to DES is not the first time that state courts 
have assessed product liability damages according to manufacturers' shares of 
the market. In 1980, the California Supreme Court first adopted this "market 
share" theory of liability in DES litigation. 
</P>
<P>
But the California court allowed companies to escape responsibility for damages 
in particular cases if they could show they did not make or sell the DES to the 
woman bringing suit. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the New York court did not allow any makers or sellers of DES to 
escape liability. It concluded it would be "more appropriate for the loss to be 
borne by those that produced the drug . . . even where the precise manufacturer 
cannot be identified in a particular action." 
</P>
<P>
In appealing to the Supreme Court, lawyers for Squibb, which manufactured the 
drug, and Rexall, which sold it, said they had firm evidence that several women 
who filed suit in New York did not buy DES made by Squibb or sold by Rexall. 
The Constitution's guarantee of "due process of law," they argued, protected 
them from punishment for a wrong they did not commit. 
</P>
<P>
A. Edward Grashof, an attorney representing Rexall, said the high court's 
dismissal of the appeal was "very discouraging to the pharmaceutical industry." 
He noted, however, that companies do not believe DES caused the cancer suffered 
by several of the plaintiffs in the New York cases, and they will argue that 
issue during their trials. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, in a setback for military contractors, the Supreme Court let stand 
a $4.25-million award against General Dynamics for having made a defective 
ventilation valve in a Navy submarine. The defect resulted in the death of five 
Navy divers in 1982, and their families won the damage award in a suit against 
the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Just last year, the Supreme Court had appeared to shield the defense industry 
from all suits by servicemen or their survivors. In the case of Boyle vs. 
United Technologies, the justices said contractors were immune from suits for 
military products made according to the government's "reasonably precise 
specifications." 
</P>
<P>
However, in February, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans 
ruled that Pentagon officials must do more than "rubber stamp" the plans 
submitted by private contractors. In this instance, the appeals court said, the 
submarine plans submitted by General Dynamics were simply approved by the 
Pentagon without much consideration. Therefore, the damage verdict against the 
contractor can be upheld, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
In their unsuccessful appeal to the high court, lawyers for General Dynamics 
said this appeals court ruling "essentially dismantles and emasculates the 
government contractor defense" established in the Boyle case. (General Dynamics 
vs. Trevino, 89-376.)

STATE PANEL ORDERS EVALUATION OF PRISONER TRANSPORT FIRM 
</P>

<P>
After hearing from prisoners who said they were raped and abused while they 
were being transported cross-country from one jail to another, a legislative 
committee ordered an evaluation Monday of all the state's contracts with a 
private extradition company. 
</P>
<P>
In deciding to request the evaluation, the Joint Prisons Committee overrode 
several of its members who had called for the immediate cancellation of the 
state's contract with Tennessee-based Extradition Corp. of America. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on what we've heard today, I think the department (of Corrections) ought 
to cancel this contract right now," Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson) 
said. "We shouldn't play this game with people's lives and liberty." 
</P>
<P>
As a cost-saving measure, the state began contracting with private firms in 
1987 to transport prisoners who were either being extradited to California or 
from California. In May, 1988, Extradition Corp. of America won an exclusive 
contract with California to transport prisoners interstate. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Corrections officials estimate that the contract with the company 
saves the state more than $1 million a year in transportation costs. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles County officials and a lawyer for several prisoners said the 
savings are misleading because the company often cuts corners in order to earn 
a profit. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Watson, a Los Angeles lawyer who represents seven prisoners who plan to 
sue the state, said sometimes as many as 14 or 15 prisoners were packed into 
the back of van where they were forced to ride for days and weeks without 
adequate food, rest or bathing. 
</P>
<P>
She said one man, an amputee, is no longer able to wear a prosthetic device 
because of injuries he suffered during one journey. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an ongoing problem. It's barbaric and it needs to be stopped," she said. 
"The state of California is finally liable for all these injuries." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Cantrell, who claims that she was raped while being transported from 
California to Missouri in 1986, said she was the only woman on a van with eight 
other male prisoners. The company was also under contract with Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
Rest stops were so infrequent, she said, that the male prisoners were finally 
given paper cups to urinate in during the trip. "But what was a female to do?" 
she asked. "That's why I have kidney problems to this day." 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of the trip, she said the male prisoners were deposited at a local 
jail in Kansas while she was driven on to Missouri. Less than 20 minutes after 
the other prisoners were dropped off, she said, her guards stopped the van and 
raped her on the side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Moore, extradition chief for the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office, said several prisoners who were interviewed by her office told of 
having to spend sometimes as long as a month on the road without a single 
change of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that the contractor has to make a profit. The more 
prisoners the contractor can take the more money he can make," she said. Robert 
Rath, general manager for the company, acknowledged that in the first year of 
its contract with the state his firm sometimes took weeks to deliver prisoners 
to their destination. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, however, he said the company had streamlined its operations 
and now takes an average of only four days to transport prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything that you can run into on an airplane you can run into in our 
business," he said. "You have weather and you have mechanical problems." 
</P>
<P>
Rath refused to comment on Cantrell's charges, saying they are the subject of a 
lawsuit.

PROP. 103 CONSUMER GROUP COSTS TO BE PAID; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE: IMPLEMENTATION HEARINGS GET UNDER WAY WITH ATTENDANCE WEIGHTED 
HEAVILY IN FAVOR OF THE INDUSTRY.

<P>
Proposition 103 implementation hearings that are expected to last at least two 
months got under way here Monday with a decision that consumer representatives 
will be compensated for their participation. 
</P>
<P>
The chief hearing officer for the state Department of Insurance, retired Santa 
Clara County Superior Court Judge William J. Fernandez, said that any consumer 
group that makes a substantial contribution to the proceedings could submit its 
legal fees and expenses each 30 days and will be reimbursed if deemed 
reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez added that witnesses used by consumer groups to testify on the issues 
at the hearings will also have their expenses paid after their appearances. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Insurance Department will advance the necessary funds. But 
eventually the department will pass the costs on to insurance companies that do 
business in California, Fernandez said. According to the law, the companies pay 
the Insurance Department's budget. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie said she had been consulted in the 
hearing officer's decision and that she fully approved of the payments as a 
means of assuring that consumer groups at the drawn-out and complicated 
hearings will be represented to the same degree as the insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Snyder, West Coast director of the Consumers Union, called the 
compensation order "a very auspicious beginning to the hearings. It will 
guarantee fairness," he said. "Now it's up to us to adequately represent the 
consumers, to be sure they are given what they voted for when they passed 
Proposition 103." 
</P>
<P>
As the hearings began on such key Proposition 103 implementation issues as rate 
rollbacks, what constitutes a fair return for the companies and new methods of 
pricing auto insurance on other than a neighborhood basis, industry 
representatives vastly outnumbered consumer delegates in the hearing. The ratio 
appeared to be about 10 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
But representatives of such groups as the Consumers Union, Voter Revolt, Public 
Advocates Inc. and the Latino Issues Forum managed to speak almost as often as 
all the company lawyers combined. Robert Gnaiza of Public Advocates estimated 
that the industry lawyers in the room were billing their companies a combined 
total of $500,000 a day in fees, which are passed on to policy holders. He said 
the consumer representative billings will be only a fraction of that. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Alexander, speaking for State Farm Insurance Co., replied that the 
$500,000 figure for the industry attorneys was an exaggeration. But he made no 
estimate of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the first day of the hearings was taken up by pleas by industry lawyers 
for special treatment for their clients. 
</P>
<P>
Several lawyers insisted that the companies they represented should be exempted 
from the regulations developed by these hearings altogether and be treated 
individually later. But the hearing officer said this would not be done and 
that all companies doing business in California are subject to the hearings.

INITIATIVE WOULD LEGALIZE BETTING ON FOOTBALL GAMES; 
</P>
<P>
GAMBLING: THE PROPOSED BALLOT MEASURE WOULD RAISE UP TO $100 MILLION A YEAR, 
ASSEMBLYMAN FLOYD SAYS.

A legalized sports betting initiative proposal for next year's November 
election ballot was filed on Monday by a Southern California assemblyman, who 
said it could raise up to $100 million a year in new revenues for senior 
citizen programs, law enforcement and fire protection services. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, right across three of California's four borders -- in Nevada, at 
Tijuana, and now in Oregon -- legal football betting is taking place," said 
Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson), who says he likes to gamble on 
football games but dislikes having to leave the state to do so. "We are 
exporting literally millions of California dollars that ought to be spent 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Floyd's office reported $1.2 billion was wagered on professional and college 
football games in Nevada sports rooms in 1987. Oregon initiated lottery-style 
professional football card betting in September and took in $221,244 during the 
first week. 
</P>
<P>
The National Football League is against the proposed legalized sports betting 
initiative. California Lottery officials said they have no position on it at 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
"The NFL is unalterably opposed to any type of gambling on NFL games," said Jim 
Heffernan, the league's public relations director. 
</P>
<P>
"No comment," said Joanne McNabb, communications director for the lottery, 
which probably would lose some business if the initiative is qualified and 
approved by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials estimate that between $7 billion and $10 billion is 
illegally wagered on sporting events in California each year. 
</P>
<P>
"Legalized, licensed sports betting would not only cut significantly into the 
revenues of the underworld," Floyd said, "but obviously add millions of dollars 
to our public treasuries." 
</P>
<P>
The sponsor of the initiative, filed with the attorney general's office in the 
first step of the process, will need to obtain the valid signatures of 595,485 
registered voters on petitions in order to qualify it for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd noted that voters approved the state lottery the first time it qualified 
for the ballot after the idea had been blocked in the Legislature for many 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Poll results show a close relationship between popular support for the lottery 
and for sports betting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed initiative, legalized sports betting on all professional and 
college sporting events could take place at horse racing tracks and, subject to 
local approval, in licensed clubs. Betting on community college and high school 
sports would be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
A new state gaming commission would have jurisdiction over the sports betting 
system. Each betting facility would set its own wagering parameters and house 
rules. Athletes and managers who bet on their own sport would be subject to 
felony prosecution and up to three years in state prison upon conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd estimated that the state could receive up to $50 million a year from 
taxes on legal wagers for senior citizen programs, and local government could 
obtain another $50 million from tax revenues to help finance police, fire and 
other services. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the $210.8 billion reaped annually by legalized gambling on a 
nationwide basis makes it the "hottest growth industry" in the U.S. economy of 
the 1980s. "I want California to share in that growth in the 1990s," Floyd 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the state lottery, he said, the initiative would not put the state 
directly into the business of conducting gambling because it would only license 
private operators. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd also dismissed the idea that the initiative could increase compulsive 
gambling. "You don't close supermarkets to combat overeating," he said. "The 
first step in helping compulsive bettors is to remove the stigma of 
criminality."

ON CALIFORNIA: THE REWARDS OF SLOW-MOTION LOCOMOTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ROBERT A. JONES

<TEXT>
<P>
Something is happening with the passenger train in California. It's not a boom, 
exactly, and it's nothing that poses a threat to the airlines or even the bus 
lines. But somehow, the passenger train has made a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
You look at recent Amtrak numbers for California and you'd think this was the 
Eastern Seaboard. In the past several years, the train from San Diego to Los 
Angeles has become one of the highest revenue producers in the nation, and the 
Coast Starlight connecting Los Angeles to to San Francisco runs full trains 
week after week. 
</P>
<P>
This performance is all the more surprising because these trains still proceed 
at their infamous, 19th-Century pace. When I stood in the post-dawn of the 
Oakland station, waiting for the Starlight with about 150 others, we all knew 
the trip to L.A. would take 11 hours. Even the bus was faster, yet there we 
were. 
</P>
<P>
That crowd forms every day at the Oakland station, and another just like it at 
Union Station in Los Angeles for the trip north. In the summer you'd better 
make your reservation many days in advance or you won't get on. It leaves you 
to wonder how large the market for rail travel would be if Amtrak could whip 
around the state at the speeds of West European or Japanese trains. 
</P>
<P>
I decided to take the Starlight because someone mentioned to me that California 
is a nearly ideal piece of geography for train travel, if only the service 
could be improved. Its two major population centers, Los Angeles and the Bay 
Area, are separated by 450 miles, a perfect distance for the modern, high-speed 
train. 
</P>
<P>
By my calculations, for example, the French T.G.V. Atlantique train, now the 
world's fastest at 186 m.p.h., could make the trip from Los Angeles to San 
Francisco in about three hours. That's an elapsed time that comes close to 
competing with the airlines, if you factor in the laborious trip to and from 
the airport. 
</P>
<P>
The future market for that kind of fast train in California, delivering its 
passengers from downtown to downtown, is nearly incalculable. Just keep in mind 
that the air corridor over the same route is the busiest in the world and one 
of the richest. 
</P>
<P>
What we are currently stuck with, of course, is something very different. The 
Coast Starlight trundles down the track at an average speed of 40 m.p.h. or 
thereabouts. When it pulls up the hill at Cuesta Pass just north of San Luis 
Obispo, figure 20 m.p.h. The Starlight does not pretend to speed. It travels 
with all the deliberate dignity of a land-bound zeppelin. 
</P>
<P>
But there's an irony here. After a few hours you begin to realize that the slow 
pace of the Starlight may also offer some rewards. And it may explain why these 
trains are crowded. Is there anything so terrible about having 11 hours with 
nothing to do but gaze out a picture window as California glides past? 
</P>
<P>
And in this case, the California you see is not what you expect. The Starlight 
takes you to a central coast where 40 years seem to have fallen away. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving San Francisco Bay, the train cuts its own route down the coast, 
following a path that is usually far from the interstates. 
</P>
<P>
The landscape becomes remarkable for what's not there: no cloverleaves or 
clusters of Arby's and Chevrons. The usual paraphernalia of intrastate travel 
has disappeared and in its place you discover a pastoral California. The train 
glides through great ranches where roads are still dirt and where ranch hands 
wave when you pass. Past stretches of beach with no "access," no park rangers, 
no crowds, nothing. 
</P>
<P>
And because there are few of them, the people in the landscape become 
interesting. In the Salinas Valley we passed an occasional pumpkin field where 
fathers had brought their daughters to poke through the selection, looking for 
the best jack-o'-lantern candidates. I saw one father pick up a huge pumpkin 
and the little girl next to him made a quick hop and clapped. 
</P>
<P>
Much of this view of California is a lie, of course. At San Luis Obispo, for 
example, the Starlight stops at a small, lovely station with the air of the 
1930s. You would never know -- from the perspective of the train -- that San 
Luis Obispo is caught in the midst of a great boom, that the hills all around 
the city are being carved into new civilizations. 
</P>
<P>
But, for 11 hours, what a nice lie. It almost leaves you hoping those 
180-m.p.h. trains never make it to California.

PALESTINIAN GETS 16 LIFE TERMS IN ISRAELI BUS DEATHS

A 23-year-old Palestinian was sentenced Monday to 16 life terms in prison for 
killing 16 people, including an American and two Canadians, when he forced a 
crowded passenger bus off the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway. 
</P>
<P>
The attack July 6 was the bloodiest in the 22-month-old Palestinian uprising in 
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the sentence imposed on Abdel Hadi 
Ghanem was one of the stiffest in Israel's history. 
</P>
<P>
Ghanem, 23, was sentenced to life in prison for each of the deaths in the bus 
attack. He also received 20 years for each of the 24 passengers wounded in the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
The sentences are to be served concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Prosecutor Uzi Hasson said there is no parole for murder sentences and 
that Ghanem could only be freed if the Israeli president intervened on his 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
The victims of the bus attack included the only American to die in the 
uprising, lawyer Rita Levine, 39, of Philadelphia. Two other victims were 
Canadians, Fern Rykiss, 17, of Winnipeg, and Shelley Halpenny, 32, of 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
Ghanem, who was injured in the incident, said he carried out the attack to 
avenge a friend paralyzed by soldiers in a clash near his home in the Gaza 
Strip's Nusseirat refugee camp. 
</P>
<P>
The attack by Ghanem prompted several days of revenge attacks by Jews on Arabs 
in Jerusalem and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, newspapers said the army will soon begin using observation 
balloons equipped with cameras to keep track of protests and disturbances 
related to the uprising.

DIPLOMACY: HOLDING TALKS BEFORE THE YEAR'S END COULD BENEFIT BOTH OF THE 
SUPERPOWER LEADERS. BUT IT'S FAR FROM A DONE DEAL.

<P>
In a reflection of the sudden acceleration of the evolving U.S.-Soviet 
relationship, senior White House aides are discussing the prospect of a meeting 
before Christmas between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, an Administration official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials demonstrated extreme sensitivity about public discussion 
of such a meeting before it has been set. They refused to comment about whether 
the Soviets have been involved in discussions of a pre-Christmas meeting. 
</P>
<P>
But one Administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said 
White House assistants are reviewing the merits of such a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. 
Dubinin on Monday, ostensibly to discuss Central America. It was not disclosed 
if the discussion also dealt with a December meeting. 
</P>
<P>
If the two leaders do meet in December, it would represent a dramatically 
speeded up pace in superpower summitry. The Administration official said, 
however, that such a meeting would not throw off a timetable set in September. 
That was when Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze 
announced in Jackson Hole, Wyo., that Bush and Gorbachev would meet sometime in 
the late spring or early summer in a summit conference. 
</P>
<P>
With that timetable in mind, the official said, "if they were to get together 
prior to the spring, we wouldn't call it a summit. We'd call it a meeting." 
</P>
<P>
In the White House view, such a meeting would offer considerable benefits to 
both sides. 
</P>
<P>
For Bush, it would offer a highly visible demonstration that he is ready to 
move ahead on a central element of U.S. foreign policy -- relations with the 
Soviet Union. Bush began his Administration with a lengthy review that brought 
criticism that he was too cautious in his approach to Soviet changes. 
</P>
<P>
For the Soviet leader -- struggling with demands for greater economic and 
political progress stemming from the tides of reform that he unleashed -- the 
meeting could provide a platform for demonstrating to skeptical audiences back 
home the Soviets' improved international standing. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has, in recent weeks, found itself in the midst of an 
increasingly public dispute over how it should respond to the evolving 
political reforms in the Soviet Union and the shifts that they have brought in 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, have pursued a 
publicly cautious approach: encouraging the changes and voicing U.S. support 
for them but also expressing little more than hope that they will succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Baker has been more publicly upbeat, using the uncertainty of the situation in 
the Soviet Union to justify greater efforts to improve U.S.-Soviet relations.

Soviet lawmakers grappling for the first time with a government budget 
suggested on Monday that the vast fleet of official luxury cars be auctioned to 
help cut the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet (Parliament) also proposed hefty taxes on cigarettes and 
beer to try to pare an estimated $143 billion budget deficit down to $95 
billion, at the official rate of exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Selling off the official automobiles would raise $398 million, while a 30% tax 
on tobacco and a 20% tax on beer would provide $3.7 billion in revenue, 
according to Finance Minister Valentin S. Pavlov.

Helmeted riot police wielding truncheons repeatedly charged and clubbed 
demonstrators Monday night after a candlelight vigil outside the headquarters 
of the KGB security service in memory of Stalin's victims. Scores of protesters 
were knocked to the ground, beaten and dragged into police buses. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 people were detained, the Tass news agency said, in what was the 
harshest crackdown on protesters in Moscow in more than 18 months. Tass said 
the protesters were "trying to create as much disruption as possible, to 
display anti-Soviet posters and shout anti-Soviet slogans." 
</P>
<P>
The clashes took place on some of central Moscow's busiest streets and were 
especially jarring because of the more permissive political climate instituted 
under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's wide-ranging reforms. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 Soviets converged on KGB headquarters at Dzerzhinsky Square after 
dusk to mark the unofficial "Day of the Political Prisoner" and mourn the 
millions who were wrongly imprisoned or killed under Josef Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
The hourlong protest, in which two rows of people holding flickering candles 
lined up on three sides of the building, proceeded peacefully. It had been 
organized by the Memorial Society, which seeks to commemorate those who 
suffered unjustly under Stalin, and the Democratic Union, a self-styled 
opposition to the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the demonstration, a splinter group of about 500 people, mostly 
young men, marched off in the direction of Pushkin Square, a favorite rallying 
site for human rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters chanted "Shame on the KGB!" and "The KGB is the enemy of the 
people!" They were confronted without warning by riot police two blocks from 
Pushkin Square as they passed out leaflets to homebound commuters. 
</P>
<P>
It was the roughest treatment of an unsanctioned demonstration in Moscow since 
December, 1987, when about 200 burly men in civilian clothes roughed up a group 
of Jews who staged a protest demanding the right to emigrate.

SUIT CLAIMS EPA FAILS TO ENFORCE CLEAN WATER ACT

Two leading watchdog groups filed suit in federal court Monday, charging that 
the Environmental Protection Agency allows more than a billion pounds of toxic 
contaminants to pollute the nation's waterways and sewage treatment facilities 
annually by failing to enforce the Clean Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the EPA provides strict controls over 24 major industries and 126 
toxic pollutants. In the suit, the National Resources Defense Council and 
Public Citizen contend that at least a dozen industries and hundreds of 
pollutants escape scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
"There are gaping loopholes in the EPA's regulatory scheme," said Eric 
Glitzenstein, an attorney for Public Citizen. "The list of 126 priority 
pollutants was never intended to be exclusive. Thus, many of the rules do not 
control the full range of dangerous pollutants."

EPA statistics from 1987 -- the most recently compiled -- show that California 
ranks second among states in releasing toxic contaminants into sewage plants 
and fifth in emissions into rivers, lakes and coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
An EPA spokeswoman said that the agency is complying with the Clean Water Act 
and has reduced the release of toxics by about 800 million pounds every year.

S.F. DISASTER JOLTS OFFICIALS IN MEMPHIS INTO PREPARING FOR THEIR OWN BIG ONE; 
</P>
<P>
EARTHQUAKES: EXPERTS WARN THAT A MAJOR TEMBLOR IS ON THE WAY. BUT A FIGHT LOOMS 
OVER NEW BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS.

If The King ever does show up back here in his hometown, he'd better be 
careful. Graceland hasn't been earthquake-proofed. 
</P>
<P>
But Elvis Presley's old mansion -- the biggest tourist attraction in this city 
along the Mississippi River -- is hardly alone. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing else in Memphis is ready for the Big One either, even though this city 
lies close to the site of the most powerful earthquake in American history and 
sits almost directly atop one of the biggest earthquake fault lines in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Memphis -- like most cities in the central United States -- has no building 
code requirements to guard against earthquakes. Developers in Memphis have been 
successfully fighting such "seismic" building code requirements for years, 
arguing that they would add huge costs to new construction while protecting 
against a threat of which most here are only dimly aware. 
</P>
<P>
Only now, in the wake of the World Series quake in San Francisco, has the 
seismic code issue been revived. After inspecting the damage to the Bay Area, 
Memphis Mayor Richard Hackett returned home and announced he would push a 
long-delayed seismic code into law by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be a tough one to sell, it won't be politically popular," Hackett 
spokesman Ray Pohlman admitted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's never been a hot issue before. But the San Francisco quake is forcing it 
to be a big issue now." 
</P>
<P>
The new code may come just in time, earthquake experts here say. 
</P>
<P>
A serious earthquake in Memphis is on the way -- and soon -- seismologists 
warn. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Memphis is at greater risk of suffering a major earthquake sometime in 
the next few years than any other urban area in the eastern half of the United 
States. There is a 40% to 63% probability that a quake of at least 6.0 
magnitude will hit Memphis within the next 15 years, according to Arch 
Johnston, director of the Center for Earthquake Research at Memphis State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, today, the city is almost completely unprepared for it. "Our risk to 
people and buildings from an earthquake is high . . . because we've taken 
virtually no precautions here," Johnston warned. He added that most public 
schools in the city are built of "old, unreinforced masonry, which engineers 
will tell you is the worst possible construction in the event of an earthquake. 
If we had a quake during the school day, many of our casualties would be 
children." 
</P>
<P>
The complacency about earthquakes in Memphis reflects a broader sense among 
most Americans that only Californians need worry about quakes. But, although 
California rightly grabs the headlines as America's earthquake capital, other 
regions of the nation are hardly immune. 
</P>
<P>
"If you asked people in Memphis where earthquakes occur, they would say 
California," noted Harvey Ryland, executive director of the Memphis-based 
Central States Earthquake Consortium, which was formed in 1983 to increase 
awareness among builders and residents in seven central states of the threat 
from earthquakes. "Most of them don't know (earthquakes) can happen right here 
in their own back yards." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the most powerful earthquakes ever to hit the continental United States 
happened here in the Mississippi River Valley, along what seismologists have 
dubbed the New Madrid Fault. 
</P>
<P>
Three quakes, with an epicenter near the small farming town of New Madrid, Mo., 
about 70 miles north of Memphis on the Mississippi River, hit in rapid 
succession during the winter of 1811-1812 with more fury than the 1906 quake 
that devastated San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The quakes -- estimated to have been between 8.6 and 8.9 magnitude -- packed 
such force that they briefly reversed the course of the Mississippi, created a 
major new lake that still exists, rang church bells in Boston and knocked down 
construction scaffolding around the Capitol in Washington. The tremors could be 
felt over 1 million square miles. 
</P>
<P>
"All nature seemed running into chaos," recalled one Frenchmen who was 
traveling down the Mississippi when the first earthquake hit in December, 1811. 
Throughout the winter in New Madrid, the ground shook incessantly, "like the 
flesh of a beef just killed," wrote one resident. 
</P>
<P>
But the area was so sparsely populated then that only a few people were killed 
-- mostly passengers on small boats swallowed up by the raging river -- and the 
region hasn't been hit by a comparable quake since. 
</P>
<P>
So, although less severe quakes, at 5.0 or below, occur regularly -- about 200 
barely detectable quakes hit along the New Madrid Fault each year -- few people 
in the Memphis area take the threat of a major quake seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no memory of a big quake here, that's the problem," said Jeff 
Crenshaw, director of the Memphis-Shelby County Emergency Management Agency. 
"Our problem is that we don't have them often enough for people to know what to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, a quake in Memphis like the one that recently hit the Bay Area 
could lead to a greater loss of life, because people don't know what to do and 
buildings haven't been reinforced. In addition, the damage here would extend 
over a larger region, because of the Mississippi River Valley's soft soil, 
which transmits seismic energy more easily than does the thick rock just below 
the surface in California. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco quake has led political leaders here to start taking 
earthquake warnings seriously. Earlier this week, Rep. Harold E. Ford (D-Tenn.) 
wrote a letter to Mayor Hackett calling for a halt in the construction of the 
"Great American Pyramid," Memphis' huge new pyramid-shaped sports complex, 
until it can be earthquake-proofed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tragic, but the San Francisco quake has done more to make people aware of 
the threat than anything else," Crenshaw observed. "Now, I'm getting calls from 
the City Council members saying they want to support us" in earthquake 
preparations.

A U.S. warplane accidentally dropped a 500-pound bomb Monday on the Navy 
guided-missile cruiser Reeves during maneuvers in the Indian Ocean, slightly 
injuring five sailors and leaving a 5-foot hole in the ship's main deck, the 
Navy said. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb, which detonated on impact, set off a small fire that was quickly 
extinguished, Lt. Bruce Cole, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon, said. 
</P>
<P>
Cole said the injuries occurred "as a result of flying glass and concussion" 
from the exploding bomb. The sailors were treated on board the Reeves, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb, described as about 4 feet long and 14 inches in diameter, did no 
damage to the outer hull, Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft, a single-seat F/A-18 Hornet, had been dispatched from the carrier 
Midway. It returned to the carrier, where the pilot was debriefed by Navy 
officials, Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
Cole said that the pilot "inadvertently" dropped the bomb during "routine 
weapons training." 
</P>
<P>
The cruiser was about 32 miles from Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The Midway and the Reeves are permanently based in Yokosuka, Japan.

PILOT FLEW 'LOW AND SLOW' BEFORE CRASH ON CARRIER

A Navy pilot making his first landing attempt on an aircraft carrier was "low 
and slow" before his training jet crashed on the Lexington, killing him and 
four others, the ship's captain said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The T-2 Buckeye slammed into the ship's island, cartwheeled across the deck and 
exploded in flames Sunday afternoon, Capt. C. Flack Logan said. Nineteen other 
people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, Ens. Steven E. Pontell, 23, of Columbia, Md., was the only one 
aboard the two-seat trainer. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy identified the other dead as Petty Officer 3rd Class Burnett Kilgore 
Jr., 19, of Holly Springs, Miss.; Petty Officer 3rd Class Timmy L. Garroutte, 
30, of Memphis, Tenn.; and Airman Lisa L. Mayo, 25, of Oklahoma City, all 
Lexington crew members; and Byron Gervis Courvelle, 32, of Meridian, Miss., a 
civilian employee of DynCorp, which has a contract to maintain Navy aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The dead other than the pilot were all on the flight deck, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Their names were not released until after next of kin had been notified, and, 
as the World War II-vintage carrier, the oldest in the Navy, returned to its 
dock late Monday morning, several sailors' wives burst into tears and waved 
wildly as they spotted their husbands on the deck -- the first confirmation 
that their loved ones were safe. 
</P>
<P>
Kayleen Edwards said after finding her husband: "They said they had hit where 
he works, and they couldn't identify some of the bodies." 
</P>
<P>
Airplanes normally land on the Lexington's 910-foot blacktop flight deck at 
about 110 to 120 knots, or up to 138 m.p.h., Cmdr. Denny Major, the ship's air 
officer, said. They stop by catching their tail hooks on cables stretched 
across the 192-foot-wide deck. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Cmdr. Jack Ross estimated that Pontell was traveling between 90 and 100 
m.p.h.

DRUNK-DRIVER MURDER CONVICTION UPSET; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: THE APPEALS COURT DECISION DRAWS SHARP CRITICISM FROM THE MAN WHOSE 
WIFE AND THREE CHILDREN DIED IN THE COLLISION. 
</P>

<P>
A state appellate court Monday reversed the murder conviction of a drunk driver 
whose car struck another, killing a Fullerton mother and her three children in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
The 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana said it has ordered that the jury 
conviction of Michael W. Reding, now 31, automatically be reduced to vehicular 
manslaughter unless the Orange County district attorney's office decides within 
30 days to retry him for murder. In a unanimous opinion, the justices said 
jurors should never have heard about Reding's possible cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
"The prejudicial effect of drug use on a jury cannot be overestimated in 
today's war-on-drugs climate," Justice Thomas F. Crosby Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision drew strong criticism from Robert F. Trueblood, whose wife and 
three children died. 
</P>
<P>
"I obviously feel the appellate court has made a tremendous mistake," he said. 
"The . . . court is not really interested in justice being served. They are 
just dealing with legal technicalities in court. . . . 
</P>
<P>
" . . . I've followed the matter from Day 1. I've been to court every day. I 
have witnessed the whole thing. The matter should be appealed to the state 
Supreme Court or retried. The D.A. should make sure that justice is done." 
</P>
<P>
"My inclination right now is to think we will retry him for murder," said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas M. Goethals, who is in charge of the writs and 
appeals section. "But it's premature to say just what we will do." 
</P>
<P>
Reding was sentenced to 15 years to life in 1986 after he became the first 
drunk driver in Orange County to be convicted of second-degree murder in a 
vehicle collision. The trial became a focal point for groups seeking tougher 
jail terms for drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Reding admitted that he had been drinking on the night of the Oct. 23, 1984, 
head-on collision on State College Boulevard, near Bastanchury Road, in 
Fullerton. The collision killed the other driver, Pamela Trueblood, 36, and her 
children, Eric, 11; Kerry, 9, and Scott, 8. Two other children in the Trueblood 
car were seriously injured but survived. 
</P>
<P>
Reding testified that he had just changed a tape on his car stereo when he 
looked up and saw the approaching car. Witnesses said Reding was driving at 
more than 70 m.p.h. in a 45 m.p.h. zone when his car struck the Trueblood car. 
</P>
<P>
Reding's lawyers did not deny that their client was drunk. But a hotly disputed 
issue was whether he had also used cocaine the day of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Mike Jacobs, who has since left the district attorney's office, 
agreed before the trial not to raise the cocaine issue unless the defense did 
something to make it necessary in rebuttal. 
</P>
<P>
But Jacobs brought it up when cross-examining Reding, claiming that it was a 
legitimate issue for impeaching Reding's testimony that he was able to drive 
safely. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge James L. Smith agreed to allow the evidence for a limited 
purpose: to determine if cocaine might have led to Reding's sketchy memory of 
the crash. 
</P>
<P>
On rebuttal, Smith allowed Jacobs to call a drug expert to the stand who 
implied that chemicals found in Reding's system showed that he had probably 
taken cocaine the day of the crash. Reding denied it. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in closing arguments, Jacobs made the possible cocaine use a key issue -- 
not only telling jurors that the cocaine made Reding more dangerous but 
speculating that Reding was probably on his way to buy more at the time of the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
"The prosecutor effectively sank the defendant in a sea of white powder," 
Justice Crosby stated. 
</P>
<P>
While Crosby called Jacobs overzealous, he also attacked defense attorney Heidi 
Mueller for not raising more objections than she did over the cocaine issue. 
</P>
<P>
Reding, an engineer at Northrop Corp., said in interviews before his conviction 
that he thought he should be punished for what he had done but that he thought 
murder was too steep a charge. 
</P>
<P>
Goethals said a resentencing on four counts of vehicular manslaughter ordered 
by the appellate court could amount to a term of as much as 15 years. But the 
difference is, it would be a specific sentence, instead of the broader 15 years 
to life that a murder conviction carries, he said.

GLOOM LIFTS AS OAKLAND CELEBRATES SERIES WIN

Thousands of Oakland A's fans thronged Jack London Square for a noon rally 
Monday that was supposed to have been a subdued affair saluting the World 
Series champions but at the same time recalling the Oct. 17 earthquake and its 
grim toll in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
However, as if the city were saying it was time for celebrating victory and 
down with gloom, the moment quickly gave way to unrestrained jubilation for the 
team's four-game sweep of the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great day for Oakland and the East Bay," shouted Oakland Mayor 
Lionel Wilson before an estimated crowd of 8,000 fans, most wearing or waving 
the green and gold of the Oakland Athletics. Some waved brooms in the air to 
signify the A's series sweep, while others taped the celebration with video 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the enthusiasm of the stirred-up fans and officials that a planned 
moment of silence in remembrance of the suffering caused by the earthquake was 
overlooked and never took place. 
</P>
<P>
The rally was not wholly oblivious to the recent quake, which claimed 39 lives 
in Oakland when a section of the Nimitz Freeway collapsed. Five buckets were 
passed around to collect money to aid the families of victims. There was no 
traditional ticker-tape parade for the team through downtown streets. 
</P>
<P>
But clearly the champion team had center stage. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very proud of our team, our city and what our region has represented," 
said Oakland A's Vice President Sandy Alderson from a raised platform, with the 
Oakland waterfront in the background. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the players. Pitcher Dave Stewart, selected the World Series Most 
Valuable Player, drew thunderous applause and a standing ovation from his 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"From the bottom of my heart," Stewart said, "to me, Oakland and the A's have a 
lot in common, and that is: The cream of the crop always rises to the top." The 
cheering level increased as Stewart held up the World Series championship 
trophy. "This belongs to all of us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Teammates drew similar responses. "This is extra special because I'm from 
Fremont (in the East Bay)," said relief pitcher Dennis Eckersley, who made the 
final out in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
The Most Valuable Player in the playoffs, Ricky Henderson, called winning the 
World Series the "greatest moment in my career." 
</P>
<P>
Although there was no parade, downtown Oakland was decorated with A's banners, 
while green and yellow shuttle buses provided free rides to the rally. 
</P>
<P>
Business was good for the numerous vendors who lined Broadway, peddling such 
wares as World Series shirts, pennants, caps and buttons. Some offered "The 
Great Quake" T-shirts to passers-by heading for the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"This rally and the World Series really uplifted the citizens to get their 
minds off the earthquake and to have something else to think about besides the 
damage," said Penny Jenson, 30, of San Leandro. Jenson, dressed in an A's 
jogging suit, is a season ticket holder who went to both the playoffs and the 
World Series. "It really raised our spirits." 
</P>
<P>
Jorgen Christiansen, 71, has lived in Oakland since 1922 and saw the first 
baseball game ever played in Oakland Coliseum in 1968. He was impressed with 
his team's showing on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
"They showed a lot of spirit despite everything that has happened," 
Christiansen said, wearing an A's jacket and cap. "They've done a lot to help 
us all get our lives back to normal as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
"Oakland has always been regarded as the second city in the Bay Area, second to 
San Francisco," said Joe Rodriguez, 30, a student at UC Berkeley who skipped 
classes to attend the rally.

Ronald Reagan would be in for a surprise if he were to flip through a copy of 
the Evening Fuji, a newspaper published by Fujisankei Communications Group, the 
media conglomerate that paid him a controversial $2 million for a nine-day tour 
of Japan that ended Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Photographs of naked women, cartoon drawings of sexual violence and columns of 
not-so-soft pornography are standard fare on the inside pages of the Fuji, a 
typical Japanese tabloid heavy with sports news. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for some reason, Reagan overlooked the prurient side of Japan's aesthetic 
traditions last week when he said he hoped "outsiders" like the Japanese might 
help restore "decency and good taste" to America's film industry. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan made the remarks while defending Sony's $3.4-billion takeover of 
Columbia Pictures in an interview on Fuji Television -- a channel that, it 
should be noted, has frequently featured pornographic video clips on its 
all-night variety show. 
</P>
<P>
It might also be noted that Reagan's office was then reportedly in the midst of 
negotiations with Sony for a six-figure donation to the Reagan Library. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the former President appeared sincere when he said he didn't see anything 
wrong with the Sony-Columbia deal -- especially since America itself invests so 
heavily abroad. It terms of artistic integrity, things could only get better, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that probably we might see some improvements, " he said. "I'm not too 
proud of Hollywood these days, with the immorality that is shown in pictures, 
and the vulgarity." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a lot of Japanese aren't too proud when they see what's playing in 
Tokyo's movie theaters these days. "Climax, Rape, Strip!" is but one locally 
produced example of a strong impulse for the purple cinema. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't end with a little soft porn. Japan has a peculiar law on the books 
that strictly forbids the graphic display of pubic hair, but that has not 
stopped a flood of violence and sado-masochism from bubbling out of the 
Japanese film and publishing industries. 
</P>
<P>
Always devising ways to beat the censors, Japanese have pioneered cartoon 
pornography, both in adult comic books and in erotic animated videos. Breasts 
are routinely bared on television, not just on the Fuji channel. A pornographic 
sub-industry has grown up around the male fetish for the schoolgirl's sailor 
suit. The latest genre of smut? It's called "Ladies' Comics," aimed at 
frustrated women. 
</P>
<P>
Few film industries in the world rival Japan's when it comes to producing 
trash, the experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"If Reagan knew anything about Japanese film, its current violence and 
vulgarity, he would not have hoped for better movies" under the influence of 
Sony's capital, said Donald Richie, a Tokyo arts writer and authority on 
Japan's cinema. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's rosy view of Japan was matched by that of his wife, Nancy, who 
inaugurated the local chapter of her "Just Say No" anti-drug program, saying 
she hopes the Japanese will be vigilant against drug abuse so it doesn't catch 
on here. 
</P>
<P>
"People often tell me that drugs aren't a problem here because of the strength 
of the Japanese family and the stability of Japanese traditions and culture," 
she said in a speech. "I'm also told that heroin and cocaine are not problems 
here because the yakuza, your organized crime, has not become involved in such 
drugs so far." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently no one bothered to tell Mrs. Reagan that Japan already has a serious 
drug problem. Although heroin and crack cocaine have yet to catch on here, the 
country is suffering from an epidemic of crystal methamphetamine addiction, 
thanks to the yakuza. Estimates of the number of Japanese who are injecting the 
deadly stimulant range from 100,000 to half a million. Police arrest some 
20,000 abusers each year. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Reagan is absolutely right, we need to be on guard against cocaine and 
heroin," said Fumio Oki, a counselor working with recovering methamphetamine 
addicts at a Tokyo halfway house. "But we also have a serious problem right now 
with methamphetamine, and we'd like people to pay a little more attention to 
what's going on in the street." 
</P>
<P>
If the Reagans preferred to embrace the myth of a pristine Japan, so too did 
their hosts see in the Reagan presidency the fantasy of a happier and simpler 
era, when America stood staunchly behind the cause of free trade and played 
down economic friction in bilateral relations. 
</P>
<P>
For his defense of free trade -- and Japan's economic lifeline -- Reagan was 
awarded a Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum by Emperor 
Akihito. During a week of pomp, ceremony and no small amount of hokum, the 
retired President was lionized in speeches as a cornerstone in U.S.-Japan 
friendship and as the "architect" of global economic prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
Yet cross-Pacific ties are somewhat more complex these days, with Japan's 
bilateral trade surplus hovering stubbornly above the $50-billion mark -- more 
than four times what it was when Reagan became President in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Reagan warned, in his farewell speech in Osaka Saturday, about 
increasing impatience in the United States over Japanese trade practices. But 
he also rejected the notion that America is a "declining superpower" that is 
"lazy, soft, and simply living off past glory." 
</P>
<P>
"America's blood, bones and muscle are healthy and strong," Reagan said. "We 
get new energy every year from the waves of immigrants who seek to make their 
lives and fortunes in our country. . . . Try convincing them that America's 
best days are behind her." 
</P>
<P>
The strong-America message jibes harmoniously with the views of Reagan's 
commercial hosts at Fujisankei, which is known for its conservative and 
nationalistic editorial slant. Fujisankei officials have said they hoped 
Reagan's visit would help defuse some of the acrimony developing in U.S.-Japan 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking back, we Japanese have never met an American with this much warmth, 
kindness, depth of heart and insight," said an editorial Sunday in the Sankei 
newspaper, the conglomerate's flagship publication. "There aren't many people 
who embody the essence of America they way Mr. Reagan does." 
</P>
<P>
The editorial went on to praise the "American archetype" of innocence that 
Reagan represents.

STAR PERFORMERS AT FISCHER TRIBUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Clare Fischer must have been deeply touched by the outpouring of support and 
affection for him from the Los Angeles music community at a tribute concert at 
the Wadsworth Theatre in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
It was a benefit to help cover the pianist's recent extraordinary medical 
expenses, and a long line of performers turned out. Much of the music reflected 
Fischer's continuing interest in Latin rhythms. Its quality, despite the good 
intentions, varied from group to group. 
</P>
<P>
Secret 9 -- actually a quartet -- opened the Thursday evening concert with a 
set that virtually bristled with electronic energy. But the ensemble's flashy 
note flurries and high-speed tempos were rarely matched by an equivalent amount 
of musical warmth. 
</P>
<P>
The group was followed by the appealing pop jazz of Syndicado Brasil, sporting 
two lead singers and a colorful collection of samba rhythms. Rudy Regaldo's 
15-piece ensemble, Chevere, was even better. The ensemble's sizzling Afro-Cuban 
rhythms, soaring vocals and powerful ensemble work provided both the musical 
and the emotional high points of the the first half of the program, which 
concluded with a solo-oriented set from an ensemble featuring guitarist Rick 
Zunigar, bassist Jeff Berlin, drummer Alex Acuna and percussionist Luis Conte. 
</P>
<P>
Chick Corea's unannounced appearance with his acoustic trio (Dave Weckl on 
drums and John Patitucci on bass) was the musical meat and potatoes of the 
program. A brief excursion through "How Deep Is The Ocean?" underlined how 
effectively Corea has managed to blend the rich harmonies of mainstream jazz 
with the complex rhythms of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist David Benoit had the misfortune to follow Corea -- a positioning that 
only served to emphasize the fragile level of creativity that sometimes 
afflicts his music. Typically, Benoit's best number was a light-hearted romp 
through Vince Guaraldi's "Linus and Lucy." 
</P>
<P>
The long evening finally wound to a close with a lovely a capella performance 
from Fischer's vocal quartet and a funk-drenched appearance by Tom Scott's "Pat 
Sajak Show Band." 
</P>
<P>
Donations to help fund Fischer's recovery from severe head injuries continue to 
be accepted by Musicians Wives, Inc./Clare Fischer Fund at P.O Box 4685, North 
Hollywood, 91607. DON HECKMAN

YOUTH SYMPHONY OPENS 25TH ANNIVERSARY SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No boring speeches, no appeals for money, just fine music-making. With one of 
its alumni as soloist, the American Youth Symphony opened its silver 
anniversary season Sunday evening with a splendidly delivered Tchaikovsky 
program at Royce Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Almond, who is 25 himself, brought confidence, dynamism and superb 
control to the Violin Concerto. Though his playing proved more notable for 
sweetness of tone than for definition and clarity, the former Juilliard student 
exhibited both technical mastery of and emotional involvement. 
</P>
<P>
The former Youth Symphony concertmaster (1983), while taking a fairly 
conventional interpretive stance, certainly breathed feeling and drama into the 
familiar work, and delivered myriad nuances eloquently. The orchestra matched 
him in accuracy and sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
The Fifth Symphony served as an exciting avenue for the young musicians to show 
their mettle, and for conductor Mehli Mehta to demonstrate once again how 
successfully -- following the inevitable annual personnel changes -- he can 
mold 100 individuals into a unified ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
He carefully regulated balances and dynamics, allowing details to emerge 
clearly and the dramatic flow of each movement to unfold logically. His strings 
sounded full and vibrant, woodwinds especially expressive, and brass remarkably 
vital and heroic. 
</P>
<P>
The program opened with the Fantasy-Overture, "Romeo and Juliet," in a reading 
full of passion. Again, kudos to this year's clear, precise and energized brass 
section.TERRY McQUILKIN

SHANGHAI QUARTET JOINS MUSIC OF EAST AND WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though not proofed against street noise or internal off-stage distractions, the 
courtyard of the Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena proved an evocative, engaging 
concert space for the Shanghai String Quartet Sunday evening. Performing for 
Chamber Music in Historic Sites, the young ensemble played a well-constructed 
program with vigor and elan. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the agenda was the "Song of the Ch'in" by Zhou Long and 
Bartok's Third Quartet. Though literally a world apart in mood and expressive 
focus, both works employ many of the same compositional and technical tricks, 
making a very effective pairing. 
</P>
<P>
"Song of the Ch'in" is an episodic, atmospheric piece that re-creates sounds of 
the ch'in, a Chinese type of zither. In doing so, the composer reveals a sure 
understanding of the string quartet as a single entity. The ensemble -- 
violinists Wei Gang Li and Hong Gang Li, violist Zheng Wang and cellist Kathe 
Jarka -- met all the colorful demands with confident, integrated playing. 
</P>
<P>
Their Bartok alternated between fire and ice, in a taut, purposeful account. 
The Shanghai violins are slender-toned and sweet in contrast to the big, dark 
sounds of the viola and cello, which left some passages unbalanced. But the 
cumulative effect was one of convincing intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
The concert began with a light flight through Haydn's currently fashionable 
"Lark" Quartet. At the end of the printed program came Brahm's C-minor Quartet, 
Opus 51, No. 1, in an initially generic reading troubled by more than just 
Jarka's loose string, which she retuned while the others continued playing. It 
peaked into an individual statement in the Allegretto, though, and continued 
with fiendish brio in the finale. 
</P>
<P>
The group came back for one encore, the folk song "The Chinese Girl," in an 
arrangement that sounded like pure Dvorak. JOHN HENKEN

6 KILLED, 16 INJURED IN BOMBING OF SALVADOR LABOR UNION OFFICE

<P>
A powerful bomb exploded at the headquarters of the country's largest labor 
union today, killing six people and wounding 16. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded in front of the headquarters of the National Federation of 
Salvadoran Workers, the country's largest labor organization. No group 
immediately claimed responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Salvadoran leftist rebels had earlier announced a new offensive against the 
right-wing government, and a human rights group separately blamed the country's 
armed forces for a predawn bombing that injured four people, including a Los 
Angeles woman and a 4-month-old baby. 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Hubbard, 41, of Los Angeles, who was injured during the explosion, told 
reporters that she was sleeping at the offices of the Committee of Mothers of 
the Disappeared and Political Prisoners, known as COMADRES, when a bomb 
exploded at the entrance about 2:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"It has definitely got to be the military forces," Hubbard said of the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard called on the United States to withdraw its $90-million annual military 
aid to El Salvador. "I am so angry," she said. "I am an American, and it's my 
money that is paying for all this destruction and killing."

BUSH, GORBACHEV TO MEET ON SHIPS IN MEDITERRANEAN; 
</P>
<P>
'A CHANCE TO PUT FEET UP AND TALK'

<P>
President Bush announced today that he will hold a shipboard summit with Soviet 
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Dec. 2 and 3 aboard American and Soviet naval 
vessels in the Mediterranean. A similar announcement was made simultaneously in 
Moscow by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance to put our feet up and talk," Bush said of the plans for an 
unexpectedly early meeting between the superpower leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"The upcoming talks between the Soviet and American leaders will be informal, 
aimed at allowing them to know each other better," Shevardnadze told reporters 
halfway around the world. 
</P>
<P>
In his nationally televised announcement at the White House, Bush said, "I made 
the proposal" for the meeting. He said an arms control summit with Gorbachev 
will take place as scheduled next year, "separate and apart" from the two days 
of talks in December. 
</P>
<P>
"The meeting is not being set up to achieve agreements" on arms control or 
other issues, he stressed, but added, "I would hope we'll see eye to eye." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the Mediterranean summit over a Saturday and Sunday would permit the 
two men "to deepen our understanding." He said neither he nor Gorbachev expects 
"substantial decisions" to be made in the two days of talks. 
</P>
<P>
"In this time of change, I didn't want to miss something," Bush said. "I don't 
want to have two gigantic ships pass in the night because of failed 
communications." The unusual summit is to be held one day on an American ship 
at sea, and the other day on a Soviet vessel. 
</P>
<P>
A decision was made to hold the meeting on two ships in the Mediterranean, a 
senior Administration official said, 'because they wanted it informal, 
isolated" and to promote the concept of neutrality. 
</P>
<P>
The announcements in Washington and Moscow came at a time when Bush is under 
pressure from congressional Democrats to demonstrate more flexibility in 
responding to the dramatic changes in the Soviet Union and especially in other 
Eastern European countries, including Hungary and Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said the meeting will be 
"useful" and he commended the President for initiating it. But, Mitchell said, 
the announcement does not prompt him to take back his criticism that Bush's 
policies toward the blossoming of democracy in Eastern Europe have been overly 
"timid." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev is under pressure of a different sort at home -- to demonstrate that 
his policies of perestroika, or economic restructuring, can improve the daily 
lives of millions of Soviet citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Bush spoke at a hastily arranged news conference at the White House and then 
paused long enough to answer questions for nearly 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Shevardnadze began to speak a few minutes before Bush did and he 
told a large gathering of reporters that the meeting "should be regarded as the 
most important stage in preparing negotiations which will take place during the 
official state visit by Mikhail Gorbachev" to the United States next year. 
</P>
<P>
Of the December summit, Shevardnadze said, "I do not doubt that this meeting 
between the two leaders would contribute to broadening the changes taking place 
in the Soviet-American relationship."

FIRE IN IRVINE QUICKLY CONTROLLED

<P>
Orange County fire officials credited a properly working ventilation system at 
an Irvine manufacturing plant for the rapid control of a fire early today that 
broke out in air pollution-control equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Hazardous materials specialists were called to Holt Integrated Circuits on 
Jeronimo Road in Irvine because the company uses acids and other potent 
chemicals in the manufacturing process. The fire was confined and extinguished 
after it broke out about 4:30 a.m. without ever endangering the chemicals. The 
fire was controlled within half an hour because ventilators worked as designed 
and stopped the flow of oxygen to the fire, extinguishing the flames, said Fire 
Department spokeswoman Kathleen Cha 
</P>
<P>
Mike Garner, vice president of the company, said the fire was confined to an 
air pollution-control device on the roof that cleans gases from the 
manufacturing process before they are released into the atmosphere. He said the 
hazardous chemicals are stored in a different section of the building.

BUSH TO END CAPITAL GAINS FIGHT IF U.S. DEFAULT LOOMS

The Bush Administration will abandon its proposed capital-gains tax cut if 
faced with the threat of the government's defaulting on its loans, a Treasury 
Department official said today. 
</P>
<P>
"If it were literally a choice between capital gains and default, obviously 
Treasury would not allow default," Undersecretary Robert R. Glauber told a 
House Ways and Means subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Glauber responded only after considerable prodding by Democratic members of the 
oversight subcommittee. They fear that efforts by Senate Republicans to add a 
capital-gains cut to a bill extending the government's borrowing authority 
could jeopardize that bill and push the government toward default next week. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, President Bush told a news conference, "I plan to fight for my 
position" favoring a capital-gains tax cut. "It's something that's good for 
growth . . . investment . . . jobs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Capital gains are profits from the sales of investments such as real estate and 
securities. They are now taxed at the same rate as other income. A House-passed 
bill, which Bush endorses, would create a lower rate for capital gains for 2 
1/4 years and then permanently adjust the tax system so that gains caused 
solely by inflation were not taxed. 
</P>
<P>
Capital gains has become the dominant issue before Congress. Bush's push for 
the tax cut against opposition of Democratic leaders has blocked action on a 
$16-billion deficit-reduction bill, on legislation to boost aid to Poland and 
Hungary and on the measure raising the government's debt ceiling.

A Vietnamese who escaped from his homeland by lashing himself to the rudder 
housing of a Polish tanker for two days in monsoon seas today was denied asylum 
in the United States, a senator said. 
</P>
<P>
The request for immediate asylum was rejected by the State Department, but the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service will allow the stowaway to stay in the 
country while it reviews the request, said Bill Bryant, a spokesman for Sen. 
Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.). 
</P>
<P>
The Polish captain of the tanker took up the cause of the 23-year-old man, 
discovered during a routine lifeboat drill two days out of Ho Chi Minh City. 
But in two months of sailing, five nations -- Singapore, Bahrain, Dubai, the 
United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia -- also denied him asylum.

CHINA: EX-PRESIDENT WARNS LEADERS OF A LACK RESPECT IN U.S. AND WASHINGTON IS

In a "no-holds-barred exchange," Richard M. Nixon today told Deng Xiaoping that 
some Chinese leaders have lost respect in the United States, and Deng accused 
Washington of involvement in the democracy movement that China's army crushed 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
China's 85-year-old senior leader told the former President that "China has not 
done one single thing harmful to the United States" in the last decade, the New 
China News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the Nixon party who attended the meeting between Deng and the 
American leader who opened the door to China in 1972 characterized their 
conversation as a "a very tough, no-holds-barred exchange." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon also spoke with Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin about the "tragedy" of 
the military crackdown on student-led dissent, the American informant said. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon told Deng that he had observed relations closely for 17 years and that 
"there has never been a more difficult crisis than at the present time." 
</P>
<P>
He said it is important to discuss differences and "repair the damage that has 
been done to the respect in the United States among China's friends for some of 
China's leaders." 
</P>
<P>
He did not identify those leaders. Deng, Premier Li Peng and President Yang 
Shangkun have been singled out for ordering the June attack on pro-democracy 
demonstrators in which hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Deng charged that the United States "was involved too deeply in the turmoil and 
counterrevolutionary rebellion," the government's terms for the democracy 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
"China was the real victim, and it is unjust to reprove China for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deng and Nixon, who was on the fourth day of a private visit, agreed that 
ideological differences should be overcome and relations improved on the basis 
of common strategic interests. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very much in favor of your view regarding state-to-state relations," Deng 
said to Nixon as they met at the Great Hall of the People. "You should focus on 
the strategic interests of a country, and you should not talk about historical 
roots or differences in ideology or the strength of a country." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon has urged the governments to bury their differences over the crushing of 
dissent and mend their frayed relations.

The army took down the barricades around this Palestinian town today, ending 42 
days of seizing cars, furniture and other goods to crush a tax boycott. 
Jubilant residents took to the streets to shout victory. 
</P>
<P>
But as hundreds of townspeople waved "V" signs and sang, military authorities 
said they had succeeded in breaking the revolt, seizing the equivalent of more 
than $1.5 million to make up for unpaid taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are always collecting taxes. We have always collected taxes. We are the 
authorities," said Brig. Gen. Shaike Erez, head of the West Bank military 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Hanan Banura, a 25-year-old mother of two whose husband is in jail for refusing 
to pay taxes, said the town's defiance strengthened the 22-month-old 
Palestinian uprising against occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"We won something here," she said. "We did what we wanted to do, not what they 
wanted." 
</P>
<P>
The bulldozers that pushed away the earthen mound blocking off the Christian 
Arab town of 10,000 people ended Beit Sahur's unlikely role as a symbol of the 
revolt against occupation.

The chairman of a House panel investigating cereal makers' health claims said 
today that pressure from the Office of Management and Budget on federal 
regulators has allowed food manufacturers to lie about the benefits of eating 
their products. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.) said the Food and Drug Administration proposed in 1987 
that explicit disease-prevention claims be allowed on food labels. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss, chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee on human 
resources and intergovernmental relations, said that under OMB pressure the FDA 
bypassed the normal regulatory rules and allowed companies to begin making the 
health claims immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA said recently it had serious concerns about cereals that contain husks 
of psyllium, which contains soluble fiber. Manufacturers say the grain is safe 
and can help lower cholesterol.

Georgia-Pacific Corp., one of the largest lumber companies, today launched a 
$3.2-billion bid for papermaker Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. in a merger that 
would create the world's largest forest products company. 
</P>
<P>
Great Northern stock surged $18.75 to $61.50 in heavy early trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange, hurtling past the $58 that George-Pacific offered for each 
share. 
</P>
<P>
But Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific's stock dropped $2.25 to $51.125 as traders 
bet that it could be headed for a costly acquisition fight. 
</P>
<P>
Great Northern, headquartered in Norwalk, Conn., said the bid was uninvited, 
but Georgia-Pacific appeared determined to push forward with the offer and 
perhaps sweeten it. 
</P>
<P>
The combined forest products company would top other leading forest products 
companies such as International Paper Co. and Weyerhaeuser Co. in sales, with a 
combined total of nearly $14 billion.

Lawyers have settled all 157 lawsuits against Northwest Airlines in the crash 
of Flight 255 at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, leaving McDonnell-Douglas the 
only defendant, a federal judge announced today. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Julian A. Cook Jr. did not disclose any details of the 
out-of-court settlement, which was prematurely revealed during the weekend by 
one of the attorneys involved in the case despite Cook's gag order. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix-bound Northwest Flight 255 crashed shortly after takeoff Aug. 16, 1987, 
killing 156 people. A 4-year-old girl now living with relatives in Alabama was 
the sole survivor of the nation's second-worst air disaster. 
</P>
<P>
After announcing the settlement in the Northwest case, Cook immediately began 
questioning the six jurors and six alternates as to their impartiality to hear 
arguments in the suits against McDonnell-Douglas, the St. Louis-based 
manufacturer of the ill-fated MD-80 aircraft.

The cost to employers to pay the wages and benefits of workers climbed 1.6% in

again driving up benefit costs at a faster pace than salaries, the government 
said today.

The 1.6% gain was up from a 1.3% increase in the July-September period last

The stock market staged a broad-based rally today, triggered by news of a 
$3-billion takeover offer for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 41.60 points to finish at 
2,645.08. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 13 to 5 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 1,120 issues up, 435 down and 407 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 176.10 million shares, against 126.63 million in 
Monday's session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 2.65 to 188.24. 
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index closed at 370.58, up 
1.71. 
</P>
<P>
The momentum began at the opening bell on news that Georgia Pacific Corp. had 
offered to acquire the Norwalk, Conn.-based paper company, and it continued 
throughout the session. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street analysts said the tender offer helped renew investor confidence 
that had eroded after the collapse earlier this month of proposed deals 
involving UAL Corp. and AMR Corp. The failure of a UAL pilot-led group to get 
the necessary financing to buy the company helped trigger the mid-October stock 
plunge. 
</P>
<P>
"The paper offer was helpful because it shows that deals are still going to be 
done or at least are attempting to be done," said Brad Weeks, head of equity 
trading for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. 
</P>
<P>
The market's ability to sustain the rally throughout the session surprised many 
analysts, who expected investor pessimism to return after initial euphoria. 
</P>
<P>
The tender offer helped revive paper stocks, which had languished in recent 
months, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
New government data that suggested the pace of economic growth is slowing had 
little effect on the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the rally was "orderly and pleasant" without the violent swings 
brought on by program trading. Some brokerages in recent days announced that 
they are suspending index arbitrage. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices headed moderately higher today in brisk early trading, buoyed by 
feelings that the economy is slowing down significantly. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up nearly 1/2 point, or $5 per 
$1,000 face amount, by midday. Its yield, which moves inversely to price, fell 
to 7.88% from 7.92% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the government report today showing a steep drop in new-home 
sales during September was largely responsible for the increase in bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor, they said, was the government report that the index of leading 
indicators inched up last month, indicating continued slow growth in the months 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's also some anticipation of weak economic numbers for the 
remainder of the week," said Jay Goldinger, who runs the Beverly Hills 
investment banking firm Capital Insight Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"There's the feeling that once the news is digested by the Federal Reserve, it 
will give them more reason to ease" interest rates, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Moody's investment grade corporate bond index was unavailable today because of 
computer problems at the company. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on Treasury bills fell to 7.93% as the discount fell 9 basis points to 
7.68%. Yields on six-month bills fell to 7.88% as the discount fell 12 basis 
points to 7.49%.

The British Parliament passed controversial anti-hooligan laws Monday that will 
require English soccer fans to carry identity cards to enter stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
The scheme, fiercely opposed by soccer clubs, which fear that it could cut 
attendance, was proposed by the government to tackle the violence that has led 
to English clubs being banned from European soccer competitions. 
</P>
<P>
The Football Spectators Bill was passed 273 to 204 late Monday night after an 
angry debate. It must be ratified by the House of Lords and is expected to 
become law early next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Hooliganism has been an ugly scar on the face of football for a number of 
years," Environment Secretary Chris Patten told Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition Labor Party environment spokesman John Cunningham rejected the bill 
as ineffectual. "The problem is no longer inside the grounds. The identity 
scheme isn't going to stop people causing problems in town or city centers and 
on boats," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, people who attend games of the 92 English Football League clubs 
will have to use computer-read cards to pass through turnstiles. Troublemakers 
will have their cards taken away and be refused entry to any ground. 
</P>
<P>
Sports Minister Colin Moynihan has said he will not support a return to 
European competition for English clubs until the new scheme is successfully 
introduced. 
</P>
<P>
English clubs were banned from Europe after Liverpool supporters rioted at the 
1985 European Cup Final against Juventus at Brussels' Heysel Stadium. 
Thirty-nine Italians were killed when a wall collapsed on them.

<P>
Reliever Mark Davis, whose 44 saves for the San Diego Padres last season led 
the major leagues, has filed for free agency, the pitcher's agent said. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Hendricks, Davis' agent, said he sent a telex to the Major League Players 
Assn. office in New York after closing hours Monday to inform the association 
of Davis' intentions. 
</P>
<P>
"The news will become official today," Hendricks said. 
</P>
<P>
The association announced Monday that 18 players filed for free agency on the 
first eligible date, including Padres outfielder Carmelo Martinez. Davis' name 
was not included in the first group because the notification arrived late. 
</P>
<P>
Under the basic agreement, Davis and Hendricks are restricted to negotiating 
with the Padres until the 15-day free agent filing period expires Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis' agent can talk to other clubs during that time as long as they do

Davis, 29, is bargaining from a position of strength. He won the Rolaids Relief 
Pitcher of the Year award with the second-highest save total ever by a National 
League pitcher. Bruce Sutter recorded 45 in 1984 for the St. Louis Cardinals.

"There's no question we wouldn't have gotten nearly as far as we did without 
him, and as manager I wouldn't want to be without him," Padres manager Jack 
McKeon said of Davis. San Diego finished second in the NL West, three games 
behind the San Francisco Giants.

Davis reportedly is seeking a contract that would pay him at least $7 million 
over the next three years.

Washington State starting center Paul Wulff will miss the final two football 
games of the season after undergoing emergency surgery early this morning, 
athletic officials said. Wulff, a 6-foot-4, 274-pound senior who started all 
nine of the Cougars' games this season, underwent an appendectomy shortly after 
his 1 a.m. admission to Pullman Memorial Hospital. He was listed in stable 
condition this morning and is expected to remain in the hospital two to three 
days, athletic officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Wulff, from Davis, Calif., will miss the final two regular-season games against 
California and Washington but could be available if the Cougars are invited to 
a post-season bowl game, Coach Mike Price said.

Whoopi Goldberg is about to become a grandmother -- thanks to her unmarried 
15-year-old daughter, Alexandria. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe my first reaction was, 'Gee, I'm going to break your legs,' " 
Goldberg said in an interview that will air on "The Joan Rivers Show" Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"And then she (Alexandria) said, 'Well, it really won't change anything if you 
break my legs.' " Goldberg raised the possibility of abortion but changed her 
attitude when Alexandria told her that she intentionally got pregnant because 
she wanted to have a baby. 
</P>
<P>
"It would not have been what I would have chosen for her, but at the same time, 
I thought, 'What a great thing that she's confident enough in me to tell me,' " 
Goldberg said.
