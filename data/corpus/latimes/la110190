CSSM FIRES TROUBLED CONTRACTOR; DELAY IN OPENING CAMPUS LIKELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Louetto Construction has been fired from its work on the Cal State San Marcos 
campus, a company official said Wednesday, just one day after the city of 
Escondido took the firm off a park project for failure to pay subcontractors 
and material suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect to receive termination on the Cal State San Marcos project 
tomorrow," said John Tiersma, project manager for Louetto, Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Louetto's termination increases the chances that the opening of the campus will 
be delayed. University officials had previously said that, if work did not 
resume by the end of October the new campus, scheduled to be open by August, 
1992, might open a semester late. And, according to workers on the campus 
project, it will take two more weeks to resume work, on top of the time it 
takes to hire a new contractor, 
</P>
<P>
Work on the first phase of Cal State San Marcos site, a $9 million project, is 
scheduled to be completed by Sept. 12, 1991. University officials worry that a 
delay in the first phase will in turn slow following work. Construction on the 
first phase stopped in September after Louetto missed two payments totaling 
$1.3 million to the grading subcontractor, C.W. Poss. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the city of Escondido fired Louetto from the $1.4 million Mountain 
View Park project. Fifteen subcontractors and suppliers on the project filed 
"stop-notices," indicating that Louetto had not paid them, said Dale Mathre, 
the city's park and open space superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
The Escondido and Cal State San Marcos projects represent the second and third 
times in less than a month that the Escondido-based construction company has 
been fired by a public agency in North County. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, the North County Transit District ordered Louetto off a 
$6.7-million renovation of the Oceanside bus maintenance yard for purportedly 
improper installation of underground fuel tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Hartnett, project manager for C.W. Poss, confirmed that Louetto has been 
taken off the San Marcos project. Louetto's bonding company, Reliance Surety, 
has informed C.W. Poss that it will not be working with Louetto on the project, 
Hartnett said. 
</P>
<P>
"They have basically told us that they are not going to have Louetto finish the 
project," she said Wednesday. "We've been told that (Reliance is) talking to 
other contractors this week." 
</P>
<P>
Hartnett said that, once a new contractor is found, it will take at least two 
weeks to resume work. 
</P>
<P>
"We've already taken all our equipment off the site and left the project," 
Hartnett said. 
</P>
<P>
University officials and spokesmen for the bonding company could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido officials had given Louetto until last Friday to come up with a plan 
to pay subcontractors and suppliers the $270,000 that was owed on a park 
project, said Mathre, the city's park superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
"We had given them a deadline of Friday to provide a plan to clear the stop 
notices, and we did not receive a response and therefore proceeded with 
cancellation," Mathre said. 
</P>
<P>
The park, which began in January and originally was to be constructed by the 
end of July, is about 95% complete, Mathre said, and the city has asked the 
subcontractors to complete the project without Louetto. 
</P>
<P>
Louetto is now negotiating with the California State University system to 
continue work on the site of Cal State San Marcos. Grading of the site came to 
a halt earlier this month because a subcontractor claims Louetto owes it $1.4 
million for work done on the project. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-acre Mountain View Park in Escondido, at the corner of Glenn Ridge Road 
and Citrus Avenue, would be the fifth community park in the city and have two 
ball fields, tennis courts, a playground and open turf areas, Mathre said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're authorizing the subcontractors that were already on the job to complete 
the work," Mathre said. 
</P>
<P>
The most important of the unfinished tasks at the park is the seeding of the 
ball fields, Mathre said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a park that we're wanting to use in the spring for the Little League 
program, and if we want turf in the spring, we need to get seeds on the ground 
as quickly as possible," said Mathre, who hopes the project will be completed 
within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Tiersma, Louetto's project manager, acknowledged that the firm has missed 
payments to the subcontractors on the project. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been around for 38 years, and the past few years have just been tough," 
Tiersma said. "It's partly due to the economy, and who knows what else." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Fox, co-owner of Acme Iron Works, was one of the subcontractors that 
filed a stop-notice against Louetto. Fox said he recently reached a settlement 
with Louetto on payment for two other jobs and work on Mountain View Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing business with this guy for 33 years, and it's only recently 
that he's gotten into trouble," Fox said. "(Louetto's) reputation now is worse 
than a used-car salesman's." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Brody, president of Creative Lighting in San Diego, is still owed $10,000 
by Louetto for work on the Escondido project, and he is skeptical that Louetto 
will be able to recover from its financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
"He has debts everywhere right now," Brody said of Lou Pauletto, owner of 
Louetto Construction. "I don't think that anybody at this point that has any 
sense wants to walk into that fire."

SLAIN STUDENT'S PARENTS, FRIENDS HONOR HER IN CHILDREN'S PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jean Weinhold stood a few feet away from her husband. She let him do the 
talking. He complimented the police and the city of San Diego, and she nodded. 
Then he started talking about their daughter -- their only child, who's gone 
now -- and softly, she began to cry. 
</P>
<P>
A few cameras snapped. A few minicams moved closer. 
</P>
<P>
Early Wednesday, Raymond and Jean Weinhold had flown from their home in 
Scottsdale, Ariz., to San Diego to donate $1,000 to a children's park in memory 
of their daughter, Janene Marie, who was slain just a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
Hers was the second in a series of five slayings. She was a 21-year-old 
straight-A student at UC San Diego who wanted to be a lawyer. Minutes after 
baking cookies and doing her laundry, Janene Marie Weinhold was stabbed more 
than 30 times. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing more than a statistic, as far as most are concerned," the Weinholds 
wrote in a statement released to the press. 
</P>
<P>
But now the couple had come to San Diego, to a city their daughter loved, in 
their words, "intensely." She had lived -- and died -- at 3301 Clairemont 
Drive, in a small, upstairs apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother said the apartment "meant everything to her, because it signified 
her first true independence. Independence and strength meant everything to 
Janene. Sometimes, it used to upset us when she would call from college. She 
always sounded so upbeat. We would say, 'Can't you sound a little bit homesick? 
It might make us feel better. We miss you.' " 
</P>
<P>
The South Clairemont Park and Recreation Center, which will now honor Janene's 
memory, is at 3605 Clairemont Drive in a setting that seems as removed from 
investigations, serial killers and statistics as one can imagine. 
</P>
<P>
As reporters pushed forward, the Weinholds stood before a background of swings, 
slides and jungle gyms. Three children passing by on the sidewalk wore 
Halloween costumes representing a Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtle, a scarecrow and 
Minnie Mouse -- and stared at the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
A television reporter asked Raymond Weinhold if he was aware of the weeks that 
separate the murders. 
</P>
<P>
He looked puzzled. He asked for clarification. 
</P>
<P>
It's been six weeks since the last one on Sept. 13, the reporter said, when 
42-year-old Pamela Gail Clark and her 18-year-old daughter, Amber, were found 
stabbed to death in their home in University City, just a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
It's about time for the killer to strike again, isn't it?, the reporter said. 
So, does Mr. Weinhold "worry about that?" 
</P>
<P>
From the back of the crowd, a young woman, a friend and UCSD classmate of 
Janene's, gasped, "My God!" 
</P>
<P>
"You bet," Raymond Weinhold said quietly. "I worry about that." 
</P>
<P>
Three murders have happened since Janene's, he said, and each time, "the 
semblance of a scab is torn off and opens everything up." 
</P>
<P>
Weinhold, who heads the Scottsdale Memorial Health Foundation, the 
philanthropic arm of the city's hospital system, said he doesn't blame San 
Diego for the "unspeakable crime" that happened to his Janene. Furthermore, 
he's "only about 1,000%" behind the San Diego Police Department, which he 
thinks is doing a "superb job." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Bruce Henderson was there Wednesday, shaking hands and saying 
the police were doing everything they can. Henderson, whose district includes 
Clairemont, where three of the killings occurred, cautioned young women to be 
more careful. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of older women were there. Dolores Osterhaus, who lives five blocks from 
where Janene Marie Weinhold was murdered, said that, before the killings, she 
had never locked her door. 
</P>
<P>
"But now I have it bolted every way I can," Osterhaus said. 
</P>
<P>
Her friend, Ginger Nolan, said people in the neighborhood, especially women, 
"only go out in twos any more, and we usually rely on a security guard to 
escort us in." The management of the Buena Vista Gardens apartments, where 
Weinhold and one other victim was murdered, has made the service available. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan said living in the area is sometimes like living in "a state of siege. . 
. . Whether it's right to feel that way or not, that's how a lot of folks 
feel." 
</P>
<P>
Seven of Janene Weinhold's friends were there, huddled in the background. Some 
said they had no desire to talk to the media. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been burned before," one muttered. 
</P>
<P>
"We're afraid we'll lose it," another said. 
</P>
<P>
Penny Spiekerman, Weinhold's roommate, was the one who discovered her friend's 
body. In a prepared statement, Spiekerman said Janene "would go out of her way 
to cheer up friends -- by imitating them, singing off-key, writing a poem, 
etc." 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, her parents loved her very much," another friend said, fighting 
back tears. "We wanted a park -- something innocent, something hopeful, 
something free -- to help us remember a really special friend." 
</P>
<P>
Jean Weinhold said most of her daughter's friends wished not to discuss the 
death "because they've talked about it so much and find opening up the sore 
again very hard. We've all been through this so many times. Today, Ray and I 
said to Janene's friends that they could speak, or not speak, whatever they 
wished to do." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the mother of the victim said, coverage by the media, as 
well as the police manhunt, have been "fine." But it's a matter of focus, she 
said, on the killer rather than the victims. She's lost a daughter who, by 
almost everyone's standards, was "impeccable." 
</P>
<P>
Another victim, Holly Suzanne Tarr, was a talented actress. Another, Tiffany 
Paige Schultz, wanted to teach English. Amber Clark had successfully battled 
drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
"But the focus of any coverage and any investigation loses sight of what an 
incredible tragedy this is -- not to mention an incredible waste of life," Jean 
Weinhold said. "Five lives. I've asked myself a million times -- why? -- but I 
never come close to an answer. 
</P>
<P>
"And I never will. You have no idea what it's like until it happens to you, but 
then, you always say, 'It will never happen to me.' And then it does, and, no 
matter how hard you try, you'll never forget it."

HEAT-INTOLERANT FALLBROOK MAN WINS DISABILITY; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: EX-MARINE WHO CANNOT GO OUTSIDE ON A WARM DAY WITHOUT A SPECIAL COOLING 
SUIT WILL RECEIVE NAVY BENEFITS AFTER FOUR-YEAR FIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After four years of denying that an ex-Marine's inability to tolerate even 
moderate heat constituted a disability, the Navy has agreed to pay benefits to 
the man who cannot go outside on a warm day without a special cooling suit. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Ward of Fallbrook, who served seven years in the Marine Corps, was 
discharged without benefits in 1986 after suffering several episodes of heat 
exposure during his service. After those episodes, he was found to be incapable 
of tolerating heat of any kind, even that generated by his own body during 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy originally ruled that Ward had entered the Marine Corps with heat 
intolerance and gave him an honorable discharge with no benefits, even though 
military and civilian doctors both believed that his injuries were sustained 
while he served in the corps and even though he had not suffered any heat 
injuries before his service. Even if his rare medical problem was caused by his 
service, the Navy said, it did not represent a disability. 
</P>
<P>
Ward had been appealing the military's decision ever since his discharge, and, 
on Tuesday, he received written notice that his fight was over and that the 
military was declaring him 30% disabled. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully they will now start accepting disruption of thermo regulation as a 
disability, something that's very important to our guys in Saudi Arabia right 
now," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Navy's earlier ruling, the Veteran's Administration awarded Ward 
30% disability payment last year. 
</P>
<P>
Ward, after having served in the Marines for three years, was injured in 1983 
at the end of a 5-mile run with his platoon in Okinawa. He collapsed, began 
convulsing and was taken to sick bay, where they draped him with cold towels 
until his temperature returned to normal. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, he collapsed and suffered convulsions during a 20-mile run 
at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
After that incident, the episodes became more frequent, and now doctors, both 
military and civilian, have determined that Ward cannot tolerate temperatures 
above 80 degrees. Doctors have said his body apparently does not dispel through 
perspiration the heat that it builds up through exercise or exposure to warmth, 
and that his condition is likely to worsen if he is exposed to more episodes. 
</P>
<P>
Ward now wears a special suit designed to keep his body cool in relatively warm 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm as happy as a lark," Ward said. "The benefits from the Navy should give me 
access to the Navy hospital, and it will give me access to (the military 
medical insurance)." 
</P>
<P>
With the new source of income, about $400 a month, Ward said he hopes to take 
care of some of the $10,000 in debts incurred because of his injuries, 
including the $3,500 he borrowed for his suit. 
</P>
<P>
Ward and his wife, Marcy, also hope to move to the cooler Pacific Northwest, 
where he is already looking for a job. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been looking in the Portland and Seattle areas for a little more than a 
year now," said Ward, a computer programmer for a San Diego savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ward only received a Navy disability rating of 30%, he is not 
complaining. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been nice to receive more than 30%, but I'm not going to look a 
gift horse in the mouth, because I didn't think I'd make it this far," Ward 
said. "Until now, I felt like I had been swimming upstream."

DUFFY DIVERTED U.S. DRUG-SEIZURE FUNDS TO SECRET ACCOUNT; 
</P>
<P>
SHERIFF: COUNTY OFFICIALS CALL FOR INVESTIGATION BECAUSE MORE THAN $300,000 
FROM FEDERAL PROGRAM WAS NOT DEPOSITED INTO THE COUNTY TREASURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff John Duffy, prohibited since June from spending money seized in drug 
raids without county approval, failed to deposit more than $300,000 worth of 
drug funds into the county treasury and instead set up a separate, secret 
account. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said Wednesday that they will ask the district attorney's 
office to investigate Duffy's use of the money, which violates a county 
ordinance mandating the money be deposited into the county treasury and 
requiring the Board of Supervisors' approval before it is spent. 
</P>
<P>
However, because Duffy may have paid the district attorney's office a share of 
the money for its part in the drug seizure program, the state attorney 
general's office may be called in to avoid a conflict of interest, said William 
J. Kelly, the county's assistant auditor and controller. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy confirmed in an interview Wednesday that he set up the separate account 
but refused to elaborate. Assistant Sheriff Jack Drown, who is running in next 
Tuesday's election to replace Duffy, said that his boss mentioned starting such 
an account, and that Drown warned against it. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been making mystifying decisions for 20 years," Drown said. "I'm not John 
Duffy's keeper." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Glenn Revell, a Sheriff's Department spokesman, said Duffy believes that 
the money is legally under the sheriff's control. 
</P>
<P>
"These are not county funds, these are federal funds, and it's our belief that 
we're accountable to the federal government for this money, not the Board of 
Supervisors," 
</P>
<P>
Revell said. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Brian Bilbray said he is astounded by such logic. 
</P>
<P>
"These are public funds!" he said. "You can't take checks and slip them into a 
different bank account. This is the United States, not South America. 
</P>
<P>
"For a man who has years of public service as an elected official, this is one 
hell of a terrible way to depart the scene," Bilbray said. "I don't think there 
was criminal intent here; I think it was plain stupidity." 
</P>
<P>
Revell said he does not know how much money has been gathered in the separate 
account or what it was spent for. Duffy failed to respond within 10 working 
days to a request by The Times for a breakdown of the drug-fund program, as 
required by state law. He also ignored repeated requests for telephone 
interviews, except to chide a Times reporter for repeatedly calling him. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorney's office said the Sheriff's Department received $318,865 in 
drug seizure funds between July 1 and Sept. 30, a period when Duffy should have 
deposited the money with the county treasury. Overall, the department has 
received $3.134 million since the drug-fund program began in September, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Sheriff's Department's finance manager, Harold Donahoo, was not told 
about the $318,865 in drug proceeds -- called asset forfeitures. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has come to my office," he said Wednesday. "I heard about money 
floating around in another account, but we have not deposited anything in the 
county treasury since July 1. As far as I know, we've gotten no checks from 
asset forfeiture." 
</P>
<P>
County attorneys and auditors already were investigating Duffy's use of nearly 
$70,000 in drug funds to pay an attorney in a civil lawsuit. Duffy paid the law 
firm of Martin J. Mayer to defend himself against lawsuits by six deputies who 
were disciplined by Duffy for their involvement in activities of the so-called 
"Rambo Squad" at County Jail in El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
The cases were settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
Auditors warned Duffy in June that he was wrong to spend drug money on his 
attorney. Asked to reimburse the drug fund account, Duffy refused. 
</P>
<P>
Auditor Kelly said that Duffy may be forced to refund the money if county 
attorneys rule that the payment was illegal. Federal guidelines established in 
1984 allowed law enforcement officials to keep money and property seized in 
drug arrests. Two years later, federal officials ruled that the money could be 
used "for law enforcement purposes only." 
</P>
<P>
Although the definition is broad, many police agencies prefer to use the money 
to fight drug offenders. Others have used it to build jails, buy police cars, 
pay for overtime and other uses. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Duffy sought to use $450,000 in drug money for laptop computers. When 
county supervisors said they preferred that the money instead be used for jail 
security, Duffy insisted that spending money on jail improvements was a 
violation federal guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors decided to amend the ordinance governing the drug monies by 
requiring that Duffy get specific approval before spending the funds. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy was angry. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot be a party to the charade that would be created by implementing the 
proposed ordinance by simply going along to get along," he wrote the board. 
</P>
<P>
In that letter, Duffy may have been warning the board of his intent to 
establish a separate account for the drug funds: "I will, therefore, undertake 
whatever action I deem appropriate to scrupulously adhere to all of the rules 
applicable to the spirit and intent of federal equitable sharing . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department spokesman Revell said Wednesday that Duffy is accountable 
only to federal authorities for how the money was used. 
</P>
<P>
"It is Sheriff Duffy's opinion on asset forfeiture funds that the Board of 
Supervisors has no business attempting to control those funds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Auditor Kelly said that Duffy's receiving the money is comparable to the 
county's Department of Social Services getting state grant money or the housing 
department getting federal money and then turning it over to the county. 
</P>
<P>
"My view is the the county of San Diego is the law enforcement agency, not the 
Sheriff's Department," he said. "The money goes to the local legislative body 
that appropriates it for expenditure." 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray said he could not believe that Duffy, who has challenged supervisors 
for years, would want to keep the drug account secret. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never known John to be bashful in public," he said. "If he was going to 
show the Board of Supervisors who was boss, why didn't he do it face to face?" 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray said it is inconceivable that another county department manager would 
have tried to set up a secret fund and keep if from the board's control. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem is that the slush fund was created outside the county 
budgetary process," he said. "It was done in such a clandestine way that nobody 
could get into the system to find out how much money he got, when did he get it 
and what did he spend it on. He violated every one of the rules." 
</P>
<P>
The emergence of Duffy's secret account has become a campaign issue. On 
Wednesday, Drown's opponent, Jim Roache, said Drown had to know about the 
account because he worked closely with Duffy as one of his assistant sheriffs. 
</P>
<P>
"This could not have happened without Drown knowing about it," Roache said. 
"He's in the immediate vicinity of the sheriff's office. Jack has looked the 
other way on a number of occasions and pretended problems weren't there just to 
keep the benevolence of John Duffy." 
</P>
<P>
Drown told The Times Wednesday that Duffy mentioned the secret account, but 
Drown thought it had been established after he left the department in August to 
campaign full time. 
</P>
<P>
"He talked about it. He said 'Maybe I'll take that money and put it in a 
separate account.' I told him that the county ordinance doesn't allow you to do 
that," Drown said. "I commented against it. I wouldn't have done it. This is 
the type of thing that creates a strained relationship with the board." 
</P>
<P>
Drown said he is tired of being tied to every Duffy decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not his attorney, and I'm not his auditor," Drown said. "All of a sudden, 
I'm supposed to be John Duffy's keeper. I'm not his right-hand man and Roache 
knows it."

POLICE ANGRY AFTER FUGITIVE IN SAN PEDRO CASE IS FREED; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: IT TOOK A YEAR TO CATCH A COUPLE WHO HAD PLEADED NO CONTEST TO 
EMBEZZLEMENT. A LAS VEGAS COURT GRANTED THE WIFE BAIL; SHE FLED AGAIN.

It was just last week that detectives were celebrating the capture of a couple 
who had skipped town a year ago after pleading no contest to charges of 
embezzling tens of thousands of dollars from the wife's San Pedro employer. 
</P>
<P>
The celebration didn't last long. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Los Angeles officials learned that a Las Vegas justice of the peace 
had set Georgia Mulchahey free over the weekend on $10,000 bond. Although the 
justice revoked the bond Tuesday after he caught an earful from furious Los 
Angeles officials, Mulchahey apparently has disappeared again. 
</P>
<P>
"We just can't believe this happened," said Sgt. Paul Scauzillo of the 
Sheriff's Department's fugitive detail. "It's outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
Formerly of Rolling Hills Estates, Mulchahey, 60, and her husband, James, 65, 
failed to appear in Long Beach Superior Court on Nov. 30, 1989, when they were 
sentenced to four years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Local and out-of-state authorities continued to hunt for the Mulchaheys, even 
flagging their local bank accounts, and that effort paid off early last month. 
James Mulchahey was captured Oct. 9 when he called the Wells Fargo Bank in 
Rolling Hills and a teller talked him into coming to the branch to sign some 
documents. Police were waiting. 
</P>
<P>
His wife was caught by FBI agents 10 days later in Nevada when she tried to 
disguise herself with a blond wig to pick up her mail at a Las Vegas postal 
box. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Mulchahey immediately fought extradition back to California, prompting 
authorities here to file a request that she be held in custody without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, during a brief hearing Friday, Justice of the Peace James Bartley 
set bail at $10,000, allowing Mulchahey's release Saturday after she posted 
$1,000 with a bail bondsman. 
</P>
<P>
Bartley declined to return telephone calls Tuesday, but court secretary Camille 
Leavitt said the justice was not aware that there was anything unusual about 
Mulchahey's case when he set bail. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten thousand dollars is double the standard bail for this kind of charge," 
Leavitt said. "Everyone is entitled to bail, even fugitives." 
</P>
<P>
Leavitt said Clark County (Nev.) Deputy Dist. Atty. Ed Ewert appeared as the 
prosecutor at Friday's bail hearing, but Ewert said he did not recall the case. 
</P>
<P>
"It may have come up during one of my days in arraignment court, but I just 
don't remember it, and I have no details on it," Ewert said. 
</P>
<P>
Ewert referred inquiries to a more senior deputy district attorney, Douglas 
Smith, but Smith failed to return telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas Metro Police Sgt. Julie Goldberg said that department's fugitive 
experts are looking for Mulchahey. Calling the release "a mix-up," Goldberg 
said judges in Las Vegas often set bail lower than requested by the authorities 
in fugitives' home states. 
</P>
<P>
"(Judges) generally go on what the bond is in this here state," Goldberg said. 
"After L.A. complained, then our district attorney's office contacted the 
judge, and he revoked the thing." 
</P>
<P>
The Mulchaheys were sentenced to prison for stealing from the office accounts 
of San Pedro insurance agent Bernard O'Neal's Harbor Insurance Agency, a 
57-year fixture on Gaffey Street. 
</P>
<P>
The Mulchaheys pleaded no contest to the theft of about $34,000, but O'Neal 
said audits conducted since that time have turned up evidence that the 
Mulchaheys made off with at least $151,000 and possibly as much as $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Mulchaheys now face additional charges of grand theft, forgery 
and conspiracy for allegedly faking a deed on an acquaintance's Rancho Palos 
Verdes house and collecting a $280,000 home loan shortly before skipping town.

ELECTIONS BALLOT MEASURES; 
</P>
<P>
PROP. B WOULD PAY FOR PARK PROJECTS IN SOUTH BAY CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a ballot title long enough to take a voter's breath away: The Safer 
Neighborhood Parks, Tree-Planting, Gang Prevention, Senior Recreation, Beaches 
and Wildlife Bond Act. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition B on Tuesday's election ballot has such a long name because it 
offers something for everyone, supporters say. In the South Bay alone, the 
$817-million county bond measure would preserve open space in Rancho Palos 
Verdes, help rebuild the Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach piers, renovate the 
waterfront in Avalon and develop a Harbor Walkway in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would also distribute $140 million to the county's 86 cities and 
unincorporated areas, based on their population, for park and recreation 
projects. Torrance, for example, would receive $2.3 million, Inglewood $1.7 
million, Carson $1.4 million, Redondo Beach more than $1 million, Gardena 
$824,000 and Hermosa Beach $320,000. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles, with a population of 3.4 million, would get more than 
$55 million. 
</P>
<P>
Detractors, including city officials in Palos Verdes Estates, say the measure 
is too expensive and unnecessarily raises property taxes. They derisively call 
it "park barrel" politics. 
</P>
<P>
If Proposition B is approved by two-thirds of the voters, the county would 
finance the improvements by selling bonds, to be repaid over 20 years by 
property owners. The repayment would add about $20 a year -- or $404 over 20 
years -- to the tax bill of a home assessed at $250,000, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents have also criticized the genesis of the measure, saying it was 
written primarily to benefit the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. The state 
agency would receive $76.5 million from the measure to preserve natural 
mountain lands. 
</P>
<P>
The "No on B" ballot argument calls the proposition's supporters "a group of 
self-serving individuals whose primary interest is to get the public to buy 
private land in the Santa Monica Mountains. They enticed others to support this 
bond measure by promising financing for their pet projects." 
</P>
<P>
Esther Feldman, who conceived Proposition B, said the measure was designed from 
its inception to include a wide range of projects around the county. "It was 
always my concept and idea to provide for all (of the county's) open-space 
needs and parks," Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman, campaign director for Proposition B, conceded that she first proposed 
the county bond measure while working for an agency -- the Mountains Recreation 
and Conservation Authority -- that represents the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy and two Ventura County park districts. But she said her 
affiliations should not be an issue in the Proposition B campaign. 
</P>
<P>
She suggested that voters simply decide whether the proposed projects, 
including preservation of Santa Monica Mountains wild lands, are worth the 
extra tax cost. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition B would raise $50 million for county beaches, including improving 
lifeguard towers and restrooms. It would pay $121 million to rehabilitate the 
Hollywood Bowl, Los Angeles Zoo, Griffith Observatory, the County Museum of 
Natural History, the County Museum of Art and the California Museum of Science 
and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
It would raise another $60 million for countywide programs to build trails, 
plant trees, clean up graffiti, improve natural rivers and rehabilitate 
historic sites. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in tiny Palos Verdes Estates have been among the most vocal opponents 
of the measure, claiming that only nine of the county's 86 cities would receive 
more in benefits than they would pay in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Jim Hendrickson estimated that if Proposition B passes, Palos 
Verdes Estates residents would pay $3.5 million in higher taxes but receive 
only $243,000 to spend on parks and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had suggested other projects that could be added to the bond 
measure, such as establishment of a Bluff Cove Park or refurbishment of 
Roessler Pool, but Feldman said the projects would not serve a wide enough area 
and so were rejected, Hendrickson said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the measure calls for the neighboring city of Rancho Palos Verdes to 
receive $15 million to develop Point Vicente Regional Park and to acquire 
natural lands and wildlife habitats. Additionally, the city would receive 
$744,000 for general park programs. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrickson said Proposition B might have been more palatable to Palos Verdes 
Estates officials if the city had been slated for more money. But he said the 
main reason for the city's opposition is that the measure is poorly planned, 
tacking a grab bag of improvements onto what is essentially an appropriation 
for the distant Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition B supporters dispute that contention, saying the vast bulk of the 
money goes to regional projects that will serve residents from all over the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman argued, for example, that Palos Verdes Estates residents will benefit 
from improvements at county beaches and museums and would have to drive just a 
short distance to enjoy open space that will be preserved in Rancho Palos 
Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
"All these projects," Feldman said, "have significance for a much broader 
area." 
</P>
<P>

POLITICS: DEPARTURE OF LONG-ENTRENCHED TRUSTEES HAS ENDED THE RANCOR THAT ONCE 
MARKED CAMPAIGNS.

What a difference a couple of years make. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the San Diego Community College District was awash in controversy, 
with distrust between the faculty and a long-entrenched board of trustees over 
a stagnant educational philosophy, the personality of administrative leaders 
and an unusual financial arrangement for a district foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, district relationships have moved light-years from those 
times, with two new board members elected in November 1988, two new 
administrators widely praised by faculty and community alike and a solution to 
the festering foundation issue. 
</P>
<P>
So, in contrast to past elections, the campaigns this fall for three of the 
five trustee seats have been marked not by rancor or back-biting on philosophy 
or personality, but more traditional debate -- rare in many campaigns these 
days -- over who is more qualified to continue and improve upon present 
district policies. 
</P>
<P>
None of the three incumbents, two retiring after 17 years and a third after 
nine years, chose to stand for reelection. With the 1988 election of reform 
candidates Evonne Schulze and Fred Colby, all trustees after the November 
balloting will have come aboard within the past two years, symbolizing the 
change that has swept the district. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego district is the second-largest among California's 71 community 
college districts, providing vocational and part-time education to working 
students, as well as preparing others who are unable at first to meet 
four-year-college financial or academic entry requirements for transfer to the 
UC and Cal State systems . 
</P>
<P>
In District A, which covers the Point Loma and beach areas, Yvonne Larsen is 
running against Kara Kobey. Larsen took 41% of the June primary vote to Kobey's 
30.5% preparatory to the citywide runoff next week. 
</P>
<P>
Larsen, 59, has a long record of involvement in both San Diego and national 
educational activities, which she points to as proof of her ability to handle 
matters at the community college level, with its $230-million annual budget, 
its 120,000 full- and part-time students, and its 7,000 faculty and other 
employees. The district has three campuses -- Mesa, City and Miramar -- as well 
as numerous continuing education centers throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
Larsen, a San Diego State graduate, served eight years on the San Diego Unified 
School District board, which governs kindergarten-through-12th grade policies 
in the city, was a trustee of the California State University system, and held 
the vice chairman role on the 1981 National Commission on Excellence in 
Education. That commission produced the watershed "Nation at Risk" study in 
1983, from which nationwide reforms have since emanated. 
</P>
<P>
Larsen has stressed her management experience at numerous candidate forums, 
saying she knows how to "stand and fight" when things do not always run 
smoothly. Larsen wants the district to offer more literacy programs, put more 
technology into its classrooms and act more creatively with the San Diego 
school district in devising programs for preventing and recapturing dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
Kobey, 32, is making her first run at elected office, saying she herself 
benefited from the community colleges -- she is a 1982 graduate of Mesa before 
going on to San Diego State -- and wants to return something. 
</P>
<P>
Kobey, best known as the daughter of the late Monte Kobey and his famous swap 
meets, calls for more rapid completion of Miramar College, the district's 
newest, and for renovation of Mesa, now severely crowded after more than 25 
years of use. 
</P>
<P>
Kobey also advocates more trade partnerships between private businesses and 
vocational programs at the colleges, saying such links could provide students 
with a more realistic understanding of how their training will pay off with 
private industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the value of a community college education, and I know how useful it 
can be to those who go on to other study," Kobey said. 
</P>
<P>
In District A, Miramar College political science and physical education 
professor Robert Bacon, 57, is paired against Maria Senour, a professor of 
counseling education at San Diego State. Senour won 48.3% of the primary vote 
against Bacon's 16.7% in the district, which covers the northern tier of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Senour, 46, a graduate of Marygrove College in Detroit, has emphasized her 
experience in training counselors, since a large part of the district's 
challenge is in retaining more ethnic-minority students after they begin their 
studies. Senour also would like Mesa's renovation to be moved higher on 
district capital improvement lists, as well as have an expansion of the 
transfer guarantee program that automatically ensures students entry in their 
junior year to UC San Diego if they complete a prescribed course of study. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the community colleges as particularly important for poor people 
economically," Senior said. "For many students, the push to succeed comes from 
educators who take the time to help, and the community colleges need more 
people who can personally touch a student in some way . . . to be role models 
in making a personal outreach." 
</P>
<P>
Bacon, 57, has taught at district sites for 31 years and is known to legions of 
longtime San Diegans for his tennis instruction. A San Diego State graduate, he 
has been a professor at Miramar the past 12 years and was the president of the 
faculty senate for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Bacon reflects the view of all the candidates in saying that "this is a good 
district already, which can be made better" and he stresses his familiarity 
with Assembly Bill 1725, the 1988 state legislation that requires sweeping 
changes in the state community college system, both in educational offerings 
and in improving the quality of full-time faculty. 
</P>
<P>
As Miramar faculty senate president, Bacon had a role in the district's record 
of hiring almost 50% new faculty from nonwhite applicants in an effort to have 
its professorial staff represent more closely the multiethnic mix of its 
student body. 
</P>
<P>
As a trustee, Bacon would work to increase academic course offerings and 
especially try to improve the college libraries, which have suffered along with 
libraries throughout the state's educational system because of budget cuts and 
higher costs for periodicals and specialized serials. 
</P>
<P>
Hope Logan and Denise Ducheny are the finalists in District E, which 
encompasses many of the city's nonwhite neighborhoods including Logan Heights, 
Southeast San Diego, Paradise Hills and Encanto. Logan garnered 51.6% of the 
primary vote, and Ducheny won 24.7%. 
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old Logan is well-known for her longtime community and educational 
activism. She has served as an officer of the Urban League of San Diego, as a 
member of the city's Civil Service Commission and as a member of the San Diego 
Community Foundation board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Logan, a graduate of UCLA, also was a lecturer for many years at San Diego 
State and chairwoman of an education committee for the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
As a product of public schools, Logan said the community colleges are the last 
hope for many young people who otherwise have no future as productive citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"For some time, I've seen too many children who complete 12th grade with 
nothing for them to do; they are not yet educated or trained to get a job," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Logan said she would work hard to fulfill the obligation of community colleges 
to serve the "underclass" with literacy and up-to-date vocational educational 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
Ducheny, 37, is equally known throughout the Southeast San Diego area for 
advocacy in support of minorities. 
</P>
<P>
A Pomona College graduate and practicing attorney, Ducheny and her husband, Al, 
have lobbied for community interests in Barrio Logan and Southeast San Diego on 
a variety of City Council and Port of San Diego issues. Ducheny would follow 
that pattern as a trustee, lobbying for more literacy and vocational education 
programs, for better academic preparation under the transfer agreement programs 
and for better libraries. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a board that can do a lot more, especially with City College 
(downtown) and at the Educational Cultural Complex (in Southeast San Diego) to 
get more people the education that they need," Ducheny said. She would push for 
more partnerships with both the private sector and public agencies, and to 
boost counseling efforts.

BENEFACTOR'S $275,000 LOAN FUNDED FLORES' TELEVISION ADS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: TRAILING BADLY IN THE RACE FOR SECRETARY OF STATE, JOAN MILKE FLORES 
TURNED TO A WEALTHY SAN PEDRO FRIEND FOR FINANCIAL HELP. HER AGGRESSIVE AD 
CAMPAIGN HAS NARROWED THE GAP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Trailing badly in the polls and eager to begin her television advertising 
campaign, Republican secretary of state candidate Joan Milke Flores faced a 
major obstacle several weeks ago: She needed more money. 
</P>
<P>
Fund raising was going well, but not well enough. Flores, in her first bid for 
statewide office, had tens of thousands of dollars in advance advertising bills 
to pay before stations would air her 30-second spots. 
</P>
<P>
Flores needed a benefactor, and so she turned to her loyal base of support in 
San Pedro, her home and one of several communities she has represented on the 
Los Angeles City Council since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Ernest (Tom) Papadakis, a wealthy friend and longtime political supporter who 
heads one of the community's most prominent families, loaned Flores $275,000 on 
Oct. 1, according to her financial disclosure statement filed this week. An 
aggressive Flores television campaign took to the airwaves the following day. 
</P>
<P>
Although she still trails Democratic incumbent March Fong Eu in the polls as 
Election Day approaches, Flores has narrowed the gap, in large part, her 
campaign says, because of the television ads. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate borrowing money," Flores said in an interview. "The only bill I really 
have is for my house, and even that I try to pay extra payments. . . . But we 
assessed the situation and decided we had to do television, and when it looked 
like we were falling short of our (fund-raising) mark, I hated to do it, but we 
felt we had to borrow the money." 
</P>
<P>
Papadakis owns Anchor Liquors Corp., a chain of liquor stores based in San 
Pedro, and serves as chairman of Flores' statewide campaign committee. His son, 
John, owns the Papadakis Taverna in San Pedro, and another son, Nick, runs a 
San Pedro real estate investment business. 
</P>
<P>
Papadakis, 66, works in San Pedro but has lived in Rancho Palos Verdes since 
1962. The family also owns various properties in San Pedro, and Angie 
Papadakis, his wife of 44 years, has served on the state Board of Education and 
is currently a member of the California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief telephone interview, Tom Papadakis had little to say about his loan 
to Flores, except that she was deserving of any assistance he could give her. 
</P>
<P>
"In this day and age, when you find a politician of that caliber, I think you 
should do something about it," said Papadakis, who, with his wife, has also 
contributed $2,000 to the Flores campaign. "She is an outstanding person, and I 
have a lot of faith in her." 
</P>
<P>
Papadakis met Flores when she worked as an aide to her predecessor on the City 
Council, John Gibson. When Flores ran for council in 1981, Papadakis served on 
her first campaign committee and joined several other supporters in loaning her 
$14,000 in the final weeks of a hard-fought contest. Flores says the loan was 
crucial to her eventual victory. 
</P>
<P>
Flores describes Papadakis as a friend, an adviser and a "political animal" who 
prefers to operate outside the public eye. He has served on the board of the 
San Pedro Peninsula Hospital and has been active in the San Pedro Boys Club, 
but his wife is far more visible in the community. Angie Papadakis is a 
professional speaker, owns her own public relations agency and is an 
accomplished humorist. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom has always been content being a little bit behind the scenes," Flores 
said. 
</P>
<P>
During the telephone interview, Tom Papadakis would not discuss the details of 
his business or financial dealings, saying they were "a private matter" and had 
nothing to do with his loan to Flores. Flores said Papadakis, a Democrat, has 
never asked for any special favors in the past, and she said the loan would not 
entitle him to any in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel any obligation except to pay the money back," Flores said. The 
loan has a 12% interest rate and is due in one year. 
</P>
<P>
With the loan, Flores can continue her television advertising through Election 
Day, including a new hard-hitting spot that accuses Eu of waiving fines against 
politically connected companies and special interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
As of Oct. 21, Flores had spent $410,000 on her television campaign, whereas Eu 
had spent $163,000. 
</P>
<P>
The loan, however, has had a political price. In her harshest attack of the 
race, Eu this week accused Flores of deliberately concealing the loan by filing 
her financial disclosure statement several days late. In letters to the state 
Department of Justice and to the Fair Political Practices Commission, Eu's 
campaign demanded that criminal or civil charges be filed against Flores. 
</P>
<P>
Eu has also criticized Flores for violating court-overturned restrictions in 
Proposition 73, which limited contributions and barred large personal loans 
such as the one from Papadakis. Eu has pledged to adhere to the restrictions, 
even though a judge ruled in September that they are unconstitutional and no 
longer applied to this election. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the loan, Joan Flores might have had to run on even terms" with Eu, 
said Leo McElroy, Eu's campaign consultant. "We feel (Proposition 73) is a 
mandate from the voters, and somebody ought to honor that."

HEALTH DEPARTMENT STARTS ANNUAL FLU SHOT PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Low-cost flu shots will be available beginning today and through the winter for 
seniors and at-risk risk children and adults at seven public health centers. 
</P>
<P>
The flu immunizations as well as pneumococcal pneumonia and tetanus-diphtheria 
vaccines are $2 each. 
</P>
<P>
But the fee may be waived if a person certifies an inability to pay, County 
Health Officer Donald Ramras said. 
</P>
<P>
The flu vaccine will be given to people 55 years and older; children 6 months 
to 18 years on long-term aspirin therapy; people who are HIV positive, and 
children and adults with chronic heart or lung conditions, kidney or metabolic 
diseases, anemia, or an impaired immune system. People who live or work closely 
with the at-risk groups also may receive the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
Children will receive the flu vaccine only by appointment because a more 
detailed medical history is required and vaccine dosages differ from those 
given adults, Ramras said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the flu vaccine must be taken yearly to be effective, the pneumonia 
vaccine is administered once in a lifetime, he said. It is recommended for 
person 65 years and older and adults with a long-term illness or chronic health 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
The vaccines are available at the East San Diego, El Cajon, Escondido, North 
San Diego, Oceanside, South Bay and Vista Public Health Centers. South County 
residents may call the 24-hour, flu information line at 236-2350. North County 
residents may call 940-1462.

HOTEL ON MARINELAND SITE WILL ADD TO TRAFFIC, POLLUTE AIR, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY DIZON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Air quality will be worsened and traffic at major intersections on the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula will be significantly increased by a proposed 495-room hotel 
on the old Marineland site in Rancho Palos Verdes, according to a report 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The draft environmental impact report on the Long Point Development listed 
these as the most significant drawbacks to The Monaghan Co.'s proposal to build 
the resort hotel and a nine-hole golf course. 
</P>
<P>
A public hearing will be held Dec. 11 on the report, which was written for the 
city by Myra Frank &amp; Associates of Los Angeles. After reviewing public 
comments, the city will make a decision on the project by the middle of 
February, said Carolynn Petru, a senior city planner. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the increased traffic and the use of electricity and natural 
gas to operate the hotel will result in air pollution exceeding South Coast Air 
Quality Management District limits for the area. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the report said, peak-hour traffic at three intersections -- Palos Verdes 
Drives North and West in Palos Verdes Estates, Hawthorne Boulevard and Palos 
Verdes Drive North in Rolling Hills Estates and Hawthorne Boulevard in Rancho 
Palos Verdes -- will increase greatly during and after construction of the 
hotel. The report did not estimate how much traffic will increase. 
</P>
<P>
To alleviate the congestion, the report suggested adding turn lanes and through 
streets to widen the intersections, with Monaghan paying the cost. 
</P>
<P>
However, Joan Hanley, director of public affairs for Monaghan, said the company 
may have problems getting the peninsula cities to approve the street 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way Mr. Monaghan can improve the traffic in the cities of Rolling 
Hills Estates and Palos Verdes Estates," Hanley said. "The people would tell 
him they don't want (the changes). They like the streets the way they are . . . 
and want them to stay rural." 
</P>
<P>
At the City Council's request, the report, which normally would deal only with 
environmental issues, also briefly looks at the revenues the project would 
bring to Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
"The project is expected to result in a beneficial financial effect," the 
report said, with the city gaining $25.4 million in economic activity over a 
20-year period. About $20 million of that would come in bed taxes, said Bob 
Benard, city director of environmental services. 
</P>
<P>
The 175-page report, commissioned in May, 1988, listed alternatives to the 
proposed hotel, ranging from building no project to building it somewhere else. 
It also looked at the possibility of reducing the number of hotel rooms to 350 
or of adding 45 units of single-family housing to the 495-room hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Building a marine research facility on the site was also suggested, because it 
would generate 70% less traffic than the hotel, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of the report are available for public review at City Hall.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EDISON TO FIGHT NOISE COMPLAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California Edison, which has been a source of aggravation for 
homeowners near its Redondo Beach generating station over the last two years, 
pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges that the utility violated the city's 
noise ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach City Prosecutor John Slawson filed the charges against the 
utility last month, accusing Edison of allowing the noise level at the plant to 
exceed the city limit at least seven times during the month of September. 
</P>
<P>
The charges carry a maximum penalty of $3,485. 
</P>
<P>
Edison lawyer Brad Brian told South Bay Municipal Court Judge Sandra Thompson 
that the utility would challenge the validity of the city's ordinance in a 
pretrial hearing set for Dec. 17. The last time the city prosecuted Edison for 
allegedly making too much noise, the city lost, partly because the court 
determined that the city's noise measurements did not adequately distinguish 
the sounds generated by the plant from other sources of noise. 
</P>
<P>
Slawson, however, has said that he is confident this time that sound 
measurements were carried out correctly. 
</P>
<P>
Residents have complained for years about plant noise. Richard Gould, a 
neighbor and frequent critic of the station, recently said the constant, 
low-pitched hum emanating from the Edison plant "is like you have a dishwasher 
on your patio running all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Edison officials, however, say they are installing $2.5 million worth of 
acoustic housings, panels and other devices around loud equipment to mute the 
noise.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOSPITAL BOARD MEMBERS NAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has canceled Tuesday's election for 
the South Bay Hospital District Board and appointed Ken Johnson and Patricia 
Allen Dreizler to seats on the board. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a current member of the board who was running for reelection, and 
Dreizler, who was seeking election, were appointed after the third candidate 
for the two seats withdrew from the race in August. 
</P>
<P>
Under those circumstances, supervisors can cancel an election and fill seats by 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
The district provides money for public health programs in Manhattan Beach, 
Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Fruin, an attorney who served on the board from 1980 through 1984, 
declined Tuesday to say why he changed his mind about the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who is community services director of the county Beaches and Harbors 
Department, and Dreizler, who retired last year as Redondo Beach community 
resources director, will be sworn in Dec. 6.

EVIL TROJAN HORSE ON THE BALLOT; 
</P>
<P>
AVOID 136 -- THE PROPOSITION FOR MINORITY RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sleeper on the California ballot this year is Proposition 136, an insidious 
initiative that takes aim at some of the basic assumptions of modern democratic 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Although The Times already has opposed Proposition 136, this cynical measure 
merits a second warning. If one were to draft legislation designed to subvert 
majority rule while rendering representative government ineffective, it would 
be difficult to improve on Proposition 136 as the vehicle. Neither politicians 
nor voters escape its suspicion. Even the current election law is mistrusted, 
because proponents have built in a provision that could have voters undoing 
some of the things they are voting on elsewhere on the same ballot. 
</P>
<P>
But the fact that Proposition 136 has even the opportunity to pass is an 
eloquent statement in support of majority rule: We have enough faith in the 
process of democracy that we will allow even a bad idea like this one a chance 
of passing, if only the majority will approve. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some ways Proposition 136 would conspire to uproot democracy: The 
budget process is a mess as it is, but this would require that all tax bills -- 
even those that would not increase net state revenue -- pass the Legislature by 
a two-thirds vote. Thus, naysayers would be empowered, by giving only a small 
portion of the voters veto power over decisions. Ballot measures calling for 
increases in special taxes also would be subject to the two-thirds test. Local 
governments would find their general tax increases subject to approval by a 
majority of voters, while increases for specifics would have to be approved by 
two-thirds. Ballot initiatives for transportation, such as Measure M in Orange 
County and Measure C in Los Angeles County were mercifully spared the tyranny 
of the minority that Proposition 136 champions. So were special taxes or 
personal property taxes that might be levied in response to natural disasters 
or emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
But this proposition is heir to a 12-year-old tax revolt that has remarkable 
staying power. It's unlikely the new unsilent minority that Proposition 136 
spawns would rest easily until it had firmly established the outrageous 
principle that people and their elected representatives are not to be trusted 
with majority decisions on tax matters. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, Proposition 136's so-called "poison pill" provisions could have the 
effect of wiping out three other measures on the ballot: Propositions 129, 133 
and 134. 
</P>
<P>
And it's a sign of how insane this election season has become -- a time when 
even the consummate insiders are running as outsiders -- that California voters 
are being seriously asked to cast their vote against the very workings of a 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
In its finest hours, the American political tradition has reserved a place of 
respect for minority views. But this fraudulent effort at reform simply would 
replace the majority will outright with that of a minority, extending an open 
invitation to special-interest groups to throw a monkey wrench into government. 
It has taken shameless audacity to ask all that of a simple majority of the 
state's voters.

Anyone who has ever desired the existence of sea monsters (and a keen desire

Oct. 23. The appearance of this fantastic creature conveys the hopeful news 
that our weary old world still has a few mysteries up its sleeve. I am 
considerably bucked up.

PRESIDENT'S VETO OF CIVIL RIGHTS BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am very upset and offended by the veto of the 1990 Civil Rights Act by 
President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
I will never understand how delaying such an important issue for minorities and 
women is in their interest. 
</P>
<P>
He stated he feared hiring quotas when it is clear that the bill didn't demand 
any. What is the truth? 
</P>
<P>
I believe the truth lies in Louisiana, after the racist voting there caused 
great political concerns. Bush just wimped out and sold the minorities and 
women down the river. Instead of showing the David Dukes of this country that 
the White House could not be intimidated, his veto has given support to their 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
I had forgiven Bush for the Willie Horton political ads. But now I'm outraged 
at his veto. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, read my lips: Your veto, as far as I'm concerned, is just as 
racist as your Horton ads.

U.S.-CHINA TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's trade surplus with the U.S. will shoot up to as high as $10 billion 
this year, but the Bush Administration continues to grant it the 
most-favored-nation status. Even if this is not ridiculous, this will certainly 
hold the seed of new friction in Washington-Beijing relations. 
</P>
<P>
It is true the U.S. needs China's help during the Persian Gulf crisis, but the 
help should be motivated by the love of peace, not the love of money. 
</P>
<P>
If Saddam Hussein had no Scud and Silkworm missiles, what do people need to 
fear of him? Remember: Russia and China were the suppliers of these weapons. 
Have Russia and China shown a whit of regret for arming Saddam Hussein? If not, 
neither of them are qualified to be most-favored nations of the U.S.

PRICE GIVES $1.8 MILLION FOR PUBLIC INTEREST CHAIR AT USD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego financier and retailer Sol Price announced Wednesday a $1.8-million 
gift to the University of San Diego to support a permanent professorial chair 
in public interest law intended to make state government regulatory agencies 
more accountable to the public. 
</P>
<P>
The funds will pay for a full-time faculty member at the USD Center of Public 
Interest Law to train students to advocate the interests of under-represented 
Californians in state courts, in the Legislature and in dealings with the more 
than 60 state agencies that regulate business, the environment, law, medicine 
and trade. 
</P>
<P>
The USD center was established in 1980 by USD law professor Robert Fellmeth, an 
original member of public watchdog Ralph Nader's "Nader's Raiders." The center 
has sponsored legislation, initiated lawsuits and carried out detailed studies 
on a variety of consumer-interest issues. 
</P>
<P>
The work has included studies of the state's system of disciplining doctors and 
lawyers, of the way that the Lottery Commission used its money for advertising, 
and of the way state policies address child abuse and child welfare. 
</P>
<P>
"I strongly feel that, as government gets more complex, you need enthusiastic 
students to keep throwing light on the process," Price said in announcing his 
gift. The USD center, with 13 staff members, oversees 50 student interns who 
first study regulatory agencies and the law, and then carry out advocacy 
projects. Center graduates now include city attorneys specializing in consumer 
fraud in Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Diego, as well as the staff counsels 
to state legislative judiciary committees and the director of a consumer-based 
network monitoring utilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important that someone challenge the system," Price said. "State agencies 
start out protecting the public, but soon industry ends up owning the board or 
commission." 
</P>
<P>
Price, an attorney by training and longtime Democratic Party activist, founded 
the Price Club wholesale warehouse chain in 1976, which last year had revenues 
of more than $5 billion. Based on revenue, Price Club is the largest San 
Diego-based business and more than twice the size of San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric Co., the second largest. 
</P>
<P>
Price and his wife, Helen, established the Price Family Charitable Trust, which 
contributed $1 million to the San Diego Hospice in honor of grandson Aaron 
Price. He also gave $2 million to UCSD for its student center named after his 
family.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE PERSIAN GULF; 
</P>
<P>
OUR ALLIES, WITH FAR MORE EXPERIENCE AS ARABISTS, MAY HAVE REASON TO INSIST ON 
BUSH'S INITIAL GOAL, COLLECTIVE SECURITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARTHUR SCHLESINGER JR., Arthur Schlesinger Jr. is a historian and educator, 
currently at City University of New York, who served as a special assistant to 
Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.Are We Ready to Go It Alone? 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraq is confronting Americans with a fateful choice: negotiation or war. And, 
if President Bush finds no alternative to war, Americans face another fateful 
choice: Does the United States go to war only if its allies agree or, if they 
won't agree, does the United States go to war on its own? 
</P>
<P>
The current indication is that the enthusiasm of America's allies for war in 
the Persian Gulf is restrained. The Bush Administration finds itself trapped in 
a paradox -- the very "new world order" that U.S. military intervention would 
be intended to promote constrains the United States from any military 
intervention at all. Which, then, should the United States choose? To stay in 
concert with allies or to go it alone? 
</P>
<P>
The oldest American tradition is freedom of national action. George Washington 
told his countrymen that "our true policy" was "to steer clear of permanent 
alliances." Thomas Jefferson warned against "entangling alliances." With the 
infant Republic shielded from world power struggles by two great oceans, 
isolationism was the American way in foreign affairs in the century after 1815. 
</P>
<P>
With the steamship, the telegraph and the airplane, the planet began to shrink. 
When America could no longer escape the great world, Woodrow Wilson proposed a 
stirring new vision -- U.S. participation in collective maintenance of 
international order, "not organized rivalries, but an organized common peace." 
Congress rejected Wilson's League of Nations and the country relapsed into 
traditional unilateralism, until German and Japanese aggression woke the 
Republic from its isolationist slumbers. The Grand Alliance won the war. 
Wilson's League was reborn as the United Nations. The onset of the Cold War 
produced NATO, and the United States reigned as superpower. America no longer 
steered clear of entangling alliances. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Cold War has ended. The United States is being out-produced by Germany 
and Japan, and no longer reigns supreme in the Western alliance. It is no 
longer capable of attaining great objectives all by itself. The United Nations, 
no longer paralyzed by the Cold War, at last appears in a position to redeem 
its promise and promote an organized common peace. Circumstances thus argue for 
multilateral action. 
</P>
<P>
When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, President Bush unfurled the standard of 
collective security, secured U.N. support for an economic embargo, assembled a 
coalition that included Arab states, and enlisted the cooperation of the Soviet 
Union. In terms almost Wilsonian, he declared the U.S. objective to be the 
creation of a new world order. 
</P>
<P>
If that strategy fails, and Hussein does not withdraw peacefully from Kuwait, 
it is widely assumed that the next step would be war. 
</P>
<P>
It may be that our allies would accept war in the gulf so long as Americans do 
the fighting. But in that case, would Americans support a protracted war in 
which they take the casualties while other nations cheer from the sidelines? 
</P>
<P>
And, if the allies think war a poor idea, should the United States revert to 
unilateralism and go to war on its own? 
</P>
<P>
Can we be so sure that we know better than anyone else how to handle the Middle 
East? 
</P>
<P>
Americans can hardly claim infallibility when it comes to that mysterious part 
of the world. The British and French have had far more operational experience 
in the Middle East and a far stronger scholarly tradition on Arab and Islamic 
questions. The State Department has no Middle Eastern experts comparable to its 
Soviet experts in years past. We simply don't know the territory -- which is 
why we get so many things wrong. After building up Saddam Hussein, we now call 
him another Hitler. After fulminating against Hafez Assad of Syria, we now 
clasp him to our bosom. Why are we so certain that Washington knows the best 
course today? If we rush ahead against our allies' best judgment, they will 
distance themselves from the result. Indeed, we may find ourselves in a 
position where they will insist on being heard. 
</P>
<P>
America is hustling other countries to subsidize the military deployment. But 
economic dependence reduces political independence. Other nations will not 
subsidize U.S. policy without having a say in the use of the subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
"There can be no burden-sharing without power-sharing," an Italian commentator 
recently warned. 
</P>
<P>
If the American objective is a new world order, should not the American 
government abandon any thoughts of unilateral action and remain dedicated to 
playing by the rules of collective security? 
</P>
<P>
Congress and the President had better ponder these questions before the 
Republic plunges down the dark and bloody path.

An 18-year-old Mira Mesa night school student was shot to death during a fight 
with a classmate near Mason Elementary School in the 10000 block of Arrow Rock 
Avenue, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Maru Angelo Sharpe of San Diego was dead on arrival shortly after 8:30 p.m. 
Tuesday at Sharp Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, the county coroner's office 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He had been shot once in the chest with a small-caliber handgun, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old youth was arrested in connection with the shooting and booked 
into Juvenile Hall on a murder charge, according to Lt. Dan Berglund of the 
homicide division. The teen-ager came home after the shooting, told his mother 
he had been in a fight and he thought he had shot someone, and she called 
police, Berglund said. 
</P>
<P>
Sharpe and two male students and one female student had gone to dinner after 
class at the adult school of Mira Mesa High let out about 7:30 p.m. They were 
dropping off the girl at Mason Elementary School near her home, Berglund said. 
When Sharpe continued talking to the girl, the driver of the car became 
irritated at having to wait, and words were exchanged between the two, Berglund 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A fist fight broke out, and Sharpe beat up the teen-ager, who then threatened 
to kill Sharpe and drove away, Berglund said. Sharpe, the girl and the other 
male classmate walked across the street and continued their conversation until 
the suspect returned about 15 minutes later and shot Sharpe once in the chest, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sharpe lived with his father, Richard, in the 9000 block of Sawtooth Way in San 
Diego.

Costumed bank employees in Rancho Bernardo were taken by surprise when a masked 
man turned out to be a robber and not someone dressed for Halloween, police 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A number of bank employees wore costumes Wednesday morning to mark Halloween, 
and a masked bandit raised no eyebrows when he ran into the Great Western Bank 
in the 16000 block of Bernardo Center Drive, San Diego Police spokesman Bill 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
When the man, dressed in a gray sweat suit and gray ski mask, asked a teller 
for money, she replied: "You're kidding, right?" 
</P>
<P>
Tellers, however, quickly realized he was a real robber when he waved a 
blue-steel semi-automatic pistol. "She (the teller) saw the pistol and knew he 
meant business," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The robber ordered the three customers in the bank to lie on the floor. Then he 
told two tellers to fill a backpack with money. He left the bank in less than 
two minutes, carrying $3,200, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Halloween came a little early to Great Western Bank," Robinson said.

Two alien smugglers who sheared the head of an illegal migrant after a dispute 
over payment were sentenced Wednesday to the time they had already spent in 
jail and handed over to federal immigration officials. 
</P>
<P>
Ramiro Varcenas Monticinas, 30, and Gerardo Perez Ortiz, 22, had pleaded guilty 
to assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge Nicholas Kasimatis sentenced them to the 63 days they 
had already spent in jail and placed them three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
Javier Garcia Robles, 20, of Juarez, Mexico, had testified Oct. 2 that 
Monticinas sheared his head Sept. 20 after Ortiz gave him the shears. 
</P>
<P>
Robles said Monticinas demanded to be paid for smuggling him across the border, 
but Robles told him that he had promised another smuggler he would work off the 
debt. Monticinas became angry and threatened him at knifepoint, Robles said. 
</P>
<P>
Robles escaped from the drop house for illegal migrants at 42nd and Market 
Streets, where the incident took place, and called police, who arrested the 
pair shortly afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
There were a number of other incidents of illegal migrants having their heads 
sheared in September, but attorney Kerry Steigerwalt, who represented Ortiz, 
claimed the two men were not responsible for any of those incidents.

Five rare birds were stolen from the San Diego Zoo in the third such animal 
theft in 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
Three golden conures and two hyacinth macaws, both parrot species, were taken 
from the zoo's avian propagation center, said Jeff Jouett, a zoo spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The birds, native to the Amazon River rain forests in Brazil, all were hatched 
at the zoo in the past year. They are worth more than $20,000, Jouett said. 
</P>
<P>
A keeper arriving for work discovered the birds missing. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police investigators found parts of a lock that had been severed with 
bolt cutters to gain access to a holding cage. 
</P>
<P>
Jouett said zoo security patrols will be increased and locks will be changed at 
animal enclosures throughout the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1989, two birds of prey were stolen in separate thefts. A rare African 
milky owl and an African bateleur eagle were taken. 
</P>
<P>
The birds lost in the earlier thefts have not been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, zoo officials said, they are concerned about the health of the 
stolen birds, particularly one of the macaws that had not been fully weened. 
That bird requires a special diet for the next several weeks.

JACK SMITH: NO SUBSTITUTIONS: WHAT'S ON THE MENU IS WHAT YOU GET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frustration over inflexible restaurant menus is not an uncommon phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
Several readers write of experiences similar to that of Brant de Pierre, who 
wrote recently of being unable to get white toast with the Late Riser special 
at his golf club cafe. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Healy of Newport Beach suggests a reason why the cafe insisted on serving a 
roll, rather than toast. "Rolls are an item that are traditionally served at 
dinner, and I would bet that they are left over from the night before. So the 
manager gets rid of them on a special priced 'loss leader' item. The white 
toast is used for those who are not ordering the special and are paying more 
for breakfast, which is the highest profit meal of the day for the 
restaurateur." 
</P>
<P>
Barry Jensen of Porterville recalls an experience he had in a restaurant at the 
National Airport in Washington, D.C. Jensen ordered the No. 2 special "without 
coffee." The waitress served the meal, without coffee, and left the check. When 
he looked at the check, Jensen found that it had been inflated about 35%. 
</P>
<P>
He asked the waitress why that was. She said, "You didn't have coffee." 
</P>
<P>
He said, "But I had the No. 2 special." 
</P>
<P>
The waitress explained that since the special included coffee, and he didn't 
have coffee, he didn't have the special. 
</P>
<P>
The manager was called. He explained that Jensen didn't have coffee, so he 
didn't have the special; he had a la carte, which was more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Jensen finally prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Robin writes of a surreal experience he had when he tried to buy eight 
assorted doughnuts at a doughnut shop in South Pasadena at about 1:30 a.m. The 
counterman told him doughnuts were on sale, 12 for $1. Robin said he only 
wanted eight. The counterman said he couldn't sell him eight, since they were 
on sale 12 for $1. Robin insisted. The counterman turned to the only other 
customer in the shop. That customer refused to be waited on until Robin had 
been served. The counterman was adamant. Finally Robin and the other customer 
bought a dozen doughnuts and divided them between them. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Hill of Encinitas recalls trying to get a cheeseburger and a malt in a 
roadside restaurant. He was told he couldn't have a malt. He pointed out a malt 
blender on the counter and asked why not. "We don't serve malts on Sunday," he 
was told. 
</P>
<P>
John Cornell of San Marino recalls an incident in World War II when he was a 
naval gunnery officer aboard a merchant ship. The ship's galley often served 
hash and one egg for breakfast. A seaman rejected the egg, but was told he 
would take hash and an egg or nothing. The impasse finally was settled at a 
captain's mast, but Cornell forgets how it turned out. 
</P>
<P>
Several readers have recalled what they regard as a classic in the genre: a 
confrontation between Jack Nicholson and a waitress in "Five Easy Pieces." 
Writes Don Johnson (not the actor): "Jack was great. The waitress was great. 
Not slapstick stuff. Just grim, tragic irony, bitter reality." Jan Huglin 
suggested that I obtain a video of the movie and see that scene. I have done 
so. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicholson goes into a roadside restaurant and a waitress with a seasoned 
face and manner comes up to take his order. The dialogue (by screenwriter 
Adrien Joyce) goes like this: 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like a plain omelet, no potatoes, tomatoes instead, a cup of coffee and 
wheat toast." 
</P>
<P>
"No substitutions." 
</P>
<P>
"Whatdya mean? You don't have any tomatoes?" 
</P>
<P>
"Only what's on the menu. You can have the No. 2. Plain omelet, comes with 
cottage fries and a roll." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson tries various ploys to get what he wants, but the waitress blocks 
him, until finally Nicholson tries a desperate strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll make it as easy as I can. I'd like an omelet, plain, a chicken salad 
sandwich on toast, no mayonnaise, no butter, no lettuce, with a cup of coffee." 
</P>
<P>
"No. 2 chicken salad sandwich. Hold the butter, lettuce and mayonnaise, with a 
cup of coffee. Anything else?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes. Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, bring me 
a check for the chicken salad and you haven't broken any rules." 
</P>
<P>
"You want me to hold the chicken, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
"I want you to hold it between your knees." 
</P>
<P>
The scene ends with Nicholson yanking the cloth off the table and shattering 
the dishes on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
As Johnson suggests, there is an undercurrent of cruelty in this exchange. The 
waitress has a thankless job. She is only trying to please the customer and 
stick to the restaurant's inflexible rules. One sympathizes with Nicholson's 
frustration, but his resolution of the conflict is brutal. It's a brutal movie. 
(The writing is good throughout.) 
</P>
<P>
Good manners and sympathy for a poor overworked waitress will keep most of us 
from engaging in such violence. 
</P>
<P>
Where Nicholson made his mistake, I think, was in ordering tomatoes instead of 
potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
That's going too far.

ART BUCHWALD: NO ACCOUNTING FOR VOTING RECORD

<TEXT>
<P>
This is the last week for political managers to coach their candidates. It's 
tough for the incumbents to figure out what to say at the end of the campaign, 
particularly when it comes to budget legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, Senator, let's go over it again. If they ask you, you tell them that you 
don't agree with the budget bill, but you had to vote for it because it's the 
best deal you could get from the cutthroat Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"Then you should add: 'It's good to get away from Washington and talk to real 
people.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Right, Harvey. How do I feel about the President?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sick. You can't support the President on the budget because he went back on 
his promise not to raise taxes, even if he is the leader of the party of no new 
taxes." 
</P>
<P>
"I can remember that, Harvey. Why did I vote for the budget in the first 
place?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because it's the only one we could live with under the circumstances, and 
something that the liberals will have to take responsibility for when they lead 
us into a recession." 
</P>
<P>
"Let me ask you this, Harvey. Was the bill too tough on the rich, not tough 
enough or just right?" 
</P>
<P>
"Too tough. The Democrats are always trying to sock it to the rich because they 
have more money than anyone else. But you have to say in your speeches that 
once they tax the rich, the opposition will want to tax the middle class and 
then the poor, and then the football fans. Your campaign must portray the rich 
as being just like everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
"Is it too late to put that on bumper stickers?" 
</P>
<P>
Harvey said, "Our polls indicate that no one likes the budget and the voter is 
blaming Congress for the mess we're in. We have got to put the blame on the 
ones who are really at fault." 
</P>
<P>
"Who is that, Harvey?" 
</P>
<P>
"The abortionists are responsible for the budget mess." 
</P>
<P>
"The abortionists!" 
</P>
<P>
"Why not? Better them than us." 
</P>
<P>
"The voters should respect me for that." 
</P>
<P>
"Senator, I want you to tell the people how much belt-tightening we have to do 
to get our house in order. This means finding capital gains tax breaks for the 
guy in the street who wants to invest in America." 
</P>
<P>
"Does that get votes?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, but it gets contributions from those who would like the capital gains tax 
breaks." 
</P>
<P>
"Why can't I say that the President wants the same things as I do?" 
</P>
<P>
"You can, but I wish you wouldn't. Bush's popularity is sinking in the polls. 
There is no reason for you to bail him out at this stage." 
</P>
<P>
"Harvey, am I for or against the excise taxes on smoking that I voted in favor 
of?" 
</P>
<P>
"Tell the electorate that on odd days you will be for them, and on even days 
you will be against them. The smokers have vowed to defeat those who voted for 
the tax." 
</P>
<P>
"They could be a problem, particularly if they are also joined by senior 
citizens who have promised to bury those members of Congress who've taxed their 
alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
"Senator, we're in the home stretch, and the people are fed up with everything. 
Our job is to make sure they understand that, although you voted for all the 
budget reforms, you don't believe in them any more than President Bush does 
when he's speaking at a Republican fund-raiser."

LEGAL VIEW: DAMAGE CONTROL FOR CAR ACCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN, Klein, an attorney and assistant to the publisher of The 
Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Car accidents. They can and do happen to anybody and everybody. One "happened" 
to me earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, many people, when they get in a noninjury fender-bender, don't have 
my kind of luck. I was on the Hollywood Freeway and slammed into the rear of a 
shiny new BMW. The driver was an undercover police officer. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if you have to run into somebody, at least a cop knows about 
traffic reports and things like that. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers and insurance adjusters always advise that the first thing you should 
do -- after you've stopped the car and made sure you can walk -- is to get the 
names and addresses of the drivers and witnesses, and the relevant insurance 
information. 
</P>
<P>
That's fine in theory, but with angry drivers on the freeway yelling at us to 
get out of the way, the first thing we did was move the cars to the side of the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
And all my expensive legal training didn't really help much: I was still in 
shock. I let the driver behind me leave without getting her name or address, 
and didn't seek out other witnesses. Fortunately, no one was seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
What should you do if you find yourself in similar unhappy circumstances, aside 
from just exchanging driver's license numbers and insurance policies? The best 
source for legal information on this subject is the four-volume state Vehicle 
Code, but that doesn't fit in your glove compartment. 
</P>
<P>
Some insurance companies include guidelines about what to do and what to say on 
the forms showing you have insurance that you must have in your car. Reach out 
and read them before you get yourself into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Another source of information is the State Bar of California, which summarizes 
the rules of the road in a free pamphlet called, "What Should I Do If I Have an 
Auto Accident?" And it will fit in your glove compartment. 
</P>
<P>
(Unfortunately, the pamphlet is out of print right now; however, the state bar 
is revising it and it will be available again in a few months. It's available 
in English, Spanish and Chinese.) 
</P>
<P>
The pamphlet explains that you are required by law to stop whenever you are 
involved in an accident, whether you hit a pedestrian, another car or a brick 
wall. If you hit an unattended car, you are required to leave a note on the 
car's windshield. 
</P>
<P>
If the accident involves damage of more than $500 or if someone is injured or 
killed, you must file a written report. You can get the form from the DMV. 
</P>
<P>
In my case, even though there were no injuries, we had to wait for the Highway 
Patrol to complete a report since the other driver was an on-duty police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
Don't talk much about the accident at the scene. You may say something you 
regret later -- something that is quoted back to you in cross-examination 
during a personal injury lawsuit. You should be courteous, but you need not be 
apologetic. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as possible, contact your insurance agent and have him or her handle 
the negotiations with the other driver and his insurance company.

YOUR WHEELS: CURIOSITY IDLING HIGH OVER TUNEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Question: I have a 1988 Mazda, which I recently took in for a tuneup. All the 
mechanic did was change my spark plugs and check the timing. He told me that he 
could not do anything with the carburetor unless I wanted to pay more for him 
to crack open the seal. Did I get ripped off or is the mechanic being honest? 
-- M.M. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Whether you were ripped off depends on how much you paid for your 
tuneup, but the mechanic was correct that the carburetor adjustment screws are 
sealed. 
</P>
<P>
You can easily see why garages that advertise so-called bargain tuneups for $40 
or $50 are raking in the dough. New cars virtually have nothing to tune up, 
save for a spark plug change and a possible timing adjustment or valve 
adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
The carburetor on your Mazda and most new cars have adjustment screws that are 
sealed at the factory. In most cases, it is illegal for a mechanic to attempt 
to break open these seals to change the settings. In many other cases, fuel 
injection systems are controlled by computers that cannot be adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, a car would need a carburetor adjustment new spark plugs, 
points, condenser and a rotor every 12,000 miles. But these are the days of 
computer-controlled engines. There are no more rotors or condensers. 
</P>
<P>
If you think that means your car is maintenance-free, however, you are 
mistaken. Not surprisingly, the computers that now control the ignition and 
fuel systems on cars break on occasion. And when that happens, you can be 
looking at repairs bills that easily jump over $500. Then you'll wish you had 
only a pair of points to replace. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The oil pressure indicator, battery charger indicator, gasoline gauge and 
clock on my 1982 Datsun King Cab have gone on the blink. Where is the problem? 
-- U.K.W. 
</P>
<P>
A: You have probably tried to determine whether there is a blown fuse in the 
fuse panel and found no problem there. But in this case, your Datsun has a 
surprise for you. 
</P>
<P>
There is another fuse behind the dashboard, called an in-line fuse. It's 
probably blown, which accounts for all the instruments malfunctioning. 
</P>
<P>
Fuses are designed to prevent overloaded circuits from damaging your car's 
electrical system. Fuses usually blow for a reason. Once you find the blown 
fuse and replace it, the new one could very well blow out too. 
</P>
<P>
That makes the ultimate repair a more challenging problem. You may have to 
selectively disconnect the various sensors to see which one is creating the 
electrical overload. At some point, you may need a good electrical mechanic to 
track down the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there any simple way to test that Mobil One was actually used in an oil 
change, rather than a cheaper oil? -- J.R. 
</P>
<P>
A: A petroleum lab could easily tell, but a consumer can not determine that by 
look, feel or smell. A lab would run a "pour point" test on the oil to 
determine its low temperature properties, which are notably better with a 
synthetic like Mobil One than with a mineral-based oil. 
</P>
<P>
You could do a crude test of your own by putting a sample of the oil in the 
freezer. A mineral oil would be very thick at below freezing but Mobil One 
should be reasonably fluid. But wouldn't it be easier to just find a mechanic 
you trust?

Stikkitty, a hard rock band from Fullerton, has won the $20,000 first prize in 
an international contest for unsigned bands that was decided Sunday with a live 
"battle of the bands" in Tokyo. The 16 finalists, representing 15 countries, 
were alloted six minutes each to play for a panel of judges in the "Band 
Explosion" festival at the Budokan Theatre, Stikkitty's manager, Jeff Gurzi, 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The panel included Bon Jovi's producer, Bruce Fairbairn, as well as David Paich 
and Steve Lukather of Toto and Spike, singer for the British band London 
Quireboys. The victory brings Stikkitty's winnings for the contest to $30,000 
(the band won $10,000 and a free recording session with a major producer 
earlier this month when it was named the U.S. champion). Stikkitty will play 
Nov. 25 at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, opening for Sweet.

Rock Loses a Round: Rock fans in England received some bad news Wednesday when 
the government decided that Britain's new commercial FM station will feature 
music "other than pop or rock." This is bad news not only for fans but also for 
the various rock stars -- such as Phil Collins, Robert Plant, David Bowie, and 
Elton John -- who lobbied for a rock format on the country's just-formed 
commercial FM station. It is expected that the station, which is to be 
operational in late 1991, will feature classical music. CLAUDIA PUIG

Feathers Ruffled Over 'Wings': Two writers who claim that their ideas were used 
as the basis for the NBC series "Wings" are suing Paramount Pictures, NBC and a 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, writers Russell Scott and 
Mark Anderson claim that they sent story lines to Paramount in 1988 for "Fly by 
Knight," a situation comedy based on an airline. The material was returned, 
they said, but not before it was allegedly opened and used as the basis for the 
show. A Paramount spokeswoman said that the studio had no comment on the suit.

HIGH JINKS AMID HEROICS IN 'HENRY V' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With its handsome Elizabethan stage and period look, Orange Coast College's 
"Henry V" seems to promise at the outset a respectable and authentic approach 
to Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
But things get prickly soon enough. By the time Nym, Bardolph and Pistol show 
up, director Alex Golson has let the high jinks out of the bag. His young 
actors (Peter Roche as Nym, William C. Meadows as Bardolph and Karl A. Person 
as Pistol) goof off -- silly swordplay, face-making, that sort of thing -- and 
it does the production little good. 
</P>
<P>
To be fair, there is much parody in these braggart servants-cum-reluctant 
soldiers -- and the 17th-Century English stage was known for its fits of 
ribaldry -- but turning the trio into the Three Stooges with a Bard's-eye-view 
is too much. Further, it disrupts the tone that is so crucial to the drama: a 
telling of heroics and the savagery of war. 
</P>
<P>
Golson does get back to basics, but even then he can't resist the occasional 
flippancy. Still, this production features a nicely turned collegiate 
performance by Mike Thompson as King Henry in his most masterful moments as 
leader, manipulator and even flirt. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson may not find the notes of romantic fatalism and regret in the glorious 
"St. Crispian's Day" speech ("We few, we happy few, we band of brothers") on 
the eve of battle with the French, but he makes it a rousing call to arms. And 
his wooing of Princess Katharine (played attractively as the height of coyness 
by Glynna Goff) has awkward charm. To be sure, he seems more like a youthful 
Prince Hal than the more mature King, but in that respect, Thompson's own age 
plays against him. 
</P>
<P>
On the technical side, David Scaglione's set, with its tall archways, balcony 
and entrance paths, is a fine-looking representation of the stage during 
Shakespeare's day. Jane Hobson's lighting is rudimentary but gets the job done, 
and Dawna Oak's costumes are a mixed bag, some being rich and elegant, others 
more economical and pedestrian. 
</P>
<P>

STAGE WATCH: TWO ADVENTUROUS THEATERS GET MORE NEA FUNDING; 
</P>
<P>
GRANTS TO LATC AND SAN DIEGO REPERTORY THEATRE ALLAY FEARS THAT ONLY 'SAFE' 
ARTS ORGANIZATIONS WOULD SEE ENDOWMENT MONEYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The controversy surrounding the National Endowment for the Arts since last year 
led some observers to fear that only the safest arts organizations would be in 
the endowment's good graces. 
</P>
<P>
But so far that's not the case, judging from the latest endowment grants to 
professional theaters in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Two Southland theaters with reputations for adventurous work won major 
increases in endowment funding, according to an endowment list of 214 
professional theaters, receiving $7.8 million for the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Theatre Center's endowment grant rose from last year's $40,000 to 
$65,000, while San Diego Repertory Theatre's grant increased from $35,000 to 
$60,000. 
</P>
<P>
These grants were issued with the NEA's anti-obscenity certification 
requirement intact, though it was recently struck from legislation that applies 
to next year's grants. However, many of the recipients -- including LATC and 
San Diego Rep -- filed friend-of-the-court briefs in lawsuits challenging the 
clause. 
</P>
<P>
Among other local theaters, South Coast Repertory did best this year -- its NEA 
grant will rise from $95,000 to $112,500. David Chambers, an SCR artistic 
associate, was chairman of the NEA theater panel, but he followed endowment 
conflict-of-interest rules and left the room during discussion and vote on the 
SCR application, an endowment spokeswoman said. Under new NEA enabling 
legislation passed by Congress over the weekend, he would not be able to serve 
on next year's panel -- conflicts of interest will be illegal in future NEA 
grant-review proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
All of the other Southern California theaters that are NEA recipients will 
receive the same amount as last year, or less. 
</P>
<P>
The Mark Taper Forum won $260,000, down $20,000 from last year. Its amount was 
nevertheless the third largest on the list, surpassed only by grants to the 
Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis and Arena Stage in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Old Globe's grant stayed at $180,000. La Jolla Playhouse received $76,500, 
down $8,500. The Odyssey Theatre got $31,500 -- $3,500 less. 
</P>
<P>
East West Players, L.A. Theatre Works and Stages each garnered $7,500 -- the 
same amount as last year. 
</P>
<P>
The endowment theater program began its apportionment of money this year by 
cutting the allotments to last year's recipients -- at least those that 
received more than the minimum $7,500 -- by 10%. The pool of money derived from 
these cuts was then used to reward groups that were considered to have been 
underfunded in past years, an NEA spokeswoman said. Some of the money was also 
restored on a discretionary basis to some of the other theaters. 
</P>
<P>
LATC artistic director Bill Bushnell pointed out that both his theater and San 
Diego Repertory came of age in the '80s, when the Reagan Administration reined 
in endowment funding: "We suffered certain inequities because the endowment 
itself wasn't growing." 
</P>
<P>
Bushnell said he believes the endowment boost also reflects "a sense that (LATC 
is) going to survive. . . . We're a year older, and our overall (budgetary) 
numbers have improved considerably." Recent tough talk by some City Council 
members, who advocate ending or reducing city support for LATC, occurred after 
the endowment theater panel deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Rep managing director Adrian Stewart agreed that "we've historically 
been underfunded." But he sounded grimmer about the future than Bushnell, 
noting that the theater must still raise $350,000 in private contributions by 
the end of the year "to keep our doors open." He said he was heartened by the 
endowment endorsement of the "high-risk" programming taken by San Diego Rep 
last year -- risks that he acknowledged helped plunge the theater into its 
current fiscal crisis. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla is another theater that emerged in the '80s, and the Odyssey attained 
much of its reputation during the '80s, yet funding for these theaters was not 
supplemented after the initial 10% cut. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Levey, La Jolla's managing director, acknowledged that "given our relative 
youth, we were being funded more (in previous years) than other organizations" 
such as LATC -- which has a budget almost twice as large as La Jolla's. 
</P>
<P>
The Odyssey's Ron Sossi said his theater's NEA funding probably won't rise 
above its current level "until we're under an Equity contract" -- which won't 
happen unless the Odyssey expands into quarters larger than its current 99-seat 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Shakespeare Festival, which rejected another endowment grant 
earlier this year because of the endowment's anti-obscenity clause, was listed 
as a recipient of $243,000 in this latest round of grants. 
</P>
<P>
The Shakespeare Festival's producer Joseph Papp said he would announce today 
whether the $243,000 will be accepted. The Oregon Shakespeare Festival, which 
rejected a $49,500 grant earlier this year for similar reasons, was not 
mentioned on the endowment list. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the NEA confirmed Wednesday that Jessica Andrews, who took over as 
director of the endowment's theater program 10 months ago, has resigned to 
become managing director at Washington's Shakespeare Theatre at the Folger. 
Andrews was one of two acting program directors named a permanent director by 
NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer in his first personnel moves after taking over 
the agency in October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA said Andrews would leave the endowment next month. She joined the NEA 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
LATC SINGS: "The Joni Mitchell Project," opening tonight at LATC, was born from 
an idea by Barry Krost, the business partner of Mitchell's manager Peter Asher. 
Krost is also a board member at LATC. 
</P>
<P>
Could the project have been approved because Krost is on the theater board? 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not," said LATC artistic director Bushnell. "I've turned down other 
projects Barry has presented. I've turned down dozens of projects presented to 
me by the trustees." The project was approved strictly on its artistic merits, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bushnell declined to discuss the show's details. Krost, while acknowledging 
that Mitchell "will be well and appropriately remunerated" for her material 
(she is not performing in the show), added that if the show is commercially 
successful in a later life after its LATC run, LATC could earn "a considerable 
income" from it, as could Mitchell. "I'm assuming LATC would be a substantial 
participant." 
</P>
<P>
Starting next week, "The Joni Mitchell Project" will be joined by another 
musical revue, "Blues in the Night," at LATC. Bushnell said no subscribers have 
complained about two revues in a row; instead, "my guess is they'll be 
overjoyed." 
</P>
<P>
The overlap wasn't intentional, said Bushnell: "The timing just happened to 
work out that way because of the schedules" of the two directors. 
</P>
<P>
From the two shows, he added, "The astute observer will see that you can start 
from the same position" -- songs, singers and instrumentalists -- "and end up 
with something completely different." 
</P>
<P>
COMING ATTRACTIONS: Tony Franciosa and the original cast's Liliane Montevecchi 
will star in the national tour of "Grand Hotel," scheduled to arrive in Costa 
Mesa April 2, in Hollywood May 28 and in San Diego Aug. 20. . . . Sheri 
Glaser's "Family Secrets" will re-open at the Heliotrope Nov. 24 after a 
successful run at the Hahn Theatre in San Diego. Earlier this year the show ran 
six months at the Heliotrope. An additional character has been added during the 
San Diego run: a trance channeler who is married to the older daughter of the

PACIFIC CHORALE STANDS ALONE IN SEASON PREMIERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
As leader of the Pacific Chorale, John Alexander has often shown a flair for 
the dramatic. So Tuesday night, it came as no surprise to see bell ringers 
placed strategically throughout the Orange County Performing Arts Center, with 
timpani, harp and two sets of chimes flanking the chorus on stage. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was the opening of the group's 1990-91 season. More than that, it 
was the premiere performance of the final revised version of Leonard 
Bernstein's "Missa Brevis." 
</P>
<P>
The 14-minute piece began as a reworking of choruses from a 1955 production of 
Jean Anouilh's play, "The Lark." Two years ago, reportedly at Robert Shaw's 
suggestion, Bernstein created a "Missa Brevis" that combined the medieval 
strains befitting the play's Joan of Arc story with his own uniquely American 
idiom. 
</P>
<P>
In its present version, an elemental power -- imparted by strong homophonic 
passages, an abundance of open intervals, influence of Eastern chant style, 
percussion accompaniment and a countertenor soloist -- forms a forceful 
combination with contemporary style. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein's score calls either for countertenor or boy soprano. Chorale-member 
Edward Bruner's countertenor, resembling a pitch pipe, lent a primitive effect. 
His voice worked best when accommodated by a thinly textured accompaniment but 
floundered in a struggle to carry over a huge choir in more dense sections. 
</P>
<P>
The choir responded as it did throughout this largely a cappella program -- 
with rich, unforced sound, sometimes marred by breathy upper notes and 
intonation imperfections in the soprano and tenor sections, but usually 
well-controlled and focused. Its strengths shone particularly in a glowing 
performance of Samuel Barber's "Agnus Dei," a challenging vocal transcription 
of the well-known Adagio for Strings. The composition emerged with transparent 
balance, organlike legato, finely controlled dynamics and precise phrasing that 
permitted telling exploitation of silences. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander tied the inclusion of selections by Barber into Bernstein's life by 
noting that Barber had taught the younger composer during the latter's student 
days at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia. The choral director drew a 
similar thread during introductory comments regarding pieces by Randall 
Thompson -- "Have Ye Not Heard/Ye Shall Have a Song" and "Alleluia" -- that 
closed the program. 
</P>
<P>
The program did not revolve around Bernstein, however, but around the 
unaccompanied prowess of the Pacific Chorale as showcased in works that 
included Brahms' "Vier Gesange" for women's voices, and Knut Nystedt's "Veni." 
These gave the chorus an opportunity to demonstrate clear, simple singing 
marked by admirable control of nuance, even within a limited dynamic range. 
Kirke Mechem's "Dan-u-el" highlighted the full, expressive bass of choir-member 
Ralph Cato.

SAN FRANCISCO FORCES 'CAPRICCIO' INTO FLAPPER ERA; 
</P>
<P>
KIRI TE KANAWA DOMINATES A LAVISH PRODUCTION OF RICHARD STRAUSS' 'CONVERSATION 
PIECE FOR MUSIC' THAT IS SET IN THE 1920S, NOT 1777.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Strauss' "Capriccio," which has been given a lavish new production in 
San Francisco, is hardly the composer's most accessible opera. 
</P>
<P>
Completed in 1942 amid the chaos of the Third Reich, it represents the aging 
composer's final theatrical ode to a romanticism in decay. It is a fragile, 
thoughtful, sophisticated yet forbidding little philosophical debate that goes 
on for well over two hours. 
</P>
<P>
It brims with clever arguments, nostalgic quotations and subtle in-jokes as it 
mulls, but refuses to answer, this earth-shattering question: Which comes first 
in opera -- and in art and life -- the word or the melody? 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, Strauss didn't even call this valedictory essay an opera. He 
preferred to label it a "conversation piece for music." 
</P>
<P>
For better or worse, it is a static conversation piece predicated on intimacy 
and elegance. It demands to be played in a small theater, where the smallest 
verbal and facial nuances can convey their own dramatic urgency. It demands the 
aura of finesse dictated by courtly Baroque manners. 
</P>
<P>
Even under the best of circumstances -- say in Rudolf Hartmann's legendary 
production at the tiny old Residenztheater in Munich with Lisa della Casa in 
the central role -- "Capriccio" is a difficult challenge. Clemens Krauss' talky 
text, inspired by the uncredited Joseph Gregor, appeals more to the intellect 
than to the emotions. At 78, Strauss took a leisurely, circuitous route to his 
last, glorious final scene. 
</P>
<P>
The current San Francisco staging -- the first since the local premiere in 1963 
-- suffers from basic communication problems. The cavernous War Memorial Opera 
House is too big. The German text represents an obstacle to audience 
involvement. The supertitles distract attention from the stage, and reduce 
comprehension to a reading experience. 
</P>
<P>
Most damaging, perhaps, is John Cox's chic but irrelevant decision to move the 
inaction from 1777 to the terrible 1920s. The introspective, essentially 
dignified Countess becomes a cool flapper. The crucial contemporary references 
to Gluck and the operatic reforms of the 18th Century become nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
The director's temporal distortions are compounded by glitzy costumes 
commissioned from a fashion designer, Gianni Versace, and by some awkward stage 
business. Cox raises the curtain prematurely and moves the string sextet from 
the orchestra pit to the Countess' dark and empty salon. In the process, he 
destroys narrative logic. Later, he places the prop harpsichord so far upstage 
that Flamand becomes all but inaudible when he improvises the all-important 
sonnet at the keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
Cox does create interesting character portraits, and he has an eye for telling 
detail. He paints pretty stage pictures within the gentle scenic splendors 
designed for a Brussels production by Mauro Pagano -- whose untimely death 
three years ago is still mourned in the world of opera. In the final analysis, 
however, Cox seems to have miscalculated the delicate nature of the opera and 
blurred the crucial class distinctions. A coarse "Capriccio" must be an 
oxymoron. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Barlow, the young British conductor who inherited the baton from the 
late John Pritchard, conducted on Tuesday with lyrical verve and ample wit, if 
not with much refinement. He accompanied the endless conversations attentively 
but loudly, and stressed extrovert prose in the marvelous orchestral 
interludes. 
</P>
<P>
The cast, though uneven, respected the fundamental ensemble values. It was 
dominated by Kiri Te Kanawa as the happily agonized Countess. She looked 
excruciatingly glamorous as she searched for the meaning of life in an 
invisible full-length mirror. She sang the closing monologue with arching, 
ethereal pathos. She also allowed a trace of vulgarity to mar a 
characterization that Strauss had marked with infinite nobility. 
</P>
<P>
Both of her suitors were eloquently delineated. William Shimell as the 
passionately edgy yet vulnerable poet, Olivier, seemed a bit more persuasive, 
however, than Keith Olsen as the poised and confident composer, Flamand. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Braun blustered sympathetically as La Roche, the practical man of the 
theater, although he could not produce the booming basso tones dictated by a 
tradition that began with the peerless Georg Hann. Hanna Schwarz exuded 
sensible erotic allure as the actress Clairon, one preposterous costume 
notwithstanding. Hakan Hagegard played the convivial Count for laughs, mangled 
the spoken dialogue and sang with nice baritonal point. 
</P>
<P>
Michel Senechal made a sweet cameo appearance as Monsieur Taupe, the drowsy 
prompter. Reri Grist mugged shamelessly and sang a bit unsteadily as the 
Italian soprano (shades of "Rosenkavalier"), accompanied by a bel-canto tenor 
of staggering promise: Craig Estep. 
</P>
<P>
Hans Hotter, who had taken a leading role at the world premiere nearly half a 
century ago, had been scheduled to return in the fleeting part of the major 
domo. He apparently had second thoughts, and the role was enacted with uppity 
cheer by Dale Travis. 
</P>
<P>
Isabelle Creste and Jim Sohm danced an anachronistic ballet parody 
choreographed by Val Caniparoli. It proved most notable for the ballerina's 
hideous cartoon costume and, in moments of extension, for a recurring crotch 
gag. 
</P>
<P>
Strauss would not have been amused.

MECHEM'S SPARKLING 'TARTUFFE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moliere's "Tartuffe, or The Imposter," a comedy about religious hypocrisy, has 
retained its currency since the dramatist introduced the work to the Court of 
Louis XIV in 1664. 
</P>
<P>
Drawn by the comic achievement of the play, Wichita-born composer Kirke Mechem 
turned it into a three-act opera in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
In a production at the Little Theater at Cal State Northridge, the work runs 
through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the printed program, Mechem receives credit for the music and the libretto. 
No one is identified as the translator of the French. Unless memory serves ill, 
that honor ought to go, at least in part, to poet Richard Wilbur. 
</P>
<P>
Mechem has exercised his prerogatives as librettist, eliminating one character, 
double-casting two others and rewriting the ending. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the 65-year-old composer has created a sparkling, lapidary and 
accessible work. 
</P>
<P>
Mechem establishes musical tags for his characters: spectral hymn harmonies for 
Tartuffe, an absurd flourish for the dupe Orgon. He unifies the work in other 
clear ways, as when the soubrette maid Dorine sings a mocking folk ballad in 
the first act and the principals reprise it in the third. He also finds 
opportunities for musical wit. 
</P>
<P>
He can rise to lyric heights as the occasion demands, such as when Mariane begs 
her father not to make her marry Tartuffe. Not least, he can create catchy if 
not-too-complex ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the student cast found most of his demands quite taxing and 
served the music less well than it did David W. Scott's fluid, high-spirited 
stage direction. Scott also conducted the small orchestra with vigor, style and 
frequent disregard for overwhelming his singers.

INNOVATION: IGNORE CORPORATE MEDIA AT YOUR OWN RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To really grasp the Fifties, you'd want to see the McCarthy hearings, Edward R. 
Murrow, Uncle Miltie and "Rebel Without a Cause"; you'd want to read "Lolita" 
and "Catcher in the Rye"; you'd want to hear the music of Elvis, Pat Boone and 
Chuck Berry. 
</P>
<P>
The media may not define pop culture, but they certainly capture and reflect 
it. What's true for pop culture also holds for organizational culture. A decade 
ago, you could grasp the essence of an organization by sitting in on a few 
meetings and rummaging through the interoffice memos. Starting in the mail room 
wasn't all that crazy an idea. 
</P>
<P>
Today, organizations are becoming far more media-intensive. It's not just that 
they're using computers and telecommunications networks to manage data; they're 
packaging information in new ways. They're making videotapes and creating 
internal television networks. They're crafting "expert systems" -- computer 
programs that embody the technical expertise of company old-timers -- and using 
fax or electronic mail as the medium of instantaneous communication. The 
"old-boy" network has taken on a technological hue. Personal interactions are 
increasingly mediated, complemented and/or captured by an increasingly 
elaborate media mesh. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a sense of much greater visibility," observes Thomas W. Malone, 
director of MIT's Center for Coordination Science. "We're coming to live more 
and more in a sea of information; in principle, things that may have once been 
unknowable are now easy to find out. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people have talked about the dawning of the age of electronic 
communications as being analogous to the dawn of history in the sense that 
there's no written record of prehistoric times," he adds. "As more 
communication is stored electronically, it makes it easier to analyze, 
reconstruct, capture and understand the communications of organizations. It's 
much more difficult to reach back into 'prehistoric' times before there was 
such culture." 
</P>
<P>
What are the production values for a presentation? Will a transparency be 
enough or do people insist on 35-mm. color slides? Must financial projections 
be number-crunched through Lotus 1-2-3 or Microsoft Excel spreadsheet software? 
Are in-house training programs built around videocassettes, flip charts or 
multimedia-flavored personal computers? 
</P>
<P>
These are the questions that managers will increasingly ask themselves to 
understand how the organization creates its internal models of reality. The 
answers to these questions reveal aspects of the organization's culture that 
may have been previously hidden. These technologies have become cultural 
artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
Many organizations are beginning to tape and transcribe meetings. In the few 
years, computer voice/text editors will index those sessions according to the 
desired key word. Want to know who said what at the meeting about 
"productivity"? Just ask the workstation. Some Silicon Valley companies and 
giant consumer goods firms now use camcorders to record sales presentations and 
technical reviews. These tapes don't just preserve the data; they preserve the 
organization's style. These technologies are becoming a new storehouse for the 
organization's values, not just its information. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people who are beginning to worry about this," says Jeff 
Sturchio, the corporate archivist for Merck, the pharmaceutical firm. "Cultures 
are based very much on interpersonal relations, but as organizations get 
larger, in order to manage the organizations, they have to rely on some of the 
new media because there's no other way to get the message out." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, says Sturchio, Merck currently produces and distributes a weekly 
three-minute news video for in-house consumption. The company is also putting 
together a multimedia presentation for its centennial next year. "That's the 
kind of mirror of Merck culture that we will save," Sturchio notes. By 
contrast, "the phenomenon of the electronic lab notebook troubles me because 
I'm not certain how to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
But Sturchio freely acknowledges that the growth of these new media is 
transforming his job. He says it's too early for him to comment on how these 
new media are transforming Merck's culture. 
</P>
<P>
"It's media as the life of the mind of the organization," asserts Mark Stefik, 
a researcher at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center who designs knowledge 
management systems. "Let me give you an example. If you experience a 
presentation that's very persuasive, you might want to capture as much of it as 
you could. 'I really need that set of slides or that chart or that figure that 
summarized a trend.' When people find these compact cultural memes, they seize 
on them." 
</P>
<P>
New media technologies are where these new memes -- compelling ideas -- are 
developed and transmitted. "The technological content of corporate life is 
rising," Stefik says. "We'll have computer data, electronic blackboard inputs, 
audio recordings of meetings, etc.; multimedia technology will enable us to tie 
these things and retrieve them." 
</P>
<P>
This isn't an issue for the sociologists and anthropologists; it's an issue 
that will determine how organizations see and manage themselves in an 
increasingly competitive environment. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, you couldn't ignore the memo. Ten years ago, you couldn't 
ignore the phone. Today, you can't ignore the computer network and voice mail. 
Tomorrow's managers shouldn't be surprised if they spend as much time managing 
media as they do managing people. They will be immersed in a far denser, far 
richer, far more comprehensive regime of technologies than they are today. To 
understand the culture of the organization, they will have to be able to 
interpret its media. If they want to shape the values and direction of their 
organizations, they must learn how to manipulate those media. 
</P>
<P>
"These technologies," says MIT's Malone, "are going to change the 
organizational balance of power in ways that we can't yet anticipate."

MGM DEAL WITH PATHE MAY COST ITS BONDHOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CIEPLY and ALAN CITRON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some MGM/UA Communications Co. bondholders are beginning to fear that they -- 
along with the federal government and at least one troubled thrift -- will be 
losers if Pathe Communications Corp. completes its long-delayed plan to buy the 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA's $400 million in junk bonds, issued in 1986 by now-defunct Drexel 
Burnham Lambert Inc., have traded lately at only about 60% of the price they 
commanded when Pathe first announced its $1.3-billion buyout last March, 
largely because of concerns about the financial viability of the merged 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Some holders, moreover, are now complaining that Pathe's plan to finance the 
purchase partly by selling long-term rights to the MGM/UA film library will 
jeopardize the company's ability to make interest payments or redeem the bonds 
when they mature. The Pathe plan also may violate covenants in the bonds, they 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"We think there's a real problem," said a source close to Columbia Savings 
&amp; Loan, an insolvent thrift that owns $38.6 million worth of the bonds. 
"Someone has found some loopholes and is driving a truck through them." 
</P>
<P>
A Pathe spokesman said his company hasn't received any formal complaints from 
bondholders and doesn't believe that there will be any violation of covenants 
or deterioration of credit standing as a result of the rights sales. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, MGM/UA Executive Vice President Kenin Spivak said his company 
"takes seriously the confidence" investors have shown by purchasing bonds. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "We have structured the Pathe merger to ensure the solvency of the 
company and our compliance with our obligations to creditors. Among the steps 
we have taken to ensure the company's ability to service its debt are obtaining 
appraisals of Pathe's assets and a solvency opinion from America's leading 
firms in the field, including a requirement in the merger agreement that the 
financing . . . must comply with our (bond) indenture(s)." 
</P>
<P>
In New York Stock Exchange trading Wednesday, MGM/UA's 12.625% 1993 bonds 
closed at $62, up $4.50 in moderate trading. But they have sold for weeks at 
about 40% below their $97 price at the end of February, shortly before Pathe's 
bid surfaced. A separate issue of 13% 1996 bonds closed at $49, up $6.625. One 
trader said he believed that the sudden jump resulted when an investor was 
forced to buy bonds to cover a "short" position. 
</P>
<P>
At least one bondholder said he wants Pathe to buy back the bonds, a step that 
would increase the MGM/UA purchase price to as much as $1.7 billion. "It's our 
belief that (the buyout) would violate the covenants. We want to be taken out," 
said a representative of the bondholder, who declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the bonds were initially sold to a close circle of customers who dealt 
regularly with junk bond king Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
Among the biggest current holders appear to be First Executive Corp., a Beverly 
Hills-based insurance holding company, with some $58 million face value in the 
bonds, and Columbia, with its $38.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Resolution Trust Corp., a government agency that administers failing 
thrifts, has disclosed that it owns MGM/UA bonds with a face value of about 
$7.4 million. The RTC could also inherit the Columbia bonds if the thrift, 
which is insolvent, doesn't find a buyer for its huge junk bond portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
Other buyers of the bonds included Carl N. Lindner's American Financial Corp., 
Integrated Resources and other entities that bought frequently from Milken 
before he was indicted and later pleaded guilty to federal securities law 
violations. Drexel has closed its securities business and filed for bankruptcy 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for Columbia, First Executive and the RTC declined to discuss their 
holdings in detail. 
</P>
<P>
Some bondholders, however, have said they are concerned that Pathe's plan to 
sell its own assets to MGM/UA -- in return for some $700 million that would be 
raised by rights sales to Turner Broadcasting System Inc., Time Warner Inc. and 
others -- may violate a provision limiting MGM/UA's ability to make payouts to 
shareholders. They argue that, while MGM/UA is technically buying assets from 
Pathe, in reality it is creating a payout with money derived from library 
income that could have been used to service debt. 
</P>
<P>
Once the transaction is complete, Bankers Trust of New York, a trustee for the 
bonds, is likely to review it for possible violations, a bondholder said. 
</P>
<P>
It appears unlikely, however, that any bondholder would attempt to block the 
Pathe purchase, which is scheduled to close Thursday, after several delays. 
Pathe and MGM/UA said Tuesday that they were still waiting for the expected 
solvency opinion from Houlihan, Lokey, Howard &amp; Zukin Inc., a Century City 
appraisal firm, before the purchase could be completed. 
</P>
<P>
Some bond experts were skeptical that the holders ultimately could force Pathe 
and its president, Giancarlo Parretti, to buy out the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Lehmann, editor of the Defaulted Bonds Newsletter, which is published 
by the Bond Investors Assn., said there is little recourse available for junk 
bond holders. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't have the protection to begin with, you're pretty much exposed," 
Lehmann said. "The only thing you can do as a bondholder is try to force the 
new debt to come in behind you. But the chances of doing that are slim, since 
these were not high-quality bond issues to begin with. " 
</P>
<P>
After an earlier plan to finance the buyout failed in June, some investors 
bought the bonds, betting that Pathe would never be able to complete the 
buyout, leaving cash flow from the MGM/UA library to service the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, MGM/UA bought back about $7.5 million of the 13% bonds on a dip 
in the market. But investors say they haven't seen any indication that Pathe 
will follow suit. "I hope they'll do it. But they haven't given any indication 
of it yet," one bondholder said.

DOWNTURN CUTS AN UNEVEN PATH ACROSS NATION; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: NEW ENGLAND AND NEW YORK ARE ALREADY IN A RECESSION, BUT SOME ANALYSTS 
BELIEVE THAT THE NORTHWEST AND SOUTHWEST MAY BE SPARED A SERIOUS SLUMP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The widely predicted economic downturn appears to have begun in earnest, but 
its impact so far appears to be spotty. 
</P>
<P>
Pockets of the country, notably the Southwest and Midwest, so far have avoided 
a severe slump, while New England, New York and a few other areas have already 
fallen into a recession, a report by regional Federal Reserve banks showed 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
California, meanwhile, seems to fall in between. The state's economy continues 
to grow but at a much slower pace than a year ago, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
The patchiness of the current slump appears to be almost the reverse of the 
so-called bi-coastal boom that the American economy experienced in the 1980s, 
when the Northeast and California were growing far more rapidly than the rest 
of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed's new report confirms that the Northeast and the Middle Atlantic states 
began to experience a downturn early. "The East Coast looks pretty terrible 
right now," said Gordon Richards, economist at the National Assn. of 
Manufacturers in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Still, although economists say that the overall national economy is probably in 
a recession, many analysts believe that at least a few regions -- including 
parts of the Midwest, the Pacific Northwest and the long-suffering Southwest -- 
may be spared any serious slump. 
</P>
<P>
Some economists believe that these wide variations among individual regions may 
help prevent the current downturn from turning into a deep recession, because 
so many areas are expected to hold up well and thus buoy the overall economy. 
</P>
<P>
The good economic news is coming from some surprising places: Cleveland, for 
example, which lost many jobs during the recession of the early 1980s, is 
enjoying fast growth in its manufacturing industries, which are benefiting from 
strong export sales. 
</P>
<P>
Texas also seems a likely candidate to avoid the worst of the current downturn. 
Its economy began turning up in the late 1980s, after real estate, energy 
prices and employment all hit bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Now, that state's economy is far more diversified than it was during the energy 
crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s and should be able to avoid another 
boom-bust cycle. 
</P>
<P>
"The slump in the rest of the nation has hit worst in areas closely tied to the 
financial services and real estate markets, and we have already hit bottom in 
those areas and now we have stabilized," said Harvey Rosenblum, an economist 
with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. The Pacific Northwest is clearly the 
strongest area in the nation, led by the surging economy of Seattle. Job growth 
in the Seattle area has been running at a 6% annual rate, led by gains in the 
computer software and aerospace industries. 
</P>
<P>
"The Northwest is going to cool off but I still think it is going to be the 
hottest region throughout the 1990s," said Jerry Jordan, chief economist at 
First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
California, despite the ongoing slump in real estate and job cuts in defense, 
is also still showing some strength. 
</P>
<P>
A new forecast by First Interstate predicts that the Los Angeles-Long Beach 
area and the state as a whole will continue to add jobs throughout 1991. The 
rate of employment growth in Southern California "is coming down fast, but 
growth is still positive," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
Areas such as the Great Plains states and the Great Lakes, which never 
experienced the real estate speculation of the 1980s, so far have avoided the 
steep declines in property values that have depressed investment and spending 
on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, in New York and New England, economists are bracing for a deep and 
long recession. The new Fed report found that homes in New England now remain 
on the market an average of 150 days before being sold -- compared to an 
average of 30 days in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect the recession in this region to continue until the summer of 1991 at 
least," warned Sara Johnson, an economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic 
forecasting firm based in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that the economic woes of the Northeast are not confined to 
Massachusetts and New York. New Hampshire, for example, has suffered a 7% 
decline in the number of jobs since the end of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, even within some regions, there are wide variations in economic 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cleveland and Chicago both remain healthy, other Midwestern cities -- 
especially Detroit -- are feeling the effects of layoffs in the auto industry 
resulting from the downturn in consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
"Michigan is in a slump," David Littman, an economist at Manufacturers National 
Bank of Detroit, said flatly. 
</P>
<P>
"The residential real estate market has remained relatively strong in the 
state, because we never had the excesses that plagued the Northeast," Littman 
added. "But it is still very difficult for Detroit and the Midwest in general 
to continue to grow for long if national consumer spending stops." 
</P>
<P>
"I would describe the economy now as like an engine, with some pistons rising 
while others are falling," said First Interstate's Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
"The New England states and New York are certainly already in a recession," 
Jordan said. "They are losing employment. But the West Coast, especially the 
Pacific Northwest, is quite strong. And I was just in Dallas, where people 
(are) saying: 'Hey, we already had a recession -- two years ago.' "

Trump Payment in Doubt: Developer Donald J. Trump raised new doubts about his 
financial stability by telling the American Stock Exchange that it was unclear 
whether he would make an interest payment on Taj Mahal casino bonds next month. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Shabazian, an exchange spokesman, said the Trump Organization made the 
statement in response to a question from the exchange, where the bonds are 
traded. Shabazian said Trump didn't say whether the payment would be made. The 
Trump Organization is supposed to pay $47 million in interest on $675 million 
in Taj bonds Nov. 15.

Ford Motor Recalls Thunderbirds, Cougars: The No. 2 auto maker said it is 
recalling more than 127,000 1987-model Ford Thunderbirds and Mercury Cougar 
cars with 3.8 liter V6 engines to correct unacceptable emissions levels. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers will be asked to install free of charge a vacuum retard delay valve and 
change the ignition timing. Cars affected were built for sale in the 49 states, 
with California and Canadian vehicles not affected. Vehicle emission testing 
conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency and Ford indicated that carbon 
monoxide exhaust emission levels are unacceptable at high altitudes and 
hydrocarbon levels are unacceptable at low altitudes.

"difficult and unsettled" market conditions. Reuters also said it will delay 
the launch of Dealing 2000, an improved system for electronically providing 
foreign exchange information to traders. The layoffs represent 6% of its

<P>
Under the deal, "substantially all" of Stamford, Conn.-based Vestron's assets

COMPUTER FILE: GETTING A FEEL FOR RIGHT KEYBOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE J. MAGID, LAWRENCE J. MAGID is a Silicon Valley-based computer 
analyst and writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm a fanatic when it comes to keyboards. I'm just not happy unless my keyboard 
has the right feel and layout. Trouble is, what's right for me may not be right 
for someone else. Choosing a keyboard is a very subjective process. 
</P>
<P>
It's also an important decision. It's common for users to enter several 
thousand keystrokes per hour. A poorly designed keyboard can slow you down, 
increase your mistakes and tire you out. 
</P>
<P>
So, the next time you buy or upgrade your PC, don't just take whichever 
keyboard the system comes with. Try out several keyboards before you buy and, 
if you don't like the one that comes with the machine, ask the salesperson to 
substitute one you do like. Most PCs come with standard jacks that will 
accommodate any of the after-market keyboards. Most important: Don't buy a 
keyboard strictly on my or anyone else's recommendation. Try before you buy. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to feel, IBM keyboards are my favorite. Every time you press a 
key on a genuine IBM keyboard, you hear a "click" and get some reassuring 
"tactile feedback" from the switch underneath the key cap. Other firms have 
come close to duplicating that feel, but no one does it like IBM. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the great feel, I don't use an IBM keyboard because I don't like the 
layout. Once again, it's a subjective opinion, but I'm not fond of where IBM 
put the Control key. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, there are some good after-market keyboards. DataDesk International 
of Chatsworth and Northgate Computer Systems of Plymouth, Minn., make excellent 
keyboards. Neither has quite the same feel and sound as IBM keyboards, but 
they're pretty close. Both companies give the user some control over the key 
layout. 
</P>
<P>
The Northgate OmniKey Ultra comes with two sets of function keys. One set is on 
the left just as it was on the early IBM PC. Another set is above the number 
keys, where IBM and most other companies now place them. The keys on the left 
work like regular function keys. The ones on top normally perform a 
Shift/function key. They can be reprogrammed to perform like regular function 
keys, a Control/function key or Alt/function key. 
</P>
<P>
I like the Northgate keyboard, but my favorite is the SwitchBoard from DataDesk 
International. I have one SwitchBoard connected to my IBM compatible and 
another on my Apple Macintosh. That makes it a lot easier to switch back and 
forth between the machines. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Northgate board, the SwitchBoard makes it possible to switch the Caps 
Lock and Control keys and to make the comma and period keys active even when 
the shift key is pressed. But that's just the beginning of the board's ability 
to accommodate user preferences. The SwitchBoard is designed so that you can 
add, remove or move modules to suit your individual needs. 
</P>
<P>
The basic keyboard, which looks pretty much like the standard IBM keyboard, 
comes with three sections, or modules. Standard letter and number keys are on 
the left, the cursor controls are in the middle and the numeric keypad on the 
far right. But these modules can be repositioned, or you can add or substitute 
sections. 
</P>
<P>
The company offers an optional track ball for $149.95. A set of 15 vertical 
function keys ($49.95) will be out soon, and a module with 24 programmable 
function keys will be out by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
The SwitchBoard has a suggested retail price of $249 but can be purchased for 
$159 from PC Connection (800) 243-8088 and other discount outlets. Northgate's 
OmniKey Ultra has a suggested price of $149 but is available for $99 from 
Access Computer Technologies (800) 359-6800. 
</P>
<P>
Northgate can be reached at (800) 548-1993. DataDesk can be reached at (800) 
DATADES or (818) 998-4200.

RETIRED WORKER SAYS TRW DEFRAUDED AIR FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TRW's Redondo Beach-based Space and Defense Sector inflated its bids and 
double-billed the Air Force on a series of classified contracts between 1982 
and 1990, a retired TRW manager has charged in a recently unsealed federal 
whistle-blower lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Frank M. Breene, the plaintiff, brought the charges in an amended complaint 
filed under the federal False Claims Act this past June, but the allegations 
were sealed while the Justice Department studied whether to join the case 
against TRW. A federal judge lifted the seal in recent days before the Justice 
Department could reach a decision, said Dean Francis Pace, Breene's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that TRW submitted 
false bids on the secret programs and falsely allocated costs in its contract 
proposals on the series of contracts. The company management submitted those 
false charges to the Air Force in an "intentional" act and against a request by 
Breene that actual accounting figures be used, the suit charges. The suit seeks 
nearly $20 million in treble damages under the False Claims Act. 
</P>
<P>
The suit does not lay out the precise accounting mechanics of how TRW allegedly 
falsely bid and billed the work. 
</P>
<P>
In general, under a defense contract, a firm must allocate contract costs to a 
variety of special accounts, only some of which are fully reimbursed by the 
government. In addition, federal acquisition rules require that all work 
performed under a contract be paid only from funds in that contract. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations brought by Breene involve complex ratios for allocating costs, 
covering production, support, labor and planning. 
</P>
<P>
The contracts are identified in the suit only by unclassified sales numbers. 
The TRW unit produces a variety of highly classified systems, including spy 
satellites designed to listen to foreign telephone and radio communications. 
</P>
<P>
TRW spokesman Julian Levine said in response to the allegations: "The company 
was aware of this suit and cooperated with the Justice Department in their 
review of it. We believe the suit is frivolous and totally without merit." 
</P>
<P>
Breene was a hardware acquisition manager at TRW, Levine said. He could not be 
reached Wednesday.

FOR PARENTS: SITTER SEARCH; 
</P>
<P>
DESPITE DAY CARE, BABY-SITTERS STILL A NECESSITY OF CHILD RAISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Maureen Brown 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Should the word "baby-sitter" slither into conversation, my four children can 
dazzle an audience with embellished tales, complete with sound effects, of the 
individuals who have graciously augmented my role as caretaker over the past 18 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember the one with red-hair who whistled nonstop the theme from 'High Noon' 
and let us have dessert first?" 
</P>
<P>
"How about Jennifer and Katie who had the pet gila monster?" 
</P>
<P>
While society has made strides in providing care for children while their 
parents work, the difficulty of finding competent baby-sitters to assist on 
evenings, weekends and while out of town persists. 
</P>
<P>
Trading services is the obvious and most reasonable method of arranging 
baby-sitting. When our first child arrived, we were living in a married student 
housing unit with a sophisticated, and well-managed baby-sitting cooperative. 
We watched other children and their parents, in return, watched our daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, in less-formal arrangements, our home, at times, has been a 
drop-in center, and I have had the services returned. 
</P>
<P>
We have had children sometimes stay with us while their parents were out of 
town. I have especially found this arrangement helpful with teen-agers, who I 
don't believe should be left unsupervised during those times. 
</P>
<P>
For caring for small children for short periods, students are a blessing. 
</P>
<P>
Junior high students (an age group I came to know well as a teacher) can be 
ideal sitters for youngsters past the age of six months. I feel that these 
sitters are optimal for three reasons: 1) they operate with a certain degree of 
anxiety and, therefore, they are cautious; 2) they tend to play with the child 
rather than allow the television to supervise and 3) they are frequently more 
available to help out since their social life is rather restricted. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't know any sitters in this age group, you might try calling the 
counseling office at a nearby junior high for the names of interested students. 
</P>
<P>
I am hesitant, however, to engage teen-agers during the week. Perhaps, it is 
the teacher in me, but I feel guilty asking a young person to supervise my 
children, prepare dinner, and read bedtime stories on nights when their 
schoolwork requires attention. 
</P>
<P>
When I have needed a sitter during the week, I've turned to baby-sitting 
agencies with success. I preface my remarks about these agencies by noting that 
while a student myself, I worked for one. This month we will attend the wedding 
of a young man I once baby-sat. I well remember his mother's remark when I 
asked how she came to use an agency. Her experience had been that the agencies 
sent people who were well-interviewed, bonded and reliable. 
</P>
<P>
Rates for agency sitters in North County vary, depending on number of children 
and where you live. For one to two children, expect to pay $20 to $28 for a 
three-hour minimum and $4 for each additional hour. For a 24-hour period, 
expect to pay $70 or more. There is often an additional charge for sick-child 
care. The agencies, which are listed under baby sitters in the yellow pages, 
can give you specifics. Information on sitter services for developmentally 
disabled children is available at 574-6481. 
</P>
<P>
I have always required that the agencies send a nonsmoker to our home and asked 
that the television not be turned on during the day or until the children were 
sleeping at night. Over the years, we have had wonderful women spend time with 
our children, reading books and sharing tales about growing up in Arkansas or 
their family ranch in Montana. 
</P>
<P>
On other occasions, I have used baby-sitting agencies in other cities when 
staying in hotels. The concierge at most major hotels can be most helpful in 
arranging for sitters. 
</P>
<P>
One summer, I advertised for a sitter a month prior to our vacation in a 
Michigan newspaper, stating the hours, pay, and children's ages. I received a 
dozen replies to my ad and had a charming college student from a farming 
community spend time with the children. Having employed her two young sisters 
in the past five years as well, we have been enriched by the added enjoyment of 
involving this family in our summer. 
</P>
<P>
I have often used colleges, churches and temples as resources for baby-sitters. 
One can call the college student employment office, which frequently has a list 
of sitters or will place a note on a bulletin board for you. Expect to pay $5 
an hour for college sitters. At UCSD, call 534-4500; at USIU, call 693-4700; at 
Cal State San Marcos, call 471-4145. 
</P>
<P>
Young student couples, sometimes with one child or two, can be ideal candidates 
for baby-sitting. We still list our favorite family as the young law student, 
his wife and baby who have stayed at our home while we have been out of town. 
They came to us with a referral from a friend who knew them from church. In 
addition to playing with our little ones, the couple is young enough to still 
be wise to teen-agers and are firm with house rules. 
</P>
<P>
My kitchen cupboards are shrouded in instructions noting the day's schedule for 
each child, suggested meals, house rules, telephone numbers and a medical 
release form when we leave town. I keep meals extremely simple, suggest the use 
of paper products to cut down on dishes, try to make carpool arrangements and 
make it clear to our children that I expect perfect cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
When you have found good sitters, treat them well, and you'll find they'll be 
there when you need them. Use good judgment when asking for the name of someone 
else's sitter: that person went to the trouble of finding them and you need to 
respect that. Don't take a friend's sitter on as your own without first 
checking back with your friend. 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, there is an unwritten rule regarding baby-sitting, which a friend 
refers to as "my universal open-ended pay-back program." This is the type of 
baby-sitting one does with no regard to direct reciprocation. 
</P>
<P>
One simply helps a friend who needs respite from children or finds themselves 
in a "jam." Our family has been rewarded on several occasions when these 
children have spent time in our home.

At home, in the office and at school, individuals in North County have 
successfully launched recycling programs. Here are some of their stories: 
</P>
<P>
Lauren Seals 
</P>
<P>
Encinitas 
</P>
<P>
When Lauren Michele married Kenneth Seals two years ago, she inherited twin 
boys, five barrels of trash a week and a mission. 
</P>
<P>
Through a concentrated effort, the Seals family reduced their trash from five 
to just one 33-gallon barrel a week. The rest is recycled through Solana 
Recyclers. 
</P>
<P>
"Like marriage, it's been a compromise," Lauren Seals said. "In the beginning, 
it sounds like you are asking a lot, but you really aren't. It's just a matter 
of awareness and organization." 
</P>
<P>
From her kitchen command post, Seals found a place for reusable plastic bags, 
aluminum foil and tin. Each room in her house contains separate trash cans for 
recyclable and nonrecyclable items. 
</P>
<P>
Solana Recyclers provides a biweekly curbside collection program for paper 
(white, colored, computer, bags, junk mail, magazines, telephone books, 
catalogues, towels), plastic (milk, soda and mineral water bottles), aluminum 
(cans, foil, frozen dinner trays, pie pans, old baking pans and scrap), glass 
(beverage bottles and food jars) and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
The family also recycles cardboard (cereal and cracker boxes, empty toilet 
paper and paper towel rolls, corrugated packing boxes) and plastic bags (fruit 
and vegetable bags, freezer bags and dry cleaning bags), which they take to the 
recycling center themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Seals returns used motor oil to a local gas station and waits for a community 
collection day to rid her home of toxic containers, like paints and pesticides, 
which are collected at an appointed site. 
</P>
<P>
"I give reusable items like clothing, shoes, toys, household and building 
materials to (a local charity)," Seals said. 
</P>
<P>
Seals uses her own bags for shopping items, returns hangers to the dry cleaners 
and totes reusable containers for take-out food. She combines errands with 
trips to the recycling center each week. 
</P>
<P>
"Ken and I used to fly out of the house in our robes when we'd hear the trash 
truck coming," Seals said. "Now, it's no big deal. We hear the recycling truck 
coming, that's when we fly out of the house. When I realized that, I knew we 
were making a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Pat MacCarthy Yeakley 
</P>
<P>
Leucadia 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed the "Queen of Recycling" by her friends, Yeakley recently taught a class 
on composting, a controlled decaying process for kitchen waste and plant 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
Yard waste is a major contributor to landfills amounting to 22.2% of the waste 
collected at the San Marcos facility, the only landfill in North County, 
according to San Diego County figures. Within the past six months, an 
innovative grinding program at the San Marcos landfill reduced 9,000 tons of 
yard waste to mulch, said Richard Anthony, principal solid waste manager for 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
Yeakley and two friends, Sue Eckley and Bobbie Carnes, began Environmental 
Express, which is affiliated with the American Assn. of University Women, Del 
Mar-Leucadia branch. The trio alert the membership to environmentally conscious 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you become aware, you become a terrible pain," Yeakley said. "Things you 
never thought about become obvious. Most people want to do the right thing. But 
you can't ask people to change unless you give them an alternative." 
</P>
<P>
Yeakley tells the story of taking an exercise class at the local YMCA. Thirsty 
after her workout, she headed for the refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
"I had 75 cents clutched in my hand when I spotted this enormous beacon of 
Styrofoam cups," Yeakley said. "My mission changed." 
</P>
<P>
She talked YMCA personnel into providing paper cups. Styrofoam (the more common 
name for polystyrene) is made from styrene and benzene, which the Environmental 
Protection Agency ranked among the top six chemicals whose production creates 
hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
Yeakley is a member of North County Coastal Styro-Free Task Force, a group 
organized in August by Solana Recyclers and the North County Coastal Greens to 
reduce the use of polystyrene. The organization is currently involved in a 
campaign to educate businesses on alternative packaging products. 
</P>
<P>
Jack McRoskey 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad 
</P>
<P>
McRoskey, chairman of Republic Tool, buys plastics for reprocessing at his 
Carlsbad-based plant. Republic Tool produced a few thousand pounds of recycled 
plastic two years ago, but today processes more than 3-million pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We're accepting plastics from the consumer waste stream that we reprocess into 
safety barricades that we sell to cities and states for traffic control," 
McRoskey said. "Without present capability, we could go to 5-million (pounds) 
and install new equipment to a factor of 10 million. We'd be able to expand the 
amount of processing as we expand the sale of the product." 
</P>
<P>
Start-up costs to recycle the plastics were in excess of $1 million, McRoskey 
said. Although Republic Tool is the only North County business that processes 
recyclables, McRoskey feels state, county and city capital investment would 
entice more business owners to follow his lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We do it because we're patriotic, apple pie and mother," McRoskey said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Feiler 
</P>
<P>
Terry Welsh 
</P>
<P>
Escondido 
</P>
<P>
At Escondido City Hall, Feiler, a microcomputer specialist, and Welsh, a 
computer programmer, championed a recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
The two began a program two years ago for office paper, computer paper and 
aluminum cans, which generates approximately 2,500 pounds of recyclables a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
City employees have desktop bins that they empty into a larger collection bin 
in each department for collection by the custodial staff. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to start out small and eventually involved the whole scene," Feiler 
said, adding that the Escondido police department and the public works 
department participate in recycling efforts. "We (the city) also purchase 
recyclable paper -- computer, letterhead, envelopes and Xerox copy paper." 
</P>
<P>
Philip Arena 
</P>
<P>
Hazel Gerken 
</P>
<P>
Escondido 
</P>
<P>
Arena and Gerken collect recyclables in an organized program for the 2,500 
homes in the nearby Lake San Marcos community, according to resident George 
Boas. 
</P>
<P>
"The program started 20 years ago by the Mormon Church," said Boas, who helped 
organize the Lake San Marcos program. "About five years ago, (the church) no 
longer wanted to pick up papers so the Noon Optimist Club of Escondido agreed 
to take it over. When they got out of the recycling business, this couple took 
it over." 
</P>
<P>
The program, which boasts an 80% participation rate, collects newspaper, 
aluminum cans and plastics biweekly, said Boas. 
</P>
<P>
John Deaver 
</P>
<P>
Poway 
</P>
<P>
At Poway High School, Deaver began an aluminum can recycling plan that 
generated more than $4,000 for student programs in 1989-90, the first year of 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds and thousands of aluminum cans are thrown away each day," said 
Deavers, associated student body adviser. 
</P>
<P>
There are 36 specially-marked containers on campus with four holes the size of 
a soda can drilled in the lids by wood-shop students. A student delivers the 
recyclables to a redemption center each week. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's proceeds were used for special programs at the school, including 
assemblies featuring a Russian rock band and an Olympic gold medalist. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could recycle 100% of the aluminum, we could make $12,000. The education 
system needs to teach the kids to recycle," Deavers said.

"Fright Night" (1985), directed by Tom Holland. 105 minutes. Rated R. Scary, 
funny and intentionally campy, "Fright Night" revolves around a teen-ager who 
thinks his new next door neighbor is a vampire. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Sarandon makes a wise-cracking, smug resident Dracula, and Roddy McDowall 
plays "The Great Vampire Killer" with verve. A perfect mix of comedy and 
chills. MIKE BELL

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: KING OF FRENCH CUISINE REIGNS AT FOUR SEASONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just as the pianist at Vincent's Four Seasons in Solana Beach began playing 
"Someone to Watch Over Me," chef-proprietor Vincent Grumel left his kitchen for 
a moment to watch over the dining room. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in the doorway in a state of relaxed attentiveness, Grumel looked 
finally to have come to rest. The sight was encouraging, since Grumel, one of 
the most peripatetic of French chefs, has cooked at at least seven locations 
since arriving in North County a dozen years ago. 
</P>
<P>
If there was a faintly regal aspect to his stance, it was because Grumel 
accepts the just accolade as the local king of ducks and potatoes, items that 
in his hands can reach rare degrees of perfection. 
</P>
<P>
His duck confit, advertised by the menu as Vincent's prime specialty, is 
precisely that; these duck legs are carried nearly to a state of grace by long, 
slow simmering in their own seasoned fat and juices. Grumel knows no end of 
tricks with potatoes, but does especially well with a crisp, melting potato 
cake that he makes whenever the mood strikes him, and with the more frequently 
available gratin dauphinoise, or sliced spuds baked to a satiny finish in 
garlic-scented cream. 
</P>
<P>
While the menu is French to the core and the dining room itself exudes an old 
fashioned formality, Grumel does seem to be having fun with the cooking, 
especially with his daily specials. 
</P>
<P>
This list recently included such novelties as a sauteed filet of sole with 
golden caviar, Sauterne sauce and a confit -- really a sort of marmalade in 
this case -- of apples and onions; grilled ahi with tapenade (Provencale olive 
relish) and mozzarella cheese and butter-sizzled slices of fresh foie gras from 
an Oceanside farm, served with sauteed watercress and Sherry sauce. Most 
surprisingly, though, was grilled chicken with chiles rellenos and tomatillo 
salsa. 
</P>
<P>
Grumel explained the presence of this last item, which seemed far afield, by 
saying, "It's pretty interesting. You gotta change, and we change every day." 
His chicken was coated in mixed fresh herbs, and the chilies were roasted and 
peeled rather than battered and fried. For the filling, Grumel replaced the 
usual Jack cheese with Port Salut. 
</P>
<P>
But Grumel does excel at traditional French fare. A lobster bisque was every 
bit as smooth and deeply lobstery as this grand soup should be. A simple salad 
of Romaine with walnuts and Roquefort was treated as a dish of great moment, 
right down to the placement of an auxiliary pile of alfalfa sprouts, that, 
while attractive, was a touch unnerving at a French establishment. 
</P>
<P>
The standing menu runs through appetizers of house-cured salmon, duck liver 
mousse, shellfish in puff pastry and the day's pizza (usually excellent) to 
entrees of salmon with oyster mushrooms, scallops with ginger and candied 
orange peel, grilled veal chop stuffed with goat cheese, rack of lamb coated 
with herbs and garlic, and a low-cal grilled chicken breast in fresh raspberry 
puree. There are several low-cal entrees, in fact, including a salmon named for 
weight-loss queen Jenny Craig, and these are fine, as long as you order the 
waiter in advance not to deploy the dessert tray anywhere near your table. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the duck confit, Grumel offers a roast duck with a light, 
stock-based sauce flavored with lime. The flavor is illusive and rich, a fine 
foil to the ravishingly tender meat encased in paper-crisp skin. A recent 
special, a simple filet dijonnaise, was a good pairing of beef and mustard 
sauce; the interest came from the tenderness, which Grumel achieved by partly 
sauteing the meat and then finishing it in the oven. This is a typical and 
successful French trick of which few local restaurant kitchens seem aware. 
</P>
<P>
Grumel's dessert par excellence remains his bavarois au chocolat, a miniature 
bombe of cake, vanilla Bavarian cream and chocolate mousse, all buried in hot 
chocolate sauce. Put simply, it is a four star plate-scraper.

IRANIAN CUISINE: HEARTY, HUNKY, FLUFFY AND SUBLIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone unfamiliar with the meaty kebabs, hearty stews and honeyed desserts of 
Iranian food is in for a treat. It's a cuisine for the very hungry, where large 
hunks of meat run into mountains of fluffy rice, but it's also a cuisine for 
the sensualist, with fragrant herbs, pickles that bite and the exotic perfume 
of fruits and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's Iranian restaurants are surprisingly good, and incidentally 
surprisingly cheap. Dekadeh, a mini-mall pink palace in the city of Orange, 
provides a good introduction to this food. 
</P>
<P>
The name means "small village" in Farsi and the decor is quite simple. About 
the only bit of atmosphere comes from a few framed color prints depicting 
nomadic life on the rocky, parched landscape of southern Iran. (From a 
distance, they look like covers of Louis L'Amour westerns.) 
</P>
<P>
Lunch is the best time to come here for a first visit. That's when the 
restaurant serves one of the most generous buffets in the entire county, 
encompassing more than half of the restaurant's menu. Uniformed waiters lift 
the metal covers off the steam trays as you pass through the line, announcing 
the dishes proudly by their Farsi language names. 
</P>
<P>
The one familiar course is a salad of coarsely sliced cucumber, tomato and 
iceberg lettuce, and it might seem the logical place to begin. But make sure to 
leave the house dressing off. It tastes like what you get in plastic sacks on 
airlines, and it will dampen your appetite for the adventures that wait. 
</P>
<P>
And they really are adventures. First you come to a few stews: gheymeh, 
flavored with yellow split peas and a spicy tomato puree, and fesenjan, with 
mashed walnut and a pomegranate sauce. The gheymeh, made with veal, is 
delicious and not at all sour as it can often be. But the fesenjan is a real 
star, the deep crimson sweet and sour sauce marrying perfectly with boiled 
chicken. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are wonderful kebabs, slowly marinated meats served off the skewer 
such as chicken or beef chunks or small lamb loin chops, tender enough to cut 
with a fork. Eat these with any one of the three rice dishes the restaurant 
serves: the green bean and stewed tomato rice called lubia polo, baghala polo 
with its chopped dill and lima bean flavoring, or the tart, exotic barberry and 
saffron rice, zereshk polo. 
</P>
<P>
There's also fluffy pita bread, fresh raw onion (to chew on boldly between 
mouthfuls of kebab) and some well-crafted pistachio baklava (which is not 
included in the buffet price). This buffet covers most of the menu, the only 
significant missing parties being a shish kebab where tomatoes alternate with 
chunks of meat and some traditional side dishes such as the sharp vinegar 
pickles called torshi and a side dish/appetizer called kashk bademjan, which is 
sliced eggplant topped with baked yogurt. For those, you have to come back at 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Dekadeh is inexpensive. Its regal lunch buffet is only $7.95, and nothing on 
the dinner menu is over $9.95. 
</P>
<P>
The Tea Room -- a large, slightly garish dining room overlooking the Newport 
Beach Public Golf Course -- was a French restaurant for a while but is back in 
the hands of former owner Hussein Zahidi, and as a result several Persian 
favorites have crept back onto its small but self-assured menu. 
</P>
<P>
You could begin with one or two of the menu appetizers, such as the greasy 
onion rings or the flavorless, over-battered popcorn shrimp. You could begin to 
doubt the good things you've heard about Iranian restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
So get right into the meaty kebabs: plump, juicy chicken kebab, the filet 
mignon kebab barg or kubideh, a ground beef kebab that looks like a foot-long 
hamburger. All these grilled meats are served with the mandatory mound of rice, 
and the servers automatically bring sumac, a tart, purple-brown Persian 
flavoring (it's the dried berries of the sumac plant) to sprinkle over them. 
These kebabs are the real article, nicely marinated and perfectly broiled over 
a flame. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the menu is non-Iranian: a first-rate prime rib, mesquite-broiled 
salmon with a nice cream sauce, even chicken Marsala. Friday and Saturday 
evenings there are several Persian dishes on the menu that don't appear during 
the week -- eggplant puree and stuffed grape leaves to name two -- and after 10 
p.m., Iranians make up a higher proportion of the clientele. 
</P>
<P>
This restaurant serves a buffet lunch, too. It is best described as 
international, but you will find some Persian dishes on it. Dishes range from 
chicken enchiladas to kebabs and stews, and there are always at least six mixed 
salads to choose from. At $4.95, it is a phenomenal value. 
</P>
<P>
The Tea Room is inexpensive, and an excellent value at dinner. Appetizers are 
$2.95 to $6.95. Complete dinners are $6.95 to $9.95.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: BREAKING THE RULES IN COSTA MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By tradition, a neighborhood restaurant ought to be one that's been around a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
Jade just opened its doors Oct. 3, so long-lived it isn't. But if first 
impressions are any guide, this unpretentious Chinese restaurant, located in a 
Costa Mesa strip center between a chiropractor's office and a Domino's Pizza 
outlet, will be a hit. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Jade special is that its owners, Olivia Fong and Monita Lee, decided 
they could do whatever they wanted, and what they wanted breaks a few rules. 
</P>
<P>
The magenta-and-cream decor for one -- clean and simple. No overpowering gold 
leaf and Coromandel screens to detract from the food. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the menu. 
</P>
<P>
The typical Chinese place has an appetizer list that rarely travels beyond 
paper-wrapped chicken, but Jade gets downright adventurous. 
</P>
<P>
Think back to the last time you saw a cold appetizer plate of delicately spiced 
shredded jelly fish and five-flavor beef, peanuts and preserved bean curd on 
the local chow mein palace's bill of fare. 
</P>
<P>
And if you are a soup fan, Jade's seemingly never-ending list will curl your 
toes. 
</P>
<P>
It quickly ascends from the mundane -- egg flower soup -- through the 
interesting -- pork vegetables -- and into the exotic -- sweet corn and minced 
chicken, or three-flavor shredded bean curd. 
</P>
<P>
In all there are 13 soups and seven more of those meal-and-a-half bowls of 
noodles and soup. 
</P>
<P>
Try the War Won Ton Mein -- thick homemade Chinese noodles, wonderfully spiced 
won tons, barbecue pork, stewed chicken, chewy shrimp, crisp pea pods, 
mushrooms and bok choy cabbage. The vegetables are fresh and crisp, the pork is 
tender and the won-ton stuffing is heaven. 
</P>
<P>
Jade's multipage menu of Cantonese and Mandarin dishes lists more than four 
dozen entrees and a dozen special luncheon plates, and while most are familiar, 
Fong and Lee have a deft touch with spices that perks up what in some 
restaurants can be pretty bland combinations. 
</P>
<P>
Try the Hong Kong style chow meins -- beef, shrimp, chicken, pork or all of the 
above in a tangy gravy atop a crispy yellow bird's nest of the thinnest 
pan-fried rice noodles. Amazing! 
</P>
<P>
Fong and Lee used to own the Chinese Deli in Mission Viejo, a Chinese fast-food 
place that Fong said wasn't very fulfilling "because no matter how much effort 
you put into making the food good, people can't appreciate it because it's from 
a steam table and isn't fresh for long. When we sold, we decided to have a 
regular restaurant so we could make good food that people would enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
Jade Restaurant, 3013 Harbor Blvd. (across from Fedco), Costa Mesa. Open daily, 
11 a.m. to 10 p.m. (714) 966-2988. JOHN O'DELL

THE CORNER BAR: UPBEAT: COUNTRY COMFY

This is the kind of country club where Donald Trump would never be accepted as 
a member. It's more the down-home sort of place where Clint Eastwood could 
comfortably set up filming should he ever decide to make another sequel to 
"Every Which Way But Loose." 
</P>
<P>
There are no upper-strata aspirations here to follow in the footsteps of the 
Crazy Horse Steak House, Orange County's award-winning watering hole and pit 
stop for most of country music's superstars. The Upbeat, in contrast, is happy 
simply to boast a fully stocked bar, a pool table and pinball machines and 
nightly specials, such as a top sirloin dinner for $3.99 or prime rib for 
$6.95. 
</P>
<P>
The club's chief appeal -- besides the fact that it opens at 6 every morning -- 
is the fine local country bands it books. Chris Gaffney &amp; the Cold Hard 
Facts has done weeklong engagements here recently, while Patty Booker &amp; the 
Hired Hands play from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
While the regulars take advantage almost every night of the dance floor, it's 
the Upbeat's "Jam Night" Sundays that brings the most surprises. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with enough gumption in their gut and country lyrics in their head can 
sign up at the Lilliputian bandstand (conveniently located right next to the 
front door) and join the band for a few minutes of stardom. If it doesn't 
exactly promise fame and fortune, participants are at least rewarded with a 
free beer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Upbeat, 12745 Garden Grove Blvd., Garden Grove. Open daily, 6 a.m. to 2 
a.m. (714) 530-4101.

AMMAN, Jordan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A month ago, the Biggest Show in the Middle East was playing Amman, with 
high-wire drama and eye-catching color filling every inch of the tent: 
</P>
<P>
In Ring No. 1, the tragic spectacle of tens of thousands of Asian refugees from 
Kuwait and Iraq, swarming for food and shelter in pitiful camps on the 
Jordanian desert. 
</P>
<P>
In Ring 2, Saddamania, the magical explosion of popular support for the Iraqi 
president. Saddam Hussein seemed to look out on Jordan from every shop window 
and utility pole, a face in the hall of mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
And in the center ring, the grand finale, announced with fanfare by the 
government of Jordan, the economy of a modern state disappearing before the 
very eyes of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
That was then. Last weekend, the first rains of winter ran through the streets 
and gullies of this hilly capital of white-rock homes. On the crowded streets 
dipping past the old mosque in the sunken center of the city, hundreds of taxis 
trolled for leg-weary shoppers. Not one carried a poster of the Iraqi president 
on its rear windshield. 
</P>
<P>
The season was changing, and the Big Show was gone. 
</P>
<P>
Amman, always quiet for a population of 830,000, has returned to its leisurely, 
small-town pace. The Persian Gulf crisis still touches the city, and many of 
the problems and some of the passion remain, but the spotlight has passed. 
</P>
<P>
The Hotel Jordan Intercontinental, packed to the rafters with foreign 
journalists a month ago, has shut two of its three restaurants for renovations. 
In the last, on the rooftop, a Jordanian blonde sings "La Cucaracha" to 
Japanese television crews. 
</P>
<P>
The Information Ministry calls reporters, pushing interviews with government 
officials who could not be reached in late September or early October. 
</P>
<P>
A month ago, arrival at Amman's Queen Alia International Airport was like a 
descent into Bombay or Dhaka: Thousands of Asian refugees, women of the 
subcontinent in exotic saris, filled every corner of the terminals. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting for check-in with their life's belongings in cheap suitcases and 
cardboard boxes, curled in sleep on chairs and lounges, washing their feet in 
restroom sinks -- all the indignities of the refugee trail were borne with 
resignation and, sometimes, airport humor. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 Asians have left the Middle East through Jordan since the 
Iraqi army invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, uprooting through force and fear a way of 
life dependent on imported labor. But the transit camps that once held tens of 
thousands, sometimes for weeks, now average between 200 and 400, and refugees 
rarely stay for more than 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
An encampment of Bangladeshis on the airport road -- formerly rows of canvas 
and blue plastic tents and rudimentary showers and toilets just feet from the 
traffic lanes -- is nearly vacant. Just a few families are waiting to arrange 
passage home. In the city, near the U.S. Embassy, the little sari-sari 
businesses of Filipino refugees -- some soap, combs and barrettes for sale on a 
towel spread on the sidewalk -- are gone, along with their operators. 
</P>
<P>
About a mile away, at the Iraqi Embassy, functionaries no longer dodge through 
the steel office door with arms full of posters of their president to 
distribute. A Jordanian official said his government had nothing to do with the 
posters' disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
In conversation, most Jordanians, particularly the Palestinians, still support 
the Baghdad government, and both the Arab- and English-language editorialists 
bash away at Washington and London. But the hoopla of the pro-Iraqi movement -- 
the organized aspect, anyway -- has cooled with the climate. No major 
demonstrations have been staged for at least two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The passion of the Palestinian community, diplomats note, was distracted by the 
more personal issue of the deaths of 20 Palestinians in Jerusalem on Oct. 8 and 
the violence that has followed. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's King Hussein, meanwhile, steers a middle course and remains an icon of 
stability. Only two things could threaten his rule, one diplomat said: a 
complete collapse of the economy or, politically, "if he makes a U-turn in 
heavy traffic" -- meaning to go sharply against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
And although the economic numbers remain dismal, even the economy seems less a 
topic of despair now that the initial shock has been psychologically absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the popular tilt to Iraq in the Persian Gulf crisis, King Hussein's 
government closed the doors to Baghdad, its No. 1 trading partner. Two weeks 
ago the last operation defying the U.N. embargo -- voluntary shipments of food 
and medicine from political sympathizers -- was shut down. 
</P>
<P>
American officials asked about the continued movement of Jordanian trucks into 
Iraq and were granted a look inside. They confirmed the Jordanian account: The 
trucks, suspicious because they were refrigerated, were crossing the border 
empty and returning with the household furnishings of Jordanian and Palestinian 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
But no Jordanian trucks are crossing the Saudi border. Other reasons were 
given, but Saudi pique at the Jordanian position on the political crisis has 
caused closure of the border to the once-profitable trade in fruit and 
vegetables for the oil countries of the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
And the Riyadh government has yet to resume pumping oil to Jordan, cut off in a 
politically colored contract squabble in late September. (Jordan receives most 
of its oil from Iraq, in an internationally accepted exception to the embargo.) 
</P>
<P>
This week Swissair, Austrian Airlines and Alitalia, the Italian carrier, ended 
their service to Amman. The general drop in tourism in the troubled Middle East 
was blamed, and service cancellations are likely to accentuate the problem.

WHETHER TO PUT A LID ON POT SPLITS ALASKANS

ANCHORAGE, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A couple of times a week, Frank Turney comes home from work, sits down and 
casually lights up a joint. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't drink any more," said Turney, a 44-year-old construction laborer from 
Fairbanks. "I just have a smoke." 
</P>
<P>
What would be a criminal act almost anywhere else in America is perfectly legal 
in Alaska. Fifteen years ago, the state Supreme Court ruled that Alaskans have 
the right to possess and grow small amounts of marijuana in their homes, and 
state legislators later decided that citizens could legally have up to four 
ounces of it. 
</P>
<P>
But now, spurred on by the war on drugs in other parts of the country, Alaskans 
are engaged in a heated fight over whether the permissive law is a good idea. 
Voters will decide next week whether to repeal America's most liberal pot law 
and make possession of any amount of marijuana a crime punishable by up to 90 
days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign has led to a loud debate over citizens' right to privacy versus 
what backers of the measure, including parents' groups and conservative 
politicians, insist is growing medical evidence that pot smoking is bad for 
you. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of parents really think this law is sending the wrong message to our 
youth," said Alyce Hanley, a Republican state representative from Anchorage who 
is among those leading the push for recriminalization. "We've deceived our 
young people -- we've told them there's nothing wrong with it." 
</P>
<P>
Alaskans on the other side of the issue note that it is already illegal for 
anyone under 18 to use pot and illegal for anyone to possess it in public or to 
sell or barter it. They accuse the other side of distorting the health risks 
and say alcohol and drugs such as cocaine cause far greater problems here. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think that the founding fathers thought our Constitution and 
our laws were meant to be for message-sending -- you can do that with an 
advertisement," said Glenda Straube, head of Alaskans for Privacy, a group 
formed to fight the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, a study by the University of Alaska reported that marijuana use 
among high school students in Anchorage had dropped during the 1980s but was 
still 16% above the national average. A study by the local school district 
showed that, during the same period, cocaine use by teen-agers had declined 
dramatically to well below national rates. 
</P>
<P>
No one is sure how many adults in Alaska smoke marijuana, but the number is 
thought to be at least as high as in other parts of the country. In the 
Matanuska Valley north of Anchorage, long known as the state's agriculture 
center, marijuana has become such a big, though illicit, crop that authorities 
have been debating whether to tax it as a farm product. 
</P>
<P>
Turney, the laborer, recently ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Fairbanks and 
noted that four of the five candidates admitted having used marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
"It's accepted more here, I think," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The marijuana referendum has drawn considerable interest outside of the state. 
William J. Bennett, the national drug policy director, toured Alaska last week, 
campaigning for recriminalization. 
</P>
<P>
He invited Alaskans to join the rest of the country in the fight against 
illegal drugs and suggested in a speech in Anchorage that the existing law, if 
not changed, will lure "individuals who don't like what is going on in the 
other 49 to come to Alaska to smoke marijuana . . . . You will increase the 
population of people who want to get into the drug culture . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Alaska's pot vote has become a top priority for the National Organization for 
the Reform of Marijuana Laws, which has contributed nearly $20,000 to Alaskans 
for Privacy. The group is spending the money on commercials urging 
independent-minded Alaskans to "just say no" to government intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven other states, and some local areas, have reduced the penalties for 
marijuana possession, but Alaska is the only place where small amounts are 
legal in the home. Alaska is technically at odds with federal law, which bans 
possession of any amount, but federal law is rarely enforced here, except at 
the Canadian border or when marijuana is found in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska's law grew out of a far-reaching constitutional amendment, 
overwhelmingly approved by voters in 1972, guaranteeing citizens' rights to 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous decision in 1975, the state Supreme Court ruled that marijuana 
was such a relatively non-harmful substance that the privacy provision 
permitted adults to possess it in private. In later cases, the court refused to 
extend the same right to cocaine, ruling it is so dangerous that users should 
face criminal penalties no matter where they are caught. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say that, if the marijuana initiative is approved, they will 
challenge it in court. 
</P>
<P>
Retiring Gov. Steve Cowper recently announced his support of the initiative, 
even though, he said, most lawyers he knows were advising him that it probably 
would not withstand a court challenge.

MAJOR CHANGES ADOPTED IN SAT COLLEGE EXAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A much-debated proposal to add a written essay as a required part of the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test has been rejected, College Board officials announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
However, the nation's most widely used college admissions examination will 
undergo a major overhaul by 1994, with more emphasis on reading and less on 
multiple-choice questions. 
</P>
<P>
The College Board decided that a written essay will replace the multiple-choice 
English composition achievement test, a supplemental exam required by only the 
most selective colleges, including the University of California. In a further 
response to California educators and Asian-Americans worried that an essay 
could penalize immigrants, students will be able to take achievement tests to 
show their language skills in Japanese and Chinese, as has long been the case 
for such languages as Spanish and French. 
</P>
<P>
In other significant changes, test takers will be allowed for the first time to 
use calculators on the SAT math section and about 20% of the math questions 
will force students to come up with their solutions without hints from 
multiple-choice answers. Such widely detested exercises as choosing a word's 
opposite meaning will be cut from the verbal section. Overall, the current 
two-hour SAT may be expanded by as much as 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The reforms are intended to make the tests more relevant to high school 
learning and to discourage the testing tactics that expensive coaching 
academies claim to teach. 
</P>
<P>
"Taken as a whole, these changes are designed to send positive signals to our 
schools, to reinforce sound curricula in the high schools and to help in 
identifying the abilities and needs of a much more diverse student population," 
Harvard University president Derek Bok told a crowded press conference. Bok and 
UC President David P. Gardner were co-chairmen of the task force that 
recommended the changes adopted by College Board trustees Wednesday. The 
College Board, a consortium of schools, sponsors the SAT. 
</P>
<P>
Critics long have alleged that the SAT is biased against minorities and women 
and that private coaching unfairly boosts scores. College Board officials, 
while contesting those charges, nevertheless said they hope the revisions will 
ease the complaints. However, reaction around the country was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
The National Center for Fair and Open Testing, a Massachusetts-based 
organization highly critical of the SAT, contended that the changes are 
cosmetic and designed as a marketing tool at a time when the number of 
college-age students is shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Schaeffer, publication education director for the group, was particularly 
caustic about the College Board's decision to rename the traditional SAT test 
as "SAT I" and the achievement tests, taken on a separate day, as "SAT II." 
</P>
<P>
"Renaming the Titanic the Lusitania doesn't change the disastrous nature of 
things," he said at a rival press conference in the same hotel where the 
College Board was holding its convention. 
</P>
<P>
The new titles will make more students think they have to take both, creating 
an economic boon for the College Board, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 colleges and universities require or strongly recommend that 
applicants take the SAT. But only about 10% of those institutions -- including 
such highly selective California schools as UC, Stanford University and Pomona 
College -- require or recommend supplemental achievement tests. 
</P>
<P>
Such schools use the achievement tests, ranging from history to science, as an 
added admission tool and to place students in appropriate course levels. 
</P>
<P>
The Asian-American Task Force on University Admissions, a California group that 
alleged there may have been quotas for the numbers of Asians admitted to UC, is 
"very gratified" about the addition of Chinese and Japanese achievement tests, 
spokeswoman Kathy Owyang Turner said in a telephone interview from San 
Francisco. This will allow Asian-Americans to show that they are college 
material even if their ability to write in English is not yet up to par, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Korean and Vietnamese tests may be added at a later date, College Board 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
UC leaders warned the College Board that adding the essay to the main SAT would 
produce a political firestorm, possibly forcing the UC system to drop its 
requirement of the SAT altogether. UC applicants now must take the SAT, or the 
rival and less used American College Testing program, as well as achievement 
tests in English composition, math and a subject the test takers choose. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview at the convention, UC president Gardner conceded that 
objections from Californians led to the writing sample being made into an 
achievement test instead of part of the regular SAT. 
</P>
<P>
That stand was taken, he said, because the regular SAT should measure basic 
aptitude, not such teachable skills as essay writing. He disputed any depiction 
of the essay issue as a backing away from writing. Rather, Gardner said, 
"treating writing as a teachable skill is a signal to high schools that writing 
counts." 
</P>
<P>
John Katzman, president of the Princeton Review coaching firm, said he would 
upgrade his rating of the SAT from a D to a D-plus because of the inclusion of 
more questions based on reading long texts. But he said those also could be 
coached. Katzman disputed Gardner's views on the writing sample, saying it 
"sends the opposite message about writing" and merely reflects political fears 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
Some educators also worry that low-income students may not be familiar with 
calculators and may not be able to afford even the cheap variety. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 1.75 million students took the SAT. 
</P>
<P>
The SAT is a rite of passage for high school students, often dreaded for what 
they see as its influence on their future. But admissions officers and College 
Board leaders say that SAT scores are just one component of entrance decisions, 
along with high school grades and activities. 
</P>
<P>
The SAT revisions come at a time when the test needs a shot of positive 
publicity. In February, 1989, a federal judge in New York ruled that the 
state's use of the SAT as the exclusive criterion to award scholarships 
discriminated against women. Women's scores are traditionally lower than men's, 
although the test makers claim that statistic reflects high school courses 
taken, not bias. 
</P>
<P>
The new SAT has been tested in various versions on 100,000 students over the 
past three years. Donald M. Stewart, College Board president, denied that the 
goal was to boost marketing or deflect criticism. 
</P>
<P>
The major modification to the verbal section of the SAT will be adding longer 
reading passages and more testing of vocabulary in sentences. Questions to be 
answered after reading essays or sentences will increase from 40 to as many as 
65. Antonyms will disappear but analogies will remain, possibly declining from 
20 to 15. The number of math questions may drop from 85 to 75. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the current system of scoring each of the SAT sections on a 
200-to-800 point scale will remain. The price of the basic SAT, now $16, is 
expected to rise as a result of the reforms. Stewart declined to quote the 1994 
price, although he said the rise would be less than the rate of inflation.

GM HAS RECORD $2-BILLION LOSS; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE 3RD-QUARTER PLUNGE REFLECTS THE COST OF CLOSING UP TO 9 PLANTS AND 
ELIMINATING THOUSANDS OF JOBS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Conceding its shrunken role in the U.S. car and truck business, General Motors 
Corp. on Wednesday took a $2-billion loss -- its worst ever and one of the 
largest quarterly losses in American business history -- to pay for padlocking 
up to nine assembly plants and severing thousands of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
GM announced it was setting aside $2.1 billion to cover the costs of closing 
the assembly plants and other, unspecified operations. The writeoff overwhelmed 
the company's slim operating profit for the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the affected plants, whose work forces had dwindled to 6,500, have been 
"temporarily" closed for as long as two years. Those plants -- in Missouri, 
Michigan, Massachusetts and Georgia -- had become symbolic of what Wall Street 
viewed as GM's refusal to admit that it isn't the market colossus it used to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
The five other factories -- in Michigan, Ohio and Canada -- have been operating 
under a cloud because they hadn't been assigned anything to build after 1992 or 
1993. Together, they employ another 9,400 workers. 
</P>
<P>
The Van Nuys, Calif., assembly plant similarly has no cars or trucks to build 
after the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird operations are transferred to a 
Canadian plant in 1992 or 1993. But GM officials held out some hope Wednesday 
that the facility will survive the round of closings. If so, it would be 
designated as a so-called "flex" plant, assigned the task of assembling several 
types of cars for the West Coast market. 
</P>
<P>
GM's financial showing in the July-September period was weak even without the 
huge writeoff -- a 79% plunge in profits from a year earlier. This mirrored the 
poor results announced earlier this week by Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., 
all blamed on a weak auto market in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
GM Chairman Robert Stempel called the last quarter "a period of extraordinary 
external uncertainties, declining North American consumer confidence in general 
economic conditions, and intense competition in the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
But the Cadillac-sized writeoff, a sort of financial housecleaning intended to 
give GM more credibility on Wall Street, has less to do with the current weak 
outlook for car sales than with a long-running decline in market share that has 
left GM with what Stempel called "redundant facilities." 
</P>

"It addresses the problem of excess capacity and excess people, to put it 
bluntly," said David Healy, a New York-based analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, 
a British investment house, echoing a segment of Wall Street approval of GM's 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Healy and others expect more closings in coming years if GM is to meet a 
goal of operating at 100% of its plant capacity versus about 70% prior to the 
closings announced Wednesday. For the moment, the New York Stock Exchange was 
"underwhelmed" by GM's actions, Healy said, nudging GM stock up about 12 cents 
to $36.75 per share. 
</P>
<P>
For workers, the shutdowns represent the dropping of the other shoe after 
September's labor agreement with the United Auto Workers that cleared the way 
for plant closings but promised employees a big safety net in the form of 
beefed-up layoff pay, early retirement offers and other measures. 
</P>
<P>
"We found nothing surprising in today's announcement," said Frank Joyce, a UAW 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
By one analyst's estimate, the cost of paying employees at the closed plants 
for not working over the next three years -- the life of the labor agreement -- 
accounts for a large portion of Wednesday's writeoff. GM wouldn't offer details 
on what the $2.1 billion would cover. However, unspecified additional component 
plants and warehouse operations will also be closed or consolidated in the next 
three years, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
GM and union officials said it was impossible to know how many of the roughly 
16,000 active and laid-off workers at the nine plants would end up without any 
jobs. The timing of some closings isn't certain, they explained, and some 
workers might get jobs elsewhere in GM, depending on the car business. 
</P>
<P>
Still, at least for workers at the four already-closed plants whose fates were 
sealed by Wednesday's announcement, the news erased doubts that the shutdowns 
would not be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're better off knowing where we're at. When you work at a place 20 or 25 
years, you get a lot of hope built up that it'll open back up, and it's hard to 
believe it won't," said Dennis Stanley, bargaining chairman of UAW Local 93 in 
Kansas City, Mo., where the GM assembly plant has been closed since April, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
The idled plants whose shutdowns were made permanent Wednesday are in Kansas 
City; Pontiac, Mich.; Framingham, Mass., and Lakewood, Ga. The five expected to 
close in the next two to three years include plants in Lordstown, Ohio; 
Scarborough, Ontario; Flint, Mich., and two in Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
Though they come as news to many outsiders, the eventual closures at the five 
plants have been considered inevitable at the factories themselves, some union 
leaders and GM executives said. Referring to a local newspaper serving 
Lordstown, a company official said, "Maybe the Wall Street analysts don't read 
the Youngstown Vindicator." 
</P>
<P>
Lordstown's van assembly plant -- one of three plants in a large complex -- is 
to close so that van production can be consolidated in Flint. In one example of 
efforts to salvage some of the jobs, GM and the union are studying whether to 
start a third shift at the Lordstown car line -- a step not taken in the U.S. 
auto industry in decades -- to keep many of the 2,500 displaced van assemblers 
working. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully all the workers will end up in the passenger (car) plant," said Tony 
Zone, vice president of Local 1112. 
</P>
<P>
But such solutions hinge on GM's success in winning back car and truck 
customers -- a big task for a company whose share of the U.S. car market has 
tumbled to about 35% from 45% in the last 10 years. GM now sells 40% fewer cars 
in this country than it did a decade ago; its U.S. blue-collar work force has 
tumbled from 500,000 to 300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Even without the huge third-quarter writeoff, GM earnings would have been just 
$109 million, down 79% from a year ago. That is believed to include heavy 
losses on its U.S. car and truck business, given that its overseas auto 
operations and vast financial, computer and aerospace subsidiaries were solidly 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Ford reported a 78% falloff in earnings and Chrysler posted 
a $214-million loss. 
</P>
<P>
The auto industry's troubles prompted Standard &amp; Poor's, the Wall Street 
bond-rating firm, to issue a warning Wednesday that the credit ratings of each 
of the Big Three could be downgraded. 
</P>
<P>
Though it will depend on whether GM can make a competitive recovery -- its 
share of the U.S. car market in recent months has begun to inch upward -- the 
company indicated there could be more plant closings after 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, however, as many as four more GM assembly plants could be 
vulnerable, said economist Daniel Luria of the Industrial Technology Institute, 
a nonprofit research organization in Ann Arbor, Mich. GM currently has 31 
assembly plants in this country. 
</P>
<P>
This round of plant closings "gets them from 70% of capacity to 90% of 
capacity," said Luria. "If they're really serious about getting to 100%, 
they've got to find three or four more plants" to close. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the other approach is to do better in the car and truck business. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Ephlin, retired head of the UAW's GM department -- and once a worker at 
the now-permanently shuttered Framingham plant, said: 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever GM reacts to Wall Street, they make terrible mistakes. There aren't 
too many plants. There's too little production, because they lost so much 
market share. They ought to go out and get it back and fill the plants up."

SOCIALITE TELLS PLAN OF SUICIDE, NOT MURDER; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: BETTY BRODERICK TESTIFIES SHE PLANNED ONLY TO TALK TO HER EX-HUSBAND, 
THEN KILL HERSELF. INSTEAD, SHE SHOT HIM AND HIS WIFE TO DEATH.

Saying she intended to kill herself because she "had no life left," La Jolla 
socialite Elisabeth Anne (Betty) Broderick testified Wednesday that she crept 
into her ex-husband's house, stole into his bedroom and fired the shots that 
killed him and his new wife. 
</P>
<P>
Sobbing as she recounted the shootings, Betty Broderick said she planned only 
to talk to her ex-husband, Daniel T. Broderick, and to kill herself, "to splash 
my brains all over his . . . house," when she entered his bedroom before dawn 
last Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
After a bitter divorce that took four years and left her without her husband, 
custody of her children or an equal share of Daniel Broderick's considerable 
assets, she felt as if she "was dead, been defeated, couldn't fight anymore." 
</P>
<P>
In the dark room, standing in front of her ex-husband's bed, where he was lying 
with his new wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick, Betty Broderick said she saw 
motion. But she said she remembers almost nothing else from that point on about 
the shootings, not even firing her gun. 
</P>
<P>
"They moved, I moved and it was over," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick, who appeared to be holding back tears for hours during a 
second full day of testimony at her murder trial, did not hold them back as she 
recalled the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
In the audience, her children, her family and her ex-husband's family cried, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Broderick, her eldest daughter, who testified last week against her mother 
and who sat Wednesday on the prosecution side of the courtroom, wept with two 
of her aunts and an uncle, Daniel Broderick's sisters and brother. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Broderick, Betty Broderick's second child, who sat on the other side of the 
courtroom, behind the defense table with Betty Broderick's brother, also 
brushed away tears. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick, 42, is charged with two counts of murder in the deaths of her 
ex-husband and his wife. If convicted, she could be sentenced to life in prison 
without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Broderick, 44, was a prominent medical malpractice attorney and a former 
president of the San Diego County Bar Assn. Linda Broderick, 28, was his office 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick has pleaded innocent and has been held since the day of the 
killings -- when she turned herself in to police -- at the Las Colinas Jail in 
Santee. She said Wednesday that in the weeks after she was jailed, she realized 
she was "happy to be locked in a dark, little, safe room where nobody could get 
me." 
</P>
<P>
When her trial began last week, defense lawyer Jack Earley conceded that Betty 
Broderick fired the shots that killed her ex-husband and his second wife. But, 
according to Earley, she did not have the premeditation the law requires for 
first-degree murder because she only intended to kill herself when she crept 
into the couple's home.

'NICKEL A DRINK' SEEKS TO TAP INTO ANTI-POLITICIAN SENTIMENT

Internal polls showing that voters are beginning to revolt against initiatives 
have prompted the backers of an alcohol tax to make a quick shift of strategy 
in the closing days of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
They launched new ads Wednesday that attempt to link their measure with the one 
issue they still see as popular -- the anti-politician movement. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of hastily taped radio commercials, supporters of Proposition 134, 
the so-called "Nickel a Drink" proposal for substantial hikes in beer, wine and 
liquor taxes, portray the initiative as one that has been carefully crafted to 
ensure "politicians don't get their grimy hands" on revenue from the tax 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
"The politicians take our money but we don't have a say in how they spend it. 
That's what I hate about taxes and that's what I like about Proposition 134," 
says the speaker in one ad. Proposition 134 would earmark revenue from the tax 
increase for specific health and law enforcement programs. 
</P>
<P>
Previous ads promoting Proposition 134 emphasized support from such groups as 
law enforcement and from programs the new alcohol taxes would fund. But 
campaign consultants said they decided to shift their advertising strategy late 
last week when polls began to show a sudden erosion of support for nearly all 
initiatives, especially those with tax measures in them. 
</P>
<P>
Alcoholic-beverage interests, who are spending millions of dollars in media 
advertising to oppose the steep tax increase proposed by Proposition 134, said 
they too began to notice movement in their polls about the same time. But they 
said their polling was more narrowly focused because it related only to 
alcohol-tax initiatives. The industry is supporting Proposition 126, a measure 
that would impose a much smaller tax on beer, wine and liquor. 
</P>
<P>
"Our own polling shows us that (support for Proposition 134 is eroding) rapidly 
and the reason is the voters are becoming turned off on all ballot measures," 
said Leo McElroy, media consultant to the Yes on 134 campaign. "There seems to 
be a wave of 'vote no' on everything building up in the public mind." 
</P>
<P>
He said interviews with voters show they seem to be "just angry at the whole 
size and complexity of the ballot." The internal polls were taken after a Los 
Angeles Times Poll that showed support for both Propositions 134 and 126 almost 
even. 
</P>
<P>
The Tuesday election ballot includes 28 propositions, many of them complex, 
far-reaching measures. 
</P>
<P>
The one issue that seems to be immune from the public's anger, said McElroy, 
are the two proposals, Propositions 131 and 140, to limit the terms of 
California lawmakers and statewide officeholders. For that reason, he said, his 
campaign has tried to play to voter dissatisfaction with elected 
representatives by promoting its measure as anti-politician. 
</P>
<P>
Other campaigns say their polling has picked up some of the same negative voter 
reaction, but they insist that measures like Proposition 130, the so-called 
"Forests Forever" initiative that would restrict timber harvesting, are not 
losing. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're seeing is confusion among some voters, but in most cases it moves 
them into the undecided columns," said Steve Glaser, a spokesman for the 
campaign to pass Proposition 130. "As we have seen the vote crystallizing, the 
undecideds have stayed up a little higher, but as people become aware of who is 
behind the forestry measures we see strong support for the environmentalists' 
measure, 130." The timber industry is supporting a countermeasure, Proposition 
138. 
</P>
<P>
Glaser said his campaign has unleashed its most powerful ad, a commercial 
featuring actor Clint Eastwood, to counter any negative voter attitude and to 
put something on the air that "attracts attention even during advertising 
clutter." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Hopcraft, a media director for Californians Against Initiative Fraud, a 
coalition opposing Proposition 136, said his campaign has done no polling but 
"it makes sense" that confusion over the ballot would spark a voter rebellion. 
Proposition 136, a measure sponsored by anti-tax groups but financed by the 
alcohol industry, would require a two-thirds vote on taxes earmarked for a 
special purpose. If approved, it could nullify the passage of Proposition 134. 
</P>
<P>
"The conventional wisdom would support those findings that confused voters will 
vote no, and these certainly are confused voters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Hopcraft and McElroy said any across-the-board vote against the 
initiatives would be a victory for industries and special interests even though 
their own countermeasures would go down in the process.

VAN DE KAMP SHIFTS INTO ROLE OF LAME DUCK ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The candidate was 10 minutes late for his press conference and television 
cameramen were fiddling with their lenses. Hot dog-chomping reporters 
impatiently eyed their watches. Leaders of a dozen state and local law 
enforcement groups nervously memorized their sound bites. Then, out of his 
Wilshire Boulevard office tower sprang Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
Surveying the familiar scene, the two-term prosecutor grinned sheepishly and 
waved at the crowd -- which had nothing to do with his presence. Then he walked 
down the block to lunch while the newsmen continued to wait for the arrival of 
Arlo Smith, the Democratic contender to succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
A few short months ago, Van de Kamp, 54, was the odds-on favorite for the 
Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Spotlights focused on his youthful face. 
Reporters dogged his cautious footsteps. Microphones amplified his every 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
But since his sound defeat by Dianne Feinstein in last June's toughly fought 
primary, Van de Kamp has faded into the background of California politics. 
</P>
<P>
The lame-duck prosecutor, who leaves public office in January, says he is 
spending much of his time preparing the state Department of Justice for his 
successor -- San Francisco Dist. Atty. Smith or former Republican Rep. Dan 
Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
"The focus has been first of all on the office -- to make sure we are in as 
good shape as we can be," said Van de Kamp, following the dedication of the 
Ronald Reagan state office building in downtown Los Angeles last week. "We've 
had major hits this year on the budget so we've had to do a lot of internal 
adjustments," he said. "It's a busy time. I was in Sacramento Tuesday, San 
Diego yesterday and now I'm here today." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp has also been working, primarily behind the scenes, to help fellow 
Democrats Feinstein and Smith, and to win passage of three ballot propositions 
that he had once hoped would propel him into the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, his real legacy is less likely to come from his failed campaign 
than from his sponsorship of the ballot measures -- Proposition 128, the 
so-called "Big Green" environmental initiative; Proposition 129, which 
authorizes drug enforcement funding and clarifies constitutional rights to 
reproductive choice; and Proposition 131, which would limit elected officials' 
terms while establishing public campaign financing. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's generally low-key public role has included speeches before 
partisan crowds, meetings with newspaper editorial boards, and fund-raising 
phone calls. In recent weeks, he has also made a public appearance for Smith in 
San Diego and attended a $1,000-a-plate Democratic Party unity dinner with 
Feinstein and Smith in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing anything really that they've asked," he asserted, "within the 
bounds of reason." 
</P>
<P>
In a year dominated by negative campaigning, Van de Kamp predicts that the 
tightly contested race between Feinstein and Republican Sen. Pete Wilson could 
still be won by whomever chooses the opposite tack during the final days. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're in the period now where an elevating inspirational message that 
gets us out of the rut of this back-and-forth negative stuff since the summer 
might lift either campaign (to victory)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the same breath, Van de Kamp adds that Smith's best chance to succeed him as 
attorney general lies with loudly attacking Lungren's conservative views. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really going to be dependent on television commercials," Van de Kamp 
said. "Smith has a good chance of winning if he can better establish in the 
public's mind Lungren's negatives such as his anti-choice views (on abortion), 
his support of pro-oil positions and his lack of institutional prosecutorial 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp expressed his thoughts after taking a tour of the new Reagan 
Building, where his successor will set up a Southern California satellite 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty good view -- a little bit of everything from (St. Vibiana's) 
church to Dodger Stadium," said Van de Kamp, as he strode through the 
still-incomplete quarters with an impressively credentialed tour party. 
</P>
<P>
"I like this hallway, but the one on the other side is a little bleak," he 
confided to famed sculptor Robert Graham. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's concern about nuts-and-bolts matters extends to the future of the 
attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Smith nor Lungren, he says, have focused on programs he considers his 
major achievements: the introduction of such technological breakthroughs as DNA 
analysis in crime fighting, and the beefing up of the office's consumer 
protection, civil rights and antitrust enforcement programs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his crushing loss last June, Van de Kamp said he has no regrets about 
having given up the prosecutor's post for a shot at the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to erase any element of bitterness from my psyche," he said. "I tried 
to just get rid of any taint of that at the time of election night . . . Now 
that's done and I look on." 
</P>
<P>
To what end is not yet clear. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in public life for 30 years," the former Los Angeles County district 
attorney and federal public defender said. "I've had a very good run and I'm 
very grateful for the opportunities that I've had. Now it's time to make a 
change. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking at law, business, foundations, some educational kinds of things . 
. . You know I could be in nonprofits, working with nonprofit boards (while) 
keeping active as a private citizen in the politics of my party. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to make a Sherman-like statement," he concluded. "But I'm not 
leaving public office with the thought that I'm just waiting for the next brass 
ring to grab . . . I do not intend to run for election, certainly with respect 
to the United States Senate or anything else."

SOME WEALTHY STILL ESCAPE INCOME TAX

Despite repeated government efforts to close loopholes, some wealthy Americans 
are still able to scrape together enough deductions to avoid paying any U.S. 
income tax, the Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Of 557,848 couples and individuals who reported income of $200,000 or more on 
returns filed in 1988, 472 with total income of $211 million paid no income 
tax. Two of them, both unidentified, even reported receiving unemployment 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular deduction was for interest paid, which exceeded income on 29 
of the 472 no-tax returns. Income was exceeded by deductions for theft, fire 
and other casualty losses on 12 returns. 
</P>
<P>
Of the high-income people who paid taxes, about 9,300 paid less than 5%. 
Another 17,082 reduced their liability to less than 10%, which is about the 
same as paid by the average $35,000-a-year family. 
</P>
<P>
In its annual report on the tax liabilities of high-income people, the IRS said 
58% of those with income of $200,000 and up reported capital gains -- profits 
from the sale of investments -- that averaged $384,476. By comparison, salaries 
averaged $291,646. 
</P>
<P>
The study, prepared principally by Allen H. Lerman of the Treasury Department's 
Office of Tax Analysis, is based on raw tax returns. Some of the non-taxpayers 
could be moved onto the tax rolls after IRS audits. 
</P>
<P>
The report said 3,396 people with high incomes would have avoided federal 
income taxes altogether had it not been for the alternative minimum tax. This 
levy -- a special net designed to ensure that high-income people pay some tax 
regardless of how many legitimate deductions they claim -- cost 35,223 top 
earners a total of $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
However, the reach of the minimum tax plunged from the previous year, when the 
levy took $4.8 billion from 158,903 high-income filers. 
</P>
<P>
One of the provisions Congress wrote into a major deficit-reduction bill last 
week to raise the tax burden on the rich boosts the 21% rate of the minimum tax 
to 24%. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, the number of tax-free rich people has been only a tiny 
fraction of the wealthy. The most recent IRS report showed the 557,848 
taxpayers in the $200,000-and-over group paid a total $72.7 billion, an average 
of $130,276 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The report said 381 high-income people who paid no tax claimed itemized 
deductions totaling $161.3 million, an average of $423,000.

DEADWOOD, S.D. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The take has surpassed everyone's expectations in the year since slot machines 
and card games became legal in this Black Hills town where Wild Bill Hickok was 
gunned down in an 1876 poker game. 
</P>
<P>
Actors dressed as Hickok and Calamity Jane will fire guns on Main Street at 
noon today to celebrate the first anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
A statewide vote in 1988 amended the South Dakota Constitution to authorize 
gambling in Deadwood. The Legislature limited bets to $5. 
</P>
<P>
State and city officials had estimated that Deadwood's share of gambling taxes 
and license fees would provide the city with about $500,000 a year to restore 
aging buildings. But the city has received $6.2 million as its cut of the first 
year's action. 
</P>
<P>
Gambling taxes have also contributed nearly $786,000 to the state and more than 
$196,000 to Lawrence County. 
</P>
<P>
During the first 11 months, players wagered more than $253 million and about 75 
gaming houses were licensed. Don Gromer, executive secretary of the state 
Gaming Commission, said officials had expected only about 20 gaming halls. 
</P>
<P>
The gambling industry has created about 1,400 jobs in Deadwood. Industry 
executives estimate that casinos have already spent more than $30 million to 
renovate historic downtown structures. 
</P>
<P>
Success has had its price, however. 
</P>
<P>
State and city officials have scrambled to keep tabs on the rapid growth, which 
has strained water and sewer systems in the narrow city built in a canyon. 
Retail stores have nearly disappeared from Main Street as buildings have been 
converted into a long stretch of casinos to handle crowds of gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
Success has also brought a faster-paced lifestyle to what was a quiet, 
uncrowded town. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bruce Oberlander said many people are upset that it is no longer easy to 
find motel rooms, parking spots and uncrowded bars when they visit Deadwood. 
But they do not realize that the businesses were struggling to survive before 
gambling, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin Hotel owner Bill Walsh said people who mourn the loss of the old 
Deadwood are holding a wake for the wrong corpse. The city's best period was 
the boom times of the frontier or the early years of this century, not the 
recent years.

Firefighters smothered blazes scattered throughout the city late Tuesday and 
early Wednesday as thousands of volunteers walked the streets to deter 
arsonists on Devil's Night, Detroit's annual Halloween eve fire spree. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials refused to say how many blazes they fought, but some volunteers 
said they believed there were fewer than last year. 
</P>
<P>
Police said arrests for violating a 6 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew were down by more 
than a third. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters and thousands of block-watchers remained on guard Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Fire and police officials on Wednesday refused to discuss the number of fires 
set. Mayor Coleman Young said the number would be a revealed a news conference 
today or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the mayor's office reported 223 fires Oct. 29-31, 115 of those on 
Devil's Night. The firefighters union, however, said there were more than 400 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
Reuters reported that the practice apparently had spread to Flint, Mich., 50 
miles north of Detroit, with about 130 fires reported late Tuesday and early 
Wednesday. The city called in four suburban fire departments for help.

ARAB SUMMIT PLAN REJECTED BY MUBARAK;

<P>
DIPLOMACY: NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT, EGYPTIAN LEADER SAYS OF THE SOVIET INITIATIVE 
ON IRAQ.

<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Wednesday rebuffed Soviet proposals for a 
meeting of Arab leaders to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis and warned that the 
situation in the gulf "could explode at any time." 
</P>
<P>
As three key Arab foreign ministers met in Saudi Arabia to discuss the crisis, 
the Egyptian president downplayed Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
suggestion this week that Iraq might be agreeable to an "inter-Arab meeting" to 
settle the issue, saying there are still no specific peace proposals to 
discuss. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev called for Arab nations to embark on a new initiative to resolve the 
crisis peacefully, suggesting that the Iraqis "could be ready" for such a 
settlement. "If we were to have an inter-Arab meeting, this would be the 
quickest way to a settlement," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
But in the first official Arab reaction to the proposal, Mubarak noted that 
Arab leaders had convened in August but were unable to resolve the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"The Arab countries have tried a lot, and we're still trying. If these 
proposals call for a peaceful solution, then it should be borne in mind that 
there isn't a big or small country, Arab or Western, which doesn't want a 
peaceful solution," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to ask if the Soviet envoy managed to reach something definite, 
so we can hold an Arab summit to discuss something specific. We have not been 
told of it. If we are going to call an Arab summit while there is no clear 
vision, it will be a summit of insults. We reject summits of insults." 
</P>
<P>
Egypt's semiofficial Al Ahram newspaper, in a front-page editorial, echoed 
Mubarak's sentiments and said any discussions of another Arab League meeting 
would simply help Iraq stall for time. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's call for an Arab solution was an attempt to disguise Soviet envoy 
Yevgeny Primakov's failure to come up with a resolution to the crisis during 
his recent Middle East tour, wrote Al Ahram's editor in chief, Ibrahim Nafeh, a 
confidant of Mubarak. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union attempts to cover the failure . . . to absolve itself of 
responsibility for a solution, and it casts all the blame on new parties which 
have no key to the solution," Nafeh wrote. "It is only an attempt to prolong 
the crisis and clear the way for the only remaining solution, the military 
option, which is a devastating option that will only bring catastrophe to the 
Arabs." 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak warned of the consequences of failing to achieve a peaceful resolution 
to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that our brothers in Iraq will understand completely the situation is 
very dangerous and could explode at any time," he asserted. "Iraq should not 
take lightly such a force in the gulf, because Iraq will suffer great damage. 
We too will suffer." 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak went on to say that Arab leaders realize that "Iraq is in a difficult 
position, but we are willing to help it after it accepts withdrawal and the 
return of legitimacy." 
</P>
<P>
The hint of conciliation echoed remarks last week by Saudi Arabia's defense 
minister, Prince Sultan ibn Abdulaziz, suggesting that Arab leaders might be 
willing to consider Iraq's territorial claims against Kuwait in the aftermath 
of an unconditional pullout of Iraqi troops. 
</P>
<P>
There have been unconfirmed reports that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein might 
be willing to withdraw his troops northward to a point that would allow him to 
keep key islands with access to the gulf and to acquire a disputed oil field 
along the Iraq-Kuwait border. Arab leaders in recent days have continued to 
insist on a full and unconditional withdrawal but are also suggesting that Iraq 
might find support for its territorial claims later. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Iraq . . . helps along the withdrawal," Mubarak said, "and 
negotiations can be started to look into Iraq's claims." 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's comments came as Egypt's foreign minister, Esmat Abdel Meguid, flew 
to Jidda, Saudi Arabia, to meet with his Syrian and Saudi counterparts to 
discuss the crisis in the gulf. The three countries are the key power brokers 
in the Arab alliance formed to combat the Iraqi invasion, and both Syria and 
Egypt have dispatched troops to Saudi Arabia to join the U.S. and multinational 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III is scheduled to fly to Saudi Arabia 
on Sunday to begin a tour of the Middle East that will also include stops in 
Bahrain, Egypt and Turkey.

The international embargo against Iraqi oil exports is costing Baghdad about

NICARAGUA FIRES AUTHOR OF ITS ECONOMIC PLAN FROM CENTRAL BANK POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

MANAGUA, Nicaragua 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Francisco Mayorga, the Yale-educated monetarist who forged an ambitious 
economic recovery plan for Nicaragua's new pro-American government and 
shouldered much of the blame for its continuing hardships, has been dismissed 
as president of the Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The government announced Wednesday that Mayorga had resigned Tuesday to return 
to teaching. But the economist made it clear at a news conference that he was 
forced out over policy differences with other presidential advisers. He said 
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro had asked all five members of her 
economic team to offer their resignations three weeks ago and had accepted only 
his. 
</P>
<P>
"My positions were different from those of the majority of the economic 
Cabinet," Mayorga said Wednesday. "I believe that President Chamorro and 
Antonio Lacayo (her chief of staff) wanted a team that was more executive and 
less theoretical." 
</P>
<P>
Mayorga, 39, helped Chamorro upset Nicaragua's revolutionary Sandinista 
leadership at the polls by promising to help her whip hyper-inflation within 
100 days. His departure, with inflation on the decline but still running at 30% 
for October, was the first Cabinet shake-up since she took office six months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Lacayo, a Central Bank vice president, was named to replace Mayorga. 
</P>
<P>
The shake-up came four days after a wide-ranging agreement between Chamorro's 
government and the still-powerful Sandinista labor movement over how to share 
the burden of reviving this impoverished country's war-battered economy. 
</P>
<P>
Aimed at defusing Sandinista-led labor unrest that has unsettled the new 
government, the agreement was shaped by a team of government advisers in which 
Mayorga played a minor role. Some of its provisions appear incompatible with 
Mayorga's pet project -- the gradual introduction of a new national currency 
called the gold cordoba and its permanent pegging to the dollar at a 1-to-1 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
Since it was first circulated in August, the gold cordoba has replaced one 
fifth of Nicaragua's $50-million money supply. To protect it from inflationary 
ravages that have stripped the old cordoba of 90% of its value since May, 
Mayorga had moved to introduce the new currency gradually. 
</P>
<P>
But his plan was widely criticized as too radical. 
</P>
<P>
The government's agreement with the unions, reached after five weeks of 
negotiations, calls for a quicker conversion to the gold cordoba and for an 
exchange policy boosting competitive exports.

TEMPLE-MOSQUE DISPUTE KILLS 31 MORE IN INDIA

<P>
At least 31 more people were killed Wednesday in religious violence in India 
over attempts by Hindu militants to tear down a mosque and replace it with a 
temple. 
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India news agency said 16 people were killed at the Ayodhya 
mosque in northern Uttar Pradesh state. 
</P>
<P>
More than 70 people have died nationwide since Tuesday in clashes between 
Hindus and Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
India sent paramilitary reinforcements to the site and no one was allowed 
within 200 yards after battles Tuesday between the militants and security 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic news agencies reported that six people were killed and 200 injured in 
the central city of Indore in religious rioting in which people used guns and 
bombs. Four others were killed in the western state of Gujarat, three in 
Karnataka, and one each in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, both states in the 
south. 
</P>
<P>
About 700 shouting militants led by naked Hindu holy men, their bodies smeared 
with sacred ash, managed to reach the 16th-Century mosque Tuesday and caused 
minor damage before police cleared them out. 
</P>
<P>
The dusty streets of the town of 50,000 people and 3,000 temples were virtually 
deserted Wednesday. Muslim leaders were relieved that the mosque was not 
seriously damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, dozens of towns were under curfew and militant Hindus called strikes 
to back their campaign to build a temple on what they say is the birthplace of 
the god, Ram. 
</P>
<P>
India has 100 million Muslims in its overwhelmingly Hindu population of 850 
million.

MILITANT SOVIET MOLDOVANS BESIEGE BORDER POSTS;

<P>
ETHNIC UNREST: FRICTION IN THE SOUTHWESTERN REPUBLIC BALLOONS INTO A REVOLT 
AGAINST COMMUNIST RULE.

Moldovan militants by the thousands besieged checkpoints on the Soviet-Romanian 
frontier Wednesday and threatened to massacre KGB border guards as an ethnic 
quarrel in the southwestern Soviet Union ballooned into revolt against 
Communist rule, reports from state-run media said. 
</P>
<P>
"People are destroying Lenin monuments and hate everything associated with the 
Soviet Union, Soviet army and Communist Party," Yuri Roshka, first deputy 
chairman of the Popular Front, a grass-roots organization, reported from 
Moldova's capital of Kishinev. "A mass campaign against the Communist Party is 
well under way." 
</P>
<P>
Although reports from Roshka and other Moldovan nationalists could not be 
independently confirmed and journalists were barred from southern areas of the 
republic, Soviet media including Pravda confirmed sieges and seizures of party 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
Although no large-scale acts of violence were reported, events over the past 24 
hours in the largely agricultural land where more than 4 million people live 
marked the latest breakdown of Soviet authority and the Communist Party's 
standing in society. 
</P>
<P>
"One clear aim is noticeable behind these and other similar instances of 
flagrant lawlessness, namely, to excite anti-Communist hysteria to the limit," 
V. Tsyra of the Moldovan Communist Party's Central Committee staff warned. 
</P>
<P>
Matters came to a boil in Moldova last Thursday when a 150,000-member ethnic 
minority, the Gagauz, began unauthorized elections to create a parliament for 
their own separate state, which they proclaimed in August after complaining of 
discrimination by Moldovans. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting swiftly, the nationalist leaders who took power in Kishinev earlier 
this year nullified the elections and proclaimed a state of emergency. The 
Kremlin agreed to a request from both sides and dispatched heavily armed 
Interior Ministry troops to keep the peace. 
</P>
<P>
However, many Moldovans, finally free to utter nationalist demands after 
decades of repression, accused President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Moscow of 
blatantly favoring the "Gagauz extremists." More than 30 busloads of 
discontented nationalists set out for the Prut River that marks the 
Soviet-Romanian boundary, the Popular Front reported. 
</P>
<P>
Before sunrise, more than 3,000 nationalists surrounded border checkpoints at 
Goteshty and Stoyanovka to demand the withdrawal of two regiments of Soviet 
Interior Ministry troops patrolling the Gagauz area and their replacement by 
Moldovan police, the official Tass news agency reported. Interfax, an 
independent news service, said as many as 7,000 Moldovans took part. 
</P>
<P>
At Stoyanovka, crowds showered the checkpoint with rocks and burned down the 
fence that surrounded it, Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
"The blockaders threatened to annihilate the personnel and their families and 
to 'wipe the posts from the Earth,' " it reported, quoting officials of the 
elite KGB unit that guards the Soviet border. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters also threatened to cross into Romania to seek assistance there. 
Moldovans and Romanians share a common language and heritage, and Moldova -- 
officially called Moldavia until last summer -- was part of Romania until the 
Kremlin annexed it in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
When news of the rampage along the frontier reached Kishinev, a helicopter 
whisked First Deputy Premier Konstantin Oborok and other top officials to the 
scene, where they opened talks with the militants, Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
Late last week, as many as 40,000 Moldovans, calling themselves "volunteers," 
streamed to the borders of the Gagauz area to challenge the minority group's 
independence claim, and reports reaching Moscow indicated that as they return 
home, they are focusing their hostility on the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
In Kishinev, returnees held a mass rally to demand that the Communist Party 
cease being "the hand of Moscow on Moldovan territory. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the uneasy dialogue that began last week between Gagauz 
secessionists and Moldovan regime was institutionalized with the setting up of 
a "bilateral conciliatory commission." 
</P>
<P>
Moldova's Gagauz are Turkic-speaking Orthodox Christians whose ancestors fled 
from northeastern Bulgaria to present-day Moldova to escape Ottoman rule during 
and after the Russo-Turkish war of 1806-1812.

Ad: When Pete Wilson was in Sacramento, he voted for the largest tax increase 
in California history. 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: The ad refers to a 1967 vote on taxes by then-Assemblyman Wilson 
during Ronald Reagan's tenure as governor. The bill increased taxes by $1 
billion, by raising income, sales, bank and sin taxes. It was the largest at 
the time, but has since been surpassed. The ad does not mention that Wilson 
also has repeatedly opposed tax hikes while in the U.S. Senate, most recently 
last month when he bucked President Bush and the Republican leadership by 
voting against the budget compromise that raised taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: When he was mayor, he made a $2.3-billion fiscal mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: The wording, which is misleading, refers to Wilson's decision not to 
build a secondary treatment system for the city's wastes. During Wilson's time 
as mayor, the plant would have cost $500 million. If constructed now, the 
system would cost nearly $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: Under Pete Wilson, San Diego's violent crime rates doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: According to FBI statistics, crime in San Diego did rise while Wilson 
was mayor. Violent crime went up more than 115%, murders up 56% and rapes more 
than doubled. Wilson has not argued the numbers. But he has noted that San 
Diego, even with the crime increase, was still a safer city than San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "He's been in Washington eight years, and now Pete Wilson has the worst 
attendance record in the U.S. Senate. Pete Wilson -- he doesn't want change -- 
he just wants to change jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: The lines are an attempt to take advantage of voter antipathy toward 
incumbents and a desire among Californians to have "change" in the state. The 
accusation that Wilson has the worst attendance record is a generalization of 
Wilson's recent record. 
</P>
<P>
As of late October, he had voted only 76% of the time this year, according to 
Congressional Quarterly -- the worst in the Senate. His voting record has been 
much better in past years, but he has not been among the best in the Senate in 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
The second ad is entitled "Break." 
</P>
<P>
Ad: Who's on your side in taxes? Not career politician Pete Wilson. As an 
assemblyman, Wilson voted for the largest California tax increase ever -- 
raising income taxes and sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: As noted above, the line refers to Wilson's vote in support of a 1967 
tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: As mayor, Wilson pushed for taxes, and city spending more than doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: The line is misleading. While Wilson did push for hikes in the hotel 
tax and once suggested he might have to turn to a city income tax, property 
taxes fell 25% during his tenure. City spending more than doubled, but that was 
at a time when the population was increasing and inflation was booming. When 
inflation and population growth were taken into account, city spending dropped 
while Wilson was mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: But Wilson isn't always for taxes, like when he votes for tax breaks for 
millionaires or lobbies for a $50-million tax break for Unocal Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: The ad refers to tax benefits Wilson has tried to secure for the 
movie industry, his vote against a windfall profits tax for oil companies and 
his vote for a reduction in capital gains taxes. In the first incident, Wilson 
has said he was trying to help out the movie industry, which employs 
Californians. In the other cases, Wilson was voting along the Republican line. 
The Unocal reference is to a 1986 Wilson measure that tried to give the company 
a tax break. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: Don't read his lips. 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: The last line is a reference to President Bush's "read my lips -- no 
new taxes" line. The ad implies that Wilson would abandon his stand on taxes, 
as Bush did in supporting the recent federal budget compromise. The ad does not 
say that Wilson voted against that compromise, on the grounds that it raised 
taxes more than necessary.

SMITH AD SEEKS TO LINK LUNGREN TO S&amp;L SCANDAL

<P>
Seeking to capitalize on public revulsion over the savings and loan scandal, 
Democratic state attorney general candidate Arlo Smith Wednesday unveiled a 
last-minute campaign radio ad accusing his Republican foe, Dan Lungren, of 
involvement in the massive financial debacle. 
</P>
<P>
The sixty-second ad, which Lungren's campaign swiftly labeled a "desperation 
tactic by a failing candidate," charges that the former five-term congressman 
"has accepted thousands of dollars in contributions from people under criminal 
investigation . . . and he won't give the money back." 
</P>
<P>
The reference is to campaign contributions of approximately $4,000 that Lungren 
has received from S&amp;L-related sources including GOP fund-raiser Karl M. 
Samuelian, who is under investigation by the Sacramento County district 
attorney's office in connection with the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan failure. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's ad also cites a 1986 letter signed by Lungren to Edwin Gray, then the 
nation's top thrift regulator, which Gray said last month was apparently 
written on behalf of Lincoln's owner, Charles H. Keating Jr. Smith's ad does 
not make clear that the letter was actually drafted by another congressman, 
Charles Pashayan (R-Fresno), and then signed by 16 Republican congressmen 
including Lungren and now-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
The Smith ad continues: "The ethical standards of California's next attorney 
general must be beyond question. Dan Lungren's aren't." 
</P>
<P>
In reply, Lungren spokesman David Puglia said: "It's appropriate that Arlo is 
trying to fool the voters of the state on Halloween. In ten years in Congress, 
nobody ever questioned Dan Lungren's integrity." 
</P>
<P>
The Lungren campaign also labeled San Francisco Dist. Atty. Smith hypocritical 
for having accepted $10,000 in campaign contributions from Sen. Alan Cranston's 
political action organization, The Committee for a Democratic Consensus. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Ethics Committee has scheduled public hearings this month on ties 
between Keating and five senators, including Cranston. The senators, who 
received $1.3-million in contributions from Keating for their campaigns and 
causes, reportedly intervened with thrift regulators on behalf of the 
high-flying thrift owner. 
</P>
<P>
"The only treat Arlo will receive for Halloween is the $10,000 from Alan 
Cranston," said Puglia. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren's name first surfaced in the savings and loan scandal with the 
disclosure last month of the 1986 congressional letter to former Federal Home 
Loan Bank Board Chairman Gray. 
</P>
<P>
Although the letter did not specifically refer to Lincoln Savings, Gray told 
reporters that it appeared to have been a poorly disguised attempt to pass 
confidential information to the Orange County-based thrift about possible 
federal actions to tighten controls over it. 
</P>
<P>
Gray said he believed that in signing the letter, Lungren, Cheney and other 
congressmen "allowed themselves to be duped and used by people like Charlie 
Keating" and that they "certainly have to take responsibility for what they 
signed." 
</P>
<P>
Keating is awaiting trial in Los Angeles on securities fraud charges in 
connection with the sale of junk bonds through the now-bankrupt thrift, whose 
failure could cost taxpayers more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren, who is neck-in-neck in the polls with Smith, has said he signed the 
letter as a favor to Pashayan and had no knowledge it dealt with Lincoln 
Savings. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Lungren received a $500 contribution from Lincoln's parent company, 
American Continental Corp., for a litigation fund he had set up while 
challenging the state Senate's rejection of his selection to the post of state 
treasurer by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren's campaign has also received $2,250 from Samuelian, who has served as 
campaign finance chairman for Deukmejian, and $1,600 from former state 
Commissioner of Corporations Franklin Tom. The two attorneys are partners in a 
Los Angeles law firm which recently agreed to pay up to $14.3 million to settle 
class-action lawsuits filed against it by 22,000 individuals who bought 
now-worthless junk bonds from Lincoln Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Tom and Samuelian are under investigation for possible criminal or civil 
wrongdoing in connection with a probe of Lincoln Savings.

GUT-WRENCHING TV COMMERCIAL USES CANCER VICTIMS

<P>
The Proposition 128 campaign began airing a gut-wrenching television commercial 
Wednesday that features two cancer victims, one of them a bald, 4-year-old girl 
who tells viewers, "I can't vote but you can." 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the environmental initiative hope the emotional appeal from actress 
Tracy Nelson, who stars in television's "Father Dowling's Mysteries," and 
little Colette Chuda will provide the boost they need to win the election 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I had cancer three years ago. Believe me, you don't want it," says Nelson, 26, 
who was diagnosed with Hodgkins disease in 1987. "Proposition 128 gets rid of 
cancer-causing chemicals in our air, food and water." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 128, called "Big Green" by supporters and "The Hayden Initiative" 
by opponents, would prohibit the use of at least 25 cancer-causing pesticides, 
among its many provisions. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who lost her spleen, liver and most of her lung capacity to cancer, 
told reporters at a press conference that Hodgkins disease and many other forms 
of cancer are induced by environmental factors and could be prevented by 
eliminating known cancer-causing pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a laboratory animal so there's no way to really know if what I had was 
directly from a specific chemical, but I do know that Hodgkin's disease is 
thought to be environmentally induced," Nelson said. Hodgkin's disease is a 
cancerous disorder of so-called lymphoid tissues found mainly in the lymph 
nodes and spleen. The cause of the disease is not known. Although clusters of 
cases have been reported, there is no clear evidence of an environmental cause, 
scientists say. It can be treated with radiation, chemotherapy and anti-cancer 
drugs, and can be cured if caught early. 
</P>
<P>
Collete was diagnosed with the rare Wilms' tumor last May and has undergone 
surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, causing her to lose her hair. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the ad, opponents of Proposition 128 urged voters to put aside 
their emotions and reject the measure because it is too costly and will not 
make the environment any safer. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, cancer is an incredible personal tragedy and a horrible event that 
has befallen many Californians," said Scott Macdonald, a spokesman for the 
opposition campaign. "But Proposition 128 is not the answer to our cancer 
problems and not the answer to our environmental problems." 
</P>
<P>
The 30-second ad featuring Nelson -- the daughter of singer Rick Nelson and the 
granddaughter of Ozzie and Harriet Nelson -- attempts to counter the theme of 
the industry-backed opposition campaign that the initiative is too expensive.

BILL SEEKS TO FORCE NAVY TO LEASE LAND TO SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A measure passed shortly before Congress adjourned last weekend seeks to force 
the Navy to lease half of Hunters Point Naval Shipyard to the city of San 
Francisco -- over the Navy's objection and to its apparent surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said Thursday that she sponsored the brief 
amendment to the massive Defense Authorization Act partly in an attempt to end 
an effort by the Navy to evict 300 artists and small business operators who 
have been leasing studio and work space at the shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we just have to make the Navy do it," Pelosi said. Her measure will 
require the Navy to enter into negotiations with the city for a 30-year lease 
on at least 260 acres of shipyard land. The amendment says the deal must be 
struck within a year. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement to the House Armed Services Committee, the Navy 
expressed its opposition to Pelosi's amendment, noting that such a lease "could 
preempt" other uses that are "now under review." 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly haven't designated any property for lease. We're still looking at 
the legislation," said Randal A. Friedman, a Navy employee in charge of 
coordinating the restoration of naval bases slated for closure in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Artists and business owners, ranging from painting contractors to a mushroom 
farmer, set up shop and studios in space leased from the Navy after it 
abandoned barracks and most other buildings at Hunters Point in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy began trying to evict the tenants in the mid-1980s when it had hopes 
of basing a flotilla of warships at Hunters Point, which is at the southern end 
of San Francisco. The home-porting scheme was abandoned, although the Navy 
maintained its position that it wanted the commercial tenants out. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy continues to operate repair facilities at the shipyard, and has 
embarked on a major cleanup of toxins that were dumped and spilled over the 
decades. Pelosi's amendment allows the Navy to continue its ship-maintenance 
operations at the base. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a major breakthrough in bringing the Navy to the table to sit with us 
and plan what is going to happen on almost 300 acres of Navy property," Mayor 
Art Agnos said at the press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Agnos said that he expects ship repairs to continue at the shipyard and that 
the amendment will "protect the artists and provide other economic development 
opportunities" to his city.

CRANE TOPPLES ON VENTURA FREEWAY; 
</P>
<P>
TRAFFIC: THE EASTBOUND LANES ARE TIED UP FOR SEVERAL HOURS AFTER THE EARLY 
MORNING ACCIDENT. NO MOTORISTS ARE INJURED.

A construction crane fell over on the Ventura Freeway early Wednesday, dumping 
a boom arm and a five-ton slab of concrete onto a transition road below and 
turning the already sluggish freeway into a virtual parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The transition road, connecting the eastbound Ventura Freeway to the southbound 
San Diego Freeway, was closed at the time for work on the Ventura Freeway 
improvement project. Although some traffic lanes on the Ventura were open to 
the right of the crane, it fell to the left, away from traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Crane operator David Loyd suffered minor cuts and bruises when the device 
toppled as it moved the concrete barrier into place at the interchange with the 
San Diego Freeway about 4:50 a.m. No one else was injured. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first major mishap on the freeway improvement project, Caltrans 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
They said crews were installing new guard rails on the freeway interchange -- 
work that required the closure of one eastbound lane and several transition 
roads between midnight and 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the accident, the crane was replacing 20-foot temporary concrete 
barriers. Crews already had replaced 15 to 20 of the barriers and were 
scheduled to reopen the closed freeway lanes and transition roads as soon as 
the final barrier was in place, said Jim McAllister, Caltrans resident engineer 
for the improvement project. 
</P>
<P>
But the crane, which was in a closed traffic lane, tipped and rolled onto its 
side. It remained unclear late Wednesday what caused the large crane to topple, 
Caltrans officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Weighed down by the concrete barrier, the arm of the crane fell onto the closed 
transition road. 
</P>
<P>
McAllister said the crane was prevented from falling over the side of the 
freeway by its arm, which bent when it hit the pavement 15 to 20 feet below. 
</P>
<P>
The accident was a major headache for hundreds of early morning commuters on 
the Ventura Freeway who found themselves trapped in traffic backed up more than 
five miles. 
</P>
<P>
The accident, which is under investigation by state safety authorities, closed 
several transition roads between the freeways for as long as four hours. All 
eastbound lanes of the Ventura Freeway were closed for about 15 minutes as 
workers righted the crane about 8:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic on the San Diego Freeway moved surprisingly fast, apparently because 
many motorists heard news of the accident and used surface streets. 
Consequently, city streets were overwhelmed with a crush of motorists looking 
for a speedier way to work. 
</P>
<P>
They were disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Intersections were snarled and traffic inched along major streets running 
parallel to both freeways. Eastbound traffic on Ventura Boulevard was jammed 
from the San Diego Freeway to Louise Avenue about two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mess," said Los Angeles police Officer Clarence Dean, part of a 
contingent dispatched to direct traffic. 
</P>
<P>
All freeway lanes and transition roads were reopened by 9 a.m. and normal 
traffic flow was restored about 30 minutes later, California Highway Patrol 
Officer Jayne Suits said. 
</P>
<P>
The crane involved in the accident is owned by the Tutor-Saliba Corp., which is 
under contract with the California Department of Transportation for the 
$62-million project to widen the Ventura and Hollywood freeways from Universal 
City to Agoura Hills. When the project is completed in early 1992, the two 
freeways will be 10 lanes wide between Lankershim and Topanga Canyon 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Scarrot, Tutor-Saliba vice president of equipment operations, said the 
company will investigate the accident. A spokesman for the California 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration said his office also will 
investigate. 
</P>
<P>
McAllister of Caltrans apologized for the delays. 
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to what many people may think of Caltrans, we do not go out there and 
purposefully try to jam freeways," he said.

2 HOLLYWOOD PROJECTS WANT CRA FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT: BUILDERS OF THE RENEWAL CORNERSTONES FORMERLY SAID NO PUBLIC 
MONEY WOULD BE NEEDED. NEGOTIATIONS ARE UNDER WAY. 
</P>

After vowing to build two mammoth commercial, residential and entertainment 
complexes without a penny of taxpayer money, developers of the cornerstone 
projects in the $1-billion Hollywood renewal effort are seeking as much as $140 
million in redevelopment subsidies to keep their projects alive, The Times has 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Community Redevelopment Agency has begun closed-door negotiations 
with the development firms, Melvin Simon &amp; Associates and 
Hollywood/Highland Partners, according to city officials and sources familiar 
with the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the companies say they need the cash infusion for the hotels, 
offices, apartments, shops and theaters planned for Hollywood Boulevard because 
they have been squeezed financially by the savings and loan crisis, a looming 
recession and other factors. The projects will cost an estimated $300 million 
each. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Michael Woo confirmed Wednesday that the developers initially 
asked for about $70 million each, and that top city officials are negotiating 
with them to engineer a compromise that will keep the projects alive. Such a 
compromise would have to be approved by the CRA Board of Commissioners and the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Withdrawal by either developer, some city officials and Hollywood boosters say, 
would be a devastating setback to the city's much-criticized effort to restore 
Hollywood Boulevard and 1.7 square miles of Hollywood's blighted urban core to 
their former glory. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials and CRA Chairman Jim Wood confirmed that negotiations are 
under way but declined to discuss specifics. 
</P>
<P>
Wood described the two projects as the physical and psychological cornerstones 
of the redevelopment effort, which is expected to cost $922 million and take 30 
years to complete. He said the agency's response to the developers' demands 
will have repercussions on its dealings with all other developers involved in 
the renewal effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be one of the biggest decisions we make," Wood said. "I think it 
is going to set the tone for Hollywood for some period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Of particular concern is the fate of the Melvin Simon project, the 
much-ballyhooed Hollywood Promenade, which would create more than 1 million 
square feet of museums, offices, retail shops, movie theaters and a hotel in a 
glitzy package that would wrap around the landmark Mann's Chinese Theater and 
extend from Highland Avenue west to Orange Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The project has been in the works for more than five years, and a 
groundbreaking ceremony was held more than a year ago, but no construction has 
begun. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood/Highland project, meanwhile, calls for a 1.7-million-square-foot 
"urban village" with 1,000 apartment units, an office complex and retail stores 
just east of the Promenade, at the northeast corner of Hollywood and Highland 
Avenue. A principal investor in the project, Robert M. Bass, is a member of the 
wealthy Bass family of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials, such as Woo, say that there would be only temporary setbacks in 
the event of a developer's withdrawal, and that the city cannot be pressured by 
developers into giving away too much taxpayer money just to get them to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Expressing frustration at the negotiations, Woo said, "I am willing to announce 
the (Promenade) project dead if Simon insists on some level of subsidy more 
than we can provide. There is a limit to what we can afford." 
</P>
<P>
Both Wood and Woo said the redevelopment effort should provide subsidies when 
needed to jump-start important projects. "But it's not intended to be a 
giveaway," said Woo. "It's not intended to be a gift of public funds." 
</P>
<P>
"I would really like to see one or more of these projects move ahead," Woo 
said. "If they don't, we will find other ways to use these economic incentives 
to produce visible results in Hollywood in the short term." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, CRA Chairman Wood said the agency is considering using tax 
dollars to invest in the construction and operation of the underground parking 
portion of the Promenade project. Wood said such a partnership would allow the 
city to get involved with a lucrative and manageable part of the project 
without the liabilities and headaches of running a hotel or leasing office 
space. He would not comment on discussions with Hollywood/Highland, whose 
development plans are still in the conceptual stages. 
</P>
<P>
Wood lamented the requests for help, which come at a time when lawsuits against 
the redevelopment project have stymied the CRA's ability to generate funding 
for it. But he said such renegotiations and requests for public assistance 
often crop up in such renewal efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Since the renewal project was approved by the City Council in 1986, only one 
major commercial project has made progress: the Hollywood Galaxy retail and 
entertainment complex, which is expected to be completed by next summer. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Dubin, a vice president of Kornwasser &amp; Friedman, developers of the 
Galaxy, noted that his company did not receive any financial help from the CRA 
"at a time when such assistance would have been greatly appreciated." 
</P>
<P>
"If the (CRA) is willing to offer incentives to large developers," Dubin said, 
"they should also offer comparable incentives to small developers." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Marr, a vice president at Melvin Simon, said the request for help was 
made out of necessity. He said the developer began having problems with 
financing the Promenade project in January and at the same time found that 
there would be major cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are asking of the CRA is not different than what we have asked for, 
and received, from other cities across the country when we have done inner-city 
projects," Marr said. "In order to continue, we need assistance from the CRA, 
and we are optimistic they will provide it." 
</P>
<P>
Marr and a Hollywood/Highland official dismissed critics' contentions that they 
were taking advantage of a redevelopment agency desperate for their business. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the incipient recession, a major concern of developers is that urban 
blight seems to have cast an increasingly dark shadow on Hollywood since they 
first proposed their projects. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally all took a good hard look at the economic situation that exists in 
Hollywood today, and we understand more now that the rents in Hollywood don't 
support the type of development you need to make redevelopment successful," 
said an official of one of the two development firms, who asked not to be 
named. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood is an unproven market and it's been in decay for a lot of years," 
the official said. "You're going out on a limb in every aspect." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposed Hollywood Developments 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood Promenade project stretches from Highland west to Orange Drive on 
the north side of Hollywood Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The proposed Hollywood/Highland project is at the northeast corner of Hollywood 
Blvd. and Highland Ave.

DEVELOPER MAY CUT SIZE OF PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: AHMANSON LAND'S PRESIDENT SAYS HE IS WILLING TO CONSIDER SCALING 
DOWN PLANS FOR THE 5,477-ACRE SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After critics lashed his ranch project as too large and too damaging to the 
environment, the president of the Ahmanson Land Co. said Wednesday that there 
is a "good possibility" that he will cut the size of the proposed development. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen opponents criticized the Ahmanson Ranch project, which would 
include 3,000 houses and 238 acres of offices and stores, in the first public 
hearing on the development proposed for the rolling hills of southeastern 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony -- a litany of anticipated problems ranging from traffic jams to 
the loss of steelhead trout in Malibu Creek -- was offered to a committee of 
county officials who will decide whether the environmental report on the 
project satisfies state law. 
</P>
<P>
During the 3 1/2-hour hearing, Donald Brackenbush, president of Ahmanson Land, 
said of his 5,477-acre proposal: "Numerous people think it's too large, and 
that's something we're willing to discuss." 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, he said he thinks that "there's a good possibility" that he 
will reduce the size of the development before it makes it to the Planning 
Commission and Board of Supervisors next year. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors' final decision on the project, and on a proposal to build 750 
houses on nearby Jordan Ranch, is not expected until the spring at the 
earliest. The two projects are being considered jointly because of their 
proximity. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing on the Jordan environmental study is set for Wednesday. No decision 
will be made about either study until December. 
</P>
<P>
The county general plan does not permit development for either the Ahmanson or 
the Jordan project, so the county would have to find that their benefits 
justify amending it. 
</P>
<P>
The reports say the two projects would have "unavoidable, significant" impacts 
on air quality, traffic and the area's rural environment. 
</P>
<P>
Most speakers said the greatest impact of the Ahmanson project would be to 
create snarls at three intersections that would funnel traffic onto the Ventura 
Freeway. There would be virtual gridlock at the Valley Circle Boulevard, 
Crummer Canyon Road and Las Virgenes Road interchanges if the project is 
approved as proposed, they said. The interchanges are in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Brackenbush said that would happen even if his project is not built, based on 
projects already approved for the area. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus, in a prepared statement read by an 
aide, said the Ahmanson development would also funnel 70,000 vehicles a day 
onto Victory Boulevard, just across the county line from the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of a variety of Malibu-area organizations said the 
environmental study had not even considered the impact of the silt that will 
run off as 54 million cubic yards of dirt are graded during construction. 
</P>
<P>
The residue will flow into storm drains and eventually dump into Malibu Creek, 
harming the state's southernmost run of steelhead trout, they said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Ahmanson plan was not opposed by all. 
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 acres would be dedicated to park agencies and that is "a major 
positive," said David Brown, spokesman for the Las Virgenes Homeowners 
Federation, which represents 19 groups.

X-RAYS HELP ENSURE A SAFER HALLOWEEN

New to her Ventura neighborhood, Nena Doyle was playing it safe this Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
After her daughter, Deanna, made her trick-or-treat rounds, the pair stopped by 
the Community Memorial Hospital of San Buenaventura to have the goodies 
X-rayed. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a child in my class whose cousin got his throat cut on a piece of 
Halloween candy," said Doyle, a fifth-grade teacher at E.P. Foster Elementary 
in Ventura. "It really motivated me to have her candy checked out." 
</P>
<P>
Deanna, 8, dressed as a ballerina, added, "They X-ray the candy so we can see 
if it has any razor blades." Her candy checked out fine. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night marked the seventh year that the hospital has X-rayed Halloween 
candy to detect metallic objects. The free X-ray, which takes from 15 to 30 
seconds per bag of candy, requires very minimal radiation exposure, hospital 
representatives said. 
</P>
<P>
"An X-ray can't detect poison or glass. X-raying the candy doesn't absolve the 
parents from their responsibility to really check the candy," said Suzanne 
Brockman, director of marketing for the hospital, who added that it is 
difficult for an X-ray to detect foreign objects in foil-wrapped candy. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital gave 9,000 trick-or-treat bags to the Ventura Unified School 
District, which distributed them to elementary school children earlier this 
month. Each bag contained a parental consent form absolving the hospital from 
liability if candy that had been tampered with went undetected. 
</P>
<P>
With her four costumed children in tow, Donna Jaco visited the hospital for the 
annual candy X-ray. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be sure it's safe to eat," said Jaco, a nurse at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula Memorial Hospital also X-rayed candy Halloween night. The hospital 
also requires a parental consent form. STEPHANIE STASSEL

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JURORS HEAR TAPE OF WIFE ACCUSED OF KILLING 
SPOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jurors on Wednesday heard a tape recording in which a Tarzana woman accused of 
murdering her millionaire husband told police that she loved him, didn't mind 
that he had a mistress and had no financial motive for killing him. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not think you could find two people in the United States who . . . loved 
each other more than my husband and I did," Carole Evelyn Mellinger told 
detectives on Jan. 24, a few hours after fatally shooting her husband, 
Brainerd, 69, in the den of their hillside home. 
</P>
<P>
The tape was played for jurors in Van Nuys Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Ann Korban, who introduced the tape during 
cross-examination, contends that Carole Mellinger was angry because her husband 
had been having an affair for 12 years and because she feared that his plans to 
sell his business would decrease the value of his estate. Korban said she 
played the tape to highlight inconsistencies in Mellinger's testimony. 
Mellinger was expected to continue testifying today.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PATIENTS MOVED AFTER LEAK FLOODS HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A water pipe believed to have been broken by construction workers sent water 
cascading down several floors of Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar, forcing 
hospital workers to move about two dozen patients, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A one-inch pipe in a sixth-floor restroom broke about 9:16 p.m. Tuesday, Los 
Angeles Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
Water gushing from the pipe caused flooding down to the third floor, but the 
fifth and sixth floors were the hardest hit with several inches of water 
reported in the hallways. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Hospital Administrator Mario Sewell said 10 patients in the 
adolescent psychiatric ward were moved from their sixth-floor rooms soon after 
the pipe burst; 16 patients in rooms directly below the pipe were also moved. 
All the patients were moved back to their rooms Wednesday, Sewell said.

'AX MURDERER' TOPS SLOW FRIGHT NIGHT

<P>
A costumed man was mistaken for an ax murderer in Oxnard and a group of shaving 
cream terrorists plagued Thousand Oaks during an unusually quiet fright night 
Wednesday, Ventura County police authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten lots of calls about juveniles hanging out, but that's about it," 
said Senior Deputy E.J. Rogers of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department three 
hours before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the night isn't over yet and the moon's not quite up." 
</P>
<P>
In Simi Valley, a teen-age assailant with a sweet tooth confronted a young 
trick-or-treater near Sequoia Park and made off with the child's candy. Aside 
from the bully's theft, Simi Police Lt. Don Austin said there were few 
incidents of malicious mischief. 
</P>
<P>
"When Halloween falls in the middle of the week, we don't see the number of 
pranks as when it falls on a weekend," Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
The case of the mistaken ax murderer involved a man who showed up at his former 
girlfriend's front door with an ax raised over his head, said Oxnard Police Lt. 
Tom Kady. "She wasn't home and the people there didn't recognize him," Kady 
said. CHRISTOPHER PUMMER

CLAIMS OVER FATAL ACCIDENT REJECTED

<TEXT>
<P>
The Casitas Municipal Water District has rejected claims of negligence filed by 
the families of an Oxnard man who was killed and two others who were injured in 
an automobile accident at the Lake Casitas campground last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Tinoco, 20, died in the Aug. 11 accident. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard residents Victor Ramirez, 17, and Ignacio Ramirez, 19, who are not 
related, were injured. 
</P>
<P>
The families of the three men each filed claims last month totaling more than 
$15 million. 
</P>
<P>
The district board of directors rejected the claims last week. 
</P>
<P>
The three men were among seven people riding in a pickup that plunged 45 feet 
down a ravine at the campgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Tinoco died of head injuries, California Highway Patrol officials said. 
According to the claims, Victor Ramirez suffered minor arm injuries, while 
Ignacio Ramirez was hospitalized with severe head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Officers arrested the driver of the truck, Tracey Rene Moore, 21, of Ojai on 
suspicion of felony drunken driving. 
</P>
<P>
The claims said the water district is responsible because it improperly 
constructed the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
The claims also allege that park rangers failed to control drinking on the 
campgrounds and allowed cars to enter and leave the grounds to buy alcoholic 
beverages. 
</P>
<P>
The claims seek $5 million in general damages for the Tinoco family, $505,000 
for the family of Victor Ramirez and $10.13 million for the family of Ignacio 
Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Simpson, an attorney for the firm that represents the families, said the 
families will probably file a lawsuit. HUGO MARTIN

<P>
A break in an eight-inch pipe sent water cascading down a stairwell of a 
16-story office building near 2nd and Figueroa streets in downtown Los Angeles 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Damage to the south structure of Imperial Bank Towers was estimated at $50,000 
by Fire Department Battalion Chief Richard Jioras. 
</P>
<P>
The break came below the roof and above the 16th floor about 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reported injuries or structural damage and the tower was not 
evacuated. Hardest hit was Rogers &amp; Wells, a law firm occupying the top two 
stories, where the water level at the core of the building reached 3 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys kept working in their offices at the building perimeter, but supplies 
and word processors were soaked, the carpet was sodden and the ceiling still 
dripped by mid-afternoon.

A Lake County man was ordered Wednesday to stand trial on charges that he 
murdered a traveling companion whose decomposed body was found in Matilija 
Canyon near Ojai in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Municipal Judge Bruce A. Clark held Thomas Gottchalk, 49, to 
answer charges that he shot Jean Ellen Eubanks, 34, twice in the head and left 
her body under a crude cairn in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Gottchalk is being held in lieu of $500,000 bail in Ventura County Jail pending 
arraignment in Superior Court, which is scheduled for Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, firearms experts testified that the two .25-caliber bullets 
found in Eubanks' body came from the same kind of gun that her daughter, 
Jeanine Copus, testified she saw in Gottchalk's van just after her mother 
disappeared on July 31, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
However, no murder weapon has been found, Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard E. Holmes 
said. MACK REED

Teachers from the Conejo Valley Unified School District displayed more than 20 
pro-union posters and banners on the front lawn of the district office in 
Thousand Oaks on Wednesday, as union and district officials met for continuing 
contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers, members of the Unified Assn. of Conejo Teachers, said the banners 
representing most of the district's 27 schools were posted to show support for 
the union, which has been negotiating since the teachers' contract expired last 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Union representative Hal Vick said the union and the district are far apart in 
areas such as salaries and benefits. Teachers are seeking a 10% salary 
increase, while the district is offering 4%, Vick said. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. William Seaver stopped briefly to talk with about a dozen teachers as 
they drove the banners, attached to stakes, into the district lawn. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview later, Seaver said Wednesday's meeting was the 18th negotiating 
session between the two sides. He said agreement has been reached on a third of 
the items discussed. ADRIANNE GOODMAN

cocaine-smuggling and weapons charges that could net them each more than 120 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. District Court grand jury's indictment, filed Tuesday, charges Gardner 
Ernest Flockhart, 31, and Robert Dale Lloyd, 27, with one count each of 
conspiracy and distribution of cocaine, and two counts of possession with 
intent to distribute cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Flockhart was also charged with using a firearm during a drug-trafficking 
crime, being a felon in possession of a firearm and possessing unregistered 
machine guns. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment says that on Oct. 12 Lloyd offered to supply a confidential 
informer with three kilograms of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 14, Lloyd met Flockhart at a 7-Eleven store at the corner of Royal 
Avenue and Sycamore Drive. 
</P>
<P>
At a shopping center, Lloyd delivered a bag containing cocaine to the informer 
and an undercover agent, who then arrested Lloyd, the indictmentsays. 
</P>
<P>
A search of Flockhart's Simi Valley house yielded five more kilograms of 
cocaine, $500,000 in cash and 125 guns, including many illegal weapons, 
authorities said. MACK REED

FIVE ANCIENT TRUNKS ARE TREASURE TROVES OF OLD L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On a hot, dusty day, Ellen Gibbon Bergman of La Jolla led historian Bill 
Deverell to a Palm Springs warehouse where she had stored five ancient trunks. 
</P>
<P>
They belonged to her grandfather, Thomas E. Gibbon, a key player on the Los 
Angeles business, legal and publishing scene around the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
When Deverell rolled open the warehouse door, he discovered "a historian's 
jackpot," a treasure trove of memorabilia, writings and letters full of 
insights into the wheeling and dealing that shaped early Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the papers tell the story of a drawn-out political fight 
over whether Los Angeles should locate its harbor in Santa Monica or San Pedro, 
a decision that influenced the style and commercial outlook of modern day Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The documents also shed new light on the real-life dealings fictionalized in 
the 1974 movie "Chinatown" -- details of how business leaders, lawyers, real 
estate wheeler-dealers and newspaper publishers orchestrated the growth of 
Southern California, as they piped in water to make the semi-desert landscape 
flourish and themselves rich in the process. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the 'Chinatown' story," said Deverell, 28, who was educated at Princeton 
and Stanford and this fall, upon leaving a Caltech position, joined the UC San 
Diego history faculty. "It's not going to set the general world on fire. But 
historically the papers are a significant find." 
</P>
<P>
An expert on California's history from 1880 to 1920, Deverell said that three 
years ago he became intrigued that there seemed to be so few documents on 
Gibbon, a Los Angeles attorney and railroad owner as well as publisher of the 
Los Angeles Herald. So, the historian began laboriously tracking Gibbon 
descendants through society registers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, two years after Bergman led him to the trunks, Deverell is still piecing 
together the historical mosaic the papers may reveal. Likewise, other 
California historians are making their way to study the papers, which Bergman 
has donated to San Marino's Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical 
Gardens, where Deverell was a postdoctoral fellow at the time of the discovery. 
</P>
<P>
Today at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, Deverell and Bergman are scheduled to 
discuss the documents with the annual gathering of the First Century Families, 
an elite group of descendants of early Los Angeles residents. 
</P>
<P>
The Gibbon papers are important, Huntington rare books curator Alan Jutzi said, 
because "they can tell you about the underlying (elements) of how Los Angeles 
was built and what really happened, below the surface of newspaper accounts and 
the public's knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbon, a progressive Democrat and advocate of political reform, was not the 
sort of person who had streets or buildings named after him, Deverell said. 
But, as with many high-stakes deal makers of today, he played an important 
role. 
</P>
<P>
The documents deal with what Deverell said was perhaps Gibbon's most vital 
local involvement: as a newspaper publisher and editor and as a part-owner and 
attorney of a railroad company. He was a leader in the successful campaign in 
the 1890s to locate the Los Angeles harbor in San Pedro rather than Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbon knew that his railway line, the Los Angeles Terminal Railway (whose 
title spawned the name for Terminal Island), would benefit from a San Pedro 
location. The correspondence makes it clear that Gibbon "made tons of money on 
the harbor deal," Deverell said. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot truly understand the harbor fight without looking at these papers," 
Deverell said. "The harbor fight was of crucial importance . . . (and) has been 
explained by historians as 'the good people of Los Angeles' versus 'the big, 
bad railroad company,' Southern Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
But Deverell said the papers make clear that the fight actually was between two 
railway companies -- Southern Pacific, which owned beachfront property in Santa 
Monica and wanted the harbor there, and Gibbon's Terminal Railway. 
</P>
<P>
The documents also give details about the business dealings of two Gibbon 
associates: Harrison Gray Otis, publisher of the Los Angeles Times from 
1882-1917, and Otis' son-in-law, Harry Chandler, The Times' publisher until 
1944, who served as one of Gibbon's six pallbearers in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite a find," said Craig St. Clair, historian for The Times and its 
parent firm, Times Mirror Co. "Gibbon knew all the players that were important 
and was corresponding with them." 
</P>
<P>
"In contemporary terms, (Gibbon) was a Harry Chandler wanna-be," Deverell said. 
"The fact that he was not as involved as Chandler and Otis doesn't make him a 
small fry. Gibbon had his finger in all kinds of pies." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Gibbon functioned as a go-between in negotiations with Otis, 
Chandler and muckraking journalist Lincoln Steffens. Gibbon set up a crucial 
meeting of Otis and Chandler with Steffens, who had come to town to cover the 
trial of two brothers, union radicals John and James McNamara, charged with a 
1910 bombing that killed 20 people at The Times. Steffens met with Otis and 
Chandler in an unusual attempt to work out a political compromise on the plea 
of the brothers, who eventually were imprisoned for their role in the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbon also was a business partner and attorney in many deals with Otis and 
Chandler, including huge land transactions in Mexico, Kern County and the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Gibbon was right in the thick of it," Deverell said. "L.A. in this period is a 
wide-open field for investment and these guys know it. They know the Pacific 
Rim is important. . . . They realize L.A. is in the 'wrong' place and that it 
needs water and transportation." 
</P>
<P>
As publisher of the Herald, Deverell said, Democrat Gibbon was in many ways a 
puppet of Republican Otis. Otis -- initially unbeknown to the newspaper-reading 
public -- owned the competing Herald for a time. Deverell said the 
correspondence shows that Otis and Gibbon, to guard against wayward eyes, 
referred to the Herald by the code words of "farming lands." 
</P>
<P>
If for no other reason, Deverell and other California historians said, the 
papers are significant because of Gibbon's relationship with Otis and Chandler, 
about whom, the experts say, there is not an abundance of publicly available 
original documents and letters.

COLOMBIAN MAN TO FACE CHARGES IN COCAINE SEIZURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Colombian national is scheduled to be arraigned today in connection with the 
seizure in Newhall of more than 100 pounds of cocaine estimated by authorities 
to be worth $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
Julian Alberto Zuluaga, 29, of Burbank is expected to answer charges in Los 
Angeles Municipal Court of possession and transportation of cocaine for sale 
stemming from the arrest Monday night. Investigators have described it as one 
of the largest cocaine seizures in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Zuluaga was arrested after undercover investigators from the West Covina Police 
Department watched him load three large bags into his car in the 24300 block of 
San Fernando Road in Newhall about 9:30 p.m., Detective Marc Taylor said. The 
bags were found to contain cocaine, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said police officers had followed Zuluaga to Newhall from a house in 
Buena Park, which had been staked out as part of an investigation into drug 
trafficking in West Covina. Taylor refused to say what led detectives to the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Zuluaga, described as a middleman in a larger drug operation, apparently 
stashed the cocaine at a Newhall business where he worked, Taylor said. He 
would not describe the nature of the business, saying police do not suspect it 
is involved in the drug operation. 
</P>
<P>
Officers arrested Zuluaga without incident, capping several months of 
investigation by West Covina police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
Taylor said. Zuluaga is being held in Los Angeles County Jail in lieu of 
$5-million bail. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said he did not expect any additional arrests to be made in the near 
future because news of the seizure undoubtedly would cause others in the 
operation to scatter. 
</P>
<P>
Narcotics investigators with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said 
Monday's seizure could be the second-largest in the Santa Clarita Valley. A 
joint operation between the Sheriff's Department and the FBI netted 682 pounds 
of cocaine in 1988.

DEPUTIES' USE OF ALLEGEDLY STOLEN MONEY DESCRIBED; 
</P>
<P>
DRUG FUNDS: CASHIER'S CHECKS, CASH PAID FOR CAR, OTHER ITEMS. BUSINESSMEN 
TESTIFY AT MONEY-SKIMMING TRIAL. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Building contractors and bank officials were among the parade of witnesses who 
took the stand Wednesday to testify about how seven Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies accused of money skimming spent the cash they allegedly 
stole. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first full day of testimony in which the prosecution attempted to 
show how the defendants -- all members of elite narcotics investigation teams 
-- disposed of some of the $1.4 million they are accused of stealing from drug 
dealers and money launderers in 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors focused primarily on the purchases and financial transactions of 
Deputy Macario M. Duran, who Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas A. Hagemann called in 
his opening statement a "classic" example of how the defendants laundered their 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Geniel Williams, an assistant vice president and custodian of records for First 
Interstate Bank, testified that Duran and his wife, Maria, used cash to buy a 
series of cashier's checks ranging in amounts from a few hundred to several 
thousand dollars during 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the checks -- made out to various entities, including Coldwell 
Banker Escrow Inc. and a financing company that assisted the Durans in 
purchasing a $55,000 Mercedes-Benz -- were for more than $5,000, said Williams. 
However, none exceeded $9,500 -- a critical point, since a cash purchase of a 
$10,000 cashier's check would have triggered the filing of a currency 
transaction report with the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
Another witness, Larry Kositcheck, testified that in the course of doing 
thousands of dollars in electrical, repair and remodeling work for the Durans, 
he was once paid as much as $5,000 in cash by the couple. 
</P>
<P>
Kositcheck testified that he spoke to Duran shortly before he was to be 
interviewed by IRS agents in regard to work he had done for the deputy. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't want me to say anything about the cash I'd received," said 
Kositcheck when questioned by Assistant U.S. Atty. Jeffrey C. Eglash. "I told 
him I had it in my records and I had to report it. I wasn't going to lie to the 
IRS." 
</P>
<P>
Kositcheck added that he later saw a copy of the memorandum of the interview at 
Duran's home. Duran asked Kositcheck if everything attributed to him in the 
memorandum was true and then disputed a statement in which Kositcheck told 
agents that Duran had said his Mercedes-Benz was his undercover county vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he'd never said that. And his wife said he must have been joking if he 
did," Kositcheck said. 
</P>
<P>
"But had he in fact told you that?" Eglash asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," the witness answered. 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination by Duran's attorney, Kositcheck acknowledged that the 
Durans did not appear to be trying to hide their financial transactions since 
their names appeared on the cashier's checks they often used to pay him. The 
witness added that the couple paid him in amounts that were in accord with the 
demands he had established. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony was not limited to Duran's expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
Ross Reinoso, a custom home builder in Bullhead City, Ariz., said he was 
working on a project when defendant Eufrasio G. Cortez and his wife stopped by 
and asked if he built other homes. In March, 1989, he contracted to build a 
home for Cortez that, when completed, cost about $86,000. 
</P>
<P>
After an initial payment of $5,000 by personal check, Reinoso testified that 
Cortez later paid him $19,000 in cash. Subsequent payments were made primarily 
in the form of cashier's checks to cover amounts as high as $24,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, Reinoso added that he told Cortez he preferred payment in a form other 
than personal check, because such checks took too long to clear. 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination by Cortez's attorney, the witness further acknowledged 
that Cortez never tried to hide his financial transactions by asking Reinoso 
not to go to the bank or to deposit the payments in amounts less than $10,000 
to avoid the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
The $19,000 transaction is critical, because Cortez was specifically charged in 
the federal indictment with making the payment in cash so he could dispose of 
the money and hide the fact that it had been stolen.

'COTTON CLUB' TRIAL OPENS WITH TALES OF GREED, DRUGS, MURDER; 
</P>
<P>
COURT: A REPUTED COCAINE DEALER IS ACCUSED OF HIRING THREE MEN TO KILL A 
PRODUCER AFTER A MOVIE DEAL WENT SOUR. HER LAWYER SAYS SHE WAS FRAMED.

<P>
Seven years after the bullet-riddled body of theatrical impresario Roy Radin 
was found in a remote canyon, a reputed cocaine dealer and three former 
bodyguards of Hustler publisher Larry Flynt went on trial Wednesday in a case 
that will explore the underside of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
In opening the so-called "Cotton Club" trial, Deputy Dist. Atty. David Conn 
told Los Angeles Superior Court jurors that Radin was killed by the former 
bodyguards on orders from co-defendant Karen DeLayne (Lanie) Greenberger, who 
was angry after being denied a share of profits from a movie deal she helped 
organize between Radin and producer Robert Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberger also suspected Radin of helping one of her former associates steal 
$200,000 in cash and 10 kilograms of cocaine from her home, the prosecutor 
alleged. 
</P>
<P>
"Each of the defendants were involved in a conspiracy to kidnap and kill Roy 
Radin," Conn said. "And each defendant did it for one purpose only: for 
financial gain and for their own personal greed." 
</P>
<P>
Conn called the former bodyguards "hired guns." 
</P>
<P>
"She is the only person in this courtroom who had a personal problem with Mr. 
Radin," he said, referring to Greenberger. 
</P>
<P>
But Greenberger's attorney, Edward Shohat, countered that his client had been 
framed. He suggested reputed Miami drug runner Milan Bellechesses, the father 
of Greenberger's child, was actually behind the crime and should be on trial. 
</P>
<P>
Bellechesses has not been charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Lanie Greenberger was set up, used, literally and figuratively, to take the 
rap for the murder of Roy Radin," Shohat said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberger, 43, was ordered in July, 1989, to stand trial for the killing of 
Radin, described in court as a man of excesses, an obese, cocaine-sniffing 
impresario from New York's Long Island who sought to expand his show business 
connections to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Also on trial are William Mentzer, 40, Robert Ulmer Lowe, 43 and Alex Marti, 
29. 
</P>
<P>
All four defendants are being held without bail and could face the death 
penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a long skirt with a sweater draped around her shoulders, Greenberger 
appeared relaxed Wednesday as she sat directly in front of jurors. She smiled 
occasionally as she chatted with her attorneys and gazed about the courtroom. 
The other defendants sat behind her, flanked by their lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, which is expected to last six to eight months, Greenberger 
will testify on her own behalf. Evans, who was linked to the killing by a 
prosecution witness but never charged, may also be called to testify, Conn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Radin met Greenberger, who arranged to have him meet Evans, 
prosecutors allege. However, Greenberger and Radin's friendship soured after 
the cocaine and cash was stolen from Greenberger's home and when Radin later 
refused to cut her in on any profits from a production company deal he and 
Evans were negotiating. The deal would have included "The Cotton Club," the 
film about the famed, Prohibition-era Harlem jazz club. 
</P>
<P>
"She wanted a share and that threw a wrench into the whole works," Conn said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said Radin was last seen alive on May 13, 1983, when he got into 
a limousine with Greenberger to go to dinner in Beverly Hills. Conn said that 
at some point, Lowe, who was driving, pulled the vehicle over and Greenberger 
got out. 
</P>
<P>
Mentzer and Marti then got in and Radin, 33, was driven to a canyon near 
Gorman, where Marti emptied his revolver into the back of Radin's head, Conn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mentzer fired one shot, "the coup de grace," and pulled out a 3- to 4-inch 
stick of dynamite, put it in Radin's mouth, lit it and "blew up the face," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A beekeeper discovered Radin's body on June 10. 
</P>
<P>
Shohat conceded that Greenberger was a drug dealer at the time of Radin's 
killing, but insisted that no evidence exists to tie her to the crime. He 
described his client as a woman caught in a "tightening vise" because the 
stolen cocaine and money did not belong to her and she was desperate to find a 
way to pay back the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Roy Radin offered her a way to pay the debt," Shohat said. "And that way was 
the 'Cotton Club' deal." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for both Marti and Lowe attacked the credibility of the district 
attorney's witnesses, saying many have been granted immunity from prosecution 
in exchange for testifying against their clients. 
</P>
<P>
Lowe's attorney, Mark Kaiserman, told jurors the only people that would place 
Lowe at the scene of the crime were "people bought and paid for by the 
prosecution."

TOY MAKERS HITCH A RIDE ON BUBBLE-BLOWER'S ASCENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Part bauble, part toy, the Bubbler hangs around some of the best-known necks in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna has one and gave them as Christmas gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Tina Turner got hers when she turned 50. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Howard, Darryl Hannah, Pierce Brosnan, Debra Winger, Dick Van Dyke and 
Olivia Newton John all have them. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's got them, from Whoopi Goldberg to Larry Hagman," said Robert 
Walker, actor and co-owner of Tops Malibu, the functional art shop where the 
sterling-silver bubble blower is a bestseller. That's despite -- or perhaps 
because of -- its $65 price tag. 
</P>
<P>
So popular is the pricey little plaything that Walker and wife Judy have 
entered into an agreement with its creator, New Mexico jewelry maker Ted Cutter 
and his wife, Mary Quitzau, to market it throughout the United States and 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview in People magazine, Judy Walker compared the Bubbler, 
which hangs from a black satin cord, to a chain letter. "One person buys one 
and three or four friends come rushing in," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The trinket of choice is a round or cylindrical container that includes a 
reservoir for bubble fluid and a combination stopper and bubble wand. Some are 
inset with semiprecious stones. The pendant comes with a kit that includes a 
tiny funnel and a bottle of bubble soap. Recently, the Walkers found a formula 
that produces a better bubble. Instead of a stream, he said, "it gives us a 
bouquet of bubbles." 
</P>
<P>
Walker says that people sometimes look around nervously the first time someone 
pulls one out, apparently remembering the little silver coke spoons that once 
hung around people's necks. But the Bubbler is as innocent as the Hula Hoop. In 
Quitzau's view, its appeal is that it gives its owner permission to have fun. 
</P>
<P>
"The look on a person's face when she first sees the Bubbler is like that of a 
child whose mom just said, 'It's OK,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
For years Cutter made each bubble-blower himself. In 1987, he perfected a 
method for making the chic plaything in assembly-line fashion. Able to produce 
hundreds instead of dozens, the couple began distributing them through Neiman 
Marcus and other retail outlets. Cutter now has three helpers and can make 
2,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, who looks remarkably like his late actor father and namesake, said the 
shop is a welcome distraction from his less-than-frantic acting career. "I'm so 
busy here I don't realize I'm out of work," he said.

The third pregnant woman in a week has fallen victim to a street shooting in 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent victim, Maria Lopez, 29, of Paramount, was wounded early 
Wednesday during a robbery attempt in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez was struck once in the abdomen and her companion, Mark Robert Arias, 31, 
of Long Beach, was shot and killed as they sat in a parked car at 12:45 a.m., 
Police Detective Ron Pavek said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman demanded money from the couple and started shooting when Arias 
replied that he only had $3, Pavek said. 
</P>
<P>
With Arias unconscious in the driver's seat, Lopez managed to drive to Charter 
Suburban Hospital in Paramount, where she underwent surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez was in guarded condition Wednesday afternoon, hospital spokesman Allen 
Meadows said. The 5-month-old fetus was not struck by the bullet and was in 
good condition, Meadows said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday evening, another pregnant woman was standing on the porch of a home 
in South Los Angeles when she was struck once in the head by a bullet. 
</P>
<P>
Kara Cooper, 20, was taken to County-USC Medical Center, where she was in 
extremely critical condition. Cooper's 8-month-old fetus was not injured, 
hospital spokeswoman Adelaida de la Cerda said. Witnesses told police 
investigators that the unidentified gunman fled into an alley. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 24, a 38-year-old woman was gunned down as she walked home with her 
boyfriend in a West Los Angeles neighborhood, Police Detective Elliot Rada 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The detective said Pauline Ellis, who was expecting to give birth in a month, 
died in a hail of bullets that may have been meant for her 29-year-old 
boyfriend because of a previous dispute with the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
"The weather was nice for walking, and (Ellis) had to get out and exercise a 
little to relieve the discomfort of being eight months pregnant," Rada said. 
"She would have had a baby girl if she and the fetus had lived." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, a pregnant woman was shot Tuesday as she left her 
gynecologist's office. 
</P>
<P>
Janet C. Totten, 29, of Westminster was treated at Hoag Memorial Hospital in 
Newport Beach for a single rifle shot wound to the face, Lt. Ed McErlain said. 
She was listed in satisfactory condition and her 5-month-old fetus was not 
harmed, McErlain said. 
</P>
<P>
Totten told investigators that she had obtained a temporary restraining order 
against her husband, Anthony L. Totten, 32, for alleged death threats to her 
and her unborn child. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach police arrested Anthony Totten on Wednesday.

SCHOOL OFFICER ANSWERING SILENT ALARM KILLS KIDNAP, RAPE SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A school police officer, responding to a silent alarm at a Compton elementary 
school before dawn Wednesday, shot and killed a man who allegedly kidnaped a 
woman at knifepoint and ordered her to disrobe in an apparent rape attempt, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
James Calvin Williams, 30, of Compton was struck in the head by a single shot 
fired by the officer and was pronounced dead at Washington Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
Police withheld the identities of both the 31-year-old woman and the school 
officer, an 11-year veteran of the Compton Unified School District Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was not injured. She told investigators that she was making a call at 
a pay telephone about a block and a half from the school when her assailant 
threatened her with a knife and took her to the school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Compton Police Sgt. Barry Lobel said the school district officer responded to a 
silent alarm and arrived at the school about 3:20 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
When he got out of his car to unlock a gate, Lobel said, the officer heard a 
woman yell and saw Williams, armed with an assault knife with a 6-to-8-inch 
blade, approaching the victim, who was partially clothed. 
</P>
<P>
The officer fired once, Lobel said.

POLANSKI CAN DEFEND HIMSELF IN SEX CASE

The California Supreme Court Wednesday ruled that movie director Roman Polanski 
may defend himself against a civil suit by the 13-year-old girl he sexually 
assaulted in 1977, even though Polanski fled to France before sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, now 26 and living in Hawaii, filed a civil suit against Polanski 
stemming from the unlawful sex in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
She argued that Polanski forfeited the right to defend himself in court against 
her claim because he fled the country and never faced sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
The high court rejected the argument and refused to hear an appeal in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Polanski currently lives as a fugitive in Paris and continues to make movies. 
</P>
<P>
The young woman is identified only by the name "Jane Doe" on the court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
Polanski pleaded guilty in August, 1977, to unlawful sexual intercourse with a 
minor in an incident that took place at the home of actor Jack Nicholson.

PICKING NEW PLANNER IS A QUESTION OF POWER; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: COUNCIL MEMBERS AND THE MAYOR SAY THEY WANT A STRONG LEADER. BUT 
THEY ARE RELUCTANT TO GIVE UP THEIR OWN AUTHORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
As the city sets off on a search for a new planning director, Los Angeles 
officials must confront the politically sensitive question of how much power 
they are willing to relinquish to a Planning Department that has seldom set the 
agenda for managing the city's explosive growth. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons grounded in tradition and political reality, the city's planning 
priorities more often than not have been set by forces outside the Planning 
Department. In the absence of consistent leadership, planning policy has been 
the product of lawsuits brought against the city, ballot measures, 
election-year politics by the mayor and City Council members and even 
legislative mandates from Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The departure of planning Director Kenneth C. Topping, announced Tuesday, is 
seen by some at City Hall as an opportunity to replace an "indecisive" leader 
and shore up a weak and beleaguered Planning Department. But others, 
particularly City Council members, are reluctant to give up any authority over 
the volatile issues of growth and development that can polarize their 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all agree that the task Topping faced, and his successor must 
address, was just short of impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"The council members want to have their cake and eat it too," said Councilman 
Michael Woo, who has a master's degree in urban planning. "We want to feel that 
we have a highly competent Planning Department, but I don't know if a majority 
of us would be willing to support a higher level of independence." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor and the council, Woo added, should look for a director who is willing 
to say " 'no' to us." 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants to have a strong Planning Department, but everybody wants to 
be able to tell it what to do in their district," said Councilman Hal Bernson, 
chairman of the council's Planning Committee. "We don't want someone who's in 
anyone's pocket." 
</P>
<P>
While Mayor Tom Bradley has not signaled a choice for planning director, aides 
insisted he will not be looking for a "yes" man. 
</P>
<P>
"The planning director has one of the most difficult jobs in the city," said 
Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani. "The mayor will be looking during the national 
search for person who is tough, who is an independent thinker and who is 
capable of saying 'no' to the council, the mayor, homeowners groups and 
developers when it is appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Such a choice would represent a departure from the current model, critics say. 
Not only have Topping and his staff often deferred to council members on major 
projects, at times they have appeared to play second fiddle to powerful 
developers and their hired consultants. 
</P>
<P>
Topping, who describes himself as "deliberative," was virtually silent during 
the heated controversy over one of the largest developments in the city's 
history -- the vast Porter Ranch commercial and residential project that will 
rise from the foothills of the Santa Susana Mountains in the north San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
He and his staff are playing only a small role in the dramatic transformation 
of the Farmer's Market area, the rustic retail enclave in the Fairfax District. 
Instead, Bradley and council members from the area are jockeying to take the 
lead on the project. 
</P>
<P>
The role of private planning consultants in shaping the Porter Ranch and other 
major projects is troubling to planning experts such as Robert S. Harris, dean 
of the USC School of Architecture and a frequent adviser to the city. 
</P>
<P>
"The private sector is heavily involved in city planning," Harris said. "The 
Planning Department ought to have at least enough resources to make a 
collaborative effort to protect the public interest." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of presiding over major developments, the department, in the eyes of 
its critics, has become mired in incremental planning -- neighborhood by 
neighborhood, street by street -- that results in a patchwork of plans and 
policies, some overlapping and sometimes conflicting. 
</P>
<P>
There was been "neither the time nor the ability to do long-term planning," 
Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the neglected issues that his successor will have to face, say Topping's 
critics, are formulating a comprehensive strategy for downtown growth, 
determining where building will take place along new rail lines and devising a 
policy to encourage more mixed-use development that allows housing, offices and 
stores to be built side by side. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the department has been preoccupied with neighborhood issues, usually 
in response to the demands of City Council members who want quick solutions to 
development controversies in their districts. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, council members go so far as to broker their own deals with 
developers whose projects could have enormous impact on their districts. 
</P>
<P>
One such example is Councilwoman Ruth Galanter's successful effort to find a 
developer who would respect the wishes of her constituents while developing 
Playa Vista on the largest piece of vacant land along the city's coastline. 
Planned largely by the developer, the result will be a city-within-a-city on 
more than 670 acres between Marina del Rey and the Westchester bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Planning Department has been reduced to addressing such issues 
as "where people should park for this restaurant or what hours it should stay 
open on weekends," said a council aide long familiar with the department's 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Further complicating the department's role is the skirmishing that has occurred 
between the council and the mayor's office over planning issues. 
</P>
<P>
By tradition, council members have virtually total control over planning 
matters in their districts because colleagues rarely interfere in one another's 
territory. Recently, Bradley has attempted to inject himself into the process 
as he tries to distance himself from development interests. In the case of 
Porter Ranch, for example, Bradley sought to reduce the scale of the project. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor's role, in general, is to keep track of the big picture and 
establish citywide goal and objectives for the Planning Department," said 
Fabiani. "Sometimes that involves analysis of major projects that have an 
effect on the quality of life in the city." 
</P>
<P>
With no clear leadership having emerged on planning issues, the city's planning 
policy as often as not is shaped by litigation and politics. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition U, a ballot initiative passed in 1986, placed limits on building 
height. A homeowner's group won a court case several years ago to force the 
city to reconcile its zoning ordinances with its community plans, which often 
were at odds with each other. Last year, Bradley pushed through a proposal to 
have all 35 of the city's community plans revised and updated. 
</P>
<P>
Work on these plans has lagged while the Planning Department struggles under a 
crippling load of requests for zoning variances, project approvals and other 
routine matters. Meanwhile, both homeowners groups and developers have found 
fault with the department's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Ken Topping was caught in the cross-fire between the whole pro-development 
mentality of the City Council and the homeowners who are crying out for 
controls and limits," said Gerald Silver, president of the Homeowners Assn. of 
Encino. "He's good-natured and a good guy at heart, but he could not survive in 
that cross-fire and I don't think anybody can."

WOMAN SAYS ARMED KILLER MADE HER HELP KIDNAP GIRLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman accused of being the accomplice of a convicted murderer told jurors 
Wednesday that he threatened to "blow my brains out" if she did not help him 
kidnap two Chatsworth girls, one of whom he killed. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, Marcia Lynn Ramos, 36, testified in her defense in San Fernando 
Superior Court, where she is being tried on murder, kidnaping and six other 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
She said the killer, Roland Comtois, threatened her at gunpoint throughout the 
Sept. 18, 1987, kidnaping. She said he became "crazy, angry and agitated" and 
ordered her to lure the teen-agers into his motor home by asking them to help 
start it. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a crazy man standing behind me," Ramos told jurors. "He had a gun in 
his hand. It was cocked. He said he would kill me if I didn't" ask the girls 
into the motor home. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos testified that at one point during the kidnaping, she planned to inject 
Comtois with a lethal dose of cocaine after he told her to get a syringe out of 
a cabinet. But she said she secretly dumped half the injection when he ordered 
her to give the shot to one of the girls. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was for him," Ramos said. "I wanted to overdose him." 
</P>
<P>
Ramos, her voice at times choking with emotion, described how Comtois 
terrorized her and the two girls, one of whom he sexually assaulted. Ramos said 
the 90-minute kidnaping culminated in Comtois' putting the girls into an 
abandoned station wagon and shooting them in the head. He killed Wendy 
Masuhara, 14. The other girl survived because her upraised hand deflected the 
bullet. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos' testimony contradicted the prosecution's position that she voluntarily 
initiated the kidnaping, and supported statements made by the surviving victim 
shortly after the ordeal that Comtois threatened to kill Ramos. 
</P>
<P>
Comtois was sentenced in July to die in the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that after the shooting on remote Woolsey Canyon Road Comtois drove 
the motor home to a dead-end, turned around and drove past the station wagon a 
second time. He noticed that a door appeared to have been opened, Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
"That means somebody's found them," she said he told her. In fact the wounded 
girl had walked down the road and had been taken by a passing motorist to a 
hospital.

KNOX HEAPS PRAISE ON CHARGERS

<P>
Coach Chuck Knox of the Seattle Seahawks is being careful not to repeat the 
mistake allegedly made by Tampa Bay's Ray Perkins last week. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Chargers met the Buccaneers, Coach Dan Henning told his troops that 
he had a tape on which Perkins guaranteed a Tampa Bay victory. The ploy so 
inspired the Chargers that they trashed the Buccaneers, 41-10. 
</P>
<P>
Knox was reminded of this Wednesday in his conference call with the San Diego 
media. He said, "Yes, I heard about it," then heaped praise on the Chargers, 
who Sunday will meet the Seahawks in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
When someone called the Chargers a mystery team, Knox said, "They're not a 
mystery team to me. They're well coached and they have excellent players. They 
could have won all their other games. The scores of the (five) games they lost 
are very misleading." 
</P>
<P>
Defense, of course, is something about which the Chargers are justifiably 
proud, and Seahawk quarterback Dave Krieg emphasized that in his conference 
call. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, some 10 minutes went by before anyone asked Krieg what he thought 
of the Chargers' defense. When the question finally came up, Krieg said, "I was 
waiting for somebody to ask me that. Their defense has just been phenomenal. 
Watching them on film, I can't find a weakness." 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Krieg was asked, "Then why are the Chargers 3-5?" 
</P>
<P>
He replied, "That will change. The talent is there. The way they come off the 
ball is the only thing I'm concerning myself with this week." 
</P>
<P>
Henning picked Eric Floyd over Joel Patten to start at offensive left tackle in 
place of Leo Goeas, who underwent arthroscopic knee surgery Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd, a 300-pounder, was released by the Chargers in 1988 and was on their 
developmental squad last season until he was activated for the last three 
games. He started the first four games this year, but received some unfavorable 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling the criticism, Floyd said, "It got me down, but the other guys helped 
pull me up. I was supposed to be gone by Sept. 9, and then by midseason. 
Because of me, (quarterback) Billy Joe Tolliver was supposed to take out more 
life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers added linebacker Willie Walker to their practice squad. Walker, 
6-1 and 240, from North Carolina, had tryouts with the Seahawks and New York 
Jets in training camp. . . . Tolliver practiced despite a case of flu. . . . 
Strong safety Martin Bayless, who missed the Tampa Bay game because of a leg 
injury, worked out lightly and said he would be ready by Sunday. . . . Billy 
Ray Smith, who played only on field goals and extra points Sunday after missing 
five games with a pulled stomach muscle, is scheduled for part-time linebacker 
duty in Seattle. "I'm ready to get back into it a little at a time," he said.

SINGLE-SPORT KEEPS HARTMAN ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before his freshman year at Canyon High, Dave Hartman wanted to be a 
tri-athlete. 
</P>
<P>
No, not the maniacal swim-bike-run type, but of the three-sport, 
big-man-on-campus variety. 
</P>
<P>
Football, basketball and track were on Hartman's itinerary when he arrived in 
1987 at a high school that eats, drinks and breathes football. And he was 
working on all three sports in the summer preceding his freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
"During the summer he would work out in the morning with the football team and 
then, in the evening, he would get on a bike or get a ride from a friend and 
come to our evening practice to run eight to 10 miles," said Ed Chaidez, who 
coached cross-country at Canyon during 1986-88. 
</P>
<P>
Hartman, the No. 2 returning runner in the state, started running weekend 
five-kilometer races for fun while in junior high. He was unaware he was 
genetically inclined to be a distance runner. 
</P>
<P>
Hartman's father Arnold ran indoor track as a freshman at Purdue and was the 
No. 2 runner on his high school cross-country team, which finished fifth in the 
Ohio state meet his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know he was a runner until I started running," Hartman said. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Hartman was modest about his past. 
</P>
<P>
"I may have mentioned it in passing, but I never really emphasized it," Arnold 
said. "I really had no reason to go over it with him until he got into it." 
</P>
<P>
Like most high school freshmen, Hartman "had no clue" and desired to play 
football and run cross-country -- in the same season. 
</P>
<P>
Such a plan was fine with the freshman football coach but Chaidez threw a 
prevent defense over the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do both," Hartman said. "I asked the football coach and he said, 
'Fine.' I asked Chaidez and he said, 'No way.' 
</P>
<P>
"He believed you couldn't be a dedicated runner if you were also doing another 
sport. So I chose cross-country." 
</P>
<P>
In his first high school meet, the freshman race in the Colton Invitational, 
Hartman won in 16 minutes, 36 seconds -- the fourth-fastest time among Canyon 
runners that day. 
</P>
<P>
But Hartman's most memorable race his freshman year was a Golden League 
quadrangular meet that included Antelope Valley, the fourth-ranked team in the 
Southern Section 4-A Division. Hartman outleaned Mike Quin of Antelope Valley 
to finish second behind teammate Mike Rattary, sparking a Cowboy upset. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in his senior year, Hartman, 17, is gearing up for Arroyo Grande's Louie 
Quintana, the top returnee in the nation. Quintana finished second in the state 
Division I final a year ago while Hartman was sixth. They were the top 
underclassmen in the state and have emerged as the best this season. 
</P>
<P>
In the Mt. San Antonio College Invitational on Oct. 20, Hartman timed 14:51 -- 
the seventh-fastest mark on the course to date -- in finishing second to 
Quintana. With his 14:40, Quintana moved to fifth on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
Blessed with broad shoulders, a barrel-like upper body and thighs that would 
make cyclists envious, Hartman might have fit in well on Canyon's powerful 
football team. Instead, the 5-foot-11, 154-pound Hartman used his strength to 
gain stature as the Southern Section 4-A cross-country champion. He relies 
mainly on endurance in races rather than an explosive kick at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
"You ask Dave to take off his shirt and he looks like a football player," 
cross-country Coach Dave DeLong said. "He doesn't look like a runner. He's got 
this huge rib cage and big (chest)." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, tackling is not legal in cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
"Just to see him run hill repeats the way he does, the word that comes to mind 
is 'strength,' " said DeLong, in his second year as head coach at Canyon. I've 
never seen that type of strength in a runner. 
</P>
<P>
"I've coached the more fluid runners like Sasha Vujic (Burroughs, 1988) and Dan 
Berkeland (Canyon, 1990), but they didn't have the overall strength that Dave 
has." 
</P>
<P>
Chaidez went as far as to compare Hartman to former running greats Dave 
Babiracki and Steve Prefontaine. 
</P>
<P>
"He kind of reminds me of (Babiracki and Prefontaine), where you have a 
barrel-like upper body and a lot of lung capacity," Chaidez said. 
</P>
<P>
Babiracki, a former Granada Hills High, Valley College and Brigham Young 
standout, won a national 20-kilometer road-race championship in the mid-70s. 
Prefontaine simultaneously held every U. S. record from the 3,000 to the 10,000 
meters and placed fourth in the 5,000 in the 1972 Munich Olympics. He died in 
an automobile accident in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Hartman's strength has developed over a relatively short career. Once a 
run-for-fun type, Hartman only started competitive training before his freshman 
year at Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
While in the eighth grade at Our Lady of Perpetual Help, Hartman started racing 
five-kilometer events almost every weekend and maintained a three- to four-mile 
daily training regimen in between. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never heard of running intervals," Hartman said. "Running up a hill, 
coming down and running up the same hill again." 
</P>
<P>
Although Hartman maintains above-average grades and writes a sports column for 
Canyon's school newspaper, most of his studying appears to be in newspaper 
agate pages and running magazines. 
</P>
<P>
True, he wants to see how his opposition is running. But he remembers marks 
from as long as three years ago and can make accurate predictions on how a 
runner will fare on a particular course. 
</P>
<P>
"He has all these runners' times, from last year, two years ago and three years 
ago, memorized," DeLong said. "He's a true student of the sport."

AN ERA OF SAIL LIES ANCHORED IN TWO HARBORS; 
</P>
<P>
BOATING: VENTURA COUNTY SHORELINE TOOK ON GREATER APPEAL WITH CONSTRUCTION OF 
MARINAS IN VENTURA AND OXNARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As recently as three decades ago, if you owned a sailboat in Ventura County you 
needed an extra piece of equipment: a trailer. Despite miles of shoreline, 
there was virtually no permanent mooring. 
</P>
<P>
"You could anchor near Ventura Pier, but every time you wanted to get to your 
boat, you had to climb down a rope ladder and take a row boat," said Don Mills, 
a civil engineer who is the historian of the Ventura Yacht Club. And, he adds, 
there was room for only about 20 sailboats. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County was a boater's paradise waiting for a marina. That finally 
happened in the early 1960s with the construction of Ventura Harbor in the city 
of Ventura and Channel Islands Harbor in Oxnard. Today, approximately 3,500 
boats are permanently moored in the two harbors, and the area has become one of 
California's prime sailing locales. 
</P>
<P>
But aside from ideal wind and wave conditions, Ventura has something that most 
areas cannot offer their sailors: a destination. Channel Islands National Park 
-- a string of five islands -- is just a few miles off the coast, close enough 
for an easy afternoon cruise. 
</P>
<P>
"If you sail out of Marina del Rey, you've really got no place to go except 
Catalina, and once you've done that it gets pretty dull," said Robert 
VanBenthuysen, who lives in Ventura Harbor aboard his 32-foot sloop. "Sailing 
in Ventura is much more interesting." 
</P>
<P>
VanBenthuysen is a member of the Ventura Yacht Club, the oldest boating 
organization in the county. Founded in 1938 as the Ventura County Boat Club, 
the VYC has grown from 60 to its current 218 members. It stages the annual 
Ventura Cup Regatta, which is considered the area's most prestigious race, and 
wields a great deal of influence over sailing in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty years ago, the VYC thought it had found a permanent a home in then-new 
Port Hueneme Harbor. But the U. S. Navy evicted the club at the outbreak of 
World War II. After the war, club members concentrated their efforts on getting 
a harbor built in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
In 1952, the VYC was instrumental in helping create the city of Ventura Port 
District, a public agency. It took an additional 10 years before a $4.7 million 
bond issue was passed and construction begun on about 250 acres of swampland on 
Pierpont Bay. A huge dry hole was excavated to a maximum depth of 15 feet, the 
dirt transported inland to help build sections of the Ventura and Santa Paula 
freeways. Jettys were built and then a dredge chewed a channel, allowing 
seawater to flood the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
The VYC secured a 50-year lease from the Port District and built a two-level 
clubhouse in 1967. Sailing was on its way in Ventura -- until nature got ugly. 
In 1969, the harbor was wiped out by the greatest flood in the recorded history 
of the area. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 25, 1969, the Santa Clara River jumped its banks and flooded, but 
damage was minimal. Exactly a month later, the river overflowed again, this 
time sending a crushing wall of water down the flood plain. At Ventura Harbor, 
more than 100 boats were destroyed or lost when they were propelled out to sea 
like giant surfboards. Most of the 1,900 slips also were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
After the flood, the VYC clubhouse was virtually an island, accessible only by 
dinghy, and the devastated harbor had to be dredged. Sailing came to a halt for 
a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
While Ventura Harbor was built specifically for recreation, Channel Islands 
Harbor was created by the Army Corps of Engineers as a sand trap to control 
erosion on down-coast beaches. But Ventura County, which runs the harbor, 
quickly recognized the recreation possibilities, and 3,600 slips were built. 
Today, the harbor is home to four clubs, including the 400-member Pacific 
Corinthian Yacht Club. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their proximity -- only seven miles apart on Harbor Boulevard -- the 
two harbors are not rivals, Don Mills said. "We don't compete, we complement 
each other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County sailors are always comparing their turf and surf to Marina del 
Rey, a massive South Bay harbor with 6,100 slips. In comparison, the harbors at 
Ventura and Channel Islands seem almost quaint. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a quiet, little-town atmosphere here," said Sandi Hirlinger, who lives 
aboard a 41-foot trimaran in Ventura Harbor and belongs to the Pierpont Bay 
Yacht Club. "There are a lot of boats here, but there's not the everyday 
traffic like Marina del Rey. There's no hustle and bustle." 
</P>
<P>
But sailing off the Ventura coast, as idyllic as it is, can be "treacherous," 
said Dotty Massa, a grandmother who is the VYC's first woman commodore. "You 
have to be aware of a lot of things. You have to know your boat, how the marina 
is laid out, your compass bearings, and the wind conditions -- the wind can go 
from zero to 20 or 30 knots in a short time. 
</P>
<P>
"Sailing here is exciting, but it's only as dangerous as you make it." 
</P>

Park -- a string of five islands -- located just a few miles off the coast. The

CSUN LEFT IN LURCH FOR FINALE IN SOCCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Just when the Cal State Northridge soccer team was hitting its stride, its 
season ended -- unexpectedly. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors (9-7-3), winners of six of their past eight matches, were deprived 
of a season finale Friday at California. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific 10 Conference school never had Northridge, a Division I 
independent, on its schedule. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN Coach Marwan Ass'ad said he scheduled the match last spring with Cal Coach 
Bill Coupe, who was replaced this fall by Dave Chaplick. Ass'ad was aware of 
the coaching change but failed to ensure that the match was still scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have done that," Ass'ad conceded. 
</P>
<P>
According to Northridge Athletic Director Bob Hiegert, Cal officials could have 
apprised CSUN of the situation at the beginning of the season when they 
received the schedule from CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point I'm not sure it is 100% Berkeley's fault," Hiegert said. "It 
might be 75% theirs and 25% ours. 
</P>
<P>
"We were fortunate we had played the minimal number of Division I games and 
that there were no playoff ramifications." 
</P>
<P>
The match was not bound by a contract, but that is not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say 80% of our games we don't have contracts," Ass'ad said. "But from now 
on, of course, we will have a contract." 
</P>
<P>
If not for Tom Manning, Northridge assistant sports information director, CSUN 
would have flown to the Bay Area on Friday. Manning prevented what would have 
been a needless journey when he discovered the scheduling discrepancy Monday in 
a routine telephone call to Cal. 
</P>
<P>
"That would have been a disaster," Ass'ad said. "That would have really been 
embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
According to Ass'ad, Chaplick told him Monday that he had a match with another 
team scheduled for Friday and knew nothing of a match with CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
But Kevin Reneau, Cal's assistant athletic director for media relations, said 
Cal has no match set for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Chaplick was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN players learned of the situation hours before their 2-1 win Monday at Cal 
State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't that bad," Matador junior midfielder Steve Linhart said. "We 
realized there's not a whole lot at stake, except the pride of winning. We knew 
there were no playoffs for us. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the season didn't go as we hoped we were ready to put it behind us and 
get ready for next year." 
</P>
<P>
The entire team is expected to return, including Danny Daniels, who scored a 
team-high 25 points (10 goals, five assists), Gus Cardenas and Bobby Reyes, who 
each scored 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ass'ad, Chaplick offered to schedule CSUN next season.

<P>
In the Angelus League cross-country finals at La Mirada Park, St. John Bosco 
won the boys' competition and Santa Margarita was the girls' champion. 
</P>
<P>
Led by individual champion Kristen Matheson, Santa Margarita had five of the 
top 10 finishers in the girls' race and second-place Mater Dei had three. Mater 
Dei's Diane Chonette and Jennifer Schuller finished second and third, 
respectively, with teammate Melanie Monge eighth. For Santa Margarita, Amy 
Markel was fifth, Katheryn Dullack seventh, Jamie Donnelly ninth and Kathleen 
Donnelly 10th.

<TEXT>
<P>
For the first six games of the season, Tony Williams was a good player on a 
losing team; last week he was a great player on a winner. 
</P>
<P>
Williams rushed for 176 yards and scored four touchdowns, including the 
game-winner with 30 seconds remaining, to help Ventura break a 10-game losing 
streak with a 46-45 victory over Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Williams scored on runs of 10, eight, one and one yards. All four touchdown 
runs came on a play called 44 Blast, a play that Williams ran 10 times for 74 
yards in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the go-to guy," Ventura Coach Dick James said. "He ran harder and with 
more enthusiasm than he has all year."

TRIPS HELP COYOTES AVOID FALL; 
</P>
<P>
GIRLS' TENNIS: COMPETITION ABROAD HAS TOUGHENED PLAYERS FOR TOP-RANKED 
CALABASAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADAM BENSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Calabasas High girls' tennis team had a summer full of adventure. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Natasha Pospich competed in the U. S. Olympic Festival. Senior Alison 
Paris and her sister Tracy, a sophomore, traveled to Europe and played on a 
national team that competed against players from the Netherlands, Germany and 
Sweden. Sophomore Stacey Jellen took a two-week break from school this fall to 
play in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to high school tennis might seem dreary after a summer such as many 
of the Coyotes had. But after an agonizing, 10-8 loss to Dana Hills in the 
Southern Section 3-A Division finals, Calabasas has posted a 12-3 record and 
emerged as the favorite for the 3-A championship. The Coyotes, who finish the 
regular season today at home against powerful Miraleste, are ranked No. 1 in 
the division, having defeated second-ranked Beverly Hills and then-No. 3-ranked 
Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
The strong showing is no surprise. Seven players returned from last season, 
including the top three singles players -- Pospich, Jellen and Alison Paris. 
Calabasas was 16-1 and claimed a Frontier League title last year. 
</P>
<P>
After their summer of high-caliber tennis, the Coyotes have lost to only Santa 
Barbara and San Marino, both ranked in the 4-A top 10, and Marlborough. Besides 
the impressive numbers, the team's ability to remain focused has pleased 
second-year Coach Bill Bellatty. He is certain the team will sustain that 
motivation when the playoffs begin a week from today. 
</P>
<P>
"Good players can get their heads together," said Bellatty, who is also the 
boys' basketball coach. "This team has a goal, and they know what it is and 
that it will take wins to get there." 
</P>
<P>
The Coyotes cannot repeat as league champions because the Frontier League has 
discontinued girls' tennis, thus making the chase for the 3-A title more 
urgent. 
</P>
<P>
Bellatty would prefer to compete in a league and secure one championship before 
playing for the division title. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to be in a league and to come in first," Bellatty said. "Now the 
kids don't have that chance. That is why I made the tough schedule." 
</P>
<P>
The strong regular-season competition can only help Pospich, the fifth-ranked 
player in the most recent Southern California Tennis Assn. girls' age 16 group 
and the No. 16 player in the United States -- according to the U.S. Tennis Assn 
-- and Jellen, seventh in the nation in girls' 14s. 
</P>
<P>
"The schedule has more variety," Jellen said. "I like it that we are not just 
going through the motions, playing the same teams twice in one year. I think 
when you face better competition it raises your play." 
</P>
<P>
The summer trips helped many players handle the burden of being every team's 
target this season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as intense here as it was for me in Yugoslavia," Jellen said. 
</P>
<P>
Pospich added: "I've felt a little more pressure, and I think the team has felt 
a little more pressure, because everybody wants to beat us. But being number 
one has also given us confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Jellen accepts the No. 2 position graciously, even though on many teams she 
could play in the top spot. With two more years at Calabasas, she can learn 
from the veteran Pospich. 
</P>
<P>
"We are like best friends," Jellen said. "I play number two, she plays number 
one, and I've never wanted to challenge her." 
</P>
<P>
Alison Paris, No. 3 in singles, lacks national credentials like Pospich's or 
Jellen's but nevertheless is respected. She likely will play tennis at an Ivy 
League school. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Paris and Melissa Pifko form Calabasas' top doubles team. 
</P>
<P>
"Other teams stack their doubles teams against us," Pospich said. "The Beverly 
Hills coach even admitted she put her strongest players in doubles to try and 
beat us, and we ended up beating them by one game. The singles players will 
have to try and motivate the doubles players, because without them we can't 
win. But I think they have the talent to do it."

OXNARD FORFEITS UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After nearly two hours of discussion Wednesday with officials representing 
Buena and Oxnard highs, a Southern Section committee upheld its earlier 
recommendation that Oxnard should forfeit two nonleague football victories in 
which the Yellowjackets used an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands and Camarillo have now been awarded nonleague victories over 
Oxnard, which is now 3-5 overall. The Yellowjackets' Channel League record 
remains 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting at the Southern Section office in Cerritos, Oxnard officials 
appealed the Oct. 1 ruling that senior running back Kelly Kendricks was 
ineligible because he failed to meet change-of-address requirements when he 
transferred to Oxnard from Buena in September. 
</P>
<P>
In their appeal, Oxnard officials accused Buena Coach Rick Scott of undue 
influence, citing a conversation between Scott and Kendrick's mother, Pat 
Ellison. Both parties acknowledged Wednesday that Scott had told Ellison that 
Kendrick, who transferred from Buena to Oxnard the second semester of his 
junior year, would have more playing time at Buena. 
</P>
<P>
But Scott and Ellison gave conflicting accounts of when the conversation took 
place. Scott said it took place before Kendrick had transferred to Oxnard. 
Ellison said it occurred after Kendrick's transfer to Oxnard and prompted her 
inquiry of a transfer back to Buena. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the discrepancy, the committee said no conclusion could be drawn 
from the information available. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard also had sought a hardship case for Kendrick based on a claim that 
Kendrick was compelled to leave Buena when his inter-district transfer was not 
renewed by Buena this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Buena said Kendrick's inter-district transfer, which is reviewed by district 
officials before each school year, was not renewed because of Kendrick's 
alleged involvement in a gang fight at the school in June. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard officials said Kendrick was not properly informed of the revocation 
until school began in September, a claim disputed by Buena officials.

PADRES HIRE RETTENMUND AS HITTING COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Merv Rettenmund, the man who blamed himself for the Oakland Athletics' 
offensive woes during the World Series, was hired Wednesday as the Padre 
hitting coach, replacing Jack Maloof. 
</P>
<P>
The move leaves Rob Picciolo, first-base coach, as the only member of the Padre 
1990 coaching staff who definitely will be retained, Manager Greg Riddoch said. 
The fate of bullpen coach Denny Sommers has yet to be determined, Riddoch said, 
but sources in baseball said that the Padres have contacted other candidates 
about the position. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also have hired Tom Gamboa, former director of field operations for 
the Detroit Tigers, to be their minor league field coordinator. Gamboa, who 
took over as manager at triple-A Toledo in mid-season, currently is managing in 
Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
Rettenmund, 47, joins the Padres after spending the past five years with the 
Athletics, three years as their roving hitting instructor in the minor leagues, 
and the past two seasons as their major league hitting coach. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a job I've wanted for a number of years," said Rettenmund, who played 
in 1976 and 1977 for the Padres, and lives year-round in Rancho Bernardo. "I 
said for years this would be the only place I'd leave the A's for. 
</P>
<P>
"But this has been a tough year for me. There have been times this year when I 
had to practice smiling. There were times this year when I felt like we lost 
100 games, rather than winning 100 games." 
</P>
<P>
When you happen to be hitting coach of the Athletics, a team filled with such 
All-Stars as Jose Canseco, Rickey Henderson, Mark McGwire, nothing less than 
perfection is expected. When the Athletics scored 733 runs (ranked third) and 
batted .254 (ranked 12th) during the regular season, it just wasn't good 
enough. And when they scored only eight runs in five World Series games, 
Rettenmund knew there might be changes. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth," Rettenmund said, "I don't know whether I'd be brought 
back or not. When I told Tony (La Russa, Athletic manager) about this 
opportunity, all he told me was do anything that will make you happy." 
</P>
<P>
So imagine Rettenmund's delight when he returned home from the Athletics' 
organizational meetings last week in Scottsdale, Ariz., and there was a message 
on his answering message from Joe McIlvaine, Padre executive vice 
president/general manager. He asked Rettenmund if he was interested in the job, 
and, if so, ask the Athletics for permission to leave, and contact Manager Greg 
Riddoch. 
</P>
<P>
Rettenmund received permission, took a flight Sunday to Denver to meet with 
Riddoch, arrived back in San Diego on Monday, and was offered the job on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
And moments after he accepted, Maloof was receiving a call at his Chandler, 
Ariz., home, telling him that his services no longer are needed. Maloof, the 
29th member of the Padre front-office or coaching staff who has been fired 
since Sept. 21, was told that he can remain in the organization in 1991, but he 
would be assigned as hitting coach of their double-A Wichita team. Maloof said 
that he will remain with the Padres only as a last resort, and is seeking 
employment elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres batted .254 and scored 325 runs after the All-Star break when Maloof 
was hired, a dropoff from the first half when the Padres batted .262 and scored 
348 runs under batting coach Amos Otis. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very hard situation to work in," Maloof said, "and I knew that all 
along. I was given an opportunity, as short-lived as it was, but I sure would 
have liked to have a full season to show what I could do. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have at least liked to have interviewed for the job with Joe 
McIlvaine, but I never got the opportunity. I was told the job was mine unless 
they found someone who they thought was more qualified, and more capable. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess when you have a chance to get someone from the Oakland A's 
organization, and have some immediate credibility, you go do it. You can't 
blame them for that. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wish I had a chance, that's all."

DEPLETED NUMBERS FORCE MAR VISTA TO FORFEIT GAME 
</P>

Mar Vista High, which lost a number of football players this week because of 
grades and is now down to fewer than 10 players, has forfeited its game Friday 
against Chula Vista. And unless something drastic is done, Mar Vista likely 
will not play its last game of the season the next week against Hilltop. 
</P>
<P>
Mar Vista Coach Sam Coe said losing those players left his team without enough 
players to safely compete against anyone, let alone Chula Vista, which is 
leading the Metro Conference with a 5-0 record (6-2 overall). 
</P>
<P>
Mar Vista (1-7, 1-4 in league) had only 24 players for its game Friday against 
Castle Park, a 37-6 loss. When grades came out this week, Mar Vista was down to 
fewer than 10 players. Coe refused to discuss individual circumstances or how 
many players were ruled ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some grade problems. We had a lot of grade problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sam said last week, 'We might lose five, seven at the most. But we should be 
OK,' " Chula Vista Coach George Ohnesorgen said. "When they lost 18, that just 
blew everything out of the water." 
</P>
<P>
Coe said a number of options were discussed with Mar Vista Principal Jaime 
Mercado and ASB Director Stan Canaris, including bringing up some junior 
varsity players, but the administration decided against that. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't feel it was in our best interest to pull up JV kids and throw them 
to the wolves," Coe said. 
</P>
<P>
The schools' junior varsity teams will play today as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista, which is having its homecoming Friday, had to scramble to get a 
replacement opponent. It managed to get the Institute of Mexico, a private 
school in Tijuana. Game time is 7:30 p.m. at Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, Ohnesorgen wasn't pleased with the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't blame Sam. It's not his fault," Ohnesorgen said. "When a school the 
size of Mar Vista (approximately 1,700 students) can't run a football program 
-- when there are other schools much smaller than them competing -- that's a 
bad situation. I guess that shows what kind of support their administration 
shows toward athletics. It's really an embarrassment to our district and our 
league." 
</P>
<P>
Section Commissioner Kendall Webb said he was informed of the incident by Chula 
Vista. There is no ruling to be made by his office, though Chula Vista did 
question whether it was all right to schedule another game. Under CIF rules, 
forfeitures do not count toward the maximum number of contests permitted during 
the season. In football, teams are allowed to play 10 regular-season games.

COACH WITH THE MOUNTAIN HOME HAS THE DRIVE TO SUCCEED 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
Steve Vukojevich has had a passion for coaching since he was a teen-ager. As 
coach of University City High's football team, he has the only kind of job he's 
ever wanted. He takes the victories and losses, the ups and the downs, in 
stride. It's all part of a rich and fulfilling experience, he says. 
</P>
<P>
But if there is one detail he truly dreads, it is the lonely drive home after a 
loss on Friday night. It's a journey that might seem endless if he lived in 
University City or University Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Vukojevich, however, lives in Julian. 
</P>
<P>
The daily trip Vukojevich (pronounced: Va-KOY-o-Vitch) takes to get to and from 
work has never been simple, and it's not getting any easier. The Centurions 
have lost their past nine night games, dating to a 42-6 defeat to El Camino in 
the 1988 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
For Vukojevich, traveling 120 miles round trip on a narrow, circuitous road has 
become part of what for him is a his wonderful job. Some say it's made him a 
better coach. The football careers of many have been marked by unforgettable 
events that have been dubbed The Catch, The Comeback, The Immaculate Reception. 
Vukojevich's career has come to be known by The Drive. He makes it in a 1990 
Honda Civic that already has 31,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . from Genesee Avenue to Highway 52 east, north on Interstate 15, east 
through Poway onto the narrow, twisting passage that becomes Highway 67. He 
switches his headlights to bright. Soon the boulder-strewn hills of Swartz 
Canyon and the satellite summit of Mt. Woodson appear in the night sky . . . 
</P>
<P>
Friends used to plead with Vukojevich, 50, to stay in the city after 
particularly long work days, like those night-game Fridays, which last 21 hours 
if he decides to drive home. They offer their couches and spare bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
But Vukojevich usually rejects such options, and it's not hard to understand. 
He lives in a hillside hideaway with a breathtaking picture-window view west 
just above the timberline. It is a 1,500-square-foot house with a high-sloping 
ceiling and a giant fireplace and a surrounding redwood deck complete with an 
outdoor hot tub. 
</P>
<P>
The coach has often awakened to discover fresh fallen snow covering the pine 
trees or deer nibbling on wildflowers that grow on the chaparral and manzanita 
brush below his deck. Yet, this is a picture postcard that never would have 
caught his eye. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was up to me, I'd still be in La Mesa," he said. "There are times when 
it's nice to walk outside and you're the only one there. But I'm here because 
my wife wanted to be here." 
</P>
<P>
He was completely happy with the La Mesa home on Morocco Drive, but he bent a 
little to make Beverly happy. But he didn't bend much. He told her if she 
really wanted to move to Julian she'd have to sell the house, which was 
appraised at $115,000, for $130,000. And she'd have to do it on her own, 
without the help of an agent. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly was raised in rural Ellwood City, Pa., where her grandfather owned the 
area's first dairy. She calls herself "a farmer" and "a hick" and conceded she 
never could accept the city life. So, in August, 1984, she moved her husband 
into a place smack in the middle of the Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
"Bigger than hell, she did it," he said. "She did everything I asked her to do. 
She wanted very badly to come up here. I mean really badly." 
</P>
<P>
So now the coach, born in Los Angeles and reared in Laguna Beach, now 
occasionally finds himself victim of "mountain fever," a craziness that comes 
with the solitude. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . steep canyons replace roadside shopping centers. Roadside filling 
stations and convenience stores yield to craft fairs and nurseries. Apartments 
and condominiums vanish into barns, brown pastures, ranch homes and open 
meadows. Oaks replace palms. Deer crossings replace overpasses. Ramona, elev. 
1,440, pop. 12,500 . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Vukojevich jumps out of bed each day at 4 a.m. and is warming up the car 
within 15 minutes. He's usually the first one on the highway, descending from 
the mountain. He's usually at school by 5:40 a.m., nearly two hours before the 
first bell rings. There he showers, shaves and dresses for the day, drinks a 
cup of coffee, eats a doughnut and reads the morning paper. 
</P>
<P>
Only once has he missed a work day because of bad weather. Last winter, he was 
just a few hundred yards from the main highway after creeping over 5 1/2 miles 
of steep, snow-covered back roads when he slipped off an embankment. He had to 
walk back in the dark and chill of the early morning wearing shorts and tennis 
shoes. By that afternoon, he was on campus to run practice for the varsity 
girls basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing there when it snows," he said. "There's no tracks. It's 
another world." 
</P>
<P>
Vukojevich has joked to his assistants that he wants a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
"We said, 'That's a project you ought to put before the boosters,' " football 
assistant Ed Yandall said. "A one-man helicopter would be perfect for him." 
</P>
<P>
As it is, he has little time to spend with Beverly during the week. But that's 
OK, she says. Both admit they're independent of one another. Once, during one 
of the frequent strolls to a nearby Girl Scout campground, Beverly asked Steve 
how his football team finished. That was in May, five months after the season 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
On the weekend, Vukojevich takes frequent naps, so that by Sunday afternoon 
he's refreshed and once again ready for The Drive. 
</P>
<P>
. . . the grade steepens, the air cools. All is still but the swaying 
double-yellow line. An antique shop here, a cabin there. A Christmas tree farm, 
an avocado orchard. Sutherland Dam to the north. Stone Mountain to the south. 
Santa Ysabel 15, Julian 22, Brawley 95 . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Vukojevich says he never once considered teaching at Julian High. He's too 
close to his staff and has too much respect for UC's administration. The 
feelings are mutual. On campus, the coach maintains such a low-key presence 
that a physical education student asked him one Friday, "Are you going to the 
football game today? I hear we have a pretty good team." 
</P>
<P>
UC is 37-43-3 under Vukojevich, who left La Jolla High in 1982 to head the 
staff at the new school. The Centurions have had four winning seasons in eight 
years. They have not won a playoff game in four attempts, and their futility in 
night games has translated to 11 losses in their past 12 attempts. That, and 
that UC is 2-5, 1-2 in the City Western League, has made the drive home seem 
longer than its 60 miles. 
</P>
<P>
But winning never has been a priority for Vukojevich or the administration at 
UC, a school that prides itself on having an academic curriculum that is 
tougher than most. 
</P>
<P>
"(Football) is part of education and that's all it's going to be," Vukojevich 
said softly. "I'm not going to lie about grades to keep (players) eligible. I'm 
not going to try to recruit kids. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little bothered this weekend (after a recent 42-12 loss to La Jolla) 
because we're not playing well. (So when he gets back on the road) I'll be 
rehearsing what we'll be doing for practice, how I'm going to attack trying to 
get our act back together." 
</P>
<P>
. . . 3,000 feet. Grassy meadows surrounded by the first sloping mountains of 
the Laguna range are illuminated by the stars in the sky. There's a chill in 
the air. The autumn leaves have fallen. Seven miles from Julian. Almost home . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 His colleagues say the daily journey and the dramatic change in lifestyle 
haven't changed Vukojevich as a person. But he can no longer hang around during 
the spring to watch his old friend Allan LaMotte, the athletic director, coach 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I catch myself saying, 'I should be going; that damn traffic,' " Vukojevich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very close friends in that we would stop at each other's houses after 
practices. Steve and I shot the bull an awful lot for a lot of years," LaMotte 
said. "Every time there's a storm in the mountains, I wonder if he's going to 
make it." 
</P>
<P>
Vukojevich knows not whether he will someday leave his mountain behind for a 
return to the city life. He's quick to point out he has doesn't like to hunt or 
fish. He has no inherent attraction to the wilderness, other than occasional 
snow and the fall colors. 
</P>
<P>
"I could fight it, I guess," he said. "But I said, 'Hey, I'll try it.' Here I 
am. I'm as happy as I can be."

<P>
The Ryder Cup won't exactly be at stake this weekend when the county's top 
professionals are matched against the top amateurs in the 19th Century Club 
matches at Fairbanks Ranch Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Winning will still be the objective, but it is not the only one. The male 
bonding that transpires this weekend would make the writers of Levis' Cotton 
Dockers commercials proud. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most fun event we play in all year," amateur Bob Imlay said. "It's a 
chance to see some people you don't always run into. It's more like a 
fraternity party than anything." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Bentley, teaching pro at the new Mount Woodson Ranch Golf Club in Ramona, 
agreed: "It's all in fun. It's not like we're at each others' throats." 
</P>
<P>
But in between the jokes and toasts, there is actually some pretty competitive 
golf played. It has been so competitive that the professionals and the amateurs 
are even after 18 matches. 
</P>
<P>
And although every shot is not a matter of life and death, there will be some 
things on the line Saturday and Sunday. The Hine Cup trophy, named after the 
founder of the event, John Hine, is at stake, along with a little pride and the 
opportunity to rib the losing team for the next year. 
</P>
<P>
"People care," said Imlay, the baseball coach at Patrick Henry High School. "It 
isn't a total laugher. There is a lot of choking going on out there. I'm sure 
the people on the team take a loss somewhat personally." 
</P>
<P>
The professionals won in a walk last year. Pro Fred Wood said the lopsided 
score probably will be mentioned a few times over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"You see these guys a lot during the year and you'll always remind them of what 
happened the previous year," said Wood, the pro at Oceanside Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always a very prideful thing, but especially for the professionals," 
Imlay said. "The amateurs also have an ego involved, but the professionals have 
more to lose." 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, the professionals should dominate the series. They tend to be 
more experienced, and some of them have even spent time on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
But the complex scoring system, which combines individual and team play, can 
sometimes even out any advantages the professionals might have. 
</P>
<P>
"You can play well and it can be hidden in the scoring," Imlay said. "Or you 
can play really poorly and your partner can pick you up." 
</P>
<P>
Wood and Bentley say the scoring system isn't the only reason for the series 
being even. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the amateurs on the team play an awful lot," Wood said. "Many of the 
pros spend so much time teaching that they only get to play once a week. You 
need to play this game a lot to excel. There are exceptions, like Scott 
Bentley. Some people are just naturally gifted and they don't have to play that 
much. If Scott played more, he could probably play on the tour." 
</P>
<P>
Bentley, who has played in the Century Club matches once as an amateur and four 
times as a pro, said many of amateurs are just out of college and on the way 
up, whereas some of the professionals are on the downside of their careers. 
</P>
<P>
But Bentley, who played collegiate golf at San Diego State, hardly fits that 
description. He was the Southern California PGA Section champion in 1990, and 
he played in the Bob Hope Desert Classic, the Shearson Lehman Hutton Open and 
the Los Angeles Open. He survived the cut in the San Diego Open and the Los 
Angeles Open. 
</P>
<P>
Bentley also qualified to play in the PGA Championship next summer in Indiana 
by finishing 21st out of 360 in the National Club Pro Championships. 
</P>
<P>
The professionals' roster also includes Cesar Sanudo, who spent time on the PGA 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Duncan, the four-time county amateur champ, and Ken Earle, who finished 
second to Duncan last year, headline the amateur team. 
</P>
<P>
Imlay is playing in his fifth Century Club tournament. He qualified this year 
by finishing third in the Shearson Lehman Hutton San Diego Open qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the frosting on the cake of a golfer's year," said Imlay, 53. "You 
know you had to do something pretty well just to be playing."

CAMPAIGNS: DESPITE A LIKELY LOW TURNOUT OF YOUNG VOTERS, A COMMITTED GROUP OF 
COLLEGE-AGE MEN AND WOMEN IS HARD AT WORK IN POLITICS.

Election day was less than three weeks away, and things seemed to be going well 
enough in the Dianne Feinstein for Governor campaign. The Democratic 
gubernatorial candidate and her entourage of staff, security, family and the 
press would arrive at this Encino home for another in a long series of campaign 
fund-raisers, and Mia Bernstein's part in all this was simple, really. 
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old San Fernando Valley woman -- a campaign intern and member of 
the Feinstein advance team -- was mainly needed to bring the small public 
address system from her own house, just blocks away, before greeting the 
candidate at curbside. Bernstein, like other young, novice campaign workers 
spread throughout the state's various political races, had found in her six 
weeks on the Feinstein staff that more experienced election strategists were 
counting on her. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend luncheon would run flawlessly, even if Feinstein arrived a bit 
ahead of schedule, and ahead of some of the press. Bernstein could smile easily 
in a way she couldn't have imagined early last month, when it was her 
high-pressure responsibility to gather a crowd of about 700 supporters for a 
post-debate rally in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of polls that reflect a consistently low turnout for voters between 
the ages of 18 and 24, Bernstein is part of a tight, committed group of 
college-age men and women working in politics for the first time. Their 
involvement ranges from the grass-roots busywork of hanging campaign placards 
and telephone solicitation to meaningful roles in the offices of candidates and 
political parties. 
</P>
<P>
In the Valley, only Cal State Northridge and Glendale Community College can 
claim active campus Democratic and Republican clubs working in the local and 
statewide campaigns leading up to Tuesday's election. But it's actually the 
efforts of individual students from these and other local campuses such as Los 
Angeles Valley College and Pierce College that may be having the most direct 
and lasting impact on contemporary politics, say student organizers in both 
gubernatorial camps. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came into the campaign, I was given a lot of responsibility, and that 
was amazing to me in the beginning," Bernstein said, pausing briefly after the 
Encino event before driving down to the campaign's Wilshire Boulevard offices. 
"I was in shock. I was so nervous the first time I met her." 
</P>
<P>
The presence of youthful campaign workers can offer a candidacy what the older 
pols describe as a more excited atmosphere in what otherwise might become a dry 
season of campaign rhetoric, charges and countercharges. "I think they bring an 
enthusiasm," said George Gorton, campaign director for Republican gubernatorial 
hopeful Sen. Pete Wilson. "And they charge the candidate up like crazy. He 
walks in and they cheer and shout. The candidate really gets pumped up." 
</P>
<P>
Gorton's experience with the youngest section of the electorate runs deeper 
than most of his fellow political consultants. In 1972, he worked in President 
Richard Nixon's reelection campaign as national college director. And it has 
been with his encouragement that the state Republican Party has embarked this 
year on a massive drive to recruit college and high school students into the 
election effort, hoping to capitalize on polls conducted by the Wilson campaign 
that revealed strong support for the Republican among young voters. 
</P>
<P>
According to Stephanie Schroder, the party's state youth director, more than 
5,000 students have been organized for the Republican cause. It's the first 
large-scale student outreach Gorton has seen since the 1974 race for governor 
between Democrat Jerry Brown and Republican Houston Flournoy. He said that 
before this year's effort, campaigns all but ignored the youth vote. 
</P>
<P>
Gorton, 43, said he always believed that the young electorate was an untapped 
source of votes, even during the 1972 election, when organizing for a 
Republican candidate on radicalized college campuses was a daunting task. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in those days, people really cultivated them," he explained. "That was 
the first year that 18-year-olds had the right to vote." 
</P>
<P>
It was the prospect of helping to elect the state's first female governor that 
attracted Laramy Blohm, 20, to volunteer at the Feinstein campaign headquarters 
last July. A psychology student at CSUN, Blohm began by coming in every day to 
help work the telephones, calling congressional offices across the state 
looking for more campaign volunteers. Three weeks later, she was offered a 
paid, part-time position as the office receptionist. 
</P>
<P>
"For a 20-year-old, it's not like an average job," Blohm said. "It's not like 
working at a tanning salon or something." 
</P>
<P>
Before now, Blohm's interest in politics hadn't reached any further than voting 
on Election Day. Her plan with the Feinstein campaign was originally to just 
get a taste of politics. 
</P>
<P>
"My interest in government has been increasing every day," said Blohm, who 
hopes to go to law school. "Like Mia, the more responsibilities I take on, and 
the more people that I meet, the more my interest expands. So now it would be a 
goal for me to work in the government." 
</P>
<P>
Danette Dugas was juggling phone calls again one afternoon, surrounded by the 
stately photographic portraits of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, and 
pausing only to direct visitors through the plush Burbank offices of the 
California Republican Party. The 20-year-old Valley College business major had 
only been working there about four weeks, and already she was a paid member of 
the special events staff. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably at first it seemed overwhelming," she said, "but it's a very 
comfortable atmosphere. It just takes a little getting used to." 
</P>
<P>
Work within the party offers students an inside look at the election process, 
while adding some job security that no campaign offers after Election Day. The 
office work can also carry more substance than the sign-hanging of typical 
campaigns, explained Dan Schnur, Republican Party communications director. 
</P>
<P>
It was the job itself that first attracted Anna Blishak as a 17-year-old to the 
party three years ago -- that and the close proximity of its headquarters to 
her high school. Her parents were longtime Republican voters, but an interest 
in politics developed only after she started to work for the party. And the 
intention of the Valley College business major to remain active with the party, 
regardless of where her career takes her, reflects what Gorton said is a 
tendency of young voters to follow indefinitely their earliest political 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to stay involved somehow, whether it's volunteering or whatever," 
Blishak said. "It's been around me these past three years, and it's part of my 
life now. I can't imagine not being involved at all." 
</P>
<P>
During an election year, much of the political excitement and attention 
inevitably focuses on the individual candidates, leaving the party to work more 
behind the scenes. But David Knatcal, a 22-year-old CSUN political science 
major who has worked in the Republicans' communications department the last 15 
months, said he feels connected with all levels of the election. 
</P>
<P>
"I much prefer it," Knatcal said. "It gives you such a broad view of 
everything. You're involved in, conceivably, every race. Being the California 
Republican Party, we're in touch with the whole state. There are certain 
advantages to being focused on one campaign, but I think I'm learning a lot 
more here." 
</P>
<P>
On Valley campuses, only a handful of student clubs representing Democrats or 
Republicans are active this election year. Knatcal, a member of the CSUN 
Republican group a few years ago, said his commitment had grown beyond the club 
by the time he volunteered at the Burbank party office. 
</P>
<P>
For this election at least, it appears that the clubs are designed more to 
educate their members than to do any meaningful campaigning for the various 
party candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say people join the club just to get a general idea of the Republican 
Party," explained Dave Louden, 20, president of the Republican club at Glendale 
College. The state's 28 ballot propositions, he said, "are so long and involved 
a lot of people aren't quite sure how the party stands on them, what they 
mean." 
</P>
<P>
The Republican club at CSUN began having regular meetings again only last 
month, after at least a year of inactivity. And the school's young Democratic 
organization was able only to get its members out to campaign for the party 
last weekend. Both club rosters list about two dozen members, although it is 
usually a core of about 10 that regularly participates in group activities. 
</P>
<P>
"We've kind of missed the boat, unfortunately, at least at this point with the 
gubernatorial and state assembly," admitted Doug Winger, 21, vice president of 
the CSUN Republican group. "But in the next year or two, we've got quite a few 
campaigns coming up. And personally, I would like to get more involved." 
</P>
<P>
The CSUN Democrats were successful in bringing former Gov. Jerry Brown, now 
state party leader, to speak on the campus in early October. Club president 
David Weiss said the group was also working to get students living away from 
home to vote by mail. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss, a 20-year-old political science major, has worked beyond the confines of 
his club as the only college-age volunteer for Irene Allert, Democratic 
candidate for the 38th Assembly District. At a recent Wednesday afternoon 
meeting of the club, he said he was even happy to see his rivals in the CSUN 
Republicans organizing again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm actually glad that they are, because I think it's important that students 
have that option," Weiss said. "It makes me angry when students aren't involved 
and they don't care about the political process. And I'd rather see them, as 
much as I hate to say this, active in the Republican Party than nothing at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
To observers, a career in politics may have seemed an obvious path for Mia 
Bernstein, but she said she was slow to realize it herself. Her mother is Sandy 
Miller, longtime chief of staff for state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana). As a 
toddler, young Mia often accompanied her mother to political functions. Still, 
Bernstein did not immediately choose political science as her major at UC Santa 
Barbara, and the initial idea to join the Feinstein campaign as an intern 
started as a suggestion from her mother. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though I was always surrounded by politics, I voted, but never got into 
it until now," Bernstein said, sitting in a Wilshire Boulevard office 
surrounded by signs and posters of her candidate. "I always understood it, but 
it was something that was out there, not part of me. 
</P>
<P>
"The stuff that we studied was international relations and history, like what 
happened during the Depression. And except for a couple of classes in public 
policy, I haven't had any actual 'This is what's happening today.' I think I'm 
learning more here than I ever would in school. Absolutely."

CLUB MIXES BUSINESS, PLEASURE; 
</P>
<P>
SOCIALIZING: HI-NET GIVES LATINO PROFESSIONALS AN ALTERNATIVE FROM THE SINGLES 
SCENE AND A VENUE TO MAKE PROFITABLE CONTACTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
While cutting up the dance floor with the tango or cumbia, some Latinos in Los 
Angeles are also cutting business deals. 
</P>
<P>
They describe themselves as "upwardly mobile singles," who are tired of the 
tawdry nightclub scenes and the dry atmosphere found in business organizations. 
</P>
<P>
They belong to Hispanic Network, an organization where talk of the Harvard 
Business Review's latest case study may lead to a candlelight dinner 
invitation. 
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1988, Hi-Net, as founder Carlos Rodriguez calls his club, moved from 
Century City to the San Fernando Valley earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 Hi-Net members pay $150 annual dues to attend dances held on the last 
Friday of each month at the Glendale Holiday Inn. Members spend the early 
evening browsing through product brochures and swapping business cards. The 
later hours are reserved for dancing and socializing. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, 36, said his club benefits the newly arrived immigrant because most 
members are immigrants themselves and can assist others in learning the ropes 
of American city life. 
</P>
<P>
"When you first arrive, you have to establish credit and get a job. It takes 
connections, someone you know that can get you in," said Rodriguez, a Burbank 
resident who arrived in Los Angeles from Lima, Peru, 17 years ago. "At Hi-Net, 
it's easy to set up opportunities for employers and immigrants to sit down and 
talk." 
</P>
<P>
The majority of Hi-Net members were professionals in their native countries, 
Rodriguez said. His organization provides a job-referral service and also 
recommends various services such as doctors, lawyers and stockbrokers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, however, refused to allow interviews with newly arrived immigrants. 
"We are a very discreet organization," he said. "The first thing we guard among 
ourselves is privacy." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez formed his organization after disappointing experiences with chambers 
of commerce "where members were either married or too old." He also joined the 
Young Executive Singles Network in West Los Angeles after his divorce in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I met nice people, but all were Anglos," said Rodriguez, who has operated his 
own communications consulting firm in Burbank for six years. "When it comes to 
a personal relationship, I am too old-fashioned -- too Latin -- to date anyone 
who is not of my culture or my Catholic religion. So I said, 'Wouldn't it be 
great if there was a networking group just for Latins?' I did some research and 
found out there wasn't any group serving that need. So I started my own." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez advertises Hi-Net in the Spanish-language newspaper La Opinion, and 
several popular Spanish-language television talk shows have featured him as a 
guest. 
</P>
<P>
Many of organizations exist for Latinos, but they are geared toward the 
business community -- such as the Latin Business Assn., formed in 1976 and 
based in Los Angeles, and the Consul of Mexican-American Organizations in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
But Hi-Net mixes pleasure with business. Gatherings are often theme-oriented 
celebrations for the independence days of members' native countries, such as 
Argentina, Peru, Brazil, Ecuador and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very much in support of Carlos' effort," said Al Amezcua, president of 
the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Orange County. "It brings cultures and 
people together. It's a good alternative to bar-hopping. He's done a great job 
of uniting people with the same goals, ideals and interests." 
</P>
<P>
Through informal polls, Rodriguez has assembled a profile of his members: The 
predominant age range is from 20 to 40; 60% are women; 40% are business owners; 
40% hold management positions; 80% are Republican; 2% are white; and 10% are 
married. Most have annual incomes that exceed $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent Hi-Net function, about 60 members filled the Glendale Holiday Inn's 
main ballroom. "The place really starts hopping just before midnight," 
Rodriguez said as he tidied rows of business cards and product brochures that 
lined two tables at the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Groups of men and women sat at a round table, eating hors d'oeuvres retrieved 
from a corner buffet table. Four women in their 50s sat eyeing a group of men 
huddled around a corner bar. When asked why groups of men and women were 
segregated, one of the women, Rose Melgar, said, "Yes! Why?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time we have come," said Melgar, a retired secretary who moved 
to America from Guatemala 23 years ago. "Maybe we're all a little, you know, 
nervous." 
</P>
<P>
Melgar and her friend Suzy Allahyar saw Hi-Net featured on a Spanish television 
program four months ago. They attend no other Latino-oriented clubs in Los 
Angeles "because we didn't hear very good things about them," said Allahyar, 
who moved to Los Angeles from Honduras 28 years ago. "There just aren't many 
nice places for Hispanics to go. There's too much drinking and fighting going 
on." 
</P>
<P>
That sentiment was expressed by both younger and older members. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't go to other clubs anymore, because you just meet jerks," said Monica 
Gonzalez, 27, who sat with her sisters, Norma, 20, and Raquel, 18. 
</P>
<P>
Monica Gonzalez, an East Los Angeles hairdresser, listed the qualities she is 
looking for in a mate. "He's got to be educated, respectable, honest, good job, 
ambitious, handsome, have some money and a sense of humor," she said. Her 
sisters laughed and wished her good luck. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not all here to necessarily meet a certain guy," said Norma Gonzalez, an 
undeclared major at East Los Angeles College. "We're here just to have a good, 
clean time. It's the only place around you can go to meet respectable people." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez took the stage and asked all the single men and women to raise their 
hands. "Now, if you're a woman and want to dance, raise your hand," he said, as 
two disc jockeys flipped through records by Nelson Diaz Y La Constelacion, 
Juana La Cubana and Paolo Salvatore. Several men dressed in Armani and Hugo 
Boss suits stepped onto the central parquet dance floor, threading their way to 
tables on the other side of the room. 
</P>
<P>
Edy and Angel Vizcaino had just arrived from work. "As dedicated business 
people, we're at the office about seven days a week," said Edy Vizcaino, 30, 
who owns Ecuatorian Express, a Whittier-based trucking company that his 
brother, Angel, manages. "I've made a lot of friends here, but no dates yet." 
</P>
<P>
The Vizcaino brothers, who arrived from Ecuador 12 years ago and now live in 
Whittier, have attended Hi-Net for five months. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Vizcaino, 32, said he has made several business contacts at the dances, 
among them an oil filter manufacturer that has agreed to ship its goods via 
Ecuatorian Express. The two companies struck their business partnership through 
a Hi-Net function. 
</P>
<P>
When asked why, after five months, the brothers hadn't begun dating other 
members, Edy Vizcaino said, "If you go looking for love, you just might be 
trying too hard. Right now, I'm working on establishing good friends with 
women. Romance may come later. That's my policy. 
</P>
<P>
"If I find the right girl here, I'd be glad to get serious. But right now, I'm 
a dedicated workaholic."

MORE FIRMS REFUSE TO CALL IT A NIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
HOURS: COMPANIES RANGING FROM APPLIANCE REPAIR SHOPS TO PHARMACIES ARE CASHING 
IN ON A GROWING DEMAND FOR SERVICES IN THE WEE HOURS.

It's 3 a.m. You hear a noise in the attic -- a thwaaang sound that tells you 
something big was snatched by traps the pest-control men set last week. But the 
commotion has produced sounds of scurrying -- a small river of rodent feet 
crisscrosses the floorboards above you. You imagine that they seek some sort of 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
Can't sleep? There's good news for insomniacs beset by rodents, computer 
breakdowns, dental aches, thoughts of lost keys, dirty laundry and more. Just 
look for the flashing neon sign: "Open 24 Hours." 
</P>
<P>
More businesses are advertising around-the-clock services, partly in response 
to increasing demand. 
</P>
<P>
"Nationwide, there are 20 million people still active at midnight," said 
Timothy Schneider, founder and publisher of the 24HOURS Emergency Yellow Pages 
published in Santa Monica. The numbers were released by the U.S. Bureau of 
Labor Statistics. "That number drops to its low point of 10 million at 3 a.m. 
-- so there's never less than 10 million active at some point during the night. 
More and more businesses are seeking a competitive advantage by extending their 
hours." 
</P>
<P>
Rex Beaber, a West Los Angeles psychologist and attorney, said an increase in 
two-income families has contributed to the trend. "Lack of a homebound spouse 
who is free during the day to run errands means errands need to be run during 
off-hours," Beaber said. "But customers pay a premium when they shop a 24-hour 
establishment. I call it a convenience tax -- they have to pick up the extra 
costs that are needed to stay open late." 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the consumer demand, Pacific Bell caters to insomniacs by printing 
an Extended Hours Guide at the back of its Yellow Pages book. 
</P>
<P>
Need more help? Following is a partial list of San Fernando Valley businesses 
that offer 24-hour service. All businesses are available seven days a week at 
no extra charge, unless otherwise noted.

Electing to Serve 
</P>
<P>
Theresa Wessig of Canoga Park has been serving as a precinct election clerk 
since 1950. She became an election inspector, supervising voting in her 
precinct, in 1952. For more than two decades, she has opened her home as an 
election polling place. And, come Tuesday, she'll be at it again. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Patterson, a county Registrar of Voters supervisor, wishes that there 
were a lot more like Wessig. With 276 precincts in the San Fernando Valley, 
Patterson is always on the lookout for a few good living rooms, or garages, or 
businesses that will allow her to set up her voting booths for the Election Day 
siege. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson also needs 1,205 people to man the polling places, and it's still not 
too late to serve for Tuesday's election, she said. "We are fairly well-staffed 
in most precincts, but there still some vacancies. And we always have people 
who say they will work and can't make it, so we need others to fill in." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone interested in serving as an election official should be prepared to be 
at the assigned polling place by 6:30 a.m. and stay until 8:30 p.m. It's also a 
good idea to bring a sack lunch and wear comfortable clothing, she said. 
</P>
<P>
People who serve as clerks earn $45 for the day and are instructed in their 
duties when they report to the polling place, which is usually as near to their 
residences as possible. Inspectors receive 1 1/2 hours of instruction, usually 
in a classroom situation, and earn $60 for the day. 
</P>
<P>
The number to call to volunteer either services for this election or voting 
space in the future is (213) 725-5919. 
</P>
<P>
And if you do decide to serve, be thankful for voting machines. "When I started 
on the boards," Wessig said, "we used to have to stay up all night and count 
the ballots." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hit the Road 
</P>
<P>
Terry Hottman, who is in the marriage repair business in Encino, says the 
marital state is sometimes a tough place to be in today's complex world. 
</P>
<P>
"Marriage has never been uncomplicated, but roles used to be more clear-cut," 
said Hottman, who holds a master's degree in marriage and family counseling and 
is often asked by divorce lawyers to help clients whose marriages are on the 
brink of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Some matters of marital contention are as old as time, Hottman said, like the 
loss of communication between partners. But other issues are relatively new, 
like what's expected of you if your partner goes into Alcoholics Anonymous or 
some other 12-step program. 
</P>
<P>
"About a third of my practice involves people who are starting to work a 
program and are trying to cope with the changes this makes in the way the 
entire family relates to one another. Sometimes the partner not in the program 
needs to begin working on his or her co-dependency. Sometimes the children need 
to be in a program designed for them," Hottman said. 
</P>
<P>
Another third of his practice has to do with cross-cultural marriages or 
blended families, as in his, hers and ours. "There are many areas of confusion 
when couples marry someone from a different background and the same is true of 
people who are marrying for the second time. It takes a lot of patience and 
understanding to sort out all the nuances of these kinds of unfamiliar or new 
relationships." 
</P>
<P>
Another part of Hottman's practice, he said, deals with people who have had or 
are having affairs. "Affairs put stress on a marriage and can cause one or both 
partners to consider divorce," Hottman said, but he added that often the affair 
is symptomatic of something else. 
</P>
<P>
Hottman said that being a counselor doesn't mean that relationships are any 
easier for him. "Therapists are at greater risk, in a way, because they are 
used to taking other people's inventories, and they can be manipulative," he 
said. "You really have to be aware and listen to yourself." 
</P>
<P>
His advice for helping couples get over rocky times, when they are rubbing each 
other every way but right, is take a hike. 
</P>
<P>
Together. 
</P>
<P>
"A brisk walk will do wonders for your outlook on life, as well as your 
health." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Artistry in Marketing 
</P>
<P>
If you are moving in the near future, expect to receive a ton of mail offering 
goods and services, including a note from the Wing Gallery in Sherman Oaks 
promising a free gift. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Wing, the entrepreneurial force behind the gallery, is not giving away 
Rembrandts, but she is making a present of a small print by American primitive 
artist Charles Wysocki in an effort to make new friends for her establishment. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the economy doesn't seem to be in a snit, selling art is a challenge 
because there are so many other things to do with discretionary income, so Wing 
has made an art form of soft-sell inducements to bring in new customers. 
</P>
<P>
One of the ways she does this is to offer children's programs occasionally 
because "we think that exposing people to art and an artistic environment at an 
early age will bring them back when they are adults," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery also invites artists to come and share an afternoon with patrons, 
as Wysocki, who lives in the Lake Arrowhead area, will do between 1 and 5 p.m. 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mall Karma 
</P>
<P>
Before we all start picking out a burial shroud for the economy, take a look at 
the local shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
It's not the Christmas rush yet, but some of the malls look as if they're about 
to reach critical mass. If everyone is so worried about federal, state and 
personal finances, who are all these people shoving cash and plastic at 
salespeople? 
</P>
<P>
Patrick McGowan, who works in ladies shoes in the Glendale Galleria's 
Nordstrom, said he couldn't explain what's going on, nor could Yolanda Denike 
in women's wear. Topanga Plaza and Northridge Fashion Center are jammed, as is 
the Sherman Oaks Galleria. Is there some kind of shopping center karma that 
draws those presumably in financially distress and makes them surrender the 
contents of their wallets at the cash registers? 
</P>
<P>
The most amazing manifestation of the phenomena is the newly opened Antelope 
Valley Mall. 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Marshall, who sometimes sits at a desk at the entrance to Harris' taking 
credit card applications, said: "It really is strange. The day before the mall 
opened, no one was here. The next day, it looked like people had been shopping 
here all their lives." 
</P>

MICROWAVE: QUICK COLD WEATHER SOUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA, Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery.

<TEXT>
<P>
When temperatures begin to fall and winds begin to rise, nothing can warm body 
and soul faster than a steaming bowl of homemade soup. 
</P>
<P>
But who wants to stand over a steamy kettle all day? The good news for 
microwave owners is that you don't have to. In fact, you can brew up the 
following soup in less than 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Better still, you won't have to worry about these microwave soups boiling over, 
boiling dry or scorching. They are virtually fail-safe if you follow directions 
to the letter. 
</P>
<P>
But one word of caution. Don't try to brown the onions for the French onion 
soup in the microwave. They will turn bitter and rubbery. To overcome the 
problem, simply mix a little sugar and gravy browner into the onions. 
</P>
<P>
FRENCH ONION SOUP 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon liquid gravy browner 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound Spanish or yellow onions, very thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
1 quart beef broth 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon black pepper 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
French bread 
</P>
<P>
Place butter in wax-paper-covered, microwave-safe 2 1/2-quart casserole. 
Microwave on HIGH (100% power) 35 to 45 seconds. Mix in liquid gravy browner 
and sugar. Add onions and toss with butter mixture. Cover with wax paper and 
microwave on HIGH 9 to 10 minutes, or until onions are almost tender. 
</P>
<P>
Add broth and pepper. Cover with casserole lid and microwave on HIGH 9 to 10 
minutes, until mixture boils, stirring at half time. 
</P>
<P>
Stir again and develop flavors by microwaving on MEDIUM (50% power) 5 to 7 
minutes. Season to taste with salt. Ladle soup into bowls and serve with French 
bread. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Variation: 
</P>
<P>
French Onion Soup au Gratin: 
</P>
<P>
Prepare soup as directed. While it simmers, toast 4 (3/8-inch) slices French 
bread. Ladle soup into 4 individual flameproof casseroles. Float toast slice on 
each and sprinkle each with 1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese. Set casseroles 
in preheated broiler, 4 inches from heat, and broil about 1 minute until cheese 
melts and is tipped with brown.

GROWERS, ENVIRONMENTALISTS URGED TO SEEK HARMONY; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: DESPITE COMPETING BALLOT INITIATIVES, SIERRA CLUB AND CALIFORNIA FARM 
BUREAU SAY THEY SHOULD FOCUS ON AREAS OF AGREEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state's environmental and agribusiness interests, traditionally bitter 
political foes, are searching for common ground on issues such as land use, 
pesticide practices, air pollution and water quality in the decade ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The animosity between the growers and conservationists has reached a peak in 
recent years, what with the 1986 passage of Proposition 65 and its attendant 
cancer warnings, the Alar controversy of 1989 and a virtually constant debate 
over pesticide residues in food. 
</P>
<P>
But at a produce industry conference last week in Newport Beach, leaders of 
both the Sierra Club and the California Farm Bureau -- two decidedly dissimilar 
organizations -- said the two groups should spend more time on areas of 
agreement and less on "name calling." 
</P>
<P>
Such agreement, even if superficial, is unusual, particularly on the eve of 
Tuesday's election, when voters will be asked to decide on competing ballot 
measures -- environmentalist-sponsored Proposition 128 (the "Big Green" 
initiative) or the food-industry-sponsored Proposition 135 (the so-called 
"Careful" initiative). 
</P>
<P>
Both measures deal extensively with the state's pesticide regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 128, among other things, would ban outright 19 farm chemicals 
because of carcinogenic or mutagenic evidence. It would also mandate a 
scientific review of dozens of other suspect agricultural compounds for similar 
toxicity and possible ban. 
</P>
<P>
Food industry interests claim Proposition 128 would raise food prices by as 
much as 30%. Supporters of the initiative dismiss such statements as false. 
</P>
<P>
On the other end of the spectrum, Proposition 135 would take a more cautious 
approach to regulating such chemicals. Favored by farm interests, the 
initiative would double the number of food samples tested for pesticide 
residues in California and fund development of improved testing methods. It 
would also establish provisions for banning unsafe pesticides, but only after a 
"comprehensive" review of scientific data by an advisory panel. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists claim Proposition 135 will result in higher taxes and dilute 
current pesticides laws. Supporters of the initiative state that the measure 
offers true farm chemical reform and creates a new state agency for food safety 
to implement such change. 
</P>
<P>
The advertisements and campaign literature for the competing propositions seem 
to indicate that the strains between environmentalists and agriculture are 
irreparable. Yet, attendees of the Western Growers Assn. annual meeting heard 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"We want a part in charting the new decade," said Bob Vice, California Farm 
Bureau president. "We need to align ourselves with other groups and, yes, that 
includes the environmentalists. After all, who is more concerned about the 
environment than farmers?" 
</P>
<P>
Vice, who chairs the "Yes on 135" committee, said that the agriculture sector 
comprises only 2% of this state's population and that future coalitions are 
essential. (On the other hand, California's food industry constitutes the 
largest segment of the state's economy, according to various estimates, and 
carries considerable financial clout.) 
</P>
<P>
Vice conceded that agriculture needs to "change" its approach to farming as 
well as how it works with other special-interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to change our attitudes about how we look at environmental issues. 
Agriculture must improve its image with environmentalists and the public," Vice 
said. "We are using 50% less pesticides on my ranch than 10 years ago and we 
are not getting that kind of information out. Growers are looking for ways to 
use fewer chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club's state director, Mike Paparian, also had conciliatory words. 
"We have common concerns and they can come together in the 1990s," he said. 
"Environmentalists and agriculture need to work more closely than is the case 
today." 
</P>
<P>
One area where Paparian believes there should be more cooperation is on the 
volatile issue of pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
"Beyond the ballot initiatives, the interests of farmers and environmentalists 
should converge on pesticide issues," he said. "If there are (health) problems 
with pesticides then it will show up in (the farmer's) family and in (his/her) 
drinking water before it is evident in the urban population. (Growers) are on 
the front lines of pesticide issues." 
</P>
<P>
Vice said that growers may never be able to satisfy certain environmentalists 
on the pesticide question but that other issues -- such as water conservation 
-- might find more agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Both Vice and Paparian pointed to the California Legislature's recent passage 
of an extensive organic foods labeling act as an area of mutual concern. The 
bill, which was signed by Gov. George Deukmejian, received broad support, 
including some from conservative farm groups. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the environmentalists were surprised that the Western Growers Assn. 
and other ag groups supported the organic farming bill," Vice said. "But it was 
an area that was of some benefit to our members." 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear if this meeting was a breakthrough in relations or whether the 
kind words were only for the benefit of the audience. What is certain is that 
the seminar, "The Environmental Challenge -- Rough Seas Ahead," was 
appropriately titled.

CULINARY SOS: ICE CREAM PIE FOR ADDICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR READERS: It's my turn. One sweet-tooth-taste of Velvet Turtle Turtle Pie, 
and I was hooked. It took two people and two days in The Times Test Kitchen to 
test this long-winded, but ultra-delicious frozen ice cream pie. But if you 
have the stamina and patience, you won't be sorry. And neither will your 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
VELVET TURTLE TURTLE PIE 
</P>
<P>
3 egg whites, at room temperature 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup ground hazelnuts 
</P>
<P>
Dash ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
3 quarts almond praline ice cream 
</P>
<P>
Crumb Crust 
</P>
<P>
Caramel Fudge Sauce 
</P>
<P>
Whipped cream, optional 
</P>
<P>
Beat egg whites until whites are glossy and hold soft peaks. Gradually add 
sugar, whipping until stiff but not dry. Sprinkle in ground nuts and cinnamon 
and beat just until blended.

 Coffee has gone new-wave and become big business. These days, gimmicky brews 
taste like raspberries, mint, orange, chocolate -- there's even an Irish cream 
bean that tries to fool you into thinking you've just had a drink with more 
kick than coffee. But die-hard coffee hounds scorn that stuff. They want a cup 
of coffee that tastes like . . . coffee. Sound easy? Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
But the Seattle-based Starbucks Coffee Co. chain ("Starbuck" was the 
coffee-loving first mate in "Moby Dick") knows just what it takes to create a 
good cup of coffee. They start with all premium arabica beans (arabicas have 
50% less caffeine, cost more, and are scarcer than the robusta beans found in 
most canned commercial coffees). The beans are then roasted in small batches to 
a full city roast -- a rich, chestnut brown color that produces a fuller, less 
acid flavor. Once roasted, the beans are immediately packed and shipped to 
ensure their freshness. Freshness is so important to Starbucks that after eight 
days they donate all unsold beans to charity. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of coffees (both regular and decaf) are available. For java gourmets 
the Kenya ($7.85 per pound) makes an intense, snappy brew. If you're new to 
premium coffees, the House Blend ($7.65 per pound) is a light-bodied blend of 
Latin American coffees with a rich aroma. Espresso Roast ($7.75 per pound) 
makes a dark brew with full flavor and slight acidity and is ideal for making 
cappuccino. The Exclusive Blends Sampler -- House Blend, Viennese Blend, Caffe 
Verona and Gold Coast Blend -- at $16.70 for four half-pound bags would make a 
nice gift, or first-time buyers could use the sampler for taste comparisons. 
Add $2.95 to the first $20 purchase for surface shipping and handling or $3.95 
for a purchase up to $40. If you prefer your coffee to arrive by two-day air, 
it will cost $5.75 for shipping and handling on a $20 purchase amount, $8.25 on 
orders up to $40. A trained staff is available to answer any questions. KATHIE

YOU ASKED ABOUT: IS THIS BEAN GOOD TO EAT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Is this a carob bean? (The reader had included a pod in the envelope 
along with the note.) If so, how do you use it? I've read where you can chew on 
them, like beef jerky. How do you make powder out of them? We have lots of them 
going to waste. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: At Sego Nursery in North Hollywood, we confirmed the pod was indeed a 
carob bean and obtained a few more from the owner's tree to use for 
photography. A variety of other sources, including David Lasgren of the L.A. 
County Arboreta &amp; Botanic Gardens in Arcadia, assisted in researching 
answers to the reader's other questions. 
</P>
<P>
Carob pods are produced by a variety of evergreen tree (Ceratonia siliqua) 
native to Mediterranean countries. The long seed pod shows that it is a legume, 
related to beans and peas. 
</P>
<P>
Carob is an ancient food. Seeds and pods have been found in ancient Egyptian 
tombs. It's said the locusts referred to in the biblical story of St. John 
living in the wilderness on locusts and honey are not the locust insect (the 
grasshopper) but the pod of the locust (or carob) tree. This explains the 
alternative name for carob -- St. John's Bread. 
</P>
<P>
The plants were introduced to the United States in 1850. In 1922, a commercial 
planting of carob seedlings was promoted in Southern California, so it's not 
hard to understand why so many of these trees now exist in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Only female carob trees produce the pods, beginning when the trees are 5 years 
old. Productivity increases each year according to the weather and other 
environmental factors. 
</P>
<P>
Carob is often compared to chocolate. All the sources we checked, however, say 
this is unfair; to expect real chocolate flavor from carob is asking too much 
of any legume. 
</P>
<P>
Because carob is nearly 50% sugar, it's true that the washed and dried pods can 
be chewed as a sort of candy. Because it contains tannin, however, one source 
recommended that carob be used in moderation, especially in children's diets. 
</P>
<P>
"St. John's Bread -- the Carob Cookbook" (Jurupa Mountains Cultural Center, 
1975) by Edith E. Wilkin and Ruth A. Kirkby provides the following two methods 
of making carob pods into powder: 
</P>
<P>
"First, remove the seeds from the pods and then break (the pods) into small 
pieces. (In my innocence, the first time I didn't even take the seeds out. 
There's no harm in them, just not much nutrition and flavor. The seeds are 
beautiful, though, and might be a natural for jewelry making.) Put the (pod) 
pieces into a coffee grinder and spin until carob is powdered. Put through a 
sieve to remove any larger particles. Store in an airtight container. 
</P>
<P>
"Or you can put your washed pods in a pressure cooker with about 3/4 cup water. 
Process them at 15 pounds pressure for 20 minutes. Drain, cool and dry them. 
Cut them open with kitchen shears and remove the seeds. Cut the pods into short 
lengths. If the pods are still moist, dry them again before grinding them to a 
powder." 
</P>
<P>
"Juel Andersen's Carob Primer" (Creative Arts Communications) by Robin Clute, 
Juel Andersen with Sigrid Andersen explains that the carob powder that you 
purchase is usually roasted: "This gives it a dark, rich color and improves the 
flavor." 
</P>
<P>
To roast the powder, place "the carob powder on an ungreased baking sheet in a 
low (150-degree) oven until it is rich brown and smells delicious. You can also 
roast carob powder in an unoiled, heavy skillet over low heat. Stir frequently 
until browned, but not burnt." 
</P>
<P>
Carob seeds may be eaten as a snack, but they are more often ground to produce 
a gum called tragasol, used as a binding for foods and a variety of other 
products.

CHEF'S SECRETS: OH SOUP OF THE EVENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
I dare you to identify the mystery ingredient -- eggplant -- in this exotic 
soup. Near impossible. Yet eggplant soup is one of the most popular items on 
the menu at Patrick Healy's Champagne Restaurant in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I love eggplant," said Healy. 
</P>
<P>
He must. Healy uses eggplant in all three menus (contemporary, rustic and spa) 
offered at Champagne. 
</P>
<P>
But that is not odd for an American chef whose culinary roots were formed in 
the south of France, where eggplant is the king of Mediterranean vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
"Eggplant fits beautifully into my spa menu because it is naturally low in 
calories and has no fat," said Healy. 
</P>
<P>
The thick, rather filling soup is served garnished with a merry swirl of red 
pepper puree for color and flavor fillip. The soup can actually double as a dip 
for vegetables; a sauce for roast poultry, game, pork or veal, or as a spread 
for crackers. 
</P>
<P>
Start scooping. 
</P>
<P>
ROASTED EGGPLANT AND RED BELL PEPPER SOUP 
</P>
<P>
3 large Japanese eggplants 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
Extra virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
2 sweet red peppers 
</P>
<P>
1 large onion, sliced 
</P>
<P>
4 cloves garlic, crushed 
</P>
<P>
1 quart chicken stock 
</P>
<P>
1 bunch fresh basil 
</P>
<P>
Wash eggplants and split lengthwise in halves. Lightly season with salt and 
pepper and sprinkle with olive oil to taste. 
</P>
<P>
Roast eggplants at 400 degrees 45 minutes or until tender and golden brown. 
Puree flesh with skin in blender or food processor. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Place peppers under broiler until skins are scorched on all sides. Place in 
plastic bag 10 minutes to soften, then peel and remove seeds. Puree flesh in 
food processor until smooth. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in skillet. Saute onion and garlic until tender. 
Cover to sweat over very low heat 5 minutes. Add roasted eggplant puree and 
chicken stock to onion-garlic mixture. Cook over low heat 15 minutes until 
flavors blend and mixture is heated through. Puree mixture in blender or food 
processor until smooth, then strain into clean bowl. Season to taste with salt 
and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
Cut basil leaves into tiny cubes, resembling confetti. 
</P>
<P>
To serve, place serving of soup in deep bowl. Spoon red pepper puree in center 
and swirl into soup. Drizzle lightly with olive oil, if desired. Sprinkle with 
basil. Makes 6 servings.

GOOD COOKING: KITCHEN SERVES AS GREAT PLACE FOR GET-TOGETHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The kitchen is the heart of the home -- and the best place to have a party. It 
is the one room in the house that provides just the right ambience for great 
conversation and joyful eating -- the very dynamics that make a party great. 
</P>
<P>
To my mind, the perfect party is a cocktail-hour buffet that starts in the 
kitchen and stays there until coffee and a simple sweet are served. 
</P>
<P>
It's informal and easy, and all it takes is some thought and minimal setup 
(ergo minimal cleanup). The party offers more substantial food than typical 
cocktail fare and can actually serve as supper for those who want to linger and 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
You may need to give your kitchen a candid look before you throw the party. 
Find a central focus and serving area in the kitchen and give it style; 
colorful flowers casually arranged in a pitcher, unusual multicolored scarves 
for counter covering, a cluster of tapers or votive candles (with the overhead 
lights lowered) and great bowls and platters for the food. Grace the platters 
and serving surface with carefully placed green leaves. Small dessert or butter 
plates (as well as forks) are required. 
</P>
<P>
TOMATO SALAD WITH RED ONION, BASIL AND GORGONZOLA 
</P>
<P>
8 large firm-ripe tomatoes (about 3 pounds total) 
</P>
<P>
4 ounces domestic gorgonzola, cut into 1/3-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
2 medium red onions (about 11 ounces total), cut into 1/4-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup julienned basil leaves 
</P>
<P>
4 teaspoons balsamic vinegar 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons light-tasting olive oil 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
Basil sprigs 
</P>
<P>
Cut tomatoes in halves, remove inner pulp and reserve for sauces or soups. Cut 
tomato shell into 1/2-inch dice. 
</P>
<P>
Combine tomatoes, gorgonzola, red onions, julienned basil, vinegar, olive oil, 
sugar, salt and pepper to taste in large bowl. Toss gently. Cover and chill 2 
to 6 hours. Gently toss again. Drain off excess liquid. Adjust seasonings 
before serving. Garnish with basil sprigs. Makes 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 A small amount of cornmeal gives this focaccia perfect texture for improv 
open-sandwich-making with thinly sliced salami and cheese; it also stands 
remarkably well on its own. The dough can be kneaded one day, rolled and baked 
the following day for total freshness; or focaccia can be frozen and reheated. 
</P>
<P>
HERBED FOCACCIA 
</P>
<P>
1 package dry yeast 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees) 
</P>
<P>
2 1/3 cups bread flour 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup cornmeal 
</P>
<P>
1 1/4 teaspoons salt 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup light-tasting olive oil 
</P>
<P>
2 large cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon dried rosemary 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon dried basil 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon dried oregano 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon Kosher salt 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon snipped chives 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon minced parsley 
</P>
<P>
Red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
Generously oil 2 large baking sheets (preferably black steel). 
</P>
<P>
Stir yeast and sugar into warm water. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Mix bread flour, cornmeal and salt in food processor fitted with metal blade 
(can also be kneaded with mixer dough hook or by hand). Turn on processor. 
Slowly pour yeast mixture through feed tube. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil. 
Process until dough cleans inside of work bowl but is still moist. (Add little 
more flour if dough sticks to sides of bowl. If dry, add little water.) Process 
until dough is uniformly kneaded, elastic and supple, about 40 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Transfer to large plastic food bag, squeeze out air and seal at top, allowing 
room for dough to expand. Let rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. 
Punch down. Use immediately or refrigerate overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Combine remaining 6 tablespoons oil, garlic and dried herbs. Warm on stove top 
or in microwave oven. 
</P>
<P>
Divide dough in half. Let rest 5 minutes. On floured board, roll each piece 
into about 12-inch round. Transfer to prepared baking sheets. Pierce surfaces 
with fork. Generously brush with oil mixture, including edges. Sprinkle with 
Kosher salt. 
</P>
<P>
Place in center rack of 450-degree oven. (Use 2 ovens otherwise bake focaccias 
in sequence, one after other.) Bake 2 minutes, then pierce any air pockets with 
fork. Continue baking 6 to 8 minutes, or until lightly browned around edges 
only. (Do not over bake.) Brush with any remaining olive oil, including edges. 
Sprinkle with fresh herbs and pepper flakes. Cut into wedges and serve hot. 
Makes 2 (12-inch) rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Focaccias can be baked in advance and frozen. Cool completely, freeze, 
then wrap airtight. Let thaw in wrapping. To reheat, place in cold oven and set 
at 300 degrees. Bake until hot, about 5 to 7 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
RICE SALAD WITH ARTICHOKES AND PROSCIUTTO 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups long-grain rice 
</P>
<P>
3 cups water 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 (6-ounce) jars marinated, quartered artichoke hearts, drained, cut in 
halves 
</P>
<P>
4 teaspoons white wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup minced parsley 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons minced basil leaves 
</P>
<P>
4 green onions, minced 
</P>
<P>
2 ounces prosciutto, cut into small dice 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
Parsley or basil sprigs for garnish 
</P>
<P>
Combine rice, water and salt in 1-quart saucepan. Bring to boil and simmer, 
covered, over medium heat until cooked but still firm to bite (al dente), about 
14 minutes. Transfer to colander. Rinse under cold water to remove excess 
starch (water will be clear). Drain well and transfer to mixing bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Add artichoke hearts, vinegar, mustard, olive oil, cheese, lemon juice, 
parsley, basil, green onions and prosciutto. Toss gently to combine. Season to 
taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made day ahead and refrigerated.) Serve 
chilled or at room temperature, adjusting seasonings before serving. Garnish 
with parsley sprigs. Makes 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of this salad depends on top-quality tomatoes. Domestic gorgonzola 
is firm-textured so it retains its dice after being tossed with the other 
ingredients.

DEMOCRATS: VETERAN LEGISLATOR RUBEN AYALA'S STYLE HAS WON HIM HIGH MARKS IN 
SACRAMENTO, WHERE HE HAS WON FUNDING FOR A VARIETY OF PROJECTS IN HIS DISTRICT.

<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. Ruben S. Ayala is best known around the Capitol for championing a 
lost cause: providing more water to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, the Chino Democrat has promoted major state water 
projects, such as the Peripheral Canal to pump high-quality Northern California 
water to the south. The canal plan was defeated by state voters in 1982, and 
Ayala has been thwarted from reviving it or winning approval of smaller-scale 
proposals by unyielding opposition from Northern California lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala's persistence in pushing such projects has drawn fire from 
environmentalists. Thomas Graff, senior counsel of the Environmental Defense 
Fund, described Ayala as someone who has "almost never met a water project he 
didn't like." 
</P>
<P>
But Graff also admitted a grudging admiration for the veteran lawmaker, who is 
facing a stiff reelection challenge from Assemblyman Charles Bader (R-Pomona). 
</P>
<P>
Graff said that even though he disagrees with Ayala about 75% of the time, he 
nonetheless holds a "soft spot" for the senator "because he's a 
straight-shooter." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Ayala's scrappy style wins him high marks in the Capitol. While many 
lawmakers increasingly hide behind aides when confronting tough issues, Ayala 
is known for his willingness to face his critics head-on. He also refuses to be 
taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
One veteran lobbyist said that in contrast to lawmakers who take their cues on 
issues from legislative leaders or special interest groups, "You have to go in 
and see (Ayala) and talk to him and explain the deal and how it affects his 
area." 
</P>
<P>
After 16 years in the upper chamber, Ayala is an entrenched member of the 
Senate establishment: chairman of the Agriculture and Water Resources 
Committee; an ally of Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti; a lawmaker who 
has clout to get public works projects built for his booming 34th District, 
which encompasses Pomona in Los Angeles County and most of western San 
Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
Besides water issues, Ayala is not known for his sponsorship of big-ticket 
legislation. Unlike many of his colleagues, he has kept his focus on his 
district, winning funds for a variety of pet projects -- libraries, community 
centers and parks. He flies home just about every weekend and, according to one 
former staffer, tries to keep in tune with the district by sifting through 
constituent mail. 
</P>
<P>
One of Ayala's few moments in the statewide limelight involved the highly 
charged 1979 battle over Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s appointment of actress Jane 
Fonda to the state Arts Council. Ayala, suggesting that the actress had 
provided "aid and comfort" to the North Vietnamese during the Vietnam War, made 
the motion to reject her appointment. It passed overwhelmingly. 
</P>
<P>
With less controversy, Ayala has been a longtime champion of the California 
Conservation Corps, carrying legislation in 1980 to extend the life of the 
agency initially set up to hire unemployed youth to protect the environment. 
</P>
<P>
His critics fault Ayala for failing to grasp details of legislation. One 
lobbyist, who asked not to be identified, said Ayala listens, asks questions 
and is reasonably attentive, but "doesn't quite get 100% of the picture" on 
many issues. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala, 68, dismisses such criticism as campaign rhetoric by those seeking to 
exploit the age gap between him and the 50-year-old Bader. 
</P>
<P>
One legislative staffer said that in committee -- where the nuts and bolts of 
lawmaking takes place -- Ayala is poorly prepared and may be handicapped by a 
loss of hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala acknowledged suffering a hearing problem in his right ear, which occurred 
while he was in the Marine Corps. But he maintained that even though he does 
not wear a hearing aid, he remains quite capable of hearing "what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
Politically, Ayala is considered a moderate-to-conservative Democrat. One 
former Senate staffer described Ayala as "not as liberal as most Democrats and 
not as conservative as most Republicans" in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
A review of five special-interest groups that rate legislators shows Ayala 
drawing high marks from traditional Democratic constituencies. For instance, 
the political arm of the California AFL-CIO reported that in 1989 he voted a 
pro-labor position 82% of the time. And the California Teachers Assn. gave him 
an "A" for his record on education issues. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala drew mixed reviews from more conservative groups. The California Chamber 
of Commerce said Ayala voted with their interests 41% of the time in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
But the National Rifle Assn. reported that he failed to side with the gun group 
on any issue. The NRA has endorsed Bader and has helped mount an independent 
campaign on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Ayala's stand on water issues, the League of Conservation Voters, the 
political arm of the environmental movement, said that he sided with them in 
the 1990 legislative session on 79% of their key floor votes.

<P>
Last May, a developer mowed down 30 oak trees along Oak Canyon Road. The City 
Council wants to make sure that it doesn't happen again. 
</P>
<P>
The council gave preliminary approval Monday to an ordinance requiring permits 
for removing or pruning most trees. The final vote will be Nov. 12. 
</P>
<P>
The new law would require a resident to get a permit from the city to remove a 
tree whose trunk is at least one foot in diameter in a front yard or side yard 
facing the street. In addition, the tree would have to be relocated or 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Even stricter rules would apply to oak and sycamore trees: Permits would be 
required to remove or prune trees whose trunks are at least six inches in 
diameter. 
</P>
<P>
The new law would stop developers from cutting down historic trees, said Tina 
Daniels, former president of the West Covina Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
If adopted, it would replace a citywide moratorium that has prohibited removal 
of oak, walnut, sycamore and pepper trees since the May incident. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Haley, West Covina's planning director, said the ordinance provides that 
violators can be fined up to $1,000 or sentenced to six months' imprisonment, 
or both. FRANKI V. RANSOM

<P>
Students at Santa Fe Middle School travel daily into a desert world where the 
temperature reaches 130 degrees and there are only sandstorms and an occasional 
camel to relieve boredom. 
</P>
<P>
In this alien place, the students are privy to the innermost fears and hopes of 
the people who may die in battle if the United States goes to war with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth- and seventh-graders aren't in Saudi Arabia, of course. But they have 
gained a glimpse at life in the desert by becoming pen pals with some of the 
more than 210,000 soldiers who have been shipped to the Middle East since Iraq 
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Social Studies teacher Jennifer Bryant, one of two Santa Fe teachers whose 
classes are corresponding with soldiers, says the letters offer a timely way to 
pique student interest in current events, history and geography. 
</P>
<P>
"They love it," said Bryant, who sends the letters in care of her 21-year-old 
brother Jonathan Edic, a Marine lance corporal who was dispatched to the 
Persian Gulf shortly after the invasion of Kuwait. "You can see their minds 
working. They hear things on the news, and they can understand what's going on 
there and feel a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Bryant passed around a sample "MRE" -- Meal, Ready to Eat -- 
that the soldiers are now chowing down. It consisted of ground beef with a 
spice sauce, a brownie, dried fruit and coffee with artificial creamer. 
</P>
<P>
"When they're in the sand, they eat this for breakfast, lunch and dinner," said 
Bryant, brandishing the prepackaged meal to a chorus of gagging noises. 
</P>
<P>
Then students from Bryant's class and that of Gail LaBau, whose students are 
also pen pals, began sharing their letters with rapt classmates. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve-year-old Ricci Rivera's letter came from Cpl. Jaem Jones, 20, who was 
born in Arcadia and moved to Oregon with his family when Jones was 8. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the corporal described the bleakness of desert life and ruminated on 
the flora and occasional fauna, as well as the variety of large insects: "At 
night, when we stay out in the desert, there are these huge beetles running all 
over the place. They are about half the size of your palm. When you are trying 
to sleep, they run across your face." 
</P>
<P>
Then the three-page, neatly handwritten letter took a more serious turn. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sitting over here feeling like targets, waiting for something to 
happen. I hope nothing happens except Saddam Hussein moves out of Kuwait. We 
haven't been shooting at people, or any of that stuff. War is not pleasant. War 
kills people, and I don't like killing people. But if it comes down to war, 
which I hope it never does, I will have to kill whether I want to or not." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, who began teaching this year after receiving her credential from UCLA, 
says her students have started tuning in the nightly TV news and pooling 
information about the latest twists in the Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
They have learned to distinguish among the countries and customs of Kuwait, 
Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Syria. They know that Islam is the primary 
religion of the Gulf, and that it encompasses a religious and cultural way of 
life that forbids women drivers, the eating of pork and bared legs, among other 
things. 
</P>
<P>
If the United States does go to war, the Santa Fe students could also learn a 
tragic story about loss. 
</P>
<P>
"This is causing them to think; if war does break out, they could lose their 
new friends," Bryant said. "We're going to have to deal with that as a class 
and it will be difficult on the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the letters wistfully describe the friends and families left behind and 
the career paths that brought the soldiers to the Middle East. A few have used 
the letters to debunk stereotypes about war and battle. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't carry a machine gun or one of those big 'Rambo' knives," Keith (Doc) 
Jackson, a Marine paramedic, wrote to 11-year-old Carlos Colon. "Instead of 
trying to hurt and kill others, I use the skills I've learned to save lives." 
</P>
<P>
The students, who are preparing care packages of cookies, magazines, pencils, 
sharpeners and photos for their pen pals, say they have new respect for the 
soldiers and a deeper understanding of that part of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"The Army is a pretty tough job; you have to take a real risk in life to be 
part of it," Carlos said. But despite the dangers, the sixth-grader said the 
letters haven't derailed his plans to go into the Air Force. "I want to take a 
big risk in my life too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant says she launched the Middle East project by asking students to find and 
summarize a newspaper story about the arms buildup in the Middle East. Then she 
assigned the letter writing and suggested the students ask their pen pals about 
life in the Gulf. Bryant, who made the writing project voluntary, said only two 
of her students chose not to participate, and they changed their minds once the 
first letters began arriving from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Mail takes about five days to reach the Gulf, but the class has found it takes 
up to 20 days for the Gulf letters to reach Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the time lag, Bryant says her class will continue corresponding with 
the soldiers until they return home. Some of them have promised to visit Santa 
Fe Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
"It serves as a real motivator," Bryant said of how the school project has 
helped her students learn. "It relates to their lives, and they have friends 
there now. We've even learned the Marines' motto, 'Semper Fi.' When they come 
visit us, the kids will know that when a Marine says Semper Fi, they have to 
respond, 'Ooh-ray.' "

SCRAPPY LAWMAKER CHALLENGED BY GOP MAVERICK; 
</P>
<P>
REPUBLICANS: ASSEMBLYMAN CHARLES BADER, WHO HAS CARVED OUT A NICHE ON EDUCATION 
POLICY, WANTS A SENATE SEAT SO THAT HE CAN HAVE A CHANCE TO SHINE.

<P>
During his first seven years in the state Assembly, Charles Bader says, he 
jogged about five miles a day, four days a week. 
</P>
<P>
But during the past year, the Pomona Republican has abandoned his regimen while 
running in the biggest race of his political career: challenging veteran state 
Sen. Ruben S. Ayala (D-Chino) in Tuesday's election. Colleagues say Bader 
jumped into the Senate contest partly because, in the Assembly, he felt as if 
he was merely running in place. 
</P>
<P>
Bader can point to few major legislative accomplishments, largely because many 
bills he sponsored, such as one to beef up penalties for drug dealers, 
ultimately failed to win passage. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of Bader's problem is a simple political fact of life -- in a 
chamber that has been controlled by Democrats throughout his eight years in 
office, the chances for a Republican to shine are few. And he has been further 
handicapped by being at odds with the Assembly's GOP leadership, which 
generally has been more conservative than him. 
</P>
<P>
Bader, 50, acknowledged feeling frustrated by the inability of Republicans "to 
get their names on a bill" that passes the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
So he had to settle for a behind-the-scenes role. He said he took his cue from 
a political axiom that goes: "You can accomplish anything you want in the 
Legislature as long as you don't worry about who gets credit for it." 
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, Bader, whose wife is a school principal, carved out a niche 
for himself as a Republican voice on education policy. He also established a 
reputation as an open-minded GOP backbencher -- someone Democrats could 
occasionally split off from his Republican brethren on a given issue, such as 
encouraging industry to cut toxic air emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Said one GOP Senate aide, who asked not to be named, "He's not at all a 
right-wing 'caveman' type. He's a reasonable, moderate Republican." 
</P>
<P>
The aide added that Bader probably would feel more at home in the less 
partisan, more collegial atmosphere of the upper house, even though it is also 
controlled by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Among his Assembly accomplishments, Bader cites his role on several education 
proposals, including a successful effort by GOP lawmakers last year to redirect 
$14 million from urban to suburban school districts. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Bader also noted, he participated in negotiations that led to a 
compromise, five-year plan to ease school overcrowding and build thousands of 
new classrooms throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
The key bill, sponsored by a Republican colleague, allowed school districts to 
levy a housing development fee of $1.50 per square foot. That measure, however, 
stirred confusion over which developments qualified for the fee. So Bader in 
1988 pushed through a bill that spelled out the type of projects eligible for 
the fee. It also blocked districts from raising the amount charged to 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
Bader said that prior to those bills, there was no state program to relieve 
school overcrowding -- a major issue in the 34th Senate District that he is 
seeking to represent. The district encompasses Pomona and western San 
Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
But his views on education have prompted criticism from the California Teachers 
Assn., which supports Ayala. Ed Foglia, the group's president, said Bader 
"talks a good line, but he really doesn't deliver" for the education community. 
Foglia said Bader consistently votes "against measures that would put more 
money into public education." 
</P>
<P>
Bader countered that his goal "is not just to provide more money, but to cut 
the dropout rate and improve test scores" for students. 
</P>
<P>
Symptomatic of the divergence in views between Bader and the CTA, the teachers' 
group last year handed the assemblyman a failing grade in its legislative 
report card. 
</P>
<P>
He receives much higher marks from the California Chamber of Commerce, which 
listed the lawmaker as having followed its recommendations 90% of the time 
during the 1990 legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
Another conservative lobbying group, the National Rifle Assn., reported that 
Bader sided with it on 100% of its measures. 
</P>
<P>
Bader scored much lower on an environmental score card. The League of 
Conservation Voters, the political arm of the environmental community, said he 
sided with them 35% of the time on floor votes in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Bader's rating with the political arm of the state AFL-CIO -- traditionally 
aligned with Democrats, also was low. The group said he took a pro-labor 
position only 18% of the time in 1989.

GROUP WILL TRY TO REVIVE COUNCIL DISTRICTS INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The backers of a Glendale initiative that was declared dead in July will ask a 
Superior Court judge this week to breathe new life into their effort to force 
City Council members to run for office from districts instead of citywide. 
</P>
<P>
The Coalition for Election Reform notified the city Friday that it will ask the 
court to order Glendale officials to either put the district elections 
initiative on the April 2 ballot or allow another 26 days to gather more 
signatures. The group's attorney said he will file the request Thursday with 
Judge John R. Zebrowski. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel an obligation to the public, which has supported our districting 
concept," said Richard Seeley, coalition treasurer, referring to the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
If the coalition's measure were to get on a ballot and win approval, it would 
divide the city into five districts. Voters in each would elect a single 
council member. Coalition leaders say this would bring political power to parts 
of the city they believe are now neglected. 
</P>
<P>
The five council members, two of whom could be forced to give up their seats by 
the measure, strongly oppose the districting plan. 
</P>
<P>
On July 6, Glendale officials ruled that the coalition did not gather enough 
valid signatures to qualify for the ballot. They also said the city could not 
legally give the group time to collect more. 
</P>
<P>
But in its legal brief, the coalition claims that city officials gave out 
incorrect information regarding the number of signatures needed and the 
deadline for turning in petitions. 
</P>
<P>
The brief alleges that former City Atty. Frank R. Manzano, current City Atty. 
Scott H. Howard and City Clerk Aileen Boyle told coalition leaders that the 
group needed to gather valid signatures from 10% of Glendale's registered 
voters. Boyle told them that their deadline was June 12, the document states. 
</P>
<P>
After the petitions were filed, however, city officials said they discovered 
that under a little-known 1988 law the coalition actually needed signatures 
from 15% of Glendale's voters. The 8,446 signatures gathered by the coalition 
fell nearly 2,000 short of that mark. 
</P>
<P>
The same obscure law would have allowed 200 days to gather signatures -- 26 
days beyond the deadline announced by the city clerk, the legal brief states. 
</P>
<P>
"It would run contrary to all notions of justice and fair play to allow the 
city to enforce the newly discovered 15% requirement and at the same time 
refuse to be bound by the equally newly discovered 200-day circulation time 
period," the document argues. 
</P>
<P>
Seeley said coalition leaders waited until recently to seek relief in court 
because they were busy researching legal issues and lobbying for a law that 
would rescind the 15% signature requirement. The bill was killed in the 
California Assembly on Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Coalition leaders have admitted that they received flawed advice from their 
previous lawyers, who also were unaware of the 1988 law. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica attorney Hermez Moreno said he took over the coalition's case at 
reduced fees because he believes it may lead to a suit against the state, 
seeking to overturn the 1988 law. He said legal disputes stemming from that law 
are only now beginning to surface in court. 
</P>
<P>
"This is unique," Moreno said of the Glendale initiative dispute. "I have not 
been able to find a case involving specifically this issue. But the same 
principles are involved in other cases." 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Howard has asserted that he and the city clerk were not legally 
obligated to help the backers of a petition drive. 
</P>
<P>
But Moreno contended that the coalition had a right to receive correct 
information on election rules from city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The minute you undertake a duty, you've got to do it in a non-negligent 
fashion," he said. "It seems to me the clerk and the city attorney are charged 
with the duty to assure business is done properly with the city. They've got a 
duty to dispense accurate information." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Monday, Howard denied that he personally provided incorrect 
information to the coalition. He said the city is prepared to defend its 
position in court, but he declined to provide details before a hearing.

SCHOOL RESTRUCTURING HAS WINNERS AND LOSERS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: MARSHALL HIGH CAN LINK STUDENTS' GRADES TO ATTENDANCE. BUT 
ALLESANDRO ELEMENTARY'S REQUEST TO REMAIN ON A YEAR-ROUND TRIMESTER PROGRAM IS 
DENIED.

<P>
A proposal by one northeast Los Angeles school for more autonomy was granted 
last week, while another school's proposal was rejected in the latest stage of 
a districtwide restructuring plan aimed at giving teachers and parents more 
control over their schools. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall High School was given the go-ahead by Los Angeles Unified School 
District officials to implement a new policy linking students' grades to their 
attendance, even though the policy violates district code. 
</P>
<P>
But Allesandro Elementary School was informed that neither of two requests it 
had made under the district's restructuring plan had been granted. 
</P>
<P>
Allesandro officials wanted to remain on the trimester year-round schedule they 
had begun in 1988, even though the Board of Education has decided to put all 
district schools on a semester year-round schedule. 
</P>
<P>
They also wanted to be allowed to save any unused district-supplied funds for 
materials from year to year, instead of returning the money, so they could buy 
equipment they otherwise could not afford. 
</P>
<P>
Notification to the schools was the latest stage in a districtwide 
restructuring plan known as "school-based management," designed to give parents 
and teachers more say in running their schools and, ultimately, to raise 
student achievement. 
</P>
<P>
School restructuring was set in motion in May, 1989, during contract 
negotiations with teachers. The Board of Education in August approved 
restructuring proposals by 27 schools, including Marshall, between Los Feliz 
and Silver Lake; and Allesandro, in Elysian Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Most schools immediately began using the greater freedom to act independently. 
But some proposed changes -- such as Marshall's attendance policy -- violated 
district policy, requiring Supt. William Anton to decide whether to waive the 
policy, said Andy Cazares, assistant superintendent of school-based management. 
</P>
<P>
Anton rejected Allesandro's request to continue its trimester year-round 
schedule because he believed it would conflict with the semester schedule 
adopted by the board, Cazares said. 
</P>
<P>
The second proposal, to carry over certain funds from year to year, was turned 
down because the district cannot afford to allow schools to hold on to money 
they do not spend, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to stay optimistic about this process," Allesandro Principal Lynn 
Andrews said. "We knew there was a risk of being one of the first schools 
applying for school-based management, because it was a brand-new ballgame. But 
we were willing to try to see what could be done." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Anton was ready to reject Marshall's request for a district 
waiver for its attendance policy, which would withhold credit if a student 
missed more than 20 days of class, Cazares said. 
</P>
<P>
The superintendent did not know the school would be providing students with 
tutoring and opportunities to make up the time and work, and thought the 
measure would be too punitive, Cazares said. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall officials protested by sending Anton a telegram and distributing a 
petition among teachers. A week later, Anton met with Marshall representatives 
to clarify the proposal. He then agreed to waive the district's policy that 
prohibits schools from linking attendance to grades, said Barbara Knight, a 
counselor at Marshall and one of the authors of its proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The school still is waiting for waivers from the State Board of Education for 
two proposals that violate state laws. The first would allow officials to 
shorten the school day so that teachers could have more time to plan and 
confer, Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
The other would give teachers, parents and students control of $200,000 
allocated by the state for school improvements, Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
State officials are expected to decide in December whether to grant waivers for 
the requests, Cazares said. 
</P>
<P>
Knight said far more significant changes are expected next year at Marshall, as 
administrators, teachers and parents draw up a second set of proposals for 
change. 
</P>
<P>
They hope to establish schools within the school by grouping 300 students with 
the same teachers and counselors for three years. They also hope to improve 
relations with Silver Lake and Los Feliz residents by keeping the campus 
lighted from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. and inviting groups to use the school as a 
community center, Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've done so far is kind of superficial stuff," she said. "When we 
really get into restructuring, changing the curriculum and the way the school 
is perceived, that will be the greater challenge. We're going to have to 
redefine what school means." 
</P>
<P>
Three other northeast-area schools -- Irving Junior High, Franklin High and 
Arroyo Seco Alternative Magnet -- are among a second wave of 23 schools that 
last week turned in their proposals for more autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
Those proposals will undergo the same process as the first batch, and the 
schools should be notified by the end of the year whether their proposals have 
been approved by the Board of Education, Cazares said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Irving, in Glassell Park, have proposed organizing the campus by 
grades. Franklin, like Marshall, wants to link attendance to grades and give 
control of some budgets to administrators, teachers and parents at the Highland 
Park school. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal by Arroyo Seco, also in Highland Park, made no significant 
requests for change because decision-making control already is shared among 
administrators, teachers and parents, said Brian Metzger, an English teacher 
who helped write the proposal.

JUDGE QUESTIONS CITY MOTIVES IN HOUSING LIMITS; 
</P>
<P>
RULING: A SUPERIOR COURT JURIST SAYS A GLENDALE MORATORIUM ON MULTIFAMILY UNITS 
APPEARS DESIGNED TO KEEP MINORITIES OUT. CITY OFFICIALS REACT ANGRILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A Superior Court judge said Tuesday that Glendale's moratorium on new 
apartments and condominiums is vulnerable to legal attack because it seems to 
be aimed at keeping ethnic groups and minorities from moving into the city. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Edward M. Ross criticized the city's planning tactics while upholding his 
Sept. 26 ruling on a related issue. On that date, he ordered Glendale to 
process three housing projects stalled by an earlier moratorium that was later 
invalidated by the courts. Glendale officials requested Tuesday's hearing to 
ask Ross to reverse his decision. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said a new document submitted by Glendale officials suggested that 
city leaders halted construction of apartments and condominiums "because we 
have too many ethnics and minorities coming into our city, and we want to 
restrict them." 
</P>
<P>
According to a transcript of the hearing, the judge said, "I think any time you 
file a declaration saying that, you make yourself very vulnerable to an 
attack." 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he was not ruling on the legality of Glendale's growth-control 
measures. He said his observations came from reading a written statement filed 
by Glendale to explain why the city should not process the three housing 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Ross referred to a document submitted by J. Laurence Mintier, a planning 
consultant whose firm was hired by Glendale in 1989 to study the city's 
population growth and its relation to new apartments and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the city of Glendale's new multifamily units are occupied by ethnic 
groups which historically have had larger families," Mintier said in his 
declaration. 
</P>
<P>
He also stated, "The ethnic groups occupying the newer multifamily units also 
have a cultural tendency to use city park facilities in greater proportions 
than the population citywide and areawide." 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's hearing, Ross told Assistant City Atty. Ron R. Braden that 
Mintier's declaration is "going to give you some real problems if your 
ordinance is ever attacked. . . . To the degree it shows the purpose is to put 
a damper on ethnic and minority populations because of their increased families 
moving in, I think your ordinance is very suspect." 
</P>
<P>
When Ross suggested that the city's strategy is unconstitutional, Braden 
replied, "We are not excluding, we are not targeting ethnics or minorities." 
</P>
<P>
"Sure you are," the judge responded. 
</P>
<P>
City officials reacted angrily Wednesday to Ross' observation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a highly inappropriate and inaccurate comment," City Manager David Ramsay 
said. "I would hope a judge would stick to the points of law and not make 
social commentary. In this case, it was very inaccurate social commentary." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Zarian added: "The judge has a real problem understanding the 
difference between a moratorium and racism. There's no correlation between the 
two. I don't understand his thinking. The judge is very confused." 
</P>
<P>
City Council members said they froze development of multifamily units Sept. 27, 
1988, because they were concerned that a construction boom was contributing to 
traffic congestion, school crowding and other problems. During the freeze, city 
officials have devised new planning rules aimed at reducing the number of new 
units that can be built and slowing the pace of construction. 
</P>
<P>
The state Court of Appeal declared Glendale's original moratorium invalid one 
year after its adoption because the city had not allowed five days to elapse 
between its introduction and adoption. Another moratorium was adopted 
immediately and remains in effect until the new building rules are approved. 
</P>
<P>
A committee of developers asked Ross in September to force the city to process 
three projects, together involving about 60 apartments and condominiums, that 
were turned away during the first moratorium. Ross said that because the freeze 
was illegal, the city must process the housing plans. 
</P>
<P>
He upheld that decision Tuesday after describing Glendale's motion for 
reconsideration as frivolous. 
</P>
<P>
Ross also said: "This court has serious doubts that the city of Glendale will, 
in fact, process the applications in good faith." 
</P>
<P>
The judge therefore said he would retain jurisdiction over the case "for 
purposes of ensuring compliance with the prior court order." 
</P>
<P>
Ramsay said Glendale will appeal the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The original ruling affects only three developers, who documented that their 
projects were ready for city processing when they were turned away by the 
illegal moratorium. City officials and local developers are uncertain how many 
other builders might try to seek permission to proceed with their stalled 
projects on the same grounds.

BUILDER PROPOSES NEW SLEEPY HOLLOW PLAN TO CUT DOWN GRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Developer Ken Doty, whose proposal to build 25 hillside houses was rejected by 
the Planning Commission and criticized by neighbors, has unveiled an 
alternative plan that he says will require less grading on sensitive 
ridgelines. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale City Council will review the alternative plan and Doty's original 
proposal for the 30-acre tract off Sleepy Hollow Place during a special meeting 
that begins at 7 p.m. today in council chambers at City Hall, 613 E. Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried to address as much as possible the major concerns," Doty said last 
Friday, when he announced the alternative plan. 
</P>
<P>
Doty said he prepared the second plan to give council members another option, 
but added that he has not withdrawn his original building proposal. He said his 
new plan eliminates a main cut in the hillside facing Glenoaks Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan also eliminates one view lot that was criticized by city planners 
because it required excessive grading. But by reconfiguring the tract, Doty 
said he has retained room for 25 lots. 
</P>
<P>
The developer said the only way to avoid hillside grading in Sleepy Hollow is 
to haul a large quantity of dirt into the canyon by truck -- an option that is 
opposed by homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Planning commissioners cited the ridgeline grading and the loss of oak trees in 
urging the council to deny Doty's original plan. Glenoaks Canyon residents have 
also charged that the tract would destroy scenic terrain, create traffic 
hazards and add to crowding at local schools. 
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible to completely meet all the demands," Doty said. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Krause, a Glendale city planner, said Doty's alternative plan is "not 
radically different" from the original proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Glenoaks Canyon Homeowners Assn., which opposes the Sleepy 
Hollow project, have refused Doty's invitation to discuss the alternative plan. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be inappropriate at this time for a few people to sit down behind 
closed doors and agree to anything without the entire association knowing it," 
said Dave Weaver, association president. 
</P>
<P>
He said the new proposal should undergo the same rigorous environmental review 
that the city ordered for Doty's original plan. 
</P>
<P>
Weaver said his association has been distributing flyers, hoping to produce a 
large turnout of hillside development foes at today's meeting.

FUNDS FOR CRIME VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 14-year-old crime victims assistance program for senior citizens will stay in 
operation, thanks to a $50,000 allocation voted by the City Directors on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Crime Resistance Involvement Council, operated in cooperation with the 
Psychological Center of the Graduate School of Psychology at Fuller Theological 
Seminary, had previously received $50,000 yearly from the city. After the 
program won a state grant in 1984, the city amount dropped to $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
Program officials sought restoration of the higher amount to continue aiding 
the more than 100 elderly Pasadena residents referred to the program annually 
because of burglaries, robbery or rape.

JUDGE RULES FOR SWAP MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials must allow businessman Paul Cho to open a proposed swap 
meet-style store in Northwest Pasadena, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge has 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
In his decision Tuesday on a lawsuit brought against the city by Cho, Judge 
David Yaffee ordered the city to inspect Cho's store at 625 N. Fair Oaks Ave. 
and issue a certificate of occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
Yaffee said the Pasadena Community Development Commission abused its discretion 
by refusing to consider deteriorated conditions at the shopping center when it 
and, later, the Board of Directors vetoed Cho's proposal for the Fair Oaks 
Department Store. 
</P>
<P>
The city said Cho's store would detract from redevelopment goals for the area 
and would increase traffic. But Yaffee said that conditions at the shopping 
center have already deteriorated to such an extent that major stores are 
reluctant to locate there.

BOARD UPGRADES COMPUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Directors voted Tuesday to upgrade their computer capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, some directors have struggled along with Hewlett-Packard personal 
computers models that are incompatible with much of the IBM software on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Others use IBM computers with small memory capacity. 
</P>
<P>
The board approved spending $19,770 for new computer terminals, printers and 
software, which will enable them, as Director Rick Cole put it, to "take full 
advantage of the power of personal computing in the 1990s."

125 PROTEST RENT INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 125 people packed every seat and stood in the back of the City Council 
chamber last week to protest rental increases of up to 50% at the El Monte 
Mobile Air trailer park. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Stanley Quintana suggested that the group select six representatives to 
meet with a newly formed rental review board to try to mediate the complaints 
about rents and a number of repair and maintenance issues. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, the council gave final approval to an ordinance prohibiting 
smoking in polling places and in public access areas of all buildings owned or 
leased by the city. The new law takes effect Nov. 24.

The City Council has rejected a proposal that would have provided $500 grants 
to residents for minor home repairs.

The council Monday voted 3 to 2 to deny a recommendation by the city's Human

CHILD-CARE ZONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The lack of logic on the part of the Glendale City Council has once again 
presented itself with the question of not allowing child-care facilities in 
residential areas. Given the current lack of adequate child-care resources, I 
am amazed that the council members could simply dismiss the possibility of 
taking advantage of this much needed community asset. 
</P>
<P>
Even more difficult to understand is the pride our city leaders have taken in 
the new electronic sign at Glendale College. Didn't anyone consider that the 
money spent on it could have been better used to subsidize the college's new 
child-care center -- a facility where no student can afford to take his child? 
</P>
<P>
Since the City Council and the administrators of Glendale College can't see 
where the real need lies, why can't Carnation and Glendale Federal realize that 
their monetary contributions would benefit the community more if they were put 
toward the early children education of Glendale's youngest citizens? I, for 
one, would feel much more inclined to patronize these businesses if I could 
witness their real commitment to our community.

BUILDING BELOW STANDARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some time ago, the Redevelopment Agency and the city fathers of Glendale 
approved the construction of the Carnation world headquarters building at 800 
N. Brand Blvd. The main structure is complete. From the outside wrapping, it 
all looks great -- an interesting office building, lots of trees, shrubs, 
fountains and walkways visible from Brand Boulevard and Monterey Road. 
</P>
<P>
But, drive past the corner, turn down Monterey Road and see the disaster that 
has been created. Adjacent to the monument to Carnation is its parking garage. 
There one can see a cheaply constructed, neon-lit blight. Forty-four 
homeowners, who previously enjoyed beautiful mountain views, now face open 
spaces filled with autos, auto fumes and rows and rows of neon lights -- even 
surging above the 45-foot building height guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
If one drives around Glendale, one notes the care and consideration given by 
other developers when building parking garages at 222 Monterey, the Glendale 
Federal Building at Monterey and Brand, the garages facing Goode Street between 
Brand and Central Avenue, 500 N. Brand and 550 N. Brand. What did Carnation 
offer Glendale to have a different set of standards laid down for it? Why is it 
able to create a blight on a residential street when no other developers have 
done this much damage to our commercial streets? 
</P>
<P>
This is a time when businesses and their leaders are being called upon to pay 
greater attention to the environment, to contribute their fair share to the 
quality of life in the communities in which they reside. Why are we not asking 
this of Lincoln Properties and the Carnation Co.? Were they excused from 
corporate responsibility for the next century? 
</P>
<P>
Our corporate "neighbors" have shown little sensitivity to the rights of 
others. They have shown no sensitivity to the standards of the community they 
chose and none to the environment the city fathers worked to create. This 
should not be recognized as acceptable behavior.

STUDENTS GET GLIMPSE OF LIFE IN THE DESERT; 
</P>
<P>
PEN PALS: TWO CLASSES ARE CORRESPONDING WITH U. S. SOLDIERS AND ARE HAVING 
THEIR INTEREST PIQUED IN CURRENT EVENTS, HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Students at Santa Fe Middle School in Monrovia travel daily into a desert world 
where the temperature reaches 130 degrees and there are only sandstorms and an 
occasional camel to relieve boredom. 
</P>
<P>
In this alien place, the students are privy to the innermost fears and hopes of 
the people who may die in battle if the United States goes to war with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth- and seventh-graders aren't in Saudi Arabia, of course. But they have 
gained a glimpse of life in the desert by becoming pen pals with some of the 
more than 210,000 soldiers who have been shipped to the Middle East since Iraq 
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Social studies teacher Jennifer Bryant, one of two Santa Fe teachers whose 
classes are corresponding with soldiers, says the letters offer a timely way to 
pique student interest in current events, history and geography. 
</P>
<P>
"They love it," said Bryant, who sends the letters in care of her 21-year-old 
brother Jonathan Edic, a Marine lance corporal who was dispatched to the 
Persian Gulf shortly after the invasion of Kuwait. "You can see their minds 
working. They hear things on the news, and they can understand what's going on 
there and feel a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Bryant passed around a sample "MRE" -- Meal, Ready to Eat -- 
that the soldiers are chowing down. It consisted of ground beef with a spice 
sauce, a brownie, dried fruit and coffee with artificial creamer. 
</P>
<P>
"When they're in the sand, they eat this for breakfast, lunch and dinner," said 
Bryant, brandishing the prepackaged meal to a chorus of gagging noises. 
</P>
<P>
Then students from Bryant's class and that of Gail LaBau, whose students are 
also pen pals, began sharing their letters with rapt classmates. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve-year-old Ricci Rivera's letter came from Cpl. Jaem Jones, 20, who was 
born in Arcadia and moved to Oregon with his family when he was 8. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the corporal described the bleakness of desert life and ruminated on 
the flora and occasional fauna, as well as the variety of large insects: "At 
night, when we stay out in the desert, there are these huge beetles running all 
over the place. They are about half the size of your palm. When you are trying 
to sleep, they run across your face." 
</P>
<P>
Then the three-page, neatly handwritten letter took a more serious turn. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sitting over here feeling like targets, waiting for something to 
happen. I hope nothing happens except Saddam Hussein moves out of Kuwait. We 
haven't been shooting at people, or any of that stuff. War is not pleasant. War 
kills people, and I don't like killing people. But if it comes down to war, 
which I hope it never does, I will have to kill whether I want to or not." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, who began teaching this year after receiving her credential from UCLA, 
says her students have started tuning in the nightly TV news and pooling 
information about the latest twists in the Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
They have learned to distinguish among the countries and customs of Kuwait, 
Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Syria. They know that Islam is the primary 
religion of the Gulf, and that it encompasses a religious and cultural way of 
life that forbids women drivers, the eating of pork, and bared legs, among 
other things. 
</P>
<P>
If the United States does go to war, the Santa Fe students could also learn a 
tragic story about loss. 
</P>
<P>
"This is causing them to think; if war does break out, they could lose their 
new friends," Bryant said. "We're going to have to deal with that as a class, 
and it will be difficult on the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the letters wistfully describe the friends and families left behind and 
the career paths that brought the soldiers to the Middle East. A few have used 
the letters to debunk stereotypes about war and battle. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't carry a machine gun or one of those big 'Rambo' knives," Keith (Doc) 
Jackson, a Marine paramedic, wrote to 11-year-old Carlos Colon. "Instead of 
trying to hurt and kill others, I use the skills I've learned to save lives." 
</P>
<P>
The students, who are preparing care packages of cookies, magazines, pencils, 
sharpeners and photos for their pen pals, say they have new respect for the 
soldiers and a deeper understanding of that part of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"The Army is a pretty tough job; you have to take a real risk in life to be 
part of it," Carlos said. But despite the dangers, the sixth-grader said the 
letters haven't derailed his plans to go into the Air Force. "I want to take a 
big risk in my life too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant says she launched the Middle East project by asking students to find and 
summarize a newspaper story about the arms buildup in the Middle East. Then she 
assigned the letter writing and suggested that the students ask their pen pals 
about life in the Gulf. Bryant, who made the writing project voluntary, said 
only two of her students chose not to participate, and they changed their minds 
once the first letters began arriving from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Mail takes about five days to reach the Gulf, but the class has found that it 
takes up to 20 days for the Gulf letters to reach Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the time lag, Bryant says her class will continue corresponding with 
the soldiers until they return home. Some of them have promised to visit Santa 
Fe Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
"It serves as a real motivator," Bryant said of how the project has helped her 
students learn. "It relates to their lives, and they have friends there now. 
We've even learned the Marines' motto, 'Semper Fi.' When they come visit us, 
the kids will know that when a Marine says 'Semper Fi,' they have to respond, 
'Ooh-ray.' "

AFFORDABLE HOUSING BEING LOST IN VENICE DESPITE 8-YEAR-OLD LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Low-income housing is disappearing in rapidly gentrifying Venice because the 
city is not enforcing a state law designed to protect affordable housing in the 
coastal zone, according to a study conducted by a UCLA graduate student. 
</P>
<P>
The law, the Mello Bill, was passed by the state Legislature in 1982 and 
requires that demolished or converted low- and moderate-income units be 
replaced, restricts demolition or conversion of residential units and sets 
affordable housing requirements for new construction. 
</P>
<P>
The study concluded that Los Angeles building, planning, zoning and housing 
departments at best have a spotty approach to implementing the vague law and at 
worst don't enforce it at all. 
</P>
<P>
Venice is one of the few coastal areas in the city of Los Angeles where 
affordable housing historically has been available. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the city officials contacted by The Times had not seen the study but 
generally did not quarrel with its basic conclusion: The city lacks any 
consistent policy for enforcing the Mello Bill, named for state Sen. Henry 
Mello (D-Watsonville). 
</P>
<P>
"No one is enforcing the spirit and intent of Mello," said Bob Sutton, a 
Planning Department official. 
</P>
<P>
The Venice Community Housing Corp., a nonprofit organization concerned with 
affordable housing, commissioned the study, conducted by Anne Murphy as a 
master's thesis in urban planning at UCLA. Its objective was to look into the 
city's efforts to enforce regulations that were designed to preserve and 
provide affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy did a case-by-case analysis of public records relating to construction 
and demolition since 1982 and interviewed city officials. 
</P>
<P>
She found that only nine affordable housing units were added since 1982 as a 
result of the Mello Bill. 
</P>
<P>
The study identified a minimum of 271 housing units demolished in the Venice 
coastal zone since the Mello Bill was passed, but was able to find only five 
units of affordable housing replaced as a result of the law. 
</P>
<P>
And of the 1,200 housing units built in the Venice coastal area within the past 
eight years, only four affordable units were built under requirements of the 
law, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
It is probable that the bulk of the demolished units were low- or 
moderate-income because it is those properties that are typically redeveloped, 
the study reported, citing a housing study done by the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
None of the nine new affordable housing units are for very-low-income families. 
Monthly rent on a very-low-income two-bedroom unit for a family of four in 
Venice is $440. On the same low-income unit the rent would be $516, and for 
moderate income it would be $902. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy's investigation of the city's implementation of the law uncovered 
confusion and finger pointing. 
</P>
<P>
"The Planning Department insisted that the Department of Building and Safety 
was primarily responsible for enforcing the Mello Bill. The Department of 
Building and Safety placed this responsibility on the Planning Department," 
said the study. 
</P>
<P>
"Both the Department of Building and Safety and the Planning Department said 
the Community Development Department was responsible for . . . monitoring all 
the low- and moderate-income housing. Not a single department has developed any 
procedures for tracking the enforcement of the Mello Bill provisions through 
the various stages of the permit process," the study concluded. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews with city officials, The Times also found similarly conflicting 
notions of when, why and by whom the law should be applied. 
</P>
<P>
"You may have found the essence of the story there," said Jim Bickhart, 
planning deputy for Venice-area Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bickhart, he experienced the confusion firsthand in the past few 
years, leading Galanter to recently push a measure through the City Council to 
enforce the law in Venice by linking it to an interim control ordinance 
designed to manage development. A brief moratorium on demolitions in the Venice 
coastal zone was also approved. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter said the study's findings coincided with her own perceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the city attorney's office said they have been studying the law's 
enforcement and will try to sort out who is responsible for it. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Board of Zoning Appeals recently sent a letter to the 
mayor, City Council and Planning Department saying it would grant exemptions 
from the low- and moderate-income housing requirements of the Mello Bill to all 
those seeking them. 
</P>
<P>
"The state law appears to require that the city adopt an ordinance to implement 
the Mello Bill. No such ordinance exists," wrote James D. Leewong, the 
then-head of the board in the Aug. 1, 1990, letter. 
</P>
<P>
The law that has spawned the confusion is actually a watered-down version of a 
previous law, in terms of enforcement, under which the California Coastal 
Commission was in charge of ensuring that affordable housing in the coastal 
zone be maintained. The previous law was based on the theory that the beach is 
an area that should be accessible to all citizens, Galanter said. 
</P>
<P>
The new law has been more difficult to enforce because local governments were 
supposed to set up their own mechanism to make it work, Galanter said. Los 
Angeles did not, nor did many other cities, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The study reported that, in practice, that meant that the Building and Safety 
Department issued demolition permits without considering the Mello law. 
</P>
<P>
In one case cited, a 16-unit apartment building, all affordable, was razed and 
a 50-unit apartment building replaced it. Though records showed the rents on 
the old units were $400, none of the new units were set aside for low- and 
moderate-income tenants. Murphy also noted that the Planning Department had 
said the apartments should be replaced according to the requirements of the 
Community Development Department, but because of poor interagency 
communication, the Community Development Department never knew about the 
project -- nor most of the others over which it had jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
Of the few cases that did make it to the department for review, the study 
reported, many were granted waivers from requirements, in some cases based on 
the word of the developer about rents in the area. It is the rents on the 
actual units to be demolished that count under the law. 
</P>
<P>
David Perel, housing and finance officer of the department, now called the Los 
Angeles City Housing, Preservation and Production Department, said current 
practice is to check actual rent. 
</P>
<P>
Perel criticized Murphy's study as being in some parts "overstated" and 
attributed it to her relationship with the Venice Community Housing Corp., 
which commissioned it. 
</P>
<P>
In the Planning Department, Murphy found a schizophrenic approach to Mello. The 
subdivision section was well aware of the law's requirements and did reviews 
for condominium conversions. But when it came to applying Mello, it usually 
granted waivers, concluding it was not economically feasible to ask the 
developer to include affordable housing. In other words, it would cut into a 
developer's profits. 
</P>
<P>
Across the hall in the same department, zoning administrators took the position 
that the law did not apply to new construction, Murphy found.

<P>
Deficit Reduction 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 228 to 200, the House approved the conference report on budget 
legislation (HR 5835) aimed at slowing deficit growth by about $490 billion 
over five years. Democrats voted 181 for and 74 against, and Republicans 47 for 
and 126 against. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters said the measure would improve but not cure America's deficit 
problem. For example, red ink this fiscal year is projected to top $200 billion 
even after the bill trims it by $40 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The revenue side of HR 5835 is estimated at about $189 billion. Upper-income 
taxpayers will supply most of the tax yield as a result of curbs on their 
deductions and personal exemptions. Most other Americans will be touched by 
higher taxes on gasoline, alcoholic beverages, cigarettes and airline tickets, 
an expansion of the wage base for Medicare payroll taxes and other revenue 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
A defense slowdown of about $185 billion over five years is the bill's major 
spending restraint. Medicare curbs are estimated at $44 billion, about $10 
billion of which will hit beneficiaries. Spending growth is curbed by $12 
billion for farm subsidies, $7.6 billion for civil servant retirement benefits 
and $3.7 billion for veterans benefits, among other restraints. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to join the bipartisan leadership and President Bush in support 
of the deficit-reduction bill.

CHIEF HONORED FOR FIGHT AGAINST HATE CRIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale Police Chief David Thompson's efforts to combat hate crimes in the 
city were recognized Tuesday by the Los Angeles County Commission on Human 
Relations. 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the commission, Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich 
presented Thompson the John Anson Ford Award honoring his department's work in 
investigating and arresting those responsible for hate crimes, said Celia 
Zager, commission spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The number of hate crimes in Glendale dropped during the first half of 1990, 
while there has been an increase countywide, Zager said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, eight hate crimes were reported and arrests were made in five of the 
cases, said Christopher Loop, the Glendale Police Department's hate crime 
investigator. 
</P>
<P>
This year, four incidents were reported and arrests have been made in two 
cases, Loop said. 
</P>
<P>
Loop said Thompson has instructed the department to give hate crimes the same 
high priority as homicide cases.

Malibu's struggle to become a city has spilled over into the California 
governor's race, with Democratic hopeful Dianne Feinstein saying that, if 
elected, she would support legislation calling for a speedy incorporation of 
the seaside community. 
</P>
<P>
"In my view, the will of the people -- as expressed quite clearly this past 
June -- should be carried out," Feinstein said, in a letter sent to Malibu's 
unofficial City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said she would be happy to sign legislation along the lines of a 
measure vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian in September. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Sen. Pete Wilson, the Republican candidate, immediately blasted 
Feinstein for making "an irresponsible promise." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman James Lee said that although the senator is "very sympathetic to 
Malibu's situation, he doesn't believe it is appropriate to give an iron-clad 
guarantee without at least being presented with both sides of an issue." 
</P>
<P>
"(Feinstein) is obviously willing to promise anything at this point if she 
thinks it will help her," Lee said. "I'm sure she'd promise to bring the troops 
home for Christmas if she thought it would help." 
</P>
<P>
Although 84% of Malibu voters approved cityhood in June, Los Angeles County 
officials have delayed incorporation until at least March in a bid to start 
work on a controversial sewer system before a new city government has the 
chance to block it. 
</P>
<P>
After losing a round in the courts to nullify the delay, cityhood backers 
turned to the state Legislature for help. In August, a measure by Sen. Ed Davis 
(R-Santa Clarita) that would have cleared the way for immediate incorporation 
swept both houses of the Legislature without a dissenting vote. Deukmejian, at 
the urging of county officials, vetoed it after the legislative session 
adjourned. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, county officials have hinted that if their efforts to start 
work on the sewer hit a snag, they may seek to delay the actual incorporation 
until the spring of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Enraged cityhood backers, many of whom oppose the sewer as a prelude to 
widespread development of the Malibu coast, have said they will return to the 
Legislature when it reconvenes in December. They hope to have a measure similar 
to the one Deukmejian vetoed ready for a new governor's signature in January. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the California League of Cities passed a resolution supporting 
Malibu's bid to speed incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, which has functioned as a government-in-waiting since the 
election, sent a letter to both candidates last week, along with a copy of the 
previous measure, asking for a pledge of support. 
</P>
<P>
Although Malibu's 8,800 registered voters are almost evenly split between 
Democrats and Republicans, all five members of the unofficial council are 
registered Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"Cityhood and growth issues have not been partisan matters, and I think all of 
us (on the council) prefer to keep it that way," Mayor-elect Walt Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
Keller said that while he is disappointed with Wilson's response, "deep down 
I'm not terribly concerned that if he were elected, and even if he were to veto 
our bill, that it would make much difference. We didn't lose a single vote (in 
the Legislature) the last time around, and that makes you feel comfortable 
about the chances of overriding any future veto." 
</P>
<P>
Other Malibu leaders were more critical. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it makes sense to say that you can't take a stand on something 
before an actual measure is in front of you," said Councilwoman Missy Zeitsoff, 
a Feinstein partisan. "We sent them both a copy of the (vetoed measure). Dianne 
Feinstein took the time to read it and take a position, and Pete Wilson 
apparently didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Local Republican boosters, several of whom urged Wilson to state his support 
for such legislation, tried to put the best face on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"He may lose a few votes here," said cityhood booster LaVonna Corzine, who is 
active in Republican circles, "but we're still for him."

PARK SERVICE STAYS NEUTRAL ON HOPE LAND SWAP; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATION: THE AGENCY IS EXPECTED TO TAKE A POSITION ON THE JORDAN RANCH 
EXCHANGE NEXT YEAR. BUT POLITICIAL DEVELOPMENTS MAY MAKE THE DECISION MOOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A long-awaited federal report released this week says that the proposed 
exchange of national parkland in Agoura for adjacent lands owned by entertainer 
Bob Hope would cause "direct unavoidable adverse . . . impacts" to the 59 acres 
of parkland, but preserve a much bigger swath of private land for public 
recreational use. 
</P>
<P>
The draft environmental impact statement by the National Park Service neither 
endorses nor opposes the land swap, which would provide road access to the 
sprawling housing and golf course project planned for Hope's Jordan Ranch 
property in eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Park Service officials, criticized in the past for supporting the exchange 
before performing environmental reviews, have been officially neutral in recent 
months. David Gackenbach, superintendent of the Santa Monica Mountains National 
Recreation Area, a unit of the Park Service, said Monday that the agency will 
take a position on the exchange in the final environmental statement, to be 
issued next year after a 90-day public comment period. 
</P>
<P>
But Gackenbach acknowledged that a federal decision could well be rendered moot 
by political developments in Ventura County, which has authority over the 
Jordan Ranch proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Three county supervisors and a supervisor-elect are on record against the plan 
for 750 homes and a championship golf course on Jordan Ranch, which Potomac 
Investment Associates has optioned from Hope. The project is expected to come 
before the supervisors for a vote sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
If they insist on a much smaller development, the developers may not need the 
access road and may withdraw their offer of the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing the worst from Ventura County, Hope has been trying to persuade the 
city of Simi Valley to annex the Jordan Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for a year and a half, the environmental report only focuses on 
the exchange of 59 acres of Park Service land in Cheeseboro Canyon for 864 
acres of Palo Comado Canyon, which is part of the 2,308-acre Jordan Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, as the document noted, Hope earlier this year significantly sweetened 
the offer in an attempt to win over critics of the Jordan Ranch proposal. 
</P>
<P>
As it now stands, Hope's offer includes the donation of another 325 acres on 
and near the Jordan Ranch to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state 
parks agency. He has also agreed to down-size the access road from four lanes 
to two and tunnel through some hillsides rather than flatten them. The access 
road would slice the edge off the 2,150-acre Cheeseboro Canyon unit of the 
national recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
Hope also agreed to transfer to the conservancy the 4,369-acre Runkle Ranch in 
the Santa Susana Mountains for a below-market $10 million, and to donate about 
170 acres of his Corral Canyon property in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
All of these inducements are contingent on approval of the land exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the exchange, including some environmentalists and Agoura-area 
homeowner groups, have criticized the Park Service for even considering 
altering park boundaries to accommodate private development. They argue that 
the Park Service would be triggering development of a property -- the Jordan 
Ranch -- that existing park service plans indicate should be acquired for 
public land. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the deal, including some environmentalists and the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy, say it would provide a windfall of public lands that 
could never be assembled with tax dollars because of exorbitant costs. 
</P>
<P>
Gackenbach said the Park Service will probably hold a public meeting on the 
report between now and Jan. 31, the deadline for submission of comments. 
</P>
<P>
The draft report said that if the land exchange takes place and the access road 
is built, the oak-dotted, 59-acre tract would no longer be available for public 
recreation. The road would be visible from some areas of the Cheeseboro Canyon 
preserve. 
</P>
<P>
The Park Service could insist on deed restrictions barring development of the 
59 acres beyond the two-lane road, but the property would still be degraded, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the document said, the deal offers "possible benefits" to 
the "Park Service and other public agencies," in that development of a much 
larger area would be foreclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The report analyzed several road access alternatives for the Jordan Ranch 
project should the Park Service kill the exchange. Each of the alternative 
roads would go through the city of Agoura Hills or unincorporated Oak Park, and 
face strong political resistance or difficult terrain, the report said.

FOES ATTACK COUNTY STUDY OF 3 CANYONS AS LANDFILL SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 200 homeowners, schoolchildren and politicians met at a scenic spot off 
Mulholland Drive on Tuesday to condemn a county report naming three Santa 
Monica Mountains canyons as potential landfill sites. 
</P>
<P>
With placards declaring "It Stinks" and other angry slogans, the landfill 
opponents cheered on elected officials who threatened legal and legislative 
action if the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts dump garbage in Mission, 
Rustic and Sullivan canyons. 
</P>
<P>
"I am absolutely appalled that anybody would think we need anything like a dump 
site here," state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) told the gathering 
near the Bel-Air Skycrest subdivision. "I am going to do everything I possibly 
can to prevent this from happening." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), through a spokeswoman, called on 
sanitation officials to cross the canyons off their landfill list and said 
their use would violate a federal law protecting land in national parks from 
being used for garbage dumps. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Sanitation Districts own Rustic and Sullivan canyons and Los 
Angeles County owns Mission Canyon, all three lie within the boundaries of the 
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, which just received $12 
million in federal funds for land acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
The Sanitation Districts have pledged that the three Westside canyons would be 
exempt from landfill development if the Santa Clarita Valley's Elsmere Canyon 
becomes a regional garbage dump. But protesters Tuesday said they were alarmed 
that a recent study still lists Mission, Rustic and Sullivan canyons as 
possible landfill sites. 
</P>
<P>
The three canyons are all just south of Mulholland Drive and west of the San 
Diego Freeway, in the hills above Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, accused the Sanitation Districts of "trying to splinter the forces 
against landfills" by making the Westside canyons' exemption contingent upon 
the development of a landfill in Elsmere Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Towsley Canyon, also in the Santa Clarita Valley, and Blind Canyon, in the 
Santa Susana Mountains above Chatsworth, are also named as possible landfill 
sites in the study. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial study, a draft environmental impact report on a countywide 
trash-management plan, has been the subject of continuing public hearings since 
its release Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Grace Chan, the Sanitation Districts planner who supervised the study, said 
public comments will be accepted until Dec. 3, after which the report will be 
completed and submitted to the Sanitation Districts' Board of Directors for 
final approval. The deadline for public response had been today, the reason for 
Tuesday's rally. Chan said the report also addresses recycling trash and 
hauling it to remote areas by train. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles), City Councilman Marvin Braude 
and David Gackenbach, superintendent of the national recreation area, were 
among the officials present. 
</P>
<P>
About 22 fifth-graders from the private Westland School, adjacent to Mission 
Canyon, attended to call attention to the potential health hazards of a 
landfill.

HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS CELEBRATE; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: BRUTALIZED BY THE NAZIS AS YOUNG GIRLS, THE 7 GROWN WOMEN RECENTLY 
PARTICIPATED IN AN IMPORTANT RITE OF JEWISH ADOLESCENCE, THE BAT MITZVAH 
CEREMONY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
At an age when many Jewish girls are preparing for their bat mitzvah, Gabriele 
Silten was stealing cabbage to survive in a Nazi concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Lurie was wasting away on a diet of raw potatoes and onions in a dark 
attic in Poland where her family was hiding. 
</P>
<P>
Trudy Hill was watching an SS guard drown a woman in a latrine. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, they and four other women in their 50s celebrated surviving the 
Holocaust by participating in the bat mitzvah ritual, which ordinarily marks a 
13-year-old girl's symbolic entry into the Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
"We missed out on so much when we were children," said Lurie, 53, of North 
Hollywood, whose mother and younger brother perished during the family's ordeal 
in the attic. "This is a chance for us to undo that a little." 
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony Saturday at Temple Adat Ari El in North Hollywood, the seven 
women chanted Hebrew prayers and made speeches in English with such feeling 
that many of the more than 600 people in the synagogue laughed and cried along 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
"Hitler must be turning over in his grave at this celebration of being alive in 
spite of being Jewish," said Hill, 56, of West Hollywood, who watched the 
drowning and other atrocities while a prisoner at the Auschwitz concentration 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
The women conceived the idea of participating in the ceremony during a 
convention of Holocaust survivors about two years ago, said Natalie Gold, 50, 
of West Hollywood. One night, nearly 50 pajama-clad men and women spontaneously 
gathered in her hotel room during the convention and held an impromptu slumber 
party. 
</P>
<P>
For Gold, whose mother disappeared forever after abandoning her in front of a 
Polish police station to save her life, the slumber party was a rare 
opportunity to be playfully childlike. Gold was brought up in a convent with 
strict rules until the end of the war, when her father reclaimed her. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to recapture our childhoods," she said, explaining why the women chose 
to participate in the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
For the past year and a half, with the support of psychologist Sarah Moscowitz 
and temple officials, the women met monthly to practice. Their closeness was 
evident in the many hugs they exchanged during Saturday's 1 1/2-hour ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Freda Gleitman of Beverly Hills was forced by the Nazis to work in ammunition 
factories and laundries when she was 12 years old. She never saw her family 
again because they were exterminated in a gas chamber. Saturday, she said the 
group of seven women was like a family to her. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like we're saying, 'Here we are. You Nazis did not succeed,' " she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Silten, 57, of Pomona, who stole from the Nazis to survive in the concentration 
camps of Westerbork and Theresienstadt, said the ceremony was "the start of a 
second life as a Jew, like coming back to my people." 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony also represented a renewal of faith for Hannah Kagan, 52, of West 
Hills and Gitta Ginsberg, 53, of North Hollywood. Kagan's family was forced 
into hiding, and she is still so haunted by the experience that she prefers not 
to talk much about it. But she said she feels she has come full circle. 
</P>
<P>
"I was brought up Orthodox, and these are not just words to me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ginsberg was thrown by Nazis into a dark basement where she spent endless, 
terrified days alone before being brought to a convent. Before the experience 
in the cellar, she had pretended to be Christian in order to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Gold said the women are hoping to relive other experiences they missed while 
growing up, either because the Holocaust was occurring or because they were so 
traumatized in the aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about having a senior prom," she said with a smile.

NEIGHBORHOODS: TUCKED AWAY IN A BACK ALLEY BEHIND SHOPS IN OLD PASADENA, AN 
AVANT-GARDE COFFEEHOUSE FEATURES JAZZ, POETRY AND HIP CONVERSATION.

<P>
It takes a persistent search to reach the red door with the small, handwritten 
sign: "Welcome to the Espresso Bar." 
</P>
<P>
The coffee bar, a cozy watering hole of eccentric charm, sits tucked away in a 
back alley behind a trendy gift shop in Old Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, the Espresso Bar has been dispensing some of the 
strongest coffee around and providing a haven for a varied assortment of 
characters to read, swap stories or just hang out. 
</P>
<P>
Its semi-secret location off Raymond Avenue is a sure sign of its cult status. 
Stepping inside is like entering a time warp. 
</P>
<P>
The "E-Bar," as the regulars call it, is about the size of a very large garage, 
and the resemblance doesn't end there. A beat-up old piano sags against a wall, 
trying to ward off collapse. Two shabby Chinese lanterns hang from the ceiling, 
providing subdued light. A broken jukebox stands to one side. Mismatched sets 
of chairs and tables fill the room in no particular pattern. 
</P>
<P>
The place looks like a throwback to the 1950s and early '60s, when coffeehouses 
reigned as gathering places of a new generation of nonconformists. 
</P>
<P>
"It reminds me of beatnik coffeehouses I used to go to in Chicago," said Jack 
Thibeau, a 43-year-old screenwriter-actor from Toluca Lake. He sat with some 
friends in the E-Bar one recent night after a weekly Zen meditation group 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I come to do writing here," he said. "It's really, genuinely avant-garde." 
</P>
<P>
The faithful preserver of the E-Bar's beatnik flavor is manager Gordon Beam. An 
accountant by day, Beam grew up in the '50s and says his own sensibilities are 
molded by the beat era. His coffeehouse credentials are impeccable, tracing 
back to travels throughout Europe and Northern Africa ("where the real coffee 
shops are") and time spent in Berkeley in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Since taking over the Espresso Bar two years ago, he has kept alive the 
tradition of his predecessor, Margaret Schermerhorn, who consciously created a 
refuge frozen in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not supposed to be anything that reminds you of anywhere else," said 
Beam, a ponytailed, bespectacled man of 52. "There (used to be) a clock which 
didn't move. I think it was set at 10 minutes to 11 or something. The basic 
thing was that there was nothing to remind you of present time." 
</P>
<P>
When it opened about 12 years ago, the E-Bar's atmosphere attracted an older, 
cultural crowd that came at night to relive its beatnik days. 
</P>
<P>
Now the clientele is younger. Many patrons are students from nearby city 
colleges and art schools. Others are teen-agers dropping in after meetings for 
recovering alcoholics to "get wired on double mochas," Beam said. All were born 
years after Kerouac and Ginsberg wandered permanently into the annals of 
American social history. 
</P>
<P>
"They're real young now," agreed Alicia, who offers nightly Tarot-card readings 
at one of the tables and prefers to be known only by her first name. 
</P>
<P>
On most nights, patrons pack the tables by 10 p.m. Often clad in black or in 
offbeat outfits, they sit and talk about subjects "from the ridiculous to the 
sublime," as one occasional drop-in put it. They sip their Cafe Royales -- 
potent caffeine concoctions consisting of double espresso, hot chocolate and 
whipped cream. They listen to loud music ranging from jazz albums to live punk 
bands. 
</P>
<P>
And they smoke many cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody comes here with drugs," said John Page, an engineering student from 
Covina wearing a T-shirt and blue jeans. "Here it's coffee and cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
Page, 23, has been going two or three nights a week for the past year. "It's a 
place to exchange ideas," he said. "People don't have too much attitude here." 
</P>
<P>
Sohrab Mahdavi, 28, a Pasadena computer technician, said he mostly goes there 
to ponder great academic truths, not socialize. A copy of "Anti-Oedipus: 
Capitalism and Schizophrenia" rested by his coffee cup, next to a gradually 
filling ashtray and a notebook with neatly written entries. 
</P>
<P>
"I like reading and writing in a coffee shop, being around people (and) 
smoking," he said, adding that the noise actually helps him concentrate. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday nights, Mahdavi has to share the E-Bar with the exhibitionists who 
get 15 minutes of glory apiece during "Espresso Yourself," an open forum where 
almost anything goes. The daring, the interesting and the just plain obnoxious 
use the time to premiere songs they've written or to shock the crowd in speech 
-- or dress. 
</P>
<P>
According to one employee, one man recently showed up to sing wearing nothing 
but plastic wrap and a discreetly placed license plate. "People are asking 
about him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesdays are set aside for open-mike Poetry Night -- a beatnik coffeehouse 
institution. The poetry runs the gamut from not bad to totally nonsensical, 
spiced with a generous supply of four-letter words. 
</P>
<P>
And for art lovers, the Espresso Bar routinely displays works of local artists. 
Some have caused controversy, including one show that seemed to blast 
Alcoholics Anonymous. Beam said he had to escort the artist out, afraid the man 
would be attacked. 
</P>
<P>
The permanent icon of the place is a painting of Frankenstein's monster that 
hangs over the storeroom door. E-Bar lore has it that there has always been a 
Frankenstein painting there throughout the coffee bar's history. 
</P>
<P>
"Margaret always felt that the Espresso Bar was a Frankenstein monster which 
she created," Beam explained. "When she sold (the bar), she took the painting 
with her. So the original artist painted this one and gave it to me, which I 
thought was really sweet."

<P>
REP. ANDERSON'S LONGEVITY BECOMES KEY ISSUE 
</P>

<P>
Has Rep. Glenn M. Anderson spent too many years in Congress? 
</P>
<P>
The question, being raised by some of Anderson's colleagues on Capitol Hill, is 
at the core of Republican Sanford W. Kahn's campaign to unseat the 11-term San 
Pedro Democrat in the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, 77, says he is in his political prime. He cites his rise two years 
ago to the chairmanship of the House's powerful Public Works and Transportation 
Committee and his steady success in steering federal port, road and rail 
projects to Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"There are only two ship channels I know of that were ever named after a member 
of Congress: One is the Sam Houston channel in Texas, and the other is the 
(Glenn M.) Anderson channel in Los Angeles," he said. "You can't knock that." 
</P>
<P>
But Kahn portrays Anderson as a once-vigorous lawmaker no longer up to his job. 
He also accuses the congressman of using his power improperly and of losing 
touch with his district on issues ranging from taxes to term limits. Anderson, 
he says, embodies the trouble with entrenched incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
"Anderson has grown stale," said Kahn, 46, a Southern California Gas Co. 
engineer from Long Beach. "Anybody after 22 years (in office) would grow stale. 
It's time for a change." 
</P>
<P>
Although Anderson draws praise from many of his Washington peers, some who work 
on his committee say advanced age and a 1988 quadruple bypass heart operation 
have taken their toll. All those who criticized Anderson declined to be quoted 
by name, with some expressing concern that they might endanger their projects 
pending before the public works committee. 
</P>
<P>
Said a Republican member of the panel: "I think this is a classic case of 
someone who has been in Congress too long." 
</P>
<P>
But committee member James A. Traficant Jr. (D-Ohio) disagreed: "I think 
(Anderson) has done a very good job. He gets things done without causing a 
confrontation. . . . He's dumb like a fox and he's forgetful like a fox." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson and Kahn are staging a rematch in the 32nd Congressional District, 
which includes San Pedro, Harbor City, Wilmington, Lakewood and parts of Long 
Beach and Downey. In 1988, the veteran congressman beat Kahn by a margin of 
more than 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Kahn may be hard-pressed to improve on that performance. Despite having run two 
years ago, he is still not well known in the district and has failed to raise 
the large amounts of money needed for an aggressive districtwide campaign. 
</P>
<P>
According to the latest federal election figures, Anderson has collected more 
than $350,000 since Jan. 1, 1989, and had $177,000 in cash on hand as of Sept. 
30, 1990. Kahn, by contrast, collected less than $6,000 in the same period and 
had only $240 on hand as of Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
In some respects, the issues in the 32nd District campaign mirror those in 
congressional races across the country. Kahn says that on two such issues -- 
tax policy and legislative term limits -- Anderson is "out of sync" with his 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Kahn opposes any type of tax increase to help ease the federal budget deficit, 
saying Congress should instead freeze spending at fiscal 1990 levels and cut 
big-ticket programs such as agricultural subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson supports a federal budget bill approved by Congress on Saturday that 
would boost taxes by $164 billion over the next five years as part of a 
$490-billion deficit-reduction program. Noting that wealthy taxpayers would be 
tapped for much of the new revenue, he says the package is fairer than a 
government spending freeze would be. 
</P>
<P>
On legislative term limits, Kahn advocates holding House members to five 
two-year terms. Anderson expresses "serious reservations" about limits, arguing 
that legislators become more effective the longer they serve. 
</P>
<P>
"After 10 years in office I knew more than when I was elected, and after 15 
years I knew more than after 10," he said. "Anybody who has been (in Congress) 
a few terms who doesn't tell you that they're better than when they got there, 
then they're lying to you." 
</P>
<P>
But the most intensely debated issue in the 32nd District campaign is whether 
Anderson's continued service in Congress is a plus or a minus to his 
constituents and the country. 
</P>
<P>
Kahn says Anderson has lost his effectiveness. He points to a recent 
Washingtonian magazine poll of Capitol Hill staff members that ranked Anderson 
as "worst committee chairman" in the House. He also cites grumblings by the 
committee members themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews with The Times, many lawmakers on the public works committee 
praised Anderson. But some on the panel -- Democrats among them -- said he is 
often unable to hold his own in policy discussions, is overly reliant on his 
staff and ineffective in advancing the committee's interests in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Some on the committee say these concerns could prompt House Democrats to take 
the unusual step of ousting Anderson from the chairman's post in December, when 
they hold their caucus. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone sees him as a nice person, but simply beyond his abilities in the job 
of chairman," said a Democrat on the committee. "The situation is not good for 
Glenn Anderson, it's not good for the committee and it's not good for the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Said a Republican member of the panel: "We love the guy but he's really failing 
mentally and it's very sad. Whatever his staff puts in front of him he does. I 
just hope that when I get to that point that I have sense enough to know it's 
time to retire." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson and his supporters attribute such talk to political rivalry, not 
friendly concern. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you can always find someone who thinks he can do better than me," 
Anderson said. ". . . I know I've done a pretty good job. And I think I know 
the problems better than anyone in the committee." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson says he is in excellent health. He points to a recent series of 
committee hearings he conducted in 11 states over the past three months to 
assess the country's transportation, water and sewage treatment needs. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledges referring in meetings to note cards prepared by his staff, but 
contends this does not mean he is overly scripted. 
</P>
<P>
"My job is to know what New York needs, what Pennsylvania needs, what 
Washington needs, what everybody needs. I have to know the answer on every 
highway in the country, every highway and every bridge," he said. "It's a 
pretty complex job. . . . I like to have everything at my fingertips." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the one who usually makes up the things that are on my note cards," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Kahn also charges that after years in Washington, Anderson has begun blurring 
the distinction between appropriate and inappropriate uses of power. 
</P>
<P>
He accuses Anderson of intervening improperly four years ago in the chartering 
of a national bank whose board chairwoman is Lee Anderson, the congressman's 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson acknowledged last month that he or an aide asked federal regulators 
about the status of a charter application filed by his wife and other 
organizers of the Rancho Dominguez Bank of Carson. 
</P>
<P>
But he has denied any impropriety, saying the query was the sort of routine 
service he provides for many constituents. 
</P>
<P>
"Any congressman's office must get calls to help on these kinds of things at 
least every week. . . . We service our people constantly," Anderson said on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson contends his continued service in Congress is helping both his 
legislative district and the country. He says he is putting his experience on 
the public works committee to use in assembling a nationwide program to upgrade 
roads, bridges and other infrastructure during the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
And Anderson says seniority is a main reason he has managed to line up 
congressional support for Los Angeles-area projects, including: the Century 
Freeway (officially named the Glenn M. Anderson Freeway by the state 
Legislature), the Metro Rail system and the plan to nearly double Terminal 
Island's port facilities by the year 2020. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't have done these kinds of things if I hadn't been in Congress a 
while," Anderson said.

Deficit Reduction 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 228 to 200, the House approved the conference report on budget 
legislation (HR 5835) aimed at slowing deficit growth by about $490 billion 
over five years. Democrats voted 181 for and 74 against, and Republicans 47 for 
and 126 against. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters said the measure would improve but not cure America's deficit 
problem. For example, red ink this fiscal year is projected to top $200 billion 
even after the bill trims it by $40 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The revenue side of HR 5835 is estimated at about $189 billion. Upper-income 
taxpayers will supply most of the tax yield as a result of curbs on their 
deductions and personal exemptions. Most other Americans will be touched by 
higher taxes on gasoline, alcoholic beverages, cigarettes and airline tickets, 
an expansion of the wage base for Medicare payroll taxes and other revenue 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
A defense slowdown of about $185 billion over five years is the bill's major 
spending restraint. Medicare curbs are estimated at $44 billion, about $10 
billion of which will hit beneficiaries. Spending growth is curbed by $12 
billion for farm subsidies, $7.6 billion for civil servant retirement benefits 
and $3.7 billion for veterans' benefits, among other restraints. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to join the bipartisan leadership and President Bush in support 
of the deficit-reduction bill.

ON THIS NIGHT, KINGS DON'T HAVE GHOST OF A CHANCE, 9-4; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: DEFENSE, BERTHIAUME FINALLY LET DOWN IN LOSS TO THE RANGERS. NEW YORK 
PUTS IT AWAY WITH FIVE GOALS IN THIRD PERIOD.

<P>
For the Kings, it was hauntingly familiar. 
</P>
<P>
They came to Madison Square Garden Wednesday night as the No. 2 team in the 
NHL, a position achieved largely because of a tough, new-look defense. 
</P>
<P>
But they lost to No. 1, the New York Rangers, 9-4, when that defense deserted 
them at the crucial moment, making the Kings look all too much like last 
season's club. 
</P>
<P>
That hasn't been the case very often this season. In eight of their previous 12 
games, the Kings had held the opposition to two or fewer goals. And they had 
won all eight. 
</P>
<P>
In falling to 9-3-1, still good enough to lead the Smythe Division, the Kings 
gave up more than a quarter of their previous goals-allowed total for the 
season, having previously surrendered 33. 
</P>
<P>
Even Daniel Berthiaume showed a few cracks in his previously impenetrable 
shield. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise of the new season for the Kings, Berthiaume had begun play 
unbeaten in five starts with a 2.2 goals-against average and a .932 save 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Scrub those numbers. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the shell-shocked Berthiaume gave way to Kelly Hrudey 2:16 into the 
third period, he had given up six goals on 30 shots, more than half his 
previous season total of 11. 
</P>
<P>
"It happens to every club in the league," Wayne Gretzky said. "We lost to 
Vancouver, 6-3, and we regrouped. We lost to Winnipeg, 6-2, and we regrouped. 
We'll regroup again." 
</P>
<P>
Something bad usually seems to happen to visiting teams in the final period at 
Madison Square Garden. Wednesday was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
For 40 minutes, these teams battled on nearly even terms, the Rangers holding 
on to a 4-3 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Three goals in a little more than three minutes, and the Kings weren't a factor 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Before the period had ended, the Rangers had outscored the Kings, 5-1, giving 
them a 19-2 edge over visiting teams in final periods. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Rangers are off to the best start on home ice in team history, 
having won their first eight. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, they are atop the Patrick Division with an 11-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
"Our teams knows that you go while the going is good," Ranger Coach Roger 
Neilson said. "Our experience from last year will keep us on an even keel. We 
went from first to last (in the division), but wound up first." 
</P>
<P>
That this game would wind up the way it did didn't seem too likely early on. 
</P>
<P>
The first period ended 2-2, the Rangers getting goals from Kevin Miller (his 
fourth) and Brian Mullen (his seventh and 500th career point). 
</P>
<P>
The Kings countered with Tony Granato (seventh goal) and Gretzky (team-leading 
ninth). 
</P>
<P>
But it was the Kings who were more aggressive, taking 19 shots to the Rangers' 
10. 
</P>
<P>
"The final score could have been 10-10," Neilson said. "They attacked us with 
four men all night. But it seemed like every time we had a scoring chance, we 
scored." 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers' second-period goals were accounted for by Paul Broten (second) and 
Ray Sheppard (third). 
</P>
<P>
Brad Jones kept the Kings close with his second goal. 
</P>
<P>
The last two times these teams met last season, the spotlight was on Bernie 
Nicholls, who came here in January in the trade for Granato and Tomas 
Sandstrom. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls, who began the night with 17 points, ended the same way, despite all 
the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, he spent the first half of the final period off the ice. 
</P>
<P>
He was still a key factor in the game, however, because with 47 seconds to play 
in the second period, Nicholls became involved in a dispute that ultimately 
also included Granato, Sandstrom and Rod Buskas of the Kings and Kris King of 
the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
"I came in and grabbed Tomas," Nicholls said. "Tony came over and hit me in the 
head. Then I cross-checked him in the head." 
</P>
<P>
When peace was finally restored, both Granato and Nicholls were assessed 
10-minute misconduct penalties. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand it," Gretzky said. "Those two guys are not heavyweights. I 
don't understand giving that kind of penalty to two guys as valuable to their 
clubs as they are." 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers never missed Nicholls, beginning their game-deciding blitz as the 
final period began. 
</P>
<P>
It went as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brian Leetch scored his fifth goal, putting the puck through Marty 
McSorley's legs and by Berthiaume's glove from 25 feet out at 1:12. 
</P>
<P>
 -- John Ogrodnick was given credit for his fifth goal, and his first of two on 
the night, when defenseman Steve Duchesne, clearing the puck out of his own 
crease, bounced it off fellow defenseman Tim Watters back into the net at 2:16. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Darren Turcotte scored his seventh goal. After Hrudey replaced Berthiaume, 
he blocked a shot, but the puck fell between his pads. Turcotte, on the spot, 
shoved it in at 3:07. 
</P>
<P>
It was that kind of a night. 
</P>
<P>
The kind of a night when the Rangers' got a short-handed goal, Jan Erixon 
scoring for the second time this season. 
</P>
<P>
The kind of a night when the Kings, who had scored at least one power-play goal 
in 11 of their previous 12 games, went zero for six in that department, while 
allowing the Rangers to score on three of four power plays. 
</P>
<P>
The kind of a night you wouldn't want to face the Rangers. Certainly not in the 
third period at the Garden.

PISTONS: AFTER AN INJURY-FILLED EXHIBITION SEASON, THE CHAMPIONS LOOK READY TO 
DEFEND THEIR TWO TITLES.

<P>
Sure, he knew he was re-upping for hard times but he thought he might get a 
little reprieve. Say, until the season started? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's how it works for the stars in Hollywood, where they have 
year-round tans and lunches with movie directors, but not here in Middle 
America for the coach of the twice-over NBA champion Detroit Pistons, Chuck 
Daly, also known as the Prince of Pessimism. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't have to be like this. Daly turned down NBC to chase his own 
three-peat (that word again, couldn't you just gag?) last accomplished when 
Boston's eight-year run ended in 1966, the days of the real dynasties. That's 
the siren's song Daly can blame, now that injury has wrecked his exhibition 
season and loosed the old specter -- Oh Lord, is this the year it goes wrong 
and they mutiny and throw me off the plane? 
</P>
<P>
He could have had the fat salary, short hours, limo to the studio, makeup 
people dabbing powder on his forehead -- the free suits! Instead, here he is, 
in the cold, empty Palace, hours before an exhibition game, trying to get his 
reserves ready since 60% of his first string is out. 
</P>
<P>
Isiah Thomas just got a finger in an eye and needed minor surgery. Bill 
Laimbeer's cheekbone was broken by Seattle's Olden Polynice, whose home is 
presumably buried under congratulatory telegrams from around the league. Dennis 
Rodman . . . oooh, there's the scary one. The Pistons were whispering that his 
ankle sprain might not heal all season. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what can happen to a good basketball team and it can change your life 
and change your season," Daly said, optimistic as ever. 
</P>
<P>
"The one I'm most concerned about is the one Rodman has. And he's vital to any 
success we're going to have." 
</P>
<P>
A sprained ankle? It's not long-term, is it? 
</P>
<P>
"It could be. It's a (Mikhail) Baryshnikov-type ballet tendon thing. He's been 
to see one of the doctors that looked at Baryshnikov. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, any time you got three-four starters out, you've gotta be concerned. 
You become a lottery team very quickly that way. Forget the coaching. Coaching 
doesn't have a thing to do with it if you don't have the players there." 
</P>
<P>
Five days later, Rodman played in an exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Hint: Don't look for them in any lottery. 
</P>
<P>
They suffer. They make you suffer more. They're the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
Two years they've ruled the NBA, three years in the finals, and they're still 
just an opponent for the Lakers, Boston Celtics or Michael Jordan. In last 
spring's NBA finals against the Portland Trail Blazers, while the Pistons 
proved they were, indeed, special -- or to use Isiah Thomas' word, great -- TV 
ratings dived to pre-1980s levels. 
</P>
<P>
Let's start by giving the Pistons their due. With a little luck, such as a 
healthy Isiah or no ticky-tack call against Laimbeer putting Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar on the line for the winning points in 1988's Game 6, they might 
already have three-peated. 
</P>
<P>
The defense, which the '70s New York Knicks popularized to considerably more 
fanfare, the Pistons have re-popularized or, in their case, made infamous. When 
Detroit let Rick Mahorn go in an expansion draft, the Philadelphia 76ers dealt 
for him and turned their own fortunes around. Soon no team may be complete 
without 250 big-bottomed pounds of longshoreman guarding the lane. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons have made dirty work almost glamorous. The Bad Boys days ended when 
Mahorn left, give or take the occasional Laimbeerian excess, but the Pistons 
still embody down and dirty values coaches love -- the marginally legal pushing 
and shoving, the acceptance of self-effacing supporting roles. Barring 
fractures, a Piston shows up for practice or hears about it, loudly. Here's 
Thomas, expressing his impatience with the lethargic William Bedford last 
summer: 
</P>
<P>
"Anything to do with William Bedford is a waste of time. . . . I'm not in his 
corner any more. Hey, not everybody deserves to wear 'Pistons' across his 
chest." 
</P>
<P>
Thus confronted, Bedford hied himself off to a psychiatrist who discovered an 
attention disorder and prescribed a drug. Bedford had a fine exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas plays vicious defense. Rodman and Joe Dumars draw top honors for it 
annually. Bigger men like Laimbeer and John Salley are poised to make a trip 
down the lane something a player will think about before trying again. 
</P>
<P>
All this gradually grew from a black hole, which is what the franchise was in 
1981, winning 21 games, playing before 5,500 a night, it claimed. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Pistons drafted the one, the only . . . 
</P>
<P>
Isiah. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the game's great stars, perhaps none but Wilt Chamberlain has had his 
stars crossed as has Thomas, but his impact is undeniable. 
</P>
<P>
"That he was voted MVP is insignificant," Laimbeer said last spring after 
Thomas was honored in the finals, "because MVP is based on a five-game series. 
He is our MVP. If you ask anyone on our team, or anyone who sees us, they'd all 
tell you. 
</P>
<P>
"This team is his personality. The determination and drive all revolve around 
him. The fact that Joe Dumars won the (NBA finals MVP in 1989) is great. We all 
felt happy for him, but I had a sinking feeling in my heart. It was sad for me 
because of all Isiah had done over the years. Now that he's won it, I feel so 
warm and happy for him." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas arrived, a superstar with a cherub's face and an engaging manner that 
belied his ascent from some mean streets. He had a prodigious appetite for 
community work and not just the kind where you lend your name. If anything, he 
had too much heart. Barely six feet himself, he lived to challenge 
seven-footers and swung on them at the drop of an elbow, too. 
</P>
<P>
He had a fondness, or weakness, for taking too much on himself, but his human 
qualities -- his bonds with the rich kid Laimbeer and with Dumars, the Piston 
closest to Adrian Dantley who blamed Isiah for his trade -- are the team's 
pillars. And Thomas does have juice upstairs; Daly thinks a word from Isiah to 
owner Bill Davidson may have once kept him from being fired. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, it seemed Thomas never got over the top. When he was young and 
outrageous, they said he lived to show off in the All-Star game. By 1987, when 
the Pistons were a power, Thomas fell off the All-NBA teams. Throw in the Larry 
Bird fiasco, when he gored the wrong sacred cow, and you have the elements of a 
great career gone askew. 
</P>
<P>
Even in triumph, discordant notes still sound. Within days of the second title 
and his MVP, Thomas' name surfaced in an FBI investigation. He was allegedly 
playing big-money dice games. He said the games were penny-ante, and the FBI 
acknowledged he wasn't the target of any probe. A few months later, Isiah 
pushed aside a cameraman he said wouldn't let him get into his car; the crew 
was from the TV station that aired the investigation story. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Thomas has become guarded in interviews, although cordial 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"Honesty has always been my problem," he said with his Cheshire-cat smile. "I 
say what I believe and I stick up for what I believe in." 
</P>
<P>
In the Piston press corps that likes him, he's sometimes known as "Sybil." 
</P>
<P>
If you like your personalities constant, try Daly's, forever mordant. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that he doesn't enjoy himself, it's just that the game and the life he 
loves entail so many perils, and he's felt them all. 
</P>
<P>
Before Detroit, his life consisted of getting to the right place at almost the 
right time. A high school coach at 32 in Punxsutawney, Pa., a town better known 
for its groundhog, he landed a job out of left field on the prestigious Duke 
staff by writing Vic Bubas a letter. 
</P>
<P>
He succeeded the legendary Bob Cousy at Boston College. He bore an outsider's 
stigma at Pennsylvania in Philadelphia's inbred Big 5. When he got his first 
NBA job, it was tendered by Cleveland's Ted Stepien, who pulled the plug on him 
in three months, all of which Daly spent in a Holiday Inn near the arena. 
</P>
<P>
All of a sudden, bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
Daly now has TV shows, a radio show, endorsements, a book and as much outside 
income as he can hustle. The Piston organization, which used to beat him up in 
negotiations, bumped him to $850,000, making him the game's highest-paid coach. 
The players asked him back, even the ones who had been baring their teeth 
during the season, when he was confiding that 1989-90 was his toughest season 
and hoping NBC would call. 
</P>
<P>
Life is great. Of course, if there's a cloud on the horizon, Daly is going to 
find it and pitch camp under it, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I do my share of suffering," he said. "There's a lot of sleepless nights and 
there's a lot of situations that occur internally with players that can make it 
very difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a new book out, 'Daly Life,' and I explain in the first chapter, I 
hadn't prepared myself to give up coaching. I thought during the season, 'It'll 
be easy enough to give it up.' But then when it came down to it -- we're in the 
parade and I'm looking across to Windsor (Canada) where we stay at the Hilton 
-- I'm saying, 'How can I let them go back over and me not be with them?' 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very good team. All the things that have been built up for seven 
years, I didn't want to walk away from. And I look at (NBC's schedule) and I 
say, 'I'm going to work three days until Jan. 24?' There's no way I could stay 
home and sit there with no place to go. I mean, I like the action." 
</P>
<P>
What this is, perhaps, is the Lakers-Pat Riley situation with a better bottom 
line, whereupon everyone falls into each other's arms and vows to stay 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Daly frowns. A high-profile coach leaving amid grumbling players is no happy 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
"Just from the outside," he said, "I'm sure there's tension on every team with 
its coach, OK? What you're trying to get is as many happy campers as possible 
and as many happy camp days as possible. But somebody's gotta drive the bus, 
and a lot of times, people don't like that. I also know the Lakers won 63 games 
and I thought Pat Riley did a sensational job of coaching. I did not like to 
face Pat Riley because they were extremely well coached and they were always 
prepared." 
</P>
<P>
To avoid a confrontation, Daly bends over backward to listen to his players, 
even if what they're complaining about may be near and dear to him. 
</P>
<P>
"They are brutally honest with each other," he said, "and it starts with Isiah. 
And they're brutally honest with the coaches. It's pretty ongoing -- buses, 
planes. It gets a little tough sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Examples? 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't even want to get into it," Daly said, laughing. "It had to do with 
me, obviously. What a lousy job I was doing." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Daly is now among the highest-profile NBA coaches. His seven 
years with his present team are the most in the league, by three years. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if he still has enough bend in him. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"There's a sports bar in New York called Runyon's," he said. "There's a sign on 
the wall that says: 
</P>
<P>
" 'How many were there? 
</P>
<P>
" 'Which way did they go? 
</P>
<P>
" 'How fast were they going? 
</P>
<P>
" 'I'm their leader. I better catch them.' 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a pretty good philosophy for an NBA coach." 
</P>
<P>
Daly doesn't think he's a pessimist, but "an optimist, who's been around." 
</P>
<P>
If you think the Pistons have been successful on the court, it pales alongside 
Piston marketing. 
</P>
<P>
The Palace, built for $80 million, on the drawing boards in the mid-'80s before 
the team was respectable, has 21,454 seats. None has been empty for a Piston 
game since it opened in 1988. With luxury box revenue, the Pistons claim the 
biggest gate in the league -- about $500,000. The mortgage was projected to be 
paid in seven seasons, but the Palace is supposed to be free and clear by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
A concession stand serves veal medallions. 
</P>
<P>
If it sounds like a suburban strategy, you bet your yuppies it is. "Detroit" 
appears on Piston uniforms, but the city is used chiefly as a site for victory 
parades. A Detroit minister calls it "plantation basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Housing prices being what they are, the players live like princes. Salley, 
who's single, has a 64-room mansion that once housed John Cardinal Dearden. 
</P>
<P>
Fame, it's . . . what? 
</P>
<P>
"It's not tough, but it's different," said Salley, the resident free spirit. 
"Before, you'd go to a movie and only a couple of people would go, 'That's 
him.' 'Nah.' 
</P>
<P>
"Now they come and ask for autographs during the movie. It's kinda rough." 
</P>
<P>
And all those endorsements, taking up time? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, that's no problem," Salley said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
How much of a longshot is the Piston quest for three consecutive championships? 
The Pistons note they've averaged 101 games for the past three seasons. The 
players say it felt like a short off-season. 
</P>
<P>
There are more problems in paradise than autograph hunters. Vinnie Johnson had 
an acrimonious holdout and was forced to come in at the club's price. Salley 
wants a new $2-million contract, but the club won't discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Pistons have the old Laker advantage: They dominate 
their conference. They can pull themselves together while the Lakers, the Trail 
Blazers and all those nascent powers in the West are beating each other up. 
</P>
<P>
Ask them, they'll tell you, they're great. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not like all buddy-buddy," Salley said. "We don't hang in the same 
clique all the time. But I think we've got a good team. 
</P>
<P>
"Isiah, he can hardly see outta one eye and he comes out and practices. Right 
now, he's supposed to be sitting there and resting, and he's on the Stairmaster 
for half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"People say, 'Bill Laimbeer doesn't have all the talent.' Yes, he does. He can 
shoot. He can rebound. Joe Dumars doesn't say a word and he just destroys 
people. James Edwards doesn't say anything. He goes out there and scores. 
Everyone knows their role and everyone does their role. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody respected us after we beat L.A. So we came back next year and L.A. 
didn't make it, did they? And we beat Portland honestly. I think it was our 
third championship. I think we were robbed of our first one. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, we've got a good team. We got the same team that was here the past two 
championships. We know what it's like. We know what it takes. We like playing 
in June. We like being the only two teams on television besides baseball." 
</P>
<P>
That's too far away to think about. There's a world of hurt to lay on everyone 
and each other before then. 
</P>
<P>
These guys will not be denied that, at least.

DOWNING TO TALK TO RADER BEFORE MAKING A DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brian Downing said Wednesday he will postpone filing for free agency until he 
speaks with Angel Manager Doug Rader, but added that if he hears "the same 
garbage" he heard from club executives, he will file before the Sunday 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Downing, who hit .273 in his club-record 13th season after playing sparingly 
until July, was told last week that the Angels won't go to arbitration with 
him. Although he called a return in 1991 "possible but remote," he wants to be 
sure all possibilities have been exhausted before severing ties to a team with 
which he has set nine career offensive records. 
</P>
<P>
Rader has been on a scouting trip in Latin America and is expected back at his 
Florida home this weekend. Downing plans to speak with him by phone Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Through my years of seeing guys disappear, I've heard the theme, 'If they'd 
just talked to (the manager), he wouldn't have had to leave,' " said Downing, 
who hit .371 (49 for 132) from June 24 to Aug. 17, when he peaked at .303. 
"Before I run off and sign somewhere else, I want to talk to Doug so he doesn't 
end up saying, 'He should have talked to me.' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looked upon by them as a last resort, and that's not right. It's their 
loss. Somebody's going to get a hell of a big league player. I know I've said I 
never could play for somebody else, but they dumped me. It hurts like heck. 
This is my home and always has been. I'm going to have to move away and leave 
my family behind. But I've always been a fighter. That's what's kept me in the 
big leagues 18 years." 
</P>
<P>
Downing, who earned $1.25 million last season, has been plagued by a muscle 
problem in his back the past three seasons and considered retirement when he 
was unable to find a remedy. But since beginning thrice-weekly treatment 
supervised by physical therapist Valerie Sinkus of Whittier, Downing said he is 
optimistic about regaining his form at 40. 
</P>
<P>
"I always knew this was a business, but you never think it's going to happen to 
you," Downing said. "I have no second thoughts about anything that's happened 
here. Hopefully I'll get a chance to win somewhere else."

STRAWBERRY WANTS A CANSECO-TYPE CONTRACT; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS: AGENT SAYS OUTFIELDER MIGHT NOT SEEK OTHER BIDS, AND IS WILLING TO 
SWITCH FROM RIGHT FIELD TO CENTER FIELD. VALENZUELA FILES FOR FREE AGENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Darryl Strawberry's agent has met with the Dodgers and said the outfielder 
would sign without seeking other bids if the Dodgers agree to pay him a Jose 
Canseco-type contract, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The agent also said Strawberry has told Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda that he 
wants to play here so much, he would move from right field to center field if 
necessary. That would enable the Dodgers to sign him without being forced to 
move Hubie Brooks or Kal Daniels, and could result in one of baseball's best 
hitting outfields. 
</P>
<P>
"Darryl and I both expressed a great deal of interest in him playing for the 
L.A. Dodgers," said Eric Goldschmidt, Strawberry's agent. 
</P>
<P>
Goldschmidt would not elaborate on Tuesday's meeting with Vice President Fred 
Claire and attorney Bob Walker. But he noted: "Darryl has told Tommy that he 
will play center field or right field. He told him he would do whatever the 
manager wanted him to do." 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Strawberry, who has averaged 31 home runs and 91 runs batted 
in, has publicly wavered on whether he wanted to join the Dodgers or return to 
the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Under free-agent guidelines, the Dodgers cannot begin talking contract terms 
with Strawberry until Monday. He will be seeking a deal similar to the 
five-year, $23.5-million contract signed by the Oakland A's Jose Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated move Wednesday, Fernando Valenzuela took what some feel is the 
first step toward ending his 10-year association with the team by filing for 
free agency. The Dodgers have no plans to make him an offer, and sources said 
Valenzuela has resigned himself to going elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing you always know about Fernando is, he gives you the fullest effort . 
. . but it's not a case of just looking at Fernando," Claire said. "It's a case 
of looking at the ballclub and asking, 'How do we improve to become a 
championship club?' As much as we like Fernando, we can't close the door to 
looking at change." 
</P>
<P>
Said Tony DeMarco, Valenzuela's agent: "You can arrive at your own 
conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela pitched a no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals on June 29 but 
was 1-3 with an 8.40 earned-run average in six September starts. He finished 
13-13 with a 4.59 ERA, the highest of his career. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers reportedly believe that Valenzuela would be no more than a fifth 
starter in next year's rotation, and that would not justify giving him a 
multiyear deal. 
</P>
<P>
But part of this thinking includes the bold notion that Orel Hershiser will be 
recovered from shoulder surgery and back in the rotation by opening day.

Stefan Edberg, Boris Becker and Ivan Lendl continued their battle for the No. 1 
ranking in the world Wednesday by winning their second-round matches at the 
$2-million Paris Indoor tournament. 
</P>
<P>
However, John McEnroe double-faulted at match point in the third set tiebreaker 
to lose to Jakob Hlasek, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) . 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe survived a point penalty in the second set and came from a break down 
in the third to force a tiebreaker. But his 10th double-fault knocked the 
seventh-seeded McEnroe out of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, the world's No. 1 player, opened the third day of the tournament and 
needed only an hour to beat Andrei Cherkasov of the Soviet Union, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Becker had an uncertain start before eliminating American Richey Reneberg, 4-6, 
6-3, 6-2 for the fourth tournament in a row. Lendl whipped Kevin Curren, 6-3, 
6-4, in a routine match with a service break in each game. 
</P>
<P>
Also, American Brad Gilbert avenged a loss to Amos Mansdorf of Israel in the 
1988 final with a 6-3, 7-6 (10-8) victory. French Open champion Andres Gomez, 
seeded fifth, lost to Sergi Bruguera of Spain 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
In the third round, Becker faces Jim Courier and Edberg meets Aaron Krickstein. 
Courier routed 16th-seeded Juan Aguilera of Spain, 6-1, 6-2, in 55 minutes and 
Krickstein disappointed the French crowd by knocking out Yannick Noah, 6-3, 
6-2.

FORMER BENGAL STANLEY WILSON ARRESTED ON ROBBERY WARRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stanley Wilson, banned from the NFL for using cocaine the night before the 1989 
Super Bowl game, was arrested Wednesday by Los Angeles Police Dept. detectives 
on a warrant for robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Roy Langheld of Harbor Division said Wilson was apprehended in Wilmington 
after officers stopped him in a car that had been identified by witnesses as 
one used during an Oct. 10 purse snatching. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who was a running back for Banning High, Oklahoma University and the 
Cincinnati Bengals, was arrested last January in Gardena for scuffling with 
officers and possessing drug paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, 28, struggled with drug problems during his NFL career. He missed the 
1985 and '87 seasons for violating the NFL's drug policy, and was treated at a 
Phoenix clinic in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's plight made national headlines after he was suspended from the '89 
Super Bowl in Miami, where the Bengals lost to the San Francisco 49ers, 20-16. 
In last January's Penthouse magazine, Wilson accused two teammates of joining 
him in a pre-Super Bowl drug party. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson could be arraigned as early as today in Superior Court in Long Beach, 
Langheld said.

<P>
Another season is upon us, posing its peculiar questions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is this the one when Michael Jordan, the greatest ever to lace 'em up, 
actually wins something? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is Paul Westhead, like the troops, trying to get home by Christmas? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Did that razor company tell Vlade Divac it was OK to grow his beard right 
back? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Maybe shaving it was what messed up Vlade's exhibition season? 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the local biggie: Where will Vlade's Laker Brothers finish? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: second to the Portland Trail Blazers in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Teagle and Sam Perkins have upgraded the roster, but sorry, Laker fans, 
this team's task is to get ready for the playoffs. Now there are too many 
uncertainties, starting with Divac and the adjustment to Coach Mike Dunleavy's 
new system. The Lakers shot 43% in exhibitions compared to last season's 49%, a 
consequence of the fumbling around. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, any team that starts Magic Johnson and James Worthy could finish 
first. On the other hand, given everyone else's presumed improvement and 
anything less than optimum development, it could finish third, too. 
</P>
<P>
Portland got Danny Ainge; Utah got Jeff Malone; San Antonio got Paul Pressey, 
and Phoenix got a year older. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, themselves, are concerned. The exhibition season ended with a 
30-point massacre by the Golden State Warriors and victories over the woeful 
New Jersey Nets in which the Lakers scored 103 and 94 points. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point in time, we have a lot of catching up to do," Laker General 
Manager Jerry West said. "Of course, veteran teams don't always gear it up in 
preseason. I've talked to a lot of people who love their teams and they haven't 
beaten anyone, and we've beaten people (the Lakers were 6-2). It's partly our 
expectations." 
</P>
<P>
Or as Johnson said of the uncertainty: "It's exciting." 
</P>
<P>
This season for the Lakers, the excitement arrives early. 
</P>
<P>
Add Michael: In Chicago, Bull Coach Phil Jackson said he'd like Jordan to shoot 
less. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people mentioned to me that you really can't expect to have a leading 
scorer in the league on a championship team," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Responded Jordan, obviously thrilled: "He's the coach, and I'll follow his 
scheme, but I don't plan to change my style of ball because I've been 
successful with it. I'm sure everything will be fine as long as we're winning. 
If we start losing, I'm going back to shooting again." 
</P>
<P>
Note: The 1970-71 Milwaukee Bucks with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar were the only NBA 
team with a scoring champion to win a title. 
</P>
<P>
Last add, unselfish: Jordan said the chances he will come out for the Olympics 
are "slim." 
</P>
<P>
NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
More predictions: Atlantic Division, Philadelphia; Central, Detroit; Midwest, 
San Antonio; rookie of the year, Gary Payton, Seattle; comeback player of the 
year, Byron Scott, Lakers or Kenny Smith, Houston. . . . Trouble? Utah won one 
exhibition and, because of its trip to Tokyo to play Phoenix, starts with 19 of 
25 days on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Harmony, it's great: The Boston Celtics' backcourt now has a pulse, with Brian 
Shaw and rookie Dee Brown. Coach Chris Ford wants to run again, but Larry Bird 
is skeptical, either out of experience or preference. Commented Kevin McHale, 
in another of the duo's long series of messages to each other through the 
media: "It takes five guys to run. If four guys run, the fifth guy is just a 
free safety out there. If everyone's not doing what's best for the team, we 
might as well pack it up and go home." Robert Parish, 37, asked if he can keep 
up: "To half court, yes." 
</P>
<P>
And you wonder why referees blow calls? Warrior players who didn't bellow as if 
fouled upon any contact were required by Coach Don Nelson to run laps. . . . 
Dallas prodigal Roy Tarpley says his goal is to make it through the season 
without "posing for any police pictures." . . . That's promotion: Miami and New 
Jersey sold 22,831 tickets in Syracuse's CarrierDome but came without former 
Orangemen Derrick Coleman (unsigned) and Rony Seikaly (home with a sprained 
ankle).

WEST COAST VERSION OF ROCKET IS CREATING FIREWORKS AT SAN JOSE; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: SPARTANS' SHELDON CANLEY LEADS THE NATION IN ALL-PURPOSE 
YARDAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Any discussion of the best all-purpose athlete in college football just about 
begins and ends with Raghib (Rocket) Ismail, Notre Dame's do-it-all junior 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
But to find the nation's leader in all-purpose yardage, one must know the way 
to San Jose, where tailback Sheldon Canley of San Jose State has 1,665 yards -- 
948 rushing, 258 receiving and 459 on kickoff returns. 
</P>
<P>
Canley, a 5-foot-8, 193-pound senior, possesses many of Ismail's attributes -- 
good hands, good vision, durability and a penchant for big plays, with nine 
touchdowns. But when it comes to national recognition, Canley isn't in the same 
galaxy as Ismail. 
</P>
<P>
Although he's a candidate for the first Doak Walker Award, recognizing the 
nation's top running back, Canley is not in contention for the Heisman Trophy. 
Ismail is. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans, who lead the Big West Conference and play host to Cal State 
Fullerton Saturday night, get ignored by the major networks, and aren't ranked 
in the Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish seem to make as many TV appearances as Johnny Carson -- seven during 
the regular season -- and are ranked second nationally. 
</P>
<P>
All of which has Canley feeling a bit overshadowed. 
</P>
<P>
"I know (Ismail) plays a tougher schedule than we do, but hey, I'm No. 1, so 
that's the bottom line," said Canley, a former Lompoc High and Hancock College 
star. "I feel I have the skills he has. I play hard and create things." 
</P>
<P>
A statistical comparison might not be valid. Ismail's primary position is 
receiver, so he doesn't handle the ball nearly as many times as Canley. Ismail 
returns punts, and Canley doesn't. However, Canley averages 208.1 all-purpose 
yards a game, Ismail 153.6. 
</P>
<P>
Is Canley as good as Ismail? No, according to Joel Buchsbaum, associate editor 
of Pro Football Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
"That's like comparing a Rolls-Royce to a Chevrolet," said Buchsbaum, who rates 
college players for the NFL draft. "Ismail has rare ability. Canley is a tough 
player. He'll get you where you want to go, just like a Chevrolet. But Rocket 
is a superstar." 
</P>
<P>
Buchsbaum, who has seen Canley several times on film, said he will be a middle- 
to low-round pick in next year's draft, nothing to be ashamed of. He said 
Canley has many talents but lacks explosive speed and isn't as elusive as some 
quicker backs. 
</P>
<P>
Other observers say Buchsbaum might be underestimating Canley's ability. 
Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy called Canley "the best running back on the West 
Coast," and that list includes Washington's Greg Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA recruited Canley in 1987, but he said they backed off when he didn't 
obtain his Associate of Arts degree from Hancock in time to enroll in the 
spring of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Canley graduated from Hancock in 1988 and went on to San Jose State, where he 
injured an ankle during summer drills and redshirted that season. 
</P>
<P>
What appeared to be two setbacks -- Canley said he "would have loved to have 
gone to UCLA," and he was slated to start for the Spartans in '88 until the 
injury -- might have enhanced his career. 
</P>
<P>
Had he gone to UCLA, a more prominent football school, Canley might not have 
been able to do all the things he does at San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
"By coming here, I'm able to get the ball in different areas and show my 
versatility, instead of just being a running back," Canley said. "UCLA doesn't 
throw that much to their running backs. I would have been limited there." 
</P>
<P>
Had Canley played in '88, a 4-8 season for the Spartans, he would have 
completed his eligibility last season, when San Jose State went 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the redshirt year, Canley is now part of an outstanding 1990 team 
that is four points away from an undefeated season. The Spartans (5-2-1) tied 
25th-ranked Louisville, 10-10, lost to seventh-ranked Washington, 20-17, and 
lost to California, 35-34. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I came here," Canley said. "And looking back at the redshirt year, it 
was probably a positive. I had another year to mature and to become more 
comfortable with the game." 
</P>
<P>
Canley, the nation's second-leading all-purpose runner behind Fullerton's Mike 
Pringle in 1989, is on course to break the NCAA record for per-game yardage. He 
has 4,598 all-purpose yards in 22 games, a 209.0 average. The record of 193.7 
yards is held by Howard Stevens of Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
If Canley breaks the record, perhaps he will get the national recognition he 
thinks he deserves, regardless of how he stacks up against Ismail.

ROSTER SHOULD KEEP THEM GUESSING

<P>
The Raiders have some important roster decisions to make before Sunday's key 
divisional game against Kansas City, but they seem willing to keep the Chiefs 
guessing until the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
Eligible to return from injured reserve are cornerback Garry Lewis (collarbone 
injury), tight end Mike Dyal (hamstring injury) and tackle Bruce Wilkerson 
(knee injury). 
</P>
<P>
Will they or won't they play? 
</P>
<P>
Only Raider Coach Art Shell knows for sure. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, the starting left cornerback, seems the surest bet to face the Chiefs. 
"There's a good chance he'll be on the roster," Shell said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkerson? "He's looking pretty good; he's feeling much better," Shell offered. 
"There's a chance he may be on the roster." 
</P>
<P>
Dyal? "We're not sure right now." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are also fairly sure that defensive end Mike Wise will return this 
week from an ankle sprain. CHRIS DUFRESNE

Quarterback Rusty Hilger, the former Raider who hasn't thrown a regular-season 
pass since 1988, was signed Wednesday by the Indianapolis Colts. Hilger fills a 
vacancy on the roster created when Jack Trudeau suffered a season-ending knee 
injury in Sunday's 27-7 loss to Miami. . . . Tampa Bay Buccaneer owner Hugh 
Culverhouse says Ray Perkins will return as coach in 1991 regardless of how 
many games the team wins the second half of this season.

ROBINSON: NO FINGER-POINTING AT 2-5

<P>
The team met Wednesday to regroup in the wake of its dip to 2-5 after Monday 
night's dismal 41-10 loss to the Steelers in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked fairly extensively about it," Coach John Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any withdrawal or recriminations, no finger-pointing. We talked 
about it. We have to be concerned that there isn't just a numbness about 
everything. It's almost as though you build a little cocoon around yourself to 
kind of ward off the pain. We've got to stand up and do something about it and 
not just absorb it." 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Jerry Gray said that since coming back from arthroscopic knee 
surgery a month ago, his play has been hampered by a nagging insecurity about 
the injury. Tuesday, he had an X-ray that showed no further serious damage, but 
Gray said the knee still isn't close to being 100%: "Out there Monday, I felt 
like I had no burst." TIM KAWAKAMI

TAKE MY CALIFORNIA BALLOT -- PLEASE! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MORT SAHL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES Mort Sahl, a political satirist, lives and 
performs in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Volumes have been written for and about California's upcoming elections. This 
is humorist and political satirist Mort Sahl's special take on the Golden 
State's democratic processes. 
</P>
<P>
In an era in which television journalists contend "government no longer works" 
and some citizens don't vote because they feel powerless, California sets a 
marvelous example by printing a 142-page book setting forth the ballot 
propositions in excruciating detail and distributing them to each new arrival. 
</P>
<P>
For the bewildered reader, this is my guide to this imposing journal: 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 124. This would allow hospitals to invest in health care 
organizations, just as doctors have done for years. This splits their 
portfolios, as well as their fees. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 125. This would tax car owners to build rail transit systems. The 
cars usually come from Japan and so do the rail cars. That way the money stays 
at home. Opponents call it socialized transit, kind of like the Blue Line. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 126. Having exhausted gas taxes, this proposition would go on to 
tax alcohol. The money will be used, let us hope, for schools, but probably for 
the Lottery. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 127. This one lets you write off earthquake shelters. I once built 
an air raid shelter, which seemed prudent at the time, alarmist later. And now 
I wonder if it's big enough. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 128. This is the one they call Big Green. Republicans are not as 
afraid of malathion as they are of Tom Hayden becoming environment czar. This 
comes as a relief. I thought he wanted Willie Brown's job. The proposition got 
its name from the color Hayden turns when he sees Brown in action. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 129. This gives Dianne Feinstein $740 million to go out and arrest 
drug dealers personally and build a prison to house them in someone else's 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 130: This forest acquisition plan proposes to save the redwoods and 
replace the donkey with the spotted owl as the symbol of the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 131: This would limit office-holders to no term. This is an ethics 
exam for office-holders. It's multiple-choice, but it's a beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 132: This would establish a marine protection zone three miles from 
our coast to pick up Standard Oil tanker captains and let President Bush drill 
every time the price of crude oil goes up. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 133: This one is called the Safe Streets Initiative. It would allow 
Los Angeles Police Chief Darryl Gates to run for mayor every time Mayor Bradley 
criticizes the LAPD. Gates would make a great mayor and this would keep him off 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 134. This would raise money from an alcohol surtax. It is fiscally 
sound because it makes drinking mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 138: The proposition also has to do with the forestry program. It 
requires Bob Hope to sell the Malibu Mountains to Donald Bren. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 139: This would utilize convict labor more efficiently. This 
develops character in malingerers. The prisoners would go condo, earn their way 
and pay taxes. And this would ensure no one would ever be a repeat offender. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is one initiative in which the voters contribute money toward 
the elections, just like the federal Election Law. This would make us all not 
only victims, but co-conspirators. They have finally rewritten the Founding 
Fathers -- "To dream of freedom we pledge our lives, our sacred honor, and up 
to $100." 
</P>
<P>
All of these propositions rely on taxation or the issuance of bonds, which are 
eventually worth less and less. In fact, this is not great news for Jerry 
Brown's sister, since the condition of California's finances will eliminate the 
need for a treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Sacramento, there is a local measure to combine Sacramento city and 
county. This would in effect quarantine the government so that it could, in the 
words of the Warner Bros.' pictures of the '30s, "leave decent people alone." 
</P>
<P>
And then there is the governor's race. There is Feinstein, who will do anything 
to defeat a Republican, including imitating one. For example, she says that 
Pete Wilson was absent from the Congress, which I'd think would weigh heavily 
in his favor. She even suggests that he usually votes under sedation, which 
would ensure the youth vote. 
</P>
<P>
As for Wilson himself, he became a senator by defeating Jerry Brown, who has 
been called the first American in space. Brown himself is trying to solve the 
re-entry problem. The governor's race is so close, it reminds one of Gene 
McCarthy's first congressional victory. He won by a sliver and went on to 
become very vocal in the House. One day, while campaigning in Minnesota, a 
farmer asked him why he made so many speeches. McCarthy said, "You elected me 
to represent you." And the farmer replied, "We didn't elect you that much." 
</P>
<P>
Why, you ask, doesn't California have a ballot like Minnesota had? There, the 
candidates' names were listed, along with a separate box for "None of the 
Above." We don't have it on the California ballot for the same reason that 
Minnesota doesn't have it any more: "None of the Above" kept winning.

LIFESTYLE: WHEN THE TIGHTKNIT KEARL CLAN OF LA CANADA TAKES OFF ON A FAMILY 
VACATION, THERE'S NO TIME TO RELAX. THE NEXT STOP: THE NEW YORK MARATHON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LIBMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
La Canada anesthesiologist Sherman Kearl, his wife, Karen, and their five 
children will set a vacation pace few could match while visiting New York this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
After three days filled with as many sightseeing outings as possible, the 
Kearls and their children, ages 17 to 27, will run the New York City Marathon 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But the breakneck pace will not be the Kearls' only vacation memory. They will 
be joined in the marathon by Karen Kearl's sister and brother-in-law, making 
them the largest single family entry in the marathon's 21-year history, said 
race director Fred Lebow. 
</P>
<P>
The Kearls undoubtedly will be sore after the 26.2-mile race, but they say a 
few aching muscles are a small price to pay for continuing their longtime 
tradition of building closeness on family vacations. 
</P>
<P>
"My father recognized that a lot of families that had successful children did 
so because they did things together," said Gregory Kearl, 27, a third-year 
student at Chicago Medical School. "Our credo has been to work hard and play 
hard together." 
</P>
<P>
"That is what life is all about," said Karen Kearl, 50. "The warm feeling you 
get when somebody cares when you spend time together." 
</P>
<P>
The vacations began when the children were young and the Kearls traveled with 
scores of families to Aspen, Colo., in the winter and to Lake Powell in 
southern Utah in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
As the children grew older, the family turned to more exotic pursuits. The 
Kearls took some or all of their children to Africa, Alaska, Australia, Europe 
and Hawaii. They have rafted on the Colorado River and kayaked from Catalina to 
San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Sherman, 53, and son Matthew, 21, drove a dune buggy to victory in the 
challenger class of the Baja California International 500-mile off-road race. 
The family has also walked the 175-mile stretch of the Pacific Crest Trail from 
the Mexican border to Palm Springs, and in 1987 all the Kearl children ran the 
Los Angeles Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
That marathon was the last time the family gathered in the same city, however, 
and Sherman and Karen wanted a reunion. 
</P>
<P>
The New York City Marathon came to mind. Sherman Kearl met Lebow when Kearl 
worked as commissioner of shooting events for two years prior to the 1984 
Olympics. He extracted Lebow's promise that if the family ran the New York 
Marathon together, the race executive would present them with the medals 
distributed to all finishers. In the past, Lebow has presented awards only to 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
The Kearls began training months ago, and on Wednesday night Sherman and Karen, 
an accountant, were scheduled to fly to New York. They were bringing their 
daughter Kristin, 17, a La Canada High School senior recently named Miss La 
Canada, and their son, Patrick, 19, a student at Glendale Community College. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory was scheduled to fly to New York from Chicago. Bradley, 26, a 
construction worker, and Matthew, a premed student at Brigham Young University, 
were to come from Provo, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Kearl said he treasures his memories of early family gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
"On weekends we would all get together and do all yardwork so we could finish 
it and then go out together," he said. "We'd try to do family activities once 
or twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
"Our church, the Mormon church, has a scheduled family night that usually takes 
place on Monday. It can be anything from ice skating to discussing gospel 
principles, but we always had a lot of fun together, and we've tried to build 
on that." 
</P>
<P>
Sherman Kearl explained the family unity this way: "I do not think we do things 
together because the church encourages it," he said. "The church's 
encouragement just makes it simpler. . . . We do things because we enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the children preferred to spend time with friends and were reluctant 
to attend family outings. Matthew said he didn't always want to go to Lake 
Powell but wound up enjoying the boating, water skiing and windsurfing. 
</P>
<P>
"It might have bothered me (to have to go with my family and leave my 
friends)," he said. "But when I was with my family it didn't bother me as much 
because . . . my family made it fun for us." 
</P>
<P>
Nor did the children and their parents avoid conflict at home. 
</P>
<P>
"All this family stuff doesn't mean that the kids don't bicker or complain or 
refuse to cooperate," Karen said. "We're not the Waltons. It's not 'Good night, 
John Boy.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Kearls have lived for 23 years in a 5,500-square-foot, Spanish-style home 
surrounded by 16 redwoods. A basketball court and a swimming pool with three- 
and one-meter diving boards sit beside the house. The Kearls do their own house 
and yardwork. 
</P>
<P>
"Their issues would be, 'I don't want to do housework, I don't want to clean 
the swimming pool,' " Karen said. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman Kearl's decision to spend time with his family began during medical 
school. The third-generation physician worked as a free-lance anesthesiologist, 
rather than affiliating with a hospital, for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"If you hook up with one hospital," he said, "You won't have much say in how 
much time you can take off. If my boy had a game or my daughter was in a play, 
I wanted to be able to go." 
</P>
<P>
Now that his children are grown, Kearl works regularly for Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center. Although he puts in as many as 100 hours a week, he 
recently found time to prepare his customary quiz on sites on the upcoming 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo to family members, he also listed sources where they could study for 
the 40-question exam. The family member who scores highest on the quiz earns 
$100; second place wins $50. 
</P>
<P>
"Preparing for a quiz such as this not only results in extra spending money," 
Kearl wrote in the memo, "but the brief study (for the quiz) results in ideas 
about what to see and do, as well as a better understanding and appreciation of 
the area. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
After seeing as many sights as possible before the race, the family hopes to 
see more during the event. 
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to stay together and run the race as slowly as the slowest 
one of us can go," Sherman said. "They are going through Harlem, the Orthodox 
Jewish section of Brooklyn and a lot of Jamaican and Puerto Rican 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"They will go past Yankee Stadium and the Verrazano-Narrows, the bridge with 
the largest main span in the world. . . . If there is something to stop at, 
we're going to look at it." 
</P>
<P>
But Sherman Kearl will not be surprised if the race doesn't go exactly as 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
Late on a recent afternoon as they drove to the Rose Bowl to work out for the 
marathon, Kristin told her father that she wanted to attend a Billy Idol 
concert that evening. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that one of those bad guys?" Sherman wondered. "Does he sing songs that you 
would be embarrassed to say? Kristin, you should think twice about this." 
</P>
<P>
After it became clear that Sherman would not persuade his daughter to stay 
home, he had another idea. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's what you do," he said. "You take a Sony Walkman. Put on some 
Tchaikovsky in your earphones and listen to that and your friends won't even 
know it."

immigrants -- have invaded his turf. 
</P>
<P>
Like Scouts on a treasure hunt, Justin Feffer, Michael Aldapa, Calvin Banks and 
Howard Hawkes -- USC students decked out in collegiate garb and backpacks -- 
explain they are on a mission: to explore the ethnic community they usually 
drive through with doors locked and windows closed. 
</P>
<P>
Across town, 23 other USC students also have ventured into different worlds: 
Chinatown, the Crenshaw, Fairfax and Mid-Wilshire districts, Boyle Heights and 
a strip of Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood -- areas associated with 
the Latino, Korean, Chinese, African-American, Jewish and gay communities. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1968, students enrolled in the Los Angeles Semester, a class requirement 
for public administration majors, have become "community detectives" and L.A.'s 
urban neighborhoods their laboratory for investigation. By concentrating on 
issues ranging from homelessness to hate crimes, from ethnic empowerment to 
entrenched racism, Robert John Pierson's students analyze urban problems and 
ponder solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Because the semester is a 16-unit multidisciplinary program, it is the only 
class for which students have time. Eight weeks into the class -- which will 
end in December -- the students have been on numerous tours of the city, coming 
face-to-face with a multilingual landscape of cultural diversity "suburbanites 
rarely see, much less experience," Pierson says. 
</P>
<P>
They have heard from angry community activists involved in AIDS awareness 
programs and others who help feed the hungry on Skid Row. They have listened to 
impassioned Latino muralists, and they plan to meet with city and county 
officials whose jobs, in both the private and public sector, some students 
would like one day to have. 
</P>
<P>
From the proposed redesign of the Los Angeles River as a natural recreational 
area to the fate of Olvera Street, by the time the class is over, the students 
will have discussed and dissected the city's past and its present in order to 
help plan its future. 
</P>
<P>
The program, one of the first of its kind in the country, was started three 
years after the Watts Riots. It is offered through the School of Public 
Administration and has inspired similar urban studies programs across the 
country "because of its experiential and experimental approach to learning 
about urban dynamics," says Pierson. 
</P>
<P>
He was a part-time instructor for almost three years before being named the Los 
Angeles Semester's director 18 months ago. Pierson has a master's degree in 
theology from Fuller Seminary in Pasadena and is finishing a doctorate in 
social ethics from the USC School of Religion. He shares teaching duties with 
Elpidio Rocha, a part-time USC instructor with a background in landscape 
architecture and community activism, and Youhansen Eid, who is working on a 
doctorate in urban and regional planning at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Weekly, students participate in field work "to learn about life in the inner 
city, to promote face-to-face encounters rather than being safe in a 
classroom," Pierson says. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to clocking as many as 24 hours a week interning at a public or 
private agency, the students, by themselves, also must arrange a minimum of 
four trips into urban neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids are going to help shape the future of Los Angeles, of cities across 
the country, and I don't want them to follow the elitist model," Pierson says. 
"It's hideous that some city planners have no idea or don't understand that 
ethnic communities have value. I want my students to immerse themselves in 
those places because before you can consider new policies in the operations of 
local government you have to get input from those communities. You have to 
understand the values of place that neighborhoods have for its residents." 
</P>
<P>
A case in point is the ethnic neighborhoods walk -- three to four hours of 
nonstop hustle where teams of students must interview five or more people about 
the community's history, lifestyles, businesses, quality of public services, 
religious institutions, landmarks and changes, if any, from deterioration to 
renovation. 
</P>
<P>
The assignment stresses lingering on street corners, eavesdropping on 
conversations, grabbing a snack at a popular bakery or lunch at a landmark 
cafe, befriending locals and, always, asking questions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm real concerned about neighborhood justice issues," Pierson says, 
explaining why the neighborhoods walks are crucial. "The most powerful tool in 
shaping the future in Los Angeles is zoning. It determines land use, density, 
where money will be invested and it also implies alternatives on how people can 
reshape their neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
Pierson also believes that "places tell stories and reveal narratives" about a 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"At 7th and Alvarado streets there is a sense of place even in the alleyways," 
he says, adding that the MacArthur Park area is where many residents share a 
laugh, where children play, where mothers talk and visit with friends. 
</P>
<P>
"But before the city initiates a knee-jerk policy of closing alleyways (due to 
drug dealing), they need to look at all the activities and all the functions 
the alleys serve," Pierson said. "Many Hispanic immigrants come from village 
cultures where social networking occurs in narrow alleyways, creating a sense 
of village." 
</P>
<P>
Pierson wants his students to "take the risk of confronting people and places 
and issues." 
</P>
<P>
For the foursome that emerges from the Saab, gathering clues about the assigned 
territory include a lively chat with Adam Bennion, a 41-year-old activist for 
the poor who believes, "the English-speaking born in Los Angeles are ignorant 
and arrogant about this neighborhood"; an encounter with two police officers 
new to the MacArthur Park beat, and meeting Hector, the 28-year-old Guatemalan 
who moved to California less than two years ago. Hector had worked at a Texaco 
gas station for a while but found he could make as much as $100 a day selling 
micas. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't tell you my full name, I'm afraid to tell you that. I don't want 
someone coming after me," Hector tells the group as they begin their work while 
standing in front of Langer's Restaurant and Delicatessen, a landmark 
neighborhood eatery. 
</P>
<P>
On the street, a symphony of noise is in full swing: people are crammed onto 
sidewalks, many leaning against graffiti-filled walls watching the traffic whiz 
by. Nearby, at a newsstand, three women share pages from La Opinion, a 
Spanish-language newspaper, and then head toward a drugstore, Botica del 
Pueblo. A cluster of men standing outside Joyeria del Pueblo, a jewelry shop, 
pass out cards for a palm reader. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you that there are drugs over here," Hector continues. "I can tell 
you that it's dangerous out here. During the day, during the night, any time." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkes, 22, who lives in South Pasadena and is interning with the Los Angeles 
County Transportation Commission, furiously takes notes while Feffer, 21, who 
lives in Beverly Hills, asks the questions. Meanwhile, Banks, a Mid-Wilshire 
District resident, and Aldapa, of East Los Angeles -- in charge of drawing the 
area's map -- break away in search of a barber shop or hair salon where people 
might be socializing. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm going to get into trouble talking to you," says Hector. "You see, 
the people with the businesses around here don't like us to express ourselves. 
They don't like us -- the immigrants -- in the streets or standing in front of 
their doors. The police don't like it either. So we just keep walking and when 
we're tired we lean against the buildings until the police or someone else 
tells us to go away, to keep on walking." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkes and Feffer move on. At Archies of Hollywood, a hair salon, they find 
their two classmates engaged in lively conversation at the back of the shop. 
</P>
<P>
Standing at a podium with an open Bible -- and surrounded by bottles of spray 
and perming solutions, Archie Herrera tells the students he welcomes anyone to 
prayer sessions in the salon "because we need the spiritual enrichment to save 
our community." 
</P>
<P>
Herrera, 71, has lived in the MacArthur Park area since 1940 "when it was a 
beautiful place, when you could sleep in the park. Nowadays I don't even want 
to walk through it during daylight. I don't want to get shot or stabbed or 
robbed." 
</P>
<P>
When asked by the students about the park's recent cleanup efforts and a new 
police substation on its grounds to deter drug deals and crime, Herrera and his 
barbershop friends say they are not yet convinced "it's safe to use the park." 
</P>
<P>
"People are still going around destroying our community. They kick benches, 
they spray graffiti all over the place, they urinate in the streets. They abuse 
property. I had a guy in here last week who scratched my mirrors with a knife. 
Senior citizens are robbed of their checks and women get their jewelry ripped 
off their necks," Herrera tells the students. 
</P>
<P>
Asks Aldapa: "Why has your community changed?" 
</P>
<P>
"Why? Because families are breaking up. Because there are too many people here 
and there are more poor people here than ever before. Because people are using 
their welfare money for drugs. Because people are rebelling against society. 
And because economically this area has gotten 100 times worse than when I first 
built my business here," Hererra says. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he and others in the salon tell the students they are optimistic about 
life in their inner-city enclave. "It's going to get better. We can't move 
because we can't afford to, so have to have confidence in the city and in the 
police that services for us will get better, that drugs and crime and 
prostitution, our biggest problems, will go away. That's what we pray for. 
</P>
<P>
"We love our neighborhood. For many of us, it is all we have."

SCHOOL SECURITY GUARD HELD ON KIDNAPING, RAPE CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A school security officer who was arrested and charged with kidnaping a woman 
and gang raping her pleaded not guilty and was suspended from his job with the 
Long Beach Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Lopez Jr., 27, was arrested along with three other men identified as 
gang members by sheriff's deputies early Friday morning. Deputies said they 
found Lopez holding a semiautomatic pistol to a woman's head in the back seat 
of a car, while another man sat in the front seat and two more waited outside. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco woman, who was in town visiting relatives, told authorities 
that she was abducted near the intersection of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard 
and Pacific Coast Highway in Long Beach while she was on her way to buy formula 
for her baby. Deputies assigned to patrol the Metro Rail Blue Line spotted the 
car, its license plate covered with tape and plastic bags, in the 1300 block of 
Lime Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez and the other suspects, Oniva David Tautolo, Owen Fuimaono Jr. and Lau 
Talo Jr., remained in jail Wednesday. Bail for each was raised to $150,000 
during arraignment Tuesday in Compton Municipal Court, Sheriff's Deputy Rich 
Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
Trial for the four suspects has been set for Nov. 13. They are charged with 
rape, kidnaping and oral copulation. In addition, Tautolo and Talo are charged 
with sodomy. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest has shocked Lopez's co-workers in the school district, where he has 
been a security guard for 2 1/2 years. "I just couldn't believe it," said Joe 
Romero, the district's chief of security. 
</P>
<P>
Before Lopez joined the school district, officials did a background check and 
found that he had no prior criminal record, Romero said. Lopez, who is single 
and lives with his mother in Burbank, had worked for another police agency 
before joining the district, according to Romero.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: SANTA FE SPRINGS; 
</P>
<P>
AGREEMENT MAY RESULT IN CLOSURE OF BESIEGED BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed agreement between the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control 
and the owner of a topless bar would shut down the operation forever. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the tentative agreement, the Cat Patch bar closed Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
The pact also stipulates that owner John Marsh has 180 days to sell his liquor 
license or lose it, according to documents the alcohol board sent to the city. 
Marsh cannot sell his license to a family member or someone involved in running 
the Cat Patch. Furthermore, the license could not be used to sell liquor at the 
site of the Cat Patch for a year. 
</P>
<P>
A liquor license, worth $17,000 to $20,000, is typically sold to an unrelated 
business in a different location, officials at the alcohol-control department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cat Patch was under siege by both the alcohol-control agency and the city 
of Santa Fe Springs, which has periodically sought to close the bar for the 
last 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 4, City Manager Don Powell stopped the topless dancing by suspending 
the bar's entertainment permit. He cited a variety of Health and Safety Code 
violations as well as alleged criminal activity on the part of patrons and 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Those same problems had prompted the alcohol board to consider revoking Marsh's 
liquor license. The proposed settlement still must be approved by the alcohol 
board leadership.

THE 1980 FILM CLASSIC 'RAGING BULL' WILL BE FEATURED SUNDAY AT THE OJAI 
PLAYHOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At two hours and eight minutes, the Academy Award-winning film "Raging Bull" 
lasts nearly two hours and one minute longer than last week's championship 
heavyweight boxing match. 
</P>
<P>
Not only that, the fight scenes in the movie are better. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980 hit starring Robert De Niro will be the Sunday attraction at the Ojai 
Playhouse, courtesy of the Ojai Film Society. "Raging Bull" is the story of 
real-life boxer Jake LaMotta, whose personal life was often more painful than 
his professional one. 
</P>
<P>
Last month the film was selected as one of the 1990 additions to the National 
Film Registry of the Library of Congress. Each year since 1988, 25 films that 
are considered culturally, historically or aesthetically significant have been 
chosen for the list. 
</P>
<P>
"Raging Bull" was also selected by many movie experts as one of the Top 10 
movies of the 1980s and was voted the No. 1 movie of the 1980s in an American 
Film magazine poll of 54 critics. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an American classic," said Film Society head Hal Janover, who called the 
movie's director, Martin Scorsese, "one of the best filmmakers we have." He 
also lauded the "great performances by De Niro and Joe Pesci." 
</P>
<P>
De Niro and editor Thelma Schoonmaker won Oscars for their work in "Raging 
Bull" and Scorsese and the movie itself were nominated for two others. 
</P>
<P>
The movie will begin at 4:30 p.m. The theater is at 145 E. Ojai Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura College's Community Services Department will be showing "Greatness of 
Spain" Nov. 8 as the second presentation in the Travel Film Series. The film 
will be shown in the Ventura College Theater at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $3 
general admission and $2.50 seniors for the early presentation, and $3.50 and 
$3 for the evening show. Ventura College is at 4667 Telegraph Road. 
</P>
<P>
If Spain is a little too exotic, maybe Catalina Island will do the trick. On 
Nov. 4 the Albinger Archeological Museum in Ventura will show the 20-minute 
video "Catalina: A Treasure from the Past," narrated by actor Peter Graves. 
</P>
<P>
The video offers a look at archeological finds made on the island, and quite a 
bit of information is provided on the island's history -- including customs and 
lifestyles of the Native American inhabitants before the arrival of the 
Spanish. Show time is 1 p.m. The museum is at 113 E. Main St. LEO SMITH

MOJO MAGIC; 
</P>
<P>
A CREW CALLED MOJO HAND MAY BE THE BEST -- AND ONLY -- BLUES BAND IN THOUSAND 
OAKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By BILL LOCEY

<TEXT>
<P>
Mojo Hand is the best blues band in Thousand Oaks. That may be like being the 
only ski shop in Tahiti or the best surfer in Kansas because Mojo Hand is 
probably the only blues band in Thousand Oaks, a town not noted as the center 
of the musical universe. 
</P>
<P>
The band will be playing at Thousand Oaks' version of The Roxy -- the Hungry 
Hunter. No, really, the Hungry Hunter, a family restaurant, is also about the 
only place for original music in the eastern portion of Ventura County. Mojo 
Hand, offering blues in the basement, has been playing there for years. The 
band will perform Wednesdays through Saturdays for the next three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The main Mojo man is guitarist Randy Rich. He's got that gruff blues voice that 
half the singers on MTV wish they had. The band may sing the blues, but its 
members could be an ad for social mobility. Rich graduated from Camarillo High 
School, but has lived in Florida, Montana and about everywhere in between. The 
other singer-guitarist, Becky Barksdale, is from Port Arthur, Tex. Drummer Pete 
Gallagher is from New York, and bassist Brad Vance is from Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent telephone interview, Rich discussed the life and times of Mojo 
Hand. 
</P>
<P>
Where did the name come from? 
</P>
<P>
I came up with the name several years ago. It's like a good luck charm. 
Originally, we were Mojo Hand; then I shortened it to just Mojo -- now we're 
back to Mojo Hand again. You hear the word mojo all the time in blues songs; 
it's like a sort of magic that helps you to get girls. 
</P>
<P>
How did you get started in the music biz? 
</P>
<P>
Well, when I was 12, I got my first guitar and started learning all the general 
rock 'n' roll stuff from the mid-'60s. Then I got into the blues and, during 
the '70s, I began performing acoustic Delta blues. In 1978, I started playing 
electric guitar again, and I was doing a lot of country. I moved around a lot: 
Montana, New Mexico, Florida. I finally ended up in Nashville and stayed there 
for 3 1/2 years. But for the last eight or nine years, it's been blues all the 
way for me. 
</P>
<P>
But why the blues? 
</P>
<P>
For me, I've always dug the blues. I've been a blues musician for a long time. 
I'm committed to it -- the band is working real hard. And, so far, I can get by 
without having a day job. The band used to be a three-piece with a different 
bass player; the current lineup has been together for three or four months. 
</P>
<P>
Describe the east county music scene. 
</P>
<P>
I think there's quite a few bands out here, but not a lot of places to play. 
Most places have Top 40 cover bands, if anything, and not much in the way of 
original music. We try to play every week, but it's hard because of the type of 
music we play. We end up playing the Valley or L. A. a lot. About the only 
place for us around here is the Hungry Hunter -- they've been very good to us. 
</P>
<P>
What sort of people go see Mojo Hand? 
</P>
<P>
We get a lot of people in their 20s and 30s. A lot of them are engineer types 
-- guys that just want a little less technology in their lives. They just want 
something basic. We're very basic; even our equipment is old. 
</P>
<P>
What is going to be happening with Mojo Hand in a year? Do you want half of 
Warrant's money and a video on MTV? 
</P>
<P>
Well, we're working on a tape; we've got about a dozen originals. The bass 
player has a recording studio -- one he actually makes money with -- and we're 
trying to line up some recording time. It's really hard to get the exposure we 
need as a blues band; that's why we started playing in L. A. more. Sometimes, 
it's really happening down there -- all those VIP places where the stars hang 
out seem to be opening up to the blues. 
</P>
<P>
What's the best thing about being a musician? 
</P>
<P>
Well, I'm actually doing what I want to do for money. Unfortunately, it's very 
little money. Blues is a very up and down thing, but it's something I love. 
</P>
<P>
How about those Rams? 
</P>
<P>
I wish I knew something about them.

SORRY, MOM;

<P>
DOC'N SANDY'S CAFE IS MIDWEST HOME KITCHEN CUISINE -- HEAVY, HEARTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Suddenly, last spring, I found myself on the receiving end of a bright pink, 
occasional newsletter called Doc'n Sandy's Saticoy Sentinel. The Sentinel 
turned out to be a promotional piece for a place off the Santa Paula Freeway 
called Doc'n Sandy's Cafe. As soon as I saw it, I knew that I was sure to 
disagree with the blurb in the upper left corner. 
</P>
<P>
"The food here is so good," it said, "you would think we had kidnaped your Mom 
and had her working in our kitchen." Mom, I hope you're not reading this. Doc 
may be working in a cafe-diner behind a gas station, but his cooking outshines 
yours. 
</P>
<P>
True, my Mom isn't from the Midwest, which is where Doc's cooking seems to come 
from. And I've got to admit that the cuisine here is similar to some of the 
food my Mom once cooked. But this seems superior to the stuff I was raised on. 
Sorry, Mom. 
</P>
<P>
I mean, this is a place with a real hot beef sandwich, open-faced, with mashed 
potatoes and gravy -- lots of each. Not a hot roast beef sandwich. Just plain 
beef. It's actually pot roast, a tender one, with that slightly stringy pot 
roast texture. The gravy's the kind you used to get at the truck stops that 
once dotted U.S. 66. The sandwich is, of course, served on doughy white bread. 
Some days there is a similar special -- a wonderful pot roast served with 
noodles. 
</P>
<P>
You can't go to a restaurant like this more than a couple of times without 
trying the chicken fried steak. Not if you have any sense. It comes in a gently 
fried, heavy, seasoned breading, with its own mass of mashed potatoes and 
gravy. Same gravy, same mashed potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
The fellow turning out this food back in the kitchen is Howard (Doc) Jarvis. 
Sandy is Sandy Jarvis, Doc's wife. "Seems like he's been cooking forever," the 
waitress said when I asked. She said Doc opened here 13 years ago. Now he does 
just about all of his own cooking -- even the baking. 
</P>
<P>
If Doc's food sounds a little heavy-handed, stay with me through the omelet. 
Doc knows how to handle his eggs. One day I dropped in for breakfast and, 
although I'm not necessarily an omelet lover, I tried his California version. 
It's at least three eggs, stuffed with chili, salsa, cheese, green peppers and 
onions. The flavors melt together, but the most savory thing in this model is 
that its edges are slightly crisp while the remainder is cooked softly enough 
to avoid that dreaded rubbery texture omelets so often have. Even better, it is 
served with crisp, cubed, heavily fried, almost but not quite burned potatoes 
on the side, as well as biscuits and gravy. This is an omelet that would be at 
the top of any omelet-lover's list. 
</P>
<P>
And Doc's restaurant would make anybody who cares about value truly happy. A 
person can eat well here for $6. If, that is, you don't order the apple pie, 
which tacks on another $1.85. It's money well-spent; the pie is high and heavy, 
perhaps just a tiny bit too sweet, crammed with firm apples and heavy sauce in 
a crust that shows its Midwestern origins. 
</P>
<P>
Eating at Doc's makes you realize that Middle America is alive and well. And 
some of it, at least, hangs out at Doc's in Saticoy -- even though the address 
actually says Ventura. 
</P>
<P>

MRS. OWEN'S NEIGHBORHOOD;

EACH HOUSE TELLS A TALE

The oil business was booming. The value of real estate was soaring. And Carl 
Simpson, who had inherited a chunk of farmland just north of Ventura Avenue, 
decided in 1925 to make the most of those circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
He sold off the land to businessman Joseph M. Argabrite, and in the next five 
years about 211 houses rose on the Simpson Tract, a ready-made neighborhood for 
the hundreds of blue-collar oil workers new to Ventura. The houses were built 
in Mediterranean Revival and California Bungalow styles -- six blocks of 
stucco, wooden window trim, arched entrances and tiled roofs. They reflected, a 
city analyst later wrote, "both the economy and the architecture of that era." 
</P>
<P>
Now, 65 years later, the oil tide has receded and the demographics have 
diversified. But 182 of those Simpson Tract homes remain, protected by a city 
ruling that they make up a historic district. Mabel Owen, who campaigned for 
that ruling last March, has seen her home on Simpson Street designated Ventura 
Historic Landmark No. 76. 
</P>
<P>
With the economy in flux and plans up in the air for a state university, the 
Simpson Tract's future is unclear. All around Mabel Owen's neighborhood, 
meanwhile, another generation takes its place.

Joyce Taylor, 55. Today, she says, "this is the cheapest rent you're going to 
find" and crime "is not that bad."

When my mother-in-law became ill, I realized why so many people fear getting 
old. Daily activities can be difficult for older people who are homebound or 
who live alone. Many senior citizens can no longer drive, public transportation 
is lacking and there are too few mobile services. All told, it isn't much to 
look forward to. 
</P>
<P>
But Ventura County is full of good people, especially volunteers, who make 
growing older a little easier. Here are some services that come to your home. 
Remember to ask businesses about seniors' discounts. 
</P>
<P>
Mobile pet grooming: 
</P>
<P>
A van will bring grooming services to your curb. Basic service includes 
clipping fur and nails, shampoo, cleaning the ears, eyes and foot pads. Flea 
dip is extra.

<P>
The Grooming Van in Simi Valley only accepts small dogs. The average cost for 
an animal that is well maintained is $20-$25. Seniors' discount is $2. (805) 
522-1369. 
</P>
<P>

Park and Westlake Village. Small and medium dogs only. Both minimum and average 
price is $25. No discounts. (805) 523-7147.

cats start at $12. Flea dip is $3 extra. Seniors receive a 10% discount on 
basic grooming services. (805) 496-3400. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation, Shopping and Errands: 
</P>
<P>
"Dial-a-Ride," a subsidized taxi service, is available to eligible seniors age 
62 and older as well as people of all ages with disabilities who are residents 
of Thousand Oaks. Cost for a "regular senior" is $1.50 per person each way 
during weekdays and $2 on weekends. It's half-fare for shared rides -- picked 
up and dropped off together. Low-income and disabled senior citizens may 
qualify for reduced rates. You must obtain a transportation card that is issued 
by the Thousand Oaks Public Works Department, City Hall West, 2150 W. Hillcrest 
Drive, on the second floor. But first call (805) 497-8611, Ext. 367 to 
determine which documents you will need to verify age or disability. For 
information on disability verification, call (805) 496-8655. The card costs 50 
cents for low-income seniors or handicapped and $1 for regular handicapped or 
seniors. Cardholders can call (805) 492-1544 to request taxi service. 
</P>
<P>

YOUNG POINSETTIA SCHOOL ADVENTURERS EXPLORE THE WILDERNESS IN A SPECIAL MESA 
PROGRAM.

<P>
Bearing knapsacks, canteens and a point-and-shoot camera, a dozen fifth-graders 
left civilization behind and plunged from the parking lot into the Matilija 
Environmental Science Area near Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
The special-education class from Poinsettia School in Ventura is designated 
language-handicapped, but when they reached the picturesque canyon for the 
daylong Nature Safari program, the adventurers had their questions ready. 
</P>
<P>
From an initial, "Are there scorpions here?" posed by Adolfo Barrera, the 
conversation tended toward the dramatic and the ominous. 
</P>
<P>
There was talk of rattlesnakes, which have a habit of emerging craftily from 
thickets, and concern was expressed over the poisonous properties of wild rose 
hips. When the class was challenged to name uses for the sharp-pointed yucca 
plant, the first suggestion was "blow darts!" 
</P>
<P>
Leader Tia Gatica assured the hikers that scorpions must be diligently searched 
out under the earth's surface. She offered them samples of nutritious rose 
hips, and assured them that all the rattlesnakes found in the area had been 
taken "to faraway places." 
</P>
<P>
Gatica, who directs the MESA program, knows her 11-year-olds. She warns them 
that the yucca's needles are "real gnarly," deters them from exploring a 
weed-choked bamboo tunnel with, "It's very thick and jungle-y in there," and 
proposes examining the trail for animal tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Leaping at the suggestion, the children hopefully ascribe each print to bears 
-- but for many yards the marks are analyzed as coyote, deer, fawn. Then, a 
bear track does appear. Wandering down the trail, it is pursued by eager 
explorers. 
</P>
<P>
"What if the bear is leading us to his den?" Tom Wisenbaker asked. A more 
practical classmate suggested that the bear was only searching for water in the 
sandy environment. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever his purpose, the bear managed to stay out of reach of the class, which 
settled instead for sighting lizards. Then they backed under a fallen "wishing 
tree" Chumash-style, tasted wild cherries, and ceremoniously cracked walnuts on 
Chumash Rock -- an ancient food preparation stone large enough for the entire 
class to rest atop. 
</P>
<P>
Gatica pointed out a nearby stone stairway -- left by 19th-Century pioneers -- 
and explained that the stairs and the Chumash grinding stone are legacies left 
by previous cultures. She asked, "What will the people of the 1990s leave 
behind?" 
</P>
<P>
"It might be all trash," said ecologically conscious Joe Oberhausen. 
</P>
<P>
This was not the lesson that MESA wanted to emphasize, Gatica said later, 
seated near a newly dug organic garden. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a philosophy about the environment that people are working together to 
solve problems. Instead of focusing on the gloom of landfills, we stress that 
when we recycle aluminum and glass we are helping to solve this problem," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
All children who visit MESA are asked to deposit recyclables, and are left to 
ponder the wisdom of using containers that can't be reused. 
</P>
<P>
They may also enroll in a session on conservation skills called Ecosystems, 
Environmental Issues and Solutions. Like the Nature Safari program, it combines 
exploring, group endeavor, crafts and history to impart its lessons. 
</P>
<P>
Other one- or two-day programs available to children's groups include Settlers, 
Pioneers and Miners, which offers a chance to discover relics and pan for 
minerals; Native American Culture, which explores Chumash crafts, dance and 
games; and Survival Skills, with practice in finding edible plants and learning 
directional skills. 
</P>
<P>
The setting for all this is more than 500 acres in spectacular Matilija Canyon, 
a harsh environment where winter rains can transform the now-absent creek into 
a deluge from the towering Santa Inez Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
There is a sparkling lake -- off limits to boats or bathers; in most seasons a 
brook; and a rare combination of oak grove, meadow, marsh and chaparral-all 
crowded into an area easily covered by a 6-year-old. There are longer trails 
for the adventurous. 
</P>
<P>
MESA's staff is made up of specialists in such fields as biology and Chumash 
history, each of whom brings a special approach to the lessons. For instance, 
Gatica said, during craft sessions Bruce Vinent of Ojai often demonstrates 
making rope with native grasses. 
</P>
<P>
"The rope is so strong," she said, "he hangs it in trees and swings from it 
like Tarzan." 
</P>
<P>
It is a demonstration project only. Children's activities are more likely to 
consist of making natural paints from rocks, or creating practical items from 
yucca leaves, such as soap, shoelaces or woven mats. Blow darts are definitely 
not a part of the program. 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
MESA programs are available to groups such as schools, churches and scouts at a 
cost of $8 a day per child. For further information or brochures, leave a 
message at 646-8712.

RECYCLING HAS 2 PURPOSES

<TEXT>
<P>
Asking visitors at the Matilija Environmental Science Area to recycle bottles 
and cans has a practical purpose as well as an ecological one -- it means a few 
more dollars to buy playground equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit society has seen hard times and is not yet out of the financial 
woods. 
</P>
<P>
Although its lease with the county Flood Control District is paid by the 
Ventura County superintendent of schools, MESA has always taken pains to 
maintain its vast acreage through admission fees. In recent years, fire, flood 
and drought have complicated its mission. 
</P>
<P>
When the Wheeler Canyon fire roared through the area in 1985, many trees and 
brushy areas in the canyon were destroyed. The following year, severe rains 
created massive dams of downed wood, which blocked trails and played havoc with 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, MESA staff members, on a volunteer basis, have gradually cleared 
much of the debris and this year the California Conservation Corps has 
contributed about 2,000 hours to rebuilding trails, said Tia Gatica, program 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Gatica said drought conditions have added a few complications, such as 
canceling the aquatic studies program and making it necessary for her to have 
to haul water to the camp restrooms so the toilets can be flushed. 
</P>
<P>
The next step for MESA's future, as Gatica sees it, is more public support. She 
wants to reopen the area to Saturday family walks, offer evening theater in the 
campground and sell handmade craft items. 
</P>
<P>
But she faces a Catch-22. The organization cannot afford to pay the additional 
$1,500 of liability insurance to allow the public in to spend its money. She 
worries about this dilemma, but projects that a way will be found to realize 
the goal, if not this year, maybe next. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she devotes herself to the program, looks for possible grants and 
hauls water. KATHLEEN WILLIAMS

If there's one breed of musician that music critics typically despise, more 
than Phil Collins, even more than Whitesnake, it's cover bands. Most often 
turning out dead, rote versions of other performers' mediocre efforts, average 
cover bands toil not, neither do they swing. 
</P>
<P>
Which makes it just a bit out of the norm that, to this critic's ears, the most 
exciting Orange County band of the last couple of years is a cover band which 
typically can be found plying its trade at upscale coastal clubs. 
</P>
<P>
But, though their material is chiefly familiar hits, to call Derek and the 
Diamonds a mere cover band would be like saying Muhammad Ali was just some guy 
who hit people. 
</P>
<P>
Singers Derek Bordeaux and Venson Quarles seem incapable of performing at less 
than a simmer, and more often than not their open-hearted, entwined soul vocals 
boil over with emotion. They and the rest of the seven-piece outfit have that 
all-too-rare quality of being thoroughly alive onstage, with the music -- no 
matter how timeworn the song might be -- being born in the moment. 
</P>
<P>
A song is never played quite the same way twice, and if it feels right, the 
number might jam on and grow for 20 minutes. It scarcely matters that Al Green 
or Bobby Brown may have written the song; by the time they're through, Derek 
and company have purchased it with all they have to spend. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the dance-floor momentum they generate, it is not unknown for the 
Diamonds to move listeners to tears. And listeners aren't the only ones. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I almost cry when we're singing," Bordeaux said, "and that can 
happen three or four times an evening because I know when it feels right, and 
Venson and I will get eye contact and know exactly what each other is thinking. 
And it's too heavy for me." 
</P>
<P>
The band has some deep roots. Cousins, Bordeaux and Quarles have been singing 
together since they were children. Bordeaux's brother Byron is the band 
guitarist, while drummer Gary Wing and sax player Karl Denson have been friends 
and musical associates since grade school. Rounding out the group is 
keyboardist Francisco Loyo and bassist Gerardo (Lalo) Carrillo. 
</P>
<P>
In this digital age, most club bands with an eye toward earning a living have 
few members and lots of electronic augmentation. The Diamonds head in the 
opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
In a conversation recently with Derek Bordeaux and Quarles at the former's 
Santa Ana home, Bordeaux said, "I don't want to have that programmed stuff 
live, because then there's no spontaneity. We'd like to make more money, yeah, 
but we want to be proud of what we're doing. It's so easy to sound like a CD 
with all of the technology that's around. But it's so locked in when you're 
computerized, you can't change. I want players who can jam and change. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"And," Quarles interjected, "who wants to look at one man and hear an 
orchestra, with voices and instruments coming from nowhere? People like to see 
people sweat." 
</P>
<P>
Both 33, the irrepressible Quarles and soft-spoken Bordeaux have an interplay 
that doesn't stop at the bandstand. They are so adept at finishing each other's 
sentences it scarcely matters that their stories are sometimes wildly 
divergent. 
</P>
<P>
They and Byron were born in Topeka, Kan., and both of their families caught a 
train to Orange County in 1966 after being uprooted by a Midwest tornado. The 
twister proved to be far from the last of their upheavals. 
</P>
<P>
"We were the first blacks that a lot of kids had seen in Garden Grove, the only 
blacks in their schools," Bordeaux said, "They had only seen blacks on TV, so 
they would be turning our hands over, going, 'It's all black here, but why is 
this white?' " 
</P>
<P>
"I had to fight every day," Quarles added. 
</P>
<P>
Bordeaux said: "You know how cruel kids can be. Every time we'd come home we'd 
all have stories about what had happened during the day, how many times you'd 
been called what at school, and asking each other 'How many fights did you have 
on the way home?' I hate fighting, and that still bothers me to this day. 
</P>
<P>
"And it was a culture shock for us because where we came from was all black, 
our section of Topeka. Then, because the land it was on was bought, we ended up 
moving our house (from Garden Grove) to Santa Ana. They dropped the house into 
what seemed to us like the center of Mexico. It was one shock after the other." 
</P>
<P>
Feeling that in the community "there really was nowhere for us to go," members 
of the family wound up spending much of their time indoors, where they had 
their music to rely on. The whole family sang, and their interest in playing 
instruments had begun in Kansas where they had used brooms to pretend to strum 
Beatles songs. 
</P>
<P>
It was a time before they were able to afford real instruments. With 11 kids 
under one roof, their mothers had their hands full supporting them. Both were 
nurses, and they would work alternating shifts, so one of them could be minding 
the children. 
</P>
<P>
The music-making began in earnest when Quarles' mother managed to buy him a 
drum set when he was in the fifth grade. "Then I wanted to learn the sax in 
school," Bordeaux said, "but you had to rent it, and we couldn't afford it. So 
instead my mom bought me a $15 guitar out of a pawn shop on 4th Street in Santa 
Ana and said she'd get me a sax later when she could. We all ended up playing 
that guitar, but Byron really took to it, and he'd lock himself away in our 
room to play it. He thought I wouldn't want him playing my guitar, but I didn't 
care." 
</P>
<P>
"We started a little band, and I didn't just want to be standing around, so I 
figured I'd start singing until I got the sax. I didn't ever get one yet," he 
said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
The group started off singing Temptations and Four Tops songs at family 
get-togethers. Influenced by their older siblings' tastes, by the late '60s 
they were into Jimi Hendrix, Grand Funk Railroad, Buddy Miles, Santana and 
others. They once spent a day collecting pop bottles all over town so they 
could buy Hendrix's "Electric Ladyland" album. 
</P>
<P>
Soon they found a better way of making money, playing high school and college 
dances. Bordeaux and Quarles were then only 13 and in the seventh grade. "We'd 
be ending up with 50 bucks each a weekend, and for a 13-year-old then that 
could really convince you that was what you wanted to be doing with your life," 
Bordeaux said. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, music hasn't always been enough to sustain them, and the three also 
worked for a moving company in the late '70s and early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to move homes in Newport, and I moved a lot of pianos," Bordeaux 
recalled, "I'd set them up and play them a bit, and I got hired to come back 
and play for a lot of dinner parties that way." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Quarles clarified, "We'd be moving furniture, be really humping, and 
he'd sit there and go 'Tinka-linka-link' on the piano, and the owners would be 
going 'Oh, would you play some more? Here, have a beer. . . . Oh, and you all 
there just keep moving.' I hated that job. Every night I'd go to sleep, I'd 
dream the icebox was chasing me, going 'hyugha-hyugha!' " 
</P>
<P>
Though usually in bands together, the three have also gone their separate ways 
at times. Byron had a Hendrix tribute band that was one of the last acts to 
play the original Golden Bear. For a time Quarles and Byron Bordeaux struggled 
along in an original music band, while Derek was in a relative gold mine of a 
cover band. 
</P>
<P>
Quarles said, "He was always saying 'Man, come on over here and get some money 
in your pockets,' and we'd say, 'Come over here so we can do some originals, 
something that's ours.' I think we've finally made it to the middle so we can 
do both." (The Diamonds have dozens of originals, some of which find their way 
into their sets. Byron plans to release his own solo album shortly.) 
</P>
<P>
Derek and the Diamonds were formed in 1986 at the instigation of local musician 
Gary Roach (currently in the Jetsons), playing '60s Motown and Stax soul 
oldies. Bordeaux soon brought Quarles into the group, and before long the other 
original members, who Bordeaux said preferred a smaller, less lively outfit, 
were edged out of the band. 
</P>
<P>
The group has gone through several more member changes in the past year 
(drummer Chuck Morris departed to be in the house band of the Arsenio Hall 
show), and the present lineup is about as lively as Bordeaux wants to get. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the band is so strong I just have to get out of the way. The same 
thing I used to get from Venson I get from everyone in the band now." 
</P>
<P>
Quarles explained: "Basically what we're doing is we push like two runners. 
It's hard to grow if you have nobody to push you. When Derek was with another 
band, I'd come in and he'd go 'Oh, here he comes' because he knew I was going 
to jump onstage with him. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"And he was going to make me work!" Bordeaux cried. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we do that to each other all night long," Quarles said. "I push him, he 
pushes me. At the end of the night when we go home I can't sleep for two or 
three hours because I'm so wound up. I have to walk myself back down to sleep. 
I might be dead tired, but my clock's inside going tick, tick, tick." 
</P>
<P>
"Last night a lady paid me a great compliment," Bordeaux said. "I went up to 
the bar to get some orange juice, and this woman said, 'Your music is so 
moving, so spiritual, even if the things you're singing about aren't 
necessarily spiritual, it's just the way you sing it. I just really feel your 
music so much.' That was a real compliment to me, because I feel it too. And if 
I can get it to come across to you, that's why I'm doing it. That's why we 
don't have a three-piece sounding like a CD. We want the real deal."

Supporters say he has it all: wit, freshness, unpredictability and timing, an 
Everyman comic for everybody. Detractors answer that he's facile but 
unprovocative, amusing but hardly influential, just more white bread in the 
land of generic comedy. 
</P>
<P>
One thing's for sure: Jerry Seinfeld is on his way up, albeit less rapidly than 
some overly enthusiastic college-venue publicists have proclaimed in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The comic, who will take time out from taping 13 new episodes of his critically 
acclaimed "Seinfeld" TV series to perform at UC Irvine's Bren Events Center on 
Friday, admits to being embarrassed by the bell-clanging hyperbole that 
surrounded his last appearance on that campus nearly a year ago. The university 
had immodestly billed him then as "America's most imitated comedian" and "the 
king of observational comedy." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from the set of "Seinfeld," the 36-year-old 
entertainer laughed when reminded of the incident, saying "it was like a circus 
billing, like 'The World's Tallest Man' or something." 
</P>
<P>
This time around, the university's PR people have taken care to avoid 
superlatives that leave little room to move. The crowing is limited to calling 
him "the hot comic voice of observational humor and star of the NBC sitcom 'The 
Seinfeld Chronicles' " (a reference to the sitcom's original title). 
</P>
<P>
Besides putting together the new episodes for "Seinfeld," which may enter NBC's 
lineup as early as this month or as late as January, Seinfeld is beating the 
media-drum to gain momentum. The 30-minute show has already piqued much 
interest -- critics tended to gush about it when four episodes were aired 
earlier this year and the ratings were strong. 
</P>
<P>
That success surprised Seinfeld, who wasn't sure how the ongoing story line of 
a comic going about day-to-day stuff. "I didn't know it would have such a broad 
appeal." 
</P>
<P>
When asked to explain that appeal, Seinfeld hesitated, then thought of Jackie 
Gleason. "They asked Gleason about the incredible longevity of 'The 
Honeymooners' and he just said it was funny. I guess that's the same thing, 
funny transcends everything."

BRAD STINE DOES 'THE WEIRD STUFF'

<P>

County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
Comedian Brad Stine paces the stage like a nervous lion in a cage, a mane of 
shoulder-length blond hair framing his expressive face. He's a comedic Jekyll 
and Hyde, his voice rising in VOLUME and intensity as he mugs and gestures 
through his unusual act. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at life and it drives me crazy," he tells his audience. "Leather 
JACKETS scare me. Think about it: People are wearing dried MEAT for clothing! . 
. . People are spending $500 to wear beef JERKY around town!" 
</P>
<P>
As Stine says, he doesn't do "the standard monologue kind of thing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty wild, man," the Orange County-based comedian says of his act. "You 
have to see it. It's just real high energy, a lot of improv. Very unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"Plus, the last 10 minutes of my act are super bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, only Stine would bid his audience good night and then feign 
disappointment: He's worked so hard to make them laugh and it's not ENOUGH for 
them? 
</P>
<P>
"What do you want me to do, EAT FIRE?" he says sarcastically, lighting two 
torches and yelling, "Party Time!" 
</P>
<P>
As if speaking for someone in the audience, he says: "Yeah, the comedy's OK, 
but we wanted a FREAK SHOW!" 
</P>
<P>
After eating fire ("Not enough for you people? What MORE can I do?"), he works 
his way through eating razor blades, swallowing a steel rod and then -- the big 
finish -- he brings out a long string -- "nose floss." 
</P>
<P>
But Stine, who is appearing at the Laff Stop in Newport Beach through Sunday, 
stresses in an interview that he doesn't want just the closing moments of his 
act emphasized, lest he sound like "some sort of freak." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, in resorting to magic at the end of his act the Orange resident is 
only returning to his show business roots. 
</P>
<P>
Before making the transition to stand-up comedy three years ago, Stine worked 
for seven years doing close-up, sleight-of-hand magic in clubs and restaurants 
throughout Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, he was doing "the weird stuff" even then. 
</P>
<P>
One of his first jobs was at Magic Island in Newport Beach, where diners 
weren't exactly thrilled by the sight of fake blood running out of Stine's 
mouth when he "ate" razor blades. After patrons complained to management, he 
recalls, "they wanted to fire me after the first week." 
</P>
<P>
But even as a magician, he says, "I had the ability to make people laugh." 
</P>
<P>
Explains Stine, who will appear on the Showtime Comedy Club Network Nov. 26: 
</P>
<P>
"I try to do on stage what I'd like to see if I went to a show. I like people 
on the edge of their seats, never really knowing what I'm going to do."

When it came time for UC Irvine to celebrate its silver anniversary, Betty 
Tessman, manager of Lively Arts and Lectures at the university, knew just who 
to ring up. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to have a dance company here," Tessman recalled during a recent 
phone interview, "and I thought: Would there be anybody I could pick who would 
be better than Bella Lewitzky? 
</P>
<P>
"The Lewitzky Company is one of the foremost modern dance companies in the 
United States as well as internationally, and it just happens to come from 
California. I always feel we should honor the folks at home." 
</P>
<P>
So the 25th Anniversary Committee commissioned what would become Lewitzky's 
"Episode No. 1: Recuerdo (Remembrance)," a work that will receive its premiere 
performances by the Lewitzky Company on Friday and Saturday at the Irvine 
Barclay Theatre. Tessman declined to reveal the amount of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Lewitzky said that UCI approached her without placing any restrictions on the 
work other than stipulating that "they were interested in receiving a 
premiere." 
</P>
<P>
"That was fine with me," Lewitzky said in a phone interview from San Jose, 
where her company was performing last week. 
</P>
<P>
"It means I am forced to the wall to complete a new piece. So much time is 
spent in bringing in new company members, maintaining repertory and just 
handling financial woes that it's a pleasure to be able to do the reason for 
all the of the above, which is make a work. 
</P>
<P>
"The work doesn't have a specific link to UCI," she added. "But it has links. 
UCI has been very kind to us. We have appeared again and again on that campus. 
It feels like a home to us, which would be true for UCLA, Occidental College or 
Pepperdine University -- the people who have taken us under their wing. We 
celebrate with all of them. I'm not sure they celebrate, but we do." 
</P>
<P>
The new piece will fall in the middle of two otherwise different programs at 
the Barclay. The other Lewitzky works will be "Game Plan" and "Impressions No. 
2 (Vincent van Gogh)" on Friday; and "Impressions No. 3 (Paul Klee)" and "Pas 
de Bach" on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Lewitzky described the new piece, set to a score by her longtime collaborator 
Larry Attaway, as lasting approximately 17 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it's like an extended woman's solo, which explains the 'I Remember' 
part of it," she said. "It starts with a trio of women and then introduces a 
solo woman. Then the trio of women, who act in a kind of a choric fashion, 
disappears behind a scrim, and a man enters and there is a duet. Then the man 
also retreats to the past, and the woman remains in the final solo. 
</P>
<P>
"It's dark, yes. I think 'sad' is a good word. But it's very touching, I hope. 
At least all my company is responding in that fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so involved in the making process, it's hard to gain distance from it. 
It's an emotional piece in a very simple fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually it takes me a tour of a new work before I can distance myself from it 
and look at it objectively and not subjectively."

SEN. VASQUEZ?: Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez is showing up on political pundits' 
short list of possible successors to Sen. Pete Wilson if Wilson is elected 
governor. . . . Vasquez is one of the Republican Party's young stars, and 
appointing him to the Senate could boost Wilson's standing among Latino voters. 
</P>

Though flattered to be mentioned, Vasquez says only: "For the time being, the 
most important thing is to get Pete Wilson elected."

PROOF WANTED: Scientists have yet to prove there are other solar systems. . . . 
Now comes UC Irvine physics professor Rognvald Garden. With a $25,000 grant 
from the Rockwell International Trust, the Shetland Islands native is building 
an astronomical camera and spectrometer that he hopes will witness the birth of 
planets around distant stars. "Ours will be the only infrared instrument around 
able to detect motions of gases" that are forming planets, he said. Marcida

NAME GAME: Freddy Krueger used to dread Halloween. But this Freddy Krueger is 
not the star of "A Nightmare on Elm Street." 
</P>
<P>
He's Fred J. Krueger, who lives in Orange and sells insurance in Anaheim Hills. 
. . . While having a murderous villain as a namesake attracts crank calls, 
Krueger, 54, says he's now amused by people's reaction to his infamous name. On 
one trip, "the clerks at the car rental counter said: 'We've been waiting to 
see you.' " Marcida Dodson and Jackson Sellers

A 5-year-old boy who was out trick-or-treating Wednesday night with a group of 
children was struck by a car and killed, and his brother was critically injured 
by another car as they attempted to run across a busy thoroughfare, sheriff's 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoang Minh Le and his older brother, Thanh Minh Le, 7, were part of a group of 
five to six children that was trying to cross Cerritos Avenue, when the two 
brothers were struck, said Lt. Richard J. Olson. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 6 p.m. in the 7100 block of Cerritos, about 150 
yards east of Knott Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"They were on the south side of Cerritos when they all decided to cross the 
street," Olson said. "They were almost to the center of the street when they 
decided they couldn't make it to the other side, so they all turned and ran 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that the children were dressed in dark clothing. It was not 
clear if they were under adult supervision, but paramedics who were first to 
arrive at the scene found no adults or parents with the group. 
</P>
<P>
The younger boy was struck by a Volkswagen, Olson said. He was transported by 
ambulance to Anaheim General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
His brother, who was hit by an Oldsmobile sedan, was treated at the scene by 
paramedics and then taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he was listed 
in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
Neither driver was held or cited, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies were initially hampered in their investigation because the 
other children who were part of the group left the scene of the accident, Olson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The group, made up of Vietnamese children who had gotten together in costumes 
to enjoy Halloween, also spoke little English, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Garcia, 14, said she was walking along Cerritos just as it got dark, 
when she saw the group of trick-or-treaters on the north side of the street. 
She said there were five or six children in the group, all dressed in dark 
costumes. "I said to my friend, 'Look. Look at those little kids walking.' " 
</P>
<P>
The girl then saw them run across the street, heard the screech of a car 
braking and saw a Volkswagen hit two boys, she said. The impact sent one boy 
sliding along the street for about 50 feet while the other was thrown onto an 
Oldsmobile and then pinned underneath. 
</P>
<P>
"The first one was all bleeding. I was screaming because I was scared. I never 
saw anything like this before," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Stovall ran outside his apartment after he heard the tires screeching. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the kid lying on the road. I ran up to him and I felt for a pulse and he 
coughed so I knew he was alive," he said. "His eyes were open and they looked 
kind of glassy. Then someone said there was another kid under the car." 
</P>
<P>
Stovall said he took his shirt off and covered the young boy. As he did so, he 
shouted to the remainder of the group of children to run and get the boys' 
parents and they ran off. 
</P>
<P>
Another resident, Irene Leone, said she heard tires screeching in front of her 
apartment. She said that when she went outside to look, "I saw the little boy 
lying out there in the street." 
</P>
<P>
Leone described Cerritos Avenue, a four-lane thoroughfare, as a "very bad 
street, very busy," especially after nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
The drivers of two cars involved in the accident were so distraught that they 
were not allowed to drive home, said Capt. Dan Young of the Orange County Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to secure their cars and call their friends or relatives to come and 
pick them up because they were in no shape to drive home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies were unable to confirm whether an adult had been walking with the 
children before the accident, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
"From our interviews, the best that we've been able to come up with is that the 
oldest in the bunch was only 9 years old," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics, firefighters and deputies who responded to the scene also were 
visibly shaken by the tragedy, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was just a tragic thing to happen on Halloween," he said. "Here they 
were, a group of kids trick-or-treating with costumes which probably gave them 
limited vision and they had no parental supervision.

SMOKING BAN FOR FULLERTON COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIK HAMILTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fullerton College has imposed an all-out smoking ban in all campus buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The decision last week by a 16-member commission makes Fullerton College the 
seventh of eight community colleges in the county that have banned smoking on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress College still allows smoking in designated areas. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, which is made up of educators and other employees at the 
college, voted unanimously for the ban because of increasing evidence of the 
harm of secondhand smoke and a changing attitude about smoking by the student 
population, said Al Bush, spokesman for the college. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the college's last remaining cigarette machine will be removed from 
the student center. 
</P>
<P>
He said the school has no intention of organizing a smoke patrol that would 
cruise the 88-acre campus, issuing citations to smokers. "All we're going to do 
is get rid of the ashtrays on campus," Bush said. "It's up to the students to 
obey the smoking ban." 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, a growing swell of support to ban smoking from public 
buildings and schools has increased. In the county's two public universities -- 
UC Irvine and Cal State Fullerton -- smoking is only permitted in certain 
areas.ERIK HAMILTON

EX-MAYOR ACCUSED OF REMOVING SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Council candidate Robert L. Richardson has accused a former mayor of 
yanking more than 50 of Richardson's political signs from lawns in the last two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In a complaint filed with police, two of Richardson's campaign volunteers, Brad 
Turner and Lisa Evans, said they saw former Mayor James E. Ward removing 
"Richardson for City Council" signs from several lawns in a prestigious part of 
the city early Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Ward, an architect who served on the council from 1973 to 1981, denied any 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not remove any signs," Ward said. "I know it's frustrating to lose 
signs, but I have never made an issue of it." 
</P>
<P>
Richardson, a school board member and an aide to County Supervisor Roger R. 
Stanton, is challenging incumbent Ron May in next week's election. Ward has 
endorsed May. May has refused to comment on the alleged incident. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson said that dozens of his political signs have been stolen from the 
neighborhood -- which is nicknamed North of 17th Street -- since Oct. 20. Last 
Saturday morning, Turner and Evans decided to patrol the neighborhood, 
Richardson said. That is when they allegedly saw Ward pulling out the green and 
orange signs and placing them in his 1989 Chrysler Lebaron. 
</P>
<P>
Turner and Evans then filed a police report on Monday, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected a greater display of maturity from a former mayor and school board 
member," Richardson said. "Anybody who removes a person's political sign is 
acting in a childish fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Lt. Robert Helton said the incident is being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
Ward served as mayor from 1979 to 1980. He was also a member of the Santa Ana 
school board from 1983 to 1987. LILY ENG

3 PLEAD GUILTY IN HIRING-FEE SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A former executive of Digital Equipment Corp. and two others pleaded guilty 
Tuesday to siphoning nearly $300,000 from the computer company and agreed to 
repay the money in lieu of a prison term, Costa Mesa police said. 
</P>
<P>
The executive, Steven William Hunt, 43, of Arcadia, and his accomplices, John 
Francis Mazarella, 54, of Mission Viejo, and Danielle Ann Marie, 42, of Laguna 
Niguel, were each sentenced to eight years in prison and three years' 
probation. They each pleaded guilty to 12 counts of felony grand theft and 
fraud. The prison sentences, handed down in a Harbor Division courtroom, will 
be delayed pending repayment of the embezzled funds, Costa Mesa Police 
Detective Steven R. Labbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
The three were arrested in June after a clerical error revealed that Hunt was 
falsely steering referral fees to Mazarella and Marie, who had set up bogus 
executive employment agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, Hunt scanned applications from newly hired employees in 
high-paying, high-tech positions, Labbitt said. Hunt separated those who had 
been referred to Digital Equipment Corp. by legitimate executive search firms 
from those who responded to newspaper advertisements or applied on 
recommendations from other workers, Labbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt forwarded information detailing annual salaries and positions of those 
employees not referred by head-hunting agencies to Mazarella and Marie, Labbitt 
said. Mazarella, an independent consultant hired to screen employees for 
Digital Equipment, and Marie, who was not connected to the company, set up a 
phony employment agency and used the information supplied by Hunt to bill 
Digital. 
</P>
<P>
"Hunt would receive the invoice and authorize its payment, and it would then go 
to the finance department," Labbitt said after the arrest. "They would see his 
authorization for payment and, because it was his responsibility for processing 
the invoices, they would cut a check and send it out to any one of the four 
fictitious businesses (the suspects) had set up." 
</P>
<P>
Each invoice typically requested 15% of the new employee's annual salary, which 
ranged from $50,000 to $80,000, Labbitt said. The suspects allegedly collected 
fees totaling nearly $300,000 between 1986 and 1989 by claiming that they had 
referred 30 new employees to Digital. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of restitution to the company will be determined at a hearing next 
month, Labbitt said. TONY MARCANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;

<P>
TRACT OKD WITHOUT LOW-INCOME UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has approved a 3,700-home development near the Tustin Marine 
Corps Air Station without requiring that the Irvine Co. include any housing for 
low-income residents in the project. 
</P>
<P>
Critics protested after Tuesday night's five-hour public hearing that the 
council's action ignores housing goals approved last year by the former City 
Council. Those housing goals call for 12 1/2% of housing in Irvine to be set 
aside for families earning half or less of the county's median income and 
another 12 1/2% for other low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the Westpark II development by a 3-1 vote, with 
Councilwoman Paula Werner dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
"Did we get enough out of (the Irvine Co.) in what we approved tonight?" Werner 
said after the meeting. "No, I don't believe so." 
</P>
<P>
The plan approved by the council requires the Irvine Co. to ensure that at 
least 10% of the units built in Westpark II are affordable to families earning 
up to half the county's median income, or $24,550 for a family of four. But the 
requirement takes effect only if the company receives government subsidies to 
build the units. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, though, does require the company to build housing units, convert 
existing housing in the city or pay fees aimed at providing 385 units for 
families earning less than 80% of the county's median, or about $39,280 for a 
family of four. 
</P>
<P>
But since the plan gives the Irvine Co. options around actually building the 
low-income units, the company likely will build none, said Mary Ann Gaido, who 
was on the Planning Commission when it drafted the housing goals. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major change for this city," Gaido said. "It's a major financial 
giveaway to the Irvine Co." 
</P>
<P>
Recent projects approved by the former City Council majority mandated that at 
least 10% of the units built be affordable to families earning half the 
county's median without guarantees of government subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
Approval of Westpark II, which will be located on 350 acres west of Culver 
Drive between Barranca Parkway and Irvine Center Drive, caps three public 
hearings before the City Council and several previous hearings before the 
Planning Commission. The approval requires a routine second council vote later 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Sally Anne Sheridan and the other council members voting for the project 
said they are not turning away from the city's goal of providing affordable 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
Since the city's housing plan has a goal that 25% of housing should be 
affordable to various income groups, she said, mandating builders to follow 
that could effectively stop new houses, including affordable housing, from 
being built. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you want do-able housing, or do you want to make the rules so onerous that 
you can't build any houses at all?" Sheridan said. "That just exacerbates the 
(housing) problem." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman William A. (Art) Bloomer said he is optimistic that financial 
subsidies will be available to allow the Irvine Co. to build the affordable 
units and meet the city's low-income housing goal. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people would have liked to see this (requirement) laid entirely on 
the Irvine Co.'s back," Bloomer said. "And I think if we had done this, the 
Irvine Co. would have pulled back on this project." 
</P>
<P>
Even without mandatory requirements for affordable housing, the Irvine Co. is 
committed to building affordable units in the new Westpark II and will work 
with the city to find the financing, said Michael Le Blanc, vice 
president-entitlement for Irvine Community Builders, the Irvine Co.'s 
residential building wing. 
</P>
<P>
If tract maps for Westpark II are approved on schedule, homes could start going 
up in just over a year, Le Blanc said. Tuesday's plan requires the company to 
provide five neighborhood parks and set aside land for two schools and two 
child-care centers. TOM McQUEENEY

<P>
Two board candidates calling for radical change in the Huntington Beach City 
School District lead in fund raising, according to their financial disclosure 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Robert Mann and challenger Shirley Carey reported collecting three 
times more than any of the other candidates through the reporting period that 
ended Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Financial reports also showed that challenger Michael J. Cassidy, who reported 
having the smallest campaign fund in the race, was the only candidate who 
reported receiving a contribution from former Supt. Diana Peters. Peters 
resigned amid controversy in August, a move that has sharply divided the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy, whose financial report covered only his earnings through Oct. 11 and 
totaled $1,000, received a $100 donation from Peters. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Sherry Barlow and trustees Patricia Cohen and Mann are running 
for reelection Nov. 6 against a field of four challengers. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, who is seeking election to his first full term after being elected in 
1987, had accumulated $11,755 in cash donations, loans and non-monetary 
contributions, according to his report. He reportedly loaned $9,400 of that sum 
from his personal funds. But he was reported to have spent all but $533 of the 
money by the filing period close. 
</P>
<P>
Carey, in her first bid for elective office, reported raising $10,590, $4,200 
of which came from personal loans. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, a nine-year board member, reported raising $3,478, including $2,150 in 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
Challenger Brian Garland received a financial boost from the teachers union in 
raising $2,875 for his campaign. Garland's largest donation was $1,000 from the 
Huntington Beach Elementary Teachers Assn. Additionally, he reported receiving 
$167 worth of postage from the West Orange County United Teachers, the umbrella 
union for teachers. JOHN PENNER

PIERSIDE ACTION OFF COUNCIL AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pierside Village has been withdrawn from the agenda for Monday's meeting of the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Thomas J. Mays said Wednesday that the item was withdrawn because of 
legal considerations. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said he was informed by the city attorney's office that state law 
requires Planning Commission action before transfer of land to a Redevelopment 
Agency. Thus, Mays said, the proposed action on the agenda would not be legal. 
</P>
<P>
The council majority had initially proposed transferring the 3.5 acres of 
beach-bluff land proposed for Pierside Village from city ownership to ownership 
by the Redevelopment Agency, which is an arm of the state. Such a move would 
have sheltered the Pierside land from Measure C, a citizens' initiative that is 
on Tuesday's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Measure C, if passed, would prohibit the city's selling or leasing park or 
beach land without a citywide vote. Supporters of the initiative have said that 
a key goal is to try to block the city from building Pierside Village. 
</P>
<P>
Pierside Village calls for construction of at least two new commercial 
restaurants on paved land abutting the beach at the municipal pier. 
Reconstruction of the existing Maxwell's Restaurant would be part of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Cook, spokeswoman for Save Our Parks, the group that is spearheading 
Measure C, said Wednesday that residents from all over Huntington Beach had 
been calling her to express anger about the council's scheduling last-minute 
action on Pierside Village. "I'm relieved it's now off the agenda, but it makes 
you wonder about what kind of people would try to do something like this," Cook 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They (members of the council majority) only took it off because of legal 
advice. They still don't care how the people feel about this project." BILL

Runners will zip 6.2 miles down the beachfront Saturday morning in a new 
point-to-point race to benefit the Huntington Beach Wetlands Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach Shoreline Classic 10-Kilometer Race will start at Peter's 
Landing -- at 24th Street and Pacific Coast Highway -- and go south to the 
finish line at the Huntington Beach pier. 
</P>
<P>
There will also be a 5-kilometer run and 1 1/2-mile "fun walk." 
</P>
<P>
Participants can register at Peter's Landing on Friday from 3 to 8 p.m. and on 
Saturday from 6 to 7:30 a.m. The registration fee is $15 for both the 10-K and 
5-K races, and the fee is $8 for the fun walk. Participants get a T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
The wheelchair portion of the 10-K race starts at 7:30 a.m. Saturday, and the 
overall 10-K starts at 8 a.m. The 5-K starts at 9 a.m., and the fun walk at 
9:30. 
</P>
<P>
Race officials said entrants can park in downtown Huntington Beach, near the 
pier, and take a free shuttle bus to Peter's Landing on Saturday morning, or 
park at Peter's Landing and take a shuttle bus back from the pier after the 
race. The Shoreline Classic is a point-to-point race that ends at a different 
place than the start. BILL BILLITER

DISHEARTENED DOWNING WANTS TO TALK TO RADER; 
</P>
<P>
ANGELS: DESIGNATED HITTER SAYS HE WON'T FILE FOR FREE AGENCY UNTIL HE AND THE 
MANAGER DISCUSS THE SITUATION. 
</P>

Brian Downing said Wednesday he will postpone filing for free agency until he 
speaks to Angel Manager Doug Rader, but added that he will file before the 
Sunday deadline if he hears "the same garbage" he heard last week from club 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
Downing, who hit .273 in his club-record 13th season after playing sparingly 
until July, was told last week the Angels won't go to arbitration with him. He 
called a return in 1991 "possible but remote" and wants to be sure all 
possibilities have been exhausted before he severs ties with a team for which 
he holds career records in nine offensive categories. 
</P>
<P>
Rader has been on a Latin American scouting trip and is expected back at his 
Florida home this weekend. Downing said he plans to talk to him by phone 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Through my years of seeing guys disappear, I've heard the theme, 'If they'd 
just talked to (the manager), he wouldn't have had to leave,' " said Downing, 
who hit .371 (49 for 132) from June 24 to Aug. 17, when he peaked at .303. 
"Before I run off and sign somewhere else, I want to talk to Doug so he doesn't 
end up saying, 'He should have talked to me.' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looked upon by them as a last resort, and that's not right. It's their 
loss. Somebody's going to get a hell of a big league player. I know I've said I 
never could play for somebody else, but they dumped me. It hurts like heck. 
This is my home and always has been. I'm going to have to move away and leave 
my family behind. But I've always been a fighter. That's what's kept me in the 
big leagues 18 years." 
</P>
<P>
Downing, who earned $1.25 million last season, has been plagued by a back 
muscle problem the past three seasons and considered retirement when he was 
unable to find a remedy. But since beginning a thrice-weekly treatment program 
supervised by physical therapist Valerie Sinkus of Whittier, Downing says he 
has experienced remarkable improvement and is optimistic about regaining his 
old form at age 40. 
</P>
<P>
"I have very little doubt that I'm not going to be 100%. That alone has taken 
10 years off my life and puts me back at 30," said Downing, who visited Sinkus 
after being referred by a friend of his wife, Cheryl. "It's going to be rough 
because it's been three years of constant tearing and damage. I did have 
(Sinkus) write me a letter -- I figure I'd need one when I go begging in the 
streets -- that states that I will be 100% in time. Tomorrow might be my last 
treatment, or it might take a month." 
</P>
<P>
Sinkus said Downing has a muscle imbalance and a restriction of motion in the 
fascia, the thick, fibrous layer of tissue that separates muscle tissue, in his 
right lower back. She said Downing has responded "real well" to micro-current 
therapy designed to stimulate his muscles and restore muscle balance. 
</P>
<P>
Moving on will be difficult for Downing, but his agent, Tom Reich, expects no 
difficulty in attracting interest from other clubs if Downing files for free 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
"As Brian has demonstrated when he's healthy, he's still one of the toughest 
outs with the chips on the line in a game," Reich said. "He's going to play 
next season. He feels better than he has in three years. Brian wants to play, 
and he's feeling very upbeat about that." 
</P>
<P>
Downing was optimistic about returning to the Angels until last Thursday. 
Although he expected to hear them say they would decline to go to arbitration, 
he said he was hurt to hear them say he was merely a part-time player, and he 
contends that they limited him to that role. 
</P>
<P>
"I always knew this is a business, but you never think it's going to happen to 
you," said Downing, a .266 career hitter, .272 for the Angels. "I have no 
second thoughts about anything that's happened here. Hopefully I'll get a 
chance to win somewhere else. . . . At this point, I don't have any choice any 
more (except to file for free agency). They dumped me. I would never have left 
of my own free will." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Richard M. Brown assumes the roles of president and chief executive officer of 
the Angels today. Brown, the club's legal counsel since 1981, was given those 
titles Oct. 4 in a restructuring of the Angels' front office. . . . The Angels 
released their spring training schedule and will play their first exhibition 
game against the San Diego Padres in Yuma, Ariz., on March 8.

10 YEARS AGO 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever works." That's the way Laguna Beach quarterback Lance Stewart did 
things. 
</P>
<P>
An athlete who excelled in football, basketball, volleyball and baseball, 
Stewart did enough to get noticed. But his methods were what warranted 
double-takes. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart threw footballs and baseballs left-handed, but shot basketballs and 
spiked volleyballs right-handed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have more control throwing left-handed," said Stewart, whose father, 
Larry, was a top athlete at Orange High School and later played in the San 
Francisco Giants' organization. "But shooting a basketball right-handed just 
sort of came naturally. I dribble and shoot layups left-handed." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, a 6-foot, 190-pound senior, was a returning second-team All-Southern 
Section choice in volleyball. His various skills drew calls and letters from 
every Pac-10 school; he wound up at California, but did not compete in sports 
there. 
</P>
<P>
When asked which hand he used to eat with, Stewart said: "When I'm hungry, it 
doesn't really matter . . . either of them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5 YEARS AGO 
</P>
<P>
Pressure kicks were not a big deal for Dana Hills junior J.B. Hollis. 
</P>
<P>
Hollis kicked a field goal with 17 seconds remaining that gave Dana Hills its 
second big upset in less than a week, 10-7 over Irvine. Six days earlier, Dana 
Hills had upset El Toro, the South Coast League leader, 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman, Hollis kicked a 37-yard field goal to beat Mission Viejo. 
Earlier in 1985, Hollis kicked one 52 yards, two yards shy of the Orange County 
record set by Gerry Graham of Edison in 1982. And his kick to beat Irvine 
helped revive Dana Hills' season, bringing the Dolphins record to 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
Servite quarterback Tim Rosenkranz also performed under pressure to improve the 
Friars' record to 8-0. Servite beat St. Paul, 35-33, after being down, 33-14, 
at one point and 33-21, with 3:44 left. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenkranz led the Friars' fourth-quarter rally with three touchdowns, throwing 
for two and scoring on a keeper. The winning touchdown was a 36-yard pass to 
Jeff Fieldhouse. Rosenkranz established a school single-game passing record of 
357 yards, surpassing Steve Beuerlein's 345 set in 1982 against Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1 YEAR AGO 
</P>
<P>
The Ball's Not Heavy: Dana Riddle of Rancho Alamitos had the third-best 
single-game rushing total in county history and set a school record with 374 
yards in 52 carries during a 41-14 loss to Pacifica. He also scored two 
touchdowns. Pacifica's Chris Shockley ran for 109 yards on 24 carries. 
</P>
<P>
It's Worth It: Estancia improved to 9-0 and clinched its first Sea View League 
title in 10 years by beating Tustin, 17-12. 
</P>
<P>
Said Estancia Coach John Leibengood: "Hey man, I'm happy. When I got here, they 
told me I had 10 kids on my team, no weight room and no coaches, because they 
all quit. We got our butts kicked for two years. We went 2-18. But in the last 
two seasons, we've gone 16-3-1, and it's because the kids did the work -- they 
ran and pumped weights when all their friends were at the beach having fun. It 
wasn't fun for them back then, but this, this is fun."

GROUNDED GARCIA HAS EL MODENA CLOSE TO TITLE

<P>
Adam Garcia's first game of the 1990 football season was interrupted by a loud 
noise -- the one his right shoulder made when he reached up to bat down a pass. 
</P>
<P>
The El Modena High School senior was playing defensive back when he separated 
his shoulder in the fourth quarter of a 17-7 loss to Edison. 
</P>
<P>
"I went up to hit ball down, and all I heard was this 'pop'," said Garcia, 5 
feet 10 and 165 pounds. "When I landed on the field I was out cold (having 
passed out from the pain). They (trainers) popped my shoulder back in on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
"But when I got to the sideline, the team doctor moved my shoulder around to 
check my mobility, and it popped out again. We had to pop it back in place. It 
was just like Mel Gibson did with his shoulder in 'Lethal Weapon 2.' " 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Garcia, he suffered no long-term damage and missed only two 
games. But the injury ended his days as a defensive back -- and quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"I went back to practice, and there was no way I could throw ball," he said. "I 
couldn't get my arm up high enough." 
</P>
<P>
That was a problem for Vanguard Coach Bill Backstrom. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Prado has taken over as the team's quarterback. But what was Backstrom 
going to do with Garcia, one of his best athletes? 
</P>
<P>
Move him to tailback, of course. 
</P>
<P>
The change has worked out well. In five games as a tailback, Garcia has 519 
yards rushing, including 167 and three touchdowns in a 21-7 victory over Santa 
Ana Valley last week. 
</P>
<P>
El Modena (5-3, 3-0) is hoping for another big game from Garcia tonight when it 
plays Foothill (2-6, 1-2) at El Modena. The Vanguards can clinch the Century 
League title with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Vanguards slipped to 1-2 before Garcia returned from his injury, and lost 
in his first game back, but they have won the past four games. They've averaged 
25 points a game during their streak, and the threat of Garcia as a rusher has 
opened up Prado's passing game. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope it keeps the defenses honest," Garcia said of the game plan. "There's 
no way they can key on just one person. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally put it all together and play as a team. The offensive line is the 
key to the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat vs. Mater Dei at Santa Ana Stadium -- Who will be dancing in 
celebration after this Angelus League matchup? Bishop Amat has some of the 
league's quickest players, but Mater Dei might have the quickest in running 
back Derek Sparks. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat (6-1, 2-0) is coming off a 49-13 victory over Servite. Mater Dei 
(4-4, 2-0) lost to Paramount, 28-11, in a nonleague game. 
</P>
<P>
In other games tonight: 
</P>
<P>
Empire League: Katella vs. El Dorado at Valencia High School, Los Alamitos vs. 
Loara at Glover Stadium; Garden Grove League: Garden Grove vs. Rancho Alamitos 
at Bolsa Grande High School; Orange League: Savanna at Western; Pacific Coast 
League: Laguna Beach vs. Laguna Hills at Mission Viejo High School; Sea View

VOLLEYBALL: AFTER LOSING IN THE NATIONAL SEMIFINALS THE PAST TWO YEARS, SHE AND 
HER TOP-RANKED UCLA TEAMMATES ARE PLANNING TO GET THE JOB DONE.

Jenny Evans has had all kinds of brushes with greatness while playing 
volleyball at Newport Harbor High School and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Take her high school career. The Sailors were 59-6 in her three years on the 
Newport Harbor varsity but never won a state championship. 
</P>
<P>
The success, and frustration, has continued at UCLA. The Bruins were 64-4 the 
past two seasons and entered the Final Four ranked No. 1 both times, only to 
lose in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really tough, because no one can pinpoint what went wrong in the Final 
Four games," Evans said. "I guess we felt comfortable where we were going into 
the finals the last two years." 
</P>
<P>
With the NCAA tournament a month away, Evans and the Bruins (21-1, 13-0 in the 
Pac-10) are hoping this time to hang on to their No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, we know what can happen once we get there (Final Four)," Evans 
said. "It was so hard to believe we could do so well in the regular season, 
then lose when we got to the Final Four." 
</P>
<P>
Evans, a 5-foot-10 outside hitter, isn't the only one trying to figure out 
UCLA's late-season slides. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Andy Banachowski, who has led the Bruins to four national titles in 24 
years at the school, has been scrambling to find a way to motivate his team for 
the finals. 
</P>
<P>
"Both times, we played well all year long," he said. "But we weren't tested 
enough in the regular season. When we got to the Final Four, we had nothing to 
fall back on." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins are getting plenty of tests this year, with a schedule Banachowski 
says is the second-toughest in the nation. They have played seven top 20 teams, 
losing only to Nebraska in their fourth match. 
</P>
<P>
Evans has played well in the Bruins' big matches. She had 24 kills in the 
Nebraska loss and had a season-high 32 in a recent victory over fifth-ranked 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"Matches like the one against Stanford are really going to help us when the 
NCAA tournament starts," Banachowski said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins' 18-game winning streak will be on the line Friday and Saturday when 
they play second-ranked Hawaii and No. 13 Long Beach State in a tournament at 
Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, a junior, has been a big part of UCLA's offense and defense. She's 
second on the team in kills (320), first in aces (30) and second in digs (300). 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone notices her hitting right away," Banachowski said. "But she has 
improved her game in every area. She passes the ball well. Her serving has 
improved tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
After a knee injury sidelined All-American Elaine Youngs, the Bruins had to 
find a new all-around threat. 
</P>
<P>
It was Evans, who has always been adept at scoring big points with a big thump. 
</P>
<P>
"We're using her in a different light this year," Banachowski said. "We've had 
to give her the ball more with Elaine out. That's a role she was used to when 
she was in high school." 
</P>
<P>
Evans relishes it but is quick to add that the Bruins have a more balanced 
attack than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we had one powerhouse (Youngs) controlling the game," she said. 
"This year, everyone has a role. It's hard to pick out just one person because 
everyone is contributing." 
</P>
<P>
Evans is one of five Orange County players at UCLA. She and Marissa Hatchett 
(Sunny Hills) are starters. Laurie Jones (Huntington Beach) and Jennifer 
Gratteau (Marina) are key players off the bench. Youngs (El Toro) is out for 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
"At first it was kind of weird playing with all of them," Evans said. "I had 
played against Jennifer, Elaine and Laurie for five years in club volleyball. 
Then, all of a sudden, we were teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"But I knew UCLA was going to have a good team with all the players it had 
coming into the program. I wanted to be a part of that." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, her senior year at Newport Harbor, Evans was Volleyball Monthly 
magazine's national co-player of the year along with Julie Bremner of the 
College of St. Francis (Ill.). Evans helped the Sailors win the Southern 
Section 5-A title, but they lost to Irvine in the state finals. 
</P>
<P>
Evans had several scholarship offers for volleyball. She thought about 
attending Pepperdine, where her sister Julie played, but settled on UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I was right in between Pepperdine and UCLA," she said. "Making the national 
team is one of my goals, and I know the coaches look at a lot of UCLA players. 
But the tryouts are still a long time away." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, she wouldn't mind winning a national title with the Bruins.

GRAPHICS ZONE PLANS 12 SHOWROOMS IN U.S.

The Graphix Zone, a desktop publishing and computer graphics sales and service 
center, said Wednesday that it has moved its headquarters showroom here and 
that it has plans for 12 showroom-stores across the country. 
</P>
<P>
The company shut its prototype showroom within the Computer City Supercenter 
store in Garden Grove and moved to the new location to be closer to its 
corporate clientele, said Angela Aber, vice president of marketing at the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Graphix Zone, co-owned by former AST Research Inc. managers Aber and Chuck 
Cortright, provides services in desktop publishing, presentation graphics, 
computer-aided design and multimedia computer services. 
</P>
<P>
Aber said the company expects to open three or four stores on the West Coast in 
1991 and an additional eight stores nationwide by the middle of 1993. She said 
the Garden Grove test location was successful, generating a first-year gross 
margin of three times the industry average. 
</P>
<P>
The flagship Irvine store will be at 38 Corporate Park, close to the 
intersection of Jamboree Boulevard and the San Diego (I-405) Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The showroom will feature a demonstration area, like those at trade shows, in 
which customers can try out software products from dozens of manufacturers or 
rent computer time. The showroom will also feature a large service bureau and a 
theaterlike seminar area for corporate presentations. 
</P>
<P>
"In just one year, Graphix Zone has proven that a reseller focused on high-end 
graphics -- with a value-added mind-set and an emphasis on graphics training 
and services -- can achieve growth rates considerably higher than those of 
typical storefront dealers," said Rick Inatome, chairman and president of 
Inacomp Computer Centers Inc. in Troy, Mich.

<P>
Inacomp, a co-investor with Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Corp. in the Stanton-based 
Computer City Supercenters chain, will provide products and equipment to the 
Graphix Zone showroom stores, Aber said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Rusert, executive vice president of Computer City Supercenters, said his 
chain still expects to open 20 to 25 superstores within three to five years. 
However, he said the stores will not include the Graphix Zone as a tenant, 
mainly because of the Graphix Zone's high-end corporate clientele.

SUPPLIERS SEEKING B.P. JOHN LIQUIDATION 
</P>

<P>
Three suppliers of B.P. John Furniture Co., which employs 258 people in Santa 
Ana, have asked a federal bankruptcy court judge to liquidate the company 
because it owes them more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
The suppliers said Wednesday that they filed the involuntary bankruptcy 
petition because they feared that the proposed sale of the 99-year-old 
furniture maker and distributor would make it more difficult to obtain payment 
of their bills. 
</P>
<P>
"The company apparently is underwater," said Robert Dewberry, an attorney for 
the creditors. "Most companies don't stop paying their bills without a reason." 
</P>
<P>
Miles Stover, vice president of operations for B.P. John, said the company 
would fight the bankruptcy action. He said that sales of the company have 
declined in the past year and that the firm has also been hurt taking a charge 
for damaged furniture. 
</P>
<P>
The company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Pasotex Inc. of El Paso, Tex., 
specializes in making water beds, as well as wooden tables, dining room sets 
and bedroom suites. Stover said the legal action could imperil a deal to sell 
the company to an unnamed buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the three creditors who filed the petition to liquidate in federal 
bankruptcy court on Oct. 25 in Santa Ana had sued B.P. John in Superior Court 
in May as well. Webb Massey Co., an Orange wood products manufacturer, sued for 
$49,794 in payments due, and International Forest Product Inc., a wholesale 
lumber distributor in Chino, sued for $56,063. 
</P>
<P>
B.P. John offered a payment schedule, but it was unacceptable to the creditors. 
The company offered to pay 10% above the value on future orders to 
International Forest until the debt was paid off. To Webb Massey, the company 
offered a similar deal for $20,000 worth of the debt, and it offered to return 
$30,000 worth of water bed frames. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a ridiculous offer," said Jeanne Massey of Webb Massey. "The frames are 
a special B.P. John color; nobody else buys them." 
</P>
<P>
An involuntary bankruptcy petition to liquidate must be signed by at least 
three creditors, so Abrasive Belt Cleaner of Elsinore, which has only $126 in 
outstanding bills to B.P. John, agreed to join in, Dewberry said. 
</P>
<P>
He said creditors became nervous that B.P. John would soon be going out of 
business when the company announced a warehouse liquidation sale last June. 
Stover said the sale was to dispose of $1 million in furniture with cracked 
paint.

AUTHOR NOREEN AYRES' LUCK CHANGED RADICALLY WHEN SHE ATTENDED A WRITERS 
CONFERENCE AT SQUAW VALLEY -- AND SHE HAD ALMOST STAYED HOME.

<P>
Writer Noreen Ayres hadn't had much luck finding a literary agent. After all, 
36 of them passed on the chance to take on her first novel. 
</P>
<P>
But Ayres' luck changed dramatically after she began writing a new novel and 
attended the Squaw Valley Writers Conference in August. 
</P>
<P>
She not only met an agent from the William Morris Agency, but the agent loved 
the first 30 pages of Ayres' new novel so much that he agreed to represent her 
on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
The result: Ayres' Orange County-set suspense mystery, tentatively titled "A 
World the Color of Salt," has just been sold to William Morrow &amp; Co. for a 
"six-figure advance." And the novel -- about a forensic scientist, an ex-cop, 
ex-stripper named Smokey Brandon, working in the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department crime lab -- is only half completed. 
</P>
<P>
"I really feel lucky," said Ayres, 50, a former technical writer who began 
writing fiction five years ago. "Actually, I feel lucky just getting the agent 
and everything after that is anticlimactic." 
</P>
<P>
Although most writers go to Squaw Valley with hopes of making valuable contacts 
among the editors and agents who lead workshops during the weeklong conference, 
Ayres said she went "with very low expectations." 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I almost didn't go," she said. "It's hot up there, and I couldn't 
afford it. I guess I went thinking the best I could do would be to get some 
current feedback on my work. But I really walked off with three prizes." 
</P>
<P>
She said she not only met Michael Carlisle, a vice president of the William 
Morris Agency ("He doesn't even take on clients of his own any more") but also 
Doug Stumpf, who would become her editor at William Morrow. 
</P>
<P>
"He conducted a workshop where my stuff was critiqued. He told me he was 
extremely interested and wanted to see the rest of it," she said. (Stumpf was 
Long Beach novelist Robert Ferrigno's editor on "The Horse Latitudes," also set 
in Orange County.) 
</P>
<P>
Ayres' "third prize" was meeting a movie producer who also expressed interest 
in her novel. But, she said, "we're not pursuing the movie thing right now." 
</P>
<P>
For Ayres, it was all too good to be true. 
</P>
<P>
"I first went into this depression, thinking, 'This can't be happening.' You'd 
think I would be walking on air. But I kept thinking of Robert Duvall's line in 
'Tender Mercies': 'I don't trust happiness; I never have and I never will.' 
</P>
<P>
"To me the biggest thing was getting an agent. It's so hard to get an agent." 
</P>
<P>
Ayres knows that all too well. 
</P>
<P>
Her unpublished first novel, "South of Midnight," is a mystery set in Pasadena. 
The 36 agents Ayres sent it to told her they liked the writing but didn't like 
the story. 
</P>
<P>
At her lowest point, Ayres said, she sent her 30 sample pages to one agent "I 
had my heart set on. But before I even got to let him read it, I talked to his 
answering machine and said, 'I know this is terrible thing for a writer to do, 
but I just want to tell you I think what I've given you is dreck and you 
shouldn't even read it.' " 
</P>
<P>
And, she said, "this was after (former Irvine mystery writer-writing 
instructor) Bob Ray went out of his way to introduce me to this man." 
</P>
<P>
Ayres remembers "sitting in the dark with tears rolling down my face, thinking 
what a fool I am. What more self-defeating thing could a writer do? 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the whole thing is indicative of the roller coaster of emotions all 
artists have. Some artists have this wonderful, pinnacle ego, but I think most 
of us go through these peaks and valleys of doubt and confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Ayres, who is a member of Fictionaires, the elite Orange County writers 
workshop group, gave up trying to sell her Pasadena mystery five months ago. 
But by then she had already started to work on her Orange County mystery. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you have to move on, you have to start a new thing that you can get 
excited about," said Ayres, who is writing six hours a day to meet the novel's 
January delivery date to her publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Ayres recalled driving home from her first forensic science class at UC Irvine, 
which she was taking for background information, when the startling first line 
of the new novel came to her: "First they shot him in the mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Recalled Ayres: "When this first line came to me, I knew I was going to sell 
it."

AT SUNDOWN, UCI'S FUNCTIONAL CONCRETE BARCLAY THEATRE TURNS SEDUCTIVE

<P>
Like a medical researcher who ends her workday by doffing her white lab coat 
and slipping into a black cocktail dress, the new Irvine Barclay Theatre at UC 
Irvine undergoes a seductive transformation when the sun goes down. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly in its element at this hour, the building becomes structure as event, a 
commanding signal to both community and campus. It invites. For all the go-go 
action in the restaurant/club scene at the UCI Marketplace across the street, 
the theater is the new pulse of the area. 
</P>
<P>
The building -- near a footbridge spanning Campus Drive -- beckons to both town 
and gown, on a site at the edge of UCI's campus that was selected more than a 
decade ago to appeal to students and the community at large. 
</P>
<P>
"The site had to be highly visible," said Douglas Rankin, the theater director. 
"The building would not have been effective if it had been hidden somewhere in 
the interior of the campus. It had to be there to straddle both the school and 
community." 
</P>
<P>
The building is sheathed mainly in cast-in-place ribbed concrete. Its mass and 
boxy volumes aren't taken in one gulp and are, therefore, less formidable than 
the original 1960s campus structures. 
</P>
<P>
Dusk temporarily brings out the more alluring mauve hues of the concrete until 
dramatic night lighting yields icy washes of color ranging from cool white-gray 
to pink. The dark green glass, which dominates during the day, falls back into 
itself to minimize its harshness. 
</P>
<P>
Even the exposed mechanical apparatus on the second-level roof line -- jarring 
in daylight -- lends intriguing shadows to the commanding evening presence. 
Lighting on the outside plaza is handled with a deft touch. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, there is a legibility to the building and its function not fully 
grasped before dark. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen years in the making, the facility sits comfortably amid surrounding 
architectural styles ranging from middle-of-the-road corporate to last-gasp 
postmodern kitsch. 
</P>
<P>
With all the hoopla attending each architectural arrival to the UCI campus in 
the last decade, it is significant that the recent notice given to the Irvine 
Barclay Theatre has been primarily for its functional achievements. 
</P>
<P>
"It was never about architecture with a big A," said the theater's architect, 
Larry Cannon. "Our basic task was to make a good performance hall. When it came 
down to architecture versus technical emphasis, we didn't give in to whim. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the mass we had to deal with, the buzzwords were restrained 
elegance," he said. "We sandblasted the concrete to bring out its character and 
give it a very fine texture. Even though it is concrete -- and there is lots of 
it -- we made it not crude." 
</P>
<P>
The color is apt: a compatible shade of sandstone blending the light neutrals 
of the campus with the more vibrant takes on neo-Mediterranean strewn 
throughout the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
The circulation plan starts at a small, recessed plaza at the forefront of the 
building and at the base of the bridge hub. Composed of an oddly 
unsophisticated patchwork color jumble of concrete brick, the limited expanse 
of paving extends the theater and marks its actual entrance. 
</P>
<P>
The plaza cries for amenities. Conducive landscaping, seating, the basics. 
</P>
<P>
These are expected to be provided as budgets permit. But if you're going the 
no-frills route, why the rather gratuitous gestures such as the curlicue-pipe 
hand railings and the bronze donor plaques set in the ground? 
</P>
<P>
For that matter, fewer mushroom-shaped lights dotting the exterior arcade would 
have saved a few cents and made for some visual relief. 
</P>
<P>
The lobby too has a major problem: The color scheme of its facade is dark green 
glass, plus darker metallic-blue aluminum panels. The skin for the two-story 
lobby and upper gallery should be a counterpoint to the concrete surfaces of 
the rest of the building. Instead, its shading drags down the other materials 
and paints a far-too-serious face on what, after all, will be a fantasy world. 
</P>
<P>
The city dwellers are used to this kind of applied severity to their buildings. 
But unless the message to the student body is that it's a hard, cruel world out 
there, a warmer, lighter surface might have been used for the jutting form. 
</P>
<P>
In defense of his choices, Cannon said that the green glass is necessary for 
controlling the heat on the south side of the building and that he went with as 
light a shade as possible. And for the panels, he's nothing if not pro-blue. 
</P>
<P>
Graceful touches can be found even where budget concerns held forth. The 
painted gypsum board for the foyer walls is honest and direct, making more 
sense here than most applied finishes would. The metal-strip ceiling has both 
acoustical deadening capacity and a nice way of throwing off warm light. 
</P>
<P>
In the auditorium, Chen Hall, the design challenges were obviously more 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
"The toughest thing was to fit the architecture to the geometry defined by the 
acoustician," Cannon said. 
</P>
<P>
Sight and sound requirements took care of the curve of the balcony, the angling 
of the walls and the height of the stage. Everything beyond the technical 
imperative was done, according to the architect, to provide warmth and 
intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
The auditorium has 756 seats, the farthest out a cozy 60 feet from the 
proscenium arch. The full-quality professional stage is 40 feet deep and 80 
feet wide. Acoustics can be regulated to favor either speech or music. 
</P>
<P>
The real high point of the auditorium, whose primary purpose was to bring down 
the scale of the hall, is the nickel-plated meshing that loops low to foil 
large ceiling gaps. 
</P>
<P>
The theater is dark -- even when an event is planned. According to theater 
designer Paul Landry, the wall color -- a dusky rose -- was chosen because it 
is unobtrusive and doesn't reflect light. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing to happen in a theater is not the sidewalls but the 
event," he said. "If the walls were all white, you'd never get rid of them." 
</P>
<P>
Curtain warmers and house light manipulation will resolve the matter of ambient 
color for each performance. 
</P>
<P>
A quibble? 
</P>
<P>
There's just too much trim. All the molding -- the applied half-round verticals 
and the classic egg-and-dart pattern -- detract from the simple focus of the 
room. They seem superfluous. Except that maybe this was the only place the 
architect could play, given the many technical limits he faced. 
</P>
<P>
As in any newly completed building, there are kinks to be worked out -- minor 
imperfections for the most part indiscernible to the average theatergoing eye. 
</P>
<P>
At a cost of $17.6 million for 55,000 square feet, the theater was expensive to 
build. As monetary constraints snipped and reduced amenities, so too must these 
be added when funding permits. 
</P>
<P>
A planned second phase of construction will bring a smaller studio theater with 
separate lobby entrance to the southwest edge of the building. Management 
offices are also slated for that end at a later time. 
</P>
<P>
As for the design of the theater in relation to other campus offerings of the 
past several years: "It was just one approach," Cannon said. 
</P>
<P>
"Architecturally," he said, "UCI is a mixed bag. There are some very good 
buildings and some not good. Some are going to look like dinosaurs in a few 
years, and not at all withstand the test of time. We went for permanence and 
presence and rejected the trendy." 
</P>
<P>
No deliriously poetic exercise, the building is a dynamic and will have a long 
run in a pivotal role.

HER SECOND ALBUM MAY DECIDE WHETHER COUNTRY SINGER JANN BROWNE KEEPS RISING OR

If Jann Browne takes a few steps from her front door, she can see the promised 
land. 
</P>
<P>
No more than a mile away, amid bare, dune-like, green- and dun-colored hills, 
rise the white structures that mark the upper rim of Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre. The 15,000-capacity concert bowl is one of the pop palaces where 
country singers like Browne go when they've made it big. 
</P>
<P>
"I spend a lot of time up in those hills. I take my dogs up there and watch 
them chase coyotes. I do a lot of contemplating, serious thinking," the tiny 
singer with the mild twang and gentle huskiness in her speaking voice said 
Tuesday during an interview in the townhouse where she has lived for the past 
10 years, almost within arm's reach of those hills. 
</P>
<P>
For most of that time, Irvine Meadows has been in ready view, but not even 
remotely within reach. From her arrival in Orange County in 1978, Browne was a 
singer making a living on country music's sawdust-covered ground floor. For 
five hours a night, five or six nights a week, she and her back-up players 
"would have to be a human jukebox and play whatever was on the charts" as they 
plied the local circuit of bar rooms and honky-tonks. 
</P>
<P>
Now, symbolically speaking, the view from Browne's front yard to Irvine Meadows 
looks a little different. At 36, she still faces a long climb on the career 
ladder before she can have any hope of headlining a big amphitheater. But with 
a successful, well-received debut album behind her, Browne is finally off the 
floor and out of the sawdust. She has her foothold on the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
Browne, who plays Friday at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, finally 
emerged on the national country scene this year with "Tell Me Why." The album 
yielded two Top 20 singles on the Billboard country charts and hung on for six 
months on the albums chart before dropping off two weeks ago. From June through 
mid-October, Browne kept up a steady regimen of club dates and county fair gigs 
that helped establish her as a contender. The Coach House show, and a Nov. 10 
concert in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., that will be taped for cable showing on the 
Nashville Network, mark her final performances to support the album. 
</P>
<P>
Browne's musical career began in the mid-1970s in a cabin beside a river, eight 
miles outside her hometown of Shelbyville, Ind. That's where she and her first 
band rehearsed. 
</P>
<P>
"We were terrible, but we had fun and we were very committed to doing what it 
takes," Browne recalled as she sat in a neat, airy living room dominated by 
earth tones and decorated with craft items, art objects and wall hangings in 
Western, Mexican and American Indian motifs. Browne said her old cabin in 
Indiana was the ideal place for a novice band to practice. "We were far enough 
out of town so we wouldn't hurt anybody's ears," she recalled with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Browne's grandparents, with whom she lived during much of her childhood, had 
been professional square dancers. But while she grew up with country music, 
Browne recalled, it took a few years for country to grow on her. 
</P>
<P>
"Did I take to it right off? No, I was very rebellious. I didn't indulge myself 
in it any more than I had to. I had to tag along on Saturday nights to watch 
(the square dances). I wasn't too thrilled about it in those days. I couldn't 
wait till the bluegrass band stopped playing so I could go over to the jukebox 
and hit something really cool." Motown and Aretha Franklin were more Browne's 
speed, but classic country also caught her ear. "I didn't admit it to people, 
but I occasionally stuck a Merle Haggard or Buck Owens record on and very much 
enjoyed it." 
</P>
<P>
Around the time she started her cabin band, Browne fell for the blend of rock 
and tradition-minded country music created by Gram Parsons, the Flying Burrito 
Bros., and, especially, Emmylou Harris. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what changed my mind, and I started re-evaluating what I wanted to do. 
It was very appealing to me. You start digging into those albums and finding 
the writers of those songs, like the Louvin Brothers. It just snowballed." 
</P>
<P>
Before long, Browne and her band were out of the cabin and on the road, playing 
the sawdust-floor circuit through the Midwest and the South. She steered clear, 
though, of the place that beckons most aspiring country careerists. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really afraid of Nashville. There were so many people trying to do the 
same thing I was trying to do that I deliberately stayed away. I knew I wasn't 
ready for any big, major thing to happen in my career because I was still 
trying to figure out what I was doing. I needed time and experience in the 
honky-tonks." 
</P>
<P>
Browne wound up with more of that than she bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
She came to Orange County at the suggestion of her mother, who was living in 
Costa Mesa. Her bar-band regimen continued. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably played every honky-tonk, dive and bar in Orange County at one time 
or another," she said. "The tough part to me was singing five hours a night and 
singing cover material that I didn't always like. But I was making a living, 
and that was my first priority. Those nights got long sometimes. I would have 
to take sabbaticals and talk myself into going back." Those breaks to recharge 
usually lasted a month or two, but at one point in the mid-'80s, Browne said, 
she felt so burned out that she took a full year off. 
</P>
<P>
Browne got a taste of somewhat higher-profile touring from 1981 to 1983, when 
she performed with Asleep at the Wheel, the well-regarded Western swing band 
from Austin. Browne said she got the gig by jumping on stage and belting a 
soulful "Will the Circle Be Unbroken" with the band when its regular female 
singer failed to come back for an encore in a Los Angeles club show in which 
Browne had been the opening act. 
</P>
<P>
But when Browne resumed her solo career, the Asleep at the Wheel credential 
didn't leave her any closer to landing a recording deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to a lot of the 'Hey, baby, I'm going to make you a star' kind of 
producers, but it just didn't click," Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny Swallows Inn in San Juan Capistrano had always been Browne's favorite 
gig, the place where she had a following that would let her play what she 
pleased instead of demanding a replay of the current country hit parade. There, 
she began singing with Steve Fishell, a member of Emmylou Harris' band who was 
moonlighting at the Swallows with a group called the Gizzard Brothers. With 
Fishell as her producer, Browne finally landed a contract with Curb Records. 
</P>
<P>
When "Tell Me Why" was released last January, Browne tried to keep her hopes in 
check. "It just felt like a sense of accomplishment to have my own album out 
there. I didn't know if it was a good idea to have too many expectations or big 
dreams." 
</P>
<P>
Fishell had recruited an all-star group of backing players for the album, 
including Browne's key influence, Harris, who sang harmony vocals on "Mexican 
Wind" (Browne wrote the song with her husband and road manager, Roger Stebner, 
and Pat Gallagher, an old friend from Shelbyville). 
</P>
<P>
"Tell Me Why" earned good reviews, and it yielded two modest hits -- the 
plaintive but rocking title song and the sassy "You Ain't Down Home." It was 
enough to launch Browne as a touring act, sharing bills with the Kentucky 
Headhunters, Vince Gill and Restless Heart, reuniting with Asleep at the Wheel 
at the Farm Aid show, and joining George Jones for a duet on a Canadian 
television show. 
</P>
<P>
That taste of success hasn't made Browne cocky. All those years in the bars 
must have had a chastening effect because she sounded wary as she talked about 
her prospects. There were lots of times, Browne said, when it seemed that she 
would be stuck at the barroom level, and she isn't entirely convinced that 
those days are gone for good. 
</P>
<P>
A lifetime of honky-tonks "was a strong possibility, and it still could be," 
Browne said. "I have a long way to go before I'm an established artist." 
</P>
<P>
With Fishell again producing, work on her second album is almost complete. It's 
a pressure-laden moment in Browne's career: a sophomore release can decide 
whether a contender keeps rising, or fades downward into the pack. "I didn't 
sit down and become too analytical" about how to proceed, she said. "I tried to 
choose songs that would work for me. I think it's a little feistier than the 
first album." 
</P>
<P>
When she takes her walks in the nearby hills, or heads out to the desert 
landscape that she loves and uses as a regular retreat, Browne will try not to 
think of the career pressures that come with having to follow up on a promising 
start. 
</P>
<P>
"That could cause me sleepless nights if I dwell on that too much, and I try 
not to," she said. "Of course I'm scared of the sophomore jinx. I stay pretty 
low-keyed about these things. I'm afraid to get my hopes up too high. I'll just 
see what it's going to do." 
</P>
<P>
With the interview over, Browne stepped outside into a sunny afternoon that 
afforded a clear view of Irvine Meadows, looming in the nearby hills. 
</P>
<P>
"If I ever do get to play there," she said, "I promise you I will walk."

THE MAN WHO'S TAKING THE RAP; 
</P>
<P>
POP: CHARLES FREEMAN LEFT A BROOKLYN GHETTO TO GET AWAY FROM 'A LIFE OF CRIME.' 
NOW HE FACES A YEAR IN JAIL IN FLORIDA FOR SELLING A 2 LIVE CREW ALBUM. 
</P>

<P>
Thanks in large part to the national obscenity controversy surrounding the 
Miami rap group 2 Live Crew, the group's "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" album has 
sold more than 2 million copies -- earning the Crew's leader, Luther Campbell, 
approximately $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
And making him a national celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 of the "Nasty" albums were sold at E.C. Records, a tiny store in 
nearby Ft. Lauderdale -- earning its owner, Charles Freeman, about $3,000. And 
putting him in line to become, possibly, the first person in the United States 
to go to jail for selling obscene music. 
</P>
<P>
While Campbell is touring the country with 2 Live Crew and promoting his recent 
solo album, which has sold more than 500,000 copies, Freeman is back home 
facing up to a year behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just an average guy, trying to make a living," he said by phone from his 
store. "I don't drink or smoke or do drugs." 
</P>
<P>
For weeks now, Freeman has been worrying about a Friday court date during which 
he was to be sentenced by a Broward County judge -- not knowing when he kissed 
his wife and four children goodby whether he would be returning home. 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday, Judge Paul L. Blackman approved a motion granting the retailer a 
Nov. 16 hearing to allow his attorney to argue for a new trial and a judgment 
for acquittal. The decision meant Freeman's sentencing would be postponed until 
after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The action may have only postponed his agony. 
</P>
<P>
"This bust has totally disrupted my life," Freeman said after hearing Wednesday 
of the postponement. "I couldn't sleep last night. My business has been 
crippled. My wife and kids are upset and my ulcers are about to kill me. I 
vomit after every time I eat." 
</P>
<P>
The irony, Freeman said, is that he left "a life of crime . . . running with 
gangs" in his native Brooklyn, N.Y., and moved to Florida to pursue a 
legitimate career after his mother warned that he was going to end up in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"I never imagined I'd be about to go to jail for selling a record," he said. 
"I'm just trying to earn an honest living down here. No judge should be allowed 
to dictate what kind of music an adult can listen to." 
</P>
<P>
Freeman, 32, was arrested June 8 for selling a copy of 2 Live Crew's "As Nasty 
as They Wanna Be" to an adult undercover police officer two days after a U.S. 
district judge in Ft. Lauderdale ruled that the record violated a Florida 
obscenity statute. 
</P>
<P>
He was convicted of selling obscene material on Oct. 3 by an all-white jury and 
faces a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said he has been selling albums by 2 Live Crew and other "even more 
sexually explicit" rappers, along with a small stock of gospel, comedy and 
R&amp;B records, since he opened his mom-and-pop shop in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody in the black, middle-class neighborhood where he rents the 
800-square-foot storefront ever complained, he said, until anti-obscenity 
crusader Jack Thompson initiated a campaign against the "Nasty" album in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
"2 Live Crew's 'Nasty' album was dead and buried before Jack Thompson came 
along," Freeman said. "He gave it mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and brought it 
back to life. Thompson was unemployed before he got into this obscenity thing. 
Now he's out there trying to earn money on the lecture circuit debating about 2 
Live Crew." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, in the middle of 30-stop college campus tour, was unavailable for 
comment. But Det. Eugene McCloud of the Broward County Sheriff's Department, 
the officer who arrested Freeman, said the record-store owner has no one to 
blame but himself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like some guy stealing crack cocaine in the streets saying, 'Hey, I dare 
you to do something about it,' " McCloud said. "Well, eventually a guy like 
that tends to draw attention to himself. The only reason Mr. Freeman was 
arrested was because he openly defied the law." 
</P>
<P>
Still, people in the Brooklyn neighborhood where Freeman grew up do not view 
him as a criminal. One of six children reared in a welfare-recipient family, 
Freeman quit the gang he ran with in 1977 to move to Ft. Lauderdale. He worked 
as a maintenance man, a porter and a street deejay before opening his store. 
</P>
<P>
His aunt, Mary Alice Freeman, said Freeman's relatives and childhood friends 
support him "110%" in his free-speech battle. 
</P>
<P>
"He's like a hero to everyone back home," his aunt said from the apartment 
building where Freeman was raised. "We're all glued to our TV sets waiting to 
see if they put him in jail." 
</P>
<P>
Freeman's First Amendment stance has drawn him into the national 
anti-censorship debate. He has appeared on "Donahue," "Crossfire," "Geraldo" 
and "Good Morning America." His attorney, Bruce Rogow, suggested that Freeman's 
act of civil disobedience is historic. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a modern First Amendment martyr," Rogow said. "If only there were 1,000 
Charles Freemans. The fact is, if all the retailers in America had the courage 
to stand up to the censors like Charles did, none of this would be happening at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most powerful forces in the music industry have pledged to support 
Freeman in his legal battle. On Friday, Freeman is scheduled to meet in 
Washington with Recording Industry Assn. of America Executive Vice President 
Hilary Rosen. Freeman said he is grateful that the record industry has finally 
signed on to support him in his struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"The crusaders are after mom-and-pop shops like mine right now, but you big 
retail chains and record companies better watch your backs," Freeman said. "If 
I go to jail, you better believe they'll be coming after you next."

HUMOR IS A MAJOR EXPORT IN BRITISH COLLECTION OF ADS 
</P>

So there's this East Indian guy in native dress doing an Elvis impersonation 
with a sitar slung across his hips and a trio of bobbing women in saris -- a 
hysterically funny TV commercial for an Indian snack. Or how about the 
fresh-faced young man calmly watching a customs inspector pluck out a bag of 
white powder from his luggage -- no problem, the stuff is Persil washing powder 
packed by his mum. 
</P>
<P>
These videos were part of a cavalcade of new British work in advertising, 
introduced Tuesday night by Edward Booth-Clibborn, chairman of the Designers 
and Art Directors Assn. of London, in a Festival of Britain-sponsored program 
at Crystal Cove Auditorium, UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The presentation began with a brief clip from a Soviet TV program of 
Booth-Clibborn wandering the streets of Moscow and offering opinions on the 
sorry state of consumer awareness over there. "Russia is very keen to get into 
advertising," he told the sparse UCI audience afterward, "but they know nothing 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
Britain, on the other hand, got over its growing pains years ago. 
</P>
<P>
As Booth-Clibborn explained, his country was indebted to the United States for 
inspiration during the 1960s, even slavishly copying American colloquialisms. 
</P>
<P>
But during the '70s, advertising began to capitalize on British values and 
verbal quirks. Combined with the national emphasis on the honing of specialized 
crafts -- notably typography -- the industry shot ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Examples of catalogues and record covers by two young firms with names that 
sound like rock groups -- Why Not Associates and the Thunder Jockeys -- are 
rife with letters and words that spew across the page like champagne froth. 
</P>
<P>
Images are forced to undergo fragmentation, overlay, dissolve and other tricks 
that aim to turn the static page into a somersaulting assault on the senses. 
</P>
<P>
Such work may be design fallout from the British punk movement (Booth-Clibborn, 
who had little to say about why he selected particular examples, was mum on the 
subject). 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the more memorable ads he showed exploited more traditional facets 
of the British character -- such as understated humor and a love of 
eccentricity for its own sake -- in amusing or startling new ways. 
</P>
<P>
Posters for a new banking system with no branches that won 100,000 new accounts 
(in a country where, Booth-Clibborn said, people rarely change banks) got 
viewers' attention by means of utterly banal and irrelevant photographs, such 
as a pair of rubber boots drying by a radiator or a faucet and bar of used soap 
at the edge of a bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
In an amusing parody of consumer choice, viewers of a TV commercial for the 
bank were asked to select an "optimistic" or "pessimistic" version of the ad by 
staying tuned or switching to the other British commercial station for the 
other point of view. 
</P>
<P>
Other commercials showed people talking about the bank -- such as the earnest 
black clergyman sipping tea who said he'd never actually seen the people at 
First Direct, "but I believe, I believe they exist." 
</P>
<P>
There's a commercial that offers an ode in elegant verse to a pea sitting in 
the center of a china plate (in the end, a fork unceremoniously squashes it; 
the product is mashed peas). And there's the tale of the bickering couple and 
their dotty adult son who lives a 5-year-old's fantasy life. When he gets his 
folks out of a jam by dashing off to call the "talking pages" (a telephone 
yellow pages service), he proudly reminds them -- this is the only-in-Britain 
part -- that he is 52 years old and a high court judge. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the good work is humorous. 
</P>
<P>
One public interest commercial shows a young man in a hospital setting, holding 
onto parallel bars as he musters all his strength to try to move his body a 
tiny distance. The struggle continues for an almost unendurable length of time 
while a woman's voice constantly murmurs encouragement. At last a sentence 
flashes on the screen: "Drinking and driving wrecks lives." 
</P>
<P>
Another commercial contrasts images of emaciated black children with actual 
tapes of rousing debates in Parliament about such issues as maintaining the 
percentage of water in Scotch and imposing a tax on chocolate biscuits. 
</P>
<P>
The message: "It would only take about a dozen letters to make your MP (Member 
of Parliament) talk about (the 5 million Third World children who die every 
year) instead." 
</P>
<P>
The intelligence and freshness of this work -- as well as its more leisurely 
pace and the emphasis on first-rate black-and-white photography -- make it 
superior to the American product. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the British examples almost make you wonder if commercials, with their 
own rules of brevity and immediacy, could possibly provide a model for a new, 
broadly accessible quick-hit art form that could make you laugh, think, recoil 
or sympathize in the twinkling of an eye.

PREPPING FOR L.A.'S PODIUM; 
</P>
<P>
FINE-TUNING THE PHILHARMONIC FOR SALONEN'S '92 TAKEOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Although it has been only 18 months since Andre Previn abruptly resigned as 
music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, an orchestra for 1992 -- 
Esa-Pekka Salonen's orchestra -- is already taking shape. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the signs of change are overt, as in the announcement of a whole new 
performing-recording unit, the reaching of agreement between management and 
players on a new contract which will place the Philharmonic at the fore of U.S. 
orchestras in size and salary, and trends in programming. 
</P>
<P>
Other changes are more subtle. Heiichiro Ohyama's name has quietly disappeared 
from the masthead as assistant conductor (his contract was not renewed). 
Meanwhile, Previn's other assistant, David Alan Miller, has been promoted to 
associate conductor (his contract is for two years), leaving Salonen a clean 
slate for an assistant of his own choice when his term as music director begins 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Stucky's period as composer-in-residence also ends with this season, 
and there are strong indications from within the Philharmonic that another 
change in the artistic leadership will be announced shortly. 
</P>
<P>
The Philharmonic began the season by launching the Carnegie Hall centennial 
celebrations in New York. The home season then opened with three weeks of 
Previn programs -- with associate conductor David Alan Miller replacing Previn 
on the podium last week -- which offer some suggestive contrasts with the 
Salonen program on tap tonight, including a new piece that was first considered 
in Previn's term but only became a firm commitment under Salonen. 
</P>
<P>
"I like combining things that can be contrasting or surprising. There will be 
some fairly wild combinations in my first season. I believe in combining old 
and new works -- I'm not a great believer in barriers between eras and styles." 
</P>
<P>
In that regard, Salonen actually considers the program tonight, surrounding 
some early Sibelius and a new Finnish piece with standards of French 
Impressionism, to be fairly conservative. The tie that binds is in fact Kaija 
Saariaho's new work, "Du Cristal." 
</P>
<P>
"It is kind of in between, a link from the Impressionists to Sibelius," Salonen 
says. "It is a colorist piece, but it's not really neo-anything." 
</P>
<P>
"The piece was originally commissioned by the Helsinki Festival," said 
Saariaho. "I came to discuss it with my publishers, who wanted to get me a 
big-figure fee, so they suggested a joint commission to Mr. Previn and Mr. 
(Ernest) Fleischmann (Philharmonic managing director)." 
</P>
<P>
The Philharmonic expressed interest in the work, which was given its world 
premiere by Salonen on Sept. 5, at the Helsinki Festival. But "the problem was 
always: Who would conduct? It was quite obvious that it ("Du Cristal") was not 
Previn repertory," Saariaho said. 
</P>
<P>
That problem was readily resolved by the advent of Salonen, a longtime 
acquaintance of the 38-year-old composer. 
</P>
<P>
"Du Cristal" is Saariaho's first piece for large orchestra. She works slowly, 
and on only one piece at a time. "It ("Du Cristal") has been in my mind for a 
long time," the composer said. "The piece must exist in my mind before I can 
write it." 
</P>
<P>
Although Saariaho is deeply interested in using computers and electronics in 
music, "Du Cristal" only employs a single synthesizer in the orchestra. It has 
a partner piece, "A la Fumee," which will feature the amplified and 
electronically processed sounds of cello and alto flute soloists. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases the titles, "From Crystal . . . Into Smoke," suggest "the 
different ways a material can exist, such as water becoming steam," according 
to the composer. This follows her interest in the possibilities of musical 
transformations, which suffuse "Du Cristal." 
</P>
<P>
The piece also features some innovative string techniques, involving trills 
between normal notes and harmonics, and bow pressure, and Saariaho is attending 
rehearsals to ensure that those demands are understood. She is also listening 
carefully to balances, because "all the time there are three layers of things 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
Salonen, however, said we will not be awash in Finnish music during his tenure. 
"I don't see my role in L.A. as an ambassador for Scandinavian music. Of 
course, I will program music that I know, by composers I know, but the emphasis 
is going to be on American music, because I see that as a basic 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
The Philharmonic has already forged a respectable reputation for programming 
American music under Previn, as represented by the program last week, featuring 
Stucky's "Angelus" and William Schuman's Third Symphony, both works that Previn 
and the orchestra offered to Carnegie Hall audiences in September. 
</P>
<P>
The repertory which Salonen believes should be strengthened in the Philharmonic 
programming may be a surprise, though not to those who have studied his 
Philharmonic agendas since his debut with the orchestra in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are certain areas which I would like to emphasize more -- Haydn, 
Mozart, all the Classical composers," Salonen, 34, said. "I don't believe in 
the total reconstruction of a style. Our brain is different, we hear things 
differently, so I'm not deeply worried about (period) instruments." 
</P>
<P>
The organization behind Salonen's vision for the orchestra seems healthier than 
ever. Compared to the major Eastern orchestras, the Philharmonic has a 
relatively small endowment, and relies instead on revenue from Hollywood Bowl, 
something explicit in the formation of the new Hollywood Bowl Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Under Fleischmann, the Philharmonic has parlayed the Hollywood Bowl into a 
major asset, keeping a budget now approaching $30 million firmly in the black. 
This financial muscle is reflected in the new musicians' contract, which has 
been approved by the orchestra players, though official signing is still a few 
weeks away, according to trumpeter Boyde Hood, chairman of the Orchestra 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The three-year contract provides for a total 18% increase, bringing the base 
weekly wage to $1,240 for the 1992-93 season. If other orchestras do not boost 
their scale in the interim, that will leave the Philharmonic in a virtual tie 
with the Philadelphia Orchestra as the highest paid in the country. With 
provisions for four additional string players, it will also make the 
Philharmonic the largest orchestra in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a validating process," Hood says, "and a vote of confidence from 
the (Philharmonic) Assn., that they think we are one of the top orchestras in 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
The Philharmonic that Esa-Pekka Salonen will lead into the planned Disney Hall 
is clearly an empire in the making -- two orchestras now, the Philharmonic 
Chamber Music Society (six concerts at Gindi Auditorium), the Green Umbrella 
new music concerts (seven concerts at the Japan America Theatre) -- embodying 
much of the "community of musicians" concept espoused by Fleischmann two years 
ago. As such, it may become a model for the orchestras of the new century.

"South Africa Now" may have won its battle to remain on the air at KCET Channel 
28, but now the weekly newsmagazine faces a life-threatening struggle of a 
different sort. 
</P>
<P>
The 2 1/2-year-old program, which airs Sundays at 9 a.m. on KCET, is facing a 
financial crisis so acute that the producers have begun sending letters to 
viewers asking for contributions. 
</P>
<P>
The program nearly lost its spot in the KCET lineup when station executives 
announced two weeks ago that they were planning to drop it because they 
believed it to be biased in favor of the African National Congress. After 
protests from community groups and an appeal from public-television station 
WNET in New York, the station agreed Friday to reinstate the program for at 
least six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"South Africa Now" producers have sent letters to organizations and individuals 
who supported the program during its tussle with KCET asking point-blank for 
financial aid, even noting that such contributions would be tax deductible. 
</P>
<P>
"We barely have the funding in place for the next 13 weeks," producers Danny 
Schechter and Rory O'Connor wrote. "After that we will be forced off the air, 
not by political extremists or conservative programmers, but because of our 
inability to find sustaining support from foundations and corporations." 
</P>
<P>
Schechter, in a telephone interview from his office in New York, said that it 
costs about $20,000 per week to produce "South Africa Now," not counting an 
additional $5,000 in studio costs and services that are provided by supporters 
within the TV industry. 
</P>
<P>
That's a shoestring budget by television standards, but he said that it is 
difficult to raise even that much for a program that is often skeptical of the 
U.S. and the South African governments and that has questioned the activities 
of major corporations with regard to South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going now on grants we have received from the Rockefeller and Ford 
foundations," Schechter said. "That money is going to run out." 
</P>
<P>
"We try to help them as much as we can, but we have no money here," said Fred 
Noriega, head of public-affairs programming for public-station WNET, which 
sponsors "South Africa Now" within the Public Broadcasting Service. "They are 
struggling for survival." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega said that keeping "South Africa Now" in production was of major 
importance to WNET, where programmers view it as one of the few regular sources 
of information about not only South Africa, but also the entire southern part 
of the African continent. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Noriega also disputed statements by executives at 
KCET that "South Africa Now" had been biased and then was changed in an 
apparent attempt to accommodate the Los Angeles station's concerns. KCET 
station manager Stephen Kulczycki and president William Kobin said last week 
that they were returning "South Africa Now" to the Sunday morning lineup 
because the program that aired last Sunday had contained "substantive changes" 
that rendered it fair and balanced. 
</P>
<P>
KCET had also said Friday that it was reversing its position because WNET, as 
the presenting station, had promised to begin screening "South Africa Now" 
every week to make sure it was not biased. Noriega said that he had always 
screened the program and that he never felt it was biased. 
</P>
<P>
"My reputation for being a straight-shooting journalist is clean as a whistle, 
and even before I came (to WNET), I viewed that broadcast as an opportunity for 
me to get information from a region that we don't get a lot of reporting on,' 
Noriega said. 
</P>
<P>
Schechter said that the program that KCET believed was changed had been in the 
works long before the station management voiced its complaints. By the time 
Kulczycki and Kobin viewed it on the satellite feed Friday, Schechter said, it 
had already aired twice in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Kobin said Wednesday that it didn't matter whether the producers acted as a 
direct response to KCET's concern. "The latest program was very different from 
earlier programs in its presentation of differing views on the issues involved 
in the stories covered," he said. "This, and the written communication and 
telephone calls with WNET, were taken as an indication that our concerns are 
being addressed. This is not a quarrel with WNET. Our goal is simply the 
production and broadcasting of a quality series. We hope that we're on the 
right course to achieving that."

DEPUTIES START PATROLS IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies begin patrolling the north end of Long Beach today to help 
the city's beleaguered, understaffed police tackle skyrocketing crime. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's patrols will cover 20% of the city, freeing 42 Long Beach police 
officers to work other parts of town or handle other assignments. Ten officers 
will be reassigned to the detective division by the end of the year to work on 
a huge backlog of unsolved crimes, police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The four-year, $19.9-million sheriff's contract makes Long Beach the first city 
in the state to have two law enforcement agencies within its boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-three deputies will patrol the north part of town in cars bearing both 
the sheriff's six-pointed star and the city's logo, a modern depiction of a 
skyline and ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Starting today, emergency 911 calls from residents in areas north of Market 
Street and north of Spring Street, east of Lakewood Boulevard, are being routed 
to the Lakewood sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Lawrence Binkley and other officials said the city department will 
still be understaffed. 
</P>
<P>
In the detective division, for example, an extra 10 detectives "will help" but 
will not be sufficient to clear hundreds of backlogged cases, Assistant Police 
Chief Eugene Brizzolara said. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach had the worst record of any major California city in 1989 for 
solving serious and violent crimes, according to the state Department of 
Justice. Police failed to solve 74% of the rapes, 87% of the robberies and 93% 
of the burglaries reported in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Binkley ordered the city's 157 detectives to work six-day 
weeks; the mandatory overtime will continue despite the additional detectives, 
Brizzolara said this week. "We'll still be short," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Binkley said: "The problem is the same old thing. I need people everywhere. I 
need them in patrol, traffic, metro, gang unit and detectives -- just 
everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Although the department budget calls for 691 officers, there are 45 vacancies. 
Another 40 officers are off and 25 are working light duty because of injuries, 
Brizzolara said. In addition, 43 officers are eligible to retire in December. 
</P>
<P>
The department has been unable to recruit enough new officers to fill the void. 
Twelve recruits are in training, Brizzolara said. Sheriff's deputies are 
expected to help fill the gap while the city recruits more officers. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen of the deputies will patrol the northeast; 25 will be based in the 
northern section, which has a higher crime rate, Sheriff's Lt. Bob Mirabella 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Sheriff's Department will provide a team leader to coordinate 
enforcement policies, a community relations deputy and a lieutenant who will be 
a liaison between the two agencies, according to Deputy City Manager John 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
The contract also calls for the Sheriff's Department to provide three community 
service officers, who are uniformed civilians, and follow-up detective service 
for cases generated by the deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies assigned to Long Beach this week underwent two days of training, 
including meetings with community leaders and a tour of north and northeast 
Long Beach. All the deputies volunteered for the Long Beach assignment. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is in place," said Sheriff's Division Chief Ray Morris, who 
oversees Southeast Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Mirabella, the sheriff's lieutenant who will be the liaison between the two 
agencies, said the only problem so far has been switching 911 calls. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some technical problems with the phone," Mirabella said. "(But) we put 
in a lot of extra hours, and we're now in a posture where everything that had 
to be done has been done." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach police will continue to oversee some services in the areas to be 
patrolled by deputies. Police, for example, will still be responsible for the 
anti-drug program in the schools, helicopter patrols and special event permits. 
</P>
<P>
During a meeting Monday night with 25 North Long Beach residents -- one in a 
series of community meetings -- representatives from the Police Department, the 
city and the Sheriff's Department expressed optimism about the deputy patrols. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to see law enforcement you haven't seen in a long time," Mayor 
Ernie Kell said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Warren Harwood, who represents the area to be patrolled, told the 
group that he expects the deputies to "do quality police work and suppress the 
troublemakers. We're tired of the thugs running our streets." 
</P>
<P>
For resident Larry Wright, it's too late. The father of three said he plans to 
sell his home and move to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a North Long Beach resident for six years, and I've just had it," 
Wright told the officials. "I don't think the Long Beach Police Department did 
a good job at all." 
</P>
<P>
Wright complained after the meeting that police were rarely seen patrolling the 
neighborhood, despite a growing number of shootings in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, defended the department. One resident said: "It seems to me 
that we've given up on the Long Beach Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
The resident echoed the concerns of many officers, who fear that the department 
will eventually be dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials said they are open to that idea, while others vehemently 
deny the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not intended to be a long-term contract," Williams, the city's 
assistant city manager, told the resident. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Cmdr. John Hammargren said earlier in the week: "We're not here to do 
anything more than our job. We don't see our roles as threatening." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a burgeoning crime problem and an understaffed Police Department, 
the Long Beach City Council approved a four-year contract with the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department on Sept. 4. But the decision to hire 43 deputies to 
patrol the north parts of town met with overwhelming opposition from several 
community organizations. The local branch of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People, among others, argued that the actions of 
deputies, who are county employees, would not be under review by the newly 
created Long Beach Citizen Police Complaint Commission. City leaders and 
sheriff's representatives said complaints can be filed with the Sheriff's 
Department and other agencies.

DEMOCRATS EXPECTED TO HAVE IT EASY IN LOPSIDED DISTRICTS

<P>
In Southeast Los Angeles County, Republican challengers in three state Senate 
districts have their work cut out for them as they try to stir voter interest 
in lopsided races. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats outnumber Republicans 3 to 1 in the 24th, 26th and 30th districts, 
which cover Bell Gardens, Commerce, Maywood, Montebello, Pico Rivera, 
Paramount, Lynwood and parts of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans and minor party candidates, such as Libertarians, are given little 
chance of breaking through the demographic barrier and toppling a Democratic 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
In the 30th District, which includes Paramount, Lynwood and parts of Long 
Beach, Long Beach Republican Timothy Poling is attempting to unseat veteran 
incumbent Ralph C. Dills of Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
Poling, a 25-year-old McDonnell Douglas engineer, accuses Dills of wasting tax 
money by supporting increased spending on big government programs such as 
public education. California, he says, needs legislators willing to find ways 
to scale back government. 
</P>
<P>
Poling's battle remains a battle of words, however. He has notified campaign 
officials that he expects to raise less than $1,000, while as of Sept. 30, 
Dills had amassed a war chest of $217,000. 
</P>
<P>
Dills, 80, has served as a state senator since 1966. He said his opponent has 
been vague on exactly where state spending should be cut. And California, he 
says, must provide its fast-growing population with more public services, not 
less. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't want to realize that California is a growing giant," Dills said 
recently. "The services we render have to be paid for. I am devoted to 
(government) doing for people what they can't do for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
In the race for the 24th and 26th District seats, Republican and Libertarian 
candidates face a similar uphill struggle against incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
In the 24th District, which includes Maywood, Commerce, and Bell Gardens, 
Republican Keith F. Marsh, 47, is hoping to score some points against his 
Democratic opponent Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) by putting out a mailer 
that touches on Torres' drunk-driving convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Torres, 44, who is seeking a third term, is facing his first election since he 
was arrested twice on suspicion of drunk driving and obtained treatment for 
alcoholism. However, he has a substantial fund-raising advantage and is 
expected to win handily. 
</P>
<P>
"If he wants to drink, that's fine," Marsh said, "but he shouldn't be drinking 
and driving." 
</P>
<P>
Torres said he has been open about his alcoholism and recovery efforts. "I hope 
people realize that this is behind me," he said. "I think people have seen that 
I have dealt with it." 
</P>
<P>
Torres said he hopes to concentrate on such issues as plans for the Los Angeles 
River basin, educational reform and the search for alternatives to the 
extension of the Long Beach Freeway through South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
David L. Wilson, 54, a carpenter who lives in Los Angeles, is the Libertarian 
candidate in the race. Wilson said his platform is simple: "no taxes." He 
described himself as a "paper candidate" who is not actively campaigning but is 
on the ballot to give voters a choice. 
</P>
<P>
Also expected to win is Sen. Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier), who is running 
for his first full term in the 26th District after winning a special election 
in April. The seat was held by Democrat Joseph B. Montoya of Whittier until he 
was convicted of political corruption charges and sent to federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon's ballot opponents are Republican Joe Aguilar Urquidi and Libertarian 
Kim Goldsworthy, the same candidates Calderon defeated in April. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon, a 40-year-old attorney, grew up in Montebello, served on the school 
board there and was elected to the Assembly in 1982. He was part of the 
so-called "Gang of Five" that unsuccessfully challenged the leadership of 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A political moderate, Calderon has authored legislation on interstate banking, 
landfills, open meetings and relief for earthquake victims. He supports 
abortion rights and capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Urquidi, 64, a businessman who lives in Montebello, saw military service in 
World War II and Korea, held administrative positions in government manpower 
agencies, has been married 42 years and is the father of nine children. 
</P>
<P>
Urquidi is running on an eight-point platform that includes insurance reform, 
opposition to abortion, education reform to prepare students for jobs in 
technologically advanced industries and protection of pension funds. He said he 
favors mandatory 10-year prison sentences for participants in gang shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsworthy, 34, is a computer programmer and has lived in Rosemead for 25 
years. He has served as county chairman of the Libertarian Party, given talks 
on the U.S. Constitution to more than 100 organizations and is a member of 
Mensa, the high IQ society.

COLORFUL F &amp; M BANK CITED FOR LACK OF LOANS TO THE POOR;

<P>
BANKING: ALTHOUGH ONE OF THE SOUNDEST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE COUNTRY, 
THE LONG BEACH BANK WAS DEEMED TO BE IN NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL 
COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT.

<P>
Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank of Long Beach, said to be one of the soundest 
financial institutions in the country, has failed to make sufficient loan money 
available to low-income and poor people as required by federal law, according 
to a recent survey by banking regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Of 38 banks and thrifts rated in the nation by the Federal Reserve System 
between July and September, the Long Beach bank was the only one deemed to be 
in "substantial noncompliance" with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, 
which says a financial institution must meet the credit needs of its community, 
including the poor, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
F &amp; M Bank is considered one of the nation's soundest, if not its most 
colorful. The 91-year-old chairman keeps a 12-gauge shotgun in his office, and 
his son makes loans from a roll-top desk at the historic main office on Pine 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The publication American Banker described it as an extraordinarily profitable 
privately held institution with $1.3 billion in assets. It advertises itself as 
the strongest bank in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
But federal officials say Farmers &amp; Merchants is neglecting the needs of 
the poor in Long Beach, where nine of the bank's 16 branches are based. A 
request to open a 17th branch was denied Oct. 15 as a result of the low rating. 
</P>
<P>
President Kenneth G. Walker, grandson of the bank's founder, called the rating 
"completely wrong," and said the bank has gone to great lengths to help meet 
the needs of the poor. Bank officials are preparing to contest the rating, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been very active in low-income housing and condominium housing and 
senior citizen homes, and we continue to do so. They (the regulators) just 
don't have the ability to recognize it," said Walker, who runs the bank founded 
in 1907. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 38 banks examined by the Federal Reserve System nationwide, only Farmers 
&amp; Merchants received the rating of substantial noncompliance, the lowest of 
four possible scores. 
</P>
<P>
The bank is the first in the nation to receive a noncompliance rating since 
July 1, when financial institutions were required to make their performance 
grades public. Ratings of more banks will be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
The examinations have been conducted for years, but only since July 1 has the 
law required that the grades be publicly disclosed. Federal regulators will not 
identify the banks they survey or their scores, but the law requires that the 
banks make that information public within 30 working days after they are rated. 
</P>
<P>
The recent public disclosure requirement and heightened protests by community 
groups have trained a spotlight on the otherwise obscure law, which was enacted 
to help low-income people secure housing and to prevent lenders from 
discriminating against the poor. 
</P>
<P>
California's three largest banks this year announced major programs for 
low-income and minority communities: Bank of America promised to commit $50 
million, Security Pacific Bank pledged $2.4 billion over the next decade, and 
Wells Fargo Bank committed $1 billion over the next seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly banks that get their deposits from members in the community, 
including low-income members, have a responsibility to give something back in 
the way of affordable housing," said Dennis Rockway, senior counsel with the 
Legal Aid Foundation of Long Beach. "I am certainly not aware of any 
significant contribution Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank has made in that regard." 
</P>
<P>
The bank's attitude toward lending money, in the words of a recent Forbes 
magazine article, "makes Scrooge seem like a spendthrift." They lend only to 
reliable customers, require more collateral than most and treat their patrons 
like family, right down to the box of fruit that is sent to longtime depositors 
every quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, whose family's fortune is estimated at $200 million, says the Federal 
Reserve System is making a scapegoat out of a conservative bank that is sound 
to the core in these days of savings and loan disasters. 
</P>
<P>
If the performance rating survives F &amp; M's challenge, it could not only 
bruise the bank's public image but impair its expansion. Under the law, 
regulators must consider the performance rating when reviewing an institution's 
application to open new branches or merge, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to meet the standards of the Community Reinvestment Act can result in 
legal action, although that is rare, said Ronald Supinski of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of San Francisco, which oversees 64 financial institutions in the 
western United States. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, regulators issue a memo of understanding, the terms of which are 
"usually carried out" by the bank, he said.

MONTEBELLO IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT FOR AUTO PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

MONTEBELLO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another piece of the sprawling commercial corridor envisioned by city leaders 
in the hills of northern Montebello fell into place recently when the City 
Council approved an agreement to negotiate with two auto companies to develop a 
10-acre auto park. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted, 4 to 1, to begin exclusive talks with Ford Motor Land 
Development Co. and Ostrom Chevrolet, which want five acres each to build an 
auto sales center. 
</P>
<P>
The auto park is one of three projects planned in the 660-acre Montebello Hills 
Redevelopment Project Area, which encompasses the rolling hillside now dotted 
by oil wells south of the Pomona Freeway and parts of town north of Beverly 
Boulevard between Garfield Avenue and the Rio Hondo River. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes as planned, the auto park will be built between Montebello 
Boulevard and the Pomona Freeway, just west of Paramount Boulevard. Linda 
Payan, the city's economic development director, said the auto complex would 
provide 150 to 200 jobs, and the city could reap $500,000 a year in sales tax 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Before work begins, officials of the land development company and Ostrom 
Chevrolet must present the city with a final proposal within 120 days. Each 
company is negotiating to buy a five-acre parcel, which would cost about $2 
million, Payan said. 
</P>
<P>
Payan said the city is marking down the price per square foot from $13 to $9, 
saving each company about $900,000, including the price of land grading. 
</P>
<P>
If the final proposal by the two companies is approved by the city, Ostrom will 
relocate from its Whittier Boulevard location, and Ford may open a new sales 
center or relocate an existing center, Payan said. 
</P>
<P>
Final paper work has yet to be completed, but city leaders are confident that a 
deal with the companies will be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're talking about this much money, it's not a done deal until the 
check is signed," Mayor Ed Pizzorno said. "But I would expect things are 90% 
solid. I'm optimistic, we are well on our way." 
</P>
<P>
Payan said the city was approached by four auto dealers who wanted to buy the 
10-acre site, but Ford and Ostrom Chevrolet had the strongest proposals and, 
historically, have had the strongest sales. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed auto park is just one chunk of a growing commercial core in 
northern Montebello. By the end of the decade, city officials estimate, at 
least 130 acres of retail shops, restaurants and many other businesses could be 
operating around the intersection of Montebello and Paramount boulevards. If 
the businesses succeed, the city could be earning about $3 million a year in 
sales tax revenues from the northern Montebello commercial corridor. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes people come up to me, and they ask, 'Why do you want more shops up 
there? Why do we need an auto center?' " Pizzorno said. "People sometimes don't 
realize what things like that mean to a city. 
</P>
<P>
"They want police protection, fire protection, park programs. . . . It's the 
sales tax produced up there that pays for all that protection. To do everything 
that the people want, we have to have the money." 
</P>
<P>
To get that money, the city in May approved the $33-million Montebello Town 
Square project, a 20-acre commercial center to be built next to the auto park 
and east of the 5-year-old Montebello Regional Town Center shopping mall. The 
mall last year pumped $982,000 in sales tax revenue into the city's coffers.

A woman who feared that her estranged husband would gain custody of their 
3-year-old daughter shot and killed the girl and then herself Wednesday as they 
rode in a friend's camper in Panorama City, Los Angeles police said this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Josephina Rios, 29, died about 10:15 p.m., four hours after she fired a single 
round into the head of her daughter, Samantha, and then shot herself in the 
head, Sgt. Joe Braza said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators found a note apparently written by Rios saying she was despondent 
over the prospect of her husband's gaining custody of their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Mike Houchen said Rios apparently feared that her husband, whose name 
was not released, would disappear with the child. The couple, who lived in 
Anaheim, had recently separated and were going through a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
"The mother left a suicide note indicating this was best for the child and 
herself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the shooting, Rios and her daughter were riding in the back of a 
camper driven by the woman's friend, Pasquale Buzzelli.

A traffic reporter and pilot were killed early today when their single-engine 
plane crashed into an embankment along a busy freeway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed shortly before 7:45 a.m. about a quarter-mile north of Via de 
la Valle and Interstate 5, in the Solana Beach area, barely missing a child day 
care center. 
</P>
<P>
The Grumman aircraft was being leased by Metro Traffic Control. The plane, with 
a pilot and reporter aboard, was circling over an accident under investigation 
by the California Highway Patrol near Via de la Valle when it went down.

COURT KILLS FUNDING BAN, SETS RULES ON INITIATIVES

<P>
The state Supreme Court today threw out a ban on non-election year fund-raising 
by legislative candidates and set ground rules for competing initiatives that 
could affect next week's measures on term limits and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
In a 5-2 decision, the court said that when two rival measures are on the same 
ballot and get majority votes, only the one with more votes takes effect, and 
no provisions of the other can be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, effective in 30 days, voided all remaining provisions of 
Proposition 68, a campaign finance initiative for legislative candidates that 
was approved in June, 1988, by 53% of the voters. Proposition 73, a milder 
campaign finance measure on the same ballot, got 58% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
The court rejected arguments by Common Cause and other groups backing Prop. 68 
that portions of the measure that did not expressly conflict with Prop. 73 
could be salvaged: an overall limit on contributions to legislative candidates 
and a ban on off-year election fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
Contribution limits in Prop. 73 have been ruled unconstitutional by a federal 
judge but have been allowed to remain in effect for legislative races until 
appeals are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Today's ruling could affect several sets of competing initiatives on Tuesday's 
ballot, wiping out all provisions of a measure that passed by a majority but 
got fewer votes than a conflicting measure. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Propositions 131 and 140 contain rival sets of term limits for 
officeholders, but each also contains other provisions. 
</P>
<P>
Competing environmental measures -- Propositions 130 and 138 on forestry, the 
Prop. 128 "Big Green" initiative and its farmer-backed Prop. 135 rival on 
pesticides -- also contain many provisions that do not conflict with any 
portions of the other measures.

'BARBARISM' CHARGED; 4 TO BE FREED

<P>
Iraq today promised to release four more American hostages soon and insisted 
that it is treating foreign captives well. President Bush again denounced the 
hostage-holding and vowed to drive Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"They have committed outrageous acts of barbarism," Bush said of Hussein's 
forces. "Brutality -- I don't believe that Adolf Hitler ever participated in 
anything of that nature." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration responded angrily today to an offer by Iraq a day 
earlier to allow holiday visits by relatives of hostages. State Department 
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler called it "shameless . . . cruel and 
insensitive." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein, she said, "should not be discussing visits. He should be discussing 
the immediate release today of all those held against their will." 
</P>
<P>
Iraq again expressed fears that the United States will use reports of hostage 
maltreatment as a pretext to launch a military strike. Iraqi Information 
Minister Latif Jasim, announcing plans to free four sick and elderly Americans, 
denied that the captives are being treated badly. 
</P>
<P>
"All the Americans at sites have complete freedom. They can watch TV, read 
books and read newspapers," he told reporters in Baghdad. "They also enjoy the 
friendship of Iraqi forces." 
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi News Agency identified the four to be freed as Randall 
Trinah, Dr. Abdul Kanji, Raymond Galles and Michael Barnes. It did not give 
their ages or hometowns, or say when they would be freed. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, on a campaign swing in Burlington, Mass., made it clear that the plight 
of the hostages is much on his mind. He said the world community is "united in 
anger and outrage" at the treatment of the captives. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Bush said he still hopes for a peaceful resolution but insisted 
that "there will be no compromise" in the demand that Iraq relinquish Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The comments likening Hussein to Hitler were made at a subsequent stop. 
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that by using such strong 
rhetoric, the President is trying "to prepare the American people for any 
eventuality." 
</P>
<P>
"If we do have to take dramatic action, we want them to know why," Fitzwater 
said without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Iraqi assurances about the captives' welfare, letters smuggled from two 
American hostages and released by a U.S. official in Baghdad today painted a 
picture of fear and desperation. 
</P>
<P>
In one, the author urged Americans not to forget their captive countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been in the Iraqi gulag system for almost two months. We are virtually 
prisoners in Iraq," the letter writer said. 
</P>
<P>
The other wrote that he had been moved five times and was receiving no mail or 
messages. He said he had lost 35 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Please do not forget the guest hostages," the first letter writer pleaded. 
Iraq calls the detained foreigners guests. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, aboard the amphibious assault ship Iwo Jima, more than 1,000 
American servicemen stood at attention on deck in a memorial ceremony honoring 
the 10 victims of Tuesday's accident. 
</P>
<P>
Servicemen sang the Navy hymn, a 21-gun salute was fired, and buglers played 
taps.

<P>
At least 31 more people died today across India in riots linked to an attempt 
by Hindus to raze a mosque and erect a temple on the site, news agencies 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
In Ayodhya, about 300 miles southwest of New Delhi, more than 10,000 Hindu 
pilgrims threatened further attempts to overrun the mosque, and a police 
official promised to investigate reports that authorities dumped slain Hindu 
protesters in a river. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict has caused at least 210 deaths around the nation since Oct. 24 and 
threatens to topple Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh's National Front 
coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
Most of today's deaths were in the states of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, where 
the disputed site is located, police said. Uttar Pradesh, the nation's most 
populous state with 120 million people, is about 30% Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the fighting were not released by officials, fearing that it would 
exacerbate tensions between majority Hindus and Muslims.

Former Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. directed federal grants to 
political friends and later misled Congress about his involvement, 
congressional investigators said today. 
</P>
<P>
Their report stopped short of concluding that Pierce committed perjury before a 
House panel or that he and others at the agency violated criminal laws. 
</P>
<P>
It said those questions would be left to the special prosecutor now 
investigating Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Pierce said the report was politically motivated and contained 
"spurious allegations." 
</P>
<P>
The report, the result of a House subcommittee's 16-month investigation of the 
Reagan Administration's Department of Housing and Urban Development, said 
Pierce concealed the extent of his involvement in the steering of federal 
housing grants. 
</P>
<P>
"At best, Secretary Pierce was less than honest and misled the subcommittee 
about his involvement in abuses and favoritism in HUD funding decisions," the 
report said. "At worst, Secretary Pierce knowingly lied and committed perjury 
during his testimony." 
</P>
<P>
The report was released by the House Government Operations Committee, whose 
employment and housing subcommittee investigated the scandals involving 
favoritism, mismanagement and political abuse at HUD.

'RED SEA HIGHWAY PATROL' ENFORCES EMBARGO

ABOARD THE CRUISER BIDDLE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On an average of three times a day, a handpicked team of armed U.S. sailors 
boards merchant ships in the Red Sea that might be trying to break a U.N. 
embargo to get supplies to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the Red Sea Highway Patrol," said Gunner's Mate William Kitchens, 27, of 
Lakeland, Fla., a member of Boarding Team Alpha aboard the guided missile 
cruiser Biddle. 
</P>
<P>
"We should put a red and blue light atop the ship with a siren. It's more 
police work than anything else. We're stopping contraband from reaching its 
goal," Kitchens said this week. 
</P>
<P>
The United Nations authorized the naval quarantine to punish Iraq for its Aug. 
2 conquest of Kuwait. Nothing but medical supplies are allowed in, and no 
ships, including tankers carrying Iraq's lifeblood of oil exports, are getting 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the seagoing police work is done in the northern Red Sea, which 
includes traffic coming south from the Suez Canal and bound for the Jordanian 
port of Aqaba. 
</P>
<P>
What was one of the world's busiest shipping lanes just three months ago now 
has more warships than merchant vessels. 
</P>
<P>
"The shipping volume has been substantially throttled down. There's been an 80% 
reduction in the volume of shipping," said Rear Adm. Nick Gee, commander of Red 
Sea operations by the Maritime Interdiction Force. 
</P>
<P>
A ring of warships is on patrol around the Arabian peninsula, which is bounded 
by the Red Sea, Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf. One of the warships is the 
Biddle, part of the task force accompanying the aircraft carrier Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a total roadblock. This is a very effective blockade," said Capt. Louis 
Harlow, the Biddle's skipper. "The Iraqis have to be hurting." 
</P>
<P>
Since the embargo began in August, 3,107 ships have been intercepted, with 310 
boarded. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Biddle stopped the Greek container ship Zim Venezia, 
which was headed for Eilat, Israel, right next door to Aqaba. 
</P>
<P>
A 20-member boarding team carrying side arms and shotguns and wearing flak 
jackets scurried down a rope ladder onto a 26-foot whale boat for a 1,500-yard 
trip to the merchant ship. 
</P>
<P>
The boarding party, made up of Navy and U.S. Coast Guard personnel, checked the 
ship's paper work and crew before it was allowed to continue. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has nicknamed the Red Sea operation Toto Station, after the line in 
"The Wizard of Oz" when Judy Garland tells her dog, "Gee, Toto, I don't think 
we're in Kansas anymore."

Four homeless people have filed a class-action suit against the city seeking 
clean and safe public toilets. 
</P>
<P>
The suit filed Wednesday against the city and two transit agencies contends 
that the failure to provide toilets constitutes a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
It says the plaintiffs, three men and a woman, are "forced to endure continual 
embarrassment, humiliation, physical injury and hazardous conditions." 
</P>
<P>
The Legal Action Center for the Homeless, which represents the plaintiffs, said 
the lack of public toilets in the city is a hardship not only for the homeless 
but also for pregnant women, the elderly, tourists and outdoor workers. 
</P>
<P>
A report by the center said that of 105 Transit Authority restrooms surveyed, 
fewer than one-third were open to the public, and half of those were in bad 
condition.

Victor Kiam, owner of Remington Products Inc., has been charged with misleading 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Also charged are Remington Products Canada of Mississauga, Ontario, and Grey 
Advertising of Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
The charges under Canada's Competition Act deal with commercials aired in 1987 
and 1988 for the Micro Screen Ultimate Electric Shaver. 
</P>
<P>
One charge alleges that the commercials make performance claims without 
adequate substantiation. The other charge is under a general provision that 
prohibits misleading advertising. 
</P>
<P>
For Kiam, conviction could mean five years in prison or a fine for which the 
act sets no maximum. 
</P>
<P>
The commercials in question claim that the Micro Screen Ultimate shaves as 
close as a blade and closer than any other electric shaver.

The Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange agreed today to 
provide training and technical advice to help the fledgling Moscow Commodities 
Exchange grow from "one step above barter" into a Western-style market. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement with the two American organizations is designed to help the 
entrepreneurs who set up the five-month-old Moscow exchange as they struggle to 
break away from 70 years of central planning and set up a free market for 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, just about anything from construction materials to radios can be 
directly traded and sold at the exchange's small monthly sessions in a corner 
of a Moscow exhibition hall -- if someone has the materials to trade. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange plans to expand to two sessions a month by the end of the year, 
and organizers hope eventually to deal in contracts and establish a futures 
market as well as set up a currency exchange as the ruble moves toward 
convertibility.

<P>
The U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago has upheld a 30-year-old 
Federal Aviation Administration rule that forces commercial airline pilots to 
retire at age 60. 
</P>
<P>
The three-judge panel voted 2 to 1 Wednesday against a group of airline pilots 
who sought to have the rule overturned. 
</P>
<P>
But all three judges voiced reservations about the ruling. The senior judge, 
Hubert L. Will, wrote a strongly worded dissent. The FAA established the 
retirement rule in 1960 and has argued consistently that allowing pilots to fly 
beyond age 60 would be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say pilots in their 60s have experience that benefits passengers, and 
cite the 1989 crash of a United Airlines jetliner in Sioux City, Iowa, to back 
their case. A 57-year-old pilot landed a jet, despite a crippled hydraulic 
system.

Construction spending sank 2.8% in September, its sharpest plunge in more than 
eight years, the government said today. Declines in all categories led to the 
worst showing since the last recession. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and government 
spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $428.7 billion. That was 
the lowest dollar level since $423.1 billion was spent in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The 2.8% decline was the sharpest since spending fell 3% in January, 1982, in 
the midst of the 1981-82 recession. 
</P>
<P>
Spending was virtually unchanged in both July and August and has not increased 
since March, when it advanced 0.4%. July turned out to be weaker than 
previously thought. The department first reported construction actually turned 
up 0.3% that month. 
</P>
<P>
Construction spending in September was 1.1% below the $433.4 billion spent in 
the same month of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have said declining confidence because of the Persian Gulf crisis has 
exacerbated an already weakened construction industry.

Soccer great Pele celebrated his 50th birthday by playing with Brazil's 
national team against a group of world all-stars in what he said was possibly 
his last appearance on a soccer field. 
</P>
<P>
Pele, who led Brazil to three World Cup championships in the 1950s and '60s, 
wore the No. 10 jersey he made famous during the exhibition game Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Pele surrendered to fatigue and emotion after 40 minutes, during which he made 
some clean passes, missed a long goal shot and led a fast counterattack in the 
2-1 loss. 
</P>
<P>
He ended his professional career in 1977 with the now-defunct New York Cosmos.

The jurors who found that Mike Tyson fondled a woman in a disco were urged 
today to punish the former heavyweight champion and award her punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
"This type of thing can't happen," the woman's attorney, Alan Clark, said as 
the second phase of the trial opened. 
</P>
<P>
"You just can't go out and do whatever you want." 
</P>
<P>
Clark then recalled Tyson as a witness and questioned him about a financial 
statement that put the fighter's net worth at $15 million as of Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson said he made more than $20 million in 1989 but testified that he didn't 
know his income for this year. 
</P>
<P>
The jury ruled on Tuesday that Tyson grabbed Sandra Miller's breasts and 
buttocks after she refused his advances at Bentley's Disco in Manhattan on Dec. 
10, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who testified during the first phase of the trial, acknowledged that he 
was at Bentley's Disco that night but denied knowing or ever touching Miller. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors awarded Miller $100 in compensatory damages. She is seeking up to 
$2.5 million in punitive damages in her civil lawsuit.

TOP BC RUSHER DECLARED INELIGIBLE FOR USING DRUG

Running back Tim Frager, Boston College's leading rusher this season, has been 
declared ineligible for the remainder of the season for violating NCAA 
regulations regarding a prescription medication. 
</P>
<P>
The school said Wednesday that Frager's medication was on the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s list of 20 banned substances. The school didn't say 
what the substance was, but emphasized it was not cocaine, marijuana or 
steroids. 
</P>
<P>
Frager was randomly tested by the NCAA last week for steroids when the banned 
substance was found. The school said Frager was tested by the school's own 
random-testing program three times this season, and all tests were negative. 
</P>
<P>
The school appealed the NCAA finding on Monday, but the appeal was denied. 
</P>
<P>
Head Coach Jack Bicknell said the drug was not prescribed by the team 
physician. 
</P>
<P>
"I never sat down with the kids and said this is the 20 or so things on the 
list," Bicknell said. "I just said no steroids and no drugs. In the appeal we 
were as forceful as we could be. . . . Looking back, it was probably doomed 
from the start because it was on the sheet of banned substances and Tim signed 
the sheet. It's just a shame." 
</P>
<P>
Frager, who had gained 252 yards on 77 attempts for 3.3-yard average through 
seven games, is on schedule to graduate with his class this spring. He will 
continue his education and remain on scholarship, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse defensive back Darrell Jones has been charged with sexual abuse and 
trespassing for allegedly fondling and harassing a 19-year-old student in her 
apartment, school officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The junior backup from Somerset, N.J., also has been suspended from the team 
and will not attend practice until allegations surrounding the incident are 
resolved, said sports information director Larry Kimball. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 21, was arraigned on second-degree criminal trespass and third-degree 
sexual abuse charges in city court Tuesday. He was released on his own 
recognizance pending a pretrial hearing Nov. 20. 
</P>
<P>
A Syracuse University judicial board has scheduled a meeting to discuss the 
incident, which allegedly occurred Oct. 19, Kimball said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now he's going to school and trying to clear up his name and 
reputation," football Coach Dick MacPherson said.

Joan Benoit Samuelson, the 1984 Olympic gold medalist and the American

Samuelson said she made her decision today after experiencing discomfort during 
a six-mile run.

Samuelson, 33, emphasized that this was not the end of her running career.

Scenic Regal is a lady in waiting. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, she will try to become a queen of the sport she has served so 
well when she attempts to win the Mare Trot, one of eight Breeders Crown 
harness races contested at Pompano Park. 
</P>
<P>
A victory would be the first for the 8-year-old mare after finishing second 
three consecutive times in the race. 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish that, she will have to beat eight rivals including the 4-year-old 
Peace Corps, who won the 2-year-old Filly Trot in 1988 and the 3-year-old Filly 
Trot last year. Only two horses have won three Breeders Crown races -- the mare 
Grades Singing and the horse Mack Lobell, both trotters. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a perfect mare in all ways," said Harold Story, who drives Scenic 
Regal for owner Dr. Terrance McGee, a veterinarian from Marlboro, Mass. "She 
does absolutely nothing wrong, on the track or in the barn." 
</P>
<P>
Scenic Regal has made 122 starts and has scored 68 wins, 23 seconds and eight 
thirds, with earnings of $956,140. This year, she has eight wins, six seconds 
and one third in 17 races. 
</P>
<P>
Scenic Regal drew the No. 7 post. Peace Corps, who has raced this year in 
Scandinavia and Europe, drew the No. 4 post. 
</P>
<P>
While Peace Corps will try to do what only two others have done, Beach Towel 
will try to make history in the 3-year-old Pace. 
</P>
<P>
A victory or a second-place finish in the $366,933 race would make Beach Towel, 
who has 17 wins and four seconds in 22 starts this year, the first harness 
racehorse to win $2 million in one year.

Dr. George Nichopoulos, Elvis Presley's personal physician for 11 years, 
discounts the claim of Presley biographer Albert Goldman that the King 
committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
In his first interview since the King's death in 1977, Nichopoulos said on the 
syndicated TV program "A Current Affair" that Presley's death may have been 
caused by the pressures of stardom or psychological problems. 
</P>
<P>
But he said, "I don't think Elvis was capable of committing suicide. . . . (He) 
had many opportunities to commit suicide at much more stressful times." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Nichopoulos was acquitted of prescribing excessive amounts of 
narcotics to Presley and eight other patients. He was accused of prescribing 
more than 10,000 doses of drugs during the 18 months before Presley's death. 
</P>
<P>
The interview will air next week.

Entertainer Eddie Fisher says ex-wife Elizabeth Taylor has severe problems and 
he's "fearful for her." 
</P>
<P>
In a television interview with Geraldo Rivera broadcast Wednesday, Fisher said 
Taylor's problem with drugs is just as bad as when they were married in the 
early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"I was using . . . hardly anything when I was with Elizabeth," he said of his 
own 37-year addiction to drugs. "I was her nurse for all those years and her 
problem was tremendous. . . . Whatever her problem was in 1960, it was the same 
in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher said his ex-wife's problems are "very, very severe and I feel very 
fearful for her today." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's publicist, Chen Sam, said: "There's no comment on what the man's 
saying. Miss Taylor is doing very well. She's in perfect health." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher said he stopped using drugs after being treated at the Betty Ford clinic 
six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills and pain killers 
in 1983, has been treated for alcohol and drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor and Fisher married in May, 1959. She left him and married Richard Burton 
in May, 1964.

A magician who compared himself to the legendary Harry Houdini and had himself 
buried inside a plastic-and-glass coffin for a Halloween night escape trick was 
killed when the coffin collapsed under tons of dirt and wet cement. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Burrus, 32, a recovering drug addict, was performing the stunt at a 
local amusement park, Blackbeard's Family Fun Center, when the coffin 
unexpectedly collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
As trick-and-treaters watched in shock, rescuers frantically dug Burrus out but 
were unable to reach him in time. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider myself a master of illusion and escape artist," Burrus said before 
the stunt. "I believe I'm the next Houdini and greater." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Houdini, considered the master of escape artists, died on Halloween night 
in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
Burrus had done the escape-from-the-buried-casket stunt successfully a year ago 
in Oregon using only dirt over the coffin. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night, wearing a white tuxedo, Burrus was handcuffed, wrapped in 
chains, locked inside the see-through coffin and then lowered into a 
seven-foot-deep hole. 
</P>
<P>
Crews started pouring wet cement into the hole from a cement truck until Burrus 
knocked on the casket lid asking them to stop. 
</P>
<P>
"He said the chain was too tight (around his neck) and was choking him," said 
Sean Henderson, a resident of the Third Floor drug recovery clinic. Burrus was 
staging the stunt as a benefit for the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave him time to slip the chain from his neck. After he got that done, he 
wanted the locks back on and asked us to start burying him again," Henderson 
said. The crews put another three feet of dirt into the hole and then began 
covering that with three feet of cement. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we finished and the truck pulled away the whole thing dropped," 
Henderson said. "The . . . cement busted the coffin. It buried him alive." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said they could hear the plastic and glass of the coffin shatter from 
the estimated nine tons of cement and dirt. The crews worked frantically to 
exhume the casket, but efforts to revive Burrus were unsuccessful.
